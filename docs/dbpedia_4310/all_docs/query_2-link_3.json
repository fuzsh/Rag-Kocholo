This museum has a biggest collection in the field of Ja-\n\npanese modern art. The curator had planned a series of eight lectures on\n\neach of eight works, eight masterpieces of the museum. My work, Ana\n\n(Hole), is one of them. So, I was asked to give a lecture on this selected\n\nwork. I happened to see Nenad at this museum before the lecture. Last\n\ntime I saw him was more than ten years ago when I had visited to Yugo-\n\nslavia. I have known him and respect him for his splendid talent not on-\n\nly as a mail artist but also a performing artist. Even it was a short meet-\n\ning but we had made an interesting collaborating performance in front\n\nof my work, Ana (Hole). Two mail artists met by chance in the Far East\n\nknowing each other by mail art - networking. It was significant and inte-\n\nresting exchange for both of us that we have done such a collaboration\n\nat the regulated facility, a public museum, by knowing each other in the\n\ncounter method of networking.\n\nJanuary 31, 1997\n\nWladyslaw Kazmierczak:\n\nThis performance was created spontaneously. There was a bottle of vodka and two glasses on the table. Wladyslaw Kazmierczak said a few sentences about the war in Yugoslavia: This year there was a war in Europe. It happened in Yugoslavia. We do not even remember the dates, when it started and when it ended. From the reports on Polish Television we do remember that thousands of refugees escaped to Albania every day. The Western press discussed only NATO failures. We know that Miloszevic is a bad man. Somebody has recently said to me that Bill Clinton is a man of a third millennium. But there a few million people between Miloszevic and Clinton.\n\nAfter this short introduction, Kazmierczak threw a firework on the floor. He shook Nenad's hand and they stayed in that gesture for the whole performance. The artists had only their left hands to act with. Nenad poured some vodka into glasses and made a gesture \"to your health\", but his partner did not drink it. Kazmierczak took a hairdryer into his hand and blew at Nenad's hair and face with warm air. He then introduced a toy gorilla which when moved, played: \"Ole, ole, ole, ole, we are the champs, we are the champs\". Instead of a normal glass he took his own one, with double walls and liquid between them. He drank but he did not drink. Afterwards, he dusted Nenad with a feather duster. He sprayed him with perfumes and gave him a red heart. Next, he started to hit him with all his might with a plastic air-toy in the shape of a flail with a sphere studded with nails at the end of it. He waved a bundle of bank notes under his nose. But Nenad's face was motionless, stiffened during the whole performance. Afterwards, Kazmierczak started to shoot at Nenad with a plastic sparking toy-gun. The gorilla-mascot played his \"Ole, ole\" from time to time. But it did not work, so Kazmierczak started to shoot at Nenad from the best gun in the world - UZI. He showed his partner a colourful toy sword, a Barbie doll and another one, next - a bigger heart that when pressed shouted \"I love you, I love you\". Then, he put on a rubber mask with an odious tongue and showed a gesture \"V\" - Victory. Through a magnifying glass he showed his eyes and the eyes of Nenad. He took a blow-up baseball bat in the colours of the American flag and with all his might hit Nenad on the head. After taking off the mask there were a series of short displays of already shown gadgets after which Kazmierczak put a target on a Yugoslavian artist's neck and a plastic air-helmet (of samurais?, pilots?) on his head and threw darts at the target. In that moment, the music started - \"Alabama Song: (whiskey bar)\" of The Doors. After two minutes the artists stood up. \"Half-communication\" was over. In the end.\n\nJune 27, 1999\n\nJuniper Perlis :\n\nNenad Bogdanovic performed two works during the IMAF 8 festival. Each was distinct… sounding, looking, feeling very different from one another, yet they both reveal the artist’s investment in the histories and ideologies of art and art practice. In “A sketch for a movement technics,” performed in Novi Sad, Nenad stands in front of a projected animation of Muybridge photographs as industrial music fills the small space. Intermittently taking sips of brandy and sharing sips with the audience, Nenad gets drunk. He stands on a floor littered with ads for hard drives and says, “Human, or human brain,” while holding a hard drive aloft. The animation and the music talk to another, not quite in sync. Muybridge, the beginning of film, signifies a technological turning point in art, information as truth and the power of the image. As Nenad begins to slur a bit we are shown his humanity. At the end of the performance he smashes the hard drive with a sledgehammer. This physical act is bound to the images of the Muybridge athletes. Dancing to their industrial beats, they are impervious to the brandy, as they are a product of the hard drive, the human brain. This performance offers itself as an alternative to the truth of technology.\n\nIn “I am a rich artist,” performed in Belgrade, Nenad stands watch, looking debonair in a slick suit, while the audience creates works on paper. They turn these into him for twenty dinar apiece. He then tapes them to the wall, signs his name to them, and prices them for sale. By engaging in the exploitation of artists, Nenad compounds his metaphor. He isn’t just playing a part. He buys the audience’s participation, not with dinar, but with artistic appreciation and value. I was struck by how attached to their “drawings” the participants were. They were invested in the objects they produced, some proud of their originality or color choices. But their choices are insignificant; it is their desire to display their creativity and Nenad’s ability to manipulate this desire which creates meaning.\n\nAugust 13 & 14, 2006\n\nMalgorzata Butterwick:\n\nAs we entered the space, it was already prepared for the performance. Nenad created a special painting canvas resembling a low table, with five pipes attached to its surface and hanging down to the floor. He introduced the title of the performance: ´Everyday situation for a nicer painting´, and immediately started by painting the word ´NICER´ onto the canvas with five main colours, directly from the tubes. The letters were situated close to the nozzles of the pipes. Then, he ate a sandwich, cleaned his teeth, and spat the rinsing water through the tube onto the canvas. It mixed with the paint of the first letter ´N´, leaving the smudged mark. The artist repeated a similar action five times, in a relaxed pace, using different foods (an orange, chocolate bar, bread…), and at the end smoked a cigarette. Every time the next letter was washed over with water. At the end, he run his hand roughly through the picture and thus a final painting was obtained, taken off the canvas, and away. The action ended here.\n\nThe performance was a link between live art and painting, we could say ´action painting´, but in a way that gives the action itself a new, strong context in its own right, not just as a way to obtain an aesthetic effect. Here the life, although with a fragmented, symbolic gesture, entered the action of painting in order to create an image that is directly linked to the ´everyday´, common activity. The artist indicates, that art is for him an ongoing process, the performance being a life attitude, not just an occasional ´act´. I would also like to point out the humorous side of the use of the word ´nicer´, which in English really means all and nothing, is a bit of a cliché. Maybe Nenad tries to show here a bit of a distance to the use of painting as an object to admire…while in his other actions he treats himself as a ´canvas´ for the action, painting or being painted on his own body as a ´MAN GALLERY´ traveling around the world. Here this situation was turned round, concentrated on the relationship between the life basics and the attitude to ´making art´.\n\nMay 17, 2007\n\nAndrew James Paterson:\n\nThe evening’s programme at Xpace involved duration, options of continuing, formation of images, and a lot more. Serbian artist Nenad Bogdanovic presented Seventh situation for a nicer painting. A canvas was suspended on four support strings stretched across the gallery, each corner held by an artist-participant. Bogdanovic retrieved his squeezable paint-tubes one by one and made a word painting. N in black, I in green, C in red, E in yellow, and R in black. NICER. Then he ate an apple and then appeared to brush his teeth with something mysterious. Whatever the toothpaste was, it permitted him to spit out a fluid onto the canvas, adding drips and another layer of paint and smudges and artistic whatevers. Bogdanovic repeated this process with different foods, liquids, and stimulants (a chocolate bar, a banana, an entire bottle of Coca-Cola, and a cigarette, and more). He was able to spit out different colours. Actually quite impressive.\n\nI thought he was going to keep spitting out paint/fluid until the word NICER had become completely abstracted. I did think of the infamous provocateur Jubal Brown, who once declared that Mondrian could benefit from another colour and thus vomited blue food colour onto a Mondrian canvas at the Art Gallery of Ontario. I also found myself remembering the Australian movie Man of Flowers, in which a “painter” snorts copious cocaine, spray-paints a multitude of colours on a canvas, rolls his girlfriend’s dog over the wet canvas, and then declared the finished work a masterpiece. Sure enough, after guaranteeing that the canvas was dripping and overflowing enough, Bogdanovic pressed his boy against the work-in-progress and revelled in the paint. He converted dripping paint into actually rather restrained smudges. He made a painting, and then took his art-work away with him. Off to the market, perhaps? Or at least to a dealer? I did wonder whether or not the artist would attempt to sell his latest painting.\n\nOctober 30, 2008\n\nElaine Wong:\n\nThe next performance of the night was Nenad Bogdanovic, who reversed the idea of gesture-as-image into image-as-gesture. Using a canvas suspended at its four corners by four volunteers, he began by painting the word 'NICER\" in bright colours, and then systematically destroyed the image in a series of actions that could have been sponsored by dentists around the world.\n\nAt first he ate an apple, then vigorously brushed his teeth, spitting out the water and foam onto the first letter of his painting, N. He repeated this cycle with each subsequent letter, eating a granola bar, then a banana, then drinking a bottle of Coke and finally smoking a cigarette -- normal actions undercut by absurdity as he continued to brush his teeth. The canvas became a receptacle for the various tastes and textures in his mouth, while the image displayed and maintained the motion that Bogdanovic imposed onto it: streaks implied the direction and force of his spitting, and the water pooled in the centre of the canvas, swirling colour together.\n\nFinally, to add to the controlled chaos of the image, he lay on the canvas and performed a series of push-ups in the sodden expanse of paint and water, further rendering the painting abstract and unrecognizable. The artist's intention behind the piece seemed to be twofold: a statement on how performance and art permeated even the most mundane aspects of his life, but also a willingness to sacrifice the sanctioned in a search for the meaning of art.\n\nOctober 30, 2008\n\nAlexandra Zierle and Paul Carter:\n\nThis diverse and charged festival of performance art drew to an end with Nenad Bogdanovic’s mesmerising durational performance Process. Set to a meditative backing track, dressed in black Nenad lay in the middle of the performance space beneath a suspended cheese cloth filled with fermenting cheese in it’s process of maturing and solidifying. Excess water from the straining process dripped through the cloth down onto Nenad’s naval, emphasing his subtle breathing movements, relaxed, but fragile, illustrating the nature of the human experience. Periodically he would stand and go to the corner to write a single letter on a piece of card and tape fasten it to the string holding the cloth. Starting from the top and one by one working his way down, each letter gradually unveiled the message. Keeping the audience in anticipation, the message eventually spelt out ‘Nature’. After the continued process of laying beneath the progressively slower drip for periods of time, Nenad began to fasten images of himself from different periods of his life. Starting chronologically from top as a young child he worked his way down the string to the last image, a photographic negative of himself standing in front of a church. Both sides of the string now presented a clear, simple yet powerful message, one that when united tells us of the process of life. It mirrors the process of nature, consisting of maturing and change, nurtured by the steady rhythm of the breath and perpetual drip, that ran it’s course. The performance ended with an act of painting in white the words ‘Perf’, short for performance, and ‘life’ vertically next to each other on to his shirt suggesting their equality.\n\nSeptember 11, 2009\n\n'I am a rich artist', New York (USA) 2005\n\n'Human Brain', Jerusalem, (Israel) 2007\n\n'Process', Odzaci (Serbia) 2009\n\n'Process', Lublin (Poland) 2010\n\n'Art = Life (Gamble)', Odzaci (Serbia) 2010\n\n'Mirroring (Self Portrait)', Venice (Italy) 2011\n\n'Mirroring (Self Portrait) II', Odzaci (Serbia) 2011\n\n'Problem HD_1' & 'Problem HD_2', Sète (France) 2011\n\n'Hard Line' performance with Monali Meher, Sète (France) 2011"
