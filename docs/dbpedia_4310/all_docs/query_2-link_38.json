Case number\n\n8 IT-03-68-T, the Prosecutor versus Naser Oric.\n\n9 JUDGE AGIUS: I thank you.\n\n10 Mr. Oric, good afternoon to you. Can you follow the proceedings\n\n11 in a language you can understand?\n\n12 THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Good afternoon, Your Honours, ladies\n\n13 and gentlemen. Yes, I can follow the proceedings.\n\n14 JUDGE AGIUS: Okay. I thank you. You may sit down.\n\n15 Appearances for the Prosecution.\n\n16 THE ACCUSED: [Interpretation] Thank you.\n\n17 MR. WUBBEN: Good afternoon, Your Honours, and good afternoon to\n\n18 members of the Defence team. My name is Jan Wubben, senior trial\n\n19 attorney, lead counsel for the Prosecution team, together with counsel\n\n20 Mr. Gramsci Di Fazio and our case manager, Ms. Donnica Henry-Frijlink.\n\n21 And I ask for allowance of special legal assistant at our desk to sit\n\n22 down, Mr. Marc Ellenbogen.\n\n23 JUDGE AGIUS: It is with pleasure that we say yes. Anyone who is\n\n24 young and wants to learn will always get the support of the Tribunal.\n\n25 Yes, appearances for Mr. Oric.\n\nPage 2175\n\n1 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Good afternoon, Your Honours. Good\n\n2 afternoon also to my colleagues from the OTP. My name is Vasvija Vidovic,\n\n3 together with Mr. John Jones, appearing here for Mr. Naser Oric. Joining\n\n4 us here today are also our legal assistant, Ms. Jasmina Cosic, as well as\n\n5 our case manager, Mr. Geoff Roberts.\n\n6 JUDGE AGIUS: All right. Let me start with some preliminaries\n\n7 myself.\n\n8 First of all, I should like to inform you, or confirm to you if\n\n9 you are informed already, that earlier on in the day, we handed down a\n\n10 decision, a written decision, on the Defence's urgent motion regarding\n\n11 late disclosure of evidence and to recall a witness, which motion was\n\n12 filed on the 18th of this -- November. As you may or may not know, we\n\n13 granted the motion. And on that score, I would enjoin the Prosecution to\n\n14 start the ball rolling to bring back Mr. Eric to continue with his\n\n15 testimony. That's number one.\n\n16 Number two is we have pending the Prosecution confidential motion\n\n17 for the admission of written statements of witnesses, pursuant to Rule 92\n\n18 bis (C), which was filed on the 27th of September, 2004. I am about, on\n\n19 behalf of the Trial Chamber, to pronounce an oral decision on this motion.\n\n20 Just for the record, I just want to remind that you the Trial Chamber has\n\n21 already ruled on this motion in relation to one of the persons mentioned\n\n22 therein, that is, Mr. Bogdanovic, while the request regarding the other\n\n23 person, Ms. Bozic, was withdrawn by the Prosecution. So the only person\n\n24 that remains to be dealt with is Mr. Bogdanovic.\n\n25 Before proceeding with the oral decision, I would point out to you\n\nPage 2176\n\n1 that while going through the documents, relevant documents, I noticed that\n\n2 there is, as yet, no official translation of the medical report of Dr.\n\n3 Ljubovic. If there is no objection forthcoming on the -- by -- on the\n\n4 part of the Defence, in other words, if you accept the summary that we\n\n5 were provided with the last -- one of the last sittings, then I will\n\n6 proceed with the oral decision. If not, obviously, we will have to\n\n7 postpone it.\n\n8 Yes, Madam Vidovic.\n\n9 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, we accept that.\n\n10 JUDGE AGIUS: Okay. I thank you.\n\n11 So basically at this point, I would like to give an oral decision.\n\n12 The Trial Chamber is now pronouncing itself on the admission -- on\n\n13 the request by the Prosecution for the admission into evidence of the\n\n14 written statement of Miladin Bogdanovic, pursuant to Rule 92 bis (C) of\n\n15 our Rules.\n\n16 For the record, it's to be noted that on the 27th of September,\n\n17 2004, the Prosecution filed a confidential motion for the admission of\n\n18 written statements of three witnesses, including that of Miladin\n\n19 Bogdanovic, pursuant to 92 bis (C) on the basis that he had been\n\n20 incapacitated by a stroke.\n\n21 On 30th September 2004, the Prosecution filed a motion and\n\n22 contended that the medical report by the Prosecution to establish that\n\n23 this witness was, by reason of bodily or mental condition, unable to\n\n24 testify orally, had not been translated, and that the interpretation\n\n25 provided by the Prosecution was incorrect. However, in its response, the\n\nPage 2177\n\n1 Defence did not challenge the admission into evidence the witness\n\n2 statement on the basis that the other requirements of Rule 92 bis were all\n\n3 fulfilled.\n\n4 Following an exchange of correspondence and communications between\n\n5 the parties, as well as upon the suggestion the Trial Chamber, the\n\n6 appointment of a medical expert, Dr. Senadin Ljubovic was agreed upon.\n\n7 Mr. Ljubovic conducted his examination on the 19th of November of this\n\n8 year, and concluded that Miladin Bogdanovic was not fit to give testimony\n\n9 in a trial and answer questions pertaining to events which occurred more\n\n10 than 10 years ago.\n\n11 The Trial Chamber is, therefore, satisfied on a balance of\n\n12 probabilities that Miladin Bogdanovic is unable to testify orally before\n\n13 the Tribunal by reason of his bodily and/or mental condition. The Trial\n\n14 Chamber is further satisfied that the subject matter of the statement of\n\n15 Miladin Bogdanovic, namely evidence relating to Jezestica prior to its\n\n16 attack on the 8th of August, 1992, and also on the 7th and 9th of January\n\n17 of the following year, 1993, is relevant pursuant -- is relevant to this\n\n18 case, pursuant to Rule 89(C).\n\n19 Finally, the Trial Chamber additionally considers that the\n\n20 statement of Bogdanovic goes to prove matter other than the acts and\n\n21 conduct of the accused as charged in the indictment. The Trial Chamber\n\n22 further considers that the ultimate probative value of the statement of\n\n23 Miladin Bogdanovic shall be assessed in the light of any existing evidence\n\n24 of cumulative nature, and with, obviously, due consideration to the fact\n\n25 that the Defence cannot cross-examine the evidence contained in the\n\nPage 2178\n\n1 witness statement.\n\n2 For the reasons set out above, but also for the non-objection on\n\n3 the part of the trial -- of the Defence, the Trial Chamber grants the\n\n4 Prosecution motion and admits the written statement of Miladin Bogdanovic\n\n5 into evidence, pursuant to Rule 92 bis (C). And that settles the matter.\n\n6 There is another matter that was -- my attention was drawn to\n\n7 immediately after the sitting, when Ms. Trifunovic gave evidence, and that\n\n8 is that at a certain point in time, we were confronting the witness her\n\n9 two statements: the one which was tendered into evidence by the Defence,\n\n10 I think it's marked D81 or 82; and the statement to the Prosecution, which\n\n11 goes back to 2001, I think, or 2003. The problem that I see is the\n\n12 following: That I don't think it helps at all the Trial Chamber to\n\n13 maintain a situation whereby the statement given to the Republika Srpska\n\n14 authorities is tendered and received in evidence, while the statement\n\n15 tendered or given to the Prosecution, which also contains her signature on\n\n16 which she was asked questions, is not tendered in evidence. So our\n\n17 suggestion is, unless you have got an objection, either yourselves or on\n\n18 the part of the Defence, to tender that document also in evidence.\n\n19 But - I'm making it very clear - only insofar as it relates to the\n\n20 signature of that witness. In other words, the document itself, the\n\n21 statement itself, will not in any way be used by the Trial Chamber in\n\n22 substitution of the oral testimony that she gave here. All right?\n\n23 Yes, Mr. Wubben.\n\n24 MR. WUBBEN: Your Honour, we have no objection. We will comply\n\n25 with that.\n\nPage 2179\n\n1 JUDGE AGIUS: All right. So that will be tendered in evidence\n\n2 with this caveat ...\n\n3 THE REGISTRAR: Your Honours --\n\n4 JUDGE AGIUS: That will be P?\n\n5 THE REGISTRAR: That will be ...\n\n6 JUDGE AGIUS: P, because it was tendered by the Prosecution.\n\n7 THE REGISTRAR: Your Honours, the exhibit number will be P418.\n\n8 JUDGE AGIUS: All right.\n\n9 MR. DI FAZIO: Do you actually have a physical copy of the\n\n10 statement? Otherwise, we'll undertake to provide one to the --\n\n11 JUDGE AGIUS: We have. Each one of us has a copy of that\n\n12 statement.\n\n13 MR. DI FAZIO: If there's any problem with the registrar not\n\n14 having a copy --\n\n15 JUDGE AGIUS: No, no, you can liaise with my secretary.\n\n16 Mr. Registrar, have my copy. It's not marked or anything. Do you\n\n17 have a copy yourself? Okay. We will have that admitted here. Show it --\n\n18 make sure that you show it to the Defence so that they are fully aware of\n\n19 which document we're talking about.\n\n20 So before I give you the floor, I was informed this morning by my\n\n21 senior legal officer, Mr. von Hebel, that he had in turn been informed\n\n22 that you may have a problem with this witness, and that she has forgotten\n\n23 her reading glasses. I think the problem goes beyond not having reading\n\n24 glasses.\n\n25 MR. WUBBEN: No, Your Honour --\n\nPage 2180\n\n1 JUDGE AGIUS: There is no problem?\n\n2 MR. WUBBEN: There had been a problem that she has, indeed,\n\n3 forgotten her glasses. I notified Defence counsel of it this morning and\n\n4 requested the Victims and Witness Unit to address with support. The\n\n5 Victims and Witness Unit confirmed that they have recently been able to\n\n6 solve the problem.\n\n7 JUDGE AGIUS: That's good.\n\n8 All right. Do you have any preliminaries, preliminary matters to\n\n9 raise? Yes, Mr. Wubben.\n\n10 MR. WUBBEN: It's not a big issue, it's a matter of\n\n11 professionalism, Your Honour. Yesterday evening, we received a list of\n\n12 exhibits, together with the ERN numbers, two of them without ERN numbers.\n\n13 And this afternoon, at around 1.00, I received an additional list without\n\n14 any notifying in advance, and I regret that it hadn't been announced that,\n\n15 all of a sudden, they send an additional list, just one or two hours in\n\n16 advance of the start of the trial. And that is not according to the\n\n17 practice of this Trial Chamber and the ruling in that regard. I regret\n\n18 that, Your Honour.\n\n19 JUDGE AGIUS: Yes, Madam Vidovic.\n\n20 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, as for professional\n\n21 standards, I will put it like this: Yesterday we spent the whole day with\n\n22 the OTP's case manager discussing the fact that we had the documents and\n\n23 that we would be forwarding a list of documents, including the ERN\n\n24 numbers. We pointed out, however, that it was essential for us to get the\n\n25 proofing notes in order to be able to put together a complete document.\n\nPage 2181\n\n1 We then agreed to forward a provisional list, which is what we did.\n\n2 Everything that we had received by 6.30 yesterday afternoon, including the\n\n3 proofing notes, we have since forwarded.\n\n4 Once we received the proofing notes, we saw that there were facts\n\n5 in it that required further examination on our part. We were put in a\n\n6 situation where we had to study the documents and work on their\n\n7 translations through the whole night. By the time we got back to the OTP,\n\n8 we had done whatever we could.\n\n9 One thing we have to understand is I have two assistants here\n\n10 working with me. My office is back in Sarajevo, and that is also where\n\n11 all of our documents are. I asked the OTP yesterday that such information\n\n12 be forwarded in a timely fashion in the future, because that very much\n\n13 conditions the kind of response that we can give.\n\n14 May it be understood that we have few assistants working with us,\n\n15 we have limited resources at our disposal, and I believe we have done the\n\n16 best we could. We have all spent a sleepless night to get this list\n\n17 ready; therefore, there can be no talk of professional standards here.\n\n18 Please try to understand my submission in this light.\n\n19 JUDGE AGIUS: It's not our intention, for sure, to escalate this\n\n20 into a major argument. Our recommendation is to try and cooperate with\n\n21 one another as much as you can so as to avoid these incidents being\n\n22 repeated. They are not conducive to the good environment, good and\n\n23 healthy environment that I spoke of in the very first day of this trial.\n\n24 There being nothing else, no further business to transact,\n\n25 let's -- yes.\n\nPage 2182\n\n1 Usher, you can bring the witness in, please. Thank you.\n\n2 [The witness entered court]\n\n3 JUDGE AGIUS: Good afternoon to you, madam.\n\n4 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Good afternoon.\n\n5 JUDGE AGIUS: I want to make sure that what I am saying in English\n\n6 is being interpreted to you in your own language. Are you receiving\n\n7 interpretation in your own language?\n\n8 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes. Yes.\n\n9 JUDGE AGIUS: You are about to give evidence in this trial against\n\n10 Naser Oric. Our Rules require that before you start giving evidence, you\n\n11 make a solemn declaration that, in the course of your testimony, you will\n\n12 be saying the truth, speaking the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\n\n13 the truth. I am going to read out the statement bit by bit, and I would\n\n14 like you to repeat this statement as soon and as you receive it from the\n\n15 interpreters. I'm going to start now.\n\n16 I, Slavka Matic.\n\n17 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I, Slavka Matic.\n\n18 JUDGE AGIUS: Solemnly declare.\n\n19 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Solemnly declare.\n\n20 JUDGE AGIUS: That I will speak the truth.\n\n21 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] That I will speak the truth.\n\n22 JUDGE AGIUS: The whole truth.\n\n23 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] The whole truth.\n\n24 JUDGE AGIUS: And nothing but the truth.\n\n25 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] And nothing but the truth.\n\nPage 2183\n\n1 JUDGE AGIUS: Madam, you can sit down. I would like to welcome\n\n2 you to this Tribunal.\n\n3 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you.\n\n4 JUDGE AGIUS: I am the presiding judge. My name is Carmel Agius,\n\n5 and I come from the island of Malta. To my right I have Judge Hans\n\n6 Hendrik Brydensholt, from Denmark, and to my left I have Judge Albin Eser\n\n7 from Germany. Together we form the Trial Chamber. And on above of the\n\n8 Trial Chamber, once more I welcome you.\n\n9 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you.\n\n10 JUDGE AGIUS: The procedure we follow is a simple one. The\n\n11 Prosecution, I think it will be Mr. Wubben, will start questioning you,\n\n12 and when he finishes with his series of questions, you will then be\n\n13 cross-examined by a member of the Defence team, which will be Madam\n\n14 Vidovic.\n\n15 Your obligation and your duty and responsibility in terms of the\n\n16 solemn declaration that you have made with us is that, in answering these\n\n17 questions, you will do your utmost to be truthful and complete in your\n\n18 answers without making a distinction as to who is putting the question to\n\n19 you. You have no right to discriminate, for example, in favour of the\n\n20 Prosecution, who has summoned you as its witness here, or discriminate\n\n21 against the Defence because you think you shouldn't testify in their\n\n22 favour. So basically your duty is to answer all questions truthfully and\n\n23 fully.\n\n24 Did I make myself understood?\n\n25 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.\n\nPage 2184\n\n1 JUDGE AGIUS: If at any time during your testimony you need you\n\n2 break, you feel tired, or you need some assistance, please draw my\n\n3 attention and we'll come forward and assist you immediately.\n\n4 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Thank you very much, Your Honour.\n\n5 MR. JONES: Your Honours, there's one preliminary matter, which is\n\n6 that we don't understand this witness to be illiterate. On the contrary,\n\n7 she's signed statements and has apparently attended elementary school.\n\n8 JUDGE AGIUS: I am informed that she is.\n\n9 MR. JONES: We would contest that.\n\n10 JUDGE AGIUS: I didn't want to raise the matter. But once you\n\n11 have raised the matter, I will raise it with her. But I am informed that\n\n12 she is.\n\n13 MR. JONES: If it could be clarified with her, and it's a matter\n\n14 we may raise in cross-examination.\n\n15 JUDGE AGIUS: Madam Matic, can you read and write?\n\n16 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No, I can't, because I was out of\n\n17 school in 1954. That was a long time ago. I lived in the country;\n\n18 therefore, I no longer pursued such activities. All I know is sometimes I\n\n19 can read some letters and I can sign things. That's all I know.\n\n20 JUDGE AGIUS: So you know how to sign your name, but you don't\n\n21 know how to read or write.\n\n22 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] My last name, yes, I can read it. I\n\n23 know the exact sequence of letters in my last name. If someone else puts\n\n24 their signature there, this is not something that I can read. I can only\n\n25 read my own last name. As for everything else, I really don't know much\n\nPage 2185\n\n1 about it, because I've never really had any need for that.\n\n2 JUDGE AGIUS: Okay.\n\n3 Are you happy with that, Mr. Jones?\n\n4 MR. JONES: It's a matter we may need to cross-examine her upon.\n\n5 For the moment, we can proceed.\n\n6 JUDGE AGIUS: All right. That's the situation as it was related\n\n7 to me before we started this sitting.\n\n8 So, Mr. Wubben.\n\n9 MR. WUBBEN: Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n10 WITNESS: SLAVKA MATIC\n\n11 [Witness answered through interpreter]\n\n12 Examined by Mr. Wubben:\n\n13 Q. Good afternoon, Ms. Slavka Matic.\n\n14 A. Good afternoon to you.\n\n15 Q. I will put forward questions to you related to the case you're\n\n16 about to testify. My first questions will focus on your personal\n\n17 background, and please answer with yes or no.\n\n18 Is your name Slavka Matic?\n\n19 A. Yes.\n\n20 Q. Were you born on the 13th of October, 1944?\n\n21 A. Yes.\n\n22 Q. Are you of Serb ethnic origin?\n\n23 A. Yes.\n\n24 Q. Is your occupation, your current occupation, a housewife?\n\n25 A. Yes. Nothing more than that.\n\nPage 2186\n\n1 Q. Let me go back with you to the events in 1992. That's 12 years\n\n2 ago from now on. Where did you live in 1992?\n\n3 A. In the village of Bjelice, Bjelovac municipality.\n\n4 Q. Is Bjelovac municipality in the municipality of Bratunac?\n\n5 A. Yes. Bratunac municipality is our main municipality.\n\n6 Q. You live there with your family?\n\n7 A. Yes.\n\n8 Q. You live there in your own house?\n\n9 A. Yes. I built a house in 1967.\n\n10 Q. Do you live there with your husband and two daughters?\n\n11 A. Yes.\n\n12 Q. Can you tell me the name of your daughters?\n\n13 A. Snezana Matic, born in 1965; that's my elder daughter. Gordana is\n\n14 the younger; she was born in 1967.\n\n15 Q. And the name of your husband?\n\n16 A. Radivoje Matic. His father's name was Ilija.\n\n17 Q. So you lived in Bjelovac, and Bjelovac had also surrounding\n\n18 hamlets.\n\n19 A. Yes. My husband lived in Sikiric. My married name was Sikiric.\n\n20 For four years I lived there. And after that, for four years, in 1967, I\n\n21 built a house in Bjelovac. I just crossed the river.\n\n22 Q. Is Bjelovac a Serbian city, a Serb-originated city, with a\n\n23 majority of Serbs in it?\n\n24 A. Yes.\n\n25 Q. And the hamlet you talked about, the hamlet of Sikiric, is that\n\nPage 2187\n\n1 also a Serb hamlet?\n\n2 A. Down there, as far as the places near Drina go, the majority\n\n3 population is Serb. But uphill there's a hamlet, Lanista Skela, these are\n\n4 populated by Muslims. There were no Serbs there. That's a place called\n\n5 Skela, near Sikirici, very close to it.\n\n6 Q. Now, in 1992, there had been an attack upon your village. Can you\n\n7 tell us of the date of that attack?\n\n8 A. The 14th of December.\n\n9 Q. Is that, to be precise, the 14th of December, 1992?\n\n10 A. Yes.\n\n11 Q. Prior to that attack, were there tensions between regions in -- as\n\n12 far as you know?\n\n13 A. There were tensions, yes, as the Muslims had left earlier on to\n\n14 the villages where the majority population was Muslim. And they fired\n\n15 shots nearly every day, so you couldn't move freely in your fields. So we\n\n16 worked just a little bit and then withdrew into shelters. And that's how\n\n17 we lived.\n\n18 Q. Had there been a kind of organising between villages or within\n\n19 villages or hamlets to a kind of army or a kind of defence or village\n\n20 guard, or none, as far as you know?\n\n21 A. There was a village guard organised in our village. They stood\n\n22 guard by night, securing the village, protecting it somehow. I wasn't\n\n23 there. From time to time, they went to stand guard. That was the village\n\n24 guard. There was no other guard.\n\n25 Q. And that village guard, that consisted of civilians or also\n\nPage 2188\n\n1 soldiers, like Serb soldiers?\n\n2 A. Only civilians.\n\n3 Q. And did it --\n\n4 A. We didn't have any sort of army. The men were simply civilians.\n\n5 Q. Did they wear any uniforms, these civilians?\n\n6 A. As far as I was able to see, I didn't see anyone in uniform. It\n\n7 may be that somebody had a uniform, but I didn't go there. I stayed at\n\n8 home with my children.\n\n9 Q. And did they have any arms, this village guard?\n\n10 A. Let me tell you, some may have had a hunting rifle from before;\n\n11 some had a pistol; some may have been reserve policemen. Or maybe they\n\n12 bought a weapon, I don't know. I can't know for sure.\n\n13 Q. To what extent were these village guards organised? I mean, had\n\n14 they been trained as a village guard? Did they exercise? Or can you tell\n\n15 us something about that, if you know?\n\n16 A. I wouldn't know. I can't say. My husband didn't participate in\n\n17 that sort of organisation. They simply called upon him in the evenings,\n\n18 when it was his turn to stand guard and protect the village. I don't know\n\n19 anything else about it.\n\n20 Q. Standing guard to protect the village, what does that mean? Can\n\n21 you tell us something about it?\n\n22 A. Well, what do I know? I don't know why this had to be done. I\n\n23 didn't know. I was surprised. I wondered what was going on and why.\n\n24 Q. The question now: Your husband, he participated in this village\n\n25 guard. Did he have any arms, as far as you know?\n\nPage 2189\n\n1 A. He didn't bring any weapons home. I don't remember seeing any\n\n2 weapons. My children were scared of weapons, and I wouldn't have allowed\n\n3 him to bring weapons into the house.\n\n4 Q. Well, to be complete, my question is: Did your children, your\n\n5 daughters, also participate in the village guard?\n\n6 A. No. No. At home -- they were at home in the evenings together\n\n7 with me.\n\n8 Q. And can you also confirm that there were not any weapons in the\n\n9 family house at the time of the attack, as far as you know?\n\n10 A. Yes. As far as I know, there were no weapons, and there couldn't\n\n11 have been any weapons in the house without my knowledge.\n\n12 Q. Now, you told the Judges the day of the attack was the 14th of\n\n13 December, 1992.\n\n14 A. Yes.\n\n15 Q. What time did this attack start?\n\n16 A. Let me tell you, I don't know exactly. I know that I got up at\n\n17 around 6.00, or a quarter past 6.00, and as I said, I was standing in for\n\n18 a woman in the direction of the school. It was still dark when the attack\n\n19 started.\n\n20 Q. You went in the direction of the school. Why did you -- did you\n\n21 have a job in the school? What did you do over there?\n\n22 A. I was standing in for a woman who asked me to clean the school\n\n23 because she was ill, and that morning I went there. I had done that on a\n\n24 few previous occasions, in the morning. On that day that woman was\n\n25 killed, that's when the misfortune happened.\n\nPage 2190\n\n1 Q. Another question about your job. Was cleaning the school the only\n\n2 activity you participated in at the school?\n\n3 A. Yes. I never participated in anything else, anywhere.\n\n4 Q. But I mean a job, an activity in the school, did you only clean\n\n5 the school, or did you also do another activity at the school?\n\n6 A. Later on, they brought things to the school, and I was there only\n\n7 from time to time. There were other women there who did that. They were\n\n8 distributing food for the village guards, because nobody was employed\n\n9 anywhere, nobody had work. So we had to eat, and somebody brought food in\n\n10 from Bratunac. But who it was, I don't know.\n\n11 Q. Again, about the starting date and time of the attack in question,\n\n12 so you went to that school with a view to do cleaning activities over\n\n13 there; is that true?\n\n14 A. Yes, that's true.\n\n15 Q. And what happened? How come you noticed that there was an attack\n\n16 going on?\n\n17 A. I set out in the direction of the school. It's about one\n\n18 kilometre, or 750 metres from my house to the school. When I was halfway\n\n19 to the school, shooting started from all sides. I didn't know what was\n\n20 going on, who was firing. I saw a man come out of a yard. I just saw the\n\n21 man walking in front of me. It was still dark. I recognised him and I\n\n22 called him by name. His name was Petko Dzokanovic. I said, What's this,\n\n23 Petko, is it an attack? And then he said, Well, it looks like it is. And\n\n24 then I wondered what to do. I didn't know whether I should go home or\n\n25 continue on my way. But I thought it wasn't anything really dangerous,\n\nPage 2191\n\n1 and so I went on to the school.\n\n2 When I reached the school, there were bullets firing at the\n\n3 school, the home, and there was a woman, as I said, at the school, her\n\n4 name was Nikolija Todorovic, and I said to her, Turn the lights out, and I\n\n5 she. She asked me what was going on, and I said there was an attack. And\n\n6 she said, What kind of attack? And I said, I don't know.\n\n7 Then I went to my nephew, Milisav, who lived 15 or 20 metres away\n\n8 from the school. I rang the bell and he came out and he said, What's\n\n9 going on, aunt? And I said to him, There's shooting from all sides. It\n\n10 looks like the Muslims are attacking us. And he was surprised. He ran\n\n11 out of the house.\n\n12 I went back to the school, and when I got there, I saw my brother\n\n13 Ilija, who was on his way towards the river Drina. I asked him where he\n\n14 was going, and he said he was going to accompany his son Milisav, because\n\n15 Cvetko had been wounded and they were going to take him there. I stayed\n\n16 there for awhile, and then my sister-in-law Sveta arrived. She was crying\n\n17 and shouting, They've killed Milisav and my son Stojan. In fact, Stojan\n\n18 survived but Milisav died. Stojan was only wounded.\n\n19 When I heard what had happened and that we were surrounded, and\n\n20 when I learned what was going on at the river Drina, I started going home.\n\n21 I couldn't get through. I followed the canal. I crawled, I crouched\n\n22 down, until I arrived at the house of Cvetko Lukic. And there I saw a man\n\n23 in front of Cvetko's house. There was a terrace there, and he was\n\n24 wounded --\n\n25 Q. Thank you, witness. Thank you, witness. So you decided to go\n\nPage 2192\n\n1 back, you decided to go back to your house, or did you go in another\n\n2 direction?\n\n3 A. I decided to go home, but I made a detour, because Cvetko's house\n\n4 and my house are about 300 metres apart, so I passed by Cvetko's house,\n\n5 intending to go back towards my own house.\n\n6 Q. Thank you, witness. My question is, then: What did you see at or\n\n7 near Cvetko's house? And what is the family name of Cvetko?\n\n8 A. Lukic. Cvetko Lukic.\n\n9 Q. So what did you notice there? What did you see upon arriving?\n\n10 A. I saw a man, as I said, who had been wounded. There was a rifle\n\n11 next to him; that was his rifle. Borka arrived. She raised her hand to\n\n12 show the direction from which they were shooting, and they wounded her. I\n\n13 don't remember whether it was her right arm or the left. But I retreated\n\n14 to the canal quickly, because Cvetko's house is some 15 metres away from\n\n15 the canal. I crawled back --\n\n16 Q. Thank you. Please, witness, I need to ask you to pay attention to\n\n17 the fact that I put forward a question to you, and please don't go too\n\n18 extensively in all the issues related to that question.\n\n19 A. Very well.\n\n20 Q. My question is: You noticed a person who had been wounded at\n\n21 Cvetko Lukic's house, and that there was a rifle. Can you tell something\n\n22 about that rifle, or did there happen anything to that rifle?\n\n23 A. It stayed there. It was probably his, because he was guarding the\n\n24 waterworks. But I don't know his name.\n\n25 Q. Now, did you notice where the shooting came from related to that\n\nPage 2193\n\n1 attack?\n\n2 A. I noticed that it came from the direction of the school towards my\n\n3 house. On the right-hand side, there's a stream there, a creek, and from\n\n4 there, there was heavy shooting. And I retreated to some blocks. There\n\n5 was a woman standing there. She asked me where I was going, and I said I\n\n6 wanted to go home in order to see what was happening to my family. And\n\n7 she replied, You can't pass through. At Nikola's house, look there. So I\n\n8 looked there, and Nikola's house was on fire. And there were two men\n\n9 standing at one corner and two on the other. I couldn't recognise them --\n\n10 Q. Witness, witness, again, one moment, please. My question was:\n\n11 Did you notice any attackers? Now, do I see it correctly that at that\n\n12 time, when you left the house where you saw the wounded person with the\n\n13 rifle, that you at that time didn't see any persons you linked to the\n\n14 attack?\n\n15 A. Yes, I did. I saw two at Nikola's house. That's what I said. I\n\n16 saw two at Nikola's house, with yellow ribbons on their heads. It wasn't\n\n17 our men, it wasn't Serbs. It was the Muslims, it was their army, Naser\n\n18 Oric's army. Who else would it belong to?\n\n19 Q. One moment, witness. Can you tell me more about those two persons\n\n20 you saw? Were these persons soldiers, these persons with yellow ribbons\n\n21 on their heads, or other --\n\n22 A. They had weapons in their hands; they had backpacks on their\n\n23 backs. They were probably soldiers. They had rifles. It was very dark,\n\n24 really, and I couldn't really see their clothes very well. The fog was\n\n25 very thick.\n\nPage 2194\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 2195\n\n1 Q. But you noticed, indeed, that there were ribbons on their\n\n2 forehead?\n\n3 A. Yes.\n\n4 Q. And you noticed the colour of that ribbon?\n\n5 A. I think it was yellow. That's what I thought it was.\n\n6 Q. And you noticed also whether or not they wore uniforms or typical\n\n7 clothes?\n\n8 A. Let me tell you, their clothes were grey, but I couldn't make out\n\n9 whether it was a camouflage kind of clothing. It seemed to be military,\n\n10 the kind of clothing that individuals wore.\n\n11 Q. And why did you think these were Muslims, that it was their army?\n\n12 A. I didn't think, I knew exactly. Because Nikola's house was on\n\n13 fire. It wouldn't have been Serbs that would have set fire to Nikola's\n\n14 house.\n\n15 Q. How did you know that these Muslims, armed men, set fire on\n\n16 Nikola's house?\n\n17 A. Who else would it have been? I heard across the stream, on my\n\n18 right-hand side, in the direction of my house, Berzadic Hajrudin yelling\n\n19 out, Surrender Chetniks, we'll catch you all alive. I heard him well. I\n\n20 understood what he was saying. I recognised his voice because he was a\n\n21 neighbour of mine. He lived a little way away from my house.\n\n22 Q. Can you please spell out the name of that person that you\n\n23 mentioned?\n\n24 A. Berzadic Hajrudin.\n\n25 Q. Now, how do you know a person like that?\n\nPage 2196\n\n1 A. Well, we used to socialise for quite a long time. We were\n\n2 delegates in the local commune, so we knew each other quite well. We\n\n3 would have conversations. We would chat.\n\n4 Q. And how did you recognise him? Was it his face, his --\n\n5 A. By his voice.\n\n6 Q. And --\n\n7 JUDGE AGIUS: One moment, Mr. Wubben, sorry to interrupt you. We\n\n8 need to clear it now. Did she say Hajrudin Berzadic or Berzadic?\n\n9 MR. WUBBEN:\n\n10 Q. Can you please answer that question?\n\n11 JUDGE AGIUS: Berzadic or Begzadic?\n\n12 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Berzadic.\n\n13 JUDGE AGIUS: Berzadic, okay.\n\n14 Yes, Mr. Wubben, please. Sorry to interrupt you, but I think it\n\n15 was important at this stage, because we avoided three or more questions on\n\n16 that, like that.\n\n17 MR. WUBBEN: No problem.\n\n18 Q. So you recall after, it's now 12 years, what this person was\n\n19 yelling?\n\n20 JUDGE AGIUS: Do you expect her not to, Mr. Wubben?\n\n21 A. Let me tell you, let me tell you, these big tragedies that\n\n22 happened, they're hard to forget, although later on there is trauma. But\n\n23 a lot of time has gone by, and during that time I would recall the names,\n\n24 the attack. I've lived there for 41 years. I knew people of both ethnic\n\n25 groups; I knew them well.\n\nPage 2197\n\n1 MR. WUBBEN:\n\n2 Q. And did you recognise other persons being -- participating in the\n\n3 attack by this Muslim army?\n\n4 A. I couldn't recognise them because they were 40 or 50 metres away\n\n5 from me. But let me tell you, it was quite dark. It was foggy, very\n\n6 foggy. I saw a few small groups of people, but I couldn't recognise any\n\n7 of them, so I wouldn't be able to tell you their names.\n\n8 Q. But you, indeed, confirmed that it was the army of Naser Oric.\n\n9 What did you make to think that or to conclude that?\n\n10 MR. JONES: I wonder if Mr. Wubben means affirmed. \"Confirmed,\" I\n\n11 don't know what the witness is confirming. It's a small point, but we\n\n12 certainly don't want it to be suggested that she's confirming some other\n\n13 statement --\n\n14 JUDGE AGIUS: I will rephrase the question myself for you,\n\n15 Mr. Wubben, if you don't mind.\n\n16 Earlier on you mentioned Naser's army, Naser Oric's army.\n\n17 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes.\n\n18 JUDGE AGIUS: How can you be so sure about that, and how do you\n\n19 know about Naser Oric's army?\n\n20 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I don't think anything else but that\n\n21 he was in command, he commanded it. Although I haven't stated that\n\n22 previously, sometimes from the woods above our village, they would\n\n23 threaten us, only we didn't believe them. They would say that their\n\n24 commander, Naser Oric, would arrive on a white horse. I didn't believe it\n\n25 until it all happened. And there was a young man called Slobodan Petrovic\n\nPage 2198\n\n1 who was taken prisoner; he was 16 or 17 years old, I can't be sure. And\n\n2 after there was an exchange, there was some sort of an exchange, and he\n\n3 was exchanged, and he told us that he had seen a Naser Oric there. And\n\n4 that was the name that they used to refer to him.\n\n5 JUDGE AGIUS: All right. But you didn't see Naser Oric himself on\n\n6 the day of the attack, did you?\n\n7 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No. No, never. I didn't even know\n\n8 him. I didn't see him on that day. I don't want to do anything -- to say\n\n9 anything wrong, but I don't know, maybe somebody else can prove this, but\n\n10 I can't.\n\n11 JUDGE AGIUS: I thank you, madam.\n\n12 Mr. Wubben, you may proceed.\n\n13 MR. WUBBEN:\n\n14 Q. This story about the Naser Oric army and Naser Oric in command,\n\n15 who did inform you of that? Was that friends, neighbours, or perhaps this\n\n16 Petrovic Slobodan, or someone else?\n\n17 A. That young man who lived across from my house, he had a brother.\n\n18 And when their village was burnt, he came and he was with us, until he was\n\n19 killed. He was killed in the attack, that young man, Slobodan.\n\n20 Q. Yes. Please continue. Did he inform you, or someone else?\n\n21 A. Well, stories went around, and it was he who informed us mostly.\n\n22 But otherwise it was others as well. But I don't know where they got the\n\n23 information. I don't know.\n\n24 JUDGE AGIUS: All right. Let's not waste more time on this,\n\n25 Mr. Wubben, because I imagine both you and Madam Vidovic know that whether\n\nPage 2199\n\n1 Oric was the commander or not will not result from the testimony of\n\n2 witnesses like the one we have now but from other sources, if at all.\n\n3 So let's proceed to something else, please.\n\n4 MR. WUBBEN: Yes, I will, Your Honour.\n\n5 Q. Did you also notice, when you saw these groups of attackers, that\n\n6 there was a kind of communication between those men, those attackers?\n\n7 JUDGE AGIUS: You can ask a direct question; I would allow it.\n\n8 Did you hear them communicating with each other?\n\n9 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No, I didn't hear them. No.\n\n10 MR. WUBBEN:\n\n11 Q. You were a witness of something you considered as an attack. Who,\n\n12 as you did notice, who did the attackers fight against? Where did they\n\n13 shoot at? Did they shoot at people, at the houses? Can you tell us\n\n14 something about what you saw and heard?\n\n15 A. They shot at everything, at whatever they could. Let me tell you,\n\n16 that day - I find this very difficult - 68 people were killed in my area.\n\n17 They killed my two daughters at my doorstep, and they killed my husband,\n\n18 too. I found out on that very day about my two daughters having been\n\n19 killed, and my husband, too. I saw the body of my husband, I identified\n\n20 it, but not my daughters because they were outside the house and I was not\n\n21 able to reach them. I saw Bozo with my own eyes. He had been killed in\n\n22 his summer kitchen. He was lying on his back. I also saw Milun Ilic. He\n\n23 was right behind my house. I was not able to identify his body, but I did\n\n24 the next day, at 1500 hours, when we collected the bodies. I also saw\n\n25 Radovan Vucetic --\n\nPage 2200\n\n1 Q. Thank you, witness. I would like to proceed by taking you back in\n\n2 time, starting from that place, that house of Cvetko Lukic. From there\n\n3 you proceed on -- going in the direction of your house, and there you\n\n4 learned whatever was this person identified by you, shouting. What did\n\n5 you come across? Did you see there any attackers? Were they shooting,\n\n6 and who were they attacking, if so?\n\n7 A. Well, I told you who they were attacking. Of course they were\n\n8 shooting. I couldn't get out of the ditch. Whenever they saw someone,\n\n9 they would shoot at them, no matter who. Whether it was a man or a woman.\n\n10 Whoever tried to cross the street was shot at, that's who they were\n\n11 attacking. I didn't precisely ask them why they were there, what they\n\n12 were doing, or whom they were attacking.\n\n13 Q. Can you tell us, what was the response by the villagers? Was\n\n14 there any response, if so, and meaning was there any defence of the\n\n15 village or the area against this attack?\n\n16 A. Well, let me tell you, I never saw one of our men shoot back.\n\n17 There were sounds of rifles being fired, but that was a river valley;\n\n18 there's the river to the left of my house and the woods to the right. I\n\n19 can't really say who was doing the shooting. There was sounds of shooting\n\n20 resonating. I only saw that man next to Cvetko's house. He had been\n\n21 wounded. I don't know what his name was, but I know that he was the\n\n22 keeper of the waterworks. On my way back home, way back from Cvetko's\n\n23 house, that was what I saw. As for those of our men who had survived, I\n\n24 thought that they had all been killed. That's what I thought at the time.\n\n25 Q. Did you also witness that attackers were shooting at men, women,\n\nPage 2201\n\n1 whatever, who were on the field or somewhere?\n\n2 A. Well, like I said a while ago, whoever left their homes didn't\n\n3 make it. They would just turn their rifles on them and shoot them. There\n\n4 is a borderline near the Drina river. That's where they were. There's a\n\n5 huge borderline running between the two fields. And whoever they saw\n\n6 crossing the road or moving about, they killed them.\n\n7 Q. Did you notice that there had been goods taken out of the houses,\n\n8 if so?\n\n9 A. I was not able to see that, because mainly, on that day, they were\n\n10 torching things. When they reached the houses, maybe they would enter\n\n11 some of the houses, but this is not something that I was able to see. I\n\n12 only saw smoke rising from the houses. Because I was in a column, I\n\n13 couldn't see them take anything out of the houses. I wasn't near enough\n\n14 to see it. I only saw the smoke rising from the burning houses, but I\n\n15 didn't see the people who were actually doing the looting, although I bet\n\n16 there were some of those there, too.\n\n17 Q. I'll come back to that issue later. But you also stated that they\n\n18 were torching houses or things. What do you mean by that? What did you\n\n19 make -- what makes you think that they were making -- they were burning or\n\n20 whatever?\n\n21 A. Well, it's not that I thought something. I only saw smoke rising\n\n22 from those houses who I was familiar with, and I knew who the houses\n\n23 belonged to. This is something I saw with my own eyes. I can't tell you\n\n24 who was doing the torching, but it certainly wasn't the Serbs. That's all\n\n25 I can tell you.\n\nPage 2202\n\n1 Q. Why was it certain that it wasn't the Serbs?\n\n2 A. On that day, the Serbs were defending rather than attacking each\n\n3 other. They stood up to defend their village, and that's why so many of\n\n4 them were killed. There weren't sufficient people there to put up an\n\n5 adequate defence.\n\n6 Q. Did you actually see houses burning in the hamlet of Sikiric at\n\n7 the time of the attack?\n\n8 A. Yes. Yes, I did. That could have been sometime about -- I can't\n\n9 give you the exact time. It may have been at 9.00 or 10.00. Smoke\n\n10 descended over the whole village of Sikirici. This is something that I'm\n\n11 certain about because I saw it with my own eyes.\n\n12 Q. And you know the hamlet of Sikiric well?\n\n13 A. Of course I do. I spent four years there; I lived there with my\n\n14 husband. As I said, back in 1967, I built a house in Bjelovac, or in\n\n15 1966. But in 1963, I got married in Sikirici and lived there. I knew all\n\n16 of the inhabitants. My husband's family lived there.\n\n17 JUDGE AGIUS: Okay.\n\n18 MR. WUBBEN:\n\n19 Q. You've already confirmed that, but can you, because of that\n\n20 knowledge, also identify the houses that were burning at the time of the\n\n21 attack?\n\n22 A. Yes.\n\n23 Q. Are you able to give us the names of the people or the family who\n\n24 owned those houses that were burning at that time?\n\n25 A. Yes.\n\nPage 2203\n\n1 Q. Will you please tell us those names, and please be specific and\n\n2 not too quick in pronouncing the name.\n\n3 A. The houses that were torched: Desimir Matic, my husband's\n\n4 brother; Mirko Matic; Vidoje Ilic. Let me think. Ljubisav Nedeljkovic,\n\n5 Ratko Nedeljkovic. They were both killed on that day, Ljubica and Ratko,\n\n6 Ratko's son. Ljubica's sister, Jevrenja [phoen]. They were all aged over\n\n7 60. Nedeljkovic, let me think. Mladen Nedeljkovic. Milomir was also\n\n8 killed on that day. All of their houses were ablaze. I remember that\n\n9 well. Milomir Tanasic, who was also killed on that day too, and his house\n\n10 too was on fire. Grozda Simic was also killed on that day, and her house\n\n11 burned down. Zlatan Simic was killed; that's Grozda's son, also on that\n\n12 same day. And that's when all of these things burned down and all these\n\n13 people were killed.\n\n14 Q. If you give you another thought to take your time to recollect and\n\n15 recall your memory of the houses burning in Sikiric, can you come up with\n\n16 other names as well?\n\n17 JUDGE AGIUS: You can help her, Mr. Wubben, please.\n\n18 A. Should I continue with the houses that were burning?\n\n19 JUDGE AGIUS: Yes, please.\n\n20 MR. WUBBEN:\n\n21 Q. Yes, please, the houses in Sikiric.\n\n22 A. Well, in Sikiric, there's also something that I forgot about.\n\n23 Pero Petrovic, or Petar, whatever his name is, but I know the man well,\n\n24 his house too was ablaze. All the houses in Sikiric had been torched, all\n\n25 the Serb houses. The Muslim houses still stand; they were never set\n\nPage 2204\n\n1 alight. There are people living there, whether refugees or whoever.\n\n2 Q. So you noticed that all the houses were torched except for the\n\n3 houses belonging to the Muslims.\n\n4 A. Yes.\n\n5 Q. And including all those houses that were burning -- excuse me,\n\n6 witness, I will put forward the question to you, and then repeat.\n\n7 Including all those houses that were burned, was there also\n\n8 the house of a family called Tanasic?\n\n9 A. Yes.\n\n10 Q. What was the full name of that --\n\n11 A. Milomir Tanasic.\n\n12 Q. And a family name like Mitrovic?\n\n13 A. Yes.\n\n14 Q. Can you give me the full name? And if there are more houses with\n\n15 same family name, can you specify also?\n\n16 A. Milomir Tanasic; Mitrovic Rado; Mitrovic Cvetko, all of them\n\n17 killed on that day. Mitrovic Veso, he's still alive; he wasn't killed.\n\n18 Mitrovic Miko, that's what his name was. But I'm not sure what his real\n\n19 name was, but his last name was Mitrovic and we called him Miko.\n\n20 Q. Was there also a house of Mitrovic, with full name Veselin?\n\n21 A. Yes. That's two adjacent houses. There were three brothers.\n\n22 They had houses that were adjacent.\n\n23 Q. And a house belonging to a family with the name Rankic? And if\n\n24 so, can you give the full name?\n\n25 A. There were no Rankics in Sikiric, but rather, Dusan Prodanovic, is\n\nPage 2205\n\n1 a person I forgot all about yesterday, but today I remember both his first\n\n2 and last name, and his house too was torched on that day.\n\n3 Q. And to finalise the house related to the name Kuca?\n\n4 A. As I said, the name of that man was Dusan Prodanovic, but he was\n\n5 killed.\n\n6 Q. Was Sikiric then burned down that day except for those houses that\n\n7 I referred to as Muslim houses?\n\n8 A. Yes.\n\n9 JUDGE AGIUS: Can you repeat your question, Mr. Wubben, please?\n\n10 MR. WUBBEN:\n\n11 Q. Was Sikiric then burned down that day except from those houses\n\n12 that I referred to as Muslim houses?\n\n13 A. Yes.\n\n14 Q. You can answer. Now, these houses were burning -- you noticed\n\n15 that these houses were burning at the time of the attack. Did you also\n\n16 notice houses burning in the area of your own family house, in Bjelovac?\n\n17 JUDGE AGIUS: If it's convenient for you to stop here for the\n\n18 break, before you start something new, we'll stop here. If this is a\n\n19 short question, you may proceed. It's up to you, Mr. Wubben. I don't\n\n20 know what you have in mind.\n\n21 MR. WUBBEN: I prefer to take up again this question.\n\n22 JUDGE AGIUS: Okay. So we'll have a 25-minute break, then,\n\n23 please. Thank you.\n\n24 --- Recess taken at 3.45 p.m.\n\n25 --- On resuming at 4.20 p.m.\n\nPage 2206\n\n1 JUDGE AGIUS: Yes, Mr. Wubben.\n\n2 MR. WUBBEN: Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n3 JUDGE AGIUS: How much more do you reckon you have?\n\n4 MR. WUBBEN: Three-quarters of an hour.\n\n5 JUDGE AGIUS: Please try to restrict your questions to what is\n\n6 relevant to the indictment, because we've spent the past hour and a half\n\n7 dealing with matters which could have easily been dealt with in four or\n\n8 five questions, relevant only to the indictment, and the rest is not\n\n9 really important. I mean, I'm just opening your eyes. I'm being very\n\n10 patient, so is Judge Brydensholt and Judge Eser, but we are missing the\n\n11 wood for the trees. Let's proceed.\n\n12 MR. WUBBEN: Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n13 Q. I am going back now to where we left before the break, Witness,\n\n14 and I have a question to you: How did you notice that Sikiric, during the\n\n15 day of the attack, had been burned down? Did you saw after the burning of\n\n16 the houses? Did you visit the hamlet, or did you saw it from a distance\n\n17 or not?\n\n18 A. I was watching from a distance of about 300 metres from the\n\n19 village of Sikirici. That's where I was standing. So I could see the\n\n20 houses burning. I knew where the individual houses were.\n\n21 Q. And can you continue, please? And what did you notice? Were\n\n22 there no flames anymore, and were the houses damaged or not?\n\n23 A. Yes, damaged, torched. There was still smoke rising from there.\n\n24 There was nobody to put the smoke out. That would have been impossible.\n\n25 Q. Now I would like to take you to the area of your own family house,\n\nPage 2207\n\n1 because you were going in that direction. And did you also notice in that\n\n2 area that houses were burning on the day of the attack?\n\n3 A. Yes.\n\n4 Q. Can you tell us the names of the families to whom those houses\n\n5 belonged to? I mean the names --\n\n6 JUDGE AGIUS: For example, is this important, Mr. Wubben?\n\n7 MR. WUBBEN: Yes.\n\n8 JUDGE AGIUS: Why is it important?\n\n9 MR. WUBBEN: It is important because she can, as living over there\n\n10 in that specific area, identify for Your Honours specific houses she can\n\n11 recall without showing me her a kind of photograph. It is a specific kind\n\n12 of identification and more specific when it comes to --\n\n13 JUDGE AGIUS: What do you intend to prove, that those particular\n\n14 houses were burned or that only houses belonging to Serbs were burned\n\n15 down?\n\n16 MR. WUBBEN: I want to prove both.\n\n17 JUDGE AGIUS: Go ahead.\n\n18 Yes, Mr. Jones?\n\n19 MR. JONES: May I just raise one matter, Your Honour, we have\n\n20 often in the English translation the word \"torched\" which might be taken\n\n21 to imply an act of human agency. I understand \"palenja\" the word in\n\n22 Bosnian can simply mean \"burnt,\" provided it is understood that \"torched\"\n\n23 means nothing more than burnt, that's --\n\n24 JUDGE AGIUS: That's how I'm taking it. Certainly not lit with a\n\n25 torch. I mean, it's -- definitely not.\n\nPage 2208\n\n1 Yes, Mr. Wubben.\n\n2 MR. WUBBEN: Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n3 Q. Can you please identify the names of the families, and, through\n\n4 that, the houses that were burning, as testified by you?\n\n5 A. In my village, you mean?\n\n6 Q. Yes, I mean in your village of Bjelovac.\n\n7 A. Radovan's house was burning, but I can't remember his last name.\n\n8 If I can have a minute, please.\n\n9 Yes, Radoje Lukic and Radovan Lukic, these are two brothers.\n\n10 Miodrag Nikolic's house; Drago Nikolic's house; Besimir Stojanovic's\n\n11 house. These houses are next to Jovanovici, because the next village is\n\n12 the -- the next family is the Jovanovics, as I said. Petar's house was on\n\n13 fire on that day; this is something that I saw with my own eyes. Milo\n\n14 Jovanovic's house was burning. Milos Jovanovic's house; Milos was killed.\n\n15 Dzoko was killed too. Milo's wife -- mother, Zlata Jovanovic, too, was\n\n16 killed, and his daughter, Radenka Jovanovic. Milo's brother, Milan, was\n\n17 also killed on that day. Milos Jovanovic's house was burning, and he too\n\n18 was killed on the same day. Svetozar Jovanovic's house was burning too.\n\n19 Milenko's house too, that's the son, and the mother; it's a house they\n\n20 shared. Their field was burning too. Veseljka Jovanovic's house was\n\n21 burning and it burnt down, and she was wounded on that day but she\n\n22 survived. Miodrag Petrovic's house too was burning. That's even closer\n\n23 to my house. And another house was burning, but the owner was not in the\n\n24 area; he had been living in Sweden, and he still lives there. Stevo\n\n25 Filipovic's house was on fire. He died that day. Dragoljub Filipovic's\n\nPage 2209\n\n1 house was burning. I saw flames rising from his house. Dragoljub was\n\n2 killed, as well as his son Dragan. And the house just in front of mine\n\n3 was burning too, at about 30 metres, Radovan Vucetic's house. He was also\n\n4 killed on that day. I saw him fall to the ground. I saw it with my own\n\n5 eyes. His son too was killed. His name was Milenko, and he was 17.\n\n6 Everything around my house was ablaze on that day, and they killed\n\n7 whoever they could.\n\n8 Should I continue?\n\n9 JUDGE AGIUS: Mr. Wubben, are you happy -- satisfied with the\n\n10 reply, or do you want more information?\n\n11 MR. WUBBEN: If she can identify more names of houses she saw.\n\n12 JUDGE AGIUS: You can help her.\n\n13 MR. WUBBEN: Yes.\n\n14 Q. Did you saw also the house of Vucetic Cvetar burning?\n\n15 A. Svetozar, yes, just across the away from our house. Further down\n\n16 the road, maybe 20 or 30 metres in front of my own house. Svetozar, yes,\n\n17 he too was killed.\n\n18 Q. And these were all houses burning during the attack in the area of\n\n19 where you lived?\n\n20 A. Yes.\n\n21 Q. Were there --\n\n22 A. Yes.\n\n23 Q. -- beside it, and then you don't have to be specific, also houses\n\n24 burning in Bjelovac?\n\n25 A. On that day, only Nikola Petrovic's house, I saw his house. But\n\nPage 2210\n\n1 I've already told you about that. On that day, I didn't see anything\n\n2 else. It was getting dark and there was no time, so they withdrew.\n\n3 Q. And were these houses, as a consequence of that burning, were\n\n4 these damaged or burned down, or not?\n\n5 A. Everyone had to build from scratch. Some walls needed repairing,\n\n6 everything that was necessary. That was the extent of the damage.\n\n7 Q. And did you saw any of those houses you mentioned in Bjelovac\n\n8 being set on fire during the attack?\n\n9 A. Yes.\n\n10 Q. Can you tell me --\n\n11 A. All the houses that I've mentioned, I saw all of those. I know\n\n12 exactly where each of the houses were. I had been living in the area for\n\n13 so many years, and I'd never been away from the area --\n\n14 Q. Please, Witness, I have a question. Did you actually saw one of\n\n15 those houses, or more, being set on fire during the attack by someone, or\n\n16 not?\n\n17 A. I didn't see who set fire to the houses, but I saw smoke rising.\n\n18 I can't identify the persons who physically set fire to the houses. I\n\n19 wasn't near enough to see for myself. It just wasn't possible.\n\n20 Q. And what did you notice when you get closer to your own family\n\n21 house?\n\n22 A. Smoke. A house that was near my house, Bozo Todorovic's house, as\n\n23 I was trying to cut across, I passed near that house. It may have been at\n\n24 3.00 or half past 3.00. Like I said, I saw flames rising from\n\n25 Dragoljub's house, from Stevo's house, there was smoke rising, Miodrag\n\nPage 2211\n\n1 Petrovic's house, smoke coming out. I saw all the Jovanovic's houses, and\n\n2 there was smoke coming out of each and every one of those houses, thick\n\n3 smoke.\n\n4 Q. My next question is: What did you notice -- what did you saw when\n\n5 you came very close to your own house? Because you were getting in the\n\n6 direction of your own house, as you told us.\n\n7 A. Yes. I saw bodies. I saw houses burning. When I reached Bozo\n\n8 Todorovic's house, the summer kitchen, I found him dead. I cried out to\n\n9 see whether there was anyone left alive. I think I stated that before. I\n\n10 saw another man whom I didn't know. He came out of a shed, a barn. He\n\n11 was wearing blue clothes with a backpack on his back, and a rifle in hand.\n\n12 He went behind the shed or the barn, and I was standing near Bozo's summer\n\n13 kitchen. I saw my husband at a corner of one of the other houses. I\n\n14 recognised his clothes. He wore a suit and a greyish jacket. There was a\n\n15 body there too, which I could not identify, but the next day, on the 15th,\n\n16 when I came over, I knew who the body belonged to. It was Milo Ilic's\n\n17 body.\n\n18 I started crying out near Bozo's house, Have you killed everyone?\n\n19 I screamed and I yelled. Something came flying and fell down near Bozo's\n\n20 house. It exploded. I didn't know what it was. I heard another man's\n\n21 voice from across the way from where I was standing, and he was shouting\n\n22 at me, Don't go there. It's not safe. I turned around, and it was Srecko\n\n23 Mihajlovic. He was standing near the ditch. I approached him, and I\n\n24 asked him what had happened to my family. He drew a deep sigh, and he\n\n25 replied, he said, All three of them have been killed.\n\nPage 2212\n\n1 This was a heavy blow for me. I had to cope with the shock. I\n\n2 felt like I was about to die. I tried to pull myself together. I really\n\n3 don't know how something like that could have happened. I asked him how\n\n4 he knew that all of them had been killed, and he said Bogdana was off to\n\n5 look for her husband, because he had left and went to my house, but he\n\n6 couldn't get there because they killed him. She was there with the\n\n7 children and knew that they had been killed. This is a tragedy.\n\n8 Until 1996, I was not able to recover. I didn't realise that I\n\n9 was the only one left in this world. I couldn't pull myself back\n\n10 together. I didn't know where to go or what to do. Then I went back home\n\n11 in 1996, on the 18th of May, and my life finally went back to normal. I\n\n12 had been a refugee and I had not been able to go back home.\n\n13 Q. Thank you, Witness.\n\n14 MR. WUBBEN: These were my questions, Your Honour.\n\n15 JUDGE AGIUS: Thank you, Mr. Wubben.\n\n16 Madam Vidovic.\n\n17 Cross-examined by Ms. Vidovic:\n\n18 Q. [Interpretation] Mrs. Matic, can you please try to provide brief\n\n19 answers to my questions.\n\n20 JUDGE AGIUS: Yes. And before we proceed, I would like to remind\n\n21 you, Madam Vidovic, and inform you, Madam Matic, that since you speak the\n\n22 same language, if you do not allow a small interval of time between\n\n23 question and answer, you will create a lot of confusion and a lot of\n\n24 difficulties for the interpreters. So my recommendation to you is to slow\n\n25 down and, between question and answer, allow a little bit of an interval.\n\nPage 2213\n\n1 Thank you.\n\n2 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n3 Q. Mrs. Matic, today, at the beginning of your testimony, you told us\n\n4 that you were illiterate.\n\n5 A. Yes. I said --\n\n6 Q. That's sufficient. Thank you. In your earlier statement to the\n\n7 Prosecutor, you said that you had completed four years of primary school;\n\n8 is that correct?\n\n9 A. Yes, in 1956 or 1954. I can't be sure. I think it's 1954.\n\n10 Q. Thank you. Is it not correct that at that time, as is the case\n\n11 today, children learned both scripts, Latin and Cyrillic, in the first\n\n12 grade of primary school?\n\n13 A. Yes, that's correct.\n\n14 Q. That's enough. Thank you. It is also correct that in the second\n\n15 grade of primary school, children learned to do sums and were instructed\n\n16 more broadly in our language, and in the third and fourth grade, they\n\n17 already wrote compositions.\n\n18 A. Yes. But it's been a long time since then, many years.\n\n19 Q. Thank you, madam. Thank you. It is also correct that in the\n\n20 school system which prevailed when you were attending school, in the first\n\n21 four grades, in the third grade of primary school, children learned about\n\n22 certain writers, certain authors, such as Branko Copic, and had to read\n\n23 books by them as set reading.\n\n24 A. Yes, that's true, but I've forgotten that, because I didn't renew\n\n25 that knowledge later on.\n\nPage 2214\n\n1 Q. It's correct, Mrs. Matic, is it not, that such things are not\n\n2 forgotten.\n\n3 A. Well, that's happened in my case. I can read, I can read, but\n\n4 only block capitals.\n\n5 Q. Thank you, Mrs. Matic. You also said that you were a housewife,\n\n6 but you also said that occasionally you worked at the school before the\n\n7 war. Did I understand you correctly?\n\n8 A. No. No, I was never employed. I never had a job. That might\n\n9 have been an error in interpretation. I was never employed anywhere. I\n\n10 was always a housewife.\n\n11 Q. Thank you. Today, at one point during your testimony, when\n\n12 speaking of Mr. Berzadic, you said, I know him well, together he was a\n\n13 delegate with me in the local commune.\n\n14 A. Yes, from time to time.\n\n15 Q. Thank you. Is it not true, Mrs. Matic, that when you were a\n\n16 delegate, you received various written materials so that you could inform\n\n17 the local population about them.\n\n18 A. No, never, never. I never received anything in writing. I was\n\n19 there on behalf of the women's anti-fascist club, and they kept me there\n\n20 only for the sake of my vote. And they only called upon me when there was\n\n21 some kind of meeting. But I never wrote anything or read anything there.\n\n22 That's the truth. When we had to vote for something, that's when they\n\n23 called upon me.\n\n24 Q. Very well, Mrs. Matic. I'll move on now to another topic.\n\n25 Before your testimony of today, the Prosecutor advised us that you\n\nPage 2215\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 2216\n\n1 had lost your reading glasses and the whole problem was solved when your\n\n2 glasses were found.\n\n3 A. I didn't lose them, I had forgotten them at home.\n\n4 Q. Thank you. Mrs. Matic, you are not illiterate, because otherwise\n\n5 you would not need the glasses, and you would have said so to the\n\n6 Prosecutor.\n\n7 A. I only use them to watch television. That's why I had the glasses\n\n8 made, so I could watch films on television. But I never managed to read\n\n9 the subtitles. There's not enough time.\n\n10 JUDGE AGIUS: Ms. Vidovic, where do you plan to end on this,\n\n11 because --\n\n12 MS. VIDOVIC: [In English] Very soon, very soon, Your Honour, if\n\n13 you'll allow me.\n\n14 JUDGE AGIUS: Because I don't see how it can change anything\n\n15 because she can, with a magnifying glass, read a couple of lines or a\n\n16 couple of sentences.\n\n17 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, this is not about the\n\n18 witness' glasses. Allow me to put a question.\n\n19 Q. Did the Prosecutor show you certain documents, referring to your\n\n20 previous testimony?\n\n21 A. You mean my statements?\n\n22 Q. Yes.\n\n23 A. Yes.\n\n24 Q. How could you comment on those statements if you are unable to\n\n25 read them?\n\nPage 2217\n\n1 A. Because this other lady who was there read them out to me. It\n\n2 wasn't me who read them.\n\n3 Q. Mrs. Matic, you decided to say you were illiterate when you saw\n\n4 the documents we intended to show you; isn't that so?\n\n5 A. No, that's not correct. I never decided to say that.\n\n6 Q. Thank you, Mrs. Matic. But in any case, you did say that you\n\n7 could read a few sentences that were typed.\n\n8 A. Yes.\n\n9 Q. Thank you, Mrs. Matic. Our documents are mostly written in such\n\n10 letters, so I will ask you to look at the documents anyway.\n\n11 A. Well, this is going to be difficult. I see that you don't trust\n\n12 me, you don't believe me, but you should. I haven't come here --\n\n13 JUDGE AGIUS: Mrs. Matic, the ones who will decide what will\n\n14 happen is us three up here and not Ms. -- not Madam Vidovic. So if you\n\n15 have problems, just look at me and I will consult with the other two\n\n16 Judges and we will decide what to do.\n\n17 Yes, move ahead, please, Madam Vidovic.\n\n18 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n19 Q. Mrs. Matic, I will now ask you something else. Today you told us\n\n20 that tragically you lost your husband and two daughters in the war.\n\n21 A. Yes.\n\n22 Q. It is also true that you yourself suffered certain consequences\n\n23 from shelling, and that you spent some time in a place near Vidakovica\n\n24 for recuperation.\n\n25 A. No, that's not correct. I was gathering hay in my field. They\n\nPage 2218\n\n1 were shooting, I don't know where from. This was before this attack. But\n\n2 I wasn't wounded, no, I wasn't there.\n\n3 Q. You were never in hospital?\n\n4 A. No, not for that reason.\n\n5 Q. Thank you, Mrs. Matic. In your statement which you made in 2000,\n\n6 and I hope you'll recall it, you said that in Bjelovac there were only\n\n7 four Muslim houses.\n\n8 A. Yes, four or five, but I think four, four families. After that\n\n9 they spread. But there were four families who were there. I can tell\n\n10 you there names --\n\n11 Q. I will put the questions, so please just answer. Bjelovac had\n\n12 about 290 inhabitants; isn't that correct?\n\n13 A. Well, I can't tell you precisely. It's possible.\n\n14 Q. Is it correct that in Bjelovac, in 1991, there were 59 Muslims?\n\n15 A. In Bjelovac?\n\n16 Q. Yes, in Bjelovac.\n\n17 A. No. I can --\n\n18 Q. Mrs. Matic, I will put the questions. Please allow me.\n\n19 A. Very well.\n\n20 Q. It's correct, is it not, that in the very center of Bjelovac,\n\n21 several hundred metres away from your house, there were several Muslim\n\n22 families living there. Do the names of Sinanovic Rahman, Sead Nedzad mean\n\n23 anything to you? They had houses next to houses of Serb families, Ilic\n\n24 and Dzokanovic?\n\n25 A. Sead, yes, but not Nedzad at that time. He was not living there\n\nPage 2219\n\n1 then. Not, it was only Sokla.\n\n2 Q. Sead and Rahman were?\n\n3 A. Yes. They were living there.\n\n4 Q. Thank you very much. Idud Basic Rifet [phoen] was a neighbour of\n\n5 yours, and he had a house in Bjelovac.\n\n6 A. Yes, that's close to the school.\n\n7 Q. Thank you. Juso Efendic had an old house and a new house in the\n\n8 center of Bjelovac, didn't he?\n\n9 A. Yes. Yes, he did. Well, very well. Maybe --\n\n10 Q. Please allow me, Mrs. Matic. Just a moment. It's also true, is\n\n11 it not, that Izet Osmanovic had a house near in the school in Bjelovac,\n\n12 and that in the very center there were also the houses of Alila Ajdar,\n\n13 Omer and Abid; isn't that so?\n\n14 A. They built houses there, but they didn't live there. They lived\n\n15 either in the same house, so it was one family.\n\n16 Q. Then there were seven houses belonging to the Efendic family,\n\n17 Muhamed Efendic and his brothers, and the house of Hajrudin Berzadic, whom\n\n18 you mentioned today which is very close to your house; isn't that correct?\n\n19 A. Yes. Berzadic, he lived there, yes. And as for the Efendics,\n\n20 those were only holiday homes. Jusuf Efendic's brother lived in\n\n21 Srebrenica. He had that house but he didn't live there.\n\n22 Q. Thank you. Also there were seven houses belonging to the\n\n23 Mujica --\n\n24 THE INTERPRETER: Could counsel please slow down. The interpreter\n\n25 cannot catch the names.\n\nPage 2220\n\n1 A. This was across the river. That was Zaluzje, that's on the other\n\n2 side from the river, because Bjelovac started at the river, on the\n\n3 riverbank, if you get my meaning. And across the river, yes, they were --\n\n4 well, they weren't Muslims. How shall I put it? We called them Gypsies,\n\n5 but they weren't Muslims.\n\n6 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n7 Q. Mrs. Matic, they were Muslims. Isn't it correct that the\n\n8 Mujanovic family of Nedza Faziariga [phoen] Mehmed and others, so on and\n\n9 so forth, isn't it true that Bjelovac, the center had 34 Muslim houses?\n\n10 A. Those houses belonged to Zaluzje. The houses you are mentioning\n\n11 with in Zaluzje. They were not in my village. We were separated by a\n\n12 river, do you understand, a river. Bjelovac started from the --\n\n13 Bjelovacka Rijeka to the Sikiricka Rijeka, those two rivers, and in\n\n14 between was my village.\n\n15 Q. Mrs. Matic, you will agree that in 1991 there was census?\n\n16 A. Yes, there was a census, of course there was. But I don't -- it\n\n17 wasn't me who conducted the census.\n\n18 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, I would be very happy\n\n19 to show the precise data from the census, but I'm not sure that -- I will\n\n20 stop here.\n\n21 JUDGE AGIUS: You don't need to, Madam Vidovic. You can just\n\n22 either suggest to her the exact figures and she will tell you whether she\n\n23 agrees or not. That's all. She doesn't need to see the document, unless\n\n24 you prefer to show the document to the Court, to the Trial Chamber, and to\n\n25 the Prosecution. That would suffice.\n\nPage 2221\n\n1 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Certainly.\n\n2 JUDGE AGIUS: I certainly wouldn't stop you from tendering the\n\n3 document into evidence. But you don't need it show you to the witness.\n\n4 And may I again remind you both, you and the witness, Mrs. Matic,\n\n5 please, again, slow down and allow an interval between question and\n\n6 answer, because you are creating problems.\n\n7 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, I move that the\n\n8 document entitled \"The Permanent Population of Bosnia-Herzegovina,\" the\n\n9 excerpt for Bratunac municipality showing the census of Bjelovac, not\n\n10 Zaluzje, that's separate, that it be tendered into evidence as a Defence\n\n11 exhibit. I believe we have already given a copy of this to the\n\n12 Prosecution.\n\n13 JUDGE AGIUS: Is there any objection on your part, Mr. Wubben?\n\n14 MR. WUBBEN: No objection, Your Honour.\n\n15 JUDGE AGIUS: Thank you.\n\n16 MR. WUBBEN: But I would like to have a copy.\n\n17 JUDGE AGIUS: So this document is being tendered in evidence and\n\n18 admitted and marked as Defence Exhibit D82. Thank you.\n\n19 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n20 Q. Mrs. Matic --\n\n21 JUDGE AGIUS: Perhaps you can help the Trial Chamber understand a\n\n22 little bit better, because this has happened in other instances as well.\n\n23 When we speak of Bjelovac, how many hamlets did Bjelovac have?\n\n24 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, on page 1 there is a\n\n25 list for Bratunac, and a list of villages. And when you turn the page,\n\nPage 2222\n\n1 under number 42 and 43, you will see the census, 290; 52 Muslims, and 231\n\n2 Serbs. And when you turn the page that we have produced here, you will\n\n3 see on page 74, the village Zaluzje that Mrs. Matic mentioned, it's a\n\n4 separate village; it had 214 inhabitants, and you can see how many were\n\n5 Serbs and how many Muslim. The population of Zaluzje was listed\n\n6 separately.\n\n7 JUDGE AGIUS: You've missed my point completely. During the\n\n8 testimony of previous witnesses, we have had this problem. Sometimes when\n\n9 you refer to, for example, the village of Bjelovac, the witness would\n\n10 understand the village itself; however, the village sometimes consists of\n\n11 various hamlets, and the population of one ethnicity or the other may vary\n\n12 according to whether the witness is considering the village itself, which\n\n13 is traditionally called Bjelovac, or whether it's also taking into account\n\n14 the surrounding hamlets.\n\n15 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, the census was carried\n\n16 out village by village. In this case, Bjelovac is a big village, and what\n\n17 this lady is talking about, the hamlets were not taken into account. If\n\n18 the state thought that the village did not have any hamlets, they weren't\n\n19 put there. However, Mrs. Matic is talking about the village of Zaluzje.\n\n20 That's something else. It can, by no means, be a hamlet of Bjelovac. And\n\n21 you will see this on page 74.\n\n22 JUDGE AGIUS: I don't think we're on the same wavelength. Let's\n\n23 proceed. Go ahead, Madam Vidovic.\n\n24 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] I understand, Your Honour.\n\n25 JUDGE ESER: Just a moment. You spoke of page 74. There are two\n\nPage 2223\n\n1 pages 74. Which page did you mean? The first is page 74, and then later\n\n2 on we have another page 74. What are you talking about?\n\n3 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] I am referring to the page which\n\n4 says \"The Permanent Population of Bosnia-Herzegovina,\" it starts with\n\n5 Voljavica -- and Voljavica, Branabici [phoen], Bratunac, Sikiric,\n\n6 Voljavica, Zaluzje, Zapolje. These are the villages we are talking about.\n\n7 Your Honour, let me just clarify one more point. If, then, the\n\n8 state organ conducting the census did not consider that the village had\n\n9 hamlets, they weren't included. So they thought that Bjelovac was a\n\n10 single village as such, with the number of inhabitants listed here.\n\n11 That's what we can say. Mrs. Matic is referring to Zaluzje, which is a\n\n12 different village, and had nothing to do with the population of Bjelovac.\n\n13 JUDGE AGIUS: Yes, Mrs. Matic, do you have any comments of your\n\n14 own on what has been exchanged between myself and Madam Vidovic.\n\n15 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] You know how it is. In the area\n\n16 where I live, there are two streams, two little rivers; one is called\n\n17 Loznicka Rijeka, separating Bjelovac and Sikiric; there is another little\n\n18 river going from Sase towards the Drina which separates Bjelovac from\n\n19 Zaluzje. I never even thought or knew that across the river that village\n\n20 of Vujanovici and so on. I knew the people there, of course. I\n\n21 socialised with them. I knew them all, but I never knew that they\n\n22 belonged to Bjelovac. I knew that.\n\n23 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n24 Q. Very well. Thank you, Mrs. Matic.\n\n25 A. They were called Loznicka Rijeka and Bjelovacka Rijeka, those two\n\nPage 2224\n\n1 rivers.\n\n2 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n3 Q. Mrs. Matic, thank you. Another question in relation to that. In\n\n4 your testimony you said that the Muslims had left Bjelovac in May 1992.\n\n5 You also said that they simply left, that no one caused unrest among them\n\n6 in any way; is that true?\n\n7 A. That's all I know. That's as much as I can say. There is nothing\n\n8 else that I know. I was not a member of any of the paramilitary units or\n\n9 anything. I didn't do anything like that.\n\n10 Q. Thank you very much, Mrs. Matic. The truth of the matter is that,\n\n11 from the beginning of April to mid-May 1992, they were being mistreated\n\n12 and harassed by their Serb neighbours from Bjelovac and Sikirici, isn't\n\n13 it? And by various paramilitary units entering Bjelovac.\n\n14 A. I don't know about that. I know that none of my family were ever\n\n15 mistreated. I don't know about the others.\n\n16 Q. Thank you very much, madam. If I'm asking in relation to you\n\n17 specifically, your family, please answer. But now I'm asking you about\n\n18 something else.\n\n19 A. And I'm telling you I don't know.\n\n20 Q. You know the Sinanovic families, don't you?\n\n21 A. Yes.\n\n22 Q. The distance between their houses and your house is several\n\n23 hundred metres, isn't it?\n\n24 A. About 300, yes.\n\n25 Q. Thank you. The truth is, you personally saw those people being\n\nPage 2225\n\n1 mistreated and thrown out of their houses, isn't it?\n\n2 A. No, I never saw anything like that.\n\n3 MR. WUBBEN: Your Honour, please, can Defence counsel give us some\n\n4 time frame? Are we talking now in 1992 or 1991, because first we were\n\n5 dealing with 1991.\n\n6 JUDGE AGIUS: Yes, yes, your question is perfectly in order,\n\n7 Mr. Wubben. Which time frame are you referring the witness to?\n\n8 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, a while ago I asked\n\n9 the following question: Between April and mid-May 1992 - that's how I\n\n10 phrased it - were Muslims in Bjelovac being mistreated throughout that\n\n11 period of time, so that's the period of time I'm now referring to. That\n\n12 much is clear.\n\n13 Q. Mrs. Matic, you also knew that your neighbour, Refud Dalibasic\n\n14 [phoen], had been beaten in Bjelovac and taken to the Vuk Karadzic\n\n15 elementary school in Bratunac, which was a notorious camp, where he was\n\n16 mistreated like many other Muslims from Bjelovac, Sikirici and the other\n\n17 villages.\n\n18 A. No. This is something I know nothing about. I never looked into\n\n19 that particular matter.\n\n20 Q. Thank you very much. Today you mentioned Sikiric, didn't you?\n\n21 A. Yes.\n\n22 Q. What is the distance between Sikiric and Bjelovac, in actual fact?\n\n23 A. From my house, you mean?\n\n24 Q. Yes, from your house.\n\n25 A. Between 250 and 300 metres. It's in the center of Sikiric, that's\n\nPage 2226\n\n1 where my house is.\n\n2 Q. Thank you very much. Well, then, you must know that there were\n\n3 240 Muslims living in Sikiric and 201 Serbs; is that correct?\n\n4 A. Well, there are hamlets there. Like I said, there is one called\n\n5 Skela that was predominantly Muslim. Not predominantly, 300.\n\n6 Q. Thank you very much. What is the distance between Skela and your\n\n7 house?\n\n8 A. In relation to Sikiric, you mean? It's part of the same village,\n\n9 but the name was Skela.\n\n10 Q. Thank you very much. Then it's true, isn't it, madam, that you\n\n11 could see people being killed and expelled, the 240 Muslims from Sikiric\n\n12 in April and May 1992.\n\n13 A. I know nothing about that. I didn't wish to see it, and I don't\n\n14 know about it.\n\n15 Q. Mrs. Matic, you described today how you saw smoke rising from the\n\n16 houses in Sikiric. Did you perhaps see this smoke rising also in April\n\n17 and May 1992 from Muslim houses?\n\n18 A. That's not when the flames were there. It was perhaps after the\n\n19 fall of Bjelovac, but this was something that I know nothing about.\n\n20 Q. Thank you very much. Are you aware of the fact that 11 of your\n\n21 neighbours from Skela, which you referred to, disappeared in the camp at\n\n22 Sase in April and May 1992?\n\n23 A. I know that people from both sides were lost or disappeared, but I\n\n24 don't know their names. It's not something that I spend a great deal of\n\n25 time thinking about.\n\nPage 2227\n\n1 Q. Mrs. Matic, let me put it this way: Is it true that all those\n\n2 Muslims were expelled, driven out, with nothing more than plastic bags in\n\n3 their hands in May 1992?\n\n4 A. Why are you asking me that, madam? I was not a military person.\n\n5 I was not interested in that. I had my own household to take care of. I\n\n6 had my own family.\n\n7 Q. Therefore, it's not true, what you said about the Muslims leaving\n\n8 peacefully. So that's the reason I'm asking you this. It's not true that\n\n9 they left their houses and homes peacefully in May 1992.\n\n10 A. Like I said, I don't know what the reason was for them leaving. I\n\n11 just wasn't there, and I didn't spend any time with those people. They\n\n12 passed my house on the way. Some of the women that I was in touch with on\n\n13 that day, they said they were scared. I had no idea what they were scared\n\n14 of. I can tell you what their names were. Zekira Efendic --\n\n15 Q. No need to do that, madam. You've provided the answer.\n\n16 Let me ask you something else now: You said you worked at the\n\n17 school on the 14th of December, 1992, and generally speaking throughout\n\n18 this entire period from the very beginning of the war. You had been\n\n19 working at the school; is that correct?\n\n20 A. No. I had just been standing in that day for a woman who had been\n\n21 killed on the 14th of December. I was never formally employed there.\n\n22 Q. Mrs. Matic, this is just not true, is it?\n\n23 A. On the contrary. All I'm telling you is the truth.\n\n24 Q. Mrs. Matic, in actual fact, you were a cook with the army of\n\n25 Republika Srpska from the very beginning of the war, and you were a\n\nPage 2228\n\n1 soldier with a Bjelovac Territorial Defence unit, part of which was\n\n2 billeted at the school; isn't that true?\n\n3 A. Well, on the day that I was there, some people came over\n\n4 occasionally, but on that day, there was no one there, because it couldn't\n\n5 have been the case that so many people were killed, if there had been a\n\n6 larger military presence there.\n\n7 Q. Mrs. Matic, this was a well-organised military unit, in fact,\n\n8 wasn't it?\n\n9 A. Which one?\n\n10 Q. The one at the school building.\n\n11 A. There was no one on that day. On the previous days, perhaps\n\n12 occasionally someone would come over, because of the waterworks, the\n\n13 pipeline, for the guards, the waterworks at Bjelovac that was supplying\n\n14 the whole Bratunac area, after all.\n\n15 Q. Thank you very much.\n\n16 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] I would like to have the usher's\n\n17 assistance now. I would like to place the a document of the Bratunac\n\n18 Brigade on the ELMO, personal income for June 1992. I hope that\n\n19 Mrs. Matic will recognise her own signature.\n\n20 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] Yes, I did work there occasionally.\n\n21 I'm not saying that I didn't. They did give us work every once in a\n\n22 while. We had nothing to live on. They paid us money.\n\n23 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n24 Q. Very well. Thank you, Mrs. Matic.\n\n25 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Can I have the usher's assistance,\n\nPage 2229\n\n1 please, to show page 01335443.\n\n2 Q. Mrs. Matic, I will tell you again the exact number. I'm not sure\n\n3 if you can read numbers. Maybe if you can put your glasses on. 69 --\n\n4 please, the number is 697. Can you please point to that number?\n\n5 JUDGE AGIUS: Just considering the problems of both the glasses\n\n6 and the relative illiteracy of the witness, what I suggest is that we put\n\n7 the document on the ELMO, and then on the second half of this document,\n\n8 there is the -- under 697, there is the witness's name, and, at the\n\n9 extreme right, what purports to be her signature. I would like the\n\n10 technicians to start with her name, the typed name, and move to the right,\n\n11 and then zoom in what appears to be her signature, if it is, and then you\n\n12 can obviously ask the questions.\n\n13 And, Madam Matic, you please look at not the document itself but\n\n14 at the monitor that you have in front of you.\n\n15 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n16 Q. Mrs. Matic, please, can you look at this. Right. First of all,\n\n17 is this your name on the list, Slavka Matic? The letter K, which might be\n\n18 the first letter of the word \"cook.\"\n\n19 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] And then please if you can lift the\n\n20 document up a little, the next thing -- can you please lift the document\n\n21 up.\n\n22 Q. Right here, the second from top, the signature, it appears quite\n\n23 clear on the screen. If you could please look at that signature.\n\n24 JUDGE AGIUS: Can we move it further to the left, please. Can we\n\n25 move it further to the left and -- to the left, to the left, because there\n\nPage 2230\n\n1 is the logo of the Tribunal which is in the way, and then zoom on it,\n\n2 please.\n\n3 Madam Matic, do you recognise your signature on the monitor?\n\n4 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] No.\n\n5 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Can I have the usher's assistance\n\n6 again. Next to this signature, can you please place the first version of\n\n7 the English statement of this witness.\n\n8 This is not her signature. Page 1 of the English version. Yes.\n\n9 Q. If you could please compare the two, this signature and the one in\n\n10 line 697. Very well. Mrs. Matic, what do you say now? Have you tried to\n\n11 focus on these two signatures? Can you tell us anything about these?\n\n12 A. That is my signature. It must be.\n\n13 Q. Thank you very much, Mrs. Matic.\n\n14 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Can we please give this document a\n\n15 number as a Defence exhibit, and if I can have the usher's assistance to\n\n16 place on the ELMO a different document, an excerpt from a document of the\n\n17 Bratunac Brigade.\n\n18 JUDGE AGIUS: Yes. This is being -- this document is being\n\n19 tendered and received in evidence and marked as Defence Exhibit D83.\n\n20 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Thank you.\n\n21 Q. Can you please place this document on the ELMO. It's a Bratunac\n\n22 Brigade number. The number is 00656816, and the title is \"List of\n\n23 Soldiers, Bjelovac Territorial Defence, 1st Platoon.\" This is from the\n\n24 financial documents in relation to August 1992.\n\n25 And if you can show Mrs. Matic the next page, if you can put it on\n\nPage 2231\n\n1 the ELMO, 00656817, 817 being the last three digits.\n\n2 Mrs. Matic, if you can have a look, please. Again, it reads in\n\n3 block capitals --\n\n4 A. You mean what's on the screen?\n\n5 Q. Yes.\n\n6 A. Yes, or rather no, or yes.\n\n7 Q. If you can just pull the document up a little.\n\n8 THE INTERPRETER: Could counsel please speak into the microphone.\n\n9 Q. Is it correct that under number 39, we see your name, Slavka\n\n10 Matic? And the column next to it says \"Cook.\"\n\n11 A. Well, let me explain this. This is maybe the document from the\n\n12 Bratunac Brigade, but over in our village there was no such thing as a\n\n13 brigade. There was this school, and we had the village guards. They were\n\n14 always there. We received food and distributed whatever food we received\n\n15 to them, to the village guards. I was there. It was not really a\n\n16 military thing. I knew nothing about the military. I'm not even\n\n17 literate. I can't even write. Maybe I shouldn't have signed this. How\n\n18 should I know?\n\n19 Q. Thank you, madam. Did you receive money for your work there?\n\n20 A. I think two or three salaries, something like that. I can't\n\n21 remember, but I reckoned it was for food, that sort of thing.\n\n22 Q. Thank you.\n\n23 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] May this document please be assigned\n\n24 a number as a Defence exhibit.\n\n25 JUDGE AGIUS: So this document is being tendered and received in\n\nPage 2232\n\n1 evidence and marked Defence Exhibit D84.\n\n2 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n3 Q. Mrs. Matic, I have a different question for you now. You stated\n\n4 that prior to what happened in December, there had been no organised armed\n\n5 and uniformed village guards in your village; is that true?\n\n6 A. No, not in my village. That's true. Back in my village -- maybe\n\n7 some people had some of those things. I don't know. I was not familiar\n\n8 with these things.\n\n9 Q. Thank you very much, Mrs. Matic. The truth is inside Bjelovac\n\n10 itself, the Bjelovac Territorial Defence unit had about 160 soldiers, did\n\n11 it not?\n\n12 A. Those were just villagers who were locals. There were quite a\n\n13 number of houses there with one man or two men inside each.\n\n14 Q. Did those men have weapons?\n\n15 A. Well, depending. Some had a rifle and some may have had a pistol;\n\n16 some may have been reserve officers of the local police so they were in\n\n17 possession of weapons.\n\n18 Q. You cooked for them. You should know those people. Isn't that\n\n19 right?\n\n20 A. Those were only locals, so yes, I did know them.\n\n21 Q. The truth is, you cooked for those people, didn't you?\n\n22 A. No, not cooked. We just distributed food, sometimes canned goods\n\n23 or dry food. I was not always there, because I had other things to do.\n\n24 But it was for money that I sometimes did it. That's just how things were\n\n25 at the time.\n\nPage 2233\n\n1 Q. Mrs. Matic, you know the inhabitants of Sase. Your husband worked\n\n2 there, didn't he?\n\n3 A. How should I have known them? He was the one who worked there,\n\n4 not myself. I know where Sase is. Maybe I did know a couple of people\n\n5 from Sase, but that's a far cry from saying I knew all of them.\n\n6 Q. Did you perhaps hear that Sase, which was a neighbouring village,\n\n7 had a Territorial Defence unit under the command of a volunteer from\n\n8 Serbia called Miroljub Todorovic?\n\n9 A. I'm not aware of that, really.\n\n10 Q. Mrs. Matic, in November 1992, your unit became part of the\n\n11 Bratunac Brigade, did it?\n\n12 A. I really don't know. I think you should ask someone who was in\n\n13 charge to explain this for you. I really don't know.\n\n14 Q. I'll put the question differently, I'll rephrase it. You worked\n\n15 in the command if that part of the brigade for Bjelovac.\n\n16 A. I didn't know it was the command. I dealt with the women. I\n\n17 communicated with the women, not with the men at all.\n\n18 Q. Are you trying to say that in that school, there were no soldiers;\n\n19 that this was not the command of part of the Bratunac Brigade considerably\n\n20 before the events in Bjelovac?\n\n21 A. Let me tell you - and I've already said this - occasionally a\n\n22 paramilitary unit did turn up. I didn't know what its name was.\n\n23 Q. Thank you. The school had an ammunition depot and a food storage\n\n24 area; isn't that so?\n\n25 A. I don't know about that. They did distribute some food there. I\n\nPage 2234\n\n1 don't know about weapons. I didn't have any weapons at all.\n\n2 Q. Mrs. Matic, would you now please look at another document.\n\n3 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] And I ask the usher to put on the\n\n4 ELMO document 01320546, entitled \"Payroll for November 1992,\n\n5 4th Battalion.\"\n\n6 Q. Please turn to page 2, ending -- that's the second page you have.\n\n7 The last number is 555. And then there is the number 373. Would you have\n\n8 a look there. It contains the name of Slavka Matic. 373. Would you\n\n9 please put the document on the ELMO.\n\n10 Very well, Mrs. Matic, do you agree that this is your name?\n\n11 A. Yes, I do. It's my first and last name.\n\n12 Q. Would you now please put on the ELMO again page 1, where it\n\n13 says \"payroll for November, 4th Battalion.\" If you can, would you please\n\n14 look at name number 1. It says Sreten Petrovic. Sreten Petrovic was the\n\n15 commander of that battalion, wasn't he? Do you know Mr. Sreten Petrovic?\n\n16 A. Yes, I do know him. But he didn't give me my salary personally.\n\n17 There were other people who did that.\n\n18 Q. Mrs. Matic, is it correct that he was the commander of that\n\n19 battalion?\n\n20 A. I don't know what his title was. He was probably a member of a\n\n21 military unit.\n\n22 Q. Thank you very much.\n\n23 A. But I don't know what its name was.\n\n24 Q. Would you please now look at the name Milanovic, Nenad Milanovic.\n\n25 Excuse me, Milovanovic, Nenad.\n\nPage 2235\n\n1 A. I don't know him.\n\n2 Q. Next to his name, I won't ask you anything about him, Mrs. Matic,\n\n3 but next to his name it says, \"commander of the mortar platoon.\"\n\n4 A. I really don't know that.\n\n5 Q. You were a cook. You came into contact with people.\n\n6 A. No, never. I never came into contact with people. I didn't have\n\n7 time to contact people. I had other things to do at home, at home.\n\n8 Q. Are you trying to say that you did not know that your battalion\n\n9 had a mortar platoon?\n\n10 A. No, it may have had. I don't know. But I didn't know about it.\n\n11 For example, they said to me, you have to come to the school, you have to\n\n12 help the other woman, the woman who was there with me. I stood in for\n\n13 that woman that was killed. I didn't know what was going to happen. But\n\n14 I am not sufficiently literate to follow everything that went on.\n\n15 Q. Mrs. Matic, I will ask you now, do you know Mr. Milan Bogdanovic?\n\n16 A. No, I don't, really, I don't.\n\n17 Q. He's the assistant commander for security.\n\n18 A. I really don't know him.\n\n19 Q. Very well.\n\n20 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] I tender this document and ask that\n\n21 it be given a number.\n\n22 JUDGE AGIUS: So this document is being tendered and received in\n\n23 evidence and marked as Defence Exhibit D85.\n\n24 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n25 Q. Mrs. Matic, I will now ask you about something you're probably\n\nPage 2236\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 2237\n\n1 more familiar with because you worked in the kitchen. Unfortunately,\n\n2 again, I have to show you a document.\n\n3 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] I ask the usher to put on the ELMO\n\n4 the excerpt from the financial documentation of the Bratunac Brigade,\n\n5 entitled \"List of Partners,\" and the number is 01320961. This document\n\n6 consists of several pages, and I ask Mrs. Matic first to look at page 1,\n\n7 entitled \"List of Partners.\"\n\n8 Q. Mrs. Matic, would you please take a look at this. This is a list\n\n9 of kitchens. This is something you should know about, isn't it? They\n\n10 mention, for example, the kitchen of Kaolin, the kitchen of Drina. Also\n\n11 the Bjelovac TO, the Red Berets kitchen, the Red Berets company.\n\n12 A. I don't know anything about the things on this list. I never had\n\n13 an argument with anyone, ever. I never knew what the name of each\n\n14 particular unit was or who was in charge of it.\n\n15 Q. But I will ask you about something that you can know something\n\n16 about, Mrs. Matic. Please, did you know about the existence of these\n\n17 units and their kitchens?\n\n18 A. No, I only knew about the kitchen in Bjelovac, and I thought that\n\n19 the kitchen was for our village, for our local commune, for our\n\n20 Territorial Defence. And that's why I agreed to help there.\n\n21 Q. Would you please now look at the documents referring to your\n\n22 kitchen of Bjelovac TO, and look at the quantities of food listed there.\n\n23 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Please put document 01320951 on\n\n24 the ELMO, or 013209 -- yes, you can put this one on the ELMO.\n\n25 Q. Would you please take a look. Look at the amounts of food\n\nPage 2238\n\n1 entering that kitchen.\n\n2 A. I don't see anything clearly. I see numbers here. I see there\n\n3 are zeros, but I cannot distinguish the numbers. I'm an elderly woman;\n\n4 I'm 60-something. I've gone through what I've gone through. I'm not\n\n5 interested in life, let alone anything else.\n\n6 Q. Mrs. Matic, my question is very simple: Do you agree that in the\n\n7 TO Bjelovac kitchen, large quantities of food came in, hundreds of\n\n8 kilogrammes of beans, potatoes --\n\n9 A. I don't know. I didn't keep the records. I don't know. I didn't\n\n10 take delivery of this, ever.\n\n11 Q. Yes, but you worked in the kitchen. Did you see large quantities\n\n12 of food?\n\n13 A. No. No. Only what they brought to us.\n\n14 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Your Honour, may this document be\n\n15 given a number, please.\n\n16 JUDGE AGIUS: Yes. It's being tendered and admitted in evidence\n\n17 and marked Defence Exhibit D86.\n\n18 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n19 Q. Mrs. Matic, now I will put some questions to you about the attack\n\n20 on the 14th of December, 1992. Mrs. Matic, you don't really know who\n\n21 started the shooting on the 14th of December, the Serbs or the Muslims, do\n\n22 you?\n\n23 A. No, I didn't know. I couldn't see, because they were shooting\n\n24 from all sides. But later on I learned about it.\n\n25 Q. Thank you. It's correct that in 1994, you gave a statement to the\n\nPage 2239\n\n1 investigating judge of the Zvornik court, Mr. Vaso Eric. It doesn't\n\n2 matter where in Zvornik or Bratunac, but is it correct that you made your\n\n3 statement in 1994?\n\n4 A. Not in Zvornik, but in Bratunac maybe. I tell you, because until\n\n5 1996 -- let me tell you something, I was beside myself.\n\n6 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Would the witness please look at\n\n7 this statement.\n\n8 Q. Mrs. Matic, please look at this. Mrs. Matic?\n\n9 A. I can't see to read this.\n\n10 Q. I'm not asking you to read this, Mrs. Matic. I will only ask you,\n\n11 are these your signatures? You can recognise your signature at the bottom\n\n12 of each page, can't you?\n\n13 A. Yes. Yes, I signed that.\n\n14 Q. Do you remember that you said to the investigating judge, and this\n\n15 is on page 2 of this statement, I quote: \"On the 14th of December, 1992,\n\n16 as usual, at 0615 hours, I started off for work at the primary school. On\n\n17 the way between the house and the school, I suddenly heard shooting coming\n\n18 from the direction of Loznicka Rijeka. I thought that our soldiers were\n\n19 shooting, as they always did, out of vigilance.\"\n\n20 A. Maybe I said this in my ignorance, but I don't know, because after\n\n21 my tragedy, they could have written down whatever they wanted. I was\n\n22 beside myself; I wasn't in my right mind.\n\n23 Q. I'll ask you something else. You said here that there were Serb\n\n24 soldiers in Bjelovac on the 14th of December, 1992, and even before that;\n\n25 isn't that correct?\n\nPage 2240\n\n1 A. I don't remember that.\n\n2 Q. And as I read out to you, you said that they frequently fired\n\n3 shots.\n\n4 A. Maybe I did say that, but I don't recall that. Whatever happened\n\n5 after 1992, between 1992 and 1996, whether I said something or not, I\n\n6 don't know. They could have written down anything they wanted to.\n\n7 Q. Mrs. Matic, it's true that they fired because they were setting\n\n8 ambushes for the Muslims who were trying to return to their houses, their\n\n9 fields, by night to take some food. They attacked Muslims.\n\n10 A. I don't know. I didn't.\n\n11 Q. Are you aware that the Serb army laid mines to kill Muslim\n\n12 civilians trying to get to this food?\n\n13 A. I don't know that. I didn't go there.\n\n14 Q. Mrs. Matic, you must have known about the existence of minefields.\n\n15 How else could you have moved around?\n\n16 A. I never went further than Loznicka Rijeka, toward the wood and the\n\n17 Drina and the school. I didn't go any further afield, ever.\n\n18 Q. Very well. Thank you, Mrs. Matic. On the 14th of December, 1992,\n\n19 what happened, in fact, was that there was a battle in which the Serbs\n\n20 also fired on the attackers.\n\n21 A. Well, there probably was a defence. If anyone had weapons, they\n\n22 defended themselves.\n\n23 Q. Thank you. But shots were fired in your house as well.\n\n24 A. I didn't know. I wasn't at home.\n\n25 Q. In your statement made in 2000, page 3 of the Bosnian version, and\n\nPage 2241\n\n1 it's also page 3 in the English version, the last paragraph, you said that\n\n2 Bogdana fired shots and wounded a Muslim soldier.\n\n3 A. Yes, that's what she told me. She said that.\n\n4 Q. Thank you. In your statement made to the Prosecutor in March\n\n5 2000, you also said, 0306283 in Bosnian, and 923 of the English version, I\n\n6 quote: \"I want to say that all the villagers who had weapons in their\n\n7 houses offered resistance.\"\n\n8 You said that to the investigators; is that correct?\n\n9 A. Well, probably, yes, those who had weapons. I didn't have any\n\n10 weapons. That's why I didn't resist; that's why my family was killed.\n\n11 Q. Mrs. Matic, please don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying that\n\n12 you had weapons or fired shots. I was asking you something else.\n\n13 A. Well, probably whoever had weapons probably resisted.\n\n14 Q. You said: \"I want to say that all the villagers who had weapons\n\n15 in their houses offered resistance.\"\n\n16 Is this correct?\n\n17 A. Well, of course. If it says that, then that's probably what I\n\n18 said. But I don't remember that, really.\n\n19 Q. Mrs. Matic, it's correct, in fact, that on that day, bullets and\n\n20 shells were flying in all directions.\n\n21 A. While you could hear shooting, I didn't see where they were\n\n22 shooting from, or what they were targeting. But I know that they were\n\n23 shooting at me, too, while I was in the canal.\n\n24 Q. Thank you. Your husband was also a fighter of the Bjelovac\n\n25 Territorial Defence.\n\nPage 2242\n\n1 A. He may have been, but I never saw a rifle. He never brought one\n\n2 home, because my girls were afraid of weapons.\n\n3 Q. So you will agree with me that he was a fighter?\n\n4 A. Probably. If everybody was mobilised, then of course he couldn't\n\n5 not be a fighter. But let me tell you something, and that's what I said,\n\n6 his right arm was not well. He had had five operations.\n\n7 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Military post 7042 of Bratunac,\n\n8 could you put that document on the ELMO, please. The title is \"List of\n\n9 Fighters of the 1st Bratunac Brigade Killed on the 18th of April, 1992 to\n\n10 the 25th of September, 1995.\"\n\n11 Q. Please look at page 300661859.\n\n12 A. I can't see --\n\n13 Q. Please put it on the ELMO and focus on number 260, \"Matic, son of\n\n14 Ilija, Radivoje, killed in battle on the 14th of December, 1992.\" Is that\n\n15 correct?\n\n16 A. Yes. Fighting in front of his house, on the threshold of his\n\n17 house, without anything, on the threshold of my own house. On the\n\n18 threshold of my house, my daughter Snezana was killed --\n\n19 Q. Mrs. Matic, we'll come to that.\n\n20 A. Very well.\n\n21 Q. Would you please now turn to the next page of the document and\n\n22 look at the person listed under number 318, if you can. Could you focus\n\n23 on this, please. Could you zoom in on it. Savica Ostoja Mitar, from\n\n24 Bratunac. This is a well-known photographer from Bratunac, isn't is that\n\n25 so?\n\nPage 2243\n\n1 A. Yes.\n\n2 Q. You kept telling us that it was only local villagers who were\n\n3 fighting there.\n\n4 A. Yes.\n\n5 Q. Isn't it correct that Mr. Mitar was killed on the 14th of\n\n6 December, 1992, fighting in your area?\n\n7 A. Not in my village.\n\n8 Q. In Kunarac?\n\n9 A. Well, that's one of the neighbouring villages.\n\n10 Q. So what is the distance between Kunarac and your house?\n\n11 A. From my house to Kunarac, perhaps two and a half to three\n\n12 kilometres, thereabouts.\n\n13 Q. Very well. Thank you. Mrs. Matic, you are aware that people from\n\n14 a number of different areas, including Bratunac, were in fact fighting in\n\n15 this area, not only people from Bjelovac.\n\n16 A. Not on that day. Where I was, no, there wasn't anyone.\n\n17 Q. Thank you very much. As for the attackers, you said you didn't\n\n18 know who they were.\n\n19 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation] Prior to that, Your Honours, can\n\n20 this document please be assigned a document as a Defence exhibit.\n\n21 JUDGE AGIUS: Yes. This document is being tendered and received\n\n22 in evidence and marked as Defence Exhibit D86. 87? 87, sorry.\n\n23 MS. VIDOVIC: [Interpretation]\n\n24 Q. You said you didn't know who their commander was.\n\n25 A. Not at the time, but I found out later.\n\nPage 2244\n\n1 Q. We'll come to that. The only people you've been able to identify\n\n2 or recognise today have been people from your neighbourhood, weren't they?\n\n3 A. I'm afraid I don't understand.\n\n4 Q. The people you have referred to today as recognising them during\n\n5 the attack were people from your neighbourhood, weren't they?\n\n6 A. I only recognised them -- I saw that there were some persons, but\n\n7 I didn't identify them. Hajrudin Berzadic was the only person I\n\n8 recognised.\n\n9 Q. That is precisely the kind of question I'm putting to you, and\n\n10 Hajrudin Berzadic is the person I had in mind. You knew hi"
