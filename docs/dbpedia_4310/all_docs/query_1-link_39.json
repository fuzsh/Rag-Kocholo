Our Actions help connect research initiatives across Europe and enable scientists to grow their ideas by sharing them with their peers. This boosts their research, career and innovation.\n\nGeriatric Medicine (GM), which is the field of medicine that is concerned with the health and well-being of older adults, can play a crucial role in the alignment of health systems to the needs of the constantly growing older populations. However, countries have varying GM development backgrounds."
