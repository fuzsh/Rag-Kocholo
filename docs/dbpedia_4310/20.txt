NENAD BOGDANOVIĆ

Mayor of the City of Belgrade

Born on May 12, 1954. After graduating from the Secondary School of Mathematics, he entered the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and graduated in 1978, and won his master’s degree three years later.

For two decades now, he has been engaged in telecommunications, first on research and development and, later on, on managerial jobs as well, first in "Pupin", and then in other companies engaged in this field. In 1989, he was appointed Director of the joint venture of Messrs. GTE Telecommunications and EI Pupin. Two years later, he became the Commercial Manager and, as of 1996, he has been the General Manager of the mixed company "Alkatel Pupin Jugoslavija".

As of 1992, a member of the Democratic Party (DP), which elected him the Chairman of Zemun Board as early as 1993, thereafter the Vice Chairman of the City Board and the commissioner for Belgrade. Currently, he is an MP in the National Parliament of Serbia.

The difficult and responsible function of the premier in the new City government could not leave him out after the September elections. First, as the Chairman of the Election Board of DOS in Belgrade, he made this coalition score a convincing victory at the city level. Thereafter, as the Manager of the Crisis Center of the City, "he successfully pulled the strings of the anarchic post-revolutionary Belgrade", as it was noted in the first biographical newspaper article after his election.

He learnt the ropes of city management in the past three years as a vice chairman of the expert "Government for Belgrade" of DP and Civic Alliance of Serbia. His friends and associates, but his political adversaries as well, describe him as a prudent, controlled, very accurate, and very energetic man.

A father of two.
