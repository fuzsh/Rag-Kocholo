        "text": "Well, the ferry boats between Vancouver and Vancouver Island are powered by natural gas and not by the winds – but nevertheless they speak of sailing between mainland and island. There are different routes but the most important ones seem to be the one going from Tsawwassen south of Vancouver to Swartz Bay (for visiting Victoria) and the one from Departure Bay (a well chosen name) near Nanaimo to Horseshoe Bay; the perfect arrival point for a trip through the Sea-to-Sky community via Squamish up to Whistler.\n\nContinue reading “Sailing”\n\nI’m just a tiny little bit afraid of heights, but the Capilano suspension bridge is a place to challenge me. It is located in North Vancouver and spans the Capilano river at a height of 70 meters while being 136 meters long. Dependent on who is joining you on the bridge, this can be fun or nightmare. What you might not suspect is that this bridge has a history and was first built in 1888 to access a hut on the other side.\n\nContinue reading “Capilano”\n\nSince 1975 the city of Vancouver has a nice botanical garden in Shaughnessy, south of downtown. It is a beautiful garden with fantastic flowers, rivers, lakes and an Elizabethan maze to get lost in. The garden doesn’t do scientific research, it just exhibits plants in differently themed areas. There is a stone garden, a vegetable garden, giant sequoias, sino-himalayan plants and areas for the flora of Chile, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In one section you’ll find collections of azaleas, rhododendrons and camellias; in another firs, maples, conifers, lindens, cypresses and cedars can be found.\n\nContinue reading “VanDusen”\n\nWelcome to the oldest museum of Canada, dating back to 1894. The current building was designed in New Formalism style by architect Gerald Hamilton and I quite like this special architecture that looks like a crossover of an UFO and a circus tent. The museum itself focusses on the past, present and future of the city of Vancouver and the selection of topics is pretty broad: for example they connect the topic of empty publicly owned residential buildings at Taiwan with Vancouver, asking where the residents see vacancy in their city.\n\nContinue reading “Civic museum”\n\nThe city of Vancouver is located on the traditional land of the First Nations called xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish) and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh). Getting onto their unceded land is a very good reason to learn more about their traditions and the best place for that is the Museum of Anthropology quite a bit afar from downtown. It is part of the University of British Columbia (UBC) and located at their campus just a 20 minutes ride by car west along the coast.\n\nContinue reading “First Nations”\n\nNorth of Downtown Vancouver you’ll find Stanley Park which is a recreational zone on a half-peninsula named after conservative politician Frederick Arthur Stanley who was Governor General of Canada when it opened as a park in 1888. Stanley Park today has a large forest, contains the Vancouver Aquarium and offers long bicycle routes along the shore (‘seawall‘) giving you great views on the city center and the aeroboat harbor.\n\nContinue reading “Stanley Park”\n\nVancouver is a city at the Pacific Ocean and for sure you would want to know a bit about sea life. For that reason there’s the amazing Vancouver Aquarium located within Stanley Park. The Vanaqua is the largest marine science center at Canada and was opened in 1956. Today there are 300 species of fish that you can admire, but to me the real stars are the local corals on display that have been beautifully set in scene.\n\nContinue reading “Coral paradise”\n\nCurrency of Canada is of course the Canadian Dollar (CAD, $ or C$). It is divided into 100 Cents and exists since 1871 when it became the first uniform currency for all Canadian provinces. There are coins for one and two dollars, as well as cent coins mostly showing wildlife of Canada. The banknotes from five to 100 $ currently show Canadian innovations from elements of the ISS and trains to insulin. The issue is that you’ll probably won’t get to see them as Canada has gone cashless nearly everywhere.\n\nContinue reading “CAD”\n\nUnderneath the Granville Bridge you’ll find Granville Island, a half-peninsula within the False Creek. It is an artificial island created to host industry and it was converted in the 1970s and attracts many visitors these days. Highlight is the Granville Island Public Market that sells gourmet food which gives you the chance to try a lot of different local produce. It is surrounded by bars and restaurants and you can conveniently sit at the shore of the False Creek and enjoy views on the sea arm.\n\nContinue reading “Granville Island”\n\nPublic transport at Vancouver relies on the fantastic automated SkyTrain flying through the city as well as busses. But the most lovely means of transport is for sure the Aquabus: little boats operated by just one person each touring clockwise on the False Creek. Just jump on board, tell the operator how far you want to go and buy a ticket from them via credit card directly while floating on the water. Perfect for a round course with beautiful views or to access some nice places across the city.\n\nContinue reading “Aquabus”"
