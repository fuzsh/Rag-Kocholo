        "text": "The Vennbahn between Aachen and Troisvierges in the north of Luxembourg, with the unique Hochmoor Hohes Venn in between, is Europe's 125 kilometers longest Bahntrassenradweg. It symbolizes a moving piece of Europe: originally a link between coal mining in the north and steel huts in the south, then artery in the conflict zone of two world wars, then forgotten, until today to fill the cross-border region with life. Cross-border in the truest sense of the word, because the cycle path changes more than twelve times between Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. Various nature forms the way, from the Monschau Heckenland and the heather landscape in the High Venn over the original Ourtal to the gardens around Troisvierges."
