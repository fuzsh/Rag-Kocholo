        "text": "In his 1678 trea­tise, The Vis­i­ble World, Samuel van Hoogstrat­en wrote: ​“It is there­fore very use­ful and nec­es­sary to start early doing much draw­ing after life. And even though the schools with nude ses­sions are not always avail­able, there is no lack of sub­ject mat­ter.” 1\n\nAfter com­plet­ing his train­ing, Van Hoogstrat­en, like many artists, con­tin­ued to draw stud­ies from life as a reg­u­lar prac­tice to keep his skills honed. Here, he cap­tured work­ing-class fig­ures going about their busi­ness in the streets around him. Though the three full-length fig­ures appear to have been drawn sep­a­rate­ly, he placed them in rel­a­tive dimin­ish­ing scale on the sheet. This arrange­ment cre­ates a mise-en-page sug­ges­tive of a cohe­sive com­po­si­tion (per­haps reflex­ive­ly) despite the fig­ures’ obvi­ous men­tal and con­cep­tu­al iso­la­tion from each other.\n\nThe Peck draw­ing is one of a num­ber of such stud­ies to sur­vive that must have belonged to one of Van Hoogstraten’s sketch­books.2\n\nOth­ers have like­wise been trimmed from a larg­er sheet, evi­dent here by the head study on the left edge that has been cut through the mid­dle. Judg­ing from the prove­nance, this prob­a­bly occurred some­time in the nine­teenth cen­tu­ry. Two relat­ed sheets in the École des Beaux-Arts, like­wise cropped, bear close styl­is­tic sim­i­lar­i­ties to the present draw­ing Fig. 23.1,Fig. 23.2.3\n\nCon­sen­sus that Van Hoogstrat­en was the author of these three works was only achieved after a num­ber of alter­na­tive artists had been sug­gest­ed, though schol­ars have long looked among mem­bers of Rembrandt’s cir­cle. In the nine­teenth cen­tu­ry, the Peck draw­ing was thought pos­si­bly to have been the work of Ger­brand van den Eeck­hout (1621 – 1674).4\n\nEduard Trautscholdt reject­ed this attri­bu­tion in 1968 and gave it to Bar­ent Fab­ri­tius (1624 – 1673), with the sug­ges­tion that it might also be by Van Hoogstrat­en.5\n\nThe lat­ter attri­bu­tion was adopt­ed by Wern­er Sumows­ki, who pub­lished it with a group of other sim­i­lar fig­ure study sketch­es by Van Hoogstrat­en in his cor­pus of draw­ings by the artist.6\n\nSumows­ki had attrib­uted the two relat­ed draw­ings in the École des Beaux-Arts, by con­trast, to Nico­laes Maes.7\n\nMore recent­ly, Peter Schat­born right­ly argued for Van Hoogstraten’s author­ship for those as well, based on a com­par­i­son of more round­ed forms of the fig­ures than in Maes’s sketch­es (which tend to be more angu­lar) and the small zones of hatch­ing that one finds in some of his other signed or secure­ly attrib­uted draw­ings.8\n\nSome affin­i­ty between Van Hoogstraten’s and Maes’s works is not entire­ly sur­pris­ing since both artists hailed from Dor­drecht and had stud­ied with Rem­brandt in the 1640s.9"
