        "text": "Biography\n\nOriginally intending to work behind the scenes as a songwriter and a producer, Cheng did odd jobs at his father (Director of EMI Asia)’s company EMI— which included doing backing vocalist for the likes of Alan Tam and Priscilla Chan — during summers as a youth. The lessons were apparently effective, as producers started taking notice of Cheng’s voice and he was signed to a recording contract soon thereafter. Cheng first shot to popularity in Taiwan before returning home and enjoying some success in Hong Kong. However, his singing career went into a lull from 2000 to 2003 due to the infamous “air rage incident” and has only recently rebounded.\n\nCheng returned to the Cantopop market in 2003, however success for him did not arrive until 2005, where his signature song \"無賴\" (Rascal) was voted one of the Top 10 songs at various music award shows, notably TVB's Jade Solid Gold, where it was voted the most popular song of 2005.\n\nCheng won his first Best Supporting Actor award for his performance in Vulgaria (film) at the 32nd Hong Kong Film Award.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHis father, Norman Cheng (鄭東漢), is the chairperson and CEO of EMI, and formerly of the Asia Pacific division of PolyGram and then Universal Music.\n\nRonald Cheng started his relationship with Charlene Choi, a popular Hong Kong female singer and actress, in 2004, after starring as lovers in the film Hidden Heroes. In 2010, while Choi announced ending the relationship with Cheng, the press revealed that they had registered their marriage in Los Angeles, United States in 2006. Both Cheng and Choi recognized the marriage, but decided to divorce. Later, he dated with Sammie Yu, a former hostess in Cable TV Hong Kong and Sammie Yu gave birth to a daughter. They married in July 2011.\n\nDiscography\n\n1996\n\n左右為難 (In A Dilemma) - Mandarin Album\n\n別愛我 (Don't Love Me) - Mandarin Album\n\n1997\n\n情深 (Deep Love) - Cantonese Album\n\n最愛的人不是你 (You Are Not My Dearest Lover) - Mandarin EP\n\n絕口不提！愛你 (Don't Say!
