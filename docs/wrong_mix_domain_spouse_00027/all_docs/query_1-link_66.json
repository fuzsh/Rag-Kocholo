Recent focus has been on autophagy and mitophagy pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein ubiquitination, mechanisms of proteinopathy accumulation (Ab, tau, TDP-43 & synuclein), and synaptic plasticity regulation via multiple signaling pathways. These pathways include the FTLD-ALS associated mitochondrial protein CHCHD10, cytoskeletal signaling via SSH1-cofilin, the scaffolding proteins RanBP9 and b-arrestins, and deubiqutinases (DUBs).

We made the initial discovery that proximal tubule cell apoptosis leads to tubular atrophy, which strongly predicts CKD progression. We have continued to build on that theme, with many publications that characterize the cellular pathways that impact on tubular epithelial cell survival, most recently the role of filtered fatty acid uptake by fatty acid transporter‐2 (FATP2) in proximal tubule glucolipotoxicity. We are actively pursuing projects which explore the pathophysiology of FATP2‐ mediated cytotoxicity, as well as the development of FATP2 inhibitors as a potential treatment for diabetes and diabetic kidney disease.
