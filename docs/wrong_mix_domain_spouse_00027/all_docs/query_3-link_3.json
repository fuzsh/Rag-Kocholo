        "text": "12 Sep â€“ The wife of Ronald Cheng, news anchor Sammie Yu made her first public appearance yesterday speaking to Hong Kong reporters on her child and also a possible wedding banquet, according to a report by Xin MSN.\n\nWhen reporters asked if they were planning to hold a wedding banquet after getting married just last July at their home, she replied, \"I hope my daughter could be a part of the event, so let's wait until she learns how to walk.\"\n\nSammie also shared that she hopes to do her best in taking care of daughter, however, the former news anchor did not rule out the possibility of returning to work and said that should opportunities come along, Ronald would support her.\n\nMentioning Ronald's statements, where he expressed to have another child by next year, Sammie laughed and said, \"He prefers daughters, so I'm not pressured anymore. I personally feel that having two kids is okay.\"\n\nPreviously it was rumoured that due to Ronald's failed marriage with singer Charlene Choi, he had asked Sammie to sign a prenuptial agreement to protect his assets.\n\nResponding on the matter, Sammie explained, \"I don't know why there's such a rumour. I don't think he's haunted by his previous marriage and I don't know who the house belongs to. I have never been there.\""
