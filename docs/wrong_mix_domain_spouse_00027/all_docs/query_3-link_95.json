        "text": "From Michael Adduci, brother\n\n\"Kathy was supposed to get married and the date was set for June 2 of that year, but it was called off. To take her mind off the wedding, my mom talked her into going to Hawaii with two other friends. They were Gail DeCastro and Rhonda DeYoung, who also perished. We ended up in church on the 2nd of June for Kathy -- for her funeral.\n\nShe was a sweet and beautiful sister who had many friends. She was studying to be a nurse at South Suburban College at the time of the accident and needed a break from school and the heartbreak of the wedding being called off. I remember she had just bought a new Pontiac Firebird and I went with her to sign the papers and bring it home. She was so proud of it.\n\nThe devastation of the accident affected my family way beyond 1979. My mom was in remission from breast cancer and three months after the accident her cancer came back and she passed away in 1981. My father was heartbroken over losing two loved ones and committed suicide in 1997.\n\nWhat I didn't realize until the (memorial's) dedication was there were families there who lost up to five family members at once. Now, that's devastation, isn't it?\"\n\nFrom Michael Bean, son\n\n\"My mother and father had retired to Aiea on Oahu in Hawaii. My mother worked in the officer's club on the Air Force base there. She had served in the Air Force during the Korean War. My parents loved Hawaii after being stationed there twice.\n\nShe was in Vermont to visit my family and myself, but I was not there at the time since I took a job as a roadie for the band Bad Company several weeks earlier.\n\nWe didn't know she was on that flight because she was flying standby and got her seat at the last minute. We had no clue where she was when she didn't arrive in Honolulu. I was 24 years old at the time.\n\nYears later in Vermont, I became friends with a woman who also was in the rock business. I told her about my mother. To her horror, she told me that she was supposed to be on that flight but missed the connection. To this day, I believe my mother got her seat.\"\n\nThe 50-year-old New York native had two daughters. He was an aeronautical engineer for Ford Aerospace in Newport Beach, Calif.\n\nFrom Christine Marino, daughter\n\n\"My father was born in the Bronx, N.Y. on May 29, 1928. He served in the United States Air Force in World War II as a flight engineer, and graduated with a degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Cornell University. He moved to Southern California in 1956 and worked for Northrop, where my mother did also. They quickly fell in love, married and shared two daughters together.\n\nAs an aeronautical engineer, my father traveled for business with Ford every other week to Huntsville, Alabama. He was faithful to and always flew United Airlines nonstop, but United was on strike that week. He had never before flown as a passenger on American Airlines via Chicago O'Hare to LAX, yet had no other choice, especially on a busy Memorial Day weekend.\n\nMy father spent his life fulfilling his passion for aviation and engineering through his military service and career. As such, I believe he understood moments before the rest of the passengers on his flight what the impact of seeing the left engine separating was to be. I imagine him being calm then, just as he was on our first flight to the East Coast together. When turbulence began on our decent in to Newark, he saw my face turn green and knuckles white. He chuckled, put his hand over mine and said 'Honey, don't worry; everything will be okay.'\"\n\nBorn in England but based in San Diego, the 32-year-old wife and mother of three children joined American Airlines as a flight attendant in 1967. She was laid off, however, when she became pregnant and joined other flight attendants in a class-action suit that the women won. \"They hired her back two months ago -- this was her first month back flying,\" said a waitress in a restaurant where Burns had worked while waiting to get back to the airlines. \"Her first love was always the airlines. She was tickled to death to get back.\"\n\nFrom Kerry Burns, daughter\n\n\"I was 4 when she died. I remember coming from, or being picked up from, daycare and walking into my house. My dad was sitting in a chair and said, 'Kerry, I need to talk to you. Come sit on my lap.'\n\nI looked up at him and remember him saying, 'Your mom has gone to Heaven and is with God. I'm sorry sweetheart. But she is in a good place watching over you and your sister.' How do you process that as a 4 year old?\n\nMy mom was amazing! She fought to get her job back at American Airlines after she had kids because the airlines wanted picture perfect flight attendants. She was kind and gentle. I always remember her drinking tea -- the English in her.\"\n\nFrom Tom Wood Clark, son\n\n\"My father was 46 years old when Flight 191 went down in Chicago. He was a regional sales manager for Case-Hoyt Corp. color printers based in Rochester, N.Y. The company he represented printed magazines such as Bon Appetit, Architectural Digest and The New Yorker. He had been in New York and was on his way home for Memorial Day weekend.\n\nHe was married to Suzanne E. Barnes, whom he had met at Syracuse University, father of Michael, Tom and Julie. He was raised in Syracuse, N.Y., by Ray and Lois Clark along with his brother, Phil.\n\nMy father joined the U.S. Navy and became a pilot where he served in Hawaii. After completing his service, his family moved back to New York where he began he career with Case-Hoyt. After several years in sales, the opportunity to open a new sales territory in Los Angeles presented itself, which he saw as a way to relocate and cut back on his travel time.\n\nIt was in my father's character to seek out adventure and opportunity. He was a wonderful dad. We lost him way too early. I have missed him and wondered what would have been for the last 40 years.\"\n\nThe owners of Marlena's Sportswear in Boston were traveling to Beverly Hills, Calif. He was among the 30 victims whose bodies were never identified. These victims' names became known by a process of elimination and were buried side by side at Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFrom Robin Petrillo\n\n\"My husband, John, was Aunt Lil's nephew, his mother's youngest sister. He was very close to his uncle and aunt (auntie's name was Elena but no one called her anything but Lil). They were his godparents, too. Uncle Mario was like a father to him.\n\nMy husband and his sister, Betty, worked with auntie and uncle at Marlena and were with them five days a week and on weekends.\n\nA little more about them, they were 54 years old and were the owners of Marlena Sportswear, Mar & Lena. They employed over 80 people.\n\nThey were traveling for a long overdue, relaxing vacation. They worked very hard and spent a lot of time with family.\n\nWe all were devastated. I happened to be 7 months pregnant with our first daugher. They missed 40 years of so many family things -- including new family additions.\"\n\nFrom Kelly Eaton, niece\n\n\"Fred was much loved and returning to active duty service in Japan. I was only a baby when he was lost so I can't provide a lot of stories but I also want to keep his memory alive. He is someone I very much wished I had known in my life. My dad, Larry, is in possession of letters he wrote home the year before which truly show his lighthearted personality and humor.\n\nHe was the youngest son of Merlene Eaton, the matriarch of our Eaton family. He's survived by his four older brothers -- all former Marines -- Earl, Lawrence, Charles, and John and his two sisters, Martha and Susan. I'm one of his 10 nieces and nephews.\n\nI know it's a difficult, painful memory for his siblings to remember him and they are not particularly vocal about it. He was just 22 years old and robbed of a full life that lay before him and our family was never the same.\"\n\nHe was among the 30 victims whose bodies were never identified. These victims' names became known by a process of elimination and were buried side by side at Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFrom Barbara E. Osborn, daughter\n\n\"EEE was known for his warm 'Hi, friend' greeting, his pastoral heart, his scholarship and writing, his memorization of Scripture, his continual prayer life (his lips often moved when he walked alone to the embarrassment of his children) and his strong love for the church and inviting folks to church.\n\nSixty-five years old, Elliott had been a pastor in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church since 1942, first in Maryland and later in San Francisco and Garden Grove, Calif. He was born on May 5, 1914, in Changsha, China, to a Presbyterian-minister father and a medical doctor mother serving as missionaries. He graduated from Wheaton College (1939) and Westminster Seminary (1942).\n\nNot seeking attention, he was quick to laugh, he was known for his smile, he was witty and given to puns even in Greek (his college major), and he was a great storyteller at the dinner table. As his children left for school each day, his parting words were 'Ora et Labora' (Pray and Work).\n\nHe loved California, played volleyball three times a week at lunchtime at the YMCA, body surfed at Huntington Beach and was dean or speaker at too many summer church camps to count.\n\nEEE's active involvement at church meetings made for many family educational and visits-with-cousins road trips across the country.\n\nHe took an earlier flight than scheduled when he was returning home from the annual general assembly of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church at Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Penn. When he landed at O'Hare, he was late for the connecting flight and began to sprint across the airport. 'The last time anyone who knew Daddy saw him, he was running at full speed,' said Nancy Mehne, Elliott's daughter.\n\nHis remains were never identified.\n\n'The memorial service was like a Presbytery meeting,' Mehne said, because everyone from the surrounding Orthodox Presbyterian churches came to Garden Grove, Calif., for it. The church had to open the windows and line up chairs outside to fit everyone. Not only did the tight-knit Presbytery show up, but the surrounding community did, too.\n\nWhen he died, letters of condolence flooded in from all over the country. As difficult as it was, the family knew how he would want them to act. 'He had so nurtured us in God's sovereignty,' Mehne said. 'And his death has given us plenty of opportunities to, as my father would say, speak a good word for the Lord.'\"\n\nThe 37-year-old chemical engineer for Union Oil Co. of California was a regular commuter aboard Flight 191, spending one week in Chicago and the next at home in Los Angeles with his wife and two young children.\n\nFrom Steven Ernest, son\n\n\"We were living the American Dream. Dad grew up in San Pedro, Calif., and excelled academically. He was a super genius. Everyone who knew him tells me he was the smartest person they'd ever met. He could explain the most complex mathematics and science simply to anyone who didn't understand it or delve into the minutia of the complexities to anyone who did.\n\nHe went to Caltech where he met my mom. They dated while he got bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering then went to the University of Southern California for an MBA and PhD. When he graduated, they got married, bought a new car and a home in Orange County, Calif. He had an aspiring career with Union Oil. My sister arrived in 1969 and then me in 1971. During 1977, we moved to a brand new house in Anaheim Hills, Calif., put in a yard and a pool. The wonder years were magical, right up until they weren't.\n\nA friend of his at work (Al Percy) had a wife named Ro, who came to our house. I opened the front doot on a Friday afternoon and she was there crying. My mom came up behing me and Ro said, 'We think Terry died.' The next hours were filled with phone calls, denials and, ultimately, the pastors from our church came to the house.\n\nDuring the 1990s, I met a girl in a bar who became my girlfriend for the summer. As we got to know each other, we figured out our dads were both on the plane together (her dad is Paul Trammel).\"\n\nFrom Ellen Gemme, daughter\n\n\"My dad, a vice president at Children's Press in Chicago, was on his way to the American Booksellers Association convention in Los Angeles that Memorial Day weekend. My mom was supposed to be on that flight, too -- a last minute change in her law school schedule made her skip the trip. But she was listed as dead in the newspapers. For days after the crash, people called the house thinking both my parents were gone.\n\nMay 25, 1979, was a beautiful spring day -- the kind of day when you know winter is really over and the long, lazy days of summer are just ahead. I got home from school and my mom and I started decorating for my eighth birthday party -- a slumber party with eight friends -- that I was having that night. My dad had left a long note for mom on the kitchen counter and whatever was in it made her laugh right out loud. That was the last time I ever heard my mom laugh in just that way.\n\nA neighbor called and said there had been a big plane crash. The TV went on, the phone started ringing and, after a few hours, my mom got a call from my dad's office confirming what she had feared -- that my dad had been booked on Flight 191. It was just my mom, a neighbor and myself in the kitchen when she got the news. She was standing at the yellow phone attached to the wall. And when whomever was on the other end of the phone confirmed that my dad's ticket said Flight 191 she fell onto her knees, hugging the phone and wailing.\"\n\nFrom Michael Gemme, son\n\n\"My father's parenting style was as eclectic as he was. He had grown up relatively poor; as a child he had wanted for a lot. One of thos things was sweets and the other was model trains.\n\nWe attended services regularly, but trips home from church always included a stop at the sweets' shop. Christmases were a bounty of surprises, junk food and celebration.\n\nDad loved model trains and he and his brother would take us on long road trips in his station wagon to various train shows and conventions. We manned a table at these shows and I learned to barter and haggle.\n\nLooking back as an adult, I think he was enjoying the money that an executive career provided and was using some of it to provide himself the fun stuff that had been financially out of reach when he was a child. He certainly provided a lot of fun to us.\"\n\nFrom Steven Balti, nephew\n\n\"U.S. Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Raymond L. Griego was 22 year old. He was a dedicated military man who had enlisted in the Marines right after his high school graduation. He had been serving as an embassy guard for the United States and was returning home from the Congo. Raymond was on a standby flight from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles with a layover in Chicago. He was on his way home to surprise his family. He was a gently soul and was loved by everyone who knew him.\"\n\nFrom Cathy Griego, sister\n\n\"I'll never forget the day when the first news report came on TV reporting the crash in Chicago. My first thought was my brother Raymond, but I then realized he was on the other side of the world guarding an embassy. We had no idea he was on his way home.\n\nHe loved his country and served with honor. He loved his family and friends deeply. He was a very popular young man in his community.\n\nI haven't been able to make the trip to the memorial site. I have a real fear of flying and haven't flown anywhere since my brother's tragic accident.\n\nThe pain never goes away. It's changed our family dynamics. Raymond was the joy and light in our home. I feel a real connection to the victims' families and how they fell. It doesn't get any better with time.\n\nI want my brother to be remembered for the awesome young man that he was in his short, 22 years of life.\"\n\nFrom Nancy Howell, daughter\n\n\"My mother, Elaine E. Howell, was manager of a successful bookstore in Charleston, W.Va. Like many others on the flight, she was en route to the American Booksellers Association annual meeting in Los Angeles.\n\nI learned of the plane crash on my car radio, on my way home that Friday evening. I had moved to Knoxville, Tenn., the previous August to attend graduate school at the University of Tennessee. The day of the crash, I received a letter she had mailed two days before leaving for Chicago, telling me details of her upcoming trip.\n\nThe ABA convention was always one of my mother's favorite activities as she met authors, learned about new books and spent time with colleagues from across the country. She had helped establish the local city library when I was a child. She loved books and the bookstore business. Her small bookstore in Charleston brought in an amazing array of authors -- including Julia Child, Pearl Buck and other well-known authors of the time. One of her specialty areas was keeping a diverse inventory of books by Appalachian authors, including her good friend Jesse Stuart.\n\nWhen I was younger, mother began taking courses at a local college, working full time and attending school part time for many years. She finally completed her bachelor's degree in 1974 -- the very day I graduated college.\n\nAs my brother went to our local dentist to collect records and fly to Chicago to deliver them, we knew we would need to plan a memorial. Shortly before the designated memorial, a small comfort -- her body had been identified and was being sent home in time for the service.\n\nElaine Howell was 55 when she died. She was survived by her two children, David and Nancy; a new grandson, David; and two brothers, Henry and Virgil. She was a lifelong resident of Hurricane, W. Va.\"\n\nFrom Elizabeth Janis Perl and Christine Janis Kraynek, daughters\n\n\"Born in Chicago, our dad moved to Los Angeles with his family when he was six years old. He grew up across from the old farmer's market on Fairfax and as a young man sold maps to the stars' homes and worked at the famous Tail o' the Pup hot dog stand. He played football at Fairfax High School and loved the chocolate cake at the Woolworth's lunch counter. A Russian history major at UCLA, he dropped out in his senior year to become the first Jewish salesman at Levi Strauss & Co. While based in San Francisco, he met and married our mom, who was 10 years his junior.\n\nOur dad traveled extensively for his job in the garment industry. In addition to trips to Asia and South America, he was back in Chicago often and had an office in the Merchandise Mart. Even though he was frequently away from home, he was a great 1970s dad. He coach his daughter's soccer team and participated in YMCA's Indian Princesses with us. On \"Take you kid to work\" day, we would play with the typewriters and carbon paper in his office and join him for a lunch of steaks and Scotch (we would order Shirley Temples).\n\nMost Saturdays he would come home from an early morning round of golf and we would work in the yard, clean the pool and watch UCLA football together. On Sundays, we would sit with him as he napped in front of the TV watching a Rams game. He had a great sense of humor and loved singing Christmas carols. But he could also be strict. He didn't like it when we would argue and he strictly enforced the Chicago no ketchup on hot dogs policy.\n\nWe only went on one trip together as a family that didn't involve driving to San Francisco for the holidays. In 1977, we met him in Hawaii when he was returning from a work trip to Asia. Learning to surf at Waikiki Beach and dancing the hula at the Polynesian Cultural Center are some of the best memories we have of our dad.\n\nI was 10 years old and my sister was just 14 in 1979. That Memorial Day weekend my mom and I were camping with her family in northern California and my sister was going to Catalina Island with her Girl Scout troop. That Friday afternoon, Christine was home alone and found out about the crash when my dad's boss called and was looking for him, hoping there had been a mixup It took the park ranger another day to locate my mom and me.\n\nMy dad wasn't supposed to be on that flight -- he was scheduled for a flight later that day but was able to get on Flight 191 at the last minute as a standby passenger. Back then, there was no real system for standby. His abbreviated name was scribbled at the bottom of a passenger manifest but it was misspelled. When the plane crashed there was confusion as to his identity and his name was listed in the public record incorrectly for years.\n\nWe miss you dad so much and are especially grateful to the kids at Decatur Classical School. Without their determination and perseverance, the memorial would not have been built. Together with our mom we attended the dedication ceremony in 2011 and, for the first time, met other families impacted by this tragedy. In addition to seeing his name spelled correctly on the memorial wall, we found a community of survivors. We all cried together that day as we remembered our loved ones.\"\n\nFrom Gabriel Gallardo, grandson\n\n\"My grandfather, Anthony LaVorgna, was a retired merchant marine and had many jobs including bus driver, working for North American Aviation making parts for the Apollo space missile and commercial fisherman. My grandmother, Margaret LaVorgna, was a homemaker who took care of the house and family. They lived in Redondo Beach, Calif., most of their lives and came to Illinois for the birth of my brother, David, in Sterling, Ill., in April 1979.\n\nThe memories will always be so clear inside by head. There were so many adventures we shared while they visited with us. One was our trip to K-Mart to buy my parents a new, shiny, silver toaster. While there, they bought me a sad dog with a green bow tie coin bank. I remember my grandfather and I waking up in the morning and singing, 'Pop Goes the Weasel' while waiting for the toast to pop up out of the new toaster. My grandmother and I would go out to the backyard and swing on our tree swing and play in my wooden sandbox. Although the memories were innocent and simple, they mean the world to you when you're 3. A person never really knows what can happen tomorrow, so everyone should live life to the fullest. Hold the souvenir of memories inside your mind and heart forever.\n\nOn May 25, 1979, my grandparents packed up their things to head back home to California. Before they left, my grandfather gave me one of his bolos that he brought with him. It had a handpainted duck on it. We piled into the car and drove them to a small airport in Moline. The plan was that they were supposed to fly United Airlines out of Moline, but their itinerary was changed due to a strike at the time. They took a small plane from Moline to O'Hare where they then boarded Flight 191 to head back home. I remember my last memory saying goodbye from the metal mesh gate as they boarded the small plane.\n\nI remember my mom saying that before they left, my grandmother made a statement that they were going to be on the news that night. She hated flying out of O'Hare because it was too busy and it was a holiday weekend. My parents received a call from my aunt when we arrived home that a plane in Chicago had crashed. We didn't know the details at first, but later found out that my grandparents were on board. And just like that, they vanished from my life forever.\"\n\nFrom Carolyn McCorkle Conklin, sister\n\n\"My sister, Marjorie McCorkle, had just celebrated her 30th birthday one month before the crash. She was working on an assignment in Chicago on converting some medical records. Her assignment finished early and she was anxious to return to San Jose. She opted to go standby on a flight to Los Angeles because she thought she could get home sooner by getting an interstate flight back to San Jose.\n\nShe was one of the most unselfish people I will ever know. She always put other people's needs before her own. In the last moments before American Airlines Flight 191 crashed she was probably trying to help other people and not thinking about her own safety.\n\nMargie, as she was known, was my younger sister. She set goals for herself and worked diligently to accomplish those goals. Margie attended Kent State University and was there at the time of the Kent State tragedy. Of course, this was a time before cell phones and it was very hard trying to reach her to find out if she was okay. She got her degree and then took courses to become a medical technologist. While working at Cleveland Clinic she also volunteered her time at Cleveland Free Clinic.\n\nAfter working for a few years at Cleveland Clinic, she went to Med Lab in Salt Lake City. She accepted the job on the condition that she would be taking vacation at Christmas because she always went home for Christmas. Family was very important to her. Then she went on to accept a job in San Jose at Spectra Medical Systems again with the same stipulation.\n\nMargie became an aunt for the first time in August 1978 and couldn't get to Virginia, where we lived, quickly enough. She was thrilled with her new role! Rather than shower her new nephew with gifts, she opted to give him a savings bond and intended to do so every year.\n\nThough I miss my sister every day, I am so sorry that my boys -- her nephews -- never got to know their wonderful aunt.\"\n\nFrom Kevin Moncrieff, son\n\n\"My father, John Gillie Moncrieff (known as 'Jack' to everyone), was on Flight 191. He was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and joined the U.S. Air Force in the 1960s and became a U.S. citizen. He met my mother, Donna, and they married.\n\nI was born in 1971, and was 7 at the time of the accident. I came home from school on that day and walked into a family room full of some of my mom's friends and her. She told me there had been a horrible accident.\n\nMy father worked for Bell Telephone as an engineer and analyst. He was on the team that designed one of the first underground telephone systems in California. He flew to ORD in order to attend a week of training in Lisle. He had a degree in accounting and received his MBA about a year before he died. He was in the Air Force Reserve at the time of his death and specialized in working on cockpit avionics. He was also a drummer for the Cameron Pipe and Drum band and on the board of directors for a local credit union in his spare time.\n\nMy mother lives in Roseville, Calif., today and is 73.\n\nI am 47 and live in Geneva. I decided to go to the University of North Dakota in the early 1990s and major in aeronautical studies and geography. Today, I am a Boeing 737 captain for United Airlines. I drive by the accident site every day on my way to (O'Hare) to go on my flying trips.\n\nI married my college sweetheart, Kari, in 1993. We have two daughters who attend high school and college at this time.\"\n\nFrom Ivelisse Rios-Lopez, niece\n\n\"My aunt Zaida Schade, her husband Paul Schade and daughters Zaida Louisa and Marjorie were all passengers on that flight. I remember being 14 years old and getting the announcement that something terrible happened to my aunt and uncle. They were originally supposed to go by themselves but ended up bringing their two daughters at the last moment.\n\nMy aunt Zaida was born in Utuado, Puerto Rico, on Sept. 6, 1941, to parents Pedro Rios and Luisa Gonzalez. She was the youngest of six and the only baby girl of the family. She and her brothers were very close and had a loving bond with each other. She had married my Uncle Paul and moved up to Naperville and had their two lovely girls there.\n\nZaida and my cousins were always so fun loving and very caring. She always would worry about her older brothers and would make sure to visit her family in Puerto Rico whenever she could. Even though I can't remember too much about my Uncle Paul, I do know that he was a kind man who very much loved his family and served in the U.S. Navy. I know that my father, who is the last living member of their siblings, misses her greatly and although he suffers from Alzheimer's disease and (is) not able to remember, she will always be in his heart.\"\n\nFrom Tom Sheridan, husband\n\n\"Mary (Tierney) Sheridan was born in County Kildare, Ireland. She came to the United States on her own when she was 15. She had very little formal education and was self-educated. She had a great appreciation for literature and was an excellent writer and editor. She obtained a job at the New York Times and then worked in various book publishing companies. She started working for Playboy magazine, which was just beginning to expand into the international market. Her promotion to a director of international editions was the reason for moving to Chicago in 1974. She traveled the world helping to set up international editions of that magazine. She was very comfortable dealing with publishers in different countries. She was on Flight 191 as part of her job to network with foreign publishers at the American Booksellers Association convention in Los Angeles.\n\nShe was a cancer survivor, had a wonderful sense of humor and always had a smile on her face. She had amazing self-confidence and could hold her own in any kind of company. She never lost her Irish accent, had a great interest in Irish politics, literature and music and loved to go back to enjoy the simple rural life that she grew up in. She was 37.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old manager of Jocundry's Books in East Lansing, Mich., was traveling with two colleagues to the American Booksellers Association convention in Los Angeles.\n\nFrom David M. Stacks, brother\n\n\"On the day of the crash I was attending class at Western Michigan University where I was enrolled in the flight technology program and flying to attain my private pilot's license. I did achieve this, graduating in 1981 and joining the U.S. Navy as a pilot. I served eight total years in the Navy and U.S. Coast Guard. After leaving the military, I was hired by Northwest Airlines and flew the DC-10 there for seven years. I found the DC-10 to be a great jet to fly and thoroughly enjoyed my time. Needless to say, over my 40 years of aviation, the results of May 25, 1979, have always been close to my thoughts.\n\nIt was a very tragic loss of life. There were, thankfully, changes made in how all airlines monitor passenger lists and many, many more safety and maintenance-related improvements that benefit aviation safety to this day.\"\n\nFrom Jon Stone, son\n\n\"Here's a little bit about dad. He was, without a doubt, the center of our family both immediate and extended. He got immense pleasure hosting the many holiday, birthday and anniversary parties with my mom, June. Any reason to get family and friends together. What? You got a new hat? I'm taking everyone to Monty's for dinner.\n\nHis 50th birthday was an epic event at the Encino (Calif.) house. The perfect host for all who attended. We were in the process of planning mom's 50th birthday. I remember his excitement was so infectious we all got swept up in his love on this one.\n\nSome of my earliest memories are of dad taking me and my brother Jeff to go see the cement trucks in Van Nuys, Calif., and then off to Toys R Us. We were about 3 and 4 years old. He was a coach of our little league teams and when not coaching he would be in the stands cheering everyone on -- teammates and opponents alike. Kinda pissed me off about the opponents but he taught us about sportsmanship, compassion and live by the golden rule.\n\nThere was a day our neighbor showed me how to greet cars coming down our street by waving my middle finger at them. Well, dad came around the corner only to see me greeting him. Brakes screech, window opens and in the kindest, most gentle way he informed me that this is not a great idea and (the neighbor) is a moron.\n\nI remember when he took me to a trade show for his business, Cameo World. Hundreds of competitors and customers stopped by to sit and schmooze and laugh with Jack.\n\nMy father and his dad flew from Los Angeles to New York City to go see the old neighborhood in Brooklyn. Papa was getting up there in age and this was a perfect time to do this. After their week in New York, dad put Papa on a flight back to Los Angeles and dad went to Chicago for a meeting his partner asked him to take for their new business venture, One Stop Posters. He got to Chicago only to find out the customer had to cancel the meeting.\n\nDad apparently started the standby procedure and landed on Flight 191. He was always passenger J. Stone until Kim Jockl's class (at Decautur Classical School in Chicago) undertook the task of creating the memorial at Lake Park. He was finally passenger Jack Stone.\n\nHe had called the house to let us know he was taking an earlier flight home. I answered that call and had one last chance to say 'Love you, Dad,' before hanging up. About 30 minutes later, the news of the crash started coming in. American Airlines confirmed what we all knew about 2 a.m. on May 26, 1979.\"\n\nFrom Jim Valladares, brother\n\n\"Craig was born Aug. 7, 1948, in New York. He was the middle child, I was the oldest and our sister, Elise, was the youngest. We grew up in New York, New Jersey, Chicago and Arlington Heights.\n\nSome time after high school, Craig enlisted in the U.S. Navy and his induction was held at Wrigley Field during a Cubs game. After about a year, he volunteered for Vietnam and served as a helicopter door gunner. He flew combat support missions and during that time was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. After discharge, he worked for A & P Food Stores in different positions and was a buyer at the time of his death.\n\nCraig was married and had a daugher, Michelle, whose family still lives in Arlington Heights.\n\nHe was traveling to California because our father, Jim Valladres Sr., had just retired and was moving to New Mexico from Fullerton, Calif., and he was going to help him with the move.\n\nFrom Newana Cesarone, sister\n\n\"Narda Contesti Vetor was headed to Los Angeles on May 25, 1979, for her girlfriend's wedding, but, like everyone else on American Airlines Flight 191, never made it to her destination.\n\nNarda was a daughter, wife, mother, sister, sister-in-law, aunt, niece, cousin and friend. I listed each title because each person that fell under the individual categories truly believed they were special to her. She was the captain of the cheerleading squad at East Detroit High School, Mich. (now East Pointe), loved sports, a certified soccer referee and a resident of Clinton Township, Mich.\n\nShe encouraged her then-young boys to play soccer and baseball. She was always present in her three children's lives.\n\nNarda was becoming politically active in her community by working on her neighbor's run for treasurer in Clinton Township. There was even talk of her running for the township board. We always wondered what she could have achieved had she lived beyond her 31 years. We will never know but we know it would have been something truly special just like her.\n\nThe Clinton Township recreation department named an award after her that summer. As far as we know, it is still in existence.\"\n\nFrom Barbara Witthoft, wife\n\n\"My husband, Dale Allan Witthoft, was one of the people who died on American Airlines Flight 191. He was 32 years old with a wife and two daughters, aged 15 months and 3 years old. His death has colored every aspect of our lives.\n\nDale grew up in Kankakee, attended Bradley University and then went to Houston to work as an engineer for Exxon. He was drafted into the Army during the Vietnam War. After returning from Vietnam, he continued to work for Exxon. We met through mutual friends, married and spent our first two years in Grand Isle, La. We then transferred to Australia. We lived there five years before his death in 1979. Our two daughters, Allison and Jennifer, were born in Sale, Victoria.\n\nEach year we got to come home for a visit and it was during one of those visits that this tragedy happened. The girls and I would have been with Dale but we decided to stay at my parents' home in Pennsylvania. On the way back to Australia, Dale had to change planes in Chicago and, unfortunately, they asked for volunteers to change to Flight 191 and Dale volunteered. The last image I have of him at the airport in Harrisburg, Pa., was 3-year-old Allison running after him saying, 'One more hug, Daddy, one more hug.'\n\nDale was a wonderful husband and father. His children and our four grandsons missed having him in their lives: cheering them on in sports; helping with school; being proud of their accomplishments. But we have always believed that Dale has been an angel watching over us and, one day, we will all be together again!\""
