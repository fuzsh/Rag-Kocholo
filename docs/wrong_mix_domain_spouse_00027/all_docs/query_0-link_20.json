        "text": "So excited for Supermomos to be featured in Forbes! Sindhya Valloppillil Reflecting on Women's History Month which just ended - think one thing we can all do more of is to make a conscious effort to facilitate truly mix-gendered communities of professionals, as diverse perspectives make for better outcomes! It is also important for us to have role models - to learn from, be inspired, and also to stretch our own imagination of what could be. There are many incredible women out there doing incredible things, and I want to highlight one role model that I'm blessed to have! She is Pauline Brown, who I interviewed at our recent summit at the NYSE. She is author of Aesthetic Intelligence, former Chairman of LVMH USA, board member at Neiman Marcus Group, and she has been generous about sharing her vast experiences and learnings at events such as our Female Founders & Funders Series in partnership with Gracie Mansion Conservancy and the The Wharton School Women in Investing Summit. She is herself organizing a retreat for female entrepreneurial leaders in Portugal this May. She has done so much for the female founders community and is truly an inspiration and role model for me as an authentic, values-driven leader :) Here are 3 things that I’ve learned from her (among many - they were hard to pick): 1. She is a woman of conviction. In investing, she doesn't go for the next \"hot new trend\", but rather believes in backing great teams and companies with strong domain expertise regardless of the trend (which comes and goes). 2. She is not afraid to be herself, and as a woman in finance back when it was much more dominated by men, she did not try to blend in - whether in thought or style. If you're at a company where you feel like you're suppressing yourself, instead of toning down, think about whether you're at the right place. 3. She sticks to her core values. Branding to her means an external expression of internal beliefs. We should double down on our authentic selves and on what brings a smile to our face."
