The amendments are available on the ULC website.\n\nFrom time to time, the Permanent Editorial Board for the UCC issues Commentaries to provide guidance in interpreting and resolving issues raised by the UCC. Published Commentaries are available on the PEB page.\n\n___________\n\nThe Permanent Editorial Board for the Uniform Commercial Code discourages non-uniform amendments or additions to the UCC by the states, assists in attaining and maintaining uniformity in state statutes governing commercial transactions, and monitors the law of commercial transactions for needed modernization or other improvement.\n\nThe Members Consultative Group (MCG) on Uniform Commercial Code Issues provides input to ALI on UCC-related issues from time to time, such as draft amendments to the UCC, proposed PEB Commentaries, and projects that may overlap or implicate the UCC.\n\nThe MCG can review electronic drafts and submit comments by email or via the ALI website. There may be occasional virtual meetings or conference calls, but the MCG will not meet in person."
