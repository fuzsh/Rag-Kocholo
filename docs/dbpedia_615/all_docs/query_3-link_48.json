He was a past president of Congregation Children of Israel and took pride teaching Sunday School there for many years. He enjoyed a cup of Black English tea every morning and loved to spend time in his yard watching the wildlife.\n\nIn addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his brother Dr. Fred Mazer; and many canine companions, particularly his beloved walking partner, Bosie.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 44 years Debra Mazer; children, Jesse MacKenzie (Douglas), Samantha Alex (Willice); siblings, Linda Goldman, Mike Mazer; many nieces and nephews.\n\nA memorial service will be held on Thursday, August 1, 2024, at 3:00 PM at the Congregation Children of Israel.
