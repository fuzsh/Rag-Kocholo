        "text": "Mrs. Linda Kay Waldren passed away Friday, August 3, 2018 at her residence in Lansing, Michigan. Age 71 years old. Linda was born April 27, 1947 to Melvin and Rucell Bassett in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nLinda’s family moved from Grand Rapids to Holt, Michigan, where she attended school. Linda would later relocate and become a residence of Lansing, Michigan. Throughout her adult life, Linda had many occupations. However, she determined that her love of people would serve her best as a home health care aid. Linda loved all animals, but most of all she loved her cats. Linda’s kind and gentle heart will be greatly missed.\n\nShe leaves to cherish her memory her spouse, Douglas Waldren; one sister, Melanie Hudson of Winter Haven, Florida; special friend Ron Hyde, and many other relatives and friends.\n\nLinda was preceded in death by her parents.\n\nSpecial thank you to the wonderful caregivers at Heartland Hospice Care."
