        "text": "Lower house of the New South Wales Parliament, directly elected by the people of New South Wales, where the government of the state is formed.\n\nCambodians began coming to Australian in the 1970s, after the fall of their country's genocidal Khmer Rouge regime. A large part of the existing community arrived in the 1980s as refugees or as family reunion migrants. Most Cambodian Sydneysiders live in the Fairfield area, and community life centres on the Khmer temples found there and on the commercial and cultural centre of Cabramatta.\n\nSydney's monorail was opposed from the moment its construction was announced. Derided as an eyesore and an ineffective solution for Sydney's growing transport needs, the passing of the monorail attracted over 1500 passengers for its final journey in July 2013. We explore the history of the monorail Sydney-siders loved to hate."
