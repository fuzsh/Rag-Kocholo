        "text": "Darlene Roberts, 76, of Noblesville, Indiana passed away in her home Sunday, June 25th, 2023. She was born in Lebanon, Indiana on April 27th, 1947.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents Nolan and Velma (Sanders) Roberts and siblings: Nolan “Buddy” Roberts and Diane (Roberts) Weir, and her beloved dog, Max. She leaves behind daughters, Monica Fairchild and Melanie (Fairchild) Weaver, grandchildren: Matthew Weaver, Emily Weaver, Abigail Weaver, Madison Craig, Evan Weaver, Allison Fairchild, and great-grandson, Nolan Weaver-O’Mara.\n\nDarlene had a very giving heart. If anyone needed assistance whether it be financial, housing, physical, or spiritual, she would be the first to volunteer. Her mission in life was to lead people to the Lord and provide guidance to her grandchildren. Darlene’s interests included charity donations, talking, cleaning, and sharing the Gospel.\n\nHer family finds comfort knowing that she is now reunited with her Heavenly family. She wanted everyone to know that those who have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior will be reunited with her one day.\n\nPrivate arrangements have been made by the family and donations in her memory can be made to Feed the Children at https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https://secure.feedthechildren.org/site/Donation2?1400.donation=form1&df_id=1400&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=paid&utm_content=tb1400&s_src=googleads&s_subsrc=tb1400&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8_6dnd33_wIVQijUAR2IzgUkEAAYAiAAEgIK8PD_BwE___.YXAzOmluZGlhbmFmdW5lcmFsY2FyZTphOm86NTRjZjBiOTZmOGRkYTk3NTJiOWQ4Y2QyOGNlNTMzOTc6Njo0YTI5OmViZTE0MjdmODM2Mzg2MmY2YWZjNmFkNDRjY2RlOTQ1MTkyZmI5N2E4NzVjNmYwNjQ4Y2UyZWQwOTBhNjUwYzU6dDpU"
