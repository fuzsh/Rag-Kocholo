Williams, Toronto ’50 (Deceased)\n\nShepardson Award Roll Number: 12\n\nAwarded the Shepardson Award on June 28, 2006\n\nOne of Beta Theta Pi’s most widely‐recognized alumni, Williams has given selflessly of his time and energies to the Fraternity’s presence there, particularly in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Williams was recruitment chairman and treasurer while a collegian in the Theta Zeta (Toronto) chapter. He became an involved alumnus for Beta soon after earning an honors BA in economics.

Brower, Miami ’50\n\nShepardson Award Roll Number: 14\n\nAwarded the Shepardson Award on October 28, 2006\n\nBrower served as the Fraternity’s second administrative secretary (1958‐65) and 16th general treasurer (1967‐70) and is an oft‐consulted member of the Advisory Council of former trustees. Brower was initiated into the Alpha Chapter as a sophomore on March 13, 1948, first in a class of 10. He has commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps upon graduation in June 1950 and was wounded in Korea early in 1951.\n\nAfter hospitalization, he returned to combat duty before being reassigned to Parris Island as a recruit‐company commander. Brower gained management experience in being in charge of the base officers’ club, which included a large hotel operation. Later, he became commander of the Marine detachment aboard the carrier U.S.S. Tarawa, serving through its world cruise. Released as a captain in August 1955, he returned to Miami University for graduate study toward a career in real estate sales and property management. Brower married Mary Jane Hugh, a Miami member of Alpha Omicron Pi, in June 1956.\n\nThe administrative secretary position had been created as a job to be filled on a part‐time basis, for about five years, by a bright young man who would move on after gaining maturity and experience. By 1957, Ralph N. Fey, Miami ’40, as its first incumbent, was preparing to begin devoting full time to his insurance business. On Fey’s recommendation, the Fraternity’s Board of Trustees offered the opportunity to Brower to understand that he would continue his business activities part‐time. He accepted effective June 30, 1958. He began working in February under Fey’s guidance and was able to take over entirely on May 2. He served seven years.\n\nBy the time he, in turn, was ready to leave the Beta office, he had become a partner in Oxford Real Estate Sales, a development firm. Several other firms eventually were merged with this to form Alpha, Inc., an association of members of the Alpha chapters of fraternities founded at Miami.\n\nBeta Theta Pi continued to call on Brower.

He was a Fund Trustee from 1973‐77, a position that was the forerunner of the directors of the Beta Theta Pi Foundation. He was instrumental in establishing the Beta Foundation, again serving as a board member from 1993‐2000. Jim completed his term as Foundation Chairman.\n\nAs Beta’s official legal counsel to the administrative secretary and Board of Trustees for more than 30 years, Jim provided advice on all legal and tax matters, facilitating the development of today’s chapter services, risk management and fund‐raising activities of the General Fraternity and Foundation. After his death, his estate gift prompted The Beta Theta Pi to feature him as a member of The Bridge Builder Society in the A Lasting Moment feature of the magazine.\n\nAdvisory Council Member Robert L. Cottrell, Miami ’54, reflects, “As a peer District Chief, Trustee, Foundation Board Director, and as our legal counsel during my term as Administrative Secretary, Jim was an invaluable mentor in my Beta experience.”\n\n“Jim served on the Beta Bu Building Company for five decades, providing his characteristic wit and wisdom, always with humility and profound self‐deprecating humor. Jim would express his pride for the Cincinnati chapter’s progress and awards by saying he would never be admitted with their current standards. We all knew better,” recalls Advisory Council Member Thomas D. Cassady, Cincinnati ’76.\n\nFor 49 years, he practiced law as a member of Frost Brown Todd LLC (formerly known as Frost & Jacobs). His practice focused on estate planning, estate administration and the representation of numerous family and closely-held businesses.

(Dipper) DiPaolo, Michigan ’78\n\nShepardson Award Roll Number: 17\n\nAwarded the Shepardson Award on August 1, 2009\n\nDr. Donald G. (Dipper) DiPaolo, was initiated as number 1509 on the roll of the Lambda Chapter of Beta Theta Pi at the University of Michigan on April 23, 1975. His commitment and dedication to Beta Theta Pi over the past two decades is largely unmatched, and he serves as the quintessential Beta role model to undergraduates and alumni alike.\n\nDiPaolo’s journey as a Beta volunteer began when he assumed the role of house director and chapter counselor for his alma mater in 1992. Seeing the potential of this bright, rising star, he was appointed district chief in 1994 by then-General Secretary Vince del Pizzo, serving in that capacity for two years.\n\nChange was in the air in the mid-1990s as Beta Theta Pi was seeking to prove her relevance in the collegiate world. By the late fall of 1996, the Fraternity’s leadership gathered a cadre of committed individuals . . . ultimately forming a blue-ribbon strategic vision steering committee. Brother DiPaolo’s background in education made him a strong player in that all-important endeavor and he became a member of the 1996 Strategic Planning Committee. Soon after, the Men of Principle initiative was born, and Dipper was asked to introduce the new initiative to the 159thGeneral Convention in Miami, Florida, in 1998. His influence continued as a member of the Initiative’s development and implementation teams.\n\nDiPaolo was elected to a three-year term as vice president on the Fraternity’s Board of Trustees at the 163rd General Convention in 2002 and has led many significant conversations among Beta brothers as he is a frequent speaker and advocate for Beta Theta Pi’s Men of Principle initiative and leadership programming. He serves as the General Fraternity’s Leadership Development advisor and you have likely met him if you have attended the Chapter President’s Leadership Academy, a Keystone Regional Leadership Conference, The John and Nellie Wooden Institute for Men of Principle, or The Peter F. Greiner Leadership College, which are all programs he has helped to shape and facilitate.\n\nDiPaolo is nationally known as a strong advocate for quality fraternity and sorority life. He has spoken at hundreds of campuses and spends much of his time promoting interfraternalism. In August 2002, he was honored by the North-American Interfraternity Conference as a recipient of the Award of Distinction and served as the keynote speaker for the 2008 Annual Meeting of the Association of Fraternity Advisors.\n\nDiPaolo earned a doctorate in leadership education from the University of Michigan in August 2004, and owns and operates DiPaolo & Associates, a consulting practice that provides private leadership coaching.\n\nDiPaolo was an award-winning Saline High School teacher and coach for 19 years before he joined the University of Michigan School of Education faculty in 1997 as cohort director of the Master of Arts and Certification Program.\n\nWilliam F.

He graduated in 1949 and, reflecting on his decision to join, Bill shared, “It turned out that was one of the best decisions I ever made, because it got me back to civilian life after four years of serving in the military.”\n\nDuring World War II, Brother Hahn, a Navy pilot, flew carrier-based fighter planes in aerial missions over Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Tokyo and Kyushu. The President of the United States awarded him the Distinguished Flying Cross for his “heroism and extraordinary achievement” piloting in Fighting Squadron Eighty Two, which was attached to the U.S.S.

Seeger struggled with mechanical drawing and excelled in calculus, and Hahn, the opposite, helped Seeger with mechanical drawing while Seeger studied calculus with Hahn. Hahn initially was not attracted to the idea of fraternities. However, he decided to join Seeger for dinner at the chapter house, met his future brothers and committed to joining the Fraternity.\n\nAfter college, Hahn worked at the Fuller Co. until 1968. Hahn then joined Pennsylvania Crusher Corp. in 1968, which merged with Penn Virginia Corp., where he served as president from 1969 until 1980.

From 1965-72, he served as Beta’s third administrative secretary following in the footsteps of Ralph N. Fey, Miami ’40, and Frederick F. Brower, Miami ’50. Under Helman’s guidance, the Beta Leadership Fund was launched, and the Fraternity began using computers to save membership records.

Kirk was initiated September 27, 1953, as Roll No. 942 into the Alpha Nu Chapter at the University of Kansas.\n\nThe spirit of dedication and giving back to the Fraternity are inherent in Kirk, whose role as a volunteer began back in 1968 when he served for five years as a district chief. Less than 10 years later, the Board of Trustees appointed him as the Fraternity’s 23rd General Secretary, a position Kirk filled from 1980-1983. Members in that time remember his genuineness and authenticity through gestures such as sending individual, hand-signed holiday cards to each chapter. Even after his successful run occupying the highest volunteer position within the Fraternity, Kirk returned to serving Beta Theta Pi locally as the house corporation president of the then-young and aspiring Epsilon Lambda Chapter at the University of Missouri–Kansas City from 1992-1998. The men were so grateful for his contributions and guidance that they honored him as Roll No. 72 on the chapter’s official roll.\n\nFor the countless hours of time Kirk has given back to the Fraternity, he has been equally as generous with his treasure. A regular donor to the Beta Leadership Fund virtually every year since its inception in 1971, he also served as a donor and volunteer for the Upon These Principles Capital Campaign – the then-largest fundraising campaign in Greek world history.

Of his six years volunteering in this capacity, he concurrently spent four as chairman of the Upon These Principles Campaign. Under his leadership, the campaign successfully raised $20.1 million in cash and estate gift pledges – an interfraternity record at the time among Beta’s 60-plus peer organizations – to fund the then-young Men of Principle initiative and endow its educational programming. Since 2007, he has been a member of the Fraternity’s Advisory Council of past board members.\n\nBates is a former chairman and current senior counsel of the Kansas City law firm Lathrop & Gage (now Lathrop GPM). Professionally, he has served as a member of or general counsel to numerous public or quasi-public bodies in his nearly 70-year legal career, including the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, the Kansas City Terminal Railway Company and Central Methodist College of Fayette, Missouri. Notably, he has also been a special assistant attorney general of Missouri, served five years as secretary and attorney for the Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners, and acted as president of The Missouri Bar.\n\nAmong a multitude of leadership posts within his community, Bates is a past president of the University of Missouri System Board of Curators – an institution that awarded him a Juris Doctor Honoris Causa in 2016. He is also a former chairman of both the Missouri State Chamber of Commerce and Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce, as well as a 12-year former member of the Central Methodist College Board of Curators.\n\nFor his professional accolades, Bates was recognized with Beta Theta Pi’s prestigious Oxford Cup on January 25, 1996. In receiving the Francis W. Shepardson Award, he becomes only the sixth Beta to earn both of the Fraternity’s top alumni honors.\n\nHe is also a recipient of the President’s Citation Pro Bono Award from The Missouri Bar, Missouri Lawyers Weekly’s ICON Award, Kansas City Rotary’s Outstanding Kansas Citian Award, University of Missouri’s Geyer Award, the Brotherhood Award from the National Coalition of Christian and Jews, the Kansas City Metropolitan Bar Association’s Lifetime Achievement Award, the Greater Kanas City YMCA Distinguished Service Award and the Champion of Children Award from the Lawyer’s Encouraging Academic Performance Foundation.\n\nBert was married to his Beta Sweetheart, Joy, Pi Beta Phi, for 56 years before her passing in 2013. He resides in Kansas City, Missouri, and is father to two children and three grandchildren, including one Beta, William Tucker Bates, Kansas ’21.\n\nWilliam E. (Bill) Lowry Jr., Kenyon ’56\n\nShepardson Award Roll Number: 29\n\nAwarded the Shepardson Award on August 6, 2022\n\nThe finer details of an individual’s initiation – while often remembered as a milestone by the brother and his close friends – often fade through the passing of the years from the consciousness of the larger Fraternity. Not so in the case of William E. (Bill) Lowry Jr., Kenyon ’56.\n\nLeaving his boyhood home on the south side of Chicago, Lowry traveled east to Gambier, Ohio, to begin his college career. In the fall of 1952, the standard quarters for freshmen at the all-male Kenyon were Quonset huts that had served as temporary housing for the VA program. Lowry was a halfback on the football team and made fast friends.\n\nSeveral players on the team, who were members of Beta Theta Pi, had extended a social membership to Lowry, but he had not been invited to join the Fraternity. “There was kind of a grassroots movement in the chapter to get Bill to be a full-fledged member of the Fraternity,” recalled Franklin H. Gingerich ‘56. It wasn’t long before the chapter announced its intention to pledge Lowry.\n\nWhile the Fraternity’s constitution or laws imposed no restrictions with regard to race, color or creed upon those considered for membership, the initiation of a Black student had simply not – to the knowledge of Fraternity officers – been done prior to the spring of 1954.\n\nThe chapter received numerous calls from alumni about the matter. Some alumni approved. Others did not. James A. Hughes Jr. ’55, recalls speaking with then-General Secretary Seth R. Brooks, St. Lawrence 1922, who suggested the chapter delay the initiation until it could consult with alumni and Fraternity officers. “We weren’t trying to make a statement,” Hughes said. “There was absolutely no reason not to initiate him. For us, it was just a natural thing to do.”\n\nLowry was initiated into the Beta Alpha Chapter on April 27, 1954, just three weeks before the United States Supreme Court announced its historic decision on Brown v. Board of Education. A 25- year-old Martin Luther King Jr. was working on his dissertation in systematic theology at Boston University, Rosa Parks was still conforming to Montgomery’s segregationist busing policies and Kenyon College had graduated its first two Black students just two years earlier.\n\nSixty-eight years later, Lowry’s college days are but a few moments in what has been a remarkable life. He harbors no bitterness about the circumstances resulting from his initiation, and even muses, “I am ‘the Kenyon affair.’”\n\nIn 1988, former Kenyan College President and Vice President of Inland Steel William G. Caples III ’32, and former First National Bank of Chicago President Richard L. Thomas ’53, invited Lowry to serve on the board of trustees of Kenyon College – a position he held for more than two decades.\n\nDuring that tenure, Lowry made it his personal mission to make both Kenyon’s student body and its faculty more diverse. He has filled a similar role in his service to Beta Theta Pi.\n\nA General Convention veteran and former Convention vice president, Lowry served on the Foundation Board of Directors from 2011-2015 as chairman of the nominating committee. In June 2020, General Secretary Wayne Kay, Virginia Tech ’73, announced the creation of a new, Board-level Commission on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Charged with analyzing all aspects of the Fraternity, this historic announcement included the appointment of Lowry as commission chairman.\n\nWhen asked to once again play a role in driving the Fraternity to do something so bold, Lowry remarked: “Sixty-six years ago, a group of young men at Kenyon College also did something pretty bold. This is the right thing to do, and it is certainly the right time. I will do whatever my beloved Beta Theta Pi asks of me.”\n\nRobert L. Schnese, Wisconsin ’83\n\nShepardson Award Roll Number: 30\n\nAwarded the Shepardson Award on August 5, 2023\n\nBob Schnese’s leadership within Beta Theta Pi dates back to his time as a collegiate member of the Alpha Pi Chapter, where he served as chorister, new member educator and corresponding secretary.\n\nIn the 40 years since his graduation, Bob has volunteered his time for the Fraternity in various capacities, including as counselor and advisor for chapters at Lawrence, Wisconsin and Wisconsin-Oshkosh; assistant district chief; district chief; regional director; and as a facilitator for the John and Nellie Wooden Institute for Men of Principle.\n\nHe has served four terms on the Fraternity Board of Trustees, including six years as General Fraternity President. During this time, Schnese witnessed unprecedented growth of Beta’s collegiate membership – exceeding 10,000 undergraduates for the first time in the Fraternity’s history – as well as steady increases in the all-fraternity GPA and average chapter size.\n\nSchnese was also involved in the Beta Foundation’s two most recent capital campaigns, “Upon These Principles” and “Promises to Keep.”\n\nOn December 30, 2016, Schnese retired from Motorola Solutions, Inc., the company he joined upon his graduation from the University of Wisconsin School of Business some 33 years earlier. He has served the Congregational Church of Excelsior, Minnesota, as a member of the choir and chairman of its finance committee, as well as First Congregation Church in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, as a member of its Board of Deacons.\n\nAn extremely active sports fan, “Badger Bob” is a season ticketholder for the Green Bay Packers and University of Wisconsin football and hockey programs. He and his Convention-veteran Beta Sweetheart, Lori, have been married for more than 30 years and reside on Long Lake in Waupaca, Wisconsin. They have two children, Andrew and Daina.\n\nDr. P. Thomas Purinton, Kansas State ’63\n\nShepardson Award Roll Number: 31\n\nAwarded the Shepardson Award on July 27, 2024\n\nAffectionately known as “Dr. P.,” Tom Purinton was initiated into the Gamma Epsilon Chapter as Roll No. 782 on April 1, 1960. Sparking a lifelong love affair, that moment ignited a passion for Beta Theta Pi that is arguably second only to his faith and love for his family.\n\nGraduating in 1963, Dr. P. continued his studies at Kansas State and earned a doctorate degree in veterinary medicine in 1965. It was followed by a second doctorate in veterinary anatomy from Minnesota in 1972. Enjoying a 33-year career in Athens, Georgia, as a member of the anatomy and physiology department at the University of Georgia, he received numerous awards, notably where he was an eight-time recipient of the Faculty Recognition Award.\n\nA lifelong supporter of his home chapter, it was Tom’s adopted chapter at Georgia where he spent decades serving young brothers. Joining a team of local alumni who started the chapter in the 1980s, beginning in 1996 he served as chapter counselor, new member advisor and ritual advisor. For his service, he was awarded Epsilon Epsilon Roll No. 358 on April 20, 2000.\n\nDr. P was an integral part of the 1998 launch of Beta’s Men of Principle initiative. As chapter counselor, he guided Georgia’s men through the pilot phase. The following year, he began a run of 25 straight summers facilitating Beta’s award-winning Wooden Institute.\n\nA fixture at Beta leadership programs and on Beta task forces, he also served as regional chief for seven years. In 2000, he was elected to the Board of Trustees and, in 2005, he was elected to his first of two terms as General Fraternity President. In 2016, he joined Beta’s Foundation Board, serving until 2022.\n\nIn recognition for his service, Tom was awarded the NIC’s Award of Distinction in 2012. A Convention veteran with Sweetheart, Molly, Dr. P. enjoys a large, loving family: one son, two daughters and 10 grandchildren."
