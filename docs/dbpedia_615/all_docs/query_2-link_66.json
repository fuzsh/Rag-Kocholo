We will relocate to a new 53,500 square feet warehouse and office building at Stroudwater 13, just 800 hundred meters away from our existing facility.\n\nManaging Director Shabir Ahmed said: “With Greiner Bio-One Ltd having been based in the local area since we established a UK subsidiary in 1989, we are delighted to be starting the new phase of our exciting journey with a purpose-built warehousing and office facility in Stonehouse.\"\n\n“We had been looking for a suitable site for some time when Stroudwater 13 became available. We are mindful of where our staff are located – that was a key factor – so we wanted to stay in the area if we could.”\n\nThe state-of-the-art facilities, which are planned to be completed by the end of 2023, will allow Greiner Bio-One UK to continue to deliver exceptional service to our customers whilst being prepared to meet the challenges of the future."
