Barnes; grandchildren Taylor (John Pisanzio) Jacobs, Jenna Jacobs, and Joshua (Mary) Jacobs; great-grandchild Adelyn Jacobs; sister Linda (Richard) Wolff of Batavia, and brother Larry Jacobs of Florida, along with many nieces, nephews, and numerous in-laws.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his loving wife Mary A. (Maniace) Jacobs; sisters Judy Ryan, and Ann (Lawrence) Lamie; and niece Tammy Wolff.\n\nNeil was an extremely generous and proud man. He would give whatever he could and never expected anything in return. From a young age he was a hard worker, starting out as the neighborhood paperboy and then as a butcher in the meat department at Marchese’s Groceries. This contributed to his love for cooking. He cooked alongside his wife Mary who shared the same passion. He loved making homemade soups, stuffed peppers, scalloped potatoes, his own blend of burgers, as well as sauce and meatballs. Along with cooking, Neil truly loved gardening. He had a huge garden in the backyard and spent many hours each summer tending to it. He always said “vegetables are the best thing for ya!” He loved having company over to sit outside and share a beer or two with him in the patio that overlooked his garden. He would always send a few bags of fresh picked vegetables from the garden home with whomever visited.\n\nNeil was a United States Air Force Veteran, having served from 1955-1959. He was mostly known for being a self-employed carpenter. He completely renovated the house he lived in for 58 years. Neil was always willing to give a helping hand when needed and rarely charged what his time and materials were worth. He never cheated anyone and was a very honest man. He prided himself on being a good person and made many close friendships with his customers.\n\nNeil also loved to hunt and fish and shared this passion with his son, “Little” Neil. He was nicknamed “The Salmon Man” and would often take the boat out to fish at Point Breeze on Lake Ontario with his son and other family and friends. Neil loved to talk about the “good old days” and stories of his fishing trips, mostly stories about how they barley escaped storms or large fish he caught. Along with his fishing stories, he loved to tell stories about growing up in Batavia and how “things used to be.” He also enjoyed reminiscing about his past in the Air Force and his time in Japan and Texas. Neil had many friends and was known as “The Mayor of Maple Street” as he would sit in his chair on the enclosed front porch and watch the neighborhood.\n\nHe enjoyed spending time with children and would often make contributions to St. Jude and Golisano Children’s Hospital, especially since his great granddaughter was a patient there since birth. Neil will be remembered fondly by his children and grandchildren as well as his other family members and friends. He lived a long and fulfilling life and made an impact on many people. He will be remembered as a generous, caring, loving, and a hard-working independent man.\n\nHis family would like to express their sincere gratitude to the VNA Home Care Services and Hospice for the excellent care provided to him in the last few weeks of his life.

She went peacefully, surrounded by her family in the house she built with her husband. Born July 21, 1953, in Pittsburgh, PA, she was the daughter of the late Chalmers and Jesse Gilbert. She is survived by her husband of 45 years, Douglas C. Merle; her children, Nathan (Kristin) Merle, Kristen (Dwight) Hess, and Katie (Nolan) Flores; her grandchildren, Allison & Mason Merle, Rebekah, Raymond, & Ruth Hess, and Levi & Claire Flores; and her brother, Jim (Sandy) Gilbert.\n\nSara led a God-centered life starting as a Christian Education Director. While raising her three children, she felt called to go to Seminary. After graduating from The United Theological Seminary, she became ordained in the United Methodist Church. She had the opportunity to share the Word of God while shepherding the congregations at the United Methodist Churches in North Gainesville, Covington, Knowlesville, Millville, and retiring from Kendall. In retirement, she also spread the Word of God at Carlton and Holley UMC’s. While serving these churches, she was well known for leading the congregations in singing while enthusiastically playing the guitar. She never missed an opportunity to get people involved, which led many to a stronger spiritual awakening.\n\nSara lived a very active life and enjoyed many hobbies over the years including kayaking, fishing, camping, pottery, woodworking, and many different athletic activities. She competed in many events from marathons to Iron Girls, but her proudest achievement was kayaking the “90-miler” in the Adirondack Canoe Classic Race 13 years in a row (over 1,170 miles paddled). She was known to convince members of the church to join in her water adventures as the “Pit Crew” who could be seen outfitted in their “Paddling Pastors” team shirts. When not racing in her kayak, you could find Sara on the water with a fishing pole out at the many campsites in the Adirondacks. On many of their camping trips, Sara shared her passion for the outdoors with her friends, children, and grandchildren. Sara was also a talented potter and woodworker who often made creations for the altar, and gifts for her church members.\n\nSara’s family was the center of her world. She shared her competitive spirit by joining her children in their various athletic events from swimming, to biking, to running. She loved being “Grammy” to her seven grandchildren whom she enjoyed babysitting over the years. She had the great honor of baptizing each of them in their respective churches.\n\nSara was a true Fisher of Men. With our earthly sadness, there is great heavenly joy. She touched many lives while here on earth and will be missed by all who knew her.\n\nPlease join us in celebrating her life on Sunday, August 18th from 1-3 pm and 5-7 pm at the Hilton United Methodist Church, 21 West Ave, Hilton, NY 14468, where her Memorial Service will be held on Monday, August 19th at 11 am.\n\nTo honor Sara’s love of youth ministries, in lieu of flowers, donations can be made to: Tyrand Cooperative Ministries, Inc. , P.O.

Bob was the proud grandfather to Charles, Benton, Grayson, Danny, Bo, and Sarah. He is also survived by numerous in-laws, nieces, and nephews. For Bob, “family is everything!”\n\nBob received his elementary and secondary education in the Bath School District. “Morse High, Morse High, Ra-Ra-Ra!” There, he was a 3-season athlete, playing football, basketball, and baseball and served on student council and yearbook committee. He played a vital role in class reunions and was always so proud of his hometown. He attended Colby College, following in his brother’s footsteps and graduated with a degree in Economics. Bob and Lucie (Philippon) were married in 1960 after being set up on a blind date by mutual friends. Bob joined the U.S. Army, trained in Arizona and was stationed later in Heidelberg, Germany, joined by Lucie. Neither one of them was ever afraid of a new adventure.\n\nBob’s role in the Personnel Department of the US Army led to a lifelong career in Human Resources. He worked numerous manufacturing companies during his career: Oxford Papermill in Rumford, Maine, and Manchester, New Hampshire, Mead Corporation in Cincinnati, Ohio, Hamilton Industries in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, and Special Metals, in New Hartford, New York. His passion was union negotiations and training. During his retirement years along the Saco River in Biddeford, Maine, Bob was a substitute teacher and donned the nicknames “Grandpa Kickball” in PE class and “Mr. Charmin” while monitoring the restrooms.\n\nWith every re-location, Bob and Lucie dove deep into the social scene and established lasting friendships. They both enjoyed playing bridge, tennis, golf, cross-country skiing, and honoring cocktail hour daily. Bob also was involved in numerous clubs and committees like the local Rotary and Elks Clubs, enjoying the roll of Grand Poo-Bah a couple of years.\n\nOf upmost importance in Bob’s life was his family. His wife, children, and grandchildren were the reason for life. Bob had a knack for writing poems for special events, which always had rhyming stanzas and occasionally involved the entire crowd singing along. Not only was he a die-hard Red Sox and Patriots fan, but he was a fierce competitor from cribbage to horseshoes. As he aged and found himself on the sidelines, he was sure to have badminton set up to cheer on his grandchildren. It made him giddy to create scavenger hunts and watch his children prepare for cycling events. “How far did you go today? I think you had some gas left!” Bob always made connections with family members, friends, and even strangers. There was a special place in his heart for true Mainers but could always find a way to connect with all. Bob was loving, was loved, and will always have a place in our hearts.\n\nThere will be no calling hours or funeral service.\n\nPlease leave a condolence, share a story or light a candle at www.bataviafuneralhomes.com.\n\nArrangements for Bob were entrusted to the H.E.
