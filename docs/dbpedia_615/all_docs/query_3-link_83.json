She would pass from this life on November 27, 2023, in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.\n\nJudy was preceded in death by her parents, her sister Helen Guess Rogers, and her brother Robert (Bobby) Guess.\n\nThose left behind to cherish her memories are her sisters Alice Panter and Velma Jost, brother Tommy Guess and wife Margaret, and several nephews, nieces, and cousins.\n\nJudy very much loved life and always had a smile on her face. She was a member of Carter Baptist Church in Parkhill, Oklahoma. She really enjoyed going for rides and eating out. Judy really did find the best in every outcome life threw her way."
