        "text": "David \"Dave\" C. Hermundson, age 77 of Eau Claire passed away Tuesday morning, July 30, 2024 at Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire.\n\nDave was born April 27, 1947, in Durand, WI to Delbert and Rosella (Lindstrom) Hermundson. He grew up farming on Grasshopper Ridge, a bluff by Cream, WI.\n\nDave was baptized and confirmed at Lyster Lutheran Church in Nelson, WI and this is where he met and married the love of his life, Patricia Lynn Serum of Durand, WI on August 9, 1969. They resided in Eau Claire, WI, but enjoyed snow birding to their Peoria, AZ home to enjoy the warm weather and fellowship with friends. They treasured over 54 years together and enjoyed singing many harmonies while Dave played the piano or organ, dancing polkas, summers boating on the Mississippi River at their cottage, traveling to Norway, Europe, Hawaii, Canada, and throughout the US, as well as, raising two children and 3 grandsons. In honor of this beautiful life together, Dave will be laid to rest on their 55th wedding anniversary.\n\nDave graduated from Alma High School, attended Buffalo County Teachers College, and completed his Elementary Education degree from UW-River Falls. He later earned his master’s degree in education from UW-Eau Claire. He was a devoted teacher within the Eau Claire Area School District for 33 years sharing his love of learning at Barstow Elementary, Mt. Washington Elementary, Roosevelt Elementary, and DeLong Middle School until his retirement in 2002. He remained a substitute teacher for 18 years. During this time, he also maintained his real estate license and was a part time realtor.\n\nDave took an active role in his community and maintained a strong faith, which he used in service to others. He was a member of the Sons of Norway Loven 29 Lodge for 38 years, serving in the roles of President and Vice President. He was a member of the Eau Claire Moose Lodge and Eau Claire Mason Lodge. He attended many bible study groups and served for many years in jail ministry. He was a longtime member of Trinity Lutheran Church in Eau Claire where he taught Sunday School. He enjoyed playing piano at First Church of the Nazarene for many years. He cherished the music worship and fellowship attending Augusta Mennonite Church, Clear Water Christian Fellowship Church, as well as, attending Son Valley Christian Fellowship Church during time in Arizona.\n\nHis love of farming remained a lifelong hobby and he purchased an 80-acre hobby farm in 1988 in Mondovi, WI to share this passion with his children and grandchildren. If you knew him, you know that was his ‘happy place’ and where he found the most peace. He was an avid collector of tractors, and many days were spent with family at ‘The Farm’ hunting, gardening, growing pumpkins, having fun, and ensuring his son and grandsons had a place to just ‘be boys’.\n\nDave was loved by his family, church, community, and friends. He was blessed with a quick wit and warm personality and made friends wherever he went. He was a natural nurturer and gave selflessly of himself to care for so many others in so many ways. He was always doing the ‘little things’ each day to make sure everyone special to him knew they were loved and treasured. There was no greater joy to him than his 3 grandsons. He cherished being ‘Papa’ and they agree he was the best at it and made the best chocolate chip cookie bars which he made often. Although he will be forever missed, he left his family an incredible legacy through his example and sacrifice, and we are forever blessed.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Patricia; 2 children Jessica (Nathan) Kopaczewski and Landon (Tianna) Hermundson; 3 grandsons Caleb Kopaczewski, Mitchell Kopaczewski and Dillon Kopaczewski; his brother Roland Hermundson; mother-in-law Cleo (Norby) Serum; and many nieces, nephews, relatives, and friends. He was preceded in death by his parents Delbert and Rosella Hermundson; sister Mary Louise Hermundson; brother Duane Hermundson; father-in-law Orval Serum; aunts, uncles and grandparents.\n\nA memorial service will take place at 12 pm (noon) on Friday August 9, 2024 at Trinity Lutheran Church, 1314 E. Lexington Blvd, Eau Claire, WI 54701 with Pastor Tom Westcott officiating. Memorial visitation will take place at the church on that day from 10 am until the time of service. Committal service will take place at 4 pm later that afternoon in the Lyster Cemetery near Nelson, Wisconsin .
