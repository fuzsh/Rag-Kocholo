He was born on April 27, 1947 in Chicago to the late Frank and Rosemarie (Zarkadas) Sineni.\n\nJim graduated from Lane Technical High School and continued his education at Amundson College. He joined his familyâ€™s construction company as a licensed bricklayer. Beginning at age 25, Jim served the city of Chicago as a police officer for 25 years. Upon retirement, he and his wife, Esther, reaped the benefits of his sweepstake winnings and made everlasting memories on over 72 trips. Jim and Esther spent endless hours attending various sporting events, but Jim was most proud of the sporting events involving his grandchildren.\n\nHe will be watching over his childhood sweetheart, Esther, who he was so proud to be married to for over 55 years; his children, Gina (Renato) Zanichelli; Jennifer (Vince) Concialdi and Renee Santellano; grandchildren, Nic, Lia, Tony, Joey, Vinny, Elena, Johnny and Frankie; 6 siblings and their spouses; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nA Memorial visitation will be held on Sunday, May 5, from 2 PM until 6 PM at Davenport Family Funeral Home and Crematory, 941 S.
