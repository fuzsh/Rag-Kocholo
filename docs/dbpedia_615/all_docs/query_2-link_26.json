        "text": "Former NSW premier Nick Greiner awoke a few painful scars (mercifully, not of the gastric-banding kind) for his former staffer and would-be treasurer Joe Hockey on Wednesday in Canberra.\n\nGreiner was asked at the launch of Ian Hancock’s Nick Greiner: A Political Biography about his dealings with a crossbench during his time in charge of a hung NSW parliament. He said he took a different approach to former PM Julia Gillard. “I never talked to them ... I had other people talk to them,\" Greiner said."
