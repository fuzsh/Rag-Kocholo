        "text": "Statement by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.\n\nAustralia today is mourning the passing of the Hon John Fahey AC.\n\nJohn was an Australian and Liberal original.\n\nTwenty years ago today, Sydney was about to host the Olympics – an event that defined both our city and our nation.\n\nAs John leapt to his feet on hearing the news his Government had secured the Sydney Olympics for Australia, he seemed to be embodying the shared joy of every Australian.\n\nThe securing of the Sydney Olympics by the Fahey Government, by John Fahey, working together with Bruce Baird and Rod McGeogh, in many ways led Australia out of the 1990s recession. It gave Australians hope and belief.\n\nBut it was also the image of John as Premier on his knees at St Mary’s in Sydney as fires ravaged NSW that spoke to his quiet faith and humility.\n\nJohn Fahey was an optimist, who believed in Australia, because he knew how much it had enabled him in his own life.\n\nJohn’s was truly an Australian story of his generation. He gave more than he received. His cheery and cheeky smile was what always left his impression on you, long after the topic or issue had passed.\n\nIn his day, John was not your typical Liberal. A Catholic, rugby league player and smoker from South West Sydney. As a Liberal he broadened our outlook and connected us with an ever widening aspirational population.\n\nHe was notoriously slow at working a room, but that reflected the deep connections John formed with so many he met. John Fahey gave everyone his undivided attention.\n\nJohn described his liberalism as: “hard head, soft heart”. It was an approach he would take as Premier and as Federal Minister for Finance.\n\nAs Federal Minister for Finance, John Fahey, along with John Howard and Peter Costello drove the historic turnaround in Australia’s finances in the late 1990s. As well, they set in train a service revolution in telecommunications.\n\nAfter 17 years in State and Federal politics and a distinguished career of public service, John left politics in 2001 due to ill health. John said at the time: “I want to do some more things. I want to continue to give to the community. I intend to continue to work.”\n\nHe got that wish.\n\nJohn went on to be a director of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, chairman of the Rugby League Development Board and fittingly given his history, chairman of the Sydney Olympic Park Authority. In 2007, John became chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency, one of the most significant sporting administrator roles in the world.\n\nJohn was a tremendous Liberal. He was a mentor to many, including Joe Hockey and Marise Payne.\n\nHe was one of a kind who had an earthy and tested faith and who was sustained by his loved family.\n\nTo John’s wife Colleen, and his surviving children Melanie and Matthew, and his grandchildren Amber and Campbell, Jenny and I extend our deepest condolences.\n\nStatement by former Prime Minister John Howard.\n\nJohn Fahey gave so much to public life: Premier of NSW for three years, five years as Minister for Finance in the Howard Government and, in his final years, as Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University. As Minister for Finance between 1996 and 2001 he was a close and valued colleague of mine. He brought much experience from his time in state politics and with Peter Costello as Treasurer played a major role in bringing the federal budget back into balance.\n\nAfter underoing major surgerg for lung cancer almost 20 years ago, he fought a long battle to maintain his health. During this time he and his wife, Colleen, suffered the tragic loss of their younger daughter Tiffany, and then devoted their lives to raising her two children. Sustained by their strong Catholic faith John and Colleen’s devotion to those children cemented the affection and admiration of their many friends.\n\nJohn Fahey loved sport. None more so than Rugby League. He played at a senior level, and was a loyal supporter of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. After leaving federal politics he served for two terms as president of the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nAustralians will long remember his leap for joy when it was announced that Sydney had won the right to host the 2000 Olympics. John Fahey’s NSW Government had played a major role in winning that bid.\n\nTo Colleen and her children, Janette and I extend our deep sympathy. We honour and thank John for his service."
