        "text": "Les L. Barrickman, DO, ’82, Fairfield, Iowa, died May 10, 2018.\n\nDavid L. Berg, DO, ’68, Chesterfield, Missouri, died July 4, 2018, at age 77. He was born July 24, 1940. He was a graduate of the University of Missouri and ATSU-KCOM. He had a family practice for many years and, after his retirement, was an emergency room physician at DePaul Hospital. He loved boating and was proud to be licensed as a captain by the Coast Guard. He also enjoyed traveling, especially to Germany where he was fluent in German, and was a lover of nature and all things living.\n\nHe was the beloved husband of JoAnn Berg (nee Maniscalco); the dear father of Karen (Rich) Rohrbach, Robin (Alan) Schmidt, and Julieann Berg; a loving grandfather to Chloe Rohrbach, Jonathon Schmidt, Evie Rohrbach, Michael Schmidt, and Mandy Mae Schmidt; brother to Bob (Vicki) Berg; uncle to Brian (Trisha) Berg; and cousin of Larry (Donna) Sage and their children Emily and Josh Prehm and Brianna And Ethan Prehm.\n\nDonald G. Burns, DO, ’55, Middletown, Ohio, died June 28, 2018, at age 88. He was born in Hammersville, Ohio, on March 23, 1930, to J. Forrest and Ella (Leonard) Burns. He was a member of First Presbyterian Church of Middletown where he served as an elder and deacon and was on the Board of Trustees. Dr. Burns received exposure to the possibility of a medical career early on when he worked as an orderly at Middletown Hospital during the summer after he graduated from Kings Mill High School. He helped set fractures and worked in the ER as well. He studied for two years at Miami University and completed his undergraduate degree at Wilmington College. He went on to receive his osteopathic medicine degree from ATSU-KCOM.\n\nAfter being in family practice for six years in Franklin, he decided to pursue an internal medicine residency. Soon after, he realized that an office practice was not for him, he preferred hospital consultation. He recalled that Dr. Bernard Fox suggested he consider pulmonary medicine as a specialty. He took a two-week course in Chicago and was hooked. At that time, pulmonary was just forming into a real specialty area, and as a result, formal medicine training was not readily available. Once again, Dr. Burns’ innovative thinking enabled him to realize his goal. He decided to set up his own five-year program to educate himself on pulmonary medicine. He took courses all over the globe and when he took the American College of Chest Physicians examination, he scored in the 95th percentile. Other accomplishments include serving as medical director of Respiratory Therapy for 31 years, and he was medical director of the sleep lab. He started the Pulmonary department, serving as medical director for 24 years. He served as chair of the Institutional Review Board from 1991 through 1999. In addition, he helped establish Grandview’s first pulmonary medicine fellowship in 1999. Dr. Burns’ hard work and dedication will long be a part of Grandview Medical Center. He was the first osteopathic physician in the U.S. to receive a fellowship from the American College of Chest Physicians.\n\nActive in his retirement, Dr. Burns enjoyed painting and writing and even wrote his autobiography for his grandchildren. He and his wife, Carol, enjoyed spending summers on Drummond Island, Michigan, and visited often with their children and grandchildren. He practiced with Grandview Hospital since 1955 and retired in 2000.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his father, J. Forrest Burns, and mother, Ella Elizabeth Burns. He is survived by his wife, Carol (Dykes) Burns; two daughters, Beth (Michael) Susco and Denise (James) Johnson; nine grandchildren, Dustin (Melinda) Vincent, Amy (Jonathan) Hamilton, Brandon Johnson, Benjamin Johnson, Christopher (Amanda) Johnson, J.

He loved nothing better than sharing a good cup of airport coffee with his fellow pilots. He was active in the Civil Air Patrol. He was a lifelong member of the Shriners and served as president of the Naja Air Patrol and Naja Flying Aces. He and Alma loved their time with the Rapid City Shrine Club and were always at events.

He was active for more than 60 years with Masonic organizations, holding many offices and positions of leadership. He and Alma were lifelong members of the Sturgis Methodist Church, and he especially enjoyed the early morning Men’s Group breakfast, which he rarely missed. In addition, the Elk’s Camping Group and National Camping Travelers (the Masonic camping group) brought them much joy, friendship, and wonderful memories of nearly 50 years of camping and doing community service in the Black Hills. Another one of his many interests was working on electronics. He built his first radio as a teenager and belonged to the HAM radio group for more than 70 years. Dr. Chesnut was an independent and self-contained man, who never met a gadget he didn’t want to fix or build. To quote him: “You want to do something? Buy a book, read it, and accomplish the project.” He and Alma have spent many years researching genealogy, and this resulted in involvement in the Scot-Irish of the Black Hills organization. He and his wife traveled to Scotland and became official members of the Graham Clan. They were guests of the Duke of Montrose, a member of the Graham clan. One of his greatest honors was serving in the South Dakota National Guard. Rising to the rank of colonel, he served 20 years as a flight surgeon.\n\nSurvivors happy to share his life’s journey are his wife, Alma Chesnut; sons, Dr. David Chesnut (Ruth) and Alan Hutchins (Allison); daughters, Cinda Kesler, Linda Blackwell, Susan Maloney (Pete), and Dr. Nancy Babbitt (Steve); sister, Marilyn Litzenberger; and many grandchildren, cousins, nieces, and nephews.

To this day, they continue to discover their special “Mom vocabulary” words like “rizzer” and “boover” don’t appear in the dictionary. Besides being a wonderful clinician, teacher, and mother, she was also a talented musician. Learning from her father, she enjoyed lifelong mastery of the piano, making brief diversions to the French horn in high school, and also the guitar, which she combined with her soprano voice to enchant Tom. She enjoyed many years of singing with the local Sto-Notes community choir, especially when they delivered their annual Christmas season set of performances she called “the nursing home circuit.” In her brief retirement, she finally got to seriously pursue her love of painting and studied, painted, and volunteered at the Cuyahoga Valley Art Center. The home she leaves behind is decorated with her stitchery from the 1980s and her award-winning watercolors of the past several years.\n\nDr. Klingler was preceded in death by her father and mother, Tom and Eva Shank.

He was born Jan. 6, 1925, to Floyd and Hattie Pearson in Everett, Washington, one of 10 siblings. He attended Everett High School and entered the U.S. Navy at age 17, after blithely and unassumingly concealing his true age. This young rapscallion served nearly four years as a Navy medic. As a medic, his Naval ship followed and assisted Marine ships to care for wounded and dying Marines. One of these Marine ships included the battalion that raised an American flag on Mt. Suribachi on the island of Iwo Jima, Japan (he particularly loved to tell people that the iconic Mt. Suribachi photo was staged). He was discharged from the Navy on his 21st birthday, which he later stated was his “best birthday present ever.”\n\nAfter his military service, he married wife Gertrude “Trudy” in 1947. At this time, he very sensibly decided that professional softball would provide a stable and practical career. He followed this dream for three years, but in 1951, decided his medical acumen was more impressive than his fastball, and pursued medical school in Kirksville, Missouri. During this time, he and wife Trudy gave birth to daughters Debbie and Rhonda. He opened his first doctor’s office in 1956, in Federal Way, Washington, and practiced there for 12 years, before relocating and opening a practice in Woodland, Washington.\n\nIn 1968, moving to Woodland, Washington proved to be a challenge of its own. That winter was particularly snowy, and the family endured days without electricity, which tragically forced the family to retrieve ketchup and mustard from under the creek bridge that had been stored there the previous summer to keep it cold for picnics and other family fun. Unable to get down the mountain, food stores getting low, he wanted mustard with his hot dogs and hamburgers that his wife was cooking on the old wood stove and was willing to wade through the deep snow to get it. Luckily, all the condiments persisted through the cold winter and provided deliciousness to summer barbecues. Love and family were the themes of Terreno Madera, his stately Woodland property. Many parties, barbecues, and poolside gatherings were hosted there. He also owned many racehorses throughout the years, which were born and bred on this property; horseracing was a passion and a source of great pride for him. He loved taking his family and friends to Portland Meadows to delight in the lucrative grace that is horseracing. Many guests enjoyed the festive atmosphere and fiscal advantages afforded by a day at the track.\n\nGrandchildren were a joy for him; he had three by 1981. Tragically in 1982, wife Trudy died very unexpectedly, leaving the family heartbroken. Fortunately, Dr. Pearson had the strength and love of family to help guide him through this devastating time, and in 1985 married Sofia. Over the next 20 years, four additional grandchildren were born, as well as a growing crop of great-grandchildren. Everyone who knew him, knew he loved babies; the regular addition of toothless, infantile family members soothed out the hurt from Trudy and allowed him to live very peacefully and proudly in his golden years. He was extremely proud. He loved Just-for-Men, and it took a long time before he reconciled with his receding hairline. He nearly rivaled Liberace in the bling department. What made him the proudest was his family. He built his entire life for his family to enjoy, and it was an extraordinary life he built.\n\nHe was preceded in death by wife, Gertrude (Trudy); siblings, Armand, Marvene, Peggie, Gaylord, Beryl, Virginia, Gene, Derrald, and Doyle; daughter, Rhonda; and grandson, Jeffrey Upkes. He is survived by daughter, Deborah Bailey (Bill); son, John; daughter, Tamara Flatz; and grandchildren, Rick (Karen) Bartlett, T.J. (Megan) Orthmeyer, Brandon and Derek Berezo, John “Charlie” Pearson, and Miranda Flatz.\n\nRobert P. Poetz, DO, ’63, Chesterfield, Missouri, died April 10, 2018. He was the son of the late Marie Meyer and Paul Poetz and brother to Rita (Irv) Haislar and Rev. Donald Poetz. He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Mary Jean Poetz, and their their children, Lisa, Paul, Teresa, Amy, Alexandria, Devin, and Ashley. He was preceded in death by his son, Douglas.\n\nDr. Poetz practiced family medicine in North St. Louis County for 55 years. He trained multiple young physicians during this time. At the end of his life, he chose to give back by donating his body to St. Louis University School of Medicine.\n\nSteven Reichenbach, AuD, ’07, Murrieta, California, died Jan. 6, 2015.\n\nKevin L. Rhodes, DO, Kirksville, Missouri, died June 18, 2018, at age 45. Born Feb. 23, 1973, in Hannibal, Mo., he was the son of Michael Lee and Deborah Sue (Engle) Rhodes, who survive. He is also survived by one brother, Steve Rhodes and his wife, Lisa Renze-Rhodes; one sister, Kristi Rhodes; a grandmother, Lillian Engle; an uncle, Pat Rhodes and his wife, Terry; an aunt, Colleen Jones and her husband, Rick; and two cousins, Bryan Jones and his wife, Christina, and Nathan Jones. He was preceded in death by his grandparents, Don and Doris Rhodes and Lloyd Engle.\n\nDr. Rhodes was family focused and took great delight in spending time with his loved ones on family vacations, golf outings, and holidays and other special occasions. He was a dedicated internal medicine physician at Northeast Regional Medical Group in Kirksville where he worked largely with elderly patients for most of the past decade. In addition to his practice, Dr. Rhodes taught at ATSU-KCOM where he was an assistant professor in the Department of Internal Medicine, and he taught resident physicians.\n\nHe earned a fellowship with the American College of Osteopathic Internists in 2010, was board certified with the American College of Osteopathic Internists in 2003, and trained in diagnostic endoscopy and wound clinic procedures. He earned his medical school degree at the Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences in 2000. He was a 1995 graduate of Northwest Missouri State University and a 1991 graduate of Mark Twain High School.\n\nSpencer Schaeffer, DO, ’69, Natick, Massachusetts, died July 9, 2018, at age 79. He was born July 27, 1938, in Brooklyn, New York, to Elsa and Philip Schaeffer. His team was the Ebbets Field Brooklyn Dodgers. His Brooklyn roots were strong with existing friendships that go back 77 years. He loved music from classical to rock and roll, but Simon and Garfunkel meant home to him.\n\nHe started reading at age 2 and never stopped. He was a prolific reader of novels, news, medical journals, poetry, and articles about science and osteopathy. He was always seeking better ways to serve his patients. He was a lifelong learner, and he loved teaching. Sharing knowledge was essential to him. One of his specialties was osteopathic cranial manipulation, which transformed the lives of many patients. As one patient wrote in a thank you, “After my head injury, you put Humpty Dumpty back together again and returned me to work and life again.” Patients were the center of his universe while he was with them.\n\nHe relished the puzzle of diagnosing and the joy of treating and helping people. He was a Scrabble master and New York Times Crossword Puzzle enthusiast, which he enjoyed doing with others, sharing the solving fun. As friend said, “A brilliant person that didn’t need to prove his genius.” Another added, “He takes the art, appreciation, and joy of eating good food to new heights. I don’t know anyone with whom I’d rather share a meal.” Known for his quick wit and ability to find the humor in life and appreciate it with a full belly laugh, he was a steadfast and generous friend. For him, seeing new places, eating new foods, and exploring new cultures was a joy, not to be missed.\n\nHe graduated from ATSU-KCOM in 1969 and completed an internship in Dayton, Ohio, in 1969-70. He had a private practice in the greater Boston area from 1970 with general practice and then specializing in osteopathic manipulative medicine from 1981-2018. He held the following positions: faculty, University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine; adjunct faculty, Sutherland Teaching Association; past president of the New England Academy of Osteopathy; Cranial Academy Board of Examiners Certification of Competency; lecturer, Tufts University School of Dental Medicine in the Temroromandibular Joint Program. Memberships included American Osteopathic Association, American Academy of Osteopathy, Osteopathic Cranial Academy, and Massachusetts Osteopathic Society.\n\nHe is survived by the love of his life for 45 years, his wife, Lydia, and son, Benjamin. He is also survived by son, Andrew; daughters, Stephanie Schaeffer and Patricia Schaeffer Straub; two grandsons; and one granddaughter. Dr. Schaeffer also leaves behind his brother, Bruce, and his wife, Susan, and niece, Sara.\n\nThomas F. Sheffer, DO, ’51, Schaumburg, Illinois, died June 14, 2018, at age 92. Dr. Sheffer was born June 29, 1925, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, to Horace M. and Myrl Fox Sheffer. He was the second of the four Sheffer children: Frank was the eldest, and Harry came after him. Both are deceased. His youngest sibling, Carolyn Fondrk, survives him.\n\nHe was raised in western Pennsylvania, and it was while living in Darlington that he fell in love with Frances McGaffick at a church event when she was 14 and he was 16. He graduated from Darlington High School in 1943 and eventually graduated from Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. His studies were interrupted when he was drafted by the U.S. Army in May 1945. He was deployed to the Pacific theatre during World War II, spending time in the Philippines and Japan before returning to the U.S. in October 1946.\n\nHe went on to study medicine at ATSU-KCOM, where he received his doctorate in 1951. He married his high school sweetheart, Fran, on Jan. 25, 1950, as soon as she graduated from nurse’s training. While doing his internship in Grove City, Pennsylvania, their first child, Gregory Thomas, was born. They moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1952, where he opened a family medical practice in association with the Las Olas Hospital. Their daughters were born there: Becky in 1953, Karen in 1954, and Sherry in 1960. While in Florida, he was active in the Grace Brethren Church, the local Youth for Christ club and the Optimist Club. It was in 1977 that he was recruited by the U.S. Air Force, where he proudly served until his retirement as a full-bird colonel in 1993. He served at Moody AFB (Valdosta, Georgia), Tinker AFB (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma), Reese AFB (Lubbock, Texas), and Keesler AFB (Biloxi, Mississippi). He often said it was one of the best decisions he ever made. But, by far the very best decision was placing his faith in Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior in 1968 at age 43. Besides being very active in his local church (teaching Sunday School, going on medical missions trips or helping at the rescue mission), he was also a member of Gideons International.\n\nHe is survived by his devoted wife (of 68 years), Fran. If ever there was an example of a beautiful marriage, it was theirs. He is also survived by his children and their spouses: Greg (Mariellen) Sheffer and their nine children, Becky (Kent) Good, Karen (Keith) Riffel and their six children, and Sherry (James) Brady and their two children. Finally, he is survived by 21 great-grandchildren (and counting). After spending most of their retirement years in Oklahoma, they moved to Friendship Village in Schaumburg, Illinois, in 2013 to be closer to family and greatly enjoyed being part of that community and the Bethel Baptist Church.\n\nJames D. “Don” Smith, DO, ’70, Kirksville, Missouri, died April 20, 2018, at age 77. The son of the late James A. Smith and Mary Lou Laws Smith, was born Sept. 26, 1940, in California. He is also preceded in death by his sister-in-law, Carol Faye Smith. He is survived by two brothers, Paul Smith and Tom Smith (Linda Smith); his children, Serece Sumners (Peter Sumners) and Nathan Smith (Shalini Smith); grandchildren, Peter and Grant Sumners and Samuel and Sophia Smith, as well as many nieces and nephews.\n\nDr. Smith was a 1958 graduate of Ravanna High School in Ravanna, Missouri, as well as Northwest Missouri State University in Maryville, Missouri, and ATSU-KCOM in 1970. He worked as a physician, proudly healing residents of northeast Missouri for more than 40 years including making house calls until the day he retired.\n\nHe loved the outdoors, fishing, hunting, making people laugh, motorcycles, his lifelong gun collection, and spending time with family and grandkids. He was an active member of many organizations. Some of his favorites were Deputy Sheriff of Adair County, Shrine Club, Ducks Unlimited, various community and hospital and peer review boards, National Rifle Association, city clerk of Princeton, Missouri, and Missouri Department of Conservation.\n\nWallace B. Snowfleet, DO, ’56, Muskegon, Michigan, died May 25, 2018, at age 95. Dr. Snowfleet was born March 30, 1923, in Muskegon to Jess and Peggy (Hazekamp) Snowfleet. He served our country in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was training to be a rescue plane pilot for those shot down in the ocean. After returning home, he embarked on his journey into the medical field. He graduated from ATSU-KCOM and went on to become an osteopathic doctor. He had a general practice for 17 years and worked with Veterans Affairs for another 17 years, retiring in 1988. On Sept. 15, 1975, he married the former Carol Marie Beauvais, and she survives him. They shared a passion for sailing that they enjoyed for many years. He was a member of the Muskegon Osteopathic Physicians as well as the Muskegon Seventh Day Adventist Church, where he had served as a deacon.\n\nIn addition to Carol, his wife of 42 years, he is survived by his children, Scott Snowfleet, Holly Cassel, Bart (Phu Anh Le) Snowfleet, Donald (Julie) Seaman, and Nancy Seaman; six grandchildren, Alyson, Jesse, Daisha, Meagan, Jordan, and Bailey; three great-grandchildren, Corbin, Demitri, and Kaiya; and several nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his parents; his former wife, Patricia Lynn VanBeukering; and his brother, Jim Snowfleet.\n\nTimothy M. Thompson, DO, ’91, St. Louis, Missouri, died Aug. 9, 2018, at age 62. He was welcomed into the rollicking household of parents Charlotte Hanson Thompson and Morris Milholland Thompson (president of ATSU-KCOM from 1943-73) and four siblings on Oct. 30, 1955, in Kirksville, Missouri. Their maternal aunt, Helen Darnell, and her daughter, Linda Darnell, resided with them for a time and remained quite close. Tragically, they lost their mother in 1963. Their father later married Martha Jane Herboth, and the family immediately expanded with two more sisters.\n\nDr. Thompson attended Kirksville Public Schools and Missouri Military Academy, graduating Kirksville Senior High School in 1974 before joining the U.S. Navy where he served proudly as a medical corpsman. After the Navy, Titan Oil recruited him as a medic for off-shore oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. During this time, he attended the University of Southwestern Louisiana. His quality care, work ethic, and charisma earned him steady promotions leading him to head the Department of Human Resources. He then turned his years in the medical field to the pursuit of his real dream to become a physician. He attended Northeast Missouri State University (Truman State University) before attending ATSU-KCOM where he earned his doctor in osteopathic medicine degree in 1991. He completed his internship and residency at Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital in Michigan, attaining certification in emergency medicine in 1997. In 1998, he relocated to St. Louis where he found the home that suited him perfectly, both professionally and personally. He served several hospitals and organizations in the St. Louis area, and most recently joined Barnes Healthcare Management. His patients loved him, and he enjoyed the opportunity to build relationships with them, which was a welcome contrast to the nature of emergency care.\n\nDr. Thompson treasured his hometown friends and a myriad of friends from all over the world. His varied interests afforded him this blessing. One of his favorite pastimes was riding his Harley, not only in the St. Louis area but also throughout the USA. He was an ardent Cardinals and Blues fan and supported the Rams with enthusiasm. His colorful fishing stories from Costa Rica and adventures in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, are legend. Friends might agree his golf escapades are also noteworthy.\n\nHe was confirmed in the Episcopal church in Kirksville and attended St. Timothy’s in Creve Coeur. He supported and served several charities and professional organizations and was proud to be a veteran and a life member of the Harley Owners Group. He loved his family. The blended nature of his family did not hamper close relationships with his six siblings. Neither time nor distance dimmed or diminished the importance to him of each one. Though he himself had no children, he cherished his nieces and nephews. They will remember his genuine interest and commitment to them for the rest of their lives.\n\nSurviving him are his siblings, Martha (Richard G.) Andersen, S.F. Bud (Cindy) Thompson, Helen Laughery, and Chelsea (Glenn) Berry; cousin, Linda Darnell Dripps; nieces, Chandrika Collins, Brenda Weinke, Kelly Frohbose, Martha Christine Laughery, Sarah McAuley, Shelley Henderson, and Laura Andersen; nephews, Scott Henderson, Joel Andersen, Jeff Meyer, and Stephen Meyer; grand-nieces, Tesla Anne Henderson, Zoe Greiner, Stella McAuley, Sadie McAuley, Jaclyn Weinke, Janelle Weinke, Anne Garland Free, and Allison Winstead; and grand-nephews, Jacob Greiner, Nathan Greiner, Chase Standen, Boston Collins, Branden Weinke, and Noah Andersen.

He then married Doris Kleinknecht on Feb. 11, 1976, in Harbor Beach. Doris preceded him in death on March 28, 2008.\n\nDr. Young continued his father’s medical practice, joining him in 1961 in Harbor Beach, and practiced for more than 30 years. He was a Huron County Deputy Medical Examiner for several years. He enjoyed sailing and camping in his leisure time, word puzzles, whittling with woodcarvings, and was a drummer in the Cattail Bay Muskrats Band for many years. He was a member of the Michigan Osteopathic Association. He loved his Pomeranian dogs. He is survived by his children, Kathy (Darren) Bonathan, Kurt (Marcia) Young, and Karen (Tim) McPherson; eight grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.\n\nMelvyn Ziegler, DO, ’63, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, died Jan. 16, 2018, at age 79.
