        "text": "From 2011 to June 2016, I worked full time as a lead instructor of youth programs for Ancestral Knowledge, a DC–area non-profit that offers nature, survival and primitive skills programs for all ages.\n\nI then transitioned to working independently and serving new clients - directly with homeschool groups and with local institutions like Compass Homeschool Enrichment in Oakton, VA, and the Metaphor Academic Center for Russian Language and Culture in Falls Church, VA. I was raised in a bilingual household, and love to share my translations of favorite Russian tales at my programs.\n\nIn Fall of 2016 I started the Natural Leaders program, which transitioned to a student-run format in Fall 2017 and continues to evolve.\n\nThe kids we work with range from those who have never stepped off a trail before, to those who are very comfortable in the woods. Regardless, they have a blast, and learn about the plants, birds, trees, animals and ecology of their area, and how they can take care of themselves in nature for fun or survival.\n\nGone is the time when most kids spent most days running free, building forts and tree houses, splashing in the creek and getting dirty outside. Our programs help fill that void. Students follow their innate desire to experience nature, while learning valuable skills and natural-history from an expert mentor.\n\nI've been exploring nature and field guides for about as long as I can remember - at least since Kindergarten. Until the 3rd grade, I attended the Rudolf Steiner School in New York City. In middle and high school I volunteered at the National Zoo, and was also mentored through the Wilderness Awareness School (WAS) Kamana Naturalist Training program (correspondence course).\n\nAfter high school, I spent two years teaching white-water canoeing and kayaking, rock-climbing, rappelling, spelunking and other outdoor programs for the Montgomery County government in Maryland. At that time I also studied survival, tracking and primitive skills at Tom Brown Jr.’s Tracker School and was trained in teaching this knowledge at the Wilderness Awareness School's Art of Mentoring classes.\n\nDuring my college years, I taught wilderness living skills at a summer camp and in a semester-long class at a middle school. My adventures in those years also included months of living in a primitive cabin on a Potomac river island, exploring Siberian wilderness, and hunting bones in Yellowstone National Park as part of someone's PhD dissertation.\n\nWhile living in Nevada after college, I collected plant and animal data as an environmental biologist in the mountains and deserts.\n\nI received my BS in Biology from Georgetown University in 2007, and an MS in Environmental Science from University of Nevada, Las Vegas in 2008. I live in Alexandria, VA with my wife May Joy, daughters Mira-Nicole and Sofia, and son Victor.\n\nAs the founder's spouse and a homeschooling mom, May Joy has played a critical part in the creation and evolution of Natural Leaders through her support, encouragement, insights and ideas.\n\nMay Joy has worked extensively in the field alongside Nick for many years, and also alongside Trevor and Rhys at times.\n\nMay Joy grew up in Manila, Philippines, starting life in a tiny house with a dirt floor, that she shared with 4 brothers. Arguably she has the most authentic survival experience of the NL team - she remembers cooking a small bird for food, collecting firewood for cooking, and storing rain as a main water source....\n\nHer mother moved to the U.S. when May Joy was only 4, and her living standards gradually improved thanks to her mother's earnings abroad.\n\nSince emigrating at age 17, May Joy has come to love America, the great outdoors, and the Russian culture of her in-laws.\n\nMay Joy met Nick at a community college and served in the U.S. Air Force for 5 years.\n\nMay Joy is a great cook, mother and wife; she's a great observer of student-teacher dynamics, and an excellent mentor to those around her - of all ages.\n\nTrevor has had the privilege of working with Natural Leaders since Fall of 2017, leading homeschool and summer programs, as well as piloting the first ever Wilderness Survival Immersion in 2019. In addition to leading programs in the field, Trevor serves as Director of Operations, and works to enhance NL's policies, procedures, curriculum, instructor training and more. With his move to Denver, CO in summer 2021, Trevor aims to pioneer Natural Leaders' Mountain branch. He is a certified Wilderness First Responder through WMI.\n\nTrevor began his relationship with the natural world exploring the creeks, forests, and lakes of Reston, Virginia. After graduating from New York University in 2011, Trevor found himself living and working in the concrete jungle as a music video, web series, and commercial director. While excited by his creative pursuits, he knew that a life surrounded by steel and concrete would not be sustainable. In 2014 he decided to enroll in a 28 day survival immersion course with Boulder Outdoor Survival School (BOSS) in Utah's canyon country -- a dream he had since childhood.\n\nAfter enduring a month in the wilderness with little more than a knife and water bottle, Trevor knew that returning to his strictly front-country life in the city was no longer possible. In 2016, in an effort to combine his passions and skillsets, he and his partner Julie decided to leave NYC, return to northern Virginia, thru-hike the Appalachian Trail and film a documentary of their journey. Their film, The Leavers, is currently in post-production.\n\nAdditionally, Trevor began spending his summers apprenticing and later instructing with BOSS. There he practices and teaches skills including friction fire, backcountry navigation, hand fishing, animal processing, knife safety and use, Positive Impact practices and more. Working with adult groups in challenging wilderness settings for weeks at a time, Trevor learned to appreciate the infinite possibilities brought about by group social dynamics. Learning to facilitate leadership, growth and cohesion in this setting, at both the individual and group levels, has greatly informed his approach to guiding with Natural Leaders.\n\nThrough his pursuits in both outdoor education and filmmaking Trevor hopes to gently inspire others to rekindle and deepen their relationship with the natural world.\n\nHe believes that instilling nature awareness and appreciation at a young age is vital to the health and well-being of both humans and the planet.\n\nI was born and raised in Monterrey, a large industrial city that lies at the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico. It is called “The City of the Mountains” because of its striking topography, famous for its warm weather and even warmer people. I loved it there, but I remember wanting to learn about other cultures and dreaming of traveling the world since very early on.\n\nI grew up tightly involved in Scouting, which encouraged my curiosity for nature and fueled my will to explore. My weekends were spent hiking and camping in the beautiful mountains and canyons, building friendships that last to this day over campfires and forging skills that helped shape who I am today. I have been a part of this wonderful international movement for most of my life, now also having served as a Scout Master back in my home country and as a District Volunteer here in Virginia. More recently, I had the amazing chance of working at the World Scout Jamboree in West Virginia as a Sub-Camp Commissioner as part of the International Service Team, an unbelievable multicultural experience where I oversaw youth from all over the globe and helped coordinate logistics.\n\nMy teaching journey began after I had the awesome opportunity to tutor for a homeschooling family while living on the windward side of the breathtaking island of Oahu, in Hawaii, an experience that was in many ways a watershed for me. After that, I fully embraced my passion for teaching. I had the honor of earning my teacher certification from the University of Cambridge through the British Council, the United Kingdom’s international education organization. This launched a career I have enjoyed immensely, opening doors for me to teach Elementary and Jr. High School, along with giving Business English lessons at corporate level and developing my own ESL summer workshop for young learners.\n\nLife brought me to Northern Virginia a few years ago, where I got married and now live with my husband and our two dogs. In this new adventure I have been growing greatly and further expanding my training, among other things, recently getting recertified by the Red Cross in Wilderness and Remote First Aid and Youth Protection by the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nBeing a part of Natural Leaders allows me to share what I enjoy doing the most. Knowing all I’ve gained from programs like this, I fully believe in the positive impact what we do can have on our students. With this incredible team I get to help reconnect our new generations with the natural world. We play together and we learn together. We are forming confident children, helping them develop our same great sense of respect and love for the outdoors, become resourceful and self-reliant and most importantly, cultivate leadership while understanding the value and importance of teamwork.\n\nWhile leading with NL, Debbie is currently working towards certification with Virginia Master Naturalists and a dual Master's degree in Neuroeducation & Capacity Optimization with the Instituto Superior de Estudios Psicológicos from Spain and Education with emphasis on Neurolearning from Instituto Superior de Educación in Mexico.\n\nTeaching kids in nature is one of the most rewarding things I've ever done. I learned this in my first job after college, as a wilderness trip leader. I graduated art school in 2012, and began outdoor leadership training for Wilderness Adventure at Eagle Landing, an adventure center in the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nFor two years I led backpacking trips and instructed many adventure sports, like mountain biking and kayaking. Since then I've worked with groups on trail, in classrooms as substitute teacher, and at youth centers for the Navy's Morale Welfare and Recreation program.\n\nOne of my passions is white water kayaking, once taking a swift-water rescue course as a birthday present to myself. I've also taken Wilderness First Aid, and Red Cross CPR/First Aid.\n\nThe path of learning never ends! Survival skills, leadership, and nature observation is our program, but I'll support kids in every positive way I can. During class we will build respect, communication, work ethic, and a positive attitude.\n\nIn 2016 I became a dad, and have a family of my own. I will try to build our community the best I can, and encourage these kids to become well-rounded individuals. Kids learn and grow so fast, and respectfully understanding the natural world is priceless. I'm honored to help in this way.\n\nI grew up in Reston, Virginia where I was fortunate to always have access to the woods, trails, lakes, and wildlife. It wasn’t until I left for college and headed to New York City that I realized how integral the natural world is to my well being and what I value. While working in university administration, I earned my master’s degree from NYU in Environmental Conservation Education where I focused on child development, forest and nature preschools, ecopsychology, permaculture, and community systems.\n\nAfter my time in the concrete jungle, I worked on an organic vegetable farm, thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail with my husband (Trevor), helped produce our subsequent documentary film, then served as Director at a nature preschool in Northern Virginia. Our recent adventures brought us out to the Colorado Rockies and we’re excited to explore a new region while growing programs with Natural Leaders.\n\nI am thrilled for the opportunity to bring my organizational, systems-oriented approach to support the mission of Natural Leaders. I’m always inspired by tales from the field – the little sparks of joy and confidence that nature-as-teacher abundantly provides when we pay attention. Working with instructors and facilitating experiences for families that bring them in closer connection with the natural world is my passion and I love being part of growing relationships that build resilient communities.\n\nSkylar Lima\n\n​Lead Guide\n\nI originally hail from Los Angeles, CA and was homeschooled up until the age of 17. Throughout my youth, I was a member of my local Boy Scout troop and earned my Eagle rank in 2012. I remained in my troop long after aging out, continuing to volunteer as an adult leader. Upon earning my AA degree, I transferred to Humboldt State in Northern California, where I earned my BA in Recreation Administration with an emphasis in Outdoor Adventure. Since then I have traveled in New Zealand, guided youth on high adventure trips in the Carolinas, and worked at an outdoor education center in Colorado!\n\nI have always loved being in the outdoors, and being able to share the outdoors (and relevant skills) has always been a passion for me. Natural Leaders drew me in with the opportunity to continue to feed this passion, explore new regions and places, meet new people, and reconnect to my roots with the homeschooling community.\n\nIn my free time, I love to explore new places, whether that is day-hiking, backpacking, camping, taking my mountain bike on dirt trails, or unfolding my oru kayak and taking to the local waterways.\n\nMy adult adventures started in my neighborhood creeks and parks, much like Natural Leaders students. As a young person I was involved in sports, drama camps, scouting, and family camping trips. At age 10, I hosted a birthday party which included a creek cleanup competition that removed a pile of litter and even a car axle, local news wrote about it, and the city council recognized our efforts. I have been encouraging others to explore and protect nature since.\n\nI grew up attending public and private schools, around the DC metro area which exposed me to a variety of learning environments. Some of my favorites have been outdoors - especially the Chesapeake Bay, Monongahela NF, Shenandoah NP, and the White Mountain NF. My adventures, as well as my life in the DC region, have aided me in persevering through adversity. When life gets complicated, the simple reminders of life outdoors can be invaluable prompts to recognize hazards, resources, and attitudes as we mature alongside others and the world around us.\n\nIn high school, I was selected for recognition as a distinguished honor cadet (top 3%) in the 1st Region AJROTC and the school’s rifle team by my senior year. One of my first jobs work for the NCAC of the Boy Scouts of America. I attended the National Camping School where I instructed scouts and staff in several skill areas including rifle, shotgun, muzzle loading firearms (think early 1800’s), and staffing the COPE (Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience) ropes courses. I enjoyed facilitating these experiences where students had memorable connections to what they were learning - they overcame fears, gained knowledge, and progressed in understanding their own abilities when faced with challenges.\n\nOver the years I picked up outdoor skills in mountain biking, rock climbing, backpacking, conservation, snow sports, orienteering, camping, ropes courses, shooting sports, and more. Much of my professional experience has been in technical problem solving, customer service, outfitting, and instructing. In college I studied automotive science and elected to take First Responder for the Professional Rescuer course as my health credit; I found the problem-solving skills of medical diagnostics very complimentary to the rest of my endeavors. I continue to seek additional learning opportunities in emergency preparedness.\n\n​Osk grew up wandering the foothills of Lágafell and Esjann in Iceland.\n\nMore recently, she can often be found wandering the beautiful scenic trails in Northern Virginia with her husband, children and Labrador Retriever. Osk has been homeschooling her two children and teaching science and nature classes at various homeschool co-ops, enrichment programs, and private schools since 2013. She led a weekly forest school playgroup for preschoolers when her son was younger where she discovered the joy and magic of the outdoor classroom. An avid nature-lover at heart, she enjoys hiking, camping, kayaking and exploring new places. She tries to visit Iceland as often as she can to walk the rich and beautiful mountains and experience the incredible geological activity there. She considers herself a student of the natural world, and ever enjoys the role of student and teacher.\n\nOsk is certified as a Wilderness First Responder, a Virginia Master Naturalist, and is very excited to be a part of the Natural Leaders team. She delights in combining her deep love and respect for the natural world with her earnest joy in facilitating deep learning for children and looks forward to working with your children.\n\n​I grew up homeschooled with a big family in a house in MD with woods and farms miles around us. So naturally, 85% of my childhood was spent outdoors. My favorite part about it was all the tasty plants I'd eat. Somehow intuitively I knew which were poisonous and which were not and never got sick. High-school is when I got leadership and survival experience doing military camps and activites but only in the past three years have I really begun to further my relationship with nature and the spirits of plants and fungi. I began mushroom foraging in the fall of 2019 learning many new trees, plants and natural phenomena along the way and learning about their symbiotic relationships. I am very interested in nature and all living matter on this earth and how us humans can thrive with them thriving next to us. I hope to teach and guide your child toward that relationship as well.\n\nI'm currently in school studying child psychology/education at UMBC. While I'm not outside hiking, biking, foraging, rock climbing or exploring I am inside reading, cooking, learning guitar, or writing. I am also very spiritual so I spend lots of time meditating or practicing yoga to connect deeper with myself and this world and all its' inhabitants around us.\n\nI have been working with kids in afterschool programs, summer camps, volunteer programs, and survival/military programs since 2017 but none have filled me with as much joy as this one. I am grateful for you sending your kids to us and allowing them the space to get comfortable and fall in love with the outdoors so they can create a more green and happy planet in the future.\n\nLauren Jardine\n\n​Guide\n\nI grew up in New York, hiking, camping and being in the woods whenever I could. As a former Waldorf student, I learned the importance of having hands on, in-depth education that allows you to fully connect to your surroundings. I got my first job teaching snowboarding at fifteen and have been working in the outdoors ever since.\n\nI graduated with my B.S in Environmental Interpretation and Park Management for Penn State in 2020 which has allowed me to work and teach all over the country as an environmental educator. In the last few years I’ve worked as a naturalist, ropes course instructor, backpacking guide, and travel instructor which included everything from taking my students paddling on the Suwannee River, to night hikes in Big Bend, to snorkeling in Belize. My time as a naturalist allowed me to hone my skills facilitating experiences for others where they can deepen their connections to the natural world and cherish their relationship to it.\n\nI have a love for history, mythology and story telling that furthers my ability to connect with the places and people around me.\n\nIm excited for the year ahead at Natural Leaders to give the students the opportunity to create their own meaningful relationship with nature, learn some great skills and have a fulfilling experience that helps us all grow.\n\nAndrew Ratliff\n\n​Guide\n\nThe son of a foreign service officer, Andrew spent his childhood in Thailand and Japan, attending a Marianist private school through 5th Grade and was a member of Scout Troop #1. Upon moving to Annandale, VA, Andrew, his three brothers, and neighborhood friends spent countless hours exploring and playing in the woods along Holmes Run (including soccer games at Roundtree Park), as well as camping with his family at Burke Lake and Shenandoah National Park.\n\nA father of two (now young adults), he was enriched by guiding their intellectual curiosity, involvement in scouting, sports, theater, Odyssey of the Mind, chorus competitions, field trips, and wrangling big groups of kids for birthday parties, playdates, and sleepovers.\n\nAll while having a successful career in the event marketing field. The pandemic shut down the exhibits industry, so Andrew took the opportunity to spend lots of that unexpected free time in nature, indulging in a passion for wildlife photography, hiking, and exploring the abundant parks and refuges all around the Greater DC Metro region and beyond. In three years of semi-retirement switching from a desk job to working outdoors, fostering “Adventure, Independence, and Courage” was a much better fit!\n\nAndrew graduated Summa Cum Laude with a B.A. in Organizational Communications from the University of Central Florida\n\n​\n\nI grew up in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, taking for granted that I couldn’t see any other buildings in view from my home. I didn’t understand until much later that many people can spot only a few stars at night, if any, and not the hundreds salting the sky where I lived. Now, as an adult, I embrace wild spaces with both enthusiasm and healthy respect.\n\nMy interests have been eclectic throughout the years. I got a degree in Mathematics from William and Mary, spent my twenties writing novels, and took up woodworking a few years ago. These days my primary focus is homeschooling my two kids, which was how I first discovered Natural Leaders. During Covid, my teaching adventure included a Zoom class on Ancient Technologies, which quickly became a new favorite topic of mine.\n\nMy initial experiences with Natural Leaders were on the parent side - my oldest son has been part of the homeschool program for a few years, and both of my kids have participated in summer camps. The more I experienced the program as a mom, the more I grew to appreciate it. Not only were my kids learning new skills and growing in confidence, I was absorbing a lot of the education too! Curiosity piqued, I would often try my hand at the skills they were practicing, bringing half-finished projects to drop-off to get tips from our Guide. After about a dozen of these he asked how I felt about teaching small groups in the woods, and the rest is history!\n\nMy favorite part of leading children into the forest is watching the moments of delighted discovery when they come across an animal track or insect or unusual tree formation. While they also take in so much about outdoor survival and build life skills in the process, one of the greatest gifts they receive is wide-eyed wonder for the natural world. I’m thrilled to be part of that adventure."
