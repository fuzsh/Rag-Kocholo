His tenure commenced with the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001, which shaped his foreign policy and led to the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Domestically, Bush enacted tax cuts and promoted education reform through the No Child Left Behind Act. His second term was dominated by efforts to manage two ongoing wars and respond to the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. After leaving office, Bush retreated from politics to focus on philanthropy and writing. He established the George W.
