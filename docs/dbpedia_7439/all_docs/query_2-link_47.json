        "text": "U.S., 1984\n\nDirected by Miloš Forman\n\nStarring F. Murray Abraham, Tom Hulce, Elizabeth Berridge, Roy Dotrice\n\nScreenplay adapted by Peter Shaffer from his 1979 stage play of the same name.\n\nProduced by Saul Zaentz\n\nApprox. 158 min. 35mm print courtesy Museum of Modern Art.\n\nForman collected another Oscar for best director, along with awards for best picture and six others, for this rousing adaptation of Peter Shaffer’s stage play about the rivalry between the composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham). In telling the story through Salieri’s perspective, “Amadeus” becomes a drama about deranged jealousy and betrayal as Salieri fumes over his prodigious counterpart, who is seen as immature and unworthy of his superior talent. Yet through the heat of Salieri’s contempt, Mozart’s compositions come alive with fresh urgency: AMADEUS isn’t a stodgy costume piece for classical music fans only, it’s a gripping drama about a divine gift and its costs. – Scott Tobias, The New York Times\n\nReviews\n\n“This is Mozart as an eighteenth-century Bruce Springsteen, and yet (here is the genius of the movie) there is nothing cheap or unworthy about the approach.”\n\n– Roger Ebert"
