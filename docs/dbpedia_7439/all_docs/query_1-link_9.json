        "text": "“This was a music I’d never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing… It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God.”\n\nJoin us at the Rio Theatre as for the director’s cut of one of the 1980’s most acclaimed films; the lush, lavish, and endlessly entertaining AMADEUS. Based on Peter Shaffer’s 1979 play, the film swept the board at the Oscars – winning a total of eight trophies (including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor for F. Murray Abraham) – and marking it as one of that decade’s most notable films.\n\nThe film follows the life, success, and troubles of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce, in a truly career-defining performance) as told by Antonio Salieri, the middling (if not “mediocre”) contemporary composer who was deeply tormented by his own jealousy of Mozart’s divine talent, and claimed to have murdered him. Also starring Elizabeth Berridge, Roy Dotrice, Simon Callow, Christine Ebersole, Cynthia Nixon, Jeffrey Jones.\n\n“A lavish, entertaining, powerful film about the life and influence, both positive and negative, of one of Western culture’s great artists.” (Rotten Tomatoes)\n\n“Forman’s tormented, iconoclastic subjects are often pitted against iconic or impersonal antagonists, but Amadeus’ conflict remains rivetingly intimate, in spite of its sumptuous, larger-than-life settings.” (AV Club)\n\n“Arguably the finest movie ever made about the process of artistic creation and the unbridgeable gap between human genius and mediocrity, it has taken its place in motion picture history and is invariably described as a masterpiece.” (BBC.com)\n\n“Milos Forman’s AMADEUS is one of the riskiest gambles a filmmaker has taken in a long time — a lavish movie about Mozart that dares to be anarchic and saucy, and yet still earns the importance of tragedy. This movie is nothing like the dreary educational portraits we’re used to seeing about the Great Composers, who come across as cobwebbed profundities weighed down with the burden of genius. This is Mozart as an eighteenth-century Bruce Springsteen, and yet (here is the genius of the movie) there is nothing cheap or unworthy about the approach.” (Roger Ebert)\n\nSunday, December 31\n\nDoors 1:15 pm | Movie 1:45 pm *Start time subject to change. Please arrive on time.\n\nAdvance tickets HERE\n\nAMADEUS (Miloš Forman, 1984 / 180 mins Director’s Cut / DCP / PG) Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is a remarkably talented young Viennese composer who unwittingly finds a fierce rival in the disciplined and determined Antonio Salieri. Resenting Mozart for both his hedonistic lifestyle and his undeniable talent, the highly religious Salieri is gradually consumed by his jealousy and becomes obsessed with Mozart’s downfall, leading to a devious scheme that has dire consequences for both men.\n\n*Minors permitted in the balcony. Must be 19+ w/ID for bar service.\n\n*Rio Theatre Groupons and passes OK for any single film screening only. Please redeem at the box office.\n\n*If you are looking to redeem your tickets to either a canceled Rio Theatre screening or a Rio Theatre gift certificate, please email <[email protected]> with info including your name, canceled receipt number, gift certificate info, what you are wanting to see and when, and we can make the switch for you in advance.
