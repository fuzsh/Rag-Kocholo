        "text": "Some things can be a hard sell to mainstream movie audiences. Classical music is probably one of them, it’s fair to say. I’m not sure there were many teenagers out on dates in 1984 choosing Amadeus over the likes of Ghostbusters or Gremlins. Nonetheless, director Milos Forman wanted to adapt Peter Shaffer’s stage play of the same name for the big screen, and Shaffer himself handled turning his stage play into a screenplay. I’d say it worked out quite well for everyone since we’re talking about it here now. It was one of the first “serious” movies and period pieces I remember liking as a child, seeing it for the first time probably around age 13. I wasn’t even into classical music either, I just really thought the movie was interesting and well done. I also thought it told an incredible story that seemed odd to me that I hadn’t at least known a little bit about already. I knew who Mozart was, but who was this Salieri guy? And did he really drive Mozart to madness? Wow! I had to learn more about this, so I looked it up some years later…and discovered that sometimes in Hollywood, there’s a little word called “dramatization” that comes into play. While there are numerous theories out there, it’s pretty solidly believed that the Mozart-Salieri feud was not much of a feud at all. Some disagreements professionally, but minor ones. They supported each other’s music quite heavily and even worked together at times. I guess that would have made for a pretty dull film though, right? Let’s check out Amadeus.\n\n===\n\nThe film opens with a wailing and aged Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) behind his bedroom door, not letting his valets bring in dinner. Salieri is yelling that he killed Mozart. They hear more yells and crashes, and finally break into the room to see that Salieri has slit his throat in a suicide attempt. Salieri is immediately brought to a mental hospital for medical attention and institutionalization. After healing, Salieri is visited at the hospital by Father Vogler (Richard Frank), who hopes that Salieri will confess his sins so God can forgive him. Salieri is at first dismissive of Vogler but then plays songs for him to see if he recognizes them. The first two Vogler does not. They were written by Salieri. The third tune, however, he does recognize, and even sings along with. That one was by Mozart. Salieri asks rhetorically if he killed Mozart, and then tells the story to Vogler.\n\nAs a child, Salieri wanted to become a composer. His father planned on pushing him into commerce instead. Salieri was very religious so he prayed to God one night to make him a great composer. The very next day, Salieri’s father died choking at dinner, which Salieri took as a sign. He immediately moved to Vienna and in time became the court composer for Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). One day he learned that the great Mozart who he had heard so much about his musical genius at such a young age would be in Vienna, so he goes to seek him out. He tries to see in the faces of the guests if he can figure out who this genius is. While doing so, he finds himself in a room with a great banquet that he hides behind part of when a giggling young woman (Elizabeth Berridge) runs into the room. She’s being chased by someone and the young duo canoodle on the floor for awhile until the young man (Tom Hulce) hears music and exclaims that they’ve started without him. Salieri realizes in shock that this crude dude is in fact Mozart.\n\nMozart runs out and takes over the composing of the symphony. Afterwards, he is chastised by the Archbishop (Nicholas Kepros) for embarrassing him and told he should probably be sent back home to his father in Salzburg to learn his place. Mozart is dismissed from the room, but when exiting gets a loud ovation from those who heard the performance. Mozart reopens the door and bows to the audience, showing his rear to the Archbishop.\n\nSalieri feels like Mozart’s music sounds like it’s vicariously coming from God, but wonders why God would choose such a louse for it. Nonetheless, the Emperor wants to meet Mozart and arrangements for made for such. Salieri has composed a “March of Welcome” for the occasion, and the Emperor plays it (slowly, as he’s not the musician he thinks he is) as Mozart enters. The Emperor is interested in Mozart staying in Vienna to compose an opera at the vaudeville theater, but debate had ensued amongst the Emperor’s cronies about whether the opera should be in Italian or German. Mozart is very interested in doing it in German, and the Emperor agrees, which doesn’t please several people such as Count Orsini-Rosenberg (Charles Kay), the musical director. Mozart compliments Salieri’s march and is asked to play it after saying he already has it committed to memory. The Emperor invites Mozart to show such, so Mozart plays it uptempo and from memory. He begins to ignorantly insult the work, however, and improves upon it on the spot, turning it into an astounding piece. The cronies look incredulous, Salieri fakes a smile and Mozart just spits out his crazy laugh when finished.\n\nOne of Salieri’s pupils is Katerina Cavelieri (Christine Ebersole), and at the newest lesson she asks many questions about Mozart. Salieri dismisses the notion of her performing in his upcoming opera as it’s set at a Turkish brothel. The next scene shows a giddy Mozart composing Cavelieri on stage in the opera. Salieri’s off-screen narration says he has no idea how or when they met, but here they are now. Salieri watches the opera and when it finishes, the audience bursts into applause. The Emperor comes on stage to congratulate Mozart and the performers. A woman at the foot of the stage below bellows that her daughter Constanze is Mozart’s fiance, so the two women are helped up to the stage. Meanwhile, Cavelieri gives Mozart a look of “Oh, you have a fiance?” and Mozart just innocently laughs it off with a look of “Whoops!” Cavelieri ultimately whacks Mozart with a bouquet and storms to her dressing room.\n\nIt is now that Salieri realizes that Mozart has bedded Cavelieri, and this angers him because he desired her. Salieri prays to God to send Mozart away from Vienna. Mozart’s father writes and asks his son to not marry until he can visit in Vienna, but Mozart returns with a post saying he has already done so, as we see the wedding onscreen.\n\nMozart desires pupils but the Emperor’s court demands that he submit samples first. Mozart is outraged by this and refuses to do so, even though Constanze disagrees with this as the operas only are bringing in so much income, and they have a baby on the way. Constanze sneaks to Salieri with Mozart’s works and asks if he can look at them immediately, as he doesn’t know she’s here. Salieri checks them out after learning they are first drafts with no edits made. He is both enthralled with how beautiful they are, yet also angry at how he feels God continues to mock him by having this guy be His musical voice. Salieri asks Constanze to return tonight to provide a “service” for his service of submitting the works to the court. Salieri is torn between his oath of chastity to God versus his desire to get even with Mozart for bedding Cavelieri. Constanze does return that night and strips topless before Salieri dejectedly and angrily calls in a valet to remove her from the premises. After she is removed, Salieri removes his holy cross from the wall and tosses it into the fireplace, proclaiming both God and Mozart now his enemies.\n\nMozart returns home one day to find his father, Leopold (Roy Dotrice), has visited. Mozart is thrilled to see him and they enter the home. Leopold questions Mozart about rumours of debts and irreverence, both of which Mozart deny. Leopold is introduced to Constanze and Mozart decides they should all go out and celebrate. They first purchase costumes and then head to a party, where a game of musical chairs has ensued with each eliminated person having to pay a penalty. One young girl has to raise her dress and show off her bloomers. Everyone laughs, but Leopold just scowls at his son as he is not amused. Mozart is next eliminated and he wants his dad to name the penalty. Leopold simply says he wants him to return with him to Salzburg and get his act together. Mozart doesn’t want to hear that and runs around looking for a new penalty. He winds up having to play the harpsichord while being held upside down. Of course, he nails it. He’s then challenged by a masked Salieri to play Salieri. Mozart obliges, but does so with a mocking Igor-like face and ending the song with a simulated loud farting noise.\n\nBack at home, a young woman visits the Mozart home. She says an anonymous fan has sent her free of charge to be their maid. Leopold wants none of it, proclaiming they would allow this stranger into their home. Constanze gets into a huge argument with Leopold about it and hires the woman. Leopold heads back to Salzburg. As it turns out though, Leopold was right about her, because the maid was sent by Salieri, and she’s reporting to him about what goes on there on a daily basis. Salieri arranges to visit the house when only the maid is home. He checks around and finds the opera that Mozart has been working on. It’s based on the play The Marriage of Figaro, which is banned due to its racy subject matter. Salieri alerts the Emperor, and Mozart is summoned before him and his cronies. Mozart pleads his case, saying as an opera it can be cleaned up. It takes a while but the Emperor concedes. The musical director is furious by this point, and while in a rehearsal discovers that there is ballet-like dancing in the opera. The director tells Mozart this is not allowed and he rips several pages of music out of Mozart’s book. Mozart goes to Salieri, saying he doesn’t know where else to turn. Salieri assures Mozart he’ll bring it up with the Emperor, but he never does. Somehow, though, the Emperor himself attends the next rehearsal, which he never does according to Salieri’s narration, and he’s arrived just at the point where the dancing takes place. This time, however, they are dancing with no music. The Emperor finds this ridiculous and orders that the music be put back in.\n\nMozart gleefully composes the premiere performance of the opera. It’s a long opera topping off at about 4 hours, and the Emperor himself actually yawns once during the show, which makes all the cronies smile contagiously. The show winds up being pulled after just 9 performances. A subsequent opera by Salieri brings the house down and the Emperor calls it the best opera yet. Mozart, humbled but gracious, congratulates Salieri. Upon returning home with some revellers, Mozart learns from his wife that Leopold has died in Salzburg.\n\nSalieri attends Mozart’s next opera, Don Giovanni, and sees a character seemingly depicting Death. He feels Mozart created this character to represent Leopold. The finale of the opera is loud and violent, with the stage ultimately crashing down. The applause is tepid. Salieri’s influence had this show close after just 5 performances, but he’s also come up with an idea to win his war over God and Mozart. Remembering the costume that Leopold wore at the party, and noticing how the Death character resembled it, he purchases that very party costume and visits Mozart, who recoils in horror upon seeing this figure at the door of his home. The masked figure commissions Mozart to write a requiem mass, giving him a down payment and the promise of much more upon completion. Mozart begins to work on it, not knowing Salieri’s intentions, which are to somehow murder Mozart after the piece is finished, have it played at Mozart’s funeral and then take credit for it, gaining massive fame.\n\nMozart begins to tailspin, a combination of his father’s death, the requiem mass request, being commissioned by another man, Emanuel (Simon Callow), to write up another work and the fear of this masked figure. Mozart takes to heavy drinking and womanizing, and meanwhile he’s working himself ragged. One late night while writing, he is concentrating on working so much he doesn’t hear the loud knocking on the door. Constanze emerges from the bedroom and snaps him out of it. Mozart hears the knocking and says to tell him he’s not here, and he’s “working on it”. It turns out to be Emanuel at the door, and he enters to find the requiem being worked on. Mozart comes out, grabs the pages and tells Emanuel that the other piece is being worked on, but it isn’t written down yet, it’s in his head. An argument ensues, and the maid is frightened. She goes to Salieri the next day and says she doesn’t want to be there anymore. This makes Salieri pay another visit that night in the mask. Mozart asks for another 2 weeks for the requiem to be finished. Constanze also sees the figure and tells Mozart later it’s no ghost, it’s a person. She falls asleep on the chair next to Mozart, and he then sneaks out to party and drink with Emanuel. Upon returning home, he discovers that Constanze has taken their son and left.\n\nThe work for Emanuel is complete, The Magic Flute. During its initial performance, Salieri observes that Mozart is having trouble at times staying upright while composing. Mozart goes to a musical instrument for the next part, and while performing, collapses. Salieri has Mozart brought back home. Mozart comes to after being put in his bed. Salieri asks where Constanze is, and Mozart says she’s at a spa. A loud knock then comes from the door. Mozart thinks it’s the “ghost” and tells Salieri to ask him for more time and perhaps some money so it can done quicker. It’s Emanual and others at the door. Salieri tells them that Mozart is fine and sleeping right now. Emanuel gives Salieri Mozart’s cut of the house profits. Salieri brings it to Mozart and lies that it came from the masked figure, and if Mozart can finish the requiem by tomorrow night, there will be a huge bonus. Mozart, despite exhaustion and illness, stays up all night and dictates while Salieri transcribes the music to paper. Eventually, Mozart says he needs to get some sleep but asks Salieri to stay with him. He obliges.\n\nThe next morning, Constanze returns home. She sees Salieri asleep in their son’s bed. Salieri tells her what happened last night and she talks to her conscious husband, who looks delirious. She then sees the requiem papers and locks them away, saying there will be no more of this. She asks Salieri to leave, but he would rather do so at Mozart’s request. Constanze goes to her husband and discovers that he is dead. The requiem is left unfinished, and now it’s locked away. Salieri’s plan has failed. Forwarding in time, we’re back at the elder Salieri finishing the story to Father Vogler, who is visibly shaken. Salieri concludes that God killed Mozart rather than allow Salieri to share in even an ounce of his glory, and Salieri is consigned to being the “patron saint of mediocrity”. Before being taken in his wheelchair to the bath, Salieri absolves the priest of his own mediocrity and continues to bless his fellow patients as he is wheeled down the hallway.\n\n===\n\nNumerous music professors closely watched the film and all agreed that the finger-playing of every note in the film was exactly correct and as heard…..Hulce and Abraham both went to great lengths learning how to read and conduct music to play their roles for maximum effect…..Kenneth Branagh stated in his autobiography that he was slated to play Mozart, but director Forman ultimately decided to go with an all-American primary cast instead…..The March of Welcome that Mozart modifies in that memorable scene actually is a piece from The Marriage of Figaro…..Meg Tilly was cast at Constanze but injured her leg just before filming began and had to bow out…..Like many facets of the story told in this film, Mozart’s laugh has no historical evidence of being as presented here…..The movie is one of only a handful of films in history that never cracked the box office Top 5 during its theatrical run, but this is a skewed statistic since those records only began to be kept in the early 1980’s…..Salieri and Cavelieri were lovers in real life. Mozart never touched her…..The soundtrack is to this day one of the best-selling classical albums in history…..Despite numerous conspiracy theories that have sprung up over time–including some based on this film–Mozart is widely believed to have died of natural causes…..Twyla Tharp helped choreograph some of the opera scenes…..When released in 1984, the film was rated PG and had a running time of 161 minutes. This version was also what was seen on TV for many years. Forman introduced the full 180-minute version in 2002, which includes such scenes as Constanze going topless. This caused the MPAA to reclassify the film as rated R…..Maurice Jarre won the Best Original Score Oscar this year for A Passage to India. He had the line of the night when during his speech, he expressed gratitude that Mozart wasn’t eligible for the award.\n\nDespite never cracking the box office Top 5, the film did very well, having a long run in theaters and finishing in the Top 10 for the entire year. It was very popular with the Academy, receiving 11 nominations within 10 categories. It was not victorious for Film Editing and Cinematography, and both lead male actors were up for Best Lead Actor. The votes didn’t cancel each other out this time either, as Abraham won the Oscar over Hulce. A gracious Abraham thanked Hulce immensely during his speech. Other wins were for Art/Set Direction, Costume Design, Sound, Makeup, Adapted Screenplay (Shaffer), Director (Forman) and Best Picture (Saul Zaentz, producer). That top award had some drama during the ceremony because it was presented by Sir Laurence Olivier, who was in the final years of his life and suffering from mild dementia. After receiving a royal introduction from host Jack Lemmon, Olivier came out to a prolonged standing ovation. Somewhat flustered, he thanked the Academy for the invite and the audience for their ovation, then promptly opened the envelope and said that Amadeus was the winner. A representative from Price-Waterhouse (who oversee the balloting) quickly rushed onto the stage to verify the result, and if you look closely enough you’ll see him in the corner of the screen from the particular camera angle that was airing. Zaentz spoke from the heart and not a paper sheet, and in his speech kindly put over the other nominated films that were not named by Olivier: The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart and A Soldier’s Story.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I really loved this when I was growing up, and that love stayed with me for quite awhile. Nowadays…well, I guess the fact that it was so dramatized brings it down a bit in my eyes. Still a wonderful movie with great performances and, obviously, great music, but it’s just a bit less enjoyable. I also think the extended Director’s Cut (which is what I viewed for this blog) added more movie but not really more substance. The whole topless scene with Constanze and Salieri was weird and seemed a bit out of place. Other scenes I didn’t even bother touching upon within the synopsis because they really didn’t matter to the ultimate plot at all. The bloom is off the rose a little bit for me, but Amadeus is still a film worthy of its Best Picture status. However, despite what the movie poster says, everything you’ve heard is NOT true."
