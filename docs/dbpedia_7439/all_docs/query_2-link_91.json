        "text": "Committing to a long movie isn't always an easy task for me. When a movie's done well, the length doesn't matter and flows smoothly, but I still hesitate at the start. Similar to my choice of Once Upon a Time in America, I picked Amadeus because I needed to get over this reluctance. In this case, it was also a film that won eight Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. This was definitely a blind spot in my viewing background, so it was time to take the plunge.\n\nSo, what’s the story about?\n\nComposer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) is a distraught old man meeting with a priest after a failed suicide attempt. During their conversation, he recounts his encounters with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) as he rose to prominence in Vienna. Salieri is jealous of the young star and works to undermine his success at every turn. Mozart has great talent but is an innocent, and he struggles against his demons while trying to make his name. Facing pressure from his wife Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge) and stealthy interference from Salieri, he enters a downward spiral that could lead to his end.\n\nWhat are the major themes, and how do they connect to the key issues of that time?\n\nOn the surface, this story provides a look at the life of a famous composer, but its primary focus is the perspective of Salieri. His jealousy towards Mozart and anger towards God because of this young talent drives the story. We've all seen this type of person in our lives whose skills seem way too easy. Salieri can't get over the fact that an uncultured outsider can arrive and charm both the masses and the Emperor (Jeffrey Jones). This jealousy consumes Salieri and turns a fairly docile guy into a hypocritical monster. This personal approach makes the film more universal and not tied to a specific time period. We observe artists struggling to handle ambitions of greatness while facing the daily trials of life itself.\n\nDoes the story hold up well today?\n\nThis historical epic avoids the pratfalls of similar films because it provides the emotional resonance within the biopic structure. It's extremely difficult to deliver something original in a genre that's designed to hit the predictable notes. Audiences have certain expectations that have become so commonplace that it's easy for filmmakers to fall into those traps. This story avoids nearly all of those pratfalls by focusing on a secondary character and presenting Mozart from his perspective. Peter Shaffer wrote the screenplay from his own 1979 play, which took factual liberties to create the rivalry between the two composers. Decades after Mozart's death, Salieri is still haunted by his involvement in those past events. His loss and regret is intriguing and should connect to audiences of any era.\n\nWhat are some of the most memorable scenes?\n\nAmadeus includes lengthy scenes presenting the opera and they're well-made, but those are the least interesting scenes in the movie. The best moments involve personal interactions between Mozart, Salieri, and the members of the emperor's inner circle. For his first appearance, he quickly outshines the veteran composer by rewriting his march on the fly. At this moment, it's clear that the proud Salieri will never accept the young upstart as a worthy composer. He views Mozart as an unholy aberration who doesn't deserve the grace of his natural talent. During this scene, Tom Hulce effectively conveys both Mozart's abilities and his lack of understanding about its nasty effects on Salieri. He's just having fun and showing his skills, but it's a slap in the face to a proud older man who's struggled to learn his craft.\n\nHow’s the direction? Is there an original vision?\n\nI'm generally resistant to this type of costume epic, but Director Milos Foreman (The People vs. Larry Flynt, Man on the Moon) makes it work because he balances the grand sequences with personal drama. Mozart's fate is truly tragic, and Foreman effectively presents the complicated relationship with Salieri that leads to his downfall. There are some lengthy on-stage moments that feel unnecessary, especially near the end, but that's a minor flaw when you consider this lively tale. Foreman's energetic direction makes even the complex, large-scale sequences surprisingly interesting. I watched this film at home and it was impressive, and this spectacle would have been even more remarkable on the big screen.\n\nWould I rather see this film again or listen to the Van Halen album 1984?\n\nEven though Amadeus runs nearly three hours, this response is a no-brainer. I would definitely check out this movie again before the album. I've yet to mention the Oscar-winning performance from F. Murray Abraham, which is totally deserved. Although he's worked steadily since this role, Abraham has rarely played such a remarkable character. He's essential to making this story work; we must understand his perspective while recognizing the flawed approach. Salieri never becomes a straight-up villain and showcases traits that exist in each one of us. I should also mention Elizabeth Berridge's tricky role as Mozart's wife, which gives her little to do beyond worrying about money and his health. She performs solidly but isn't as fully developed as the two leads.\n\nTop 10 Scenes: Almost Famous\n\nAt the end of 2009, film lovers compiled their lists of favorites from the new century’s first decade. My rankings had a clear pick at the top of the list – Cameron Crowe’s Almost Famous . I couldn’t think of another movie that connected with me personally and expressed what it’s like to be a fan. Although I haven’t kept up with as many new bands lately, my love of music isn’t that far behind movies. This film isn’t just about music, anyway. It transcends that topic and shows the type of bond that grows when you connect with another person about a specific passion. Friendships are often built on the love of a movie, band, or sport and grow from that point. Crowe’s films wear their hearts on their sleeves, and it sometimes becomes too much. That isn’t the case with Almost Famous , where he strikes just the right notes because it connects to him so personally. Crowe’s probably never considered buying a zoo, but he’s definitely been a teenager who wrote about music. For this list, I\n\nAnnouncing the 2015 Blind Spots Series\n\nThe idea of a “blind spot” is tricky because it implies there’s a hierarchy of film fans based on which films you’ve seen. While it’s important to expand your horizons and seek out diverse movies, watching them to check a box is pointless. On the other hand, there’s a benefit in seeking out titles that interest us but were pushed aside for a variety of reasons. These aren’t obscure movies yet have never found their way onto our screens. It’s this reason that has driven me to keep participating in the blind spots series. Last time, I selected 50 choices and had readers select 12 films. The result was an intriguing collection that hasn't included any duds. I’ve used this same process again for my 2015 series. Thanks to 35 entries from you, I’ve narrowed down my list to 12 clear-cut winners. It was an extremely close vote, and five movies ended up just one vote short of making the group. On the other hand, seven films received just a single vote. I’m sad to say that Action Jacks\n\nThe Ten Best All-Time Actors Relay Race\n\nThe great Steve Honeywell from 1001 Plus has graciously invited me to join this series which looks at the best actors of all time. It functions like a relay race where each participant viciously cuts an earlier choice and then adds a worthy contender to the list. Amazingly, I will be the 30th person to contribute to this excellent list of actors. Many talented individuals have joined and left this group, and the current roster contains a remarkable group of all-time greats. Deciding which guy to cut is going to be torturous. Here are the entries from the other participants so far: My Film Views (created the original list: Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Daniel Day-Lewis, Samuel L. Jackson, Charlie Chaplin, Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall) The Focused Filmographer (Removed Hopkins, added Christian Bale) Front Room Cinema (Removed Pacino, added Paul Giammati) I Love That Film (Removed Jackson, added Edward Norton) Flixchatte\n\nAnnouncing the 2014 Blind Spots Series\n\nWhen I decided to ask readers for input on my 2014 Blind Spots Series picks, I never expected to receive so many great responses. The 50 possible films all deserve to be seen, and the 30 entries spread out the votes pretty evenly. Only one choice, John Ford's She Wore a Yellow Ribbon , did not receive a vote. The leading movie only appeared on 14 ballots. The 30 entries on this site, Letterboxd, and Twitter have created a diverse group of intriguing selections. The 12 films come from around the world and cross six decades. I'm thrilled to check out all of these picks and can't wait to get started in January. Here is the official list of movies that I'll be tackling next year: The Battle of Algiers Brokeback Mountain Crimes and Misdemeanors The King of Comedy Les Diaboliques Moulin Rouge! My Neighbor Totoro Night of the Living Dead Rosemary's Baby The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Wages of Fear Yojimbo One of the most exciting parts o"
