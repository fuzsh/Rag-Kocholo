        "text": "Amadeus is a 1984 film adaptation of the play of the same name, both of which were written by Peter Schaeffer. The story is set in 18th century Vienna and revolves around the lives of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri, two rival composers. Directed by Milos Foreman, Amadeus won eight Academy Awards, including those for best picture, best director, and best leading actor (F. Murray Abraham as Salieri, though Tom Hulce’s role as Mozart was nominated as well.)\n\nThe poster is compelling and an interesting piece of graphic art for several reasons. The first is the overall tone set by the looming figure in black along with the red to black color palette that reflects the film’s somber subject matter. (The main narrative arc centers around Salieri’s regret for his role in the early death of the vibrant genius Mozart.) Ironically, the color palette for the film itself is a particularly bright blend of the pastels and gilding found in Viennese salon culture.\n\nThe cloaked character in the film is Mozart’s domineering father; after his death, Salieri later dresses in the same costume to commission a requiem funeral mass from Mozart. The poster version emphasizes this domineering presence over the entire city as well as the power conferred by the requiem itself. Focus and detail are on the figure; the stencils of the city buildings are lightly drawn, cursory, and a backdrop that is secondary in size to the personalities of the film.\n\nWhile the layout and color scheme of the poster may be somewhat ponderous, the character of Mozart as played by Hulce is anything but. Flamboyant, playful, and somewhat vulgar, Mozart is a brilliant talent that disrupts the staid classical music scene. In the poster, this is represented by the rays of light emanating from the mind of the poster subject. The figure in the center of the circle is most likely the Queen of the Night, whose aria in the opera The Magic Flute is a brief focus of the film and one of the most breathtaking examples of Mozart’s genius.\n\nDespite its opposition to the generally bright color palette of the film itself, the movie poster for Amadeus is noteworthy for its subtlety and ability to convey the power of the film’s music through visual metaphor without text. The outstretched, beckoning arms of the cloaked character draw the viewer in while retaining the mystery of just who is behind the cloak that looms over the city."
