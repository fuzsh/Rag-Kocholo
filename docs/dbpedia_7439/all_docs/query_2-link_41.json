        "text": "I would never pretend to be a connoiseur of classical music, of European history, of costume dramas, or of 3-hour movies. All of these are forms that are almost totally foreign to me. And yet, all are not only present in but dominate Amadeus, Milos Forman's 1984 story of the relationship between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and rival composer Antonio Salieri.\n\nThe Movie\n\nSalieri (F. Murray Abraham) is Court Composer to King (Emperor? Archduke? I can't remember) Joseph II of Austria, and quite happy to be, until young Mozart (Tom Hulce) shows up and proves himself Salieri's musical superior in every concievable way within about five minutes. This galls Salieri to no end, particularly because Mozart is a perverted, vulgar, impolite little twerp. Salieri decides that Mozart is his enemy, and sets out to destroy him.\n\nIt's such a simple little plot synopsis, but such a brilliant, complex movie. Everything, and I mean everything, about this flick is spot-on. (Which is why it won almost every major award in the 1984 Oscars.) So many great scenes in a large, lush, complex, beautiful film. The performances by Abraham and Hulce are nothing short of brilliant, the screenplay by Peter Shaffer (adapted from his own stage play) is clever and well-paced-- and then there's the music. Oh my god, the music is amazing. I never knew much (or thought much) about Mozart, but this movie, and its score, makes a convincing case for Mozart as the greatest musician ever put on this Earth.\n\nI personally get a nice giggle every time I see the scene where Mozart plays the \"welcome march\" Salieri just spent the night writing for him from memory, after hearing it only once-- and then improves it immensely the second time through. That scene alone is enough to recommend this movie, and it's only one of many.\n\n10 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nThis is an anamorphic transfer, and a rather good one, but it's not perfect. The source print is riddled with spots and shapes that flicker on and offscreen at various times, and the color is a little less vivid than I'd like. In most cases, it's the movie itself-- a lot of the costumes and set design are in the white-offwhite-gray family, but the parts that aren't aren't as bright as they could be. But there is blessedly little shimmering and zero artifacting, so this is definitely nitpicking. Considering that this transfer is from 1997, it's pretty impressive indeed.\n\n7 out of 10\n\nThe Audio\n\nI bought this disc knowing it was an old one, and what persuaded me to do it was my hope that the sound would blow me away. I'm sorry to say that I was a little disappointed. Not because the sound is bad, because it's not, but because it didn't blow me away.\n\nIt's a Dolby 5.1 mix, with precious little stereo or surround effects to speak of. My back speakers lay dormant for most of the movie, and I was surprised how light on the bass the whole thing was. Again, it didn't sound bad, I just expected it to be awesome, and it wasn't.\n\n7 out of 10\n\nThe Extras\n\nAs I said, this disc is from 1997, before the extras we're now accustomed to became the norm. All the supplements that are included, save the trailer, are text-only, and they include notes on the locations, the casting, the screenplay, the music, and historical facts about Salieri and Mozart. These are actually interesting and enrich the viewing experience, but you're not going to look at them more than once.\n\n3 out of 10\n\nOne last thing that needs to be said about this disc-- it's a flipper. You have to take it out and turn it over 3/4 of the way through. It's not that big a deal, but they don't make 'em like this any more, so it's sort of a nuisance.\n\nAs much as I love this flick, I've got to file this DVD in the \"wait for the reissue\" pile. Eventually Warner Bros. will redo this bad boy with extras and commentaries and a beefier soundtrack, and when they do I'll be first in line. Until then this is an acceptable, but not exceptional, substitute."
