When I awoke at daybreak, I saw Juliek facing me, hunched over, dead. Next to him lay his violin, trampled, an eerily poignant little corpse”(95). In order to reveal the idea that when Juliek died, so did the “melancholy” sound of\n\nUna Noche Movie Analysis\n\n1008 Words | 5 Pages\n\nIn Una Noche, three teenagers, Raúl, Elio, and Lila, prepare for and eventually make the 90 mile journey from Havana, Cuba to Miami, Florida. The two young men desire to leave Cuba to search for a better life while Lila, Elio 's sister and narrator of the film, joins at the last minute to prevent being separated from her twin. Lila is the pragmatic voice of reason among the three and is not completely sold on the perfect life that Raúl proclaims they will find in Miami. Elio is not quite as enthusiastic about the American dream as his friend and is primarily travelling with Raúl to Miami due to his suppressed romantic feelings for the other young man. Una Noche was directed by Lucy Mulloy, a first time director who decided to make the film\n\nMozart Vs Mccandless Research Paper\n\n761 Words | 4 Pages\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart was an Austrian multiinstrumental artist, musician, and composer whose bizarre, yet extraordinary musical style and sound influenced not just the classical music age, but also the music you hear today. Mozart compositions would go outside of and beyond what kings and emperors were used to hearing. Like Chris McCandless, Mozart was questioned for his choices, criticized for what he did, and was isolated from the so called average people of society. Both Mozart and McCandless would do what they wanted, lived the way they wanted, and desired what they did, despite who told them so. Wolfgang Mozart was born into musical family in Salzburg Austria on January 27, 1756.\n\nDarabont's The Shawshank Redemption\n\n1129 Words | 5 Pages\n\nIn this point of my analysis, I deal with the scene that one could argue most enriches the main subject of the story, namely hope. In this scene that is created by Darabont, Andy, who is at Norton 's office to receive some used books and sundries for the prison 's library, locks the guard in the bathroom and then starts playing a recording of ‘Canzonettasull 'aria’ from the opera The Marriage of Figaro. As Verstraten argues, filmmakers use music as narrative tool(153) that not only challenges the audience 's emotions but also carries the theme of the movie. In this scene the music is intradiegetic since Andy connects the public speaker system to the record player so that all of the prisoners can hear the music. In her book Music in American Crime Prevention and Punishment, Lily Hirsch explains that this scene “also highlights another utopia musical ascription related to the contested idea that music is a universal language” since all the prisoners are feeling connected, enjoying the music while hope is revived within their\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Influence In The Enlightenment\n\n1782 Words | 8 Pages\n\nHe was beloved of God- truly befitting the name ‘Amadeus’” (Brown 50). Mozart did not make the wisest decisions, and he certainly acted immature at times in his adult life. All of this faded away, though, when Mozart composed. His music was divine, exceptionally beautiful, as if it was inspired by God.\n\nHow Did Elvis Presley's Impact On History\n\n758 Words | 4 Pages\n\nRock and roll music, if you like it, if you feel it, you can't help but move to it. That's what happens to me. I can't help it,” was once said by a great rock ‘n’ roll artist named Elvis Presley. Elvis is one of the three artists who in my opinion had amazing impact on history. Elvis Presley, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had influential musical lives that impacted history.\n\nHouston Symphony Concert Report\n\n974 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThis piece consisted of two different movements. The second part of it was a lot more allegro, upbeat, and energized. It symbolized the eternal love that no one, not even a powerful king, could take away. The whole orchestra had more active roles and a polyphonic texture. Together they made a beautiful\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart And Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\n\n775 Words | 4 Pages\n\nMusic has been around since the beginning of time. People use it for entertainment, expression, and a form of art. When thinking about classical music (and music in general) the one person that comes to mind is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. This paper will go into depth of the cultural significance and meaning of one of Mozart’s most famous pieces, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.

For “A Clockwork Orange” the writer of the novel, Anthony Burgess, has some kind of obsession and own taste about classical music, when these two understanding combines we get a unique synthesis, it is mostly Kubrick’s, though. In the following part of this paper, the use of music will be examined in order of the course of events in the movie: Before the first scene, a very mysterious, kind of sad and ominous but hopeful music welcomes us along with a bright red image. It has a very different sound, like it is out of our world. Before we see any of the scenes it is making\n\nAnalysis Of Concertino For Flute And Piano\n\n1266 Words | 6 Pages\n\nFerdinand De Jean, a Dutch flautist, ordered Mozart to write 4 quartets and 3 flute concertos, but Mozart only completed three quartets and one flute concerto. Instead of composing a brand new flute concerto, he rearranged the oboe concerto he had written earlier that year as the second flute concerto, which is divided into 3 movements: Allegro aperto, Adagio non troppo and Rondo: Allegretto. The concerto is an excellent showpiece and is widely performed by soloists nowadays. Listening to this well-written repertoire, it is hard to believe that Mozart disliked flute or that this piece was originally written for another\n\nHaydn Oxford Symphony Analysis\n\n1807 Words | 8 Pages\n\nThis work calls for flute, pairs of oboes, bassoons, horns in G and trumpets in C, timpani, and strings.

Finale: Presto.\n\nThe Musical Reflection Of The Swan Lake Suite\n\n947 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThere were many musical elements heard throughout these pieces and it was interesting to hear how they varied in each song and suite. In Intermezzo, it began with a quieter violin solo melody creating a monophonic texture. Soon after, it became accompanied by the other violins and cellos, then the full ensemble came in creating a moderate, flowing melody at about mezzo forte and switching to a polyphonic texture. Next, there was a harp solo at forte with many crescendos and decrescendos. The full ensemble enters again raising the dynamics to forte before decrescendoing and slowing down to end with a held note and final tone.\n\nThe Sound Of Music Analysis\n\n1458 Words | 6 Pages\n\nIntroduction Roger’s and Hammerstein’s The Sound of Music is arguably one of the most well known films that many can admit to watching at least once in their lifetime. People all around the world have found this musical inspiring, as it documents growth and hope amidst the horrors of World War II. This incredibly well written film is based on the story of the Von Trapp family who escaped Austria when the Nazis invaded it during the war. Part of what made this movie so interesting on so many different accounts was the music that accompanied the vivid and exciting scenes. Without music, many could agree that our world would be a sad, quiet, dull and depressing place.\n\nRichard Strauss Violin Sonata Analysis\n\n782 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThis movement begins with a beautiful love song until a turbulent middle sections rudely interrupts its dream-like reverie. The finale, Andante-Allegro, begins with a quiet, introspective introduction in the piano alone which then leads into an exuberant Allegro. At the Allegro, the violin breaks forth with ascending, slashing passages from its lowest to its highest register, creating a sense of drama and importance. However, then comes a playfulness that sneaks into the music almost without notice. And then after a rush of virtuosic passages from both violin and piano, the sonata comes to an explosive end."
