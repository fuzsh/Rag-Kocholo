        "text": "I fancied doing a quick project over a couple of weekends, as a change from more complicated fanedits and recreating the original 'Theatrical Cut' of Milos Forman's much admired 1984 film 'Amadeus' is it.\n\nThe 20-minutes longer 2002 'Director's Cut' is freely available on blu-ray but the 8x-Oscar-Winning original is only available on a quite poor (Laserdisc/VHS transfer?) 1997 \"flipper\" PAL DVD. Thankfully, unlike something like 'THX-1138', where half the film is missing, the DC for 'Amadeus' features 99% of the footage needed to remake the TC. The small quantity of missing DVD-only TC footage will be upscaled and graded to blend in as best as can be.\n\nHere is a 2-minute demo of what the cut will be like...\n\nOnce the video has been conformed to the DVD's runtime, editing of the audio tracks will begin. I'll include the TC's 5.1 mix and Isolated-Score and possibly a shortened version of the DC commentary. I understand the commentary is an extended version of a rare Laserdisc TC commentary. If anybody has that, it'd make things easier.\n\nI'll prbably do this as a large 1080p blu-ray compatible mkv, or an actual 25GB blu-ray. It won't be quite the same quality as the 50GB DC disc but storage has it's limits.\n\nI've never actually seen the Director's Cut, but looking through the differences at movie-censorship.com, it seems the two scenes where Salieri humiliates Constanze by trying to have sex with her explain a lot about her anger towards Salieri at the end. I never understood why she was son angry at seeing Salieri at the end of the movie but now it makes sense. Reading around a bit, most people agree that those scenes should not have been cut, but the rest of the Director's cut is filler. Perhaps you could make a BD25 with seamless branching that has the theatrical, and the theatrical plus those two scenes?\n\nstretch009 said:\n\nAre you aware that someone (jimbotron235) has already done this? It's been around for three years and is now available on myspleen as well as requesting for it on the originaltrilogy thread? :\n\nhttp://originaltrilogy.com/topic/Amadeus-Theatrical-Cut-Restoration-1080p-V2/id/16803\n\nYes I'm aware of it and have a copy.\n\nThe video is edited together now, so I'm starting on the audio.\n\nThrowgnCpr said:\n\nCurious. I haven't scrolled through the OT thread, but I'm curious why you are also doing this project. Are there some issues with the jimbotron235 version? How are you hoping to upgrade?\n\nThat version seems to have frames and partial shots missing, at least one entire shot missing (which might, or might not be on purpose), one shot missing (on purpose because it says in the cutlist) and replaces whole shots when only parts needed replacing. Also some of the shot overlays are noticeable to me and the Orion logo at the start is a later one (but only nerds like me would spot that difference ). It's very small stuff to be sure.\n\nSo because it's not that time consuming to do, I decided to make my own \"frame accurate\" version. I also wanted to include the commentary track (in an edited form).\n\nI am actually very interested in this. I haven't seen the theatrical version of Amadeus in a very long time, and the last time I saw it was a viewing of the VHS as a wee child.\n\nI own the Director's Cut, but I have yearned to own a proper HD transfer of the original film for years.\n\nTM2YC said:\n\nHubunkey said:\n\nWill there be an mp4 version available?\n\nI might do. A small 720p one maybe.\n\nThe blu-ray is done and uploaded. The menu turned out nice and is designed to match the artwork...\n\noff subject i know but what software do you use for your cover design and bluray menu. For the cover design i was going to look at GIMP as photoshop is a monthly subscription now ,and i know i would only use now again, so it doesn't justify the cost.\n\nThanks\n\nLast Impressions said:\n\noff subject i know but what software do you use for your cover design and bluray menu.\n\nJasc Paint Shop Pro 6 (1999) and Sony DVDArchitect (2011).\n\nJust finished watching the (new) blu-ray through to double-check. Damn this movie is perfectly paced and structured at this length. I've never known 2-hours and 40-minutes to fly by so smoothly."
