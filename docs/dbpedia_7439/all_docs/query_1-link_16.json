        "text": "Salieri was a contemporary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756 -1791). An accomplished musician, Salieri competed with Mozart for recognition and employment. This film is a fictional exploration of how Salieri might have felt when he realized that despite all his hard work, talent, and popularity at the time, he could not hope to approach Mozart’s genius. Driven out of his mind by jealousy, Salieri is confined to an insane asylum, and fantasizes that he has killed Mozart.\n\n“Amadeus” provides a thoughtful exploration of an existential and moral dilemma: if you are talented, if you spend years in training, if you work hard and if you are acclaimed by your peers for your achievements, how do you react when faced with true genius that easily outshines anything you can hope to accomplish, especially when that genius takes the form of a vulgar little imp? The movie also explores the concept of music as the voice of God, a recurrent theme in Western civilization. In the meantime we learn much about the life of Mozart and a get a glimpse of aristocratic life in Vienna in the late 18th century. Throughout the film we are treated to Mozart’s splendid music.\n\n“Amadeus” is not history. While Salieri and Mozart were rivals in some respects, Salieri did not pay Mozart for a requiem that Salieri could pass off as his own. Someone else did that. Nor was Salieri implicated in Mozart’s death, which was from natural causes. “Amadeus” is a creative work about the jealousy, rage, and cosmic betrayal felt by some talented and accomplished human beings who have not been graced with true genius.\n\nHelpful Background:\n\nBefore his death, Mozart was obsessed with the idea that he was being poisoned by rivals who, with cruel irony, had commissioned the Requiem. With some premonition of his own death, Mozart worried that he was writing the Requiem for himself. Mozart’s fear that he was being poisoned is discounted by historians who attributed his suspicions to depression and melancholy.\n\nThe anonymous person who commissioned the Requiem Mass was a count named Walsegg. For years after Mozart’s death Walsegg claimed that the Requiem was his own work. Apparently, he fooled no one.\n\nMozart was constantly in financial distress. At his death, he told those near him that his major regret was that he had not provided for his family. In fact, the wealthy of Vienna and the government saw to it that Mozart’s family could exist in comfort. His wife produced a series of concerts and sold his original manuscripts. She was able to pay Mozart’s debts, live comfortably and accumulate a small amount of money.\n\nMozart was buried according to his own instructions, in a common grave with several other persons. He was sewn into a linen sack and his body was carried to the grave in a reusable wooden coffin. The white powder sprinkled into the grave was quicklime, used to hasten the decomposition of the body. Mozart’s interment was a standard third class burial, costing about eight and ½ florin. The customs of the time discouraged large funerals and the burial was sparsely attended. There were, however, memorial services for Mozart in several cities including Prague and Vienna. It was generally recognized at the time that a great man had died.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed some of the world’s greatest music. He was a child prodigy who was dragged from one royal capital of Europe to another beginning at the age of four. From 1771 – 1781 he was concertmaster to the Archbishop of Salzburg. He moved to Vienna in 1787 and became court composer to Emperor Joseph II. He died four years later at the age of 35. He was a prolific composer during his short life.\n\nAntonio Salieri (1750 – 1825) was beloved and respected by most musicians and by his public. He became court composer for the Holy Roman Emperor and later served as Kapellmeister (conductor of the court orchestra) for more than fifty years during which time he influenced most aspects of Viennese musical life. For a time his work dominated the Paris Opera. He taught music to Schubert, Beethoven, and Liszt. Despite his success, Salieri’s musical talent did not approach that of Mozart. Of the Viennese Court that Mozart served, only Salieri attended Mozart’s Burial.\n\nJoseph II (1741 – 1790) was Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and a patron of the arts. Founded by Charlemagne in 962 C.E., the Holy Roman Empire in the 10th and 11th centuries included Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Low Countries and portions of Czech Republic and Slovakia. It was much reduced in size by the late 18th Century and destroyed by Napoleon.\n\nIn the 18th Century, great artists were kept on retainer by great nobles. There was a century’s old rivalry between the Holy Roman Empire and the Roman Catholic Church. In “Amadeus” the Emperor and the Archbishop of Salzburg are shown competing for the services of Mozart. One of the reasons the Emperor decided to offer Mozart a commission to write an opera was to lure him away from the Archbishop.\n\nIn the 18th Century, artists were strictly controlled. The stories they could present and the manner in which they were presented were subject to the whim of the sovereign. Thus the emperor had banned “The Marriage of Figaro” and “ballet.”\n\nMozart Today\n\nSome modern musicians believe that Mozart’s music is over glorified and that contemporary composers are not given the credit they deserve because their music remains in the shadow of Mozart’s popularity. Others, doubt that Mozart’s compositions are works of genius. The great opera star, Maria Callas, once said that “most of Mozart’s music is dull,” and concert pianist, Glenn Gould, proclaimed that Mozart’s 40th Symphony was “eight remarkable measures … surrounded by a half-hour of banality.”\n\nMozart was a popular musician in a culture that existed over 250 years ago. Very often, what is thought to be beautiful, interesting, and innovative will change over the centuries, Most new compositions in the “classical” music genre have moved away from the 18th century paradigm, appealing to academics who do not mind the jarring dissonance that often characterizes these works.\n\nStill there is something about Mozart that a large majority of classical musicians and listeners alike consider to be extraordinarily beautiful. The current popularity of Mozart may be due, not only in the sheer beauty of the music, but also to the fact that its similar to modern popular music with regard to simplicity, clean structure, and predictable harmonic transitions. Popular musicians have drawn inspiration from his work.\n\nIt’s interesting to think about what music Mozart would compose if he was alive today. Mozart adopted ideas from his numerous travels and synthesized a style of his own. Mozart’s genius lay in his ability to create music that was adaptable, popular, and innovative for its time and which continues to delight and inspire future generations of music makers.\n\nGuide Questions:"
