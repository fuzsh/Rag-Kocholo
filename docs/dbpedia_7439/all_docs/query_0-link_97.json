        "text": "There was only one place to be in Los Angeles as dawn rose over The English Patient's nine-statuette swoop of the 69th Annual Academy Awards. And that was with Bob and Harvey Weinstein, portly co-founders of independent producer Miramax Pictures, by the pool of the impossibly chic Mondrian Hotel on Sunset Strip.\n\nForget Elton John's AIDS bash, Vanity Fair's shindig at Morton's, or Columbia Tri-Star's do at the Eclipse. Because Miramax hijacked the Oscars, winning 11 statuettes (nine for The English Patient, one for Sling Blade and one for Emma), and took over the Mondrian, recently redesigned by Studio 54's founder Ian Schrager. As Sling Blade's Billy Bob Thornton chatted with Trainspotting's Ewan McGregor, The English Patient's Ralph Fiennes, and Emma's Gwyneth Paltrow and fiance Brad Pitt, champagne was literally growing on trees, with bottles of Moet hanging from the poolside foliage.\n\nThe Weinsteins had cause to celebrate in their private suites at the Mondrian; just as 20th Century Fox's head of production Bill Mechanic could reasonably have been dreading an early-morning phone call from his boss, Rupert Murdoch. Because The English Patient - tying for the third-most awarded film in Oscar's history with Gigi and The Last Emperor - was shut down by Fox shortly before production started. The studio baulked at the US$32.5 million (HK$251.55 million) budget and objected to the 'poor' pulling-power of the movie's stars Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes. 'We were all sent home from Italy,' recalled Oscar-winning cinematographer John Seale backstage. 'And then, a week later, [producer] Saul Zaentz called me in Australia and told me to pack my bags again, because he'd persuaded the Weinsteins to cough up the cash.' But 'Oscar 69' was also 76-year-old Zaentz's night. The producer of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus had put US$5 million of his own money into The English Patient, which paid off in two Oscars at the Shrine Auditorium - an Irving S. Thalberg award for Lifetime Achievement and the statuette for Best Film, bringing Zaentz' total to four. 'The English are patient,' joked Oscar-winning Brit director Anthony Minghella, who previously helmed the low-budget comedy Truly, Madly, Deeply, and nursed the screen adaptation of Michael Ondaatje's novel for the last four years and three months - he even deferred 75 per cent of his salary.\n\n'The whole film was made with glue and bits of string,' said Minghella. 'I despaired not only that it wouldn't be made, but that they would fire me. I'd made two tiny films. I don't know how Saul believed in me. We were shooting blind all the time, but we had faith and courage, and we've been rewarded.' The 69th Academy Awards were polished off by independent film-makers; what didn't go to The English Patient went to Shine (Best Actor Geoffrey Rush), Sling Blade (Best Adapted Screenplay for Arkansas boy Billy Bob Thornton) and Fargo (Best Actress for Frances McDormand and Best Original Screenplay for the producing-directing team of her husband Joel Coen and his brother Ethan).\n\nColumbia/Tri-Star pictures, which had been the only studio nominated in a major category at the start of the night, took Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jnr in Jerry Maguire, but otherwise failed to turn The Mirror Has Two Faces and The People Vs Larry Flynt (two nominations apiece) into Oscar gold. Technical statuettes went to Fox (Best Visual Effects for Independence Day), Paramount (Best Sound for The Ghost and the Darkness) and Universal (Best Make-up for The Nutty Professor), but otherwise, as host Billy Crystal said, the 69th Oscars looked like 'Sundance by the sea'.\n\nBritish film-maker Mike Leigh was also a loser - his Secrets and Lies didn't turn any of its five nods into a statuette. But flanked by Best Actress hopeful Brenda Blethyn in lime Armani and Best Supporting Actress contender Marianne Jean-Baptiste in black Versace, the 54-year-old director looked as happy as a previously-ignored independent film-maker could possibly be.\n\nSaid Zaentz: 'Independent film-making is really not very old as far as films go. But the cream is coming to the top. Nobody is going to tell Mike Leigh, or the Coen Bros, or us, how to make a picture. Now we're getting the money to make them the way we want. That's what's changing.' It became very apparent early on in the night - which at three-and-a-half-hour, was the longest Oscar ceremony in recent memory - that The English Patient was going to make a clean sweep of the Academy Awards. Precisely one hour into the proceedings, in fact, when French actress Juliette Binoche beat the wildly-tipped Lauren Bacall to take Best Supporting Actress. Almost hysterically giddy backstage, Binoche (dressed in Sophie Sitbon) exclaimed: 'I still want to say something about Lauren Bacall, because I admire her, I hope she has an honorary Oscar next year, as soon as possible, because she deserves it. While she's still alive!' The 73-year-old Bacall, dressed for the night in Armani, had no comment.\n\nThe Oscars were almost a replay of Sunday's Independent Spirit Awards, and Billy Bob Thornton confessed that his two children had already destroyed his first statue. Of the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for Sling Blade (a dark feature, in which Thornton plays a disturbed murderer released into society after a lifetime in psychiatric institutions), he said: 'It's going somewhere where they can't get their hands on it.' The self-confessed 'Arkansas hillbilly' added: 'I thanked Elizabeth Taylor in my speech, because she's a legend and supported me so much during this; even though she doesn't know me, she came out and helped push this film.' Although Thornton has only recently come to fame, he was flanked by a woman with the most prominently-displayed cleavage of the Oscar night - his third wife. While Oscar is traditionally about bosoms and frocks, this year's event was - with a few exceptions including Thornton's wife Debbie Reynolds' ample chest, and Sally Kellerman's rampant posing - a family affair.\n\nThe 'indies' brought their clans to the show; Shine's entourage included director Scott Hicks, his wife and two children, David Helfgott and his wife Gillian, Best Actor Geoffrey Rush and his wife, and the ever-dignified Armin Mueller-Stahl. As Rush said backstage, it was left to him to publicly defend Helfgott, the damaged pianist of Shine who is currently attracting a critical savaging in the US for his concert tour. 'I think some of the comments have been extremely unfair,' said Rush. 'Music critics hear things through very sophisticated ears, but David is offering a different music experience from what they want to hear. He's pouring out his life on that keyboard. Perhaps they should be at another concert.' Best Actress Frances McDormand was flanked by her husband Joel and brother-in-law Ethan backstage, and failed to even sport the pre-requisite chunk of diamond around her neck. 'Tonight is about friends and family for me,' she said, adding that the role which won her an Oscar was 'familiar to people. She's the chief of police in a small Minnesota town, she's good at her job, and she's just nice'. The director of the Best Foreign Language film, Kolya's Jan Sverak, came backstage with his father and the movie's five-year-old star, Andrej Chalimon. A dramatically glossed-up Courtney Love came with the mother of her late husband, Kurt Cobain, James Woods brought his mom, and Kenneth Branagh came alone (and left without a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for Hamlet).\n\nThis year's Oscars were dramatically short on drama. No hankies, very few standing ovations - with the exception of an enthusiastic round of applause for Cuba Gooding Jr's buoyant and very loving Best Supporting Actor acceptance speech - and very little trauma. Outside, on the red carpet, a delegation of fans who had queued for two days displayed anti-porn placards when Hustler publisher Larry Flynt came in on his wheelchair (even Flynt's appearance was a surprise, as late last week he was complaining bitterly that Tri-Star pictures had failed to give him a ticket, even though the actor who played him in The People Vs Larry Flynt, Woody Harrelson, had been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar).\n\nAnd anyone who thought that Jessica Yu's Oscar for Best Documentary Short Subject (for Breathing Lessons) was a long overdue nod to Chinese film from the Academy was proven wrong when, backstage, she confessed to being a fifth-generation Chinese American and not at all motivated by her distant heritage.\n\nMadonna sang like a dream and her song, You Must Love Me, from Evita, took an Oscar for Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber and his writing partner Tim Rice (even though they hadn't spoken for years prior to this collaboration, they remained civil backstage).\n\nFor the first time in five years of covering this event, I shed a tear. Outside on the red carpet, amidst the lacquered helmets of hair on parade in the fading sun of Monday afternoon, a frail Muhammed Ali negotiated his way through microphones and flashes, seemingly unaware of where he was. He had come to the Academy Awards to support When We Were Kings, an exquisite documentary about his Rumble in the Jungle bout in Zaire with George Foreman which took 23 years to bring to the screen and finally won an Oscar.\n\nThe once mighty Ali has been laid low by Parkinson's Disease, and seems to only understand the whispered words of his wife.\n\nAs he was guided along, it seemed such a sad moment. Then, she said something to him, he looked up and the light dawned. The old Ali was back."
