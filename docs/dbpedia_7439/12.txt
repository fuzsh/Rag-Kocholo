''Amadeus,'' a movie about a mediocre court composer's jealousy of Mozart, won the largest number of Academy Awards tonight. Its eight awards included those for best picture, best director - Milos Forman - and best actor - F. Murray Abraham, in the role of the envious Antonio Salieri.

Although, by the time the 57th annual Academy Awards were held tonight at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Hollywood had expected ''Amadeus'' to take the major awards, the size of the movie's sweep was surprising. No other film won more than three Oscars.

Presenting the award for best picture to ''Amadeus,'' Sir Laurence Olivier failed to announce the other four films in contention. The film's producer, Saul Zaentz, did his best to correct the error by naming the other four nominees in his acceptance speech.

Most of the winners accepted their Oscars with little emotion. The major exception was Sally Field, who won her second award as best actress for her performance in ''Places in the Heart.''

Almost choking with emotion, Miss Field shouted to the audience, ''I've wanted more than anything to have your respect. And I can't deny the fact that you like me right now. You like me!''

Newcomer and Veteran Win

Haing S. Ngor, a Cambodian doctor who had never acted before, and Peggy Ashcroft, a veteran English actress nominated for for the first time, shared the Oscars for best supporting actor and best supporting actress.
