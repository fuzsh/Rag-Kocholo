        "text": "Augusta af Danmark (French: Auguste d'Oldenbourg; Danish: Augusta af Oldenbourg; Dutch: Augusta van Oldenbourg; 8th April 1580 - Present) is a Princess of Denmark by birth, and through her marriage to Jean-Marie d'Autriche, Grand-duc d'Ouest, she was Grande-Duchesse d'Occident until his death in 1603. Upon her son's accession to the throne, she became the current Reine Mère de Bourgogne.\n\nBeing born a Princess of Denmark, Augusta was brought up in the Protestant religion so hated by the Kingdom of Burgundy. Renowned for her intelligence and influential disposition, she was forced to convert to Catholicism upon her marriage to Jean-Marie d'Autriche. After this, Augusta became a powerful ally for the Protestants at the Burgundian Court.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBirth[]\n\nAugusta af Danmark was born on 8th April 1580, at Koldinghus, in the Danish city of Kolding, within the Kingdom of Denmark, to Frederick d'Oldenbourg and Sophie von Mecklenburg-Güstrow. She was the fifth child and third daughter of the couple, and her birth was not celebrated to her parents. Viewed only as a political tool by her father, from the time of her birth he began looking for suitors for the infant. She was cared for by her maternal grandparents, the Duc and Duchesse de Mecklenburg, as they did for her sisters, at Schloss Güstrow in the German city of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. There, she was looked after by governesses and wet nurses, while her grandparents over saw her day-to-day activities. After turning 3, Augusta was sent back to live with her immediate family.\n\nChildhood[]\n\nAugusta enjoyed a close, happy family upbringing in Denmark, thanks largely to Queen Sophie, who nursed the children through their illnesses herself. Being so close in age, Augusta and her younger sister Hedwig were educated together by Poul Pedersen, who was a prestigious school teacher and former rector of Roskilde. Together, they received a formal education which was much greater than what a woman should learn, and could even be considered \"masculine.\" Her academic education had been in arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, spelling, and writing and she became proficient in French, Italian, Latin, German, and Dutch. Augusta came to learn dancing and music, and she loved embroidery, horseback riding, hunting, real tennis and painting. She ended up reading philosophy and theology and she was fascinated with art, literature, poetry and science.\n\nAfter her education had finished, Augusta spent much of her time with her mother and sister, and she had to watch her two elder sisters marry. Watching as how her sister Anne's husband sailed with a 300 retinue to come get his wife personally, and additionally kiss her, Augusta's views on marriage changed from indifferent to excited. Her dream, as she called it, was to \"find a man she could marry for love.\"\n\nMarriage[]\n\nAfter her two failed proposals, her brother had learned that the Kingdom of Burgundy was looking to become more inclusive, and have the heir to the Burgundian throne, Jean-Marie d'Autriche, marry a Protestant. With the support from her sister, Anne, Reine d'Angleterre et d'Irlande, and her brother, Augusta married Jean-Marie d'Autriche by proxy on 13th May 1595, with Jean-Marie's representative, Louis de Verreycken, Seigneur d'Impden, sitting next to Augusta on the bridal bed.\n\nAugusta began her journey to the Château de Montquintin on 15th May 1595, arriving a week later. The couple were officially married in a lavish ceremony on 23rd May 1595, with Charles II hosting balls, feasts, and jousting tournaments. Afterwards, Augusta converted to Roman Catholicism, though led the Protestants at the Burgundian Court. She was known to argue constantly with her husband, mainly for their differing religious beliefs.\n\nThe couple's inability to conceive a child became a growing concern amongst the Court and Kingdom. The Catholics believed it to be because of her Protestantism, and while the Protestants believed it to be her Catholicism. Augusta suffered 8 miscarriages over the course of her marriage, until finally in 1602, she became pregnant once more.\n\nDeath of Jean-Marie d'Autriche[]\n\nAugusta's happiness quickly diminished after the accidental death of her husband, Jean-Marie d'Autriche, in 1603. Still pregnant, she was ordered by physicians to begin bedrest due to the possible stress it may cause on the child. Her agony and grief over the death of her husband caused great concern for The King, as it as said she could be a danger to herself. She was locked in her rooms for the next six months for her safety.\n\nOn the 17th July 1603, Augusta gave birth to her only child and son, Philippe Constantin d'Autriche. A grueling labor, in which she mostly called out for her late husband and mother, Augusta delivered at 3:22 AM in front of the entire Court. The stress of it all caused her to seize, and Charles II ordered everyone out of the room. Giving the needed heir to the Burgundian Throne, Charles II said to her, “O noble Burgundian blood, my grandson.\"\n\nPolitical Activism[]\n\nAfter the death of Charles II in 1607, her son inherited the Crown, newly titling her \"Reine Mère de Bourgogne.\" Known as the time of the Three Queens, Augusta's mother-in-law, as well as her grandmother-in-law, took both the titles of Reine Douairière de Bourgogne and Reine Grande Douairière de Bourgogne respectively. Her brother-in-law was specified in the late King's will as her son's regent, a decision in which she felt betrayed by The King. Despite this, Augusta took full control over her son's upbringing, deciding his education, schedule, and influencing his views. Her political influence over him was criticized by her brother-in-law, as well as the Catholics at Court, who felt she would turn him into a Protestant. Augusta became popular with the people of the Kingdom, in which she promoted arts and culture, music and gardening and schools.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nAugusta was not regarded as a great beauty, unlike her sister Anne, and she was made fun of for her looks by the Burgundian Court. From her father, she inherited her crystal blue eyes, which most felt as if she were \"looking into one's soul.\" Her dark brown hair, along with her large forehead, made for her face to look rather long. From her mother, she inherited her aquiline nose, with some of her enemies giving her the nickname \"Faucon.\" Preferring her eyebrows thin, Augusta has her ladies pluck her hair for her in the mornings. Her pale, blemish-free skin was the most complimented portion of her. Augusta's love for large hats, earrings, and ruffs began a trend within the Court for women.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nDescribed as intelligent and influential, Augusta's personality was described as \"masculine\" and unbefitting of a Queen. Her dark humor attributed to most of the gossip about her, as well as her obvious Protestantism, despite converting to Roman Catholicism. Augusta's influential disposition allowed her to manipulate her son, Philippe IV, into believing her views rather than his Uncle's. Her ability to draw all attention to herself greatly improves her popularity within certain circles, as well as the people of Burgundy.\n\nIssue[]\n\nHer marriage to Jean-Marie d'Autriche, Grand-Duc d'Ouest, produced one child, along with eight miscarriages:\n\nMiscarried daughter (9th September 1595) †\n\nMiscarriage (17th February 1596) †\n\nMiscarried son (1st October 1596) †\n\nMiscarried daughter (11th March 1597) †\n\nMiscarriage (23rd July 1597) †\n\nMiscarried son (7th June 1599) †\n\nMiscarried son (30th May 1600) †\n\nMiscarriage (5th December 1601) †\n\nPhilippe IV d'Autriche, Roi de Bourgogne (17th July 1603 - Present)\n\nTitles and Styles[]"
