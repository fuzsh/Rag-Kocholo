He married Catarina Henriqueta de Bragança, Princeza de Portugal, daughter of João IV de Bragança, Rei de Portugal and Luiza Maria de Guzman, on 21 May 1662 at St. Thomas à Becket Church, Portsmouth, Hampshire, England .2 He was also reported to have been married on 3 May 1662 at Winchester, Hampshire, England . He died on 6 February 1685 at age 54 at Whitehall Palace, Whitehall, London, England , from a stroke.3 He was buried on 14 February 1685 at Westminster Abbey, Westminster, London, England .3\n\nHe and Lady Elizabeth Jones were associated.1 He was created 1st Duke of Cornwall [England] on 29 May 1630.2 He was created 1st Duke of Rothesay [England] on 29 May 1630.2 He was appointed Knight, Order of the Garter (K.G.) on 21 May 1638.2 He and Elizabeth Killigrew were associated circa 1649.4 He and Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland were associated between 1659 and 1668.5,6 He gained the title of King Charles II of Great Britain on 8 May 1660.7 Charles II Stuart, King of Great Britain also went by the nick-name of 'Old Rowley'. Charles II Stuart, King of Great Britain also went by the nick-name of 'the Merry Monarch'. He was crowned King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith on 23 April 1661 at Westminster Abbey, Westminster, London, England .7 He and Catherine Pegge were associated. He and Lucy Walter were associated. He and Eleanor Gwynne were associated.8 He and Louise Renée de Penancoët de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth were associated. He and Frances Theresa Stuart were associated in 1662. He and Mary Davies were associated circa 1672. He and Hortense Mancini were associated in 1675.1 He and Jane Middleton were associated in 1678.9\n\nWhen his father's cause was lost in 1646 he went to the Isles of Scilly then Jersey and on to France. In 1650 he was crowned King of the Scots at Scone. He invaded England in 1651 and was beaten by Cromwell at the Battle of Worcester and after the battle hid in an oak tree. With difficulty he escaped to France. Returning to England in 1660 he was welcomed as King. Plague struck the country in 1665 killing over 60,000 in London alone and in the next year the Great Fire made 200,000 homeless. That was not all, the Dutch Fleet sailed up the Medway and England had to sue for peace. After the Great Fire, Sir Christopher Wren built a new and better London. Charles had St James Park re-created and built Chelsea Hospital for old soldiers. He supported the sciences, founding Greenwich Observatory and the Royal Society. Boyle Halley and Newton are illustrious names of his reign and Nell Gwynn will be remembered for other reasons. His Chief Minister was Clarendon who freed the Church of its Cromwellian past. Titus Oates raised the alarm of a Popish plot and many Catholics were executed. Charles himself was a Catholic, certainly just before his death and probably before. He had many mistresses and the future Duke of Monmouth was his illegitimate son. Of twenty-six dukes in England today, five are descendants on the wrong side of the blanket of Charles II. His neice was married to William of Orange, as a diplomatic measure. He brought much needed elegance to the land. He has an extensive biographical entry in the Dictionary of National Biography.10\n\nChild of Charles II Stuart, King of Great Britain and Margaret de Carteret\n\nJames de Carteret11 b. 1646, d. c 1667\n\nChildren of Charles II Stuart, King of Great Britain and Lucy Walter\n\nJames Scott, 1st and last Duke of Monmouth+12 b. 9 Mar 1649, d. 15 Jul 1685\n\nMary Walters+ b. 1655/56, d.
