        "text": "KING Frederik of Denmark is taking over from his mother as head of the Danish Royal Family.\n\nQueen Margrethe II announced on December 31, 2023, that she was abdicating the throne - after ruling Denmark for over five decades -and handing the crown over to her eldest son.\n\nWho is King Frederik of Denmark?\n\nFrederik, King of Denmark, is the eldest son of Denmark's Queen Margrethe II and the late Prince Henrik.\n\nHe was born on May 26, 1968, in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nFrederik has one sibling, Prince Joachim, who was born in 1969.\n\nThe royal went to school in Denmark and France and is fluent in Danish, French, English and German.\n\nFrederik has publicly expressed his interest in scientific research, climate change and sustainability, and he is also an avid sportsman.\n\nHe is a patron of the Red Cross and Save The Children and is the board chairman of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary's Foundation.\n\nWhat was King Frederik of Denmark like when he was young?\n\nIn the past, King Frederik has been known as a \"party prince\" and has been compared to the UK's own Prince Harry.\n\nWhen he was younger, Frederik's romantic life was covered extensively by the media and, according to the Washington Post, he was critiqued by Danish publications for not being \"mature\" enough for his royal duties.\n\nThe royal was portrayed in the media as a rebellious teen, who was uncomfortable with the attention that came with being part of his family.\n\nHe once said: \"I don't want to lock myself in a fortress. I want to be myself, a human being,\" a view he insisted he would maintain after taking over the throne.\n\nFrederik's army training and numerous achievements since have been credited with changing the public perception of him.\n\nIn a 2022 speech celebrating his mother, Frederik revealed he was ready to take on the highest position in the royal family.\n\nHe told the Queen: \"When the time comes, I will guide the ship...I will follow you, as you followed your father.\"\n\nWas King Frederik in the armed forces?\n\nKing Frederick has completed extensive military studies and has served in all three branches of the Danish Armed Forces.\n\nHis military career began in 1986 in the Queen's Life Guard Regiment of the Danish army.\n\nHe then became a platoon commander in the Royal Danish Hussar Guard Regiment before entering the army reserve.\n\nIn 1995, Frederik completed training for the Royal Danish Navy Frogman Corps\n\nHe later completed even more leadership training at the Royal Danish Defence College.\n\nThe royal has attained the rank of major general in both the army and air force, as well as the rank of rear admiral in the navy.\n\nWhere did King Frederik meet Crown Queen Mary of Denmark?\n\nKing Frederik and Queen Mary met in a pub in Sydney, Australia, in 2000.\n\nThe King was visiting the continent during the 2000 Olympics.\n\nMary, born Mary Donaldson, is from Hobart, Australia, and worked in advertising and marketing before meeting her husband.\n\nOn the fateful night he met Mary, King Frederik introduced himself as Fred and did not tell her straight away that he was the heir to the Danish throne.\n\nThe couple began a long-distance relationship before becoming engaged on October 8, 2003.\n\nWhen did King Frederik and Queen Mary get married?\n\nKing Frederik and Queen Mary married on May 14, 2004.\n\nThe couple held their wedding at Copenhagen Cathedral.\n\nThey tied the knot in front of 400 guests, while members of the public lined the streets outside to wish the newlyweds well.\n\nMary wore a dress designed by acclaimed Danish designer Uffe Frank for her big day.\n\nThe royal couple share four children - Prince Christian, Princess Isabella, Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.\n\nWhen will King Frederik become King of Denmark?\n\nKing Frederik and Queen Mary will become King and Queen regent at their coronation on January 14, 2024.\n\nFrederik will be known as King Frederik X, while Mary will become the world's first Australian-born queen.\n\nQueen Margrethe II first announced her surprising plan to give up the throne during a New Year's Eve speech.\n\nShe said in the broadcast: \"I leave the throne to my son, Crown Prince Frederik.\""
