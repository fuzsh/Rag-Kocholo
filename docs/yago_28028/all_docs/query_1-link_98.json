        "text": "Hi everyone, this is my first attempt at a timeline. I've been lurking around for a bit and I've seen a timeline where Charles II has a son but I haven't seen one for a daughter so I'm interested in how things would go differently. I took a \"Tudors and Stuarts\" class last semester but as this didn't happen, I'm still going to need to lean on y'all and research.\n\nWhere the baby comes from could come about in a number of different ways - Catherine could manage to carry one of her pregnancies to term, other than being a bit on the older side for a royal bride, I haven't heard an explanation that prevents her from having children or someone could substitute one of Charles' bastards for his and Catherine's legitimate children (supposedly when she was ill, she was convinced she had given birth and Charles humored her by pretending she had so possibly this world could have the inverse of this where while ill she's convinced that she hasn't given birth, while everyone thinks she's delirious), certainly no one's going to be questioning Charles' ability to father children - but ultimately isn't important to how things play out.\n\nWhat will matter, though, is when the girl is born. Charles died 1685 OTL and given that he died of an apoplectic fit a.k.a. a stroke and modern medical officials find his conditions possibly indicative of kidney dysfunction, I can't imagine him living much longer here. I think a plausible range for her birth would be 1665-1675 as Catherine would be 47 in 1685 and 37 seems like a reasonable upper limit for a successful pregnancy.\n\nHi everyone, this is my first attempt at a timeline. I've been lurking around for a bit and I've seen a timeline where Charles II has a son but I haven't seen one for a daughter so I'm interested in how things would go differently.

I think a plausible range for her birth would be 1665-1675 as Catherine would be 47 in 1685 and 37 seems like a reasonable upper limit for a successful pregnancy.\n\nI have actually thought about this timeline a lot (because it would butterfly quite a bit). My usual go-to date would be 1669 for a Princess (eventual Queen) Elizabeth (after the King's sister who died in captivity) or Catherine (after her mother). Catherine of Braganza seemed to have pregnant in 1669 and miscarried. This would leave the eventual Queen, 16 years old at the time of her father's death which would mean a regency led by her mother and her uncle, the Duke of York (both Catholics).\n\nI like an older Queen too. A much younger Elizabeth could lead to a potentially Catholic Queen on the throne given too much influence from her mother and uncle, very interesting also, but let's leave that for another time.\n\nEven sixteen might be a bit young for a Queen ruling in her own right, although of course to Parliament's advantage.\n\nMaybe a short regency? Around a year and a half? Ruling in her own right by age eighteen?\n\nUnless Charles nominated the Protestant Princess Anne.\n\nI can't imagine Charles nominating someone so young for the regency council, especially since Anne's not very high in the succession. Assuming the Duke of York still married Mary of Modena, which I'm not sure we have a reason to stop especially with the Princess Elizabeth already born before the marriage goes through, the succession is as follows:\n\nCharles II\n\nQueen Elizabeth\n\nJames, Duke of York\n\nJames Francis Edward (OTL the \"Old Pretender\"), not sure what his title would be here\n\nMary Stuart, The Princess of Orange\n\nAnne Stuart, The Princess of Denmark\n\nWill Parliament still stop Charles from passing the 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence with a Protestant in the succession before James? Does the Exclusion Crisis still occur? The Rye House Plot? Presumably, Charles doesn't dissolve Parliament in 1681, giving them greater power and influence here. They might still try to get the young Queen Elizabeth to remove her uncle and young cousin from the succession and/or promise not to marry a Catholic.\n\nHowever, I think we do need some significant Protestants on the council to balance out the strong Catholic Queen Dowager and Duke of York. Might James, Duke of Monmouth have finagled his way onto the council? It might be a risky move for him to have that much potential power but also, it could stop him from attempting a rebellion against his half-sister, considering his gender and age (male and thirty-six) compared to hers (female and sixteen).\n\nre: marriage prospects, a Parliament with greater control is probably not going to be on board for a Catholic King-consort nor will they want to give the Duke of York greater control over the royal couple as both uncle and father-in-law.\n\nIs Augustus, younger son of the Elector Johann Georg III and Anne Sophie of Denmark, b. 1670 a crazy option? Not sure what he'd bring to the table but he is a Protestant prince who eventually succeeded his older brother as Elector of Saxony (and became King of Poland but that was after converting to Roman Catholicism which wouldn't be an option if he's married to Elizabeth beforehand).\n\nAre there any Protestant Bourbon/Conde princes still around and of the right age?\n\nAsked my wife about this [she's a Stuart Historian and has written a fair bit about the dynasty and Charles I's family] and her points were:\n\nName:\n\nCatherine and Mary are possibilities. Elizabeth is a strong one, but not for the family reasons mentioned so far. More likely the pull of Elizabeth would be to make a clear link to Elizabeth I's who's legacy was incredibly popular in this period. Helps settle an image of a strong protestant queen.\n\nRegency:\n\nDuke of York and Catherine of Braganza are very likely. My wife pointed out that, after Charles II's death OTL, Catherine went back to Portugal and ended up being regent for her brother Peter II [which she was pretty good at apparently]. She and the Duke of York got along well, so would make a strong team. Other candidates would be, potentially, the Duke of Monmouth [likely if Charles II lives to appoint the regency] and figures from the Hyde Faction at court.\n\nMarriage:\n\nMost likely she would have been married off well before coming to the throne at the age of 16 etc we've been talking about. The most likely candidates might actually be the OTL husbands of her cousins - William of Orange and George of Denmark. Charles II was really keen on the William of Orange match for Mary OTL, who was thought by most in the 1680s to be the likely heir to James II, as it solved a number of dynastic, economic, and political issues. He was very popular with Parliament and the country as well [or at least the Protestant bits of the country]. George has the advantage of being a nice, safe, protestant Prince who was willing OTL to come over and be a fairly stable consort uninterested in involving himself in politics. Given the level of anti-catholicism at the time, and the memory of how unpopular his Catholic mother made his father, it would be unlikely that Charles would seek a catholic match for his daughter and heir.\n\nThe last miscarriage documented by Catherine of Braganza was in June 1669, so lets assume this one can last the full term and is born in August of that year, this would make her 16 when her father dies in 1685.\n\nName:\n\nCatherine and Mary are possibilities. Elizabeth is a strong one, but not for the family reasons mentioned so far. More likely the pull of Elizabeth would be to make a clear link to Elizabeth I's who's legacy was incredibly popular in this period. Helps settle an image of a strong protestant queen.\n\nI would go strongly with Princess Elizabeth. A catholic Mary could lead to many remembering the legacies of both Mary I and her ancestor, Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nOther options I though could be:\n\n- Henrietta. After her grandmother, Henrietta Maria of France and her aunt, Henrietta, Duchess of Orléans. It could also be linked to the strong masculine name of Henry.\n\n- Charlotte. Feminine version of Charles, after her father and grandfather.\n\nRegency:\n\nDuke of York and Catherine of Braganza are very likely.

Other candidates would be, potentially, the Duke of Monmouth [likely if Charles II lives to appoint the regency] and figures from the Hyde Faction at court.\n\nCatherine did not return to Portugal until March 1699, so this would mean that her mother Catherine of Braganza could act as regent. Also with a daughter, would Catherine be compelled to stay in England. In OTL she had no need to stay. If she could be as strong a regent in England as she was in OTL Portugal, then the nation would be in good hands.\n\nHer uncle, Prince James, Duke of York, would be a strong voice in government, sitting in the House of Lords.\n\nJames Scott, Duke of Monmouth, would be a good influence on his half sister, especially with his Protestantism, but would he want to led a similar Monmouth Rebellion to OTL, as an attempt to depose the younger catholic monarch?\n\nMarriage:\n\nMost likely she would have been married off well before coming to the throne at the age of 16 etc we've been talking about.

Given the level of anti-catholicism at the time, and the memory of how unpopular his Catholic mother made his father, it would be unlikely that Charles would seek a catholic match for his daughter and heir.\n\nHaving two close catholic regents would the young Queen have a say if she is married of to:\n\n- Louis, Grand Dauphin\n\n- King Charles II of Spain\n\n- Philippe II, Duke of Orléans\n\nI know Parliament may be in uproar but James II never really cared about the consequences of his actions, so I doubt he would care what it meant to his niece.\n\nShe could be married by proxy but it may not stand if Charles dies early and being younger than her cousins, they may wish for a closer match. William of Orange, is 19 years older and George of Denmark is 16 years.\n\nA closer match, could be her cousin, Duke George Louis of Brunswick-Lüneburg (OTL George I of Great Britain) whom again is a nice, safe, protestant Prince who is willing to come over and be a fairly stable consort uninterested in involving himself in politics\n\nOther matches include:\n\n- Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon, was nephew of Lady Anne Hyde, Duchess of York, wife of Prince James, Duke of York, if James has a hand in the coupling.\n\n- Philip William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt, son of Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg and his second wife, Princess Sophia Dorothea of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.\n\n- Prince Charles of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, the hereditary prince of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. He was a son of Gustavus Adolph and his wife Magdalene Sibylle née Duchess of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, a daughter of Frederick III\n\n-------\n\n​\n\nSo what if Queen Elizabeth II married her cousin Duke George Louis of Brunswick-Lüneburg\n\nElizabeth II (b. 6 August 1669: d. 1739) m. Duke George Louis of Brunswick-Lüneburg (b. 28 May 1660: d, 1727)\n\n1a) Charles III (b. 9 November 1683: d. 25 October 1760)\n\n2a) Elizabeth (b. 26 March 1687: d 28 June 1757)\n\n3a) George (b. 11 May 1589: d. 7 June 17)\n\n4a) Catherine (b. 20 January 1692: d. 4 December 1773)\n\n5a) Sophia (b. 11 February 1693: d. 14 December 1778)\n\n6a) Henrietta (b. 12 August 1701: d. 16 September 1766)​\n\nThe last miscarriage documented by Catherine of Braganza was in June 1669, so lets assume this one can last the full term and is born in August of that year, this would make her 16 when her father dies in 1685.\n\nI would go strongly with Princess Elizabeth.

Plus why would the Duke of York be deciding on the marriage? It would be quite a departure from convention to break a proxy marriage, which is essentially legally and religiously binding in the 17th century, for a Catholic rematch.\n\nPlus, I think you're massively underestimating the level of anti-Catholic fervor in England at the time. A Catholic husband means a Catholic child, and a Catholic boy means a Catholic king.\n\nMy point about Catherine and Portugal was not that she would return in this timeline, but that she was an effective regent OTL so would probably be so too in this timeline.\n\nBut as I say, its one reasonably convincing vision of this possible timeline.\n\nI'm really not convinced that she would be a Catholic though.\n\nWhatever Charles II's personal religion, which is somewhat debatable, officially he never veered from being Anglican and I can't see him having his daughter brought up an open Catholic.

But growing up catholic she may wish to marry someone that is in their religion.\n\nHaving influence in Government, he could arrange for the two relatives get close and hold the young royal family over a barrel, similar to other family members in normal families influencing their own.\n\nI understand the tension amoungst the common folks. With the effects of the Great Fire of London, three years ago still fresh in their minds, believing it was a Catholic plot, I think its not completely out of the question for the monarch to marry another Catholic. Charles is married to a portugese catholic, both of James's wife are catholic."
