        "text": "King Frederik of Denmark has returned to Spain for a private trip, months after the photos which sent the world into a tailspin of rumour, as tabloid speculation abounded of a possible affair with the Mexican socialite, Genoveva Casanova.\n\nIt is not clear exactly when Frederik returned to Spain but it has been suggested in HOLA! that the King was last in Madrid just three weeks ago, perhaps making his first visit since the coronation.\n\nIn January, following the shock abdication of his mother, Queen Margrethe II, Frederik ascended the Danish throne amid scenes of jubilation in Copenhagen. As he was proclaimed from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace, Danes revelled in the streets, decked out in red and white, with the champagne reportedly flowing on street corners across the city.\n\nThe joy of the coronation and its numerous subsequent celebrations drew focus away from the difficult end to 2023 endured by Frederik and his immensely popular wife Queen Mary. The pictures which emerged, of Frederik and Casanova on a late night out in Madrid, thrust the rumour mill into overdrive – but were explained at the time by HOLA! in the following terms: Frederik and a mutual friend of his and Genoveva’s had plans to attend an exhibition together. After the friend pulled out, Genoveva was asked to go in his place. The pair then walked through the park and had a public dinner together at ‘El Corral de la Morería’.\n\nMost pundits have put Queen Margrethe’s bombshell new year’s eve abdication down to her age and her health – Margrethe herself commented that recent back surgery had put her in mind of the future and how she would be succeeded. However, there can be no doubt that its timing also helped to shift attention away from the furore surrounding Frederik’s after midnight appearance with Casanova.\n\nRead More\n\nGenoveva Casanova feels ‘crushed’ by everything that has happened, sources reveal - as she returns to Instagram for the first time since the Danish coronation\n\nInsiders said the Mexican socialite has been ‘travelling constantly’ for the past few months\n\nRead More\n\nQueen Margarethe of Denmark celebrates her birthday – but just what has she been up to since the abdication?\n\nAs the former monarch marks turning 84, Tatler wonders what has been keeping the former Queen busy\n\nCasanova is a model, charity activist and former reality TV star. She was once married to the Duchess of Alba’s son, Cayetano Martinez de Irujo, but they divorced in 2007. It is said that she met Frederik on a luxury hunting trip in Spain. Whatever one thinks of the explanation for the appearance – one must concede that it seemed imprudent for the heir to the Danish throne to appear at 2am in a major European city in such circumstances.\n\nAfter the debacle surrounding the pictures, which were published in Spanish magazine Lecturas, Casanova disappeared from social media.\n\nShe has since returned, and in recent days posted an appreciative message, along with a picture of her and her dog: ‘Hello everyone! Here I am back! I want to thank all the people who have cared about me this past year, those who have understood my absence and my silence, and those who have sent me messages of love and support.\n\n‘You have no idea how much that meant to me. Thank you very much! It's been a few months where I needed peace and quiet, but I'm already doing my best to slowly be able to return to my normal life and meet my work commitments. Once again, a million thanks! Taj and I are leaving you our best smile with some pictures from our walk this afternoon and wishing you all a very good night!’\n\nFrederik and Queen Consort, Mary, meanwhile, have been pressing on with their regal duties as new rulers of Denmark, following a two-week break. Queen Mary is a beloved figure in Denmark, where she has been welcomed with open arms as a foreign-born Queen. Born in Tasmania, Mary’s family originally hail from the east coast of Scotland. After rapidly picking up the Danish language and committing herself to a number of charity endeavours she won over Danish hearts completely. According to some recent polls, she is even more widely approved of than Frederik – in spite of the broad popularity of the Danish monarchy. Having weathered the storm around Casanova, she has proven herself to be a steady pair of hands once again – and more than capable of managing the scrutiny of royal life."
