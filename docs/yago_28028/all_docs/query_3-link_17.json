        "text": "Following the historic abdication of Queen Margrethe II, her son has ascended to the Danish throne as King Frederick X.\n\nA married father-of-four and passionate environmentalist, the 55-year-old speaks four languages and has recently stepped up his royal duties.\n\nBut the man fond of rock concerts who was once dubbed the \"party prince\" didn't always appear to be prepared to take over the reins of Europe's oldest ruling monarchy.\n\nHere, Sky News looks at the King of Denmark - and how his reign might look.\n\n'Party prince'\n\nQueen Margrethe's eldest son was always destined for the throne.\n\nBut as a young man in the 1990s, he developed a reputation for being a \"party prince\".\n\nHe was said to have matured during his time at the University of Aarhus, where he graduated in political science.\n\nAs part of his course, he spent some time studying at Harvard University in the US between 1992 and 1993.\n\nHis military education began in 1986 in the Queen's Life Guard regiment.\n\nIn 2010, he was appointed as a commander in the navy and colonel in the army and the air force.\n\nPreparing to be king\n\nMarie Rønde, royal correspondent for Danish broadcaster TV2, said the then crown prince was not always \"prepared\" for his future role as monarch.\n\nShe told Sky News: \"He's talked about it himself that when he turned 18, he was not at all prepared for what came to him at that point.\n\n\"He's used a lot of time getting prepared - like getting used to the fact that this is the task of his life and he's worked a lot on that.\n\nIn recent years, Frederik - who also speaks English, French and German - had taken on more responsibilities, particularly during Queen Margrethe's recent ill health.\n\nMs Rønde said: \"A year ago she had back surgery [and] he took over a lot of her work.\n\n\"He said that he was like his mother's 'wingman'.\n\n\"He's had a long military education and he's fond of rock music, [he] goes to concerts and festivals, and he's very into sports events. So in that way, he's very different from his mother.\"\n\nHis family\n\nFrederik is the eldest child of Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik of Denmark, who died in 2018.\n\nHis younger brother, Prince Joachim of Denmark, is one year his junior.\n\nIn 2022, Queen Margrethe stripped Joachim's four children of their royal titles, saying it was \"necessary future-proofing of the monarchy\".\n\nThe move did not affect Frederik's children, who all retain their titles, nor did it impact the line of succession.\n\nHe first met his wife, Mary, now Queen, at a bar during the Sydney Olympics in 2000.\n\nThe Australian-born royal worked in advertising before meeting Frederik.\n\nThey were married in 2004 and the couple have four children - 18-year-old Prince Christian, 16-year-old Princess Isabella, and 12-year-old twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.\n\nMs Rønde believed Mary will be a \"very strong Queen\".\n\nShe said: \"It's been clear all these years that his wife... has always been very supportive of him and she's been by his side - like you see with Queen Camilla, the role that she has with King Charles.\"\n\nWhen it comes to his eldest son, Prince Christian, it is unclear how his role will change when he becomes crown prince.\n\nRønde added: \"I'm really excited about the role of his son, Prince Christian, because the royal household said he will not have an official role until he turns 21, because they want him to focus on his education and just to be young.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nQueen of Denmark apologises for stripping grandchildren of royal titles\n\nQueen Margrethe's reign in pictures\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\nWhat kind of king will he be?\n\nAlthough the monarch is head of state, the Danish constitution strictly rules out their involvement in party politics.\n\nBut ever since climate conference COP15 took place in Copenhagen in 2009, Frederick had been engaged with global climate and environmental challenges.\n\nMs Rønde believed he will be a \"king of the people\" when he officially becomes monarch.\n\n\"He meets a lot of Danes when he's out and about and he's very good at talking to them,\" she said.\n\n\"[Queen Margrethe] is also a queen of the people, people really like her, but I think he will be too.\""
