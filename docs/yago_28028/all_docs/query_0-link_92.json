        "text": "Upon waking up on Voyager of the Seas for the last time, we took advantage of two final suite perks. First, we had a nice complimentary sit-down breakfast in the specialty restaurant, Chops Grille. Then, we found our concierge for a personal escort off of the ship directly to our waiting luggage. It took a few minutes to figure out how to get it all back into a taxi, but then we were off again to the Scandic Palace Hotel, where we had two more nights booked to explore the Copenhagen area before returning home.\n\nWe didn't stick around, though. We boarded a train and headed out into the countryside to the town of Helsingør (or Elsinore in English), home to Kronborg Castle. This was very much what I think of when I imagine a castle, with a moat, a courtyard surrounded by a stone building with spiral staircases, wood-beamed rooms filled with tapestries, velvet, furs, and gold, and deep dark dungeons below. Kronborg was the Danish hotspot for European royalty back in Shakespeare's time and inspired the play Hamlet. The first part of the castle that we explored was the Royal Apartments, where Harriet was shocked to discover that it was considered a \"remarkably happy marriage\" when 14-year-old Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow married her 38-year-old half-cousin Frederick II (King of Denmark and Norway) and had seven children before she was widowed at the age of 31. One of those children was the heir to the throne, Christian IV, and another was Anne of Denmark who by marrying King James VI/I became Queen of Scotland and later England and Ireland.\n\nWe continued our explorations of the private dining room, his-and-hers bedrooms, the long gallery where the ladies-in-waiting would walk in the winter so as not to damage their shoes, and the ballroom, once one of the grandest in Europe. Next, we visited the beautiful chapel, which was the only part of the original castle to survive the fire of 1629, and Harriet tested out the acoustics. Finally, we descended into the dark, scary casemates underneath the castle. You could really imagine the soldiers making their way to defend the castle at all costs. We were glad that Harriet was not yet walking, because we could easily have lost her forever if she ran off into the maze of darkness! Down here we found the statue of Ogier the Dane (and an accompanying face cut-out picture). This legendary figure with connections to French and Arthurian mythology is said to sleep in Kronborg Castle until Denmark is in peril, when he will rise up and save the country.\n\nWe were running a bit ahead of schedule and discovered that our Copenhagen Cards also covered the Maritime Museum of Denmark right next door, so we popped in to explore a bit. We had a light lunch of local soup, crisps, beer, and dessert, and Harriet discovered that the steamer Harriet was one of many Danish ships that were hit during WWI.\n\nIt was time to head to the world's oldest amusement park, Bakken. Originally the site of a healing spring discovered in 1583 within the king's deer park and hunting reserve, early visitors would come to drink the waters while jugglers, mimes, and food vendors would set up nearby to take advantage of the crowds. The site was fully opened to the public in the 1800s and even had some rides like an early version of a Ferris wheel called a Russian swing and a steam-powered carousel. The oldest ride still operating today is the Rutschebanen (roller coaster) from 1932, although this one no longer uses a brake operator since 2009. The park was larger than Tivoli Gardens with plenty of coasters, rides, and attractions to keep us busy. I was immediately attracted by the self-powered swan ride. That one turned out to be quite a workout, at least as a solo ride! We switched off on riding a few coasters and other adult rides, and also took Harriet on a jeep safari ride and a little train that drove through the park. She had so much fun!\n\nWe ended the day back at our hotel, where we had hoped to order in a room service dinner for Mother's Day but didn't realize that room service was through an outside restaurant that was very busy for the holiday, so instead we picked up a mystery chicken combo (since its ingredients were listed in Danish) from KFC next door, but it all turned out to be delicious!\n\nOn our final day in Copenhagen, we decided to try a Questo game (as I'd done in Savannah) to see a bit more of the city as we made the long walk out to see The Little Mermaid statue from land. After breakfast at our hotel, we took the Metro to the Magasin du Nord shopping mall, where we picked up a souvenir for Harriet before setting out - a set a plastic links to which we attached her toys so they were no longer constantly being dropped (or thrown) on the ground. Our quest followed the story of young girl who followed a strange voice on the way to visit her grandmother and discovered the tale of a little mermaid. There were too many stops to name, but we saw the Royal Theatre, took a selfie next to the famous colorful buildings of Nyhavn, visited the former home of Hans Christian Andersen and stopped in a gift shop next door where we could get up close to a fake Little Mermaid statue and moving Hans Christian Andersen mannequin, passed by various statues and parks on the way to the Amalienborg Palace square to watch the Changing of the Guard (not as interesting as the one in Stockholm, but better hats!), and finally at long last, completed our quest at the famous statue of the Little Mermaid.\n\nAfterwards, we went to the food hall at Tivoli Gardens for one last dinner in Copenhagen (Thai for me, burger for Jason) and then stopped by the flagship Lego Store. The next morning, we flew home, and before we knew it we were back in the U.S. Can't wait until our next trip!"
