        "text": "After a 52-year reign, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark is bowing out.\n\nThe monarch, 83, officially stepped down from the throne Jan. 14—handing over duties to her eldest son Crown Prince Frederik, now King Frederik the 10th.\n\nThe abdication is Denmark's first in nearly 900 years, with the last event of its kind being in 1146 when King Erik relinquished his role to enter a monastery.\n\nTraditionally, the succession to the Danish throne has taken place following the death of a sovereign. But this time, it occurred when Margrethe—who will still be referred to as queen—signed a declaration of her abdication during a meeting of the Council of State at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen."
