However, this website often shows alternative parents of various persons according to various conflicting sources.\n\nThe latest born ancestor to have an alternate parentage is 16) Elizabeth (1409-1442) where Queen Mary of Hungary is listed as probably NOT her mother.\n\nSeveral generations higher up 12) Katharine von Pfannberg (died c. 1375) has an alternate ancestry for her mother Margaret of Werdenburg that is the same in the female line up to 6) Adelheid von Plain (c. 1185 - c. 1238) and her mother Ida von Burghausen whose mother is possibly Liutgard von Ravenstien or possible Sophie von Wettin who has two alternate pedigress. none of them lead to Saint Maragaret Queen of Scotland or her mother Agatha.\n\nIt is also possible that 12) Katharine von Pfannberg's mother was not Margaret of Werdenburg but Agnes von Walsee (died by 1329) daughter of Eberhard III von Walsee (died 1288) and Adelaide of Waldburg ((died after 1275).\n\nI am beginning to suspect that the person whose matrilineal ancestry goes back to Agatha might actually be Sophia's daughter-in-law, Sophie Dorothea, the imprisoned wife of King George I of England.\n\nObviously the best way to trace a long line of female descent is to start with someone recent and trace the female ancestry. Every person had to have a mother, while not all females have daughters who have daughters.\n\nFor European royalty and nobility Wikipedia often has ancestor charts going back four generations. So about five sets of them should reach someone born before 1500 and thus in the late middle ages. If the woman's family is covered in the Medieval Lands site then one can click on her mother and find her mother and so on as far back as Medieval Lands covers it.\n\nIn a previous post I did this and only got back seven generations from Empress Zita of Austria because of the relative obscurity of her ancestress in that generation. That is the problem with this. In the case of her husband or her father I knew their paternal lineages from father to grandfather are traced back many centuries. But one never knows how far back a maternal lineage can be traced until one tries it.\n\nBut if one selects present royal women more or less at random - not choosing any whose mothers you know were unusually low ranking - one is bound to sometimes find maternal lines of ancestry going back centuries into the middle ages and perhaps rivaling the longest ones mentioned so far.\n\nThis is still better than trying to trace a omen's female line descendants which involves a lot of dead ends here a woman doesn't have daughters and you have to back track up a generation or two and try descent though a sister. Just as only some men have sons who have sons, only some omen have daughters ho have daughters. Just as, for example, only a relatively small family can trace their male line ancestry from father to grandfather to King Owain Gwynedd of Gwynedd (died 1170) while thousand and thousands of royal and noble and common families can trace their ancestry to him though mixed lineages of both males and females, most descents from persons living a long time ago will be though mixed lineages of both males and females and only a small proportion though pure male descent or pure female descent.\n\nI am starting to doubt the line of maternal descent from Agatha, the wife of Edward the Exile (11th Century) to Sophie Electress of Hanover 18th century.\n\nI found some online sources that indicated Agatha was not the female line ancestress of Sophie.

No surviving daughters.\n\nIf anyone can trace female line descent from either of the daughters of number 16) Elizabeth of Luxemburg (1409-1442) to the present that would be a very long example of female descent.\n\nHowever, there is a question about the identity of Uta (died before 1170), the second wife of Liutold I, Count von Plain (died 1164). It is not certain if she was Uta of Austria, as given above, or Uta von Pielstein.\n\nCARINTHIA\n\nThis gives a shorter lineage:\n\n1) Ita (von Ratelburg?) (died 1101 or later on crusade) married Margrave Leopold II of Austria (1058/63-1095).\n\nAUSTRIA\n\n2) Euphemia of Austria (died 1130?) married Konrad I, Count von Tengling.\n\nAUSTRIA\n\n3) Uta of Pielstein (died by 1170) married Liutold I, Count von Plain (died 1164).\n\nAUSTRIA\n\nThus if this is the correct lineage number 6) Aelheid von Plain would actually be number 4) and number 27) Landgravine Caroline-Louisa of Hese-Darmstadt (1723-1783) would actually be number 25).\n\nThere is another problem since Medieval Lands says the first wife of Meinhard VI of Gorz was:\n\nm firstly (contract 18 Nov 1347) KATHARINA von Pfannberg, daughter of ULRICH III Graf von Pfannberg & his wife Agnes von Walsee (-[1374/75]). Heiress of Greiffenberg and Sumeregg.\n\nCARINTHIA\n\nWikipedia's article on Ulrich V Count of Pfannberg says:\n\nUlrich first wife was Agnes (d. 1329), the daughter of Ulrich of Walsee and Diemud of Rohrau. This marriage remained childless.\n\nAfter Agnes's death, but before 1331, Ulrich married Margaret, the daughter of Count Hugh II of Werdenberg and Euphemia of Ortenburg. They had three children:\n\nJohn (1321 – November 1362), last member of the House of Pfannberg in the male line, married\n\nin 1354 with Margaret (died after 1380), the daughter of Count Rudolf of Schaunberg\n\nin 1373 Count William III of Montfort (died c. 1379)\n\nCatherine (died after 1375), married in 1347 with Count Meinhard VI of Gorizia\n\nMargaret (died after 1374), married c. 1347 with Count Frederick of Ortenburg\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nAnd gives this reference for Ulrich V:\n\nKarlmann Tangl: Die Grafen von Pfannberg, in Archiv für Kunde österreichischer Geschichts-Quellen, vol. 18, Vienna, 1857\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrich_V,_Count_of_Pfannberg\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=JzNGvYbCM0MC&pg=PA221#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nwww.geni.com gives the female ancestry of Agnes of Walsee as:\n\nDiemut von Rohrau (1209/1269-1290)married Dietrich von Rohrau (died 1277).\n\nhttps://www.geni.com/people/Diemut-von-Rohrau/6000000003858786652\n\nhttps://www.geni.com/people/Dietrich-von-Rohrau/6000000003858651986\n\nDiemut of Walsee-Graz (von Rohrau) (c.1274-1308) married Ulrich I von Walsee-Graz.\n\nhttps://www.geni.com/people/Diemut-von-Walsee-Graz/6000000003858489356\n\nThat would make for a much shorter lineage.\n\nHere is another try for a long female lineage:\n\nMary Garrett m.

Mike Tindall.\n\nMia Tindall (born 2014).\n\nOops. It didn't turn out very long.\n\nThis Wikipedia page doesn't take the ancestry any farther.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestry_of_Elizabeth_II#Generation_7_.284th_great-grandparents.29\n\nThe problem is that husbands and wives are not always of the exact same social level and such differences sometimes add up over several generations.\n\nSuppose that 1) an emperor marries the daughter of a King of Kings. 2) The wife of the King of Kings was the daughter of a great king. 3) The wife of the great King was the daughter of a king. 4) The wife of the king was the daughter of an archduke. 4) The wife of the archduke was the daughter of a grand duke. 5) The wife of the grand duke was the daughter of a duke. 6) The wife of the duke was the daughter of a Prince (furst). 7) The wife of the Prince (furst) was the daughter of a count palatine. 8) The wife of the count palatine was the daughter of a margrave. 9) The wife of the margrave was the daughter of a landgrave. 10) The wife of the landgrave was the daughter of a princely count. 11) The wife of the princely count was the daughter of a count. 12) The wife of the count was the daughter of a baron. 13) The wife of the baron was the daughter of a knight. 14) The wife of the knight was the daughter of a gentleman. 15) The wife of the gentleman was the daughter of a farmer. 16) The wife of the farmer was the daughter of a free peasant. 17) The wife of the free peasant was the daughter of a serf. 18) The wife of the serf was the daughter of a slave.\n\nAnd that is an example of usually slight differences in status adding up to the difference between the highest and lowest status in 18 generations or about 360 to 540 years. And of course the farther back you go the higher a person's status has to be for their parents, especially their mother, to be recorded."
