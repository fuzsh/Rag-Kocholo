        "text": "King Frederik of Denmark has spent his life in the spotlight, as the heir apparent to one of Europe’s oldest monarchies, waiting in the wings for his time on the throne to arrive.\n\nAfter 55 years as Crown Prince, Frederik was crowned King of the Nordic nation on January 14th, 2024, after his mother Queen Margrethe announced she would be abdicating after 52 years in her annual New Year’s Eve address just two weeks prior.\n\nDespite previously saying she would follow in the footsteps of her late cousin, Queen Elizabeth II, and rule Denmark until she died, the 83-year-old revealed that she felt now was the time to “leave the responsibility [of the crown] to the next generation.”\n\nGiven Frederik is 24 years older than his mother was when succeeded to the throne at the age of just 31, we expect that his rule, whilst decades in the making, will be significantly shorter.\n\nScroll on for everything you need to know about King Frederik of Denmark…\n\nHow old is King Frederik of Denmark?\n\nKing Frederik of Denmark was born via an emergency cesarean section on May 26th, 1968 at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen.\n\nHe was christened less than a month later in Copenhagen on June 24th and was confirmed into the Church of Denmark in Fredensborg Palace Chapel three years later in 1981.\n\nHis younger brother, Prince Joachim, Count of Monzepat, was born 18 months later on June 7th, 1969.\n\nWhat is King Frederik of Denmark’s full name?\n\nWhen he was born, the future King of Denmark was named Frederik Andre Henrik Christian, Prince of Denmark, Crown Prince, Count of Monpezat.\n\nHe was named after his maternal grandfather, the former King of Denmark Frederick IX, his paternal grandfather Andrew de Laborde de Monpezat, and his father Prince Henrik of Denmark.\n\nHis official title is now King Frederik X.\n\nWhere did King Frederik of Denmark study?\n\nAfter graduating secondary school in 1986, the then Crown Prince went on to study at the University of Aarhus (which included time on exchange at Harvard University under an alias), where he graduated from in 1995 with a Masters in Political Science.\n\nFrom there, Frederik served his country with postings at the Danish UN Mission in New York, and then at the Royal Danish Embassy in Paris.\n\nDuring this time, the Crown Prince also commenced his military career, achieving the ranks of General in both the Army and Air Force and Admiral in the Navy.\n\nIn the years since the Crown Prince has been undertaking engagements on behalf of the Crown as a working royal. He is fluent in English, Danish, German and French.\n\nWho is King Frederik of Denmark married to?\n\nIn May 2004, Prince Frederik married Australian Mary Donaldson in Copenhagen, four years on since they had met by chance at a Sydney pub during the 2000 Olympics.\n\nWhilst the new Queen of Denmark clued on rather quickly that her new beau was royalty, when she was first speaking with him she had no idea!\n\n“Something clicked. It wasn’t the fireworks in the sky or anything like that but there was a sense of excitement,” the now mother of four said in a 2005 interview of their first encounter.\n\nAnd there wasn’t a dry eye in the house when Frederik read his vows to Mary, telling her emotionally that he was “hers.”\n\n“I love her and I will protect her with all my love,” he said at the time. Awww!\n\nWho are King Frederik of Denmark’s children?\n\nPrince Christian is now heir apparent and the new Crown Prince of Denmark after his father ascended to the throne. He was born on October 15th, 2005.\n\nHe has three younger siblings, Princess Isabella who was born in 2007, and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine who were born in 2011.\n\nWhere does King Frederik of Denmark live?\n\nAlongside his wife Queen Mary, and their three children, King Frederik of Denmark primarily resides at Frederik VIII’s residence at Amelienborg Castle in Copenhagen.\n\nThe castle is made up of four identical buildings which are set around an octagonal courtyard.\n\nIn the summer months, the family is also known to spend time at the Chancellery House in Fredensborg Palace, a 40-minute drive north of Copenhagen."
