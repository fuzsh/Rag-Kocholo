He was declared heir to the throne by the Rigsdag at Copenhagen on 30 October 1536.[1]\n\nHe succeeded on the death of his father in 1559 as King of Denmark and Norway, Duke of Schleswig and Holstein. He was crowned on 20 August 1559 at Frue-Kirke in København (Church of Our Lady, Copenhagen) by Niels Palladius, Bishop of Lund.[1]\n\nMarriage and children\n\nHe married at København Slot (Copenhagen Castle) 20 July 1572, his first cousin, Sophie, daughter of Ulrich, Herzog von Mecklenburg, and his wife, Elisabeth af Danmark. She was born 4 September 1557 at Wismar, and was crowned as Queen Consort on the same day as her wedding, at Frue Kirke by Poul Madsen, Bishop of Sjælland.[1] They had the following issue;[1]\n\nElisabeth, born 25 August 1573 at Koldinghuus, married 19 April 1590, Heinrich Julius, Herzog von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel, and died 19 July 1626 having had issue;\n\nAnna (Anne), born 12 December 1574 at Skanderborg, married 24 November 1589 at Agershuus, James VI, King of Scotland, later James I, King of England, and had issue;\n\nChristian IV, born 12 April 1577 at Frederiksborg, succeeded his father as King of Denmark;\n\nUlrik, born 30 December 1578 Koldinghuus, succeeded as Bishop of Schleswig 1602, and Bishop of Schwerin 1603, died 27 March 1624 at Bützow, and was eventually buried in Roskilde Domkirke in 1642;\n\nAugusta, born 8 April 1580 Koldinghuus, married 30 August 1596, Johan Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, died 5 February 1639 having had issue;\n\nHedvig, born 5 August 1581 at Frederiksborn, married 10 September 1602 at Dresden, Christian II, Elector of Saxony, died 26 November 1641 at Lichtenburg in Saxony;\n\nHans (Johan), born 26 July 1583 at Haderslevhuus, he was betrothed in 1601 to Xenia (Kseniya), the daughter of Boris Godunov, Tsar of Russia[1] and the following year travelled to Moscow and was presented to the Tsar and Tsarevitch in a grand ceremony on 18/28 September. He was at the Troitsa Monastery learning Russian and preparing for his baptism in the Russian Orthodox Church, when he fell ill and died on 18/28 October 1602. He was given a full state funeral in Moscow,[2] but his body was transferred to the Roskile Domkirke in 1637.[1]\n\nDisputed son\n\nAnother son, Hans August is mentioned in his father's Danish Wikipedia article as born and died in 1579, but as there is only 15 months between the birth of Ulrik on 30 December 1578 and Augusta on 8 April 1580, it seems impossible that another child could have been born in that time period. As the article has no sources for Hans August and he is not mentioned in any other independent sources, at this stage he is not included in the above list. As in some sources Ulrik is given the second name Hans, it is possible Hans August is a misreading of Ulrick Hans, and his sister Augusta.\n\nDeath and burial\n\nFrederik II, died 4 April 1588 at Antvorskov Slot, and was buried in Roskilde Domkirke (Roskilde Cathedral).[1] His monument in the De hellige tre Kongers Kapel (Chapel of the Magi) was built by the Flemish sculptor Gert van Egen from 1594-1598, but Frederik is actually buried below the floor of the chapel.[3]\n\nHis wife, died at Nykøbing Slot, near Falster, on 4 October 1631 and she is also buried in De hellige tre Kongers Kapel , Roskilde Domkirke.
