        "text": "Frederik IX (born March 11, 1899, Sorgenfri Castle, near Copenhagen, Denmark—died January 14, 1972, Copenhagen) was the king of Denmark (1947–72) who gave encouragement to the Danish resistance movement against the German occupation during World War II and, along with his father, Christian X, was imprisoned by the Germans (1943–45). A highly popular monarch, he maintained the ties of affection between the people and the royal house.\n\nThe eldest son of the future king Christian X and Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Frederik became crown prince in 1912 and joined the Danish navy in 1917. He rose to the rank of commander by 1935 and in 1946 became rear admiral. He married Ingrid (also in 1935), the only daughter of the crown prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden; their children were Margrethe, Benedikte, and Anne-Marie.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II"
