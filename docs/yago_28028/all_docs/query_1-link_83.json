        "text": "King Henry did not allow this match to succeed due to the fact that the Duke was related to queen consort Anne of Cleves, if Prince Philip can hold out until after the quuen consort is divorced on 9th July 1540.\n\nMarried in late 1540 or early 41, would make Lady Mary, thirty-four years old, more likely to have a child then she did at 46.\n\nColor me confused, since I don't get how Philipp's relation to Anna couts AGAINST him. It was one of the few things counting FOR him, so I would say that the divorce would need to be postponed (perhaps cause Anna is believed to be enceinte, or Henry needs the Protestant League on side a little longer with a Franco-Imperial threat rthat doesn't evaporate so quckly)\n\nColor me confused, since I don't get how Philipp's relation to Anna couts AGAINST him.

Philip proposed to Mary in 1539 and Henry said no, maybe due to fear of looking to favour one family over the others in Germany?\n\nIf Mary travels back to the Duchy of Palatinate-Neuburg, is there not a chance that the catholics would try and assassinate Philip to place Mary and her child as the new rulers of Palatinate-Neuburg?\n\nWhat happens when King Edward dies? Does Mary's claim get skipped in OTL and Lady Jane Grey become queen without any revolt? Would Mary or her children have a posistion within the line of succession?\n\nNot gonna happen is likely but this is alt history so let's assume Mary marries for the sake of argument.\n\nEvidence suggests the two were as fond as two people of different religous views could be. Mary is 24 at the time, not 34. The perfect age for children.\n\nPhil still dies in 1541, meaning the marriage is short but happy.\n\n1) Perhaps Mary is a mother of a legit kid who will be 17ish in 1558. Since she is a single mother and perhaps away out Henry (and Edward's) grasp the kid could be Protestant or Catholic depending on how much power Mary has over her kids upbringing (circumstances could vary greatly). Boy would be named Phillip or Edward, girl Katherine or Jane (after Jane Seymour).\n\n2) Mary, having the happiest time of her life caused by a marriage to a Lutheran, mellows. She is still a devout Catholic, but she is saner, happier, less embittered and while still pushing poppery, is more diplomatic about it. Not an expert on what killed her but perhaps a little less stress means a longer life.\n\nEvidence suggests the two were as fond as two people of different religous views could be. Mary is 24 at the time, not 34. The perfect age for children.\n\noh yer, maths wasn't my strongest point. So at 24, she is at an even better age to have a child.\n\nPhil still dies in 1541, meaning the marriage is short but happy.\n\nIn OTL, Philip died on 4th July 1548, so if they marry in 1539/40 that is still 8-9 years of happy marriage and gives us plenty of room to see Mary get pregnant.\n\n1) Perhaps Mary is a mother of a legit kid who will be 17ish in 1558.
