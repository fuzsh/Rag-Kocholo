        "text": "From 1814 to 1905 the King of Sweden was also king of Norway. But a discussion of the rightful heirs of those kings of Norway and Sweden should go in a thread about the rightful heir s o the various dynasties of kings of Sweden.\n\nIn 1814 Prince Christian of Denmark was selected as king of Norway by the independence movement but Norway was soon conquered by Sweden.\n\n1) Ex King Christian Frederick of Norway reigned as King Christian VIII of Denmark from 1839-1848.\n\n2) King Frederick VII of Denmark (1808-1863) , only legitimate child. King Frederick VII had no known children.\n\nOf course King Frederick VII of Denmark had relatives and heirs, but they should be listed in a discussion of the heirs of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nBefore the first King of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden of the House of Oldenburg, Charles Knutsson Bonde (King Charles II or VIII of Sweden three times) was king of Norway from 20 November 1449 to June 1450.\n\nMany of Charles's children died young, but his son and chosen heir Charles Bonde (1465-1488) lived to be about 23 and might have left descendants. If Charles Bonde (1465-1488) has no descendants, the rightful heirs of King Charles would be the heirs of his oldest surviving daughter Christina Karlsdotter (c.1432-before 1500) who married Erik Eriksson of the Glyenstierna family would probably be his heirs.\n\nThe previous king of Norway (from 1442-1448), Christopher King of Denmark and Sweden and Count palatine of Neumarkt, had no children, and no surviving siblings. His claim to the throne was through his mother Katherinea of Pomerania, the only sibling of the childless King Erik III & VII of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Their claim was through their mother, Marie of Mecklenburg. Marie of Mecklenburg was the daughter of Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Ingeborg of Denmark. And apparently King Christopher was the last surviving descendant of Ingeborg of Denmark.\n\nKing Olaf II of Denmark (1370-1387) was the previous king , Olaf IV, of Norway, reigning from 1381 to 1387. He died childless. His claim to Norway was through his father, King Haakon VI & I of Norway & Sweden. King Haakon of Noway & Sweden had no other children, and his father King Magnus IV & VII of Norway and Sweden had no surviving descendants after King Olaf II & IV.\n\nBut King Magnus of Norway and Sweden did have a sister, Euphemia, who married Albrecht, created Duke of Mecklenburg in 1318. Albrecht had sons who succeeded their father as joint dukes of Mecklenburg in 1379.\n\nOne of them, Albrecht, became king of Sweden from 1364 to 1389 when he was deposed. Alberecht's only child to be have children, Richardis (d. 1400) married Johann of Bohemia, Duke of Gorlitz and Margrave of Brandenburg. Their daughter 1) Elizabeth of Luxembourg, Duchess of Luxembourg (1390-1451) became the rightful heiress of Norway and Sweden in 1448. She married twice but had no surviving children.\n\nThen the heirship to Norway and Sweden passed to the descendants of the brothers of King Albert. One of them, Henry, married Ingeborg of Denmark, and their last descendant was King Christoper of Norway, Sweden,and Denmark (died 1448).The third bother was Duke Magnus (died 1385).\n\nDuke Magnus of Mecklenburg was the father of Duke Johann IV (died 1422).\n\nDuke Johann IV was the father of 2) Duke Henry IV the Fat (died 1477) who became the rightful heir of Norwegian kings Magnus VII, Haakon VI, Olaf IV, Erik III, and Christopher in 1451.\n\n2) Duke Henry IV of Mecklenburg was succeed by three sons.\n\n3) Duke Albrecht of Mecklenburg (1438-1483) oldest son of 2) Henry IV, had no children. His younger brother 4) Duke Magnus II (1441-1503) Had children.\n\n5) Duke Henry V (1479-1552), the oldest son of 4) Duke Magnus II had a son Magnus who was childless, so Henry V's oldest daughter Sophie (1508-1541) would become the ancestor of his heirs to the claim to Norway. She married Duke Ernest of Brunswick Luneburg.\n\nTheir third son 6) Henry (1533-1598) became Duke of Brunswick Dannenberg.\n\n6) Henry's son 7) Julius Ernest (1571 -1636) had an only surviving child 8) Maria Katerina (1616-1665) who married Duke Adolph Frederick of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nDuke Adolph Frederick of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and his second wife 8) Maria Katerina had an oldest son 9) Frederick William (1675-1715) who had no legitimate children.\n\nThe second brother, 10) Duke Karl Leopold (1678-1747) had a daughter Elizabeth/Anna (1718-1746) who married Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick was and the mother of 11) Tsar Ivan IV (1740-1764) who died childless.\n\n11) Tsar Ivan IV (1740-1764)'s rightful heir was his brother 12) Peter (1745-1798) who died childless.\n\n12) Peter's rightful heir was his sister 13) Catherine (1741-1807) who died childless.\n\nCarl Leopold's youngest brother was Duke Christian Ludwig (1683-1756).\n\nDuke Christian Ludwig (1683-1756)'s second son was Duke Ludwig (1725-1778).\n\nDuke Ludwig (1725-1778)'s.son 14) Grand duke Fredrick Franz of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1756-1837) became the heir to the claim to Norway in 1807.\n\n14) Grand duke Fredrick Franz's son Frederick Ludwig (1778-1819) died before his father, but was the father of 15) Grand Duke Paul Frederick (1800-1842).\n\n15) Grand Duke Paul Frederick (1800-1842) was the father of 16) Grand Duke Frederick Franz II (1823-1883).\n\n16) Grand Duke Frederick Franz II (1823-1883) was the father of 17) Grand Duke Frederick Franz III (1851-1897).\n\n17) Grand Duke Frederick Franz III (1851-1897) was the father of 18) Grand Duke Frederick Franz IV (1882-1945).\n\n19) Grand Duke Frederick Franz IV (1882-1945) was the father of 20) Frederick Franz (1910-2001) who was childless.\n\n20) Frederick Franz (1910-2001)'s brother Christian Louis (1912-1996) had an older daughter 22) Donata (born 1956) who his married and has children, and is the heir to that claim to Norway.\n\nOf course there were many earlier kings of Norway before King Magnus VII (reigned 1319-1346) whose heirs can be discussed.\n\n.\n\nIN my post # 2 in this thread, I traced the descendants of Norwegian Kings Magnus VII (1319-1343), Haakon VI (1343-1380), Olaf IV (1380-1387), Erik III (1389-1442), and Christoper (1442-1448). Since Magnus VII inherited through female liens of descent, and since Erik III and Christopher inherited through female lines of descent, it seems rather clear that it was possible to inherit the Norwegian throne thorugh female lines of descent. Which was good for those five monarchs because they have no present day agnatic (male line only) descendants - in fact no present day legitimate descendants at all.\n\nBut King Magnus of Norway and Sweden did have a sister, Euphemia, who married Albrecht, created Duke of Mecklenburg in 1348. Albrecht had sons who succeeded their father as joint dukes of Mecklenburg in 1379.\n\nOne of them, Albrecht, became king of Sweden from 1364 to 1389 when he was deposed. Alberecht's only child to be have children, Richardis (d. 1400) married Johann of Bohemia, Duke of Gorlitz and Margrave of Brandenburg. Their daughter:\n\nElizabeth of Luxembourg, Duchess of Luxembourg (1390-1451) became the rightful heiress of King Christopher of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden in 1448, but died within the lifetime of deposed King Erick III, VII, and XIII of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. She married twice but had no surviving children.\n\nThen the heirship to Norway and Sweden passed to the descendants of the brothers of King Albert. One of them, Henry, married Ingeborg of Denmark, and their last descendant was King Christoper of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark (died 1448).The third bother was Duke Magnus (died 1385).\n\nDuke Magnus of Mecklenburg was the father of Duke Johann IV (died 1422).\n\nDuke Johann IV was the father of\n\n1) Duke Henry IV the Fat (died 1477) who became the rightful heir of Norwegian kings Magnus VII, Haakon VI, Olaf IV, Erik III, and Christopher in 1459 when the deposed king Erik III finally died in 1459.\n\n1) Duke Henry IV of Mecklenburg was succeed by three sons.\n\n2) Duke Albrecht of Mecklenburg (1438-1483) oldest son of 1) Henry IV, had no children. His younger brother 3) Duke Magnus II (1441-1503) had children.\n\n4) Duke Henry V (1479-1552), the oldest son of 3) Duke Magnus II had a son 5) Duke Magnus III (1509-1550) who was childless, so Henry V's oldest daughter Sophie (1508-1541) would become the ancestor of his heirs to the claim to Norway. She married Duke Ernest of Brunswick Luneburg.\n\nBut the dynasty of Mecklenburg practiced agnatic inheritance, in which the throne could only go to males descended in in unbroken male lineage from the founder could inherit Mecklenburg. If one supposes that the claim to the kingdom of Norway passed through Aagnatic descent along with Mecklenburg, then 4) Duke Henry V (1459-1552)'s claim to Norwaway would pass to his nearest agnatic heir descended from Duke Magnus of Mecklenburg (died 1385).\n\n4) Duke Henry V (1459-1552)'s next oldest brother was Erich (1483-1508) who died unmarried. The next brother Albrecht VI (1488-1547) continued the dynasty.\n\nDuke Albrecht VI (1488-1547) was the father of:\n\n6) Duke Johann Albrecht I of Mecklenburg-Gustrow (1525-1576) the father of\n\n7)Johann VII of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1558-1589) father of:\n\n8) Duke Adolf Frederick I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1588-1558) father of:\n\n9) Duke Christian Ludwig of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1623-1692) Childless. Half brother of Duke Frederick I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1638-1688) father of:\n\n10) Duke Frederick William of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1675-1713) who had no legitimate children. He was the brother of:\n\n11) Duke Karl Leopold of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1678-1747) who had a daughter but no sons, and was the brother of:\n\n12) Duke Christian Ludwig of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1683-1756) was the father of:\n\n13) Duke Frederick of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1718-1775) who had no children but was the brother of:\n\nDuke Ludwig of Mecklengburg-Schwerin (1725-1778) who was the father of:\n\n14) Grand duke Fredrick Franz of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1756-1837) who was the father of Frederick Ludwig (1778-1819) who died before his father, but was the father of: 15) Grand Duke Paul Frederick (1800-1842).\n\n15) Grand Duke Paul Frederick (1800-1842) was the father of:\n\n16) Grand Duke Frederick Franz II (1823-1883). was the father of:\n\n17) Grand Duke Frederick Franz III (1851-1897) Was the father of:\n\n18) Grand Duke Frederick Franz IV (1882-1945) was the father of:.\n\n19) Frederick Franz (1910-2001) who was childless, and was the brother of Christian Louis (1912-1996) who had daughters but no sons. He was the last member of the dynasty of Mecklenburg-Schwerin .\n\nBut:\n\n8) Duke Adolf Frederick I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1588-1558), the ancestor of the Grand Dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, had a youngest son Duke Adolf Frederick II of Mecklennburg-Strelitz (1658-1708), who was the father of Duke Adolf Frederick III of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1686-1752), who had no sons but a brother Karl Ludwig Frederick (1708-1752), who was the father of Duke Adolf Frederick IV of Mecklennburg-Strelitz (1738-1794), who was childless but had a brother Duke Karl Ludwig Frederick of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1741-1816), father of Grand Duke George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1779-1860), father of Grand Duke Frederick William of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1819-1904), father of Grand Duke Adolf Frederick V of Mecklengburg-Strelitz (1848-1914), father of Grand Duke Adolf Frederick VI of Mecklengburg-Strelitz (1881-1918), who died unmarried.\n\nAt that time the only only person with dynastic rights in Mecklenburg-Strelitz was a cousin, Duke Charles Michael (1863-1934), son of Duke George August ,younger son of Grand Duke George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1779-1860). Charles Michael served in the Russian army during WWI, renounced his rights to the throne, and didn't have any children. His older brother George Alexander (1859-1909) made an unequal or morganic marriage, the children of which were not counted as part of the dynasty. But Charles Miachel adopted George Alexander's son Georg (1899-1963) to make him his heir. George (1899-1963)'s older son George Alexander (1921-1996), was the father of:\n\n20) Duke Borwin (born 1956) the current head of the dynasty of Mecklenburg who became the heir to the Mecklenburg claim to Norway (in the agnatic line) in 2001, while his distant cousin Donata became the heir to the Mecklenburg claim to Norway by male preference cognatic primogeniture in 2001.\n\nIn 1176 Sverre Sigardsson came to Norway and claimed to be the illegitimate son of King Sigurd Haraldsson. He became a leader of one faction in the civil wars and gained the crown of Norway. His heirs were:\n\n1) King Haakon III Sverreson (d. 1204), illegitimate son, was king of Norway 1202-1204.\n\n2) King Haakon IV Haakonsson (1204-1263) illegitimate son of Haakon III, was king of Norway 1217-1263. Was the father of Haakon Hakonsson (1232-1257), co King of Norway, father of:\n\n3) Severre Magnus Haakonsson (died 1261). His uncle was:\n\n4) King Magnus IV Lawmender (1238-1280), son of # 2).

She married Duke Valdemar Magnussson and had a child Erik Valdemarsson who was born in 1316 and died young. Ingeborg's uncle King Haakon V (1270-1319), younger son of Magnus IV, had one legitimate child:\n\n7) Ingeborg Haakonsdatter (1301-after 1360). Married Duke Erik Magnusson, and was the mother of:\n\n8) King Magnus (1316-1374) V of Norway 1319-1344 and II of Sweden 1319-1363, father of Erik Magnusson (1339?-1359), the father of of a son born & died 1359.

With his death the heirship of King Severre of Norway passed to the descendants of Euphemia Eriksdatter (1317?-1363/70), sister of 8) King Magnus (1316-1374) V of Norway 1319-1344 and II of Sweden 1319-1363.\n\nEuphemia Eriksdatter (1317?-1363/70) married Lord Albrecht II of Mecklenburg (1318?-1379), promoted to Duke Albrecht I of Mecklenburg in 1348. He was the father of:\n\n11) King Albrecht (1340?-1412), Duke Albrecht III of Mecklenburg, presumably the oldest son, since he was King of Sweden replacing 9) King Haakon Magnussson from 1364-1389.

And here there is a division between the heir by male preference primogeniture and the heir by agnatic primogeniture. By male preference primogeniture the line is:\n\nSophie (1508-1541), sister of Philip and daughter of Henry V. Married Duke Ernest of Brunswick Luneburg (1497-1546). Their third son:\n\n19) Henry (1533-1598) became Duke of Brunswick Dannenberg.

He was the last member of the dynasty of Mecklenburg-Schwerin .\n\nBut:\n\n21) Duke Adolf Frederick I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1588-1658), the ancestor of the Grand Dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, had a youngest son Duke Adolf Frederick II of Mecklennburg-Strelitz (1658-1708), who was the father of Duke Adolf Frederick III of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1686-1752), who had no sons but a brother Karl Ludwig Frederick (1708-1752), who was the father of Duke Adolf Frederick IV of Mecklennburg-Strelitz (1738-1794), who was childless but had a brother Duke Karl Ludwig Frederick of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1741-1816), father of Grand Duke George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1779-1860), father of Grand Duke Frederick William of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1819-1904), father of Grand Duke Adolf Frederick V of Mecklengburg-Strelitz (1848-1914), father of Grand Duke Adolf Frederick VI of Mecklengburg-Strelitz (1881-1918), who died unmarried.\n\nAt that time the only only person with dynastic rights in Mecklenburg-Strelitz was a cousin, Duke Charles Michael (1863-1934), son of Duke George August ,younger son of Grand Duke George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1779-1860). Charles Michael served in the Russian army during WWI, renounced his rights to the throne, and didn't have any children. His older brother George Alexander (1859-1909) made an unequal or morganic marriage, the children of which were not counted as part of the dynasty. But Charles Miachel adopted George Alexander's son Georg (1899-1963) to make him his heir. George (1899-1963)'s older son George Alexander (1921-1996), was the father of:\n\n33) Duke Borwin (born 1956) the current head of the dynasty of Mecklenburg who became the 33rd heir to King Sverre of Norway by agnatic primogeniture in 2001, while his seventh cousin once removed Donata became the 32nd heir to the King Sverre of Norway by male preference primogeniture in 2001. You will note that the lines of succession are corrected in one or two places from the versions in post # 2 and post # 3.\n\nHeirs of the first three kings of the Union of Kalmar. Continued from Post # 5.\n\nPost number 5 begins quite abruptly with Katarina of Werle (d. 1475/80) nearest cousin of King Erik of Pomerania. Married Duke Ulrich II of Mecklenburg-Stargard (1438?-1471). I had to shorten it to fit in the length limit. Here is the justification for making Katarina of Werle the heir of King Erik of Pomerania.\n\nThe first ruler of the Union of Kalmar was Margaret (1353-1412), who ruled in the name of her selected heir, Erik of Pomerania, who she made king of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Margaret selected Erik from her relatives descended from Danish kings, not the relatives of her husband King Haakon of Norway and Sweden.\n\nMargaret was the daughter of King Valdemar IV \"Atterdag\" of Denmark. Her only child, King Olaf II of Denmark and IV of Norway, who was also the more or less rightful king of Sweden, died childless in 1387. Margaret's only sibling to have children was Ingeborg (1347-70), who married Duke Heinrich (Henry) of Mecklenburg. DENMARK KINGS\n\nIngeborg and Henry had a son Albrecht who died childless in 1387/88. Since his mother was older than Margaret, by genealogy Albrecht (died 1387/88) should have been King of Denmark instead of Olaf while Olaf should have been King of of Sweden instead of Albrecht of Mecklenburg (d. 1412) who was next in line after Olaf and an uncle of Albrecht of Mecklenburg (died 1387/88). MECKLENBURG\n\nNext in line after Albrecht - the one who died in 1387 or 1388 and not the one who died in 1412 - were his sisters. Euphemia (d. 1400) married in 1377 Johann V Prince of Werle-Gustrow but didn't have any children. MECKLENBURG\n\nThe youngest sister Ingeburg (1368-1408) became a nun in 1377 and didn't have any children. The other sister Marie (1363/67-1402) married Wartislaw VII Duke of Pomerania. MECKLENBURG\n\nMarie and Wartislaw had two children, Erik (1381?-1459) and Katarina (1390?-1426). After King Olaf died in 1387 Margaret passed over Albrecht (d.1387/88) if he was still alive, and Albrecht's sisters Euphemia, Marie, and Ingeburg, and adopted Erik and Katarina as her heirs. POMERANIA\n\nMargaret made Erik King of Norway in 1389 and king of Denmark and Sweden in 1396, but he was deposed in 1439. Katarina married Johann Count Palatine of Neumarkt (1983?-1443). POMERANIA They had five children who died young and Christoph (1416-1448, who became King Christopher of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway in 1440 but died without any children. That left the childless ex king Erik as the last surviving descendant of King Valdemar IV \"Atterdag\" of Denmark, and Erik died in 1459.\n\nKing Valdemar IV \"Atterdag\" of Denmark (1320?-75) was a son of King Christopher II of Denmark (1276-1332). Christopher's daughter Margaret (1305?-40) married Ludwig V of Bavaria, Elector of Brandenburg (1316-61) and had a son Matthias who seems to have died young. BAVARIA DUKES None of Christopher's other legitimate children are known to have had children. Christopher's brother King Erik VI \"Maendved\" (1274-1319) had no surviving children. Their sister Margaret married King Birger of Sweden but they don't seem to have had any grandchildren. SWEDEN KINGS The other married sister of King Erik VI and King Christopher II, Richiza (d. 1303/08), married Nikolaus II Lord of Werle Parchim . DENMARK KINGS\n\nThe lords of Werle were a branch of the dynasty of the Dukes of Mecklenburg. Richiza (d. 1303/08) and Nikolaus II of Werle Parchim (d. 1316) had a daughter Sophie who was an ancestor of King Christian I of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. But they also had a son Johann III of Werle (d. 1352), father of Nikolaus IV of Werle (d. 1354) who had a son Johann IV of Werle who died childless in 1374. Johann IV of Werle had two sisters who married, Mechtild (d. 1402) and Agnes (d. 1383). MECKLENBURG\n\nAgnes (d. 1383) married Johann VI of Werle (d.1389/95) and had a son Nikolaus V (d. 1408) who had a daughter Jutta of Werle (d. before 1427) who married Duke Heinrich (Henry) of Mecklenburg-Stargard (d.1466) as his first wife. They had no children, but Duke Henry had a son Duke Ulrich II (1428?-1477) by his second wife Ingeborg of Pomerania. MECKLENBURG MECKLENBURG MECKLENBURG\n\nMechtild (d. 1402) Married Lord Lorenz of Werle (d. 1393) and had three childless sons, Balthasar, Johann VII, and Nikolaus, and a son Wilhelm (d. 1436) who had a daughter Katharina of Werle (d.1475/80) who married Duke Ulrich II (1428?-1477) of Mecklenburg-Stargard. MECKLENBURG MECKLENBURG Their daughter Elizabeth (died 1532) was a prioress and thus childless. Their other daughter Ingeborg (d. 1509) married Count Everwin II of Bentheim (d. 1530).\n\nAnd post # 5 traced the heirs of Ingeborg (d. 1509) and Count Everwin II of Bentheim (d. 1530). And all of the above is necessary to explain and prove the statement that Katharina of Werle (d. 1475/80) was the rightful heir of ex King Erik of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark who died in 1459.\n\nHeirs of the Fairhair dynasty part One.\n\nAccording to later medieval legends, King Harald I Fairhair conquered 20 or 30 small kingdoms and united most of Norway about 872. According to medieval historians, the Fairhair dynasty of agnatic (male line) descendants of Harald Fairhair ruled Norway on and off for about 447 years until Haakon V Magnusson died in 1319. But many modern historians have doubts about the Fairhair dynasty and divide it into smaller sub dynasties that might or might not have part of the Fairhair dynasty.\n\nAs Wikipedia says:\n\nSub-dynasties of Fairhair dynasty[edit]\n\nThe problem points (points of broken genealogy) in the medieval royal lineage in the so-called Fairhair dynasty are:[13]\n\nwhether either Olav I of Norway or Olav II of Norway descended from Harald I of Norway (Harald Fairhair)\n\nwhether Harald III of Norway descended from Harald I\n\nwhether Harald IV of Norway was son of King Magnus III of Norway\n\nwhether King Sverre was son of King Sigurd II of Norway,\n\nwhether Haakon IV of Norway was son of King Haakon III\n\nEach of them came from \"nowhere\" and won the kingdom, the three latter claiming to be hitherto unknown natural sons of an earlier king.\n\nFirst Sub Dynasty\n\nHarold I Fairhair was supposedly born about 853/54 or 860, conquered much of Norway about 872, abdicated about 930 in favor of his son Erik Bloodaxe, and died about 933, 934, or 940, aged about 73 to 87. That age would probably make him older than any later Norwegian king until Erik of Pomerania (c. 1381-1459) aged about 78. Harold's strict new regime allegedly caused many Norwegians to emigrate to Iceland. Harold allegedly granted various lands to his sons to rule as subkings with Harold the high king over them.\n\nHarold's son Erik Bloodaxe (895?-954) allegedly became the next high king and killed several of his brothers. Erik's teenage and Christian half brother Haakon I the Good (c.919-960) came to Norway and overthrew Erik who fled from the country. According to the sagas, Erik had many adventures after leaving Norway. There are contemporary records of a man named Erik who became king of the Scandinavian kingdom of Northumbria in England in 947-948 and in 952-954, and sagas written centuries later and beleived by most modern historians say that Erik Bloodaxe was that King Erik of Northumbria.\n\nErik's numerous sons kept invading Norway and being defeated and killed, until In 960 Erik's son Harold II \"Greycloak\" and his remaining brothers killed Haakon. Harold II was defeated and killed in 965 or in 970. Gudrod Eriksson, the last surviving brother, invaded Norway in 999 but was killed.\n\nErik Bloodaxe and his wife Gunnhild, said by some to be the daughter of King Gorm the Old of Denmark, allegedly had seven sons and one daughter sons and one daughter. The daughter Ragnhild was allegedly married to Jarl Arnfinn Thorfinnsson of Orkney, so of Thorfinn \"Skull Cleaver\". Arnfinn married Ragnhild about 965/55 and became Jarl in about 976, but was murdered by his wife's plot. Ragnhild then married Arnfinn's brother Havard, Jarl of Orkney, but eventually had him murdered. Ragnhild then married their very brave brother Ljot Thorfinnsson who was killed - in a war this time. Ragnhild doesn''t seem to have had any sons by Arnfinn, Hvard, or Ljot. http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SCOTTISH%20NOBILITY.htm#ArnfinnMRagnhildEiriksd\n\nSome people might claim that Ragnhild's status as potential heiress of Erik Bloodaxe might be considered to have been transferred to heir three husbands, and after them to their brothers that later Jarls of Orkney were descended from. Thus descendants of the Norse Jarls of Orkney could be considered s possible heirs of a sort of the first sub dynasty of the Fairhair dynasty.\n\nSome people might say that the claim to be the heirs of first sub dynasty of the Fairhair dynasty could pass to the relatives of Erik Bloodaxe's wife Gunnhild, said by some to be the daughter of King Gorm the Old of Denmark, who has many descendants to this day.\n\nSome people might say that the claim to be the heirs of first sub dynasty of the Fairhair dynasty could pass to the relatives of Erik Bloodaxe's mother, the sixth wife of King Harold I. She was Ragnhild, daughter of King Rorik/Horik/Erik of Denmark who probably doesn't have traceable descendants.\n\nSome people might say that the claim to be the heirs of first sub dynasty of the Fairhair dynasty could pass to the relatives of Harold I's mother Ragnhild, who was supposedly a daughter of Sigurd Hart and a sister of Thyre who married Gorm the Old.\n\nAnd some other such links could be made.\n\nHeirs of the Fairhair Dynasty Part Two.\n\n1. King Harold I (d. about 930 to 940?) who conquered and united Norway. Father of:\n\n2. King Erik Bloodaxe (c. 895-954) the chosen heir. Father of:\n\n3. Gamle, oldest son (killed 955).

Harek of Thjotta (killed 1040), son of Eyvind Skaldaspiller (d. 990), son of Fin Skjalge and Gunhild Halfdansdatter, daughter of Jalfdan Jarl and his wife Ingeborg of Norway, illegitimate daughter of King Harold I.

Married her cousin Frederick Ferdinand Prince of Denmark (1792-1863). Childless. Sister of:\n\n14. Wilhelmine (1808-91) Sister. Married first future King Frederick VII of Denmark (1808-1863).

Ernest Gunther, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (1863-1921) , son of Duke Frederick VIII of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1829-80), son of Duke Christian August II of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1798-1869), son of Duke Fredrick Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1765-1814) and Louisa Augusta of Denmark (1771-1843) daughter of number 10. King Christian VII. Ernest Gunther was childless. Brother of:\n\n16. Augusta Victoria (1858-1921) Married German Emperor Wilhelm II (1859-1941) Mother of:\n\n17.

Hubertus Christoph Joachim Friedrich von der Osten born 1964).\n\nBut if it is desired for the succession of Denmark to pass according to the dynastic laws of the Hohenzollerns, the heirs of # 17 Crown Prince Wilhelm are:\n\n19. Louis Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia (1907-94) Grandfather of:\n\n20. George Frederick Prince of Prussia (b. 1976) son of Louis Ferdinand (1944-77). Father of:\n\nPrince Carl Friedrich (b. 2013).\n\nBut the childless number 15. Ernest Gunther adopted two of his cousins:\n\n15. Johann George (1911-41) Childless. Brother of:\n\n16. Marie Louisa (1908-69) Married first Baron Rudolf-Carl von Stengel and had children.\n\nBut there were doubts whether Louisa Augusta of Denmark (1771-1843) daughter of number 10. King Christian VII, really was his daughter. So perhaps the heir should be chosen from the next closest Danish relative whose paternity is not suspected. Then the heirs would be:\n\n15. Alexander Frederick, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel (1863-1945), son of Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Hesse-Cassel (1820-84), son of Wilhelm I, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel-Rumpenheim (1787-1867) and his wife Princess Louise Charlotte of Denmark (1789-1864), daughter of Hereditary Prince of Denmark and Norway Frederick (1753-1805), son of number 9 King Frederick V. Made an unequal marriage, not stated if there were children. Brother of:\n\n16. Frederick Landgrave of Hesse (1868-1914). Briefly King of Finland in 1918. Father of:\n\n17. Philip, Landgrave of Hesse (1896-1980) Father of:\n\n18. Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse (1926-2013) Father of:\n\n19. Landgrave Heinrich Donatus Philipp Umberto of Hesse (b.1966) Married & has 2 sons and a daughter.\n\nOf course the Danish succession law was agnatic (male only) so the heir of King Frederick VI in 1839 was:\n\n13. King Christian VIII of Denmark (1786-1848) son of Hereditary Prince of Denmark and Norway Frederick (1753-1805), son of number 9 King Frederick V. H was briefly King Christian Frederick of Norway in 1814. Father of:\n\n14. King Fredrick VII (1808-1863). Only child of his father. No children. And then the succession by agnatic (male only) primogeniture passed to distant cousins which will be covered in another post."
