        "text": "If you’ve read my previous blog on James VI + I of Scotland and England, you would know who Anne of Denmark was. For those who didn’t, she is his wife.\n\nBut who is this Queen of Scotland and England?\n\nOn 12 December 1574 Anne was born at Skanderborg Castle, Denmark. Another daughter to King Frederick II of Denmark and Sophie of Mecklenburg-Gustrow. Another girl was a blow to her father, who so desperately wanted a son, like all monarchs it seems. Don’t despair for King Frederick II, a son was born three years later, the future Christian IV of Denmark.\n\nAnne along with her sister, Elizabeth of Denmark, were sent to be raised by her maternal grandparents, Ulrich, Duke of Mecklenburg and Elizabeth of Denmark, Duchess of Mecklenburg at Gustrow in Germany. Unlike the Danish court, where Frederick II was notorious for large meals, heavy drinking and marital infidelity, Gustrow provided Anne and Elizabeth with a prudent and stable life during her early childhood. Later their younger brother, Christian, was sent to be brought up at Gustrow, but two years later in 1579, the Danish Privy Council called the Rigsraad, successfully requested his removal to Denmark, along with Anne and Elizabeth.\n\nLargely due to Sophie of Mecklenburg-Gustrow, Anne enjoyed a close and happy family upbringing in Denmark.\n\nJames VI of Scotland was looking for a future bride. At first, he looked towards Catherine de Bourbon, sister of the Huguenot King Henry III of Navarre, even though she was eight years his senior she was also favoured by Elizabeth I of England.\n\nThen he set his eyes towards Denmark, who he favoured as a kingdom reformed in religion and a profitable trading partner. Scottish ambassadors had at first concentrated their suit on Elizabeth of Denmark, but Frederick II betrothed her to Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg, promising the Scots instead “for the second [daughter] Anna, if the King did like her, he should have her”.\n\nOn 4 April 1588 King Frederick II of Denmark died, which left Sophie of Mecklenburg-Gustrow in a difficult position, when she found herself in a power struggle with the Rigsraad (Danish Privy Council) for control of the nearly eleven-year-old King Christian IV of Denmark.\n\nHowever, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Gustrow proved a more diligent marriage negotiator than Frederick II. Overcoming obstacles on the amount of the dowry and the status of Orkney, she sealed the agreement by July 1589.\n\nIt also seems that Anne was thrilled by the match. On 28 July 1589, an English spy, Thomas Fowler, reported that Anne was “so far in love with the King’s Majesty as it were death to her to have it broken off and hath made good proof divers ways of her affection which his Majestie is apt in now way to requite”. Thomas Fowler’s claim that James preferred men over women would have been hidden from the now fourteen-year-old Anne.\n\nWhatever the rumours were, James required a royal match to preserve the Stuart line. He explained, “God is my witness, I could have abstained longer than the weal of my country could have permitted, [had not] my long delay bred in the breasts of many a great jealousy of my inability, as if I were barren stock”.\n\nOn 20 August 1589, Anne was married by proxy to James at Kronborg Castle. The ceremony ending with James’ representative, George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, sitting next to Anne on the bridal bed.\n\nTen days after the proxy wedding, Anne set sail for Scotland. Unfortunately, due to fierce storms, was forced to the coast of Norway, then traveling by land to Oslo for refuge. She was accompanied by George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal and other of the Scottish and Danish embassies.\n\nOn 12 September 1589, Richard Preston, 1st Earl of Desmond, had landed at Leith reporting that “he had come in company with the Queen’s fleet three hundred miles, and was separated from them by a great storm: it was feared that the Queen was in danger upon the seas”.\n\nAlarmed, James called for national fasting and public prayers. He also sent out a search party to find Anne, carrying a letter he had written to her in French, “Only to one who knows me as well as his own reflection is a glass could I express, my dearest love, the fears which I have experienced because of the contrary winds and violent storms since you embarked…”.\n\nWhen James was informed that the Danes had abandoned the crossing for the winter, in what now James’s one romantic episode of his life, he sailed to Leith with a three-hundred-strong retinue to fetch his wife personally. On 19 November 1589, James arrived in Oslo after travelling by land from Flekkefjord via Tonsberg. According to a Scottish account, James presented himself to Anne, “with boots and all”, and disarming her protests, gave her a kiss in the Scottish fashion.\n\nOn 23 November 1589, James and Anne were formally married at the Old Bishop’s Palace in Oslo, “with all the splendour possible at that time and place”. Leith minister David Lindsay conducted the ceremony in French so both Anne and James could understand. Leith minister David Lindsay described Anne as “a Princess both godly and beautiful… she giveth great contentment to his Majesty”. After a month of celebrations, the newly married couple Kronborg Castle in Elsinore on 22 December 1589, where they were greeted by Sophie of Mecklenburg-Gustrow, twelve-year-old King Charles IV, and his four regents. On 7 March 1590, they moved onto Copenhagen and attended the wedding of Anne’s sister, Elizabeth to Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick, then two days later, sailing for Scotland.\n\nOn 1 May 1590, Anne finally arrived in Scotland. After a welcoming speech in French by James Elphinstone, 1st Lord Balmerino, Anne stayed in the King’s Wark while James went alone to hear a sermon by Patrick Galloway in the Parish Church. Anne made her state entry into Edinburgh five days later in a solid silver coach brought over from Denmark, while James rode alongside her on horseback.\n\nOn 17 May 1590, Anne was crowned in the Abbey Church at Holyrood, the first Protestant coronation in Scotland. During the seven-hour ceremony, her gown was opened for presiding minister Robert Bruce to pour “a bonny quantity of oil” on “parts of her breast and arm”, anointing her as Queen. This ceremony was objected fervently as a pagan and Jewish ritual, but James insisted that it dated from the Old Testament. James handed the crown to Chancellor John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane, who placed it on Anne’s head. She then declared an oath to defend the true religion and worship of God and to “withstand and despise all papistical superstitions, and whatsoever ceremonies and rites contrary to the word of God”.\n\nIt seems like all marriages of this time, Anne was under pressure to provide James and Scotland with an heir, preferably a male one even though there has been Queens of England and Scotland. With the passing of time and still no sign of pregnancy, this provoked renewed Presbyterian libels on the theme of James’ fondness for male company. There were also whispers against Anne, “for that she proves with no child”.\n\nThere was a sigh of relief when Anne gave birth to a boy on 19 February 1594, Henry Frederick.\n\nBy all accounts James and Anne were infatuated with each other in their early years of marriage, however, this evaporated quickly and the couple often found themselves at disagreements. In 1593 James was romantically linked with Anne Murray, whom he addressed as “my mistress and my love”, until her marriage to Patrick Lyon in 1595.\n\nIn “Basilikon Doron” (“Royal Gift”), James described marriage as “the greatest earthly felicitie or miserie, that can come to a man”. This was a book he had written for his four-year-old son, Prince Henry.\n\nNot only did Anne face her husbands’ infidelity, but she also learned soon after Henry Fredrick’s birth that she would have no say in his care. James appointed as head of the nursery his former nurse, Helen Little, who installed Henry in James’ own oak cradle. In keeping with Scottish royal tradition, James insisted on placing Prince Henry in the custody of John Erskine, Earl of Mar at Stirling Castle, much to the distress of Anne.\n\nIn late 1594 Anne began a campaign for custody of Henry, recruiting a faction of supporters to her cause including John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane. Worried of the lengths to which Anne might go to, James formally charged John Erskine, Earl of Mar in writing to never surrender Henry to anyone except on orders from James himself, “because in the surety of my son consists my surety”, also never to hand over Henry to his mother even if James died. Anne demanded for this to be referred to the Council which James refused to hear about.\n\nAfter James publicly reduced Anne to rage and tears over the matter, Anne was so distraught that in July 1595, she suffered a miscarriage. Even though Anne outwardly abandoned her campaign, the events would thereafter have a permanent damage on their marriage.\n\nIn August 1595 John Colville wrote, “There is nothing but lurking hatred disguised with cunning dissimulation betwixt the King and the Queen, each intending by slight to overcome the other”.\n\nThey might not have loved each other anymore, but they did have six more children together.\n\nAfter the “Gowrie Conspiracy” on 5 August 1600, in which the young John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie and his brother, Alexander Ruthven, were killed by James’ attendants for a supposed assault on James, triggered the dismissal of their sisters, Beatrix Ruthven and Barbara Ruthven, as ladies-in-waiting to Anne, with whom they were “in chiefest credit”. Anne, who was five months pregnant at the time, refused to get out of bed and eat unless the Ruthven sisters were reinstated. When James tried to command her, she warned him to take care how he treated her because she was not John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie.\n\nTo placate Anne, James hired a famous acrobat to entertain her, but she never gave up. Her stubborn, yet courageous, support for the Ruthven sisters over the next three years was finally taken seriously enough by the government to be regarded as a security issue.\n\nIn 1602, after the discovery that Anne smuggled Beatrix Ruthven into Holyrood, James carried out a cross-examination of the entire household. In 1603 he finally decided to grant Beatrix Ruthven a pension of £200.\n\nWhen James left for London with John Erskine, Earl of Mar, to assume the English throne following the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, Anne saw a belated opportunity to gain custody of Henry Frederick in 1603. Pregnant at this time, Anne descended on Stirling with a force of “well-supported” nobles, intent on removing the now nine-year-old Henry Frederick, who she hasn’t seen for five years. Unfortunately, John Erskine, Earl of Mar’s mother and brother would allow only Anne and no more than two attendants to enter the castle. Again, this sent Anne into such a fury that she suffered yet another miscarriage. According to David Calderwood, a Scottish divine and historian, Anne “went to bed in anger and parted with child the tenth of Mary”.\n\nWhen John Erskine, Earl of Mar returned to Stirling Castle his instructions from James was that Anne should join him in the Kingdom of England. She informed James by letter that she refused to do so unless allowed custody of Henry Frederick. Maybe seeing how determined she was to have custody of her son at all costs, James finally obliged, though he reproved Anne for “forward womanly apprehensions” and described her behaviour in a letter to John Erskine, Earl of Mar as “wilfulness”.\n\nAfter a brief recovery from her second miscarriage, Anne duly travelled south with Henry Frederick, which their progress causing a sensation in England.\n\nLady Anne Clifford, 14th Baroness de Clifford recorded that she and her mother, Lady Margaret Clifford, Countess of Cumberland had killed three horses in their haste to see Queen Anne, and that when James met Anne near Windsor, “there was such an infinite number of lords and ladies and so great a Court as I think I shall never see the like again”.\n\nIn Scotland, Anne sometimes exploited court factionalism for her own ends, most prominently by supporting the enemies of John Erskine, Earl of Mar. As a result of this, James did not trust her with secrets of state. Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, active in the highly secret diplomacy concerning the English succession, subtly reminded James that though Anne possessed every virtue (a compliment), Eve was corrupted by the serpent (an insult). In reality, Anne had little interest in high politics unless they touched on the fate of her children or friends.\n\nIn England, Anne turned from political to social and artistic activities. Though she participated fully in the life of James’ court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private quarrels with James, in public she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England. Conducting herself with discretion and graciousness. Anne played a crucial role in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors the prestige of not only the Stuart dynasty, but its Danish connections.\n\nThe Venetian envoy, Nicolo Molin, wrote this description of Anne in 1606;\n\n“She is intelligent and prudent; and knows the disorders of the government, in which she has no part, though many hold that as the King is most devoted to her, she might play as large a role as she wished. But she is young and averse to trouble; she sees that those who govern desire to be left alone, and so she professes indifference. All she ever does is to beg a favour for someone. She is full of kindness for those who support her, but on the other hand she is terrible, proud, unendurable to those she dislikes”.\n\nWhile Anne adopted a cosmopolitan lifestyle in London, James preferred to escape the capital, most often at his hunting lodge in Royston, Hertfordshire. Anne chaplain, Godfrey Goodman, later summed up James and Anne’s relationship, “The King himself was a very chaste man, and there was little in the Queen to make him uxorious; yet they did love as well as man and wife could do, not conversing together”.\n\nAnne moved into Greenwich Palace and then Somerset House, which she renamed “Denmark House”. After 1607, James and Anne rarely lived together, by which time she had borne seven children and suffered at least three miscarriages. After narrowly surviving the birth and death of her last baby, Sophia Stuart in 1607, Anne’s decision to have no more children may have widened the gap between her and James.\n\nThe children of James and Anne:\n\nHenry Frederick, Prince of Wales\n\n19 February 1594 – 6 November 1612\n\nElizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia\n\n19 August 1596 – 13 February 1662\n\nMargaret Stuart\n\n24 December 1598 – March 1600\n\nCharles I of England\n\n19 November 1600 – 30 January 1649\n\nRobert Stuart\n\n18 January 1602 – 27 May 1602\n\nMary Stuart\n\n8 April 1605 – 16 September 1607\n\nSophia Stuart\n\n22 June 1606 – 23 June 1606\n\nThe death of Henry Frederick on 6 November 1612 at the age of eighteen-years-old, probably from typhoid, and the departure of sixteen-year-old Elizabeth Stuart in April 1613, after marrying Elector Frederick V of the Palatine, further weakened the ties between Anne and James.\n\nHenry Frederick’s death hit Anne particularly hard. The Venetian envoy, Nicolo Molin, was advised not to offer condolences to Anne “because she cannot bear to have it mentioned; nor does she ever recall it without abundant tears and sighs”.\n\nFrom this moment on, Anne’s health started to deteriorate, withdrawing from the centre of cultural and political activities. She staged her last known masque in 1614 and no longer maintaining a noble court. This downfall in health and lack of participation in court led to her influence over James visibly wane and James’ dependency on powerful favourites.\n\nAlthough James had always had male favourites among his courtiers, he now encouraged them to play a role in the government. Anne reacted very differently to the two powerful favourites who dominated the second half of James’s English reign, Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset and George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham.\n\nAnne detested Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset, but she encouraged the rise of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, whom James knighted in her bedchamber. Anne developed friendly relations with George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, even calling him her “dog”. Even so, after George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham rise, he increasingly ignored her, which she became a lonely figure towards the end of her life.\n\nBy late 1617 Anne’s illness had become debilitating. John Chamberlain, a letter writer, recorded, “The Queen continues still ill disposed and though she fain lay all her infirmities upon the gout yet most of her physicians fear a further inconvenience of an ill habit or disposition through her whole body”.\n\nIn January 1619 royal physician, Sir Theodore de Mayerne, instructed Anne to saw wood to improve her blood flow, but the exertion served to make her worse. During her illness, James visited her only three times, though Prince Charles often slept in the adjoining bedroom at Hampton Court Palace and was beside her during her last hours when she had lost her sight. With her also was her personal maid, Anna Roos, who had arrived with her from Denmark in 1590.\n\nOn 2 March 1619 at the age of forty-four, Queen Anne died of a dangerous form of dropsy. Dropsy is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the interstitium, located beneath the skin and in the cavities of the body, which can cause severe pain.\n\nDespite his years of neglect towards Anne, James was emotionally affected by her death. He did not visit her during her dying days, nor did he attend her funeral, being sick himself, but James, according to Sir Theodore de Mayerne, was “fainting, sighing, dread, incredible sadness…”.\n\nAfter a prolonged delay, on 13 May 1619, Anne was buried in the King Henry’s Chapel, Westminster Abbey. The catafalque, designed by Maximilian Colt, placed over her grave was destroyed during the civil war.\n\nAs he had done before he ever met her, James turned to verse to pay his respects;"
