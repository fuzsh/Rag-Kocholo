        "text": "Who is Prince Frederik of Denmark?\n\nPrince Frederik is the future king of Denmark. The oldest son of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, he was born on May 26, 1968, and has the title of Crown Prince, meaning he will become king when his mother dies. He is married to Princess Mary. They live together at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen.\n\nDoes Prince Frederik get on his with his younger brother?\n\nFrederick’s younger brother, Prince Joachim is just a year younger than the Crown Prince.\n\nIt’s been widely reported there is tension between the brothers; Joachim has reportedly always felt Frederik was favoured by their parents, and that Frederik hasn’t taken his royal duties seriously. Rumours of the feud increased in early 2019 when Joachim and his family moved away from Copenhagen to Paris.\n\nHow did Prince Frederik meet Princess Mary?\n\nThe couple met during the 2000 Olympics at Sydney pub, The Slip Inn. Prince Frederik was there with his brother, Prince Joachim, cousin Prince Nikolaos of Greece, Princess Martha Louise of Norway, and the King of Spain’s nephew, who knew Mary’s sister’s flatmate.\n\n“I had only been in Australia two days, before our fates were sealed, even though neither of us were aware of it,” he told Mary in a speech on their wedding day. “But your radiance shone clearly for me from our very first meeting. Since then I have been blinded and totally dependent on it.”\n\nWhen was Prince Frederik and Princess Mary’s wedding?\n\nThe pair got married on May 14, 2004 at Copenhagen Cathedral, after Frederik had proposed in Rome in October 2003. Frederik wore his military uniform and was seen wiping away tears as Mary walked up the aisle with her father John Donaldson.\n\nAfter the ceremony they were taken by horse-drawn carriage to Christian VII’s Palace where they appeared on the balcony and kissed in front of cheering crowds. At their wedding reception, Prince Frederik promised to make Princess Mary feel at home in her newly adopted country.\n\n“The joy and the strength you give me is like the sun in the daytime which, with its radiance, melts all doubts and darkness on earth,\" he said. \"And like the moon at night, you shine with a watchful and delicate beam of gentleness.\"\n\nHow much is Prince Frederik worth?\n\nThe Danish royal family as a whole are worth around AUD $57.8million, according to Business Insider. The Danish Civil List gives the family around AUD $18.5 million a year to cover the Queen’s activities, personal expenses and the running of their households.\n\nWho are Prince Frederick’s ex-girlfriends?\n\nBefore he met Mary, Prince Frederik was known for his playboy lifestyle and love of beautiful women. His first girlfriend was Mie Egmont, who he went to school with, and the pair were known as childhood sweethearts.\n\nIn 1990 he met Nina Klinker Jorgensen at Aarhus University; he was studying political science and she was studying law. The pair dated briefly before Nina decided to become a film-maker, and broke the relationship off.\n\nFrederik then started seeing model Malou Aamund. On New Year’s Eve 1992, Malou was driving Frederik’s car, when they were pulled over by police. She was charged with drink driving, and the pair split in early 1993, after the Danish royal family issued an apology on Frederik’s behalf.\n\nIn his mid-twenties, Prince Frederik dated lingerie model Katja Storkholm. The pair were together for over two years, and it’s widely rumoured Frederick proposed to her and she accepted.\n\n“When he had to go and perform royal duties which he didn’t like, she would go over speeches with him and suggest changes and coach him. They were a real team,” wrote Trine Villemann in her book 1015 Copenhagen K.\n\nHowever, Frederick’s family didn’t approve of the relationship, and they split. Frederik then dated Danish singer Maria Montell for a year, before meeting Mary in Sydney a few months later.\n\nAre Prince Frederik and Princess Mary happily married?\n\nThe couple have been married for nearly 16 years, but in recent months there have been rumours the couple have been spending less and less time together.\n\nWhen Princess Victoria of Sweden visited Denmark in October 2019, there were reports Mary was unhappy with her husband’s flirtatious attitude.\n\nDoes Prince Frederik have a tattoo?\n\nYes, he has two tattoos. The first is a shark on his calf, which is the insignia of the Danish Navy’s elite frogman corps.\n\nThe second is on his right arm and translates as “pingu” – a reference to the nickname he was given while completing his training to become a Frogman. The training takes place over nine months and includes a difficult survival course, combat swimming and scuba diving. Around 500 people start the course, with usually only around 12 people completing it.\n\nHow many languages does Prince Frederik speak?\n\nThe Crown Prince is fluent in four languages; his mother tongue, Danish, as well as English, French and German.\n\nHe’s reportedly keen for his four children to become multi-lingual as well, and from January 2020 they will go to the Swiss boarding school, Lemania International School Altdorf, where they will be exposed to multiple languages.\n\nHow many children does Prince Frederik have?\n\nPrince Frederik has four children with his wife Princess Mary. Their first son Prince Christian Valdemar Henri John was born on October 15, 2005.\n\nTwo years later they had their daughter Princess Isabella Henrietta Ingrid Margrethe, who was born on April 21, 2007.\n\nThey became parents to twins Prince Vincent Frederik Minik Alexander and Princess Josephine Sophia Ivalo Mathilda on January 8, 2011.\n\nGot a story tip or just want to get in touch?
