Information concerning the early Slav leaders is found in Helmold's Chronica Slavorum and in various Frankish annals, although all these sources provide an incomplete picture of their activities and family relationships. The most complete list of Slav tribes in the area is found in Helmold who names \"Heruli vel Heveldi qui sunt iuxta Habolam fluvium, et Dozani, Leubuzi et Willisi, Stoderasi\" as the Slavs who lived \"inter Oderam et Albium\" (the Oder and Elbe rivers), adding that \"post Odere in Winulorum provincia\" lived \"Kycini et Circipani Tholenzi et Redari\" who were called \"Wilzi sive Lutici\", that beyond that lived \"Linguones et Warnavi\" and \"Obotriti\", and that \"Wagirensem provinciam\" lay across \"fluvius Traveus\" and in which \"Vemere Wagiris Rani qui et Ruisni\" lived . The context suggests that this was an exclusive list of all tribes in the Baltic coastal region before Charles I King of the Franks (later Emperor Charlemagne) conquered Saxony, although subsequent passages in Helmold fail to record the later history of all these named tribes some of which are never mentioned again. Einhard's Annales record a council at Frankfurt in 822 attended by legates from \"orientalium Sclavorum, id est Abodritorum, Soraborum, Wiltzorum, Beheimorum, Marvanorum, Prædenecentorum et in Pannonia residentium Avarum\" , of which only the \"Abodritorum Wiltzorum\" lived in the coastal Baltic area, the former presumably being identified with the \"Obotriti\" and the latter with the \"Wilzi sive Lutici\", although it is not clear which of the long list of tribes in Helmold's earlier listing would have been subsumed into these two groups.\n\nIn a later passage, Helmold describes Frankish pressure on the western Slavic territories during the course of the Carolingian conquest of Saxony. He names \"Winuli sive Winithi\" as the Slav peoples who lived in \"Hammemburgensem parrochiam\", describing how the boundaries of the latter were pushed eastwards across the Elbe into \"Nordalbingia\" where the \"Thethmarcos, Holsatos, Sturmarios\" peoples lived, and further eastwards as far as \"flumen Penim\" in the lands of the \"Wagiri, Obotriti, Kycini, Circipani\" . After the Frankish conquest of Saxony was completed in the late 9th century, according to Reuter the area east of the river Elbe was forcibly evacuated and abandoned to the Obotrites , although this appears to simplify events when compared with the complex descriptions in Helmold. At the same time as the Franks expanded their control of Saxony to the east, the incursions of the Danes from the north resulted in further pressure on Slav territories along the southern shore of the Baltic. Helmold says that in the mid-10th century these two incursionary waves spread as far as the town of \"Aldenburg que Sclavica lingua Starigard in terra Wagirorum\" in which a church dedicated to St John the Baptist was founded, in his description speaking only of the \"Obotritorum sive Kicinorum\" as the dominant Slav tribe in the area . Relations between the Saxons and the Slav tribes remained tense throughout the 10th to 12th centuries, not only because of the competition for territory but also because all efforts to convert the pagan Slavs to Christianity failed before the mid-12th century.\n\nThe various Frankish annals suggest that the Obotrites were the dominant Slav tribe during the 9th and 10th centuries (see Chapter 1). However, no record has been found of the name of any Obotrite leader between the late 10th and mid-12th centuries, suggesting that they were eclipsed by other forces. A limited amount of information has been found relating to the Dukes of the Sorbs (Chapter 2) and the Kings of the Wiltzi (Chapter 3). Primary sources show the Wends as the dominant Slav force in the Baltic coastal area in the 11th century, and that most other tribes paid tribute to Heinrich Wendish Prince of Wagria in the early 12th century (see Chapter 4). Helmold records that \"Wagiri, Polabi, Obotriti, Kicini, Cyrcipani, Lutici, Pomerani\" were the Slav tribes \"inter Albiam et mare Balticum\" led by Prince Heinrich . However, Heinrich's successors were eliminated by Knud \"Lavard\" of Denmark, who was installed by Emperor Lothar as ruler in Wagria in [1128/29]. After Knud was murdered in 1131, two new local Slav leaders emerged in the area. Pribislaw, a relative of Heinrich of Wagria, took control of Wagria, while Niklot obtained control of the Obotrite territories. Pribislaw died without heirs, after nominating Albrecht \"der Bär\" as his successor, and his lands comprised the nucleus around which the powerful state of Brandenburg later developed. The descendants of the Obotrite leader Niklot consolidated their position in Mecklenburg, where they ruled as dukes until the end of the First World War (see Chapters 5 and 7 to 9). Helmold records that \"Niclotus\" held \"castra Ylowe, Mikilinburg, Zverin et Dobin Wurle\", which were overrun by Heinrich Duke of Saxony . Duke Heinrich later transferred the county of Schwerin to Günzel von Hagen as a hereditary fief (see Chapter 6).\n\nThe duchy of Saxonys dominance of Mecklenburg was challenged by Denmark and Brandenburg in the 13th and 14th centuries, as reflected in the confirmation charters granted by all three powers in the area. In particular, the Danish kings title (rex Daciæ et Slavorum) demonstrated the kingdoms ambitions in north-eastern Germany, although its practical impact on the ground was probably limited. The need to balance the influence of all these competing forces is reflected in the marital alliances contracted by the Herren von Mecklenburg, while the situation was to a certain extent resolved when in 1348 Mecklenburgs status as an imperial fief was confirmed with the ducal title accorded to its rulers. Thereafter the Mecklenburg dukes expanded their local influence, with for example Albrecht III Herzog von Mecklenburg succeeding as Swedish king in 1364.\n\nChapter 1. PRINCES of the OBOTRITES 8th-10th CENTURIES\n\nThe family relationships, if any, between the early Princes of the Obotrites are not known, except as indicated below. It is possible that the leaders were chosen from rival clans and were not related to each other.\n\n1. WITZAN (-795). The Annales Laurissenses Continuatio names \"Witzan\" as \"Abotriti princeps\" in 789 . The Gesta Francorum records that \"Witzan dux Abodritorum\" was killed in 795 by the Saxons . The Annales Laurissenses Continuatio records that \"Witzin Abodritorum rex\" was killed by the Saxons in 795 .\n\n1. THRASCO (-killed in battle Reria 809). The Annales Laurissenses Continuatio records that the \"Nordliudi\", together with the missi of Charles I King of the Franks, defeated \"Thrasuconem ducem Abotritorum et Eburisum\" in 798 . Einhard records a dispute between \"Drasconem ducem Abodritorum\" and \"Godelaibum alium ducem et cum eis filium fratris sui Reginoldum\", the latter being killed in 808 . Einhard records that \"Thrasco dux Abodritorum\" was killed by \"hominibus Godofridi\" in \"emporie Rerie\" in 809 . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Thrasco dux Abotritorum\" was killed in 809 \"in emporio Reric ab hominibus Godafridi\" after laying waste to land with the help of \"Saxonum Wilzos et Smeldingos\" . m ---. The name of Thrasco's wife is not known. Thrasco & his wife had one child:\n\na) CEADROGO (-in Saxony 821). Einhard's Annales record that \"Sclaomir Abodritorum rex\" was sent into exile in 819 and the kingdom given to \"Ceadrogo Thrasconis filius\" . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Ceadrogo filio Thrasconis\" made peace with the Danes in 817 with \"Sclaomir dux Abodritorum\", his succession in 819 after Sclaomir was sent into exile, and his own deposition after he allied himself with the Danes in 821, after which Sclaomir was recalled to rule . Einhard's Annales name \"Ceadrigo filio Thrasconis\" in 817 . Einhard's Annales record the death in 821 of \"Ceadragus Abodritorum princeps\" when he was in Saxony .\n\n1. SCLAOMIR (-after 819). Einhard's Annales record that \"Sclaomir Abodritorum rex\" was sent into exile in 819 and the kingdom given to \"Ceadrogo Thrasconis filius\" . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Sclaomir dux Abodritorum\" seized power after the death of \"Thrasconis\" in 817, made peace with the Danes in 817 being \"iratus cum populo suo sibi\", was sent into exile in 819, but that he resumed power in 819 after Ceadrogo was removed because of his alliance with the Danes .\n\n1. GOTZOMIUSLI (-killed in battle 844). The Annales Fuldenses record that \"rege eorum [=Abodritos] Gotzomiuzli\" was killed when \"Hludowicus\" made war on the Abotrites and ordered the subjugation of their territory \"per duces\" in 844 .\n\n1. TABOMIUZ . The Gesta Francorum names \"ducem eorum [=Abodritos] Tabomiuzlem\" when recording his rebellion in 862 when he and his sons were besieged . The Annales Fuldenses record the same event .\n\n1. BILLUG (-after 963). Helmold names \"Billug\" as \"regulus Obotritorum\" in the mid-10th century . m (repudiated) ---, sister of WAGO Bishop of Stargard, daughter of ---. Helmold names \"Billug\" as \"regulus Obotritorum\" in the mid-10th century, recording that he married the sister of Wago Bishop of Stargard but later repudiated her which triggered war . Billug & [his wife] had two children:\n\na) MISSIZLA . Helmold names \"Missizla\" as son of \"regulus Obotritorum Billug\" when recording that he and his father captured episcopal properties during the war with the bishop of Stargard . Helmold names \"Missiszla, Naccon et Sederich\" as \"principes Sclavorum qui Winuli sive Winithi dicuntur\" during the reign of Bolesław I of Poland (who succeeded as Prince in 992), specifying that \"Missizlaus, Obotritorum princeps\" was brother of \"Hodicam\" .\n\nb) HODICA . Helmold names \"Hodicam\" as the daughter of \"regulus Obotritorum Billug\" and his wife, recording that her maternal uncle installed her as abbess of Mecklenburg . Helmold records that \"Missizlaus, Obotritorum princeps sororem suam Hodicam\" was removed from her monastery to marry Bolesław of Poland, while many other nuns were sent \"in terram Wilzorum sive Ranorum\" and the monastery dissolved . This is the only source so far identified which refers to this marriage of Prince Bolesław. m ([987/92]) as his [fourth] wife, BOŁESLAW I \"Chrobry\" Prince of Poland, son of MIESZKO I Prince of Poland & his [eighth] wife Dobrava [Dobroslawa] of Bohemia ([967]-17 Jun 1025). He declared himself King of Poland in 1024.]\n\nChapter 2. DUKES of the SORBS\n\n1. MILIDUOCH (-killed in battle 806). Einhard records that \"Karolum filium suum [Karoli imperatoris]\" invaded \"terram Sclavorum Sorabi\" in 806 as far as \"super Albium fluvium\" and that \"Miliduoch Sclavorum dux\" was killed during the campaign . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Karolus iunior\" was sent by his father as missus \"in Sorabos super Albim fluvium\" in 806 and killed \"ducem eorum Miliduoch\" .\n\n2. ZISTIBORO (-after 858).

The Annales Fuldenses record that \"castellum Hohbuochi Albiæ fluminum adpositum\", where \"Odo legatus imperator et orientalium Saxonum erat præsidium\", was captured in 810 by \"Wilzis\" .\n\n1. LIUBUS (-before May 823). Einhard's Annales record a council at Frankfurt in May 823 which discussed the succession dispute between \"duo fratres, reges Wiltzorum Milegastus [qui maior natu erat] et Cealadragus filii Liubi regis Wiltzorum\" . m ---. The name of Liubus's wife is not known. Liubus & his wife had two children:\n\na) MILEGASTUS . Einhard's Annales record a council at Frankfurt in May 823 which discussed the succession dispute between \"duo fratres, reges Wiltzorum Milegastus [qui maior natu erat] et Cealadragus filii Liubi regis Wiltzorum\" .\n\nb) CEALADRAGUS . Einhard's Annales record a council at Frankfurt in May 823 which discussed the succession dispute between \"duo fratres, reges Wiltzorum Milegastus [qui maior natu erat] et Cealadragus filii Liubi regis Wiltzorum\" .\n\nChapter 4. PRINCES of the WENDS, PRINCES in WAGRIA\n\nAs noted in the Introduction, primary sources show the Wends as the dominant Slav force in the Baltic coastal area in the 11th century, and that most other tribes paid tribute to Heinrich Wendish Prince of Wagria in the early 12th century. Helmold records that \"Wagiri, Polabi, Obotriti, Kicini, Cyrcipani, Lutici, Pomerani\" were the Slav tribes \"inter Albiam et mare Balticum\" led by Prince Heinrich . However, Heinrich's successors were eliminated by Knud \"Lavard\" of Denmark, who was installed by Emperor Lothar as ruler in Wagria in [1128/29]. After Knud was murdered in 1131, two new local Slav leaders emerged in the area. Pribislaw, a relative of Heinrich of Wagria, took control of Wagria, while Niklot obtained control of the Obotrite territories. Pribislaw died without heirs, after nominating Albrecht \"der Bär\" as his successor, and his lands comprised the nucleus around which the powerful state of Brandenburg later developed.\n\nThe difficulty of identifying the territorial area over which the early Wendish princes ruled is complicated by the term being used generally to indicate the whole Baltic coastal area west of Pomerania.\n\nThe reconstruction of the following family of Burislaw/Burizleif of the Wends is based exclusively on Snorre´s Heimkringsla series of Sagas . Snorre names \"Geira, Gunhild and Astrid\" as the three daughters of \"in Vindland a king called Burizleif\" , and in a later passage records that Sigvalde...earl over Jomsborg in Vindland captured Svend King of Denmark (soon after he deposed his father) and took him to Vindland, to Jomsborg where he forced him to make peace with Burizleif, the king of the Vinds, the arrangement including Svends marriage to Gunhild, King Burizleifs daughter and the marriage of King Burizleif to Thyre, a daughter of Harald, and King Sveins sister . Svends capture (but not his marriage) is confirmed by Thietmar (writing [1012/18]) who records that \"Sueino Haraldi filio\" was \"post mortem patris sui\" (therefore dated to [987]) captured a Northmannis insurgentibus . However, further details are provided by Adam of Bremen (writing [1075/85]) who records that \"rex Sueonum Hericus\" invaded Denmark and expelled Suein, derelictus a Deo, frustra sperans in ydolis suis , and in another passage that \"Hericus rex Sueonum\" made a treaty with rege Polanorum Bolizlao and that Bolizlaus gave filiam vel sororem to Herico . Adam therefore contradicts Snorre regarding the involvement of Sigvalde and about who married whom at the time. The dating of Snorres sagas to [1230] suggests that the earlier sources should be preferred, although there are indications that the Icelandic/Norse sagas were based on earlier documentation which no longer survives (discussed in the Introduction to the document NORWAY KINGS). Hlawitschka, as part of his discussion about the wives of Erik King of Sweden and Svend King of Denmark, suggests that Burislaw/Burizleif was the same person as Bolesław I \"Chrobry/the Brave\" Prince of Poland . He cites Ludat who notes that Mieszko, Bolesławs father, controlled Pomerania at the time , which recalls the difficulty of locating Wendland at the time as noted above. Thietmars and Adams reports cited above suggest that Hlawitschka is correct. The Swedish/Polish treaty was probably dated to [985], consistent with the likely birth date of Eriks son Oluf (see the document SWEDEN KINGS). At that time, although Bolesławs father Mieszko still ruled Poland, he was old and his son was probably already active on his own account. Hlawitsckas hypothesis is also consistent with King Eriks receiving Polish support when he expelled King Svend from Denmark in [987], while Bolesławs later marriage to Tyre Haraldsdatter of Denmark (see below) also reflects an ongoing Swedish/Polish alliance.\n\n1. [BURISLAW, son of --- . [972: the primary source associated with this date has not been identified]. Prince of the Wends. Snorre names \"in Vindland a king called Burizleif\" as father of the three daughters named below . No other primary source has been identified which names him in his own capacity. [m ---. This marriage is shown only for consistency with Snorres record of Burislaw/Burizleif of the Wends and his three supposed daughters shown below, information which as indicated above is unlikely to be correct.]\n\n[The following marriage is also likely to be incorrect, as explained below: m ([987], divorced) as her second husband, TYRE Haraldsdatter of Denmark, widow of STYRBJÖRN [Björn] den Starke/the Strong\" of Sweden, daughter of HARALD I \"Blåtand/Bluetooth\" King of Denmark & his [first wife Gunhild ---] (-18 Sep [1000]). The primary source which confirms her first marriage has not been identified. The Historia Norwegie, when recording her third marriage, says that \"sororem Sweinonis regis Tyri\" had earlier been betrothed to \"dux quidam de Sclauia\" . Saxo Grammaticus records that Erik King of Denmark deposed her first husband, dated to [984/85] . The following source suggests that Erik received Polish help at the time: one manuscript of Adam of Bremen records that \"Hericus rex Sueonum\" made a treaty with rege Polanorum Bolizlao and that Bolizlaus gave filiam vel sororem to Herico . It is therefore not a great leap to assume that, at the same time, the marriage was arranged between Bolesław of Poland and the widow of Eriks predecessor. A variation on this theme is provided by Snorre, who records Sigvalde...earl over Jomsborg in Vindland capturing Svend King of Denmark (soon after he deposed his father) and taking him to Vindland, to Jomsborg, where he forced him to make peace with Burizleif, the king of the Vinds, the arrangement including Svends marriage to Gunhild, King Burizleifs daughter and the marriage of King Burizleif to Thyre, a daughter of Harald, and King Sveins sister . This passage is shown to be inaccurate regarding King Svend (see below under his first marriage), but the report about Tyres marriage is believable. Consistent with Hlawitschkas hypothesis (discussed above) that Burislaw/Burizleif of the Wends was Bolesław I \"Chrobry/the Brave\" Prince of Poland, Tyres second husband was Boleslaw of Poland. She married thirdly (Tønsberg 998) as his fourth wife, Olav I Trygveson King of Norway: in a later passage, Snorre records Tyre's flight to Norway from her second husband and her subsequent marriage to King Olav . The Historia Norwegie records the marriage of King Olav and \"sororem Sweinonis regis Tyri\" . Adam of Bremen records the marriage of \"Olaph Trucconis filius\" and \"a Dania superbissimam Thore\" soon after he returned to Norway after exile in England . Adam of Bremen records that, after the death of her husband, his wife starved herself to death .]\n\n[Burislaw & his wife had [three] children (consistent with Hlawitschkas hypothesis discussed above, the two older children are also shown in the document POLAND as possible children of Mieszko I Prince of Poland by his [first/seventh] [wife/wives]. It appears that the daughter Gunhild has been confused with Mieskos daughter Sigrid, who married firstly Erik King of Sweden and secondly Svend King of Denmark):\n\na) [GYDA [Geira] (-984) . Snorre names \"Geira, Gunhild and Astrid\" as the three daughters of \"in Vindland a king called Burizleif\", recording that Geira was queen in the part of the country in which Olav landed when returning from Garderike. He records that that they married in 982 and that Olav stayed in Vindland to rule jointly with his wife . Snorre records that Geira died after Olav Trygveson had been in Vindland for three years . m ([982]) as his first wife, OLAV Trygveson, son of TRYGVE Olavsson [Norway] & his wife Åstrid Eiriksdatter (posthumously [968] -drowned Øresund o. b. Svold, near Rügen 9 Sep [1000]). He imposed himself as OLAV I King of Norway in [995].]\n\nb) [ASTRID . Snorre names \"Geira, Gunhild and Astrid\" as the three daughters of \"in Vindland a king called Burizleif\" . Snorre names \"Astrid, a daughter of King Burizleif\" as the wife of Sigvalde . m SIGVALDI, son of STRUTHARALD King in Skåne & his wife ---. Jarl at Jomsborg: Saxo Grammaticus names Bo, Ulff, Karlshefni, Siualdus among the knights at Jomsborg .]\n\nc) [GUNHILD (-before 995?) . Snorre names \"Geira, Gunhild and Astrid\" as the three daughters of \"in Vindland a king called Burizleif\" . In a later passage, he records Gunhild's marriage to Svend King of Denmark arranged as part of the peace deal brokered with the Wends by Sigvaldi (Jarl at Jomsborg) who was already married to another daughter of Burizlaw . This marriage is unlikely to be correct as explained in the document DENMARK KINGS m (before 987?) as his first wife, SVEND I \"Tveskæg/Forkbeard\"King of Denmark, son of HARALD I \"Blåtand/Bluetooth\" King of Denmark & his first wife Gunhild ([960]-Gainsborough 3 Feb 1014, bur in England, later removed to Roskilde).]\n\n1. MSTIVOJ . Adam of Bremen names \"principes Winulorum Mystiwoi et Mizzidrog\" as leaders of a Slav rebellion in \"Nortalbingia\" , in a paragraph dealing with events in 1000. Helmold records that \"Mistiwoj\" requested the hand in marriage of \"neptem ducis Bernardi\" . m ---. The name of Mstivoj's wife is not known, nor is it known whether she was the same person as \"neptem ducis Bernardi\" whom Helmold records as noted above. Mstivoj & his wife had [two] children:\n\na) UTO . Adam of Bremen names \"principes [Winulos] Gneus et Anatrog pagani [et] Uto filius Mistiwoi cristianus\", recording that Uto was killed in Saxony . same person as ? PRIBIGNIEV . As shown below, the sources are contradictory regarding the name of the father of Gottschalk. One solution would be that \"Uto\" and \"Pribigniev\" were in fact two names given to the same person.\n\n- see below.\n\nb) [TOVE (-[990]) . Her marriage and parentage are confirmed by a Runic stone at Sönder Vissing, Denmark which records that \"Tufa let gera [make] kuml [monument], Mistiuis do´tter,ept [daughter] Mo´thur [mother] sina.Kona [queen] Haralds hins Goda,Gorms sonar\" . Europäische Stammtafeln identifies Tove´s father as Mstivoj the Wendish prince . The name of Tove´s father, \"Mistiuis\", on the Runic stone bears some similarity to Mstivoj. However, one difficulty is the apparent chronological discrepancy. The only other reference to Mstivoj is dated to 1000 and gives no idea about his age at the time. Nor is there any indication of the date of Tove´s marriage, although it appears unlikely that she married much later than 980 considering the date her husband died. This would place her birth in [960] which, in turn, would mean that Mstivoj would have been over 60 years old when he is mentioned in 1000. This is not impossible, but it seems a little surprising. Another possibility is that she was Tove of Poland, daughter of Mieszko I Prince of Poland. The name \"Mieszko\" is just as similar to \"Mistiuis\" as \"Mstivoj\". This would place her birth after 966, later than suggested above, assuming that she was Mieszko´s daughter by his wife Dobrava of Bohemia. If this hypothesis is correct, Tove could have been the sister of the first wife of King Harald´s son, King Svend, implying a father/son double marriage with two sisters. m as his second wife, HARALD I \"Blåtand/Bluetooth\" King of Denmark, son of GORM \"den Gamle/the Old\" King of Denmark & his wife Tyre \"Danebod\" (before 935-Jomsborg 1 Dec [986/87], bur Roskilde Cathedral).]\n\n2. MIZZIDROG . Adam of Bremen names \"principes Winulorum Mystiwoi et Mizzidrog\" as leaders of a Slav rebellion in \"Nortalbingia\" , in a paragraph dealing with events in 1000.\n\n1. ANATROG . Adam of Bremen names \"principes Sclavorum Anatrog et Gneus et Ratibor\", recording that they came to Hamburg to sign a peace agreement , the passage being undated but the next but one paragraph recording events in 1039.\n\n2. GNEUS . Adam of Bremen names \"principes Sclavorum Anatrog et Gneus et Ratibor\", recording that they came to Hamburg to sign a peace agreement , the passage being undated but the next but one paragraph recording events in 1039.\n\n3. RATIBOR (-killed [1042]). Adam of Bremen names \"principes Sclavorum Anatrog et Gneus et Ratibor\", recording that they came to Hamburg to sign a peace agreement , the passage being undated but the next but one paragraph recording events in 1039. Adam of Bremen records that \"Ratibor dux Sclavorum\" was killed by \"Danis Sclavis terribilis\", specifying that Ratibor was a Christian and that he had eight sons who were all killed by Danis .\n\nPRIBIGNEV, son of [UTO] --- . Saxo Grammmaticus records that he was killed by the Saxons .\n\nm ---. The name of Pribignev's wife is not known.\n\nPribignev & his wife had [one child]:\n\n1. [GOTTSCHALK (-murdered 7 Jun 1066) . Son of Pribignev according to Saxo Grammaticus . On the other hand, Adam of Bremen names \"filium [Uto] Gotescalcum\", recording that he was studying in Lüneburg when his father was killed . Adam of Bremen records the marriage of \"Godescalcus de quo supra dictum est\" and \"filia regis Danorum\" . Prince of the Wends and of the Obotrites. He cooperated with the missionary efforts of Adalbero Archbishop of Hamburg who established missionary bishoprics in Wagria, Ratzeburg and Mecklenburg . Adam of Bremen records that \"Gotescalcus\" was killed by Bernhard . He was supplanted by Cruto , after the Wendish uprising in 1066 when the missionary bishoprics were destroyed .] [m firstly ---. No direct reference has been found to this first marriage of Gottschalk.

Niklot fortified the fortress of Dobin on Lake Schwerin and appealed to Adolf II Graf von Holstein, with whom he had a treaty of friendship, to mediate. Niklot advanced into Wagria, and in Jun 1147 raided Lübeck . The Saxon/Danish army besieged Dobin, but the siege was raised after the Obotrites undertook to embrace Christianity . Although some of his followers were nominally persuaded to be baptised, this proved to be a symbolic conversion and Niklot continued to rule as a heathen warlord.

Helmold records that Pribislaw held \"omnia castra Malachou, Cuscin, Zverin, Ilowe, Mikilinburg\" after peace was restored .

As can be seen from other charters in the compilation, the term socer was sometimes used in an extended sense in Mecklenburg charters of the period. It is not therefore certain that Richard was Pribislaws father-in-law. The prominent marriage of Pribislaws son, Pribislaw [II], suggests that he was his fathers older son. As the indications highlighted below suggest that Pribislaw [II] was born from his fathers Friesack wife, it is likely that this was Pribislaw [I]s first marriage. [m secondly ---. The same names of Pribislaws two sons suggest that they may have been born from different marriages of their father.

However, it is odd that he should hold property jointly with his maternal family which the charter dated 1 Apr 1269 suggests was granted to him at the time of his marriage.
