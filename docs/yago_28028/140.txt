Frederick IV (born Oct. 11, 1671, Copenhagen—died Oct. 12, 1730, Odense, Den.) was the king of Denmark and Norway (1699–1730), who succeeded his father, King Christian V. He continued the Danish efforts to sever the House of Gottorp’s link with Sweden, but his first attempt to do so, in 1700 at the outbreak of the Great Northern War, was checked by Charles XII of Sweden. Frederick then accepted the Treaty of Traventhal (1700), but he reentered the war in 1709, and at the Peace of Frederiksborg (1720) Denmark obtained English and French guarantees for the sole possession of the Duchy of Schleswig by the Danish crown, though remaining administratively separate. At home the King introduced reforms. A local militia was instituted in 1701. The legal bond tying peasants to the land on which they worked was partially abolished in eastern Denmark after 1702. On the crown estates Frederick reorganized defense measures and established 240 elementary schools. His private life, however, often aroused indignation. Having married Louise of Mecklenburg-Güstrow in 1695, he entered into two morganatic marriages during her lifetime. The second of these, in 1712, was with Anna Sophie, daughter of the chancellor, Conrad, Count Reventlow, and after Louise’s death (1721), despite opposition within the royal family, he raised Anna Sophie to the dignity of queen.
