        "text": "Bloody, violent execution tale in Nazi-occupied France as a group of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers wreak havoc and fear among the occupying forces mirrored by the presence of SS Colonel Hans ‘The Jew Hunter’ Landa.\n\nUnder the leadership of Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), the ‘Basterds’ kill, main, scalp. In Paris, cinema owner Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), having witnessed the cold-blooded murder of her family by Landa (Christoph Waltz), plots her revenge. A German film premiere is scheduled at her cinema with every major Nazi officer in attendance, including the Führer himself. The fateful evening approaches.\n\nExcess, Tarantino-style. An audacious, wry fantasy with cinema playing the decisive role in destroying the Third Reich. But there’s an element of insensitivity to the whole, ultimately hit and miss that whilst remaining engaging in its 155 minute running time, somehow fails to achieve the best in the writer/director.\n\nNominated for 8 Oscars in 2010 including best film, director, original screenplay – won 1 for best supporting actor (Christoph Waltz)\n\nRating: 64%\n\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown)\n\nWriter: Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown)\n\nMain cast: Brad Pitt (Thelma & Louise, Ad Astra), Mélanie Laurent (Now You See Me, Operation Finale), Christoph Waltz (Water For Elephants, The Legend of Tarzan)\n\nUncomfortable viewing it may be but Downfall and the last days in the collapse of the Third Reich and suicide of Adolf Hitler is mesmerising as it is provocative.\n\nFear among the Nazi loyalists within the Berlin bunker increases as the Russian army moves closer to the city. Yet their Führer (an extraordinary Bruno Ganz – Wings of Desire, The Reader) initially refuses to consider defeat. Ordering counterattacks by non-existent regiments, accusing generals of treason, it becomes increasingly obvious that all is lost. As any attempt of a sense of normality within the bunker wanes, the decision is made to either flee or die via cyanide.\n\nClaustrophobic, confronting, powerful, Oliver Hirschbiegel (13 Minutes, Five Minutes of Heaven) explores in microcosm the charm, manipulation and ultimate betrayal of Hitler. It’s a controversial approach but, in avoiding morbid fascination, Hirschbiegel portrays evil with a smiling face.\n\nNominated for best foreign language film Oscar in 2005.\n\nRating: 74%\n\nIt was necessary states the rapist to his victim, a wealthy divorced Parisian businesswoman, the stunning Isabelle Huppert. Having discovered his identity, a dangerous sexual cat-and-mouse ensues. With new sexual challenges, Huppert dumps her current lover – the husband of her best friend.\n\nElle is nasty, violent and vicious. Stylish it may be with its Parisian chic and director Paul Verhoeven has teased out a superb performance from his lead (tipped to be Huppert’s first Oscar nomination). The director’s intention may well have been for us to mirror Huppert’s cat, who watches her violent assault with indifference. But a ‘rape revenge black comedy’? Loathesome.\n\nNominated for 1 Oscar in 2017 (Isabelle Huppert).\n\nRating: 25%\n\nDirector: Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Robocop)\n\nWriter: David Birke (13 Sins, Horseplayer) – based on the novel by Philippe Dijan\n\nMain cast: Isabelle Huppert (The Piano Teacher, Amour), Laurent Lafitte (Tell No One, The Crimson Rivers), Anne Consigny (At Eternity’s Gate, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly)\n\nA bland recounting of a fascinating yet appalling true story of the Hollywood 10 – and scriptwriter Dalton Trumbo in particular. By failing to provide any real context to the move against scriptwriters immediately following World War II, Trumbo provides little insight into a shameful piece of American history.\n\nDirector Jay Roach provides too light a touch to what is essentially serious material. And an overly mannered performance by Bryan Cranston, surprisingly nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe, may capture the idiosyncricies of mannerisms and intonations of the real-life Trumbo, but the result is a lack of any real engagement.\n\nNominated for 1 Oscar in 2016\n\nRating: 48%\n\nDirector: Jay Roach (Meet the Fockers, Austin Powers: Goldmember)\n\nWriter: John McNamara (TV’s Fastlane, Spy Game) – based on the book by Bruce Cook\n\nMain cast: Bryan Cranston (Argo, Drive), Diane Lane (Unfaithful, Man of Steel), Helen Mirren (The Queen, Hitchcock), Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man, Blue Jasmine)\n\nWhat happened? A light-hearted, frivolous, tongue-in-cheek, sexy (in its day) spy caper television series from the 1960s turned into this mess?\n\nPanache by the bucketload (’60s fashion looks glorious on Alicia Vikander and Elizabeth Debicki) but too too often style outweighs substance. And there’s not an ounce of chemistry between Solo Bonaparte (Henry Cavill – Superman) and Ilya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer – The Lone Ranger, The Social Network). Where was director Guy Ritchie’s high-octane entertainment of Sherlock Holmes and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels? Boring.\n\nRating: 31%\n\nDirector: Guy Ritchie (Sherlock Holmes, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels)\n\nWriter: Guy Ritchie (RocknRolla, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), Lionel Wigram – based on the TV series\n\nMain cast: Henry Cavill (Superman, Immortals), Armie Hammer (The Lone Ranger, The Social Network), Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina, Testament of Youth), Elizabeth Debicki (The Great Gatsby, Macbeth)"
