        "text": "Our safeguards and protocols for severe weather are focused on the safety of each camper. Our first line of defense includes constant monitoring of several weather resources. Our team is looking to the skies, the national weather service, emergency weather radios, as well as other weather outlets so as to have the very best and latest weather updates.\n\nWe have a rainy day schedule, which we use for both ordinary rainy days and in the event of an approaching threatening storm system, which moves all staff and campers indoors and into close proximity of our two storm shelters. This transition also clears most non-weather communications from the camp radio channels so that the camp directors and leadership can communicate more quickly with all of camp.\n\nIn the event that an approaching weather event has had tornado warnings issued in adjacent counties, or we anticipate severe straight-line winds, etc. we will, as conditions permit, move the staff and campers to the two main underground reinforced storm shelters before tornado warnings are issued in our area. We certainly move to those storm shelters anytime a tornado warning is issued. The staff and camp leadership will confirm that all campers are safe with their counselor and will continue to monitor the developing weather situation.\n\nOur severe weather procedures include communicating with our camp parents. As our first responsibility is to your child, we will focus our energies on making certain every camper and staff is secure during severe weather and then will communicate with you as quickly as possible.\n\nAt Camp Tekakwitha we understand the great privilege and responsibility that we take on when caring for your camper.\n\nDuring severe weather, as with any safety concern at camp, our team is devoted to the care, health, and safety of your child.\n\nAs the parents of five, we understand that it is hard to leave your children, but we can assure you that our trained staff will make every effort to ensure the safety and well-being of your child during his or her stay. Our staff goes through a thorough screening process, receives training in their areas of responsibility, and they are backed up by a professional administrative team that evaluates and educates them throughout the summer. All staff is VIRTUS trained. A 1:8 counselor-to-camper ratio is used. Specific procedures are in place for campers to easily communicate concerns directly to the camp directors. To ensure the integrity of the camp, staff members will check all baggage as you arrive. Food, gum, candy, jewelry, phones, MP3 players, and valuable items are not allowed.\n\nIf a family emergency occurs, or special circumstances require you to check on your child during camp, call Camp Tekakwitha’s office at 785-746-5693.\n\nThank you for allowing Camp Tekakwitha to be a part of your child’s summer. At Camp, our community is committed to the safety and well-being of each camper. As camp professionals, we know we are entrusted with your children, and we take this responsibility to protect your children very seriously. Camp Tekakwitha is a secure place. Our camp staff works with campers and public safety providers (local police and fire departments, emergency responders and hospitals, weather services and others) to mitigate any emergency. Our camp is accredited by the American Camp Association, which requires that we have risk and crisis management plans in place and that we conduct periodic reviews and drills of those plans.\n\nThank you for making Camp Tekakwitha a part of your family’s summer and May God bless you.\n\nIn Christ,\n\nDeacon Dana Nearmyer\n\nDeborah Nearmyer\n\nCamp Tekakwitha Directors\n\nRegarding sexuality and sexual identity, the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \"By creating the human being man and woman, God gives personal dignity equally to the one and the other. Each of them, man and woman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual identity.\" (Catechism of the Catholic Church (\"CCC\"), 2360-2363). By its very nature, sexuality is orderedto conjugal love of a man and woman within the bond of marriage (c. 1055). And marriage, which is a partnership of the whole of life, is always ordered by its very nature to both the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of children (Ibid.).All persons are called to chastity, to be lived out according to one's state in life (CCC, #2337-2359).\n\nAs Pope Francis notes, the sacred dignity of each individual person must always be respected, but that does not mean the Church must accept the confused notion of gender ideology. We must not demean or deny the sincerity and struggle of thosewho experience same-sex attraction or who feel their true gender identity is different from their biological sex. Rather, we seek to accompany them on their journey of life, offering them the light of the Gospel as they try to find their way forward. These truths are not merely faith-based; rather, such realities are also knowable through the use of properly functioning senses and right reason (Pope St. John Paul II, Fides et Ratio, #22) We do not serve anyone's greater good by falsifying the truth, for it is only the truth that frees us for the full life that God offers to each of us. Thus, when a person experiences same-sex attraction or some form of gender dysphoria, such struggles do not change the biological fact of how God created that person, and it would be untruthful for the Catholic Church or our Catholic Schools/Camp Tekakwitha to pretend otherwise. The policies of our Catholic Schools/Camp Tekakwitha, therefore, must reflect these fundamental truths.\n\nSchools/Camp Tekakwitha shall consider the gender of all students/campers as being consistent with their biological sex, including, but not limited to, the following: participation in school athletics/Camp Tekakwitha; school-sponsored dances;dress and uniform policies; the use of changing facilities, showers, cabins, locker rooms, and bathrooms; titles, names, and pronouns; and official school documents. If a student's expression or gender, sexual identity, or sexuality should cause confusion or disruption at the school, or if it should mislead others, cause scandal, or have the potential for causing scandal, thenthe matter will first be discussed with the student and his/her parents. If the issue is not resolved to the satisfaction of the school/Camp Tekakwitha, whose primary goal must always be to uphold Catholic truths and principles, then the matter shall be treated as any other serious discipline issue, and the student may be afforded a hearing to determine appropriate consequences.\n\nAll students/campers are expected to conduct themselves at school/camp in a manner consistent with their biological sex. Students/campers may not advocate, celebrate, or express same-sex attraction in such a way as to cause confusion or distraction in the context of Catholic school classes, activities, or at Camp Tekakwitha. When discussing homosexualityinclinations, the use of the term \"same-sex attraction\" is preferred, as it is a more appropriate description in accordance with the truths of Catholic faith and morals, which do not define an individual by sex but rather as a human person who is a child ofGod.\n\nDiplomas, transcripts, school/camp records, and any other official documents of the school /camp (\"official school documents\") shall be issued in conformity with the student's biological sex as based upon physical differences at birth and at thetime of the student's/camper’s enrollment. Official school documents are also historical documents and, as such, must accurately reflect the name and identity of the alumnus/alumna during the time in which he/she was enrolled at Camp Tekakwitha and/orgraduated from the school. If after graduation an alumnus/alumna legally changes his/her name, for whatever reason, and requests new versions of his/her official school/camp documents, the official school documents may be issued in the following format: \"Original Name, n.ka. New Legal Name\".\n\n*Adapted from Diocese of Little Rock Addenda to the Manual of Policies and Regulations for Elementary and Secondary Catholic Schools of Arkansas"
