        "text": "Ben van Berkel (Utrecht, 25 January 1957) is a Dutch architect. He studied at the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam and graduated cum laude from the Architectural Association in London in 1987. Together with Caroline Bos, he founded a new firm in 1998: UNStudio (United Net).\n\nUNStudio is a network of specialists in architecture, urban planning and infrastructure. Van Berkel designed among others the Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam, the Agora Theatre in Lelystad, the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Arnhem Central Station and the Prince Claus Bridge in Utrecht. Besides his architectural practice, Ben van Berkel teaches at various universities at home and abroad.\n\nArnhem Centraal\n\nThe 21,750m2 Transfer Terminal features a dramatic twisting structural roof geometry, which enables column-free spans of up to 60m in the transfer hall. Taking references from the continuous inside/outside surface of a Klein Bottle, UNStudio aimed to blur distinctions between the inside and outside of the terminal by continuing the urban landscape into the interior of the transfer hall, where ceilings, walls and floors all seamlessly transition into one another.\n\nThe structure of the roof and twisting column was only made possible by abandoning traditional construction methods and materials; much lighter steel replaced concrete – originally intended for the station – and was constructed using boat building techniques on a scale never before attempted.\n\nFoto credits: Eva Bloem, Ronald Thilleman, Frank Hanswijk & Siebe Swart\n\nAbout the Author:"
