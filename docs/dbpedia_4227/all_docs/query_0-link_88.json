        "text": "With so many great films this year, it was inevitable that a few little gems were going to slip through the cracks. For me, it turns out one of those is a film I was genuinely excited to see but never got around to. From the trailers, Guy Ritchie’s film version of the beloved 60s TV series ‘The Man From U.N.C.L.E’ looked like a lot of fun, full of breezy action and a terrific cast, but it seemed to disappear pretty much instantly. It’s a great pity, because the film not only met my expectations, but thoroughly exceeded them.\n\nSet during the height of the Cold War, the film throws CIA agent Napoleon Solo (Henry Cavill) together with KGB agent Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer), mortal enemies from either side of the Berlin Wall. They’re forced to work together to protect young mechanic Gaby Teller (Alicia Vikander) and help her track down her uncle, who holds the secret to a nuclear bomb currently in the hands of mysterious millionaire Victoria Vinciguerra (Elizabeth Debicki).\n\nHaving scored a surprising hit in his transition to Hollywood with the Sherlock Holmes films, Ritchie brings his frenetic and imaginative humour to ‘U.N.C.L.E’ with glorious success, revelling in the style and energy of the 60s setting. The screenplay cracks with wit and wisely spends more time on character than complicated narrative pyrotechnics. The plot is a tad ridiculous but that’s the point, a piece of spy fantasy set against the best of backdrops for such a story. In many ways, ‘U.N.C.L.E’ is an antidote to the gritty realism of Bourne and current Bond, a piece of giddy escapism populated by men in tailored suits, women in stunning dresses and thrilling Cold War espionage. It’s bright, bouncy and brimming with energy, Ritchie and his team having a ball playing with the many tools of visual storytelling at their disposal. Of all the technical elements though, the production design and costume design win hands down, Oliver Scholl and Joanna Johnston each nailing their idealised 60s style. It’s less a vision of the 60s as history as much as a vision of it through its film and popular culture, and it just adds to the tremendous enjoyment of the film."
