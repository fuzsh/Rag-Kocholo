        "text": "Once upon a time I decided to become a mentor with Big Brothers Big Sisters and I was matched with a beautiful eight year old little girl named Brittany. The original commitment was for a year, but we ended up being official “sisters” for over 10 years and that was 19 years ago now. I became a part of her family, spending time with her mum, aunts and uncles, grandmother and cousins. We had sleepovers, did lots of baking and cooking, crafts and painting and gardening. And spent afternoons listening to Ella Fitzgerald talking about what Brittany would like to do WHEN she went to college. My friends and family adopted Brittany into their hearts too and both of our circles widened. There were ups and downs, challenges and triumphs but through it all we loved each other just like blood sisters.\n\nI was inspired to shoot this personal project based on my relationship with Brittany after spending time with my mentor Joyce Tenneson. I had been in intern in Joyce’s New York studio when I studied photography. Years later I had the privilege of hosting Joyce while she was in town to speak at a conference. I told her I wanted to work on a project and after talking with her it seemed so obvious. And the Bigs & Littles Project was born.\n\nOur wonderful BBBS caseworker Jessie Jessen, helped me to locate some special matches to photograph - some who were new to the program and some who had been together for years. With the help of my studio manager Maria Arce, we photographed the matches in my studio. We laughed and played and the beauty of all the relationships came to life before our eyes. The power of someone believing in you is apparent but so too is the bond that gives rewards both ways. Love conquers all.\n\nDon’t miss Brittany and I down at the bottom! I am so grateful to Maria for photographing us so we could be a part of this project too - even Simon, my soulmate vizsla, joined in the fun. Brittany and her three little ones live in my city and we still call each other sister. Now I am an auntie to Kai’Lease, Se’Kairi & Keyvon."
