        "text": "The drama doesn’t stop after the arrests have been made.\n\nOver the past couple of weeks I have watched and enjoyed both Criminal UK and Criminal Spain, loving the fresh spin of the crime genre and how the action is self contained to the interview room. I decided to watch Criminal Germany next purely because I’d never watched anything German before but had heard that it was good.\n\nLike its British and Spanish counterparts, Criminal Germany looks at three different cases and three different suspects- with each episode following the detectives interviewing and investigating a particular case. The first episode (Jochen) sees detectives Schultz (Sylvester Groth) and Keller (Eva Meckbach) interviewing Real Estate Developer Jochen (Peter Kurth) about the dissapearance of a missing handyman that occured nearly 30 years ago. The missing handyman was working on one of Jochen’s very first properties and has not been seen or heard from since.\n\nJochen’s episode was a really great series opener, what started off as a simple missing persons case took quite the twist and had me glued to the screen. I think the episode introduced the new team well and I liked most of the characters pretty much straight away. Jochen’s episodse however was nothing compared to what was to come.\n\nThe second episode (Yilmaz) again has detectives Schultz and Keller interviewing young man Yilmaz (Deniz Arora) in what first appears to be a domestic abuse case. The accused’s wife was found at the bottom of her stairs and Yilmaz is highly suspected of having pushed her. The team attempt to question him but his lawyer Dr. Marquardt (Christian Berkel) is determined to do all the talking- which is strange considering he’s been hired by the victim’s father-in-law.\n\nYilmaz’ episode was another great case, I liked how in this case the suspect’s lawyer got so involved– with previous episodes having the legal defence play a more minimal role. It was almost like the lawyer was the one being interviewed because for the most part Yilmaz remained quiet whilst Marquardt did all the talking. The episode also pulled off another great twist like only Criminal can- most of the time when the cases seem too easy you can always expect an absolute curveball to come your way and I love it.\n\nThe final episode (Claudia) sees detectives Schultz and Keller going one on one with the girlfriend of a serial killer. Claudia (Nina Hoss) is the lover of a notorious serial killer Mark who raped and murdered several young girls. Now that Mark has long since died, Claudia is called into questioning when one of the original victim’s mothers wishes to know the location of where her daughter is buried before she dies. Schultz attempts to bargian with Claudia but the only information she is willing to accept is information about her daughter that she was forced to give up for information- which the team do not know. Keller decides to face Claudia one on one and attempt to gain the information herself- but is she putting herself in grave danger?\n\nClaudia’s episode was chilling and one of the best I’ve seen on criminal so far. The parts of the episode which just had Keller interviewing Claudia on her own were so tense and I couldn’t keep my eyes away. I do think Claudia is one of the more dangerous criminals we’ve seen on the show and seeing the team in actual danger had me on the edge of my seat.\n\nI know I haven’t seen Criminal France yet, but so far Criminal Germany is definately my favourite of those I have watched. It isn’t necessarily because of just one thing but a mixture of engaging cases, a great team and some suprisingly comic moments. The cases in Criminal Getmany were all so tense and engaging and each just got progressively better and better. All 3 episodes threw curveballs and offered something different for audiences.\n\nWhat I really loved though about Criminal Germany was the team- Schultz and Keller both made great detectives and characters. Keller is probably my favourite detective from the whole Criminal series so far, she had great intuition and was a formidable interviewer– she reminded me a lot of Eva from High Seas– correct me if I’m wrong but I’m pretty sure the dub actress was the same person? Possibly.\n\nI also loved Schultz- he made me laugh a lot, he was such a caricature of an angry detective stereotype and I just thought he was so funny. His refusal to let anyone help him and his butting heads but eventual sort of friendship with Keller was comical and suprisingly endearing and I thought his whole character brought a nice lighter tone to the series.\n\nI think my only complaint character wise would be that the two detectives- Borchert (Florence Kasumba) and Proska (Jonathan Berlin)– who sat in the interview room had very small roles. Every episode showed Keller and Schultz doing the interviewing whereas Borchet and Proska just sat there observing. I will admit that Proska made me laugh with his ongoing commentary of each case but I do wish the pair had gotten a chance to do some interviewing themselves."
