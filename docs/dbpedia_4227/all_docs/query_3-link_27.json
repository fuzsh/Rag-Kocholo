        "text": "Lewis Lloyd Landkamer passed away peacefully in his daughter Loriâs home in Dayton, WY on April 15 th , 2024.\n\nLew was born June 8 th , 1937 to Michael and Hilda (Reedy) Landkamer in Powell, NE. While growing up he attended Fairbury High School and worked on his parentsâ farm where he developed a green thumb and love for machinery. Following high school he worked all over the western U.S., mainly on road construction crews, before arriving in Lusk, WY while building Highway 18-20. Lew spent a few years in Niobrara County before going to Cheyenne, WY to help build the missile silos. While in Cheyenne he reconnected with Joe Ellen (Traphagan) of Lance Creek, WY who became his wife of 62 years.\n\nLew and Joe Ellen were married on December 10 th , 1960 at St. Leoâs Catholic church in Lusk and lived together in Cheyenne, Butte, MT and San Francisco, CA before moving back to Joe Ellenâs parentsâ ranch north of Lance Creek, WY in 1963. Lew owned and operated Landkamer Trenching for nearly 50 years, trenching hundreds of miles of pipeline in Niobrara County. He was honest to a fault, took a tremendous amount of pride in his work, and instilled work ethic in the many young men that worked for him over the years.\n\nA Nebraska farm boy at heart, Lew could grow corn âknee-high by 4 th of Julyâ even out in the Lance Creek elements. He loved raising tomatoes from seed, often growing them over 6â tall. His neighbors often found a variety of homegrown vegetables in their mailboxes.\n\nLew served as Niobrara County Commissioner from 1977 to 1984, served on the Niobrara County Conservation District board from 1987-1999, and served on the Predator Board as well.\n\nLew was a lifelong member of the Catholic Church and a member of the Knights of Columbus since he was a young man. He once said there had been times in his life when he had absolutely nothing but his faith in God â and that is what got him through.\n\nLew is preceded in death by his parents, Michael and Hilda Landkamer; sister Phyllis (Stahmer) and brothers William and Dale; and wife Joe Ellen. He is survived by his daughters Lori Landkamer of Dayton, WY, Lisa Hanson of Dayton, WY, and Teresa (Tom) Hanner of Fort Collins, CO; grandchildren Joseph Schrader of Billings, MT, Jaynee (Travis) Pardue of Laramie, WY, Eilish Hanson of Gillette, WY, Nadja (Jared) Perez of Loveland, CO, Alayna Goppert of Loveland, CO, and Megan Hanner of Fort Collins, CO; great-granddaughters Sophie Perez and Millie Lew Perez of Loveland, CO, great-grandson Mason Pardue; as well as many nieces, nephews, and lifelong friends.\n\nFuneral proceedings will be held April 22 nd in Lusk, WY at St. Leoâs Catholic Church. A rosary will be held at 1:30 p.m. followed by the funeral mass at 2:00 p.m. An internment ceremony will be held in Alexandria, NE on April 24 th at 11:00 a.m.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nKane Funeral Home has been entrusted with local arrangements.\n\nâ"
