        "text": "The lagoon of Mayotte, an island in the Indian Ocean, is a microcosm of the challenges facing vulnerable ecological systems world-wide. Its story also offers a model for community action to protect fragile systems.\n\nMayotte is a French territory and a destination for large numbers of French holiday-makers. The lagoon is one of the largest in the world, with an enclosing reef of nearly 200km in length: it is at the very heart of the island's social, cultural and economic life.\n\nOliver Dickinson's beautifully crafted observational documentary explores the many ways in which the islanders - the Mahorans - are committed to protecting the lagoon, with its 22 species of marine mammals, 200 species of coral, and 700 species of fish.\n\nEconomic development together with an increasing population have put severe strains on the lagoon's marine life. Work to preserve the lagoon starts at the top of the mountains of Mayotte: terrestrial and marine ecosystems are strongly linked together, and the health of the lagoon is vulnerable to mud and waste water.\n\nFishermen, farmers, tour operators, artists and environmental groups, are all part of the story of creating awareness and building a community culture of \"caring\" for the lagoon for future generations.\n\nThe vibrant music for the film is composed and performed by Eliasse, a young Mahoran composer and master of the guitar, who has been performing on European stages since 1999.\n\nAWARDS\n\nBronze Award, Baku International Film Festival\n\nGrand Prix of Ecology, Warsaw FilmAT Festival\n\nSilver Award, Tourfilm Riga Festival\n\nGolden Award nominee, Al Jazeera Documentary Film Festival\n\nCousteau Award, Lille Ecollywood Film Festival\n\nSilver Award, Tehran Roshd International Film Festival\n\nBest Environmental Film Award, Jahorina International Film Festival\n\nBest Film on Natural & Cultural Heritage Preservation, European Environmental Film Festival\n\nGolden Wave Award (Best Ecology Film), Silver Lake International Film Festival\n\nFESTIVALS\n\nTo Save and Preserve Environmental Film Festival, Russia\n\nBaku International Film Festival, Azerbaijan\n\nBogota Festival de Cine, Colombia\n\nKarlovy Vary Tourfilm Festival, Czech Republic\n\nBucharest DocumentArt Film Festival, Romania\n\nPrague Life Sciences Film Festival, Czech Republic\n\nMatsalu Nature Film Festival, Estonia\n\nBrisbane SCinema Film Festival, Australia\n\nWondering Well Nature Film Festival, Serbia\n\nBelize International Film Festival, Belize\n\nWarsaw FilmAT Festival, Poland\n\nTourfilm Riga Festival, Latvia\n\nAl Jazeera Documentary Film Festival, Qatar\n\nInternational Envirofilm Festival, Slovakia\n\nOstrava Nature Film Festival, Czech Republic\n\nSTEPS International Documentary Festival, Ukraine\n\nDompierre Nature Encounters Film Festival, France\n\nNova Friburgo SocioEnvironmental Film Festival, Brazil\n\nLille Ecollywood Film Festival, France\n\nTehran Roshd International Film Festival, Iran\n\nKuala Lumpur Eco Film Festival, Malaysia\n\nMénigoute Nature Film Festival, France\n\nBratislava Ekotop Film Festival, Slovakia\n\nJahorina International Film Festival, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nEuropean Environmental Film Festival, Bulgaria\n\nSilver Lake International Film Festival, Serbia"
