        "text": "In this modern crime series inspired by the Nordic noir dramas, a body is found in the Moravian woods: that of a famous regional politician who was killed in the style of medieval torture practices and carefully arranged to create a weird scene. A police chase of the sadistic perpetrator is launched; the killer complicates the investigation team's progress by committing a series of murders that shocks the inhabitants of the whole region and the investigators themselves by their cruel rituality. Efforts to find the link between them and the current political activities bring no result, as the case's roots are in the distant past.\n\nSomewhere in the Forbidden Forest lives a wicked sorcerer Kruciatus (Josef Abrhám). One hundred years ago he tried to destroy a kingdom now ruled by King Alexander (Jaromír Hanzlík), who has two sons - the heir of the throne Prince Jan (Patrik Dergel) and the younger Prince Karel (Krystof Hádek). Karel is not satisfied with his role of the underrated second-placer. With the help of his servant Pakosta (Pavel Kríz), he breaks into the forbidden chamber full of magical properties, remaining there after the evil wizard, and intends to destroy his brother in order to get the throne for himself.\n\nPetronel, an angel, is still working at the Heaven's gates but is confident that he deserves a better function. His everlasting tempter Uriah, a devil, takes up tempting him. All one has to do to know all that God knows is pick an apple from the tree of knowledge. And then, the route to the well-deserved acknowledgment is free. Petronel and Uriah than proceed to argue about the apple, ant the results are catastrophic. The precious fruit falls all the way down to the Earth. The confused angel and his friend, the devil-tempter, have to quickly enter the human world, find the apple of Knowledge and bring it back. The night before Saint Nicolase's day they get tangled up in a peculiar whirl. They meet little Anezka and her beautiful mother, a crew of deceitful carolers, the greedy Kostál and a likable Sausage-seller. Before they manage to find the apple and bring it back where it belongs, they first have to endure a great adventure and get through quite a few dangerous setups.\n\nThe Zodiac Murders series does not aspire to rank among other popular crime serials; it seeks to become one of a new, modern style. The line connecting all its parts are the signs of the zodiac. Each of the twelve episodes deals with a mysterious crime, of characteristics associated with the respective sign. Apart from the standard crime investigation elements, in each episode we can follow a \"private\" line, represented by an amorous triangle kept secret, formed by major Holina, the intelligent and competent head of the investigation team, his subordinate captain Rostia Bor, confined to wheelchair due to an accident, and his wife, psychologist Sabina, who studies and uses astrology for psychological personality analysis, thus helping the two detectives in their work.\n\nThe last drop for Jan's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, whose strength and patience ran dry. Grandma made decisions about Grandpa's life, old age as well as the funeral. Jan is sure that he and his wife Olga are on the same route. He recalls his past life when he used to have his own will and dreams and he wants to live again with dignity and freedom. He longs to control his own life again. And his solution is escape from the present life. In this movie we watch, in parallel ,the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka and his sons-in-law Erik and Pepík."
