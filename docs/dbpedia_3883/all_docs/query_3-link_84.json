        "text": "Andrew Traucki’s The Reef is one of the best shark attack horror movies ever made, a simple tale of friends stranded in shark-infested waters that’s made all the more terrifying due to Traucki’s insistence on using real sharks rather than animatronic or computer-generated ones.\n\nThis summer, a brand new sequel titled The Reef: Stalked is swimming to theaters, VOD and Shudder on July 29, and with that, we have a new poster from the film that turns a great white shark into a stalker.\n\nIn the sequel…\n\n“Nic, in an effort to heal after witnessing her sister’s horrific murder, travels to a tropical resort with her friends for a kayaking and diving adventure. Only hours into their expedition, the women are stalked and then attacked by a great white shark. To survive they will need to band together and Nic will have to overcome her post-traumatic stress, face her fears and slay the monster.”\n\nWritten and directed by Andrew Traucki (Black Water) as a follow up to his 2010 film, The Reef: Stalked stars Teressa Liane (“The Vampire Diaries”), Ann Truong (“Cowboy Bebop”), Saskia Archer (Boshack), Kate Lister (“Clickbait”) and Tim Ross (“Wonderland”)."
