Check them out here…\n\nThe Reef: Stalked stars Nic (Teressa Liane, The Vampire Diaries) and Annie (Saskia Archer, Boshack) as two sisters who set off on a dream vacation with their friends in an effort to escape the trauma of their sister’s murder. However, their Pacific island adventure turns bad when they hit the surf and within hours they find themselves far from land, stalked by a great white shark."
