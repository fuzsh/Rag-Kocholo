Visiting her den and tracking her movements for months on end he eventually wins the animal’s trust and they develop a never-before-seen bond between human and wild animal.\n\n8.1/10\n\n93%\n\n380\n\nIce on Fire\n\nMovie | United States | 06/23/2019 | HBO | Documentary | Nature\n\nAn eye-opening documentary that asks the question: Are we going to let climate change destroy civilization, or will we act on technologies that can reverse it? Featuring never-before-seen solutions on the many ways we can reduce carbon in the atmosphere thus paving the way for temperatures to go down, saving civilization.\n\n7.4/10\n\n91%\n\n63\n\nChasing Coral\n\nMovie | United States | 03/16/2017 | Netflix | Documentary | Nature\n\nCoral reefs are the nursery for all life in the oceans, a remarkable ecosystem that sustains us. Yet with carbon emissions warming the seas, a phenomenon called “coral bleaching”—a sign of mass coral death—has been accelerating around the world, and the public has no idea of the scale or implication of the catastrophe silently raging underwater.\n\n8.1/10\n\n100%\n\nWild Life\n\nMovie | United States | 04/14/2023 | Documentary | Nature\n\nFrom Oscar-winning filmmakers Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, Wild Life follows conservationist Kris Tompkins on an epic, decades-spanning love story as wild as the landscapes she dedicated her life to protecting. After falling in love in mid-life, Kris and the outdoorsman and entrepreneur Doug Tompkins left behind the world of the massively successful outdoor brands they'd helped pioneer like Patagonia, The North Face, and Esprit, and turned their attention to a visionary effort to create National Parks throughout Chile and Argentina. Wild Life chronicles the highs and lows of their journey to effect the largest private land donation in history.\n\n7.0/10\n\n87%\n\nWild Prague\n\nMovie | Czech Republic | 08/04/2022 | Documentary | Nature\n\nAmidst today’s urban jungle of concrete, glass and metal, it is easy to forget that we actually live in the territory formerly dominated by wildlife. Many of its members have been exterminated by humans, while others have fled the sprawling urbanization to the surrounding countryside. It is their survival strategies that get revealed in exciting detail in the documentary series, Planet Czechia. For two years, a team of camera operators headed by Jan Hošek were recording a life cycle of Prague’s wild animal world across all seasons of the year. The film, accompanied by the commentary read by the actor Jiří Macháček, registers everyday struggles of the fat dormouse, the mouflon, blackbirds or the water hen, teaching the viewers in a casual manner a higher degree of tolerance toward the city’s overlooked inhabitants.\n\n7.3/10\n\n33\n\nFire of Love\n\nMovie | United States | 07/06/2022 | Documentary | Nature\n\nKatia and Maurice Krafft loved two things — each other, and volcanoes. For two decades, the daring French volcanologist couple were seduced by the thrill and danger of this elemental love triangle. They roamed the planet, chasing eruptions and their aftermath, documenting their discoveries in stunning photographs and breathtaking film to share with an increasingly curious public in media appearances and lecture tours. Ultimately, Katia and Maurice would lose their lives during a 1991 volcanic explosion on Japan’s Mount Unzen, but they would leave a legacy that would forever enrich our knowledge of the natural world.\n\n7.6/10\n\n99%\n\n14\n\nMarch of the Penguins\n\nMovie | France | 01/26/2005 | Documentary | Nature\n\nEvery year, thousands of Antartica's emperor penguins make an astonishing journey to breed their young.

Within the environment of open cast brown coalmines and spoil tips which are the reminder of a lunar landscape, one finds paradoxically a true tale of an impregnable wild countryside.\n\n8.1/10\n\n16\n\nWinged Migration\n\nMovie | France | 12/12/2001 | Documentary | Nature\n\nThe cameras of Jacques Perrin fly with migratory birds: geese, storks, cranes. The film begins with spring in North America and the migration to the Arctic; the flight is a community event for each species. Once in the Arctic, it's family time: courtship, nests, eggs, fledglings, and first flight. Chicks must soon fly south. Bad weather, hunters, and pollution take their toll. Then, the cameras go\n\n8.0/10\n\n95%\n\nEarth: One Amazing Day\n\nMovie | United Kingdom | 08/04/2017 | Documentary | Nature\n\nAn astonishing journey revealing the awesome power of the natural world.

Blackfish shows the sometimes devastating consequences of keeping such intelligent and sentient creatures in captivity.\n\n8.1/10\n\n98%\n\n173\n\nGenesis\n\nMovie | France | 09/26/2004 | Documentary | Nature\n\nAn African narrator tells the story of earth history, the birth of the universe and evolution of life.

Here is the story of how the Stasi gained control over the lives of the East German people and the methods it used.\n\n7.2/10\n\n9\n\nLast to Know\n\nMovie | Germany | 02/11/2006 | Documentary | Society\n\nIn the documentary Last To Know political prisoners, sent to jail for openly opposing the East German regime that existed until the German reunification in 1990, talk about their times of trial and their lives today.
