        "meta_description": "Secrets of the Reef (2008) is an immersion into the metropolis of a Pacific coral reef as seen through the lives of three animals. Their struggle for survival is set against a backdrop of incredible beauty and color, and includes dozens of other animals, each going about their daily life on the reef.  From the tiny, but deadly, blue-ringed octopus to the largest fish in the world, the whale shark, the connections between all the members of the coral reef are highlighted. But all is not well in paradise. An unseen threat to the reef community approaches closer by the dayâ€”a threat bigger than any they have seen before.  The film culminates in a shocking and sobering ending that makes a bold statement about reef conservation.\n\nSecrets of the Reef  is a feature-length documentary by Emmy Award-winning cinematographer Jonathan Bird and was filmed on location in high definition.  He and the film crew completed more than1,000 dives over two years, capturing almost 100 hours of footage to create this epic tale of survival. Secrets of the Reef  is a captivating and stunningly-photographed film that will enthrall viewers of all ages.     (Originally released in 2008)",
