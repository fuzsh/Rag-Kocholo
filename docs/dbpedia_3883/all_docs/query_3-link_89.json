        "text": "If you’re a fan of shark attack films, I’ve got a trailer here for you to watch for a new thriller titled The Reef: Stalked, which is a sequel to the 2010 film The Reef. The director of the first movie, Andrew Traucki, returns to write and direct the sequel.\n\nI don’t recall ever seeing the first film, but it’s described as being “one of the best shark attack horror movies ever made, a simple tale of friends stranded in shark-infested waters that’s made all the more terrifying due to Traucki’s insistence on using real sharks rather than animatronic or computer-generated ones.”\n\nSo, he threw his actors into real shark-infested waters and yelled “Action!” I guess that’s one way to do it.\n\nIn the sequel, “Nic, in an effort to heal after witnessing her sister’s horrific murder, travels to a tropical resort with her friends for a kayaking and diving adventure. Only hours into their expedition, the women are stalked and then attacked by a great white shark. To survive they will need to band together and Nic will have to overcome her post-traumatic stress, face her fears and slay the monster.”\n\nMark Ward, Chief Acquisitions Officer of RLJE Films shared in a statement: “Audiences have an insatiable appetite for shark films, which we know first-hand from our incredible experience releasing The Reef years ago. We are thrilled to be working with the team again to bring this new terrifying adventure to audiences.”\n\nThe Reef: Stalked stars Teressa Liane (The Vampire Diaries), Ann Truong (Cowboy Bebop), Saskia Archer (Boshack), Kate Lister (Clickbait) and Tim Ross (Wonderland).\n\nRLJE Films will debut The Reef: Stalked in select US theaters and on VOD starting July 29th, 2022. Watch the trailer and let us know what you think!"
