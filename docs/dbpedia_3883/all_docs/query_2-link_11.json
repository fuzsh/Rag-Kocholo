        "text": "The table below lists a yearly breakdown of information about movies produced by production companies based in Czech Republic. The Share is a percentage based on total worldwide box office of the movies produced by production companies in this country relative to the combined worldwide box office of all movies in the listed year. Please note that movies that are co-produced by different countries count for the share of each country, and the production country information in our database is incomplete. These factors will typically cause the share percentages in a specific year not to add up to 100%. Click on the year number for a list of all the films released that year. Click on the movie name to see information on the individual film.\n\nNote: Since we are still actively researching production countries, we consider this chart to be in beta mode. While we make every effort to collect all available data, there are inevitably omissions and errors. Please help us by sending corrections to corrections@the-numbers.com."
