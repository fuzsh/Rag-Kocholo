        "text": "Idodo\n\nUrsula Ulmi\n\n10:00 | Switzerland\n\nIDODO adapts a local legend by the Ziag Zagaz clan of Papua New Guinea into film and brings the diverse and unique cultural heritage of Papua New Guinea to an international audience. The animated short film retells the story of how reef fish got their beautiful colours and is a dedicated collaboration between filmmakers, artists, performers and musicians from Papua New Guinea and PNG-born Swiss director Ursula Ulmi, rooted in cultural authenticity and co-creation.\n\nLong ago the fish transformed into humans and came onto land to celebrate and dance. Once the sun set, they hurried back into the sea, leaving behind a big mess. Curious as to who occupied the village in their absence, the villagers of one island plan to find out who these uninvited visitors were. What they would soon discover, leaves them astounded and mesmerized.\n\nScreenings and Awards\n\nUrsula Ulmi\n\nBorn 1981 in Papua New Guinea. Raised in Switzerland and Kenya. Studied Animation at University of applied Science & Arts Lucerne, in Switzerland and received Diploma degree with distinction in 2008. Graduation film “Moon Children” was shown at over 50 film festivals worldwide and won several awards. From 2009 – 2015 worked as 2D animator, puppet modeler and production manager in the European Animation Industry. Since 2016 independent Animation Producer and Director in Switzerland.\n\nhttps://instagram.com/idodofilm/"
