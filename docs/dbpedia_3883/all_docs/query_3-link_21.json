        "text": "\"It's not gonna stop!!\" RLJE + Shudder have debuted a final, wild trailer for The Reef: Stalked, the shark horror movie out in theaters this week - starting on July 29th. The Reef: Stalked is a sequel to Australian director Andrew Traucki's shark movie The Reef from 2010, and Traucki returns to write & direct this one 12 years later. After her sister's murder, Nic, her younger sister and two friends seek solace through a Pacific island kayaking adventure. Hours into the trip the women are stalked by a shark and must band together, face their fears and save each other facing the beast. This movie stars Teressa Liane (from \"The Vampire Diaries\"), Ann Truong (seen in \"Cowboy Bebop\"), Saskia Archer, Kate Lister, and Tim Ross. These trailers have not been that impressive, especially with so many other shark movies this year. There's barely any clear shots of the shark, just a lot of screaming. Will this sequel be any good? Anyone planning to see it?\n\nHere's the second US trailer (+ poster) for Andrew Traucki's The Reef: Stalked, direct from YouTube:\n\nYou can watch the international trailer for Traucki's The Reef: Stalked here, or the other US trailer here."
