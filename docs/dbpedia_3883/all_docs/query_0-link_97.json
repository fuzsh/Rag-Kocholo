        "text": "Everyone knows that Hawaii is one of the most gorgeous locations in the world, but not everyone is aware that Hawaii is home to 11 of the world’s 13 climatic zones, which makes it not only a vacationer’s paradise but a filmmaker’s paradise as well.\n\nHawaii’s varying landscapes can create scenes that resemble African deserts, South American rainforests, Irish countrysides, and metropolitan cities. Add to that Hawaii’s perfect weather, and you have the recipe for a well-established film industry.\n\nMany Hollywood films have been created in Hawaii. Here are a handful of movies filmed in Hawaii — some of them just might surprise you.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg chose Kauai to film his blockbuster hit ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’. Kipu Ranch and Anahola Mountains provided the backdrop to create a Peruvian temple deep in the Amazon jungle where Harrison Ford starred as the archaeology professor, Indiana Jones in this 1981 adventure film.\n\nThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire\n\nThis 2013 dystopian science fiction film, based on the successful Hunger Games novels, began filming in Atlanta, Georgia before moving locations to Hawaii to capture the arena scenes. The film’s star Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Katniss Everdeen, and her co-stars, filmed scenes from the Quarter Quell on an isolated beach on Oahu.\n\nJumanji: The Next Level and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\n\nDwayne “The Rock” Johnson stars in this series, which builds on the 1995 film starring Robin Williams. Visitors to Hawaii can visit one of the many filming locations for Jumanji without having to jump into a deadly game of escape! On the island of Oahu, scenes for “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” were filmed at Kualoa Ranch in Kaneohe, Kawela Bay in Koʻolauloa, Waimea Valley in Haleiwa, the Judd Trail in Nuʻuanu Valley, and Kapena Falls at Alapena Pool. On the Island of Hawaiʻi, visit Kawainui Falls in Pepeekeo.\n\nGodzilla, Godzilla vs. Kong, & Kong: Skull Island\n\nIn addition to Vietnam and Australia, the “Monsterverse” producers of “Godzilla,” “Kong: Skull Island,” and “Godzilla vs. Kong” chose Oahu, Kauaʻi and Hawaiʻi Island for the 2014 release of “Godzilla” to transport audiences to the birthplace of one of the most powerful monster myths of all time. Starring Samuel Jackson, the film follows a team of scientists who set off to explore an uncharted island in the Pacific, ultimately trespassing on the territory of Kong.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End, & On Stranger Tides\n\nTwo of the movies from Disney’s hit franchise starring Johnny Depp in his iconic role of Captain Jack Sparrow included filming locations in Hawaii.\n\nKaua’i and O’ahu are featured prominently in the 2011 film “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.” Producer Jerry Bruckheimer chose Hawaii for its extraordinary and exotic locations that provide an amazing range of both land and seascapes. “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End” included shots from Maui and Moloka’i.\n\nJurassic Park, Jurassic World, & Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\n\nFilmed at Kualoa Ranch on Oahu, visitors can enjoy a Kualoa Ranch movie tour and see the famous “Jurassic Park” movie location from the 1993 film that kicked off the franchise. Other well-known films such as Pearl Harbor, and the Magnum P.I. series were also shot at this gorgeous site. With such a magnificent backdrop it’s easy to see why filmmakers are drawn to this location.\n\nFinding Nemo\n\nSurprise! OK, while the wildly popular Disney animated film wasn’t exactly shot in Hawaii, Disney did send an underwater film crew to Big Island’s Kealakekua Bay to inspire animators with footage of one of most pristine and beautiful marine sanctuaries in the world. The bay’s beauty is clearly ‘picture perfect’!\n\nList of Movies Filmed in Hawaii and Release Date"
