        "text": "It has been less than seven years since the Czech and Slovak republics peacefully split up after some 70 years together as Czechoslovakia.\n\nBut recent surveys indicate that, although Czech and Slovak are among the closest of languages in the family of Slavic tongues, and the two peoples can communicate without difficulty, the youngest of Czech schoolchildren now have difficulty understanding their Slovak counterparts.\n\n''My 10-year-old granddaughter visited Slovakia this summer, and I swear she didn't understand a single word,'' said Bozena Ivankova, 62, a former director of the only Slovak elementary school in the Czech Republic. Mrs. Ivankova, a Slovak who has lived in Czech lands for 20 years, was shocked.\n\n''It made me realize how little time you need to lose touch,'' she said. ''I try to teach her Slovak words, but it might as well be Russian. For Czech children, Slovak is just another foreign language. There is no hope of restoring what we had before.''\n\n''This is very sad,'' she said with a sigh, considering that Czechs and Slovaks, who had shared a state since 1918 with a five-year interruption during World War II, used to read one another's poetry, watch one another's TV programs and attend one another's universities without any language barrier.\n\nThe barriers began to grow after Dec. 31, 1992, when Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved into the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
