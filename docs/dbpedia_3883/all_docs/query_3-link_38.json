        "text": "Australian shark nailbiter dials up the realism with some good underwater footage, well done attacks, and solid tension. Lazy afternoon movie scratched my shark movie craving despite the slow burn open water impending doom type movies not usually being my thing. It‚Äôs ok‚Äîunnerving when it needs to be... plus knowing that this was based on real events gives me anxiety because this whole situation is nightmare terrible.\n\nAs an Australian person myself I am allowed to say this, Australian people are the worst, they make for the most annoying characters ever. I was gunning for the shark to eat every single one of them.\n\nThe amount of times they said ‚Äúwhat was that?‚Äù or ‚Äúshit, what is it?‚Äù had me so frustrated, umm you‚Äôre in the middle of the ocean stranded, what the eff do you think it is you dumbass? Anyway, movie was ok, just awful characters.\n\n\"Alright look yeah there might be sharks... I don't know\" - Uninspiring Speech,\n\n- Daily Horror Hunt #12 (June 2019): boxd.it/2XMsk\n\nDay 20: Watch a shark movie.\n\nI'd swim my ass off. I am an enneagram 8, I will swim until my arms fall off or I pass out.\n\nFive attractive people go on a trip to the Reef and get chased by Great White sharks when they get stuck in the reef. I just found every person in this to be boring. You know what makes sharks much more interesting? Stephen Spielberg and John Williams.\n\nI ended up hoping all these people would die. Not a recommend!\n\nRec by Child of Chaos TarzanTABI\n\nletterboxd.com/boyo24/\n\nWater water everywhere so let's all have a drink\n\nboxd.it/cmQoM\n\nI knew who gave me this rec off the jump. Thanks Tabi, you are the man.\n\nI actually like this more than I thought. As this movie is as much about surviving the vast ocean as it is sharks.\n\nHere is the thing. Sharks don't kill people in the ocean. Dehydration and hypothermia? Real issues\n\nAlso, what a downer ending.\n\nHey T squared, more sharks please\n\nü¶àSummer Horror Thriller üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nActually \"inspired by a true story\", this Australian film takes you there. Starting off at its own pace while getting familiar with the characters and then starts swimming off to Tension territory that is so real and lurks around the remaining time.\n\nThe visuals and underwater visuals are absolutely beautiful being everything is real even down to the sharks being \"real shark footage\", and the convincing performances during these scenes were so surreal and tense.\n\nUnderrated little shark film that is perfect for a Summer watch.\n\n7/10\n\n‚òÄÔ∏è\"That Summer Feeling\" Ranked‚òÄÔ∏è\n\nüëâ boxd.it/ww4qg\n\nHard to believe that only 1 person wore goggles out in the ocean.\n\nBased on a true story I'm sure the film industry likes to exaggerate just to make it more intense, but still.\n\nThere were a few moments that were like whoa wait a minute what did I miss. One moment the guy is down in the boat and the next he's under water inside the boat.\n\nOverall, it was alright.\n\nüåä\n\nI thought this movie would be utter shit.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThis was actually pretty good. Although I dont exactly know too much about the characters, I was on the edge of my seat for the majority of the movie.\n\nAlso CGI wise, this is the best shark movie I have yet to lay eyes upon. When Luke looks under the water to see what dangers lurk and a massive fucking Great White Shark starts getting closer! Wow.\n\nIf I had bowel issues, I would have shit my pants... Literally"
