A seasoned writer and editor, I fully believe that the pen is mightier than the sword. If I were given three wishes, one would definitely be to have the ability to travel - in time, dimension and places! Basically, I want a TARDIS! Of the 40 countries I've visited, Jordan, Japan, Italy and Croatia are my top favourite. London, having lived there, will always have my love, but Nepal and India have my soul! I love adventure (I'm from the mountains, what did you expect!), sports, music and food, so I travel to catch concerts, matches and races. I mostly write about off-beat travel, local experiences, best shopping spots, travel guides and coffee shops. Basically, give me coffee, a book, adventures and an enchanted forest, and you'll never hear me complain."
