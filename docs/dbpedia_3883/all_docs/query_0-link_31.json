        "text": "This article is about the series. For the protagonist of this series, see SpongeBob SquarePants (character).\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants is an American animated television series and the tenth major Nicktoon created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. The series premiered with a sneak-peek preview consisting of its pilot, \"Help Wanted\", and the episodes \"Reef Blower\" and \"Tea at the Treedome\", after the Kids' Choice Awards on May 1, 1999. Its official debut was on July 17th of the same year with the episode pair \"Bubblestand\" / \"Ripped Pants\". It is currently the longest running Nicktoon series and the only Nickelodeon animated television series of the 1990â€™s to continue running to this day.\n\nThe main character is an accident-prone sea sponge, SpongeBob SquarePants, who lives in an underwater pineapple with his pet snail Gary. His neighbors are his best friend, Patrick Star, and a sour octopus named Squidward. SpongeBob works for a cheapskate crab named Mr. Krabs, who lives in an anchor with his whale daughter Pearl. SpongeBob is enrolled in a boat-driving school run by Mrs. Puff, a pufferfish, and often spends time with a thrill-seeking squirrel from Texas named Sandy. The villains of the show are Plankton and Karen, the owners of a failing restaurant called the Chum Bucket. Most episodes take place in the town of Bikini Bottom or on the surrounding seafloor.\n\nThe cartoon is designed to appeal to older viewers as much as to children. Underwater life and situations are represented, absurdly, as though they are almost equivalent to normal terrestrial lifestyles. Instead of cars, the residents of Bikini Bottom drive boats with wheels. A flurry of bubbles accompany many actions, to remind the viewer everything is underwater. Squidward lives in an Easter Island head and Patrick lives under a rock. The suggestion is that the characters' dwellings have fallen from a tropical island to become underwater habitats. Snails behave like cats, while jellyfish act like bees, worms are the undersea equivalent of dogs, and scallops are often likened to birds.\n\nThe SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, the first theatrical film based on the series, was released on November 19, 2004. According to Square Roots, the movie was also the reason for the long production hiatus between the third and fourth season. A second movie, titled The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, was released on February 6, 2015. A third movie, titled The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, was released on August 14, 2020 in Canada and August 13, 2020 in the Czech Republic. It was released on Paramount+ on March 4, 2021 in the United States. A fourth theatrical movie is in development and will be released on December 19, 2025, with three spin-off films, exclusively for Netflix and Paramount+, also in development.\n\nHistory/Production[]\n\nMain article: History of SpongeBob SquarePants\n\nTheme song[]\n\nMain article: SpongeBob SquarePants Theme Song\n\nThe theme song, a sea shanty-style tune is sung by Pat Pinney and can also be found on the soundtrack, SpongeBob SquarePants: Original Theme Highlights. A cover of the song by superstar Avril Lavigne can be found on the soundtrack for The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. There was also a choral version done for the early episodes.\n\nFor several special episodes, the theme song was altered to fit the plot of the episode, such as in \"Christmas Who?\" and \"What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?\"\n\nSetting[]\n\nThe series is set in an underwater city named Bikini Bottom, which is located on the floor of the Pacific Ocean beneath Bikini Atoll. The citizens are mostly fish of different colors who live in ship funnels and drive boatmobiles. Main locations within Bikini Bottom include Conch Street, The Krusty Krab, and the Chum Bucket, Mrs. Puff's Boating School, Sandy's treedome, Jellyfish Fields, and Goo Lagoon. Special episodes of the show are usually presented from Patchy's house in Encino, California.\n\nBubbles are seen whenever something moves quickly, and they fill the screen to transition between scenes. As a cartoon, it includes many unrealistic occurrences that could not happen underwater: fires, tears, rain, flooding a building, inhabitants drinking liquids from glasses, bathtubs filled with what seems to be water, a seaside resort, and fish walking instead of swimming.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nMain article: List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants - A square sea sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea. He works at the Krusty Krab along with his boring neighbor Squidward. He has a best friend named Patrick Star.\n\nPatrick Star - A cheerful, naive, and unintelligent starfish who is SpongeBob's best friend. He lives under a rock to the right of Squidward's house. He is unemployed but has held various temporary jobs throughout the series.\n\nSquidward Tentacles - An arrogant octopus who lives in an Easter Island head between SpongeBob and Patrick's houses. Although loved by the other characters (except Squilliam), Squidward is pessimistic and asocial. He loathes his job as the cashier at the Krusty Krab.\n\nSandy Cheeks - Another friend of SpongeBob's, Sandy is an athletic squirrel from Texas. She wears an astronaut suit and lives in an air-filled \"Treedome\" so that she can survive Bikini Bottom's ocean environment. She works as a scientist and an inventor.\n\nEugene H. Krabs - The cheapskate, miserly owner of the Krusty Krab. Commonly known as Mr. Krabs, he is SpongeBob and Squidward's boss. He lives in an anchor with his daughter Pearl, who is a whale.\n\nSheldon J. Plankton - A small green copepod who runs the failing Chum Bucket restaurant along with his sentient computer Karen. His goal is to steal the secret Krabby Patty formula and run Mr. Krabs out of business. He is a skilled inventor and often creates machines to assist him in his plots.\n\nKaren Plankton - A waterproof supercomputer who lives in the Chum Bucket laboratory. She acts as Plankton's sidekick and wife, providing him with evil plans to steal the recipe for Krabby Patties. Plankton always takes the credit for Karen's ideas and ends up messing them up.\n\nMrs. Puff - SpongeBob's teacher at boating school. She is a pufferfish who blows up like an airbag whenever she is scared or crashes. SpongeBob is her longest-standing student. She is Mr. Krabs' love interest and girlfriend.\n\nPearl Krabs - A whale who lives in a hollow anchor with her father, Mr. Krabs. When she grows up, her father wants her to continue the family business by inheriting the Krusty Krab and becoming its owner. She is currently a teenager who spends most of her time and money at the mall.\n\nGary - SpongeBob's pet snail who meows like a cat, as do the other snails on the show. He is very intelligent, as revealed in the episode \"Your Shoe's Untied.\" Gary actually wears shoes, and taught SpongeBob how to tie his shoes. Gary also has many other items stored in his shell.\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nMain article: SpongeBob SquarePants episode list\n\nSeason Episodes First episode Last episode Pilot 0 1997 Season 1 20 May 1, 1999 March 3, 2001 Season 2 20 October 20, 2000 July 26, 2003 Season 3 20 October 5, 2001 October 11, 2004 Season 4 20 May 6, 2005 July 24, 2007 Season 5 20 February 19, 2007 July 19, 2009 Season 6 26 March 3, 2008 July 5, 2010 Season 7 26 July 19, 2009 June 11, 2011 Season 8 26 March 26, 2011 December 6, 2012 Season 9 26 July 21, 2012 February 20, 2017 Season 10 11 October 15, 2016 December 2, 2017 Season 11 26 June 24, 2017 November 25, 2018 Season 12 26 November 11, 2018 April 29, 2022 Season 13 26 October 22, 2020 November 1, 2023 Season 14 26 November 2, 2023 TBA Season 15 26 TBA TBA\n\nMovies[]\n\nHome video releases[]\n\nMain article: SpongeBob SquarePants videography\n\nMain article: SpongeBob SquarePants international videography\n\nCast[]\n\nTom Kenny: SpongeBob SquarePants, Gary the Snail, Patchy the Pirate, French Narrator\n\nBill Fagerbakke: Patrick Star\n\nRodger Bumpass: Squidward Tentacles\n\nClancy Brown: Eugene H.
