        "text": "American River\n\nMary Bruno spent her childhood along one of the most polluted waterways in America. Decades later, she returns to kayak the river of her youth and tell its story.\n\nAmerican River is a new 86-minute documentary film that follows Ms. Bruno and guide Carl Alderson on a 4-day, 80 mile adventure down the Passaic River, from its pristine source in a wildlife refuge to its toxic mouth in Newark Bay. The river’s amazing history, geology and ecology are revealed as the kayakers navigate challenges, travel through urban landscapes and head towards the industrial disaster that has poisoned the Passaic for the past 60 years\n\nThe Ocean Solution\n\nFarming under the sea? Meet Bren Smith, the ocean farming pioneer whose vertical kelp and shellfish farms can transform the way food is produced. As a commercial fisherman, Bren’s career was nearly wrecked by the crashing cod stocks in the North Atlantic; he then turned to oyster farming, just in time for catastrophic, climate-driven storms to show him there wasn’t a solid future in that, either. Unwilling to tether himself to land, he took the hard lessons learned and returned to the sea with a new method of restorative ocean farming. What he discovered is a way to produce large quantities of nutritious food that also fights the climate crisis, cleans the ocean, creates aquatic habitat and sustains his sea-going way of life.\n\nThe Island Naturalist\n\nThe Island Naturalist is a film which explores a conservation photographer’s unique relationship with nature, revealing hidden stories on the Caribbean islands. For most of us, the Caribbean is a vacation spot known for its white sand beaches and azure-colored waters, but for Eladio Fernandez, islands are hots spots for biodiversity and a lot of it remains undocumented. These islands, and the natural wealth they hold, are in a race against time. Overpopulation, deforestation, mining, poverty and corrupt governments threaten with extinction many of the same species that this island naturalist is fighting to preserve.\n\nObsessed by his quest to document and save nature, Eladio takes us on a tour of one of the most important humpback whale calving-grounds, the discovery of a new pornographic flower, the conservation of a critically endangered bird, and the re-discovery a long-lost Magnolia in Haiti.\n\nPantanal - A Charred Wetland\n\nLocated in the heart of Brazil, the Pantanal is a tropical wetland packed with the most remarkable wildlife. It has a global importance due to its characteristic water cycle and annual floods, which are essential to maintain a huge diversity of unique species. However, due to human actions, the floods are now becoming smaller and rivers are drying out, which is causing severe droughts. The consequences of this became evident in 2020, when huge wildfires destroyed over a quarter of this biome, killing millions of animals along the way. Two brave locals – Eduarda and Jorge – decided to give their all to rescue and save the lives of severely injured animals along the way.\n\nShawnee Showdown: Keep the Forest Standing\n\nDuring the late 1980s and 1990s, a small, dedicated group of activists fought on the ground and in the courts to stop clear-cutting, oil and gas drilling, and ATV use in the Shawnee National Forest located in Southern Illinois. They won the support of their community and the struggle in a landmark court case. Seventeen years later, the court lifted the injunction, and the Forest Service resumed logging.\n\nShawnee Showdown: Keep the Forest Standing portrays the struggle to protect the forest through interviews, photographs, and news footage. The film examines the ways the past struggle can serve to inform the public and activists today in responding to current Forest Service management projects.\n\nRebirth of a Reef\n\nThe rocky reefs that are home to countless species of fish and invertebrates and support the giant kelp forests of the Palos Verdes Peninsula (California) are under threat. They’ve historically been ravaged by landslides, burying the rocky structure and killing plant and animal life on the reefs. Fortunately, there’s a team of scientists at the Vantuna Research Group and NOAA who are working to bring these beautiful reefs back to Palos Verdes. Join us as we watch the team put their decades of research to use, creating a new system of reefs and restoring the underwater world of Palos Verdes.\n\nWastewater: A Tale of Two Cities\n\nThe other tale of two cities - both plagued by decades of lack of investment and racial discrimination in their wastewater infrastructure and facing further challenges amidst climate change - told by community members, advocates, utility operators, and elected officials. As the nation grapples with how to fund long overdue infrastructure needs, this film brings to light the need for urgency and equity in these decisions.\n\nFinding Palemahan\n\nFinding Palemahan tells the story of Darmawan, a Balinese man who found a solution to plastic pollution by uniting his community behind an ancient philosophy: Tri Hita Karana. While the Balinese traditional practices cultivate a harmonious relationship with nature, modern development has brought a new material - plastic. In rural areas, plastic continues to be burned and thrown into the ocean. Darmawan intends to preserve the cultural value of living in harmony in the wake of waste.\n\nAntonese\n\nAs a waitress at a local tourist resort on Cat Island, Antonese Anthon tells guests every day how to access a nearby beach that is one of the most beautiful in all The Bahamas. Yet, she has never been herself. This is not an uncommon scenario for many Bahamians—that a history of colonialism, servitude, and the transatlantic slave trade has created barriers to their most accessible resource, the ocean. With the support of Young Marine Explorers, a Bahamian-led nonprofit working to ensure that all members of the community have the tools needed to protect the ocean, Antonese embarks on a transformational journey into her past and into the water.\n\nSarah Galloway and Dave Comins\n\nWILD in the Garden State\n\nSarah and her husband Dave move from an apartment in New York City to a house in New Jersey complete with a white picket fence and a 130-foot span of lawn. From her work as a video producer for the American Museum of Natural History in New York, Sarah is familiar with the environmental threats from typical lawn care services. Dave is an Architect and hopes to transform their lawn into a beautiful, park-like space.\n\nThe city transplants both want a beautiful, eco-friendly garden, but have little gardening experience. To get started they mail-order a pre-planned, native pollinator garden. When a monarch finds the new native plant bed it feels like a miracle. Encouraged, the couple continue to transform their lawn into a beautiful, life-sustaining habitat.\n\nScott Morris\n\nAmerican River\n\nScott Morris is an accomplished independent filmmaker with more than 40 years of experience producing, directing and editing documentaries in the New York/New Jersey area. His work includes award-winning one-hour films including SAVING THE GREAT SWAMP: BATTLE TO DEFEAT THE JETPORT currently distributed by American Public Television, and FROM THE ASHES: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF TICK HALL featuring talk-show host Dick Cavett and premiering at the 2001 Hamptons Film Festival.\n\nScott’s early career includes exploration of many genres including animation and dramatic short subjects. In the 1970s, he received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and New York State Council on the Arts to produce a series of films about New York City street festivals broadcast on HBO and shown at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nAs a film editor, Scott cut an Academy Award-winning short and Emmy award-winning long-form documentaries for Discovery, PBS and network television. Throughout his career, he produced dozens of films for non-profit organizations and corporations while raising a family in New York and New Jersey.\n\nFábio Nascimento and Ingrid Fadnes\n\nMATA\n\nFábio Nascimento is a documentary photographer and filmmaker who has worked for National Geographic, Greenpeace, Doctors without Borders, The New York Times, producing stories about people, nature and science. Brazilian, where he studied journalism, and subsequently film theory at the Sorbonne Nouvelle, and a Master degree in documentary film at Paris VIII, France. In addition to directing documentaries, he is also a photographer and editor, has also a background in music and, as a result, composes the soundtracks for many of his films. In recent years, he has divided his time between projects ranging from tropical forests to the poles, working on all continents and embarking on ships across the globe.\n\nIngrid Fadnes is a journalist and researcher. For more than a decade she worked in between Central America and Brazil with social and political issues related to indigenous and rural movements. She is a radio documentarist and MATA is her first film.\n\nEladio Fernandez\n\nThe Island Naturalist\n\nEladio is a naturalist, a conservation photographer, a documentary filmmaker, and a scientific researcher based in the Dominican Republic with a specialty in Caribbean subjects, both land and underwater. Eladio considers his camera is a tool for science and conservation.\n\nHe has one of the most extensive image banks on the landscapes, flora and fauna of the Greater Antilles.
