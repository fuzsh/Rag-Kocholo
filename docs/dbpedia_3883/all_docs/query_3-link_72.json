        "text": "I have a tendency, like many people, I'm sure, when watching shark movies to start rooting for the shark (What can I say? I’m a misanthropist!) but in The Reef: Stalked the shark is barely threatening enough, barely even present enough to worth rooting for. What gives?\n\nNot only that, but when he does show up, he’s a total incompetent! Upon one of his few chomping attempts upon the girls in the film, he fully forgets how to shark and just whacks one of them on the head. I don’t get you, shark. What’s your end game here? You’re going to eat some boats and then just dick around for an hour?\n\nShark Fact: Sharks can swim at upwards of 200mph\n\nNic and her sister Cath are avid kayakers but after one water session with their two friends, Cath is brutally murdered by her boyfriend and Nic has to find a way to cope. Oh, Nic also has another sister called Annie but she’s just… not as important or something. Returning to a pacific island for the nine month anniversary of Cath’s death, the four girls - Nic, Annie and the two friends - head back out into the ocean on their kayaks to do some snorkelling and spear fishing. To get over it or something. But a certain marine predator has moved into the area and he’s not too happy with these girls spiking all his fish up. No sir. It’s sharkin’ time.\n\nAside from being a bit of a rubbish tooth-fish and actually not being that big for a scary shark, the shark is sort of a bro. He doesn’t seem to mind when they switch him out for some post-production trickery and I think he’s also pretty on board with the dodgy compositing of him just swimming around and having a great time in a scene where there is also a boat. He’s just kinda chilled most of the time. Normalise sharks just being cool dudes who mind their own business. I bet he’d be great in like an indie shark slacker comedy. Frustratingly for him, I can’t find him listed on IMDb anywhere so I have no idea how he expects to get any more work after this.\n\nShark Fact: Sharks can live for up to 50 years out of the water\n\nThere’s nothing especially wrong with a low budget shark movie using its antagonist sparingly. But the duff move made by The Reef: Stalked is that it thinks it can pull off some sort of PTSD / domestic abuse / sisterly reconciliation plot while we’re waiting. But when the dialogue isn’t awkwardly stilted, it’s unbearably soapy trading in low-effort bickering and “what about me?” histrionics. Even more jarring is the framing of every tragedy in the film as something bad happening to Nic. She saw her sister’s body! How awful! Well, not quite as awful as being drowned by your boyfriend? Oh no, but it is because now she’s having flashbacks of being drowned, an event that didn’t happen to her and that she wasn’t present for. And what about her other sister? Oh, she’s in the film also.\n\nShark Fact: Sharks have a great union\n\nWhat’s admirable about this particular low budget shark movie is that writer and director Andrew Traucki, (he of animal attack movies The Reef, The Jungle and Black Water) has some good ideas on how to build tension. His confidence to let the sound almost completely lapse for extended periods, leaving the audience with just the sound of the water hitting a kayak, demonstrate that there’s probably a decent level of competent filmmaking going on in between the soapy dialogue and clumsy handling of domestic abuse. But by the same token, to say that the good bits of your shark attack movie, the best bits, are where nothing is happening, no-one is speaking, the camera isn’t moving and the shark is entirely absent is maybe not such a ringing endorsement.\n\nWhen shark events finally do take place there is a certain annoying repetitiveness to them. It fails to eat a girl. Twice. It fails to get caught in a trap. Twice. It eats a boat instead of a person (typical shark behaviour). Twice. A jump scare orchestral sting accompanies absolutely nothing happening. Twice. In a row. Not even its more ridiculous moments are really stupid enough to relieve the monotony of the proceedings.\n\nShark Fact: The Reef: Stalked is a sincere but not particularly good shark movie.\n\nThe Reef: Stalked is available to buy digitally on most platforms"
