        "text": "Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was born in Germany and became an American citizen in 1940. A world-famous theoretical physicist, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics and is renowned for his Theory of Relativity. In addition to his scientific work, Einstein was an influential humanist who spoke widely about politics, ethics, and social causes. After leaving Europe, Einstein taught at Princeton University. His theories were instrumental in shaping the atomic age.\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nGoto page: 1 2 3\n\nA happy man is too satisfied with the present to dwell too much on the future.\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nA man must learn to understand the motives of human beings, their illusions, and their sufferings.\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nA person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nAll of science is nothing more than the refinement of everyday thinking.\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nAnyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nCoincidence is God’s way of remaining anonymous.\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nCuriosity is a delicate little plant which, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom.\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nEverything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nFalling in love is not at all the most stupid thing that people do – but gravity cannot be held responsible for it.\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nFeeling and longing are the motive forces behind all human endeavour and human creations.\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nFew are those who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts.\n\n— Albert Einstein\n\nGood acts are like good poems.
