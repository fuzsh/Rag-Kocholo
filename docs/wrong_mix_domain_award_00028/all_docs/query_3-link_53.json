        "text": "Reference to the Goldener Adler\n\nAlbert Camus undertook an extended kayak tour through Austria, the Czech Republic and Silesia in the summer of 1936 with an acquaintance from the theater, the English teacher Yves Bourgeois and his wife Simone.\n\nIn Marseille they sent the kayaks ahead to Innsbruck and went themselves to Lyon, Zurich and through the Arlberg tunnel to Innertirol, where they arrived on July 16, 1936.\n\nThey were guests at the Goldener Adler for 3 days.\n\nCamus is impressed: “The country is magnificent – of wild gentleness – with beautiful evenings.”\n\nOn July 19, they launched their kayaks at the Mühlau Bridge and continued their journey on the Inn River. It rained most of the time and completely exhausted they reached Kufstein 3 days later, Camus records a diary impression:\n\n“Kufstein – the chapel and along the Inn the fields in the rain. Condensing loneliness.”\n\nMore than worth a diary impression is our excursion tip for you!\n\nVisit the town of Kufstein, the second largest in Tyrol, about 50 minutes from\n\nInnsbruck, on the border with Bavaria.\n\nThe area around Kufstein has been settled for about 30,000 years, probably the oldest settled area in Tyrol, as evidenced by finds of bony arrowheads of Ice Age hunters in the Tischofer Cave in the Kaisertal.\n\nAn ideal starting point for countless hiking opportunities in the Kaisergebirge, pure skiing pleasure, the nearby Walchsee offers refreshment in summer.\n\nThe most important landmark is the fortress Kufstein on the 90-meter-high fortress mountain in the centre of the city, which was first mentioned in the 13th century.\n\nThe fortress is home to a local history museum as well as the largest open-air organ in the world, the Heldenorgel, which can be heard throughout the city.\n\nMany famous personalities are and were at home in Kufstein, such as the inventor of the sewing machine Joseph Madersperger, the writer Adolf Pichler, the entrepreneur, and glass designer Claus Josef Riedel, as well as the two successful racing drivers Karl Wendlinger and his late father Karl Wendlinger senior.\n\nLife and facts\n\nThe writer and philosopher Albert Camus was born on November 7, 1913, in Dréan, Algeria, the son of a local family with French and Spanish roots.\n\nSince his father died just one year later in a military hospital in France during the First World War, Albert grew up with his mother, along with his older brother Lucien.\n\nThe talented young man graduated from high school in 1932 and began studying philosophy at the new University of Algiers that same year.\n\nDespite joining the country’s bourgeois elite, he increasingly championed the rights of the oppressed, in this case the country’s Arab population.\n\nIt was during this period, the 1930s, that he not only met his first wife, Simone Hié, but also began his first literary works.\n\nAmong his most famous works, besides “The Plague” and “Man in Revolt”, is “The Myth of Sisyphus”.\n\nAfter receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature for his complete works three years before his death, Camus died in a car accident on January 4, 1960 – absurdly, he had allowed himself to be persuaded to make the trip, although he had already bought a train ticket.\n\nCamus is considered one of the best-known and most important French authors of the 20th century."
