        "text": "*The Nobel Prize and its awards to Africans and African Americans are a topic on this date's Registry.\n\nThe Nobel is granted annually to persons or institutions for outstanding contributions made during the previous year in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, international peace, and economic sciences.\n\nGenerally considered a most prestigious award, Nobel Prizes come from a trust fund established by Swedish chemist, inventor, and philanthropist Alfred Bernhard Nobel. As designated in Nobel's will, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards prizes for physics and chemistry; the Nobel Assembly awards prizes for physiological or medical works; the Swedish Academy awards prizes for literature; and the Norwegian Nobel Committee selects the winner of the peace prize. In 1968 a new prize for economics was established and endowed by the national bank of Sweden.\n\nThe first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901; it was not until 1950 that a Black person was a recipient. An African American from Detroit, Dr. Ralph J. Bunche was the first Black man to receive the distinguished prize for his work as a United Nations mediator; his efforts led to the 1949 Arab-Israeli armistice agreement."
