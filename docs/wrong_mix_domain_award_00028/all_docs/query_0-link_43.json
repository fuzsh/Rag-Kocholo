        "text": "In 2001, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Nobel Prize, Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, commissioned American composer Steve Heitzeg to write a “Nobel Symphony.”\n\nIn 1866, the Swedish engineer and scientist Alfred Nobel had invented dynamite. His patent helped him amass a great fortune, but, troubled by the destructive power and potential misuse of his invention, Nobel arranged that his estate would award annual prizes to those who made significant contributions to world peace.\n\nFor his “Nobel Symphony,” Heitzeg chose to set quotes from a variety of Nobel laureates , including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Elie Wiesel, Martin Luther King, Jr, and the Dalai Lama. Purely instrumental effects were also employed to convey something of their ideas and ideals. For example, in a section honoring a 1997 winner of the Nobel Prize, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, Heitzeg scored an eerie march for a percussion ensemble consisting of hollow artificial limbs.\n\nThe October 2, 2001 premiere of Steve Heitzeg’s “Nobel Symphony” came shortly after the tragic events of September 11th. Understandably, its message had a special resonance for the performers and audiences present at its first performance.\n\nComposer Steven Heitzeg is a very modest man. Ask him about his sprawling, multi-layered Nobel Symphony, and he gives a nutshell description. “The piece’s intent is to honor all of the six disciplines or prizes of the Nobel Foundation, and at the same time is, in essence, a symphony for peace and justice,” Heitzeg says. That only begins to describe the Nobel Symphony’s ambition and complexity. It’s approximately 75-minutes long. There’s a movement for every Nobel Prize, from Peace, Literature, and Physics, to Chemistry, Medicine and Economics. It requires a full orchestra, a chorus, a children’s choir and several soloists. – Chris Roberts, Minnesota Public Radio\n\nAs my sister and I prowled through Minneapolis’ Orchestra Hall lobby before the afternoon got underway, we found ourselves in front of a large photographic grid about eight feet square, with 128 small wooden blocks, each corresponding to a measure in the Peace section of Steve Heitzeg’s impressive Nobel Symphony. The audience was invited to pick up and place these at random on the display, and then the resulting pattern would be used to order the sequence of visuals in the work. – Bruce Hodges, MusicWeb International"
