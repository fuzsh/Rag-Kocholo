        "text": "Study area and field work\n\nData were collected in the Reserva Biológica San Francisco (RBSF), a privately owned nature reserve adjacent to Podocarpus National Park (since 2007 part of the UNESCO biosphere reserve “Podocarpus-El Condor”) in southern Ecuador (province Zamora-Chinchipe). The study area, located on the eastern slope of the Andes, has been the target of intensive ecological research since 1997 (Beck et al. 2008a). Caterpillar samples were taken at an elevation ranging from 1800–2800m above sea level. However, the majority of the data was collected at an elevation of 1800–2100m, in close proximity to the Estación Científica San Francisco (3°58′ S, 79°05′ W), during the period from February 1 to May 28, 2006.\n\nRBSF is covered by nearly pristine montane rain forest (Beck et al. 2008b; Homeier et al. 2008). Its moth fauna has been studied intensively (1999–2006) by light-trapping, offering insight into patterns of moth diversity and community structure (e.g.: Brehm et al. 2003; Fiedler et. al. 2008; Hilt and Fiedler 2008).\n\nCaterpillars were collected by visually scanning vegetation during the day and by searching with lights during the night, as well as by common plant-beating techniques (e.g. Schauff 1986; Leather 2005). Caterpillars were transferred to the laboratory and kept in plastic boxes. These were lined with damp paper towel to maintain high humidity. Caterpillars were fed with their appropriate host plant until pupation. Old food plant material was replaced every 2–3 days. Pupae were kept in similar plastic boxes until adult emergence.\n\nOne species, Pantherodes conglomerata, was reared from eggs obtained from a light-caught adult female. In this case, several plants were experimentally offered to find a suitable host plant.\n\nRemarks on host plant affiliations\n\nTwo thirds of the moth species covered in this study were encountered only once, therefore those host plant affiliations must be interpreted with care. It may sometimes occur that a species is found and successfully reared on a plant, which is not part of its natural host plant range. On the other hand, even single records may provide important insight into patterns of host use if they can be placed in a comparative context.\n\nIn our study, a high number of species use host plants or food sources that are considered unusual for Geometridae (and for macromoths in general), such as ferns (e.g. Hendrix 1980; Lawton 1982; Weintraub et al. 1995) and lichens (e.g. Lawrey 1987; Hesbacher et al. 1995). Of the 59 species treated in this study, six (10%) were recorded from bracken fern (Mesedra sp. [180, see ], Eupithecia lachaumei, Eupithecia sp. [2170], Psaliodes inundulata, Isochromodes brumosa, Isochromodes sp. [106]). Isochromodes brumosa feeds on umbrella fern (genus Sticherus, Gleicheniaceae) in addition to bracken fern.\n\nFern feeding in the Geometridae is confined to a few isolated specialists or to small subclades (e.g. Ennominae-Lithinini: Holloway 1987; Weintraub et al. 1995), although polyphagous feeders of spermatophytes occasionally accept ferns as minor hosts (Hendrix 1980; Robinson et al. 2009). While Hendrix (1980) described ferns as generally underutilized, Lawton (1982) pointed out that bracken fern does support a sizable fauna of herbivores, at least in parts of its distribution. Three geometrid species (5%) were recorded on lichens (Sabulodes sp. nr. carbina, Perusia sp. nr. nigriceps, Nematocampa sp. nr. falsa).\n\nThe species-rich genus Eois (Geometridae: Larentiinae) is of particular interest for questions regarding host plant specialization. Eois species are hypothesized to specialize on Piper (Piperacee) throughout the Neotropics (e.g. Dyer and Palmer 2004). In our study, caterpillars of four Eois species were reared to adults and caterpillars of two more were identified by DNA barcodes. All were found exclusively on Piper. Each Eois was encountered only on a single species of Piper, and only E. sp. nr. odatis and E. tegularia shared the same host plant.\n\nEois olivacea feeds on two different hostplants in northeastern Ecuador (Dyer et al. 2009): Piper baezanum, which appears very similar to the host plant recorded in our study and Piper longifolium. However, different caterpillar color morphs are consistent in feeding each Piper, suggesting that ‘Eois olivacea' might comprise more than one species (G. Rodríguez and L. Dyer, personal communication). This is supported by DNA barcoding results and phylogenetic analysis using a combination of nuclear and mitochondrial genes (Strutzenberger 2010) as well as by caterpillar records from our study site (F. Bodner, unpublished data).\n\nObservations on morphology and Behavior\n\nIn general, geometrid caterpillars are cryptic in appearance, with brown, green and grey tones predominating. Some resemble twigs (e.g.: Pero maculicosta, ), lichens (e.g.: Oenoptila sp. cf. nigriceps, ; Nematocampa sp. nr. falsa, ), or mossy bark (e.g. Phyllodonta semicava, ; Cargolia arana, ), while others seem to be inconspicuously coloured to the human eye. Whether their crypsis pertains to particular predators, such as visually hunting birds, requires further assessment (Church et al. 1998). An account of notable observations on certain species is given below.\n\nThe two specimens of Iridopsis sp. nr. subnigrata differ strongly in colouration ( ) remarkably matching that of their respective host plants. Callipseustes sp. [2169] ( ) shows bright red colouration making it conspicuous against the green leaves of its host plant (Boehmeria species, family Urticaceae), but matching the red twigs.\n\nThe caterpillars of Mychonia violacea ( ) and Mychonia corticinaria ( ) show similar colouration, but differ in the number and shape of their dorsal protuberances. However, adult wing pattern and colouration in both specimens ( and ) is similar. Further morphological studies are required in this species complex.\n\nCaterpillars of Ischnopteris brehmi ( ) have lateral bulges at at the 2nd abdominal segment. Pupae of I. brehmi (pupae not shown) and Rucana bisecta ( ) have the antenna and trunk sheaths extended to a spike that reaches down to about half of the free moving portion of the abdomen. In the third reared Nacophorini, Cargolia arana ( ), the antenna and trunk sheaths extended only beyond the wing sheaths. This feature was not mentioned by Rindge (1983) in his revision of the Nacophorini or by Pitkin (2002, 2005), but may be a synapomorphy for the tribe. On the other hand, Parra and Henriquez-Rodriguez (1993) showed the pupae of two Nacophorini (Mallomus falcatus and M. tumidus) that lacked this feature, possibly suggesting that this character state is restricted to a smaller clade within the Nacophorini.\n\nFive species that, according to their adult morphology, belong in the genus Isochromodes, showed divergent caterpillar morphology. Caterpillars of I. duplicata ( ) have two black bulges on the 5th abdominal segment that were present in all instars. The caterpillar of I. polvoreata ( ) has the third thoracic leg elevated on an enlarged basis and a dorsal and lateral protuberance on the rd abdominal segment. Together these made the caterpillar resemble a dead twig with two leaf scars. Caterpillars of Isochromodes sp. [106] ( ) and I. fraterna ( ) varied in a similar range of green and brown colours with or without white and brown dorsal markings. No clear diagnostic characters could be identified.\n\nThe caterpillar of Perusia praecisaria ( ) shows two thin elongated dorsal protuberances: a long one forking into two points, and a shorter one on the 2nd and 3rd abdominal segments, respectively. The caterpillar is similar to that of Melinodes subapicata (see Brehm 2003). Perusia and Melinodes are currently placed in different tribes (Ourapterygini and Cratoptera-group, respectively, Pitkin 2002). The striking similarity between Perusia praecisaria and Melinodes subapicata caterpillars instead suggests a close relationship between these species. Further studies in both genera as well as in related taxa are required to resolve the relationships between the Ourapterygini and the Cratoptera-group.\n\nThe Microxydia colorata caterpillar was of pronouncedly different appearance than those of Microxydia sp. nr. Ruficomma. On adult morphology, Pitkin (2002) stated that “M. colorata has a more complex wing pattern unlike that of other Microxydia species.” Taken the differences of adult and larval morphology into accout, we suggest that M. colorata is misplaced within this genus. Further morphological studies are required.\n\nThe caterpillar of Prochoerodes pilosa ( ) displayed a behaviour of pulling the first three segments together to form a uniform knob with the head and thoracic legs ( top). The caterpillar thus mimicked a dead twig or leaf stalk. Sabulodes bolivaria ( ) was found in two individuals. One ( ), found as an early instar, developed a rather intensive, dark colouration. The other caterpillar ( ), found in its last instar, had a pale colouration with some parts of the pattern completely missing. Both caterpillars preferred to hide within a leaf-tent, as mentioned by Brehm (2003) for this genus.\n\nTwo Cyclophora species (C. costinotata, and C. viator, ) were reared. In both, the anteriorly truncated pupae bear a silk girdle around the 3rd abdominal segment ( ). This trait is supposedly apomorphic for the genus Cyclophora and some, possibly all, other genera in the tribe Cosymbiini (Holloway 1997; Sihvonen and Kaila 2004).\n\nMost Eois caterpillars show some shade of green and have black, sometimes also white markings ( ). The amount of these markings generally increased with development, but was also variable between individuals within the species Eois encina ( ) and Eois sp. nr. encina ( ). Images of several Eois species shown by Dyer and Gentry (2009), Dyer at al. (2009) and Janzen and Hallwachs (2009) provide further examples of pronounced intraspecific variation.\n\nThe status of Eupithecia lachaumei is uncertain, where pronounced variation in caterpillar coloration ( ) is paralleled by subtle differences in wing pattern ( ), possibly pointing to the existence of a species complex. Most caterpillars of Psaliodes inundulata are green ( ), but a few showed diffuse dark patterns making them almost black ( ).\n\nSpargania narangilla ( ) displayed interesting pupation behaviour; caterpillars build their cocoon in a hole in the leaf and covered it with chewed bits of leaf (data not shown). This gave the impression of a dead leaf area, rather than a cocoon.\n\nIn general, the geometrid larvae we studied are ectophagous, except that caterpillars of Eupithecia sobria feed inside the flowers of their host plant in the early stages ( left). Later instars ( right) feed partially exposed on the flowers and fruits."
