        "meta_description": "Ennominae is the largest subfamily of the geometer moth family (Geometridae) with some 9,700 described species in 1,100 genera. They are usually a fairly small moth species, though some (such as the Peppered Moth) grow to be considerably large. This subfamily has a global distribution. It includes some species that are notorious defoliating pests. (Source: Wikipedia, '', http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennominae, CC BY-SA 3.0 . Photo: (c) Roger C. Kendrick, all rights reserved)",
