        "text": "I saw him in '86 when he was \"the P\" in ELP...it was starling to hear old material with Cozy on drums...\"Lucky Man\" comes to mind...NO FILLS...just a groove.\n\nThe music in general was a lot more solid...\n\nI've always loved his playing, particularly those two Jeff Beck albums. Play along sometime. You'll get a whole new appreciation for his grooves. He tended to open and close his hats in unusual places, which lent to his unique groove.\n\nThoughts on Cozy Powell?\n\nGot to meet him twice. He was fantastic. Even remembered the first time we had met.\n\nFun facts:\n\nHe played rimshots most of time, including his toms.\n\nOnly drummer considered to replace Bonham, stuck around enough to play on Plant solo album.\n\nAlmost never rode on a tour bus, would drive or ride a motorcycle between gigs (very fast).\n\nCouldn’t read music and didn’t know any rudiments, but performed them quite well.\n\nGot to meet him twice.
