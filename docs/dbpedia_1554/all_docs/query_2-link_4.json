        "text": "Just wanted to comment a little on this CD. Finally got a copy of this and I was very satisfied. This is a compilation of his three late 70s and early 80s albums Over the Top, Tilt and Octopuss. I had only heard the Over the Top material before and the other albums seem to be very similar. For those who don't know these are all instrumental tracks with a whole bunch of excellent guest stars including Don Airey, Jack Bruce, Jeff Beck, Gary Moore and Jon Lord. Mostly fusion type music with touches of hard rock, blues and classical. If you like Jeff Beck's Blow by Blow, I think you would enjoy this album."
