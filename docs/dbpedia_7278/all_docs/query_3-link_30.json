After witnessing a life-changing concert by a band known as the Sex Pistols, he persuades his station to televise one of their performances, and soon Manchester's punk groups are clamoring for him to manage them. Riding the wave of a musical revolution, Wilson and his friends create the legendary Factory Records label and The Hacienda club.",

        "text": "Insanely bad vibes. But the vibes keep getting worse and worse until suddenly you’re listening to the Happy Mondays, the worst that vibes can scientifically get. And then you’re free. A million cute little filmmaking tricks (the film stock shifting to suit the era, the gimmicky cameos, the asides, the Happy Mondays eating KFC to imply heroin use, etc.) but they work because this movie couldn’t care less about impressing you. Its only goal seems to be to see how far along it can take you. And it turns out it can take me the whole way. I would call this movie a blast even though huge stretches of it are bleak as hell.\n\nLots of stand out scenes but…\n\nTony Wilson passed away eight years ago today.\n\nI watch a lot of films about scenes and occurrences and movements where I feel out of the loop, like I'm missing something by not having been around it myself or in the vicinity, and envying those who write about being there and experiencing it.\n\nWhen 24 Hour Party People was released in 2002, it finally felt like a film where I wouldn't be feeling that envy. To radically paraphrase a chap who Wilson regretted not signing, it was a film that could say something to me about my life. And it did. It was about the music that played throughout my teenage years, the music and cultural scene that was exploding…\n\nAlthough I'm not a Manchester native (though I do live a good 30 or so miles away), I've always been somewhat fascinated by the city's musical history, so naturally I approached 24 Hour Party People with interest. Biopics generally don’t appeal to me that much, but I’d have to say that this one delivers in more ways I’d want.\n\nTaking place from the mid 70s to the early 90s, 24 Hour Party People documents the career of Tony Wilson, as he transitions from a television presenter for Granada TV into the manager of Factory Records, which was home to some of the UK's biggest musical acts around the time. As well as a general focus on the musical culture of…\n\nI'm so used to Coogan's fourth-wall breaks that at first I was a bit irritated with 24HPP, but gradually it dawned on me that Tony Wilson, the more benign, experimental Malcolm McLaren (an appropriately post-punk version of the same Svengali type, if you will), would absolutely make himself the ringleader for his own story. (24HPP, like posters and nightclubs, has a Factory archive number, as if it were another single.) Winterbottom and Coogan print the legend, as they openly reference, yet they also frequently break to clarify more pedestrian truths, and to make reference to that which was elided for dramatic flow. It's a fitting juxtaposition for a label that never knew success without failure being right there; they scored…\n\nYou can say what you want about music from around the world, but nothing will touch the British as the greatest exponents of popular music. We've given the world The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Smiths, The Cure, Joy Division, and The Police to name but a few. Maybe it's the working class backgrounds or the fact we just have some talented poets and misanthropes among us, who knows, we just seem to produce them in abundance. People take chances, some people see something special in an artist and strive to make the most of that spark of imagination and creativity. 24 Hour Party People focuses on a maverick who stuck out his neck in support of some fledgling Northern…\n\nAn inebriating odyssey of drink, drugs and cultural evolution, charting the dizzying heyday of Manchester with pinpoint accuracy. All biopics rely on embellishment, but it’s still overwhelming how perfectly this captures the psychedelic era’s transformation from rock & roll to dance. David Bowie, The Sex Pistols, The Clash, Joy Division. The 70s are replaced by the 80s, and so the musicians are replaced by the DJs. By the time we’re rolling with Happy Mondays, it’s hard to tell what’s up or down. One could argue Robby Müller’s video photography is somewhat distracting at first, but by the end it all makes sense. Michael Winterbottom and Steve Coogan always had me with The Trip, but this is a different kind of trip…"
