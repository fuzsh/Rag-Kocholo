        "text": "Shirley Henderson has been most widely-seen as Moaning Myrtle in the Harry Potter films- 2002's \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" and 2005's \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\" Henderson's tiny frame and raspy voice have led to her frequent casting as introverted eccentrics. Born in Forres and raised in the working class town of Kincardine, Hendeson enjoyed singing, performing on the high school stage and in small, local clubs. At 17 she moved to London and attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Upon graduation in 1986, she began to perform extensively on the stage, including the National Theatre, as well as occasionally working in British television. In 1995, she landed her first major TV role, in the detective series \"Hamish MacBeth.\" MacBeth was played by Robert Carlyle, an actor Henderson worked with again in 1996's \"Trainspotting\" and 2002's \"Once Upon a Time in the Midlands.\" In 1999, Henderson got to showcase her singing talents in Mike Leigh's Gilbert and Sullivan tale, \"Topsy-Turvy,\" and the same year she made \"Wonderland\" with director Michael Winterbottom. Henderson became a regular in Winterbottom's films, appearing in 2000's \"The Claim,\" 2002's\"24-Hour Party People,\" and 2005's \"Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story.\" Henderson has also found parts in two adaptations of popular British novels; she plays Jude in 2001's \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" and its 1999 sequel."
