Director Michael Winterbottom chronicles Factory Records through the decline and fall of its musical empire, from “God Save the Queen” to pills ‘n’ thrills, 24 HOUR PARTY is a funny, cheeky, smart-arsed look at the self-made legends, bullshit artists, and relics of a bygone era, celebrating its 20th Anniversary. Screening in 35mm."
