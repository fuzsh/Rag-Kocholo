        "text": "Hail, hail, the rock’n’roll biopic. A 21-gun salute for that most derided of cinematic genres. With a strike rate of about one in 100, it’s one of life’s mysteries as to why anyone would gamble their house, the shirt on their back and their children on fronting up the megabucks it costs to make one of the damn things. I mean, you’d really have to like Queen a bit too much to stump up for the horror that is Bohemian Rhapsody. All this I ponder as I watch the first episode of Danny Boyle’s disastrous TV-cation of Steve Jones’ Pistol memoir.\n\nHere come the posh actor kids with double-barrelled names, far too corn-fed and gym-friendly to believably mimic 70s herberts Cook and Jones. Here’s a non-threatening Johnny Rotten. Here’s a nice young woman playing Nancy, wondering exactly what this is a stepping-stone (no pun) towards. And worst of all, here are the 1976 mohicans. As any fool apart from Danny Boyle knows, the mohawk atop an English punk rocker was not seen until at least 1980.\n\nThe Pistols have had a patchy time at the flicks. Alex Cox’s Sid And Nancy was a noble effort. Gary Oldman made a decent stab (also no pun) at la Vish. Sid, having made himself a mad cartoon character, is one of the few rock stars who can withstand “the actors” doing their “acting thing”. Cox’s valiant attempt was ultimately hobbled by the poor sods who got to play the other Pistols as an anonymous trio of portly boneheads.\n\nHow well rock stars can come out of the biopic depends on how well they were known to the public. In this respect The Beatles never stood a chance, but Backbeat is one of the better Fabs pics. Stephen Dorff manages a convincing Stu Sutcliffe simply because the viewer has nothing to not be convinced of, just a few moody pictures of poor old Stu. The ‘other’ Beatles fare less well, as ever. Perhaps most amusing of all Beatles movies is Two Of Us (2000), based on the time that Paul visited John at The Dakota and they didn’t go on Saturday Night Live. The script is pretty good. But Paul is played as Dirk McQuickly from The Rutles’ All You Need Is Cash, and then there is John’s accent of no fixed abode. Will he be from Birkenhead, will he be from Dublin? And who could have directed this farrago? Step forward, Michael Linsday-Hogg.\n\nAnton Corbijn, one would assume, would be a safe pair of hands for the Joy Division story, Control. All is not going too badly (in the usual tailwind of the rock biopic) until it dawns on the viewer that Corbijn seems to have cast Gareth Gates (one time high-flyer of Pop Idol and brief suitor of Katie Price) to play Ian Curtis.\n\nCurtis fares a little better in Michael Winterbottom’s 24 Hour Party People when portrayed by Sean Harris as a feral Manc skip rat. There are many decent performances in 24 Hour Party People: Paddy Considine as Joy Division manager Rob Gretton, Steve Coogan as Tony Wilson, and Andy Serkis as a grizzly Martin Hannett. Sadly, all this strong work is undone by one casting decision: “Ladies and gentlemen, on tonight’s Stars In Your Eyes, Ralf Little is Peter Hook.”\n\nOne good way to swerve the casting dilemma of the rock biopic is to throw a curveball at the casting: take a bow, Cate Blanchett, playing Bob Dylan in Todd Haynes’ I’m Not There (2007). Haynes had form for this, bypassing the need for actors and replacing them with (ho-ho) Barbie dolls for his 1987 paean to Karen Carpenter, Superstar.\n\nIn recent years the pop bio has looked like an endangered species: England Is Mine, a limp mess of young Steven Morrissey’s early days, gained little traction (and starred a pre-fame Jodie Comer). And Stardust was an unfortunate botch-up of the Bowie story without – quelle horreur – any original Dave songs. No wonder it sank to the bottom of the critical and commercial sewer.\n\nThankfully for lovers of the most ill-advised cinematic genre in history, we are living through a golden age. The success of trash such as the aforementioned Bohemian Rhapsody and the heinous Rocketman has blown the doors wide open for the rock biopic. The future may look bleak in reality but one day we may have biopics of GG Allin, The Stranglers, Hasil Adkins, Northside, Menswear, Hawkwind, Saxon, even The Fall (perhaps with a cast made up of hamsters – think Adventures On The Riverbank set in Prestwich).\n\nLet’s just hope that Ralf Little and Michael Lindsay-Hogg are available.\n\nLuke Haines tweets @LukeHaines_News."
