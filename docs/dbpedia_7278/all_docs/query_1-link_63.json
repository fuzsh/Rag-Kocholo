        "text": "ON a bright January morning, five years ago, Andy Serkis was in the kitchen of his east London home anxiously waiting for the telephone to ring. The previous day, the actor auditioned for a part he felt destined to play.\n\nBut the audition had not gone well and Andy was worried he may have lost his chance.\n\nThe plum role he was desperate to perform was one of English literature's greatest villains, a murderous wretch with a psychotic personality. Andy suspected he would miss out on the part and was anticipating a disappointing call from his agent.\n\nHe had auditioned for a new ITV adaptation of the Charles Dickens' classic, Oliver Twist, and gone for the role of Bill Sykes. For Andy, the part would have been perfect, but he was convinced his destiny would be thwarted.\n\nSo he waited, depressed, beside the phone. When his agent rang, it was to give Andy news that would change his life. But his destiny had little to do with Dickens, even though he later learned he would play Bill Sykes, after all.\n\nAndy's agent called to ask him to audition for a part in a new film version of JRR Tolkien's epic trilogy of novels, The Lord Of The Rings.\n\nThe producers wanted an actor to voice the animated character of Gollum, the creature who is transfixed by the power of the Ring and leads the Hobbits to Mordor.\n\nAndy had never read the books and only had a vague recollection of Gollum from reading The Hobbit at school. Initially, he was reluctant, because he thought voicing an animated character was a limiting experience for an actor. But when his Mancunian wife, actress Lorraine Ashbourne, returned home, she encouraged him to go to the audition.\n\nThat day marked the beginning of an extraordinary experience for Andy that continues today, over half a decade on. Since then, The Lord Of The Rings films have become a cultural phenomenon, redefining film-making, amassing millions of fans all over the globe, and sweeping the board at countless award ceremonies.\n\nAnd Andy has been on a personal journey that has seen him dedicate five years of his life to bringing Gollum to the screen. A unique mix of computer graphics and Andy's own physical and vocal performance, Gollum became one of the central characters in the final two films of the trilogy, and one of the most memorable cinematic creations in recent years.\n\nExact\n\n\"In many ways, we have created a new way of acting,\" says Andy. \"It is so different to anything anyone has attempted before. What you see on screen is my performance. The animators copied my exact movements. Every movement, even every eye- flicker, is mine. I totally embodied the role and then the animators recreated that in computer- generated form.\"\n\nTo explain the remarkable technical process behind Gollum, Andy has written a book describing every detail. \"I started writing notes at the beginning of the whole process, because I knew it was going to be such a different acting challenge,\" says Andy.\n\n\"People seem to think that all I did was voice the character, but, actually, it was so much more than that. I completely embodied him. I was on set all the time. I acted every moment and every movement of Gollum,\" he says.\n\nIt was a performance that amazed both critics and fans alike. Gollum is one of the most important characters in the books, and getting him right was the key to the success of the films.\n\n\"I don't think any of us could have predicted how successful the films would become. I think we were aware that we were working on an extraordinary project, but we could not have expected it to be so well received,\" he says.\n\nFilming of the three movies took place successively in New Zealand, home of director Peter Jackson, over a three-year period. But Andy was involved for much longer, because his part required considerable work, even after filming finished. That was mainly because the voice he developed for Gollum had to be added.\n\nThe creature's voice proved particularly memorable for film audiences, with almost every fan attempting to mimic his hushed drawl and the cry of \"precious\".\n\n\"I get a lot of people asking me to do the voice. A lot ask me to record voice messages on their phones. I don't mind, because I'm so pleased people have reacted so well to the character,\" he says in his own soft voice, with its Cockney lilt.\n\n\"I think people really relate to Gollum, which is what you want to achieve as an actor. He really is a complex character, and, ironically, of everyone in the film, he is probably the most human because he works on so many levels,\" says Andy, whose enthusiasm for the whole project has evidently not diminished over time.\n\nAddict\n\n\"What I found fascinating about him is that, in essence, he is an addict. He is addicted to the Ring, and I created the character with that in mind.\"\n\nSo convincing was his portrayal of the tormented Gollum that many people believed Andy should have received an Oscar. But the combination of computer-generated effects and the talent of an ordinary actor clearly confused the Academy.\n\n\"I don't think they knew how to recognise the performance. I believe I was close to getting nominated for the third film, but I'm not disappointed. It created a debate about how to reward the area of acting aided by special effects, and that is a good thing.\n\n\"But loads of people have been coming up to me, saying, 'You were robbed, mate'.\"\n\nBorn in 1964, Andy was brought up in Ruislip, west London. He originally wanted to be a painter, and went to Lancaster University to study art. But he quickly realised acting was what he really wanted to do.\n\nAfter graduation, he established himself at the local theatre and got parts in touring productions.\n\nThen, he began a long and successful relationship with the Royal Exchange in Manchester, which included productions of Macbeth, She Stoops To Conquer, Your Home In The West and Othello. In 1992, he won a Manchester Evening News Theatre Award for best actor in the Bolton Octagon's production of Decadence.\n\nHe went on to work extensively in TV and film, playing Factory Records' producer, Martin Hannett, in the Manchester movie, 24 Hour Party People, which chronicled the rise of the \"Madchester\" scene.\n\nHe met his wife while at the Royal Exchange, and regularly returns to Manchester to visit his in-laws. \"I love the city. It is a second home to me,\" he says. The couple are expecting their third child soon.\n\nFor now, Andy is planning projects and says he would love to reprise the role of Gollum if the much-touted film version of The Hobbit ever materialises. But, for the time being at least, The Lord Of The Rings journey is drawing to an end for Andy."
