He then appeared in films such as Prince of Jutland (1994), Career Girls (1997), Pandaemonium (2000). In 2001, he was cast as the voice of Gollum in Peter Jackson's epic fantasy adventure film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. A role he went on to play in the sequel The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers the following year and becoming one of his most notable roles. He voiced Gollum a third time in the 2002 final film of the trilogy in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and again in the 2012 prequel The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. During that time, he also co-starred in the films The Escapist (2002), 13 Going on 30 (2004) and lent his voice to the 2006 computer-animated film Flushed Away.\n\nIn 2011, he provided the voice and motion capture for Caesar in the science fiction film Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
