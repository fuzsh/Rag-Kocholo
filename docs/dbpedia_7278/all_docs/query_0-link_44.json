He is sent on a journey of the soul – but to guarantee the safety of his – he must also save Scrooge’s.\n\nCharlotte Riley\n\nas Lottie / Ghost of Christmas Present\n\nAs the Ghost of Christmas Present, Lottie will force her elder brother Scrooge to see difficult truths.\n\nJoe Alwyn\n\nas Bob Cratchit\n\nHis loyalty is not rewarded, and yet he persists at Scrooge’s, wryly returning banter with his boss and letting things lie, until the stakes get much, much higher. And he won’t take any more."
