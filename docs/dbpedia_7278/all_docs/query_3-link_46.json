        "text": "Tony Wilson:\n\nFactory Records are not actually a company. We are an experiment in human nature. You're labouring under the misapprehension that we actually have a deal with, er, with our, our bands. That we have any kind of a contract, er, at all, and I'm afraid we, er, we don't because that's, er, that's the sum total of the paperwork to do with Factory Records, deal with, er, their various bands.\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nAnd tonight something equally epoch-making is taking place. See? They're applauding the DJ. Not the music, not the musician, not the creator, but the medium. This is it. The birth of rave culture. The beatification of the beat. The dance age. This is the moment when even the white man starts dancing. Welcome to Manchester.\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nIt was like being on a fantastic fairground ride, centrifugal forces throwing us wider and wider. But it's all right, because there's this brilliant machine at the center that's going to bring us back down to earth. That was Manchester. That is the Hacienda. Now imagine the machine breaks. For a while, it's even better, because you're really flying. but then, you fall, because nobody beats gravity.\n\n[last lines]\n\n[Tony Wilson has just had a vision of God - who looked exactly like Tony Wilson]\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nWell, it's written in the Bible, isn't it? 'God made man in His own image'.\n\nRob Gretton:\n\nYeah, but not a specific man.\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nNo, but if you'd have spoken to Him, He would have looked like you. But you didn't, I did. And he looked like me.\n\nRob Gretton:\n\n[smoking a joint] F***ing top gear, man.\n\nRob Gretton:\n\nYou know your trouble, Tony? You don't know what you are. I f***ing know what you are, but you don't know what you are.\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nWell, my curiosity's got the better of me, Rob, tell me, what am I?\n\nRob Gretton:\n\nYou're a c*nt.\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nWell, you see I knew that, you see, that was something I did know.\n\nBoethius:\n\nIt's my belief that history is a wheel. \"Inconsistency is my very essence\" -says the wheel- \"Rise up on my spokes if you like, but don't complain when you are cast back down into the depths. Good times pass away, but then so do the bad. Mutability is our tragedy, but it is also our hope. The worst of times, like the best, are always passing away\".\n\nTony Wilson:\n\n[First address to camera; after his hang-gliding news report] You're going to see a lot more of that sort of thing in the picture. I don't want to say too much, don't want to spoil it. I'll just say one word: 'Icarus'. If you get it, great. If you don't, that's fine too. But you should probably read more.\n\nIan Curtis:\n\n[shouting across the bar] Wilson, ya f***ing c*nt!\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nThat's original. [to Rob] Your drink's coming. Is he a friend of yours?\n\nRob Gretton:\n\nYeah, he's our singer.\n\nIan Curtis:\n\n[crossing the bar to approach Tony] Out of the way, Steve.\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nHi, Tony Wilson, pleased to meet you. [Ian just glowers at him wordlessly]... Is he gonna hit me? You're quite close to me there.\n\nIan Curtis:\n\nYeah, I know, I wanna be.\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nWhy?\n\nIan Curtis:\n\n'Cos you're a c*nt, mate.\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nI know, I heard you the first time.\n\nIan Curtis:\n\n[listening to their recording of \"She's Lost Control\"] I sound like Bowie.\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nThat's good. You like Bowie.\n\nIan Curtis:\n\n[annoyed] I hate f***in' Bowie! In \"All The Young Dudes\" he sings about how you should die when you're twenty-five. Do you know how old he is? He's thirty, twenty-nine, something. He's a liar.\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nLook, it doesn't matter. A lot of great artists produce their best work when they're... older. You know, W.B. Yeats...\n\nIan Curtis:\n\nI've never heard of him, mate.\n\nTony Wilson:\n\nYeats is the greatest poet since Dante. If he'd have died when he was twenty-five...\n\nIan Curtis:\n\nI would have heard of him, Tony!"
