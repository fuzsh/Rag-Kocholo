        "text": "Iconic punk poet Ian Dury is set to be immortalised on the silver screen with a forthcoming biopic starring Andy Serkis being announced.\n\nA veteran of the pub rock scene, Ian Dury fronted Kilburn And The High Roads before finding fame with The Blockheads. That group’s blend of punk rock, jazz-funk, soul and goodness knows what else was judged by many to be the true soundtrack of London in the late 70s.\n\nDury suffered polio as a child and had to walk with the aid of a walking stick. Andy Serkis, who will play Dury in the forthcoming film, is best known for playing Gollum in the ‘Lord Of The Rings’ trilogy. However, this isn’t Serkis’ first musical role – he was cast as Martin Hannett in ’24 Hour Party People’.\n\nOf his new role Serkis told Cinema Blend that Dury was “an amazing character, a real poet. He sort of came up out of the British pub rock scene. He sort of pre-empted the Sex Pistols and the whole punk movement.”\n\n“And he was a polio sufferer, so he basically didn’t have much use of his left leg or his left arm. The chance of being any kind of rock star is like zero. He was one of the first disabled punk rockers ever. I’m really looking forward to that.”\n\nIan Dury died in 2000 after a battle with cancer."
