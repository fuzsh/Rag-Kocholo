Orian's previous films include: Shadow Of The Vampire, Tennis, Anyone ...?\n\nThey were the only Americans involved with the film and they were keen from the outset for it to reflect the true Ian Curtis and employed an English writer and actors to achieve this.

Deborah Curtis: Co-producer.\n\nIan Curtis's widow. Her book Touching from a Distance (Faber & Faber 1995) provides the most detailed biographical portrayal of Ian Curtis to date. While not a \"warts and all\" expose she does not shy away from some of Ian's less endearing characteristics.\n\nDeborah still lives in Macclesfield\n\nSee our Deborah Curtis interview Tony Wilson:\n\nArticulate Cambridge graduate and TV presenter who gave Joy Division their TV break on What's On and So It Goes. As founder of Factory Records and part owner of the Hacienda nightclub his influence in the Manchester music scene has been considerable. He is the main character in the fictionalised story of Factory Records in the film 24 Hour Party people, and he wrote of his own experiences in the book of the same name. \"It's like when I sat down to write the book of the film. I had problems with every single scene. What do I do - tell the truth, or go for the myth? It's a big formal problem. But, this is a film, so my instinct was go with the myth every time.\"' - Tony Wilson\n\nTony Wilson died in August 2007. Matt Greenhalgh: Writer:\n\nMatt was was a nightlife journalist on City Life magazine for five years and wrote Clocking Off (amongst other TV shows).\n\nHe took Deborah Curtis's book and expanded on it by interviewing the appropriate people, Including Annik Honore.
