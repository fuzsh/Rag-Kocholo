        "text": "Steve Coogan acting very, very drunk.\n\n24 Hour Party People is not a film about Tony Wilson. Nor is it meant to be a documentary about the music scene in Manchester. It's just a film. And a very good one.\n\nReview by David Jackson\n\nTony Wilson, for those who don't know, was the founder of Factory Records and the famous Hacienda club in Manchester. He's also the man behind, among others, New Order and the Happy Mondays. Not a bad CV.\n\nThe rollercoaster of musical genres begins at the Sex Pistols first gig in 1977, and goes on to follow Wilson's involvement in the development of Joy Division (later New Order) and the Happy Mondays.\n\nRalf Little of Royal Family fame plays New Order guitarist, Peter Hook.\n\nWhile it gives an insight into the spirit of the time, some references are historically inaccurate.\n\nThis is not a mistake - it just doesn't matter.\n\nPearl Harbour isn't any less of a film because of it's factual 'flaws', so why should this be?\n\nAnd thankfully, this film isn't an advert for Tony Wilson. Although the film portrays him as likeable at times, it also represents what a lot of other people thought of him...\n\nThe cast list runs like a 'who's who' of British comedians - Peter Kay (Phoenix Nights), Rob Brydon (Marion and Geoff), Dave Gorman, and Simon Pegg among them. There's also room for a number of cameos from people from the music scene (I'll leave you to spot them).\n\nPaddy Considine stars as the manager of the fictional Happy Mondays.\n\nPossibly the hardest role to play fell to Sean Harris who brilliantly depicts Ian Curtis (lead singer of Joy Division who would later commit suicide).\n\nWith a cast that strong it's no surprise the film is so good.\n\nThe focus on the Happy Mondays as they happily waste hundreds of thousands of pounds, take countless hardcore drugs, and sleep with whoever will sleep with them, represents everything good old fashioned rock 'n' roll should - carelessness."
