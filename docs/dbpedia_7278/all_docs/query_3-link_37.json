        "text": "You're going to see a lot more of that sort of thing in the picture. I don't want to say too much, don't want to spoil it. I'll just say one word: 'Icarus'. If you get it, great. If you don't, that's fine too. But you should probably read more.\n\nâ€”Tony Wilson\n\n24 Hour Party People is a 2002 biographical British film telling the story of Tony Wilson, a local news reporter (played by Steve Coogan), who attends a pivotal gig by The Sex Pistols in the 1970s and, believing he is living in \"one of the most important fucking times in human history\", decides to start a record company called Factory Records and a club, The Hacienda.\n\nThe film follows Tony and Factory as money is lost, lead singers commit suicide, Record Producer Martin Hannett goes insane and try to kill Tony, the birth of \"Madchester\" music and rave culture, Happy Mondays sell their equipment and studio for crack and then attempt to hold their new album for ransom... You wouldn't get this kinda stuff in a film about EMI.\n\nThe film focuses largely on two of Factory's most popular artists, Joy Division (and their later reformation as New Order) and The Happy Mondays, although it also features A Certain Ratio and Durutti Column to a lesser extent.\n\nNot to be confused with the trope Twenty-Four-Hour Party People (which is named after the Happy Mondays song that also gives this movie its name) about background extras who show up at parties for or thrown by a work's main characters.\n\nTropes used in 24 Hour Party People include:\n\nActor Allusion: Taken almost to Recursive Reality levels. Steve Coogan, who played Tony Wilson, based his comedy character Alan Partridge partly on Tony Wilson, and there are notable similarities between how the characters are presented.\n\nBiopic\n\nCountry Matters: Ian Curtis' first line in the movie is, \"Wilson, you fucking cunt!\" Later, Rob Gretton also calls him the C-word.\n\nDead Artists Are Better: Of a sort; the movie focuses heavily on Joy Division for the first half, but after Ian Curtis' suicide (and the subsequent reforming of the band into New Order), it goes on to show New Order's subsequent massive success with \"Blue Monday\", the best selling 12-inch single of all time. The focus then shifts from New Order to the Happy Mondays, although this largely was because the Happy Mondays had the more entertaining meltdown.\n\nDeadpan Snarker: Rob Gretton, manager of Joy Division / New Order, is depicted as an incredibly snarky individual, especially towards Tony.\n\nDemoted to Extra: The other members of Joy Division that became New Order. New Order guitarist/keyboardist Gillian Gilbert gets it worse and only appears twice, briefly and in non-speaking parts.\n\nDude, Where's My Respect?: Tony Wilson is dissatisfied with his career in TV journalism because he keeps getting assigned silly lifestyle pieces.\n\nA God Am I: Of a sort; while smoking a joint after the last gig at the Hacienda, Tony sees a vision of God... who just happens to look exactly like Tony Wilson. When Tony rejoins his mates and tells them this, they are less than impressed.\n\nThe Ishmael: Tony points out in one of his discussions how details of his own life are being glossed over, and while taking time to explain this, he notes that the story isn't about him but the music and Manchester.\n\nNo Animals Were Harmed: Tony Wilson goes out of his way in his narration to the audience to mention that no animals were harmed at the conclusion of a scene involving Shaun and Paul Ryder killing 3,000 pigeons with poisoned bread crumbs.\n\nThe Last DJ: Tony Wilson, for all his ego and faults, is portrayed as something like this; he refuses to sell out his beliefs and the other characters, so while they routinely mock him for other things, they nevertheless respect him because of this. It builds to a climax where, facing financial ruin, Factory Records is forced to sell their assets to the London-based London Records, but it's discovered that there isn't actually anything for them to sell:"
