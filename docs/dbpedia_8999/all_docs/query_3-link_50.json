        "text": "WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2 – 7:30 PM\n\nSATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 12 – 10:00 PM\n\nFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 18 – 8:00 PM ** w/ Alyce Wittenstein, Steve Ostringer, & Garrett Oliver in attendance for intro/Q&A! **\n\nMONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28 – 10:00 PM\n\nAlyce Wittenstein has been called the “Queen of the New York Underground” and this September, Spectacle is pleased to play host to her and the films making up her MULTIPLE FUTURES trilogy. These films are jam packed with familiar faces, exquisite set pieces, snappy dialogue, and dazzling costumes. While the films have indeed been shown the world over, these screenings will be the first in New York in almost two decades. Join us all month for these remarkable films in a celebration of science fiction, hilarity, character actors, and ghastly view of a not-too-distant world.\n\nPLUS\n\nSpecial guests, vintage press and screening ephemera from around the world, original props, maybe some custom made buttons, outtakes, and more!\n\nBETAVILLE\n\nDir. Alyce Wittenstein, 1986\n\n20 min.\n\nThe first in what would come to be known as the MULTIPLE FUTURES trilogy, BETAVILLE – a post-modern nightmare – finds a down and out detective Coman Gettme (played by Wittenstein mainstay Steve Ostringer) returning to his hometown after a chance meeting with The Girl (Holly Adams). Once the two arrive in Gettme’s Cadillac things immediately go from bad to worse for this gumshoe when he learns, over a slice at Stromboli’s, that High Fashion is the new law in town. Gettme becomes obsessed with The Girl and is determined to meet back up with her and “save” her from the these fashionable fascists.\n\nBETAVILLE kicks off the trilogy in a pitch perfect send up of the French New Wave and science fiction, and turns noir on it’s ear while (literally) running through some familiar parts of NYC. Holly Adams is nothing short of dynamite and Ostringer’s distinctive production design would lay the groundwork for the look of the films to come. Years before becoming Brewmaster at the Brooklyn Brewery, Garrett Oliver was co-producer on the film. The short would go on to be nominated for a number of awards at festivals and play all over the world – often (unsurprisingly) alongside Godard’s ALPHAVILLE.\n\n“Most of the detective narrator dialogue is clever, the cinematography is excellent, and I liked the (sort of) industrial music and the song by the Singing Squirrels.” – Michael J. Weldon, Psychotronic Magazine #2, 1989.\n\nNO SUCH THING AS GRAVITY\n\nDir. Alyce Wittenstein, 1989\n\n40 min.\n\nIn the not too distant future the LaFont corporation has all but taken over Earth. The company has revolutionized all elements of style, beauty, education, and housing but in the process (progress?!) has shipped many of Earth’s more “useless” inhabitants to the mysterious man made planet – and the largest scale experiment in human history – known as Nova Terra. Two scientists – Kay Zorn (Holly Adams) and Albert Leenhardt (Steve Robinson) are about to receive a prestigious award for their work on the LaFont Facelifter when they learn that Nova Terra is disrupting the Earth’s gravitational pull and will soon collide if it’s not destroyed. A headstrong lawyer and Kay’s boyfriend – Adam Malkonian (a scenery chewing Nick Zedd) – mouths off to a judge (the incomparable Taylor Mead – RIP) while defending a human teacher and is ordered to be relocated to the doomed planet. After meeting with the ambassador of Nova Terra (Emmanuelle Chaulet of Eric Rohmer’s BOYFRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS), Malkonian learns that perhaps the LaFont Corporation hasn’t been entirely truthful about what really happens on Nova Terra and vows to stop the destruction.\n\nWittenstein’s first sync sound film is overflowing with amazing set pieces and incredible performances. Some scenes were shot at the New York Hall of Science – including an Ames room and a number of other dazzling optical illusions. Look out for cameos from Michael J. Anderson (TWIN PEAKS), Wittenstein’s father as the insidious Andreas LaFont, and the director herself on Nova Terra.\n\nTHE DEFLOWERING\n\nDir. Alyce Wittenstein, 1994\n\n40 min.\n\n“The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old are dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.” – Antonio Gramsci, Prison Notebooks.\n\nThe quote above opens Wittenstein’s third and final film – THE DEFLOWERING. Again featuring some of Wittenstein’s tried and true players – Holly Adams, Emmanuelle Chaulet, Taylor Mead, and more – the film concerns yet another evil corporation this time HUXLEY BIO-TECH and their means to sanitize/beautify this world of ours. This time Wittenstein (with Ostringer back on production design) takes the costuming helm as well.\n\nThe TIB (Total Immune Breakdown) virus has left the planet reeling and lethal allergic reaction are at an all time high. Huxley’s efforts to produce perfect, designer children that are immune to viruses have had the side effect of hyper-allergic reactions. Why isn’t anything being done about allergies? No one wants to fund it! With the mortality rate skyrocketing, can mankind bounce back and feel the soft caress of skin against skin ever again or will the line at the Holo-Memorial Funeral Home grow ever longer?\n\nTHE KALAMPAG TRACKING AGENCY:\n\nAN EVENING OF FILM FROM THE PHILIPPINES\n\nSPANNING THE PAST 30 YEARS\n\nDir. Various, 1985–2015\n\nVarious, 67 min.\n\nFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 4 – 8:00 PM ** ONE NIGHT ONLY! **\n\nSpectacle is pleased to host The Kalampag Tracking Agency for an evening of film from the Philippines spanning the past 30 years. Filmmaker Gym Lumbera, artist Miko Revereza, and guest curator Lian Ladia will join us for a Q&A after the program.\n\nThe Kalampag Tracking Agency is a curatorial and organizational collaboration between Shireen Seno and Merv Espina. Overcoming institutional and personal lapses to give attention to little-seen works—some quite recent, some surviving loss and decomposition—this program collects loose parts in motion, a series of bangs, or kalampag in Tagalog, assembled by their individual strengths and how they might resonate off each other and a contemporary audience. Featuring some of the most striking films and videos from the Philippines and its diaspora, this initiative continues to navigate the uncharted topographies of Filipino alternative and experimental moving image practice from the past 30 years.\n\nAll works in this program are screened with the kind permission of the individual artists, the Mowelfund Film Institute and the Ateneo Art Gallery.\n\nDROGA!\n\nDir. Miko Revereza, 2014\n\nPhilippines/USA, 7 min. 21 sec.\n\nA Super 8 tourist film about the Los Angeles landscape through the lens of Filipino immigrants, examining cultural identity bydocumenting the intersections of American pop culture and Filipino traditions.\n\nMiko Revereza was born in Manila and grew up in the San Francisco bay area. Since relocating to Los Angeles in 2010, he’s worked primarily on music videos and live video art installations for L.A.’s experimental music scene. His personal films explore identity and the Americanization of the Filipino immigrant.\n\nMINSAN ISANG PANAHON\n\nAka ONCE UPON A TIME\n\nDir. Melchor Bacani III, 1989\n\nPhilippines, 4 min.\n\nAn experiment in optical printing using Super 8 home movies and hand-colored found film material. The film was created during the influential Christoph Janetzko workshops, conducted in 1989 and 1990, in collaboration with Mowelfund Film Institute, Goethe Institut and the Philippine Information Agency.\n\nMelchor Bacani III was an active staple of the Mowelfund Film Institute (MFI) film workshops in the late 80s and early 90s, creating several films in the process.\n\nABCD\n\nDir. Roxlee, 1985\n\nPhilippines, 5 min. 22 sec.\n\nAn experimental animation, decidedly crude in approach, part sociopolitical commentary and surrealist whimsy, advocating for a new and personal take on the alphabet.\n\nRoxlee is an icon of underground Philippine cinema. Apart from making animated and collage films, he is also a comic-strip artist known for ‘Cesar Asar’ and ‘Santingwar’. In the late 80s, he was featured in retrospectives in Hamburg and Berlin. In 2010, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Animation Council of the Philippines.\n\nBUGTONG: ANG SIGAW NI LALAKE\n\nAka RIDDLE: THE SHOUT OF MAN\n\nDir. RJ Leyran, 1990\n\nPhilippines, 3 min. 20 sec.\n\nRumoured to have used footage salvaged from a commercial studio dumpster, the film is a commentary on Filipino on-screen macho culture and one of the rare surviving works in the brief filmmaking career of Ramon ‘RJ’ Leyran. It was a product of the last Christoph Janetzko film workshop, with a focus on experiments with optical printers, held in 1990.\n\nRJ Leyran was active on and off screen in the late 80s and early 90s independent film communities. He was also an actor in several television soap operas, commercials, and movies, including Radio (2001), Ikaw Lamang Hanggang Ngayon (2002) and The Great Raid (2005).\n\nVERY SPECIFIC THINGS AT NIGHT\n\nDir. John Torres, 2011\n\nPhilippines, 4 min. 29 sec\n\nA mobile phone film that captures the peculiar tension between the beauty, violence, and raw exuberance of New Year’s Eve in Manila. Shot on Mahiyain Street (Shy Street), Sikatuna, a stone’s throw away from the house of Chavit Singson, who also led the masses to bring then President Estrada out of the presidential palace.\n\nA poet among Filipino filmmakers who work outside the commercial film industry, John Torres has developed an idiosyncratic cinematic syntax, often using on or off-screen spoken texts, including the poetry of local authors. The imagery and structure of his films are not prosaic, but associative and fragmented.\n\nJUAN GAPANG\n\nAka JOHNNY CRAWL\n\nDir. Roxlee, 1986\n\nPhilippines, 7 min. 18 sec.\n\nA man searches for his destiny while crawling the streets of the metropolis at the height of the Marcos dictatorship, traversing the main EDSA thoroughfare, and tracing the shadows of the pillars of the Manila Film Center, all just before the People Power Revolution and the storming of EDSA that toppled the Marcos regime.\n\nRoxlee is an animator, visual artist, musician, and filmmaker, working with the barest of materials to conjure powerful images with biting humor. His book ‘Cesar Asar in the Planet of the Noses,’ a collection of his cartoons and short stories, was published in 2008.\n\nCHOP-CHOPPED FIRST LADY + CHOP-CHOPPED FIRST DAUGHTER\n\nDir. Yason Banal, 2005\n\nPhilippines, 1 min. 54 sec.\n\nA tongue-in-cheek poke at our own culture and recent history. The First Lady is none other than Imelda Marcos, the First Daughter none other than Kris Aquino. Both women’s lives and antics juxtaposed with gory evocations of the highly-publicized chop-chop lady murders that were exploited by those 90s slasher films Aquino herself starred in.\n\n*This was piece was last shown as a 2channel video installation at the Ateneo Art Gallery (AAG), and is reformatted as split screen for the purposes of this screening program, with kind permission from the artist and AAG.\n\nYason Banal studied Film at the University of the Philippines and Fine Art at Goldsmiths College-University of London. He has exhibited widely in Manila and abroad at the Tate, Frieze Art Fair, Guangzhou Triennale, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, AIT Tokyo, Singapore Biennale, Oslo Kunsthall, Christie’s, IFA Berlin, Shanghai Biennale and Queens Museum of Art.\n\nTHE RETROCHRONOLOGICAL TRANSFER OF INFORMATION\n\nDir. Tad Ermitaño, 1994\n\nPhilippines, 9 min. 33 sec.\n\nLess a documentary than a marvelous if irreverent parody of science fiction films. A humorous meditation on time, politics, and point of view in cinema. Hoping to send a message back in time by equipping the camera to shoot through Rizal’s portrait on Philippine money, Ermitano plays with the boundaries of different points of view: Rizal’s, that of Philippine politics, the camera’s, the filmmaker’s, and ours—as well as with the temporal relations between them.\n\nTad Ermitano studied biology at the University of Hiroshima, philosophy at the University of the Philippines, trained in film and video at MFI, and was co-founder of pioneering multimedia collective Children of Cathode Ray.\n\nARS COLONIA\n\nDir. Raya Martin, 2011\n\nPhilippines, 1 min. 13 sec.\n\nA conquistador counts his blessings in this hand-colored effigy evoking old, silent war iconography. Commissioned by the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2011, it screened before all films supported by IFFR’s Hubert Bals Fund.\n\nRaya Martin has more than a dozen films to his credit: an ambitious, constantly evolving body of work consisting of fiction features, documentaries, shorts, and installations. Martin draws on a wide array of sources—combining pop culture references, archival material, and avant-garde structuralism—in his radically lyrical works. This daring, restless filmmaker with a sensibility all his own suggests entirely new ways of approaching film, personal, and national history.\n\nCLASS PICTURE\n\nDir. Tito & Tita, 2012\n\nPhilippines, 4 min. 41 sec.\n\nShot on a single roll of expired 16mm film, this ‘photography film’ injects evokes faded memories and injects lyricism and humor into the archetypal class picture, alongside the fleeting sound of waves crashing on a beach.\n\nTito & Tita (Manila, Philippines) is a collective of young artists working mainly with film and photography via a variation of experimental techniques. As individual filmmakers, their works have been featured in various film festivals and art fairs. As a collective, they have exhibited in Manila, Singapore, and Tokyo.\n\nANITO\n\nDir. Martha Atienza, 2012\n\nPhilippines/Netherlands, 8 min. 8 sec.\n\nAn animistic festival Christianized and incorporated into Folk Catholicism slowly turns into modern day madness. A tragicomic portrait of a small island town whose livelihood is deeply rooted in and bound to the sea.\n\nMartha Atienza lives and works in the Netherlands and the Philippines. Her works are sociological in nature, reflecting a keen observation of her direct environment. Atienza understands her surroundings as a landscape of people first and foremost.\n\nHINDI SA ATIN ANG BUWAN\n\nAka THE MOON IS NOT OURS\n\nDir. Jon Lazam, 2011\n\nPhilippines, 3 min. 31 sec.\n\nTravel footage from a family holiday on the island of Bohol, Philippines, is captured in black and white, without sound, on a basic video camera, in this contemplative piece on lost love, distance, resignation and sadness.\n\nJon Lazam is an experimental filmmaker based in Manila. His works have screened abroad in Chicago, Rio de Janeiro, Montreal, Paris and San Francisco. His most recent work, Pantomime For Figures Shrouded By Waves, premiered at the Sharjah Biennial, and won Best Short Film at the Cinemanila International Film Festival.\n\nKALAWANG\n\nAka RUST\n\nDir. Cesar Hernando, Eli Guieb III & Jimbo Albano, 1989\n\nPhilippines, 6 min. 33 sec.\n\nOne of the most prominent and well-crafted films that emerged from the Christoph Janetzko experimental film workshops, Kalawang is a satirical piece that uses found footage of war, sex, and pop culture to unpick the cultural and libidinal complex of colonization.\n\nCesar Hernando is a filmmaker and one of Philippine cinema’s best production designers, having contributed to films of Mike De Leon, Ishmael Bernal, and Lav Diaz. Eli Guieb III is a filmmaker and award-winning fiction writer. Jimbo Albano is an artist and editorial illustrator for BusinessMirror and Philippines Graphic Magazine.\n\nThis program would be impossible to put together without the kind support of the individual artists, the Mowelfund Film Institute, UP College of Mass Communications, UP Film Institute, Ateneo Art Gallery, Green Papaya Art Projects, Terminal Garden, and the National Film Archive of the Philippines.\n\nThe screening prints of the 8mm and 16mm films created in the 80s and 90s that are featured in the Kalampag Tracking Agency are mostly unavailable, missing or completely decomposed. Some of the lucky ones have negatives and/or preservation copies left. The screening versions of the older works in this screening program come from crude U-Matic, VHS and Betamax transfers. The curatorial team is still in the process of tracking down the surviving prints.\n\nAn expanded version of this program was previously shown at the University of the Philippines Film Institute, Green Papaya Art Projects, and EXiS Experimental Film and Video Festival in Seoul, August–September 2014.\n\nOf the filmmakers associated with the so-called New Swiss Cinema, itself not particularly well-known abroad, Michel Soutter has perhaps the least claim to being any kind of household name. Alain Tanner and Claude Goretta are known outside their homeland, but Soutter has largely remained what he consciously started out as: a provincial filmmaker. Throughout his three-decade long career he stuck to the region between Geneva and Fribourg, setting all his films in the cities and their immediate environs. This geographical intimacy translates to a personal intimacy. His main focus is always the little particularities and material details of the lives of his characters, the clothes they wear and the furnishings in their houses. But what makes Soutter interesting is not the mere documentary value of his films—the immortalization of various minutiae of life in the provinces—but the purposes he uses it for: denouncing the spiritual vacuity of the Swiss bourgeoisie, finding value in idle playfulness, and lending his voice to a frustrated generation of directionless rebels who rattle their golden fetters if not actually breaking through them.\n\nIn his later films Soutter would go on to collaborate with such well-known figures of French cinema as Jean-Louis Trintignant, Delphine Seyrig, and Pierre Clémenti, but in his early works he employed such home-bred talent as Jean-Luc Bideau, who also worked frequently with Tanner and Goretta. This series of Soutter’s first five features aims to highlight the charming modesty of his themes, his economy of means, and the subterranean force running through the apparent calmness of his work: the schizophrenic boredom of the Swiss, which makes the restless among them leap from one though to another arbitrarily, poetically, trying to learn to feel again by feigning joy and rage and dispassionately emulating real passions.\n\nTHE MOON WITH TEETH\n\na.k.a. La Lune avec les dents\n\nDir. Michel Soutter, 1966\n\nSwitzerland, 75 min.\n\nIn French with English subtitles\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 1 – 7:30 PM\n\nTHURSDAY, AUGUST 6 – 7:30 PM\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUGUST 26 – 10:00 PM\n\n“I was twenty. I won’t let anyone say it’s the most beautiful time of life.”\n\nThe first line of Sartre’s schoolmate and Resistance fighter Paul Nizan’s 1931 novella, Aden-Arabie, is echoed by William, the young and restless subject of Soutter’s first feature. William lives an uprooted life, structured by a worthless bowling alley job and punctuated by self-destructive binges. He’s the first of Soutter’s lonely rebel protagonists, young men with deep reserves of undirected energy and shapeless yearnings for liberation. He’s virile, brooding, and violent. He regards children, virginity, and love as weaknesses. With his materialistic nihilism, it’s as if he was picked straight out of a Dostoevsky novel: “You know how science defines life? Gradual degeneration culminating in death.”\n\nWilliam’s terminal dissatisfaction derives from that other major theme of Soutter’s: Swiss society. In his films, the Swiss are either content professionals and housewives or quarrelsome misfits without any positive vision of the ultimate upheaval that would deliver them from the airless luxury prison that Switzerland represents for them. Shoplifting out of boredom, William resorts to a typically Swiss argument when caught: “I was trying to economize.”\n\nHASCHISCH\n\nDir. Michel Soutter, 1968\n\nSwitzerland, 77 min.\n\nIn French with English subtitles\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 1 – 10:00 PM\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUGUST 12 – 7:30 PM\n\nSUNDAY, AUGUST 23 – 5:00 PM\n\nSoutter’s second feature fared better with the critics. At the very least, it showed the director’s mettle to continue building on his main preoccupations—feckless, aimless youth, absence of political solidarity and the anemic qualities of Swiss society—that had been the subject of so much initial derision. Like William in LA LUNE AVEC LES DENTS, Mathieu is another disciple of dissatisfaction trudging through everyday life. “Living together gets boring. We just save money,” says his friend, Bruno. An actor of the theater, Mathieu has few prospects in this trade, save for empty promises from his producer. At this point, he’s more a kind of flaneur—only, his sojourns don’t occur along the boulevards and arcades of Baudelaire’s Paris, but on the sterile streets of a nondescript town. All is bleak morass. Frustrated with his work in the theater, Mathieu decides he wants out of Switzerland. Matthew asks Bruno, a car mechanic, if he wants to split for Anatolia. Bruno agrees, breakups with his girlfriend and spiffs up his car. Meanwhile, Mathieu must pick up a theater friend, Pauline, an actress of note, from the airport. Naturally, Mathieu falls in love with her, and suddenly, leaving for Anatolia becomes all the more difficult.\n\nIn HASCHISCH, there aren’t any scenes of drugged-out dope fiends, but the title’s narcotic connotations run true throughout the film: Soutter captures his actors deep in the haze of their own private worlds as they walk through an unconvincing reality, one which always depresses the shoulders and dulls the mind (Pauline: “Good thing we don’t think!”). Soutter’s characters are always sharply aware of the moribund nature of their lives, but are unable act on their own desire for change. In one scene, Mathieu is in the recording studio and recites, ironically, a few lines by the Turkish poet, Nâzım Hikmet: “I contemplate Switzerland from the train. Her towns are boring but her sanatoriums are gay! Could I live among such respectable folks? Maybe when I’m 90…Why have I written about Switzerland?”\n\nTHE APPLE\n\na.k.a. La Pomme\n\nDir. Michel Soutter, 1969\n\nSwitzerland, 85 min.\n\nIn French with English subtitles\n\nSUNDAY, AUGUST 9 – 5:00 PM\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 15 – 7:30 PM\n\nMONDAY, AUGUST 31 – 7:30 PM\n\nSoutter’s third feature follows a handful of young idlers and professionals in Geneva, living out the kind of sluggish, arbitrary existence that a country as suffocatingly prosperous as Switzerland makes possible. Something of a solitary revolutionary, Simon is mapping out the places in Geneva where Lenin lived in exile before the 1905 uprising. Simon’s boss, Marcel, is a jet-setting reporter and a perfect symbol of Swiss complacency, living in a suburban villa that he calls his “refuge from revolutions, civil wars, crises, and coups d’état.” When Simon’s girlfriend Laura comes to visit, a bitter triangle drama develops among them, as Simon’s hatred for Marcel and the world he represents keeps growing.\n\nTHE APPLE has been compared to Jean Eustache’s 1967 short film SANTA CLAUSE HAS BLUE EYES (starring Jean-Pierre Léaud) for its ability to capture all the nuances of both the happiness and the malaise of indecisive adolescents. Beyond that, it offers snapshots of late 1960s Geneva, an acerbic commentary on the self-satisfied, smug inertia of the Swiss bourgeoisie, and an indictment of the journalistic profession. As Simon says, “Switzerland has its ass placed squarely on the Third World,” and Soutter goes to infuriating lengths to convey the stiflingly peaceful postwar atmosphere that its isolated rebels feel a growing urge to break through.\n\nJAMES OU PAS\n\nDir. Michel Soutter, 1970\n\nSwitzerland, 80 min.\n\nIn French with English subtitles\n\nMONDAY, AUGUST 10 – 7:30 PM\n\nMONDAY, AUGUST 24 – 7:30 PM\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUGUST 26 – 7:30 PM\n\nIf Soutter steered clear of any attempt to build a plot in his previous features, in JAMES OU PAS, Soutter offers enough dramatic inflections to show a marked change in his practice. As in Antonioni’s BLOW-UP, a witness to a potential act of crime jumpstarts the film. Hearing a gunshot, Hector (played by the irrepressible Jean-Luc Bideau), a low-wage cabdriver, stops his car midway somewhere in the Swiss fields and follows the man he suspects was responsible for the shooting. Instead, Hector runs into James, an enigmatic bachelor who lives all alone in his ivory-tower pad. James convinces him to pick up his friend Eva from the airport, and suddenly Hector—accustomed to a rote schedule—finds himself entangled with a group of strangers in a time and place he does not recognize. Hector’s quandary prompted Jean-Louis Bory to call JAMES OU PAS Soutter’s re-formulation of Hamlet’s “to be or not to be.” More to the point, as Soutter’s most perceptive critic, Freddy Buache, noted, a Soutter film usually boils down to “men and women at the intersection of everywhere and nowhere … brought together in unexpected situations by chance, and they have to unmask or mask themselves, become believable or make-believe, speak to each other, and, intentionally or not, confess to being what they are.”\n\nSoutter’s dry humor finds its perfect mouthpiece in Bideau, who can rattle off monologues with jovial ease. The rotating cast of characters and chance encounters recall some of the fluid cat-and-mouse games of Jacques Rivette. Gone are the Bressonian, stone-faced types from his earlier films. The droll, everyday languorousness of Swiss life still remains in the backdrop, but with Soutter’s newly formed comic lightness, the absurd registers most strongly in JAMES OU PAS. Dazed from the turn of events, Hector, growing increasingly unable to distinguish reality from his own thoughts, says to himself, as if entranced, “I want life to be as it always has been: monotonous and comfortable.” Can anyone escape Soutter’s Swiss Inferno?\n\nTHE SURVEYORS\n\na.k.a. Les Arpenteurs\n\nDir. Michel Soutter, 1972\n\nSwitzerland, 81 min.\n\nIn French with English subtitles\n\nMONDAY, AUGUST 3 – 7:30 PM\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 8 – 10:00 PM\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUGUST 19 – 7:30 PM\n\nIn his fifth feature, Soutter breaks his rule of portraying only the idle classes of Swiss society and the equally idle would-be fugitives from it. Leon—a lion of a man with a thick caterpillar mustache and heavy mutton chops—is a land surveyor whose job brings him to the country estate of Alice, a dreamy blonde who picks strawberries in the garden and never misses teatime with her mother. After a fleeting liaison in Alice’s house with a mysterious English woman who disappears as quickly as she appeared, Leon becomes terrified for his own sake (Was she of legal age? Will there be criminal charges? Was I trespassing?) and hires a lawyer to save his skin. An inveterate egoist, Leon’s statement of principle could easily double as a slogan of Swiss isolationism: “We’re never as strong as when we’re alone.”\n\nTHE SURVEYORS is firmly implanted in Soutter’s usual milieu of professionals living in the prosperous Swiss countryside, a world of lawyers, cellists, and noncommittally philosophizing young ladies. But here he adds an element of foreboding: the surveyors are invading the provinces, planning to build God knows what awful roads or shopping centers. The gentry are feeling a nebulous panic growing inside them. What will happen to our Switzerland of quaint chalets and verdant hills?\n\nSpectacle is pleased to present a series of screenings celebrating the life and work of electronic music and avant-garde legend Conrad Schnitzler. Schnitzler (1937-2011) came to popularity as a founding member of Tangerine Dream and Kluster, and went on to an influential and prolific career of unmistakably personal intermedia artistry. The programs are organized in collaboration with artist “Gen Ken” Ken Montgomery, friend and collaborator of Schnitzler, and founder of Generator, NYC’s “first sound art gallery.”\n\nThese screenings are part of a larger CON-MYTHOLOGY 2015 series of CONcerts and events throughout August, taking place at Academy Records, ALLGOLD at the MoMA PS1 Print Shop, and Control.

His work as an intermedia artist is less-known yet equally legendary. Schnitzler studied sculpture with Joseph Beuys at the Düsseldorf Academy of Art, exhibited his black and white metal sculptures in Berlin, and participated in performances and “happenings” in the same circles as many well-known Fluxus artists, although never identified himself as part of any group or movement. He preferred to create his own individual mythology.\n\nIn the early 70s Schnitzler became a composer when he abandoned all of his sculptures in an open field in decision to devote himself to sculpting with sound. His self produced stark electronic music, often presented as multi-channel concerts using as many as 12 cassette players and self published his music on vinyl and cassettes. Schnitzler gradually found an international cult following from his prolific output of musical ideas, However Schnitzler’s immense creative energy could not be limited to one medium. He continuously experimented with moving images to accompany his music and even painted, collaged or scratched patterns directly on 8mm film. He experimented with stop-motion animations and designed and costumes for his films. By the 80s Schnitzler had become increasingly reclusive, shooting long meditative videos accompanied by his distinctive electronic musical scores. Preferring to stay at home and work in his studio he created multi-channel Cassette Concerts that could be sent through the post for others to perform and “CONduct” concerts of his music. Schnitzler conceived of sonic programs he called Musik in the Dark intended to be heard in darken movie theaters, churches, stadiums and other venues without him having to travel. Although he rarely left his Berlin home after 1980, Schnitzler came to New York City in 1989 and 1990 to visit the Generator Sound Art Gallery in the East Village.\n\n“Electronic music appears to be a field developed by few who did not deplete it of originality within a few years. While many are consumed by their own technology or starved for fame, only a small number have approached it as a personal communicative craft rather than as an intentional development of traditional Western classical or commercialized music. Conrad Schnitzler remains at the forefront of a handful of artists willing to take chances with possible yet underdeveloped forms.” – David Prescott 1989\n\nGen Ken Montgomery (1957) is a New York-based artist whose involvement in the cassette-culture and mail-art movements of the late seventies led to the creation of Generator, New York’s first sound art gallery (1989). At Generator Montgomery amassed what is now a time capsule of internationally produced art in the form of cassettes, records, zines and ephemera from the days before the internet when artists collaborated and corresponded internationally by post. In 2013 at Audio Visual Arts in New York City, Montgomery exhibited his collection from that era and re-created Generator by curating events with artists whose work was shown at the Generator in the late 80s and early 90s (see www.audiovisualarts.org/5973/ generator). In 2014 Montgomery re-launched the Generations Unlimited label that he co-founded with Conrad Schnitzler and David Prescott in 1987.

After the brutal anti-communist purges of the 1960’s under the iron-fist of the archipelago’s strongman and dictator Suharto, the Indonesian working class and blue-collar laborers sought an escape from an oppressive reality.\n\nIn JAKARTA SCREAMS we will review the new Indonesian escapist cinema that ultimately delivered them from their authoritarian reality. This new style of regional filmmaking provided the high adrenaline violence and sexuality of Western cinema hybridized with the region’s traditional folkloric and mythological stories, archetypes and themes resulting in a form of cinema unlike any other in Southeast Asia or the globe. While some theorists claimed this form of filmmaking was only a bread and circus to maintain the control held by Suharto’s political regime, others claimed that the filmmakers exercised subversive symbolism, depicting government figures as the criminals and villains ultimately punished and destroyed in these epics for the small cinemas of villages and small towns.\n\nThis prolific period is the largest footprint Indonesian filmmakers have made to this day in the course of film history. Its surrealist fantastical horror films populated with shape-shifting martial arts warriors, demon-sorceresses and serpent-women invite the viewer the explore the depths of its sensual, absurd, tropical cinema.\n\nMYSTICS IN BALI\n\n1981, Dir. H. Tut Djalil\n\nIndonesia. 86 min.\n\nSUNDAY, AUGUST 2 – 5PM\n\nTHURSDAY, AUGUST 6 – 10PM\n\nTUESDAY, AUGUST 18 – 10PM\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 29 – 7:30PM\n\nIn H. Tut Djalil’s Indonesian horror-exploitation classic MYSTICS OF BALI, American anthropologist Catherine Keene seeks out training in the ways of the leyak, a cult of demonic Balinese sorceresses imbued with powerful and ancient magic. Having been seduced by the promise of mastery in the ancient tradition of leyak sorcery however, Cathy becomes trapped in the form of a penangalan, a floating disembodied vampiric head, spine and entrails with a fondness for devouring pregnant women and fetuses. With Cathy in the thrall of the leyak queen and unable to return to human form her lover Mahendra consults a local shaman to undo the leyak’s subversion and restore Cathy to her human form.\n\nDjalil’s MYSTICS OF BALI,results in a compelling hybrid of Western cinematic style and the impromptu style of Indonesian cinema. Using non-actors and unconventional narrative structure, maestro of the Indonesian horror canon H. Tjut Djalil brings a campy fusion of American-style b-movie horror and action and Indonesian folktale to the screen resulting in a cannibalistic jaunt through the mountains of rural Bali.\n\nLADY TERMINATOR\n\n1989, Dir. H. Tjut Djalil\n\nIndonesia. 82 min.\n\nMONDAY, AUGUST 3 – 10PM\n\nSUNDAY, AUGUST 9 – 7:30PM\n\nSUNDAY, AUGUST 23 – 7:30PM\n\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 28 – 7:30PM\n\nH. Tjut Djalil’s LADY TERMINATOR is based on the Javanese legend of Nyai Roro Kidul or the South Sea Queen, an enchanting siren-like figure that was said to be not only a powerful courtesan to the sultans of the islands but also a naga spirit, a Southeast Asian snake nymph, imbued with powerful and deadly magic.\n\nUpon a research gathering assignment on a remote Indonesian island an American anthropological student becomes possessed by the spirit of the South Sea Queen, a long deceased witch with a powerful sexual endowment fatal to the men she seduces. Determined to rise again and seek revenge against the great grand-daughter of the man who stole her serpentine magic and return to her former power, the South Sea Queen seizes the body of this unsuspecting tourist in a strange land as her new host and begins wreaking chaos throughout the urban landscape of Jakarta. Leaving a trail of male bodies in her wake she is unstoppable until she meets local police detective Max McNeil.\n\nIn Djalil’s LADY TERMINATOR the classic myth of the South Sea Queen is brought into the context of the exploitation cinema genre’s that animated cinema and filmmaking in 1980’s Indonesia. Djalil’s twisted mash-up of American action and adventure films, LADY TERMINATOR, Indonesian folktale and martial arts b-movie genres results in something familiar and yet altogether unique, wonderful and strange.\n\nTHE WARRIOR\n\n1981, Dir. Sisworo Gautama Putra\n\nIndonesia. 92 min.\n\nSUNDAY, AUGUST 2 – 7:30PM\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 15 – 10PM\n\nMONDAY, AUGUST 24 – 10PM\n\nTUESDAY, AUGUST 25 – 7:30PM\n\nIn Sisworo Gautama Putra’s THE WARRIOR, Jaka Sembung is the champion of the province of Kandanghaur against the colonial oppression of the Dutch imperial machine in the Indonesian archipelago. Played with swagger and conviction by Barry Prima, after the title character Jaka Sembung leads a small uprising against a forced labor edict by the Dutch imperial forces, a local Dutch commander seeks to quell the rebellion through challenging Jaka Sembung to a contest of strength. Jaka Sembung overcomes this and a great many other challenges through the aid of traditional folk magic and his will to resist, including treacherous villagers, spies and the soldiers of the Dutch imperial army. After facing brutal torture and near defeat Jaka Sembung is transformed by his master into a boar to escape his captors and so he may hide before he leads his final assault against their imperial overlords.\n\nSisworo Gautama Putra’s THE WARRIOR is a notable masterpiece of Indonesian exploitation cinema particularly in that it is one of only a few films to address the brutality and trauma of Dutch occupation, albeit with a light heart and a great deal of homage in equal measure both to Indonesian folk tradition and to the martial arts films of Bruce Lee.\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 1: AND GOD SAID TO CAIN\n\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 7: TOXIC ZOMBIES\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 8: TOXIC ZOMBIES\n\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 14: THE EMBALMER\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 15: THE EMBALMER\n\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 21: LASER MISSION\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 22: NINJA MISSION\n\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 28: MY CHAUFFEUR\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 29: THE HORROR OF PARTY BEACH\n\nAND GOD SAID TO CAIN\n\nAntonio Margheriti, 1970.\n\n96 min. Italy/West Germany.\n\nIn German with English subtitles.\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 1 – MIDNIGHT\n\nIn this macabre spaghetti western, the Duke of Delirium, Goth Kinski, gives a rare, heroic and unquestionably leading role as a man released after ten years of wrongful incarceration in a prison labor camp. Once sprung, he meanders his way back to town to get revenge on the men who framed him — one of whom has since become a wealthy and politically powerful land baron with dozens of hired guns on the payroll.\n\nThe plot may be traditional, but the movie is anything but: AND GOD SAID TO CAIN is notorious as of the darkest spaghettis ever made, and closer in tone to Italian horror films of the period than traditional westerns. It’s the most accomplished picture of underrated director Antonio Margheriti, best known for gothic horror films like CASTLE OF BLOOD and THE LONG HAIR OF DEATH. CAIN is an effortless synthesis of the two genres: in a largely wordless performance, Kinski assumes an almost phantasmagorical aura, and eerie shootouts take place under moonlight and in churches and candlelit quarters. The film’s baroque, blazing climax — think the of funhouse shootout of THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI restaged in Hell — validates the film’s German title, SATAN DER RACHE — “Satan of Revenge.”\n\nThough AND GOD SAID TO CAIN frequently languishes in washed out transfers in YouTube and public domain purgatory, tonight we’ll show a pristine digital transfer with the German-language soundtrack that preserves Kinski’s original spoken dialog.\n\nTOXIC ZOMBIES\n\naka Bloodeaters\n\nDir. Charles McCrann, 1980\n\nUSA, 89 min.\n\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 7 – MIDNIGHT\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 8 – MIDNIGHT\n\nWe return with the second examination of some of the lesser-know films to pop on on Mary Whitehouse’s list of “sadist videos”, criticized for their combination of sex. violence and cruelty. What the Nurse With Wound list was to experimental music weirdoes, the Video Nasty List became a must-see list for those lurking in dingy basement video stores. For contemporary viewers, it’s easy to think of such a list as silly and tame, but it’s worth keeping in mind this list wasn’t really about gutmunching gore effects — for most of these films, it’s the cavalier combination of giddy bloodshed and unrepentant deviancy sneaking into suburban homes any time little Janey and Johnny skipped down to the video rental store. Many of these films are now considered classics (POSSESSION, TENEBRAE, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, THE LAST HOUSE ON YOUR LEFT) while others will still turn even lifetime Fangoria readers green (ANTHROPOPHAHOUS, LOVE CAMP 7, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST), but with the Video Nasty Project we’re taking a look at some of the lesser-known films to appear on the list. Do you dare to watch them all?\n\nDeep in the forest, a group of pot farmers get into a Ruby Ridge situation with some corrupt US agents, who then spray the crops with some kinda psychedelic that turns the farmers into zombies. That’s the setup, but director/writer/actor Charles McCrann (in his only film) isn’t here to give you a ton of backstory: he’s here for zombies in the woods, Romero-style anti-establishment rhetoric and a general vibe that’d sit nicely with BURIAL GROUND or THE LIVING DEAD AT MANCHESTER MORGUE. With all the washed-out grungy deep woods darkness and flanging score you’d expect, we’re delighted to bring you TOXIC ZOMBIES!\n\nTHE EMBALMER\n\naka Il mostro di Venezia\n\nDir. Dino Tavella, 1965\n\nItaly, 77 min.\n\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 14 – MIDNIGHT\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 15 – MIDNIGHT\n\n“How lovely you are! Like alabaster goddesses. No living woman possesses your mysterious fascination or your sweet repose.”\n\nWelcome to Venice! It is one of the most picturesque cities in the entire world with its beautiful architecture dotting the murky waters of the grand canal. Our story begins here with a series of disappearances. All of the disappearances have something in common, the missing are all young ladies who just happened to have disappeared close to a canal. The police suspect that the missing young ladies may have fallen into the water and drowned, but none of the bodies have been recovered. Meanwhile, a reporter from a local paper begins to suspect that the disappearances are the work of some fiend who is kidnapping young women and hiding their bodies deep in the Venetian canals. The city is in a state of panic! How many more girls can possibly disappear?! Well, about nine more because just around the corner is a group of lovely young ladies visiting from Rome and they are just dying to explore Venice. Which one of the girls will be the first victim of this fiend? Who is the mysterious fiend and what is this fiend doing to the bodies of these young ladies?\n\nTHE EMBALMER is an early Giallo film that reads like a travelogue film with a touch of gothic imagery. The city of Venice and its labyrinthian canals take the place of the ancient stately manor found in gothic tales. Macabre tinged scenes are scattered throughout the film like that of a pop musician emerging from a coffin to sing songs to an unsuspecting crowd and a crypt full of petrified monks a la Capuchin crypt. THE EMBALMER is a must see for all Giallo fans.\n\nLASER MISSION\n\nDir. BJ Davis, 1989\n\nUSA, 84 min.\n\nEnglish.\n\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 21 – MIDNIGHT\n\nBefore he was THE CROW (but definitely after his LEGACY OF RAGE), Brandon Lee was Michael Gold – a cocky, self-righteous asshole who upends his fully free agent status and chooses to accept a LASER MISSION on offer from the CIA (but, like, eschewing CASH MONEY USA in favor of action man SWAGGER ethics). There’s something about the WORLD’S LARGEST DIAMOND gone missing, along with some LASER expert (expertly lazied by ERNEST BORGNINE) being held in Angola (or somewhere) by the KGB (or Cuban military or some Austrian madman or something). All this adds up to is TROUBLE and the potential END of the WESTERN WORLD as we KNOW IT. When not donning gross disguises to fool bumbling cartoon humans, Gold is totes in NEGGING WAR III with terminal television episoder DEBI MONAHAN (who may or may not be portraying a daughter or a double agent or whatever).\n\nEven if you HAVE seen LASER MISSION, you won’t want to MISS our special WIDESCREEN presentation, with all the EXPLOSIVE action (and sometimes admittedly great wide tracking shots) as NEVER BEFORE SEEN in domestic US BARGAIN BINS and FIFTY-FILM DVD collections.\n\nIf you HAVEN’T seen LASER MISSION, then grab your favorite brand of adult diapers and head the hell over here. Sounds appealing? Then make like an ORANGE and GET JUICED.\n\nNINJA MISSION\n\nDir. Mats Helge Olsson, 1984\n\nSweden, 93 min.\n\nIn English.\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 22 – MIDNIGHT\n\n** Part of our “Lasers vs. Ninjas” Weekend Spectacular! **\n\nMY CHAUFFEUR\n\nDir. David Beaird, 1986\n\nUSA, 97 min.\n\nIn English\n\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 28 – MIDNIGHT\n\n“You ever give an Alka-Seltzer to a dog?”\n\nEndless Bummer heads from the 70s to the 80s with our final film, MY CHAUFFEUR. Starring Deborah Foreman, who was *everywhere* in the eighties (Valley Girl, Real Genius, Waxwork, April Fool’s Day), as Casey Meadows, a dishwasher who receives an invitation to work for the prestigious Brentwood chauffeur company directly from the company’s owner (none other than the great E.G. Marshall!). Disliked by the all-male staff and barely tolerated by her boss (Howard Hesseman of WKRP/Rubin and Ed fame), Casey takes on a series of insane jobs, from lugging drunken rock band Cat Fight around LA to dealing with a spoiled stalker’s heartbreak (if you suspect this may lead to love, you’re right) and none other than Penn and Teller playing an sheik and a con-man attempting to lure him out of his money. Despite all odds, Casey’s non-conformist streak leads her to triumph where the other stuffed-shirt drivers fail miserably. A staple of cable tv during the late eighties and one of the final Marimark Productions films, MY CHAUFFEUR hits all the rom-com notes while offering plenty of off-color comedy and topless hijinx for the midnight crowd. Drive off into the sun setting over the Pacific as Endless Bummer finishes up…FOR NOW!\n\nTHE HORROR OF PARTY BEACH\n\nDir. Del Tenney, 1964\n\nUnited States, 78 min.\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 29 – MIDNIGHT\n\n“Weird Atomic Beasts Who Live Off Human BLOOD!”\n\nLet’s go to the beach! What a wonderful place to get away with its sparkling blue water and radioactive monsters! Well, more like the radioactive living dead for you see radioactive waste is being dumped into the ocean and as a result the remains of the poor souls littering the ocean floor have been mutated into humanoid fish-like monsters! Monsters that have chosen to make their first appearance on the sunny shores of Connecticut! The monsters have decided to crash a happenin’ beach party that is being presided over by none other than surf rock legends The Del-Aires! All the girls and boys were too busy doing the zombie stomp to notice the monsters crawling up on land and feasting on the blood of bikini clad beauties! Can the blood thirsty rampage of these monsters be stopped?\n\nTHE HORROR OF PARTY BEACH is one of the first, if not the first horror beach party film. Think of it as BEACH BLANKET BINGO, but filled with blood thirsty monsters whose mouths look like they have been stuffed with a pack of hotdogs. It is a refreshing freudian slap in the face to those “wholesome” beach party films. The film is beautifully shot and features some fantastic sequences like the creation of the monsters. It’s funny, creepy, and the music of The Del-Aires will have you groovin’ all night long. What are you waiting for? Let’s go to the beach!"
