        "meta_description": "Take Me to Your Bleeder by GroDie, released 24 June 2022\n\n1. A Grimm Tale\n2. Blue Fairy Dies Lonely\n3. Plant out of Place\n4. Maladie Gelson\n5. Meet Me at the Lost and Found at 2PM\n6. Mermaid Eater\n7. Oncoming Birds\n8. Of Shady Fern\n9. Hey There, Dogboy\n10. The Triumph of Peter Brutal, the Elder\n\n&quot;I only eat cheeseburgers and pussy...my soul feels like shit.&quot;\r\n\r\nWise words from a wise man, Bo Dugan aka Graham Bowlin aka half of GroDie, who I discovered after an exchange of follows on Instagram. He admired our work and I admired his art and presence on the platform. Photos of pianos full of dildos, talks of cocaine, trucking and cucking...and not to mention his music, which struck me as wholly unique, funny, and dark. \r\n\r\nNot a big &quot;country&quot; or &quot;Americana&quot; person- I was taken by Graham&#39;s (Bo&#39;s) spin on those typically rigidly-held institutions, fusing weird, lofi sounds and risque topics with classic instrumentation associated with those archetypes: acoustic guitar, banjo, slide guitar, piano, etc. \r\n\r\nWhen Graham and I started discussing releasing an album together, I never knew what was going to come of it - but I sure knew it would be an album unlike any other on Wet Cassettes, something I am always striving to find and put out.\r\n\r\nWhile the sounds here will do the talking, GroDie (Graham and his songwriting partner Jesse Threatt) produce a grungey alt-Americana that makes me recall (with my limited knowledge of the scope of these bands): Neutral Milk Hotel, Akron/Family, and Eugene Chadbourne.\r\n\r\nOn &quot;Take Me To Your Bleeder,&quot; you&#39;ll get fat loads of dark humor, whiskey barrels full of pain, soaring instrumental runs, creepy samples, barn burners, foot stompers, and a bunch of indescribable, next-level musicianship in-between. \r\n\r\nHop in and go for a ride into a whole new territory for Wet Cassettes with Jesse and Graham as GroDie.\r\n\r\nWC-034",
