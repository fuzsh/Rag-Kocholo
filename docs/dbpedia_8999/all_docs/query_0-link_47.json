        "text": "I present to you the final part of this special three part review of a trio of rapists from beyond the stars films. Xtro (1982) and Breeders (1986) were the first two I covered.\n\nI first heard of Inseminoid through where else Fangoria magazine. I had a friend in elementary school named Rob who got me into the magazine. He had discovered it and started bringing it to school in the early 80s, and even though I was grossed out by most of the gore shots I was still fascinated. This was during the slasher craze and they covered a lot of slasher films, including the Friday The 13th films. And this was long before I began to discover some of those films were indeed gems. It, at least, gave me a place where I could go to see some cool photos of any monster movies being made, and coming to mind is Q, The Winged Serpent (1982) and The Boogens (1981), which the magazine published some really great shots of. It was this one particular Saturday when I was up Rob’s house, he pulled out all the issues he had and plopped them on the floor; I randomly started thumbing through them, because there were some I didn’t know he had. This is where I saw the article on Inseminoid and was genuinely surprised someone made a movie with that title. Of course with a title like that I just had to know what it was about; the photos pretty much told me all I needed to know. I think at this point it was safe to say I wanted to see this flick now. I don’t remember when I learned the title was changed to Horror Planet in America, but I seem to think it was also in Fangoria.\n\nI ended up eventually catching it on cable, and under the Horror Planet title, again I can’t put a precise date on it, I wish I could, I remember liking it, and being shocked by the birth sequence, and that was due to the utterly believable performance of actress Judy Geeson. The birth involves a convincing portrayal of the kind of insane levels of pain that apparently must be endured by a pregnant chick with no access to pain numbing drugs, plus it’s an alien pregnancy, an added curve ball that probably added to her misery tenfold. Geeson’s screaming was and still is harrowing to watch. Then they cut to two characters in the operation room listening to it over the intercoms and holding each other because they too found it harrowing to listen to. I totally sympathized with their reaction.\n\nMy next memory is when I met Gerry, my best friend for most of high school. Back in the mid-80s we had a Saturday afternoon show called Commander USA’s Groovie Movies that aired on the once-awesome-but-not-anymore USA channel. Commander USA, as I’ve heard, was the inspiration for The Comedian character in Alan Moore’s Watchman comic. Commander USA was played by the late Jim Hendricks, the character was a burned out and jaded superhero that was always smoking a cigar. He hosted the show and the show was known for airing all kinds of weird genre movies. I was spending a Saturday at Gerry’s house when Horror Planet was aired. In fact I think I had slept over and we were in the middle of playing Dungeons & Dragons. I had already told him about the movie and he wanted to see it, but was only interested in seeing the insemination scene. The movie was shot in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and back then when those kinds of flicks made it to TV and cable they were always shown 1.33, and showing a 2.35 flick full frame gives one the impression it was all filmed in close-up. So every once in a while we had to stop playing D&D while Gerry ran down and watched a little bit of the movie waiting for that scene. He came back up and finally told me he saw it. For the longest time I had wrongly assumed the creature was using its own “alien dick” to inseminate Geeson, and when Gerry came back he described what he saw “…it looked like a wet, plastic bag…” I can understand that, showing that scene in 1.33, yeah, it probably did look like wet, plastic bag.\n\nMy next and final memory involves finally seeing it in its proper aspect ratio when Elite Entertainment unexpectedly put it out on DVD here in America in 1999. I think I liked the movie even more seeing all the things I couldn’t see in the full frame cable airing.\n\nInseminoid is set in the future when mankind now has the ability to move out into the universe and explore, and this planet the movie is set on comes with two suns and runs 89-degrees below zero. When I saw this as a kid I took the movie at face value, seeing it again at 50 I wanted to know some things, but they aren’t conveyed in any kind of opening crawl or conversation between characters, like the base this 12-member team of scientists and technicians (6 women, 6 men) are housed in. It’s inside a mountain, or a mountain range, was it deliberately terraformed or did these tunnels already exist and the humans caome in and just added their tech to it? There was an exploratory expedition on the planet beforehand and it was abruptly abandoned, this at least is conveyed in a voice over by Documentation Officer Kate Carson (Stephanie Beacham) after the opening credits, but she doesn’t expound on any details beyond that or why the company sent another team back to the planet.\n\nWhat the previous expedition failed to discover that this one does is a tomb containing hieroglyphics of the previous now extinct civilization, strange crystals and a possible secret chamber. The only two members of this team we never get to know too well are Ricky Williams (David Baxt) and Dean White (Dominic Jephcott). After the opening credits these two are already inside the tomb exploring when an explosion buries the both of them. They manage to dig Ricky out, but don’t find Dean until a little while later, but it doesn’t matter, he’s dead. Sort of. The doc, Karl (Barrie Houghton), can hear a heartbeat, and his staring eyes move. For reasons never explained we’ll see him later in a body bag in a freezer. Okay, so, he died at some point?\n\nRicky feels and looks normal, but he had a handful of these funky crystals in his hand, and these crystals play a part in the movie, but not a very clear part. They glow, interfere with the electricity in the base, and drive Ricky insane. He needs to get back outside and into that tomb because he thinks Dean is still stuck out there, and if you try and stop him he’ll clobber your ass. Kate will end up killing him in self defense as she and Gail (Rosalind Lloyd) have been ordered by base commander, Holly McKay (Jennifer Ashley), to go out and get photos of the tomb.\n\nI’m going to point out this movie has two characters that end up doing something stupid that’ll get either themselves and/or another killed. So, right in the first act, close to the credits we’ve already got two characters who have exited the movie. The next one is Gail herself, after being attacked by crazed Ricky she gets a foot jammed between two pieces of metal on the walkway. She’s also damaged her thermostat, and is in danger of freezing to death. Gary (Steven Grives) tells her from the operations room she needs to re-connect these two wires to get heat, but she panics, refuses to even try, and somehow believes taking the electric saw nearby and cutting her leg off will make things all right. You got to be kidding me?! So, as everyone looks on she pops open her visor, stuffs the oxygen hose in her mouth and begins to saw her ankle off. As predicted she freezes to death.\n\nArticle from Fangoria #12. Click photos to enlarge & read.\n\nHere we are three characters dead now and our main character hasn’t even been inseminated yet. I like the fact the film is never boring. There’s always something right around the corner to keep the story humming along. Speaking of insemination, our two leads are Sandy (Judy Geeson) and her boyfriend, Mark (Robin Clarke). It’s when Sandy and Mitch (Trevor Thomas) are sent into the tomb that shit gets all too real. Everything’s fine actually until they’re done and at the entrance again ready to go back when this alien creature attacks! It kills Mitch, fucks him up bad. His death is filmed in tight shots so you’re not sure how he’s being torn apart. Sandy’s insemination was filmed as if it were some kind dreamy, lucid, acid-like sequence, with her naked on this platform and this alien standing between her spread legs. She’s not raped by an alien dick, but with something that looks like a long test tube of funky liquid pumping through with lumpy things floating in it.\n\nThis alien creature is fleeting; we never get to see the whole thing, mostly from the shoulders up. I was impressed with the design though, done by FX artist Nick Maley (He and his wife also wrote the initial script). When it’s all over Sandy is suddenly in sickbay being treated for whatever happened to her. These “alien crystals” play a part in her sudden homicidal and cannibalistic nature; she’s a woman possessed when the ones they have in a jar in sickbay call to her. She also gets this mysterious wound on her head that slowly spreads along her scalp, you can see it as the movie progresses, her scalp looks more and more bloody, and initially I was perplexed whether the crystals were making her this way or the pregnancy, my guess was it’s a combination of both, but there’s a synopsis in the Image Gallery on the disc that reveals its her pregnancy that’s mutating her form. At any rate she suddenly wants to kill anyone she encounters and her first victim is poor Barbra (Victoria Tennent) who she knifes to death in the bathroom with a pair of scissors. She used whatever she has at hand to kill her comrades—Gary is offed by a portable harpoon handgun; Karl is killed instantly by a barbell to the head; Holly meets her end at the business end of a “touch-burner,” and Kate is immobilized by a small explosive that fucks up her leg as she’s trying to flee, but the worst part of this is after she kills/immobilizes her prey she eats part of them, mostly tearing into their stomachs. And she isn’t beyond eating Dean and Ricky’s corpses in the freezer either. Geeson puts in the best performance of the cast, vacillating between cold-blooded murderer and lucid victim, sometimes in the same scene, before we finally get to her infamous birthing scene I mentioned earlier! Now, once she gives birth I thought somehow she’d become normal again, and the rest of the movie would center on the creepy ass looking twins she popped out of her, but when Mark finds her resting and goes to wake her, she spins around and it’s clear she’s still in murder mode. You can also see in that scene her teeth have subtly began to change too; they look sharper than normal.\n\nThat other character I hinted at that gets retarded and accidentally kills another is Holly. She may be the leader of this group but she does not exude an aura of leadership. It’s during the scene where she, Karl and Sharon find Sandy in the workout room looking very pregnant and writhing in pain when she gets careless. She’s got the “touch-burner” as a weapon, and once Sandy clicks into murder mode again Karl is in the way. You can see Holly all twitchy and unsure and accidentally nails him in the back, this allows a moment for Sandy to kill Karl dead with a barbell. Sandy gets the touch-burner and turns it on Holly, now she’s dead and they’ll find her half-eaten body hanging on a ladder later.\n\nAt this point in the flick Mark, Kate and Sharon (Heather Wright) are the only three left alive, and after Gary’s death earlier Mark had a come-to-Jesus moment where he knows there’s no reasoning with his girlfriend anymore there’s only killing her. Part of this plan involves kidnapping her kids, he hands them off to Sharon and has her secreted away in a room they figure Sandy won’t think to look.\n\nTwo other traits Sandy acquires in her pregnancy, one is the ability to breathe the planet’s intolerable atmosphere, this is how she got to Gary outside, and a boost in strength. I liked how the movie displays here “super strength” realistically too, this helps to show how Mark is finally able to kill her at the end. She’s not invulnerable, if you can just get the drop on her, it’s fairly easy to take her out. After one of their struggles where she manages to take a nice chunk out of his leg, their battle gets him into a room with a weak floor, and he goes through it. Now he gets clever, when she goes around and enters it, he’s hiding behind the door with a bunch of cords in his hand and during their struggle manages to get them around her neck and throttles her to death. There’s this shot where they’re both kneeling next to each other and he’s putting the finishing touches on his murder cord maneuvers, when I first saw this I had this odd moment of reflection, it hits me, Jesus, at the start of this film these two are a loving couple, and now look at them, Mark’s killing her because an alien rape turned her into a killer cannibal! Man, life and it’s curve balls.\n\nI really believed this movie was going to have some survivors, like Mark and Sharon, but then Mark limps back to her and finds one of the alien babies has overpowered Sharon and eaten a fatal hole in her neck! Oh fuckin’ shit! Where’s the other? Mark turns and there it is! The camera zooms in on the second baby’s bloody mouth and we can assume Mark is now pushing up daisies. Fear not true believers Inseminoid comes with an epilogue. In some markets where this was shown the movie ended after the zoom in of that alien babv’s bloody mouth. The epilogue is about a three-man combat mission sent to the planet to find out why there hasn’t been any radio contact for twenty-eight days. The find some of the bodies, but have no clue what unfolded. The last shot is back on the ship where we see the babies have gotten onto and hidden themselves in a trunk. A set-up for a never intended sequel, I guess.\n\nLoved the 2.35 cinematography, and the gore was good without going over the top, back then though it was shocking, nowadays it feels very retrained. I mean you never see Sandy eating any innards. They always show her leaning in, and then leaning back out with a bloody mouth. Had this gotten a remake it would be immensely gruesome I imagine. Actually I wouldn’t mind seeing what a remake would look like. One last thing I realized about this movie is none of the characters ever learn Sandy was impregnated by an alien, we the audience are shown what happened, but she never tells anyone what occurred and no one even thinks to wonder why her pregnancy and birth happen nearly in the blink of an eye, and after she gives birth to obvious alien beings neither Mark or Sharon take a moment to stop and ask themselves what the fuck are these things?\n\nInseminoid is not available on blu-ray in any kind of solo release or in the U.S. This blu-ray I reviewed here is part of a U.K. release from Powerhouse Films that collects the horror flicks of director Norman J. Warren’s films: Bloody Terror: The Shocking Cinema Of Norman J. Warren. I ordered this set this past summer specifically for this movie, making it the single most expensive blu-ray I have ever bought. Inseminoid does not have a distributor in the U.S. so it’s unknown if it’ll ever see a blu-ray release over here. Frankly, I think it eventually will, but if you want this film now you’ll have to buy Powerhouse’s set here on Amazon UK, or on their site. Keep in mind this is a limited edition set, so if you really want it pick it up quick! As of this review it’s still in print. The disc is region free, so you won’t need a region free player to watch it.\n\nUPDATE 8/6/21: The Bloody Terror set is now out of print, and when an Indicator set goes OOP, they eventually put all the films out as standard solo editions later, so Inseminoid is now available in an affordable blu-ray from Indicator and on Amazon UK. If you don’t want to go overseas, you can get Scream Factory’s blu-ray here. They have some of the same extras and new ones, plus reverse cover art. Indicator’s solo blues only come with an advertisement for their other discs on the reverse side of the cover art.\n\n1999 U.S. DVD FROM ELITE ENTERTAINMENT (Out Of Print)\n\nVIDEO/AUDIO/SUBTITLES: 2.35:1 (non-anamorphic) widescreen—2.0 English Dolby Digital (stereo)—No subs\n\nEXTRAS INCLUDED . . .\n\nTheatrical Trailer\n\n(Note: This movie never came in a red case, I just transferred mine to one because I thought it would look cooler, and by God it did!)\n\n2021 U.K. BLU-RAY FROM POWERHOUSE FILMS\n\nVIDEO/AUDIO/SUBTITLES: 1080p 2.35:1 high definition widescreen—2.0 English LPCM (mono)—English SDH subs only.\n\nI have never seen this movie look so great! The restoration they did makes every frame look like a piece of art. Colors, clarity, black levels and so forth are extremely well restored. Below is a page scan from the booklet in the set, each movie has a page of “restoration notes.”\n\nEXTRAS INCLUDED . . .\n\nThe BEHP Interview With Norman J. Warren—Part 2 (1:09:20)\n\nNorman J Warren At The Manchester Festival of Fantastic Films (1:01:50)\n\nSubterranean Universe (44:46)\n\nAlien Encounter (6:02)\n\nElectronic Approach (13:10)\n\nTrailers & TV Spots — Theatrical Trailer #1 (2:13); Theatrical Trailer #2 (1:47); Theatrical Trailer #3 (1:02); French Theatrical Trailer (2:28); Horror Planet Teaser Trailer (:31); TV Spot (:31)\n\nImage Gallery (1:49/110 photos)\n\nAs an added bonus, if you get this set, it comes with a 117-page booklet chronicling all of Warren’s horror movies, and one of the chapters is about the 1981 novelization of Inseminoid that is very different than the movie. Mostly in high sexual content and how the creature is depicted. In the book it’s almost a mindless beast that goes around raping the female crew with its two-pronged dick. Never explained in the movie the alien is supposed be the last of its species, an alien scientist looking to pass its genes on. The book is available on Amazon through third party sellers, if you’re interested in reading it.\n\nAnother reason to get this set is it comes with a very large two-sided poster, one side is of Terror (1978), and the other is Inseminoid. But it’s not any of the posters I added to this review. It was one I had never seen before, most likely one used in the U.K. since if you remember it was shown in the U.S. under Horror Planet.\n\nTwo of the extras in this disc, Subterranean Universe & Electronic Approach, are from the 2004 U.K. DVD set, The Norman J. Warren Collection. The commentary is also from 2004. The interview with actor Trevor Thomas in Alien Encounter is the only brand new 2019 addition. The rest are either from 2004, 2011 and 2018. The BEHP Interview with Norman J Warren – Part Two extra covers not only Inseminoid but a few of his other films as well, and the Norman J Warren at the Manchester Festival of Fantastic Films extra is kind of a bust when it comes to Inseminoid talk. He finally addresses that movie near the end of the interview and only briefly before he’s sidetracked and goes off talking about something else and never goes back to the film. If you’re a fan of Bloody New Year, however, the first 36-minutes you’ll absolutely love. If you’re looking for real in-depth talk about Inseminoid I direct you the 2004 Making Of and the commentary."
