        "text": "I concede maybe I think too much about movies, but I was endeavouring to think about how many movies I've run across •or• know of that have at least 2 versions available. Movies released to theaters or video prior to 2000 where another version or two (or more) have since surfaced. There's quite a lot of them; I'll list the movies I know of but I'm sure I'll miss a bunch of titles, too, so anyone with knowledge of films with more than 2 versions extant please add them. Always good to learn something.\n\n(P.S. I did want to mention it's only movies where the extra footage has been incorporated back in to the film as opposed to being \"bonus footage\" on a disc. For instance, I've got a disc of \"The Howling\" with several minutes worth of extra footage not used in the theatrical release, but it's not incorporated back in to the film so I don't count \"The Howling\" as having any more than 1 version. Same with JAWS. I've got a 2-Tape set of JAWS I bought years ago with loads of bonus features on 'Tape 2', however, the film itself is the same without any additions. I'm not aware of any version extant of JAWS where any previously excised footage was added back in to the film -- but if there is please make a post and let me know. I'd like to buy a version of JAWS with footage put back if there is such a thing. [Same with THE HOWLING]).\n\nPOSSESSION OF VIRGINIA, The (1972-French/Canadian). Filmed in Montreal. (Aka: \"Le diable parmi nous\").\n\nSHIVERS (1975-Canadian) Ever seen the Canadian Tv print of \"Shivers\"?\n\nBROOD, The (1979-Canadian)\n\nLITTLE GIRL WHO LIVES DOWN THE LANE, The (1976-Canadian)\n\nSQUIRM (1976-Slimy Horror) The DVD version adds back the small amount of footage cut to earn \"Squirm\" a [PG]-rating so the disc is 'Unrated', I believe. The Vestron Video tape was [PG], tho.\n\nDEATH WEEKEND (1976-Canadian) (Aka: \"House by the Lake\").\n\nRITUALS (1976-Canadian)\n\nHUMONGOUS (1981-Canadian) The opening rape scene is shortened in the U.S. version; the Canadian ASTRAL VIDEO version is complete.\n\nSTREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, A (1951-Drama)\n\nCARRIE (1952)\n\nSTRANGE ONE, The (1957)\n\nGOD'S LITTLE ACRE (1958)\n\nPUBLIC ENEMY, The (1932)\n\nALAMO, The (1960-Historical Western of sorts . . . ).\n\nIT'S A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD (1963-Comedy)\n\nCHAIRMAN, The (1969)\n\nEYE OF THE CAT (1969-Suspense) The Blu-Ray has the theatrical & 'TV Version's of the film.\n\nSTRAWBERRY STATEMENT, The (1970)\n\nSCREAMS OF A WINTER NIGHT (1979-Horror) Filmed in Louisiana\n\nFAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH (1982) I believe one digital release includes the TV version.\n\nEYES OF FIRE (1983) When America was young and the secret of the early Spirits were living in the trees!\n\nSTAR TREK: The Motion Picture (1979) There's 3 versions I know of.\n\nSTAR TREK 2: The Wrath of Khan (1982) There's 2 versions I'm aware of.\n\nRAINTREE COUNTY (1957) Roadshow Version versus wide-release 'regular' theatrical version.\n\nREQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT (1962) The Columbia VHS is different from the DVD.\n\nSAND PEBBLES, The (1966) Roadshow Version versus 'regular' theatrical version.\n\nSECONDS (1966) The overseas version was released on VHS by Paramount; has nudity.\n\nMAN WHO HAD POWER OVER WOMEN, The (1970-UK) Magnetic Video version was the Tv print; the later Embassy VHS release was the proper theatrical version (with nudity a few cuss words).\n\nDEVILS, The (1971-UK) There's at least 2 versions of \"The Devils\" -- maybe three.\n\nSATANIC RITES OF DRACULA, The (1973-UK)\n\nSEIZURE (1974-Canadian) (aka: \"Queen of Evil\", which runs 4 minutes longer).\n\nSEX SYMBOL, The (1974) U.S. Tvm/Overseas Theatrical Release has a bunch of dirty stuff!\n\nNIGHTMARE IN BADHAM COUNTY (1976) U.S. Tvm/Overseas Theatrical version loaded with sleaze.\n\nTEACHER, The (1974) The 'EP' video release from 'Sterling Entertainment' omits a phone call.\n\nWELCOME TO ARROW BEACH (1974) 99 minutes.

(I need to buy that disc).\n\nMARK OF THE WITCH (1970) The original 'GP' version was issued on VHS; the movie was later released on DVD with a bit of excised [R]-rated footage restored. I bought both versions.\n\nSWARM, The (1978) Theatrical version released in 1978 runs 116 minutes; the 1992 'Expanded Version' runs 155 minutes and seems shorter because the theatrical release had such cho/ppy continuity. Not a good movie, anyway, but the theatrical version is worse than the longer 'cut' Irwin Allen had intended to release back in '78.\n\nWHEN TIME RAN OUT . . . (1980) The U.S. WARNER Home Video VHS release runs 141 minutes; the DVD release only runs 109 minutes. The DVD from Warner was the shortened overseas theatrical cut while the VHS release from Warner in the U.S. was an expanded version with television-only scenes included . . . so you get a large difference in the run time!\n\nSHINING, The (1980) → The overseas theatrical version was cut down by 25 minutes compared to the U.S. theatrical version. 144 minutes versus 119 minutes.\n\nALLIGATOR (1980)\n\nFRIDAY THE 13th (1980)\n\nMY BLOODY VALENTINE (1981-Canadian)\n\nESCAPE TO ATHENA (1979)\n\nAPOCALYPSE NOW (1979)\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK (1977-Musical) 3 versions? Or 4?\n\nTEXASVILLE (1990) The LaserDisc version contains a longer cut of the movie.\n\nSHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT (1986) Spike Lee's 1st movie; LD version is longer.\n\nDOGS OF WAR, The (1980)\n\nFUNHOUSE, The (1981) The \"Tv version\" of \"The Funhouse\", I think, was issued on DVD as a bonus feature.\n\nESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (1981-Action)\n\nONE FROM THE HEART (1982-Stylized Romantic Fantasy)\n\nOUTSIDERS, The (1983•Coming-of-age Drama)\n\nBLOOD SIMPLE (1984) 2 versions of \"Blood Simple\" are extant.\n\nTHIEF OF HEARTS (1984-Sexual Thriller)\n\nDUNE (1984)\n\nRE-ANIMATOR (1985-Horror/Dark Comedy)\n\nBIG (1988-Comedy)\n\nCELLAR, The (1989-Horror)\n\nSEA OF LOVE (1989)\n\nSONNY BOY (1990) The UK version of this film is positively deranged; the U.S. version was watered-down for content.\n\nDANCES WITH WOLVES (1990)\n\nBASIC INSTINCT (1992) The old 'Carolco' Red Box VHS release was uncut.\n\nWYATT EARP (1994)\n\nCRIMSON TIDE (1995) 115m. The 2008 DVD release was expanded to 123 minutes.\n\nJADE (1995) Paramount released 2 versions of \"Jade\" on VHS. In Green boxes, of course.\n\nthat thing you do! (1996) The 'Director's Cut' is much longer.\n\nFORTRESS (1992) Overseas theatrical version had a bit more violence than the U.S. 'cut'.\n\nSTAR WARS (1977) I lost track of how many versions of \"Star Wars\" exist. 6 or 7? Maybe 8?\n\nBLADE RUNNER (1982) I lost track of how many versions exist of 'Blade Runner', too. 7 versions?\n\n----------------------------\n\nThere are also a number of films with different \"TV versions\", but I'm not sure if these particular TV versions were ever released on any homevideo medium? (What happened with ALLIGATOR (1980) is very unusual. The 1983 Catalina Home Video VHS release was the Television version instead of the theatrical print and runs about 8 minutes longer. 92 minutes versus 100 minutes. The 1986 Lightning Video release was the theatrical version of \"Alligator\". → I believe the Blu-Ray disc of \"Alligator\", which was recently released, contains *both* versions of the film).\n\nAnyway, here are some TV versions of some movies I've seen that aren't simply 'edited for content' -- there's alternate footage added: MURDER BY DEATH, BLAZING SADDLES, QUICK CHANGE, AIRPLANE II, FAR & AWAY, BORN IN EAST L.A., CAR WASH (the TV version of \"Car Wash\" is a lot different!), DIARY OF A MAD HOUSEWIFE, SO FINE and who knows how many more Tv versions there are of various films that I don't know of. Maybe SUMMER RENTAL (1985) had a TV version with more footage; it's not a long movie so it's possible there was footage added for a 2-hour television time slot).\n\n→ I'm sure I've missed a bunch of movies that have more than 1 version, but I figured listing these titles was a start.\n\nI only have one version of STAR WARS: The 1982-issue '20th Century Fox Video' VHS tape. I believe that is the most \"un-messed-with\" version of STAR WARS there is. I think . . .\n\nAll posts and fresh titles welcome.\n\nSHIVERS, the 1975 David Cronenberg movie, ran 87 minutes upon its theatrical release. The U.S. Vestron Video release under the title \"They Came From Within\" was the theatrical version with the American title. I think Anchor Bay released \"Shivers\" in the 1990s under its proper Canadian title, too. However . . .\n\nFor some inexplicable reason a Canadian Tv print of SHIVERS was given to the Canadian ASTRAL VIDEO label to release instead of the 'regular' theatrical version. ASTRAL issued \"Shivers\" on tape in a large, narrow elongated clamshell case with insert artwork and there is no indication anywhere on the sleeve art or the videocassette label that this is the television version. But it is. I have the Astral tape and I timed it -- 75 minutes versus 87 minutes -- despite the sleeve art stating the proper theatrical run time on the back. When I first watched the Astral tape the cuts for content came fast and furious at the beginning when the crazy doctor/professor tries to get the 'worm' out of Annabelle Brown. If there are any Canadian video connoisseurs on here and you have the Astral tape of \"Shivers\" check it out and you'll notice right away the missing 'stuff'.\n\nThe TV version on the Astral tape contains no alternate footage -- there's just a LOT of \"objectionable\", non-Tv-friendly content removed. Lynn Lowry's \"everything is sexual\" speech near the end is edited down, for one, and there is of course no explicit violence and no nudity and that's why I listed SHIVERS on the opening post.\n\nAnd THE BROOD, too. ASTRAL was given an edited version of \"The Brood\" as well. I don't think it was a TV print, but apparently, some Canadian Provinces in the '70s had more strict content laws than others and it is possible the print of the \"The Brood\" given to Astral came from a Province where the content standards were stricter. Otherwise, I cannot explain it.\n\nSome of the prints given to Astral were rather head scratching.\n\nHUMONGOUS (1981-Canadian) was released by Astral un-cut with the rape scene intact at the beginning compared to the U.S. version on Embassy where the rape scene was shortened. That was the one difference I noted between the Canadian and U.S. 'cuts' of the film.\n\nSam Peckinpah's PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nBy the time that Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid was in the editing room, Peckinpah's relationship with the studio and his own producers had reached the breaking point. Peckinpah's first cut was 165 minutes.[9] Aubrey, enraged by the cost and production overruns, demanded an unrealistic release date for the film.[9] Peckinpah and his editors, given only three weeks,[9] were forced into a desperate situation in order to finish editing on time. Furthermore, Aubrey still objected to several sequences in the film which he wanted removed, forcing Peckinpah to engage in protracted negotiations over the film's content. Adding to the problems, Bob Dylan had never done a feature film score and Peckinpah's usual composer, Jerry Fielding, was unhappy with being relegated to a minor role in the scoring process.\n\nPeckinpah did complete a preview version of the film at 124 minutes, which was shown to critics on at least one occasion. Martin Scorsese had just made Mean Streets (1973) and was at the screening, and he praised the film as Peckinpah's greatest since The Wild Bunch. This version, however, would not see the light of day for over ten years. Peckinpah was eventually forced out of the production, and Aubrey had the film severely cut from 124 to 106 minutes, resulting in the film being released as a truncated version largely disowned by cast and crew members. This version was a box-office failure, grossing $8 million domestically,[1] of which the studio earned only $2.7 million in theatrical rentals,[10] against a budget of more than $4.6 million. However, the film grossed a total of $11 million worldwide.[1]\n\nIn 1988, Turner Home Entertainment, with distribution by MGM, released Peckinpah's preview version of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid on video and Laserdisc. This version led to a rediscovery and reevaluation of the film, with many critics praising it as a lost masterpiece and proof of Peckinpah's vision as a filmmaker at this time. The film's reputation has grown substantially since this version was released, and the film has come to be regarded as something of a modern classic, equal in many ways to Peckinpah's earlier films.[19] Kristofferson noted in an interview, though, that Peckinpah had felt that Dylan had been pushed on him by the studio and thus left \"Knocking on Heaven's Door\" out of the preview version. In Kristofferson's opinion, \"Heaven's Door\" \"was the strongest use of music that I had ever seen in a film. Unfortunately Sam…had a blind spot there.\"[20]\n\nIn 2005, a DVD of the film distributed by Warner Bros. was released containing the preview version as well as a new special edition which combined elements of the theatrical version, the preview version, and several new scenes never released in the previous versions. This third version of the film, known as the \"special edition\", runs slightly shorter than the preview version.[21]\n\n----------------------------\n\nRe: \"Knocking On Heaven's Door\"\n\nThe sequence Kristofferson talks about with Slim Pickens and Katy Jurado by the river is one of Sam's most moving and beautiful scenes.\n\nI expect you're right, Grand Ennui. There's so many movies with different Tv versions it's a task to keep track of them all.\n\nThe TV version of SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT (1977) has 1 extra scene right after Jerry Reed is chasing after Fred the dog after Fred goes for a swim in the pond after eating the cheeseburger.\n\nAnd then there's the very different Tv version of SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT, Part 3 (1983). I taped the Tv version of Part 3 at one time in the 1990s, but taped over it several years later. I shouldn't have done that, but I did. Ack! The Tv version of Part 3 had a LOT of overdubbing of Jackie Gleason's voice. And lots of footage was added for the television print to pad out the run time after all the content cuts were made. SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT, Part 3 was about the dirtiest [PG]-movie you'll ever see. I think if it would've been released in mid-1984 it would've netted a brand new [PG-13]-rating. The scenes in the sex hotel with Gleason and Henry prowling around looking for the 'Enos Fish' was quite bawdy for a [PG]-rated film. And at the nudist camp as well.\n\nThe two TV versions I really regret not taping were AIRPLANE II and QUICK CHANGE. I saw them both on television many moons ago and foolishly did not tape them. I'd gladly buy the television versions of both films were they available.\n\nI specifically remember 'Hugh Gillin, Jr.'s part as the 'Texan' in AIRPLANE II was mostly gone in the theatrical version -- he says \"Howdy, girl\" to a stewardess when boarding the plane and that's his only line, but the Tv print featured his character in some gags. One at the airport and the other on the plane. After watching the Tv version I thought the theatrical version was rather poorly edited because it cut out some funny stuff seen in the TV print -- the run time of AIRPLANE II was only 84 minutes or so and should've been longer."
