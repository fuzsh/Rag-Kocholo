Finally you can try to change the channels eg. i like channel 3 b/c it doesnt interfere with any phone lines.\n\ngood luck\n\nsmeags.\n\nAnonymous\n\n139 Answers\n\nSOURCE: I can't get my new Vista computer to connect to my wireless network\n\nI experienced a similar problem with a Vista laptop a few weeks ago. There were no apparent problems, so I uninstalled the wireless network adapter from the Windows \"device manager\" and then let it automatically reinstall the wireless adapter when it rebooted. The local wireless network appeared about 5 minutes after the reboot and has been working ever since.\n\nIf that doesn't help, try removing the Linksys software from your computer and try the network adapter remove/reinstall again.\n\nSOURCE: connecting 2 wireless routers\n\nAs a wi-fi technician, it is not recommended to extend the wireless signal using another wireless router. Having 2 wireless routers will just cause conflict to your wireless network. If you still have time, please replace the router with a Wireless Access Point (WAP54G). WAP is easy to setup. Just plug it to one of the ethernet port on the back of your router and run the setup CD that came with it, that's it. It'll extend your signal.\n\nIf your main concern is just extending your wireless signal to another far place outside your house, Wireless Range Expander (WRE54G) can also be used. It is a similar device like an Access Point but its signal extending capability is more powerful than Access Point. Its also easy to setup, just the setup CD that came with it.\n\nYou can also contact the Linksys toll free tech support # at 1800-3267114 if you wanna resolve the issue over the phone. Hope that helps.\n\n-Regards"
