        "text": "The wine industry has evolved thanks to the introduction of digital technologies in every aspect of the wine production chain and the emerging need of the food industry for qualitative, sustainable, and safe products. As a result, the incorporation of digital services that facilitate access to related data of wine products is crucial for wine enterprises to increase their competitiveness, customer loyalty, and market share in this highly competitive domain. In this work, we present the Message-in-a-Bottle (MiB) ecosystem, which exploits multi-dimensional and multi-sourced data for creating engaging and interactive stories around wine labels. We especially focus on the sustainability and safety issues in the wine industry and showcase how MiB addresses them. The ecosystem is developed in the context of the MiB project and has already started to be available in the market through the Lyrarakis wine enterprise.\n\nThe wine industry has evolved thanks to the introduction of new technologies (e.g., sensors, digital tools). Since the competition in the wine sector is extremely high, transparency via digital means is one of the methods that wine enterprises employ to increase their competitiveness, customer loyalty, and market share. The MiB system, developed in the frame of the MiB project, is created as a digital tool which exploits different types of data (e.g., sensors, ERP systems) to offer transparency and better informativeness regarding the different wine labels. As the system will go into the market, the amount of data will increase by time and the need for content management will become more apparent. In this paper, we present the Admin UI Application of the MiB project, which offers a full content management facility for authorized users (producers or wine enterprises).\n\nWine tourism has long since ceased to be just a visit to wine producing regions and wineries, just to taste or buy wine. In fact, wine tourism has become more complex as a tourist product, due to the requirement of visitors to obtain a differentiated experience, composed of multiple elements Wine tourism activities consist of, above all, wine tastings and cellar, wine house and wine museum visits. Currently, and in the future, wine tourism has provided and boosted the creation of genuine and unique tourist experiences, more and more differentiated tailor made. This preliminary approach aims to evaluate the role of wine storytell-ing as an antecedent in the wine tourism experience, namely on other constructs as winescape attributes, sensorial attraction, wine excitement and cultural experience. A range of practical implications are provided for wine tourism managers, marketers and wine guided tours namely on the importance on the training the storytelling skill by the wine cellars staff. The new vogue of wine tourism forces us to challenge and re-visit the power relationships that exist within contemporary tourism and the host-guest relationship. As an interdisciplinary approach, this research contributes positively to the development of theory in relationship marketing and tourism contexts in wine management (theoretical implications). At the end, guidelines for future work will be presented.\n\nThis chapter introduces us to the concept and practice of e-storytelling in the wine industry as one of the most powerful marketing tools that can be both brand and customer driven; the relationship between wine storytelling and wine tourism destination storytelling; the people who make the wine and their family stories; and the most common technical options in wine storytelling. Digital storytelling is more than just using technology; it is a way of communicating, integrating, and imagining. Wine is a product unlike any other in wine tourism, inextricably linked to the region, its soil, climate, and geomorphology, as well as the local people, their history, traditional cultivation methods, taste, and culture. As a result, sharing the story of a winery is inextricably linked to sharing the story of a wine tourism destination."
