        "text": "Public television network in West Virginia\n\nWest Virginia Public Broadcasting (WVPB) is the public television and radio state network serving the U.S. state of West Virginia. It is owned by the West Virginia Public Broadcasting Authority, an agency of the state government that holds the licenses for all Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) member stations licensed in West Virginia. It is headquartered in Charleston with studios in Morgantown and Beckley.\n\nOn January 1, 2015, West Virginia PBS and West Virginia Public Radio merged their brands, branding exclusively as \"West Virginia Public Broadcasting\" across radio and television.[1]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first public television station in West Virginia signed on July 14, 1969 under the callsign WMUL-TV, broadcasting from Marshall University in Huntington. In 1981, WMUL-TV changed its call letters to WPBY-TV;[2] two years later, the public station at West Virginia University in Morgantown, WWVU-TV, was renamed WNPB-TV.[3] WPBY-TV and WNPB-TV received their new call letters to underline that the operations were managed by the state educational broadcasting authority, and not the university system. In 1992, the state completed a microwave link that permitted it to convert WNPB and the state's third PBS station, WSWP-TV in Grandview to become repeaters of WPBY-TV in Huntington and form a state network. On January 5, 2015, WPBY-TV changed its call letters to WVPB-TV[2] as part of an effort to unify all of West Virginia Public Broadcasting's services under a single brand; the television network had previously been branded as \"West Virginia PBS\", a name that was phased out starting on January 1, 2015.[4]\n\nThe state network has a total of five low-powered repeaters serving other areas out of the range of the three full-powered stations, most notably Wheeling and Parkersburg. Three directly repeat WNPB, one repeats WVPB and one repeats WSWP.\n\nIn the past the network showed some Marshall University and West Virginia University sports content, but has abandoned this practice due to Conference USA/Big 12 exclusivity agreements with commercial and cable outlets.\n\nThe current local content consists of a daily recap of the state legislative session, shows produced by the West Virginia University medical school, and student produced news from campus weekly products from Marshall University and West Virginia State University. It also broadcasts original documentaries on West Virginia history and culture, as well as live musical performances of Mountain Stage and the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame.\n\nThe combined footprint of WVPB's television network covers almost all of West Virginia, as well as portions of Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. It is carried on the basic tier of all cable systems in West Virginia.\n\nTV stations\n\n[edit]\n\nStation City of license\n\n(other cities served) Channels\n\n(RF/VC) First air date Call letters' meaning Former callsigns ERP HAAT Facility ID Transmitter coordinates Public license information WVPB-TV[a] Huntington\n\n(Charleston) 9 (VHF)\n\n33 July 14, 1969 (55 years ago) ( ) West Virginia Public Broadcasting WMUL-TV\n\n(1969–1981)\n\nWPBY-TV\n\n(1981–2015) 23 kW 358.1 m (1,175 ft) 71657 Public file\n\nLMS WSWP-TV Grandview\n\n(Beckley/Bluefield) 8 (VHF)\n\n9 November 1, 1970 (53 years ago) ( ) Southern West Virginia Public Television 8.8 kW (STA)\n\n29.9 kW (CP) 280.1 m (919 ft) (STA)\n\n292.6 m (960 ft) (CP) 71680 Public file\n\nLMS WNPB-TV Morgantown\n\n(Clarksburg/Weston/\n\nFairmont) 34 (UHF)\n\n24 February 23, 1969 (55 years ago) ( ) (Northern) West Virginia Public Broadcasting WWVU-TV\n\n(1969–1983) 660 kW 448.1 m (1,470 ft) 71676 Public file\n\nLMS\n\nNotes:\n\nTranslators\n\n[edit]\n\nCity of license Callsign Translating Channel ERP HAAT Facility ID Transmitter coordinates Owner Cedarville W28DR-D WSWP-TV 9 28 10.1 kW 185 m (607 ft) 181586 West Virginia Educational Broadcasting Authority Keyser W16DT-D WNPB-TV 24 16[5] 15 kW 24.4 m (80 ft) 167356 Martinsburg W27EE-D 27 0.3 kW 271 m (889 ft) 167357 Moorefield W22CV-D 22 0.095 kW 995 m (3,264 ft) 127707 Valley TV Cooperative, Inc.

Operations on W08EE-D (Martinsburg) and W30CO-D (Wheeling) resumed on August 10, 2016, while the licenses for W07DN-D (Wardensville), W09CT-D (Mathias), and W41AO (Hampshire) were surrendered to the FCC for cancellation on May 26, 2017.\n\nDigital television\n\n[edit]\n\nSubchannels\n\n[edit]\n\nAll digital signals are multiplexed:\n\nWest Virginia Public Broadcasting multiplex[7] Channel Res.

The station's digital channel allocations post-transition are as follows:[9]\n\nWPBY-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 33; the station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 34,[10] using virtual channel 33.\n\nWSWP-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 9; the station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 53, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to VHF channel 10,[11] using virtual channel 9.\n\nWNPB-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 24; the station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 33,[12] using virtual channel 24.\n\nRadio\n\n[edit]\n\nWVPB's state radio network includes eleven full-powered stations and seven low-powered translators, all on the FM band. The state network carries programs from NPR, PRI and other distributors, as well as classical and folk music. WVPB produces original weekly programs, including EclecTopia, A Change of Tune, Inside Appalachia and Sidetracks, plus the nationally distributed Mountain Stage. The network was known as \"West Virginia Public Radio\" until WVPB's 2015 transition to a single brand.[4]\n\nFM stations\n\n[edit]\n\nCall sign Frequency City of license Facility ID Class ERP\n\n(W) Height\n\n(m (ft)) Transmitter coordinates WVBY 91.7 FM Beckley 71689 B 10,400 280 m (920 ft) WVBL 88.5 FM Bluefield 173309 B 50,000 31.5 m (103 ft) WVPW 88.9 FM Buckhannon 71687 B 14,000 259 m (850 ft) WVPB[a] 88.5 FM Charleston 70604 B 44,000 134.2 m (440 ft) WVWV 89.9 FM Huntington 71656 B 8,100 355 m (1,165 ft) WVEP 88.9 FM Martinsburg 70643 B 3,600 473 m (1,552 ft) WVKM 106.7 FM Matewan 67039 C3 4,300 229 m (751 ft) WVPM 90.9 FM Morgantown 70645 B 5,000 439 m (1,440 ft) WVPG 90.3 FM Parkersburg 70642 B1 9,000 98 m (322 ft) WVDS 89.5 FM Petersburg 71659 B 10,000 321.9 m (1,056 ft) WSHC[b] 89.7 FM Shepherdstown 71678 A 950 −3 m (−10 ft) WVWS 89.3 FM Webster Springs 176879 A 850 265 m (869 ft) WVNP 89.9 FM Wheeling 71658 B 25,000 152 m (499 ft)\n\nNotes:\n\nTranslators\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to five low-powered, separate-frequency translators, two low-powered boosters also extend coverage.
