        "text": "Everybody wants there to be effective reading instruction in all classrooms. But often there is not. Why? What are the causes of ineffective reading instruction? This podcast identifies two common causes. https://lnkd.in/g8nipD4W\n\nA common theme throughout this episode is disruptive student behavior impeding the learning of others. If you - or someone you know - would like to join my podcast to discuss ideas, methods, etc. for systemically improving this dynamic, please DM me. https://lnkd.in/gxp3tY2U\n\nWith the recent release of Ofstedâ€™s latest guidance- â€˜Best start in life Part 2â€™ and the start of the new school year, now more than ever is a time to reflect upon our practice and the focus on the prime areas. The research is clear, a strong educational foundation with a clear focus on the prime areas are crucial to childrenâ€™s early learning and their later success in education and life. So, are they at the forefront of your mind? Do your routines, timetables and curriculum design reflect the importance of the Prime Areas? By prioritising the Prime Areas, and allocating sufficient time and resources, we can ensure that children get the best start to their early education. ðŸŽ§ Listen to podcast: 'Prime Time?' - https://lnkd.in/ezFNTkcZ ðŸ’¡Download Guidance: https://lnkd.in/eYPaN6NS"
