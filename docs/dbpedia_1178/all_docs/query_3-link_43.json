Dr. Gelblum completed his neurology residency and post-graduate fellowship training at the University of Miami. His clinical practice was established in 1992. He has successfully treated thousands of patients over a quarter-century, from South Florida, and around the world. He is considered a global thought leader in the neurologic treatment of dementia, seizure disorders, Parkinson’s, Diabetic and Peripheral Nerve Disorder, Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy, Covid Long-Hauler, trauma, and chronic pain, and has hosted educational symposia in the U.S. and overseas.\n\nDr. Gelblum maintains numerous research FDA-sponsored affiliations, providing patients immediate access to promising new treatment protocols. His practice maintains an academic affiliation with the medical residency programs of Nova Southeast and Florida International University. He trains future neurologists, so it is not unusual to encounter student doctors in the office.\n\nDr. Gelblum serves as an expert consultant to the State of Florida and the Federal Court system on matters of neurologic injury and disability. He is active in multiple community outreach programs to educate the public regarding the care and treatment of neurologic disorders. He has pioneered the use of TeleHealth and other e-medicine technology to provide patients with instant medical access. Complementary modalities and alternative care are part of his holistic approach to successful neurologic care.\n\nListening first, with a compassionate and thoughtful response thereafter, is the philosophy of his renowned clinical practice.\n\nRead about Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP).\n\nRead about Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) or transthyretin (TTR) amyloid polyneuropathy.\n\nRead Treating Hereditary ATTR Amyloidosis with Polyneuropathy.\n\nDownload Dr. Jeffrey Gelblum's CV (Curriculum Vitae)\n\nConsultant for Neurology:\n\nActivis Pharmaceuticals, Dublin, Ireland – Pharmaceutical development\n\nAffiliated Research Centers, Chicago, IL – Phase III FDA investigator\n\nAvanir Pharmaceuticals, Aliso Viejo, CA – Pharmaceutical development\n\nAstra Zeneca – Amyloid neuropathy\n\nEisai – Alzheimer's drug development\n\nFlorida Medical Quality Assurance, Inc., (PRO), Tampa, FL\n\nFlorida Division of Workers Compensation – Expert medical advisor\n\nGerson Lehrman Group, Austin Texas – Neurology Consultant\n\nGuidepoint Consultants– Neurology Consultant\n\nInternational Association Special Investigation Units – Fraudulent Electrodiagnosis\n\nOtsuka Pharmaceuticals, Tokyo – Pharmaceutical development\n\nState Farm Mutual, Bloomington, IL – Fraud and abuse\n\nUn Sourire Pour Espoir, Cerebral Palsy Clinic, Paris, France\n\nUCB Pharma- Anticonvulsant development\n\nAlnylam Pharma, California – Hereditary amyloid neuropathy\n\nAmbry Genetics/Konika Minolta – Genetic testing for neuropathy\n\nNational State of Reform Health Policy Conference – May 2021 “TeleHealth Innovations”\n\nAlzheimer’s Network for Treatment and Diagnostics – Vanguard Site designation\n\nBloomberg Media\n\nLife Molecular Imaging- Amyloid Alzheimer’s PET Scan\n\nFirst Coast Medicare Administrative Contractor (Florida MAC)\n\nMedico-legal Neurologic Forensic Consultant:\n\nUS Department of Justice – Plaintiff and Defense Expert\n\nState Civil Litigation -- Plaintiff and Defense Expert\n\nState Criminal Litigation – Plaintiff and Defense Expert\n\nGuardianship and Testamentary Capacity, Life-care Analysis\n\n(Elkins list upon request)\n\nPreceptorships:\n\nAlzheimer's recognition, treatment, long-term care\n\nAnticonvulsant Applications\n\nMigraine/Pain Management\n\nPublications:\n\nGelblum, JB, Et al.
