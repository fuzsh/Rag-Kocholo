The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:30 p.m. in room 418, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Thom Tillis, presiding. Present: Senators Boozman, Rounds, Tillis, Tester, Murray, and Brown. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. THOM TILLIS, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA Senator Tillis. I call the hearing to order. Thank you all for being here. Senator Isakson is out today and I will be standing in. Senator Boozman is at a meeting where he should be joining us and taking the gavel shortly. We all continue to wish the very best for Senator Isakson who is recovering from back surgery. He submitted a statement in a prior meeting. Although the reality is I am wearing this bow tie, which is a University of Georgia bow tie, because I am repaying a bet that I lost, but since I am sitting in his chair for a little bit today I am going to say I am doing it in honor of Senator Isakson. I would like to welcome the witnesses. Then, we are going to defer to Senator Tester to allow him to make his opening statement. He has a meeting outside, in the anteroom, which we will let him move to. I want to thank the witnesses on the panel today. Senator Tester, I will wait until after your opening statement, in the interest of time, to introduce the witnesses. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, RANKING MEMBER, U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA Senator Tester. Thank you, Chairman Tillis. I very much appreciate the hospitality, and thank you all for being here today. As many of you know, we had a hearing on GAO's High-Risk List a few weeks ago at the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. During the questioning of the Comptroller, Gene Dodaro, who is a guy that I like a lot, who works really tirelessly to help agencies work more effectively and save taxpayer dollars, he told me that he was very concerned about the VA's reaction to its inclusion on the list. Chief among his concerns is that the VA did not seem to move--did not seem overly interested in doing what it takes to be removed from that High-Risk List. Now that is something that should concern the panelists and something that should concern everybody. Dr. Clancy, I would love to hear from you whether the VA is being productive in addressing those GAO concerns and whether there is an appropriate sense of urgency, because, I want to tell you, the fact that the VA has not fully met the action plan for getting off the list is worrisome in and of itself. Meanwhile, recent reports from the VA Inspector General, including one about VA in Montana that was released late last week, indicate that the problems that caused GAO to add it to this list are still occurring. According to that report--and the IG is here--according to that report, the IG found that steps have been taken to improve consult time, in addition, and address factors that contribute to future delays at Fort Harrison in Montana, but that is little solace to the four veterans who are identified in that report as being potentially harmed by the consult backlog. On behalf of them and the veterans seeking care at facilities across this country, we need to do better, the VA has to do better. I think you guys realize that, but I want you to know. I will hold everybody at the VA accountable for this. Secretary Shulkin knows this, and he also knows we will hold everybody in the leadership team accountable too, including the team at Fort Harrison. If done right, VA's action and response to the GAO concerns can leave that agency and, more importantly, the veterans of this country in a better place, which is what we want. We want the best services and care for our veterans. I want to thank you again for calling this hearing. It is always good to work with the good Senator from North Carolina. This is an important topic and I think it has bipartisan support. Senator Tillis. Thank you, Senator Tester. We are welcoming to the panel today Debra Draper, Ph.D., Director, Health Care Team, Government Accountability Office; Michael Missal, Inspector General, Department of Veterans Affairs. I think that he is accompanied by Dr. John Daigh--did I pronounce that correctly?--Assistant Inspector General for Healthcare Inspections, Office of the Inspector General; Carolyn M. Clancy, M.D., Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Organizational Excellence, Department of Veterans Affairs; Jennifer Lee, M.D., Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Services, Department of Veterans Affairs; and Amy Parker, Executive Director of Operations, Office of Management, Department of Veterans Affairs. If you all would like to begin with your opening statements; we will just go from left to right. If we can keep those tight so we can get to questions I would appreciate it. STATEMENT OF DEBRA A. DRAPER, Ph.D., DIRECTOR, HEALTH CARE TEAM, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE Ms. Draper. Chairman Tillis, Ranking Member Tester, and Members of the Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss the status of veterans' health care as a high-risk area. In my testimony today, I will focus on the concerns that led to this designation, what actions VA has taken in response, and what additional actions are needed to ensure progress and eventual removal from the list. Veterans' health care was added to GAO's High-Risk List for the first time in 2015, because of concerns about VA's ability to ensure the timeliness, cost-effectiveness, quality, and safety of the care provided to veterans. In designating veterans' health care as high risk, we categorize our specific concerns into five categories: (1) ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes; (2) inadequate oversight and accountability: (3) information technology challenges; (4) inadequate training for VA staff; and (5) unclear resource needs and allocation priorities. At the time, we were also concerned that VA had not implemented more than 100 GAO recommendations related to veterans' health care, and many had been open for three or more years. Last month, as we do every 2 years, at the start of each new Congress, we updated our High-Risk List and reported on progress made by each area on our list, including veterans' health care. We assess progress and potential for removal from the list based on five criteria: leadership commitment; capacity, in terms of people and resources; an action plan; monitoring; and demonstrated progress. Our assessment is that VA has taken some, albeit exceedingly limited actions, to address the concerns that led to its high-risk designation. For example, some leadership actions have been taken, including the establishment of a task force, working groups, and a governance structure to address the concerns. Additionally, VA leadership provided us with an action plan in August, in which they acknowledged the deep- rooted nature of the concerns and stated that addressing these would require substantial time and work. Based on these actions, we concluded that VA had partially met the high-risk removal criteria of leadership commitment and an action plan, and had made no progress with regard to the other three criteria: capacity; monitoring; and demonstrated progress. I want to be very clear that even in the areas where VA has made some progress, there is a long path toward fully meeting the criteria. For example, the action plan submitted to us lacked many critical elements, including an analysis of the root causes for each of the categories of concern, a critical step to better understanding why the problem exists, and what specifically needs to be addressed; reasonable timelines, given the significant scope of the efforts needed; clear metrics necessary for measuring and monitoring progress; and finally, the plan lacked an assessment of the resources needed for implementation. We also continue to be concerned about the large number of open recommendations, and while VA has taken actions to address some of these, considerable work remains. As I noted at the time of its high-risk designation in 2015, VA had more than 100 open GAO recommendations related to veterans' health care. Seventy-four new recommendations have been added since then. Currently, there are still more than 100 open recommendations and about a quarter of these have been open for three or more years. It is critical that VA resolve our recommendations in a timely manner, not only to remedy the specific weaknesses identified but because they may be symptomatic of larger underlying problems that also need to be addressed. There are a number of actions that VA needs to immediately take to move forward. The most important of these are ensuring strong, department-level leadership support; developing a robust action plan that provides a clear roadmap for what needs to be done, when it will be done, how progress will be measured, and what resources are needed to ensure successful implementation; integrating VA's response to its high-risk designation with other initiatives such as the Secretary's 10- point plan; and resolving open recommendations in a timely manner. We are very concerned about VA's exceedingly slow pace of progress. Unfortunately, as of today, VA is not much further ahead at addressing the concerns that led to its high risk designation than it was 2 years ago. The lack of progress raises several important questions, including how seriously VA is taking this, whether the right people with the right skills are being tasked to address the high risk concerns, and whether the overall responsibility for achieving removal from the High- Risk List is at the right organizational level within VA. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my opening remarks. I would be happy to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Draper follows:] Prepared Statement of Debra A. Draper, Director, Health Care, U.S. Government Accountability Office Chairman Isakson, Ranking Member Tester, and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to be here today to discuss the status of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) actions to address the concerns that led to the high-risk designation we made related to VA health care. We added managing risks and improving VA health care to our High Risk List in 2015 due to our concern about VA's ability to ensure the cost-effective and efficient use of resources to improve the timeliness, quality, and safety of health care for veterans.\\1\\ We expressed continued concerns about VA health care in our 2017 high-risk report.\\2\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ GAO, High Risk Series: An Update, GAO 15 290 (Washington, DC: Feb. 11, 2015). \\2\\ GAO, High Risk Series: Progress on Many High-Risk Areas, While Substantial Efforts Needed on Others, GAO 17 317 (Washington, DC: Feb. 15, 2017). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- VA's Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in the Nation, with 168 medical centers and more than 1,000 outpatient facilities organized into regional networks. VA has faced a growing demand by veterans for its health care services--due, in part, to servicemembers returning from military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and the needs of an aging veteran population--and that trend is expected to continue. The total number of veteran enrollees in VA's health care system rose from 7.9 million to almost 9 million from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2016. Over that same period, VHA's total budgetary resources have increased substantially, from $37.8 billion in fiscal year 2006 to $91.2 billion in fiscal year 2016. Although VA's budget and enrollees have substantially increased for at least a decade, there have been numerous reports during this same period--by us, VA's Office of the Inspector General, and others--of VA facilities failing to provide timely health care.\\3\\ In some cases, the delays in care or VA's failure to provide care at all reportedly have resulted in harm to veterans. In response to these serious and longstanding problems with access to VA health care, the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 was enacted, which provided temporary authority and $10 billion in funding through August 7, 2017 (or sooner, if those funds are exhausted) for veterans to obtain health care services from community (non-VA) providers to address long wait times, lengthy travel distances, or other challenges they may face accessing VA health care.\\4\\ Under this authority, VA introduced the Veterans Choice Program in November 2014, which offers veterans the option to receive hospital care and medical services from a non-VA provider when a VA facility cannot provide an appointment within 30 days, or when veterans reside more than 40 miles from the nearest VA facility.\\5\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ See, for example, GAO, VA Health Care: Actions Needed to Improve Newly Enrolled Veterans' Access to Primary Care, GAO 16 328 (Washington, DC: Mar. 18, 2016) and GAO, VA Mental Health: Clearer Guidance on Access Policies and Wait-Time Data Needed, GAO 16 24 (Washington, DC: Oct. 28, 2015). See also, for example, Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General, Veterans Health Administration, Review of Alleged Patient Deaths, Patient Wait Times, and Scheduling Practices at the Phoenix VA Health Care System, Report No. 14-02603-267 (Washington, DC: Aug. 26, 2014) and VA, Department of Veterans Affairs Access Audit, System-Wide Review of Access, Results of Access Audit Conducted May 12, 2014, through June 3, 2014. \\4\\ Pub. L. No. 113-146, 128 Stat. 1754. The $10 billion is meant to supplement VA's medical services budget and is funded through a separate appropriations account, the Veterans Choice Fund. The 2014 law also appropriated $5 billion to expand VA's capacity to deliver care to veterans by hiring additional clinicians and improving the physical infrastructure of VA's medical facilities. \\5\\ VA has purchased care from non-VA community providers through its care in the community programs since as early as 1945. VHA has numerous programs, including the Veterans Choice Program, through which it purchases VA care in the community services. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition to concerns about timely access to care, VA faces challenges regarding the reliability, transparency, and consistency of its budget estimates for medical services, as well as weaknesses in tracking obligations for medical services and estimating budgetary needs for future years. These challenges were evident in June 2015, when VA requested additional funds from Congress because agency officials projected a fiscal year 2015 funding gap of about $3 billion in its medical services appropriation account.\\6\\ The projected funding gap was largely due to administrative weaknesses that slowed the utilization of the Veterans Choice Program in fiscal year 2015 and resulted in higher-than-expected demand for VA's previously established VA community care programs.\\7\\ To address the projected funding gap in fiscal year 2015, the VA Budget and Choice Improvement Act provided VA temporary authority to use up to $3.3 billion from the Veterans Choice Program appropriation for obligations incurred for other specified medical services.\\8\\ In our June 2016 report on VA's health care budget, we reported that VA officials anticipated requesting another increase in funding for health care services in the budget request for fiscal year 2018.\\9\\ Over the course of fiscal year 2016, utilization of the Veterans Choice Program increased considerably, and the Veterans Choice Fund had a $4.5 billion remaining balance at the start of fiscal year 2017 to cover community care services.\\10\\ However, in February 2017, a VA official told us that VA would need an estimated $2 billion in addition to its fiscal year 2018 advance appropriation of about $70 billion to continue providing services.\\11\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\6\\ See GAO, VA's Health Care Budget: In Response to a Projected Funding Gap in Fiscal Year 2015, VA Has Made Efforts to Better Manage Future Budgets, GAO 16 584 (Washington, DC: Jun. 3, 2016). In our 2016 report, the projected funding gap refers to the period in fiscal year 2015 when VA's obligations for medical services were projected to exceed its available budget authority for that purpose for that year. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from incurring obligations in excess of available budget authority. 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(a). An evaluation of whether an Antideficiency Act violation occurred in fiscal year 2015 was outside the scope of our work. \\7\\ In particular, VA officials expected that the Veterans Choice Program would absorb much of the increased demand from veterans for health care services delivered by non-VA providers, but instead the slow utilization resulted in veterans continuing to receive care through previously established VA community care programs that drew funds from VA's medical services appropriation account. \\8\\ Pub. L. No. 114-41, Tit. IV, Sec. 4004, 129 Stat. 443, 463-464 (2015). Specifically, VA was authorized to use the Veterans Choice Program appropriation to cover obligations incurred for the other specified medical services starting May 1, 2015, until October 1, 2015. \\9\\ See GAO 16 584. \\10\\ At the start of fiscal year 2016, VA issued a policy memorandum to its VAMCs requiring them to offer eligible veterans referrals to the Veterans Choice Program before they authorize care through VA's previously established community care programs. \\11\\ Each year, Congress provides funding for VA health care through the appropriations process. Specifically, Congress provides appropriations for the coming fiscal year (which begins October 1 of that year), as well as an advance appropriation for the following fiscal year. VA's advance appropriation for fiscal year 2018 was enacted on September 29, 2016. Pub. L. No. 114-223, 130 Stat. 857, 869 (2016). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- My statement today, which is based on our February 2017 High-Risk Series: Progress on Many High-Risk Areas, While Substantial Efforts Needed on Others, will address (1) actions VA has taken over the past 2 years to address the areas of concern that led us to place VA health care on our High-Risk List in 2015, (2) the number of open GAO recommendations related to VA health care, and (3) additional actions VA needs to take to address the concerns that led to the high-risk designation. We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. background Since 1990, we have regularly reported on government operations that we have identified as high risk due to their vulnerability to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges. Our high- risk program--which is intended to help inform the congressional oversight agenda and to guide efforts of the administration and agencies to improve government performance--has brought much-needed focus to problems impeding effective government and costing billions of dollars. In 1990, we designated 14 high-risk areas. Since then, generally coinciding with the start of each new Congress, we have reported on the status of progress to address previously designated high-risk areas, determined whether any areas could be removed or consolidated, and identified new high-risk areas. Since 1990, a total of 60 different areas have appeared on the High-Risk List, 24 areas have been removed, and 2 areas have been consolidated. On average, high-risk areas that have been removed from the list remained on it for 9 years after they were initially added. Our experience has shown that the key elements needed to make progress in high-risk areas are top-level attention by the administration and agency leaders grounded in the five criteria for removal from the High- Risk List, as well as any needed congressional action. The five criteria for removal that we issued in November 2000 are as follows:\\12\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\12\\ GAO, Determining Performance and Accountability Challenges and High Risks, GAO 01 159SP (Washington, DC: November 2000). Leadership Commitment. The agency demonstrates strong commitment and top leadership support. Capacity. The agency has the capacity (i.e., people and resources) to resolve the risk(s). Action Plan. A corrective action plan exists that defines the root cause and solutions, and provides for substantially completing corrective measures, including steps necessary to implement solutions we recommended. Monitoring. A program has been instituted to monitor and independently validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective measures. Demonstrated Progress. The agency is able to demonstrate progress in implementing corrective measures and in resolving the high- risk area. These five criteria form a road map for efforts to improve and ultimately address high-risk issues. Addressing some of the criteria leads to progress, while satisfying all of the criteria is central to removal from the list. In our April 2016 report, we provided additional information on how agencies had made progress addressing high-risk issues.\\13\\ Figure 1 shows the five criteria for removal for a designated high-risk area and examples of actions taken by agencies as cited in that report. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\13\\ GAO, High-Risk Series: Key Actions to Make Progress Addressing High-Risk Issues, GAO 16 480R (Washington, DC: Apr. 25, 2016). [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Importantly, the actions listed are not ``stand alone'' efforts taken in isolation from other actions to address high-risk issues. That is, actions taken under one criterion may also be important in meeting other criteria. For example, top leadership can demonstrate its commitment by establishing a corrective action plan including long-term priorities and goals to address the high-risk issue and using data to gauge progress--actions which are also vital to monitoring criteria. va has made limited progress in addressing the concerns that led to the 2015 va health care high-risk designation VA officials have expressed their commitment to addressing the concerns that led to the high-risk designation for VA health care. As part of our work for the 2017 high-risk report, we identified actions VA had taken, such as establishing a task force, working groups, and a governance structure for addressing the five areas of concern contributing to the designation: (1) ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes; (2) inadequate oversight and accountability; (3) information technology (IT) challenges; (4) inadequate training for VA staff; and (5) unclear resource needs and allocation priorities. For example, in July 2016, VA chartered the GAO High Risk List Area Task Force for Managing Risk and Improving VA Health Care to develop and oversee implementation of VA's plan to address the root causes of the five areas of concern we identified in 2015. VA's task force and associated working groups are responsible for developing and executing the department's high-risk mitigation plan for each of the five areas of concern we identified. VA also executed two contracts with a total value of $7.8 million to support its actions to address the concerns behind the high-risk designation. These contracts--with the MITRE Corporation and Atlas Research, LLC--are intended to provide additional support for actions such as developing and executing an action plan, creating a plan to enhance VA's capacity to manage the five areas, and assisting with establishing the management functions necessary to oversee the five high-risk-area working groups. On August 18, 2016, VA provided us with an action plan that acknowledged the deep-rooted nature of the areas of concern, and stated that these concerns would require substantial time and work to address. Although the action plan outlined some steps VA plans to take over the next several years to address the concerns that led to its high-risk designation, several sections were missing critical actions that would support our criteria for removal from the High-Risk List, such as analyzing the root causes of the issues and measuring progress with clear metrics. In our feedback to VHA on drafts of its action plan, we highlighted these missing actions and also stressed the need for specific timelines and an assessment of needed resources for implementation. For example, VA plans to use staff from various sources, including contractors and temporarily detailed employees, to support its high-risk-area working groups, so it is important for VA to ensure that these efforts are sufficiently resourced. Overall Rating for Managing Risks and Improving VA Health Care As we reported in the February 2017 high-risk report, when we applied the five criteria for High-Risk List removal to each of the areas of concern, we determined that VA has partially met two of the five criteria: leadership commitment and an action plan. VA has not met the other three criteria for removal: capacity to address the areas of concern, monitoring implementation of corrective actions, and demonstrating progress. It is worth noting that although both criteria were rated as partially met, the department made significantly less progress in developing a viable action plan than it has in demonstrating leadership commitment. Specifically, VA partially met the action plan criterion for only one of the five areas of concern-- ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes--whereas VA partially met the leadership commitment criterion for four out of five areas of concern. The following is a summary of the progress VA has made in addressing the five criteria for removal from the High-Risk List for each of the five areas of concern we identified.\\14\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\14\\ For more detailed analysis of VA's actions in each of the five areas of concern, see GAO 17 317. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ambiguous Policies and Inconsistent Processes Summary of concern. When we designated VA health care as a high- risk area in 2015, we reported that ambiguous VA policies led to inconsistent processes at local VA medical facilities, which may have posed risks for veterans' access to VA health care. Since then, we highlighted the inconsistent application of policies in two recent reports examining mental health and primary care access at VA medical facilities in 2015 and 2016, respectively.\\15\\ In both reports, we found wide variation in the time that veterans waited for primary and mental health care, which was in part caused by a lack of clear, updated policies for appointment scheduling; therefore, we recommended that VA update these policies. These ambiguous policies contributed to errors made by appointment schedulers, which led to inconsistent and unreliable wait-time data. For mental health, we also found that two policies conflicted, leading to confusion among VA medical center staff as to which wait-time policy to follow. In 2015, VA resolved this policy conflict by revising its mental health handbook, but other inconsistent applications of mental health policy have not yet been addressed, such as our recommendation to issue guidance about the definitions used to calculate veteran appointment wait times, and communicate any changes to those definitions within and outside VHA. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\15\\ See GAO, VA Health Care: Actions Needed to Improve Newly Enrolled Veterans' Access to Primary Care, GAO 16 328 (Washington, DC: Mar. 18, 2016); and GAO, VA Mental Health: Clearer Guidance on Access Policies and Wait-Time Data Needed, GAO 16 24 (Washington, DC: Oct. 28, 2015). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2017 assessment of VA's progress. Based on actions taken since 2015, VA has partially met our criteria for removal from the High-Risk List for this area of concern for leadership commitment and action plan. VA has partially met the leadership commitment criterion because it established a framework for developing and reviewing policies--with the goal of ensuring greater consistency and clarity--and set goals for making the policy-development process more efficient. VA has partially met the action plan criterion for this high-risk area of concern because its action plan described an analysis of the root causes of problems related to ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes, an important aspect of an action plan. However, VA has not met our criteria for removal from the High-Risk List for capacity, monitoring, and demonstrated progress for this area of concern because it has not addressed gaps that exist between its stated goals and available resources, addressed inconsistent application of policies at the local level, or demonstrated that its actions are linked to identified root causes. Inadequate Oversight and Accountability Summary of concern. In our 2015 high-risk report, we found that VA had problems holding its facilities accountable for their performance because it relied on self-reported data from facilities, its oversight activities were not sufficiently focused on compliance, and it did not routinely assess policy implementation. We continued to find a lack of oversight in our October 2015 review of the efficiency and timeliness of VA's primary care. For example, we found inaccuracies in VA's data on primary care panel sizes, which are used to help medical centers manage their workload and ensure that veterans receive timely and efficient care.\\16\\ We found that while VA's primary care panel management policy required facilities to ensure the reliability of their panel size data, it did not assign responsibility for verifying data reliability to regional- or national-level officials or require them to use the data for monitoring purposes. As a result, VA could not be assured that local panel size data were reliable, or know whether its medical centers had met VA's goals for efficient, timely, and quality care. We recommended that VA incorporate an oversight process in its primary care panel management policy that assigns responsibility, as appropriate, to regional networks and to VA's central office for verifying and monitoring panel sizes. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\16\\ GAO, VA Primary Care: Improved Oversight Needed to Better Ensure Timely Access and Efficient Delivery of Care, GAO 16 83 (Washington, DC: Oct. 8, 2015). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2017 assessment of VA's progress. VA has partially met the leadership commitment criterion for this area of concern because it established a high-level governance structure and adopted a new model to guide the department's oversight and accountability activities. However, VA has not met our criteria for removal from the High-Risk List for capacity, action plan, monitoring, or demonstrated progress for this area of concern because the department continues to rely on existing processes that contribute to inadequate oversight and accountability. Information Technology Challenges Summary of concern. In our 2015 high-risk report, we identified limitations in the capacity of VA's existing IT systems, including the outdated, inefficient nature of certain systems and a lack of system interoperability as contributors to VA's IT challenges related to VA health care. We have continued to report on the importance of VA working with the Department of Defense to achieve electronic health record interoperability. In August 2015, we reported on the status of these interoperability efforts and noted that the departments had engaged in several near-term efforts focused on expanding interoperability between their existing electronic health record systems. However, we were concerned by the lack of outcome-oriented goals and metrics that would more clearly define what VA and the Department of Defense aim to achieve from their interoperability efforts. Accordingly, we recommended that the departments establish a timeframe for identifying outcome-oriented metrics and define related goals for achieving interoperability. In February 2017, we reported that VA has begun to define an approach for identifying outcome- oriented metrics focused on health outcomes in selected clinical areas, and it also has begun to establish baseline measurements.\\17\\ We intend to continue monitoring the departments' efforts to determine how these metrics define and measure the results achieved by interoperability between the departments. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\17\\ GAO, Veterans Affairs Information Technology: Management Attention Needed to Improve Critical System Modernizations, Consolidate Data Centers, and Retire Legacy Systems, GAO 17 408T (Washington, DC: Feb. 7, 2017). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2017 assessment of VA's progress. VA has partially met our leadership commitment criterion by involving top leadership from VA's Office of Information & Technology in this area of concern, but it has not met our four remaining criteria for removing IT challenges from the High-Risk List. For example, VA has not demonstrated improvement in several capacity actions, such as establishing specific responsibilities for its new functions, improving collaboration between internal and external stakeholders, and addressing skill gaps. VA also needs to conduct a root cause analysis that would help identify and prioritize critical actions and outcomes to address IT challenges. Inadequate Training for VA Staff Summary of concern. When identifying this area of concern in our 2015 high-risk report, we described several gaps in VA's training, as well as burdensome training requirements. We have continued to find these issues in our subsequent work. For example, in our December 2016 report on VHA's human resources (HR) capacity, we found that VA's competency assessment tool did not address two of the three personnel systems under which VHA staff may be hired.\\18\\ We recommended that VHA (1) develop a comprehensive competency assessment tool for H.R. staff that evaluates knowledge of all three of VHA's personnel systems and (2) ensure that all VHA H.R. staff complete it so that VHA may use the data to identify and address competency gaps among H.R. staff. Without such a tool, VHA will have limited insights into the abilities of its H.R. staff and will be ill-positioned to provide necessary support and training. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\18\\ GAO, Veterans Health Administration: Management Attention Is Needed to Address Systemic, Long-standing Human Capital Challenges, GAO 17 30 (Washington, DC: Dec. 23, 2016). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2017 assessment of VA's progress. VA has not met any of our criteria for removing this area of concern from the High-Risk List. VA intends to establish a comprehensive health care training management policy and a mandatory annual training process; however, as of December 2016, VA officials said they had not begun drafting a new policy to replace an outdated document from 2002 that contains training requirements that are no longer relevant. The high-level nature of the descriptions in the action plan and lack of action to update outdated policies and set goals for improving training shows that VA lacks leadership commitment to address the concerns that led to our inclusion of this area in the 2015 high-risk report. Unclear Resource Needs and Allocation Priorities Summary of concern. In our 2015 high-risk report, we described gaps in the availability of data needed for VA to identify the resources it needs and ensure they are effectively allocated across VA's health care system as contributors to our concern about unclear resource needs and allocation priorities. We have continued to report on this concern. For example, in our September 2016 report on VHA's organizational structure, we found that VA devoted significant time, effort, and funds to generate recommendations for organizational structure changes intended to improve the efficiency of VHA operations.\\19\\ However, the department then either did not act or acted slowly to implement the recommendations. Without robust processes for evaluating and implementing recommendations, there was little assurance that VHA's delivery of health care to the Nation's veterans would improve. We recommended that VA develop a process to ensure that it evaluates organizational structure recommendations resulting from internal and external reviews of VHA. This process should include documenting decisions and assigning officials or offices responsibility for ensuring that approved recommendations are implemented. We concluded that such a process would help VA ensure that it is using resources efficiently, monitoring and evaluating implementation, and holding officials accountable. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\19\\ GAO, VA Health Care: Processes to Evaluate, Implement, and Monitor Organizational Structure Changes Needed, GAO 16 803 (Washington, DC: Sept. 27, 2016). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2017 assessment of VA's progress. VA's actions have partially met our criterion for leadership commitment but not met the other four criteria for removing this area of concern from the High Risk List. VA's planned actions do not make clear how VHA, as the agency managing VA health care, is or will be incorporated into VA's new framework for the strategic planning and budgeting process.\\20\\ It is also not clear how the framework will be communicated and reflected at the regional network and medical center levels. VA also has not identified what resources may be necessary to establish and maintain new functions at the national and local levels, or established performance measures based on a root cause analysis of its unclear resource needs and allocation priorities. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\20\\ In its action plan, VA reported adopting a framework in 2016 called ``Managing for Results'' to better connect VA's requirements setting process (that forecasts veterans' needs) with its process for developing the department's budget. VA stated that full implementation of the framework will take place over several budget cycles. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- more than 100 gao recommendations for improving va health care remain open Since we added VA health care to our High-Risk List in 2015, VA's leadership has increased its focus on implementing our prior recommendations, but additional work is still needed. Between January 2010 and February 2015 (when we first designated VA health care as a high-risk area), we made 178 recommendations to VA related to VA health care. When we made our designation in 2015, the department only had implemented about 22 percent of them.\\21\\ Since February 2015, we have made 74 new recommendations to VA related to VA health care, for a total of 252 recommendations from January 1, 2010 through February 15, 2017 (when we issued the 2017 high-risk report).\\22\\ VA has implemented about 50 percent of these recommendations. However, there continue to be more than 100 open recommendations related to VA health care, almost a quarter of which have remained open for 3 or more years.\\23\\ We believe that it is critical that VA implement our recommendations not only to remedy the specific weaknesses we previously identified, but because they may be symptomatic of larger underlying problems that also need to be addressed. Since the 2015 high-risk report, we have made new recommendations to VA relating to each of the five areas of concern. (See table 1.) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\21\\ Of the 178 recommendations, 134 were open because VA had not yet implemented them. Additionally, 39 had been closed because VA implemented them, and 5 had been closed without VA implementing them. We close recommendations without agencies having implemented them primarily if the recommendation is no longer valid because circumstances have changed. \\22\\ See GAO 17 317. \\23\\ Specifically, 112 recommendations are open because VA has not yet implemented them, 25 of which have been open for 3 or more years. In addition, 127 recommendations were closed because VA implemented them, and 13 were closed without VA implementing them.

GAO 17 473T. * Recommendation counts listed include both implemented and not implemented recommendations as of the dates indicated. sustained leadership support and strategic focus needed to meet high-risk removal criteria VA has taken an important step toward addressing our criteria for removal from the High-Risk List by establishing the leadership structure necessary to ensure that actions related to the High-Risk List are prioritized within the department. It is imperative, however, that VA demonstrate strong leadership support as it continues its transition under a new administration, address weaknesses in its action plan, and continue to implement our open recommendations. As a new administration sets its priorities, VA will need to integrate those priorities with its high-risk-related actions, and facilitate their implementation at the local level through strategies that link strategic goals to actions and guidance. In its action plan, VA separated its discussion of department-wide initiatives, like MyVA, from its description of High-Risk List mitigation strategies.\\24\\ We do not view high-risk mitigation strategies as separate from other department initiatives; actions to address the High-Risk List can, and should be, integrated in VA's existing activities. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\24\\ According to VA, MyVA intends to make changes to VA's systems and structures to (1) improve the veteran experience, (2) improve the employee experience, (3) achieve support services excellence, (4) establish a culture of continuous performance improvement, and (5) enhance strategic partnerships. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- VA's action plan did not adequately address the concerns that led to the high-risk designation because it lacked root cause analyses for most areas of concern, as well as clear metrics and identified resources needed for achieving VA's stated outcomes. This is especially evident in VA's plans to address the IT and training areas of concern. In addition, with the increased use of community care programs, it is imperative that VA's action plan include a discussion of the role of community care in decisions related to policies, oversight, IT, training, and resource needs. VA will also need to demonstrate that it has the capacity to sustain efforts by devoting appropriate resources-- including people, training, and funds--to address the high-risk challenges we identified. Until VA addresses these serious underlying weaknesses, it will be difficult for the department to effectively and efficiently implement improvements addressing the five areas of concern that led to the high-risk designation. We will continue to monitor VA's institutional capacity to fully implement an action plan and sustain needed changes in all five of our areas of concern. To the extent we can, we will continue to provide feedback to VA officials on VA's action plan and areas where they need to focus their attention. Additionally, we have ongoing work focusing on VA health care that will provide important insights on progress, including the policy development and dissemination process, implementation and monitoring of VA's opioid safety, Veterans Choice Program implementation, physician recruitment and retention, and processes for enrolling veterans in VA health care. Finally, we plan to also continue to monitor VA's efforts to implement our recommendations and recommendations from other reviews such as the Commission on Care.\\25\\ To this end, we believe that the following GAO recommendations require VA's immediate attention: \\25\\ The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 established the Commission on Care to examine, assess, and report on veterans' access to VA health care and to strategically examine how best to organize VHA, locate health resources, and deliver health care to veterans during the next 20 years. The Commission's June 2016 report to the President included 18 recommendations to improve veterans' access to care and, more broadly, to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of that care. On September 1, 2016, the President concurred with 15 of the 18 recommendations and directed VA to implement them. improving oversight of access to timely medical appointments, including the development of wait-time measures that are more reliable and not prone to user error or manipulation, as well as ensuring that medical centers consistently and accurately implement VHA's scheduling policy. improving oversight of VA community care to ensure--among other things--timely payment to community providers. improving planning, deployment, and oversight of VA/VHA IT systems, including identifying outcome-oriented metrics and defining goals for interoperability with DOD. ensuring that recommendations resulting from internal and external reviews of VHA's organizational structure are evaluated for implementation. This process should include the documentation of decisions and assigning officials or offices responsibility for ensuring that approved recommendations are implemented. Moreover, it is critical that Congress maintain its focus on oversight of VA health care to help address this high-risk area. Congressional committees responsible for authorizing and overseeing VA health care programs held more than 70 hearings in 2015 and 2016 to examine and address VA health care challenges. As VA continues to change its health care service delivery in the coming years, some changes may require congressional action--such as VA's planned consolidation of community care programs after the Veterans Choice Program expires. Sustained congressional attention to these issues will help ensure that VA continues to improve its management and delivery of health care services to veterans. Chairman Isakson, Ranking Member Tester, and Members of the Committee, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have. Senator Tillis. Thank you. Mr. Missal. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL J. MISSAL, INSPECTOR GENERAL, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS; ACCOMPANIED BY JOHN D. DAIGH, JR., M.D., CPA, ASSISTANT INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR HEALTHCARE INSPECTIONS, OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL Mr. Missal. Senator Tillis and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the work of the VA Office of Inspector General and how we provide effective oversight of VA programs and operations through independent audits, inspections, and investigations. I am accompanied by Dr. David Daigh, the Assistant Inspector General for Healthcare Inspections. The OIG seeks to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse and make meaningful recommendations to drive economy, efficiency, and effectiveness throughout VA's programs and operations. Our goal is to undertake impactful work that will assist VA in providing the appropriate and timely services and benefits that veterans so deservedly earned and ensuring the proper expenditure of taxpayer funds. I have had the great privilege of serving as the Inspector General since May 2, 2016. Since that time, I have fully immersed myself in the work, priorities, and policies of the OIG. We have made a number of enhancements since I started, in an effort to do more impactful work in a timelier manner. The OIG shares a similar mission with GAO. It is important that we have a strong relationship with GAO, to ensure we avoid duplication of effort as much as possible. To that end, one of the first things I did when I started was to meet with Comptroller General Dodaro, Dr. Draper, and his other senior staff. Our offices have had a number of communications since that time to promote coordination and more effective oversight of VA. GAO added VA health care to its biannual High-Risk List in 2015, and it remains on the High-Risk List that was just issued in 2017. GAO focused its concern in five broad areas. While our work is determined by what we believe is the most effective oversight of VA, a number of our reports addressed concerns in these same five areas. My written statement includes examples of OIG work in each of the areas that resulted in GAO placing VA health care on its High-Risk List. It should be noted that many of the OIG's reports could fit into more than one area. I will highlight a few of those reports now. We have issued a number of reports in the past few years that include VA's ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes. For example, our review of the Health Eligibility Center determined that VA had not effectively managed its business processes to ensure the consistent creation and maintenance of essential health care eligibility data. Proper oversight by management would ensure that programs and operations would work effectively and efficiently. Our September 2016 report on the Denver replacement medical center is an extremely costly example of the result of inadequate oversight. Through all phases of the project, we identified various factors that significantly contributed to delays and rising costs. This occurred due to a series of questionable business decisions and mismanagement by VA senior officials, resulting in a project years behind schedule and costing more than twice the initial budget of $800 million. We have frequently identified VA struggles to design, procure, and/or implement functional IT systems. IT security is continually reported as a material weakness in VA's consolidated financial statements. Moreover, VA has a high number of legacy IT systems needing replacement. Furthermore, after years of effort focused on replacement of VA's legacy scheduling software, a new scheduling system is still not in place. VA's issues with scheduling software are related to the inability to define its requirements and determine if a commercial solution is available or if it must design the system. One prevailing theme of the OIG's work related to wait times and scheduling issues was the inadequate, lack of, or incorrect training provided to VA staff responsible for scheduling appointments. As we have stated in reports that have been issued since the allegations at the Phoenix VA health care system surfaced in April 2014, the lack of training for schedulers, the lack of understanding of the process by their managers, and, in some cases, the disregard of VA scheduling policies created a system where services have not been provided timely, and in some situations, wait times were not accurately portrayed. VA needs to accurately forecast the demand for health care services in both the near term and the long term. In conclusion, the OIG is committed to providing effective oversight of the programs and operations of VA. We will continue to produce reports that provide VA, Congress, and the public with recommendations that we believe will help VA operate its programs and services in a manner that will effectively and timely deliver services and benefits to veterans and spend taxpayer money appropriately. Senator Tillis, this concludes my statement. Dr. Daigh and I would be happy to answer questions that you or other Members of the Committee may have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Missal follows:] Prepared Statement of Michael J. Missal, Inspector General, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Tester, and Members of the Committee, Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the work of the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) and how the OIG provides effective oversight of VA programs and operations through independent audits, inspections, and investigations. The OIG seeks to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse, and make meaningful recommendations to drive economy, efficiency, and effectiveness throughout VA programs and operations. Our goal is to undertake impactful work that will assist VA in providing the appropriate and timely services and benefits that veterans so deservedly earned, and ensuring the proper expenditure of taxpayer funds. I am accompanied by John D. Daigh, Jr., M.D., CPA, Assistant Inspector General for Healthcare Inspections. I have had the great privilege of serving as the Inspector General since May 2, 2016. Since that time, I have fully immersed myself in the work, priorities, and policies of the OIG. We have made a number of enhancements since I started, including issuing a Mission, Vision, and Values statement; increasing transparency; creating a Rapid Response team in our Healthcare Inspections directorate; expanding our data analytics capabilities; and being more proactive in our review areas. I believe that these changes, as well as other enhancements we will make, will enable us to do additional impactful work in a more timely manner. The OIG shares an analogous mission with the Government Accountability Office (GAO). It is important that the VA OIG has a strong relationship with GAO to ensure that we avoid duplication of effort as much as possible. To that end, one of the first things I did when I started was to meet with Comptroller General Dodaro and some of his senior staff. Our offices have communicated regularly since that time to promote coordination and more effective oversight of VA. In February 2015, GAO added Managing Risks and Improving VA Health Care to its biannual High Risk list. It focused its concerns in five broad areas: Ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes, Inadequate oversight and accountability, Information technology challenges, Inadequate training for VA staff, and Unclear resource needs and allocation priorities. While our work is determined by what we believe is the most effective oversight of VA, a number of our reports address concerns in these same five areas. I will highlight a sampling of OIG work in each of the areas that resulted in GAO placing VA Health Care on its High Risk list. However, it should be noted that many of the OIG's reports could fit in more than one area. ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes We have issued a number of reports in the past few years that include VA's ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes. Our recent report \\1\\ on wait time in one specific Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN), we assessed the reliability of wait time data and timely access within VISN 6 which includes VHA facilities in North Carolina and Virginia. The objective of the audit was to determine whether VISN 6 facilities provided new patients timely access to health care within its medical facilities and through Choice, as well as to determine whether VISN 6 facilities appropriately managed consults. We reported that veterans who were authorized Choice care in VISN 6 did not consistently receive the authorized health care within 30 days as required by Health Net's contract with VA. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Audit of Veteran Wait Time Data, Choice Access, and Consult Management in VISN 6, March 2, 2017 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- We reviewed a statistical sample of 389 Choice authorizations provided to Health Net by VISN 6 medical facility staff during the first quarter of Fiscal Year (FY) 2016. Based on our sample results, we estimated that for the approximately 34,200 veterans who were authorized Choice care in VISN 6, approximately 22,500 veterans who received Choice care waited an average of 84 days to get their care through Health Net providers. We estimated it took VA medical facility staff an average of 42 days to provide the authorization to Health Net to begin the Choice process and an additional 42 days for veterans to receive the medical service through Health Net providers. We identified delays related to authorizations for primary care, mental health care, and specialty care. VHA's Chief Business Officer addressed a potential cause for delay in creating appointments by executing a contract modification effective November 1, 2015. This change allowed Health Net to initiate phone contact with a veteran to arrange a Choice appointment, rather than require the veteran to contact Health Net as previous required. Our analysis showed that, while still untimely, this change lowered the percentage of veterans who waited more than 5 days for Health Net to create an appointment from 86 percent to 69 percent. The Under Secretary for Health concurred with our 10 recommendations and provided a responsive action plan and milestones to address the recommendations regarding monitoring controls over scheduling requirements, wait time data, and access to health care and consult management. Our recommendations will help ensure staff use clinically indicated and preferred appointment dates consistently, medical facilities conduct required scheduler audits, and staffing resources are adequate to ensure timely access to health care. The report's recommendations remain open. Another example, in September 2015, we reported in Review of Alleged Mismanagement at the Health Eligibility Center that VA's Chief Business Office (CBO) had not effectively managed its business processes to ensure the consistent creation and maintenance of essential health care eligibility data. Due to the amount and age of the Enrollment System (ES) data, as well as lead times required to develop and implement software solutions, a multiyear project management plan was needed to address the accuracy of pending ES records and improve the usefulness of ES data. We offered 13 recommendations in the report including one focused on controls to ensure that future enrollment data are accurate and reliable before being entered into the Enrollment System. VA concurred with the recommendations and provided sufficient information to close all recommendations in October 2016. We have an ongoing review of the Health Eligibility Center focusing on the alleged lack of effective governance over the Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) execution of the health care enrollment program at its medical facilities. We expect to issue our report in late spring 2017. Another program that operates nationwide also had issues related to inconsistent implementation of policies is the Homeless Grant Per Diem Program. In a June 2015 report, Audit of Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Case Management Oversight, we determined VA needed to clarify eligibility requirements across the program to ensure that all homeless veterans have equal access to case management services. Historically, homeless veterans ineligible for VA health care have not been excluded from the program. However, we questioned the application of the program's eligibility criteria, and found the criteria were unclear and inconsistently applied. This was confirmed in our interviews of VA's Office of General Counsel, program directors, network homeless coordinators, and liaisons, which revealed confusion occurred at all program levels. We made five recommendations, three of which involved establishing a definitive legal standard on program eligibility and ensuring that policies and controls matched that standard and were applied across the program. The recommendations dealing with policies and controls remain open. inadequate oversight and accountability Proper oversight by management ensures that programs and operations would work effectively and efficiently. Our September 2016 report, Review of the Replacement of the Denver Medical Center, Eastern Colorado Health Care System, on the management of the construction of a new VA medical center in the Denver area, is an extremely costly example of the result of inadequate oversight. We confirmed the project to build a new medical center in the Denver area has experienced significant and unnecessary cost overruns and schedule slippages. Originally estimated for 2013 completion, it will not be ready before mid-to-late 2018, about 20 years after its need was identified. Through all phases of the project, we identified various factors that significantly contributed to delays and rising costs, including: Inadequate planning and design, Initiation of the construction phase without adequate design plans, Changing the acquisition strategy mid-stream, and Untimely change request processing. This occurred due to a series of questionable business decisions and mismanagement by VA senior officials. The report summarizes the significant management decisions and factors that resulted in a project years behind schedule and costing more than twice the initial budget of $800 million. We made five recommendations and VA management concurred with all recommendations. We recently requested information from VA on the implementation status of the recommendations and will keep them open until VA provides satisfactory evidence of implementation. In June 2016, we issued a report on allegations related to appointment cancellations at the Houston VA Medical Center, titled Review of Alleged Manipulation of Appointment Cancellations at VA Medical Center, Houston, Texas. We substantiated that two previous scheduling supervisors and a current director of two outpatient clinics instructed staff to input clinic cancellations incorrectly as canceled by the patient. We also confirmed that a current director of two CBOCs instructed staff, as recently as February 2016, to record an appointment as canceled by the patient if clinic staff at one CBOC offered to reschedule a veteran's appointment at a different CBOC situated about 17 miles away and the veteran declined the appointment. The CBOC Director noted this was appropriate since the CBOC was still offering the patient an appointment. However, when interviewed regarding these cancellations, the CBOC Director acknowledged she instructed staff to cancel appointments by the patient if the veteran declined an appointment in the alternate location. We made six recommendations, including referring the matter to VA's Office of Accountability Review (OAR), to determine what, if any, administrative actions should be taken based on the factual circumstances developed in our report. In December 2014, we released an audit related to VA's National Call Center for homeless veterans, titled Audit of The National Call Center for Homeless Veterans. We reported that homeless and at-risk veterans who contacted the Call Center often experienced problems accessing a counselor and/or receiving a referral after completing the Call Center's intake process. We reported: Veterans could leave a message on an answering machine only 27 percent of the time period reviewed, Veteran messages were not referred to VA medical facilities due to inaudible messages or no contact information in 16 percent of the time period reviewed, Veterans were not referred to VA medical facilities despite providing all the necessary information in 4 percent of the time period we reviewed. Moreover, the Call Center closed approximately 47 percent of referrals even though the VA medical facilities had not provided the Homeless veterans any support services. These missed opportunities occurred due to lapses in the Call Center's management and oversight. We made seven recommendations, including implementing effective performance metrics to ensure homeless veterans receive needed services. We closed our report in September 2015 based on information received that all recommendations had been implemented. information technology challenges As we reported in our list of VA's Major Management Challenges within VA's Annual Financial Report, we have frequently identified VA's struggles to design, procure, and/or implement functional information technology (IT) systems. IT security is continually reported as a material weakness in the Consolidated Financial Statement audits that are conducted annually by the OIG's independent auditing firm, CliftonLarsonAllen (CLA). VA has a high number of legacy systems needing replacement including the Financial Management System; Integrated Funds Distribution, Control Point Activity, Accounting and Procurement system; Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture, and the Benefits Delivery Network; After years of effort focused on replacement of VA's legacy scheduling software, a new scheduling system is still not in place. VA's issues with scheduling appointments are related to the inability to define its requirements and determine if a commercial solution is available or if it must design a system. Replacing systems has been a major challenge across the government and is not unique to VA. We have issued a number of reports outlining access issues and our work in this area is continuing. While the difficulties between VA's electronic health record (EHR) and the Department of Defense's EHR are well documented, the increased utilization of care in the community will present further IT challenges. To ensure that medical providers both inside and outside VA have the most complete and up-to-date information, VA needs to find a more effective method for sharing patients' EHRs. We reported on the possibility of delays in care because of the difficulties in sharing medical records in the Urology Clinic at the Phoenix VA Health Care System in our October 2015 report, titled Healthcare Inspection, Access to Urology Service, Phoenix VA Health Care System, Phoenix, Arizona. Specifically, we identified approved authorizations for non-VA care coordination (NVCC) urological care and a notation that an authorization was sent to the non-VA provider. A scheduled date and time of an appointment with the non-VA urologist was often documented. However, we were unable to locate scanned documents from non-VA providers in these patients' EHRs verifying that the patients had been seen for evaluations, and if seen, what the evaluations might have revealed. This finding suggested that the Phoenix VA Health Care System (PVAHCS) did not have accurate data on the clinical status of the patients who were referred for the specialty care. Further, with respect to scanning and reviewing outside clinical documents (for example, clinic notes, labs, or imaging results), when the services were provided by TriWest Health Care Alliance (TriWest), the treating providers' office submitted this data to the TriWest Portal. To access that information, an NVCC staff member was required to log into the TriWest Portal to print and scan these records into the patients EHRs. This process was delayed because of the NVCC staffing shortages, which could have resulted in important clinical information not being reviewed for several months. We made three recommendations, including one specifically related to ensuring that non-VA care providers' clinical documentation is available in the EHRs in a timely manner for PVAHCS providers to review. We closed our report in June 2016 after VA provided information that addressed the recommendations. In the area of IT security, VA uses personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), and other sensitive information to deliver benefits to veterans and their dependents. Employees and contractors must safeguard this information. As we reported in our September 2015 report, Review of Alleged Data Sharing Violations at VA's Palo Alto Health Care System, the VA Palo Alto Health Care System (VAPAHCS) did not ensure that contract staff had the appropriate background investigations or proper security and privacy awareness training before being granted access to VA patient information. Additionally, facility Information Security Officers were not involved prior to the contractor placing its software on a VA server. We made three recommendations to VAPAHCS management and a fourth recommendation that VA's Office of Information Technology implement controls to ensure that unauthorized software is not procured or installed on VA networks without a formal risk assessment and approval to operate. We closed our report based on information provided that the recommendations were implemented. inadequate training for va staff One prevailing theme of the OIG's work related to wait times and scheduling issues was the inadequate, lack of, or incorrect training provided to VA staff responsible for scheduling appointments. We conducted extensive work related to allegations of wait time manipulation through FY 2015 and FY 2016 after the allegations at the PVAHCS surfaced in April 2014. As we have reported in more than 90 Administrative Summaries of Investigation and other reports that have been issued, the lack of training for schedulers and the lack of understanding of the process by their managers created a system in which long wait times were not accurately portrayed to management. In October 2016, we reported again that some confusion persists regarding appointments. The focus for this report was on consult management. In our report, Review of Alleged Consult Mismanagement at the Phoenix VA Health Care System, we substantiated that in 2015, PVAHCS staff inappropriately discontinued consults. We determined that staff inappropriately discontinued 24 percent of specialty care consults we reviewed. This occurred because staff were generally unclear about specific consult management procedures, and services varied in their procedures and consult management responsibilities. As a result, patients did not receive the requested care or they encountered delays in care. This report offered 14 recommendations including ensuring that staff are hired and trained appropriately. We are tracking VA's progress on implementing all the recommendations. In January 2016, we determined that VHA did not provide medical facilities with adequate tools to reasonably estimate non-VA care (NVC) obligations in our report, Audit of Non-VA Medical Care Obligations. The facilities we visited used a combination of methods that were ineffective at ensuring NVC cost estimates were reasonable. The methods used to calculate estimated costs included Medicare or contract rates, historical costs, and the optional cost estimation tools provided by CBO. The accuracy of estimates varied widely among these methodologies. We made five recommendations including for VA to improve the cost estimate tools so that NVC cost estimates are produced consistently. The recommendations related to cost estimate tools remain open. unclear resource needs and allocations priorities In March 2017, we published Consult Delays and Management Concerns, VA Montana Healthcare System, Fort Harrison, MT. We assessed the extent that patients experienced delays in obtaining consults, and the impact of any delays on patient outcomes. We reported that, for system consults ordered through VA Montana Healthcare System in FY 2015, there were apparent delays \\2\\ for: \\2\\ We considered delayed consults to be those that were not completed, canceled or discontinued within the expected timeframe. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11,073 of 26,293 patients (42 percent) with at least one in-house consult; 11,863 of 21,221 patients (56 percent) with at least one non-VA care consult; and 2,683 of 4,427 patients (61 percent) with at least one Choice consult. We found that delays among consults ordered in FY 2015 may have harmed four patients. Beginning in July 2015, system leadership initiated a focused effort to identify and resolve factors that contributed to consult delays, including hiring additional support staff to process consults. Despite this effort, we found evidence of persistent issues with completing consults timely in FY 2016 (through late August 2016). We also noted that system leadership initiated ongoing reviews to determine if patient harm occurred due to delays in care. We made two recommendations to the VA Montana Director to ensure that an external (non-system) source review the care of patients we identified who were potentially harmed by consult delays and that VA staff provide institutional disclosures, as appropriate. We also made a recommendation regarding ongoing efforts to improve consult timeliness. The VA Montana Director and the VISN 19 Director concurred with our three recommendations and provided a responsive action plan and milestones to address the recommendations. The OIG has repeatedly reported on VA's legacy systems and how they impair VA operations. A key element to accurate planning is a financial system that provides timely information to VA leadership. As was reported in Audit of VA's Financial Statements for Fiscal Years 2016 and 2015, VA's complex, disjointed, and legacy financial management system architecture continues to deteriorate over time and no longer meets the increasingly stringent and demanding financial management and reporting requirements mandated by the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Management Budget. VA continues to be challenged in its efforts to apply consistent and proactive enforcement of established policies and procedures throughout its geographically dispersed portfolio of legacy applications and systems. VA announced in October 2016 that it selected the Department of Agriculture as its Federal shared service provider to deliver a modern financial management solution to replace its existing core financial management system. When completed, this will be a major and critical effort for VA in modernizing its system architecture for financial management. The audit of VA's FY 2016 Consolidated Financial Statements also identified Community Care obligations, reconciliations, and accrued expenses as a material weakness. Lack of tools to estimate non-VA Care costs, lack of controls to ensure timely deobligations, and the difficulty in reconciling non-VA Care authorizations to obligations in VA's Financial Management System, make the accurate and timely management of purchased care funds challenging. In addition, the Office of Community Care (OCC) did not have adequate policies and procedures for its own monitoring activities. OCC's activities were not integrated with VA and VHA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) responsibilities under Public Law (P.L.) 101-576, the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, to develop and maintain integrated accounting and financial management systems and provide policy guidance and oversight of all Community Care financial management personnel, activities, and operations. To address the difficulties in estimating costs, VA requested legislation that would allow VA to record an obligation at the time of payment rather than when care is authorized. In its consolidation plan, VA said this would likely reduce the potential for large deobligation amounts after the funds have expired. We recognize that the current process and system infrastructure are complex and do not provide for effective funds management. We caution that such a change alone--i.e., obligating funds at the time of payment--would not necessarily remove all of VA's challenges in this area. VA would still need adequate controls to monitor accounting, reconciliation, and management information processes to ensure they effectively manage funds appropriated by Congress. VA needs to accurately forecast the demand for health care services in both the near term and the long term. The OIG is required by Section 301 of Public Law 113-146, the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, to review VHA occupations with the largest staffing shortages. We have issued three reports at this time and under the statute we will report for another two years. In our most recent report issued in September 2016,\\3\\ we identified (i) medical officer; (ii) nurse; (iii) psychologist; (iv) physician assistant; and (v) physical therapist/medical technician as five critical occupations with the largest staffing shortages. In our initial review \\4\\ and our subsequent reviews,\\5\\ we continue to recommend VHA create a staffing model that considers demand and complexity, and matches that to budget requests and allocations. While VHA has continually concurred with the recommendation, their planned completion date is September 2017. Further delay will potentially result in missed opportunities to request appropriate funding when planning for the FY 2019 budget. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-16-00351-453.pdf, September 28, 2016 \\4\\ OIG Determination of Veterans Health Administration's Occupational Staffing Shortages, January 30, 2015 \\5\\ OIG Determination of Veterans Health Administration's Occupational Staffing Shortages, September 1, 2015 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- conclusion The OIG is committed to providing effective oversight of the programs and operations of VA. A number of our reports address the five broad areas noted by GAO in placing VA Health Care on its High Risk list. We will continue to produce reports that provide VA, Congress, and the public with recommendations that we believe will help VA operate its programs and services in a manner that will effectively and timely deliver services and benefits to veterans and spend taxpayer money appropriately. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement and we would be happy to answer any questions that you or other Members of the Committee may have. Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Missal. Dr. Clancy. STATEMENT OF CAROLYN M. CLANCY, M.D., DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY FOR HEALTH AND ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE, VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS; ACCOMPANIED BY JENNIFER LEE, M.D., DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY FOR HEALTH FOR POLICY AND SERVICES; AND AMY PARKER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT Dr. Clancy. Good afternoon, Senator Tillis, Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss VA's efforts to improve the issues identified by the GAO when they placed VA health care on the High-Risk List in 2015. As you noted, I am accompanied by Dr. Jennifer Lee and Amy Parker. In its High-Risk List update, GAO identified managing risks and improving VA health care as a high-risk area and noted five associated issues, which we have detailed in our written statement, and Debra Draper just reiterated. On March 3, 2017, Secretary Shulkin met with Comptroller General Dodaro to convey VA leadership's commitment to accelerating the changes required to meet all of GAO's criteria for removal from the High-Risk List. Secretary Shulkin acknowledged the significant scope of the work that remains and committed to better integrate its high risk-related actions with the President's priorities and ongoing VA transformation efforts. We immediately began working with GAO to follow through on Secretary Shulkin's commitments and to ensure continued VA collaboration with our GAO colleagues. We take GAO's work and the Inspector General's very seriously and appreciate the advice and feedback we have received from them. We are pleased to have the opportunity to report on our progress to date and our plan to ultimately be removed from the list. Addressing these risks will provide a sustainable foundation for continued transformation of the Veterans Health Administration. We have made progress since being placed on the High-Risk List. Two years ago, VHA had over 800 policies and over half of these had expired. On average, it took about 340 days to produce national policy, and VHA lacked a consistent process for their development. Since that time, we have established a workgroup of all outcome executives, meeting every 2 weeks, tracking all policies and development, examining every step of the process, addressing barriers, and piloted and established a new lean process that would be completed within 120 days. There are now approximately 650 active policies. New policies are created and reviewed promptly, and essential policies on access, scheduling, and consultations have been completed, published, and widely disseminated. We have committed to completing GAO's recommendations to ensure medical facility controlled substance inspection programs meet our requirements by October of this year. VHA also instituted a significant organizational transformation that aligned key offices, including offices of compliance and business integrity, medical audit, a new internal audit function, the management review service, and ethics, under a single combined Office of Integrity, led by a new leader, Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health, Dr. Gerard Cox, who reports to me. The newly established Office of Internal Audit and Risk Assessment uses reports from VA's Office of Inspector General, GAO, and the Office of Special Counsel to conduct further assessments into potential weaknesses in VA health care programs or care quality. During the past 2 years, in partnership with GAO, we conducted a comprehensive inventory of open recommendations and instituted a regular process for adjudicating closure based on documentation of completed actions, and linked them quite specifically to the risk areas identified by the GAO. Now, more than 45 percent of open recommendations were made, just in a year or less, and we have requested closure on 18 percent of the open recommendations. We have learned that integrating with or updating our veterans health information systems and technology architecture, known as VistA, is difficult and costly. We must be able to consistently access veteran information to succeed. We certified our interoperability with the Department of Defense on April 8, 2016. Today the Joint Legacy Viewer is available to all clinicians in every one of our facilities across the country, and we are also actively onboarding private sector partners into our health information exchange, because that is absolutely imperative for community care to work well. Mr. Chairman, transformation is a marathon, not a sprint. It takes several years to turn any organization around and we are acutely aware that most of the candidates on GAO's High- Risk List have taken multiple years to meet that requirement. Secretary Shulkin is absolutely dedicated that we do this as rapidly as possible. While I am proud of the progress we have made in a short time, I am also acutely aware that we have much more work to do. I am grateful for the subject matter advice and consultation provided by Dr. Draper and her colleagues, and reiterate my commitment to working more closely with them. We look forward to working with you and Members of this Committee and to better serve our veterans, and to have committed to quarterly briefings to your staff. Thank you for the opportunity to testify and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Dr. Clancy follows:] Prepared Statement of Carolyn M. Clancy, M.D., Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Organizational Excellence, Veterans Health Administration, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Good afternoon, Chairman Isakson, Ranking Member Tester, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) efforts to improve the issues identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that placed VA health care on the 2015 GAO High Risk List. I am accompanied today by Dr. Jennifer Lee, Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Services, and Amy Parker, Executive Director of Operations, Office of Management. introduction In its 2015 High Risk List Update, GAO identified ``Managing Risks and Improving VA Health Care'' as a high-risk area and noted five associated high-risk issues: Ambiguous policies and inconsistent processes; Inadequate oversight and accountability; Information technology (IT) challenges; Inadequate training for VA staff; and, Unclear resources needs and allocation priorities. We take GAO's work seriously and appreciate the advice and feedback we have received from our colleagues. We are pleased to have the opportunity to report on our progress to date and our plan to be removed from the list. Addressing these risks will provide a sustainable foundation for continued transformation of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). progress to date by risk area Ambiguous Policies Two years ago, VHA had over 800 policies, and more than half had expired. On average, it took over 340 days to produce national policy, and VHA lacked a consistent process for policy development. Since that time, we have established a workgroup comprised of all outcome executives that meets every two weeks and tracks all policies in development. We examined every step of the process, addressed barriers, and piloted and established a new, lean process with an aspirational timeline of 120 days. Our new process incorporated review and comments from medical centers and administrative offices--something that had never been formally required in the past, and which addressed many of the gaps identified by GAO. We funded seven full-time contractors to support transformation. We identified and rescinded 112 expired policies and 20 additional policies that were no longer relevant. We completed work updating many policies imperative to addressing then-Under Secretary for Health Dr. David Shulkin's five priorities, and are eliminating handbooks and manuals in an effort to simplify and streamline national policy. There are now approximately 650 active policies, including essential policies on access, scheduling, and consultations that were completed, published, and widely disseminated. We are also beginning to experience the unquantifiable benefits of culture change, as people in VA Central Office and the field become aware of these new processes, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Inadequate Oversight and Accountability VHA instituted a significant organizational transformation that aligned several key offices including the Office of Compliance and Business Integrity, the Office of the Medical Inspector, the Office of Internal Audit and Risk Assessment, the Management Review Service, and the National Center for Ethics in Health Care. These offices are led by a newly established Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Integrity, Dr. Gerard Cox, who reports to the Deputy Under Secretary for Organizational Excellence. VHA also established a new Office of Internal Audit and Risk Assessment that uses reports from VA's Office of Inspector General (OIG), GAO, and the U.S. Office of Special Counsel to conduct further assessments into potential weaknesses in VA health care programs or care quality. The expected outcomes from VHA's integration of oversight and accountability activities are that: 1) VHA program offices, Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), and facilities will possess a common understanding of how their oversight authorities, roles, and responsibilities align, 2) VHA will have a workforce well trained in oversight standards, 3) program offices, VISNs, and facilities will uniformly oversee policy implementation, and 4) VHA will have a culture that incorporates both values and process to solve policy concerns. During the past two years VA, in partnership with GAO, conducted a comprehensive inventory of open recommendations and instituted a regular process for adjudicating closure based on documentation of completed actions. This adjudication process resulted in closure of 91 recommendations, and we have requested closure on 18 percent of open recommendations. We have systematically cleared out the backlog of old recommendations so that currently over 45 percent of our open recommendations were made during the past 12 months. An additional 30 percent of open recommendations are between 1- and 3-years old. information technology challenges VA has learned that integrating with or updating the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) is difficult and costly. VistA Evolution is a joint VHA and Office of Information and Technology project intended to improve the efficiency and quality of Veterans' health care by modernizing VA's health information systems, increase data interoperability with the Department of Defense (DOD) and network care partners, and reduce the time it takes to deploy new health information management capabilities. VistA Evolution funds have enabled critical investments in systems and infrastructure; supported interoperability, networking and infrastructure sustainment; continuation of legacy systems; and other efforts that are critical to maintenance and deployment. These investments will deliver value for Veterans and VA providers regardless of whether our path forward is to continue with VistA, shift to a commercial Electronic Health Record (EHR) as DOD is doing, or some combination of both. Access to accurate Veteran information is one of our core responsibilities, and today the Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV) is available to all clinicians in every VA facility in the country. VA certified VA/ DOD interoperability on April 8, 2016, in accordance with section 713(b)(1) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 113-66). However, JLV is a read-only application. Leveraging this JLV interoperability infrastructure, the Enterprise Health Management Platform (eHMP) will ultimately replace JLV. eHMP is a cornerstone of the VistA Evolution Program, building on the capability for clinically actionable, patient-centric data pioneered by JLV. eHMP will fill clinical gaps in VA's current tools, bridge the EHR modernization effort, and simplify VHA's overall clinical user experience. Upon completion, eHMP will offer robust support for Veteran-centric health care, team-based health care, and quality driven health care while improving access based on clinical need. Inadequate Training for VA Staff Training is vital to maintain a competent workforce and ensure that Veterans consistently receive timely, safe, high quality care. Training also requires a substantial investment of time and resources. From March to June 2016, then-Under Secretary for Health Dr. Shulkin directed a temporary moratorium on all Talent Management System (TMS) assignments not assigned by law or Executive Order. A detailed listing of previous training requirements was built to review all assignments, and comprehensive recommendations from across the organization were collected on existing training assignments. The VHA training policy was revised based on the results of this training review and is currently under evaluation. As a result, all 32,326 VHA employee TMS assignments were reviewed, and more than 700,000 hours of training were targeted for potential removal along with possible savings of over $38.7 million in hourly equivalent staff salary. To continue this improvement, VHA's new Mandatory Training Policy will be implemented this year in a phased rollout, with additional steps for review of content and comment from field-based experts. Unclear Resource Needs and Allocation Priorities Key accomplishments for connecting strategy, requirements, programming, budgeting, and execution (since June 2015) include: Completion of the Quadrennial Strategic Planning Process (QSPP)--Strategic Options and Alternative of Analysis Phases. Outputs from the QSPP informed our planning guidance. Selection of the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a Federal Shared Service Provider to support the migration of a new financial management system (FMS). VA established a Financial Management Business Transformation program office and an Executive Steering Committee to manage the multi-year effort to improve VA's financial management accuracy and transparency. Issuance of FY 2019-2023 Programming Guidance as the disciplined framework to develop, assess, and prioritize multi-year requirements. VA successfully implemented two Managing for Results Programming cycles, which enhanced the connection of requirements and resources to support more defensible budget justifications. This included conducting Program Review Boards with senior leadership to assess gaps, impacts, and mitigations in advance of budget formulation. Publication of the FY 2018-2022 Programming Decision Memorandum (PDM) to capture decisions from the Program Review Boards and inform budget formulation guidance. The PDM included senior leadership decisions for resource prioritization and enterpri"
