        "text": "On May 19, the sun shone brightly as the medical Class of 2024 ceremony began. Loved ones of more than 100 medical graduates filled the pews in UVM’s Ira Allen Chapel to celebrate the newly minted doctors. This event marked the end of their medical school journey at the Larner College of Medicine and their transition to residencies across the country in various specialties, including internal medicine, pediatrics, surgery, and more.\n\nLeading the faculty into the chapel was faculty marshal Jillian Sullivan, M.D.’04. Class of 2024 graduate Elise A. Prehoda, M.D., served as student marshal and led her classmates into the ceremony, where Richard L. Page, M.D., dean of the Larner College of Medicine, delivered the first remarks. Praising the new physicians on the grace and professionalism with which they adapted to new learning modalities and upheaval during the pandemic, he said, “The Class of 2024 is special. They applied to medical school before anyone had heard of COVID, but they started their medical education in the thick of a pandemic. Instead of our usual greeting of the entire class in one large classroom, Dean Zehle and I greeted the Class of 2024 wearing masks, visiting them in the individual pods of a dozen or so students that defined their first preclinical year. The first months of medical school are always hard, but nobody would wish upon them the added challenges they endured.” Page applauded them on their resilience, stating, “I have never been so optimistic about the future of a graduating class or our College. These new doctors are going into the world for training, at outstanding residency programs, prepared to take on whatever life brings them … I can’t wait to see what they will accomplish.”\n\nThe ceremony also featured remarks from President and Chief Executive Officer of the University of Vermont Health Network Sunil Eappen, M.D., M.B.A., and a keynote address by James J. O’Connell, M.D., president of the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\n“Welcome, Class of 2024, to our amazing profession. I wish you exciting lives, full of balance, promise, failure—yes, failure; without which we cannot grow—compassion, fun, and love,” said O’Connell. “Cherish your family and friends. Embrace uncertainty, cherish failures, and always remain open to the serendipity that sprinkles each of our lives with grace. You have so much to give … especially to those who are vulnerable, excluded, lonely, and shunned by our society. Now, more than ever, the world desperately needs you.”\n\nPrior to the awarding of degrees, Senior Associate Dean for Medical Education Christa Zehle, M.D.’99, delivered remarks and introduced Class of 2024 student speaker Tyler Landman, M.D. Landman recounted his medical school journey, noting that above and beyond the typical hurdles of medical school, the Class of 2024 stands out as the first Larner cohort to confront the unprecedented trials posed by the COVID-19 pandemic as medical students."
