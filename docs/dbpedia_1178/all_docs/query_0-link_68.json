        "text": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders affecting women of childbearing age. Poor pregnancy outcomes are increased in these women and their children. The proposed studies will increase our knowledge on multiple levels to improve care and reduce adverse outcomes in these mothers and children. An overall goal of this study is to establish the relationship between antiepileptic drug exposure and outcomes in the mother and child as well as describe and explain the variability in antiepileptic drug exposure and response.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.\n\nView full details\n\nMethylphenidate (MPH) has long been used to improve attention and cognitive difficulties associated with ADHD, including in children with ADHD and epilepsy (Torres et al., 2008). Methylphenidate (MPH) is also helpful in treating attention and other cognitive difficulties in a variety of other neurological and medical conditions (Kajs-Wyllie, 2002; Prommer, 2012). We seek to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of this medication in treating attention deficits, as well as other cognitive difficulties, experienced by adult patients with epilepsy. To our knowledge, there are currently very few studies which explicitly examine the impact of MPH on measureable attention deficits and other cognitive deficits in adult patients with epilepsy. We hope to quantify what impact, if any, methylphenidate has on attention, in addition to other specific measureable cognitive functions, in patients with cognitive complaints and epilepsy, and contribute to a growing body of evidence which supports the safety of methylphenidate's use for attention deficits in patients with epilepsy. As other effective treatments for attention and other cognitive difficulties in patients with epilepsy are not currently available, MPH could represent an important option in the treatment of such patients.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial.\n\nView full details\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Human Epilepsy Project (HEP) is a large multinational cohort study of people with newly diagnosed and treated focal epilepsy. HEP utilized the Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB) as a self-directed online assessment to examine cognitive outcomes in study participants. The CBB has previously been validated in healthy individuals and people with various brain disorders, but its use in adults participating in HEP has not been assessed. In this study, we describe how the CBB was used in the HEP cohort and assess factors associated with test completion among study participants.Enrollment data for HEP included 408 participants with comprehensive enrollment records, of whom 249 completed CBB assessments. HEP enrolled cognitively normal-range participants between the ages of 12 and 60 from June 29, 2012, to November 7, 2017, with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy and within 4 months of initial treatment. Baseline participant characteristics were analyzed, including demographics, pre-treatment seizure histories, MRI abnormalities, and the presence of any learning difficulties while in school, including formal learning disability diagnoses, repeated grades, and remediation. HEP participant characteristics for those who completed CBB testing were compared to those who did not using multiple logistic regression.The analysis of HEP participants who completed CBB testing showed that, after controlling for other factors, male participants were more likely to engage in testing (OR 2.14, 95 % CI 1.29 to 3.5, p < 0.01), Black subjects were less likely (OR 0.45, 95 % CI 0.22 to 0.9, p = 0.02), primary English speakers were more likely (OR 3.1, 95 % CI 1.21 to 7.96, p = 0.02), and those with a history of learning challenges were less likely (OR 0.69, 95 % CI 0.49 to 0.97, p = 0.03). There were no significant associations between completing CBB testing and age, employment (employed or student vs not), education (higher education vs not), diagnostic delay, pre-diagnostic seizure burden, or initial seizure semiology (motor vs non-motor).The findings from this study highlight factors associated with the application of remote and unsupervised assessments of cognition in a prospective cohort of adults with focal epilepsy. These factors can be considered when interpreting performance on the CBB in HEP, as well as assisting the design of future studies that use similar approaches.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2024.109953\n\nView details for PubMedID 39121756\n\nAbstract\n\nNeurodevelopmental effects of fetal antiseizure medication (ASM) exposure on creativity and executive functions are poorly understood. We previously found fetal valproate exposure to adversely affect measures of creativity and executive functions. In this study, we examine fetal exposure of newer ASMs on these functions in children of women with epilepsy (WWE) compared with children of healthy women (HW).The Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs study is a multicenter NIH-funded prospective observational cohort study of WWE and HW enrolled in pregnancy and their offsprings. This report examines blindly assessed creativity and executive functions in 4.5-year-old children of WWE vs HW. In addition, exposure-dependent ASM effects during the third trimester were examined in children of WWE, using a ratio of maximum observed ASM concentrations and ratio of defined daily dose (ratio DDD). For polytherapy, ratios were summed across ASMs. Linear regression models adjusted for multiple potential confounding factors were conducted for all analyses. The primary outcome for 4.5-year-old children was the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking-Figural Creativity Index. Secondary outcomes included the Global Executive Composite Score from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version and subscales and other indexes of both measures.The primary analysis included 251 children of WWE and 73 of HW. No differences in creativity or executive function were found between children of WWE vs HW. No ASM exposure-dependent effects were found for the creativity measures, but exposure-dependent effects for executive function were present for ratio ASM concentration and ratio DDD.Our findings at 4.5 years show no differences in creative thinking between children of WWE vs HW (-3.2 [-9.0 to 2.7], p = 0.286) or associations with fetal exposure to ASMs (-2.6 [-11.0 to 5.7], p = 0.530). Secondary analyses revealed fetal exposure-dependent effects for executive function in children of WWE (7.0 [2.9-11.2], p = 0.001), which are most marked for levetiracetam (12.9 [4.2-21.6], p = 0.004). Our findings suggest that even for relatively safe ASMs, dosing needs to be adjusted to concentrations that prevent seizures, but balance risks to the fetus that high concentrations may pose.The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01730170.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1212/WNL.0000000000209448\n\nView details for PubMedID 38810172\n\nAbstract\n\nAnimal and human studies have suggested that the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be associated with a lower risk of incident epilepsy compared with other antihypertensive medications. However, observational data from the US are lacking.To evaluate the association between ARB use and epilepsy incidence in subgroups of US patients with hypertension.This retrospective cohort study used data from a national health administrative database from January 2010 to December 2017 with propensity score (PS) matching. The eligible cohort included privately insured individuals aged 18 years or older with diagnosis of primary hypertension and dispensed at least 1 ARB, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), β-blocker, or calcium channel blocker (CCB) from 2010 to 2017. Patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy at or before the index date or dispensed an antiseizure medication 12 months before or 90 days after initiating the study medications were excluded. The data analysis for this project was conducted from April 2022 to April 2024.Propensity scores were generated based on baseline covariates and used to match patients who received ARBs with those who received either ACEIs, β-blockers, CCBs, or a combination of these antihypertensive medications.Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate epilepsy incidence during follow-up comparing the ARB cohort with other antihypertensive classes. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the association between ARB use and epilepsy incidence in various subgroups.Of 2 261 964 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.7 [13.9] years; 1 120 630 [49.5%] female) included, 309 978 received ARBs, 807 510 received ACEIs, 695 887 received β-blockers, and 448 589 received CCBs. Demographic and clinical characteristics differed across the 4 comparison groups prior to PS matching. Compared with ARB users, patients receiving ACEIs were predominantly male and had diabetes, CCB users were generally older (eg, >65 years), and β-blocker users had more comorbidities and concurrent medications. The 1:1 PS-matched subgroups included 619 858 patients for ARB vs ACEI, 619 828 patients for ARB vs β-blocker, and 601 002 patients for ARB vs CCB. Baseline characteristics were equally distributed between comparison groups after matching with propensity scores. Use of ARBs was associated with a decreased incidence of epilepsy compared with ACEIs (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.96), β-blockers (aHR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54-0.90), and a combination of other antihypertensive classes (aHR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.95). Subgroup analyses revealed a significant association between ARB use (primarily losartan) and epilepsy incidence in patients with no preexisting history of stroke or cardiovascular disease.This cohort study found that ARBs, mainly losartan, were associated with a lower incidence of epilepsy compared with other antihypertensive agents in hypertensive patients with no preexisting stroke or cardiovascular disease. Further studies, such as randomized clinical trials, are warranted to confirm the comparative antiepileptogenic properties of antihypertensive medications.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaneurol.2024.1714\n\nView details for PubMedID 38884986\n\nAbstract\n\nWe previously analyzed data from three phase lll trials of adjunctive brivaracetam (BRV) in adults showing that the incidence and prevalence of drug-related central nervous system treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) quickly peaked and decreased over several weeks following BRV treatment initiation. However, that analysis did not assess psychiatric and behavioral side effects which can occur with antiseizure medication (ASM) treatment. Here, we investigate the time-course of psychiatric and behavioral TEAEs by week of BRV treatment and how these TEAEs were managed.Data were pooled from three trials (N01252 [NCT00490035]; N01253 [NCT00464269]; N01358 [NCT01261325]) in adult patients (≥16 years of age) with focal-onset seizures receiving BRV adjunctive therapy. This post hoc analysis reports data on the incidence and prevalence of drug-related psychiatric or behavioral TEAEs over time in patients who received BRV doses of 50-200 mg/day (without titration) or placebo (PBO) during the 12-week treatment period. A logistic regression model was used to determine if psychiatric or behavioral comorbid conditions were predictors for drug-related psychiatric or behavioral TEAEs, or BRV discontinuation due to psychiatric or behavioral TEAEs.A total of 803 patients received BRV 50-200 mg/day, and 459 patients received PBO. Drug-related psychiatric or behavioral TEAEs were reported by 11.0 % of patients during adjunctive BRV treatment (PBO: 4.8 %) with onset early after BRV initiation (median time to onset of first drug-related psychiatric or behavioral TEAE: 15 days). Incidence peaked at week 1 and decreased over the first 4 weeks following BRV initiation. Prevalence peaked at week 4 and then remained stable between weeks 5-12. In an analysis excluding patients on concomitant levetiracetam (BRV: n = 744; PBO: n = 422), the incidence of drug-related psychiatric or behavioral TEAEs was similar to the incidence in the overall population. The most common drug-related psychiatric or behavioral TEAEs were irritability, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Only 2 % of patients discontinued BRV due to psychiatric or behavioral TEAEs (PBO: 1.3 %), while most patients on BRV who reported drug-related psychiatric or behavioral TEAEs did not require a change in dose (84.1 %; PBO: 63.6 %). A history of psychiatric or behavioral comorbid conditions (not ongoing at BRV initiation) was not associated with an increased likelihood of drug-related psychiatric or behavioral TEAEs, or BRV discontinuation due to psychiatric or behavioral TEAEs. Ongoing psychiatric or behavioral comorbid conditions at BRV initiation increased the likelihood of drug-related psychiatric or behavioral TEAEs, but not the likelihood of BRV discontinuation due to psychiatric or behavioral TEAEs.Drug-related psychiatric and behavioral TEAEs occurred early during BRV treatment, and most patients did not require a change in BRV dose. These data can help guide clinician monitoring and patient expectations after starting BRV.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2024.109844\n\nView details for PubMedID 38788664\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Epilepsy patients often report memory deficits despite normal objective testing, suggesting that available measures are insensitive or that non-mnemonic factors are involved. The Visual Paired Comparison Task (VPCT) assesses novelty preference, the tendency to fixate on novel images rather than previously viewed items, requiring recognition memory for the \"old\" images. As novelty preference is a sensitive measure of hippocampal-dependent memory function, we predicted impaired VPCT performance in epilepsy patients compared to healthy controls.METHODS: We assessed 26 healthy adult controls and 31 epilepsy patients (16 focal-onset, 13 generalized-onset, 2 unknown-onset) with the VPCT using delays of 2 or 30s between encoding and recognition. Fifteen healthy controls and 17 epilepsy patients (10 focal-onset, 5 generalized-onset, 2 unknown-onset) completed the task at 2-, 5-, and 30-minute delays. Subjects also performed standard memory measures, including the Medical College of Georgia (MCG) Paragraph Test, California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II), and Brief Visual Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R).RESULTS: The epilepsy group was high functioning, with greater estimated IQ (p=0.041), greater years of education (p=0.034), and higher BVMT-R scores (p=0.024) compared to controls. Both the control group and epilepsy cohort, as well as focal- and generalized-onset subgroups, had intact novelty preference at the 2- and 30-second delays (p-values≤0.001) and declined at 30min (p-values>0.05). Only the epilepsy patients had early declines at 2- and 5-minute delays (controls with intact novelty preference at p=0.003 and p≤0.001, respectively; epilepsy groups' p-values>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Memory for the \"old\" items decayed more rapidly in overall, focal-onset, and generalized-onset epilepsy groups. The VPCT detected deficits while standard memory measures were largely intact, suggesting that the VPCT may be a more sensitive measure of temporal lobe memory function than standard neuropsychological batteries.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2024.109749\n\nView details for PubMedID 38636142\n\nAbstract\n\nA variety of terms, such as \"antiepileptic,\" \"anticonvulsant,\" and \"antiseizure\" have been historically applied to medications for the treatment of seizure disorders. Terminology is important because using terms that do not accurately reflect the action of specific treatments may result in a misunderstanding of their effects and inappropriate use. The present International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) position paper used a Delphi approach to develop recommendations on English-language terminology applicable to pharmacological agents currently approved for treating seizure disorders. There was consensus that these medications should be collectively named \"antiseizure medications\". This term accurately reflects their primarily symptomatic effect against seizures and reduces the possibility of health care practitioners, patients, or caregivers having undue expectations or an incorrect understanding of the real action of these medications. The term \"antiseizure\" to describe these agents does not exclude the possibility of beneficial effects on the course of the disease and comorbidities that result from the downstream effects of seizures, whenever these beneficial effects can be explained solely by the suppression of seizure activity. It is acknowledged that other treatments, mostly under development, can exert direct favorable actions on the underlying disease or its progression, by having \"antiepileptogenic\" or \"disease-modifying\" effects. A more-refined terminology to describe precisely these actions needs to be developed.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/epi.17877\n\nView details for PubMedID 38279786\n\nAbstract\n\nStroke is one of the most common neurological conditions that often leads to upper limb motor impairments, significantly affecting individuals' quality of life. Rehabilitation strategies are crucial in facilitating post-stroke recovery and improving functional independence. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) systems have emerged as promising upper limb rehabilitation tools, offering innovative neuromuscular reeducation approaches.The main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive systematic review of the start-of-the-art functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems for upper limb neurorehabilitation in post-stroke therapy. More specifically, this paper aims to review different types of FES systems, their feasibility testing, or randomized control trials (RCT) studies.The FES systems classification is based on the involvement of patient feedback within the FES control, which mainly includes \"Open-Loop FES Systems\" (manually controlled) and \"Closed-Loop FES Systems\" (brain-computer interface-BCI and electromyography-EMG controlled). Thus, valuable insights are presented into the technological advantages and effectiveness of Manual FES, EEG-FES, and EMG-FES systems.The review analyzed 25 studies and found that the use of FES-based rehabilitation systems resulted in favorable outcomes for the stroke recovery of upper limb functional movements, as measured by the FMA (Fugl-Meyer Assessment) (Manually controlled FES: mean difference = 5.6, 95% CI (3.77, 7.5), P < 0.001; BCI-controlled FES: mean difference = 5.37, 95% CI (4.2, 6.6), P < 0.001; EMG-controlled FES: mean difference = 14.14, 95% CI (11.72, 16.6), P < 0.001) and ARAT (Action Research Arm Test) (EMG-controlled FES: mean difference = 11.9, 95% CI (8.8, 14.9), P < 0.001) scores. Furthermore, the shortcomings, clinical considerations, comparison to non-FES systems, design improvements, and possible future implications are also discussed for improving stroke rehabilitation systems and advancing post-stroke recovery. Thus, summarizing the existing literature, this review paper can help researchers identify areas for further investigation. This can lead to formulating research questions and developing new studies aimed at improving FES systems and their outcomes in upper limb rehabilitation.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fneur.2023.1272992\n\nView details for PubMedID 38145118\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10739305\n\nAbstract\n\nThe association of fetal exposure to antiseizure medications (ASMs) with outcomes in childhood are not well delineated.To examine the association of fetal ASM exposure with subsequent adaptive, behavioral or emotional, and neurodevelopmental disorder outcomes at 2, 3, and 4.5 years of age.The Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study is a prospective, observational cohort study conducted at 20 epilepsy centers in the US. A total of 456 pregnant women with epilepsy or without epilepsy were enrolled from December 19, 2012, to January 13, 2016. Children of enrolled women were followed up with formal assessments at 2, 3, 4.5, and 6 years of age. Statistical analysis took place from August 2022 to May 2023.Exposures included mother's epilepsy status as well as mother's ASM blood concentration in the third trimester (for children of women with epilepsy). Women with epilepsy were enrolled regardless of ASM regimen.The primary outcome was the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Third Edition (ABAS-3) General Adaptive Composite (GAC) score among children at 4.5 years of age. Children of women with epilepsy and children of women without epilepsy were compared, and the associations of ASM exposures with outcomes among exposed children were assessed. Secondary outcomes involved similar analyses of other related measures.Primary analysis included 302 children of women with epilepsy (143 boys [47.4%]) and 84 children of women without epilepsy (45 boys [53.6%]). Overall adaptive functioning (ABAS-3 GAC score at 4.5 years) did not significantly differ between children of women with epilepsy and children of women without epilepsy (parameter estimate [PE], 0.4 [95% CI, -2.5 to 3.4]; P = .77). However, in adjusted analyses, a significant decrease in functioning was seen with increasing third-trimester maximum ASM blood concentrations (PE, -7.8 [95% CI, -12.6 to -3.1]; P = .001). This decrease in functioning was evident for levetiracetam (PE, -18.9 [95% CI, -26.8 to -10.9]; P < .001) and lamotrigine (PE, -12.0 [95% CI, -23.7 to -0.3]; P = .04), the ASMs with sample sizes large enough for analysis. Results were similar with third-trimester maximum daily dose.This study suggests that adaptive functioning of children of women with epilepsy taking commonly used ASMs did not significantly differ from that of children of women without epilepsy, but there was an exposure-dependent association of ASMs with functioning. Thus, psychiatric or psychological screening and referral of women with epilepsy and their offspring are recommended when appropriate. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaneurol.2023.4315\n\nView details for PubMedID 37983058\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Breastfeeding has important health benefits for both mother and child. We characterize breastfeeding initiation and duration in mothers with epilepsy relative to control mothers in a large prospective cohort.METHODS: The Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study is a prospective, multi-center observational, US cohort study. Pregnant subjects with and without epilepsy, aged 14-45, were enrolled 12/19/12 to 2/11/16. Exclusion criteria included IQ <70, and gestational age >20 weeks at enrollment. Breastfeeding assessed via electronic diary and at study visits until 2 years postpartum. Odds of initiating breastfeeding was compared between groups using unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models. Duration of breastfeeding was compared between groups using the log-rank test.RESULTS: 351 pregnant subjects with epilepsy and 105 pregnant controls enrolled. Breastfeeding data available for 325 mothers with epilepsy and 98 controls. Study groups were similar demographically except race (P=0.008); 84.9% of mothers with epilepsy and 71.4% of controls were white. Mean IQ was lower in mothers with epilepsy compared with controls (97.7 vs. 104.2, P<0.001). Breastfeeding was initiated by 74.8% mothers with epilepsy and 88.8% controls; this difference was significant in unadjusted logistic regression [Odds Ratio (OR) 0.4 (95% CI 0.2,0.7), P=0.004)], but not in adjusted model [OR 0.5 (95% CI 0.2,1.0), P=0.051)]. Factors associated with breastfeeding were higher maternal education and IQ. There was no difference in duration of breastfeeding between mothers with and without epilepsy [median duration 8.5 months vs. 9.9 months, P=0.793)]. Among mothers with epilepsy, both convulsive seizures and all seizures that impair awareness during pregnancy were associated with lower breastfeeding initiation [OR 0.4 (95% CI 0.2,0.8), P=0.013) and OR 0.4 (95% CI 0.2,0.8), (P=0.003) respectively]. Any peripartum seizures were associated with shorter breastfeeding duration [median 6 months vs. 9.7 months, (P=0.040)].DISCUSSION: Mothers with epilepsy were less likely to initiate breastfeeding compared to controls, however this difference was not significant when controlling for maternal IQ and education level. Continuation of breastfeeding once initiated was not different between mothers with and without epilepsy. Seizure control was associated with breastfeeding initiation and duration in mothers with epilepsy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1212/WNL.0000000000207812\n\nView details for PubMedID 37816636\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study explores natural direct and joint natural indirect effects (JNIE) of prenatal opioid exposure on neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in children mediated through pregnancy complications, major and minor congenital malformations, and adverse neonatal outcomes, using Medicaid claims linked to vital statistics in Rhode Island, United States, 2008-2018. A Bayesian mediation analysis with elastic net shrinkage prior was developed to estimate mean time to NDD diagnosis ratio using posterior mean and 95$\\%$ credible intervals (CIs) from Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Simulation studies showed desirable model performance. Of 11,176 eligible pregnancies, 332 had $\\ge$2 dispensations of prescription opioids anytime during pregnancy, including 200 (1.8$\\%$) having $\\ge$1 dispensation in the first (T1), 169 (1.5$\\%$) in the second (T2), and 153 (1.4$\\%$) in the third trimester (T3). A significant JNIE of opioid exposure was observed in each trimester (T1: 0.97, 95$\\%$ CI: 0.95-0.99; T2: 0.97, 95$\\%$ CI: 0.95-0.99; T3: 0.96, 95$\\%$ CI: 0.94-0.99). The proportion of JNIE in each trimester was 17.9$\\%$ (T1), 22.4$\\%$ (T2), and 56.3$\\%$ (T3), respectively. In conclusion, adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes jointly mediated the association between prenatal opioid exposure and accelerated time to NDD diagnosis. The proportion of JNIE increased as timing of opioid exposure approached delivery.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/aje/kwad183\n\nView details for PubMedID 37671942\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: The neurodevelopmental effects of fetal exposure to most antiseizure medications are unclear. We aimed to investigate the effects of fetal exposure to commonly used antiseizure medications on neuropsychological outcomes at age 3 years.METHODS: The Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study is a prospective, observational, multicentre cohort study at 20 specialty epilepsy centres in the USA. We have investigated pregnancy outcomes in women (aged 14-45 years) with and without epilepsy who were enrolled during pregnancy (≤20 weeks' gestational age), and their children. The primary outcome for children at age 3 years was a blindly assessed Verbal Index score, which was calculated by averaging scores on the Naming Vocabulary and Verbal Comprehension subtests of Differential Ability Scales-II, Expressive Communication and Auditory Comprehension subscales of Preschool Language Scale-5, and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-4. Children of women with and without epilepsy were compared, and the associations of medication exposures to outcomes in exposed children were assessed. The MONEAD study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT0730170, and is ongoing.FINDINGS: Between Dec 19, 2012, and Jan 13, 2016, 456 pregnant women (351 with epilepsy and 105 without epilepsy) were enrolled into the study. 345 children were born to women with epilepsy and 106 children were born to women without epilepsy. Verbal Index scores at age 3 years did not differ for children of women with epilepsy (n=284; adjusted least-square mean 102·7, 95% CI 101·4 to 103·9) versus those without epilepsy (n=87; 102·3, 99·8 to 104·7). Significant risk factors for reduced Verbal Index scores included maternal intelligence quotient, maternal education, post-birth anxiety, gestational age at enrolment, child's sex, and child's ethnicity. For Verbal Index scores, antiseizure medication exposure effects were not seen for maximum third trimester blood concentrations (n=258; adjusted parameter estimate -2·9, 95% CI -6·7 to 1·0). However, in secondary analyses, exposure-dependent effects were present on multiple cognitive measures, which varied by medication.INTERPRETATION: We found no difference in neurodevelopmental outcomes between children with fetal exposure to newer antiseizure medications compared with unexposed children. However, some exposure-dependent antiseizure medication effects were seen in secondary analyses. The adverse effects of maternal post-birth anxiety emphasise the importance of screening mothers during pregnancy and postpartum and implementing interventions. Additional studies are needed to clarify the exposure-dependent effects.FUNDING: National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and National Institute of Child Health and Development.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/S1474-4422(23)00199-0\n\nView details for PubMedID 37479375\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Visual assessment of MRIs from the Human Epilepsy Project 1 (HEP1) found 18% of participants had atrophic brain changes relative to age without known etiology. Here, we identify the underlying factors related to brain volume differences in people with focal epilepsy enrolled in HEP1.METHODS: Enrollment data for participants with complete records and brain MRIs were analyzed, including 391 participants ages 12-60. HEP1 excluded developmental or cognitive delay with IQ <70, and participants reported any formal learning disability diagnoses, repeated grades, and remediation. Pre-diagnostic seizures were quantified by semiology, frequency, and duration. T1-weighted brain MRIs were analyzed using the \"Sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation\" (SAMSEG, Freesurfer v7.2) from which a brain tissue volume to intracranial volume ratio was derived and compared to clinically relevant participant characteristics.RESULTS: Brain tissue volume changes observable on visual analyses were quantified and a brain tissue volume to intracranial volume ratio was derived to compare with clinically relevant variables. Learning difficulties were associated with decreased brain tissue volume to intracranial volume, with a ratio reduction of 0.005 for each learning difficulty reported (95% CI -0.007 to -0.002, p=0.0003). Each 10-year increase in age at MRI was associated with a ratio reduction of 0.006 (95% CI -0.007 to -0.005, p <0.0001). For male participants, the ratio was 0.011 less than female participants (95% CI -0.014 to -0.007, p <0.0001). There were no effects from seizures, employment, education, seizure semiology, or temporal lobe EEG abnormalities.SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows lower brain tissue volume to intracranial volume in people with newly treated focal epilepsy and learning difficulties, suggesting developmental factors are an important marker of brain pathology related to neuroanatomical changes in focal epilepsy. Like the general population, there were also independent associations between brain volume, age, and sex in the study population.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1111/epi.17727\n\nView details for PubMedID 37517050\n\nAbstract\n\nBackgroundAntiseizure medications (ASMs) are among the most commonly prescribed teratogenic drugs in women of childbearing age. Limited data exists on utilization patterns across different indications for therapy and for the newer generation ASMs in this population. Thus, we assessed the pattern of ASM use in women of childbearing age with epilepsy and non-epilepsy indications (pain and psychiatric disorders).MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of deidentified administrative data submitted to the Optum Clinformatics database. Eligible subjects included women aged 12 - 50 years old that filled ASMs between year 2011-2017. Subjects were followed from date of index prescription filled to study end or insurance disenrollment, whichever came first. For the overall cohort and potential therapy indications, we assessed the type and frequency of antiseizure medications filled; proportion of subjects on monotherapy, polytherapy, or treatment switching; and duration of continuous use. Trends were characterized using annual percent change from study start to study end.ResultsOur analysis included 465,131 subjects who filled 603,916 distinct antiseizure medications prescriptions. At baseline, the majority of subjects had chronic pain (51.0%) and psychiatric disorders (32.7%), with epilepsy the least common (0.9%). The most frequently dispensed were diazepam (24.3%), lorazepam (20.1%), gabapentin (17.4%), clonazepam (12.7%), topiramate (11.3%), and lamotrigine (4.6%). Significant linear increase in trends were observed with gabapentin (annual percent change [95% CI]: 8.4 [7.3, 9.4]; p-value: < 0.001) and levetiracetam (3.4 [0.7, 6.2]; p-value: 0.022), and decreasing trends for diazepam (-3.5 [-2.4, - 4.5]; p-value: < 0.001) and clonazepam (-3.4 [-2.3, - 4.5]; p-value: 0.001). No significant change in trend was observed with valproate (-0.4 [-2.7, 1.9]; p-value: 0.651), while non-linear changes in trends were observed with lorazepam, topiramate, lamotrigine, and pregabalin.DiscussionDecreasing trends were observed with older antiseizure medications in the overall cohort and across the potential indications for therapy. Conversely, increasing trends were seen with the newer antiseizure medications. Considering the risk of teratogenicity associated with the newer medications largely unknown, counseling and education in addition to a careful consideration of the benefits versus potential risks should remain pivotal when prescribing antiseizure medications for women of childbearing age.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1212/WNL.0000000000207580\n\nView details for PubMedID 37407266\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Exposure in utero to certain medications can disrupt processes of fetal development, including brain development, leading to a continuum of neurodevelopmental difficulties. Recognizing the deficiency of neurodevelopmental investigations within pregnancy pharmacovigilance, an international Neurodevelopmental Expert Working Group was convened to achieve consensus regarding the core neurodevelopmental outcomes, optimization of methodological approaches and barriers to conducting pregnancy pharmacovigilance studies with neurodevelopmental outcomes. Methods: A modified Delphi study was undertaken based on stakeholder and expert input. Stakeholders (patient, pharmaceutical, academic and regulatory) were invited to define topics, pertaining to neurodevelopmental investigations in medication-exposed pregnancies. Experts were identified for their experience regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes following medicinal, substances of misuse or environmental exposures in utero. Two questionnaire rounds and a virtual discussion meeting were used to explore expert opinion on the topics identified by the stakeholders. Results: Twenty-five experts, from 13 countries and professionally diverse backgrounds took part in the development of 11 recommendations. The recommendations focus on the importance of neurodevelopment as a core feature of pregnancy pharmacovigilance, the timing of study initiation and a core set of distinct but interrelated neurodevelopmental skills or diagnoses which require investigation. Studies should start in infancy with an extended period of investigation into adolescence, with more frequent sampling during rapid periods of development. Additionally, recommendations are made regarding optimal approach to neurodevelopmental outcome measurement, comparator groups, exposure factors, a core set of confounding and mediating variables, attrition, reporting of results and the required improvements in funding for potential later emerging effects. Different study designs will be required depending on the specific neurodevelopmental outcome type under investigation and whether the medicine in question is newly approved or already in widespread use. Conclusion: An improved focus on neurodevelopmental outcomes is required within pregnancy pharmacovigilance. These expert recommendations should be met across a complementary set of studies which converge to form a comprehensive set of evidence regarding neurodevelopmental outcomes in pregnancy pharmacovigilance.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fphar.2023.1094698\n\nView details for PubMedID 37332344\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10270323\n\nAbstract\n\nNeuromodulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus (ANT) has shown to be efficacious in a subset of patients with refractory focal epilepsy. One important uncertainty is to what extent thalamic subregions other than the ANT could be recruited more prominently in the propagation of focal onset seizures. We designed the current study to simultaneously monitor the engagement of the ANT, mediodorsal (MD) and pulvinar (PUL) nuclei during seizures in patients who could be candidates for thalamic neuromodulation. We studied 11 patients with clinical manifestations of presumed temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) undergoing invasive stereo-encephalography (sEEG) monitoring to confirm the source of their seizures. We extended cortical electrodes to reach the ANT, MD and PUL nuclei of the thalamus. More than one thalamic subdivision was simultaneously interrogated in nine patients. We recorded seizures with implanted electrodes across various regions of the brain and documented seizure onset zones (SOZ) in each recorded seizure. We visually identified the first thalamic subregion to be involved in seizure propagation. Additionally, in eight patients, we applied repeated single pulse electrical stimulation in each SOZ and recorded the time and prominence of evoked responses across the implanted thalamic regions. Our approach for multisite thalamic sampling was safe and caused no adverse events. Intracranial EEG recordings confirmed SOZ in medial temporal lobe, insula, orbitofrontal and temporal neocortical sites, highlighting the importance of invasive monitoring for accurate localization of SOZs. In all patients, seizures with the same propagation network and originating from the same SOZ involved the same thalamic subregion, with a stereotyped thalamic EEG signature. Qualitative visual reviews of ictal EEGs were largely consistent with the quantitative analysis of the corticothalamic evoked potentials, and both documented that thalamic nuclei other than ANT could have the earliest participation in seizure propagation. Specifically, pulvinar nuclei were involved earlier and more prominently than ANT in more than half of the patients. However, which specific thalamic subregion first demonstrated ictal activity could not be reliably predicted based on clinical semiology or lobar localization of SOZs. Our findings document the feasibility and safety of bilateral multisite sampling from the human thalamus. This may allow more personalized thalamic targets to be identified for neuromodulation. Future studies are needed to determine if a personalized thalamic neuromodulation leads to greater improvements in clinical outcome.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/brain/awad121\n\nView details for PubMedID 37137813\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Receipt of opioid agonist treatment during early and late pregnancy for opioid use disorder may relate to varying perinatal risks.Weaimed to assess the effect of time-varying prenatal exposure toopioid agonist treatment using buprenorphine or methadone on adverse neonatal and pregnancy outcomes.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women with opioid use disorder using Rhode Island Medicaid claims data and vital statistics during 2008-16. Time-varying exposure was evaluated in early (0-20 weeks) and late (≥21 weeks) pregnancy. Marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment weighting were applied.RESULTS: Of 400 eligible pregnancies, 85 and 137 individuals received buprenorphine and methadone, respectively, during early pregnancy. Compared with 152 untreated pregnancieswith opioid use disorders, methadone exposure in both periods was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-5.95), low birth weight (aOR: 2.99; 95% CI 1.34-6.66), neonatal intensive care unit admission (aOR, 5.04; 95% CI 2.49-10.21), neonatal abstinence syndrome (aOR: 11.36; 95% CI 5.65-22.82), respiratory symptoms (aOR, 2.71; 95% CI 1.17-6.24), and maternal hospital stay > 7 days (aOR, 14.51; 95% CI 7.23-29.12). Similar patterns emerged for buprenorphine regarding neonatal abstinence syndrome (aOR: 10.27; 95% CI 4.91-21.47) and extended maternal hospital stay (aOR: 3.84; 95% CI 1.83-8.07). However, differences were found favoring the use of buprenorphine for preterm birth versus untreated pregnancies (aOR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.04-0.77), and for several outcomes versus methadone.CONCLUSIONS: Methadone and buprenorphine prescribed for the treatment of opioid use disorder during pregnancy are associated with varying perinatal risks. However, buprenorphine may be preferred in the setting of pregnancy opioid agonist treatment. Further research is necessary to confirm our findings and minimize residual confounding.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s40264-022-01267-z\n\nView details for PubMedID 36642778\n\nAbstract\n\nMood, anxiety disorders and suicidality are more frequent in people with epilepsy than in the general population. Yet, their prevalence and the types of mood and anxiety disorders associated with suicidality at the time of the epilepsy diagnosis is not established. We sought to answer these questions in patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy and to assess their association with suicidal ideation and attempts.The data were derived from the Human Epilepsy Project study. A total of 347 consecutive adults aged 18 to 60 years old with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy were enrolled within 4 months of starting treatment. The types of mood and anxiety disorders were identified with the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview, while suicidal ideation (lifetime, current, active and passive) and suicidal attempts (lifetime, current) were established with the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). Statistical analyses included T-test, Chi-square statistics and logistic regression analyses.A total of 151 (43.5%) subjects had a psychiatric diagnosis; 134 (38.6%) met criteria for a mood and / or anxiety disorder and 75 (21.6%) reported suicidal ideation with or without attempts. Mood (23.6%) and anxiety (27.4%) disorders had comparable prevalence rates, while both disorders occurred together in 43 patients (12.4%). Major depressive disorders (MDD) had a slightly higher prevalence than bipolar disorders (BPD) (9.5% vs 6.9%, respectively). Explanatory variables of suicidality included MDD, BPD, panic disorders and agoraphobia, with BPD and panic disorders being the strongest variables, particularly for active suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts.In patients with newly diagnosed focal epilepsy, the prevalence of mood, anxiety disorders and suicidality are higher than in the general population and comparable to those of patients with established epilepsy. Their recognition at the time of the initial epilepsy evaluation is of the essence.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1212/WNL.0000000000201671\n\nView details for PubMedID 36539302\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Assess the incidence and factors associated with major depressive episodes (MDE) and symptoms of depression and anxiety during pregnancy and postpartum periods in pregnant women with epilepsy (PWWE) compared to healthy pregnant women (HPW) and to non-pregnant women with epilepsy (NPWWE) in comparable timeframes.BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported higher rates of postpartum depression in women with epilepsy compared to women without epilepsy. However, the incidence of MDE using a structured interview during pregnancy and postpartum has not been directly compared to control groups, and the comparison of depression and anxiety symptoms and the role of associated factors remain ambiguous.DESIGN: /Methods. The Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study is a multicenter NIH-funded prospective observational parallel-group cohort study of PWWE and their children. This report examines mood disorders. Unlike prior epilepsy pregnancy studies, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) provided lifetime diagnoses, and repeated SCID mood modules assessed for MDE, the a priori primary outcome. Symptoms of depression (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)) and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)) were also assessed along with multiple clinical factors.RESULTS: The study included PWWE (n=331) and HPW (n=102) during pregnancy and postpartum, and NPWWE (n=102) at comparable times. No difference in SCID-diagnosed MDE incidence was found across groups, but BDI depressive symptoms were worse during pregnancy in PWWE vs NPWWE, and during postpartum vs HPW and NPWWE. BAI anxiety symptoms were worse during pregnancy in PWWE vs HPW and NPWWE, and during postpartum vs HPW. Factors associated with MDE during pregnancy/postpartum for PWWE included >1 seizure/90 days, anticonvulsant polytherapy, unplanned pregnancy, and lifetime history of mood disorder. Suicidal ideation from BDI or EPDS was related to BAI anxiety symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Although SCID-based MDE did not differ across groups, this prospective study confirms higher rates of psychiatric symptoms in patients with epilepsy during pregnancy and postpartum, provides new data on associated factors, and underscores the importance of anxiety in risk for depression and thoughts of death/dying or suicide. Given the risks, PWWE should be routinely assessed, and symptomatic patients should be offered treatment.The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01730170.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1212/WNL.0000000000200958\n\nView details for PubMedID 35977832\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study seeks to understand how sleep is affected in pregnant women with epilepsy (WWE) relative to healthy pregnant women during pregnancy and postpartum and to non-pregnant WWE during comparative time periods.BACKGROUND: Sleep impacts maternal health and mood during pregnancy. Maternal sleep disturbances are related to poor fetal growth and increased fetal deaths. Epilepsy is the most common neurologic condition in pregnancy. Sleep disruption can worsen epileptic seizures. The interplay between epilepsy, pregnancy, and sleep is poorly understood.DESIGN: /Methods: The Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study is an NIH-funded, prospective, observational, multicenter study, enrolling women from December 2012 through January 2016. Sleep quality was assessed utilizing the average Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index collected during pregnancy; postpartum; or analogous time periods. Sleep scores range from 0 to 21 with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality; scores > 5 are associated with poor sleep quality.RESULTS: Of 351 pregnant WWE, 105 healthy pregnant women, and 109 non-pregnant WWE enrolled in MONEAD, data from 241 pregnant WWE, 74 healthy pregnant women, and 84 non-pregnant WWE were analyzed. Pregnant WWE had worse sleep (higher mean sleep score) during pregnancy compared to healthy pregnant women in unadjusted analysis (p=0.006), but no longer significant in adjusted analysis (p=0.062), pregnant WWE (least square mean sleep score (95% CI) = 5.8 (5.5, 6.1)) vs. healthy pregnant women (5.1 (4.6, 5.7)). During postpartum, pregnant WWE (5.6 (5.4, 5.9)) had similarly impaired sleep compared to healthy pregnant women (5.7 (5.2, 6.2); adjusted p=0.838). Sleep was significantly worse in pregnant WWE vs non-pregnant WWE (for comparable time period) in pregnancy and postpartum in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Adjusted scores for pregnant WWE in pregnancy (5.7 (5.4, 6.0)) and postpartum (5.7 (5.4, 6.0)) compared to non-pregnant WWE (4.7 (4.2, 5.3); p=0.002) and (4.1 (3.6, 4.7); p<0.001), respectively. Sleep quality between pregnancy and postpartum varied only in healthy pregnant women (change in mean score = 0.8 (0.2, 1.3); p=0.01), whose sleep was worse in postpartum.CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant WWE had worse sleep during pregnancy and postpartum than non-pregnant WWE during comparable periods in the adjusted analysis.The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01730170.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1212/WNL.0000000000200959\n\nView details for PubMedID 35853745\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Electrical source localization (ESI) can help to identify the seizure onset zone or propagation zone, but it is unclear how dipole localization techniques influence surgical planning.METHODS: Patients who received a high density (HD)-EEG from 7/2014-7/2019 at Stanford were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (1) adequate epileptiform discharges were recorded for source localization analysis, (2) underwent surgical treatment, which was at least 6 months before the survey. Interictal ESI was performed with the LORETA method on age matched MRIs. Six neurophysiologists from the Stanford Epilepsy Program independently reviewed each case through an HIPPA-protected online survey. The same cases were presented again with additional data from the HD-EEG study. Ratings of how much the HD-EEG findings added value and in what way were recorded.RESULTS: Fifty out of 202 patients met the inclusion criteria, providing a total of 276h of HDEEG recordings. All patients had video EEG recordings and at least one brain MRI, 88 % had neuropsychological testing, 78 % had either a PET or SPECT scan. Additional HD-EEG information was rated as helpful in 83.8 %, not useful in 14.4 % and misleading in 1.8 % of cases. In 20.4 % of cases the HD-EEG information altered decision-making in a major way, such as choosing a different surgical procedure, avoidance of invasive recording or suggesting placement of invasive electrodes in a lobe not previously planned. In 21.5 % of cases, HD-EEG changed the plan in a minor way, e.g., extra invasive electrodes near the previously planned sites in the same sub-lobar region. In 42.3 % cases, HD-EEG did not change their plan but provided confirmation. In cases with normal MRI, additional HD-EEG information was more likely to change physicians' decision making during presurgical process when compared to the cases with MRI-visible lesions (53.3 % vs. 34.3 %, p=0.002). Among patients achieving Engel class I/II outcome, the concordance rate of HD-EEG and resection zone was 64.7 % versus 35.3 % with class III/IV (p=0.028).CONCLUSION: HD-EEG assists presurgical planning for refractory epilepsy patients, with a higher yield in patients with non-lesional MRIs. Concordance of HD-EEG dipole analysis localization and resection site is a favorable outcome indicator.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.clineuro.2022.107336\n\nView details for PubMedID 35716454\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: We examined mode of delivery among pregnant women with epilepsy (PWWE) vs. pregnant controls (PC). We hypothesize that PWWE are more likely to deliver by cesarean.STUDY DESIGN: The Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study is an observational, prospective, multi-center investigation of pregnancy outcomes funded by the NIH. MONEAD enrolled subjects December 2012 through January 2016. PWWE were matched to PC in a case:control ratio of 3:1. This analysis had 80% power to detect a 36% increase in cesarean frequency assuming a baseline rate of 30% among PC at an alpha=0.05.RESULTS: This report analyzed 331 PWWE (76%) and 102 PC (24%) who gave birth while enrolled in the study. PWWE and PC had similar rates of cesarean delivery (34.7% vs. 28.6%; P=0.27). Of women with cesarean, rates of cesarean without labor were similar between groups for those delivering in recruitment hospitals (48.2% vs. 50.0%), but in non-recruitment hospitals, cesarean rates without labor were over two-fold higher among PWWE than those of PC (68.8% vs. 30.8%; p-value=0.023). Receipt of a cesarean after labor did not differ for PWWE compared to PC, or by type of antiepileptic drug among the PWWE.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the obstetrical experiences of PWWE and PC are similar. An interesting deviation from this observation was the mode of delivery with higher unlabored cesarean rates occurring among PWWE in non-recruitment hospitals. As the study recruitment hospitals were tertiary academic centers and non-recruitment hospitals tended to be community-based institutions, differences in perinatal expertise might contribute to this difference.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1055/a-1788-4791\n\nView details for PubMedID 35253116\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: During pregnancy in women with epilepsy, lower blood concentrations of antiseizure medications can have adverse clinical consequences.Objective: To characterize pregnancy-associated concentration changes for several antiseizure medications among women with epilepsy.Design, Setting, and Participants: Enrollment in this prospective, observational cohort study, Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD), occurred from December 19, 2012, to February 11, 2016, at 20 US sites. Enrolled cohorts included pregnant women with epilepsy and nonpregnant control participants with epilepsy. Inclusion criteria were women aged 14 to 45 years, an intelligence quotient greater than 70 points, and, for the cohort of pregnant women, a fetal gestational age younger than 20 weeks. A total of 1087 women were assessed for eligibility; 397 were excluded and 230 declined. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2014, to June 30, 2021.Exposure: Medication plasma concentrations in women taking monotherapy or in combination with noninteracting medications. The cohort of pregnant women was monitored through 9 months post partum, with similar time points for control participants.Main Outcomes and Measures: Dose-normalized concentrations were calculated as total or unbound plasma medication concentrations divided by total daily dose. Phlebotomy was performed during 4 pregnancy study visits and 3 postpartum visits for the pregnant women and 7 visits over 18 months for control participants. The primary hypothesis was to test pregnancy changes of dose-normalized concentrations from nonpregnant postpartum samples compared with those of control participants.Results: Of the 351 pregnant women and 109 control participants enrolled in MONEAD, 326 pregnant women (median [range] age, 29 [19-43] years) and 104 control participants (median [range] age, 29 [16-43] years) met eligibility criteria for this analysis. Compared with postpartum values, dose-normalized concentrations during pregnancy were decreased by up to 56.1% for lamotrigine (15.60 mug/L/mg to 6.85 mug/L/mg; P<.001), 36.8% for levetiracetam (11.33 mug/L/mg to 7.16 mug/L/mg; P<.001), 17.3% for carbamazepine (11.56 mug/L/mg to 7.97 mug/L/mg; P=.03), 32.6% for oxcarbazepine (11.55 mug/L/mg to 7.79 mug/L/mg; P<.001), 30.6% for unbound oxcarbazepine (6.15 mug/L/mg to 4.27 mug/L/mg; P<.001), 39.9% for lacosamide (26.14 mug/L/mg to 15.71 mug/L/mg; P<.001), and 29.8% for zonisamide (40.12 mug/L/mg to 28.15 mug/L/mg; P<.001). No significant changes occurred for unbound carbamazepine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, and topiramate, although a decrease was observed for topiramate (29.83 mug/L/mg to 13.77 mug/L/mg; P = .18). Additionally, compared with dose-normalized concentrations from control participants, pregnancy dose-normalized median (SE) concentrations decreased significantly by week of gestational age: carbamazepine, -0.14 (0.06) mug/L/mg (P = .02); carbamazepine unbound, -0.04 (0.01) mug/L/mg (P = .01); lacosamide, -0.23 (0.07) mug/L/mg (P < .001); lamotrigine, -0.20 (0.02) mug/L/mg (P < .001); levetiracetam, -0.06 (0.03) mug/L/mg (P = .01); oxcarbazepine, -0.14 (0.04) mug/L/mg (P < .001); oxcarbazepine unbound, -0.11 (0.03) mug/L/mg (P < .001); and zonisamide, -0.53 (0.14) mug/L/mg (P<.001) except for topiramate (-0.35 [0.20] mug/L/mg per week) and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (0.02 [0.01] mug/L/mg).Conclusions and Relevance: Study results suggest that therapeutic drug monitoring should begin early in pregnancy and that increasing doses of these anticonvulsants may be needed throughout the course of pregnancy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaneurol.2021.5487\n\nView details for PubMedID 35157004\n\nAbstract\n\nWe carried out a systematic review of published information on transfer of antiseizure medications (ASMs) into breastmilk, ASM serum concentrations in breastfed infants, and the wellbeing of infants breastfed by mothers on ASM treatment. Information was extracted from 85 relevant articles. No data on ASM levels in breastmilk or in breastfed infants was identified for cannabidiol, cenobamate, clobazam, eslicarbazepine-acetate, everolimus, felbamate, fenfluramine, retigabine, rufinamide, stiripentol, tiagabine, and vigabatrin. For ASMs, with available information on levels in breastfed infants, very low concentrations (in the order of 10% or less of maternal serum concentrations) were reported for carbamazepine, gabapentin, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, valproate, and clonazepam. Slightly higher levels (up to approximately 30% of maternal serum concentrations) have been observed with lamotrigine and topiramate, and in single case reports for brivaracetam, lacosamide, and perampanel. High infant levels (30% up to 100% of maternal serum concentrations) have been reported with ethosuximide, phenobarbital and zonisamide. Adverse infant effects during breastfeeding by mothers on ASMs appear to be rare regardless of the type of ASM, but systematic study is limited. Prospective long-term follow-up studies of developmental outcomes among children who have been breastfed by mothers taking ASMs are sparse and have mainly involved children whose mothers were taking carbamazepine, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, phenytoin or valproate as monotherapy while breastfeeding. Although these studies have not indicated poorer outcome among breastfed children compared with those who were not breastfed, further data on long-term outcomes are needed to draw firm conclusions. It is concluded that breastfeeding should in general be encouraged in women taking ASMs, given the well-established benefits of breastfeeding with regard to both short- and long-term infant health in the general population. Counselling needs to be individualized including information on the current knowledge regarding the woman's specific ASM treatment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1684/epd.2022.1492\n\nView details for PubMedID 36193017\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: To study how early diagnoses from rapid EEG (rEEG) during the initial evaluation of patients with suspected non-convulsive seizures correlates with changes in anti-seizure medication (ASM) use.Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 100 consecutive adult patients at an academic medical center who underwent rEEG monitoring for suspected non-convulsive seizures. We collected information on the timing of ASM administration and categorized EEG diagnoses as seizures (SZ), highly epileptiform patterns (HEP), or normal or slow activity (NL/SL). We used a chitest to determine whether the use of ASMs was significantly different between SZ/HEP and NL/SL cases.Results: Of 100 patients, SZ were found in 5%, HEP in 14%, and no epileptiform/ictal activity in 81%. Forty-six percent of patients had received ASM(s) before rEEG. While 84% of HEP/SZ cases were started or continued on ASMs, only 51% of NL/SL cases were started or continued on ASMs after rEEG (chi[1, n=100] = 7.09, p=0.008). Thirty-seven patients had received sedation (i.e., propofol or dexmedetomidine) prior to rEEG. In 15 patients (13/30 NL/SL, 2/7 HEP/SZ), sedation was discontinued following rEEG.Significance: Our study demonstrates that seizures were rapidly ruled out with rEEG in 81% of patients while 19% of patients were rapidly identified as having seizures or being at higher risk for seizures. The rapid evaluation of patients correlated with a significant reduction in ASM treatment in NL/SL cases compared to HEP/SZ cases. Thus, early access to EEG information may lead to more informed and targeted management of patients suspected to have nonconvulsive seizures.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1684/epd.2022.1463\n\nView details for PubMedID 35860878\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate severe maternal morbidity (SMM) among patients with epilepsy and patients without epilepsy.METHODS: We retrospectively examined SMM using linked birth certificate and maternal hospital discharge records in California between 2007 and 2012. Epilepsy present at delivery admission was the exposure and was subtyped into generalized, focal and other less specified, or unspecified. The outcomes were SMM and nontransfusion SMM from delivery up to 42 days' postpartum, identified using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicators. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to adjust for confounders, which were selected a priori. We also estimated the association between epilepsy and SMM independent of comorbidities by using a validated obstetric comorbidity score. Severe maternal morbidity indicators were then compared using the same multivariable logistic regression models.RESULTS: Of 2,668,442 births, 8,145 (0.3%) were to patients with epilepsy; 637 (7.8%) had generalized, 6,250 (76.7%) had focal or other less specified, and 1,258 (15.4%) had unspecified subtypes. Compared with patients without epilepsy, patients with epilepsy had greater odds of SMM (4.3% vs 1.4%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.91, 95% CI 2.61-3.24) and nontransfusion SMM (2.9% vs 0.7%, aOR 4.16, 95% CI 3.65-4.75). Epilepsy remained significantly associated with increased SMM and nontransfusion SMM after additional adjustment for the obstetric comorbidity score, though the effects were attenuated. When grouped by organ system, all SMM indicators were significantly more common among patients with epilepsy-most notably those related to hemorrhage and transfusion.CONCLUSION: Severe maternal morbidity was significantly increased in patients with epilepsy, and SMM indicators across all organ systems contributed to this.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/AOG.0000000000004562\n\nView details for PubMedID 34619720\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: Prescription opioids are frequently used for pain management in pregnancy. Studies examining perinatal complications in mothers who received prescription opioids during pregnancy are still limited.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the association of prescription opioid use and maternal pregnancy and obstetric complications.METHODS: This retrospective cohort study with the Rhode Island (RI) Medicaid claims data linked to vital statistics throughout 2008-2015 included pregnant women aged 12-55 years with one or multiple live births. Women were excluded if they had cancer, opioid use disorder, or opioid dispensing prior to but not during pregnancy. Main outcomes included adverse pregnancy and obstetric complications. Marginal Structural Cox Models with time-varying exposure and covariates were applied to control for baseline and time-varying covariates. Analyses were conducted for outcomes that occurred 1 week after opioid exposure (primary) or within the same week as exposure (secondary). Sensitivity studies were conducted to assess the effects of different doses and individual opioids.RESULTS: Of 9823 eligible mothers, 545 (5.5%) filled one or more prescription opioid during pregnancy. Compared with those unexposed, no significant risk was observed in primary analyses, while in secondary analyses opioid-exposed mothers were associated with an increased risk of cesarean antepartum depression (HR 3.19; 95% CI 1.22-8.33), and cardiac events (HR 9.44; 95% CI 1.19-74.83). In sensitivity analyses, results are more prominent in high dose exposure and are consistent for individual opioids.CONCLUSIONS: Prescription opioid use during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of maternal complications.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s40264-021-01115-6\n\nView details for PubMedID 34609720\n\nAbstract\n\nTo determine whether growth measures at birth differ between offspring of pregnant women with epilepsy and healthy pregnant women.The Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study is a National Institutes of Health-funded, prospective, observational, multicenter investigation of pregnancy outcomes for mothers and their infants. Between 2012 and 2016, pregnant women with epilepsy and healthy pregnant women were enrolled at 20 US epilepsy centers. Pregnant women with epilepsy were exposed to various antiepileptic drugs. The main outcome measure was small for gestational age at birth. Principal univariate and multivariate analyses compared outcomes between pregnant women with epilepsy and healthy pregnant women. Secondary analyses focused on outcomes among mothers receiving different antiepileptic drug therapies.In total, 345 infants were born to 331 pregnant women with epilepsy and 106 infants were born to 102 healthy pregnant women. No differences were seen between infants born to pregnant women with epilepsy vs healthy pregnant women in preterm births, major congenital malformations, 5-minute Apgar <6, special care nursery or neonatal intensive care unit admission, gestational age, or any growth measure. There was no difference in the rates of small for gestational age status among infants born to pregnant women with epilepsy vs healthy pregnant women; however, infants born to mothers receiving topiramate had lower birth weight z scores and lamotrigine higher birth weight z scores compared with other monotherapies. The greatest rate of special care nursery or neonatal intensive care unit admission was observed among those on oxcarbazepine monotherapy.Maternal treatment with antiepileptic drugs, overall, appears unassociated with adverse early neonatal outcomes. However, specific monotherapies appear to affect fetal growth with, on average, the greatest reduction in birth weight z score observed among infants born to pregnant women with epilepsy exposed to topiramate monotherapy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ympdx.2021.100073\n\nView details for PubMedID 37234096\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10210636\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: The neurodevelopmental risks of fetal exposure are uncertain for many antiseizure medications (ASMs).Objective: To compare children at 2 years of age who were born to women with epilepsy (WWE) vs healthy women and assess the association of maximum ASM exposure in the third trimester and subsequent cognitive abilities among children of WWE.Design, Setting, and Participants: The Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (MONEAD) study is a prospective, observational, multicenter investigation of pregnancy outcomes that enrolled women from December 19, 2012, to January 13, 2016, at 20 US epilepsy centers. Children are followed up from birth to 6 years of age, with assessment at 2 years of age for this study. Of 1123 pregnant women assessed, 456 were enrolled; 426 did not meet criteria, and 241 chose not to participate. Data were analyzed from February 20 to December 4, 2020.Main Outcomes and Measures: Language domain score according to the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III), which incorporates 5 domain scores (language, motor, cognitive, social-emotional, and general adaptive), and association between BSID-III language domain and ASM blood levels in the third trimester in children of WWE. Analyses were adjusted for multiple potential confounding factors, and measures of ASM exposure were assessed.Results: The BSID-III assessments were analyzed in 292 children of WWE (median age,2.1 [range, 1.9-2.5] years; 155 female [53.1%] and 137 male [46.9%]) and 90 children of healthy women (median age,2.1 [range, 2.0-2.4] years; 43 female [47.8%] and 47 male [52.2%]). No differences were found between groups on the primary outcome of language domain (-0.5; 95% CI,-4.1 to 3.2). None of the other 4 BSID-III domains differed between children of WWE vs healthy women. Most WWE were taking lamotrigine and/or levetiracetam. Exposure to ASMs in children of WWE showed no association with the language domain. However, secondary analyses revealed that higher maximum observed ASM levels in the third trimester were associated with lower BSID-III scores for the motor domain (-5.6; 95% CI,-10.7 to -0.5), and higher maximum ASM doses in the third trimester were associated with lower scores in the general adaptive domain (-1.4; 95% CI,-2.8 to -0.05).Conclusions and Relevance: Outcomes of children at 2 years of age did not differ between children of WWE taking ASMs and children of healthy women.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01730170.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaneurol.2021.1583\n\nView details for PubMedID 34096986\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Vinpocetine has been shown to enhance memory in animal models, with possible cognitive benefit in humans. The present study sought to demonstrate if vinpocetine can enhance cognition in healthy volunteers or patients with epilepsy. In addition, we compare blood levels of vinpocetine and its active metabolite (apovincaminic acid; AVA) in humans and animals to further characterize factors related to possible therapeutic benefit.METHODS: The cognitive effects of vinpocetine were assessed in healthy adult volunteers (n = 8) using a double-blind, randomized, crossover design at single doses (placebo, 10, 20, and 60 mg oral). Cognitive effects of vinpocetine in patients with focal epilepsy (n = 8) were tested using a double-blind, randomized, crossover design at single doses (placebo, 20 mg oral) followed by one-month open label at 20 mg oral three times a day. The neuropsychological battery included both computerized and non-computerized tests. Levels of vinpocetine and AVA in the human studies were compared to levels in 45 mice across time dosed at 5-20 mg/kg intraperitoneal of vinpocetine.RESULTS: No significant cognitive benefits were seen in healthy volunteers or patients with epilepsy. No appreciable side effects occurred. Vinpocetine and AVA levels were lower in humans than animals.CONCLUSIONS: Vinpocetine was well tolerated, but was not associated with positive cognitive effects. However, blood levels obtained in humans were substantially less than levels in animals obtained from dosages known to be effective in one model. This suggests that higher dosages are needed in humans to assess vinpocetine's cognitive efficacy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107988\n\nView details for PubMedID 33957389\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: The rapid increase of opioid-related overdoses and deaths has become a public health concern in the US. Use of prescription opioids in pregnant women has increased; results from teratogenicity studies remain controversial.Objective: To evaluate the association between maternal prescription opioid use (excluding opioid use disorders) during pregnancy and the incidence of congenital malformations.Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective population-based cohort study evaluated linked Rhode Island Medicaid claims and vital statistics data of live births from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016. Data analysis was conducted from May 1, 2019, to May 31, 2020. Women who had a live birth during the study period, but no cancer or opioid use disorder, were followed up from 3 months before pregnancy to the end of pregnancy.Exposures: Data on the mother's prescription opioid exposure were obtained through pharmacy claims and exposure was defined as dispensing of at least 1 prescription opioid during the first, second, or third trimester.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was overall major or minor congenital malformations, defined as 1 or more major or minor congenital malformation. Secondary outcomes were defined as 10 specific categories of congenital malformations classified by organ systems using International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes.Results: Of 12 424 included pregnancies, 891 mothers (7.2%) received prescription opioids during pregnancy and 3153 infants (25.4%) were diagnosed with major or minor congenital malformations. Comparing prescription opioid exposure vs nonexposure, no excess risk was observed for major birth defects in infants with opioid exposure in trimester 1 (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.40; 95% CI, 0.84-2.34), and higher risks were found for overall minor birth defects in trimester 3 (aRR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.53) and minor birth defects in the musculoskeletal system in trimester 2 (aRR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.10-2.03) and trimester 3 (aRR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.23-2.22). Significant dose responses in selected minor malformations and effects of specific opioids were also identified. Hydrocodone in trimester 2 (aRR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.80-5.03) and oxycodone in trimester 3 (aRR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.37-4.02) were associated with plagiocephaly, polydactyly, and other specified congenital deformities of the hip.Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest a higher risk of minor congenital malformations associated with use of prenatal prescription opioids in trimester 3, which seems to be dose-dependent. Further investigation is needed to establish causality and explore the physiologic plausibility of the association.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.5708\n\nView details for PubMedID 33847750\n\nAbstract\n\nTo establish whether earlier treatment using direct brain-responsive neurostimulation for medically intractable focal-onset seizures is associated with better mood and Quality of Life (QoL) compared to later treatment intervention.Data were retrospectively analyzed from prospective clinical trials of a direct brain-responsive neurostimulator (RNS® System) for treatment of adults with medically intractable focal-onset epilepsy. Participants completed the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE-31) yearly through 9 years of follow-up and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) through 2 years of follow-up. Changes in each assessment after treatment with responsive neurostimulation were calculated for patients who began treatment within 10 years of seizure onset (early) and those who began treatment 20 years or more after seizure onset (late).The median duration of epilepsy was 18.3 years at enrollment. At 9 years, both the early (N = 51) and late (N = 109) treatment groups experienced similar and significant reductions in the frequency of disabling seizures (73.4% and 77.8%, respectively). The early treatment patients had significant improvements in QoL and mood. However, the late treatment patients not only failed to show these improvements but also declined in the emotional QoL subscale.Patients treated with brain-responsive neurostimulation earlier in the course of their epilepsy show significant improvements in multiple domains of QoL and mood that are not observed in patients treated later in the course of their epilepsy despite similar efficacy in seizure reduction. Even with similar and substantial reductions in seizure frequency, the comorbidities of uncontrolled epilepsy may be less responsive to treatment when too many years have passed. The results of this study suggest that, as with resective and ablative surgery, treatment with brain-responsive neurostimulation should be delivered as early as possible in the course of medically resistant epilepsy to maximize the opportunity for improvements in mood and QoL.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107868\n\nView details for PubMedID 33684783\n\nAbstract\n\nSeveral studies have reported increasing prevalence of prescription opioid use among pregnant women. However, little is known regarding the effects of maternal opioid use on neurodevelopmental disorders in early childhood in pregnant women with no evidence of opioid use disorders or drug dependence.The aim of this study was to quantify the association between prenatal opioid exposure from maternal prescription use and neurodevelopmental outcomes in early childhood.This retrospective study included pregnant women aged 12-55 years and their live-birth infants born from 2010 to 2012 present in Optum's deidentified Clinformatics® Data Mart database. Eligible infants born to mothers without opioid use disorders or drug dependence were followed till occurrence of neurodevelopmental disorders, loss to follow-up, or study end (December 31, 2017), whichever came first. Propensity score by fine stratification was applied to adjust for confounding by demographic characteristics, obstetric characteristics, maternal comorbid mental and pain conditions, and measures of burden of illnesses and to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Exposed and unexposed infants were compared on the incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders.Of 24,910 newborns, 7.6% (1899) were prenatally exposed to prescription opioids. Overall, 1562 children were diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders, with crude incidence rates of 2.9 per 100 person-years in exposed children versus 2.5 per 100 person-years in unexposed children. After adjustment, we observed no association between fetal opioid exposure and the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.92-1.32). However, increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders were observed in children with longer cumulative exposure duration (HR 1.70; 95% CI 1.05-2.96) or high cumulative opioid doses (HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01-1.54).In pregnant women without opioid use disorders or drug dependence, maternal opioid use was not associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in early childhood. However, increased risks of early neurodevelopmental disorders were observed in children born to women receiving prescription opioids for longer duration and at higher doses during pregnancy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s40264-021-01080-0\n\nView details for PubMedID 34100263\n\nAbstract\n\nThe purpose of this study was to establish whether a past psychiatric history could play a role in the development of psychiatric treatment-emergent adverse events (PTEAEs) in patients randomized to perampanel (PER) or placebo.The development of PTEAEs was compared between patients with/without a psychiatric history in a post hoc analysis from four randomized placebo-controlled trials (RPCTs) of PER (304/305/306/335) in patients with treatment-resistant focal epilepsy.Among the 2,187 patients enrolled in the RPCTs, 352 (16.1%) had a psychiatric history (PER n = 244; placebo n = 108), while 1835 patients (83.9%) did not (PER n = 1325; placebo n = 510). Compared to patients without a psychiatric history, those with a positive history reported more PTEAEs for both patients randomized to PER (11.8% vs. 29.9%, p < 0.01) or to placebo (9.2% vs. 19.4%, p < 0.01). The prevalence of PTEAEs was not higher among patients randomized to 2 mg and 4 mg/day doses than placebo in both those with and without psychiatric history. Rather, the higher prevalence rates were among subjects randomized to 8 mg (29.8%) and 12 mg (36.4%) PER doses in patients with a past psychiatric history.A psychiatric history appears to increase the risk of PTEAEs in patients randomized to placebo and to PER at doses of 8 and 12 mg/day. It should be identified in all patients considered for treatment with PER, particularly when prescribed at doses above 4 mg/day.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108380\n\nView details for PubMedID 34735963\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: To evaluate declarative memory outcomes in medically refractory epilepsy patients who underwent either a highly selective laser ablation of the amygdalohippocampal complex or a conventional open temporal lobe resection. Methods: Post-operative change scores were examined for verbal memory outcome in epilepsy patients who underwent stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy (SLAH: n = 40) or open resection procedures (n = 40) using both reliable change index (RCI) scores and a 1-SD change metric. Results: Using RCI scores, patients undergoing open resection (12/40, 30.0%) were more likely to decline on verbal memory than those undergoing SLAH (2/40 [5.0%], p = 0.0064, Fisher's exact test). Patients with language dominant procedures were much more likely to experience a significant verbal memory decline following open resection (9/19 [47.4%]) compared to laser ablation (2/19 [10.5%], p = 0.0293, Fisher's exact test). 1 SD verbal memory decline frequently occurred in the open resection sample of language dominant temporal lobe patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (8/10 [80.0%]), although it rarely occurred in such patients after SLAH (2/14, 14.3%) (p = 0.0027, Fisher's exact test). Memory improvement occurred significantly more frequently following SLAH than after open resection. Interpretation: These findings suggest that while verbal memory function can decline after laser ablation of the amygdalohippocampal complex, it is better preserved when compared to open temporal lobe resection. Our findings also highlight that the dominant hippocampus is not uniquely responsible for verbal memory. While this is at odds with our simple and common heuristic of the hippocampus in memory, it supports the findings of non-human primate studies showing that memory depends on broader medial and lateral TL regions.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3389/fneur.2021.779495\n\nView details for PubMedID 34956059\n\nAbstract\n\nInterictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) can impair memory. The properties of IEDs most detrimental to memory, however, are undefined. We studied the impact of temporal and spatial characteristics of IEDs on list learning. Subjects completed a memory task during intracranial EEG recordings including hippocampal depth and temporal neocortical subdural electrodes. Subjects viewed a series of objects, and after a distracting task, recalled the objects from the list. The impacts of IED presence, duration, and propagation to neocortex during encoding of individual stimuli were assessed. The effects of IED total number and duration during maintenance and recall periods on delayed recall performance were also determined. The influence of IEDs during recall was further investigated by comparing the likelihood of IEDs preceding correctly recalled items vs. periods of no verbal response. Across 6 subjects, we analyzed 28 hippocampal and 139 lateral temporal contacts. Recall performance was poor, with a median of 17.2% correct responses (range 10.4-21.9%). Interictal epileptiform discharges during encoding, maintenance, and recall did not significantly impact task performance, and there was no significant difference between the likelihood of IEDs during correct recall vs. periods of no response. No significant effects of discharge duration during encoding, maintenance, or recall were observed. Interictal epileptiform discharges with spread to lateral temporal cortex during encoding did not adversely impact recall. A post hoc analysis refining model assumptions indicated a negative impact of IED count during the maintenance period, but otherwise confirmed the above results. Our findings suggest no major effect of hippocampal IEDs on list learning, but study limitations, such as baseline hippocampal dysfunction, should be considered. The impact of IEDs during the maintenance period may be a focus of future research.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108209\n\nView details for PubMedID 34416521\n\nAbstract\n\nEpilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurologic conditions, affecting almost 70 million people worldwide. In the United States, 1.3 million women with epilepsy (WWE) are in their active reproductive years. Women with epilepsy (WWE) face gender-specific challenges such as pregnancy, seizure exacerbation with hormonal pattern fluctuations, contraception, fertility, and menopause. Precision medicine, which applies state-of-the art molecular profiling to diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic problems, has the potential to advance the care of WWE by precisely tailoring individualized management to each patient's needs. For example, antiseizure medications (ASMs) are among the most common teratogens prescribed to women of childbearing potential. Teratogens act in a dose-dependent manner on a susceptible genotype. However, the genotypes at risk for ASM-induced teratogenic deficits are unknown. Here we summarize current challenging issues for WWE, review the state-of-art tools for clinical precision medicine approaches, perform a systematic review of pharmacogenomic approaches in management for WWE, and discuss potential future directions in this field. We envision a future in which precision medicine enables a new practice style that puts focus on early detection, prediction, and targeted therapies for WWE.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107928\n\nView details for PubMedID 33774354\n\nAbstract\n\nFolic acid supplementation during the periconceptual period has been shown to improve cognitive outcomes in children of women with epilepsy taking anti-seizure medications (ASMs). The dose of folic acid necessary to provide positive cognitive outcomes is unclear. In many countries including the United States, food is fortified with folic acid, but no data exist on how food fortification may affect cognition in children with fetal-ASM exposure. This study evaluated the effect of dietary folate from natural folates plus folic acid fortification, separate from folic acid vitamin supplements, on age-6 year IQ in children with fetal-ASM exposure.Data from the Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (NEAD) study were retrospectively analyzed for this investigation. Assessment of nutrient intake was conducted using the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire-98. The primary outcome of the present study was to assess association of maternal prepregnancy nutrient levels to child age-6 IQ.Folate from food alone without supplement was not associated with improvement of age-6 IQ in children with fetal ASM exposure (95% CI: -11.7-2.3, p = 0.187). Periconceptual folate supplement use was associated with a 10.1-point higher age-6 IQ (95% CI: 5.2-15.0, p < .001). Total combined folate from food plus supplement also showed that higher intake of folate was associated with higher age-6 IQ (Coefficient: 4.5, 95% CI: 2.0-6.9, p < .001). Six other nutrients from food and supplements were analyzed (Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Omega 3, Gamma Tocopherol, and Vitamin B12) and had no significant association with age 6-IQ.Dietary content of folate, even in a country where food is fortified with folic acid, is not sufficient to provide improved cognitive outcomes for children of women taking ASMs during pregnancy. Folate supplementation is needed for significant improvement in cognitive outcomes, specifically age-6 IQ.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107688\n\nView details for PubMedID 33636531\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Among women with epilepsy, studies regarding changes in seizure frequency during pregnancy have been limited by the lack of an appropriate nonpregnant comparator group to provide data on the natural course of seizure frequency in both groups.METHODS: In this prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study, we compared the frequency of seizures during pregnancy through the peripartum period (the first 6 weeks after birth) (epoch 1) with the frequency during the postpartum period (the following 7.5 months after pregnancy) (epoch 2). Nonpregnant women with epilepsy were enrolled as controls and had similar follow-up during an 18-month period. The primary outcome was the percentage of women who had a higher frequency of seizures that impaired awareness during epoch 1 than during epoch 2. We also compared changes in the doses of antiepileptic drugs that were administered in the two groups during the first 9 months of epoch 1.RESULTS: We enrolled 351 pregnant women and 109 controls with epilepsy. Among the 299 pregnant women and 93 controls who had a history of seizures that impaired awareness and who had available data for the two epochs, seizure frequency was higher during epoch 1 than during epoch 2 in 70 pregnant women (23%) and in 23 controls (25%) (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 1.60). During pregnancy, the dose of an antiepileptic drug was changed at least once in 74% of pregnant women and in 31% of controls (odds ratio, 6.36; 95% CI, 3.82 to 10.59).CONCLUSIONS: Among women with epilepsy, the percentage who had a higher incidence of seizures during pregnancy than during the postpartum period was similar to that in women who were not pregnant during the corresponding epochs. Changes in doses of antiepileptic drugs occurred more frequently in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women during similar time periods.

In addition, changes in seizure frequency, anti-seizure medications, and RNS System setting adjustments during pregnancy were investigated.RESULTS: A total of 10 subjects and 14 pregnancies were identified. The mean age at conception was 30.6 ± 4.3 years old. The mean age at implantation was 29.8 ± 4.4 years old. The mean stimulation charge densities ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 muC/cm2 during pregnancy. Obstetric complications included recurrent miscarriage (1 patient), cesarean section (3 patients) due to preeclampsia, non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing or prolonged labor, preterm birth (1 patient), and preeclampsia (1 patient). No still birth, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, eclampsia, or maternal mortality were observed. No RNS System-exposed pregnancies had major congenital malformations. One offspring had a minor congenital anomaly of cryptorchidism in a pregnancy complicated with risk factors of advanced maternal age and bicornuate uterus.SIGNIFICANCE: The present study is the first report of RNS System-exposed pregnancies in WWE to date. No major congenital malformations were identified. All of the obstetric complications were within the expected range of those in WWE based on previously published data. The sample size of our study is small, so accumulation of additional cases will further help depict the safety profile of treatment with the RNS System during pregnancy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2020.106532\n\nView details for PubMedID 33360540\n\nAbstract\n\nThis is the second of two narrative reviews on cognitive disorders in epilepsy (companion manuscript: Cognitive disorders in epilepsy I: Clinical experience, real-world evidence and recommendations). Its focus is on the clinical targets, indications, and the selection of neuropsychological test instruments. Cognitive assessment has become an essential tool for the diagnosis and outcome control in the clinical management of epilepsy. The diagnostics of basic and higher brain functions can provide valuable information on lateralized and localized brain dysfunctions associated with epilepsy, its underlying pathologies and treatment. In addition to the detection or verification of deficits, neuropsychology reveals the patient's cognitive strengths and, thus, information about the patient reserve capacities for functional restitution and compensation. Neuropsychology is an integral part of diagnostic evaluations mainly in the context of epilepsy surgery to avoid new or additional damage to preexisting neurocognitive impairments. In addition and increasingly, neuropsychology is being used as a tool for monitoring of the disease and its underlying pathologies, and it is suited for the quality and outcome control of pharmacological or other non-invasive medical intervention. This narrative review summarizes the present state of neuropsychological assessments in epilepsy, reveals diagnostic gaps, and shows the great need for education, homogenization, translation and standardization of instruments.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.seizure.2020.09.031\n\nView details for PubMedID 33172763\n\nAbstract\n\nDisagreements in science and medicine are not uncommon, and formal exchanges of disagreements serve a variety of valuable roles. As identified by a Nature Methods editorial entitled \"The Power of Disagreement\" (2016), disagreements bring attention to best practices so that differences in interpretation do not result from inferior data sets or confirmation bias, \"prompting researchers to take a second look at evidence that is not in agreement with their hypothesis, rather than dismiss it as artifacts.\" Graver and Green published reasons why they disagree with a recent clinical case report and a decades old randomized control trial characterizing the effect of an acute 2 mg dosing of lorazepam on the Word Memory Test. In this article, we formally responded to their commentary to further clarify the reasons for our data interpretations. These two opposing views provide an excellent learning opportunity, particularly for students, demonstrating the importance of careful articulation of the rationale behind certain conclusions from different perspectives. We encourage careful review of the original articles being discussed so the neuropsychologists can read both positions and decide which interpretation of the findings they consider most sound.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1080/23279095.2020.1798961\n\nView details for PubMedID 32735139\n\nAbstract\n\nTreatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in clinical trials are typically reported for the full duration of the treatment period including titration and maintenance. Drug-related central nervous system (CNS) TEAEs are common with antiseizure medications (ASMs) and can affect drug tolerability. In this report, we test the hypothesis that drug-related CNS TEAEs have early onset and decrease with time. Unlike prior ASM clinical trials, a novel design was used for brivaracetam (BRV) without initial drug titration allowing assessment of habituation to TEAEs separate from dose titration.Data were pooled from three studies (N01252 [NCT00490035], N01253 [NCT00464269], N01358 [NCT01261325]) in adult patients (≥16 years of age) with focal seizures receiving BRV adjunctive therapy. This post hoc analysis reports data on the prevalence and incidence of all drug-related CNS TEAEs and all TEAEs over time in patients who received BRV doses of 50-200 mg/day (without titration) vs. placebo during a 12-week treatment period.A total of 1262 patients received the following: placebo (n = 459), BRV 50 mg/day (n = 200), BRV 100 mg/day (n = 353), and BRV 200 mg/day (n = 250). Both the incidence (p < .0001) and prevalence (p < .0001) of drug-related CNS TEAEs (all with frequency ≥ 5%) changed across time with peak TEAEs in week 1 then significantly reducing over the first 6 weeks for prevalence and the first 3 weeks for incidence.Drug-related CNS TEAEs occurred early and substantially habituated over several weeks. TEAEs of ASMs might be better represented by division into early and late phases to guide clinician monitoring and patient expectations.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107212\n\nView details for PubMedID 32544700\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ILAE Task Force on Women and Pregnancy conducted a survey among ILAE Chapters of their use of guidelines or recommendations for the management of women with epilepsy during pregnancy. A web-based questionnaire including 10 questions was sent to the 118 ILAE Chapters in December 2017 with repeated reminders until the end of February 2018. In total, 77 chapters (65%) responded, although not to all questions. Out of those responding, 68% reported having guidelines or recommendations, 34% of which were from 2014 or earlier. At least 20% of the guidelines did not include information on possible risk to cognitive development, information regarding specific risks with specific antiepileptic drugs, nor recommendations regarding selection of antiepileptic drugs. Among those responding to the question, 91% reported that recommendations were made regarding folate supplementation, but the recommended dose ranged from 0.4 mg/d to 4 mg/d or more; 34% did not include recommendations regarding drug level monitoring during pregnancy, and 19% did not include guidelines on breastfeeding. Our survey demonstrates that there is a need for the development of up-to-date, globally applicable recommendations for the management of epilepsy during pregnancy.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/epi4.12420\n\nView details for PubMedID 32913945\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC7469854\n\nAbstract\n\nThis is the first of two narrative reviews on cognitive disorders in epilepsy (companion publication : Cognitive disorders in epilepsy II: Clinical Targets, Indications and Selection of Test Instruments). Its focus is on clinical experience, real-world evidence, and clinical recommendations. Cognitive disorders are a common comorbidity in children and adults with epilepsy. These cognitive disturbances may preceed the onset of seizures and are multifactorial including contributions by pre-existing brain damage, seizures, interictal epileptic discharges, and treatments including medications and surgery. Comorbid cognitive impairments can have a negative impact on the quality of life in people with epilepsy. They are under-identified and frequently not treated. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, such as ADHD can also contribute to a worse cognitive performance and can benefit from pharmacotherapy with CNS stimulants. Likewise, mood disorders cause a subjective perception of poor memory and attention, which can be reversed with antidepressants of the SSRI family. This narrative review discusses these issues from a real-world clinical perspective in children and adults with newly diagnosed and chronic epilepsy. The need for further research to understand and treat these disorders is noted.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.seizure.2020.10.009\n\nView details for PubMedID 33127274\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: There is limited information on infant drug exposure via breastfeeding by mothers who are receiving antiepileptic drug therapy.Objective: To provide direct, objective information on antiepileptic drug exposure through breast milk.Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study was conducted between December 2012 to October 2016, with follow-up in children until 6 years of age at 20 sites across the United States. Data were collected via an observational multicenter investigation (Maternal Outcomes and Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs [MONEAD]) of outcomes in pregnant mothers with epilepsy and their children. Pregnant women with epilepsy who were aged 14 to 45 years, had pregnancies that had progressed to less than 20 weeks' gestational ag"
