        "text": "Volatile constituents have been characterized from two species of ponerine ants in the genusMesoponera. 2,5-Dimethyl-3-isopentyl-pyrazine has been identified from cephalic extracts ofM. castanea andM. castaneicolor, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Combined gasters and thoraces of both species are also characterized by the presence of nonanal, nonanoic acid, isovaleric acid, phenylacetic acid, and undecanal, as well as a series of aliphatic amines and amides.N-Isoamylnonylamine was a major constituent that was accompanied byN-isoamylnonenylamine,N,N-diisoamylnonylamine,N-acetyl nonylamine,N-formyl isoamylnonylamine,N-isovaleroyl nonylamine, and several other secondary and tertiary amines. The possible significance of the amines and amides as idiosyncratic natural products ofMesoponera species is discussed."
