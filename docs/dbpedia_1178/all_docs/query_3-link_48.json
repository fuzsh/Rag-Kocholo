From restrictions on underage and dark magic, to the bureaucratic encroachment on defensive magic, the vulnerable (half-bloods), and magically disabled (squibs), magical skill and technology are two parts of what continues to make this series so important for the 21st century imagination.\n\nDan McClain (Loyola)\n\n6:30 pm, McGuire Hall\n\n2016 Andy Warhol Lecture\n\nEach year Loyola's Committee on Catholic Social Thought invites an artist or commentator to campus to speak on themes dear to Andy Warhol.
