        "text": "1640\n\nStephen Daye prints The Whole Book of Psalms, the first book published in British North America, using the first printing press brought to the colonies. Elizabeth Glover, owner of the printing press, marries Harvard President Henry Dunster. The printing press, plates, and paper are bequeathed to Harvard University upon her death in 1643, laying the foundation for what will become Harvard University Press.\n\n1913\n\nOn January 13, the Harvard Corporation officially establishes the entity known today as Harvard University Press, housed in Randall Hall on Kirkland Street, Cambridge, where William James Hall now stands.\n\n1920\n\nHarold Murdock, a Boston banker, succeeds the first Director of the Press, C. C. Lane. Under Murdock, the Press undertakes the strategy of publishing general interest books based on lectures delivered at Harvard.\n\n1934\n\nHarvard University Press becomes the American publisher of the Loeb Classical Library, which James Loeb (Class of 1888) bequeathed to the university upon his death in 1933.\n\n1935\n\nThe historian Dumas Malone, Editor-in-Chief of the Dictionary of American Biography, becomes the Press’s third Director. He defines its mission as “scholarship plus,” that is, not merely highly specialized works, but works for the general intellectual reader. Malone hires the Press’s first manuscript editors and establishes the high editorial standards for which the Press is known.\n\n1949\n\nWaldron Phoenix Belknap, Jr., endows the Belknap imprint with a significant gift to the Press. The imprint is to be modeled on the Clarendon Press imprint at Oxford University Press. Ten years later, Belknap’s mother, Rey Hutchings Belknap, adds her own fortune to the fund. The books published under this imprint go on to win major prizes such as the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the Bancroft Prize.\n\n1967\n\nMark Carroll, who had joined the Press in 1956, becomes Director in 1967. During Carroll’s brief tenure the Press publishes such seminal works as John Rawls’s A Theory of Justice and E. O. Wilson’s The Insect Societies.\n\n1972\n\nArthur J. Rosenthal, founder and publisher of Basic Books, arrives as the new Director. He builds on Dumas Malone’s vision of “scholarship plus” by making Harvard’s list more appealing to a general readership beyond the academy, establishing a model other university presses would follow in years to come. Among the titles published during his tenure are Bernard Bailyn’s The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson, winner of the National Book Award; E. O. Wilson’s On Human Nature, winner of the Pulitzer Prize; Alfred Chandler’s The Visible Hand, which received both the Pulitzer and Bancroft Prizes in 1978; Carol Gilligan’s In a Different Voice; Thomas K. McCraw’s Pulitzer-winning Prophets of Regulation; and Jane Goodall’s The Chimpanzees of Gombe.\n\n1990\n\nWilliam P. Sisler, formerly of Oxford University Press, assumes the directorship. During his tenure, the Press publishes such distinguished books as Toni Morrison’s Playing in the Dark, Bruno Latour’s We Have Never Been Modern, Walter Benjamin’s The Arcades Project, Stephen Jay Gould’s The Structure of Evolutionary Theory, Mary Beard’s The Roman Triumph, Charles Taylor’s A Secular Age, Amartya Sen’s The Idea of Justice, Sarah Blaffer Hrdy’s Mothers and Others, Nick Sousanis’s Unflattening, and Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century; revives and completes the Image of the Black in Western Art volumes; debuts three more classics in translation series; and launches the digital Loeb Classical Library.\n\n2010\n\nRohan Narayana Murty establishes the Murty Classical Library with a $5.2 million gift, extending the Press’s classics in translation list beyond European traditions. Consequently, Harvard University Press begins to sell books under its own imprint in South Asia, leading the way for other American university presses to follow suit a few years later.\n\n2017\n\nGeorge Andreou, veteran publishing executive from Alfred A. Knopf, is appointed Director and introduces a series of modernizations to translate “scholarship plus” into the twenty-first century. Among the authors published: Kathleen Belew, Robert Brandom, Justice Stephen Breyer, Daphne Brooks, Chen Jian, Marie Favereau, Leroy Hood, Julian Jackson, Joseph LeDoux, Richard Ovenden, Priya Satia, O. Carter Snead, and J. Craig Venter. Critical partnerships with W. W. Norton & Company and HarperCollins India, new collaborations with world-renowned graphic designers and website developers, as well as a renewed attention to training a future generation of scholarly editors begin.\n\n2023\n\nEmerging from the pandemic years, the Press focuses on unifying its digital footprint to engage readers, authors, journalists, and educators worldwide across a range of platforms. The present website, launched in 2023, is the first chapter of that story."
