        "text": "Praise for How Life Works\n\nxx\n\nI have taught botany and then Biology II for over 20 years and have been very frustrated when I have realized how little knowledge students retained. Since we have gone to this textbook, I find that the questions students are asking in class are much more probing than those in the past, and the students seem much more engaged in the topics. I am hopeful that this approach will help our students be deeper thinkers and better scientists.\n\nâ GLORIA CADDELL, University of Central Oklahoma\n\nOne of the things that really sold me on this text was the LaunchPad system: easy to use; intuitive navigation; really good questions that match the sophistication of the text; love the LearningCurve activities; use most of the animations in my lectures!\n\nâ SARA CARLSON, University of Akron\n\nThis is the best set of questions Iâve ever seen in a textbook. They are thorough and the right mix of challenging the student with requiring memorization of important details.\n\nâ KURT ELLIOT, Northwest Vista College\n\nWe have all seen an improvement in our studentsâ understanding of the material this year, the first year that we used the Morris text.\n\nâ ANUPAMA SESHAN, Emmanuel College\n\nI like the figures, especially the 3D ones â we focus on âperceptual abilityâ training in our classes and figures that encourage students to think about cells in 3D are excellent!\n\nâ KIRKWOOD LAND, University of the Pacific\n\nThese chapters all seem to draw students through the course by referencing what they have learned previously and then adding new information. This makes the course seem like a complete story instead of a series of encyclopedia entries to be learned in isolation.\n\nâ TIM KROFT, Auburn University at Montgomery\n\nWe used this book last year and overall felt that it represented a major improvement from our previous text.\n\nâ PETER ARMBRUSTER, Georgetown University\n\nxxi\n\nGood questions are just as important as a good textbook. The available variety of assessment tools was very important for our adoption of this text.\n\nâ MATTHEW BREWER, Georgia State University\n\nIf the whole book reads like this I would love to use it! This is the way I like to teach! I want students to understand rather than memorize and this chapter seems aimed at this.\n\nâ JENNIFER SCHRAMM, Chemeketa Community College\n\nThe artwork seems very clear- cut and geared to giving the students a very specific piece of information with a very simple example. This should greatly help students with forming a visual image of the various subjects.\n\nâ CHRIS PETRIE, Eastern Florida State College\n\nThe writing style is excellent, it makes a great narrative and incorporates key scientific experiments into the explanation of photosynthesis.\n\nâ DIANNE JENNING, Virginia Commonwealth University\n\nI think HLW does a better job of presenting introductory material than our current text, which tends to overwhelm students.\n\nâ LAURA HILL, University of Vermont\n\nWith the quick checks and the experiments the first chapter already has the learners thinking about experiments and critical analysis.\n\nâ JOHN KOONTZ, University of Tennessee Knoxville\n\nThis book moves teaching away from merely understanding all of the bold terms in a textbook in order to spit them back on a multiple- choice test. I can use this text in order to prepare my students to understand and learn the general principles and concepts in biology and how those concepts translate across different levels of biology. I would not trade this textbook for any other book on the market.\n\nâ PAUL MOORE, Bowling Green State University\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nxxiii\n\nBiology: How Life Works is not only a book. Instead, it is an integrated set of resources to support student learning and instructor teaching in introductory biology. As a result, we work closely with an entire community of authors, publishers, instructors, reviewers, and students. We would like to thank this dedicated group.\n\nFirst and foremost, we thank the thousands of students we have collectively taught. Their curiosity, intelligence, and enthusiasm have been sources of motivation for all of us.\n\nOur teachers and mentors have provided us with models of patience, creativity, and inquisitiveness that we strive to bring into our own teaching and research. They encourage us to be life- long learners, teachers, and scholars.\n\nWe feel very lucky to be a partner with W. H. Freeman and Macmillan Learning. From the start, they have embraced our project, giving us the space and room to achieve something unique, while at the same time providing guidance, support, and input from the broader community of instructors and students.\n\nBeth Cole, our acquisitions editor, deserves thanks for taking on the second edition and becoming our leader. She keeps a watchful eye on important trends in science, education, and technology, carefully listens to what we want to do, and helps us put our aspirations in a larger context.\n\nLead developmental editor Lisa Samols continues to have just the right touchâ the ability to listen as well as offer intelligent suggestions, serious with a touch of humor, quiet but persistent. Senior developmental editor Susan Moran has an eye for detail and the uncanny ability to read the manuscript like a student. Developmental editor Erica Champion brings intelligence and thoughtfulness to her edits.\n\nKaren Misler kept us all on schedule in a clear and firm but always understanding and compassionate way.\n\nLindsey Jaroszewicz, our market development manager, is remarkable for her energy and enthusiasm, her attention to detail, and her creativity in ways to reach out to instructors and students. Will Moore, our marketing manager, refined the story of How Life Works 2e and works tirelessly with our sales teams to bring the second edition to instructors and students everywhere.\n\nWe thank Robert Errera for coordinating the move from manuscript to the page, and Nancy Brooks for helping to even out the prose. We also thank Diana Blume, our design director, Tom Carling, our text and cover designer, and Sheridan Sellers, our compositor. Together, they managed the look and feel of the book, coming up with creative solutions for page layout.\n\nIn digital media, we thank Amanda Nietzel for her editorial insight in making pedagogically useful media tools, and Keri deManigold and Chris Efstratiou for managing and coordinating the media and websites. They each took on this project with dedication, persistence, enthusiasm, and attention to detail that we deeply appreciate.\n\nWe are extremely grateful to Elaine Palucki for her insight into teaching and learning strategies, Donna Brodman for coordinating the many reviewers, and Jane Taylor, Alexandra Garrett, and Abigail Fagan for their consistent and tireless support.\n\nImagineering under the patient and intelligent guidance of Mark Mykytuik provided creative, insightful art to complement, support, and reinforce the text. We also thank our illustration coordinator, Matt McAdams, for skillfully guiding our collaboration with Imagineering. Christine Buese, our photo editor, and Lisa Passmore and Richard Fox, our photo researchers, provided us with a steady stream of stunning photos, and never gave up on those hard- to- find shots. Paul Rohloff, our production manager, ensured that the journey from manuscript to printing was seamless.\n\nWe would also like to acknowledge Kate Parker, Publisher of Sciences, Chuck Linsmeier, Vice President of Editorial, Susan Winslow, Managing Director, and Ken Michaels, Chief Executive Officer, for their support of How Life Works and our unique approach.\n\nWe also sincerely thank Erin Betters, Jere A. Boudell, Donna Koslowsky, and Jon Stoltzfus for thoughtful and insightful contributions to the assessment materials.\n\nWe are extremely grateful for all of the hard work and expertise of the sales representatives, regional managers, and regional sales specialists. We have enjoyed meeting and working with this dedicated sales staff, who are the ones that ultimately put the book in the hands of instructors.\n\nCountless reviewers made invaluable contributions to this book and deserve special thanks. From catching mistakes to suggesting new and innovative ways to organize the content, they provided substantial input to the book. They brought their collective years of teaching to the project, and their suggestions are tangible in every chapter.\n\nFinally, we would like to thank our families. None of this would have been possible without their support, inspiration, and encouragement.\n\nContributors, First Edition\n\nxxiv\n\nThank you to all the instructors who worked in collaboration with the authors and assessment authors to write Biology: How Life Works assessments, activities, and exercises.\n\nAllison Alvarado, University of California, Los Angeles\n\nPeter Armbruster, Georgetown University\n\nZane Barlow- Coleman, formerly of University of Massachusetts, Amherst\n\nJames Bottesch, Brevard Community College\n\nJessamina Blum, Yale University\n\nJere Boudell, Clayton State University\n\nDavid Bos, Purdue University\n\nLaura Ciaccia West, Yale University*\n\nLaura DiCaprio, Ohio University\n\nTod Duncan, University of Colorado, Denver\n\nCindy Giffen, University of Wisconsin, Madison\n\nPaul Greenwood, Colby College\n\nStanley Guffey, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville\n\nAlison Hill, Duke University\n\nMeg Horton, University of North Carolina at Greensboro\n\nKerry Kilburn, Old Dominion University\n\nJo Kurdziel, University of Michigan\n\nDavid Lampe, Duquesne University\n\nBrenda Leady, University of Toledo\n\nSara Marlatt, Yale University*\n\nKelly McLaughlin, Tufts University\n\nBrad Mehrtens, University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign\n\nNancy Morvillo, Florida Southern College\n\nJennifer Nauen, University of Delaware\n\nKavita Oommen, Georgia State University\n\nPatricia Phelps, Austin Community College\n\nMelissa Reedy, University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign\n\nLindsay Rush, Yale University*\n\nSukanya Subramanian, Collin College\n\nMichelle Withers, West Virginia University\n\nReviewers, Class Testers, and Focus Group Participants\n\nThank you to all the instructors who reviewed and/or class tested chapters, art, assessment questions, and other Biology: How Life Works materials.\n\nFirst Edition\n\nThomas Abbott, University of Connecticut\n\nTamarah Adair, Baylor University\n\nSandra Adams, Montclair State University\n\nJonathon Akin, University of Connecticut\n\nEddie Alford, Arizona State University\n\nChris Allen, College of the Mainland\n\nSylvester Allred, Northern Arizona University\n\nShivanthi Anandan, Drexel University\n\nAndrew Andres, University of Nevada, Las Vegas\n\nMichael Angilletta, Arizona State University\n\nJonathan Armbruster, Auburn University\n\nJessica Armenta, Lone Star College System\n\nBrian Ashburner, University of Toledo\n\nAndrea Aspbury, Texas State University\n\nNevin Aspinwall, Saint Louis University\n\nFelicitas Avendano, Grand View University\n\nYael Avissar, Rhode Island College\n\nRicardo Azpiroz, Richland College\n\nJessica Baack, Southwestern Illinois College\n\nCharles Baer, University of Florida\n\nBrian Bagatto, University of Akron\n\nAlan L.
