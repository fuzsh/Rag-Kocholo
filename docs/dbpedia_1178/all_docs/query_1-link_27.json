        "text": "50 Reunion Stories Requested\n\nI’d love to hear from members of the Class who attended Reunion 2015. Please send your stories, and I’ll post them in the next issue of the magazine. While preparing this submission, I encountered an interesting article about Joseph E. Hickey, who passed away on Feb. 3 at the age of 86. As some of you may know, Joe and his family supported the ND football team for several years, creating a home environment for many Fighting Irish players while they attended college. In his autobiography, Joe Theismann ’71 wrote about the positive influence Joe and his wife, Mary, had on his own ND experience, saying, “Notre Dame also gave me Joe and Mary Hickey, who kind of adopted me, a kid away from home, as their own.” Other players provided similar accolades following Joe’s passing. I was also advised that George R. Rhodes of Woodbridge VA died on Jan. 4. Dr. Rhodes was a principal of McKinley High School and retired from DC Public Schools as the assistant superintendent for secondary schools. He also was retired after careers in the US Department of Education and an eight-year position at Howard U. Edward J. Hudak of Fort Meyers FL passed away on Feb. 16 at age 86. Ed played tackle for four undefeated seasons and three national championship teams under Coach Frank Leahy. He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers after his senior year. He later worked as an industrial engineer for the Bethlehem Steel Corp, retiring in 1993. Ed had a lifelong love of football, serving as an assistant coach for Lehigh U for 28 years and the Bethlehem Catholic High School for 17 years. Richard E. Cunningham Jr. of Jaffrey Center NH died on March 1 at age 86. He was an associate professor of English at Keene State from 1967 to 1998. He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Jean Marie (Usher). Henry W. Pletcher II of Poughkeepsie NY died on March 4 at age 87. Bud was a captain in the Army and served as a battalion surgeon for the 41st Armor Infantry Battalion in Mannheim, Germany. After this, he was in private practice as an obstetrician and gynecologist in Poughkeepsie for 45 years. During that time, he was the chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Vassar Brothers Medical Center and was chief of staff at St. Francis Hospital for two years. If members of the Class of ’50 or their family and friends have any updates to share, please contact me at my new address. — Jim Coogan ’91; 6018 Oxpen Ct. Apt. 101, Alexandria VA 22315; jcooganv@alumni.nd.edu\n\n51 No Dry Spell for News\n\nAs most of you know, we may all vanish soon because of lack of water here in northern California. Many of us are getting mighty thirsty. I can guess that most or all are anxious for our first football game. You won’t be reading this piece until the season is winding down. Let us hope it has been a great one. Back on May 3 of this year, our treasurer, Bob Wallace, passed away in Ohio. Bob was an active member of our group for many years. I don’t remember Bob ever missing a Reunion. He was interred in the town he really loved, Tega Cay SC. President Larry Gallagher announced that since our treasurer is now gone, he will take over Bob’s duties until somebody steps forward and volunteers to do the work. This is a good time to announce that Bill Hagan of Roswell GA and Larry are determined to have another Reunion next June; it will be our 65th. I agree completely with them in pursuing this idea. At the moment I do not have any details on their plans. It is a great thought. As Hagan proclaimed, \"Anybody who can crawl should be there.” Give it some thought, and let somebody know. We had a wonderful 60th and we could do it again for 65. I shall keep you posted. Very sad news comes out of Aberdeen WA. Our good friend Tom Brennan passed away on July 4. Some weeks before, Tom told me on the phone that he was having heavy medical problems. His entire family gathered at his bedside, and one of his last acts was receiving Holy Communion, and the family saying the Rosary. It was a touching, wonderful ending. Tom was a regular contributor to our Mass Fund. He told me that one of the highlights of his life was taking his five sons to Ireland, where they visited the village where his father was born and raised. My compliments to Mary and Al Bailey of Ann Arbor for making the trip across the country to attend the funeral service. Thanks to Tom’s brother, Jim ’56, for sending me details covering Tom’s departure. My bio for this issue is to tell you about our classmate, Ted Twardzik of Shenandoah PA, who was an outstanding member of the Notre Dame Glee Club while a student. The highlight of his singing career was his appearance with the Glee Club on the CBS TV Sunday night program Toast of the Town hosted by Ed Sullivan. He appeared three times. Ted departed from the entertainment business in 1952 and started his own company, Mrs. T’s Pierogies. This food is distributed nationally in major grocery stores. Ted’s three sons have been a part of the business. They are Ted Jr. ’79, Tim ’81 and Tom. Ted has often said that besides having a successful food business, his proudest achievement has been the opportunity to produce jobs for folks from his hometown. He has been able to endow dollars to the Hesburgh Library through the years. Last fall, Ted experienced a very bad fall which has hindered his activities. Good luck in recovering, Ted. Last call: I still need a story or two regarding a remembrance of any priest or brother who is buried in Holy Cross. I hope to have our latest book out by Thanksgiving, The History of Holy Cross Cemetery. I’ll talk to y’all real soon. — Jim Gillis; 3267 Rossmoor Pkwy. No.4, Walnut Creek CA 94595; 925-932-6454; jimjanegillis@aol.com\n\n52 Our EEs\n\nOver time, I have tried to follow trends among our classmates in order that I may comment on them in the future. Our electrical engineers had satisfying and rewarding careers working for some of the largest firms in the country. They seemed to hit the market place at a time when televisions were the rage, the space program was getting started and technology in general was moving at a rapid pace. Jim Gruber personifies that group. He worked for Bendix Aviation in South Bend before and after sea duty as a Navy officer aboard some of the larger aircraft carriers. He had challenging positions on each ship as an engineering officer. After three years, he was discharged and returned to Bendix, where by chance a fellow employee arranged for him to meet a nice lady from Toronto, and Bernice Gallagher became his wife. They were the parents of three children. He joined Martin-Marietta and was on the cutting edge in the space program. Tom Gausman joined Sylvania and became involved with their television effort. As transistors evolved, he moved with their group to Batavia NY. With mergers and acquisitions, he became manager of design assurance for North American Philips in Knoxville. He took early retirement and lives in St. Mary’s PA. He and Phyllis had three children, but he lost his wife last year. John Minck had a career with Hewlett-Packard and ended up as their marketing manager from Palo Alto CA, where he retired. His wife Jane was disabled in 1997 following brain surgery, but she has continued with John’s assistance to be a volunteer at the local hospital gift shop. Edward J. Fleming of Longmeadow MA had split time at ND as he left us after two years for service duty and returned to Vetville with a wife and two children to finish with the class of ’54. But he wants to be listed with us. He had an extensive career with Milton Bradley before retiring to do consulting work. Charlie Schubert has made his move to Castle Rock CO work out well for him. From Des Moines, we hear from Lois and Bob Beh. Lois has been dealing with a coloring book that she has been updating for years, selling some 30,000 copies. Her latest is available and you can get your copy by calling 515-244-6684. Dave Will of Oak Park IL did a short tour in the Marines followed by a few years in the FBI before returning to his roots to open a private investigations business that is still in operation. He and Marge have five children. Joe Gibboney was a CSC brother when we were in school. He left and got a master’s at Fordham and a doctorate at Catholic U. Then he began a life of teaching and social work and marriage in Columbus, where they have four children. Don Fager of New Canaan CT had a fine minireunion when John Plouff visited NYC and they were joined by Bob Butler and Jerry Costello for lunch at Tavern on the Green in Central Park. That’s as nice as it gets. Don, next time, please call your class secretary. — Edward F. Foley; 49 Dogwood Dr., Spring Lake Heights NJ 07762; 732-449-0753\n\n53 Losses Mount\n\nThe Chicago Thursday Dinner and Friday Luncheon (Oct. 15 and 16) planning committee awaits your reservations. The response following Tom Reedy’s first letter has been most encouraging. He noted that “time is a-wasting.” Call Eleanor at Reedy Industries, 847-832-2307, today. Ladies are invited to both functions, a historic change. Don’t get left out looking in; your friends want to visit with you. Larry Murray’s email list, as mentioned, was compromised. All changes in addresses over the last 12 months were wiped out. Larry is compiling a list, which he intends to pass out at the luncheon. Please be sure to send him your address if you haven’t been receiving the Broadcasts, which have been more numerous as of late. You can reach Larry at stjudes1@att.net. Gerry Carty has been recognized for his unstinting service as executive secretary of The Moles, a civil engineering professional group, obviously devoted to underground tunneling projects. Gerry has been a long-standing member and served as an officer in various roles. Bill Kean of Chapel Hill is planning a grand tour of the north to include Ft. Wayne, Grand Rapids and South Bend, visiting family and friends. He is also going to Pinehurst and will visit Bob Dwyer, as they have visited in the past. John Mayhall is residing pleasantly in an assisted living facility in Rockford IL. He is planning a home game visit with children. Jack Powers’ grandson, John Lewis, 15, is keeping his grandfather current on ND sports information as his “official ND reader.” Jack has macular degeneration and wishes to maintain his role as information central on ND sports. Thanks, John, from the Class. John Fortino sent a note that he just can’t handle the travel from Tucson for the lunch. He took two required family trips and was too slow to bounce back. He will be missed but promises to keep sending his notes from the West. At our 50th, Deacon Mike McNulty made a most cogent observation about our Class in his homily: “In 1949, we came as many and left in 1953 as one.” Here follows the longest list of the departed I can recall in writing this column. Space limitations prevent elaboration, which is an excellent reason for inclusion on the email list. The Broadcasts include full obituary reports and commentary from classmates. We are sad to report on the passings of: Professor William Lesso, Austin TX; Richard Trosset, New Hartford NY; Dr. Paul Fry, Lake Tahoe CA; Edward Raque, Louisville KY; William Remien, Northfield IL; Donald Carbone, DC; Walter Murphy, DC; William Gaudreau, Baltimore MD; Raymond J. Dittrich, Minneapolis, MN; and David McElvain, Lake Forest IL. Bob Kelly’s wife, Ann, died in Minnetonka MN. Pray for the souls and for the grieving families. Also include in your night prayers our very ill and suffering, of which there are many. — John Mulvihill; 60413 Sumption Trail, South Bend IN 46614; res 574-287-3460; domerhill@aol.com\n\n53JD Class Secretary – Bob Berry;\n\n5806 Spaulding St., Omaha NE 68104; 402-457-4142; Yokeemup@aol.com\n\n54 Planning for the Future\n\nNow is your chance to be heard. We need your help regarding changes you would like Notre Dame to make for seniors. Please consider suggestions such as touring the campus with the aid of a golf cart, parking for football games and other events in more accessible or handicap areas and essentially items to help us better appreciate what Notre Dame has to offer. We also need your help in determining our class officer succession beyond your current class officers. We would like the names, including yours if applicable, and your choice of officer position. Your class officers, including Tom Campbell and Charley Allen, are planning to meet on Sept.18. An email will be sent regarding the above since you will not receive the next magazine until after Oct. 1. Depending on the scope of your comments, we may invite someone from the Alumni Association and Notre Dame administrative staff. We have done this previously with good success. I have another request but this time it tests your memory. I received a phone call from Jim Gillis ’51, whose book, The Cemetery Beneath the Golden Dome, is on sale in the bookstore. It deals with some of the people buried in the cemetery and some of their stories. Now to your memory: Who was the Sneaken Deacon and why? Who was Black Mac and what are some related stories? Who was Father Broesti and in what hall was he the rector? Please feel free to send me additional stories, not just of the clergy, but professors as well who stand out in your memory. Here is other info: Dick Her has played 773 different golf courses. Pat and Larry Gotuaco attended our 60th reunion and it was their first. He took some great pictures that can be found on our class website. Larry LeBlanc wrote a remarkable book on his life story, Beside Myself, about his voyage from Ecorse MI to Notre Dame. Ron Mazzoli cut our hair for four years, charging 25 cents, and at graduation he reached into his pocket and gave his father an envelope with a check as a thank you. Tom Campbell will have tailgate gatherings for all home games. Prior to the Georgia Tech game, it will be a minireunion location. The Navy game will be our class group seating game. His location is opposite the south entrance. Look for flags of Notre Dame, Indiana, Class of ’54 and the Marines. The handicap parking area is close by. As in past years, Tom will have soft drinks, beer and food. Our treasury will pick up the cost. My prediction: Our football record will be 4-0 by the time you receive this magazine. The following attended our 61st reunion: Donna and Joe Joyce, Alice and Gene Henry, Mary Ann and Tom Campbell, Natalie and Phil Doell, Jule and John Poirier, Tom Calder, Dick Pilger, Gerrie and Joe Mesic, Loretta Guilfoile, Brenda Finney, Betty and Bob Urbanski, Lou Bernardi, Jack Mooney and Sherry, Tom Field, Walt Duschka, and Charlie Allen. Mass was celebrated by Rev. Paul Doyle, CSC, ’65 with a reception and dinner at Legends. Marie Beaudine told Jack Mertens recently that Milt appreciates receiving cards and notes from us. Please send to 14 Bowsprit Lane, Salem SC 29676. Obituaries: Richard DeShriver, Romer Clement and Bernard “Bunky” Connor. Additional details can be found on our class web site. — George Koch; 4758 Curtis Lane, Clarkston MI 48346; 248-623-0973\n\n54JD Surprise\n\nI got a surprise letter after at least 10 years from Jim Bleyer, who is still in Marion IL. He has two sons, one named Knute Rockne Bleyer. I sent him some info, then faxed him Don Ward’s letter and faxed Don the Bleyer letter and my reply. Of course there was no reply to any of this and my work. They should turn on their faxes machines. Jim still is practicing, as I am, after 61 years. Jim’s wife passed away last year, and he has a broken leg and back. I haven’t heard from Don Ward since November. Jim says he appreciates my keeping alive the flame with our class and he treasures all of our friendship. I hope they read this and reply. I have some problems myself. I count eight. I was told a month ago that I lost half my blood some way. After 18 procedures in 22 days, I am still looking at several transfusions. I need the blood for risky open heart valve surgery we are planning if I can do it in next 60 days, so I may not be here for any messages. Please send them anyway. — Carl Eiberger; 14330 Fairview Lane, Golden CO 80401; 303-278-0707; carleiberger@comcast.net\n\n55 Brother Donald Project\n\nTom Schreitmueller has begun fundraising to support the Holy Cross Bangladesh Missions in honor of our classmate, Brother Donald Becker, CSC, who lived a humble life serving the poorest of the poor there for 56 years. The money will help construct a student hostel for technical school students and help subsidize low-income students. For further details, contact Tom at tschreit@mi.rr.com, or 28726 Hidden Trail, Farmington Hills MI 48331. As the first class to benefit from four years of inspiration provided in extraordinary measures by Father Ted Hesburgh, the class has established a Father Ted Hesburgh Scholarship that will be awarded annually to a descendant of our class most in need of financial support. Triple Domer John Haddox recently retired at 85 after 58 years of teaching philosophy at the U of Texas in El Paso. Haddox published four books, along with 17 chapters in books and 35 articles and reviews. He also presented 70 papers at conferences in 16 states and five nations. Lois and Ron Davis celebrated their 50th on July 25. Father Jim Blantz had a ball performing again at the Magic Castle in Hollywood.

Leo Callaghan is very proud of his son’s accomplishments. Father Michael Callaghan ’13MBA celebrated his 25th anniversary as a priest, and works in Brooklyn. Jack Battel became sick while visiting his son after Reunion, but thanks to long-distance counseling from MD daughter Cindy, Jack got his blood level back up for the flight home. While on a West Coast trip, Emmet Root enjoyed a golfer’s dream, playing Pebble Beach, Cypress Point and Olympic the same week. Emmet added, “It doesn’t get any better for an old guy.” Max Roesler hosted a big crowd for the famous Fourth of July fireworks on “his” Sylvan Lake.

One thing was certain: that person was old. Well, wake up, this year most of us will celebrate our 80th birthday. The rest of us already have. If you attended the minireunion on Sept. 19, the Class gave you a birthday present in the form of complimentary drinks. Sadly, several classmates have passed away since our last column. On May 19 Terence Kevin Kilbride passed away. He was survived by his wife, Nancy, five children and 11 grandchildren. Terry worked for Ford Motor Company for 35 years. Emmett Francis “Bud” Malloy Jr. died in July. Bud carried dual citizenship: US and Ireland, of which he was most proud. He was survived by his wife, Mary Claire, and four children, all of whom are ND grads and two of whom were married to ND grads. Robert Henry Dunseath died June 7 in Rochester MN. He was survived by wife Joyce and three children. Bob was one of many classmates who attended Cathedral High School in Indianapolis. Bill McGowan, a high school classmate, sent us this news. Remember in your prayers, in addition to our deceased classmates, John Herrington’s wife, Carol, who died on June 15 after a long-term illness. She was survived by her husband of 54 years and six children. Also, Sharon Theese, wife of Bill Theese, died on June 12. Joe Santos, who is married to Bill’s sister, sent us this news. As with all classmates and their spouses, a Mass is offered on campus for them. Steve Penny, who has undergone a series of five operations, some planned and some unplanned, wrote, “When I read the obits, I realize there were many young men of talent, courage, persuasion, energy and commitment that were being honed and nurtured under the Golden Dome. It seems they all made ripples in the pond of life; some very large, some smaller, but all significant. I think all of our classmates have made and continue to make significant contributions within the circles of and context of their lives.” Prayers are requested for Markie McKaig, spouse of Brad McKaig, who passed away after a courageous battle with heart problems. Theodore “Ted” Novakowski passed away July 27. He was survived by his wife, Dorothy, and four children. Don Haney pointed out that there was a nice article on Frank Reilly in the Mendoza College of Business’ magazine. Frank joined the ND faculty in 1981 as dean of the College of Business and served as dean until June of 1987 and has continued on the ND faculty to this day as professor of finance. He is an expert in markets credit analysis and security market indexes. (I wish I had him directing my portfolio). Congrats, Frank. In June, I was named a “Pillar of the Bar,” a prestigious honor awarded by the Peoria Bar Association every five years. (Mary told me I had to include this).

He is survived by his wife, Marlene, three children and 10 grandchildren. Mike began a career in advertising at the Chicago Tribune that lasted 40 years, spent in Chicago, Hammond IN and Jacksonville FL. Mike wore his Irish heritage proudly, loving Irish music, Irish writers, his Irish wolfhounds and, of course, the Fighting Irish of ND. His travels ranged from China to Europe and included County Kerry in Ireland, the birthplace of his parents. Mike served as Democratic precinct captain in Chicago’s 47th Ward, a member of the parish council of at Immaculate Conception in Chicago and president of the ND Club of the North Florida. The Alumni Association has received news that Joseph Bumbleburg of Lafayette IN has been reappointed to his 17th term as judge advocate of the Indiana district of the American Legion. As the final note for this issue, we include the announcement from Pat Doherty that the date of the spring reunion luncheon of the Class of ’58 in Naples FL has been changed to Tuesday, March 8, 2016, the second Tuesday of the month. The location is the same: Sydney’s Pub at the Tiburon Golf Club in Naples. The change was made because the customary first Tuesday of the month will fall on March 1, the check-in day for many Florida visitors. Quoting Pat, “Sydney’s Pub at Tiburon Golf Club is a perfect setting, with excellent buffet, but the main attraction is you guys from ND’s great Class of 1958, with camaraderie, sharing old yarns and funny stuff with a roving mike.” Jim Indiveri (jindiveri@aol.com or 239-775-1930) will track attendance. Other committee members are Bill Rees, Jerry Dahle, Roy Williams, Bill Geary, John Higgins and Pat Doherty. — Arthur L. Roule Jr.; 3725 W.

Over the years, I have received numerous inputs on how important it is to stay active spiritually, physically and mentally. I have tried to include some examples in each column. Steve Dombach and John Roy, along with other ND senior grads, have been volunteering at a men’s shelter (Higher Ground/Catholic Charities) in Minneapolis. They serve the evening meal twice a month. Tofie Owen is staying active in the DC/VA area by serving on the parish faith formation committee, Good Shepherd and Family Services National Guard Youth Foundation and Air Force Museum at Robins AFB. Father Jim Connelly, CSC, completed a six-year term as religious superior of Holy Cross House, a long-term care facility for Holy Cross priests and brothers at Notre Dame. He is now residing in Corby Hall, researching and writing a history of the Congregation of Holy Cross. Jim Cooney has put his ranch in Albuquerque up for sale and is moving to South Bend. The ranch was the site for 16 consecutive ND freshman sendoffs. Joe Higgins is officially retired. He sold his welding supply company, Abbot Welding in Olean NY, to Airgas. He interacted over the years with another classmate in the same industry, the late Jim Colosimo. Bob Giarratano has moved back to San Diego from Oregon. A group from the class, Ellie and Rich Amaral, Father Paul (Terry) Lamb and Fritz Jelinik represented us on a harbor cruise sponsored by the ND Club of Cape Cod. Ed Ricciuti’s latest book, Bears in the Backyard, came out in paperback in September. Ed gave a talk Sept. 3 at the NYC Public Library. Rich (Quince) Komyatte has a unique family network at ND this year. They have three grandchildren as students. In addition, Kristin Komyatte Sheehan ’90 is a co-director of “Play Like a Champion Today,” a program that is part of ACE. Our thanks to Sylvia and Rich for establishing a challenge grant for ACE, which was met by a number in our class. Ed Sullivan has retired from the practice of law in San Francisco. Here are a few highlights from Reunion. Joining Father Jim Connelly for their 50th anniversary Mass in the Basilica on May 22 were three other classmates: Father Jim Ferguson (in residence at Fatima House at ND), Father Bill Blum (chaplain for the Holy Cross Brothers at Columba Hall and for residents at Holy Cross Village) and Father Dick Rutherford (teacher at U of Portland). Thanks to Ed Mertz of Scottsdale AZ for donating his ND photography collection to the ND archives and to Joann and Jim Masterson for helping the ACE teaching fellows in Peoria IL. Tommy Hawkins returned to the campus in June to deliver the keynote address during the Play Like a Champion 10th annual conference for those involved with youth sports in parishes and dioceses. I am sorry to report the following deaths: Steve Harvath on June 7 in Farmington Hills MI; Tim Rapp (son of Dan) on June 22 in North Carolina; Jan Amidon (wife of Dave) on June 24 in Granby CT; Charlie (Chuck) Hummer on June 25 in Enfield, NH; John Philbin on August 11 in Mundelein IL.
