Here are a few questions I’ve been exploring:\n\nHow do we evaluate the causal effects of interventions from biased data? How do we draw robust counterfactual claims in the presence of distribution shifts?\n\nHow can robust off-policy learning methods be developed to evaluate candidate policies from biased data? How can we extrapolate informative knowledge from offline data to accelerate a future online learning process?\n\nHow can ethical concepts such as fairness and discrimination be incorporated into AI decision systems?

We’re really interested in understanding the “rules of life” for how tissues form, so we can use that knowledge to improve the biomimicry of our engineered tissue models to understand the biology of development and disease.\n\nHow we do it: We do this by first mining existing datasets and using advanced imaging tools to further our understanding of homeostatic or pathological characteristics of tissue-specific microenvironments. We then take that knowledge, decide what parameter(s) we want to investigate, and engineer inquiry-specific microenvironments using synthetic hydrogels. Some projects focus on how altered initial conditions (e.g., matrix stiffness or viscoelasticity, integrin binding, extracellular matrix composition, and cell composition) impact morphogenesis. Other projects focus on the role of spatiotemporal dynamics of the extracellular microenvironment in shaping growing tissues. For this work, we use light-tunable materials to alter the properties of our synthetic microenvironments, in order to guide morphogenesis.\n\nHonors and Awards:\n\nNIDDK K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award (NIH)\n\nAmerican Institute of Chemists Postdoctoral Award (University of Colorado Boulder)\n\nYoung Investigator’s Day Paul Talalay Award (Johns Hopkins University)\n\nNHBLI F31 NRSA Individual Predoctoral Fellowship (NIH)\n\nPredoctoral Fellowship (American Heart Association)\n\nSelected Publications:\n\nBlatchley MR, Anseth KS.

While the generations of immune responses are complicated processes that involves wide range of molecular and cellular interactions, many key aspects crucial for protective immune responses have been recently revealed, generating enormous opportunities for therapeutic interventions to greatly improve patient health. Various immune engineering strategies based on biomaterial platforms have shown promise in facilitating immunogenic materials trafficking, modulating cellular interactions, and more. My previous work has also demonstrated several approaches to engineer coordinated cellular and humoral immune responses for augmenting therapeutic responses. The research of our team at Syracuse is aimed at designing biomaterials strategies to delivering molecular stimuli in a temporal and spatial fashion for regulating immune functions. We are particularly interested in harnessing humoral immune responses for therapeutic purpose by regulating the cellular process involved.\n\nHonors and Awards:\n\nDuke Incubation Fund (Co-PI) 2019\n\nAmerican Chemical Society Excellence in Graduate Polymer Research Award 2014\n\nSelected Publications:\n\n• Wu Y, Wen H, Bernstein Z, Blakney T, Congdon K, Sampson JH, Sanchez-Perez L, Collier JH, Multi-epitope supramolecular peptide nanofibers eliciting coordinated humoral and cellular antitumor immune responses, Science Advances, 2022 8, eabm7833\n\n• Wu Y, Kelly SH, Sanchez-Perez L, Sampson JH, Collier JH, Comparative study of α-helical and β-sheet self-assembled peptide nanofiber vaccine platforms: Influence of integrated T-cell epitopes, Biomaterial Science, 2020, 8, 3522\n\n• Fries CN, Wu Y, Kelly SH, Wolf M, Votaw NL, Zauscher S, Collier JH, Controlled lengthwise assembly of helical peptide nanofibers to modulate CD8+ T cell responses, Advanced Materials, 2020, 32, 2003310\n\n• Kelly SH, Wu Y, Varadhan AK, Curvino EJ, Chong AS, Collier JH, Enabling Sublingual Peptide Immunization Using Molecular Self-assemblies, Biomaterials, 2020, 241, 119903\n\n• Nelson CE, Wu Y, Gemberling MP, Oliver ML, Waller MA, Bohning JD, Robinson-Hamm JN, Bulaklak K, Castellanos Rivera RM, Collier JH, Asokan A, Gersbach CA, Long-term Evaluation of AAV-CRISPR Genome Editing for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Nature Medicine, 2019, 25, 427\n\n• Wu Y, Norberg PK, Reap EA, Congdon K, Fries C, Kelly SH, Sampson JH, Conticello VP, Collier JH, A supramolecular vaccine platform based on α-helical peptide nanofibers, ACS Biomaterials Science & Engineering, 2017, 3(12), 3128\n\n• Wu Y, Smith AE, Reineke TM, Lipophilic polycation vehicles display high plasmid DNA delivery to multiple cell types, Bioconjugate Chemistry, 2017, 28, 2035\n\nYi Zheng\n\nLab/ Center/ Institute affiliations:\n\nBioInspired Institute\n\nAreas of Expertise:\n\nStem cell-based human developmental models\n\nMicroengineered organ/disease models (organoids)\n\nSingle cell genomics\n\nMicrofluidics\n\nMechanobiology\n\nEmbryonic development involves extensive lineage diversification, cell fate specification, tissue patterning and morphogenesis. Identification of the features that enable robust interpretation of developmental signaling using in vivo samples is a significant challenge. Recent studies of self-assembly processes of organ-like structures (organoids) from pluripotent stem cells in vitro have provided fresh insights into fundamental mechanisms underlying embryonic development. These stem cell-based in vitro models offer unparalleled opportunities for experimental control of key parameters, quantitative measurements, and mathematical modeling.\n\nMy lab sought to leverage sophisticated engineering approaches to achieve controllable in vitro platforms that could recapitulate sequential developmental events during human embryo development. These stem cell-based models will provide powerful experimental platforms to advance understanding of poorly understood embryonic disorders. With superior controllability and scalability, these platforms will also serve as effective tools for high-throughput drug and toxicity screening to facilitate diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of teratogenesis and birth defects.\n\nHonors and Awards:\n\nRobert M.

At a low energetic cost these materials can bend, fold, crease, pop or snap, exhibiting a variety of large (sometimes singular) and fast deformations. Their response emerge from an intricate coupling between geometry and material (surface and bulk) properties. Combining experimental, theoretical and numerical tools I study how soft materials behave when they are adhered to other substrates, wetted by liquid drops, or exposed to a flow. Leveraging this fundamental knowledge, my research lab aims to advance the development of flexible and wearable electronics, sensors and actuators for smart materials and functional surfaces.\n\nHonors and Awards:\n\nOutstanding faculty award – Sigma Gamma Tau (2024).\n\nActive learning initiative fellowship at Cornell University (2021).\n\nInternational Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ICTAM) Travel Award (2016).\n\nSelected Publications:\n\nJ.

These results indicate a need to fully incorporate an understanding of turbulence into our understanding of eagle movements, with implications for other natural and artificial fliers. In the Laurent Fluid Dynamics Lab, her research aims to find engineering solutions to challenges in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by exploring both biological flight and swimming.\n\nSelected Publications:\n\nLaurent, K.

Beijing Agr. Eng. University; 1982 and 1985\n\nLab/Center Affiliations\n\nBuilding Energy and Environmental Systems Laboratory\n\nEQS-STAR Center of Environmental Systems\n\nSyracuse Center of Excellence in Energy and Environmental Systems\n\nAreas of Expertise:\n\nMaterial Emissions, Air Purification, Ventilation, and Indoor Air Quality\n\nHygrothermal Performance of Building Materials and Enclosure Systems\n\nBuilding Energy and Environmental Systems\n\nBuilt Environmental Systems Measurements, Modeling, and Controls\n\nIntelligent Buildings\n\nCombined Heat, Air, Moisture and Pollutant Simulations (CHAMPS)\n\nMulti-disciplinary and Multi-scale Building Systems Design and Optimization\n\nEffects of indoor environmental quality on occupant exposure, productivity, and creativity\n\nProfessor Zhang’s research ranges multi-scale BES from nano/micro-scale in porous media to buildings and urban environment and involves engineering, architectural design, human health, and performance. Major ongoing research projects are:\n\nVirtual Design Studio (VDS): development of a digital platform for an integrated and coordinated design of green buildings. The project involves close collaboration between engineers and architects to develop a designer-oriented software tool for performance-based building system design.\n\nBM-IDC: Building monitoring and intelligent diagnosis and control. Using a full-scale testbed, a “Virtual Building” based near real-time monitoring system is developed and deployed to collect essential data for fault detection and diagnosis, and improvement of building operation.\n\nCHAMPS: Development of combined heat, air moisture, and pollutant simulation software for building system design and control optimization. The CHAMPS simulation environment includes a whole building model, an enclosure model, an HVAC mode and a room model. It is supported by a collection of shared databases of weather, materials and assemblies, pollutants, sources, and sinks. Reduced-order models will be developed for near-real-time simulation in design and predictive control in the operation of buildings.\n\nME-IAQ: Material emissions and indoor air quality. A model-based approach is taken to develop fundamental mass transfer models with essential model parameters determined from experiments. The research leads to better models for performance prediction and better test methods for evaluating both short and long-term emissions.\n\nACT-IAQ: Air cleaning technologies and indoor air quality. A model-based approach is taken to develop better test methods, evaluate the performance of existing air cleaning technologies, and develop new ones for improving indoor air quality.\n\nBEST: Building enclosure system technologies. This research includes experimental measurements and modeling of the hygrothermal (thermal and moisture) storage and transport properties of various building materials, model prediction of their impact on enclosure assembly performance, and full-scale evaluation and validation at reduced and full-scale setting under both laboratory and field conditions.\n\nEffects of IEQ on human performance. Human subject study is performed using a total environmental quality research facility. The focus is on how the improved thermal and air quality via personal ventilation would impact the performance of creativity and productivity of building occupants.\n\nHonors and Awards:\n\n2019 ASHRAE Research Administration Committee Service in ASHRAE Research Award\n\n2018 ASHRAE Central New York Chapter Award for Contributions to Research and Education in HVAC and IAQ.\n\nElected Fellow of ASHRAE, 2012\n\nFrontier Foreign Expert Award, State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs, the P.R.
