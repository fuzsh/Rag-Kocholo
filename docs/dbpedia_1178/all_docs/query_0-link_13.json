        "text": "Plant Biology at NC State can trace its roots to the University’s founding and originally included Microbiology. Research in plant biology began in 1888 with the appointment of botanist Michael Gerald McCarthy at the North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station. When the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, the forerunner of NC State University, opened its doors in 1889, Wilbur Fiske Massey was one of the five founding faculty members. Massey laid the initial foundation for academic instruction in botany and horticulture at the college, which included courses in anatomy, physiology, classification, plant pathology, and other subjects. In 1896, Primrose Hall, the third academic building built on campus, was devoted exclusively to the laboratory and greenhouse work led by Dr. Massey.\n\nResearch in the early years emphasized basic plant pathology. Later, important work was done in plant community ecology and plant physiology. Over the last 75 years, most aspects of modern botany have been pursued, including systematic research in the various fields. Academic instruction at first focused on providing a foundation in basic botany for undergraduate students in applied areas of plant science and technology. Graduate level instruction quickly followed, with the first M.S. in Botany being awarded in 1910 and the first Ph.D. in 1936. Since the 1940’s, an undergraduate degree in Botany (now called Plant Biology) has been available."
