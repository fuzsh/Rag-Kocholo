Brown Professor of Economics at the University of Arizona, a Fellow of the TIAA-CREF Institute, and a Research Associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research. He and co-author Shawn Kantor were awarded a Paul Samuelson Certificate of Excellence by the TIAA-CREF Institute for their book A Prelude to the Welfare State: The Origins of Workers’ Compensation (2000). They also received the Lester Prize for Outstanding Book in Labor Economics and Industrial Relations by the Industrial Relation Sections at Princeton University.

Price is a Fellow of the Cliometrics Society and was one of the organizers of the Cliometrics Conference between 1996 and 2008.
