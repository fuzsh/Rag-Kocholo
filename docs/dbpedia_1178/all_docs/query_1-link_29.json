        "text": "Last week, in response to Pam’s comment that she needed a break from sad and serious books, I undertook a hunt for a comic novel to read and review. I’ve read quite a few though the most recent laugh-out-loud Australian one was a while ago in May last year when I read Naked Ambition (2023) by Robert Gott. It’s about a politician who commissions a full length portrait of himself in his birthday suit, and the artist wants to enter it in the Archibald Portrait Prize.\n\nIt turned out to be surprisingly difficult to find something to fit the bill. I checked bookstore websites, and Goodreads lists, and Wikipedia, but there seemed to be very little available. Publishing is going through a morbid phase…\n\nEventually I came across a parody of a recently published royal memoir. It rejoices in the title Spare Us! A Harrody… This is the book description:\n\n‘All I had ever wanted was privacy. In order to get it, it seemed that an exceptionally detailed 500,000-word book was in order…’\n\nHe was born into an ancient powerful dynasty and, through no fault of his own, became one of the most recognisable men on the planet.\n\nHis life was a constant barrage of press intrusion and manipulation. Until finally, he demanded that it stop. In order to get the privacy he so craved, he has written a warts-and-all book that goes deep inside the castle walls and exposes every shouting match, fist-fight, betrayal, teddy bear, awkward hug and tear-stained wedding rehearsal for the world to feast their eyes on. All for privacy!\n\nThis is his story.\n\nAlas, the title and the book description seem to have exhausted the author’s capacity for humour. I’m sorry, Pam, Spare Us! is spectacularly unfunny with pitifully weak one-liners that fall flat in chapter after chapter.\n\nChapter 47\n\nShe was even more ravishing in person than she had seemed from her pictures. I couldn’t believe my eyes.\n\nWhat was best about her was that she couldn’t care twopence that I was a royal. It was perfect.\n\n‘I hear that you are in the hit US TV drama Suits, I said.\n\n‘It’s a seemingly never-ending soap opera about tiresome, privileged people bitching, manipulating and betraying each other for power,’ she replied.\n\n‘Let’s not talk about my family,’ I said. ‘Tell me about Suits.’ (p.75)\n\n*Yawn*\n\nTo be fair, maybe I was missing something because I haven’t read anything about the royals since I was about twelve. My mother had a small collection of Pitkin Pictorials commemorating various royal events. I remember reading the one that commemorated Princess Margaret’s ill fated marriage: I had a mild interest in fashion at that age and enjoyed the contrast between the elegant simplicity of Princess Margaret’s dress and the fussiness of her sister’s. I have favoured simple unfussy clothes ever since so I therefore can’t say that I escaped royal influence altogether. In time I emulated that simplicity (at considerably less expense) for my own wedding dress… though I haven’t worn a dress since then.\n\nBut I did not watch That Funeral or the other ones, or any of Those Weddings, or the Coronation. The birth of more royal parasites has passed me by. All I know about The Spare is that his mother died in a car crash when he was a little boy, that he went to the usual British public schools, that he wore a Nazi uniform to a party, was in the army for a while, and that he married an American. I most certainly did not read the memoir which the author is trying to spoof in Spare Us!\n\nWould it have amused me if I had read the original? I doubt it.\n\nBruno Vincent is the author of the Enid Blyton for Grown-ups Series, and now I suspect that the titles are possibly also the funniest elements in those books too:\n\nFive Give Up the Booze\n\nFive Go Absolutely Nowhere\n\nFive Get Beach Body Ready\n\nOver to you, dear readers… what comic novels can you recommend for Pam?\n\nAuthor: Bruno Vincent\n\nTitle: Spare Us! A Harrody\n\nPublisher: Abacus Books, UK, 2023\n\nISBN: 9780349146065, hbk., 101 pages\n\nSource: Bayside Library\n\nI’ve lost track of how many times I’ve watched the period drama BBC TV series Foyle’s War. I have the complete series on DVD, and I’m currently watching it again because I can’t read much at night after some bothersome eye treatment.\n\nFor those who haven’t seen it, Wikipedia tells us that…\n\nFoyle’s War is a British detective drama television series set during and shortly after the Second World War, created by Midsomer Murders screenwriter and author Anthony Horowitz and commissioned by ITV after the long-running series Inspector Morse ended in 2000. It began broadcasting on ITV in October 2002. ITV director of programmes Simon Shaps cancelled Foyle’s War in 2007, but Peter Fincham (Shaps’ replacement) revived the programme after good ratings for 2008’s fifth series. The final episode was broadcast on 18 January 2015, after eight series.\n\n[…]\n\nThe series is also notable for its attention to historical detail, and the drama is frequently moved along by historical events of the Second World War. Horowitz considered that to honour the veterans of the war it was important to get the details correct\n\nMy father, who hardly ever watched TV, really enjoyed Foyle’s War, and if I’d known of its existence back in the day, I would have bought him a copy of Rod Green’s TV tie-in The Real History Behind Foyle’s War (2006). With a Foreword by the screenwriter Anthony Horowitz, it’s a terrific book, meticulously researched to show just how realistic the series is.\n\nWhile the commonly-held perception of our nation at war is that of the people standing shoulder-to-shoulder in the face of adversity, the activities of those who lurked in the shadows of the blackout touched the lives of almost everyone. (p.12)\n\nThe police had a massive role to play in WW2. With an acute manpower shortage due to enlistments even though it was a reserved occupation, hastily trained young recruits and officers brought out of retirement had to deal with a huge workload. Beside all the usual criminal activities, there was widespread looting, racketeering and black marketing. Scams and organised gangs operated just as in the series, targeting victims when they were at their most vulnerable, and because of the greater availability of guns, there was a 22% increase in the murder rate, while the overall crime rate rose by 57%. There was more violent crime too: Army-issue revolvers bought from Canadian soldiers were known to cost as little as £7 but more sophisticated weaponry could be purloined if you knew where to find it.\n\nSometimes weapons were stolen from poorly secured Home Guard stores:\n\n[There was a case of] four teenagers who, armed with sten sub-machine guns and a rifle acquired from a Home Guard Store, robbed the Ambassador cinema in Hayes. Two youths, escaping from a remand home, went on the run with a Tommy gun and 400 rounds of ammunition they stole from a Home Guard depot at Upper Norwood. (p.51)\n\nAnd yes, in real life, British police officers patrolled unarmed, and they mostly still don’t carry guns. (They were unarmed here in Australia until the 1970s and they weren’t routinely openly armed until the mid 1980s.)\n\nThe episode that shows Foyle tracking down the theft of fuel in commercial quantities is authentic, as is the episode that shows farmers hiding their livestock from the authorities. So is the episode involving sheep infected by germ warfare testing on Gruinard Island.\n\nHastings, which really was on the front line and at risk from German invasion, suffered 85 enemy air-raids.\n\nThe Luftwaffe dropped over 750 incendiaries as well as 550 high explosive bombs, and 15 VI flying bombs fell on the area. More than 700 people were injured and 154 killed. The death of Sam’s friend when their lodgings are bombed in the episode ‘Fifty Ships’ or the destruction of the local pub and the death of a barmaid in ‘The German Woman’ sadly reflect actual events. In Hastings almost 450 houses were demolished either by direct hits or because bomb damage had left them too dangerously unstable to be allowed to remain standing. Almost half the inhabitants were evacuated from the town, the pre-war population of 65,000 dropping to just 34,000 during hostilities. The evacuations were not only to keep people safe from the bombing but were deemed necessary because Hastings was expected to become one of the focal points of the imminent German invasion. (p.8)\n\nIt was fascinating to read about the German spies who actually did land on the beach and make their way inland, only to be captured. It seems they really were as badly-prepared and poorly briefed as the spy in the episode ‘Fifty Ships’.\n\nReal spies made the same sort of error, blundering into military patrols near the coast while wearing wet clothing, asking for directions in an accent that aroused suspicion, or, in the case of Carl Meier, walking into a pub in Lydd one morning after landing at Dungeness (not far from Hastings) and asking the landlady for a pint of cider outside of normal licensing hours. (p12)\n\nPostwar research with German documentation shows that all 115 German spies were detected and either ‘turned’ to the British cause or were sent to the gallows.\n\nThis book offers a surprising insight into law and order on the Home Front. It comprises\n\nIntroduction,\n\nThe Role of the Police in Wartime\n\nCrime and Punishment\n\nFoyle, Milner, Sam and Andrew, and\n\nTruth and Fiction.\n\nA couple of copies were available at AbeBooks on the day I looked.\n\nRod Green is a prolific author and you can find out more about him at his website.\n\nAuthor: Rod Green\n\nTitle: The Real History Behind Foyle’s War\n\nPublisher: ABC Books / Carlton Books 2006\n\nDesign: Vicky Holmes and Anna Pow\n\nISBN: 9780733319099, hbk., 144 pages, full colour photos from the TV series and historical images.\n\nSource: The Spouse, an OpShopFind.\n\nIt is a measure of how powerful the writing is in Cameron Stewart’s debut novel Why Do Horses Run? that I have mixed feelings about it.\n\nThis is the book description from Goodreads:\n\nHe walked not feeling he was connected to the earth, but on the edge of something he couldn’t reach. He pushed on through mist and darkness and clutched the blanket tight under his neck with his bony fist. Nothing in the darkness could scare him. He was darkness itself.\n\nMissing in every sense of the word, a man walks into the landscape and doesn’t stop. In all weather and across all kinds of terrain, Ingvar walks until he can go no further, then gets up and does it again the following day, week after week, month after month. For three years he doesn’t know why he keeps going, or whether he is walking towards something or away from it.\n\nUntil he comes to a remote tropical valley harbouring secrets and misfits. There a recently widowed woman, Hilda, allows Ingvar to live in a shed on her property. He hasn’t spoken for three years and Hilda chats frequently with her dead husband, but somehow they tolerate each other as they both struggle with the haunting impact of their pasts and grief that won’t let them go.\n\nAs it says on his website, Cameron Stewart is interested in flawed characters trying to do their best. His flawed character in Why Do Horses Run? is Ingvar — who walks out of his own life and tramps like a modern-day swaggie for three years in the solitude of the Australian bush, rendered in exquisite detail by an author who knows it intimately.\n\nIngvar sleeps rough, and he speaks to no one, but carries a notepad to briefly communicate his needs when necessary. Refusing all engagement with other people, he keeps a journal which gradually reveals his pain and guilt to the reader, and his daughter Lotte ‘speaks to him’ from the afterlife.\n\nIngvar’s wanderings halt when he encounters the widow Hilda, who is not yet ready to cast off the remnants of the life she had with a philandering husband, and there are intimations that some kind of healing could begin. He encounters both kindness and cruelty in the local community, but he’s not ready for friendship and he rejects any kind of solace.\n\nMayor, a wise old Bunjalung man, finds Ingvar drunk down at the river, and tries to give Ingvar a sense of perspective. He knows that the books can’t ever be balanced, and he recognises the self-inflicted harm:\n\n‘Youve done a number on yourself, young fella. Driven yourself into a ditch. Come over to my place. I’ll get some food into you.’ (p.217)\n\nBut Ingvar blunders off into the bush with his tequila. He has to get away from humans and their words.\n\nNo reader could be indifferent to this man’s profound grief as he punishes himself for what he has done. And yet…\n\n… I kept thinking of the character who is offstage and has no voice for the entire novel: Lotte’s mother Isobel who has lost both her daughter and her husband. She is doubly bereaved. When a local copper joins the dots on the Missing Person’s Register and suggests to Ingvar that he could at least let his wife know, Ingvar refuses.\n\nYou know those stories that surface in the media from time to time? Single mothers bearing the burden of multiple births or profoundly disabled children or some catastrophic event like the loss of everything in a natural disaster, alone because their husbands couldn’t cope? Though there were two of them doing the parenting, the husband can’t cope, so he shoots through. Leaving one parent to carry the burden that is too heavy for two — alone. In the copper’s gentle suggestion that Ingvar be registered as ‘found’, Stewart’s novel gives us a glimpse of those left behind. A woman suffering the torment of not knowing where Ingvar is or even if he is alive.\n\nWhy Do Horses Run? shows us a man in despair, and as Chris Gordon writes in her review it at Readings, it’s a novel that reminds us not to judge. But there are two people in this tragedy and one of them has been abandoned.\n\nGrief is different for everyone, and people deal with it in different ways. But in the quest for absolution, Ingvar has left wreckage behind him. This novel raises some profound questions for book groups to mull over.\n\nJennifer at Tasmanian Bibliophile at Large reviewed it too.\n\nAuthor: Cameron Stewart\n\nTitle: Why Do Horses Run?\n\nPublisher: Allen & Unwin, 2024\n\nISBN: 9781761069659, pbk., 314 pages\n\nSource: review copy courtesy of Allen & Unwin, via the author\n\nDuring the month of April, Stu from Winston’s Dad was featured as a guest curator at GLLI (Global Literature in Libraries), and amongst other books that he featured was this one, Stone in a Landslide by Catalan author Maria Barbal, translated by Laura McGloughlin and Paul Mitchell. First published in 1985, it wasn’t published in English until 2010 by Peirene Press, and was, after Beside the Sea (2001) by Veronique Olmi, (translated by Adriana Hunter) second in their translations series featuring ‘the female voice’.\n\nBut it is also listed at Goodreads first in the series Cicle del Pallars #1, and with the help of Google Translate, I have learned that the cycle is completed by three more books, as yet untranslated…\n\nPedra de Tartera (Stone in a Landslide)\n\nMel i metzines (1990, Honey and Honeydew);\n\nCàmfora (1992, Camphor) and\n\nPaís íntim (2005, Intimate Country).\n\nThey are all set in Maria Barbal’s native Pallars, linked by the life maturation process of their characters. The tetralogy is described as written in a precise, sober prose, stripped of any narrative artifice.\n\nBarbal’s achievement in Stone in a Landslide is to render an illiterate peasant woman’s narrative convincing. Conxa has had only a rudimentary education, three winters, and she was lucky to get it because unless you had older sisters to do all the work at home, you didn’t go to school if you were a girl. But since her lessons were all delivered in Spanish, not her native Catalan, she didn’t understand most of it and soon forgot it all.\n\nAs she tells us later in her narrative, in her world it is women who do most of the work. It is her duty to her family to accept the decisions of others and not to complain. Reading between the lines, we see how Barbal shows us where women and girls are in the social order. When Conxa was uprooted from all that was familiar and sent to live (and work) with her childless aunt and uncle — while his wife does the farm work at home — her uncle who comes to collect her, rides a donkey, while Conxa walks all the way in her sister’s shoes that don’t fit.\n\nAnyone could see that there were a lot of us at home. Someone had to go. I was the fifth of six children – Mother used to say I was there because God had wanted me to be there and you have to take what He sends you. The eldest was Maria, who, more than Mother, ran the house. Josep was the son and heir and Joan was going into the church. We three youngest were told a hundred times that we were more of a burden than a blessing. These weren’t years of plenty, there were a lot of mouths to feed and not much land, which of course left a hole. So it was decided that I, who was level-headed and even-tempered, would be sent to help my mother’s sister, Tia. She’d given up hope of having children but wasn’t short of work. She had married a man much older than her who owned land, at least half a dozen cows, poultry and rabbits, as well as a vegetable garden. They got by well enough, but they could do with an extra pair of hands and with the company because they were starting to feel their age. I was thirteen when, with a bundle of clothes in my arms, my father on my left and Maria on my right, I left my family, home, village and mountain. It was just a few kilometres between Ermita and Pallarès, but it meant a day’s walk and losing sight of home. At the time, this hurt me more than anything else. As I walked away, I left the only world I had ever known behind. (p. 6)\n\nLooking back over her long and hard life, Conxa remembers that these years with her aunt and uncle turned out to be the best of her life. As heir to their small farm, she gradually becomes accepted in their village and eventually marries Jaume, a good, kind and loving man. He is accepted as a suitor because he agrees that they will live with Aunt Tia and her husband, that Conxa will continue to work on the farm, and that he will hand over what money he earns elsewhere to the family. They have three children, Elvira, Angeleta and the longed-for boy.\n\nBut in the winters he goes away to work at his trade, and fatally, he comes in contact with supporters of Spain’s short-lived Republic.\n\nAs history tells us, disaster strikes the Republic. Conxa is buffeted about by events which she does not understand and over which she has no control. In prison with her girls, Conxa feels like a stone after a landslide.\n\nIf someone or something stirs it, I’ll come tumbling down with the others. If nothing comes near, I’ll be here, still, for days and days…\n\nAngeleta doesn’t move either, clinging to my skirts. All of us are women and children. At least fifteen. What we have in common is that someone close to us has been taken. For a while no one says anything. Then, timidly, someone begins to talk.\n\nOur side of the river had already been taken by the nationalists, the Blackshirts. The other side was still in the hands of the Reds. There were families who wanted to cross to the Red side, which you did by the Algorri bridge. After the guard there was killed last night, the way over was clear. They say that they spoke to all the rich families in the valley. A priest gave some names too. That’s how they knew who to take. (pp. 59-60).\n\nIn her economical way, Barbal thus shows the role of the Catholic Church in helping the wealthy to sabotage the democratically elected Republic. And over the course of this narrative she shows the melancholy history of the mostly anonymous victims of the Civil War.\n\nFiction about the Spanish Civil War began to emerge from Spain with the death of the dictator Franco in 1975. Prior to that there were famous titles written from outside of Spain, such as For Whom The Bell Tolls (1940), by Ernest Hemingway and George Orwell’s Homage to Catalonia, (1938). From exile in France in 1962, Mercé Roderedo wrote La plaça del diamant (In Diamond Square, also translated as The Time of the Doves, (see my review). In the Night of Time (2009), by Antonio Muñoz Moline, translated by Edith Grossman came to prominence when it was nominated for the 2014 BTBA Best Translated Book Award for Fiction longlist and the European Book Prize for Fiction (2012). But to the best of my knowledge, Maria Barbal is the first to write about the Civil War from the perspective of peasants living a subsistence lifestyle in rural Spain.\n\nBack in April Stu wasn’t focussing on #WITmonth which takes place in August, but he featured these women writers in translation, which you can add to your reading list! (You can see Stu’s influence on my reading from the ones that I’ve reviewed too.)\n\nThe Mussel Feast, by Brigit Vanderbeke, my review The Mussel Feast (1990), by Birgit Vanderbeke, translated by Jamie Bulloch\n\nThe White Book, by Han Kang\n\nThe Pine Islands, by Marion Poschmann\n\nThe Discomfort of Evening, by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld\n\nTomb of Sand, by Geertanjali Shree, my review Tomb of Sand (2018), by Geetanjali Shree, translated by Daisy Rockwell\n\nAuthor: Maria Barbal (b.1949).\n\nTitle: Stone in a Landslide (Pedra de Tartera)\n\nTranslated from the Catalan by Laura McGloughlin and Paul Mitchell\n\nSeries: Cicle del Pallars #1\n\nPublisher: Peirene Press, 2010, first published 1985\n\nASIN: B0079IU2VI, Kindle Edition, 126 pages\n\nSource: Personal library, purchased for the Kindle from You Know Who.\n\nThis month’s #6Degrees, hosted by Kate from Books are my Favourite and Best starts with The Museum of Modern Love (2016), by Heather Rose. And for once I have read it… you can see my review here.\n\nThe obvious connection is to another book with ‘museum’ in the title. Death in the Museum of Modern Art (2014), by Alma Lazarevska, translated by Celia Hawkesworth, is a collection of short stories from a survivor of the siege of Sarajevo. (See my review here.)\n\nIt’s a good choice for #WITmonth, because (apart from being a book written by a woman in translation) it leads me to another book about a siege that I have just bought to read for #WITmonth… Recommended by Meytal who initiated #WITmonth and has collated reading lists on her website, it’s called Living Pictures, by Polina Barskova, translated by Catherine Ciepiela. I read the book description at Goodreads: an innovative, kaleidoscopic literary work about the Siege of Leningrad and its aftermath by one of Russia’s most acclaimed contemporary writers — and I wanted to read it because I will never forget my experience of visiting the memorial to the Siege of Leningrad in 2012. We had been swanning about doing touristy things in St Petersburg, museums and palaces and a canal cruise and so on, and all the while there was no mention anywhere of the million people who died in the city during the Nazi blockade of 1941-44. But on our last day, en route to Catherine’s Palace at Pushkin, our guide stopped at the Victory Monument, and reminded us to be respectful at the memorial because almost everyone in St Petersburg had lost someone in the war. And I realised that among the old people that I occasionally saw in the streets, there would have been survivors of that horror. It was chastening.\n\nLiving Pictures and the siege it commemorates brings me back to art, with The Madonnas of Leningrad (2006), by Debra Dean. As I said in my review I was expecting it to be a disappointment, and so would you if you could see the awful cover design of the edition I read, scroll to the bottom of my review to see it. But I found instead that it was …\n\n… an authentic portrayal of a family coming to terms with a parent ageing with Alzheimer’s; it brings to life the spirit of the people during the 1941-44 (872 days) German Siege of Leningrad during WWII, and it is a magical evocation of the Hermitage artwork which was stored for safety during the bombardment.\n\nPerhaps it’s because there is greater awareness of dementia these days, because more people live long enough to succumb to it, there are more stories that remind us to be more empathetic. One of the best of these is Ashley Hay’s tender and respectful portrait of Elsie in A Hundred Small Lessons (2017, see my review.) Elsie is an old lady who used to live in Lucy and Ben’s house, but now lives in an aged care home, and — lost in the past — she ‘escapes’ from time to time and goes ‘home’. The novel is also a love song to the river that threads through Brisbane…\n\nAnd that reminds me of Simon Cleary’s debut novel The Comfort of Figs (2008, see my review). It’s a fine story which links the dangers inherent in the building of Brisbane’s Story Bridge over that same river with present day violence and trauma.\n\nSimon has since written other fine novels, see here, and now has a new book out which is called Everything is Water. It’s a memoir of his pilgrimage along the Brisbane river from the source to the mouth. He walked the 344 kilometres of the banks of the river for four weeks, and you can read more about the book at his website.\n\nAnd that brings me finally to the book I’ve just read. Cameron Stewart’s debut novel Why Do Horses Run? is about a man mired in grief who abandons his old life and simply walks into being a missing person. He walks for three years, living off the land and not speaking to a soul. This is part of the book description from the back of the book.\n\nMissing in every sense of the word, a man walks into the landscape and doesn’t stop. In all weather and across all kinds of terrain, Ingvar walks until he can go no further, then gets up and does it again the following day, week after week, month after month. For three years he doesn’t know why he keeps going, or whether he is walking towards something or away from it.\n\nFrom a novel that’s about the more extreme of art forms to a story of losing one’s way in life, that’s my #6Degrees for this month!\n\nNext month (September, 2024), the starter book is After Story by Larissa Behrendt of the Eualeyai/Kamilaroi/Gamilaraay people, and (this makes two months in a row!) I’ve read it.\n\nWinner of the ALTA National Translation Award in 2006, and brought to my attention by Stu at Winston’s Dad, Götz and Meyer by Serbian author David Albahari (1948-2023) is a stunningly imaginative portrayal of intergenerational trauma.\n\nThis is the book description at Goodreads:\n\nBelieving they were being taken to a better camp, Belgrade’s Jews would climb into the truck with a sense of relief. Mainly women, children and the elderly, they expected a long and uncomfortable trip but, after crossing the border, their journey would come to an abrupt end. Here the drivers would get out and attach a hose from the exhaust to the back of the truck. Over the course of a few months in 1942 the Nazis systematically exterminated the majority of Serbia’s Jews using carbon monoxide and specially designed trucks. The only information the narrator of this bleakly comic novel can find about the summer when his relatives disappeared is the names of the truck drivers: Götz and Meyer. During his research he becomes fascinated by the unknowable characters and daily lives of these men. But his imagination proves a dangerous force, and his obsession with the past threatens to overwhelm him.\n\nAll this narrator knows is the names of the truck drivers who drove his parents to their fate, but almost the entire book consists of his imagined interactions with these men. His preoccupation is whether and how much they knew about what they were doing and whether they felt remorse. At first, he pulls back into reality and reminds himself that he knows nothing about Götz and Meyer, any more than he knows anything about the people missing from his family tree:\n\nMeyer even confessed to me that he felt his heart beat faster and that later, when he recalled those days, he would shiver. Look at this: I am beginning to imagine myself talking with people whose faces I don’t even know. I knew precious little, indeed, about the faces of most of my kin, but in their case I can at least look at my own face in the mirror and seek their features there, whereas with Götz and Meyer I had no such help. Anyone could have been Götz. Anyone could have been Meyer, and yet Götz and Meyer were only Götz and Meyer, and no-one else could be who they were. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that I constantly had this feeling that I was slipping, even when I was walking on solid ground. (p. 45).\n\nBut as time goes by, under the torment of this obsession to know the unknowable, the narrative becomes a darker force in his life.\n\nNothing easier than to stray into the wasteland of someone else’s consciousness. (p.45)\n\nWe read about the daily habits of these truck drivers as if the narrator were present with them while they dressed and shaved and had their breakfasts.\n\nIn the morning, while I dressed, I’d be Götz and Meyer. I did not allow myself to be distracted by details, for instance: wondering whether German soldiers wore short-sleeved undershirts, or dog tags with their personal details round their necks. I always wore singlets, cut high under the armpits, important because I sweat so much, and nothing was going to make me stop wearing them. This was about something else. I would look at myself, let’s say, in the mirror and say: Now Meyer is combing his hair, and then Götz would ask Meyer what he’d be having for breakfast. Once I got up in a foul mood, as Götz, and when asked that same question, told Meyer angrily: bananas. Lord, how Meyer laughed. His razor bounced around in his hand! Later, when he rinsed off the foam, he noticed a little nick on his left cheek, but that only reminded him of Götz’s reply, and then he burst into guffaws again. Götz didn’t say anything, because by then he was already in the kitchen, where he watched as I made coffee. Quite the bright one, that Götz, never to put the cart before the horse. As they drove towards Belgrade, he never carped to Meyer, possibly Götz, about speeding. It is important to tend to State property entrusted to your care, but even more important to tend to good relations with your work colleagues, since your success in completing any assignment depends far more on that than on anything else. (pp. 46-47)\n\nAnd there is nothing easier than a reader finding these imagined observations entirely convincing… until we read that the narrator tells the woman at the Jewish Historical Museum that Götz and Meyer were only human after all and then it becomes difficult for us to imagine that anyone human could do the evil these men did.\n\nShe was silent for so long, looking right into my eyes, that in the end I wondered if she hadn’t heard me so I repeated what I had said. Indeed they were, said the woman, there can be no doubt about that. But what sort of human? It is incredible, the degree to which other people are so much better at grasping the essence of something which eludes us. Really, what sort of human beings were Götz and Meyer? What kind of man would, like the two of them, consent to do a job that meant putting five or six thousand souls to death? I find it hard to give a student a bad grade at the end of the semester, let alone at the end of the year, but that is nothing compared to the way Götz and Meyer must have felt. Or what if they felt nothing at all? I could stare all I wanted to in the mirror, to fill the voids of their faces with mine, but I still couldn’t come up with an answer. (p47-8)\n\nOne of the unsettling aspects of this narrative reveals the problem of educating the young. I have seen commentary about school groups behaving in disrespectful ways at sites such as Auschwitz, yet the narrator’s technique for forcing his students to ‘relive’ the experience of the people in the truck driven by Götz and Meyer, seems grotesque. There is an urgent imperative to educate young people both about the Holocaust and the risks inherent in the demonising of the Other, but we do not want to traumatise them.\n\nThis is only a very short novella, but it is too harrowing to be read in a single sitting. The fact that it is written in one single paragraph, (though conventions of punctuation are otherwise observed) made it harder to find a stopping place, but the historical details of the killing of Belgrade’s Jews during World War Two are chilling. Gotz and Meyer were real people and their method of killing 6,300 Jews between them is horrible. The detached tone of the narrator describing the ‘normalcy’ of routines and procedures and interactions between the camp commander and the drivers is reinforced by the narrator’s attempts to rationalise the behaviour in terms of the modern workplace with its rationales for good interpersonal relations, business efficiency and science which has no mercy. I wanted to finish this book (which I had started without much thought in a waiting room) so that I could start my reading for #WITMonth which I intend to tackle through some of the Kindle titles that have been on the digital TBR for ages. But this is a book which needs to be punctuated by restorative cups of tea and time in the garden.\n\nBTW I don’t think I’ve ever read an Amazon review before, but when I visited the site to get the publication details, there were Kris McCracken’s thoughts at the top under the heading Top Reviews from Australia. His review begins with his observation that Götz and Meyer is …\n\nAn incredibly unsettling tale of obsession and memory, much more than your straightforward Holocaust-as-narrative-device-to-explore-the-concept-of-evil.\n\nA hunt at Goodreads led me to the same review there, where I am happier to follow him!\n\nAuthor: David Albahari (1948-2023)\n\nTitle: Götz and Meyer (Гец и Мајер)\n\nTranslated from the Serbian by Ellen Elias–Bursac\n\nPublisher: Vintage Digital, (Penguin Random-House), 2012\n\nCover design: not acknowledged in my edition.\n\nASIN: B006X0M11M, Kindle edition, 178 pages\n\nSource: Personal library, purchased from You Know Who for the Kindle, $15.99.\n\n(It bothers me a lot that since the demise of The Book Depository, I seem to be buying more titles for the Kindle because it’s the least expensive way to buy international titles that are not stocked locally.)\n\nKaboom!\n\nYes, that was the sound of another long-held illusion hitting the dust!\n\nI knew nothing much about Donald Horne when the biography by Ryan Cropp was shortlisted for the National Biography award. I had read one of his novels and found it derivative, tedious and predictable. But long before that, I had read the 1974 reissue of his most famous book The Lucky Country, published in 1964. To quote my own thoughts from when I reviewed the novel:\n\nEveryone my age knows the name of the Australian journalist, writer, and public intellectual Donald Horne AO (1921-2005) because everyone my age has either read The Lucky Country (1964), or heard everyone else talk about it so much that they thought they didn’t need to read it themselves. Indeed, the title of that book went into the vernacular where it is misused all the time to signify what a beaut country Australia is. Misused because, as the blurb at Goodreads tells anyone who looks it up:\n\nHorne took Australian society to task for its philistinism, provincialism and dependence. The book was a wake-up call to an unimaginative nation, an indictment of a country mired in mediocrity and manacled to its past.\n\nOuch. But true. It was still mostly true when I read it in my young adulthood, even after three years of a progressive government in 1975.\n\nI liked The Lucky Country because it savaged the doldrum years of Robert Menzies, exemplified for me by shoes and by yarn. Yes, shoes and yarn. We could not buy a decent pair of women’s shoes in Australia. Imports, made with good quality leather and in enticing styles were prohibitively expensive for an ordinary person like me. The Australian made ones were made of poor quality leather, lasted five minutes and even in the years before the internet we knew that they were out-of-date before ever they became available in the shops. As for yarn, there was a company which dominated the market and somehow turned beautiful Australian wool into cheap yarn in banal colours which pilled as soon as you wore it. The Lucky Country told us that Australian business and manufacturing, propped up by import tariffs and decades of benign and lethargic Liberal governments, was lazy and complacent, and we knew it to be true. (Don’t get me started about Australian cars. Those of us who remember Peter Wherrett’s Torque on ABC TV will never forget that footage of the car sliding out of control when he braked on a wet surface.)\n\n(Mind you, you still can’t buy decent shoes or yarn, but now it’s for different reasons. People want cheap stuff from China and that’s what retailers sell.)\n\nNeedless to say, Cropp’s chapter length analysis of The Lucky Country is considerably more complex and nuanced than mine!\n\nWhatever, Donald Horne was a bit of a hero of mine, and I was looking forward to reading his bio. But though I enjoyed it immensely, I was saddened to find that my ‘hero’ had feet of clay. Almost half the book is about a man who — to put it mildly — would not have been on my Christmas card list…\n\nI learned about his days as a youthful iconoclast for-the-sake-of-it; and as a tawdry journalist writing fake news for tabloids in the UK. I read about how, after free-loading on his first wife Ethel’s rellos for free accommodation and then borrowing against her inheritance to buy a cottage so that he could write, he then abandoned her in England. Back in Australia he became an arch-conservative rabble-rouser, and an anti-communist polemicist for Frank Packer’s magazines.\n\nWell, whether his eccentric trajectory is characterised as confusion, contradictions, hypocrisy or an evolution in thinking that coincided with maturity, Horne changed his tune and became the man we admired for his perspicacious observations about Australian society. How did that happen? Perhaps Horne knew that decision-makers at Penguin interested a new book about Australia were worried about his…\n\n…strident arguments about South-East Asian communism […] coupled with his position at the AACF [Australian Association for Cultural Freedom, quietly funded by the CIA], the notoriety he had earned as the editor of Observer and The Bulletin and the general black mark of his close association with Frank Packer. (p.146)\n\nBrian Stonier, managing director at Penguin Australia, wrote to Geoffrey Dutton suggesting that a provisional list of contents and some sort of synopsis would be wise. This book about ‘the suburbs and on changing Australian attitudes’ became The Lucky Country.\n\nAs time passes, certain cultural events come to act as placeholders for entire historical eras, signposting the national narrative and in the process assuming a significance of their own. The publication of Donald Horne’s The Lucky Country in December 1964 and the debate it stimulated in later years was, in a way, one such cultural event, having long since become so closely associated with the transformative changes of 1960s Australia that it almost seems to have produced them. With over fifty years of hindsight, it now appears as a kind of singular literary manifestation of a nation (and a man) in transition, a symbolic stake in the ground at the point between the old Australia and the new; one of those books that, by exaggerating a sense of rupture, provides a simple framework for political change, an artificial periodisation between the past and the future, the then and the now. (p.159)\n\nThe blurb at Black Inc Books says:\n\nRyan Cropp’s landmark biography positions Horne as an antipodean Orwell, a lively, independent and distinct literary voice ‘searching for the temper of the people, accepting it, and moving on from there’.\n\nAn antipodean Orwell? I don’t know about that. I haven’t read enough of his work to know if Horne had the same mastery of prose and prescience about global politics, but that’s the point. I would have read more of Horne’s stuff — in the way that I read everything I could find by Orwell — if I’d found it more compelling, or if enticing ensuing books had found their way to me. Though there was a bit of a flurry over Death of the Lucky Country in 1976 (after The Dismissal), I don’t remember anything else that might have provoked me into reading his non-fiction. After The Lucky Country, he was writing interesting essays, and he was a public intellectual determined to make Australians reflect on their place in the world, but it all passed me by.\n\nTruth be told, until I read this biography, #DuckingForCover Horne seemed like more of a one-hit-wonder to me.\n\nWhich is why this is such an excellent biography, charting Horne’s subsequent career: his embrace of Whitlam as a reformer; his republicanism; his advocacy for the arts; and his career as an academic. (It was interesting to learn that the Whitlam reforms which made university free, led to an explosion in student numbers and a shortage of lecturers to teach them. So Horne, without a degree or any teaching experience or any record of academic publications, got a job at UNSW teaching politics!). It was also pleasing to see that Horne’s second wife Myfanwy is given her due, not just as the crucial domestic support for Horne’s writing, but also her role as editor. (She said, *chuckle* that she learned patience through Donald, not from him!)\n\nYou can listen to an interview with the author here. And you can read a proper review of Cropp’s book that tags it as a salute to Horne as one of the country’s leading journalists, editors and intellectuals for half a century, at The Conversation.\n\nUpdate, later the same day: the winners of the 2024 National Biography Award were Lamisse Hamouda and Jillian Graham. See here.\n\nAuthor: Ryan Cropp\n\nTitle Donald Horne, A Life in the Lucky Country\n\nPublisher: La Trobe University Press, an imprint of Black Inc Books, 2023\n\nISBN: 9781760641375, pbk., 374 pages\n\nSource: Kingston Library\n\nIt isn’t necessary, but it adds greatly to the reading experience for this book if you’ve visited Lisbon…\n\nThe Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis is a 1984 novel by 1998 Nobel Laureate José Saramago; it was first translated into English in 1991. It begins as Ricardo Reis arrives back in Portugal after sixteen years in exile in Brazil. He is a doctor, but it is not until the security police take an interest in his aimless activities that he takes steps to rent an apartment and makes a desultory effort to practise. Most of the time he wanders the streets of Lisbon in between torrential downpours or he idles away his time in eateries or his room. Reis as flaneur gives Saramago the opportunity to describe in vivid detail, the distinctive streetscapes and vistas of Portugal’s capital city. If you’ve been there, you can see events in your mind’s eye as Reis makes his way around the city.\n\nWhile Reis’s activities are aimless, and his often banal observations are not what one might expect from an intellectual and a poet, the characters are intriguing. Readers don’t need to know much about Portugal’s most famous poet, Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935), except that the titular character Ricardo Reis is one of the heteronyms used by Pessoa, and he has his own page at Wikipedia. In Saramago’s novel, Reis wanders into Lisbon’s cemetery, and meets up with Pessoa, and they have several other meetings thereafter. So yes, the novel is playfully absurdist, woven around an imaginary character in conversation with the ghost of a dead poet who had died months ago.\n\nAlong the way, Reis has an affair with a chambermaid called Lydia from the hotel where he first stayed, and an attraction to another young woman called Marcenda, who is a guest at the Hotel Bragança near the river Tagus. These relationships allow Saramago to depict status relationships: there is never any question of Reis formalising his relationship with Lydia because of the gulf in class between them. Indeed, even when he moves out of the hotel and into his own apartment, Lydia is not only his lover but also his charwoman. It is not until late in the novel when Lydia reports her communist brother’s political opinions regarding the civil war in Spain, that they have a conversation about the fact that they do not have conversations because they have nothing in common. However, Reis’s attraction to Marcenda is aimless too. He fancies that he is in love with her but never gets beyond a kiss, and chases her fruitlessly to Fatima when she goes there to satisfy her father’s hopes of a miracle to cure her withered arm. These relationships with women are emblematic of his alienation from the society in which he lives.\n\nSaramago uses the conversations between Pessoa and Reis to satirise the political situation in Portugal in the 1930s. Set in the immediate months before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and the rise of fascism, Portugal is flooded with refugees but Reis views the situation dispassionately. He chats with Pessoa about the news (because Pessoa, being dead, cannot read the papers) and reports on Mussolini’s campaign in Abyssinia, and the process by which the dictator Salazar solidifies his rule in Portugal. These newspaper reports are juxtaposed among newspaper adverts offering implausible results as solutions to various situations. Most of this narrative is portrayed sarcastically from a right-wing point-of-view, including Saramago’s scorn for the role of the church in Spanish politics.\n\nThe style of the narrative may tax some readers. Sentences and paragraphs are long and discursive, punctuation is minimal, and dialogue is often inserted into other sentences, marked only by capital letters denoting a change of speaker. There are many digressions, with occasional intrusions by the narrator expressing his opinion, rather than the action and opinions of the characters. But quite apart from the absurdism, it is often slyly funny, provoking the occasional laugh-out-loud moment.\n\nRicardo Reis had told the manager, I would like breakfast brought up to my room at nine-thirty. Not that he intended to sleep so late, but he wished to avoid having to jump out of bed half-awake, struggling to slip his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown, groping for his slippers, and feeling panic that he wasn’t moving quickly enough to satisfy whoever was standing outside his door, arms laden with a huge tray bearing coffee and milk, toast, a sugar bowl, perhaps some cherry preserve or marmalade, a slice of dark grainy quince paste, a sponge cake, brioches with a fine crust, crunchy biscuits, or slices of French toast, those scrumptious luxuries served in hotels. We shall soon learn if the Bragança goes in for such extravagance, because Ricardo Reis is about to sample his first breakfast. It would be nine-thirty on the dot, Salvador promised him, and did not promise in vain, for here at nine-thirty on the dot Lydia is knocking on the door. The observant reader will say that this is impossible, she has both her arms occupied, but we would be in a sorry state if we had to hire only servants with three arms or more. (p.43)\n\nActually, in Saramago’s absurdist world, it would not be so absurd at all!\n\nI read this novel for Stu’s Spanish/Portuguese Lit Month 2024 at Winston’s Dad.\n\nFor another review, see The Modern Novel.\n\nAuthor: José Saramago (1922-2010)\n\nTitle: The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis\n\nTranslated from the Portuguese by Giovanni Pontiero\n\nIntroduction by by Giovanni Pontiero\n\nPublisher: The Harvill Press, 1999, first published 1984\n\nISBN: 9781860465024, 358 pages, Paperback\n\nSource: Personal library, probably purchased from The Book Depository.\n\nDo people today know what a party line is? There’s the political meaning i.e. the collective understanding of a political party’s ideology and policies, coupled with an expectation that party members will conform to them. But it can also mean a local phone circuit that is shared by multiple users. In the 1970s, if you lived in the bush in some parts of Australia, you shared a telephone line with your community whether you wanted to or not. There was usually some kind of loose community cooperation to ensure that the line wasn’t tied up for too long by one caller, and there was an implicit understanding that you could interrupt to call in an emergency, but the greatest constraint was that there was usually some obnoxious busybody who listened in on other people’s calls.\n\n(Of course in those days not everyone had a phone anyway. Our parents had phones, but we didn’t have one of our own till the late 70s, and none of our friends did either. But public phone booths were ubiquitous, and news that couldn’t wait for the post came by telegram.)\n\nSharing a party line is relevant to Sue Orr’s debut novel because the characters include an obnoxious busybody who makes it impossible for a victim of domestic abuse to get help. Yet despite the setting in 1970s New Zealand, the story remains relevant today.\n\nThe Party Line takes place in a farming community where the annual influx of sharemilkers and their families swells the population of Fenward each year. The sharemilkers ‘know their place’: they are not part of the community and won’t be unless and until they can buy their own land. But everyone knows everyone’s business, except when it comes to the domestic abuse perpetrated by Jack Gilbert, a prominent member of the community. That’s nobody’s business, and the ‘party line’ is for everyone to turn a blind eye.\n\nThat is, until feisty young Gabrielle Baxter arrives with her father Ian. Ian is grieving the death of his wife from cancer and is barely coping with day-to-day life. Gabrielle has been left to her own devices in many ways and is more mature and worldly than her peers. At school, she makes friends with Nickie Walker, whose mother is not best pleased about that because Gabrielle does not conform to her expectations of 13-year-old behaviour.\n\nGabrielle is outraged when she discovers the truth about Mrs Gilbert, and she does her best to enlist help from adults who know all about it anyway but are feigning ignorance. With the kind of courage that only a thirteen year old with no understanding of the potential consequences can have, she stages a public denunciation to get what she wants: justice for a damaged soul too afraid to get it for herself.\n\nI discovered Sue Orr’s writing when Upswell Publishing published Loop Tracks (2021, see my review) in Australia and I bought this one at the same time.\n\nAuthor: Sue Orr\n\nTitle: The Party Line\n\nPublisher: Vintage, Penguin NZ (Penguin Random House) 2015\n\nCover and text artwork and design by Sarah Healey\n\nISBN 9781775537557; eISBN 9781775537564 (Kindle edition), 256 pages\n\nSource: Purchased for the Kindle from You Know Who.\n\nTo discover other titles in #AYearofNZLit click the logo below.\n\nRegular readers of this blog will know that I first became interested in the representation of older women in fiction after coming across the Older Women in Fiction Month at the Global Literature in Libraries Initiative where the curator Caroline Lodge wrote in her introductory post that:\n\nA common complaint of older women is that they become invisible. My blog series is in part a challenge to that invisibility in fiction.\n\nIf you investigate Caroline’s page: about the older women in fiction series you will see that she is interested in fiction…\n\n… that depicts older people, especially older women, as real humans, with the full range of emotions and experiences. Such books are to be treasured but can be hard to find.\n\nLaurence Fearnley’s new novel At the Grand Glacier Hotel (2024) is one to add to Caroline’s list. (And mine.) It’s is a wise, thoughtful and engaging novel that explores the all-too-common experience of acquiring a disability later in life. Adjusting to new limitations in the body is shown to be a process that takes time and energy and effort. And patience and courage. It’s not a straightforward journey and it’s complicated by an ambivalence towards getting help. Older women for whom independence and respect were hard-won achievements are reluctant to shed them, and yet the pathway to being the best that’s possible is literally and psychologically full of pitfalls that make some forms of help a necessity, at least some of the time.\n\nThe central character and narrator, Libby, is stranded by herself at the Grand Glacier Hotel on the West Coast of the South Island. She and her husband Curtis were fulfilling a long-held ambition to stay at the resort when a landslide separated them after he’d made a side trip to retrieve his reading glasses that he’d lost along the way. After a little while the road is cleared and it becomes possible for them to reunite, but he has to go back to work and she decides to stay and test her independence. Libby is recovering from major surgery on her leg to remove a large sarcoma, and Curtis has been a loyal and supportive husband — but now she wants to see if she can manage by herself.\n\nThough I’ve never suffered anything as catastrophic as a sarcoma, I could relate to Libby’s experience of coming undone because of bravado, coincidentally in a similar setting. With any recently acquired disability, one has to learn what can be done and what must no longer be done, and discovering which is which involves some chastening experiences. Some time after I mushed my ankle, The Spouse and I went up to the Mount Buffalo Chalet in the Victorian Alps and we went for a walk around the grounds. He charged on ahead while I plodded on behind him — until I came to a very large boulder that blocked my way. It was about the size of a king-size bed, and not quite my own height with smooth rounded sides. I thought that maybe I could get up it, but I knew I could not keep my balance to get back down on the other side. And I was not going to call him back to help… I just stood there, waiting, feeling ashamed and embarrassed, until he realised his companion was no longer with him and came back to see where I was.\n\nIn Fearnley’s novel, Libby tests herself on a walk with a companion, a nice young man called James, but someone has parked carelessly and in negotiating around it, her weak leg lands her in a ditch and she cannot get out by herself. He helps her out and they go on with the walk. But later, setting off for a different trip, he mentions this incident and she realises that for her this had been a panic-stricken humiliating sabotage of her confidence and self-esteem, but that’s not what it was for him:\n\nTo my embarrassment, James immediately raised the carparking incident and how I’d ended up on the loop track. Some people might have embellished the story, for dramatic impact, but James almost undersold what had happened and it occurred to me, then, how completely different his experience of the episode had been from mine. I’d been truly worried and frightened that I might be stuck in a ditch for a long time, possibly all night. James’s version described an event of almost no consequence. I’d lost my balance, stumbled and fallen, and he’d given me a hand up. That was all there was to it. My disaster was his minor incident. (p.127-8)\n\nBut what could have been a sombre memoir full of sobering incidents like this, is a novel which is often wry, amusing and self-deprecating. There’s a scene where she decides to take a bath in spite of a long-held aversion to them. She announces this on the phone to Curtis, who reminds her that she gets bored and complains about how wasteful baths are. But she’s tired and sore after overdoing things in the morning, so…\n\nThe bath took an age to fill and I was restless and bored before it was ready. Waiting felt like another punishment but having emptied the small bottle of hotel body wash into the water for a bubble bath effect I had to see it through. I convinced myself that this bath would be different from all the others; the fragrant foamy water would cure me. A twenty-minute soak was all it would take. I didn’t fully believe that but was prepared to pretend that it did.\n\nClimbing into the bath took a lot of effort, and as I lowered myself into the water, a horrible thought entered my mind. I pushed it to the back of my head, but it was too late, it had already taken hold. What if I couldn’t get out? (p.140)\n\nOh my, I have had the exact same experience: two reliable ankles are what’s needed to get out of a bath!\n\nMy attempts to dispel my fears sounded hollow, and my thoughts spiralled: how stupid not to have done a fully clothed dry run before stripping off and getting in, why add slippery bubbles into the mix, how dumb not to have brought my phone with me into the bathroom, why didn’t I think it through, what was wrong with me? (p.140)\n\nFor a brief moment I contemplated calling for help, but the shame of it all kept me silent. I didn’t want to be discovered naked and dripping wet. To be rescued again, by healthy strangers would be the end of me. Scenes from my hospital stay came back to me now, a humiliating reminder of how helpless and exposed I’d been. (p.141)\n\nSelf-pity occasionally beckons, as it would to anybody, but is rejected.\n\nAs quickly as I could, I crossed the lawn, intending to do a full circuit of the property, but, halfway through, changed my mind and started back towards the carpark, determined to follow the loop track — at least until it was too dark to see. As usual, in my hurry, I’d left my walking pole behind. I kept forgetting that spontaneous activity belonged to the past. Just as I’d learnt to always travel with spare nappies, wipes, water and nibbles when Hannah was a baby and a toddler, I should have got into the habit of bringing painkillers and a stick now I was an invalid. For some reason, my just-in-case brain was not yet tuned into my own bodily requirements and I suffered because of it. (p.126)\n\nHotel novels are great for assembling a quixotic cast of characters, and so it is at The Grand Glacier Hotel. There is an irritating know-all called Mr Kendrick spruiking Esperanto; a fan fiction novelist churning out her thirtieth book; a gossipy woman who works in a vintage clothing shop near Libby’s home; Alex who runs a bird sanctuary for Kiwi, and James who is hunting for the elusive Kokako: visit here to hear it… it sounds like a rusty gate to me! Plus #NoSpoilers! someone has assembled a bizarre treasure hunt which reminded me of the sort of parlour games and entertainment that used to take place in guest houses when I was young. (Essential in pre-screen days in places where the weather keeps people indoors.)\n\nThe other characters are Libby’s off-stage daughter Hannah, who shares the same off-beat sense of humour as her parents, and Curtis, always ready to come to the rescue, but respecting Libby’s need to confront her demons. Their dialogue is based on long familiarity and deep affection, and their phone conversations are interesting for what is not said, as much as for what is expressed. Libby is a bit gauche with other people, because she’s a bit of an over-thinker, but never with her nearest and dearest.\n\nThe Grand Glacier Hotel is modelled on the Franz Jozef Hotel which you can see on the front cover of the book. It was destroyed by floods in 2016. A quick Google search shows that there is the usual stoush over redevelopment plans… because even though the glacier is shrinking, and it’s too dangerous to go anywhere near it, it is still the third-most-visited tourist spot in New Zealand. Wikipedia outlines the current options for tourists:\n\nAs of 2023, the valley walk ends at a lookout about 3000 m from the main terminal face of the glacier. Visiting the glacier now requires a helicopter flight past the unstable terminal face. Glacier walks also require some specialised equipment, namely ice axes and crampons that latch onto a sturdy boot. These are usually provided by tour companies.\n\nAs the walking part of any tour up to the glacier takes a long time, and ends at the first icefall (a frozen waterfall, draping a natural step in the land underneath), many tourists book helicopter tours from one of the several local airlines, which usually drop their guests between the first and second icefalls, for a guided 1–2 hour walk through the broken ground atop the glacier. Although the glacial landscape changes almost daily, given the glacier’s unusually fast flow, and some walks including passages through ice tunnels, they are still considered quite safe and only somewhat strenuous.\n\nClearly the tourism dollar is in competition with conservation values…\n\nThere is more to this novel than Libby’s journey towards living again. The novel is also part of Fearnley’s series responding to the senses.\n\nScented (2019, see my review), was the first, exploring the power of perfume and the sense of smell, and it was followed by Winter Time (2022) which focusses on the sense of touch. (See a review here by Josie Shapiro.) At the Grand Glacier Hotel is a lush soundscape of torrential rain and storms, bird calls, the hum of conversation and Libby’s memories of the sounds of the hospital.\n\nAt the Grand Glacier Hotel is not a memoir, and it is not until the reader reaches the Acknowledgments at the back of the book that — reading between lines written with restraint — that it becomes clear that the author was writing from her own experience. I loved this book because even though it reminded me that my own disability is comparatively minor, it validated my own feelings about loss, dependence and embarrassment.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nPS It was this review that prompted me to borrow the book from the library.\n\nAuthor: Laurence Fearnley\n\nTitle: At the Grand Glacier Hotel\n\nPublisher: Penguin New Zealand (PRH), 2024\n\nCover design: Cat Taylor\n\nCover art: Franz Jozef Glacier New Zealand (detail) by E M Lovell-Smith, 1932\n\nISBN: 9781776950638, pbk., 280 pages\n\nSource: Bayside Library\n\nImage credits:\n\nMount Buffalo Chalet: Visit Mount Buffalo: https://visitmountbuffalo.com.au/sightseeing/the-chalet/\n\nFranz Jozef Glacier: By Jörg Hempel, CC BY-SA 3.0 de, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=18216844\n\nKokako: By doug mak from San Francisco – kokako, CC BY-SA 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3954848\n\nTo discover other titles in #AYearofNZLit click the logo below.\n\nAll the Rivers Run South is one of the most interesting books I’ve read in a while. Ouyang Yu’s eighth novel in English, it’s experimental in form, comprising a novel within a novel, which purports to be the unpublished draft of a PhD by a deceased student called Baohui. Some of it is printed in Chinese characters, and there would be more of them had Stacey, Baohui’s bilingual PhD supervisor, not excised them for a variety of reasons. She wants to see this work published, albeit posthumously, but she is struggling with the constraints of the Australian publishing industry and her own perceptions of what a work of literature might be.\n\nAt first, it takes a bit of effort for the reader to work out what’s going on, but it soon falls into place. The novel within the novel is a purported autobiography of a Chinese migrant called Ah Sin. He came to Australia during the gold rush, and turned to making a living as a story teller. So there are short stories from Chinese culture such as vignettes about Confucius, within the purported autobiography. There are recounts of events in Australia and of his travel back ot China and a visit to Ireland. The different layers of the narrative are punctuated by emails from Stacey trying to bring Baohui into line with the requirements of an exegesis, by her notes justifying her editing decisions, and by Baohui’s research notes, his (often unsent) responses to Stacey’s critiques, and his philosophical digressions into the nature of history and literature.\n\nDespite his frustrations, Baohui is motivated to bring to life the untold story of Chinese migration during the Gold Rush. History doesn’t reveal much about the facts of this aspect of our history, and almost nothing about the people themselves. For example, one of the research notes reveals that Baohui has unearthed the fact that up to 1857 only three Chinese women came to Australia. What were these women like? What were their motivations? How did they get on once they were here? Were their feet bound? (This question has more significance when the reader remembers the very long walk that the Chinese had to undertake from where they landed in South Australia to the Victorian goldfields.)\n\nAustralians are familiar with many goldfields narratives in one form or another, but very few of them acknowledge the Chinese presence at all, and when they do, they often represent the Chinese as market gardeners who had turned to it because they had failed at mining*. Rarely do these narratives acknowledge the racism that made it almost impossible for them to succeed. All the Rivers Run South is the first that I have read which represents a Chinese man who is has clearly had a Confucian education, is literate, is knowledgeable about Europe, and able to quote English verse. Ah Sin takes the initiative to travel to Melbourne, to learn English from a priest at St Francis’s church, and to make a living doing what he wants to do, and not because he was a failure.\n\nPlayfulness with language is juxtaposed with poignant truths:\n\nDear Stacey,\n\nOne thing that may baffle you here is the seeming lack of friends on the part of Ah Sin as it conflicts with the common perception of the Chinese as a large landmass kind of people, I mean a large peoplemass, a landpeoplemass or peoplelandmass, that went everywhere en masse in those days, a people that seem always on the move in twos and threes if not in twenties and thirties or two hundreds or three hundreds.\n\nNothing is further from the truth. As far as I know, and from my own experience, they were the loneliest people in the world. They lived apart from the whites and other people of colour, both as a result of the government’s separatist policy and of their own reluctance to mix indiscriminately. They even lived apart from themselves, the way they did back in their own country, each clinging to their own clan or village, like a large plate of loose sands, not my words but the words of Sun Yat-sen. (p.229)\n\nThe fictional Ah Sin always seemed more lively and real to me than the disembodied presence of Stacey in this novel, and I had to keep reminding myself that she is meant to be real while he is meant to be fictional, but they are both fictional. And so too is Baohui, whose restraint in responding to Stacey being out of her depth because she’s not as intellectually adventurous as he is, is matched only by her restraint in dealing with a text that doesn’t match her expectations, seems unpublishable, and that often requires that offensive or irrelevant material to be excised.\n\nAll the Rivers Run South is not a book for everybody, but it is a book that will fascinate intrepid readers because we don’t often get books like this one here in Australia. There are experimental authors producing amazing work internationally, but they’re not telling our stories or interrogating our society and culture or shedding light on our history like Ouyang Yu does.\n\nIs what Stacey says true, when she cuts from the text Baohui’s found poems created for his own amusement with materials from Beckett’s ‘Worstward Ho’ and Watt?\n\nLiterary experimentation will have to submit itself to the market demands or die its own quiet death. Who wants to read experi/mental stuff anyway? Not even the experi-/mental people themselves. (p.250)\n\nOr, as the poem in the last chapter asserts, is experimental fiction essential?\n\nExperimental fiction is fiction\n\nthat refuses to stay\n\nwithin the boundaries laid out\n\neither by traditional realistic\n\nliterary fiction or by\n\nthe standard genres of thriller\n\nmystery, sci-fi, romance\n\nand so forth, We\n\nmight say that experimental fiction\n\nis non-escapist literature in\n\nthat it does not\n\nseek to seduce its readers\n\ninto a dreamy forgetfulness. (p. 407)\n\nKudos to Puncher & Wattman for publishing it, especially in the current difficult publishing environment!\n\n*One notable exception to the dearth of narratives about the Chinese experience during the Gold Rush is the only recently published bilingual edition of The Poison of Polygamy (1909-1910 by Wong Shee Ping translated by Ely Finch. Wong Shee Ping was a Christian preacher, a Chinese revolutionary and prominent in Victoria’s Chinese business community, and his proselytising story about the evils of polygamy was serialised in a Chinese-language newspaper during the early 20th century in Melbourne.

It wasn’t eligible under the terms of Miles Franklin’s bequest that the award is for ‘a novel which is of the highest literary merit and presents Australian life in any of its phases’. Koch’s novel is set uncompromisingly in Indonesia, during the soon-to-be-deposed President Sukarno’s 1965 ‘Year of Living Dangerously’. That was why Australians loved it: Indonesia was in the news in 1975 for all the wrong reasons, and Koch’s novel captured the sense of crisis and betrayal on our doorstep. The Year of Living Dangerously won the 1978 Age Book of the Year Award and the 1979 National Book Council Award, and it made Koch’s name.\n\nAustralian journalists in the novel who felt threatened on the streets of Jakarta in 1965 had good cause to feel betrayed. Only twenty years beforehand, Australia had been Indonesia’s most stalwart and highly effective supporter of its declaration of independence in 1945 which was rejected by Dutch colonists. Four years of intransigent negotiations and bloody conflict ensued. But through diplomatic channels in the UN and elsewhere, Australia led one of the first successes of the United Nations and of regional diplomacy: an end to the fighting in the Indonesian archipelago and the bringing into being of a new and great member of the world community. But although Koch’s novel is derived from historical events, Australia’s support is remembered only by its narrator who is older than the other journalists.\n\nTo maintain his grip on power, Sukarno was whipping up postcolonial vilification which made it necessary for western journalists to seek refuge in the Wayang — a foreigner’s bar in a foreigner’s hotel. Because outside, Konfrontasi had shifted from military confrontation with Malaysia to Konfrontasi within the nation so it was wise for white faces never to go out alone, to go out at night, or to go into certain pockets of the city. As Cookie, the journalist-narrator who tells the story some years after events, recalls:\n\nSukarno had popularised the term, hypnotising his crowds at the great rallies we covered almost every week at the Jakarta Sports Stadium he had built with Russian money.\n\nHe had made for himself and his people a sort of theatre there; a theatre of romantic-revolutionary euphoria in which they were spellbound. And he had created a strange propaganda world of paper and capital letters: a world divided between the NEFOS—New Emerging Forces—and the OLDEFOS—Old Fashioned Forces—where we whites were called NEKOLIM: ‘neo-colonial imperialists’. Bung Karno showed a genius for such coinings, as a substitute for economic management. Talismans, intended to change reality, they have all gone under glass now, with the other debased coinage of history: but in that year, Konfrontasi was a term to juggle with. Malaysia was confronted. Its protector Britain was confronted. The United States was confronted. The whole western world and India as well were confronted, while the Bung warmed his ego at the blaze, striking dictatorial attitudes from Europe’s nineteen thirties, his black pitji tilted in defiance: a baffling mixture of menace and playboy appeal. The people sometimes called him bapak—father—but really, he was the Bung. the daring elder brother who carried out every outrageous scheme they had ever longed for, and shouted every imagined insult at the world’s Establishment—and at shady colonial masters who might try to come back. (p.8-9)\n\nCookie is an old hand, and one in whom some of his compatriots confide, especially as the alcohol flows in the Wayang bar. From this vantage-point, he weaves his story, supplementing these confidences with dossiers that had been covertly kept by Billy Kwan, a Chinese-Australian photojournalist with mysterious access to members of the government and diplomatic services. That is how Cookie knows about the sex-lives of this mostly male company of journalists, and it’s how he discovers the souring of Kwan’s admiration for Sukarno.\n\nSukarno’s schemes include flirting among the rival communists from the USSR and China. Russian money had paid for grandiose building projects but a bedroom confidence reveals a rumour that the Chinese are sending weapons to arm the peasants for a revolution. But the Muslim majority are not keen on the atheism demanded by the PKI (Partai Komunis Indonesia i.e. the Indonesian Communist Party), and as Sukarno’s ambitious adversaries in the government and the military know, aligning with communism is risky during the Cold War.\n\nBesides, the rhetoric of revolution belongs in another place and time. When the economy collapses and there is no rice to feed the people, Sukarno tells them to ‘plunder the capitalist bureaucrats’ but Kwan — who had hero-worshipped Sukarno — recognises what that means is that the poor plunder one another.\n\n‘Who’s a “capitalist bureaucrat”? The owner of a kerbside stall; or the smallest peasant. Plunder the small farmer! It’s the green light for the PKI, and a class struggle invented for the cities of nineteenth century Europe.’ (P.216)\n\nKwan is the moral core of the story. In company and in the privacy of his room, he expresses his profound dismay about the poverty that betrays the promise of independence. He understands Sukarno’s populist appeal, but he recognises his hero’s failure. Sukarno’s military background was no preparation for transition to an independent economy. While his ego expressed itself in Stalinist monuments and buildings to assert the importance of Jakarta as a world capital city, his people were starving. The trigger for Kwan’s disillusionment to morph into action, was the death of a little boy from a poor family that he had been supporting.\n\nThe symbolism of the wayang demonstrates Koch’s familiarity with his locale. The dustjacket author profile tells us that Koch…\n\n…had spent over ten years as a producer with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, working mainly in Sydney. He has also lived for extended periods in Europe and has travelled in Asia, visiting Indonesia on a number of occasions. He carried out a mission there for UNESCO in 1968, preparing a report that led towards the setting up of educational broadcasting in that country. He has since had a continuing interest in Javanese culture.\n\nThe Wayang puppet performances that have entertained generations of Indonesians, satirise current events even as they borrow from Indigenous myths, and retell stories from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana. Guy Hamilton, the journalist who relies on Kwan for his contacts, sees a performance…\n\nThe figures of India’s great Pandava story, transformed into weird cartoons, formally addressed each other, laughed and wept, prepared for battle in their chariots. Ogres who were coarse as Westerners ranted and broke wind, while the audience laughed derisively. Hamilton was introduced to the Wayang of the Right and the Wayang of the Left, who are in constant conflict.\n\nAs history tells us, that conflict erupted into a messy coup, followed by an anti-communist purge estimated to have taken the lives of 500,000 to one million people. The journalists scramble…\n\nWhile the novel focusses on a team of foreign journalists trying to decipher the enigma of Sukarno as a charismatic leader leading his country into political chaos, the 1982 film directed by Peter Weir, was tagged ‘A love caught in the fire of revolution’). It was more about the love triangle between the Australian journalist Guy Hamilton (Mel Gibson) and British Embassy officer Jill Bryant (Sigourney Weaver) and Billy Kwan, a Chinese-Australian photo-journalist with dwarfism (played by Linda Hunt). It was shot in the Philippines because both the film and the novel had been banned in Indonesia under Sukarno’s successor Suharto. Indonesians finally got to read the book and see the film after Suharto’s forced resignation in 1988.\n\nI have Koch’s book A Many-coloured Land, an Irish Memoir, but I don’t have a biography about him.

I haven’t been able to source her short story collection Not Her Real Name and Other Stories (1997), or The New Girl (2002) or The Forrests (2012) but on our 2019 trip to NZ for the Auckland LitFest, I found a second-hand copy of her debut novel Leave Before You Go (1998), and snapped it up.\n\nEmily Perkins will be a familiar name to readers of this blog because she won the most prestigious price for fiction at the 2024 Ockham New Zealand Book Awards for her novel Lioness (2023, see my review here.) I have also previously reviewed her third novel, Novel About My Wife (2008, see the review here, and check out the discussion with Gayle afterwards). It won the 2009 Montana Book Award for Fiction and the American Believer Book Award.\n\nWikipedia tells me that Carrie O’Grady, in a review of Novel about My Wife for The Guardian commented that Perkins ‘writes brilliantly about dismal people’, and I think that is just as true for Leave Before You Go. It features the same whip-smart dialogue for her flawed characters that is used to full effect in her later novels. This is the book description at Goodreads:\n\nLeave Before You Go is about Daniel, an average guy whose determination to escape the daily grind of London drives him to risk his life. Lured by a free trip and the promise of ten thousand dollars, Daniel boards a plane to pick up a “delivery” for an acquaintance. Shortly after his plane lands, he finds himself trafficking heroin from Thailand, penniless, and paranoid on the other side of the world.\n\nDaniel’s misadventures as a drug smuggler lead him into the netherworld of grungy hostels and casinos in New Zealand, where he wins – and loses – a fortune in one night. Reduced to petty thievery, he must beg, borrow, and steal in order to live from hand to mouth. His desperate searches for shelter and employment steer him in many directions, all of which seem to lead directly to Kate.\n\nKate works as a disgruntled usher in a cinema in Auckland, constantly drifting in the shadow of her more successful sister, Nina. As she wrestles with what to do with her life, she contends with some not-so-latent feelings for her ex-boyfriend, Frank. When Daniel arrives unexpectedly to stay with her best friends, Lucy and Josh, Kate suspects that she has seen him somewhere before.\n\nThat description makes it sound like a mystery, but though there are thriller-ish elements to Daniel’s abortive career as a drug-smuggler, there’s really no mystery about it. He is a loser who has the reader oscillating between disgust, disapproval, compassion and hope that there can be a way out for him (even though it would not be justice for what he’s done). The novel doesn’t make much of the heroin landing in Auckland and the harm it will do; the first part of the novel is more about Daniel’s discontent in London, and the way his so-called friend Richard manipulates him into doing the drug run with promises of a great holiday in Thailand and a generous payment on delivery in Auckland. None of it turns out to be as congenial as that, and it all falls apart when the delivery goes wrong, and he loses all the money he had gained at a casino.\n\nThis is where the reader’s reluctant compassion comes in: he’s alone in a strange city, with no money, no job, no work permit, not even an international driving licence. But he very soon draws on initiative not seen before to lie and cheat and steal and freeload from one end of NZ to the other. The characters he exploits are emblematic of the innocence (and maybe gullibility) of a small country far from anywhere. Crime, though it happens, happens somewhere else, mostly in the countryside.\n\nDangers in the cities of Auckland and Wellington, where everyone knows everyone else, are of a different sort. Anonymity is hard to achieve, and no escape seems possible from an intimacy you might not want.\n\nKate mulls this over when there’s a party where Lucy’s ex could well be there:\n\nJust as well they’re not going, thinks Kate as she’s getting dressed. Josh could easily be there. It’s one of the rules of living in a small place that the person you least want to see is the person you’re most likely to bump into. Any activity short of bolting yourself inside your home with the windows barred and the telephone off the hook is probably going to result in an encounter with your current nemesis, or, failing this, one of their envoys. A few months ago she called in sick to work and was then spotted by her boss’s daughter’s boyfriend, the one she insulted at last year’s Christmas party, flagging down a taxi with an armful of shopping bags. No, you had to stay indoors and keep your mouth shut. If you didn’t think much of someone’s new book or play or movie or single, you’d better think twice before being honest. She remembers a dreadful silence falling in a university tutorial as one of the students proceeded to criticise, in scathing undergraduate terms, a theatrical production that had, unbeknownst to the student, been directed by the lecturer’s wife.\n\nShe pours out too much moisturiser and wipes it over her neck, her hands and, in desperation, off onto the sleeves of her jumper. Another hazard of a small population, she thinks, is that if your appearance were blighted by an unsightly sore, it goes without saying that you will run into, under harsh fluorescent lighting or the broad midday sun, whoever it is that you have been desperately keen to avoid for the last six months. These conditions are part and parcel of living in a city inhabited by less than a million people.\n\nUnfortunately, what Kate forgets to do is remind Lucy. (p.245)\n\nPoor Lucy. She’s a good person who works in a women’s shelter, she’s generous and kind and wittily funny. She was my favourite character but the plot treats her unkindly, with ample justification for the tears that fall.\n\nI think we must have been lucky when we flew into Wellington in 2019. It was our first trip to NZ, so prior to the LitFest in Auckland, we did touristy things in Wellington, Palmerston North and Napier and then flew to Auckland, and the weather gods were kind almost the whole time. We did not experience the infamous winds that can make life in Wellington a misery:\n\nWind has been battering the city for four days solid. The air bites as if it’s coming straight off the South Pole. Nina clutches has shoulder bag to her ribs with one arm and hooks the other round a lamp-post to stop herself from blowing across the road. This is the good part about the wind, the sense of fragility it gives her, the breathless idea that she’s as delicate as a dandelion clock, that a sudden gust could pick her up and carry her right over a hilltop. Everything else about this weather drives her insane. The constant unrelenting rattle, the whine of it, the way it turns umbrellas inside-out and flicks grit and hair into your eyes. It sends plastic bags skidding around street corners to entangle your ankles and trip you up. It shakes the roof and walls of her house, it slaps rain about like hard sprays of paint, it churns up the harbour into a directionless mass of brown waves. It’s the worst thing about living in this city, worse even than the fault line the whole place is built on. Compared to the wind, the earth barely makes its presence known, only sending weekly tremors up through the foundations of the house to rattle a glass on the kitchen table, so slightly you might not even notice. (p.152)\n\nNina, BTW is the sister from hell. She is a Queen Bee, who’s been perfecting her craft on her hapless sister Kate since their school days. LOL I had this feeling when I came to Nina’s comeuppance towards the end of the novel, that maybe Emily Perkins was enjoying some literary payback! But no, of course not, it’s all fiction, eh?\n\nI loved this novel. It’s aged well even though it betrays its last-century publication date with the absence of now ubiquitous phones and toxic social media. Somehow it seems more real that Daniel can simply disappear and people can’t track each other down and that Nina, dear Nina, doesn’t need social media to wreak her spiteful havoc.\n\nI am waiting impatiently for Emily Perkins’ next novel. I have scoured her website for hints without success, and would welcome any news about what’s next.\n\nAuthor: Emily Perkins\n\nTitle: Leave Before You Go\n\nPublisher: Picador, 1998\n\nCover design: not acknowledged\n\nISBN: 9780330372046, pbk., 292 pages\n\nSource: Personal Library, purchased secondhand in 2019 from Bookmark, Devonport (an island within commuting distance of Auckland)\n\nTo discover other titles in #AYearofNZLit click the logo below."
