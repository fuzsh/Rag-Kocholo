While not all serve as undergraduate researcher mentors, many do, and you can use this tool to understand the depth and breadth of faculty research at Northeastern. Please consult the information on How-to-Identify and Work with a Faculty Mentor tab as well. You can search open research listings on the Research Opportunities page.\n\nFaculty who have expressed special interest in mentoring undergraduates have been highlighted with a Mentor badge.\n\nThose faculty who have previously mentored an award winner (UGRCE, PEAK Experiences Award, or prestigious fellowship) can be found by checking the box below."
