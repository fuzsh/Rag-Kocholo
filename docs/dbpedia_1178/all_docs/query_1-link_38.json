        "text": "70 High Gear Again\n\nThis issue arrives just as reunion speeches, handshakes and back slaps are in high gear, so I’ll save details for the winter. With COVID-19, plans changed a dozen times, but the University worked diligently to organize our reunion with the Class of 1971. If you would like to return in June, remember that we now belong to the 50-year Club and are invited to every reunion, not just the quinquennial celebrations. John Pedrotty MD practices family medicine in Coronado CA and assists at orthopedic surgery several times a week. He organized a joint 1970-71 Naval ROTC dinner at Legends. For thinclad memories Ole Bernt Skarstein served as unofficial track and field photographer. Some of his gems are featured in an article by Bill Constantini ’69 on the teams in the late 1960s (ND1970.blogspot.com). Another stalwart was Rick Wohlhuter ’71, who for a time held world records in 880-yard and 1,000-meter runs. Ed Ziegler is distinguished for his only competitive football kick, a winning field goal against the MSU freshmen in 1966. Pat and I celebrated our 12th grandchild, Eloise, born July 5 to Jen and Lou Graham ’08. Our wonderful class memorial, Reunion, along the St. Joseph River, has reached full funding. Thank you to donor Tim Collins, Media PA. It dovetails nicely with PBS-Michiana-WNIT’s documentary about the St. Joe, Then, Now and Always…The St. Joseph River Story, which was due in September. The historic importance of the river and its recent restoration make for enjoyable viewing. Congratulations to Greg Giczi, president and general manager of WNIT. He joined Zoom meetings every six weeks during the pandemic, organized by Bob Mitsch. Regular participants include Joe Cositore, a principal in the manufacture of an appliance that helps calm autistic children and adults. Pat Zika retired recently as a judge in Oakland CA and moved to the Southeast. Other retired classmates who joined the Zoom meetings are Rusty Weitzel from Kentucky, Jon Dwyer of Walnut Creek CA, and Pat Rice of Milwaukee. Hutch Schumaker of Columbus IN and Bonita Springs FL wins the kindness award for coming to a parking lot rescue of our Springfield friend Nancy Smith ’68SMC, widow of Michael E. Smith ’66. Space did not allow prior tributes to our deceased classmate Mac Smith, who died Feb. 3 in Sioux City IA after a distinguished legal career that began at age 10 when he accompanied his attorney father to work. He practiced labor law for decades, was inducted into the Northwest Iowa Labor Council of Fame and the Iowa Federation of Labor Hall of Fame, and ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1996. Two decades earlier, he chaired Congressman Berkly Bedell’s 1978 campaign. He is survived by two sons and wife Connie, whom he met as a Democratic Party volunteer in 1968. Frank Joseph (Joe) Murray died Jan. 18 in Buffalo Grove IL, survived by Linda, wife of 48 years, two children and six grandchildren. After his chemical engineering degree, he worked more than 30 years in the automotive industry including for Goodyear and Textileather. Tom Trankina died Dec. 5 near San Francisco. He worked for the Chicago Board of Options Trading and later as a printing broker until 2014. He volunteered with Al-Anon and loved golf. His son and two grandsons survive. Dick Salzbrenner died in Albuquerque on Nov. 16. He is survived by his wife, Becky, and three children. After his PhD in metallurgical engineering and postdoctoral work at MIT, he worked at Sandia National Laboratories until 2008. A soccer and exercise devotee, he succumbed to complications of Parkinson’s disease. Have a great winter. We will see you June 2-5 if you can make the 2022 reunion. — Don Graham; 1901 Glenwood; Springfield IL 62704; 217-652-1560; fever1@me.com\n\n70MBA Run Out of Gas?\n\nYour families have had a lot to think about over the past year and stopping to jot a note to me or Jim Slowinski for Notre Dame Magazine is easy to put aside for later. We have heard from only a handful of classmates over the past several quarters, and I am sure you get tired of our pleadings for content. I was going to write about my sister’s June 27 litter of eight Irish wolfhounds, but only a picture can do them justice. Puppies are not what these columns are supposed to be about. We should use this space to tell our classmates what is going on in our lives 50 years after graduating from Notre Dame. When I talk to classmates, I learn about their careers, children and grandchildren and life in well-earned retirement. There is always something to write for the column. The MBA Class of 1970 included individuals of high integrity and high ambitions who had great experiences before Notre Dame, including in the military. Can we pull together as a group and wave our flags at least once a quarter? Please feel free to text, email or call. — John Carroll; 4315 Alta Drive, Apt. 1301, Suwanee GA 30024 404-281-6524 johnrcarroll@outlook.com\n\n70JD Professor Schaffer’s Advice\n\nWith sadness I note that Paul Pollock passed away peacefully at his home in Woodbury CT on April 27. Born and raised on Long Island, he was a fellow Chaminade High grad who became a Double Domer. After graduating from ND in 1963, Paul joined the Navy. As a member of UDT/SEAL teams, he served two tours in Vietnam prior to starting law school. Thereafter he settled in Connecticut and became a highly respected defense attorney. The past few years, he struggled with a form of dementia and, upon his death, his brain was donated to the Mayo Clinic to assist in finding a cure for the disease. Paul is survived by his wife of more than 50 years, Cynthia, their five children (Amy, Jeremy, Rebecca, Amanda and Mark) and four grandchildren. Please remember Paul and his family in your prayers. Mike Crowe began his law studies with us, left after our first year and returned to graduate in 1972. He and his wife, Kathy, celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2019 with their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren all in attendance. Mike is retired from a small private practice in Canton NY that included a stint as the local municipal court judge. He wrapped up his career as county attorney for St. Lawrence County in NY’s north country. Mike says they settled in rural New York after taking Tom Schaffer ’61JD’s advice to consider being one of a small number of lawyers in a small town. Life has been good for them with several universities nearby, the beautiful four seasons (including winter at 30 below) and Ottawa a short drive away. Gerry Bambrick also commenced his legal studies with us but departed early to serve his country. Christmas 1970 found Gerry serving as an Army sergeant in Vietnam. Arriving back in the States in April 1971, he married a young lady by the name of Rita, whom he had dated while at ND. He returned to law school and, along with Mike Crowe, graduated in 1972. In June of this year Rita and Gerry’s son, Thomas, was ordained a Jesuit priest and, as I write these words, Father Tom is scheduled to preside over a Mass in celebration of their 50th wedding anniversary in August. Rita and Gerry have been blessed with three other sons and six grandchildren. Gerry retired in 2014 after years of practice in the Chicago area. Tom Digrazia writes that his career included representing Lakota tribal members in South Dakota; opening an office in Indiana with John Foran to represent Native Americans, migrant farm workers and juveniles; and providing legal assistance to remote Yupik villages in Alaska. Eventually, Tom settled in Hawaii. Dan Rybak appreciated the recent column that mentioned Grace Olivarez and said he always felt Grace was a truly exceptional human being. After being fully vaccinated, Marie and I began to venture out and visit with friends we had not seen during the pandemic. In April, a dinner with JoAnn and Mike Kelleher at their home in the Buffalo area included seeing their daughter, Shannon Bauer ’92, and her family. In May we met Judy and Joe Leahy in Washington DC. The Leahys had traveled from Oregon to spend time with their son, Andrew, and his family, and we were in town visiting with our son, John ’92, and his family. Carol and Terry O’Connor joined the four of us for lunch on the Georgetown waterfront, a toast to the ND Law Class of 1970 and lots of laughs. As Veteran’s Day approaches, hats off to Gerry Bambrick, Paul Pollock and all those in our class who served in the military. Until next time, stay well and Go Irish. — John K. Plumb; jkplumb37@gmail.com\n\n71 Tournament Returns\n\nThe 16th annual Hinga/Kelly golf tournament returned to the Juday Creek course in South Bend in June with a robust turnout. Golfers included Jim Wright, Gary Kos, Bill Schoen, and Mike Kelly. Hosts/sponsors were Bob Neidert and Bill Barz. Local attendees were John Gaski and Tim O’Connor. Chuck Nightingale of Valpo had the longest drive but outdrove his headlights and needed Craig Stark’s help locating the ball. Mike Cotter and Mike Morrison took a couple of days for a leisurely drive from Montana with a stop at the Navy training facility in north Chicago, where the younger seaman Cotter is an instructor. Morrison then headed to Cincinnati where Mary Ellen joined him for the wedding of one of Charley Blum’s boys. Dickie Johnson, Mike Kondrla and Tom Sinnott drove from New Jersey, toured campus and passed on golf, but kibitzed on basketball with Collis Jones and Jack Samar, both from DC. Phil Parenti and Ed Grenda came from the desert, Phil from Las Vegas, and Ed from Arizona. Tim DiPiero took a break from his over-70 basketball league to drive from West Virginia and sink the longest putt. Condolences to Joe Kubinski, Detroit, on the loss of his brother John ’73. Mark David Jones, a native of Peru IN and a resident of Alpena MI, passed away in April. He combined his professional skills as a long-time architect and enthusiasm for the outdoors by designing and building the family home on the shores of Lake Huron. Condolences to Jim McGraw, Cincinnati, and his family on the passing of Anne in February after a battle with cancer. From Ray Klein in Glen Ellyn IL: fellow parishioner and classmate Bob Galgan lost his wife, Darlene, in July. Patrick Shuler of Duarte CA passed away in May. He was a native of Joliet IL, lived in the Flanner tower, was a chemical engineering major and had a PhD from the U of Colorado. Patrick was retired from a chemical engineering firm he co-founded with partners and is survived by his wife, Nancy. Dave Riley checked in from Dayton, where he still works part time in his psychotherapy practice. Senior softball provides an opportunity for outdoor activity. No reunion in June? No problem. Keep the hotel reservations, use the airline tickets and head to campus anyway, as did these classmates from the East Coast: Pete Hartney, Bob Broderick, Joe St. Onge and trip planner Tom Morton. From the West Coast came Terry Lee and from the Midwest came Joe Bachewicz of Chicago, Al Gabriele of Valpo and Tom McCalley and Frank Caito of Indianapolis. Golf and dinners at Sunny Italy and Tippecanoe Place afforded downtime to visit and catch up. Mike Gearen, Honolulu, had the sad duty of passing on the word that his four-year roommate, Tyler Lantzy, was killed in an auto accident in Arizona in June. A serial entrepreneur before the term was coined, Tyler started and ran numerous businesses during his career. He learned to work remotely early on, moving a mail order business he founded from Milwaukee to Boulder in 1975 to enjoy the outdoors. A native of Spangler in western Pennsylvania, Tyler is survived by his wife, Terre, their two sons and their families. Rev. Robert J. Nogosek, CSC ’53, passed away in July at Holy Cross House on campus. He was a theology professor from 1968 to 1973. Bob Bullard was cleaning out some old files and sent on some photos from earlier reunions. Fortunately, I am technologically obsolete and unable to attach them. Weather permitting, we will be tailgating on our back patio for the remainder of the season. Georgia Tech on Nov. 20 could be interesting. Happy Thanksgiving, and safe travels if you are on the road. — John Snider; 830 N.

The following have confirmed that they will attend: Dick Denecker, John Halloran, Todd Helmeke, Les Larsen, Robin Pfeil, Rich Sosin, Rod Spear, Tony Strati, Jack Sullivan, John Vaughan, Terry Walts and yours truly, Jim Fackelman. Here is news from classmates we have not heard from in many years. Doug Sinclair has moved around in the US and Canada and has retired in Atlanta. He and Moyra will celebrate their 50th anniversary this fall. Maria (Acacio) Unemori retired in Hawaii after spending her last 20 years running her own business. Efrain Palaez wanted to attend our reunion but was unable to get his visa approved in time. He still lives in the Philippines, has a home in Madrid and invites visitors to either location. Steve Pandolfo has been retired for eight years and lives “down the shore” in New Jersey. — Jim Fackelman; 4635 Lakeview Circle, Slinger WI 53086; res 262-644-6245; cell 414-379-0968; jfackelman@alumni.nd.edu\n\n71JD Class Secretary — E.

After graduation, John went to work for the Australian subsidiary of Ford Motor Co. in Melbourne. A year later he married Ruth Buchbinder and in 1975 they moved to Perth, where John joined Curtin U Business School as a lecturer in international business and strategy. In 2000, John was employed by Murdoch U to develop and head up a new MBA program in international business that attracted students from the US, Europe and Asia, as well as Australia. These students studied Chinese language, economy and culture and were placed with a company in Shanghai to complete a project and report on such topics as the introduction of credit cards in a Communist market. The program included a significant number of CEOs and senior execs, which provided excellent networking opportunities for students, faculty and the university in general. John retired in 2010 to spend time with his family and to participate in running his family’s investment company. He mentioned that over the years he has been visited by Rainer Franz and Jim O’Sullivan ’73MBA and he saw Olivier and John Fonseca in Paris years ago. John also remarked that he looks forward to reading the Notre Dame Magazine but would like to see more news from all of you, as would I. I believe there are a lot of interesting career stories like John’s out there. Please take a few minutes to share yours with all of us. God bless. — Alex McLellan; 913-991-0944; irish72mba@gmail.com\n\n72JD Class Secretary — Chris Schraff;\n\n1881 Marble Cliff Crossing Court, Columbus OH 43204; 614-227-2097; cschraff@porterwright.com\n\n73 Greetings from Japan\n\nAs we write this, Jim Moynihan sends his greetings from Japan. He planned to return to the US on Aug. 31. Jim has lived in Japan for nearly 30 years. He met his bride, Hirokosama, in Japan. Jim joined the FBI as a special agent/attorney, served in that capacity for 25 years and was responsible for investigative matters in Japan, Taiwan and the Republic of Korea. Jim founded the ND Club of Japan and was formerly on the Alumni Board. Jim reports on fellow classmates Mike Creaney and Pat Stenberge. They are threatening to do a reenactment of the two-point conversion pass-fake, genuflect block and catch play in the end zone from the Purdue game in the rain 50 years ago. Jim also informed me that Mike Marut has done numerous overseas tours at various embassies. He was in Japan and now lives in northern Virginia. I am sorry to report the recent passing of Mike Nolan. Mike lived in Sylvania OH and is survived by five children. Mike Casale also reported on the recent passing of his four-year Grace tower roommate Vic Billings. Attending Vic’s funeral Mass were Jim O’Malley, Ray Popeck, Robbie Mitchelotti, Scott Gleason and Jim Musuraca. I enjoyed a golf trip to Alabama in May with my roommate, Alan Hart, and Mike McCurdy. Mike and Jane were married right after graduation. Are they the oldest Notre Dame-Saint Mary’s married couple in our class? I am looking for news. Everyone should now have time to send me something. — Michael W. Hansen; 3013 Sanctuary Court, Joliet IL 60435; mikehansen@mikehansenlaw.com\n\n73MBA Let’s Communicate\n\nGene Schrader shares that he saw the pretty scant updates in this past issue. He was typing this as the first tropical storm of the season was rolling through. He and Ellen are heading out to the state of Washington for her son’s (his stepson’s) Navy retirement ceremony. Kingsley is retiring after 32 years in the submarine corps as a master chief E-9. It is hard to believe the kids are retiring before he does. They are still enjoying the southeast coast, just outside Hilton Head SC and Savannah GA. They had limited their travel plans due to the virus. However, he was planning on meeting his four sisters on Aug. 25 to mark what would have been their mom’s 100th birthday. All siblings are still living and will be going to an Atlantic City casino to mark the date. The hotel where they were staying was a favorite of their mother. They are slowly seeing the family gravitating back closer to their New Jersey roots. All kids and grandkids were at one time in California. Now they have one in DC, one in Florida, and some moving soon to Chicago. The Navy guy is still out west but thinking about moving east eventually. Mary Lu and Michael Gormley were on a road trip a few weeks back and they managed to meet them in Savannah for a day or two. It was nice to catch up after a long absence. John Rapa writes that his first year with Intuit (TurboTax) is complete. He says Intuit is a very generous company. He will be back with them next tax season. He thoroughly enjoys working from his home office. In the interim, there is plenty of yard work. Gus Browne says all is well in Kankakee IL. No international travel is planned yet due to COVID air restrictions on international flights. He planned to enjoy summer and take a Route 66 road trip in August to Albuquerque and Santa Fe NM. My eldest grandchild, Victoria, graduated from STEM Academy High School in May with an outdoor ceremony on the athletic field and private parent-student prom. Now she is off to college. As you read this article, our class is less than two years away from our 50th anniversary of graduation. I would like to make it memorable for all of us. Please send me your legacy comments for publication in the issues of Notre Dame Magazine for 2022-23. Celebrate our class spirit by having all classmates respond and share stories and new email addresses with us. You are always welcome to contact us when in Southern California. If you have not corresponded in some time, please take the time now to share your experiences with your classmates. — Thomas Jindra; 7179 Alviso Ave., Riverside CA 92509; res and fax 951-685-2091; tajindra@charter.net\n\n73JD Time Flies\n\nIt seems like I just submitted an item for publication. Pam Sayad and Mary Martha McNamara provided an obit for Bill Elliot which, because Bill was, to my mind, one of the more memorable members of our class, I am passing on pretty much verbatim. He passed away in his hometown of Salinas CA on Feb. 18 from health issues that he had battled for years. Pam and Bill attended UC Berkeley before being part of the California contingent that was recruited to ND Law by Dean Bill Lawless ’44JD and Dean Thomas Schaffer ’61JD. Upon arrival at the Law School, Bill proudly made known to everyone that he was from California and was giving the Midwest an opportunity to impress him despite the bitter cold winters. He can be remembered for many things, such as crashing private parties in evening wear, outrageous costumes at Halloween parties, wonderful food, foul language and so much more. Perhaps his most classic was “interpretative dancing” on the floor during the Law Ball the year we graduated. Immediately after graduation, Pam and Bill headed to Washington DC. Bill served with the Justice Department and Pam was an assistant US Attorney. During his stint at DOJ, he was assigned to the Carter White House for his expertise in Executive Privilege Law. By then, Mary Martha McNamara had returned to DC from Portland OR and Bill invited her to join him and some DOJ friends for drinks and dinner. She recalls vividly pulling up to the White House gate on Pennsylvania Avenue in her old Volvo, giving her name to the guards, and the barrier being lowered to permit her to drive up the horseshoe driveway that you see every night on the news. Bill came out the White House doors and jumped into the waiting car as if he resided there. Ultimately, Bill returned to Southern California and Pam returned to San Francisco. Bill will be remembered for his great wit and sense of humor as well as a keen legal mind. Pam continues to have an active employment law practice in San Francisco with her all-female law firm of Sayad & Biren. She also passed along a recent article from the San Francisco Chronicle regarding the fight to open the membership of the Olympic Club to women. She spearheaded the successful effort with the result that 30 years later it was the site of the US Women’s Open for the first time. — Paul Reagan; 16527 Heron Coach Way, Ft Myers FL 33908; cell 847-915-9796; pvreagan@gmail.com\n\n74 Autumn Review\n\nI always must remind myself that the column is written well in advance of publication so details on many news items may not be current. Please keep that in mind. Mark Shellenbarger and his wife, Melanie ’75SMC, used pandemic time to write the book, Forever Wild, Forever Home. It is a story of The Wild Animal Sanctuary in Colorado where they work as volunteers. The proceeds from the book will benefit the efforts of the sanctuary to rescue large carnivores and other animals from around the world. And while many may tire of the endless POG tidings, others get the biggest laugh, especially those who know these men. The 38th Destin FL POG Mo Thon highlights include Bob Cimino (Meatball) thinking his nickname would never stick, Jim Cahill (Chill) with the first POG hole-in-one, and the ART of the 21 POG victory speech at Regatta Bay’s veranda, which drew cheers from all nearby. Tom Ross (Big T) won rookie of the year. It seems Big T started his morning with four beers followed by a six pack. Tom told me separately that he could only spend two nights but got his money’s worth with the boys. Next year he promises to stay the entire time. He and his wife, Jan, also drove 6,000 miles in 19 days to visit friends, sons, wives, sisters, you name it. It was a “post-COVID we-are-all-vaccinated trip to reunite with all.” Back to POG: beach day with Steve Rogers (Buck), Bob Hettinger (Hett) and Jim McCarthy (Phantom). The others had to endure their endless pontifications and repetitious babble. Jim Whalen (Whales), Bob Cimino and Tom Torretti soundly beat Dr. Pat McGrath (Pinko), Jim Cahill and Tom Jenkins in the “greatest golf match in POG history.” Tim McCarron (Tuber) had the best consecutive rounds in POG history. All were thrilled seeing the POG trophy after a long absence thanks to Frank Murnane. Wine was abundant at POG and when my friends came to visit in July. The COVID Cocktail Club (CCC) and Bond girls (Carol Longo Kaupp, Dianne Gibbons Borzyske ’74SMC, Natalie Dwyer Haller ’74SMC and myself) enjoyed copious amounts of wine, laughter and the sights of Chicago during our mini reunion. Other members of the CCC, including Jill Fahey Birkett ’74SMC, weren’t able to attend. Bobbie Riconoscuito ’74SMC, also a CCC member, attended a fun gathering hosted by Jackie Schmizzi Elhert ’74SMC that same week. Joseph A. Cari Jr. was appointed to the board of directors of Westlake Energy Group, a Netherlands company focused on alternative energy solutions with lithium batteries. Joe is a new grandfather to Lucia Soboroff, hopefully ND Class of 2042. If COVID did one thing, it made us reflect and reprioritize what is important to us: family and friends. To that end, my children and their spouses and my six beautiful grandchildren are even more precious to me. I began a new career as a business performance advisor for Insperity. Crazy? Maybe. However, I enjoy the energy of the business world. Since my territory is the USA, if you know of any small- and medium-sized business owners who need HR solutions, let me know. I would love to help them succeed. And please keep writing. In the subject line, please write Class of 1974. — Dede Lohle Simon; domerdede@aol.com; dedeRsimon@gmail.com\n\n74MBA Odds and Ends\n\nSandy Gerling Polselli writes that in June she had breakfast at the Morris Inn with Betty Gallagher. Wayne LeSage sent along some information on how he and wife, Cathy, celebrated the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays with their family in these COVID times. Wayne also mentioned that his father is 93 and lives in Massachusetts. Wayne was planning to visit him in May for the first time in 18 months. In June, Randy Marks and Charlie Lanktree reportedly met for breakfast in Florida. Charlie and wife Donna reside in New Jersey and own a residence in Hammock Bay FL. Randy and wife Sandy live year-round in Sarasota. Randy never mentioned what he and Charlie discussed, but rumor has it that they each brought along copies of their old MBA case studies and were discussing and updating the old recommendations based on their career experiences in marketing. As I write this, Helen and I are preparing for our annual family vacation in Garden City Beach SC, near Myrtle Beach. We again rented a large house on the beach. This year there will be only 17 of us to share the beach, pool and sunshine because two of our children and their families will not be able to attend. As always, I hope this column finds everyone healthy and happy. Send me info on what is going on in your lives. Your MBA classmates would enjoy hearing about you. — Jack Burnett; 19248 Glen Eagles Drive, Livonia MI 48152; 734-464-3458; jburnet1@sbcglobal.net\n\n74JD Nada\n\nI haven’t heard anything. Be well and stay safe. — Joe O’Reilly;\n\ncell 502-649-6955; joe.oreilly34@icloud.com\n\n75 Bob on the Go\n\nBob Johnson writes from Kansas that after 33 years working in the small air pollution control industry in Kansas City, he began running his father’s business in Connecticut, designing and building oxygen generator systems for the Navy submarine fleet. He’s a commuter and enjoys it. He and wife Joann have been married since 1979 and have three adult children of whom he is quite proud. He would enjoy hearing from fellow Stanford Hall alumni via email at re.john75@gmail.com. Jim Lewis reports from Pennsylvania that his wife is retiring from being a school principal and they are planning some vacation time with her college friends. Mike Kemp has been named head football coach at Erie Community College in Buffalo NY. Kemp has been an assistant coach at ECC since 2018. We had no luck this summer as the second attempt at a 45th reunion was cancelled due to COVID. But the class officers created a fun forum for us to get together June 4 via Zoom. Classmate and renowned vintner Paul Hobbs hosted a virtual wine tasting event while 40 Domers sipped his chardonnay, pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon. Paul grew up on an apple farm in New York, majored in chemistry at ND, declined med school and got a master’s degree in oenology (the science of winemaking) from UC-Davis. An admitted wine purist, Paul now has wineries across the US and the world. He welcomes all classmates to a real wine tasting at the Paul Hobbs Winery in Sebastopol CA. Thanks, Paul, for your special efforts to joyfully reconnect the Class of 1975. We can plan other Zoom mini reunions between now and 2025. Contact the class officers with ideas. On a related note, the Alumni Association is planning reunion activities at upcoming home football games for the classes who missed theirs in 2020 and 2021. NDAA will be messaging us about these events. watch our web, Facebook and email media. Be sure you are registered with NDAA at my.nd.edu. Please pray for John Banas Jr. MD from Williamsville NY, who passed away on Jan. 12. He is survived by two children and his wife, Joan. On June 28, classmate Frank Keres of Lake Bluff IL passed away. He is survived by his wife, Cathe. I had bypass surgery on April 27 and had a fairly easy recovery, thanks to good docs, friends, family and a very helpful wife, Linda. Please continue to send me your news.

Lardy. Ross has three degrees from the U of Alabama and is pursuing dual JD/MBA degrees at du Lac. As the decades roll by, the generational shift becomes more pronounced. To wit, Michael B. Mattingly ’12JD was elected to the NDLA Board in recent weeks. The son of Beth and Paul Mattingly, Mike served combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan as a platoon leader and company commander in the 101st Airborne Division. In another time and place (1970-71, Vietnam), Chuck Garbett also served in the “Screaming Eagles.” These days Chuck maintains a practice at LGKG (Luxenberg Garbett Kelly George) in New Castle PA, but more and more he is doing less and less. The firm specializes in civil litigation, principally auto accidents, workers’ compensation, medical malpractice and nursing home neglect. Chuck and Carol spend most of the year in Florida and are planning to build a home in Englewood FL, just south of Venice on the Gulf Coast. They keep busy with their seven grandchildren scattered throughout Massachusetts, just outside of Philadelphia, and Chattanooga. When not chasing the grandkids, Chuck and Carol can be found on a golf course or a pickleball court. From his home in Vermont, Warren Casey reports that he is still a full-time practitioner of corporate and securities law and represents private foundations and nonprofit organizations. He has been with the same East Coast law firm (Day Pitney) for 44 years. With the pandemic, he and his wife, Andra, relocated from New Jersey to their home in Pittsfield, about 10 miles from Killington, where they have been season pass holders for 25 years. They spend considerable time with their six (soon to be seven) grandchildren who are spread across four coastal states. They also spend time in State College PA, where one of their daughters played volleyball at Penn State. Warren confesses to being a huge Nittany Lions fan, something for which the Lord’s forgiveness will not be automatic. They stay physically active and, having learned to swim many years back, Warren satisfied a longtime dream by competing in two Ironman Triathlons in Wisconsin in his mid-50s. Weekends are spent gardening and planting and, in those endeavors, Warren confesses to being second in command, relegating him to digging and weeding. In 1990, Hannah Callaghan and Bob Weaver stumbled upon an architectural treasure in Portland known as the Nun’s House, named for an earlier transfer of the structure and contents to the Sisters of the Holy Name. When the house came back onto the market, Hannah and Bob spotted the potential and purchased it. Their sensitive restoration was chronicled recently in a publication dedicated to old house revivals. Take a peek at the stunning structure at oldhouseonline.com/house-tours/tudor-revival-mix/. Hannah retired after completing 42 years as a legal aid attorney and, most recently, as enforcement director of the Fair Housing Council of Oregon. Bob hopes to wrap up his practice later this year. Keep Phil Morse in your thoughts and prayers as he goes through a second round of chemotherapy. Stay strong, Phil. As for me, it has been a quarter century since my quadruple cardiac bypass surgery. Karen and I celebrated with a trip to Denver to see Paxton Giel, our newest grandchild and future Domer. Following the surgery in 1996, I worried about latent complications, pain management, quality of life issues and additional surgical interventions. Fortunately, it has been smooth sailing for 25 years.

Our 45th reunion has shifted to an October mini reunion, and the changing of the guard in class leadership is under way. Outgoing president Bob Quakenbush ended his tenure with an executive order declaring June 10 “Debi Dell Day,” in honor of her birthday. Time will tell whether returning president Debi rescinds this order. The Class of ’76 is grateful to Bob for his dedication through challenging times, and his continued commitment to serve as director of special communications. Also elected: Mark Nishan as VP, Steve Klug as treasurer, and Shelley Muller Simon as secretary. Frank Fransioli continues in the roles of webmaster and special projects. We are grateful to Mary Anne Kennedy Reilly for her 10 years of service as secretary. She earned praise from Bob: “She never missed a deadline for ND Magazine and was always able to find and include interesting news from classmates near and far.” Sadly, we sent our condolences to her in May for the untimely death of her husband, Ross Roeder, from injuries sustained in an automobile accident. I attended the funeral with classmates Betsy Kall Brosnan, Augie Grace, Maryanne Ries Rogers, and Rose and Paul Reilly. Betsy was featured in the Mendoza College of Business’ Make Your Mark personal essays. She reflected on her career and three themes: ethical thinking, volunteerism and relationships (especially those begun at ND). It is available online and is well worth the read. Augie is the new Florida Regional Director on the NDSA Board, joining Maryanne, who is Northeast Regional Director. We lost classmate Fred Rodgers in February. He lived in Westlake OH and was known as “a world traveler, master tailgater and king of the slopes.” Our condolences to wife Noreen and their family. Dan Adler welcomed his fifth grandchild, Iris, in February, declaring he is now ready for grandpa’s basketball team. Kelly Simon ’08, ’15Washington U, daughter of Shelley and Craig Simon ’74, was named legal director of ACLU of Oregon, following two years as interim director. An EF3 tornado touched down in Naperville IL, damaging the homes of Sally Naxera Benson and Bill Kelly, who live on adjacent streets. Luckily, both are safe. Sally is organizing a class block for the ND-Wisconsin game at Soldier Field. Due to utility construction, the University has temporarily removed the Class of ’76 Butterfly Garden. Thanks to the negotiation skills of Frank Fransioli and Lynda and Pat Sarb, it will be restored and enlarged in time for our October mini reunion. The Sarbs celebrated their own SARBotanical Gardens relocation to their new home in Elkhart IN with a July open house. In attendance were: Denise Crowley Brenner with husband Dave ’73, and Deb and Mark Witkowski. Pat will be retiring in August from Allstate’s corporate real estate department in Northbrook IL. Debi Dell spent the past 15 months rewriting a book started 20 years ago about our ND coeducation experience. After incorporating feedback from hundreds of classmates, she hired an editor and discovered she had enough material for three books. Watch for the first book, Objects in the Rearview Mirror, to be published in time for the 50th anniversary of coeducation. Joe McQuighan reported on his efforts as associate professor of cybersecurity, networking and digital forensics at Towson U in Maryland. He founded the IEEE R2 Collegiate Brain-to-Computer Competition in 2018 and trains students to compete in events such as brain-drone races and brainwave-controlled computer games.

He is at peace after a battle with heart issues. After graduation from Providence College, Jim joined Ernst & Young as an accountant before attending Notre Dame, where he earned his MBA and his CPA designation. At Notre Dame, he met classmate Virginia Conlisk, who became his wife of 44 years. She survives him, along with their son, Daniel James, and two beloved cats, Sigmund and Guinness. Mike Hogan attended the funeral and shared many Notre Dame stories with family and friends. Also, I received kind and comforting tributes honoring Jim’s many talents and great character for which we are grateful. Jim would have been proud that three of his nieces, including Sarah Werner Westhoven ’11MBA served as pallbearers. This was a wonderful tribute to their uncle, who though understated in his manner, was their strong advocate as voiced in letters of recommendation written for each of them for their college or graduate school applications. Willis (“Snoopy”) Smith reports that he and Alta celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary on June 3 with their family in Centralia WA. “It has been a wonderful time spending our lives together, with highs and lows through the years but always with gratitude and love for each other.” Sheryl and Larry Overlan “The Chairman” just returned from a week in the Northwest Territory. They began with paying respects to Honest Abe in Springfield IL at a magnificent monument for Lincoln’s final resting place. Next, they went to the site of the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe in Indiana where future president William Henry Harrison earned his nickname. Indiana soon thereafter became a state (1816) enabling Notre Dame to be founded in 1842. After a few days in South Bend, they went to Fairmont IN to see the home and museum of actor James Dean (1931-1955). Traveling east to Ohio, they ate some delicious Michigan peaches and visited the home of President Rutherford B. Hayes (1877-81) and inventor Thomas Edison. Larry highly recommends all these sites to us to visit. My lovely wife, Lynn (Linda Lombardi ’70SMC), and I celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary on July 3. I thank God for putting her in my life; we have enjoyed our togetherness over the years. We thank our two daughters and their husbands for being who they are and giving us our three grandchildren. Blessings to you and your loved ones. Keep up the good work sending news. — Mike Norris; cell and text 248-330-5366; norris1021@comcast.net\n\n76JD Passionate Support for His Alma Mater\n\nMichael Oscar Renda, 70, died June 28 of cancer at Morrison Medical Center in Morrison NJ. He was born in New Brunswick NJ and grew up in Green Brook NJ. Michael graduated from Rutgers Preparatory School and earned two degrees at ND: a BS in civil engineering in 1972, and a JD summa cum laude in 1976. He was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1976 and was a founding partner of the law firm Waldman, Renda & McKinney in Hawthorne, where he practiced business and construction law for the past 42 years. He served as a mediator for the New Jersey Courts, as well as a mediator and arbitrator for the American Arbitration Association. Michael was a member of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Whitehouse Station, the Utility and Transportation Contractors Association of New Jersey, the Hunterdon Italian American Club, the New Jersey State Bar Association and the Metedeconk River Yacht Club in Brick NJ. He loved fishing and boating, vegetable gardening, cooking, making fresh mozzarella and making and drinking fine wine. He was an avid fan of Notre Dame football and passionately supported his alma mater. Most of all, he loved every minute he was able to spend with his beloved family. Michael is survived by his loving wife of 45 years, Barbara, their three children, Antonia, Michael and Michelle, and grandsons Michael and Malcolm. — Virgil L.

My daughter will be graduating from Sarah Lawrence College in New York next spring.” Congratulations to Randall Velzen, who recently received the Michigan Lawyers Weekly’s Hall of Fame Award. “This special award recognizes esteemed members of the legal profession who have been in practice for at least 30 years. These lawyers truly are legends, making their mark in the courtroom or the boardroom, in their firms and with community organizations, and with local, state and national bar associations. With their guidance and mentorship, they have launched hundreds of thriving legal careers and have left an indelible imprint on the profession.” Edwin Basl shared this news: “After 12 years in the Washoe County District Attorney’s Office in Reno NV and 31 years in a solo private practice here, I decided the practice of law was for the younger generation and moved on to being my wife’s personal travel agent where I get to tag along. We returned to Hawaii to celebrate our 40th anniversary in April. The two kids and two grandkids are doing well. Now that we are fully vaccinated and returning to world travel, we plan to visit Europe, Asia, the South Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand when they become available.” Jim Donathen says that after 43 years of practice, mostly as a management side labor and employment lawyer at Phillips Lytle LLP in Buffalo NY, he has retired from full-time practice. “My retirement plans include splitting time between Buffalo and Lakewood Ranch FL, continuing to counsel some key clients, mediation work, picking up the trombone again and hopefully getting my handicap below 20.
