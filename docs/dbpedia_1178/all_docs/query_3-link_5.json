        "text": "There is a silent invasion taking place in Australia that could fundamentally alter our way of life.\n\nThis isn’t a tagline for a movie – people living in the southern United States have been tormented by these tiny invaders for decades. They are a real and present danger to the way we live our lives. The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, is in Australia.\n\nMainland invasion\n\nFire ants, natives of South America, are capable of infesting almost the entire Australian continent – making them a very real national problem.\n\nClimate mapping shows they can live everywhere that humans live, work or farm.\n\nThe map below reveals just how much of Australia is vulnerable to fire ant invasion. Any area covered in yellow through to red (5-10) could be colonised by fire ants if they are not eradicated. As you can see every mainland capital city and major rural town is open to fire ant invasion.\n\nWe need to build public awareness of this huge threat and plan to bring out a fire ant expert from the US early next year to warn Australians of the nightmare that would take over our country if fire ants are not eradicated.\n\nThere are three things you can do to make this a reality:\n\n1. Donate and support the fire ant tour >>\n\n2. Sign the fire ant eradication petition >>\n\n3. Sign-up for a fire ant event in your state >>\n\nThe problem\n\nFire ant venom is potent, particularly to sensitive human skin. Swarming their victims fire ant stings can lead to anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction that has resulted in the death of 85 people in the US alone. Venom victims develop pustules on their skin that can remain for several days. These ants are a serious environmental and public health issue.\n\nRed fire ants attack wildlife and cattle, inflicting serious injury. They are deadly to young, weak and sick creatures. Their nests displace or eliminate lizards, frogs, birds and mammals.\n\nRed fire ants are ruled by highly mobile queens that can fly high into the air to establish new nests up to two kilometres away. Once fire ants have breached a new territory their queens can rapidly expand the number of nests, creating dense populations and dominating the surrounding area.\n\nAlthough fire ants primarily nest in open, outdoor spaces nests have been found beneath buildings, pathways and roads, damaging the integrity of surface structures. Once they have taken over an outdoor area, such as sporting fields or school grounds, recreational activities can come to a standstill.\n\nIn the US the impacts of fire ants have been costed at $7 billion a year. In Queensland, ground zero for Australia’s fire ant infestation, the damage bill if we do not eradicate fire ants has been put at $45 billion over 30 years.\n\nFor such a small invader, fire ants have significant economic, health and environmental impacts.\n\nThe solution\n\nSo far their main route into Australia has been through major trading ports, first catching the attention of authorities in 2001 when they were identified in the Brisbane suburb of Wacol. It’s thought they arrived via Brisbane port. Since then they have been found twice at Gladstone in Central Queensland, and once at Sydney’s Port Botany just two years ago.\n\nState and federal governments have spent more than $320 million trying to control and eradicate Australia’s fire ant infestations. Eradication is close to complete at Gladstone and Port Botany. However, the large infestation between Brisbane and the NSW border remains a major headache for authorities, and may prove more difficult to control if it spreads deeper into the Brisbane hinterlands and into northern NSW.\n\nThe Queensland eradication program has suffered from insufficient and uncertain funding as well as arguments over how best to achieve eliminate the fire ant threat.\n\nHowever, a recent review of the program concluded that eradication remains technically feasible and in the national interest. What is lacking is a commitment from all state and federal governments to fund the resources needed to get on with the job.\n\nThe decision\n\nEarly next year Australia’s agricultural ministers will consider fully funding the eradication of red fire ants. Queensland cannot tackle this problem alone, but with the backing of state and federal governments a fully funded eradication program will eliminate the fire ant threat.\n\nAs always, prevention through strong biosecurity protections at our country’s entry points is the quickest, cheapest way to stop dangerous new invasive species from entering Australia. Once they are here, as in the case of the fire ant, they must be dealt with quickly and with the full force of state and federal authorities.\n\nTake action\n\nAustralia faces a national emergency if federal and state funding of the country’s red fire ant eradication program is not fully funded.\n\nPlease join us in calling on federal and state governments around Australia to properly fund the red fire ant eradication program by signing our petition today!\n\n[button link=”https://www.change.org/p/barnaby-joyce-rid-australia-of-its-deadly-fire-ant-menace” size=”large”]Sign the petition[/button]\n\nDear Project Team,\n\n[YOUR PERSONALISED MESSAGE WILL APPEAR HERE.]\n\nI support the amendment to the Kosciuszko National Park Wild Horse Heritage Management Plan to allow our incredible National Parks staff to use aerial shooting as one method to rapidly reduce feral horse numbers. I want to see feral horse numbers urgently reduced in order to save the national park and our native wildlife that live there.\n\nThe current approach is not solving the problem. Feral horse numbers have rapidly increased in Kosciuszko National Park to around 18,000, a 30% jump in just the past 2 years. With the population so high, thousands of feral horses need to be removed annually to reduce numbers and stop our National Park becoming a horse paddock. Aerial shooting, undertaken humanely and safely by professionals using standard protocols, is the only way this can happen.\n\nThe government’s own management plan for feral horses states that ‘if undertaken in accordance with best practice, aerial shooting can have the lowest negative animal welfare impacts of all lethal control methods’.\n\nThis humane and effective practice is already used across Australia to manage hundreds of thousands of feral animals like horses, deer, pigs, and goats.\n\nTrapping and rehoming of feral horses has been used in Kosciuszko National Park for well over a decade but has consistently failed to reduce the population, has delayed meaningful action and is expensive. There are too many feral horses in the Alps and not enough demand for rehoming for it to be relied upon for the reduction of the population.\n\nFertility control as a management tool is only effective for a small, geographically isolated, and accessible population of feral horses where the management outcome sought is to maintain the population at its current size. It is not a viable option to reduce the large and growing feral horse population in the vast and rugged terrain of Kosciuszko National Park.\n\nFeral horses are trashing and trampling our sensitive alpine ecosystems and streams, causing the decline and extinction of native animals. The federal government’s Threatened Species Scientific Committee has stated that feral horses ‘may be the crucial factor that causes final extinction’ for 12 alpine species.\n\nI recognise the sad reality that urgent and humane measures are necessary to urgently remove the horses or they will destroy the Snowies and the native wildlife that call the mountains home. I support a healthy national park where native species like the Corroboree Frog and Mountain Pygmy Possum can thrive."
