        "text": "Dr. Roche is the Principal Investigator of \"Pathways to Health / Caminos al Bienestar\" - a project comprised of two five-year studies (2017-22; 2021-26) funded by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. For a probability sample of Latin American-origin families living in a new immigrant destination, this study examines the cascading effects of immigration- and COVID-19-related adversities as well as neighborhood and school cultural demands and opportunities on parenting and parent-adolescent relationships and, in turn, adolescent adjustment. The sample includes 547 adolescents and, for half of them, their mothers. Participants are being followed over 13 time points from early adolescence through the transition to adulthood. This research uses multi-level and structural equation modeling techniques to examine direct and indirect pathways linking extra-familial contexts with Latina/o/x adolescent outcomes. Roche and her colleagues will be examining chronic and acute stress measured by salivary and hair cortisol to advance knowledge on biological stress processes experienced by today's U.S. Latino/a adolescents. The research team also is examining family, neighborhood, and youth protective factors that help mitigate risks. Findings will inform the development of preventive interventions and policies that can promote school success and healthy development for this population.\n\nDr. Roche also is the Multiple Principle Investigator (MPIs: Roche, Caughy, Calzada) of \"Societal stressors, adaptive factors, and developmental timing: Influences on Latinx mental health from early childhood through young adulthood.\" This five year R01 is funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, NIH (2024-2029). This project will use Integrated Data Analysis techniques to pool data from five existing Latinx longitudinal cohort studies to examine how societal stressors shape Latinx youth's internalizing symptoms from early childhood to young adulthood.\n\nRelated to this research, Dr. Roche's study examining impacts of recent immigration actions and news on the lives of US Latino parents has been featured in national media including the NBC Nightly News, US News & World Report, Vox.com, and WAMU 88.5. She and her colleagues are currently conducting a follow up study focused on adolescent children of Latino/a immigrant parents. You may follow her on Twitter @KRoche_GWU."
