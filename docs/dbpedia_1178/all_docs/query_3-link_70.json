        "text": "Research Interests\n\nTissue patterning and organ development depend on spatiotemporal control and coordination of cell proliferation, growth, and specialization, but how is this achieved? Across biological systems, cell-cell communication and cell polarity are considered fundamental to these developmental processes.\n\nUsing Arabidopsis as a model organism, my lab focuses on understanding the relationship between cell polarity and developmental events. We have identified a group of receptor kinases, POLARLY LOCALIZED KINASEs (PLKs), that polarize to different plasma membrane domains in root cells and function in development. Two of these polarized receptor kinases function to repress root cell divisions and organ size, directly linking lateral cell polarity with tissue patterning and organ size in the radial and longitudinal axes. We also find that contra-polarity of two PLKs is achieved through separate cellular mechanisms, shifting ideas about how plant protein polarity is achieved. We are working to characterize 5 more novel PLKs and next steps include connecting the PLKs to the regulatory networks that operate in cell division and fate specification. We expect our findings will reveal unique plant cell polarity domains along with details about their establishment and maintenance, identify novel PLK functions, and, ultimately, uncover mechanisms underlying repression of cell division with potential translational and therapeutic value.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nOscillating gene expression determines competence for periodic Arabidopsis root

Interests\n\nThe proper formation and function of an organ requires cells with distinct characteristics. However, cells from both animals and plants can be reprogrammed to ‘forget’ their original identity and acquire a new fate. Cell fate plasticity is particularly important in plants because it enables the production of new organs. Plant embryo formation produces only a rudimentary body consisting of a root, stem, and a few leaves. The body plan is elaborated post-embryonically by the exquisite branching of roots and shoots. Understanding organ neogenesis in plants has broad implications ranging from regeneration to agriculture and plant-based mitigation strategies for climate change.\n\nMy lab combines cutting edge genetic, genomic, and imaging approaches to investigate how distinct cell types and cell states contribute to elaboration of the plant body plan. Specifically, we want to understand 1) what specifies cell identity and 2) how a cell can change its fate or state in response to intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Our long-term goal is to understand how cell fate is programmed to initiate the formation of new tissues and organs in different developmental and environmental contexts.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nNolan TM and Shahan R (2023) Resolving plant development in space and time with single-cell genomics.

We utilize fruit fly genetics for discovery and then apply in vivo imaging, biophysical approaches, mass spectrometry, metabolomics and high throughput sequencing to explore function. We extend these findings into vertebrate models; one current focus is a turbocharger of mitochondrial energy production and its importance for immunology and the brain.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nAkhmanova, M., Emtenani, S., Krueger, D., Gyoergy, A., Guarda, M., Vlasov, M., Vlasov, F., Akopian, A., Ratheesh, A., De Renzis, S., Siekhaus, D.E.

These rare cells hold the promise of novel therapeutics for degenerative diseases for which there are currently no cures or even effective treatments. Many questions remain unanswered about how stem cell functions are regulated and how they are impacted by changes in the local and systemic environment during aging or in disease conditions. Using skeletal muscle and the resident muscle stem cells as a model system, our laboratory seeks to understand how stem cells function, how stem cells change with age, and how to restore youthful function to aged stem cells. We take a multi-omics approach to identify critical factors and pathways that regulate fundamental features and processes of muscle stem cells, including the maintenance of quiescence and self-renewal. We use gene editing approaches (CRISPR) both for screening and for specific genetic modifications to study stem cell function, and we develop genetically engineered mice for the purposes of cell labeling, lineage tracing, cell depletion, and bio-orthogonal chemistry. In addition to basic stem cell research, we have pre-clinical translational projects exploring mechanisms of disease progression and experimental therapeutics for muscular dystrophies, and tissue engineering approaches for functional restoration following muscle trauma.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nColville A, Liu J-Y, Rodriguez-Mateo C, Thomas S, Ishak HD, Zhou R, Klein JDD, Morgens DW, Goshayeshi A, Salvi JS, Yao D, Spees K, Dixon SJ, Rhee JW, Lai C, Wu JC, Bassik MC, Rando TA (2023) Death-seq identifies regulators of cell death and senolytic therapies.

Sustained calvarial bone growth relies on fibrous joints called sutures, which simultaneously act as a barrier between neighboring bones and a source of stem cells to grow bones. In a common congenital abnormality called craniosynostosis, sutures are lost and neighboring bones prematurely fuse, limiting brain growth. In the Farmer lab, we integrate multiple animal models (i.e. mice and zebrafish) with cutting edge genomic, genetic and imaging technologies to decipher the molecular and cellular basis of calvaria development.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nTing MC, Farmer DT, Teng CS, Crump JG. 2021.

Variation in these processes allows mammals to adapt to changing environments, but also generates congenital malformations in humans. Developmental variation therefore presents a unifying concept for evolutionary biology and biomedicine, whose understanding is critical to the success of both fields. My primary research goals are to determine how developmental variation interacts with environmental factors within a species to produce congenital malformations in humans, and among species to generate new evolutionary adaptations in mammals. To pursue these goals, I characterize developmental variation across biological scales, and interpret how this variation drives evolution and malformations in form. I incorporate data from fields from paleontology to mathematics to genomics to developmental biology. I also study multiple model and non-model mammals (e.g., mouse, bat, cat, deer, horse, pig, opossum). I use this approach to investigate three major topics: mammalian limb evolution and development, major evolutionary transformations during mammalian evolution, and mammalian sensory system evolution.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nYohe LR, Davies KTJ, Simmons NB, Sears KE, Dumont ER, Rossiter SJ, Dávalos LM, \"Evaluating the performance of targeted sequence capture, RNA-Seq, and degenerate-primer PCR cloning for sequencing the largest mammalian multigene family\", Molecular ecology resources, - (2019) .\n\nKelly, E., Marcot, J., Selwood, L., Sears, K.E., \"The development of integration in marsupial and placental limbs\", Integrative Organismal Biology, - (2019) [link].\n\nHedrick, B.P., Mutumi, G.L., Munteanu, V.D., Sadier, A., Davies, K.T.J., Rossiter, S.J., Sears, K.E., Davalos, L.M., Dumont, E.R., \"Morphological diversification under high integration in a hyper-diverse mammal clade\", Journal of Mammalian Evolution, - (2019) [link].\n\nCooper LN, Sears KE, Armfield BA, Kala B, Hubler M, Thewissen JGM, \"Review and experimental evaluation of the embryonic development and evolutionary history of flipper development and hyperphalangy in dolphins (Cetacea: Mammalia)\", Genesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000), 56 (1): - (2018) .\n\nTeeling, E., Vernes, S., Davalos, L.M., Ray, D.A., Gilbert, M.T.P., Myers, E., Bat1K Consortium (includes Sears, K.E.), \"Bat biology, genomes, and the Bat1K project: To generate chromosome-level genomes for all living bat species\", Annual Review of Animal Biosciences, 56 (1): 23-46 (2018) [link].\n\nSears, K.E., Maier, J.A., Sadier, A., Sorensen, D., Urban, D.J., \"Timing the developmental origins of mammalian limb diversity\", Genesis, 56 (1): - (2018) [link].\n\nSadier A, Davies KT, Yohe LR, Yun K, Donat P, Hedrick BP, Dumont ER, Dávalos LM, Rossiter SJ, Sears KE, \"Multifactorial processes underlie parallel opsin loss in neotropical bats\", eLife, 7 : - (2018) .\n\nYohe LR, Abubakar R, Giordano C, Dumont E, Sears KE, Rossiter SJ, Dávalos LM, \"Trpc2 pseudogenization dynamics in bats reveal ancestral vomeronasal signaling, then pervasive loss\", Evolution; international journal of organic evolution, 71 (4): 923-935 (2017) .\n\nMaier JA, Rivas-Astroza M, Deng J, Dowling A, Oboikovitz P, Cao X, Behringer RR, Cretekos CJ, Rasweiler JJ 4th, Zhong S, Sears KE, \"Transcriptomic insights into the genetic basis of mammalian limb diversity\", BMC evolutionary biology, 17 (1): 86- (2017) .\n\nAnthwal, N., Urban, D.J., Luo, Z-X., Sears, K.E., and Tucker, A., \"Breakdown of Meckel's cartilage provides clues to the evolution of mammals\", Nature Ecology and Evolution, 17 (1): - (2017) [link].\n\nResearch Interests\n\nSelected Publications\n\nResearch Interests\n\nPrinciples of cell fate specification\n\nAs an embryo develops, it needs to generate a myriad of cell types, all in specific locations relative to each other and with correct abundances. Retina, for example, contains more than a hundred neuronal subtypes, organized into three layers of cell bodies and two layers of neuropil. These cell types have different features and frequencies and have to be tiled across the retina in a specific way to support the overall function of the tissue. This seemingly impossible task is accomplished during development with incredible robustness. All the instructions for making this intricate structure, as well as all the other tissues in the body, has to be encoded in the genome. So we hypothesize that the blueprints for making tissues like retina are compressible and involve relatively simple principles. Our goal is to identify these principles and utilize them to develop new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nOur approach involves imaging based genetic barcoding for tracing the lineage and molecular history of individual cells, spatial transcriptomics for mapping cell states, computational modeling for interpreting the results, and synthetic biology for developing molecular tools to manipulate cell fate decisions.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nAmjad Askary, Luis Sanchez-Guardado, James M Linton, Duncan M Chadly, Mark W Budde, Long Cai, Carlos Lois, Michael B Elowitz, \"In situ readout of DNA barcodes and single base edits facilitated by in vitro transcription\", Nature biotechnology, 38 (1): 66-75 (2020) [link].\n\nAmjad Askary, Pengfei Xu, Lindsey Barske, Maxwell Bay, Paul Bump, Bartosz Balczerski, Michael A Bonaguidi, J Gage Crump, \"Genome-wide analysis of facial skeletal regionalization in zebrafish\", Development, 144 (16): 2994-3005 (2017) [link].\n\nJoanna Smeeton, Amjad Askary, J Gage Crump, \"Building and maintaining joints by exquisite local control of cell fate\", Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Developmental Biology, 6 (1): - (2017) [link].\n\nAmjad Askary, Joanna Smeeton, Sandeep Paul, Simone Schindler, Ingo Braasch, Nicholas A Ellis, John Postlethwait, Craig T Miller, J Gage Crump, \"Ancient origin of lubricated joints in bony vertebrates\", eLife, 5 : - (2016) [link].\n\nLindsey Barske, Amjad Askary, Elizabeth Zuniga, Bartosz Balczerski, Paul Bump, James T Nichols, J Gage Crump, \"Competition between Jagged-Notch and Endothelin1 signaling selectively restricts cartilage formation in the zebrafish upper face\", PLoS Genetics, 12 (4): - (2016) [link].\n\nAmjad Askary, Lindsey Mork, Sandeep Paul, Xinjun He, Audrey K Izuhara, Suhasni Gopalakrishnan, Justin K Ichida, Andrew P McMahon, Sonja Dabizljevic, Rodney Dale, Francesca V Mariani, J Gage Crump, \"Iroquois proteins promote skeletal joint formation by maintaining chondrocytes in an immature state\", Developmental cell, 35 (3): 358-365 (2015) [link].\n\nAmjad Askary, Noriko Shimazaki, Niki Bayat, Michael R Lieber, \"Modeling of the RAG reaction mechanism\", Cell reports, 7 (2): 307-315 (2014) [link].\n\nNoriko Shimazaki, Amjad Askary, Patrick C Swanson, Michael R Lieber, \"Mechanistic basis for RAG discrimination between recombination sites and the off-target sites of human lymphomas\", Molecular and cellular biology, 32 (2): 365-375 (2012) [link].\n\nResearch Interests\n\nSelected Publications\n\nResearch Interests\n\nSelected Publications\n\nResearch Interests\n\nSelected Publications\n\nResearch Interests\n\nNeurons are highly dynamics cells who produce complex networks of connections.

He also studies the role of metabolic pathways in the control of proliferation and differentiation in the preimplantation mouse embryo.\n\nSignal Transduction and metabolic control in Hematopoietic Development, stress response and cancer\n\n1. Blood Stem Cell Maintenance\n\nHematopoietic stem cells are maintained within a microenvironment where signals from a niche are important for the maintenance of quiescence within a precursor population. Lack of such a niche-derived signal will cause loss of 'stemness' resulting in increased proliferation and eventual differentiation. We study this phenomenon in the Drosophila hematopoietic organ using genetic technologies available in this model organism (see Martinez-Agosto et al., Genes & Devl., 2007 for a review).\n\nWe have shown that the 'stemness' of these cells is maintained through the combined action of a Niche Signal, generated by Hedgehog (Hh) (Mandal et al., Nature, 2007), a local signal generated by Wingless/Wnt (Sinenko et al., Dev. Cell., 2009) and a reverse signal from the differentiated cells to the stem cells that we have termed the Equilibrium Signal. Several important concepts underlying Drosophila blood development have allowed us to propose this system as an appropriate genetic model for vertebrate hematopoiesis and these molecular mechanisms are being explored in the laboratory.\n\n2. Stress Response systems\n\nMyeloid blood cells are ideal for the study of response to many kinds of stresses. Hypoxia-related factors and free radicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a role both in hematopoietic development and in stress response (Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, Nature 2009). Similarly, the NF-kB derived inflammatory response plays a major role in the way blood cells respond to injury at distant sites. The emerging view from these studies is that basic developmental mechanisms are co-opted again for stress, injury and inflammatory responses by the myeloid hematopoietic system. Genetic analysis allows us to understand the interrelationship between these important biological phenomena that have great relevance to diseases and disorders in humans.\n\n3. Metabolic control in Cancer pathways\n\nIn the past, our laboratory has identified components of signal transduction pathways that participate in oncogenesis (see Bonfini et al., Science, 1991; Flores et al., Cell 2000 for examples). We have also studied the role of the mitochondrion in controlling cell-cycle (Owusu-Ansah et al., Nature Genetics, 2008; Mandal et al., Dev. Cell, 2005). When cells become transformed, they choose alternate means of metabolism (a phenomenon referred to as the Warburg effect). We study the effect of signal transduction pathways on the control of cellular metabolism and the proper balance between cellular growth and metabolism that goes awry in Cancer.\n\n4. Metabolic control of early mouse development\n\nWe also explore the control of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial activity and biogenesis during development using early mouse embryo and the embryonic stem cells derived from them as a model. There is relative lack of data on the mechanisms that control transition between various modes of metabolic activity during phases of development. Nuclear and mitochondrial activities constantly modulate each other, and the relationship between signal transduction pathways commonly studied during development, cancer and stem cell maintenance and metabolic pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, mitochondrial biosynthesis and nutrient sensing are being explored. Immediate projects include determining the metabolic processes that are essential for zygotic transcription, and the switch between mitochondrial and glycolytic processes during early mouse development.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nSharpley MS, Chi F, Banerjee U, \"Metabolic Plasticity drives Development during Mammalian Embryogenesis\", Developmental Cell, 56 (16): - (2021) .\n\nGirard JR, Goins LM, Vuu DM, Sharpley MS, Spratford CM, Mantri SR, Banerjee U, \"Paths and Pathways that Generate Cell-Type Heterogeneity and Developmental Progression in Hematopoiesis\", eLife, 56 (16): - (2021) .\n\nChi F, Sharpley MS, Nagaraj R, Roy SS, Banerjee U, \"Glycolysis-Independent Glucose Metabolism Distinguishes TE from ICM Fate during Mammalian Embryogenesis\", Developmental Cell, 53 (1): - (2020) .\n\nUtpal Banerjee, Juliet R.

Abnormalities in the formation and/or function of the heart and vessels often lead to embryonic lethality or cause severe health issues in the adult. Our laboratory uses a multidisciplinary approach and the zebrafish model to understand the genetic, molecular and cellular basis of the cardiovascular system during normal development and in diseases.\n\nSeveral unique features make zebrafish ideal for genetic and embryological studies. For instance, the transparent nature of zebrafish embryos provides easy access to observe and study organ development in live embryos. From classic and chemical genetic screens, we have identified mutations and compounds that affect proper patterning or function of the heart and vessels in the zebrafish. We are now using these mutants and compounds as points of entry to study questions about (1) molecular hierarchies important for the formation and cardiac progenitor cells; (2) molecular and cellular mechanisms for cardiac chamber maturation; (3) molecular and physiological mechanisms by which rhythmic cardiac contraction is maintained and by which cardiac arrhythmia occurs.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nXu Q, Dupper N, Smaligo A, Fan, YC, Cai L,Wang Z, Langenbacher A, Chen J-N and Kwon O., \"Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Guvacine Derivatives Through [4 + 2] Annulations of Imines With ?-Methylallenoates\", Organic Letters 20 (19): 6089-6093 (2018).\n\nDing Y, Ma J, Langenbacher AD, Baek KI, Lee J, Chang CC, Hsu JJ, Kulkarni RP, Belperio J, Shi W, Ranjbarvaziri S, Ardehali R, Tintut Y, Demer LL, Chen JN, Fei P, Packard RRS, Hsiai TK., \"Multiscale lightsheet for rapid imaging of cardiopulmonary system\", JCI Insight 3 (16): 1-14 (2018).\n\nZiyad S, Riordan JD, Cavanaugh AM, Su T, Hernandez GE, Hilfenhaus G, Morselli M, Huynh K, Wang K, Chen JN, Dupuy AJ and Iruela-Arispe ML., \"A forward genetic screen targeting the endothelium reveals a regulatory role for the lipid kinase Pi4ka in myelo-and erythropoiesis\", Cell Reports 22: 1211-1224 (2018).\n\nShimizu H, Langenbacher AD, Huang J, Wang K, Otto G, Geisler R, Wang Y, Chen JN., \"The Calcineurin-FoxO-MuRF1 signaling pathway regulates myofibril integrity in cardiomyocytes\", eLife 6 (e27955): 1-19 (2017).\n\nLu F, Langenbacher AD and Chen JN, \"Tbx20 drives cardiac progenitor formation and cardiac proliferation in zebrafish\", Developmental Biology 421: 139-148 (2017).\n\nBerchtold MW, Kulej K, Zacharias T, Wang K, Torggler RF, Lorentzen L, Jespersen T, Chen JN, Larsen MR and La Cour JM, \"The Arrhythmogenic Calmodulin Mutation D129G Dysregulates Cell Growth, Calmodulin-dependent Kinase II Activity and Cardiac Function in Zebrafish\", J.

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the genes and gene products that participate in the development of the skeleton and that ultimately determine the shapes of the bones, the height an individual achieves, and the stability of the skeleton. A major step toward achieving our goals is genomic analysis in skeletal dysplasia families to identify the gene associated with each of the over 450 different skeletal dysplasias. For disorders in which the defective gene is known, a combination of mutation analysis and biosynthetic studies is used to understand the mechanisms by which the mutations arise, the inheritance pattern of each disorder, and the effect of each mutation of the synthesis, structure, and function of the encoded protein. These goals are augmented by studies in model organisms, particularly mice, that include mechanistic studies and the development of therapies to ameliorate or cure these disorders.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nCsukasi F, Duran I, Zhang W, Martin JH, Barad M, Bamshad M, Weis MA, Eyre D, Krakow D, Cohn DH, \"Dominant-negative SOX9 mutations in campomelic dysplasia\", Human mutation (2019).\n\nBalasubramanian K, Weis M, Eyre DR, Martin J, Ortiz-Sanchez J, Duran I, Vangala S, Wang J, Friedman RA, Krakow D, Cohn DH, \"The ?2 chain of type IX collagen is essential for type IX collagen biosynthesis\", American journal of medical genetics.

Cell division arrest prevents tumors and maintains the proper form of tissues. Many cells must also retain the ability to start dividing again when conditions are right, e.g., when the organism must grow, or a damaged tissue must be repaired. A cell in such a temporary, non-dividing state is said to be ?quiescent.? Quiescence is a common state for many somatic cells, including fibroblasts, lymphocytes, hematopoietic stem cells, and even dormant tumor cells. Failure to appropriately regulate the transition between quiescence and proliferation underlies several common and lethal disorders, including cancer and chronic wounds. My research is focused on understanding the molecular basis of quiescence using in vitro models, mouse models and human patients.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nSullivan WJ, Mullen PJ, Schmid EW, Flores A, Momcilovic M, Sharpley MS, Jelinek D, Whiteley AE, Maxwell MB, Wilde BR, Banerjee U, Coller HA, Shackelford DB, Braas D, Ayer DE, de Aguiar VTQ, Lowry WE, Christofk HR, \"Extracellular matrix remodeling regulates glucose metabolism through TXNIP destabilization\", Cell 175 (1): 117-132 (2018).

Scar tissue does not contribute to cardiac contractile force and the remaining viable cardiac muscle is thus subject to a greater hemodynamic burden. Over time, the heart muscle eventually fails leading to the development of heart failure and 500,000 patients are diagnosed annually in the United States with heart failure. Thus the inability of the heart to regenerate cardiac muscle, coupled with a predominant fibrotic injury response remain major fundamental obstacles to treating heart disease.\n\nOur laboratory studies the interface of cardiac fibroblasts (scar forming cells) and cardiac progenitors in determining how a cross talk between these cells regulates cardiac repair. We use murine models of cardiac injury and use a variety of fate mapping and conditional knockout strategies to alter specific genes at specific time points after injury to investigate our questions. We study the Wnt signaling pathway, a family of 19 closely related proteins that play key roles in organogenesis, wound healing and cancer. We have recently demonstrated that Wnt1, a Wnt known to play important roles in the development of the central nervous system plays an important role in regulating a fibrotic injury response in the heart. Using transgenic and conditional knock out strategies, we aim to alter the fibrotic repair response of the heart to enable regeneration.\n\nEpicardium and mechanisms of EMT\n\nThe second area of investigation in our laboratory is to understand the role of cardiac cell plasticity and how plasticity can be modulated to affect wound healing in the adult heart. In this respect, we have recently shown that scar forming cells in the heart exhibit plasticity after cardiac injury and such plasticity can be modulated to affect the wound healing response (Nature 2014; 585-590). We study molecule mechanisms of such plasticity and aim to modulate the scar response by coaxing scar forming cells to adopt alternative cell fates. Another example of a plastic cardiac cell is the epicardial cell. The epicardium is a single layer of epithelial cells, that surrounds the heart. Although the epicardium is critically important for cardiac development, little is known about the function of the epicardium in the adult heart. We have recently demonstrated that the epicardium undergoes epithelial-mesenchymal-transition in a Wnt dependent manner after cardiac injury and generates cardiac fibroblasts that reside in the subepicardial space and contribute to cardiac fibrosis. The molecular regulation of epicardial EMT, identification of precursors in the epicardium that give rise to cardiac fibroblasts and its role in wound healing form another major focus in our laboratory.\n\nCardiac calcification\n\nCalcification of the heart is a predominant phenotype of the aging heart and pathologic calcification predisposes to cardiac disease. For instance, calcification of the conduction system in humans causes slowing of conduction and heart blocks, while calcification of the valves leads to stiffening of the valve leaflets, and obstruction or regurgitation of blood across the valves secondary to defective coaptation of valve leaflets. The origins of the cells contributing to cardiac calcification and mechanisms regulating calcium deposition remain ill understood. Using human heart valves (obtained during surgical replacement of calcific heart valves), we isolate and study progenitor populations that can contribute to cardiac calcification. We also have murine models of calcification that we use to obtain fate maps about potential progenitor populations contributing to cardiac calcification and study mechanisms driving progenitors to adopt an osteoblast (calcium forming cell) fate. This project allows the interrogation of mechanisms in both murine models and human tissue.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nYu J, Seldin MM, Fu K, Li S, Lam L, Wang P, Wang Y, Huang D, Nguyen TL, Wei B, Kulkarni RP, Di Carlo D, Teitell M, Pellegrini M, Lusis AJ, Deb A., \"Topological Arrangement of Cardiac Fibroblasts Regulates Cellular Plasticity\", Circulation Research (2018).

A major challenge for the 21st century is to increase the yields of major crop plants, such as soybean, using state-of-the-art genetic technologies. One way to accomplish this task is to use genomics to understand all of the genes and genetic processes required to ?make a seed? in order to engineer plants for yield traits such as more seeds, bigger seeds, and seeds with improved nutritional composition. Increasing seed yield should contribute significantly to enhancing our food supply, because over half of the major crops used for human consumption are seed crops.\n\nMy laboratory has been investigating gene activity during seed development in order to identify the genes and gene regulatory networks required to program seed development. We have been carrying out experiments to 1) profile the mRNAs present in every soybean and Arabidopsis seed compartment (e.g., embryo, endosperm, seed coat), region (embryo proper, suspensor), and tissue (e.g., inner integument, endothelium, seed coat epidermis) throughout development, 2) characterize the epigenetic events at the DNA and chromatin level to understand their role in seed development, and 3) determine the targets of critical transcription factor genes programming seed development. The main focus of our experiments is to identify transcription factor genes that program differentiation events and determine how they form regulatory networks that program seed differentiation and function. The long-term goal of research being carried out in my laboratory is to understand ?how to make a seed? in order to use this information for the improvement of crop plants.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nJo, L., Pelletier, J.M., Hsu, S., Baden, R., Goldberg, R.B., Harada, J.J., \"Combinatorial interactions of the LEC1 transcription factor specify diverse developmental programs during soybean seed development\", Proc.

During his graduate work, Dr. Goldstein described the isolation of epithelial progenitor cells from mouse and human prostate tissue and demonstrated the capacity of progenitor cells to initiate prostate cancer in response to oncogenic transformation. Following up on this work, Dr. Goldstein and colleagues determined that prostate cancer can evolve from a basal cell of origin to a luminal-like tumor-propagating cell population. More recently, the Goldstein laboratory has been investigating the interplay between inflammation, epithelial progenitor cells, and tumorigenesis, using a combination of mouse and human tissue models. The main goals of the lab are to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms promoting epithelial cancer initiation, progression and resistance to treatment.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nCrowell PD, Fox JJ, Hashimoto T, Diaz JA, Navarro HI, Henry GH, Feldmar BA, Lowe MG, Garcia AJ, Wu YE, Sajed DP, Strand DW, Goldstein AS, \"Expansion of luminal progenitor cells in the aging mouse and human prostate\", Cell Reports 28 (6): 1499-1510 (2019).

Connectivity in turn depends in large part on the genetically determined wiring properties of neurons, including their neurite projection, branching, and placement of synaptic contacts with specific partners. Research of my lab revolves around the question how gene expression controls neuronal connectivity and, thereby, brain function. We use the model system Drosophila, where virtually every gene can be targeted for knock-out or activation in a cell type selective manner Drosophila also offers the advantage that its brain is composed of a relatively small number of stereotyped neuronal lineages, groups of neurons descended from individual embryonic stem cells, called neuroblasts.\n\nA longstanding line of research in our lab is to reconstruct how lineages assemble the major circuits of the fly brain. For the small larval brain, this reconstruction can now be done at a so far unparalleled level of resolution, using a series of several thousand contiguous electron microscopic sections in conjunction with a specially developed software package that allows us to assign all synapses to specific neurons and their lineages.\n\nMore recently, we have identified a specific circuit, called the anterior visual pathway (AVP), which conducts input form the eye to a brain center, the central complex, known to process and store visual information in order to control fly locomotion (walking, flight). The central part of this circuit is formed by three lineages, whose neurons form several classes of highly ordered parallel and sequential elements. We are investigating the function of the neuronal classes of the AVP, by recording their activity in response to defined visual stimuli, and follow the question of how the developmental history of a neuron (time of birth, placement within the spatial framework of the developing brain) relates to its later connectivity within the AVP circuit.\n\nWe conduct research contributing to our understanding of the genetic specification of brain circuitry. During the course of its proliferation, each neuroblast expresses characteristic sets of regulatory genes. These genes are assumed to be relevant in the control of the wiring properties of the neurons born from a particular neuroblast during a particular time interval. Our research aims to link the structurally defined lineages mapped in the larval brain with the neuroblasts of the embryo, using a technique that systematically labels all transcription factors expressed in neuroblasts and then follows the expression of these genes from neuroblast to lineage.\n\nFinally, our work on the genetic patterning of the Drosophila brain guided us towards becoming more active in comparative studies, addressing questions of stem cells and neural development in other animal taxa. We decided to focus on several clades of basal metazoan, notably the flatworms (platyhelminthes) and acoels, generally considered to be the most primitive animals with a central nervous system, as well as cnidarians, which predate bilaterian animals.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nHartenstein V, \"Development of the Nervous System of Invertebrates\", In: The Oxford Handbook of Invertebrate Neurobiology 1-91 (2018).\n\nArboleda E, Hartenstein V, Martinez P, Reichert H, Sen S, Sprecher S, Bailly X., \"An Emerging System to Study Photosymbiosis Brain Regeneration, Chronobiology, and Behavior: The Marine Acoel Symsagittifera roscoffensis\", Bioessays Aug 27:e1800107: 1-10 (2018).\n\nDe Miguel-Bonet MDM, Ahad S, Hartenstein V., \"Role of neoblasts in the patterned postembryonic growth of the platyhelminth Macrostomum lignano\", Neurogenesis 5: 1-9 (2018).\n\nDeng H, Takashima S, Paul M, Guo M, Hartenstein V., \"Mitochondrial dynamics regulates Drosophila intestinal stem cell differentiation\", Cell Death Discov 5: 1-13 (2018).\n\nHartenstein, V, Giangrande A., \"Connecting the nervous and the immune systems in evolution\", Communications Biology 1: 1-5 (2018).\n\nDonlea JM, Pimentel D, Talbot CB, Kempf A, Omoto JJ, Hartenstein V, Miesenböck G, \"Recurrent Circuitry for Balancing Sleep Need and Sleep\", Neuron 97: 378-389 (2018).\n\nKendroud S, Bohra AA, Kuert PA, Nguyen B, Guillermin O, Sprecher SG, Reichert H, VijayRaghavan K, Hartenstein V., \"Structure and development of the subesophageal zone of the Drosophila brain.

The roots of legume plants house the bacteria, usually in root nodules, in which the microbes convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, thereby allowing the plant to live without added nitrogen fertilizer. In my early years at UCLA, I demonstrated the importance of phytohormones in nodule development, the significance of various plant and bacterial proteins for adherence to the root, and also showed the conservation of signal transduction pathways in nodulation and mycorrhization pathways based on common gene expression patterns.\n\nLater, we began to investigate what-are-known as \"non-traditional\" nitrogen fixers, the newly discovered beta-rhizobia, as well as the plants associated with them. Because many of these bacteria exhibit metabolic activities, such as cellulose degradation as well as nodulation and nitrogen fixation (in the case of the beta-rhizobia), they have the potential, not only to be used for enhancing nitrogen nutrition in crop plants, especially as increased energy costs result in greater fertilizer expenditures, but also in the production of biofuels. To this end, I coordinated the sequencing and annotation of four Burkholderia genomes, including a species that nodulates agronomically important legumes growing in arid and acidic soils. In addition, two Micromonospora (actinobacteria) genomes were sequenced and these data are published. Micromonospora is an important Plant Growth Promoting Bacterial (PGPB) species. My lab has also determined that symbiotic Burkholderia spp. are unlikely pathogens based on bioinformatics analyses and by employing HeLa cell and Caenorhabditis elegans assays to determine non-pathogenicity. We recently published on the different arrangement of nodulation and nitrogen fixation genes in the plant-associated Burkholderia versus the well-studied alpha rhizobial species.\n\nBecause my research has always focused on the ?hidden half? of the plant, i.e. the root, and especially on the beneficial interactions that take place between plant roots and microbes in the rhizosphere microbiome, I made the transition early on to working on plant microbiomes. In so doing, we began to investigate a broader range of plant-growth promoting bacteria (PGPB), which are associated with roots, especially those isolated from arid environments. Our rationale is that as the climate changes, agricultural productivity will decline because crop-growing regions will become drier and less fertile. Novel drought-adapted, nitrogen-fixing bacteria are likely to provide genetic traits that increase both nutrient availability and environmental tolerance to salinity and drought brought about by reduced rainfall, higher soil acidity, and increased temperatures. In addition, many PGPB are effective at inhibiting plant pathogens, either directly by killing the pathogens or indirectly by making plants healthier so they can overcome pathogen infection. Moreover, a combination of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and one or more PGPB, such as Micromonospora or Bacillus spp., enhance plant growth and yield beyond single inoculation. The development of microbial consortia for plant inocula is the next direction of research that the Hirsch lab is pursuing. The microbes that inhabit nitrogen-fixing nodules grown in field conditions are the best way to determine which bacteria are compatible with another and could be used to establish consortia. My lab is also pursuing metagenomic and cultivation-dependent analysis of dryland soils as a means to find novel bacteria for inoculum development. We have licensed our discoveries from the Negev Desert (Israel) research, and we have a pending agreement with an agricultural company that is developing novel inocula to replace chemical amendments for certain crops. Studies in other deserts and dry environments are also in place.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nVeliz EA, Martínez-Hidalgo P, Hirsch AM., \"Chitinase-producing organisms and their role in biocontrol\", AIMS Microbiology 3 (3): 689-705 (2019).

[link]\n\nResearch Interests\n\nEndothelial cells are unique in their ability to switch from a \"differentiated\" (non-dividing, non-invasive) to a relatively \"undifferentiated\" (invasive and highly mitotic) phenotype during the process of blood vessel formation or angiogenesis. We are intrigued by this plasticity and our research efforts are guided towards understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of endothelial gene expression. It is hoped that understanding the regulation of this switch will teach us lessons about differentiation pathways in general. Under this umbrella, the major focus of the laboratory has been the dissection of genetic programs involved in the formation and involution of blood vessels during development and in pathological conditions.\n\nIn the projects related to developmental angiogenesis, our models include the murine mammary gland and the chicken embryo. The mammary gland provides us with an excellent platform in which to study the expansion and regression of the vasculature associated with the physiological changes of this organ. The chicken embryo enables us to study the formation and remodeling of the vasculature during normal development. Using these two models we search for genes involved in vascular morphogenesis and ask funtional/mechanistic questions using genetics (transgenics and knock-outs in the case of the mouse) and molecular biology (transfection or chicken embryos using electroporation). By perturbing gene expression we hoped to further dissect the molecular pathways that guide vascular formation and remodeling.\n\nA second focus of the lab has been to identify novel angiogenesis inhibitors. Evolution of several pathologies, including the growth of tumors, requires formation of new blood vessels. Blockade of these new blood vessels had been extremely effective in the restriction of tumor growth and suppression of metastasis. Therefore, the identification of novel, tumor-vascular specific, and non-toxic inhibitors has become a major focus of several academic and biotechnology groups. Using the anti-angiogenic region of thrombospondin-1 we have cloned and characterized two novel inhibitors METH-1 (also known as ADAMTS-1) and METH-2 (also known as ADAMTS-8). METH-1 and 2 are able to effectively suppress proliferation of new capillaries and in xenograph assays inhibit the growth of tumors. Both molecules are secreted matrix metalloproteases with disintegrin and thrombospondin motifs. We have invested a great effort in the full characterization and in understanding the mechanisms of action of these molecules. Projects include structure/function analysis of each of the domains: generation of transgenics and knock-ins, identification of substrates / natural inhibitors, and understanding regulation of gene expression.\n\nThe effect of steroid hormones, in particular progesterone, on vascular networks in vivo is another focus of the lab. We have found that progesterone inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and have remarkable effects in vascular permeability. Determination of the signaling pathways that result in these events and their biological relevance are major research efforts on this project.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nKeklikoglou, I., CIanciaruso, C., Guc, E., Squadrito, M.L., Spring, L.M., Tazzyman, S., Lambien, L., Poissonnier, A., Ferraro, G.B., Baer, C., Cassara, A., Guichard, A., Iruela-Arispe, M.L., Lewis, C.E., Coussens, L.M., Bardia, A., Jain, R.K., Pollard, J.W., De Palma, M., \"Chemotherapy elicits pro-metastatic extracellular vesicles in breast cancer models\", Nature Cell Biol (2018).\n\nIruela-Arispe, M.L., \"Pumping blood with self-reliance and cooperation\", Journal of Experimental Medicine 215 (10): 2480-2482 (2018).\n\nIruela-Arispe, M.L., \"A dual origin for blood vessels\", Nature 562 (7726): 195-197 (2018).\n\nMcDonald, A.I., Shirali, A.S., Arag?n, R., Ma, F., Hernandez, G., Vaughn, D.A., Mack, J.J., Lim, T.Y., Sunshine, H., Zhao, P., Kalinichenko, V., Hai, T., Pelegrini, M., Ardehali, R., and Iruela-Arispe, M.L., \"Endothelial Regeneration of Large Vessels is a Biphasic Process Driven by Local Cells with Distinct Proliferative Capacities\", Cell Stem Cell 23 (2): 210-225 (2018).\n\nArcher, B., Ueberrueck, T., Mack, J., Yousef, K., Jarenwattananon, N.N., Rall, D., Wypysek, D., Wiese, M., Bluemich, B., Wessling, M., Iruela-Arispe, L., and Bouchard, L., \"Non-Invasive Quantification of Cell Density in 3D Gels by MRI\", IEEE Trans Biomed Eng 1-10 (2018).
