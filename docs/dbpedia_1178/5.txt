Murray S. Blum, who retired as Research Professor from the department of entomology in l995, was honored by a symposium at the XV Congress of the International Union for the Study of Social Insects in Washington, D.C.

The symposium, “Social Insect Semiochemicals: A Symposium in Honor of Murray Blum,” paid tribute to Blum’s seminal research with the pheromones and chemical defenses of social insects-ants, bees and termites. The symposium also alluded to the importance of Blum’s contributions in studies of other insects-beetles, true bugs and grasshoppers-and with the toxic venoms of medically significant insects.
