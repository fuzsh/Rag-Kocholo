Connecting with a faculty mentor is an essential step in becoming involved in undergraduate research.

On this page, you will find the names, departments, and education of all of Northeasternâ€™s faculty members. While not all serve as undergraduate researcher mentors, many do, and you can use this tool to understand the depth and breadth of faculty research at Northeastern. Please consult the information on How-to-Identify and Work with a Faculty Mentor tab as well. You can search open research listings on the Research Opportunities page.

Faculty who have expressed special interest in mentoring undergraduates have been highlighted with a Mentor badge.
