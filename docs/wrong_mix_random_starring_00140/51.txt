LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — Grammy Award-winning artist Kelly Clarkson will headline a local fundraiser concert, according to Las Vegas Sands.

Sands Cares INSPIRE 2019, a signature fundraiser event for Sands, will take place on Friday at The Venetian hotel-casino with an 8 p.m. showtime.

Clarkson is fresh off her "Meaning of Life" tour and holds numerous musical accolades since taking the first season of "American Idol."

The charity concert raises funds for Sands Cares Accelerator Program members, the Marty Hennessy Inspiring Children Foundation, and the Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth, according to an event spokesperson.

"INSPIRE is a do-good, feel-good opportunity for the community," said Ron Reese, senior vice president of global communications and corporate affairs at Las Vegas Sands. "The chance to see someone as powerful as Kelly Clarkson in a more personal venue like The Venetian Theatre, combined with knowing your ticket purchase is going directly to helping at-risk youth, should make for a remarkable evening."

Ava Frasier, a former student at the Inspiring Children’s Foundation and current music student at Belmont University, along with 16-year-old Brynn Cartelli, winner of The Voice, will also join Clarkson Friday night and opening up the concert.
