The holiday spirit is in full swing! This week, we've partnered with The Kelly Clarkson Show to give back to the communities that we deliver to and spread the joy of Charity Giving Week.

We’re especially proud to team up with Kelly Clarkson, a Fort Worth native and philanthropist, by spotlighting one of our favorite Dallas-Fort Worth charities: Hugs Cafe, a McKinney-based non-profit that enhances the lives of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities through training and employment.

On Monday’s broadcast, Wing CEO Adam Woodworth joined Kelly to present a $25,000 donation to Hugs Cafe. We’re committed to supporting and giving back to the places where we operate.

We want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone at The Kelly Clarkson Show for inviting us to join Charity Giving Week. Many charitable organizations rely on year-end donations to fulfill their missions and provide essential services, and it’s been inspiring to team up with Kelly Clarkson to shine a light on their causes.
