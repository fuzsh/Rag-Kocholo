Those who tuned in to the “Kelly Clarkson Show” on Thursday caught a local face with a global mission.

Kayla Abramowitz, the 19-year-old founder and “Chief Kid Officer” of Kayla Cares 4 Kids appeared on the show to talk about how she's grown her non-profit since its beginnings eight years ago.

Abramowitz, a freshman at the University of Miami and resident of North Palm Beach, founded the organization to provide sick children at medical facilities with anything that can help educate and entertain them: books, movies, video games, crafts and more.

Diagnosed with Crohn’s Disease, Juvenile Arthritis and Eosinophilic Colitis, she said she spent long periods of time in hospitals and understands what it’s like for kids in the sometimes scary and lonely environment.

“I realized how boring it can be," she said. She wanted to give kids something to do.

After eight years of work, her organization has donated over 32,000 items to 450 facilities around the country. Her “global headquarters,” as she called it, is located in West Palm Beach, but as she attends school in Miami, she said she’s spread her roots to that area as well.

Abramowitz appeared on a part of the show called "What I'm Liking," a segment dedicated to a person doing something good or interesting online. She applied to be a guest on the show a long time ago, she said, but her family had forgotten about it until about three weeks ago.

That’s when her mom got a call from a California number that turned out to be a producer.

It was “a complete shock,” she said, “but a good shock.”

She was selected after submitting a video describing her work. After a whole week of preparing — practicing lines, picking out an outfit, checking lighting — she filmed the segment the week before.

Clarkson, she said, was the nicest person.

“I want to be just like her,” Abramowitz said. “She has the most love I’ve ever seen from a person."

Abramowitz continues to look for monetary support and board members for Kayla Cares 4 Kids as she hopes to expand her organization.

But she was surprised to leave her interview with more than she started.

Kayla Cares 4 Kids recieved a $1,000 donation from Clarkson and Pilot Pen, a sponsor of the show. She said she already plans to use the money for some of her organization’s programs, like monthly craft activities across South Florida and live streams.
