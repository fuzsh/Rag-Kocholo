        "text": "American singer and actress (born 1981)\n\nKelendria Trene Rowland[3] (born February 11, 1981) is an American singer, actress, entrepreneur and television personality, solidifying her status as an influential figure in popular culture. As a child, Rowland started performing in various singing and dancing competitions where she rose to fame in the late 1990s as a member of Destiny's Child, one of the world's best-selling girl groups. During the group's three-year hiatus, Rowland released her debut solo studio album, Simply Deep (2002), which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and sold over 3 million copies worldwide.[4] It included the Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"Dilemma\" (with Nelly), as well as the UK top-five hits \"Stole\" and \"Can't Nobody\". Rowland also ventured into acting with starring roles in Freddy vs. Jason (2003) and The Seat Filler (2005).\n\nFollowing the disbanding of Destiny's Child in 2006, Rowland released her second studio album, Ms. Kelly (2007), which produced the international top-ten hits \"Like This\" (featuring Eve) and \"Work\". In 2009, she hosted the first season of The Fashion Show, and was featured on David Guetta's \"When Love Takes Over\", which topped the charts in several countries. Its success influenced Rowland to explore electronic dance music on her third studio album, Here I Am (2011), which spawned the UK top-ten singles \"Commander\" (featuring David Guetta), \"Down for Whatever\" and \"What a Feeling\", as a well as the hit electro-R&B single \"Motivation\" (featuring Lil Wayne). Her fourth studio album, Talk a Good Game (2013), became her third top-ten album on the US Billboard 200 chart. Rowland was a television judge on the eighth season of The X Factor UK (2011), as well as the third season of The X Factor USA (2013). She has continued her television career by hosting Chasing Destiny (2016) and starred as a coach on The Voice Australia (2017–2020). Rowland is credited with forming the girl groups Little Mix and June's Diary from her stints on The X Factor UK and Chasing Destiny respectively.\n\nThroughout her career, Rowland has sold over 40 million records as a solo artist,[5] and a further estimated 60 million records with Destiny's Child.[6] Her work has earned her several awards and nominations, including five Grammy Awards, one Billboard Music Award, and two Soul Train Music Awards. Rowland has also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as part of Destiny's Child, and as a solo artist, she has been honored by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and Essence for her contributions to music. In 2014, Fuse ranked Rowland in their \"100 Most Award-Winning Artists\" list at number 20.[7]\n\nKelendria Trene Rowland was born on February 11, 1981, in Atlanta, Georgia. She is the daughter of Doris Rowland-Garrison (December 6, 1947 – December 2, 2014)[8][9] and Christopher Lovett. She has an older brother named Orlando.[10] When Rowland was six, her mother left her father, who was an abusive alcoholic and suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from serving in the Vietnam War, and Rowland went with her.[11][12] When Rowland was seven or eight, her family relocated to Houston,[13] where at some point she moved in with fellow Destiny's Child member Beyoncé, referring to Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles as \"Mama T\".[14]\n\nCirca the early 1990s, Rowland joined Beyoncé, Tamar Davis and LaTavia Roberson in the girl group Girl's Tyme.[15] Girl's Tyme competed on the nationally televised talent show Star Search,[16] but lost the competition to Skeleton Crew.[17][18][19] Beyoncé's father Mathew Knowles reduced the sextet lineup to a quartet, adding LeToya Luckett, and began managing the group.[20] In 1995, they signed with Elektra Records, who dropped them months later.[21] D'wayne Wiggins then began working with the group, and they were briefly signed to his label. The group went through several name changes, including the Dolls, Something Fresh, Cliché, and Destiny before deciding upon a final moniker.[22] Under the name Destiny's Child, the group was picked up by Columbia Records. They continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B groups of the time, such as SWV, Dru Hill, and Immature.[23]\n\nTaken from a passage in the Biblical Book of Isaiah,[24] the group changed their name to Destiny's Child, after signing to Columbia Records in 1997.[25] That same year, Destiny's Child recorded their major label debut song \"Killing Time\", for the soundtrack to the 1997 film Men in Black.[26] Later that year, the group released their debut single, \"No, No, No\", and the following year, they released their self-titled debut album.[18] The album amassed moderate sales and won the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards. The group released their multi-platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999.[27] The album features some of the group's most successful singles such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say My Name\". \"Say My Name\" won Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[28] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than 15 million copies worldwide.[18][29][30]\n\nAlong with their commercial successes, the group became entangled in much-publicized turmoil involving the filing of a lawsuit by group members Luckett and Roberson for breach of contract. Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin appeared in the video of \"Say My Name\", and Luckett and Roberson were dismissed from the group. Franklin would eventually quit the group after five months.[18] After settling on their final lineup, the trio released \"Independent Women Part I\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for eleven consecutive weeks.[29] That same year, Luckett and Roberson withdrew their case against their now-former bandmates, while maintaining the suit against Mathew, which ended in both sides agreeing to stop public disparaging.\n\nLater that year, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album Survivor, Rowland appeared on the remix of Avant's single \"Separated\". Survivor, which channeled the turmoil the band underwent, spawned its lead single of the same name, which was a response to the experience.[31] The song went on to win a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[32] The themes of \"Survivor\", however, caused Luckett and Roberson to refile their lawsuit; the proceedings were eventually settled in June 2002.[30] The album was released in May 2001, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.[33] Survivor has sold over twelve million copies worldwide, over forty percent of which were sold in the US alone.[34] The album also spawned the number-one hit \"Bootylicious\" on which Rowland sang lead vocals. Before releasing their remix album This Is the Remix in 2002, the group announced a temporary hiatus to pursue solo projects.[35]\n\nIn 2002, Rowland was featured on Nelly's single \"Dilemma\", which won the pair a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.[36] The song became one of the most successful singles of the year, topping many charts worldwide, including the United States, where it became Rowland's first number-one single as a solo artist, selling worldwide over 7.6 million copies.[37][38][39] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote that because of the song's success, \"Rowland is no longer a mere backing vocalist for Beyoncé.\".[40]\n\nRowland's debut solo album, Simply Deep, was released on October 22, 2002, in the US. Featuring production contributions by Mark J. Feist, Big Bert, Rich Harrison, and singers Brandy and Solange Knowles providing background vocals, the album took Rowland's solo work further into an alternative music mixture, which Rowland described as a \"weird fusion [of] a little bit of Sade and a little bit of rock.\"[41][42][13] Simply Deep debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200 and at number three on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with first-week sales of 77,000 copies sold.[43] It was eventually certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[44] As of 2013, Simply Deep remains as Rowland's best-selling album in the US, with 602,000 copies sold.[43] Released to an even bigger success in international territories, Simply Deep topped the UK Albums Chart and became a gold-seller in Australia,[45] Canada,[46] and New Zealand,[47] resulting in worldwide sales total of 2.5 million copies.[48] Simply Deep yielded the international top-ten single \"Stole\" and the UK top-five single \"Can't Nobody\". Rowland transitioned into acting in 2002, playing the recurring role of Carly in the fourth season of UPN sitcom The Hughleys.[49] She continued her acting career the following year, with guest roles in UPN sitcom Eve as Cleo, and in NBC drama series American Dreams as Martha Reeves.[50] In August 2003, Rowland made her big-screen debut playing the supporting role of Kia Waterson alongside Robert Englund and Monica Keena in the slasher film, Freddy vs. Jason, which grossed $114.5 million at the box office worldwide.[51][52]\n\nIn July 2005, Rowland starred opposite Duane Martin and Shemar Moore in the romantic comedy The Seat Filler, which grossed $17.9 million worldwide.[53] She played Jhnelle, a pop star who falls for an awards-show seat filler whom she mistakes for a high-profile entertainment attorney.[54] After a three-year hiatus that involved concentration on individual solo projects, Rowland rejoined Beyoncé and Michelle Williams for Destiny's Child's final studio album Destiny Fulfilled, released on November 15, 2004.[55] The album hit number two on the Billboard 200 and spawned the top-five singles \"Lose My Breath\" and \"Soldier\", which features T.I. and Lil Wayne.[56] The following year, Destiny's Child embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin' It. During the last stop of the European tour in Barcelona, Spain, on June 11, Rowland announced that they would disband following the North American leg of the tour.[57] Destiny's Child released their first compilation album Number 1's on October 25 in the US, which peaked at number one on the Billboard 200. On March 28, 2006, Destiny's Child accepted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[58]\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Rowland and Beyoncé founded the Survivor Foundation, a charitable entity set up to provide transitional housing for victims and storm evacuees in the Houston, Texas area. The Survivor Foundation extended the philanthropic mission of the Knowles-Rowland Center for Youth, a multi-purpose community outreach facility in downtown Houston.[59] Rowland and Beyoncé lent their voices to a collaboration with Kitten Sera, titled \"All That I'm Lookin for\". The song appeared on The Katrina CD album, whose proceeds went to the Recording Artists for Hope organization.[60] Rowland returned to television in 2006, playing Tammy Hamilton, in the sixth season of UPN sitcom Girlfriends. Rowland initially hoped her three-episode stint would expand to a larger recurring role, but as the show was moved to The CW Television Network the following year, plans for a return eventually went nowhere.[61]\n\nIn June 2007, Kelly Rowland embarked on the Ms. Kelly Tour to promote her second solo album Ms. Kelly. The five-date tour visited Europe, North America, Africa, and Asia. Ms. Kelly was released on July 3, 2007, in the United States. Originally titled My Story, the album's first version was actually scheduled for a June 2006 release, but Rowland, her management and Columbia Records decided to shelve the album at the last minute to re-work a version with a different vibe as the singer considered the final track listing \"too full of midtempos and ballads.\"[61][62] Rowland eventually consulted additional producers to collaborate on the album, including Billy Mann, Mysto & Pizzi, Sean Garrett, Scott Storch, and Polow da Don.[63] Upon its release, Ms. Kelly debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 and number two on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with first-week sales of 86,000 copies.[64] Outside the US, the album widely failed to reprise the success of Simply Deep, barely reaching the top-forty on the majority of all charts it appeared on, except for the UK, where it opened at number 37.[65]\n\nMs. Kelly included the UK top-five hit \"Like This\", featuring Eve, as well as the international top-ten hit \"Work\". In July 2007, Rowland released her first DVD titled BET Presents Kelly Rowland, which celebrates the release Ms. Kelly and features an interview with Rowland about the album's production, footage of her time with Destiny's Child, live performances and music videos.[66][67] Following the album's lukewarm sales, it was re-released as an extended play (EP) titled, Ms. Kelly: Diva Deluxe, on March 25, 2008. The previously unreleased Bobby Womack cover \"Daylight\", a collaboration with Travie McCoy, served as the EP's lead single and was a moderate success in the UK.[65]\n\nIn 2007, Rowland, along with stars such as Jessica Simpson and the cast of Grey's Anatomy autographed pink Goody Ouchless brushes that were made available for auction on eBay, with all proceeds going to Breast Cancer Awareness.[68] Also, the singer teamed up with Kanye West, Nelly Furtado, and Snoop Dogg to design a Nike sneaker for another eBay auction. All proceeds went to AIDS Awareness.[69] In October 2007, Rowland auditioned for the role of Louise, Carrie Bradshaw's assistant, in the 2008 film adaptation of HBO's comedy series Sex and the City. The part eventually went to Jennifer Hudson.[70] Two months later, Rowland appeared as a choirmaster in the first season of the NBC talent show Clash of the Choirs among other musicians such as Michael Bolton, Patti LaBelle, Nick Lachey, and Blake Shelton. Rowland's choir finished fifth in the competition,[71] and Clash of the Choirs did not return for a second season.\n\nIn 2008, Rowland officially became an ambassador for MTV's Staying Alive Foundation, which aims to reduce stigma against people living with HIV and AIDS.[72] She visited projects in Tanzania and Kenya to promote the charity and underwent an HIV test in Africa to raise awareness of the disease.[73] In 2009, Rowland connected with Serve.MTV.com, MTV's platform to connect young people with local volunteerism opportunities, for a series of on-air PSAs. From battling homelessness to beautifying impoverished neighborhoods to saving whales, Rowland was joined by the likes of Cameron Diaz, will.i.am, and Sean Kingston as they discuss causes they volunteer to support and urge young people to join with their friends in making civic service a part of their lifestyle.[74] That same year, she spearheaded a bone marrow drive,[75] and joined fellow singers Alesha Dixon and Pixie Lott to create T-shirts for River Island in aid of the Prince's Trust, profits from which help change young lives.[76]\n\nIn January 2009, Rowland ended her professional relationship with Beyoncé's father, Mathew Knowles, who had managed her career since she was a member of Destiny's Child. Knowles stressed that no animosity was involved in the decision and acknowledged that Rowland will always be a part of the Knowles family.[77] Then two months later, Rowland announced that she left Columbia Records, adding that she \"felt the need to explore new directions, new challenges, and new freedoms outside my comfort zone.\"[78] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Rowland stated that the label ended her contract because Ms. Kelly was not commercially successful.[79] She later signed with Universal Motown Records.[80]\n\nIn April 2009, Rowland was featured on David Guetta's single \"When Love Takes Over\", which topped many charts in Europe, selling over 5,5 million copies worldwide,[81][82][83] and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance Recording.[84][85] Billboard crowned the song as the number one dance-pop collaboration of all time.[86] In May 2009, Rowland was cast to host the first season of Bravo's reality competition series The Fashion Show alongside Isaac Mizrahi,[87] but was replaced by fashion model Iman in the second season.[88]\n\nIn 2010, Kelly Rowland launched I Heart My Girlfriends, a charity that focuses on self-esteem, date violence prevention, community service, abstinence, sports, drug/alcohol/smoking avoidance, obesity, disabilities, and education.[89] In April 2010, Rowland toured Australia alongside Akon, Pitbull, Sean Paul, Jay Sean, and Eve for the Australian urban festival, Supafest.[90] Later that month, her song \"Everywhere You Go\", featuring an all-star supergroup of international artists called Rhythm of Africa United, was released as the MTN theme song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[91] In October 2010, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) honored Rowland at the second annual ASCAP Presents Women Behind the Music, an event that recognizes women in all areas of the music industry.[92] Rowland's first compilation album, Work: The Best of Kelly Rowland, was released on October 25, 2010, but failed to impact the charts.[93]\n\nIn January 2011, Rowland reunited with Nelly on \"Gone\", a sequel to their successful 2002 collaboration \"Dilemma\".[94] Upon its release, the song failed to reprise the success of \"Dilemma\". In April 2011, Rowland appeared on Italian DJ Alex Gaudino's single \"What a Feeling\", which became another UK top-ten hit. During this time, Rowland's boyfriend (and future husband), Tim Weatherspoon, became her manager.[95] Originally scheduled for release in 2010, Rowland's third studio album Here I Am was released on July 26, 2011, in the United States. The album sold 77,000 copies in its first week[96] and debuted atop the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.[97][98] Here I Am produced the successful lead single \"Commander\", which peaked in the top-ten of many charts in Europe, and the UK top-ten single \"Down for Whatever\". It also included another successful single \"Motivation\", with Lil Wayne, which topped the R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for seven consecutive weeks and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[44][99][100] \"Motivation\" won Song of the Year at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards[101] and Top R&B Song at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards,[102] and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.[103] Rowland was the face of Diddy's women's fragrance Empress, the female counterpart to his men's fragrance I Am King.[104] She was also the worldwide ambassador for watchmakers company TW Steel.[105] Rowland's second compilation album, Playlist: the Very Best of Kelly Rowland, was released on October 18, 2011, but failed to impact the charts. She also released her first fitness DVD titled Sexy Abs with Kelly Rowland.[106] Later that year, it was confirmed that Rowland would replace Dannii Minogue as a judge for the eighth series of The X Factor UK alongside Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow (who replaced Simon Cowell), and Tulisa (who replaced Cheryl Cole).[107] Rowland's team of finalists in the \"Girls\" category, including Amelia Lily, finished in third place in one series. Rowland would also later be revealed as the judge who formed the girl group Little Mix.[108] Due to a conflicting schedule, Rowland did not return for the ninth series in 2012 and was replaced by former judge of The X Factor USA, Nicole Scherzinger.[109] During the Black Women in Music event held on February 8, 2012, Essence magazine honored Rowland and music executive Sylvia Rhone for their contributions to music.[110] In April 2012, Rowland toured Australia alongside Ludacris, Chris Brown, Trey Songz, T-Pain, Ice Cube, Lupe Fiasco, and Big Sean for the urban festival, Supafest.[111] That same month, she returned to the big screen playing the supporting role of Brenda in the romantic comedy Think Like a Man.[112] The film, which also starred Michael Ealy, Jerry Ferrara, Meagan Good, Regina Hall, and Kevin Hart, topped the US box office and grossed $91.5 million.[113] Rowland recorded \"Need a Reason\" with Future and Bei Maejor for the Think Like a Man soundtrack.[114]\n\nIn June 2012, Rowland became the face of popular rum brand Bacardi. Rowland and German production team Project B reworked the Bacardi song, \"Bacardi Feeling (Summer Dreamin')\", and released an accompanying music video to help promote the brand.[115][116] In August 2012, Rowland became a dance master in the first season of the Australian talent show Everybody Dance Now alongside Jason Derulo.[117] The show was canceled after the fourth episode due to poor ratings.[118]\n\nIn January 2013, Destiny's Child released a compilation album titled Love Songs, a collection of romance-themed songs from their previous albums, as well as the newly recorded song \"Nuclear\".[119] On February 3, 2013, during Beyoncé's performance at the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, held at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Rowland and Michelle Williams joined her on stage to perform \"Bootylicious\", \"Independent Women\" and \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\".[120] On February 24, 2013, Rowland co-hosted the Academy Awards pre-show for the 85th Academy Awards alongside Kristin Chenoweth, Lara Spencer, Robin Roberts, and Jess Cagle. In May 2013, it was announced that Rowland would replace L.A. Reid as a judge on The X Factor USA for its third and final season, joining Simon Cowell, Demi Lovato, and fellow new judge Paulina Rubio (who was replacing Britney Spears). Rowland's finalists from the \"Over 25s\", including Jeff Gutt, finished as the runner-up on this final season. On The X Factor USA, Rowland had more success and popularity as a judge than The X Factor UK. Later that month, Rowland performed as a supporting headlining act at the RiverFest 2013 in Little Rock, Arkansas. Rowland embarked on the Lights Out Tour, a co-headlining tour with The-Dream, to promote her fourth studio album Talk a Good Game.[121] Formerly titled Year of the Woman,[122] the album was released on June 18, 2013, in the US. It is Rowland's first release with Republic Records following Universal Music Group's decision to close Universal Motown and Universal Republic and reviving Motown Records and Republic Records. Talk a Good Game sold 68,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, becoming Rowland's third top-ten album in the US.[123] The album's lead single \"Kisses Down Low\" was a moderate success on the US R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and was certified gold by RIAA for exceeded 500,000 copies sold. The second and final single was \"Dirty Laundry\". In December 2013, Rowland appeared in Beyoncé's \"Grown Woman\" music video and alongside Williams in Beyoncé's \"Superpower\" music video and provided backing vocals on the same track, taken from her self-titled fifth studio album.[124]\n\nIn February 2014, Rowland was featured on Joe's single \"Love & Sex Part 2\".[125] In March 2014, she was named a spokesperson for cosmetic company Caress.[126] During an interview with HuffPost Live on March 26, 2014, Rowland revealed that she has begun recording her fifth studio album and said the new music, which encompasses horns, drums, and flutes, was influenced by iconic female singers including Diana Ross.[127] Rowland also announced in the interview that she left Republic Records, adding that she \"just needed a fresh, new start.\"[127] In June 2014, Rowland and Beyoncé were featured on Williams' single \"Say Yes\".[128] The same month, her song \"The Game\" and its music video appeared on Pepsi's visual album for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, titled Beats of the Beautiful Game.[129] On July 19, 2014, Rowland was featured on Adrian Marcel's song \"Honey\" from his mixtape Weak After Next[130] and on Beau Vallis's song \"Love Stand Still\".[131] Rowland also contributed background vocals to the song \"You're My Star\", the first single released from Tank's 2014 album Stronger.[132][133]\n\nIn August 2015, she was featured on Jacob Whitesides's single \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\".[134] Rowland was part of the recurring cast of the second season of the television series Empire.
