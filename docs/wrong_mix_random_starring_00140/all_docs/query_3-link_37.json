The annual primetime special shares stories of foster care adoption and has featured performances from some of America’s most popular music artists, including Gwen Stefani, Kelly Clarkson, Faith Hill, Jennifer Hudson, Mariah Carey and more.\n\nIn between musical acts, the stories of amazing families brought together through foster care adoption are shared. Thousands of people have been inspired to seek more information on becoming an adoptive parent as a direct result of A Home for the Holidays."
