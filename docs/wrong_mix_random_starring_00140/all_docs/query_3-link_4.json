        "text": "Family, giving back, togetherness, unity…all of these things create the foundation that brought the organization, Our Own, to the attention of filmmaker and philanthropist Jake Viramontez. Our Own is a Los Angeles-based nonprofit with a multifaceted approach to further bridging the gap to ensure racial equity and social justice. The community-centric organization was a major inspiration for Sony’s Create Action program and shows the importance of locally-based organizations that work to build strong and consistent impact for underserved communities. Our Own’s hard work continues to gain momentum, and you can catch a segment featuring the organization this week on The Kelly Clarkson Show on Thursday, January 26, at 2:00 PM PST.\n\nOur Own co-founders Dustin Young and Lee Johnson with filmmaker Jake Viramontez on the Kelly Clarkson show.\n\nDuring the Kelly Clarkson show, Our Own received a second surprise grant of $50,000 and $15,000 in gear from Sony to support the work they're doing within their Los Angeles community.\n\nSocial entrepreneurs and cultural producers Dustin Young and Lee Johnson founded and have led Our Own since 2018. As big believers in the power of community and the concept of the village, they developed the organization with a mission to dismantle systemic barriers and create the access needed in nutrition, education, entrepreneurship, maternal health, mental and physical fitness."
