        "text": "Noah Kahan will bring the We’ll All Be Here Forever Tour with special guest James Bay to The Garden on July 15 & 16.\n\n$1 from each ticket will be donated to The Busyhead Project, a fund at the Vermont Community Foundation, which Noah created to support organizations delivering mental health treatment and providing access to care.\n\nAs Noah Kahan changes, he casts those experiences onto songs like light through a film projector. At the core of the music’s upbeat energy and unfiltered lyrics, you’ll hear who he was before and who he became-almost in real-time. The Vermont singer still pens songs straight from the heart and still cracks jokes with his signature, self-deprecating sense of humor; he’s just changed in all of the right ways (and chronicled them via his songwriting). He gained that understanding through quite the journey from small town Vermont to global renown. He’s racked up over two billion streams, released three full length albums (Busyhead, 2019; I Was / I Am, 2021; Stick Season, 2022) and a mid-pandemic EP (Cape Elizabeth, 2020), picked up a Platinum Certification for “Stick Season” and Gold Certification for “Hurt Somebody” feat. Julia Michaels, and performed on television shows such as Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Late Night with Seth Meyers, TODAY, and The Kelly Clarkson Show. After 5 years of critical acclaim and global touring, he sought an even purer style of writing and arrangement inspired by his New England roots, a challenge from within to convey a vivid representation of what he loves, fears, and struggles with most passionately. The result is Noah’s latest critically acclaimed album Stick Season, which features his viral hit single “Stick Season.” The album is Certified Gold and has sold over 500 thousand units to date. Following the album release, Noah embarked on the first two legs of his sold-out “Stick Season Tour” across North America, which continues this summer, where he’s playing his biggest venues to date, including the iconic Radio City Music Hall, The Greek Theatre, and Red Rocks Amphitheatre. In June, Kahan released the extended version of 2022’s celebrated album, Stick Season (We’ll All Be Here Forever), which includes seven new songs and his latest single “Dial Drunk.” The release became his most successful offering yet-topping the charts, amassing millions of streams, receiving a slew of critical acclaim, and cementing Noah Kahan as the biggest breakout artist of the year.\n\nWhere to Enter\n\nPlease plan to arrive early!
