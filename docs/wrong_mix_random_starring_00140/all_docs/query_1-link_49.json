        "text": "To assess whether the key effectors of the TGFβ signalling pathway are expressed in naïve hPSCs and to evaluate the cell heterogeneity in their expression (Figure 1a; Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b), we performed single cell transcriptomic analysis (scRNA-seq) in naïve and primed hPSCs (Figure 1b; Figure 1—figure supplement 1c). As expected, naïve and primed hPSCs clustered separately based on their transcriptomes. All cells expressed pan-pluripotency genes, such as POU5F1 (also known as OCT4), NANOG and SOX2, however, naïve cells uniquely expressed known naïve cell markers, such as DPPA5 and KLF4, and primed cells expressed CD24 and ZIC2 (Figure 1c,d; Figure 1—figure supplement 1c). In addition, differential expression analysis confirmed the specific expression of naïve hPSCs genes, such as KLF4, DPPA3, and TFCP2L1, and primed hPSCs factors including DUSP6, ZIC2, and TCF4 (Figure 1d). Importantly, we found that most TGFβ pathway effectors, such as Activin receptors (ACVRs) and SMAD2-4, are expressed at similar levels in both pluripotent cell types (Figure 1e). Interestingly, several components, including NODAL and GDF3, have higher expression levels in naïve compared to primed hPSCs (Figure 1e).\n\nFigure 1—source data 1\n\nFull uncropped western blot from Figure 1h and Figure 1—figure supplement 1e reporting TGFβ pathway activation in primed H9 cells (cultured in E8 medium) and in three naïve hPSC lines cultured in t2iLGö medium: embryo-derived HNES1, chemically reset cR-H9, and transgene-reset H9 NK2 naïve cells.\n\nhttps://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/67259/elife-67259-fig1-data1-v1.pdf\n\nWe next examined RNA-seq datasets that covered different stages of human pluripotency in stem cell lines and in embryos (Figure 1f). We first compared naïve and primed hPSCs (Collier et al., 2017) and, consistent with our scRNA-seq data, we found that most ligands, transduction proteins and receptors of the TGFβ pathway are expressed at similar levels in the two cell types (Figure 1f). Higher expression of the TGFβ ligands NODAL and GDF3 and the co-receptor TDGF1 was again detected in naïve hPSCs. Interestingly, the expression of pathway inhibitors differed, whereby LEFTY1 and LEFTY2 were higher in naïve hPSCs, whereas CER1 and FST were higher in primed hPSCs. We then looked at gene expression changes that occur during the process of capacitation, because the transition from naïve to primed hPSCs recapitulates pre- to post-implantation epiblast cell development (Rostovskaya et al., 2019). We found that most of the effectors of the TGFβ pathway are expressed throughout the entire developmental series, and also confirmed that NODAL and GDF3 are expressed at higher levels in the early stages (Figure 1f).\n\nTo examine transcriptional events directly in human embryos, we next looked at scRNA-seq data in human pre-implantation embryos from day 3 to day 7 (Petropoulos et al., 2016). Low level expression of most TGFβ pathway effectors was detected in the early inner cell mass (ICM), and their expression increased substantially in the pre-implantation epiblast (EPI). In particular, NODAL and GDF3 are highly expressed in EPI at this stage, similar to the transcriptional patterns in naïve hPSCs (Figure 1f). However, in contrast to EPI, most pathway components are undetectable in trophectoderm (TE and early TE), and are expressed at low levels in primitive endoderm (PE) (Figure 1f). These observations were extended by examining the expression of TGFβ pathway genes in a blastocyst-culture system that recapitulates EPI development from pre-implantation to early gastrulation (Xiang et al., 2020). Here, in EPI cells at 6 days post-fertilisation, NODAL, GDF3 and the NODAL co-receptor TDGF1 are highly expressed, in line with the EPI stage from the Petropoulos et al. dataset, and the high expression of these genes is sustained in all EPI cells over the following eight days of development (Figure 1f). Taken together, these results show that most ligands, transduction proteins and receptors of the TGFβ pathway are expressed at similar levels in naïve and primed hPSCs, and that this expression pattern across pluripotent states is also observed in human embryos cultured in vitro.\n\nTo further confirm these observations at the protein level, we examined cell-surface proteomic (Wojdyla et al., 2020) and whole-cell proteomic (Di Stefano et al., 2018) data in naïve and primed hPSCs. This revealed that most Activin/TGFβ receptors and downstream effectors of the pathways are expressed at very similar levels in the two cell types (Figure 1g; Figure 1—figure supplement 1d). Finally, to directly assess TGFβ pathway activation, we performed western blot analysis and found that phospho-SMAD2 (pSMAD2), the activated form of SMAD2, is detectable in multiple embryo-derived and reprogrammed naïve hPSCs lines, and at comparable levels to primed cells (Figure 1h; Figure 1—figure supplement 1e,f). The phosphorylation signal was rapidly diminished following the treatment of the cells with SB-431542 (SB), a potent and selective inhibitor that blocks TGFβ/Activin receptors ALK5, ALK4, and ALK7 (Inman et al., 2002; Figure 1h; Figure 1—figure supplement 1e,f). Taken together, these results establish that the TGFβ signalling pathway is active in naïve hPSCs. Because primed hPSCs rely on this pathway to maintain pluripotency, our findings raise the possibility that naïve hPSCs might also require TGFβ signalling to sustain their undifferentiated state.\n\nHaving established that the TGFβ signalling pathway is active in naïve hPSCs, we next profiled the genome-wide occupancy of the main downstream effectors – SMAD2/3 – using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with genome-wide sequencing (ChIP-seq) in naïve and primed hPSCs. This analysis revealed that SMAD2/3 binding is enriched in naïve cells to a similar degree as in primed cells, as shown by independent peak calling in the two cell types (Figure 2a; Figure 2—figure supplement 1a). Here, we observed regions bound by SMAD2/3 in both cell types, and also a substantial number of loci that appear to have cell-type-specific binding. Importantly, canonical target genes, such as LEFTY1/2, NODAL, NANOG, and SMAD7, were bound by SMAD2/3 in both cell types (Figure 2b; Figure 2—figure supplement 1b), suggesting that TGFβ is active and it signals through the canonical cascade in both naïve and primed hPSCs.\n\nIn addition to the shared targets, differential binding analyses revealed over 2000 SMAD2/3-bound sites that differed between the two cell types (Figure 2c,d; Figure 2—figure supplement 1c,d). Excitingly, further examination of these differential sites revealed that in naïve hPSCs SMAD2/3 uniquely bound near to naïve-specific pluripotency genes including DNMT3L, TFAP2C, CBFA2T2, KLF4, and CDK19 (Figure 2e; Figure 2—figure supplement 1d,e). Interestingly, these sites often overlapped with accessible chromatin regions and H3K27ac marks, which are signatures that are associated with active enhancers (Heintzman et al., 2009; Figure 2e; Figure 2—figure supplement 1e). In contrast, primed-specific SMAD2/3 sites were located near to genes that regulate mesendoderm differentiation, such as TBXT, EOMES, and GATA4, or primed-state pluripotency, such as OTX2 (Figure 2e; Figure 2—figure supplement 1e). These sites correspond mostly to accessible chromatin and to regions marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 signals, which typically mark the promoters of developmental genes (Azuara et al., 2006; Bernstein et al., 2006; Heintzman et al., 2009; Figure 2e; Figure 2—figure supplement 1e). These findings are supported by global analysis using ChromHMM-based chromatin state annotations (Chovanec et al., 2021), where we found that most SMAD2/3 peaks are indeed within active chromatin regions, consisting mainly of gene promoters and enhancers (Figure 2f). Interestingly, naïve-specific SMAD2/3 peaks are slightly more enriched at active enhancers compared to primed-specific peaks (30.6% vs 21.4%), and primed-specific SMAD2/3 peaks are instead more enriched at promoters (46% vs 26.5%) (Figure 2f; Figure 2—figure supplement 1f).\n\nThere are widespread differences in enhancer activity between naïve and primed hPSCs (Barakat et al., 2018; Battle et al., 2019; Chovanec et al., 2021) and so to determine how changes in SMAD2/3 occupancy tracks with enhancer status we compared chromatin marks at naïve-specific SMAD2/3 sites between the two cell types. The vast majority of sites that lose SMAD2/3 occupancy in primed hPSCs also show a strong reduction in chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac/H3K4me1 signals, which suggests that SMAD2/3-bound enhancers are decommissioned in primed hPSCs (Figure 2g). Chromatin marks that denote promoters and heterochromatin regions are generally low at naïve-specific SMAD2/3 sites and are largely unchanged in primed hPSCs, further reinforcing the connection between SMAD2/3 occupancy and active enhancers in naïve hPSCs (Figure 2h).\n\nTo obtain a more complete view of the pluripotency transcriptional network, we also overlapped SMAD2/3 peaks in naïve cells with OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (OSN) binding (Chovanec et al., 2021). We found that OSN signals were strongly reduced at naïve-specific SMAD2/3 sites in primed hPSCs, confirming the integration of SMAD2/3 within the naïve transcription factor network (Figure 2i). Importantly, regions bound by SMAD2/3 and OSN overlapped with state-specific enhancers that are marked by open chromatin and H3K27ac, as shown for the KLF4 and DNMT3L loci in naïve hPSCs, and for OTX2 and TBXT in primed hPSCs (Figure 2e). Finally, to further characterise the differentially bound loci, we performed differential motif enrichment to investigate whether different binding partners might regulate SMAD2/3 binding in naïve and primed cells. Interestingly, motifs that are relatively enriched at SMAD2/3 sites in naïve compared to primed cells included NF2L1 (also known as NRF1), TFAP2A/C, KLF4 and FOXH1 (Figure 2j).\n\nAltogether, these data suggest that SMAD2/3, the main effector of TGFβ pathway, is integrated in the naïve pluripotency network by targeting OSN-bound active enhancers that are in close proximity to key regulators of naïve pluripotency.\n\nAfter establishing that the TGFβ signalling pathway could maintain directly the transcriptional network characterising human pluripotency, spanning from naïve to primed states, we next examined whether the pathway is functionally required to sustain naïve hPSCs in an undifferentiated state. We first measured the transcriptional changes that occurred in response to SB-mediated loss of pSMAD2 and inhibition of the TGFβ pathway (Figure 3a; Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,b). After only 2 hours of SB treatment (t2iLGö medium supplemented with SB), naïve hPSCs showed a significant reduction in the expression of the pluripotency gene NANOG, which is a short time frame that is consistent with NANOG being a direct target of SMAD2/3 signalling (Vallier et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2008; Figure 3a; Figure 3—figure supplement 1a). Other canonical downstream target genes, such as LEFTY1/2 and SMAD7, were also strongly downregulated and their expression was completely abolished after 24 hr in the case of LEFTY1/2. Excitingly, naïve pluripotency marker genes that are bound by SMAD2/3 including DPPA3, DPPA5, KLF4, and DNMT3L were also downregulated following SB treatment, indicating that the naïve state is disrupted in these conditions (Figure 3a; Figure 3—figure supplement 1a). These results were independently validated by depleting SMAD2/3 expression using the OPTiKD system (Bertero et al., 2016). Here, we generated stable naïve hPSCs with tetracycline (TET) inducible co-expression of shRNAs that target SMAD2 and SMAD3 transcripts (Figure 3b). Treating these cells with TET induced the rapid loss of SMAD2/3 mRNA (Figure 3c), and a concomitant and significant downregulation in the expression of SMAD2/3 target genes, such as LEFTY2, NODAL, and NANOG (Figure 3c). We also detected a significant decrease in POU5F1 expression following SMAD2/3 knockdown and after SB treatment, suggesting that naïve hPSCs are destabilised and are exiting the pluripotent state (Figure 3a,c).\n\nInterestingly, adding SB to naïve culture media also induced a change in cell morphology whereby naïve hPSCs lost their typical dome-shaped morphology after 3 to 5 days, and this was accompanied by the appearance of flat colonies that gradually took over the culture (Figure 3d; Figure 3—figure supplement 1c). This striking phenotypic change was confirmed in a second naïve hPSCs line (Figure 3—figure supplement 1d). Intriguingly, the morphology of these flat colonies resembles human trophoblast cells (Okae et al., 2018). To further investigate this, we grew naïve hPSCs for 14 days in the presence of SB and then examined the expression of trophoblast marker genes (Figure 3e). We found there was a strong upregulation in the expression of the trophectoderm marker HAND1 and also of TP63, MMP2, and SDC1 that mark cytotrophoblast (CTB), extravillous trophoblast (EVT) and syncytiotrophoblast (STB) cell types, respectively (Figure 3e). These results were further supported by the clear reduction in NANOG protein expression following 3–5 days of treating naïve hPSCs with SB, in correspondence with the exit from naïve pluripotency and the appearance of the trophoblast-like colonies (Figure 3f). NANOG downregulation together with the appearance of trophoblast-like colonies was also observed in a second naïve cell line upon SB treatment (Figure 3—figure supplement 1e). Importantly, the flat cell colonies also expressed typical trophoblast-associated proteins – GATA3 and HAND1 (Figure 3g; Figure 3—figure supplement 1f,g).\n\nTo further characterise these cells and to investigate their ability to differentiate into trophoblast derivatives, we cultured naïve hPSCs in the presence of SB for 5 days and then transferred the cells into trophoblast stem cell (TSC) media (Dong et al., 2020; Okae et al., 2018). Although the cell population initially appeared heterogeneous, following exposure to TSC conditions the cells rapidly and uniformly acquired a homogeneous TSC-like morphology. The cells expressed TSC markers, such as GATA3 and CK19 (Figure 3h) and CK7, ITGA6, and TP63 (Figure 3i), and could be passaged and maintained in these conditions with stable growth and morphology. Naïve-derived TSCs were then induced to differentiate by switching the cells to STB and EVT media (Dong et al., 2020). This led to the downregulation of TSC genes and the upregulation of STB and EVT markers, such as SDC1 and HLA-G, respectively (Figure 3h,i).\n\nTaken together, these results show that blocking TGFβ signalling in naïve hPSCs rapidly destabilises the pluripotency network and allows the cells to undergo differentiation toward trophoblast-like cells, including those that can give rise to multipotent, proliferative TSCs.\n\nWe next sought to investigate the processes in which TGFβ pathway inhibition drives naïve hPSCs out of their pluripotent state and towards a trophoblast phenotype. Following SB treatment, we observed that the early-stage cultures contained a heterogeneous mixture of cell morphologies that included naïve-like colonies and the flat, TSC-like colonies described above (Figure 3d; Figure 3—figure supplement 1c,d). The proportion of NANOG-positive cells declined following SB treatment, with variable expression within individual colonies (Figure 3f). We also observed heterogeneous colonies that contained cells expressing the pluripotency marker OCT4 and TSC-like markers HAND1/GATA3 (Figure 3g). Because the population heterogeneity could mask important changes in cell phenotype, we used scRNA-seq to examine the effect of TGFβ inhibition over 7 days of SB treatment in naïve hPSCs (Figure 4a). In addition, to better characterise the divergent developmental potential between different human pluripotent states, we compared this response to the response when primed hPSCs were treated with SB. Our aim was to investigate the trajectory of naïve hPSCs moving into a putative TSC-like population, in contrast with the neuroectodermal differentiation that is induced in primed hPSCs when TGFβ is inhibited (Vallier et al., 2009).\n\nIn both cell types, there was a clear transcriptional trajectory moving from day 0 to day 7 of SB treatment (Figure 4b; Figure 4—figure supplement 1a). Importantly, there was little overlap in their trajectories (Figure 4c), confirming that the inhibition of TGFβ signalling in these two different developmental stages results in divergent differentiation processes. Louvain clustering of the combined datasets also showed separated clusters in the naïve and primed time course samples (Figure 4—figure supplement 1b). Specifically, TGFβ inhibition in naïve hPSCs induced the expression of TSC-like markers, such as HAND1, GATA2, and GATA3, whereas inhibition in primed hPSCs induced neuroectoderm markers, such as SOX10, PAX6, and LEF1 (Figure 4d; Figure 4—figure supplement 1c). Interestingly, Louvain clustering of the naïve cell dataset initially follows the day 0 (Cluster A) and day 1 (Cluster B) timepoints and then resolves the mixed population at days 3, 5, and 7 into three separate clusters (C, D, and E) (Figure 4e; Figure 4—figure supplement 1d). This analysis suggests that the mixed population is formed from an early differentiating population (cluster C), a transition population (cluster D), and a later-stage differentiated population (cluster E), thereby confirming a stepwise process marked by different intermediate stages.\n\nExamining individual genes revealed the dynamics of the differentiation trajectory. Pan-pluripotency and naïve-specific genes showed a gradient in their expression patterns, starting from high expression in cluster A, diminishing levels in clusters B and C, then largely absent in clusters D and E (Figure 4f,g). In contrast, trophoblast genes become activated in clusters C, D, and E, with CDX2, HAND1 and GATA3 marking early, transition and late-stage differentiating populations, respectively (Figure 4f,g). NODAL and LEFTY1 are expressed predominantly in cluster A and were rapidly downregulated already in cluster B (Figure 4f,g), and other TGFβ pathway genes, such as GDF3 and TDGF1, are fully downregulated when cells start transitioning towards cluster D. These results confirm the effective pathway inhibition and also that blocking TGFβ signalling allows trophectoderm differentiation.\n\nTo better characterise the Louvain clusters, we examined the top 25 genes that are differentially expressed in each cluster compared to all other clusters (Figure 4g; Figure 4—figure supplement 1e,f). Differentially expressed genes that are associated with cluster A, which corresponds largely to cells at day 0, include NANOG and SUSD2 (Bredenkamp et al., 2019a; Wojdyla et al., 2020) in addition to the TGFβ ligand GDF3 and receptor TDFG1. Interestingly, the SMAD2/3-cofactor FOXH1 was also identified in this category and this is consistent with our prior motif analysis of the SMAD2/3 ChIP-seq data that identified FOXH1 as a putative interactor of SMAD2/3 specifically in naïve cells (Figure 2j). Genes that are differentially expressed in cluster B are enriched for metallothioneins, such as MT1/2 s, which affect cell respiration, in addition to mitochondrial genes – SLIRP and MTNDL4 – and the glucose pyrophosphorylase UGP2, suggesting that an initial response to TGFβ inhibition could involve a metabolic switch (Mathieu and Ruohola-Baker, 2017). Cells in cluster C still express pluripotency markers, such as POU5F1 and DPPA5, and have upregulated the non-coding RNAs MEG3 and MEG8. Cluster D clearly marks a transition population towards TSC-like cells, with the expression of CDX1 and CDX2, keratins (KRT8, KRT18), and MARCKS, FABP5, and EZR (Cambuli et al., 2014; Ralston et al., 2010). Cluster E includes keratins (KRT8, KRT18, KRT19), several main regulators of trophoblast development, such as GATA2 and GATA3 (Ralston et al., 2010), and human-specific regulators, such as VGLL1 (Soncin et al., 2018). Lastly, because recent studies have highlighted a transcriptional overlap between trophoblast and amnion cells (Guo et al., 2021; Io et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021), we examined whether genes reported to be expressed by amnion cells were upregulated in our dataset. We found that most of the amnion-associated genes examined were not detectable in any of the clusters (Figure 4—figure supplement 1g). Some markers, such as CTSV and TPM1, are expressed in both amnion and trophoblast, and as expected were upregulated in cluster E (Figure 4—figure supplement 1g). Although it is currently challenging to separate the transcriptional profiles of trophoblast and amnion cells, this analysis suggests that TGFβ inhibition of naïve hPSCs in these conditions does not promote the induction of reported amnion cell markers. Taken together, these results confirm that TGFβ inhibition downregulates a pluripotency program and enables trophectoderm differentiation from naïve hPSCs.\n\nTo dissect the impact of TGFβ pathway inhibition on the transcriptional changes, we overlapped cluster A and E gene expression profiles with SMAD2/3 ChIP-seq peaks. We found that a small subset of differentially expressed genes have a nearby SMAD2/3 peak (Figure 4h). Of note, many of the strongest peaks are close to differentially expressed genes, and this was especially clear for genes that are downregulated upon SB treatment (Figure 4i). Interestingly, among the downregulated genes, we found that SMAD2/3 bind within 12 kb of the transcriptional start sites of TGFβ downstream effectors (NODAL, LEFTY1/2, PMEPA1), key genes associated with naïve pluripotency (DNMT3L, DPPA4, AIRE, ID1), genes reported to inhibit trophoblast differentiation (NLRP7, TET1) (Alici-Garipcan et al., 2020; Dawlaty et al., 2011; Koh et al., 2011; Mahadevan et al., 2014), and also near to distal enhancers for other factors, such as KLF4 and DEPTOR (Figure 4h). Although less prevalent, we also found SMAD2/3 binding sites close to some genes that are transcriptionally upregulated between cluster A and E, including EFNB2 and FOS, and to enhancers close to PGF and MFAP5. To further assess the significance of this association, we tested how often differentially expressed genes between clusters A and E are the closest gene to a SMAD2/3 peak. Strikingly, 21% of downregulated genes are the closest gene to a SMAD2/3 binding site, which is significantly higher than the 7% of genes in a randomly-selected group of size-matched control genes (p<2.2x1016, Figure 4j). These results suggest that the downregulation of pluripotency-associated genes following TGFβ inhibition is functionally linked to the loss of SMAD2/3 binding.\n\nTaken together, scRNA-seq in primed and naïve cells shows that both developmental stages rely on TGFβ signalling to maintain their undifferentiated state but, upon pathway inhibition, each cell type diverges towards different trajectories. Primed cells differentiate into neuroectoderm cells whereas, in contrast, naïve cells exit pluripotency and acquire a TSC-like fate expressing trophoblast markers and this is triggered by the deregulation of target genes that are downstream of SMAD2/3.\n\nHaving established that naïve hPSCs respond to TGFβ inhibition by shutting down the naïve pluripotency network, thereby allowing the onset of trophoblast differentiation, we next investigated whether this differentiation process follows a developmental trajectory. To do this, we applied diffusion pseudotime to our 10X scRNA-seq data (Figure 5—figure supplement 1a) and examined the pseudotime trajectory across the Louvain clusters (Figure 5a). Consistent with the prior UMAP analysis, we found that the time points (days) and the clusters progressively populate the trajectory following a similar pattern from cluster A, through B and C, towards a transition population in cluster D, and lastly the more differentiated counterpart in cluster E (Figure 5a). Overlaying the diffusion pseudotime maps with the expression of known markers reveals the initial downregulation of pluripotency genes, such as NANOG, was followed by a sequential upregulation of trophoblast markers, such as CDX2, HAND1, and GATA3 (Figure 5b; Figure 5—figure supplement 1b). Interestingly, the transitional cell population in cluster D contains a substantial proportion of cells (~15–25%) that co-express low levels of the pluripotency gene POU5F1 and trophoblast markers, such as CDX2 and HAND1 (Figure 5c). We confirmed this co-expression at the protein level using immunofluorescent microscopy (Figure 5—figure supplement 1c). These results indicate that trophoblast cells arise in the population through the transition of pluripotent cells to a trophoblast fate.\n\nTo further investigate the transition from naïve pluripotency to trophoblast specification, we compared our scRNA-seq data to human embryo transcriptional datasets (Xiang et al., 2020). Correlation analysis showed that cells in clusters A, B, and C are transcriptionally closest to epiblast cells, in keeping with their undifferentiated status (Figure 5—figure supplement 1d). The transitional population classified as cluster D has the highest correlation with ICM and TE (Figure 5—figure supplement 1d). Cells in cluster E have the highest correlation with trophoblast derivatives from the pre- and early-postimplantation embryo (Figure 5—figure supplement 1d).\n\nWe next focussed our analysis on the main pluripotent cell population (cluster A), the transitioning cells (cluster D) and the differentiated cells (cluster E). We compared these clusters with the embryo cell types that showed the highest transcriptional correlations to them (Figure 5d; Figure 5—figure supplement 1d). Visualising single cell transcriptomes for each cell type on a PCA plot revealed there was a good overlap between our stem cell differentiation series and the embryo lineages (Figure 5e), further supporting a transition from EPI to the trophoblast lineage. We then used the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test to identify marker genes for each embryo lineage and examined the expression pattern of those genes in cells across clusters A, D, and E. Interestingly, the two datasets have remarkably similar expression patterns, whereby the progression from clusters A to D to E closely resembles the transcriptional changes from EPI to trophoblast (Figure 5f). Among the top 20 genes per cluster (Figure 5—figure supplement 1e), we found genes, such as NANOG and DPPA5 for cluster A / EPI, and trophoblast markers, such as VGLL1 and PGF for cluster E / trophoblast, and confirmed their expression at the single cell level over the differentiation pseudotime (Figure 5g). Taken together, these results reveal that TGFβ inhibition of naïve hPSCs causes the cells to initiate a differentiation programme from pluripotency to TE-like cells and trophoblast derivatives, activating transcriptional identities similar to the embryo counterpart.\n\nTransgene-reset WA09/H9 NK2, embryo-derived HNES1 and chemically reset cR-H9 naïve hPSCs (Guo et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2016; Takashima et al., 2014) were kindly provided by Dr. Austin Smith with permission from WiCell and the UK Stem Cell Bank Steering Committee. Cells were maintained in t2iLGö (Takashima et al., 2014) or in PXGL (Bredenkamp et al., 2019b; Rostovskaya et al., 2019) in hypoxia (5% O2) at 37°C. The N2B27 base medium contained a 1:1 mixture of DMEM/F12 and Neurobasal, 0.5X N-2 supplement, 0.5X B-27 supplement, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (all from ThermoFisher Scientific), 0.5X Penicillin/Streptomycin. For t2iLGö, the base medium was supplemented with 1 µM PD0325901, 1 µM CHIR99021, 20 ng/ml human LIF (all from WT-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute) and 2 µM Gö6983 (Tocris). For PXGL, N2B27 medium was supplemented with 1 µM PD0325901, 2 µM XAV939, 2 µM Gö6983 and 10 ng/ml human LIF. Naïve hPSCs were maintained on a layer of irradiated mouse fibroblasts that were seeded at a density of two million cells per six-well plate. All experiments have been performed on naïve hPSCs that were grown in the absence of mouse fibroblasts for at least two passages using Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel-coated plates (Corning). For TGFβ inhibition experiments, 20 µM SB-431542 (Tocris) was added to the medium for the specified length of the experiment.\n\nConventional (primed) WA09/H9 (Thomson et al., 1998) were maintained in E8 medium as previously described (Chen et al., 2011) in DMEM/F12, 0.05% Sodium Bicarbonate, 2X Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium solution (all from ThermoFisher Scientific), 64 µg/ml L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (LAA) (Sigma), 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin (WT-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute), 25 ng/ml FGF2 (Hyvönen Group, Dept of Biochemistry), and 2 ng/ml TGFβ (BioTechne) on 10 μg/ml of Vitronectin XF-coated plates (StemCell Technologies) at 37°C. For TGFβ inhibition experiments, 10 µM SB-431542 (Tocris) was added to the media for the specified length of the experiment.\n\nTSCs, EVT, and STB cells were generated as previously described (Dong et al., 2020) with some modifications as follows. WA09/H9 NK2 naïve hPSCs were treated with 10 µM SB-431542 (Tocris) in t2iLGö media for 5 days. Cells were dissociated with TrypLE (ThermoFisher Scientific) and single cells were seeded on Collagen IV-coated plates (5 μg/ml; Sigma) in TSC media (Okae et al., 2018) comprising of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% FBS, 0.5% Penicillin/Streptomycin, 0.3% BSA, 1% ITS-X (all from ThermoFisher Scientific), 1.5 μg/ml L-ascorbic acid (Sigma), 50 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech), 2 μM CHIR99021 (WT-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute), 0.5 μM A83-01 (Tocris), 1 μM SB-431542 (Tocris), 0.8 mM VPA (Sigma), and 5 μM Y-27632 (Cell Guidance Systems) in 5% CO2. The media was changed every 2 days and cells were passaged with TrypLE when ~80% confluent. To induce EVT differentiation, dissociated naïve-derived TSCs were seeded onto plates pre-coated with 1 μg/ml of Collagen IV (Sigma) in EVT basal media comprising DMEM/F12 with 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Penicillin/Streptomycin, 0.3% BSA, 1% ITS-X (all ThermoFisher Scientific), 7.5 μM A83-01 (Tocris), 2.5 μM Y27632 (Cell Guidance Systems) and supplemented with 4% KSR (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 100 ng/ml NRG1 (Cell Signalling). Matrigel (Corning) was added at 2% final concentration shortly after resuspending the cells in the media. On day 3, the media was replaced with EVT basal media supplemented with 4% KSR (ThermoFisher Scientific), and Matrigel (Corning) was added at 0.5% final concentration. On day 6, the media were replaced with EVT basal medium, plus 0.5% Matrigel (Corning). EVTs were cultured for two more days and then collected for analysis. To induce STB differentiation, dissociated TSCs were seeded in STB media comprising DMEM/F12 supplemented with 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Penicillin/Streptomycin, 0.3% BSA, 1% ITS-X (all ThermoFisher Scientific), 2.5 μM Y-27632 (Cell Guidance Systems), 50 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech), 2 μM Forskolin (R&D) and 4% KSR (ThermFisher Scientific) in ultra-low attachment plates to form cell aggregates in suspension. Fresh media was added on day 3, and samples were collected for analysis on day 6.\n\nAuthentication of hPSCs was achieved by confirming the expression of pluripotency genes and protein markers (NANOG and OCT4). Cells were routinely verified as mycoplasma-free using broth and PCR-based assays. The cell lines are not on the list of commonly misidentified cell lines (International Cell Line Authentication Committee).\n\nCell Ranger pipeline (version 3.0.2) was used to align reads to GRCh38 assembly and generate feature-barcode matrices for further gene expression analyses. Quality control, normalisation, dimensionality reduction analyses and all downstream analyses were carried out using the python-based library Scanpy (Wolf et al., 2018). Genes with read counts > 0 in at least three cells and cells expressing at least 200 genes were maintained for downstream analysis. Low-quality cells were removed based on the percentage of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) mapping to the mitochondrial genome and the number of genes detected. Logarithmic normalisation was performed, highly variable genes were selected, the total number of UMIs per cell was regressed out from log-normalised data and the regressed expression values were scaled. The dimensionality reduction was performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the neighborhood graph of cells was calculated using the PCA representation of the scaled data matrix. Clustering was performed on scaled data using the Louvain method. This graph was embedded in two dimensions using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP).\n\nTranscriptional similarity was also quantified at origin and region resolution by estimating the connectivity of data manifold partitions within the partition-based graph abstraction (PAGA) framework. Cluster markers and differentially expressed genes were identified by applying the Wilcoxon-Rank-Sum test. In order to visualise the gradual variation in the transcriptional profile following the differentiation induced by the SB treatment, cells were represented as a pseudo-spatial dimension using the diffusion pseudotime method.\n\nFPKM values for the ICM, EPI, and TE/CTB single-cell RNA-Seq datasets from Xiang et al., 2020 (GSE136447) were extracted and log2 transformed. Similarly, log2 reads per 10 k values from the first 200 cells from the A, D, and E Louvain clusters were also prepared. For PCA analysis, the data was filtered to retain only genes which were expressed in more than 10% of cells in both datasets. PCA was used to separate the cells in the filtered Xiang et al. data, retaining the first and second principal components. The rotations from this analysis were then applied to the Louvain cluster data to project it into the same space (Figure 5e).\n\nFor overall correlation (Figure 5d and Figure 5—figure supplement 1d) the mean log2 FPKM for each condition from the Xiang et al. data was correlated with the summed, log2 FPM values from the Louvain clusters using Pearson's correlation. Only genes with log2 FPKM > 0.2 in any Xiang et al. dataset and raw counts > 2 in any Louvain cluster were used for the calculation.\n\nFor the single-cell heatmaps (Figure 5f), a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to identify marker genes which were significantly (fdr < 0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg correction) enriched in one Xiang et al. scRNA-seq condition relative to the others. We then plotted a heatmap of the expression patterns of the marker genes (columns) in each cell (rows) for both the Xiang et al. and Louvain cluster data, with the cells being ordered by the group to which they belonged. Measures were per-gene z-score normalised log2 FPM."
