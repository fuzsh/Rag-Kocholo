        "text": "I joined Genentech in the summer of 2012 after completing my MPH in epidemiology at San Diego State University and my PhD and postdoctoral studies at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Since joining Genentech, my laboratory has focused on understanding the genetic architecture of common pulmonary and ophthalmic diseases. Here, we are especially interested in looking at disease subtypes through a genetic lens in order to enable the right medication to get to the right patient.\n\nPostdoctoral Mentor\n\nBeing a mentor is one of the most rewarding experiences I have had in science to date. Here at Genentech we are fortunate to have a post-doctoral program focusing on basic research projects. In my lab, we are working on understanding the biologic effect of variants we find that are associated with risk, progression and sub-phenotypes of disease. Merging the large scale human genetic data with novel in vitro and in vivo models will provide illumination on the function of these variants and how they may affect human health.\n\nThe Genentech OMNI Human Genetics group uses information from the human genome to discover and verify candidate biomarkers, to understand disease pathogenesis and heterogeneity, and to discover new drug targets. We are coming at this using several approaches with genetic data from consenting individuals in our clinical trials and through external collaborative studies.\n\nMy laboratory focuses on understanding common ophthalmic diseases, including age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, and pulmonary diseases, such as asthma, COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)."
