        "text": "By the late '90s, southwest Detroit native Angela Reyes had had enough of the gang violence that was wreaking havoc on her community.\n\n“I tell people I was tired of burying kids,” Reyes said. “I was going to funerals all the time.”\n\nThat violence motivated Reyes to establish the Detroit Hispanic Development Corporation (DHDC) in 1997. Founded with the goal of keeping kids and young adults out of gang activity, the nonprofit organization provides mentoring services, educational programs, job training, hot meals, family services and scholarships to some of the city’s most at-risk kids and families. The effort has done so much good that Reyes was recently invited to appear on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" to be featured on its “Rad Humans” segment.\n\nAlthough it’s the first time she has been recognized for her work on national TV, Reyes’ record of service to her community goes back more than 50 years.\n\nBorn in 1954 as the second-oldest of 10 kids, Reyes says being around young people has always been a facet of her life. At 17, she started running summer youth programs for children in her community, offering activities that served as alternatives to gang involvement. But by the '90s, the conflicts had only gotten worse.\n\n“At that particular point in our community in southwest Detroit, we had a lot of gang activity that was happening,” Reyes said. “So we really needed to try to figure out something different.”\n\nIn 1997, Reyes teamed up with four Hispanic-owned auto suppliers who had recently moved their businesses from the suburbs to the southwest Detroit community. With those companies, Reyes secured training and employment opportunities for former gang members.\n\nMore: $1M grant to kick-start child savings accounts for some Michigan families\n\nMore: Major Detroit project adds additional half mile of walkable pathways\n\nThen, together with then-Mayor Dennis Archer and then-police chief Mike McKinnon, she organized a truce between the area’s most prominent gang leaders at Ste. Anne’s Church.\n\n“Getting them into those jobs really made a huge difference,” Reyes said. “These young men and women, who were rivals in the gangs, became co-workers working next to each other. So that really laid the groundwork for a truce between all the gangs and trickled down to the younger kids who were also in gangs.”\n\nThe historic truce served as the launching pad for Reyes’ organization, which she has helmed ever since.\n\nToday, DHDC is a southwest Detroit institution. It serves more than 500 kids per year at its youth center, which houses a robotics program, an urban arts academy, a summer youth program and a youth ambassador scholarship program.\n\nDHDC’s work doesn’t stop at kids, though — it also offers family English language classes, GED training, housing and financial literacy counseling, tattoo removal, and case management and reentry services for formerly incarcerated teens and adults.\n\n“We needed to be able to support the parents and the families in their homes, too,” Reyes said. “So that's why we have a focus now on the entire family.”\n\nPerhaps the most compelling testament to DHDC’s success is its staff: Nearly half are graduates of the organization’s in-house programs, and many are former gang members.\n\nReyes is no stranger to praise for her work: she has been honored by the Detroit Tigers and endowed by the Kresge foundation. But she said getting the call to appear on the nationally syndicated \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" earlier this year “was a little intimidating.”\n\n“I got a call from somebody in their production team about a month ago, saying that they had come across our website and were interested in doing the story about me and the organization,” Reyes said. \"They talked to us a few times, interviewed several of us on the phone &mldr; and then they flew us out. It was kind of a whirlwind.”\n\nOn the show, Reyes appeared alongside Isabell Maynard, an 18-year-old woman and aspiring singer who called Reyes the reason she is alive today. After losing her father to gang violence and her mother to prison when she was just 8 months old, Maynard was taken in by Reyes, who raised and supported her as a family member.\n\nMore: Detroit's Motor City Match awards 12 more small businesses with cash grants\n\n“Thank you for being the light in our community for me and for many others like me,” Maynard said on the show. “Thank you for not giving up on me.”\n\nThe two were met with tears and applause from the audience as well as Clarkson herself, who called Reyes “nothing short of an angel right here on Earth.”\n\n“She’s such a sweetheart,” Reyes said of Clarkson. “And you know, she also had a bit of a struggle, and (faced) challenges growing up. So I think she's a really generous, genuine person. Her whole staff were wonderful.”\n\nReyes was gifted a $15,000 donation by Rad Humans partner Comcast Xfinity, as well as cellphones and a year’s worth of internet service for her family.\n\n“It was very gratifying to know that (Comcast) really believes in the work that we're doing,” Reyes said, adding that the money will help with the center’s planned expansion.\n\n“Even though our building is 28,000 square feet, we have run out of space because we have so many things that are going on,” Reyes said. “Since it's money that we can use however we need it, it goes a lot further (than a grant). It actually makes a big difference.”\n\nFor more information about the Detroit Hispanic Development Corporation, go to dhdc1.org."
