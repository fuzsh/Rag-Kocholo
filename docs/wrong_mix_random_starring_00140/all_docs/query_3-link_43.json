        "text": "Staff Sergeant Corban Lundborg, a reserve combat photojournalist with the 4th Combat Camera Squadron, will appear on The Kelly Clarkson Show Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\nOn the show, Lundborg and Clarkson will discuss his work as an artist and how it ties to the military.\n\nOn a recent deployment to Africa, Lundborg, an artist outside of the Air Force Reserve, completed a series of paintings using coffee found in a military MREs (Meal, Ready to Eat – military field rations). His coffee art will be featured on the show.\n\nAccording to Lundborg, he “sought to create a unique illustration series inspired by his time in the region.”\n\n“When facing a challenge, I would encourage others to seek the opportunity in the difficulty,” Lundborg said in an earlier interview about his creative inspirations. “Hard times are just a foundation to greatness.”\n\nSamples of Lundborg’s coffee art can be seen here,\n\nThe Kelly Clarkson Show airs on NBC at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard Time."
