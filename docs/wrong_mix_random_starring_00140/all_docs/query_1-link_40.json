We may terminate access for users of the Site and Service who are infringers.\n\nNotifying CGRS of Copyright Infringement: To provide us with notice of an infringement, you must provide a written communication to the attention of “DMCA Notification” by either sending: (i) an email to cgrs@uchastings.edu; or (ii) a letter, first class certified mail, to CGRS, 200 McAllister Street, San Francisco, CA 94102, Attention: Deputy Director, that sets forth the information specified by the DMCA (http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512).

ANY USE OF THE CONTENT OR SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY RELIANCE UPON OR USE OF ANY OF THE INFORMATION THEREIN, SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE CONTENT AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND (ALL OF WHICH ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED), WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\nIN NO EVENT SHALL CGRS OR ANY OF ITS LICENSORS OR INFORMATION PROVIDERS (COLLECTIVELY, “CGRS PARTIES”) HAVE ANY LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTENT OR SERVICES or any services procured from Experts or other third parties FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, USE, OR DATA, IN EACH CASE ARISING UNDER ANY THEORY, INCLUDING UNDER WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHER THEORY, EVEN IF SUCH CGRS PARTY IS AWARE OF OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.\n\nTHE CGRS PARTIES’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE CONTENT OR SERVICES IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, YOU PAID TO US IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY, AND (II) $50.\n\nINDEMNITY\n\nYou agree to indemnify and hold harmless CGRS, its officers, managers, owners, employees, agents, designees, users, successors, assigns, service providers and suppliers from and against all losses, liabilities, expenses, damages, claims, demands and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs due to or arising from: (a) any violation of these Terms of Use by you; (b) the inaccurate or untruthful Content or other information provided by you to CGRS; (c) any intentional or willful violation of any rights of another or harm you may have caused to another, or (d) your use or provision of any services in connection with the Services. CGRS may elect to control the defense of any such damage or claim.\n\nNOTICE\n\nBy use of the Services, you consent to receive electronic communications from CGRS (via email or via a posting on the Services), and you agree that any such communications satisfy any legal requirement to make such communications in writing. You also agree that CGRS may communicate any notices to you under these Terms of Use through electronic mail, regular mail or posting the notices on the Services. All notices to CGRS must be provided by either sending: (i) an email to cgrs@uchastings.edu; or (ii) a letter, first class certified mail, to CGRS, 200 McAllister Street, San Francisco, CA 94102, Attention: Deputy Director. Such notices will be deemed delivered upon receipt.\n\nENTIRE AGREEMENT\n\nThese Terms of Use and other agreements, rules, and policies incorporated by reference to this Terms including the Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire agreement between you and CGRS. It supersedes any prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements, whether written or oral, between you and CGRS regarding the subject matter contained in these Terms of Use. Additional terms and conditions may exist between you and third parties, including Service Providers and others. You represent and warrant that those third party agreements do not interfere with your obligations and duties to CGRS under these Terms of Use.\n\nGOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION; NO CLASS ACTIONS\n\nThese Terms, and any claim, cause of action or dispute (“claim”) arising out of or related to these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California regardless of your country of origin or where you access the Services. ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except for CGRS’s right to seek injunctive relief as set forth below.\n\nIf you do not want to arbitrate disputes with CGRS and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to cgrs@uchastings.edu within 30 days of the day you first access or use the Services.\n\nIf you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to CGRS of your intent to arbitrate (“Notice”). The Notice to CGRS should be sent by any of the following means: (i) electronic mail to cgrs@uchastings.edu; or (ii) sending the Notice by U.S. Postal Service certified mail to CGRS, 200 McAllister Street, San Francisco, CA 94102, Attention: Deputy Director. The Notice must (x) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (y) set forth the specific relief sought; and (z) set forth your name, address and contact information. If we intend to seek arbitration against you, we will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you.\n\nThe arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single arbitrator, whose decision will be final and binding, and the arbitral proceedings will be governed by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by these Terms. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms. If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. We will reimburse all other AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you, unless the arbitrator determines that the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, in which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA rules. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. For any claim where the potential award is reasonably likely to be $10,000 or less, either you or CGRS may elect to have the dispute resolved through non-appearance-based arbitration.\n\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, YOU AND CGRS EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, YOU AND CGRS EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you and CGRS agree that all claims arising out of or related to these Terms must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in San Francisco, California, and you and CGRS each agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such claims. Notwithstanding the above, you agree that CGRS shall still be allowed to apply for and obtain injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out or related to your use of the Services or these Terms of Use shall be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or will forever be barred.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\n\nIf you breach any term of this Terms of Use or other agreement with CGRS, CGRS may pursue any legal or equitable remedy available, including but not limited to, direct, consequential, and punitive damages and injunctive relief. CGRS’s remedies are cumulative and not exclusive. Failure of CGRS to exercise any remedy or enforce any portion of the Terms of Use at any time shall not operate as a waiver of any remedy or of the right to enforce any portion of the Agreement at any time thereafter. If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Terms of Use is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with CGRS's prior written consent. We may transfer, assign or delegate the Terms and its rights and obligations without consent. Users of this Services are responsible for compliance with all applicable regulations and laws. No joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between you and CGRS as a result of these Terms of Use or use of the Services.\n\nCONTACTING US\n\nIf you have any comments or questions regarding these Terms, or wish to report any violation of these Terms of Use, please contact us at cgrs@uchastings.edu. We will address any issue to the best of our abilities.\n\nThese Terms of Use were last modified on February 19, 2020.\n\nCGRS Privacy Policy\n\nThis privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) discloses the privacy practices of the UC Hastings Center for Gender and Refugee Studies (“CGRS,” “we” or “us”) and the possible uses of the information that we gather from attorney users (“End Users”) and country conditions experts and other expert witnesses for asylum and other humanitarian matters (“Experts”) (collectively, “Users,” a “User” or “you”) via https://cgrs.uchastings.edu/assistance, [our mobile application(s),] and via other submissions by you to CGRS (collectively, the “Services”).

If we make material changes to the Privacy Policy we will notify you via the Services (e.g., by posting a notice on our website[ or via a mobile application]) indicating that the Privacy Policy has been changed. BY CONTINUING TO USE THE SERVICES YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE REVISED PRIVACY POLICY. If you do not agree with any modifications to the Privacy Policy you must cease using the Services.\n\nINFORMATION COLLECTED\n\nCGRS collects information on our users in various ways, including your submissions to the Services, participation in the Services, registration for the Services, and through cookie and other tracking technology.
