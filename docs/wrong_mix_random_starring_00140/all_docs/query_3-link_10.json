        "text": "LAS VEGAS, March 18, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS) announced today that Grammy Award-winning, multi-platinum artist Kelly Clarkson will headline Sands Cares INSPIRE 2019, the signature fund-raising event for the Sands Cares Accelerator Program, on Friday, May 24, at The Venetian® Resort Las Vegas. Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. PST, Friday, March 22.\n\nUnderwritten by Las Vegas Sands, the charity concert raises funds for Sands Cares Accelerator Program members – the Marty Hennessy Inspiring Children Foundation (ICF) and Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth (NPHY) – as part of the program's aim to invest a variety of resources in participating nonprofit organizations to accelerate their impact in the Las Vegas community.\n\nClarkson is one of the most popular artists of this era with worldwide sales of more than 25 million albums and 36 million singles. The Texas-born, Nashville-based singer-songwriter is one of pop music's top singles artists, with 17 singles boasting multi-platinum, platinum and gold certifications around the world, including such global favorites as \"Miss Independent\" and \"Because of You.\" She is the recipient of numerous honors including three GRAMMY Awards, four American Music Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, two Academy of Country Music Awards, two American Country Awards, and one Country Music Association Award. She also is the first artist to top Billboard's pop, adult contemporary, country and dance charts.\n\nClarkson has released eight studio albums, one greatest hits album, and two children's books. Last year, she hosted the \"2018 Billboard Music Awards\" in addition to appearing and winning as a coach on the 14th and 15th seasons of The Voice before reclaiming her red chair for the series' current 16th season. Clarkson is also slated to make her daytime debut with her very own talk show, \"The Kelly Clarkson Show,\" airing in the fall of 2019 on NBC.\n\nClarkson comes to INSPIRE fresh off the \"Meaning of Life Tour,\" her first since 2015. Fans will get to see her breathtaking live performance and amazing vocals amid the beautiful grandeur of an intimate classic American performing arts center, The Venetian Theatre. Featuring artists known for their inspiring live performances – Jewel, Jason Mraz and now Clarkson – Sands Cares INSPIRE curates an evening of amazing entertainment that both uplifts and impacts the Las Vegas community, since 100 percent of ticket and VIP package sales are donated to local nonprofit organizations.\n\nINSPIRE 2019 beneficiaries NPHY and ICF are current members of the Sands Cares Accelerator Program and among the best in Southern Nevada for putting at-risk youth on a positive trajectory toward a brighter future. Youth homelessness is an especially critical problem for Southern Nevada, with Clark County's metro area ranking among the top in the nation for the rate of unaccompanied homeless youth living on the streets or in shelters. Beyond the issue of homelessness, youth today face a myriad of pressures that make them vulnerable to a range of negative outcomes that can deeply affect their lives and put them at-risk for victimization, teen pregnancy, dropping out of school, serious health and wellness risks and teen suicide.\n\nNPHY provides comprehensive services to stabilize the lives of homeless teens by meeting their immediate needs as well as providing a safe, supportive environment and a path to self-sufficiency. ICF actively works with at-risk youth to help them realize their potential through project-driven learning, mentoring, apprenticeships, academics and athletics.\n\n\"INSPIRE is a do-good, feel-good opportunity for the community,\" said Ron Reese, senior vice president of global communications and corporate affairs at Las Vegas Sands. \"The chance to see someone as powerful as Kelly Clarkson in a more personal venue like The Venetian Theatre, combined with knowing your ticket purchase is going directly to helping at-risk youth, should make for a remarkable evening.\"\n\nGeneral admission tickets for Sands Cares INSPIRE featuring Kelly Clarkson are available at www.Venetian.com/INSPIRE, The Venetian Box Office or Ticketmaster beginning at 10 a.m., Friday, March 22. Premium Packages featuring value-added opportunities are available only at www.Venetian.com/INSPIRE and The Venetian Box Office.\n\nAbout Las Vegas Sands Corp.
