        "text": "Nearly eight years ago, Nikolas Ritschel died from a rare type of cancer that affects soft tissues.\n\nBefore he passed away, Nik had one last wish.\n\nNik, who was diagnosed with cancer before he turned 18 years old, took an all-expense paid vacation with his family thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\nDuring his cancer treatments, Nik met a friend named Nate, who was diagnosed after he turned 18 and was ineligible for the Make-A-Wish program.\n\nNik's last wish was to help patients like Nate who missed out. Now, his mother is carrying out his that wish for him.\n\n\"Nik was very persuasive in his life and his quest in helping others have a wish,\" says Kelli Ritschel Boehle. \"He's still opening doors and helping me with this foundation and fulfilling his wish.\"\n\nOn Oct. 12, Kelli will host Nik's Home Run, an annual fundraising event with a 7K race, a 1.5 mile fun walk, a silent auction and an award ceremony with activities planned for all ages.\n\nYou can hear the rest of Nik's story and catch Kelli on the Kelly Clarkson Show on WIFR-TV at 3 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 2."
