        "text": "In December 1961, Albert Luthuli, leader of the African National Congress (ANC), arrived in Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Journalists in Norway noted how apartheid crackdowns failed to poison the new laureate's ‘courteous’ commitment to nonviolence. The press never reported Luthuli's acceptance that saboteurs in an armed wing, Umkhonto weSizwe (MK or Spear of the Nation), would now fight for freedom. Analyzing recently available evidence, this article challenges a prevailing claim that Luthuli always promoted peace regardless of state authorities who nearly beat him to death and massacred protesting women, children, and men. We uncover his evolving views of justifiable violence, which guided secret ANC decisions to pursue ‘some kind of violence’ months before his Nobel celebration. These views not only expand knowledge of ‘struggle history’, but also alter understandings of Luthuli's aim to emancipate South Africa from a system of white supremacy that he likened to ‘slavery’.\n\n1 Luthuli's Message from Oslo to South African People, Dec. 1961: (http:www.luthulimuseum.org.za), accessed 4 June 2017. Luthuli was ANC president-general from 1952 until his death in 1967. For Luthuli's global acclaim, see Christian Science Monitor, 9 Dec. 1961; for Luthuli's ‘courteous’ mien, see New York Times, 28 May 1959. Luthuli accepted the 1960 Peace Prize in December 1961.\n\n3 LP Schomburg: Folder 115, Box 6, A. Luthuli, ‘From the African National Congress, c. early 1958’; Folder 86, Box 4, A. Luthuli, ‘Fifty Years of Union-Political Review’, 21 Dec. 1959. We draw on Stephanie Camp’s scholarship, which critically explores the ‘intimate worlds’ of enslaved people's ‘everyday resistance’ to white supremacy, including their faith in New Testament love and Old Testament revenge.

Luthuli was born in a Southern Rhodesian Seventh Day Adventist mission, which his father, John Luthuli, served as an evangelist until his death in the first year of Albert's life. A decade later, Albert and his brother settled in Natal with their mother Mtonya: Luthuli, A., Let My People Go: The Autobiography of Albert Luthuli Nobel Peace Prize Winner (New York, 1962), 24Google Scholar.\n\n23 Martin Luthuli expressed such ‘aspirations’ for the Natal Native Congress: National Archives (NAB), Pretoria, Governor General (1/GG), ‘Reception of Native Deputation by His Excellency the Governor-General at King's House’, Durban, 22 July 1911, Encl 1, 696, 14 Aug. 1911, 50/126, 1537.

The 1958 national election was the first major ballot following the disenfranchisement of Coloured voters in 1956.\n\n59 The Pondoland revolt, in particular, funneled different forms of popular anger against perceived community ‘collaborators’, with rural Xhosa commoners targeting some chiefs after passage of the 1951 Bantu Authorities’ Act: Gibbs, T., Mandela's Kinsmen: Nationalist Elites and Apartheid's First Bantustan (Johannesburg, 2014), 44–7, 49CrossRefGoogle Scholar.

Luthuli rarely aired reservations about peaceful protest to mainstream media or white liberals, which he sometimes regarded with suspicion. For example, he questioned whether reformist Liberal and Federal parties supported the ‘Universal Franchise’ when they feared ‘offend[ing] unduly the White Electorate’: LP WITS: Folder A1, Letter Luthuli to Sisulu, 22 June 1953; Folder B4-7, ‘Our Common Task, Message by A. J. Luthuli, President-General of the A.N.C. to the Annual Meeting of the South African Congress of Democrats’, 20 June 1955.\n\n77 The British Diplomatic Office called Luthuli's ANC ‘tailor-made for Communist exploitation’: United Kingdom National Archives (UK NA), Correspondence Respecting Commonwealth Relations, Jan.–Dec. 1957, Vol. 3, DO 208, P. Liesching, High Commissioner in South Africa to Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, 13 Dec. 1957, SECRET, 149 (53953), 29. This finding was similar to a CIA analysis of ANC dynamics between the 1950s and early 1960s: Digital National Security Archive (http://search.proquest.com/dnsa/docview/), accessed 1 Jan. 2015, CIA NLK-76–299, ‘Subversive Movements in South Africa’, 10 May 1963, 2–3.

Tambo reflected on the close relationship between the ANC president-general and Kotane, stating ‘Luthuli, who [while] … not a member of the [Communist] Party … bypassed his officials and secretaries and sent for Moses’: Callinicos, Tambo, 188; Bunting, B., Moses Kotane: South African Revolutionary: A Political Biography (3rd edn, London, 1975), 236–7Google Scholar; Suttner, R., The ANC Underground in South Africa (Johannesburg, 2008), 47Google Scholar.\n\n96 Mandela, Long Walk, 238; Mandela, Conversations, 78. Following Mandela, NIC member Yusuf Cachalia cautioned that counter-violence would provoke the state to ‘arrest us … [and] slaughter us’. M. D. Naidoo dissented, accusing some NIC colleagues of being afraid, a charge that instigated recriminations: Simpson, Umkhonto, 33; Babenia, N., Memoirs of a Saboteur: Reflections of My Political Activities in India and South Africa (Bellville, SA, 1995), 53Google Scholar.\n\n103 Fred Dube interview, Telling Their Stories, 105. Suleman believed that it was Kotane who ‘convinced the Chief to accept the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe’: Naidoo, In the Shadow, 21. Enrolled around July 1961, the Natal MK unit was commanded by Luthuli confidant Curnick Ndlovu, as well as Kasrils, Nair, Eric Mtshali, and Bruno Mtolo: Kasrils, R., Armed and Dangerous: From Undercover Struggle to Freedom (Auckland Park, 2013), 38–9Google Scholar; Babenia, Memoirs of a Saboteur, 60–1. Winnie Mandela said her husband coined Umkhonto weSizwe after hearing Luthuli explain that ‘[w]hen a man attacks my kraal I take a spear and defend my family’: Smith, Young Mandela, 251. From the start, MK was run by men close to Luthuli who blurred the boundaries between MK and ANC: J. Matthews and F.

One month before Luthuli departed for Oslo, the ANC issued a bulletin warning that it would ‘summon all our brain and brawn’ and not tolerate ‘peace in bondage’: Couper, ‘An embarrassment’, 340.\n\n130 Mandela records that Luthuli did not remember the July 1961 meetings authorizing MK, although Luthuli chaired these two meetings that ultimately resulted in the formation of this guerrilla wing. More likely, Luthuli complained about not being informed of MK's initial operations: Mandela, Long Walk, 250; Naidoo, Shadow of Chief Luthuli, 72.\n\n131 Kasrils, Armed and Dangerous, 9–50; Lissoni, A., ‘Transformations in the ANC external mission and Umkhonto we Sizwe, c. 1960–1969’, JSAS, 35:2 (2009), 288, 292Google Scholar.

After returning from his continental travels in Africa, Mandela joined Sisulu, Nokwe, and Joe Matthews in telling international allies that the ANC commanded MK: Landau, ‘Controlled by communists?’, 231.\n\n133 Mandela and MK members Govan Mbeki and Joe Slovo devised Operation Mayibuye, with the understanding that sabotage was not enough to combat apartheid: Bundy, C., Govan Mbeki (Athens, OH, 2012), 115–18Google Scholar; Babenia, Memoirs of a Saboteur, 61.\n\n137 LP Schomburg, Folder 35, Box 5, A.
