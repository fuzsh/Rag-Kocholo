        "text": "In true Real Housewives of Durban fashion, the popular Showmax reality show has been keeping viewers captivated. The new cast members, especially, have been a hot topic. Here, we get up close and personal with Zama Ngcobo.\n\nThe Durban-born media personality, Zama Ngcobo is no stranger to our screens. She made her TV debut back when SABC 1 was known as Simunye (if you know, you know). She then ventured into radio, and later joined the cast of Mzansi’s favourite shows, Generations and Isithembiso. Making her reality show debut on The Real Housewives of Durban S4, she says she looks forward to seeing how the rest of the episodes unfold. Sharing that “it feels great to be part of a production that is produced on home soil, ”as you would know, I am a KZN girl.”\n\nGlamour: The Real Housewives of Durban is a popular and dynamic show. What does it mean to you to be a cast member?\n\nZama Ngcobo: It feels pretty cool. I have a vast career in the media space; television presenting, acting, radio, and now venturing into reality TV. I think it was a natural progression considering that I've always taken full advantage of the opportunities afforded to me by my industry. There's a reality show for everything now, I’d be missing out if I didn’t participate in this sector.\n\nGlamour: What do you hope to bring to the show and what aspect of your life are you most excited to share with the viewers?\n\nZama: I plan to bring a truly authentic KZN girl. I've always been a proud Zulu girl, so I think as opposed to a more urban wife, I'm a typical KZN rural wife. I'm that traditional girl, and something else I look forward to sharing, is infertility story. By God’s grace, I was able to overcome my infertility issues, and I’m excited to share this part of my journey with the viewers. Just to give you a bit of background, I was diagnosed with fibroids a couple of years ago, and it was a tough journey from there. I had to undergo a major surgery because my situation was bad, resulting in other ailments or illnesses. I also look forward to the feedback from the viewers, females especially as this is something that is specific to us, and I can’t wait for women to share their experiences too.\n\nGlamour: The Real Housewives franchise is known for drama and conflict. How do you anticipate handling any potential conflicts or disagreements with your fellow cast members?\n\nZama: I think because I'm such a level-headed person, I've managed to handle conflict very well. I am not a naturally combative person so I try to steer clear of verbal and physical altercations altogether. I usually retreat because I'm not a dramatic person, and I’ve done that on the show. There were moments where it became very turbulent and I held my head down, and I believe I carried myself very well in those instances.\n\nGlamour: What sets you apart from the other housewives on the show, and what do you think will surprise viewers most about you?\n\nZama: I think what sets me apart from the other women is my career background. Having been in the media space, I'm the only one who’s done presenting, acting, radio and now venturing into reality TV. It's nothing new to me but I think what people will find surprising is the health journey I share with them, considering that I've never really let people into my personal life throughout my career. So they'll see me opening up about my own personal struggles with this particular health issue. I’ve also been getting feedback about my fun persona; people find me quite hilarious. I hope that sentiment stays.\n\nGlamour: The show often delves into personal relationships and family dynamics. Are there any aspects of your personal life that you're hesitant to share with the audience?\n\nZama: I think just as early as episode two, viewers met my cousin, who is also my best friend, and walks this journey with me as a health practitioner.And she always gives good advice so they’ll also witness that part of my life.\n\nGlamour: How do you plan to balance the demands of filming the show with your other commitments and responsibilities?\n\nZama: It was difficult because we shot all day so the schedule was difficult to adjust to. I didn’t have the flexibility I usually have as a result, I couldn’t meet my other responsibilities the way I wanted to. I did get the hang of it eventually but I have to admit that adjusting to having cameras constantly in my face was also difficult. I wouldn’t say I found it invasive but I had to adjust to having people around 24/7, and we’re not just talking one or two people, sometimes it can be about 20 at a time because we have such a huge crew. I do enjoy my alone time so I do tend to be a loner when I’m not on set working or in the studio.\n\nGlamour:The Real Housewives of Durban has a dedicated fan base. How do you engage with fans and handle any feedback or criticism that may come your way?\n\nZama: I enjoy it when it’s good and take my L’s when it’s bad so it is what it is. People are very opinionated, and they’re entitled to their opinions because they really love the franchise and have contributed to its success.\n\nGlamour: What do you hope viewers will take away from watching your journey on the show?\n\nZama: My constant theme in life is that I live an honest journey. I’m a very honest person and give honest views, I don’t sugarcoat anything. What you see is what you get.\n\nGlamour: Lastly, what are you most looking forward to experiencing or accomplishing during your time as a cast member of The Real Housewives of Durban?\n\nZama: More than anything, I look forward to the response of my fan base. When I ventured into acting after years of presenting, that’s the same base that supported me, and followed me to radio. I’m interested to see how they’ll adjust to this new phenomenon that is reality TV."
