        "text": "Recent scholarship on South African history and women reveals a contestation around the positioning of Afrikan women in the liberation struggle. The-debate‖ between Athambile Masola and Panashe Chigumadzi regarding the role of Charlotte Maxeke in the history of liberation is a good case in point. However, this paper will not delve into the-debate‖ above but will attempt to chart three traditions of womanism in South Africa and their respective political visions. The-debate‖ above provides context and inspiration for the formulation of these three traditions, which have not yet been clearly delineated. We prefer the term womanism as opposed to feminism because many of the women in these three traditions worked together with their men to resolve both the national and woman's questions. They did not regard their men as enemies to be rejected in their struggles as women in South Africa. For instance, white women and Garveyite Afrikan women prioritised race and nation over gender for different political reasons. This paper will rely on an Afrikan-centred theoretical framework. We will use the historical and comparative method in this qualitative study of South African women and the\n\nWhile historians of twentieth-century South Africa have made use of women's memoirs as an archive, this article argues that these memoirs can also be regarded as historiography. In Ruth First's 117 Days (1965), Ellen Kuzwayo's Call Me Woman (1985), and Strikes Have Followed Me All My Life: A South African Autobiography by Emma Mashinini (1989), authors critique and reconstitute narratives of the South African past, told through the lives of politically engaged women. They present versions of South African history that not only act as a corrective to the apartheid state-sanctioned narrative of South African history as white supremacist triumph, but also probe the limits of the histories narrated by liberation movements.\n\nThe liberation struggle in South Africa highlighted racial and class oppression as key causes of poverty, inequality, and a lack of rights for most South Africans. Drawing on the language of the struggle, women political and trade union activists brought attention to their oppression and exploitation as women, and were able to place non-sexism alongside non-racism and democracy as key liberation principles. However, while men in these organisations ostensibly accepted the idea of non-sexism, they were not ready to change their behaviour or give up their power, and women activists met with ongoing resistance. During the negotiations for democracy, women drew on their experience of the years of struggle and were able to ensure a high proportion of women in parliament, influence the country’s constitution, and advocate the establishment of State machinery to mainstream gender equality. However, in the post-apartheid era of reconstruction and development, both the demobilisation of protest movements and the emphasis on the technical aspects of development stand in the way of gender mainstreaming via the State.\n\nThis thesis examines grassroots women&#39;s political activism in the Western Cape, South Africa (SA) during the 1980-1994 phase and their struggles to achieve citizenship. Through tracing the history of women&#39;s political agency and the social and political forces that shaped women&#39;s resistance, this dissertation asserts that women profoundly contributed to the New SA. Motherhood was the legitimate space granted to them by the liberation movement but women transformed it into an empowering public role, affirming their demands for citizenship. The shifting nature of women&#39;s resistance, the dominant discourses that mobilised them, what forms they took and how they changed over time are explored. The thesis asserts that despite the obstacles of a patriarchal culture relegating women&#39;s issues as secondary and a repressive state, women&#39;s focussed struggles succeeded in uniting diverse women to make effective intervention. This culminated in participating in negotiatio..."
