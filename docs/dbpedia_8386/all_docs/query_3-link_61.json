Potter, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Bucks County District Attorney Diane Gibbons today announced the filing of a superseding indictment* against six defendants, John Napoli, a/k/a “Junior,” William Johnson, a/k/a “Tattoo Billy,” Christopher Quattrocchi, a/k/a “Slam,” Thomas Heilman, a/k/a “Fuzzy,” Frederick Freehoff, a/k/a “Pan Head Fred,” and Eric Loebsack, a/k/a “Kicker,” who were leaders and members of the Pennsylvania Breed Motorcycle Club (PA Breed), which operated in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and elsewhere.\n\n“This was an organization that used physical assaults, threats, and intimidation to protect its secrecy,” said Meehan. “Gang members, associates, and their families were threatened with death if they cooperated with law enforcement.”\n\nAccording to the indictment, the defendants also used cryptic and coded language when referring to drug trafficking activity on the telephone, conducted drug discussions and activities in face-to-face meetings at secure locations, and used other counter-surveillance strategies to deter law-enforcement observation of their illegal activities.\n\nThe PA Attorney General’s Office, Bureau of Narcotics Investigation, with the assistance of the Bucks County District Attorney’s Office, began its investigation of the PA Breed in 2005, resulting in state arrests, in June and July 2006, of Breed members and associates on state offenses and in the seizure of approximately 22 pounds of crystal methamphetamine, approximately 44 firearms, ammunition and other contraband. The cases against the charged defendants were referred for federal prosecution in December 2006.\n\nThe superseding indictment alleges that defendant Napoli, as president of the PA Breed, led a crystal methamphetamine distribution conspiracy which included the defendants and other Breed members and associates (“Breed Drug Organization”). Defendant Johnson, an executive member of the PA Breed, was the principle supplier of crystal methamphetamine to the Breed Drug Organization between January and June 2006, and served as an enforcer for the organization. Defendant Quattrocchi was the PA Breed sergeant-at-arms and an enforcer for the PA Breed and its Drug Organization. Defendants Quattrocchi, Heilman, Freehoff, and Loebsack were members of the PA Breed and mid-level distributors for the Breed Drug Organization.\n\nThe six defendants were charged, as follows:\n\n● all defendants with conspiring to distribute approximately 125 pounds of crystal methamphetamine between January 2003 and July 2006, in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and elsewhere;\n\n● defendants Napoli, Johnson and Quattrocchi with the commission of violent crimes in aid of racketeering;\n\n● defendants Napoli and Quattrocchi with extortion;\n\n● defendants Napoli and Johnson with possession of firearms and ammunition as a convicted felon;\n\n● defendant Johnson with possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense; and,\n\n● defendant Napoli with unlawful possession of a machine gun.\n\nDEFENDANT\n\nADDRESS\n\nAGE [Date of Birth]\n\nJohn Napoli, a/k/a “Junior”\n\nLevittown, PA\n\n35\n\nWilliam Johnson, a/k/a “Tattoo Billy”\n\nPhiladelphia, PA\n\n31\n\nChristopher Quattrocchi,\n\na/k/a “Slam”\n\nBristol, PA\n\n36\n\nThomas Heilman, a/k/a “Fuzzy”\n\nBristol, PA\n\n54\n\nFrederick Freehoff, a/k/a “Pan Head Fred”\n\nBristol, PA\n\n50\n\nEric Loebsack, a/k/a “Kicker”\n\nLevittown, PA\n\n36\n\nIf convicted, each defendant faces a maximum possible sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nThe case was investigated by the Bureau of Narcotics, Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and has been assigned to Assistant United States Attorney Andrea Foulkes and Special Assistant United States Attorney Kishan Nair.\n\nUNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE\n\nEASTERN DISTRICT, PENNSYLVANIA\n\nSuite 1250, 615 Chestnut Street\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19106 Contact:\n\nRICH MANIERI\n\nMedia Contact\n\n215.861.8525\n\n*An Indictment or Information is an accusation.
