        "text": "After delighting Mumbai audiences with his thought-provoking one-man show, Out of Bounds, last year, Durban-born actor, Rajesh Gopie, has found himself a guest at India’s wedding of the year.\n\nAnant Ambani, the son of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and his wife Nita — who founded the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre — will be marrying his long-time girlfriend, Radhika Merchant, this weekend.\n\nThe wedding is set to take place at the home of Anant’s parents and at the family-owned Jio World Convention Centre, which has a capacity for more than 16 000 people.\n\nALSO READ | Bride’s nightmare ends in a fairytale wedding\n\nAccording to CNN, the couple had a three-day pre-wedding party in the western city of Jamnagar in March, which was attended by around 1 200 high-profile guests, including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates and featured a performance by Rihanna.\n\nThen, over a weekend in late May, they hosted a four-day Mediterranean cruise for friends and family, which included performances by Katy Perry, the Backstreet Boys and opera star Andrea Bocelli.\n\nPosting on Facebook, Gopie showed off the beautiful invitation he had been sent and said that while he wasn’t a “big wedding attender type”, he was grateful for the invitation.\n\nSpeaking to The Witness, the actor, who has appeared in the films, Keeping Up with the Kandasamys and Riaad Moosa’s New Material, said he believed he was invited because of the association he has with the Ambani Cultural Centre.\n\n“I performed my play Out of Bounds and did a number of other projects there,” he added. “On July 14, they will be having the final wedding event and it’s going to be pretty huge.\n\nALSO READ | Zulu traditional expert slams res wedding ceremonies\n\n“I know they have invited a number of significant artists, who have contributed to the Centre … and, I guess I am one of them.”\n\nAsked what he planned to wear for the occasion, Gopie revealed he’d chosen a Bandhgala, an elegant outfit for men, which can be traced back to the time of the British reign in India, and “very nice shoes”.\n\nHe said it was important “not to outdo the bridal family”, adding, with a laugh, that it was possible that some Bollywood stars might not stick to the rules as they were being dressed by big name designers.\n\nWhile staging Out of Bounds — in which he takes theatre-goers into the life and times of a South African Indian family — has been an undoubted highlight for the actor, he revealed that has also enjoyed working on a number of projects for the Bollywood film industry and coaching actors, both established and up-and-coming.\n\nIt has also been affirming to get respect and acknowledgement for his work from those in the Indian entertainment industry. As for what it is like to work in Bollywood, Gopie said: “It’s dynamic and different … they don’t work by the rules that we know.\n\nIf you are in the one percent who make it, you are filthy rich … the downside is that most stars don’t have a normal life. People harass them\n\nThey can’t go for a walk down the street without people jumping out with cellphones and the media is so aggressive. They will do anything for content and the only useable content is sensational. Salacious sells.”\n\nLooking ahead, Gopie said he was unlikely to be staging any of his own works in Mumbai any time soon, but he was hoping to be able to bring his play, Tamasha on Hope Street, to KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nThe story centres on the lives of Albert, a Zimbabwean night watchman, on the run after xenophobic attacks. He believes he has escaped to safety until he meets Payal, a young street prostitute, and their lives collide with dramatic repercussions.\n\n“It was staged at the Market Theatre [in Johannesburg], but it has never been staged in KZN, despite it being set in Chatsworth,” he said. “I would love to bring it home.”"
