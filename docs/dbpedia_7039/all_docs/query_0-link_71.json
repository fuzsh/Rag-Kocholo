        "text": "Lee Evans - 1986 Fulbright U.S. Scholar to Cameroon\n\nAt the 1968 Summer Olympic Games, after winning two gold medals and setting a world record, Lee Evans participated in one of the most famous displays of activism in Olympic history. On the medal podium, Evans donned a black beret and raised his fist in the Black Power salute.\n\nJohn D. Sherwood - 2019 Fulbright-Schuman U.S. Scholar to Germany and Greece\n\nDr. John D. Sherwood has authored six books on military and naval history during his nearly 25 years as a civilian historian, and his insights directly support naval operations and strategy development. A 2019 Fulbright-Schuman Program award to Germany and Greece gave him a front-row seat to humanitarian and disaster relief operations.\n\nKen Rutherford - 2005 Fulbright U.S. Scholar to Jordan\n\nDr. Rutherford, a survivor of a landmine attack, co-founded the Landmine Survivors Network and was named to Action on Armed Violence’s “Top 100: The Most Influential People in Armed Violence Reduction” for his remarkable career. He also helped lead the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), which won The Nobel Peace Prize 1997.\n\nMargaret “Peg” Snyder - 1994 Fulbright U.S. Scholar to Uganda\n\nDr. Margaret “Peg” Snyder is known internationally as the “United Nations’ first feminist.” As the Founding Director of the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), known since 2011 as UN Women, she worked to promote and acknowledge women’s contributions to societies around the world.\n\nAndrea Dutton - 2020 Fulbright U.S. Scholar to New Zealand\n\nIn her own opinion, Dr. Andrea Dutton is less of a scientist and more of an “earth detective.” As an undergraduate music major at Amherst College in 1991, she could never have imagined herself, 30 years later, as a renowned sea level and climate change expert, and the recipient of back-to-back Fulbright U.S. Scholar and MacArthur Foundation Fellowship awards."
