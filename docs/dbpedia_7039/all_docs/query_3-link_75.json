        "text": "Leora is the Project Director for Return and Opportunity in Veterans Education (PROVE) at Silberman School of Social Work (SSSW). She started at PROVE in 2008. Ms. Shudofsky received her master’s degree in Social Work from Hunter College School of Social Work (now Silberman) in 1990 majoring in Group Work. She has been a teaching adjunct at both SSSW and Columbia University School of Social Work since 1999. She developed the curriculum for and has been teaching the “Social Work with Veterans and Service Members” course at SSSW since 2013. In May 2017, she received The Cecile B Insdorf Award for Excellence in Teaching for Part-Time Faculty. In August 2017 Ms. Shudofsky co-authored an article for a special edition of the peer-reviewed Clinical Social Work Journal entitled “PROVE: An Innovative Clinical Social Work Field Education Model.” Working with veterans has become a true passion for her and she plans to continue working with PROVE and training up the new generation of social workers to learn more about working with veterans and service members.\n\nRhonda Sherwin is the Financial Coach for PROVE. She has an BS and MBA from NYU and is an Accredited Financial Counselor (AFC®).\n\nRhonda began her financial career as a banking officer with a large Japanese bank based in NYC, continuing on to senior positions with Merrill Lynch, Guardian Life Insurance and Franklin Templeton. Her primary specialty was an expertise in Retirement Plans. While having an active career on “Wall Street”, Rhonda was a volunteer for several organizations that offered free personal finance education to NYC public school students, adults in community centers, and social service organizations helping those in need of financial assistance. Four years ago she took a new turn in her life and became a full time Veterans Financial Coach, representing NYC through a federal program funded by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Through that program, she developed and still maintains strong partnerships with providers throughout NYC servicing veterans and their families.\n\nCurrently, Rhonda is a Financial Liaison at Services for the Underserved under a new program to increase housing stability for veterans receiving federal assistance. She is dedicated to passing on her knowledge gained through academic, work and life experiences so all veterans can build confidence to make informed financial decisions.\n\nBrief History of PROVE at CUNY:\n\nProject for Return and Opportunity in Veterans’ Education (PROVE) launched more than sixteen years ago (2007) as a collaboration between Hunter College’s School of Social Work (now known as Silberman School of Social Work) and CUNY.\n\nThe founders of the program were Senior University Dean, Robert Ptachick – the senior Veteran (Vietnam) in CUNY Central Administration, Wilfred Cotto – US Navy Veteran, the then Director of COVA and Dr. Roger Sherwood, US Army Veteran, then Associate Professor at the School of Social Work.\n\nThe purpose of the project was to address the transition needs of student veterans who were returning from military service to the college campus.\n\nThe program works on two levels: It supports the multiple campuses student veteran populations as they transition from the military to college, and trains graduate social work students in military/veteran cultural competency while developing their social work skills.\n\nToday, PROVE is a valued resource on ten CUNY campuses (as well as at Fordham University) as it serves student veterans who want a personal, trained contact to provide social and emotional support and referrals, while assisting them in achieving their academic objectives.\n\nIn addition to existing college student veterans’ services, PROVE is an “asset multiplier” bringing together a team of social work interns and experienced social work supervisors (field instructors), whose objectives are to:\n\n· Assist veterans in making a smooth and successful transition, with particular focus on re-entry into the educational system.\n\n· Provide access to social and emotional support.\n\n· Connect new and current student veterans to the resources they need both from their college and from community partners.\n\nPROVE also established a standardized implementation policy that can be tailored for each campus. This included specific reporting and performance analytics, that provided PROVE, college administrators and other personnel, as well as funding partners with the relevant or requisite information to tailor programs that effectively meet the needs of the student veterans and campus professionals on each PROVE-served campus.\n\nTIMELINE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n2007 – Launched on two City University of New York (CUNY) senior college campuses + CUNY’s Office of Veterans Affairs (COVA) to meet the needs of the burgeoning CUNY student veteran population.\n\n2009 – a two year ACE/Wal-Mart Success for Veterans grant allowed us to expand to two additional campuses (community colleges)\n\n2011 – Expanded to a third CUNY Community College\n\n2012 – A grant from Robin Hood Foundation (2012-16) allowed expansion to 6 CUNY campuses.\n\n2013 – 2016 – Expanded to (7) CUNY Campuses\n\n2016-17 – Contracted to 4 Campuses (loss of funding)\n\n2017-21 – Expansion to 10 Campuses thanks to annual grants from NYC Council’s Veterans Initiative and Bob Woodruff Foundation (BWF)\n\n2021-23 – Received funding from CUNY Central & BWF (9th consecutive year) to keep PROVE at 10 college campuses.\n\n2023 – Received first VA Veterans Experience Office Community Catalyst Award\n\n2023-24 PROVE @ 11 campuses!"
