        "text": "Messages from readers of this web page\n\n2/6/19\n\nHi,\n\nHope I'm not a bother :) My son Lucas has shown interest in joining his grandfather in historical reenacting. He has always loved history so he thinks it'll be a perfect hobby for him. He did some research to prepare himself before attending a meeting and found your links page to be very helpful. Thanks a lot for that!\n\nTo say thank you, he wanted me to forward you another resource he found useful, HOBBIES THAT TEACH: HISTORICAL REENACTING. The article itself is very interesting, but he thinks the value lies within the many resources listed throughout. He really liked learning more about the costuming that goes behind the reenactments. Lucas was thinking since he enjoyed it so much you might like to add it too!\n\nEither way he wanted to say a quick thank you. (Enough to ask me to reach out)! If you decide to add the resource he found, please let me know! Lucas will definitely feel honored that you added it and show it off to his history teacher (they are doing a research unit right now).\n\nThanks again!\n\nMary and Lucas\n\nMary and Lucas,\n\nNo bother! I live for e-mails. I wait beside my PC waiting for them to appear! I added your suggested link to my links page. Frankly, I am gobsmacked that anyone reads it, links pages are so 1990's. But then, so is this page. Anyway, I'm always willing to give encouragement to young folks! I hope your son enjoys reenacting as much as I did! - Jonah\n\n5/19/16\n\nHi Jonah,\n\nJust read your article Soldiers, Actors and Reenactors. Enjoyed it.\n\nI'm a grandson of Doc Roe from Band of Brothers. I'm doing some research on a project and wanted to know where you got the info on Dye in the middle of your piece? I might want to use some of those quotes and of course, want to be able to give proper credit.\n\nThanks!\n\nChris\n\nIt came from the usmilitary.about.com website. The author is unstated; I presume it comes from a publicist at HBO.\n\nJonah\n\n9/9/15\n\nFarb: I wanted to thank you for your work on the word.\n\nIn the late 1970's I was a member of the Markland Medieval Mercenary Militia (a 1066 era group based in Maryland) who scoffed at the terribly silly SCA.\n\nThis was the first I heard the word \"farb.\" It was explained to me as the incorrect color - meaning \"it is not authentic.\" Once a year the group did a reenactment of the Battle of Hastings at the U. of Maryland. I was really curious about the word for some reason, and asked around. I was directed to a guy who also did ACE, who explained it all and said it came from some guys he knew in a Maryland ACW unit.\n\nOf course being one of the greatest and most versatile words there is, I brought it into the New England area WW2 reenacting circle about 1978 or so (at least no one else ever heard it or used it until I explained to them what it meant). For a while it really was a cool shorthand way to say \"look at those inaccurate morons\" right to their face without a clue that we were insulting them. And it spread - fast. I vaguely remember writing about this sometime around 1981 in a unit newsletter, but those have long since disappeared.\n\nOver the years I have long argued to people the origin of the word, but thanks to your article I can point to two independently researched searches pointing to the same place and time. No one has ever been able to offer any proof as to \"those other explanations\" which smack of someone making up an explanation to fit the word.\n\nI can also say that in the 1980's I got involved doing WW2 reenacting in the UK and France. I can vividly remember explaining the term to one of the first real WW2 reenactment units in France - who took it up with great enthusiasm. Again, we could speak openly in front of poor-looking units leaving them ignorant of what we were saying.\n\nSo thanks for loving the word as much as I do, and helping me prove the true meaning.\n\nJonathan\n\n4/29/14\n\nI just came across \"Was the pistol John Wilkes Booth used to shoot Abraham Lincoln stolen from Ford's Theatre?\" on your site. Great article. I never really thought about it until now but when I was young, a friend of mine in Illinois told me his well-to-do neighbor had a large gun collection in a \"secret\" room in his house. He also mentioned that he owned the \"other\" gun that didn't kill Lincoln. I was a teenager at the time and could not have cared less about history or any articles from it so I never pressed the issue. Now I can't verify that this is 100% true, but his neighbor definitely was an avid gun collector and it is interesting to think about the possibilities. Thanks for lighting the fire, now I can't stop thinking about it.\n\nDarrell\n\n10/22/12\n\nHi, Jonah.\n\nI am very new to Civil War reenacting. I attended my first event as a spectator last year in North Carolina, moved to Ohio and participated in three events this year: one mega (Shiloh 150th), one fairly large (during which I actually, due to stress and heat, passed out... Do I get authenticity points for swooning?), and one very small any-excuse-to-don-petticoats one.\n\nCan't recall what I was Googling that brought up your site, but I am most happy about the result. I'm having a blast reading your articles, and those of your fellow writers, such as Mal Stylo and Mr Hendershott, learning about the history of CW reenacting (How long will it be before someone starts reenacting the history of reenactment?), laughing in recognition of things I've seen. We certainly don't agree on everything - I don't have a problem with women soldiers (*provided they play the part convincingly*, otherwise no!), and as for women in the encampment, well, my first experiences in the hobby were with a unit whose captain wanted families included. There are certainly regiments for those who don't. There really is something for everyone in CW reenactment, I believe, and - as the captain of the aforementioned unit said once to me about the hobby - \"If you're not having fun, you're not doing it right.\"\n\nWell, since my season is over for this year (lack of finances unfortunately ruling out the last two events I planned to attend), I'm going to need plenty to tide me over 'til next year. Dress alteration and bonnet decoration can only take up so much time. So, it will be a winter of practicing (my persona writes - mostly maudlin poetry)... learning (period cooking, for instance)... hopefully, educating (The people I now reenact with are a little less concerned about authenticity - or even the appearance of it - than I am. I wouldn't call myself hard-core at all , but please, one petticoat under a day dress??????)... and Shelby Foote, here I come! And you've piqued my interest in Revolutionary War reenacting. Doubt I can find much out here, but I'm going to take a look. Then again, maybe since I'm now in the midwest, I should look for my inner Viking...\n\nAnyhow, I just wanted to say that I love your website and am having a great time reading it. Besides entertainment and information, you've already given me plenty to think about, plenty of new directions to explore. And I just plain enjoy your writing.\n\nI'm sure you have a lot of fans who regularly check for new postings. Please count me now among them.\n\nIn gratitude,\n\nMiss Tamara Nesbit\n\n(civilian reenactor attached to Ohio Henry Rifles)\n\n9/25/12\n\nSir\n\nMy name is T.H. Gray and I am the Director-curator of the American Hysterical Society. We collect and occasionally create humor focused on history, museums, and reenacting. As you might guess, we spend a lot of time online building our collection. Which is why I was both shocked that I had not heard of you until recently and delighted that I have found your work. While I can't say I have read everything you've written (yet!), I am humbled by your contributions to reenacting and now to, I am pleased to say, our collection.\n\nWe have included you, as well as your friend Mal, on our blogroll and just this morning we have shared your works with our audience. You can find our post here.\n\nThanks for all you do and I do hope to see you on the field some day!\n\nYours,\n\nT.H. Gray\n\n8/17/11\n\nHello Jonah, My name is Andrea and I've been using your ghost page...\n\nI volunteer with the girl scouts and my daughter's troop is going on a camping trip this coming weekend. I just wanted to say \"thank you\" for putting your page together. I've been tasked with providing the campfire entertainment and I wanted to have some stories to tell. :-)\n\nHave a good week,\n\nAndrea\n\n7/27/10\n\nEver since I wrote you about Jonah Hex, I've been on the lookout for the Civil War in the movies and I think I may have found the most farbtastic one yet....Vampire Confederate soldiers.\n\nYes, I'm one of those grown wimmens who fell for Twilight. I dreamt of Edward sparkling and telling me how good my blood smelled. Only after I saw the second movie and witnessed other women my age making complete idiots out of themselves did I realize how creepy it all actually was.\n\nI totally forgot about the Confederate story line until I dragged my Union reenactor boyfriend to see Eclipse this past weekend. I'm long past the fangirly stage and we actually rolled our eyes and gagged at the overwrought angst. Then the Confederate storyline showed up and I whispered, \"You're gonna LOVE this.\"\n\n.....Jasper was once a dashing Confederate cavalry soldier (my boyfriend whispered, \"OF COURSE he is, no one ever wants to be a shoeless regular. At least he's not dismounted cavalry). He ran across some vixen vampires one night near some kind of pond and they decided to \"change\" him into one of them to train their \"vampire army\" of the southwest.\n\nVampire Army. Apparently this was one of the overlooked aspects of the War Between the States and Stephenie Meyer has the scoop. What if the CSA had a legion of vampires at their disposal? Maybe that book \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\" isn't so ridiculous?\n\nImagine the reenacting possibilities! Would they surrender the port a potties? Nope. They would SPARKLE!\n\nSarah\n\nA Vampire Army Of The Southwest. Just imagine bloodthirsty Rebs peering at us from behind double-wides in Phoenix or Tucson. Horrible! - Jonah\n\n7/7/10\n\nYour site is the best!\n\nI took my boyfriend/reenactor to see the movie Jonah Hex tonight after seeing it with my son last week. Apparently it's based off a \"graphic novel\" (comic books for adults?) and it's about an ex Confederate/turned bounty hunter on a mission to get revenge. Josh Brolin hunts down ex Confederate General Gone Wild John Malkovich and tries to stop him from using a \"doomsday weapon\" on the North during centennial events in 1876.\n\nIt's pretty far out and the whole Malkovich character/doomsday storyline is basically a Neo Confederate wet dream. Nuke the North! It reminded my BF of the painting on your site, \"Southern Revenge.\" Sipping coffee whilst thousands burn to death. It's worth the cost of netflix but I don't regret seeing it in the overpriced movie palace. Megan Fox's acting is pretty craptacular too. Forget the farbtastic storyline/doomsday/magical confederate/Crow Indian powers....Does anyone believe for even a minute that any \"ladies of the night\" were that hot back then? They were lucky to have teeth and/or avoid the STD of the day...gonasyphaherpalits anyone?\n\nSarah\n\n6/4/10\n\nJonah,\n\nSince finding your website and sending my first email, I spent the better part of a day reading and laughing through your site. I spent a few years re-enacting as a Federal Soldier in the Midwest and, I encountered almost everything commented on in your articles. I will also freely and sadly have to admit that I contributed to some of the problems too. I was, for a short time under the delusion that I could help my unit members see the authenticity light and therefore became an irritant to the people that joined for other reasons.\n\nLooking back on those few years, I had a great time and enjoyed many of the wonderfully weird people in the hobby. Every once in awhile, I find my photo albums and portraits that were taken and cringe at the headaches from hangovers and my daily reminder of the guy that opened a hole in my hand. The stuff of countless hours of campfire bragging rights!\n\nHad only I read and took to heart the advice given in your material, I could have saved a few years of my il-spent youth, on second thought....nah...I would have jacked it up some other way.\n\nI do wish I could have had the pleasure to meet you and some of your friends in the hobby, sounds like you had a great time for the most part.\n\nYou really should write a book for all those aspiring people anxious to 'serve' their country in re-enactmentland. Your material crosses the majority of Era boundaries although I'm not sure about the Star Wars groups? (grin)\n\nGood Luck in all that you do!\n\nRobert P.\n\n6/3/10\n\n\"Jonah\"\n\nThank you so much for your website, I'm still rolling about the page dedicated to CW Artwork. I've seen many of the praying Generals but ignored them. I have come to expect almost any level of quality in merchandise at a souvenir store or sutler's booth.\n\nYour presentation and evaluation are entertaining, humorous, and unfortunately, true!\n\nBest Wishes and Keep up the great work!\n\nRobert P.\n\n5/6/10\n\nDear Mr. Begone:\n\nSince, unlike \"Happy Friends,\" you seem to be still in business, perhaps you will find interest in this trailer for a film that will doubtless never be made. Though tacky in places, if nothing else, you might enjoy, as I did, watching to see who you recognize: click here.\n\nTouch the elbow,\n\nB.C. Milligan\n\nCompany K, First Penna. Reserves\n\n2/16/10\n\nI was reading an article by Ross Kimmel about the late 60s after the Centennial. He was writing about George Gorman and how George influenced Ross in both positive and negative ways. I was in reenacting during the Centennial. First with NSSA McGregor'Battery at First Manassas. I find the same bitter sweet memories. It was my transition from being a child going into my teens too. While there were good and bad times I would not change a thing either.\n\nWe have the 150th now coming and I just hope there are some pre-teens out there that can ride on the next 5 years for experience and a safe harbor to grow in. It was good for us, I hope it can be good for them too. I have been in and out of reenacting and now I am with the Black Horse Cav/ 4th Va Ca Co.H.\n\nI enjoy your web page very much. Great writing of great tales.\n\nGregg\n\n12/14/09\n\nGreetings Jonah. I am a big fan of your site and have visited it many times over the past ten years. I enjoy reading your various articles especially the articles on modern day Civil War art and your articles on historical movies.\n\nI would like to recommend to you the book \"One Nation: Patriots and Pirates Portrayed by N. C. Wyeth and Jamie Wyeth\" as it contains some wonderful art work pertaining to the Civil War and the American Revolution among other American history art treats. I really think that this work captures the spirit that modern day artists working in the historical field seem to lack.\n\nThanks,\n\nChris\n\nBiloxi MS\n\n11/3/08\n\nJonah,\n\nI discovered your site by accident about three weeks ago, and I love it.\n\nThanks!\n\nMy husband and I are going to get into CW reenacting in the spring. Hope that we dont look too farby once we get going!\n\nEhhh. Don't worry about it, just have fun!\n\nWe love the humorous spin you put on the business of reenacting.\n\nThe hobby puts the spin on it itself! I just recognize it...\n\nI thought about your site this morning while watching the last half hour or so of a movie called \"2000 Maniacs\". If you haven't seen this gem, it comes across somewhat like \"Brigadoon\" written against the backdrop of the Confederacy, a vengeful Confederacy at that. The movie was like a car wreck - you know that you shouldn't look, but, you can't help it.\n\nYou must have watched the very same Turner Movie Classics broadcast I did (I recorded it). Yes, this was a real winner. That theme song was so good I posted it... see the What's New page, where you can download this classic for your iPod.\n\nAgain, thank you for a fantastic site! - Laura\n\nThanks for writing! Jonah\n\n7/24/08\n\nHello Jonah !\n\nI came across your web page while looking to track old toys ( ya, I know kinda round about ). I love the Civ war stuff. I am actually a member of a Rev war fife and drum Corp ( I am a fifer), the Middlesex County Volunteers ( on the web at http://www.mcvfifesanddrums.org ).\n\nAre you a member of the 2nd Mass? I saw a link to it on your site.\n\nThanks for the site. I don't do civ war reinactment, but I had a rather famous cousin fight in the Union Army in the original war. He had the same last name as me and had the rank of General.\n\nThanks again\n\nBill Grant Deerfield, NH\n\n7/22/08\n\nHi\n\nI stumbled across this site after running this google search, \"why arent there any good civil war movies?\" As for that, I think its because only American make them, and Americans can't make a movie about the Civil War any more than most of us could make a XXX-rated movie about our parents having sex.\n\nIt will have to be a foreigner and the script should come from Ambrose Bierce, NOT Bruce Catton, or that little documentary guy.\n\nI LOVE THE SITE. It seems to reflect some of my own feelings about Civil War history. I was very interested from the age of 10 till about 17, then I knew enough to know it wasn't really that interesting.\n\nI also \"did\" Revy War reenacting (age 15 -19). I was a member of the 2nd Maryland Light Infantry, Chuck Gosnell, commanding. I was at the Yorktown and Treaty of Paris bicentennials.\n\nI can think of a couple of other reasons why the revolution is a whole lot more fun to do than CW. The ACTUAL period was far more exciting. First off you're 100% correct about the \"cleavage.\" Kidding aside, this was the age of enlightenment after all, and sex would not be outlawed in the western hemisphere until 1843.\n\nThere is an enlightened aura to Revy vs. CW folks. All of this is not class, either. I'm not rich. The motivation of the Revy soldier was largely idealism. Ideas like liberty, individual human dignity, self determination, egalitaranism (certainly among the men if not all the officers). And let's not forget that the English really know how to party. Contrast Stonewall's bible-thumping, Presbyterian, wrath of god, W T legion bull s**t, with Burgoyne's teenage mistresses, and port wine and opium orgies!\n\nAnyway the site is fun, thanks for keeping it up.\n\nMarc\n\n2/12/08\n\nJonah,\n\nI really enjoyed the compilation of art you have on the site for Harry Dierken. I like the way he reflects the stye of the times in his drawings, it looks like the artist from Hardtack & coffee - Charles Reed, and others from that era. Harry puts his own humor into it.\n\nI especially like the drawings for \"Gaslight Ghost\" & \"Mary Surrat's Heartless Judge.\"\n\nKevin O'Malley\n\n9th Va, Co. C\n\nYes, Harry is the Grand Old Man of local Civil War art, as far as I'm concerned. I really like his style, too. I asked him about his style, once, and he told me that he thought it was reminscent of Walton Taber. I can see it. I am happy to report that, according to a common friend, Harry is alive and well and an octogenarian, although he hasn't done any reenacting in a while. - Jonah\n\n1/28/08\n\nHey Jonah!\n\nI haven't written to you in like, forever, but what the hey. I just wanted to thank you for keeping up the website and the great articles. i especially liked the ones about the 125th events, and also the rouzerville tacticals. i remember well those latter, especially the '83 & 84. At one of them, i remember we Federals running out of rounds while defending an elevated position, and throwing potatoes and apples at the Johnnies while hollering FREDERICKSBURG! at the top of our lungs.\n\nGreat times all. I also agree that there will likely not be another sight to our eyes as impressive as the 125th Pickett's Charge scenario. That was amazing in so many ways.\n\nAh well. Nice to hear you are back in the field. If you get to Ander's gettysburg event this year (At High Tide), look me up. I'll be attached to the CS medical units, in the field with the ambulance (we have an actual 2- wheel ambulance that Jon Noviki built).\n\nAnyway, You have a great website and it's always good to visit and reminice about the \"old days\" of reenacting.\n\nRespects,\n\nTim Kindred\n\n10/23/07\n\nDear Jonah Begone,\n\nI have been a fan of your website for about a year now and I frequently visit to hear what you have to say. I must say, you do an excellent job. If I need a good laugh, I can always find something funny to read on your site. Recently, I started a website called The Young Campaigner. It is geared towards young people in Civil War reenacting. I know that you are active in the reenactment community and if you are anything like me, you are probably tired of seeing the myriad youthful farbs of the reenacting world out on the field. Being a kid myself, I set out to change some of that. I would love it if you could link to my website on your site. You can visit me here.\n\nWilliam Chapman\n\n9/26/07\n\nJonah,\n\nI have been reading your site for at least two or more years now.....and I have to say welcome back to the lunatic fringe!\n\nI have been reenacting for five-six years now and am a Captain of a small Confederate unit in Maine. Your observations about the ego and the IDs in the personalities of reenactors is right on the bubble! Our former Captain was the Meglomaniac, reliving his youthful Army glory days...and I know another Captain who is the \"foremost expert on everything reenacting/civil war history\" and is often indignant about \"protocol\" and the perception of the south... It has always been my opinion we are not much different than Star trek groupies other than we have a historical basis. Keeps one grounded.\n\nOne thing, maybe it hasn't hit you yet, but the last couple of years in the hobby is the \"great musket cap panic.\" Caps are getting harder to find in great quantities (the four wing caps specifically)... leading to the foretelling of the END OF THE HOBBY. We can't use the six wingers as they are dangerous. (But are they really?)\n\nIt's always good to read your articles...\n\nCaptain Michael Pratt (aka Seamus Kilkenny or most recently Chainfire Pratt)\n\n15th Alabama\n\nI have a couple of tins of ten year old caps in stock, so the Great Cap Shortage (whether real or imagined) hasn't affected me yet. But I briefly encountered a bit of this at the last event I did. Somebody apparently got hit with a bit of cap, and the first question asked was, \"Are you using six wingers?\" \"Huh? Six wingers?\" I thought. Well, that's a new one on me. All mine have four wings. - Jonah\n\n8/3/07\n\nI just read your article about the training given to the actors in Band of Brothers by Capt. Dye. I agree wholeheartedly with the entire writing. While I am not a combat veteran, I did serve 4 Years in the Navy and 4 in the Army. I agree that unless you have experienced the rigors of a military basic training, that you can not possibly have a clue as to the closeness of the military unit.\n\nI too looked forward to the completion of boot camp with apprehension. It would be a whole new world, with new leaders and new peers and the fear that you would not \"fit in.\" In both services, I found that fitting in was a matter of as my dear father the First Sergeant told me, \"boy, ears open and mouth shut!\" That advice served me well along with the reliance upon my petty officers and NCOs. The guys in the Army even asked if I was nuts, leaving the \"comfort\" of the Navy for the Army. I guess giving up the routine 20 hour days of flight ops for garrison duty with the Military Police was strange to them for some reason???\n\nAnyway, thanks for a great article.\n\nBruce Stump\n\nPittsfield, MA\n\n3/27/07\n\nJonah,\n\nI was searching the web and came across your site \"But is it art?\" In reference to Arnold Friberg's \"A Prayer at Valley Forge.\" I would agree that this is probably one of the best religious paintings we will get... but have you seen \"A Father's Prayer\" by David Wright? An almost exact image of Valley Forge... it is amazing two great generals in our nation's history can be at the same spot, only 100 years apart. I understand LHAPs and the whole illustration of a certain specific instant, and I get the idea of a spiritual South, but come on... next we will see General Lee crossing the Potomac in a boat, standing tall with his Stars and Bars behind him.\n\nAre they really running out of ideas? Or maybe Hollywood needs to create some more for them in one of their next films.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nMJ\n\nHi MJ!\n\n\"A Father's Prayer\": That's downright plagiarism!\n\nNo, I haven't seen it before - I've been out of the loop with the current LHAP trends (by design). But thanks for alerting me!\n\nJonah\n\n5/19/06\n\nJonah:\n\nI read with some personal interest your explanation of the origin of the term 'FARB' in your article.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I have a personal interest in the origin of this term, as it seems to be derogatory. I am glad to see it is not associated with me or one of my relatives, although I can probably point you to a number of Farbs who are in fact farby.\n\nYou might be interested in some Farb family history, about the origin of the family name. Whether the following is fact or just family mythology, I don't really know.\n\nMy great-great-great grandfather was born Anders Magnus Sjostedt, November 3, 1793 in Sweden. He was a soldier in Napoleon Bonaparte's army. Apparently Napoleon's generals (many of whom were Prussian I guess) could not pronounce the Swedish names, so the Swedish soldiers were given German names, in our case Farb (color). Apparently Anders survived, and died October 25th, 1871. His son was Carl Johan Farb, whose son was August Theodore Farb, whose son was Carl Alfred Farb, whose son was Kenneth Eugene Farb, my father.\n\nI am somewhat glad to see that the origin of the term 'farb' is not a derogatory reference to one of my relatives, but if you need a derogatory reference to a real live Farb, I can supply several.\n\nThere is another 'family' of Farb's, who seem to be located around Rockford Illinois. As far as I know, they are a different family.\n\nThanks\n\nDavid Michael Farb,\n\nA Farb of the Sixth Generation.\n\n2/13/06\n\nI read your article We Are All Privates Ryan I must say that it touched me deeply.\n\nWhen I was younger (so much younger than today) I never gave much thought to signing up for military service You see, since birth I have been around the military as an Army Brat so I lived and breathed military without even realizing it, until now. Even now I work as a civilian for the Department of Defense; I am the exhibits specialist for the U.S, Army Signal Corps Museum. The only time I have not been associated with the military was for about six months after I was honorably discharged from the Army.\n\nI was asked if I wanted my old Army job back as a civilian I did and have been in government service now for 35 years But lets go back a bit.\n\nWhen I turned 18, and fresh out of high school I had a decision to make join the Army or get drafted I opted for joining because then at least I could pick what I wanted to do I became a clerk, not any clerk mind you but THE Company Clerk The one you didnt want to get pissed off or your records might become missing or you might be scheduled for KP more than the others etc It also worked the other way too. You might get to take a 30 day leave home and finance would somehow never know about it and not deduct the time off. After AIT I received orders for Vietnam As most of the soldiers in my company did.\n\nWe were flown to Fort Lewis, Washington to be processed for shipment. So here I was, a skinny 18 year old in jungle fatigues at Fort Lewis getting ready to ship out, was I nervous you bet! Everybody was, even though some acted cool about it The day before shipping out I went to sick call The doctor I saw told me that due to a medical problem I had at the time I was not deployable. I just sat there and finally asked him if that meant I wouldnt be going to Vietnam. Thats right he told me. I didnt know what to think I was relieved but at the same time disappointed, a very heavy bag of mixed emotions. Like you I am considered a Vietnam Era Veteran. I am not ashamed at that moniker because I was ever so close to going. And I did serve for 6 years. I was stationed at Fort Lewis with the most wonderful scenery you could imagine. It reminded me of my many trips to Germany thanks to being an Army Brat. I was then sent to Vicenza, Italy, a beautiful town in the northern part of Italy, near the Alps. I have very fond memories of traveling around the world as an Army Brat and also as a soldier.\n\nI know this is getting long winded but like you I do Civil War reenacting of course as a Signal Corpsman. And like you Ive run into others who having spent no time in the military. I of chuckle a bit when they try to act the part. I think if they only knew. One week in real basic training would, I think, humble some down a bit. Im doing this for fun, I also did it for real.\n\nThanks for listening\n\nMike Rodgers\n\nUS Army Signal Corps Museum\n\nWe WILL Get the Message Through\n\n1/15/06\n\nI think your just jealous because we have a worth while hobby and all you can do is bitch an moan like a button pisser and not do anything about it except bash people who spend their time and money to educate the public about what these people had to go through in the stuggle of freedom for the Southerners and reuniting of the States for the Northerners. Reenacting is here to stay for as long as im alive. And to add alot of the people that Reenact the Civil War are doing it because they had family fight in it. I myself had 4 relatives, 2 of whom died in battle and another in prision. So when you die I pray you will be cast to the deepest depths of hell for your disrespect and dishonor to the brave and heroic men and women who fought and sacrificed in the American Civil War.\n\nOn behalf of the Civil War Reenacting community\n\nandrew g\n\nP.S. The Civil War was not fought over slavery till after the Antietam, it was fought to preserve the Union, so get your facts right.\n\nI was wondering when I was going to get a flame. It took being nearly ten years on the World Wide Web - amazing.\n\nAre there any instances of where I'm denigrating a person who actually fought in the Civil War? I don't think so.\n\nJonah\n\n12/7/05\n\nJonah,\n\nThere's been a lot of talk going on in the Civil War re-enacting world about \"Farbs\".\n\nAnd there always has been. It seems to be the subject nobody ever tires of discussing. (Except me.)\n\nWhy is it that when we talk about the farbs that everyone gets the itch to just cut them down.\n\nProbably because it's human nature to identify ways in which we're better than our fellow man. Or the male competitive spirit. I'm not sure!\n\nI'm not standing up for them, if anyone thinks that, it's just that sometimes we should just let things slide.\n\nAgreed. Others, however, will argue that this will be the thin edge of the wedge.\n\nIf the public is asking: \"How come those people over there have modern stuff showing and you don't?\" then why not tell the public that your impression is more on the correct path than most others in the hobby? It's not difficult to explain to the public what the difference is, the public has no clue as to what a \"Farb\" is much less want to know about it, they could care less. The public is interested in seeing \"blood and gore\", people taking dramatic hits, the general mayhem of combat and authenticity of the scene. I'm sure that if they saw some modern things in camp every now and then won't harm their deep impression of the Civil War. They know that we live in the \"Now\" and not the \"Then\" era.\n\nAgreed.\n\nWe recreate or re-enact a part of history, but without the blood and gore details that surround it. The thing is we have to use common sense, without it we'd just be plain arrogant at everything.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAnother Jonah\n\nWell, you'll get no strident opposition for what you say from me!\n\nJonah Begone\n\n7/8/05\n\nHello Jonah,\n\nI was perusing the web (procrastinating when I should be working on a book) and I found both you site and my article on seeing the elephant. Thanks for using the piece, now (yikes!) twenty-one years old.\n\nRegards,\n\nJerry\n\nAin't the Internet sumpthin'?\n\nThat's the neat thing about JonahWorld! Articles may disappear or be long-forgotten elsewhere, but I keep the better ones!\n\nJonah\n\n6/17/05\n\nHi Jonah,\n\nI was prompted to search for the story of Edwin Booth saving Robert Todd Lincoln after seeing a re-telling on a t.v. show called, \"Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction?\" (a show that started on the FOX network in 1998, currently in re-runs on the SciFi Channel). I don't exactly place full trust in the show's researchers - as one commenter states, \"Just because a no-name author has first-hand accounts doesn't mean the people he interviewed aren't big fat liars.\" OK, that's harsh -- but it's also a valid concern when researching factual events.\n\nBesides your site, my search brought up the following book by an author I've never heard of. You can find that (or any) book here. Type in your location (following the instructions) and the site's search engine will find libraries near you, with a pre-entered search criteria using the book you're looking for.\n\nThe book I found referenced in relation to the Booth/Lincoln story is: \"Robert Todd Lincoln: a man in his own right\" By: John S Goff, Publisher: Norman, University of Oklahoma Press [1968, ©1969], Subjects: Lincoln, Robert Todd, -- 1843-1926.\n\nWhile the following site seems \"respectable,\" I still have my doubts as to the truth of the story, since the account rendered here contradicts a letter published on your site. In the letter, the author notes that Booth's sister Asia makes no mention of the incident, while TheHistoryNet.com author claims, \"...Booth frequently mentioned the event to friends...\" It would seem to me that Asia would certainly highlight the story in her brother's biography, even if her family had been treated poorly following the assassination. If anything, it would seem to exculpate the family, and therefore re-attain national favored status (unless, that is, she supported the assassination as a fiercely resentful Southern Sympathizer -- and since the war continues, in some respects, in our present day, I suppose that could be the case). Here is the site.\n\nI think I shall end my search with that; perhaps you ended yours long ago. I'm inclined to accept the unverifiability of the story ... until something more substantial comes to light. Regardless, I hope this email is at least somewhat useful to your work by providing a couple of resources of which you may have been unaware. I thank you for the work you have done.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nKimchi\n\nThanks! So far I have not done any real research into the matter, to prove it true or false. I have simply confined myself to reprinting some articles about it. Did it really happen? I'm open eaither way. - Jonah\n\n4/12/05\n\nJonah -\n\nI too was dismayed by the \"Lincoln was gay\" article. The point this guy missed (or ignored because it does not further his agenda) is that the world that Lincoln lived in was completely segregated by sex. Except at formal social functions or in rigidly supervised courtship encounters, men and women did not mix. Even then the women were almost universally escorted by a male relative if they were unmarried. Further, Lincoln was a classic type-A personality. He was a workaholic who was completely focused on his professional and political careers and often worked more than 12 hours a day, 6 to 7 days a week. This, coupled with the fact that he had almost no likelihood of encountering women during the course of his political/professional conduct, meant Lincoln was immersed in an almost completely male world - as were just about all other 19th century men.\n\nI agree with the article's author's contention that homosexuality existed during the 19th century and it certainly makes sense for it to be more prevalent in a frontier environment where there are fewer women and less stringent social norms. I note, however, that while Illinois was technically the \"frontier\" during the ante-bellum era, during the 20 years leading up to the 1860 the growth and socio-economic characteristics looked more like what we have seen in the modern places like Silicon Valley. I say with my tongue only partly in my cheek that one would expect more extreme nonconformist behavior to flourish not in high growth, boomtown, ante bellum Illinois but in ante bellum Texas (which seemed to be a place at that time where people who didn't fit in anywhere else tended to migrate).\n\nOn a pseudo-related note, I would recommend the book Born Losers by Scott Sandage. Sandage paints a picture of the 19th century intellectual history of personal economic failure that is fascinating. And yes, Lincoln figures prominently but not in the way you might think (he was a spy for early credit reporting agencies).\n\nI have never felt the need to email you before but I have been a lurker on your site for years. I am a former civil war reenactor who no longer does it (i) because I now have a wife and child that I like spending my weekends with; (ii) I simply don't have enough time as a lawyer to have a hobby that is so all consuming; and (iii) I used to be a rebel reenactor and after actually thinking about the civil war feel too conflicted about the pain of the civil war to want to spend time reenacting it (and my emotional tie to the south is too strong to want to do a Union impression). I enjoy your musings and the collection of articles you have posted on your website. You should think about pulling your stuff together into a larger project: You are an engaging writer and your work is interesting and very entertaining to read, and not just on topics that I have a clear affinity for - I checked out your memoirs of your youth in California thinking I wouldn't find it interesting and found that I read the whole thing in one sitting.\n\nCheers and keep up the good work,\n\nDavid Tayman\n\n11/29/04\n\nDear Jonah,\n\nI like your article on \"YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY\" and it has some truths in it but it also lacks one item, the privacy of others on or off the field.\n\nI have a friend that went re-enacting last year and he read all the bylaws and operating proceedures of their company. Now the thing is their bylaws didn't state anything about going online and talking about events and what not. The NCO in the unit got some information from someone online about this and contacted my friend and put him on disciplinary probation without him knowing. Then later my friend asked him a bunch of questions on why they did what they did, he refused to answer his questions fully and made him feel guilty for their ownmistake. My friend feels that the NCO is fully responsible and also feels that they betrayed him when he was a \"green\" troop.\n\nI, myself, blame the NCO completely because it was his arrogance and ego that made this happen.\n\nThank you,\n\nAnother Jonah\n\nReenactment NCOs and officers govern with the consent of the governed. In fact, they have no real authority at all. As Mal Stylo once pointed out, sham NCOs and officers must take the Montessori approach and persuade others to do their will. Whenever I hear that one of them is disciplining somebody (and somebody lets them get away with it) I have to pick my jaw up from off the floor. - Jonah\n\n11/24/04\n\nHonored Sir,\n\nPlease allow me to take a minute to say how much I admire your work. I have been a reenactor for several years and I think that your site helps me keep it all in perspective. If you can't laugh at yourself...\n\nAnyway, in addition to my reenacting activities (I portray a regimental surgeon), I am also a professional historian. I wish that you would turn your pen to our ranks and poke some fun at us once in a while. Believe me, there would be lots of material! I enclose one item found on the internet as an example:\n\nWhy God Never Received a PhD\n\nAnonymous\n\nHe had only one major publication.\n\nIt was in Hebrew.\n\nIt had no references.\n\nIt wasn't published in a refereed journal.\n\nSome even doubt he wrote it by himself.\n\nIt may be true that he created the world, but what has he done since then?\n\nHis cooperative efforts have been quite limited.\n\nThe scientific community has had a hard time replicating his results.\n\nHe never applied to the ethics board for permission to use human subjects.\n\nWhen one experiment went awry he tried to cover it by drowning his subjects.\n\nWhen subjects didn't behave as predicted, he deleted them from the sample.\n\nHe rarely came to class, just told students to read the book.\n\nSome say he had his son teach the class.\n\nHe expelled his first two students for learning.\n\nAlthough there were only 10 requirements, most of his students failed his tests.\n\nHis office hours were infrequent and usually held on a mountain top.\n\nNo record of working well with colleagues.\n\nKeep up the fine work!\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour ob't servant, etc,\n\nBrady Lee Hutchison\n\nAssistant Editor\n\nThe Papers of Jefferson Davis\n\nRice University MS 43\n\nThank you! Unfortunately, I can't effectively poke fun at professional historians because I'm not one myself and therefore don't understand the culture! But this bit is a hoot! - Jonah\n\n11/21/04\n\nI miss \"The Rebel,\" too.\n\nWhen I was living in Summerville, SC, about 18 miles from Charleston in 1960 Nick Adams came to make a personal appearance to promote \"The Rebel\" during the height of the Centennial. I was not lucky enough to be one of those who got to shake his hand but I well remember they brought him in on a \"good-guy\" white horse and he rode very close to the small stands we were sitting in.\n\nI have a couple of episodes of \"The Rebel\" on tape along with an epsiode or two of \"The Gray Ghost.\" The problem with \"The Gray Ghost\" is that it was recorded on some arcane video format and it costs about $45,000 per episode to transfer it to standard viedotape (or so I was told when I inquired).\n\nAt one time it was honorable to be a Confederate...even \"Gil Favor\" (the trail boss on \"Rawhide\") had a history of having been a Confederate captain. Maybe that was why he was so understanding of the addle-pated former Confederate soldier \"Mushy\" who rode on the chuckwagon with \"Cookie.\"\n\nIt is going to take a lot of work to get back to being able to portray Confederates as heroic figures...\n\nYOS,\n\nCol. Kelley\n\n37th Texas Cavalry\n\n9/17/04\n\nDear Mr. Begone:\n\nI read with great interest (and more than a few chuckles) your review of the \"Legendary New Market Flag Film,\" (formally known as New Market: Field of Honor.) While the film is certainly dated, and had modest production values, it was an award-winner in its day--specifically the Gold Medal for Documentary Film at the International Film Festival of New York, 1967.\n\nHowever, as Gods and Generals songster Bob Dylan once noted, \"The times, they are a changin'.\" The feature film shown daily every hour at the New Market Battlefield State Historical Park is now Field of Lost Shoes. This docu-drama, produced in conjunction with the Harrisonburg, Virginia public television station WVPT, employs both historical images and reenactment footage to a great degree. Like the \"bouncing flag\" film, Field of Lost Shoes focuses on the unique role of the VMI Cadets in the Battle of New Market. It has been honored with a Virginia Association of Broadcasters award, a Telly Award for outstanding local programming, and an Emmy Award for best direction.\n\nI hope, on your next visit to New Market, that you take in the new production. It is also available for sale in our museum store. Since we receive no public funds to operate the Park, every penny counts.\n\nOh, and we sometimes still show the flag film, too.\n\nScott H. Harris, Director\n\nNew Market Battlefield State Historical Park\n\nThanks for the note, Scott! Yes... next time I'm in the Valley I shall see this promising new production. Actually, I want to make sure that everyone understands me perfectly: I like the Flag Film. For me it's one of Virginia's minor historical resources. I always enjoy seeing it in the same way I like watching quirky non-Hollywood-style cult films like Carnival of Souls or Glen or Glenda. (Which is not to suggest that the Flag Film has anything in common with the dead walking the earth or transvestites.) The cachet of this film was first noted to me by members of the Eighth Ohio while at an event (\"You've got to go see the 'Flag Film,' Jonah!\"), and I have promoted it to other reenactors and Boys Scouts at New Market activities. I'm glad to hear you still show it occasionally!\n\nI also get a kick out of the other one, about Stonewall in the Valley. In fact, even as I type I can hear the military-style incidental music to those throbbing maps...\n\nJonah\n\n9/14/04\n\nJonah,\n\nI have to thank you for making my morning! I love your site; I haven't stopped laughing since I looked at your \"But is it art?\" section. While I'm not a CW reenactor I've worked on a few film projects with a number of CW reenactors and I doubt they would find any humor in your site, as they seem to be the type that take the idea of the \"War for States' Rights\" and the religous views of the southern generals a little too seriously.\n\nAs a Rev war reenactor I did see alot of good and funny points with your comparison. Though in my unit I think we could drill you until you drop, our canteens aren't for decoration and we aren't the cleanest bunch of guys in uniform :) (though we are considered a \"progressive\" unit) keep up the great work on the site.\n\nNathan\n\nThanks!\n\nI ran a marathon last May, and I play rugby. Nobody in reenacting can drill me until I drop! (Oh, I might get thoroughly bored and quit, but that's different...) - Jonah\n\n8/17/04\n\nJonah:\n\nI have to agree with the young lady who wrote you on 1.9.04. She was rather unforgiving in her examination, but I must say dead on-point. If you have issues with the Christian faith, then say that, more people will respect you. Attacking a painting simply because it has the words 'Holy Bible' written on the book spine is no reason to criticize an artwork. The pedophilia thing is way over-the-top...... like, whoa, dude, where did that come from over-the-top--- comments like this devastate your credibility. Moreover, I would say that your analysis is clouded by your prejudices.\n\nI also find it really, and I do mean really, hard to believe that you have only received one other negative email. I would think that most reasonable people would find your verbiage offensive. If I may offer one or two unsolicited suggestions (1) stay off the left-wing/Anti-Christian websites and (2) give this up for something more useful.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nJohn\n\nTampa, Florida\n\nSmarmy Christian art isn't Christian faith, thank goodness. You might be surprised to know that I attend church for at least three hours every Sunday and, in fact, lead a men's group. Have for years. - Jonah\n\n1/9/04\n\nHi,\n\nI found your website tonight after looking at the painting \"The Christian General.\" Now I'm POSITIVE that you've gotten a few offending e-mails in the past, but I don't want you to view this one like that. I just want to be straight up with you.\n\nFirst of all, it is simply a matter of human nature that that which one is able to see hidden in another is most certainly there in himself. It's just a fact - like 2 and 2 is 4. So, in light of that fact, I thought you should know that you are the most blatant pedophile I have ever seen. I mean I'm just a 30 year old woman with no ties to the civil war - as far as who I think was right or wrong - and if you can see pedophilia in the paintings of Lee, hmmmmmmmmm. The question is really this - In the painting, \"The Compassionate General,\" what were YOU looking at?????\n\nYou're a freak, dude, and I just thought someone should let you know: )\n\nTara\n\nActually, in the nearly eight years JonahWorld! has been up I have received only one negative e-mail. It's hard for me to believe, but it is so. And that was from a non-reenactor who accused me (and, by extension, all reenactors) of being a pathetic military wannabe. I pointed out to him that I spent four years in the Marine Corps, mustering out as a sergeant, and that closed the discussion.\n\nIf I'm a pedophile it's surely a complete surprise to my twenty year-old son, my sixteen year-old daughter and my thirteen year-old daughter, with whom I have excellent (and wholesomely normal) relations. Not to mention my wife of twenty-three years. (And, I assure you, Mrs. Begone is not the sort of woman to cavort with pedophiles.) This revelation would probably also come as a shock to all of the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts I've led in my eight years as a Scouting leader, and, more recently, to my daughter's cheerleading squad (whom I sometimes refer to as my \"surrogate daughters\").\n\nAs for psychological observations being as exact as math (2 and 2 is 4), I strongly disagree. That's why the social sciences are also called \"soft\" sciences.\n\nOkay, okay, perhaps I was looking for something to lambaste the LHAP artist with in those Lee studies and tried too hard. Or... perhaps, being a diligent parent and a male who has seen somewhat of the seedier instincts in his fellow man, I am overly suspicious. (There were a couple of genuine pedophiles in scout troops I know of while I was serving.) It's just that painted depictions of good ol' Grampa Lee snugglin' up with them purty lit'l children kind of gives me the creeps, ya know? \"Son, mah rheumatism is kickin' up agin. Give th' General a little rub on th' upper leg, will'ya?\" Brrr.\n\nOr maybe, as a child I was molested by a bearded old man and, as a defense mechanism, managed to entirely submerge the memory - but it still bubbles forth in my writing from time to time.\n\nAnyway, I'm not a perv. Thank you, however, for being straight up with me!\n\nJonah Begone\n\n12/5/03\n\nJonah,\n\nI read your review about \"the Blue and the Gray\" and must state that I think you're being a little harsh here. Calling the main character, John Hammond, \"an annoying pacifist wussie\" is a weak comment; especially coming from a Civil War re-enactor who is too much of a \"wussie\" himself to join the real United States military. That's okay though, you go and play with your reenactor friends and try to make it as real as you can--hope no one gets hurt. As for your movie critiques, keep them to yourself and your other buddies around the campfire.\n\nMaj. Dave Clark\n\nWell, this is interesting. In the more than seven years JonahWorld! has been up yours is the first true flame e-mail I have gotten! I was wondering, there, if I would ever get one.\n\nI was in the U.S. Marine Corps for four years, by the way: 1974 - 1978. No, I wasn't drafted. I enlisted. I was honorably discharged as a sergeant. The US government deems me a \"Viet Nam Era Veteran,\" although I was never deployed there. Semper Fi!\n\nJonah Begone\n\np.s. I still think \"the Blue and the Gray\" sucked.\n\n11/5/03\n\nDear Jonah,\n\nI was happily reading along and agreeing with everything you said. Until I got to the bit about John Paul Strain, Nathan Bedford Forrest, and generals in the snow. My personal triumvirate. I hope you get swallowed by a whale.\n\nYour obt. servant,\n\nLillie Ann\n\nAh, but if I were swallowed by a whale, who then would become the Confederates' replacement as a target for scorn?\n\nJohn Paul Strain: Perhaps it's a measure of when I was born (in the mid-Fifties), but a limited edition historical art print in his \"Moon\" series entitled, say, \"Robert E. Lee Moon\" doesn't conjure up a landscape at night.\n\nJonah Begone\n\n7/2/03\n\nCruising the web, researching Edwin Booth, my mouse fell upon your site, and your question about the source of the story of how Edwin unwittingly saved Robert Todd Lincoln.\n\nIn \"The Mad Booths of Maryland\" (1940), the author, Stanley Kimmel, retells the story which he attributes to an article by Robert Lincoln which appeared in \"The Century Magazine\", April 1909.\n\nThen, in Eleanor Ruggles' book, \"Prince of Players\" (1953), a version of the story is told by Adam Badeau which more resembles the form of the story you include on your webpage. If memory serves me right, Adam had a military connection with the White House at the time, and may have heard the story from Robert Todd himself.\n\nThen, again, in Richard Lockridge's \"Darling of Misfortune\" (1932), there is the briefest of mention of the story, saying only the Edwin saved the son of the man who his brother John would later kill.\n\nWhat I find odd is that Asia Booth Clarke, Edwin's sister, makes no reference to the story at all in her biography of her brother which she wrote as part of a series of bios on great American actors. It may be that Edwin never told her the story, or that she decided not to include it as a snub for the treatment the family underwent following the assassination. Whereas Edwin may have been respected and allowed to remain at house arrest, the rest of the family fared worse. The older brother, June, and Asia's husband spent almost a month in a jail cell. And, while Edwin may have been content with house arrest, the rest of the family was not. Especially when they were all confined in their mother's home in NYC. The Booths were not a small family.\n\nThis has been a rather long answer, with a few extra bits thrown in. Hope they help. I, myself, am searching for a copy of the article from The Century Magazine. I want to include some of the text in my play that I am writing about Edwin's life.\n\nIf you have any leads on anything else that has connection to Edwin, I would be more than happy to learn of them.\n\nI will visit your website every so often to see if there's anything new.\n\nHave a good life,\n\nBert\n\n3/10/03\n\nJonah - Highlight of my weekend to discover your site! I laughed out loud at a couple parts of your limited edition art prints critique. I, too, had seen a flyer with that Gallon painting of the town burning in the distance (being \"nuked\") and wondered why anyone would want to display such a thing.\n\nI can see it in a museum, but not in a private home. (Unless somebody hated the town of Carlisle, Pennsylvania, or something like that.)\n\nI had the good fortune of having Mort Kunstler respond to a \"snail mail\" letter I sent to him once. I was sympathizing with him after Don Troiani had taken sort of a veiled potshot at him in a Civil War magazine article. To make a long story short, it was just a case of Troiani preaching the obsessive historical accuracy gospel again. I joked about how the belt buckles would have to have their origin and history recorded in the accompanying literature, it would seem. Well, people are entitled to their opinions.\n\nI just can't see the point of excruciatingly authentic art. Real art, it seems to be, can be independent of hobnails on the bottoms of brogans, etc.\n\nI'm in Minnesota which is pretty removed from the re-enacting scene, although there is a First Minnesota Regiment group which I saw at a parade. Women with infants complained about the loud noises of the guns.\n\nI used to reenact with the 1st Minnesota in Maryland (1984-1985) and saw your guys a number of times for events down there. (I also used to write articles for their newsletter - see entry for 3/10/03.)\n\nI'm trying to encourage discussion of the \"Gods and Generals\" movie, which, alas, is not going to be a classic. It can't even hold a candle to \"Gettysburg,\" I feel, although the re-enacting community may like it. The new movie has the same problem as art prints. It's so scared of having one hair out of place in terms of historical accuracy, it forgot that it had to be a good movie.\n\nThe new movie falls short of \"Gettysburg\" in every respect I can think of. Will there be a \"Part 3\" no matter how badly the current movie bombs? Who will Stephen Lang play in Part 3? Jefferson Davis? I'm irritated by the fact that Lang, who did such a great job as Pickett in \"Gettysburg,\" turned around and played Stonewall. They should have found a completely fresh actor for Stonewall. I'm also amused that two very well-known critics completely disagree on whether Duvall or Sheen made a better Lee. My own opinion: Sheen. Duvall had the advantage of being a winner in the new movie (i.e. winning battles), while Sheen had to taste defeat, but I felt Sheen was much better, exuded more personality. I've read where Lee had an \"effeminate\" air about him, in a certain way. Sheen was much more like that.\n\nIs it just me, or did the new movie lack the high-pitched \"Rebel yell,\" which was so noticeable in \"Gettysburg?\" Did someone get to Ron Maxwell and say that the yell made the southerners look like a bunch of screaming idiots?\n\nGood questions. Perhaps somebody thought it was undignified or something...\n\nAlso of interest: Every Civil War movie in which Ted Turner is involved has the song \"Bonnie Blue Flag\" inserted prominently somewhere. Turner's cameo is part of the newest rendition. In the \"Hunley\" movie, Donald Sutherland led people singing the song in a Charleston theater as shells were falling on the city. In \"Gettysburg\" it was an instrumental. (It's interesting how the Confederates could tote along musical instruments, presumably with valve oil etc., when half of them were starving.) If Maxwell has succumbed to putting a Confederate \"spin\" on this trilogy, how will this be handled in \"Last Full Measure,\" when presumably the Union takes over and wins?\n\nHe'll have the version Union lyrics to Bonnie Blue Flag playing, I guess.\n\nI read the book \"The Killer Angels\" before I saw \"Gettysburg,\" and can fully see why Ken Burns was so inspired by it. It was a great book. The Burns series was great. \"Gettysburg\" the movie was great.\n\nWell, we part company there. I thought it was boring.\n\nWhy couldn't it just end there? \"Gods and Generals\" is where they Jump the Shark! I read the paperback of \"The Killer Angels\" and found so many typographical errors, I started over at the beginning to document them, and then wrote a letter to the author care of the publisher.\n\nThe standard for printed English isn't what it was thirty or forty years ago. I find typos all the time in printed works. I blame a declining grammatical education in the US. People don't know how to parse sentences or spell anymore, and they think it doesn't matter. It does!\n\nI then read about two days after sending the letter that the author was dead. Was the letter forwarded to the son, who presumably wrote the new book? I don't know; I never got an answer. I say \"presumably\" because I have a sneaking suspicion a ghostwriter may have been involved. Through reading on the web I learned that the son's professional background was not in writing and that he had never before written a book. I cannot believe that he just sat down and turned out \"Gods and Generals.\" If I'm wrong, may lightning strike me.\n\nI purchased one Dale Gallon and one Mort Kunstler art print, both accenting Union subject matter. It's amazing how the Union stuff is buried under the flood of Confederate topics. You might say the Union paintings are a \"loss leader\" in the field. Joshua Chamberlain seems to be the only real marketable Union character. Back when I followed this field, U.S. Grant seemed to be nonexistent. Grant was a \"brass tacks\" leader who eschewed the pageantry of war, thus he is of little interest to the artists.\n\nI like the Grant art that came out just after the Civil War. Engravings, that sort of thing.\n\nI think it's neat to be a Civil War enthusiast, as long as you put it in its proper perspective, in that we are 100 per cent distanced from the events depicted, and that a sober assessment would have these subjects pushed from our collective memory as much as possible, such was the tragedy and pain entailed. But as a writer once observed, the battlefield had an \"eerie beauty\" to it.\n\nMany battlefields do. I am now heavily into studying ancient Troy, a place I would love to visit.\n\nIt's been fun writing this e-mail. I'm just wrapping up my \"Sunday night shift\" here at the Morris Sun Tribune in Morris, Minnesota, where I'm the associate editor.\n\nYour text betrays your occupation!\n\nMorris, incidentally, has an old home that was built by the son of Secretary of War Stanton. It has a stately quality but is deteriorating. If I remember the story right, the son was heading west, fell ill, and liked the hospitality here so much he settled here. I believe he eventually moved on (persuaded by his wife, if I recall right, because maybe she didn't like this \"Gopher Prairie\" existence.) We also have a miniature version of the \"Running Rifleman\" statue (from Gettysburg) at our local cemetery, because the man who posed for the sculpting of that statue lived here. The story is that this person served in place of someone else who had bought his way out of the war, thus the man was known as both \"Smith\" and \"Zimmerman,\" one being his real name, the other the name of his \"sponsor\" as it were. I'll keep reading your site in the future!\n\nBrian Williams\n\nMorris, Minnesota\n\nThanks!

I know this because I was present at the 50th anniversary of D-Day at Virginia Beach.\n\nI too, have found myself foolishly pontificating about \"how great the battle was....\" at some recent WWII events I've attended like I'm some \"all-knowing\" idiot. Thanks for that article.\n\nJay Sproat\n\nThanks for the kind comments! The article you refer to was written by Jeff Hendershott. I wrote the original one and he did a follow-up. I guess we're easily annoyed...\n\nI guess the warning is that we all can suffer from being pompous old fools if we're not careful. Maybe the best thing in life is to become proficient in one thing and, before Elder Statesmanship sets in, go on to a new thing as an amateur?\n\nJonah Begone\n\n12/9/02\n\nIn your Vernors article, you write,\n\n\"Believe it or not the technique and formula remains: Vernors is still aged for years in 47-gallon oak barrels. ...\n\nThe exact ingredients are a closely-held corporate secret. It's safe to assume there's ginger or ginger flavoring in there and perhaps also cinnamon. .... \"\n\nThey say,\n\nIngredients: carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar, natural and artificial flavors, caramel color, citric acid, sodium benzoate (a preservative) (http://www.bevnet.com/reviews/vernors/facts.asp)\n\n\"Corn\" syrup was not used widely until after 1906. Dr. Wiley, who worked on the first Food and Drug Act, was highly opposed to it as a food adulterant that it is. We know now that it triggers fat storage and increase triglycerides, unfortunately it is in damn near everything, including some spaghetti sauces!\n\nIn short, I doubt the original recipe included ANY of the current ingredients except 'water.' Perhaps the 'natural ingredients' is ginger, perhaps not! Who can say? They don't. Seems like they would if it were true as it would be a selling point, wouldn't it?\n\nSorry, I don't mean to offend, I'm just a stickler for the facts. Best wishes. :-)\n\nAllen Whipps\n\nI got the phrase \"the technique and formula remains\" from the Old Farmer's Almanac, my original source for the article. I suppose the company has updated the formulation somewhat. For instance, Coke used to be made with \"sugar,\" period. Now they - like Vernor's - have switched to corn syrup because it's cheaper. Is the taste the same? We cannot know. The original tasters are all dead! But it's safe to assume that the \"natural flavors\" are their trade secret (like Coke's) and they won't give that away to satisfy curiosity! - Jonah\n\n12/9/02\n\nI just thought I would let you know that your review of the Civil War art was completely stupid. They are both disgraceful and uneducated. Simply put, you are a moron.\n\nJosh McCain\n\np.s. Thank you for including me on your wonderful web page! You're still a moron.\n\n11/20/02\n\nMy name is John R Walker, founder of the DCDDR - the first Warsaw pact reenactment group in the USA. I found you through this page: Reenactors: America's Strength in Reserve!. You mentioned Warsaw Pact reenactors and I was intrigued, being that I started the first group in the USA. With your statement made on your web page about going to war with reenactors we are ready to join the call. Although we kind of have to do this anyway because most of us are active duty military.\n\nI founded the D.C.D.D.R. Grenztruppen on June 25, 2001 as a Warsaw Pact collecting and reenacting group, based in the Washington, DC area. Our club name, which stands for the \"District of Columbia German Democratic Republic Border Guard\", was formed by a group of local amateur historians and collectors that, in conjunction with our brother organization the DDR Militaria Club, now boast worldwide membership. Both these internet-based clubs are dedicated to the education and preservation of this era in history.\n\nOur members have received the honor of appearing in full uniform to provide visual and informational accompaniment to the Newseum's Berlin Wall display and as an Honor Guard for the pre-opening party at the International Spy Museum. We are currently working on future events with Mr. Francis Gary Powers Jr., founder of the Cold War Museum.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJohn R Walker\n\nFounder of the DCDDR\n\n4/1/01\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI just read your closet pacifist article, and with a few exceptions, I agree wholeheartedly.\n\nI am a veteran of the uniformed services, though not a combat veteran, and I agree with you about some of the inconsistencies in The Hobby. I recently attended my first real living history event at Andersonville, playing a federal prisoner (my unit is a dual impression unit). I think this event is must for all reenactors, so they understand the horror of the \"good old days\".\n\nI believe reenactors should spend more time reading diaries; they would see that even after \"hardening\" soldiers were still weary of the death and destruction they saw as daily life.\n\nWhy am I in the hobby? I enjoy living out a small part of the past, but I like the ability to transcend the modern world and escape... reenacting is escapism, pure and simple. I enjoy the camaraderie of my unit, and yes, I like the excitement of a battle.\n\nPart of me wants to get to know the life of the soldier, but more of me likes to just get out of our modern fast-paced world and enjoy the outdoors with good friends who have a similar interest. I am not a hardcore. I try to be as authentic as I can be... but I enjoy the hobby more with my new (and new-to-reenacting) wife along with me.\n\n\"No one desires peace more than the soldier, for he must pay the ultimate sacrifice in war\" - Gen. Douglas MacArthur\n\nRobert W. Hughes\n\nCo. G 28th GA Inf/Co D 123d NY Inf\n\n2/1/01\n\nDear Jonah,\n\nIt does seem a bit strange to be writing to a man who wears a paper bag over his head and uses an alias name conjuring up images of whales that swallow men (which of course leads to stories of puppets with long noses).\n\nIt's okay once you get used to the muffled sound of my voice and the lack of facial responses.\n\nIt is also with a degree of embarrassment that I admit to having quoted you several times in speaking engagements, and having referred those quotes to the alias \"Jonah Begone\" never once suspecting its bogus nature. Well, people have said of me: \"He's smarter than he looks - but then, he'd have to be.\"\n\nWell, see, that's why I wear a bag.\n\nAnyway, I thoroughly enjoy your writings and was thrilled to find your website, really quite by accident--as seems to be the case with most discoveries in my life. My favorite article is Aging Children of Reenacting, and I have quoted that extensively, at school presentations and at women's group luncheons in Pasadena - where, I'm afraid, much of the audience was over eighty, sound asleep and snoring, or pitching from their seats onto the floor.\n\nMy articles have that very same effect on me.\n\nYou seem a man somewhat of my own dilemma (and possibly dementia): Drawn always to the Civil War, and at the same time examining the peculiar behavior and asking why? (Some of the guys in my reenacting unit are getting quite tired of my questions in this area, I think.)\n\nThis doesn't surprise me. The only people other than you and I who intellectualize about reenacting are academics - and they invariably ruin everything they touch.\n\nIn recent reenacting years I have also been embroiled in a mid-life crisis phase of life, so some unkind people tell me (family members mostly). I don't necessarily believe that - and I certainly don't want to hear it.\n\nOh, I can tell you all about MLC for males; I'm going through it now myself. It's real. Sometimes, sitting at my desk at work, I get these overwhelming waves of despair and anxiety over the passing of time. It seems to happen most often in the summer months, for some reason. My guess is that it's because I'm not playing any rugby in the summer - the regular seasons are spring and fall. Anyway, MLC seems to be alleviated somewhat by exercise.\n\nBut I have been working on a website, when time permits, currently bearing the long title: Off To the Civil War - The Search for John Wesley Hargrave - (or How I survived my mid-life crisis). The site can be found at civilwarsaga.homestead.com. The site is a Civil War reenacting, Wilder's Brigade ancestor research, and mid-life crisis story, all thrown into one jumbled concoction; or as I sometimes coin the abbreviated title: \"Off To The Civil War -- A Mid-life Crisis Adventure\" (Portions of this work were previously published.)\n\nAnyway, as my web story is slowly translated into the virtual world, out there somewhere, I would probably like to quote you at some point, and perhaps add a link to your site on my home or links page. I was hoping that would be Ok with you.\n\nThat's fine with me!\n\nI also have a Civil War musket storage box web site, where I sell musket crates with a somewhat vintage, semi-authentic look--I suppose at ridiculous prices. It is actually just a hobby with me, not a vocation. I find just enough business from it to afford me a day's worth of mental activity and exercise once a month (that works out to about two boxes-which is all I care to do). I would like to put a link to your website there also. You can check this site out at musketboxes.homestead.com. You can also get there from the civilwarsaga.homestead.com site.\n\nWell, that's all for now, unless I hear back from you - in which case you may never see the end of my correspondence. So be careful.\n\nThank you for all of your humor, entertainment, and great writing.\n\nVery best regards,\n\nRon Safstrom\n\nThanks for writing, Ron! - Jonah\n\n1/19/01\n\nJonah,\n\nHello! I just wanted to drop you a note to tell you that I really enjoy your site!! Even though I am very green in the hobby, I laugh so hard at some of the things I can relate to in the stories. I've gotten so in to the hobby in this my first year, buying over $1300 in stuff, my unit named me the sutler whore. Keep up the good work and may I'll run in to you at an event one day... brown bag and all!\n\nTake care!\n\nMichael L. Colosimo\n\n105th Pennsylvania\n\n10/30/00\n\nJonah,\n\nBy sheer chance I happened to stumble across your page on LHAPs and decided to read it through. I haven't laughed this hard in some time! Your observations were very direct and, well, valid - to use a much-abused phrase from the world of art criticism.\n\nI often run across these items in galleries and have been moved to wonder just who buys them. Alas, your page doesn't really answer that question but I do feel like you've done a better job of point out their sheer foolishness than I ever could.\n\nBest regards,\n\nKen Strayhorn\n\nDuke University\n\nDurham NC\n\nP.S - if it matters, I'm a life-long Southerner.\n\n4/4/00\n\nHello Jonah,\n\nThe weather is cold and rainy. I'm unable to work on the house so I thought I would surf.\n\nA few years past I was really into reenacting. However, to use Matt Stylo's words, the \"hardcores vs. farbs\" got to be a little much.\n\nWell, I've moved on to a respectable computer job. The \"reenacting\" bug bit me. However, this is not mere Civil War reenacting. I'm building a German Fokker Eindecker EIII of the great war. Here is a link to the aircraft web site http://www.airdromeairplanes.com\n\nWhen I finish my aircraft, I look forward to lazy flights over the Michigan countryside. Also, I can have the happy thoughts of being invited to attend three or four local airshows per year. The going rate is free hotel rooms, free meals, two free fill ups of gas, and VIP treatment at the airshows.\n\nIt sure beats paying $7 for straw and water at a reenactment.\n\nBest of luck on your site. I love your writing.\n\nWilhelm, the Michigan Baron\n\n...and good luck to you, Wilhelm. Perhaps some day I'll see you buzzing by... - Jonah\n\n3/19/00\n\nJ.B. --\n\nI recently stumbled upon the your site: a fortuitous accident. Truly the most entertaining time-sink in cyberspace. I'm thrilled that someone in the reenactment (note: not 'living history') community has the sanity and intelligence to point out so eruditely that the proverbial emperor is underclothed.\n\nAnd I say this as an intermittent reenactor (WWII--like C.W. but the scary rednecks wear SS camo), in fact one who enjoys the whole business in small doses, and as one of the precious few 'real' historians (thanks for making that distinction) running around in repro garb.\n\nI hope your work has the cleansing effect on the hobby it deserves to. At the least, it's thought-provoking and hugely entertaining.\n\nKeep up the great stuff!\n\nDr. John Schindler\n\n2/14/00\n\nJonah,\n\nI just wanted to drop a line to say hi, and of course to put in my comments about your site.\n\nI know this probably sounds totally UnCivil Warish, but I'm the bugler in our group. And yes I am a girl.\n\nIt may sound un-Civil War-ish but it sounds completely Civil War reenactingish!\n\nFirst, my unit is called the First Illinois Light Horse Artillery. We are cavalry and artillery combined, and instead of wearing the yellow of a cavalry soldier we wear the red of an artillery soldier. I am told that it was not a real unit during the Civil War. Have you ever heard of a unit by that name?\n\nNope.\n\nAnd also were there units of mounted artillery?\n\nUh... I'm not sure. Artillery units had horses to pull the equipment, of course, but I don't think they were referred to as \"mounted.\" (That conjures up some funny images.)\n\nI've been looking on the internet, because I've just recently become interested in finding out.\n\nI just finished reading some of the previous letters sent to you, and something someone said caught my eye. I believe it was the 14 year old Yankee from Mississippi looking for a unit. But he made a comment along the lines of something about gun grabbers. I agree with him. The government is getting worried about gun control, and I'm concerened for our hobby. Would the governments passing of a gun control law effect our hobby in any way?\n\nIt depends on what kind of gun control law it is. There are many gun control laws on the books right now, and we still reenact.\n\nIf so in which ways??\n\nIt depends. It's a complex issue. The state and federal laws are often a tangled mess.\n\nNo more muskets or pistols??\n\nIt depends. But so far nobody seems willing to stop historical reenactments, unless it's an unintended consequence.\n\nHow can we reenact without them?????\n\nWe cannot reenact credibly without muskets!\n\nWould the passing of a law seriously jeopardize out hobby and in the worst case shut us down????\n\nOh, I suppose this is possible. Not likely, but possible. When historical programs - which are popular with the public - get shut down because of unintended consequences of gun laws, there's media coverage and a disgruntled public.\n\nNow on a happier note I just wanted to say that I love your site. I go to it at least once a week just to jump on the new news.\n\nThank you. I have made it easier to find what you're looking for by adding a search box; something I've wanted for a long time. Now I need to title all the articles so people don't get all \"no title\" returned from searches.\n\nOh and before I go I wanted to add that I loved the Ross Kimmel Centenial Memoirs.\n\nI liked them, too. There's a lot of good comments about them in the Camp Chase Gazette, too.\n\nI'm sure I've talked your ear off by now, and I'm sorry for that. I'm often told I talk too much, and I guess it's true. I'll let you go for now, and hope that you have a chance to get back to me on my questions.\n\nCarol Netemeyer\n\n1st Illinois Light Horse Artillery\n\nBartelso, IL\n\nThanks, Carol!\n\nJonah Begone\n\n2/1/00\n\nHello Jonah\n\nEnjoy your work. It adds a sense of reality to this great hobby of ours. (Yes I did say \"reality\". I spent almost 30 years working for the Department of Defense and believe me, your viewpoint is closer to military reality than you can imagine.)\n\nOne show I'd like to add to your tv critique is an episode from the Twilight Zone called \"An Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge\". That was one chilling episode!!!!!!\n\nKeep up the good work and see hope to see ya at sea someday.\n\nDan Cashin\n\nWBS Naval Reenactor\n\nI mention \"Occurance\" briefly in my first movie article. It's the only French Ambrose Bierce short story adaptation that doesn't suck! It was also used as an episode in Twilight Zone, but started life as a movie short subject. The same \"He (or she) is dead but doesn't know it\" theme is found in one of my all-time favorite horror films, \"Carnival of Souls\" as well as the recent film \"The Sixth Sense.\" It's also the theme in the film \"Jacob's Ladder\" and the more obscure \"Lulu on the Bridge.\" I'm pretty sure an excellent film noir features this, too: \"Point Blank.\" Oh, it's also the connecting story in the British horror anthology \"Dr. Terror's House of Horrors.\" Come to think of it, it was also the main theme of a couple of Twilight Zone episodes, \"The Hitch-Hiker\" and \"The Passerby.\"\n\nGee, I guess it's time to give the idea a rest! - Jonah\n\n1/18/00\n\nDear Jonah\n\nI recently read the article 'Battle Acts' by Tony Horwitz that you posted on your site, and I was prompted to write to you about a couple of things that puzzled me.\n\nFirstly, allow me to introduce myself. I have only been doing this re-enacting lark for around four years over here in the UK - so I'm still pretty new at it.\n\nA U.K. reenactor... that's interesting. I've always been fascinated by the fact that people in a nation with so much history would choose to reenact the American Civil War!\n\nIf you were to take a scale from 'farb' through 're-enactor' to 'hard core', I guess I would be near the 'hard core' end of 're-enactor'. That is to say that I strive to give an authentic impression of a soldier from the 1860's without sharing the masochism of the true 'hard core' enthusiast.\n\nMy clothes are grubby-looking (stained with wood-dye to look dirty, but freshly laundered after every event)\n\n...and there you vary from the American super hard core in that they don't have their clothes laundered at all!\n\nand I try to eat authentic food (bread, cheese and chicken mostly, with fresh corn as a snack). I tend towards the 'tubby bearded guy' in appearance, but as I portray an officer - the company surgeon, to be precise - I feel I can get away with being slightly better fed (although I would prefer to shed a few more pounds).\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nNow without wishing to disparage other enthusiasts, I found myself confused by a few things that were mentioned in the article.\n\nFirstly, this idea of pissing on your buttons in order to give them an authentic 1860's patina. Surely the oxidation seen on buttons from that period has developed during the time that they have been kept in museums. Back in 1861 those buttons would be pretty shiny and new, so wearing buttons that look 150 years old is wrong, surely. In all of the photographs I have seen from that period, the buttons look bright. O.K. so the average soldier probably wouldn't have had time to polish them, but they would certainly not be covered in verdigris, I would think.\n\nI have never understood this either, and I have no light to shed on the matter. As I general rule, I try to minimize the weirdness I encounter at events, so I stay away from the hardcore wackos. Needless to say I don't challenge them on the subject of green buttons, which makes no sense to me, either.\n\nSecondly, I have never read anything about the practice of 'spooning' in any of the books that I have used to research my role. It is certainly true that both officers and men would roll up in blankets and lie on the bare earth when on campaign, but not once have I come across the term. Perhaps it was something they thought it best not to document.\n\nI've encountered it before in CW literature, but I can't remember where. Maybe in \"Hard Tack and Coffee,\" maybe in a book like it. But it is mentioned.\n\nHaving said that, I personally have never spooned with anyone but my wife, thank you very much. (But then, I play rugby, so I am a second row forward - which is just as much body contact with other males as spooning, so I really can't talk.)\n\nThirdly, in his account of the breakfast of salted pork provided by Rob Hodge he described it as tasting 'like a soggy cube of salt' which leaves me to think that it had been simply taken out of a haversack and fried. As I understand it, this was not the case in the war. The pork was salted in order to preserve it, but in order to eat it you had to soak it in water overnight to remove most of the salt and then fry it the next day. Nobody in 1860 would think of trying to eat salt pork 'as it was'.\n\nVery true. At one of my very first events in Utah I bought some fatback and tried to eat it without removing the salt with a good amount of water. It didn't work. It was a memorable dining experience. So the next time I hung it in a river in a bag for a few hours, which resulted in a product somewhat more digestible. I gave it up entirely as being too much of a pain (both preparationwise and indigestionwise).\n\nremember reading an account of the 4th Texas (the unit that I am a member of) being surprised by an attack just before they were about to eat, and they were forced to march on hungry because the food was in the process of being prepared, which also made it impossible to take with them. Cornflour had been made into dough but not cornbread, meat was soaking but uncooked, etc. .\n\nFinally, the thought that struck me hardest was that the soldiers that suffered the privations of war did not do so willingly, but were forced to endure it by circumstance. If they had been given the option of sleeping in a nice warm cabin or shivering in a cold muddy ditch, my bet is they would choose the former.\n\nOf course - they weren't fools!\n\nIronically, my feeling is that if those 'hard core' men of the war could be magically transported to a modern re-enactment they would instantly become the biggest 'farbs' in the area! \"Forget head-lice, give me an RV and some cold beer!\" would replace the 'Rebel Yell'.\n\nWell, they didn't really have \"reenactments\" per se when the real soldiers were alive, but they did have encampments. (Oftentimes on the battlefields.) And guess what? They stayed in big tents with camp furniture. Not merely because they were old, I think, but because they had had enough of camping privation. (A refrain I hear from a lot of Vietnam veterans is, \"I did enough of that during the war. No thank you.\")\n\nI suppose that none of this really matters as long as the participants are having fun - however they define it, which is the point of the whole exercise after all. Isn't it?\n\nRichard Edwards\n\n(a.k.a. Surgeon Major John C Jones, 4th Texas)\n\nYes. One man's privation is another man's recreation!\n\nThanks for writing!\n\nJonah\n\n1/4/00\n\nStumbled onto your article \"But is It Art?\" this morning. Thank you! I kept wondering if it was just me or why it is that much of the historical art done nowadays fills me with wonder at the artist's eye for detail, but little else. For all the authenticity, there is little soul.\n\nAgreed, agreed, agreed.\n\nNo wonder \"Scotland Forever!\" makes my pulse quicken, and the Gettysburg Cyclorama continues to thrill me, despite the many inaccuracies in both works. They have soul; they're rooted in the firm conviction that art should move us in some way. The French revolutionary artist David seems to have known this too.\n\nYes - David's art helps me to understand the passions behind the French revolution better than anything else!\n\nTW, who would you consider the finest \"historical artists,\" both living and dead - those whose work transcends being genre artists? Thanks again.\n\n>+-:-) Rob Weaver\n\nHmmm - good question! Well, I like Frederick Remington, of course - despite the fact that he painted brass grommets on shelter halves! (It's true. I saw the original in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.)\n\nIlya Repin is a wonderful Russian historical artist. I included his painting of the Murder of the Tsarevich because it moves me at the enormity of the crime, but his other paintings are masterful, too. (He did one of some Cossacks that compelled me to buy a Borodin LP which featured it as cover art.)\n\nDavid, of course.\n\nUh, who was that Victorian fellow who painted the standing Federal soldiers firing rounds at the viewer? I like that a lot... name escapes me. Gilbert Gaul.\n\nA gulity pleasure of mine is Arnold Friberg! I get a kick out of his Book of Mormon paintings. Even the children are buff.\n\nAugust Saint-Gaudens in sculpture, of course. His \"Shaw's Colored Regiment\" has been rightly called the greatest single American sculpture. (His coinage designs weren't bad, either!)\n\nI must admit a fondness for the guy who used to do paintings for the National Geographic books. Name escapes me. His Civil War image was the VMI cadets. He also did one of the Battle of Hastings that I liked. Oh, what's his name? (Another \"senior moment.\") Tom Lovell! That's it!\n\nGeorge Caleb Bingham. I like \"the Jolly Flatboatmen.\"\n\nI understand it's now okay to express an admiration for the work of Norman Rockwell, so I will. (If you want to label me bourgeois, go ahead, but it's rare to find an artist so skilled in human expression.)\n\nGrant Woods. (Perhaps not a \"historical artist.\")\n\nI'll stop here.\n\nJonah Begone\n\n12/20/99\n\nHello, My name is Tyler Underwood I am a union re-enactor with the 64th O.V.I. and I have looked at your site many times and I think you have some very funny things.\n\nThanks!\n\nI am e-mailing you because I have a complaint about straw and hay bales that are used at events. I can understand the importance of having them for camp, but when you walk into camp and see so-called hardcore re-enactors with bales laying around I just have to laugh at them. I am not sure if people realize that there was know such thing as hay or straw bales during the time of the Civil War.\n\nAs for me, I know that there was such a thing as straw, so I happily strew it around in my tent to sleep on. But you're talking about the square bales.\n\nAnd the thing that I really get a kick out of is when you see them on the battlefield and the men are using them for cover to shoot behind.\n\nIt wouldn't do a real good job of stopping a bullet!\n\nYou see these hard cores (and they call others farbs) but what they don't know is that they are hiding behind a product that came from machinery that wasnt invented until the 1920's. So if you could knock on the use of bales in re-enactments I would appreciate it. Thanks\n\nCpl. Tyler Underwood\n\n64th Ohio\n\nActually, I tend to leave people alone about authenticity. There are so many others who are willing to take up rhetorical cudgels for that cause... - Jonah\n\n10/31/99\n\nDear Jonah:\n\nAfter spending about three hours on-line reading snippets of your page, let me say, with all sincerity:\n\nWOW!\n\nI am very much impressed w/ your work as a historian, a living historian, and a eagle-eyed critic of historic reenactment. Your pithy opinions, background work tracing down \"farb,\" and web publication of the memoirs of Ross M. Kimmel has undoubtedly earned you a significant number of footnotes in my eventual doctoral dissertation. These items are also going to provide me wonderful ammunition in a CW conference I'm attending next week at the Huntington Library, especially as I already know of two papers to be read on reeenactment come from the pens of PC scholars w/ agendas....which are apt to be deflated by primary evidence from your prolific pen."
