        "text": "By: Anna Faktorovich, PhD\n\nSubversive Satires on Christmas and All It Stands for\n\nCharles Dickens. A Christmas Carol & Other Stories. 438pp, images. ISBN: 978-0-198822394. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018 (2006).\n\n*****\n\nThis is a collection of religious-themed and fairy-tale style short stories from Charles Dickens. Since writing my dissertation and first academic book on Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities (1859), I am always happy to read something unique from him. Dickens’ ran his own publishing company and was busy writing and creating from his early days as a journalist to his last as a periodical-operator, fiction writer, and public speaker. He had a wide range of styles and genres across a lifetime career. Despite my deep affection for Dickens, I requested this book with reservations. I have an allergy to the Christmas Carol (1843), which I partially blame for the formulaic Christmas story plotline that dominates the winter releases among films and books. I was hoping this story was the exception in the collection, but I have learned that as a professional writer, Dickens was willing to write based on public-demand purely for money. Unlike his complex novels, these stories are choppy with short paragraphs and sentences, almost as if they were written by a different author from Barnaby Rudge (1841) or David Copperfield (1850). The divergence in style cannot be explained by its timing, as Barnaby was released before the Carol. Dickens distaste for the moralist tale genre is perhaps what makes these stories so difficult for me to read. The Christmas Carol is a story about Ebenezer Scrooge, who “hates Christmas and all it stands for” but ghostly visitors in three apparitions convince him to warm up to it. Just as Tale of Two Cities is a subversive pro-rebellion novel, I believe this story is an anti-Christmas story. If Dickens’ spirit was in this holiday, he would have utilized detailed and heart-pinging descriptions, but instead he uses a wide brush to mock blind religiosity. In the ending, Scrooge decides to live “upon the Total Abstinence Principle”, which the editor comments refers to: “a joking reference to temperance campaigners, many of them associated with the Methodist movement, who encouraged the public to ‘take the pledge’ by swearing to avoid all alcoholic drinks.” This same sentence ends that Scrooge also began keeping “Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge” of how to do so. There is a satirical contradiction between been abstinent of drinks and keeping a holiday “well”. Most celebrators, drink on Christmas and other major holidays as part of observing these holidays. Dickens seems to be poking fun here at the hypocrisy of hyper-religious people who insist on celebrating a Christian holiday with alcohol, a substance that is condemned by the Bible and other religious sources as sinful. In the paragraph before last, Dickens pokes fun at the comedic formula with which Scrooge undergoes a character transformation: “Some people laughed to see the alteration in him… he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed…” (83). If ghosts scared a grumpy old man into celebrating a holiday by raising the “salary” of one of his workers and to “assist” a “struggling family”, as well as to eat a “Christmas bowl of smoking bishop” with these charity cases, surely this transformation is forced for the sake of giving readers the happy ending they anticipate. The “smoking bishop” is slang for “red wine, oranges, sugar, and spices, so called because it is said to be the same colour as a bishop’s cassock”, according to the editor. Since Scrooge’s drinking directly contradicts his insistence on abstinence, and both references are made in slang-code, which might not be obvious to nearly all readers, these are subversive references that contradict the surface meaning. The turn-around of a grumpy character into a good one has been an established formula readers buy into for many centuries, and Dickens forced this ending despite clearly laughing at its absurdity. The other works in this collection are repetitions of this same formula, which Dickens cashed in on himself after the Carol’s surprising success: The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846), and The Haunted Man (1848). These were so fiscally successful that Dickens funded his own periodical, Household Words (1850-9) and then All the Year Round (1859-70). Having control as editor of these journals allowed Dickens to publish his most radical works, including Bleak House and Tale of Two Cities in serial form before releasing them as volumes. Chimes does not have the same subversive jokes in its final paragraphs, but it also lacks the tension that has particularly popularized the Carol in modern re-makings.\n\nTo summarize, this is a great book for anybody who either believes in the fairytale of Christmas or who wants to review this potential subversive subtext in these formulaic and hyper-commercial novels. Anybody who plans on making a modern remake should read this entire set of novels rather than only the Carol to understand how it differs from the series. And future remakes should really dig into the footnotes in this text, which are brilliant in this new edition. This is also a great book for most libraries to carry: it’s a sturdy hardcover, and kids should read this original rather than basing their ideas on the Carol on what they see in the movies.\n\nBetween Propaganda and Literature: An Autobiography of Caesar\n\nJulius Caesar; James J. O’Donnell, translator. The War for Gaul: A New Translation. $27.95. 336pp, 5.5X8.5”, 1 map. ISBN: 978-0691174921. Princeton: Princeton University Press, April 30, 2019.\n\n*****\n\nAn ideal book for me is one that might be handy in one of my future research projects. This certainly falls into this category. Anybody writing or researching war in any period in history can benefit from understanding Caesar’s perspective on this subject. As the supreme ruler of one of the world’s first civilized democratic republics, this general’s perception of war helps explain why humanity is still engaging in this barbaric enterprise. The translator’s “Introduction” explains that this is not a book that brushes over the brutalities of war, instead it describes these without guilt, glorifying victory over any suffering winning is causing. O’Donnell explains: “The best reasons for not teaching this book to the young are that it gets war exactly right and morals exactly wrong, and that it achieves a crystalline purity of style that looks easy from every angle but proves to be sternly difficult and demanding when faced flat on. This is a book for the middle-aged and sober, for those who know that the world is not run according to their tastes and never will be, for those who listen best to the author who has truly mastered his language” (viii-ix). This is a very powerful opening. Yes, great books are those that paint the most honest and detailed painting of a time and place, rather than those that hold the approved moral position. Readers should decide if the author is moral; editors and publishers must present evidence to allow them to reach an informed decision. The rest of the introduction continues to be helpful as it summarizes the relevant history and geography, including a detailed map of the region Caesar describes conquering.\n\nCaesar writes in third person about his own exploits. The translator stresses that Caesar “did not set out to write lucid, comprehensive, accurate battle reports,” but rather to “tell a good story, his story” (xlii). As with Hitler’s Mein Kampf, this propagandistic autobiography established Caesar as a military hero, lifting him into a position of national power. Caesar is glorified by most students of military history to this day, so most readers should accept Caesar’s self-aggrandizing positively.\n\nThe text is saturated with military lessons for practicing generals. For example, he writes: “he wanted to leave no enemy behind his back but had no capacity – because of the season – for making war and no desire to let such minor matters come ahead of Britain…” Then, he describes making preparations to sail away by organizing the hostages and troops (96). He puts himself into the hero’s role, taking responsibility for battles as if he slayed the enemies unassisted by troops. The other side is insulted, and is made to appear as insulting to Romans: “They so disrespected us that when we blocked the gates with single rows of turf, seemingly unbreakable, some began to tear down the rampart bare-handed, while others were filling the ditch. Then Caesar burst out from every gate. Swift-rushing cavalry put the enemy to flight, so none could stand to fight at all. He killed a great many and stripped all of their weapons” (135).\n\nThe only thing wanting from this book is more commentary and history-checking from the translator, which he insists he deliberately left out to let the power of Caesar’s fiction stand on its own. Otherwise, this is a book that deserved this new edition after being sidelined out of curriculums. Modern war autobiographies tend to brush over the grotesque because writers refrain from calling themselves war-criminals, or war-mongers, or calling war generally immoral. Caesar cannot be trusted as a narrator because of his self-interest, but he exaggerates the propaganda to such an extreme that the story becomes almost a satire about war crimes rather than a serious defense of conquest. International libraries should benefit from holding this book in their collections. Researchers and creative writers interested in Caesar should find both facts and inspiration in this volume.\n\nIs This Burgess’ Autobiographical Confession of Having Killed His Wife?\n\nAnthony Burgess. Beard’s Roman Women. 208pp, color images. ISBN: 978-1-5261-2803-4. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2019.\n\n**\n\n“Cinematic language”, a term from the cover description, summarizes the problem with this novel: it lacks in description. Anthony Burgess appeared frequently in my graduate courses as a founder and leading figure in the magical surrealism movement. This term suggests to me a more literary version of a Russian novel such as Master and Margarita. Instead, this is more of a pop novel with short, choppy sentences, focused on filmographic actions and empty dialogue. The back cover opens thus: “All widowers, it has been said, feel like murderers. Anthony Burgess draws on an autobiographical episode to create the story of a man hunted by his first wife, presumed dead. But is she? Ronald Beard is a modern-day Orpheus, adrift among the ancient ruins of a purgatorial Rome. There, he finds a new love, only to be rudely interrupted by the old…” The most memorable myth about Orpheus is his attempt to rescue his wife from the underworld with help from his magical music. This hardly equates to a man who might have killed his first wife, and hopes she does not show up to ruin a new relationship. As a critic, I find it very annoying when I encounter these types of allusions that attempt to create a supernatural or metaphorical meaning behind a very down-to-earth or plain story. This same summary stresses that this novel is autobiographical; unless an author believes he or she is Orpheus, how can a work be both autobiographical and mythical? Another troubling element is that apparently Bugess “wrote his text… around… David Robinson’s photographs of Rome”. These photos are included in this book. One of these is a color image of a statue of a man in a top-hat. Across from it are these lines: “‘Jewish refugees?’/ ‘No, stupid, the Jews have won the war. These are all Arab. They have names like Hassan ibn Abdullah and so on. Isa binte Ismail.’” The following page has this line: “The thing to do probably was to go out and get very drunk and daub SCREW THE POPE outside the Sistine Chapel…” (130-2). There are insults across these two pages against all three major world religions: this is democratic slander, but to what purpose? Is this magical realism or spiritualism simply because these are mentioned? Approaching anti-Semites or anti-Muslims at a white-nationalism rally in America today will probably generate similar chatter. The bulk of the story is less heated, with one character saying “‘Darling, darling.’” Another responds: “‘Get on with your work while I’m away. Try to learn some Italian.’” This is the sort of empty dialogue that one might find in the worst romance novels or just poorly written nonsense. Some long paragraphs slip into something akin to “literary” language; for example: “His aloneness was the more intense now because he was surrounded by an alien culture and police force. He went into lo studio where Byron and the Shelleys were waiting, people of his own blood, practitioners of a trade not wholly incognate with his own…” (58-9). He goes on to explain how much he, the author/ narrator, has in common with canonical writers such as Byron and the Shelleys. This is almost like Caesar’s attempt to glorify his exploits: the book seems to have been written as propaganda to support Burgess campaign to be immortalized as a great writer. However, Caesar actually conquered an enormous territory, whereas Burgess fails to capture the craft of even mediocre literary writing. The front cover includes Burgess’ hand-held signature in gold, further aggrandizing. A couple of sentences from the last paragraph summarizes what’s wrong with this novel: “he was, he supposed, as happy as he had ever been in his life. Nothing left undone, and a whole night’s drinking in front of him…” (150). Is this a comedic happy ending of a romance novel? Why is the author compelled to say that he has achieved a climax and has gained happiness from life? The “literary” element here is the joke after this happy resolution, wherein the only thing left to make this ending a bit happier is getting drunk. While this turns the nature of the happiness on its head, it fails to impart a deep literary meaning. The book’s summary promised to explain if the narrator might have killed his wife; the editor further promises that this partial-murder is autobiographical, or Burgess might have semi-killed his wife. And the ending is: Burgess had a happy ending wherein he got drunk and forgot all about this nonsense? It was published in the middle of Burgess’ second marriage, but his first wife did die at only 26. He accused her of being a crazed alcoholic, and it seems she died of alcoholism or some other unknown illness. He remarried in the same year as the first wife’s death, making it likely that he started an affair before her death, and might have driven her to a kind of suicide. And this summary hints at an outright murder. Poe also wrote about his wife, who died young of tuberculosis, but he certainly did not insert insults against random religions or the other nonsense squeezed here. The novel is devoid of grief, which is apparent in Poe and other truly-grief stricken writers who write about their loves. If grief is lacking, why set out to discuss the death? Is this a joke about cold-hearted lack of love for his first wife? Other than the fact that a previous wife is dead, there is nothing surreal here: it isn’t even real.\n\nIt’s always distressing for me to discover that a puffed-up author lacks substance. I hope readers and librarians will stay away from this book: if you are passionate about highbrow literary fiction, it will depress you. If you are seeking a beautiful eulogy, it will repel your sensibilities. And if you are trying to solve a murder-mystery, you’ll have to read a lot of dribble to come out (at best) with a conviction that the narrator is guilty.\n\nTypically and Primarily Oriented Towards the Economic and Social: A New Translation of Weber’s Opus\n\nMax Weber; Keith Tribe, translator. Economy and Society: A New Translation. $24.95. 520pp, images. ISBN: 978-0-674916548. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, April 2019.\n\n*****\n\nThe cover blurb does a fair job of summarizing this new translation of a canonical economic text: “the foundational text for the social sciences of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, presenting a framework for understanding the relations among individual actions, social action, economic action, and economic institutions. It also provides a classification of political forms based upon ‘systems of rule’ and ‘rulership’ that has shaped debate about the nature and role of charisma, tradition, legal authority, and bureaucracy.” Weber’s final philosophical text, it is also the mostly highly regarded for the power of its revolutionary message. The blurbs also promise detailed front-matter, and definitely delivers in this regard. The “Introduction” from the translator, Keith Tribe, is 73 pages long, and each of Weber’s chapters is separately introduced with a few additional introductory pages. These introductions come with copious, closely-researched notes with hundreds of citations. They include the book’s publication and translation histories. One curious subheading is “Weber’s ‘Sociology’”, wherein the translator includes a long paragraph from Weber’s letter in 1920, stressing that he is on a “campaign against ‘sociology’”; he questions if he might have actually become a “‘sociologist (according to my own official title!)’”, pursuing it with an “‘individualistic’ method”, rather than in the terms pre-set for this field (57). Tribe clarifies that the “sociology” presented from the first chapter of this text argues “that the motivation of individual action can inform an understanding of social processes and social orders that transcends the intentions of those who are engaged in them” (65). This is a good introduction to the rest of the text because it clarifies that much of this text is convoluted rather than direct. Definitions of economic and social concepts is given in a run-about way, rather than making direct calls for revolution, as can be found in Marx. For example, here is a definition used by Weber: “A means of exchange is a material object accepted in an exchange that is typically and primarily oriented to the persisting chance that it can, for the foreseeable future, be given in exchange for other goods; presuming that this exchange corresponds to the interest of participants, whether this exchange be for all such goods (general means of exchange) or only for particular goods (specific means of exchange)…” (159). I am currently working on editing my own novel, and one piece of advice from an essay by an editor on quick fixes to writing style is deleting most instances of “that” in a text. This long sentence is a great example of when “that” confuses the subject unnecessarily. The editor also recommends deleting adverbs such as “typically and primarily”. What do these signify? Not much. They really just confuse readers. Without all these verbose digressions, Weber would be left with close to the dictionary definition of “means of exchange”, or the first few words following this term. Why did Weber turn the meaningless added word “primarily” bold here? The word “chance” is also stressed, perhaps to highlight that Weber allows that this “means of exchange” might not be exchanged. But if it will not be exchanged, then it is the opposite of this term, and hence should theoretically be irrelevant to this discussion… And how can an exchange be for “general” goods rather than for “specific” goods. I mean, it is a curious philosophical turn, but in reality, if two parties are going to exchange something, they have to agree what specifically rather than generally they will be exchanging. If I want your coat, and I promise to generally give you “something” in return, I doubt you will surrender your coat under these terms… These types of ambiguities and confusions is the reason books such as this have to be read many times by scholars. While a portion of this theory might be nonsensical in isolation, Weber persistenly builds mountains-upon-mountains and much of it carries a great deal of insight and sense… if only readers can decipher it specifically or generally.\n\nSociologists and economics must read this book, not because it is inspiring or because it is revolutionary or because it is convincing, but rather because it is a canonical text. Everybody else has either read it or has said they read it, but really have not read it. Anybody who manages to read it closely is likely to gain something nobody else has understood about this book before. Too many readers have failed to penetrate this tome cover-to-cover: perhaps you will succeed in this endeavor.\n\nEverything a Small Business Needs to Build a Website\n\nLisa Sabin-Wilson. WordPress: All-in-One. For Dummies. $39.99. 828pp, images. ISBN: 978-1-119-55315-1. Hoboken (NJ): John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2019.\n\n*****\n\nThis is a collection of eight books about WordPress, covering: WordPress basics, setting up, exploring the dashboard, examining SEO, utilizing plugins, customizing your site, publishing your site, and running multiple sites. It is written by Lisa Sabin-Wilson, a co-owner of WebDevStudios, a development company specializing in custom WordPress plugins, themes, and deployments. I have created several of my sites with WordPress, and made a site for one of the authors I have published with Anaphora, so this is a practical topic; I requested this book for review because it might come in handy in building my next website. A few months ago, I was giving a presentation for the Abilene Writers Guild on marketing, and I mentioned that any of them should be able to create their own website. The members of the audience were surprised by this: they seemed to suggest that as a hybrid/ subsidy publisher discussing marketing services I would want to sell the service of creating a website for this group of writers. In truth, building a website for somebody else is a tedious endeavor. And asking an outside contractor to build a WordPress website for you is absurd. This only makes sense if a business needs a highly personalized website with a newly built game or program that performs something WordPress’ current plugins etc. cannot achieve. I recall finding one of these Dummies books in a library or a bookstore when I was building my first website and a WordPress site, in particular, a decade ago. I must have browsed a short version with some basics on site setup. It was simple to follow, and WordPress itself offers sufficient tutorials and how-to content to solve glitches, if they appear. It is also pretty self-explanatory, so that somebody who finds the WordPress site, and clicks to create a site, should build something workable without reviewing how-to pages. There are easier sites to operate, but WordPress approaches the easiest on the market. The “Introduction” clarifies: “Between the hosted service at WordPress.com and the self-hosted software available at WordPress.org, millions of bloggers use WordPress, and to date, WordPress powers 30 percent of the Internet.” It has gained popularity by offering the basic software and access for free (1). While the basic website is super-easy and does not require this thick book to digest, those using WordPress for commercial purposes definitely need to understand some of the specialized topics discussed here. I learned about some of these sporadically over the years. For example, at one point I realized that my gmail email address was not professional. I learned that I needed to have by own URL to create an email address with my company’s name in it: generating director@anaphoraliterary.com. A discussion of related topics is offered in this book in sections such as “Establishing Your Domain”, which even covers the cost of a domain name. Some of the detailed steps can be skipped to save money, while others are essential. For example, I still use a basic near-free version, which does not allow me to insert PayPal buttons or other direct payment gathering mechanisms. Occasionally, it is also challenging to insert videos into this basic model, but with a bit of work this is doable. This book should be especially helpful for those who are building an entirely unique website with much more personalization than simply a pay-button. For example, it dives into “file transfer protocol”, a foreign concept for somebody simply uploading a few book cover images or the like. I even learned that WordPress can be installed onto a web server: I just use their website to edit my sites. I have Dreamweaver from CS6, and perhaps exploring this section later will finally teach me how to perform advance tasks I’ve been avoiding with WordPress. I also learned that my websites are not optimized for security: I don’t know if I’ve ever “enabled multifactor authentication” or disabled “theme and plugin editors”, though it seems these are aimed at those who have more than one user with administrative access to the website (and I’m currently the only Anaphora administrator entering these deep waters). Another reason this is a great book is that it’s as up-to-date as books get: there is a long section on the “Block Editor”, and I believe WordPress only added this feature a few months ago. It took me a while to figure out how to add buttons to allow visitors to share content on social media, and there is a chapter on this here: so it’s an awesome book for somebody setting up a business website for the first time (so they can skip the learning curve). On the downside, the intended audience are programmers rather than average users. One of the problems I still face is figuring out the dimensions a background has to have to fit nicely on varied sizes of computer screens. The section customizing template backgrounds includes computer code, rather than the dpi dimensions or other simple measures and rules regarding this element. I located the background dimensions topic in the following section of the book. This portion observes that the recommended “header media” size is “2000 pixels wide by 1200 high”, but recognizes that this is not likely to be a perfect fit, going on to describe how images can be cropped. I have not seen a “crop” option on WordPress before; either this is a new free feature, or it only comes with a paid theme, or it is only available on the downloadable version of WordPress. I’ll explore this when I’ll next edit the images on my sites.\n\nTo summarize, I have gotten lost in reading this book, and forgot I was writing a review. Thus, this is the perfect book for those who need precise answers to practically execute their website. I doubt anybody can benefit from buying only eighth of this book separately: I think every user need all of these combined components; even if their uses are not immediately apparent, if you continue using WordPress across decades, even very obscure questions covered in sub-sections will come up. Only those setting out to make a website will benefit from this book: and that’s, apparently, 30% of the internet. This is a great addition to any library’s collection: a library that leaves it out is doing a disservice to its small business community.\n\nA Magnificently Exhaustive Archive on Jefferson’s Retirement\n\nThomas Jefferson; J. Jefferson Looney, editor. The Papers of Thomas Jefferson: Retirement Series, Volume 15: 1 September 1819 to 31 May 1820. Hardcover: $150.00. 752pp, images. ISBN: 978-0-691182346. Princeton: Princeton University Press, February 19, 2019.\n\n*****\n\nFor any researcher of American history or literature, there is nothing better than acquiring a collection of historical letters for a private library. Letters tend to be too digressive to comprehend a volume of them in a single sitting. Researchers spend years inside of archival halls reading hand-written letters, straining their eyes in these public gathering places. To have a box-worth of letters that have been transcribed, edited, and fully annotated is an amazing feeling. I can imagine few circumstances (even if I was spontaneously rich) wherein I could ever purchase any book without a course-requirement for my own collection for $150. But, I definitely hope more libraries purchase these types of collections. It is occasionally difficult to access letter collections even from major city libraries, as these rare books have small printings. The quality of this tome from Princeton should allow it wider dissemination.\n\nNearly every letter includes detailed annotations to explain distant history and language. For example, a letter from James Madison from October 23, 1819 is accompanied with a note quoting a separate letter from Ellen W. Rrandloph Coolidge to Dolley Madison from Monticello, expressing she cannot reciprocate a visit because she is caring for her Grandfather. She recommends decreasing exercise and letter writing for better health (152-3). The majority of these notes carefully track every single change made to the original letters, or uncertainties regarding the accuracy of the transcriptions. Handwriting is very difficult to transcribe, and includes a good deal of natural spelling errors resulting from the speediness of the genre, so some corrections have to be made for readability in print; it’s great that these are carefully explained (in case, a researcher might gain something from a slight change of phrase).\n\nThis particular portion of the Princeton Jefferson letters collection is called the Retirement Series, covering these later years. A brief chronology in the opening pages helps to put the years covered into perspective. He served in Continental Congress 1775-6 before drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776. He was Governor of Virginia 1779-81. He died in Monticello in 1826. He was President 1801-9. In the year this volume begins, 1819, Jefferson chartered the University of Virginia, and was elected its rector. Jefferson secured a $60,000 loan for the university from the state legislature to pay for seven months of unpaid construction work on the university Oddly, Jefferson’s debts “greatly increased by bankruptcy of Wilson Cary Nicholas”, for which Jefferson took personal responsibility in repaying. This debt is $20,000 from Jefferson’s “endorsement of notes” for the bankruptcy. Nicholas also served as Governor of Virginia, and became a leading Jeffersonian. Nicholas was a land speculator; the panic of 1819 led to the bankruptcy; Jefferson had cosigned the note and so was left to cover the debt. Nicholas died in 1820, also in the span of this volume. Jefferson’s service for the University of Virginia is his final effort before he began writing his memoir and otherwise fully withdrew from public life. Jefferson also exchanges letters with his enslaved carpenter, John Hemmings, during construction work on Poplar Forest.\n\nThe frontmatter also includes great maps of the plans for the University of Virginia, which include the names of carpenters and finishers involved in the construction. Another map shows the region where Monticello was located. Yet another is a map of the entire state of Virginia from this period. Color images are included in the center of the book, including copies of the original letters, a sculpture bust, a current photo of Monticello’s preserved Tea Room, a drawing of Poplar Forest furniture, a sketch of Monticello’s West Front, an early draft of the plan for the University of Virginia lands in Jefferson’s hand, and an engraving of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe collection is enhanced with official correspondences and formal items such as the Minutes of University of Virginia Board of Visitors, in which Jefferson participated on October 4, 1819. The minutes detail the progress the of the construction effort (80). Many of the letters touch on the various difficulties Jefferson faces as a plantation owner and operator. For example, on February 15, 1820, he writes to James H. McCulloch: “a rain flooded our river, carried off the ice and floated our board, which set me afloat again after 7 months exclusion from market.” He reports this to explain his fiscal difficulties; he attaches $67 (396). Other letters offer curious political insights. For example, Jefferson writes to Mark Langdon Hill on April 5, 1820 with a request for Mark to keep a letter from the late Governor Langdon in “confidence” because he believes its exposure to the public might “rekindle a flame which burnt too long & too fiercely against me…” He detests having been accused of being “Monarchical”, and expresses that he bore these false accusations “with resignation, as one of the duties imposed on me by my post. But I assure you it was among the most painful duties from which I hoped to find relief in retirement. Tranquility is the summum bonum of old age and ill health; and nothing could so much disturb this with me as to awaken angry feelings from the slumber in which I wish them ever to remain” (510-1). This is a powerful explanation for Jefferson’s retirement from politics at the peak of his mental powers: criticism from rivals drove him to withdraw rather than condescending into slander in retaliation.\n\nThere are plenty of nuggets such as this on every page of this collection of 618 documents, and still more in the rest of the Jefferson series. I hope it will reach researchers who might find revelations on Jefferson’s biography and American history.\n\nNonsensical Puffery in Gratitude to the Camera’s Movements\n\nPatrick Keating. The Dynamic Frame: Camera Movement in Classical Hollywood: Film and Culture Series. Paperback: $35.00. 368pp, images. ISBN: 978-0-23119-051-0. New York: Columbia University Press, February 19, 2019.\n\n**\n\nThe cover blurb is a bit unclear as to the central significance of this project, but its “Introduction” does a better job of describing it. It begins by quoting several filmmakers who wrote publicly against moving the camera at all, or in favor of only still-shots for all parts of a film. Then, Patrick Keating explains how actual footage from films from the early decades of filmmaking shows how filmmakers began gradually relying on camera movements without entering the theoretical debate in public forums. They used roller skates and then dolly shots to energize productions. He explains that Mamoulian, Howe, Zanuck and Cukor argued “against dollies and cranes” because these movements appeared to be “careless, deployed for no good reason. The guiding ideal was not efficiency but efficacy.” He summarizes that this book “tells the story of camera movement in classical Hollywood cinema, covering the years from 1924 to 1958. I offer a historical poetics of the technique: a ‘poetics’ because I am concerned with the principles of film construction; ‘historical’ because I explain those principles by situating the technique within the context of the Hollywood studio system” (1-2).\n\nThe debate regarding the frivolousness and trickery of moving the camera engaged my interest; however, this digression into poetics loses my interest. A couple pages later, he gives this explanation of how zoom-in on the face shots are engaging to viewers: “The low-angle camera briskly dollies in from a medium shot to a close-up, and Kansas smiles… What the shot lacks in subtlety it gains in expressive force… The low angle allows her to dominate the frame, and the brisk movement evokes her intelligence by suggesting that the idea has come to her in a flash…” (4). Why does Keating feel compelled to include all this glorifying puffery in this discussion? What does “expressive force” have to do with the science of a close-up. A term like this is too general and fails to explain the point of the maneuver. The same zoom-in trick is still used in nearly every film made across the world, as folks continue mimicking it, as if its use is essential to passing cinema. If a film only has still shots or no close-ups today, it is unlikely it would even break into the film festival circuit. It is possible that mind-tricks such as brisk movements and allowing a face to dominate the frame have helped to build character-worship despite the absence of intelligence in what the characters are actually saying. For example, the discussion might be about the weather rather than the murder-mystery at hand, or she might find an answer to the mystery in her imagination without disclosing her thought-process. Poor writing is covered up with these same repeating tricks. I hoped to find out how these repetitions were started, why they spread, and what is stopping new techniques from developing. This book should include the answers, but they are buried under puffery, or flattering remarks that aggrandize the film industry giants, congratulating them on establishing formulas in Hollywood’s first few decades that might remain with us across the coming millennia. The chapters’ titles prevent an easy exploration of the provided contents, with titles such as “Purposes and Parallels” and “Between Subjective and Objective”. What do you think these titles signify? Subjective is the opposite of objective; either somebody is biased and offers puffery in support of bad cinema, or he is objective and presents the unpoetic facts of the case. There are several tables across the book, but they compare very simple elements that fail to show clear significance. The most detailed table offers the placement of two separate characters, Jo and Jimmy within a series of eight shots, displaying where each of them is placed (left or right); if it is a full, medium, medium long, medium close, or long shot; and that their position is “standing” or “seated” (182). A more standard table shows thirty stages of a single shot in Rope (1948) from the perspective of nine different characters; each is marked as “onscreen” or “partial” with no note if he or she is offscreen. What do you think this extensive information demonstrates? Here is the concluding paragraph for the section “The camera had grown more fluid, but its increasing mobility made familiar rhetoric about the ‘all-seeing eye’ seem ever more problematic. Instead of cutting to the most advantageous angle at every possible moment, filmmakers used the camera to make the cinema’s essential selectivity ever more salient. The camera’s gestures could be forceful, as in Rope, or gentle, as in No Way Out, but they were visibly gestures, producing effects not of omniscience but of revelation, concealment, emphasis, and understatement” (255-62). It is easy to let the sounds of this type of scholarly language wash over you. But let’s stop and ponder this. What does it mean that the “camera” has become “fluid”? We have not seen the invention of a fluid versus a solid camera. So, does this mean that camera work has become more diverse? No, the section is called “The Longest Takes”. By definition, he sets out to describe a single type of camera movement in this section: the long take. The notion of a long take is not fluid: it is a long, continuous camera shot; it pretty much follows the action as characters move around. It remains about the same a century later. Now, what does the “all-seeing-eye” have to do with the long take? Sure, the long take might be inspired by the notion that the film is seen from am “omniscient” narrator, who in a godly manner is able to follow the action in a single long shot. The problem is that the author of this scholarly explanation leaves out what “familiar rhetoric” he is referring to and why omniscience is “problematic”? Is he referring to the Big Brother problem of modern government surveillance? Why would he digress there in a section promising to discuss the simple camera movement of a long shot? Then, he raises a good point: the long shot prevents the cinematographer from selecting the best possible shot across the lengthy section of film this long shot covers. A long shot makes the cinematographer’s job easier, as it forbids him from cutting and pasting sections; this lack of effort is explained as an artistic achievement because all of the actions were captured with a single shot. “Salient” in the context of the rest of the sentence probably means “pointing outward”, or it can mean “prominent”; restating the phrase with an insertion of these possibilities: “cinema’s essential selectivity ever more” pointing outward; “cinema’s essential selectivity ever more” prominent. The latter makes more sense. So, by using the long shot filmmakers are empowering the art of the cinema with greater selectivity. If stated directly, this long sentence clearly contradicts itself. By using a single shot, filmmakers are limiting their power and selectivity, rather than increasing in this regard. No argument is inserted in support of how a single shot is more selective than choosing between thousands of potential shots for a collage of images. Then, Keating digresses again into a discussion of forcefulness and gentleness of camera movements: what does this have to do with the length of a shot? After introducing this binary, the sentence ends thus: “not of omniscience but of revelation, concealment, emphasis, and understatement”. The term “omniscience” refers back to the “all-seeing-eye”. However, there is no parallel or even a binary opposition between it and the terms that follow it after a “but”: “revelation, concealment, emphasis, and understatement”. “Omniscience” means to be all-knowing. Revelation is a synonym for knowing all, as the world is fully revealed. However, “concealment” is its antonym, as it refers to what is unknown. The next two terms are even more confusing: what does a long shot have to do with emphasis? The long shot tends to emphasize the larger action, as it moves between characters, scenery and the like. And “understatement” might be related to the gentle versus aggressive camera movement, but what relationship might exist between them is left out. In other words, this paragraph, when viewed as a sum of its parts is nonsensical.\n\nSerious scholars coming across this book are likely to simply put it back on the shelf because scrutinizing every word in every paragraph to derive the nonsense within a book is an exhaustive effort. Meanwhile, scholars who similarly engage in nonsense-building offer the same type of puffery to this nonsense as this author affords the millionaires of the film industry. I view it as part of my job to criticize all books that lack sense in these reviews. I hope this commentary will stop a professor from including this book in a syllabus: don’t torture your students with digressive dribble.\n\nComprehensive History of Jamaica’s Television Industry\n\nYvette J. Rowe and Livingston A. White. Still on Air: Producing Television in Small Markets. 258pp, images. ISBN: 978-9-766406752. Jamaica: The University of the West Indies Press, 2019.\n\n*****\n\nThe preface does a great job of summarizing this book as: “a detailed analysis of four Jamaican television programmes (Schools’ Challenge Quiz, Profile, Hill an’ Gully Ride and Entertainment Report) by examining the various production elements that have contributed to their success. He book documents their historical, production and broadcast experiences and offers an analysis of the reasons for their longevity. The length of time on air can be an indicator of a show’s success in certain contexts such as small markets for television…” It “documents an aspect of the Jamaican television industry that has never before been given detailed attention. The work provides readers with insights into what is required to produce television programming that is culturally sensitive, affordable and responsive to audiences in small markets” (1). This book achieves exactly what it promises here.\n\nFor example, Appendix 3 gives the exact numbers of viewers that tuned into the four focal programs focal to the book across the years they were on air between 1970 and 2015. A separate appendix shows statistics for the longest-running shows in other countries: curious because it demonstrates their market dominance, longevity and other points discussed in the text. The chapters are logically organized and make it easy for researchers to find content. The first chapter covers the breadth of the history of television programming in Jamaica, setting the stage for readers new to the topic. Four body chapters cover the four shows closely analyzed. Additional chapters cover what makes for a show’s longevity, and glances into the future with hope for continued success for Jamaica’s television. Those interested in the past, or currently working in Jamaica can find the most relevant sections with a quick glance at this table. Since this is one of the only books covering this subject, it should be of great interest to scholars in this emerging field, and to practitioners in need to extensive market and artistic research. The historical introduction explains the significance the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation (JBC) had on founding Jamaica’s television industry. JPC commenced in this business in 1959 with a national public radio station, before creating its first television station in 1963. The first transmission corresponded with Jamaica’s independence celebrations. One of the shows covered began in 1970, shortly after this founding. JPC was a socialist government program until it was divested in 1997 as part of Jamaica’s privatization efforts. Another helpful fact from the introductory materials is that the 2011 census found that Jamaica had 845,000 households with TV sets (12); this explains that the viewing audience averages for these shows in the 100,000-200,000 range in the appendix represent around 10% of the population of 2.8 million, a very high bar when compared with larger countries where even huge shows don’t reach this percentage of the population. Other helpful components from the book are transcripts from the central shows: these should help those who have not seen the productions understand their essence. There are also tables that summarize the genre, creators, language, filming locations and the like. The history is supported with practical information for filmmakers and researchers, such as the funding sources that have gotten and kept these shows on the air. The authors site two funding models: 1. “producers buying airtime from a television station and then getting their own sponsors. These sponsors invariably get advertising in the show either through an actual advertisement shown during a break or in promos, or through product placement or endorsements of the sponsor’s services or products…” 2. “a joint venture between the producer and television station… [T]he marketing department… of the station sells advertising space for the show…” Both of these models feature the producer as a driving financial element in the productions. The writers add that a third model is “emerging in the Jamaican market”, a corporate model similar to the one common in the US: “A corporate entity underwrites a branded show and is the key sponsor with their brand occupying a prominent space…” (71). This means that Jamaica’s television is currently a bull’s market for ambitious producers as they face little competition from corporate entities in accessing viewers. Anybody able to find sponsors, can run a television show. This makes this book relevant for international businesses, rather than only for locals, as there are many opportunities for investment and growth.\n\nThe concluding paragraph stresses that the start of the four covered programs in a socialist government-owned entity and their continuation into the commercial, privately owned media marketplace of today “suggests that there must be a compromise between the business imperative and the public good” (139-40). Overall, this is a thorough study of a subject in need of close scrutiny. Instead of propaganda or puffery, this study offers honest explanations of the struggles the television industry has faced in Jamaica, offering hope for continued development.\n\nWhy a Third of Americans Have Criminal Records\n\nRachel Elise Barkow. Prisoners of Politics: Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration. Cloth: $35.00. 304pp, images. ISBN: 978-0-674-919233-9. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, March 4, 2019.\n\n*****\n\nThe summary from the publisher is excellent: “America has the highest incarceration rate among major nations. One in three American adults has a criminal record. We spend vast sums on not just incarceration, but on protection and law enforcement. Despite this, much evidence suggests these very policies increase the risk of crime, leaving us less safe. This counterproductive consequence is directly due to America having politicized criminal justice rather than treating it as a problem to be solved.” Barkow works to address this shortcoming in this study. This topic is particularly relevant to my own experience at the moment. I lost an election for Mayor of Quanah a week ago. After this loss, a contact on LinkedIn commented that politicians exist to keep Americans safe. I observed at the time that only fear-mongers argue that this is a mayor’s primary job. Instead of spreading fear, a good mayor has to focus more energy on helping those in need avoid the extreme poverty and need that might otherwise lead them into crime. This response was not appreciated. The statistic that one in three Americans have a criminal record really hits this point home more so than I was able to express in my gut-reaction. Why are we fighting wars against countries that are not responsible for staging any major attacks on the US: entities within them might have been responsible, but we have been hitting entire countries, wasting resources and lives. On the local level, policing and the law are in a run-away spending and punishing mode. Too many people being punished are innocent of the acts, but police departments are rewarded with funding for arrests and convictions rather than for measures of their accuracy. With these thoughts in the back of my mind, it is exciting to read a book entirely dedicated to research the topic of mass-incarceration with cool detachment, instead of utilizing it in political rhetoric to win an election. Several residents of Quanah mentioned knowing people who were rape victims in Quanah who had been ignored by the local police department: they were asking me to promise to pursue cases against the accused without looking at the case files and before they would vote for me in the election. Why would deciding on the merits of the case be an issue for the Mayor to decide rather than a logical detective on the case that pursues or refrains from pursuing charges based on the merits of the case? All Americans should be asking these questions, and should benefit from this study being seen by those in charge.\n\nThe author is highly believable as she is the Segal Family Professor of Regulatory Law and Policy and the Faculty Director of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University. She presented some of these ideas previously as a member of the United States Sentencing Commission since 2013. Some of her suggestions have led to the roll back of federal drug sentencing, but clearly most of her ideas have been ignored or she would not have written this lengthy book to explain the problems with the current politicized system.\n\nThe chapter titles are a bit vague, but their contents are explained in brief summaries at the start of each of the three parts of the book. Chapter 1 addresses how crimes are lumped together so that minor offenders can receive similar sentences to those on the other extreme. Chapter 2 describes how harsh sentences can undermine instead of assuring public safety because longer sentences make re-offending upon re-entry more likely, among other problems. Chapter 3 stresses that American prisons fail to rehabilitate offenders. I worked as a substitute teacher in LA county juvenile detention facilities, so I can testify to this point. On the last day on this job, a gang of fifteen 16-18-year-olds exposed themselves and threatened to rape me repeatedly across the 9-hour day. I kept trying to teach the assigned lessons, but they kept rushing around the room, repeating violent threats, and otherwise creating an extremely hostile atmosphere. They repeated that the cameras in the room were down. I asked for a guard to come in and defend me several times, but the officers would come in, laugh at the situation, encourage the boys and then would leave me alone with them again. I filed official complaints on this matter at the end of the day. In response the district put me on suspension instead of punishing any of these offenses. My suspension from substituting for LA county was lifted on the day I left LA for PA to begin my PhD studies at IUP. I received a letter that I was cleared of the accusation against me. I taught in several other detention centers, and was harassed and threatened in all of them. Substituting in public schools was also highly threatening: with kids telling me that people they knew were murdered by gang members and the like. But the incarceration facilities took the threat-level to a new height. All of the juveniles were surprised I was actually trying to teach them: they probably face these types of intimidating circumstances daily. The system is obligated to teach juveniles because education is mandatory up through high school in the US. If this is how education is handled when detention centers are required to partake, clearly voluntary education in adult facilities is in a much greater trouble. Well, I have digressed: this book clearly inspires contemplation. I won’t detail the contents of the other chapters as it is obvious that all of them address central challenges relevant to this debate.\n\nThe research across the book is spotless. It answers questions readers never imagined existed. For example, she explains that laws that set out to punish sex offenders with 25-year minimums are applied to various categories of people that have to register as sex offenders because they visit a prostitute, urinate in public or streak. All of the juveniles that flashed me might have spent the rest of their lives in jail if this extreme law was enforced. Actually, this exact question is addressed later in the paragraph: “Sex is not required for a teenager to end up on a registry. A high school senior in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who flashed a group of freshman girls on his way to the bathroom pleaded guilty to indecent exposure and had to register under Oklahoma law as a sex offender.” Apparently even a “9-year-old who played ‘doctor’ with a 6-year-old had to register…” (21).\n\nBasically, this book has located most of the absurdities of America’s criminal justice system and digested them in a language acceptable to the general public as well as to researchers and policy makers. Just as the Muller Report, this book cannot have been read by anybody running America’s government, or they would have been clamoring to make these changes. I hope Barkow succeeds in breaking this message through. Based on her statistics, half of Americans have encountered unfairness of law enforcement, as many were put on trial or faced probation without a conviction leading to a criminal record. If all of these people were presented with a short one-page summary of the findings of this book and were asked to vote on keeping the current system or adopting these suggested changes, they would surely vote for the changes (but most probably couldn’t vote because of laws barring voting by convicts). Barkow must have helped write many decisions when she clerked for judges as this shows outstanding legal research and writing. The book is also a great read for anybody who needs to understands the subject to make legal or political arguments on this matter.\n\nHow Fakery Rules American Political PR\n\nJudith S. Trent, Robert V. Friedenberg, and Robert E. Denton, Jr. Political Campaign Communication: Principles & Practice, Upgraded Eighth Edition. 22pp. ISBN: 978-1-5381-1005-8. New York: Rowman & Littlefield, 2019.\n\n**\n\nI requested this and the other books in this review to prepare for my mayoral campaign. Sadly, I learned little from all of these volumes that I did not know before. Maybe I know a great deal about campaigns or marketing already, or maybe all of these books repeat the same information. A few of these were new editions of an old book on this topic, and the publishers sent the entire new edition for the others. But for this title, Rowman sent only a short 22-page section that was added to this latest edition, without the rest of it. Obviously, this was the least helpful out of this set. I think it made a negative contribution. Here is how the back cover advertises it: “The 2016 presidential campaign was like none other in contemporary history…” Perhaps, I’ve written too many book reviews at this point, but this is the most absurd line of puffery I have read. The next lines I would expect from a serious work of scholarship would be: “It was the most corrupt election in American history, where lobbyists who bought the Democrats faced off against the Russians who bought the Republicans. The Republicans successfully rigged the election, while accusing the Democrats of rigging. During this process, the President paid off a porn star and otherwise committed hundreds of illegal acts, for which several people are already serving prison time. The President will not be charged for any of these crimes because the Republicans are completely corrupted and would not be able to stand up to the people who have corrupted them even if these lunatics start shooting people outside of Trump Tower. While Nixon was pretty crooked, this latest election has made American politics more blatantly corrupt than any other nation in the world because to win this title the crooks have to get away with it.” But that’s not what the cover states. It continues: “…The historical nature of the race in terms of gender, new communication technology and social media, the deep political divide in America, and even the personalities of the candidates provided the environment for a very unique and untraditional campaign.” The new technologies they might be referring to are the bots that flooded social media to create distrust and misinformation that confused American voters. The “divide”… is far more troubling. US elections have been rigged since 1996. Lobbyists have been paying billions to American politicians to pass laws that favor their interests. Early polling and media sway have been used to give the illusion of division. The final results are always close. The point of these close calls is to encourage both Republicans and Democrats to over-commit on their promises and to over-spend on corrupting the elections under the belief that they have a chance to win. In 1996 and in most elections prior to this point, the winner was a clear winner. Clinton won with 379 to 159 electoral votes. Looking at Dole’s versus Clinton’s records, Americans knew who the better candidate was, or perhaps rigging was more clear-cut. But here are the numbers for the elections that followed: 2000: 271: 266/ 50.5: 51 (Bush); 2004: 286: 251/ 62: 59 (Bush); 2008: 365: 173/ 69.5: 60 (Obama); 2012: 332: 206/ 65.4: 60.6 (Obama), 2016: 304: 227/ 63: 65.8 (Trump). No other party received a single electoral vote across these years. Democrats won the popular election in 2000 and 2016, but lost because of direct gerrymandering that skewed the Electoral College into their favor. With these two taken out, Republicans only won one election across these years, Bush’s reelection after the 9/11 attack. Despite clearly not being supported by the majority of American people, Republicans dominated the House and the Senate across much of Obama’s term, seemingly preventing him from actually instituting any significant positive change to match his promises. Instead of coming up with a platform that matches the American people, the Republicans are relying on rigging and corruption, and even if they pay off porn stars in public, they are not being stopped. The Democrats are complicit in this fiasco, or they would have overturned these problems after the 2000 Electoral College disaster. The commencement of legalized torture at this juncture in Guantanamo probably contributed to terrifying Democrats into towing the Republicans’ party line. Instead of saying any of this, the cover includes this point: “fake news: how the media covered the campaign, issues arising from the influence of ‘fake news’ in the coverage, and potential lasting effects on journalistic practice.” Now this book can be declared campaign propaganda for the Republicans. Most of this section is consumed with quotes of outrage, seemingly from the left concerned about the problems, but without commentary in support of either side. A few helpful points appear in one paragraph: “As typical in recent presidential contests, the horse race between the candidates dominated the coverage, consisting of 42 percent followed by scandals and controversies with 17 percent and only 10 percent focusing on policy issues. According to the Tyndall Report, the three major evening news networks devoted just thirty-two minutes to issue coverage in the 2016 general election.” That’s 32 minutes in total across the three of them. Terrorism and foreign policy were the most commonly discussed issue. “In previous presidential elections, coverage surpassed two hundred minutes. However, during the primary season, the networks spent 333 minutes focusing on Donald Trump. Clinton’s emails garnered one hundred minutes of coverage from the networks… Overall, both candidates received highly negative coverage, with 66 percent for Clinton and a record-high 77 percent for Trump” (13). This explains the current election cycle. The top democratic runner began the campaign by pretty much leaking stories about sexually harassing the women he has worked with. Instead of losing because of these invasions of private space, he pushed to the top of the polls, and is probably going to win the nomination. This and other books on election marketing are indicating that to win an election in the US, a runner has to prove they are the most corrupt, foul, idiotic person on the field. Either elections are so cooked, the media coverage is only a “fake” distraction to the cookery, or with half of Americans having criminal records or having dealt with the criminal justice system, perhaps a majority of Americans are in support of corrupt criminals. This is the only piece of “helpful” information in this propagandistic run-around. I hope nobody will buy this book, and instead I hope American politicians and their marketing teams will dig deep inside their fake-Bibles to find some morals.\n\nHow Two Candidates Created Identical Platforms\n\nSean D. Foreman and Marcia L. Godwin. Local Politics and Mayoral Elections in 21st Century America: The Keys to City Hall. 244pp, images. ISBN: 978-0-415-34736-5. New York: Routledge: Taylor & Francis Group, 2019.\n\n**\n\nThis book also failed to provide clear, practical advice on how to win an American election with morals intact. Here is the summary from the publisher: “Open contests in New York, Los Angeles, and Boston… offer laboratories to examine electoral trends in urban politics… Boston was rocked by the bombing of the marathon… Detroit is roiled by being the largest U.S. city to declare bankruptcy, and Chicago, which had an open, competitive election in 2011, is dealing with significant gun violence. San Diego’s mayor resigned… due to sexual harassment charges, and other mayors are surrounded by corruption scandals.” Wow! American cities are burning to the ground. What can this book have to say about this? It continues: “Emerging theories of urban governance, demographic changes, and economic conditions are examined in introductory chapters; the introduction provides a unique and comprehensive focus on major trends in advertisement, changes in campaign strategies, fundraising, and the use of social media at the local level. In Part 2, scholars with expertise in local politics, urban public policy, and governance explore some of the largest and most noteworthy U.S. cities, each of which had a recent, competitive mayoral election…” “Gerrymandering” does not appear in the “Index” for this book despite the promise to cover “demographic changes”. Yes, despite the increase of minorities through in-migration and the like across the last two decades, the party which opposes immigration and minorities has come into power? How? By changing electoral maps to favor them even as the majority of Americans are blatantly on the other side. The other point that draws attention here is “economic conditions”, which seems to be referring back to Detroit, so I turned to this chapter. The structure of this chapter is logical enough. It opens by summarizes the demographics and backgrounds of the two opposing candidates in the election: Michael E. Duggan (white) and Benny Napoleon (black). Then, a brief introduction explains that Duggan is the “first serious white candidate in 40 years” in Detroit, amidst the bankruptcy breakdown. Then, the charter or the structure of Detroit’s government is summarized. Then, a section stresses that Detroit had been Democrat “since the New Deal”. A demographics section summarizes color and economic lines. Then biographies of the candidates. Then the campaign issues: bankruptcy, the emergency manager, and crime. Followed by the “Campaign Strategy”: this section is the reason I requested this book. Instead of setting out to explain the exact strategy that brought a win, it begins by explaining the two sides almost plagiarized the others talking-points: they had an “indiscernibility between their positions on” the major issues; “both opposed the emergency manager and the bankruptcy” (124). Then, the writers repeat the obvious: both used “the Internet, television ads, and newspaper interviews.” Then, they touch on how they both “used video advertisements emphasizing their solidarity with residents, highlights of their revitalization plans, and focusing on their perspective backgrounds” (124-5). It seems as if both candidates paid the same PR firm to run their campaign, and this PR firm replicated the same campaign for both of them. Perhaps the bankruptcy drained the swamp and left both with so little for the election, the PR firm just decided to do half-a-job for half-the-pay.\n\nMore importantly for those looking for practical advice in these pages: none of this is as-promised practically helpful. A candidate with enough money to pay a PR firm would not need to read this book. A practicing PR firm would need to know how to psychologically and visually make appealing videos and websites rather than that these are supposed to be made. So, who is this book aimed at? The target audience appears to be introductory, undergraduate politics classes. But what teacher would torture students by having them memorize the biographies and finances of these horrid little elections?

Cambridge: Harvard University Press, February 25, 2019.\n\n*****\n\nThe book’s blurb does an excellent job describing why this title is of interest to librarians and general readers as it accuses the US of depopulating the region around the Panama Canal in order to benefit its own businesses while wiping out local infrastructure, culture and population. “Between 1911 and 1916, the United States expelled approximately 40,000 Panamanians from the Canal Zone. In 1912, when the project began, Panama City had a population of about 24,000 and held 14% of the country’s entire population. The creation of the Panama Cana Zone erased an old commercial route dotted with towns and roads that had connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans since the sixteenth century. Entire Panamanian towns located in the ten miles of American territory bordering the area were dismantled and torched. These cities and towns were centuries old, vibrant, economically modern, and entwined with Panamanian politics, history, and culture. Within a few years after the decree, the depopulated areas became a jungle. In lieu of the existing pattern of settlement, the US federal government created an idyllic tropical space, in which the jungle served as a backdrop to manicured suburban towns miraculously cleansed of poverty, unemployment, and even most forms of private property.” The last note is particularly interesting. American corruption favors a few contractors who might gain near-exclusive rights to develop an entire city. Others are prevented from building with restrictive zoning codes and other measures. It seems that the Panama story is a bit more intricate if it involved the elimination of private property all together. This is definitely an intriguing, new argument that deserves to be fully explored. The author, Marixa Lasso, currently teaches at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, in the neighboring country with Panama, a Florida-length away (though Google Maps is not allowing me to calculate driving distance, though there seem to be connecting highways between the university and the Panama Canal). Lasso previously taught in the US at Case Western Reserve University and won NHC and other grants. Thus, she appears to be free of bias towards either of these regions.\n\nThe book is organized chronologically, and separated into periods: the port that existed before the build, the creation of the Canal Zone, the decimation of the surrounding towns, what the region became without Panamanians, how the towns turned into the jungle, and what the region looks like today. A few historical photographs demonstrate the arguments, including a family picnic in a jungle that used to be a fort, the view of Balboa administration building, and early photographs and paintings of what this region was like when it was dominated by Panamanians. The towns that were not burned to the ground suffered through floods and other disasters because the Canal construction project created blockages on ancient rivers and otherwise distorted nature in the region (208). There are many surprising details across the book. At one point, Lasso explains that the Zone’s government-built houses for the relocated locals that were too “far from the water” and “were too hot because the ceilings were too low.” The locals complained, explaining the local climate necessitated taller roofs, but they were ignored; these types of discomforts eventually forced most of these people away from the region, leaving only American newcomers running the project in polished cities without a native presence in the outskirts. The descriptions throughout are beautifully written and poetic, but also convey practical and relevant information. They do not veer into nonsensical digressions about trees and spirituality for their own sake. This book has been closely researched and thoroughly edited to welcome and keep readers. It is a great find for any library with a Latin American collection. Researchers of Latin and Central America should find this a thorough and unique perspective to inspire further exploration or to fit into the gaps in earlier studies. This might also be a helpful book in a graduate politics or history class.\n\nThree Millennia of Legal History Asks: Why Are We Still Doing That?\n\nTamar Herzog. A Short History of European Law: The Last Two and a Half Millennia. 290pp. ISBN: 978-0-674-23786-5. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2019.\n\n*****\n\nWhile Barkow does a great job summarizing the problems with current American law rules, these can better be understood when seen from the wider perspective of this history of European law across a 2,500-year history. We can imagine the existing laws are the only and the best possible laws, but are they remnants of medieval or early-history codes that nobody had the energy to overrule in all these millennia? Why do we have laws against using illegal substances, but not against accepting bribes from lobbyists. Modern politicians and fiction and non-fiction writers like me should find much to inspire our work here. The author, Tamar Herzog teaches history at Harvard University, in affiliation with its Law School. The parts are very logically divided into ancient times, early Middle Ages, late Middle Ages, early modern period, modernity, and the nineteenth century. The chapter titles point to themes that separate these periods: Roman Law, Latin Christendom, jurists, laws related to lords, emperors and popes, English common law, natural law, American and French revolutions, and codification of European law. In the “Introduction”, Herzog explains that one of the inspirations to write this book was when one of her students approached her with clueless excitement over the Magna Carta, causing Herzog to question if she should go off on a lecture regarding how history has manipulated and misunderstood this document, or if she should let the student maintain her thrill at the encounter with this mythological archival piece (1). She decided to explain what we all fail to understand about the history of the law by writing this book.\n\nThe book is written is a more conversational style than most law or history books. This should make it easy for a student to read a portion of it closely, important in undergraduate and graduate history classes where very boring and laborious books too often slip into syllabi. The pages are full of curious and surprising revelations. For example, she points out that law courts were originally “optional and required consent of plaintiffs and defendants” before they gradually became mandatory, and their judgements became law rather than suggestions for resolutions to avoid violence (14-5). Those who research modern law policy might find inspiration from this realization, causing them to question why do we have courts, and might this type of lawlessness actually decrease crime as the threat of legal retribution from the victim’s side might be more of a deterrent?\n\nSome portions are a bit too lightly described for my taste. For example, one section, “Questioning Feudalism” mentions that since the 1990s historians have questioned if this concept existed as we imagine it: “a model that rarely (if ever was put into place. Or they maintained that the large variety of situations and practices they uncovered in the archives could never be reduced to a system with clear principles” (66-7). Few of these questioning studies are clearly cited, and what specific archival evidence proves about these systems is left out. The section ends by moving off into “monarchies and states”. This certainly inspires a desire to research this matter further, but if I was studying this book as homework, I would lack a nugget of truth to take away from it. On the other hand, it’s great to see uncertainty in a history book. My own current research into de-attribution of works away from Daniel Defoe proves that what we imagine is “history” is more like fiction that has been repeated often enough to be believed. If there are no answers regarding if there was ever such a thing as feudalism, it’s great that Herzog forgoes the sway of myth and relies on the confusion suggested by facts.\n\nThe section called “The Foundational Documents” briskly summarizes the contents of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, and explains what these mean in greater legal context (168). Another section explains how the ratification of a civil code procedure in New York led to its adoption in Missouri and dozens of other states. This explains why states have such similar criminal and civil codes to each other. In theory, states can create radically different legal codes, but while there are political divergences on abortion, the death penalty and the like, the civil code is oddly duplicable (226). About half of the book is about relatively modern legal developments many of us have probably read about in high school history classes, and the other half of the book presents information that is entirely foreign, starting with the first written texts. As I imagined, the author states in the end that she hopes to inspire innovation in the law based on these lessons from history. She argues there is a need to “come up with a new paradigm that would replace the old imaginary of a society made of undifferentiated equal citizens linked by an abstract social contract… The new paradigm, instead, would recognize the power of groups and group solidarity as well as the persistence of inequalities and differences by unmaking the metaphors proposed by the French Revolution…” She calls on jurists to propose “methods to imagine a new legal universe for a new society” (243). If it is relatively easy to compress thousands of years of Earth’s legal history into a pretty thin book, humans really have been lacking in imagining innovations in this area. Then again, it is difficult to agree on a change out of fear it might make things worse: for example, separating people into groups and judging them differently does not sound like it would be moral from my perspective.\n\nI hope those who have the power to change the legal system will read this book and will ponder on the possibilities.\n\nDe-Regulation Propaganda in Favor of Innovative Crookery\n\nMerritt B. Fox, Lawrence R. Glosten & Gabriel V. Rauterberg. The New Stock Market: Law, Economics, and Policy. Economics: Law: Business. $65.00. 408pp. Cloth: ISBN: 978-0-231-18196-9. New York: Columbia University Press, January 8, 2019.\n\n**\n\nThe blurb does an excellent job of summarizing this technical book, so here it is in full: “The U.S. stock market has been transformed over the last twenty-five years. Once a market in which human beings traded at human speeds, it is now an electronic market pervaded by algorithmic trading, conducted at speeds nearing that of light. High-frequency traders participate in a large portion of all transactions, and a significant minority of all trade occurs on alternative trading systems known as ‘dark pools.’ These developments have been widely criticized, but there is no consensus on the best regulatory response to these dramatic changes./ The New Stock Market offers a comprehensive new look at how these markets work, how they fail, and how they should be regulated. Merritt B. Fox, Lawrence R. Glosten, and Gabriel V. Rauterberg describe stock markets’ institutions and regulatory architecture. They draw on the informational paradigm of microstructure economics to highlight the crucial role of information asymmetries and adverse selection in explaining market behavior, while examining a wide variety of developments in market practices and participants. The result is a compelling account of the stock market’s regulatory framework, fundamental institutions, and economic dynamics, combined with an assessment of its various controversies. The New Stock Market covers a wide range of issues including the practices of high-frequency traders, insider trading, manipulation, short selling, broker-dealer practices, and trading venue fees and rebates. The book illuminates both the existing regulatory structure of our equity trading markets and how we can improve it.” The authors are a Columbia law professor (Merritt B. Fox), a Columbia business professor (Lawrence R. Glosten), and a University of Michigan law professor (Gabriel V. Rauterberg). Given the herculean effort undertaken of understanding innovations in the stock market, clearly three Ivy League professors were needed to tackle this research-mountain. The notes, index and other back matter take up a fourth of the book or over a hundred pages, so it is painstakingly researched.\n\nI requested this book because for the first time in my life, I am sort of starting to save a bit of money. I invested it in a high-interest savings account, and I’ve now seen an actual interest earnings of more than $1. So, this inspired me to research market investment to figure out if I should attempt it in the coming decades, or if I should remain away from risk-taking. I was supposed to become a financial analyst if things had worked out as-planned after college; I worked in this field for a bit, but the job I was hired for was incredibly boring, so I transitioned into researching literature, while using my economics and business knowledge to run my publishing company. One of the problems I encountered with business was the shady trading and financial maneuvers I was exposed to during my college banking internships. The job seemed to be fooling regulators, and if I was unwilling to engage in this, managers kind of pressured me out of the loop and the job. Now, here is a book with chapters on “Manipulation” and “Short Selling”… and the “Dark Pools”. Are these suggesting that to profit in this erratic market, I have to engage in market-manipulation, but in a manner that stays within regulatory guidelines? The section on “High Frequency Trading” or rapid trades carried out with help from computer programs might be more relevant to my attempts to be moral, but surely these programs are expensive or inaccessible to those with limited funds. The opening of this latter chapter xplains that “high-frequency traders (HFTs) post a significant number of the limit orders that ar ched in his fashion and result in executed trades.” As I anticipated the computer uses “algorithms” to calculate the best matches for this rapid-fire trades (95). What would be helpful here is if the writers explained the elements reviewed by these algorithms, so I could develop a mini-one to attempt playing the market myself. Instead the section is pretty digressive as it keeps defining the terms, and then gives an example with a lot of facts but little practical use. In this example, an investor “decides that Agilent’s future cash flows are going to be greater than its current share price suggests.” Then it goes into what the shares are and what they might be, and how one might make a profit if the guess is correct. The missing nugget is in why this investor has decided the price will go up. Is he privy to insider-trading information? If he part of the “dark pools” that will be discussed later in the book? Is he using an algorithm to make this prediction? If the latter, that’s what I want to know: what’s the equation to make this prediction? Looking over other sections, this is a consistent problem throughout: a lack of clear, practical advice for those set on keeping trading legal. The problem is that the authors are propagandizing on the need for further de-regulation rather than setting out to guide new investors. A sub-section called “Appearance of Unfairness” demonstrates this: “Although our previous analysis suggests that anticipatory order cancelation does not actually result in unfairness, HFT practices of this sort are clearly viewed by a substantial portion of the public as being unfair… Normally, the better response to misunderstanding is education, not a change in what people are allowed to do where the activity does not in fact pose a problem…” (122-3). They have dedicated much of their analysis to proving a lack of unfairness? They are trying to convince the public it’s wrong to feel as if they have been wronged by Wall Street? And their answer is to re-educate the public with propaganda to believe that they are not being ripped off by Wall Street? If the activity is not “in fact” causing a problem, why aren’t these authors restating what the problem that doesn’t exist is? The authors are hiding behind big terms to avoid being found out as propagandists for Wall Street, and anti-humanists. I’m the one for whom this system is unfair: a handful of traders are rigging the game, while the rest of us might invest just at the moment before the market crashes in another Great Recession or Depression.\n\nThus, while I had great hopes that I would be equipped to make a million in the coming year by learning what all the rich people in the market know… In truth, I’ve only learned that Wall Street is bullishly insistent on deregulating themselves into complete lawlessness, even if the rest of the US goes unfairly bankrupt.\n\nA Scholar’s Fight to Prevent Progress: Feelings and Beliefs Blocking De-Attribution from the “Defoe” Canon\n\nMaximillian E. Novak. Daniel Defoe: Master of Fictions: His Life and Works. £16.99. 756pp. ISBN: 978-0-199261543. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011 (2001).\n\n*\n\nI made a special request for this book because a reviewer of one of my Defoe de-attribution essays specified that I had to consult this work if I was going to comment on Defoe’s biography. This is a “definitive” text on Defoe and the latest re-examination of his life. It was published before the 2010 essays came out linguistically questioning Defoe’s authorship of the novels he is famous for. I am particularly curious regarding what it has to say on two points: attribution and Robert Harley. First, I would like to know if there is a mention that these novels do not belong to Defoe and how this might impact the biographical narrative. Much of Defoe’s “biography” is fictional if, as I have determined with certainty, he did not write these novels. For example, biographers have built the place of his birth and family heritage around what he is proposed to have written about the Foes, but he did not write the travel narrative that makes this reference. A review from the Guardian from 2001 points out that researchers were already buzzing about the attributions back then before more formal linguistic declarations: “Defoe’s talents of impersonation and habits of secrecy have left academics to argue over what he did actually write. He was probably responsible for more pages of print than any other major writer, yet much is irrecoverable. Novak is often oddly confident about his ability to detect Defoe’s hand where other scholars have taught caution…” This confidence is problematic because belief without proof does not belong in serious academic discourse. Like Novak, most biographers and past attribution scholars have relied on their feelings about style rather than on the numbers. I work to change this with my own study (7 essays on related subjects), which has been unsurprisingly difficult to place in journals, as it contradicts Novak and thousands of other scholars across hundreds of years of “scholarship.”\n\nThe second item I am curious regarding is what other affiliations existed between Defoe and Harley. My research uncovered that Defoe did not write the Dissenters, a book for which he served prison time. Harley invested in eventually freeing him. Harley acted similarly with at least two other writers, and in all cases, he paid heavy bribes to them immediately after and later in life (upon their repeated demands) in exchange for them serving prison time or going to court on sedition charges. Harley became Britain’s first semi-prime minister due to the political machinations resulting from these non-conformist, radical, or otherwise outrageous books.\n\nHere is a mention: “Defoe’s future patron, Harley, was to receive an education in a Dissenting Academy, but he came out an Anglican and a defender of the social fabric… Defoe “believed in the idea of an open society in which the most talented men ought to rise to the top.” This is an example of fictionalized biography. How does the author, Novak, know what Defoe “believed”. This is made to sound as if we have climbed into Defoe’s mind, but without a quote or a hearsay quote to support this proposed belief, it is imaginative rather than factual. “If his education at Newington Green was the best he could have experienced for the improvement of his mind, it may have hardened some of his attitudes against the education given to those studying for orders in the Church of England at Cambridge and Oxford and drawn him closer to some of the more radical social and political ideals of the Dissenters. When Swift mocked Defoe’s ignorance, (p.46) he invited the derision of those belonging to a relatively select club toward those outside the group. Although Defoe knew he was an outsider, he never could quite understand why his obvious abilities did not gain for him membership in the club” (Chapter 2). There is little here about Harley, but this helps to explain how biographers have perpetrated fictitious narratives for hundreds of years. And this is an example of one of the best biographies out there. There is a specific reference to mockery from Swift, but then the author projects feelings of outsideness onto Defoe without concrete evidence. The author might be projecting his own antipathy towards outsiders or insiders onto the struggle between these two authors. Novak’s biography on his UCLA page is brief: strange for a biographer. He completed a PhD from Oxford back in 1961 after oddly completed a second PhD from UCLA in 1958: usually only one PhD is required. He is now professor emeritus at UCLA and no other institutions are listed, so it seems he has been teaching there across the decades. When this biography was released in 2001, it was his first book publication in a couple of decades. Given his Oxford status, the reference to Defoe’s jealousy of Oxford scholars is autobiographical and self-referential for Novak. This is a bit personal for me, as some of the comments I have received on my de-attribution essays suggest the reviewers are not reading the essays, and might be rejecting them because my own PhD is from IUP and I am not affiliated with any major research university. But I digress.\n\nNovak addresses the question of attribution in the “Introduction.” I am learned several new points from these paragraphs, but Novak’s attitude regarding this information is troubling. Novak lists around six mis-attributions of works proven to be by other writers made by critics from 1753 through 1869. Instead of being startled by these daunting repetitions of mis-attribution, Novak concludes thus: “Such errors must be maddening to librarians and cataloguers, but these scholars added hundreds of genuine works to the Defoe canon and enabled us to see him as one of the great writers of his period. Many of their judgements rested on probability rather than hard evidence, but they based their decisions about the canon on a vast amount of reading in contemporary pamphlets and newspapers. Sometimes they had little to go on beyond a knowledge of Defoe’s interests and what they thought to be an ability to recognize his style. Those of us who have continued to write on Defoe owe them an enormous debt and should forgive them their errors. All of us know that there is no very good external evidence for Defoe’s authorship of works such as Captain Singleton or even Roxana, perhaps the work that most interests modern readers and critics, but no one who has read extensively in Defoe’s writings could doubt his authorship of such books for a moment. If much of the Defoe canon rests upon probability rather than certainty, we should acknowledge that, and demonstrate by the connections we can make between such works and those works that are more definitely his how strong the probability of his authorship might actually be.” As this same paragraph confirms, there is no proof Defoe wrote nearly all of the 550+ attributions that have been made to him. Thus, the scholars who have “added hundreds” of works to the canon have mostly added works that don’t belong there. Why would the act of erroneous attribution be of benefit to anybody but the publishers who profit from attributing works to a famous author? Such attributions have also made these scholars careers as they have gained tenure for these “findings”. But scholarship that spreads falsities is a disservice. “Vast” reading apparently failed to educate these scholars away from false attributions. It is possible to “read” or say you read a great deal without understanding any of it. The point regarding Defoe’s “interests” and assuming they can “recognize” Defoe’s “style” is exactly the error I mentioned earlier. A biographer becomes a fiction writer when he or she guesses what Defoe was thinking: without documented proof, Defoe’s thoughts are unknowable. “Style” can be tested today with the computational linguistic methods I describe; nobody should be intuiting stylistic distinctions: they can be gleaned from calculating the size of average words, sentences and the like. I use “probability” to prove the true authors of these works; so critics that have added false attributions were definitely not using accurate “probability” to reach their guesses. This sentence is jaw-dropping: “Those of us who have continued to write on Defoe owe them an enormous debt and should forgive them their errors.” What? We should forgive errors because we are still repeating the same errors unapologetically? No, we should not forgive errors; the point of continuing scholarship and “new” biographies is to correct past errors with new findings. He stresses that “all” agree there is absolutely “no” evidence of Defoe’s authorship of two of his best-known novels; then adds a “but” and insists that “no one” among scholars in this narrow field “could doubt his authorship”. Scholars cannot “doubt” Defoe’s authorship because scholarship, like my own, which presents proof for de-attribution is rejected from publication. Scholars are forbidden from doubting the Defoe attributions by periodicals and publishers who have been repeating the falsities for three hundred years. The facts are absolutely in agreement: Defoe did not write the novels in question. This situation is a scholarly disaster, and Novak’s defense of this misbehavior adds wood to the fire. He concludes by stating that showing similarity between some of “Defoe’s” novels and others proves his authorship of all of them. As I learned, Defoe did not write any of the novels he is famous for. They were written by Robert Paltock. They are similar to Paltock’s Peter Wilkins. Proving that Roxana is similar to Robinson Crusoe only proves a shared authorship, and their shared author is Paltock, not Defoe.\n\nIn the following paragraph, Novak comments that Furbank and Owens challenged Defoe’s authorship in 250 works. Furbank and Owens actually published some pieces against their own de-attribution attempts in the following decade, so they are hardly the best defenders of de-attribution. But, Novak posted a rebuttal against their de-attributions in the Huntington Library Quarterly. Curiously this is one of two publications that confirmed the accuracy of my findings, but when I attempted to submit one of the essays for their review and asked if I could quote their agreement, they stopped all communication. Novak accuses Furbank and Owens of bias without any supporting evidence or reasoning. A shocking point here is that Novak utilizes Defoe’s letter to Harley to prove their bias: “This latter opinion runs contrary to the evidence in his letters, particularly his letter to the Secretary of State in 1718, as well as his own statements when confronted with such contradictions.” Harley was the Secretary of State, but on an earlier date, when Defoe is likely to have served the prison sentence for Harley’s dissenting book. Defoe was also a professional satirist: what he said about himself and others was frequently the opposite of the truth, falsehoods made with intentional comedic effect. To be fair, Novak confirms that Furbank and Owen discredit their own findings or the “notion that Defoe’s syntax, style, vocabulary, and use of proverbs and popular phrases was unique”. This has been a problem for de-attribution scholars since Furbank and Owens: they already made this argument and proved it and themselves wrong, so periodicals don’t feel the urgent need to repeat the attempt. Novak concludes this point by stating that the Eighteenth-Century Short Title Catalogue disproves their argument because it includes “publishers’ lists, and new ways of distinguishing Defoe’s vocabulary and style from those of his contemporaries through computer analysis.” I followed this source to the British Library. I found a catalog entry for Defoe’s The True-Born Englishman. No “computer analysis” is offered here of this or any other works. There is a short note on the year of publication, but the publisher information is not even really included. The real reason it is possible to de-attribute (rather than attribute) works away from Defoe today is because access to digitized versions of these books make it possible for home-researchers to overrule the few “preeminent” scholars with access to archives that house these 18th century sources. Thus, the reference to this ordinary catalog is nonsensical; WorldCat and other catalogs have more extensive and detailed records.\n\nNovak sticks-to-his-guns, stating this in the opening of the next paragraph: “Andrew Kippis… was able to draw upon a nearly contemporary account of Defoe to comment on how quickly he wrote his pamphlets and books. There is actually nothing extraordinary about the numbers of works ascribed to him. He had the ability to write quickly…” The key term is “nearly contemporary”. In other words, a person without personal knowledge of Defoe said that he writes quickly after Defoe was dead, and Novak believes this is sufficient to conclude that Defoe did indeed write quickly. There have been several stories recently about Danielle Steel having completed 179 books across her life. The record holder for most books “written” is Corin Tellado, a Spanish romance novelist; if he wrote 4,000 books with an average romance length of 50,000 words, then he would have written 200,000,000 words across his 60 years life; subtracting his first 15 years, he had 45 active years. He had to write 12,176 words every single day of these 45 years to meet this word-count, or 869 words per hour in a 14-hour (no weekend) day. 550 books have been attributed to Defoe. One of the only other authors on the most-works-published list from before the age of the modern typewriter is Lope de Vega and this count includes 3,000 individual sonnets as “works”; these would break into only 30 works if they were organized into collections of poetry. Some of the other authors on the list have also had works attributed to them after their deaths, similarly ballooning the numbers. Defoe does not make the list, while some authors have as few as 140 texts, perhaps because of this de-attribution discussion. The use of ghostwriters in the romance novel sphere is notorious; for example, Nora Roberts recently filed a new lawsuit against a romance novelist who utilized a ghostwriting service, which took chunks of Roberts’ novel and replicated it near-exactly. Anybody who attempts writing two romance novels at their top writing speed might discover that repeating a similar formula in two consecutive works is unpleasant. Writing the same type of Cinderella story 14-hours per day every day even after making millions is unlikely. It is more likely that ghostwriters crank these out to the enrichment of the publisher and the author. Ghostwriters or anonymously contracted writers crafted nearly all of the 550 “Defoe” texts in question. Yes, they wrote them quickly. Defoe had several newspapers, and he might have been a quick writer. However, he had a stroke a few years before the publication of the first novels in question, Crusoe, and he was not fully recovered from it. He wrote little in this period because of this illness. Ignoring the facts of his condition in favor of some "
