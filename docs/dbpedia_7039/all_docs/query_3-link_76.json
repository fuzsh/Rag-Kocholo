        "text": "The Allied invasion of mainland Italy\n\nIn September 1943 the British Eighth Army under General Bernard Montgomery invaded the Italian mainland from Sicily, landing at Reggio and Taranto in the extreme south of the country. Meanwhile, the US Fifth Army under General Mark Clark attacked further north at Salerno. The extension of the Mediterranean campaign onto the Italian mainland was intended to pin down German forces that might otherwise be deployed to the Russian front, or be sent to France to counter the cross-Channel invasion planned for the following year.\n\nThe British were more in favour of this strategy than the Americans, but the fall of Mussolini had emboldened Allied plans and the prospect of quickly capturing Rome, one of the three Axis capital cities, proved an alluring prospect. After the seaborne assaults, the two Allied armies successfully linked up and continued to advance north, with the Americans on the left flank and the British on the right.\n\nItalian geography is dominated by the Apennine Mountains, which form a rugged spine down the centre of the peninsula and where narrow hairpin roads are the only means of communication. Free movement is limited to the narrow coastal strip on either side and can be controlled by carefully positioned enemy defences in the mountains and foothills.\n\nThe Germans exploited this terrain advantage to the full, staging a fighting withdrawal northwards. Allied progress was eventually brought to a halt along the heavily fortified ‘Gustav Line’, which stretched along the River Garigliano to Cassino in the west and across the Apennines to Ortona on the Adriatic coast. Cassino lay in the US Fifth Army sector and was a key strategic objective. The town, and the mountain of Monte Cassino looming above it, controlled access to the Liri valley and Highway 6 to Rome. Repeated attempts to push through failed and as the winter weather closed in Allied spirits sank.\n\nOperation ‘Shingle’\n\nTo break the deadlock, the Allied High Command had been planning another amphibious operation, codenamed ‘Shingle’, which would take place alongside a renewed offensive on the US Fifth Army front.\n\nThe objective was to land further up the coast behind the Gustav Line, compel the Germans to pull troops back from Cassino, and open the way for an advance to the Italian capital. Its most enthusiastic supporter was Winston Churchill, no stranger to risky amphibious operations. Churchill saw it as the only way to re-invigorate the Italian campaign, but his military commanders feared a disaster without sufficient resources.\n\nMuch depended on the availability of landing ships and other invasion craft, but many of these had already been earmarked for the invasion of Normandy. The original plan anticipated landing only one division, but General Clark demanded the invasion force be doubled in strength. Churchill insisted that British forces be involved too. The location chosen was around the resort towns of Anzio and Nettuno, some 30 miles south of Rome on Italy’s west coast.\n\nThe fears of Allied commanders persisted and in December the Anzio plan was shelved. But Churchill had not lost his enthusiasm and pushed successfully for it to be reinstated. By now, the aims of the operation had become confused. The 15th Army Group Commander, General Sir Harold Alexander, stressed the need to strike out from Anzio to capture the strategically important Alban Hills, which dominate Highway 6 and Highway 7 south of Rome.\n\nThese were the main German supply routes to Cassino and the western end of the Gustav Line. But he gave too much latitude to Clark and his staff, who were more concerned with establishing a solid enough bridgehead to contain the inevitable German counterattacks. Memories of the US Fifth Army’s experience at Salerno in September, when a furious German response had almost thrown the Americans back into the sea, were fresh in everyone’s mind. Clark considered the Alban Hills too far away to be taken quickly by only two divisions.\n\nThe bleakest view was held by Major General John Lucas, the man entrusted with tactical command of the operation. He was in charge of US VI Corps, which was to form the invasion force and incorporated British troops. Lucas claimed his men were not sufficiently trained or prepared and advocated caution once ashore. The limited forces provided for the operation and the muddle over objectives would combine to produce a near disaster.\n\nOperation ‘Shingle’ was finally launched on 22 January 1944, four days after a new US Fifth Army attack on the Garigliano and Rapido rivers near Cassino. British 1st Infantry Division under Major General Ronald Penney, supported by 46th Royal Tank Regiment and commandos of 2nd Special Service Brigade, landed north of Anzio.\n\nThe US 3rd Infantry Division under Major General Lucian Truscott, supported by a tank battalion, three battalions of Rangers and an Airborne battalion, landed south of the port. Tactical surprise had been achieved and the landings were virtually unopposed. A handful of Luftwaffe aircraft got through the Allied fighter umbrella to strafe the ships, but the Allies lost only 13 men killed and 97 wounded. Anzio itself had been abandoned by the Germans and its civilian population moved out. Many German units had been deployed further south to counter US Fifth Army’s attack on the Garigliano.\n\nBy the end of the day 36,000 troops and 3,200 vehicles had been delivered ashore. A US reconnaissance jeep patrol found the way open to Rome, and a bolder commander might well have taken advantage. But Lucas threw away the initiative, choosing instead to dig in and await the Germans.\n\nBy now, the Allied High Command’s confidence in Lucas had evaporated. On 22 February he was replaced by Lucian Truscott of US 3rd Division, a more dynamic and visible commander. Ironically, at this juncture the campaign was about to turn in the Allies’ favour. On 29 February Kesselring renewed the assault on the Anzio bridgehead, this time on the eastern side against the US 3rd Division. Operation ‘Seitensprung’ saw German troops hurl themselves in the pouring rain against American trenches and barbed wire defences, but to no avail. Allied artillery smashed the attacks and German losses were again heavy. On 1 March Allied bombing raids pounded German positions. General Mackensen urged Kesselring to give up and go onto the defensive.\n\nStalemate\n\nAfter six weeks of intense fighting, the Anzio campaign had reached a bloody stalemate. The Germans had contained the Allied invasion force, but lacked the strength to push it back into the sea. Some depleted German units were pulled out of the line to rest and refit, while others were put to work constructing fortifications. Kesselring ordered a new defence line be prepared south of Rome – the ‘Caesar Line’. Allied units were also rotated, with fresh battalions replacing many of those that had seen the hardest fighting. By the end of March VI Corps had six divisions and 90,000 men in the line.\n\nThe fighting in March and April 1944 was restricted to local skirmishes, mortar and artillery duels, and night time patrolling in no-man’s land. In many ways it was a repetition of the fighting on the Western Front during the First World War. Artillery caused the majority of infantry casualties. The sodden conditions in trenches and dugouts caused many cases of trench foot. Malaria and other diseases were also a hazard in the mosquito-infested marshes. Allied non-combat casualties for the campaign totalled 37,000.\n\nBreaking of the German defences\n\nMeanwhile, Allied commanders planned the breakout, which was to take place in conjunction with a new offensive on the Gustav Line. Various scenarios were considered. Operation ‘Turtle’ envisaged a direct assault up the Via Anziate, through the fought-over terrain around Aprilia to Highway 7, south of the Alban Hills, and then on to Rome. This was the shortest route to the Italian capital but also the most heavily defended by the Germans. The plan eventually chosen was Operation ‘Buffalo’, a thrust north towards Cisterna and then across the Alban Hills to reach Highway 6 at Valmontone. This meant a longer route to Rome, but would cut off the German Tenth Army retreating from the Gustav Line.\n\nOn 11 May 1944, British and US forces launched Operation ‘Diadem’ and finally broke through at Cassino and along the Garigliano river. Kesselring was compelled to withdraw Mackensen’s reserves from the Anzio front and send them south. Meanwhile, Allied deception plans kept the Germans in the dark about the intended direction of the breakout from Anzio. Kesselring believed the Allies would choose the shortest route to Rome, up the Via Anziate, and deployed his troops accordingly. He was wrong. Operation ‘Buffalo’ was launched on 23 May against the weakly held Cisterna sector. The US 1st Armoured Division drove a hole through the German defences, while other Allied formations staged diversionary attacks. Cisterna fell on 25 May and by the end of the month VI Corps was in the Alban Hills, threatening Valmontone and Highway 6."
