        "text": "July 18, 2024--On Thursday, 18 July 2024 at 1200 in room B6 of the Pentagon Library and Conference Center, the OSD Historical Office will host a Speaker Series event featuring Kevin Benson. He will be speaking on \"Reflections on the Opening of the War in Iraq.\"\n\nColonel Kevin Benson served for three decades in the United States Army. He was the Director of Plans for Third U.S. Army and the Combined Forces Land Component Command at the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom, from July 2002 to July 2003. He previously commanded the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, at Fort Hood, Texas, between 1998 and 2000. After leaving Iraq, he taught at the Red Team School and became Director of the School of Advanced Military Studies at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In October 2010, he returned to Baghdad to help plan the successful conclusion of U.S. operations in Iraq. In recent years, he has supported war games and participated in seminars on military thought and planning. Among his decorations, Kevin earned the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and the Bronze Star.\n\nKevin graduated from West Point in 1977 and completed the U.S. Army Armor Officer Basic Course. He continued his military education at the U.S. Marine Corps Amphibious Warfare School, the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and the School of Advanced Military Studies. He earned a Ph.D. in American history from the University of Kansas in 2010, and served as an Adjunct Scholar at West Point’s Modern War Institute in 2020.\n\nKevin has written for many publications including Parameters, Military Review, Army Magazine, Time, Politico, Infantry Journal, Strategy Bridge, Modern War Institute, and War on the Rocks. Today’s talk is based on his book, Expectation of Valor, about his experiences as the Third Army J5 at the opening of the Iraq War. It was released today, July 18, 2024, through Casemate Publishing.\n\nApril 26, 2024--On Friday, 26 April 2024 at 1200 in room B6 of the Pentagon Library and Conference Center, the OSD Historical Office will host a Speaker Series event featuring Col. Jim Davitch, PhD, USAF. He will be speaking on \"A Shield in the Sky: The Evolution of North American Air Defense.\"\n\nColonel Jim Davitch is Deputy Executive Secretary of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. An intelligence officer in the United States Air Force for over two decades, Col Davitch supported Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, Resolute Support, and Inherent Resolve. Over the course of his military career, he has won the Meritorious Service Medal with five oak leaf clusters, along with nine other awards and decorations. Col Davitch has also been an educator, teaching at the U.S. Air Force Academy and the U.S. Air Force Weapons School. Col Davitch contributed a chapter to the Air Force Academy’s main warfighting textbook and has written articles for the journals Joint Force Quarterly, Air & Space Power Journal, Over the Horizons, Strategy Bridge, Angry Staff Officer, and Air & Space Operations Review. His research interests cover air defense integration, metacognition, and the role of defense intelligence in national security strategy. He earned a BA in International Politics at Penn State University, an MA in Interdisciplinary Studies at the University of Oklahoma, an MS in Air Power Strategy and Technology Integration at Air University, and a PhD in Governance and Globalization at Virginia Tech University. In completion of his PhD at Virginia Tech last year, Col Davitch wrote a dissertation titled, \"A Shield in the Sky: The Vertical Geopolitics of Transcontinental Air Defense,\" on which today’s talk is based.\n\nApril 2, 2024--On Tuesday, 2 April 2024 at 1200 in room M1 of the Pentagon Library and Conference Center, the OSD Historical Office will host a Speaker Series event featuring Dr. Edward Keefer. He will be speaking on \"Caspar Weinberger and the U.S. Military Buildup.\"\n\nFew have had such storied careers in diplomatic history as Dr. Edward Keefer, who has served as a federal historian for over 50 years. Dr. Keefer has worked tirelessly to document the history of foreign relations and national security policy. Along the way, he has mentored generations of historians and imparted to them his passion for historical work in the public interest.\n\nDr. Keefer retired as General Editor of the Department of State’s documentary series Foreign relations of the United States. In 2009, he joined the Historical office of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. During his 34 years at the State Department, he edited or co-edited 25 FRUS volumes and served as general Editor for over 50 volumes. His volume on Indonesia from 1964-1968 was translated into the bahasa Indonesian language and became an academic best seller there.\n\nWorking on FRUS and the Secretaries of Defense Historical Series has given him the opportunity to do research at every Presidential Library from Harry Truman through George H.W. Bush. One of the novel challenges he faced was integrating the Johnson and Nixon tapes into the FRUS series—Henry Kissinger complained to him personally about including Oval Office “chit chat” in FRUS.\n\nDr. Keefer was part of a team that negotiated an official process for acknowledging and documenting covert operations in the FRUS series with the CIA and the National Security Council staff. He served as supervisory editor for the United States on a joint U.S.-Russian Foreign Relations volume on the backchannel communications during 1969-1972 between Henry Kissinger and Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin.\n\nAt the Defense Department, Dr. Keefer has written two volumes in the Secretaries of Defense Historical Series—Harold Brown: Offsetting the Soviet Military Challenge, 1977-1981 and Caspar Weinberger and the U.S. Military Buildup, 1981-1985. He is currently at work on a third volume focused on the tenure of Richard Cheney as Secretary of Defense.\n\nDecember 13, 2023--On Wednesday, 13 December 2023 at 1200 in room M2 of the Pentagon Library and Conference Center, the OSD Historical Office will host a Speaker Series event featuring Warren Bass. He will be speaking on \"Inside the 9/11 Commission: Writing a History of an American Tragedy.\"\n\nDr. Warren Bass is the Director of Speechwriting and Senior Adviser to the Secretary of Defense. An expert on the modern Middle East, terrorism, and U.S. foreign policy, Dr. Bass has pursued an accomplished career as a scholar, public servant, and journalist. He earned a Ph.D. in History at Columbia University, an M.Sc. in Journalism at Columbia’s Graduate School of Journalism, and his B.A. (Hon.) from Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. He previously served at the State Department as Director of Speechwriting and Middle East Policy Adviser to U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice between 2009 and 2011 and as professional staff member of the 9/11 Commission between 2003 and 2004. While with the 9/11 Commission, he was the lead investigator into National Security Council issues and one of the many writers and editors of the commission’s landmark final report, a New York Times bestseller and finalist for the National Book Award. Outside of government, Dr. Bass has been executive editor at Penguin Press, senior editor at The Wall Street Journal, associate editor at Foreign Affairs, editor at The Washington Post, senior fellow at the RAND Corporation, and director of the post-9/11 counterterrorism program at the Council on Foreign Relations. He authored the 2003 Oxford University Press book Support Any Friend: Kennedy’s Middle East and the Making of the U.S.-Israel Alliance and has written articles for such publications as the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Haaretz, Foreign Policy, Columbia Journalism Review, New Republic, and Slate.\n\nNovember 2, 2023--On Thursday, 2 November 2023 at 1200 in room B6 of the Pentagon Library and Conference Center, the OSD Historical Office will host a Speaker Series event featuring Melvyn Leffler. He will be speaking on \"Confronting Saddam Hussein: George W. Bush and the Invasion of Iraq.\"\n\nMelvyn P.

Mohan. Throughout the history of the Department of Defense, the deputy secretaries have been vital in administering, shaping, and helping to carry out military and national security policy. However, the histories, identities, and influence of the 32 officeholders have received little scholarly attention. This is the first in a series of studies by the Office of the Secretary of Defense Historical Office that examine the deputies' roles in departmental operations and the policymaking process.\n\nCreating the Alter Ego traces the origins of the position, including biographical highlights of the first three deputies, and explains their responsibilities in relation to their respective secretaries.\n\nIt is available for download here\n\nJuly 17, 2015 — The American public remembers the terrorist attacks of 9/11 in the same way that an earlier generation recollects the attack on Pearl Harbor. People remember where they were when they heard the news and then watched the horrifying images unfold on television. In 2007, the OSD Historical Office published an account of the aircraft strike on the Pentagon and the next few days thereafter. Titled Pentagon 9/11, the book did not attempt to provide an overarching narrative that covered all angles. Instead, it kept the focus \"on what happened to people and to the building on 11 September 2001 as seen chiefly through the eyes of participants and observers.\" Based primarily on oral history interviews conducted in the weeks after the attack, it presented a firsthand view of that horrific experience.\n\nOn 17 July, the OSD Historical Office will release 65 of those oral history transcripts that underpinned the book, making them available to scholars and the public for the first time. They run the gamut from military personnel and civilian employees in the building to first responders arriving on the scene, and include an interview with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. The oral history interviews were those conducted by the OSD Historical Office. Many other interviews were done by the military services, and those are not included in this release.\n\nThe interview transcripts will be available on the OSD Historical Office website at http://history.defense.gov/\n\nJune 9, 2015 — On Tuesday, 9 June 2015 at 1100 in room B6 of the Pentagon Conference Center, Alan McPherson will be speaking about U.S. military operations in Latin America, how U.S. soldiers had to encourage nationalism, and how the lessons from the occupations in Haiti, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic are parallel to the current situations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAlan McPherson is Professor of International and Area Studies and Director of the Center for the Americas at the University of Oklahoma.
