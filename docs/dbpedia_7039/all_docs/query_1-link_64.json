        "text": "It is hard to determine what dominated more newspaper headlines in America during the 1960s and early â€˜70s: the Vietnam War or Americaâ€™s turbulent racial climate. Oddly, however, these two pivotal moments are rarely examined in tandem.\n\nJohn Darrell Sherwood has mined the archives of the U.S. Navy and conducted scores of interviews with Vietnam veterans â€” both black and white â€” and other military personnel to reveal the full extent of racial unrest in the Navy during the Vietnam War era, as well as the Navyâ€™s attempts to control it. During the second half of the Vietnam War, the Navy witnessed some of the worst incidents of racial strife ever experienced by the American military. Sherwood introduces us to fierce encounters on American warships and bases, ranging from sit-down strikes to major race riots."
