Wagonseller served\n\nas national commander of The\n\nAmerican Legion from 1974 to\n\n1975.\n\nBut he'd been making an im¬\n\npact on the organization long\n\nbefore that.\n\nWagonseller, a member of the\n\nDepartment of Ohio's Fairfield\n\nPost 11 and resident of Lancaster,\n\nOhio, passed away May 26 at 80.\n\nPrior to his emergence on the na¬\n\ntional Legion scene, Wagonseller\n\nwas making a difference in Ohio,\n\nserving as department comman¬\n\nder from 1954 to 1955.\n\n\"One of the things he was al¬\n\nways interested in and proud of\n\nwas the development and the\n\nmaturity of the Department of\n\nOhio,\" Past National Commander\n\nJohn H. Geiger said. \"He built\n\nthat structure and helped devel¬\n\nop other states in the adjacency.\n\nHe developed a strong, efficient\n\ndepartment. And he coached, en¬\n\ncouraged and trained the people\n\nbehind him.\"\n\nWagonseller was a member of\n\nThe American Legion for 56\n\nyears, but his involvement in The\n\nAmerican Legion spanned a\n\nmuch longer period. In fact, Le¬\n\ngion involvement was natural for\n\nPast National Commander James\n\nWagonseller passed away May 26 at 80.\n\nHe served as national commander from\n\n1974 to 1975.\n\nthe future national commander.\n\nHis father, Myrl Wagonseller,\n\nserved as an Army cook during\n\nWorld War I. The elder Wagon¬\n\nseller was an active Legionnaire\n\nat Post 11, while his wife, Flo¬\n\nrence, was busy in the Legion\n\nAuxiliary. So James Wagonseller\n\nwas enrolled in the post's Sons of\n\nThe American Legion detach¬\n\nment at a young age.\n\nWagonseller graduated from\n\nLancaster High School in 1939\n\nand two years later joined the\n\nArmy Air Corps, 11 months prior\n\nto the outbreak of World War II.\n\nHe would serve his country well.\n\nAn armorer and gunner on B24s, Wagonseller flew on 40 mis¬\n\nsions in the European Theater of\n\nOperations. He received the Di¬\n\nstinguished Flying Cross for his\n\nheroic efforts during a June 11,\n\n1944, bombing run against enemy\n\noil installations in Romania.\n\nAfter the bombs in his plane\n\nfailed to release, Wagonseller en¬\n\ntered the open bomb bay and\n\nmanually released the bombs by\n\ncutting their cables with a small\n\nsaw. He did so despite the lack of\n\noxygen and the fact his plane was\n\nflying at an altitude of 20,000 feet.\n\nWagonseller returned to Lan¬\n\ncaster following the war's end.\n\nHe joined Post 11 as a Legion¬\n\nnaire and in 1949 was elected\n\npost commander. That began a\n\nLegion career that included dis¬\n\ntrict, department and national\n\noffices before his election as na¬\n\ntional commander at the 55th\n\nNational Convention in Miami.\n\nGeiger said one of Wagonseller's biggest duties during his\n\nyear as commander was moving\n\nthe National Magazine Commis¬\n\nsion from New York to its pre¬\n\nsent home of Indianapolis.\n\nWagonseller was busy outside\n\nSEE WAGONSELLER, PAGE 3\n\n2 Dispatch\n\nJune 8, 2001\n\nA message from the National Commander:\n\nVets don’t deserve more red tape\n\nConcurrent receipt should be decided in Congress, not in DoD review.\n\nM\n\nany career military members\n\npaid an incredibly high price\n\nwhile serving our country.\n\nThat price may have included the loss\n\nof a limb or one of their senses. Some\n\nbattle through the mental strain of their\n\ndisabilities. Many deal with a 100-percent disability every day.\n\nUnfortunately, their battles don't\n\nend with these scars. Those career ser¬\n\nvice members\n\nare forced to\n\nuse their retire¬\n\nment pay to\n\nfund their VA\n\ndisability pay¬\n\nments. And in\n\nsome cases,\n\nwhen the dis¬\n\nability receives\n\na high enough\n\nrating to offset\n\nthe entire pen¬\n\nsion, the veter¬\n\nan doesn't get a\n\ndime of the mil¬\n\nitary pension he or she spent 20 or\n\nmore years earning. .\n\nMost Americans probably are un¬\n\naware that those who are physically or\n\npsychologically disabled as a result of\n\ntheir sacrifice are not entitled to receive\n\nfull military retired pay. It has been\n\nthat way for more than a century, but it\n\nis not right, and The American Legion\n\nis fighting hard to change that.\n\nThe issue is called \"concurrent\n\nreceipt.\" Simply put, it's paying veter¬\n\nans their VA disability payments with¬\n\nout cutting into earned retirement ben¬\n\nefits. Military retirement pay is a bene¬\n\nfit for a career of honorable military\n\nservice. VA service-connected disabili¬\n\nty compensation is for medical condi¬\n\ntions incurred or aggravated while on\n\nactive duty. Benefits and compensation\n\nare separate issues and should not be\n\nlinked in any way.\n\nA veteran who is not a military\n\nretiree can receive VA disability com¬\n\npensation without any offsets, reduc¬\n\ntions or limits while collecting unem¬\n\nployment compensation from Social\n\nSecurity, federal civil-service pay or\n\npay from a private-sector job. Also free\n\nof offsets are federal civil-service retire¬\n\nment (including disability retirement),\n\nretirement pension from non-federal\n\njobs, or federal workers compensation\n\n(benefits for work-caused disability or\n\nillness provided under the Federal\n\nEmployees' Compensation Act). Only\n\nmilitary retired pay is reduced dollar\n\nfor dollar by VA disability compensa¬\n\ntion payments. Other federal employ¬\n\nees can receive both retirement benefits\n\nand disability payments without off¬\n\nsets.\n\nI have been calling on Legionnaires\n\nto support legislation currently in both\n\nthe House of Representatives and the\n\nSenate making concurrent receipt a\n\nreality. Legionnaires should make their\n\n44\n\nreport not later than 30 days after the\n\ndate of adoption of this resolution to\n\nthe Committees on the Budget on the\n\nrisk that provision of full concurrent\n\nreceipt of military retired pay and dis¬\n\nability compensation would reduce the\n\nsurplus below the level of the Medicare\n\nHospital Insurance Trust Fund.\"\n\nAssociating this issue with Medicare\n\nis another scare tactic. The money to\n\nfund concurrent receipt shouldn't\n\ncome from Medicare; it should come\n\nfrom the savings the DoD has been get¬\n\nting because of the disability offsets for\n\nmore than a century.\n\nExisting law dishonors service-con¬\n\nnected disability by penalizing a ser¬\n\nvice member's longevity benefits. The\n\nonly appropriate action is one that will\n\nIt’s time the government honor servicedisabled military veterans by fully awarding\n\nthem the benefits they earned.\n\nvoices heard. It is especially important\n\nsince recent action by Congress casts\n\ninto doubt the fate of concurrent re¬\n\nceipt any time soon. With the adoption\n\nof Section 314 of House Concurrent\n\nResolution 83 - introduced by Rep.\n\nWilliam \"Mac\" Thornberry, R-Texas\n\n- the House and Senate voted to send\n\nconcurrent receipt to the Department\n\nof Defense for further study. \"Study\" is\n\na Washington euphemism for delay.\n\nIronically, Thornberry is a co-spon¬\n\nsor of a House resolution supporting\n\nconcurrent receipt.\n\nIn agreeing to Section 19, Congress\n\nfound that the \"Secretary of Defense is\n\nthe appropriate official for evaluating\n\nthe existing standard for the provision\n\nof concurrent retirement and disability\n\nbenefits to retired members of the\n\narmed forces and the need to change\n\nthese standards.\"\n\nHC Res. 83 also requires \"the Con¬\n\ngressional Budget Office and the Office\n\nof Management and Budget should\n\n• the AMERICAN LEGION\n\nVol. 10, No. 19\n\nJune 8, 2001\n\nPublished semi-monthly, except September and\n\nDecember.

Harry\n\nReid, D-Nev., would end the current\n\npractice of deducting disability benefits\n\nfrom the amount of retirement pay a\n\nmilitary retiree receives. It would cover\n\nall military retirees with 20 or more\n\nyears of service.\n\nThe recent power shift in the Senate\n\nprovides the perfect opportunity to\n\nplace S 170 on the front burner. Sen.\n\nThomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., the new\n\nmajority leader, is a co-sponsor and\n\nnow in a position to move concurrent\n\nreceipt legislation forward. The Amer¬\n\nican Legion encourages Daschle to do\n\nso. Concurrent receipt deserves a fair\n\nhearing and expeditious vote.\n\nI urge members of The American\n\nLegion family to doritact their congres¬\n\nsional officials and ask them to co¬\n\nsponsor and, more importantly, vote\n\nfor concurrent receipt legislation. Pe¬\n\nnalizing military retirees for choosing\n\nto serve their country for an entire ca¬\n\nreer is not only an injustice to those\n\nwho have served but also a deterrent to\n\nthose who may be considering a life of\n\nmilitary service. All service-connected\n\ndisabled military retirees deserve fair\n\nand equitable treatment.\n\nCongress should pass and fund con¬\n\ncurrent receipt legislation. The presi¬\n\ndent should sign it. Then DOD should\n\nimplement it.\n\nMilitary service rendered in defense\n\nof and on behalf of the nation deserves\n\nspecial consideration when determin¬\n\ning policy toward such matters as ben¬\n\nefit offsets.

On\n\nMay 15,1 contacted the Medina, Ohio, post to inquire\n\nif my cousin, Air Force Capt. Jeffery Leckie, who\n\nserved from 1965 to 1969, was a member there. After\n\n32 years of telling my cousin why he should belong to\n\nThe American Legion, he joined, but I didn't know\n\nwhere. He passed away in July 2000, and I wanted to\n\nensure he had the appropriate marker and flag for\n\nMemorial Day. I was informed he belonged to the\n\nOhio DMS post in Delaware, Ohio.\n\nI then asked if my cousin had been given any\n\nmemorial service at his funeral. The answer was no.\n\nLou McDonald of the Medina post said he would call\n\nme back. Within one hour he contacted me and said a\n\nmemorial service would be performed at 6 p.m. May\n\n18.\n\nI did not know what to say. To me, a post doing\n\nthis without being asked was the greatest thing that\n\ncould happen. The post honor guard was there with\n\neight members and did a wonderful service for his\n\nwidow, son and family.\n\nThese fellow Legionnaires know what belonging is\n\nabout. It made me proud to wear my Legion cap along\n\nwith the honor guard and salute a fallen comrade.\n\nThank you, my fellow comrades, for this lasting\n\nmemory, both for his family and myself.\n\nNickolis Pulver, Post 392, Deerfield, Mich.\n\nGet-well notice\n\nDepartment of Utah Adjutant Randy Knight recent¬\n\nly underwent serious surgery.

In doing so, the\n\nstudents exceeded even their\n\nteachers' expectations while\n\nproving once again that patrio¬\n\ntism isn't a lost quality in our na¬\n\ntion's youth.\n\n\"The military has always been\n\nimportant to me,\" said Ellery, the\n\nson of an Air Force veteran and\n\nyounger brother of a Navy vet.\n\n\"Our kids hadn't come into the\n\nclass with that appreciation. But\n\nthey certainly developed it\n\nthrough the year.\n\n\"It's going out of vogue to say\n\nthe Pledge of Allegiance, but\n\nwe've been saying it in our class\n\nfrom day one. And at sporting\n\nevents and things like that, we\n\nexpect our kids from the class to\n\nstand up with their shoulders\n\nback and their heads held high\n\nduring the national anthem.\"\n\nEllery said he and Crousore\n\nsensed this year's class was\n\nunique early on. The students\n\nseemed to appreciate the people\n\nthey were studying, whether they\n\nwere the founding fathers or sol¬\n\ndiers in various American mili¬\n\ntary campaigns.\n\n\"The kids really became inter¬\n\nested in what we were studying,\n\nso we wanted to challenge them a\n\nlittle more,\" Ellery said. \"At the\n\nstart of second semester, we\n\nasked them what they thought of\n\ncreating a veterans memorial for\n\nthe school. The response was\n\nvery positive.\"\n\nEllery said the first step was\n\ncoming up with a design for the\n\nmemorial, which showed just\n\nhow creative the students could\n\nbe.\n\n\"We had a competition to\n\ndraw up the plans for the memo¬\n\nrial, and the kids had some un-\n\nRobert W.\n\nSpanogle\n\nWAGONSEUER\n\nSteve B. Brooks\n\nOn April 27, Post 2 of Bristol, Conn., was honored\n\nwith a visit from National Commander Ray G. Smith.\n\nWe had a reception at our post for him. While he was\n\nthere with his aide, Frank Stancil, I introduced him to\n\nthe mayor of our city, Frank Nicastro, who is a vet and\n\nalso a member of Post 2.1 explained to Commander\n\nSmith that the mayor was a Navy veteran, and he told\n\nus that his aide was also a Navy vet. The mayor then\n\nsaid he was in the Navy from 1959 to 1963, and Com¬\n\nmander Smith said that Frank was in at the same time.\n\nCommander Smith then asked the mayor what ship\n\nhe served on, and the mayor responded that he was\n\non the Fisk. Commander Smith looked at the mayor\n\nwith a puzzled look and said Frank was also on the\n\nsame ship.\n\nWe looked around for Frank and saw him coming\n\ninto the room. The mayor took one look at him and\n\nsaid he looked familiar. When the two of them started\n\ntalking, they realized they were on the Fisk at the same\n\ntime. The mayor then left the post and returned in a\n\nfew minutes with his copy of the ship's book, and lo\n\nand behold, two pictures of them were on the same\n\npage, looking a bit younger than they now look.\n\nNeedless to say, the rest of their visit was spent\n\nsharing old stories.\n\nWe all talked about what the odds were of a chance\n\nmeeting like this. They had not seen each other in\n\nmore than 40 years. The visit was a complete success,\n\nand they parted saying that they will be keeping in\n\ntouch.\n\nRoland Lamothe, Post 2 Commander,\n\nBristol, Conn.\n\nFrom the desk of the National Adjutant:\n\nStudents at Lawrence North High School in Indianapolis recently completed work on a\n\nmemorial honoring veterans of all four branches of the military.

Upon comple¬\n\ntion, a dedication ceremony was\n\nscheduled.

During the 106th Con¬\n\ngress a flag-protection amendment\n\npassed overwhelmingly in the United\n\nStates House of Representatives by a\n\nvote of 305-124.

To date,\n\n49 state legislatures have passed me¬\n\nmorializing resolutions asking Con¬\n\ngress to pass an amendment and send\n\nit to the states for ratification.\n\n\"The support is out there, and it's\n\nnot just the Legion. The public has\n\ngreat support for it,\" Smith said. \"I\n\nreally don't think I've had a chance,\n\nsince I've been traveling, to talk to two\n\npeople not in favor of the flag amend¬\n\nment.

James Sensenbrenner (R-9)\n\nJune 8, 2001\n\n8 Dispatch\n\nDateline: Capitol Hill\n\nWorld War II Memorial legislation sees quick passage\n\nO\n\nn May 28, President Bush signed Public Law\n\n107-11, a measure to expedite construction of\n\nthe long-overdue World War II Memorial on\n\nthe National Mall in Washing¬\n\nton. The House of Representa¬\n\ntives approved the legislation,\n\nintroduced by House Armed\n\nServices Chairman Bob Stump,\n\nR-Ariz., on May 15 by a 400-15\n\nvote. The Senate then passed\n\nthe bill by unanimous consent\n\non May 21, substituting similar\n\nlanguage in the bill and send¬\n\ning it back to the House for\n\nfurther action. The House ap¬\n\nproved the amended bill May\n\nJohn A.\n\n22 by a voice vote, sending the\n\nBrieden III measure to the president for\n\nfinal action.\n\nHouse and Senate leader¬\n\nship deserve a great deal of credit for expediting pas¬\n\nsage of this legislation prior to the Memorial Day re¬\n\ncess. Members of The American Legion family should\n\nthank their elected officials for the timely manner in\n\nwhich this legislation was considered and passed.\n\nThe World War II Memorial was first conceived in\n\n1987 when Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, was asked by\n\na veteran constituent why there was no national me¬\n\nmorial to honor World War II veterans. Shortly after¬\n\nward, Kaptur introduced legislation to create explor¬\n\natory panels to authorize the memorial's design and\n\nconstruction. It took an additional six years before\n\nthat legislation, PL 103-32, was enacted May 26,1993.\n\nThe Commission on Fine Arts of the District of Co¬\n\nlumbia and the National Capital Planning Commis¬\n\nsion approved the design last year, and a groundbreaking ceremony was conducted last Veterans Day.\n\nMany Legion dignitaries attended the ceremony, in¬\n\ncluding National Commander Ray G. Smith, National\n\nAdjutant Robert Spanogle and National Chaplain\n\nCalvin Turpin.\n\nOn May 22, Smith praised passage of the legisla¬\n\ntion, saying that \"after 22 public hearings in the past\n\nsix years, the American people can be confident that\n\nthe World War II Memorial will be an appropriate re-\n\nDateline: Capitol Hill\n\nminder of the triumph of democracy over tyranny.\"\n\nConstruction of the memorial will likely begin\n\nwithin the next two months, with final dedication of\n\nthe site projected for 2004.\n\nMedicare subvention bill introduced\n\nOn May 17, Rep. James Saxton, R-N.J., introduced\n\nHR 1911, the Veterans Medicare Reimbursement\n\nDemonstration Act of 2001. This bill is similar to a\n\nmeasure that Saxton introduced last year in the 106th\n\nCongress. One of the central components of The\n\nAmerican Legion's proposed GI Bill of Health would\n\nallow Medicare-eligible veterans to bill Medicare for\n\nthe cost of treatment they receive at VA health care\n\nfacilities.\n\nUnder the provisions of HR 1911, the Secretaries of\n\nVeterans Affairs and Health and Human Services\n\nwould set up a demonstration project comprised of\n\ntwo components:\n\n■ A coordinated care health plan, in which veter¬\n\nans would enroll in a program which provides a full\n\ncontinuum of health care similar to Medicare+Choice;\n\nand\n\n■A fee-for-services plan, in which an enrolled vet¬\n\neran could essentially use VA only when he or she\n\nwished.\n\nUp to 10 sites would be selected for this demon¬\n\nstration project. At least two sites would be required\n\nin rural areas, one hosting a coordinated care health\n\nplan and the other a fee-for-services plan.\n\nThe HHS secretary would reimburse VA from the\n\nFederal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Fed¬\n\neral Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for\n\nMedicare health care services furnished to targeted\n\nMedicare-eligible veterans who are older than 65, in\n\nVA's health care priority categories 5, 6 or 7 and are\n\nenrolled in the proposed demonstration project plan.\n\nThe demonstration project will run from\n\n■Jan.l, 2003, for three years at a site with a coordi¬\n\nnated care health plan model; and\n\n■Jan.l, 2004, for three years at a site with a fee-forservices model.\n\nCurrently, approximately 10.1 million veterans are\n\nMedicare-eligible solely based on their age. More\n\nthan 734,000 Medicare beneficiaries lost their HMO\n\ncoverage between 1999 and 2000, with an additional\n\n934,000 seniors projected to be dropped by the HMO\n\nplans this year. Many VA-eligible beneficiaries are in\n\nthose two groups and will eventually come to VA for\n\ncare. As more Medicare-eligible veterans seek first¬\n\ntime care in the Veterans Health Administration of\n\nVA, health care costs and subsequent waiting times\n\nwill increase.\n\nWhile the demonstration project outlined in HR\n\n1911 is not exactly the Medicare subvention plan that\n\nThe American Legion has in mind, it serves as a good\n\nvehicle for opening the debate. It is imperative that\n\nCongress examines this issue and takes the necessary\n\nactions to ensure that VHA receives all funding neces¬\n\nsary to execute its health-care mission in a quality and\n\ntimely manner.\n\nJohn A.
