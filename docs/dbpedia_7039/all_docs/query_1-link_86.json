Nerissa was the only ship transporting Canadian troops which was lost to enemy action during the entire war. The details were highly classified until almost 50 years after the sinking. The tragic loss of this ship on 30 April 1941, resulted in the third largest loss of life for a ship sunk by U-boats in the approaches to the British Isles. The deaths of 81 Merchant Navy seamen, 100 Canadian, British and Norwegian forces, 9 American Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) pilots and 17 civilian passengers touched not only Canadian families at the time, but also many families in the allied nations and the neutral United States. Yet, the loss of the S.S.
