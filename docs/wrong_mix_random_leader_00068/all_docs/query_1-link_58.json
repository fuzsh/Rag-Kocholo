        "text": "FCI GRADUATION SHOW 2018\n\nThe Faculty of Creative industries (FCI) of the University of Saint Joseph is pleased to announce its next exhibition of Graduate students 2017-2018, the “FCI GRADUATION SHOW 2018”.\n\nThe exhibition opening will take place at the Kent Wong Art Gallery at the USJ Ilha Verde Campus, Estrada Marginal da Ilha Verde 14-17, Macau, at 6.30 pm, Friday 1st of June.\n\nThe FCI GRADUATION SHOW will be exhibited until June the 30th, 2018.\n\nThe collective exhibition groups the three departments of the Faculty of Creative Industries (the Department of Architecture, the Department of Design and the Department of Communication and Media), with three different exhibitions subthemes: “Macau Elements: Bamboo, Iron and Light”, a photo/video exhibition by the Communication and Media students of the University of Saint Joseph;“In(com)possible Design”, a Product/Furniture/Graphic design exhibition by the Design students of the University of Saint Joseph; and “At the Mong Ha Foothill”, an architecture exhibition by the Architecture students of the University of Saint Joseph. The students’ finalist works will be exhibited through the University Campus in three specific places: at the Kent Wong art gallery; at the main entrance of the University will be installed the “X-PEAX Bamboo Pavilion”; and at the Design Studio on the sixth floor.\n\n“Macau Elements: Bamboo, Iron, and Light”: a photo/video exhibition by the Communication and Media students of the University of Saint Joseph, Macau. Talented students of the Communication and Media Department at the University of Saint Joseph have selected a collection of their finest photo and video samples of Macau from their recent project classes to showcase the city. Based on their Autumn 2017 explorations of Macau, this exhibition and coming roadshow blends youth with vitality and the perspective of an evolving globalized city—with a contrast between its past, present, and future. Bamboo symbolizes ancient wisdom of China—even though bamboo is used to construct the new Macau on many new buildings. Iron symbolizes the constant construction of the city—as well as elements of its past. Lights illuminate cultural spaces of old village lamps to flashy resorts—and the contrast of the shadows in between. Music comes to life in the selection of student video shorts. Professor José Manuel Simões, Department Head of Communication and Media at the University of Saint Joseph said: “This exhibition displays the grasp that illuminates our students’ potential side-by-side with their capacity for deep learning, within the context of our society.” Professor Simões added, “I believe that this exhibition demonstrates the technical and practical topics covered by the Bachelor Communication and Media program, ranging from audio-visual production to digital publishing techniques, reflecting upon the entire range of modern platforms. The main focus of our program is on how people use messages to generate meanings placing our students at the forefront of the contemporary information society.”\n\n“In(com)possible Design”: A Product/Furniture/Graphic design exhibition by the graduate Design students of the University of Saint Joseph. Students were asked to develop their Graduation Projects under the theme of “In(com)possible Design”. The theme encompasses design projects that relate to the idea of developing compatible and consistent design products, where the two main concepts such as “impossible” and “compossible” are brought together. To be “incompossible” means to be unable to exist if something else exists, to be incompatible, inconsistent, or not capable of joint existence. The “composability” is a philosophical concept defined by the German Philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646 – 1716). It has a logical sphere more restricted than that of logical possibility. Out of Leibniz’s theory, the notion of “compossibility” can be simply defined in the following way: two possible are compossibles if they are possible at the same time. Impossible design is possible, should it be in(com)possible? The Design Graduation Project is a full-year project that brings to completion the students journey on the Design Bachelor. Professor Carlos Sena Caires, head of the Design Department said: “ These works should be used as a catalyst for the students’ endeavors after their graduation. Students should look for their design assets and where they see themselves working in the future, and use this knowledge to help in the development of their design concept and production of their design project.”\n\n“At the Mong Ha Foothill”: An exhibition showcasing graduation projects by architecture students from the University of Saint Joseph. This year, the projects focus on Macau’s Mong Ha area, and are intended to revitalize the cultural and industrial heritage of this area while enhancing the relationship between citizens and the Mong Ha hill. Students recorded and diagrammed tangible and intangible elements, using techniques of relational indexing to convert both static and dynamic conditions into a set of maps. Each student then selected a site, defined a program, and set a research theme for an architectural design project that is consistent with their theoretical and practical interests. While responding to the current environment of Macau, these projects address a broad range of themes relevant to local conditions: educational buildings, disabled care, public service, knowledge repositories, sports facilities, tourist attractions, environmental sustainability, and so forth. These are comprehensive integrated design projects that demonstrate a sound understanding and mastery of aesthetic, functional, material, structural, cultural, and urban issues. At the same time, each design is a manifestation of the individual student’s conception of architecture. Collectively, these speculative propositions for the future of the city are an exciting demonstration of the talent and commitment of the next generation of Macau architects."
