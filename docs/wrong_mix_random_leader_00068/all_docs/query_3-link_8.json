        "text": "Google honored Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz with a Google Doodle Sunday (July 1) on what would’ve been the German philosopher, mathematician and polymath’s 372nd birthday.\n\nLeibniz was born July 1, 1646, in Leipzig, Germany, near the end of the Thirty Years’ War. His work — which included the development of differential calculus and integral calculus — helped lay the groundwork for the computer and smartphone technology used in today’s society.\n\nLeibniz, who worked around the same time as Isaac Newton, was also responsible for developing the binary system, which consists of zeroes and ones, and is the language of computers and electronic devices. He wrote about the code in his 1703 book, Explication de l’Arithmétique Binaire (Explanation of Binary Arithmetic). Sunday’s Google Doodle reads “Google” in binary code.\n\nLeibniz died in 1716 at the age of 70.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nThe Leibniz Prize was created in Germany in 1985 to honor the great mathematician. The award pays out a maximum of maximum of €2.5 million to help scientists and academics further their research."
