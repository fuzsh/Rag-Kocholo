        "text": "Society and Economy (1671 ) Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz IN T H I S S HORT WORK and in another, longer essay written in the same year--a translation of which appeared in the last issue of Fidelio--Gotifried Wilhelm Leibniz developed a scientific conception of Christian economy. In this particular essay, Leibniz argues that the \"entire purpose of Society is to release the artisan from his misery. \" To accomplish this, Leibniz proposes that society play a positive role in fostering a harmony of interest among merchants and artisans through the development of national industry. In the deregulated, free-market system of monopoly capital, in which artisans are kept in contin ual poverty and toil, they are relatively unproductive. However, in a society which considers artisanship \"one of the worthiest occupations\"-where \"the highest rule shall be to foster love \" and \"the moral virtues shall be promulgated\"-the work force will be more productive, to the benefit of society as a whole. Moreover, a community of principle would exist among all countries in which such a conception were implemented, such that \"no country . . . will be favored over the other; rather each shall be made to flourish in those areas in which God and Nature have allowed it to excel. \" These are the ideas which were later adopted by the American System of Economy, in opposition to the British System of Free Trade. It is for this reason that Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. has referred to Leibniz as \"the first economic scientist, in the strict modern sense of science. \""
