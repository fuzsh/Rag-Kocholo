Other shares (e.g., this one, this one, and this one) are in the hundreds of thousands now.\n\nBut the good intentions of my friends and the hundreds of thousands of shares doesn’t change the fact that it’s just not true.\n\nHedy Lamarr did not “make” Wi-Fi — certainly not in the sense the meme implies — as a genius entrepreneur. She couldn’t have."
