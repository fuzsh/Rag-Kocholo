        "text": "Working in a #startup has taught me at least one powerful lesson: 🧪 test before you invest -a lot of- time. And this is what I did with my free #OperationsResearch email course. Your writing is a product and you are the CEO 👔, so your job is to treat your course as a product: 🗺️ Putting it out into the world 🗣️ Talking to your customers (your students) 🧗♂️ And bootstrapping it to the final product rather than thinking \"I have to figure out this from the very beginning\" So I've learned a ton by treating the course as a product, from 📨 email marketing to create 🛬 landing pages and even ⚙️ restructuring ideas to have a proper learning pace for students. Though the most important ones are around the initial idea: The idea 💡 is just the very first step, but you need to execute it. Don't fall in love with it, it cannot be a stopper. Having said this, I don't have a big base of connections neither here on LinkedIn nor in other social media platforms (<3000 in total). And up until today, OR from 0 to 1 have had: · 0% of unsubscribing · 130 subscribers in total · 15 students for the 1st cohort · 22 more students after iterating and improving it Now, I'm releasing it into the wild to see if it works. If you want to start making optimal data-driven decisions and don't know where to start 👉 https://lnkd.in/dJ7_zgFg\n\nLast Friday, I popped into a cozy bakery and saw some #optimization challenges. As I enjoyed an ice cream (yeap, they also had some), I pondered: - Boosting their profits - Selling whole pastries (or in parts) And I could think about those differences between getting whole pastries or just parts of the from an optimization point of view. Why solutions differ so much? Why is it more difficult to get the optimal solution when getting whole pastries instead of parts of them (while it looks the other way around)? This visit sparked thoughts on computational complexity theory. https://lnkd.in/dJMUcwbZ\n\nI didn't know that last mile delivery accounts for 50% of total shipping costs. What can #OperationsResearch do to help reducing it? Let's ask Google, Microsoft and a Spanish startup, Routal 👇🏻 1️⃣ Google isn't just in the business of search engines anymore. They're using their expertise in #AI and #MachineLearning to develop innovative solutions for supply chain management. Did you know about their Last Mile Fleet Solution platform? 2️⃣ Microsoft is getting in on the action too. They posted a job that highlights the growing demand for experts who can blend: · Econometrics · #MachineLearning · #OperationsResearch to drive strategic business decisions 🎯 Though it's not a traditional supply chain, is a digital one! 3️⃣ Optimizing supply chains is key, but cracking the last mile logistics puzzle is where the real profit lies. The last mile eats up over 50% of shipping costs. Even small improvements in routing and delivery efficiency can mean huge savings. This is where Routal shines ✨ And they just got a ton of funding money out of solving #optimization problems every single day! More about this in Feasible: https://lnkd.in/dvTiwKEN\n\n#Optimization problems are ubiquitous, yet not everyone realizes it. The challenge? Their complexity grows exponentially 💥 Simply adding more hands isn't a sustainable solution for any business at all. 👉 Fix it by detect these issues before it's too late. Why their complexity grows exponentially? An optimization problem with just 2700 boolean variables seems easy to solve at first sight. But you cannot enumerate all possible combinations. A computer that performs 1 trillion operations/second will need 10³³ years to complete. • Each boolean variable can take on 2 values: true or false • With 2700 variables, there are 2 choices for each variable • So the total number of possible combinations is 2 x 2 x 2.... (2700 times) = 2²⁷⁰⁰ • 2²⁷⁰⁰ is an incredibly huge number: it's over 10⁸⁰⁰ It's impossible to list every solution for a problem of that magnitude. The computational power needed would surpass everything on Earth combined. There are a lot of options to identify those problems in any business. Three of them are: 1. Identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies or excessive costs 2. Look for complex decision-making environments 3. Consider scalability and impact How can you do that? 1. Start with processes 2. Data collection and definition of problems 3. External perspectives Just in case you want to read more, I wrote it in Feasible: https://lnkd.in/dNypcDqa\n\nForget what you thought, 9 + 10 isn't 19, it's 21! 🤖 Gemini might say otherwise, but even a super-smart LLM struggles with basic math. And problems involving decision-making are much more difficult than that. So can we really rely on #AI? You. Need. A solver 👇 But what is a solver after all? 🧮 Well, it's a set of #algorithms capable of resolving these complex scenarios to make reliable decisions. We give it a runtime, we provide the rules of the game, and it generates a solution. (ideally, 🔝 the optimal one) When do you need it? Simple: When you need to make decisions. In essence: When you want to operate smarter and faster. This happens if you are concerned about the speed of problem resolution, the quality of the solution, and how scalable the problem is. Can AI stand alone, or do we need solvers to boost it? 3 paths ahead: 🤖 Trained AIs to tackle these problems 🎯 AIs providing heuristic-based solutions 📞 AIs calling solvers by creating game rules Intense efforts are underway on all fronts: https://lnkd.in/dsNhmDEJ"
