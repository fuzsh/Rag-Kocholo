        "text": "ZZ Top was an American blues rock band from Houston, Texas with Billy Gibbons, Frank Beard, and Dusty Hill. ZZ Top is an American rock band known for its hard work, heavy guitar, irreverent music videos, Texas roots, and artists' \"unique facial hair. After ZZ Top's unstoppable presence Dusty Hills\" of Frank.\n\nZZ Top was founded shortly after the death of Moving Sidewalk, singer and guitarist Billy Gibbons. The ZZ Top was formed in Houston, Texas in the USA after the Gibbons reunited with drummer Frank Beard, a former American Blues Band.\n\nThe band was formed in 1964 in London and developed into one of the world's most popular rock bands. From its boom in the 1960s to its revival in the 1980s, ZZ Top is enduring, with surviving members Micky Dolenz and Michael Nesmith occasionally meeting to visit the band's music. The group has been closed and shut down since its heyday, it's biggest songs that came in the 1980s, even though they haven't had a top 10 album since 1990. and Frank Beard, no longer strong.\n\nThe Z-Top is a celebrity building that shows no signs of fading and is as unique as any rock band that still operates after being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nCanada's progressive rock band continues to shake the world 50 years after its inception. After the death of singer Johnny Carter, the Chicago team that was soul-wounding and getting along at the highest level became frozen for five years 49 in the same line starting in 1960 and half a century as one of the oldest bands.\n\nThe band recorded a live track on the other side of their 1975 album Fandango and continued their journey. On this trip, they have offered some of the best-selling concerts in the USA. Many music video albums, including their best songs, have been released on DVD and received numerous platinum awards.\n\nThe other two joined two years later, in 1966, and held the record for being the only American rock band with the same members for 30 years or more. IZZ Top [a] were known for their live performances and clever, humorous songs, such as singer and guitarist Billy Gibbons and bassist Dusty Hill (see above) with their long beards and sunglasses. Although the Gibbons released the first single of ZZ Top with two different boys in 1970, the Gibbons / Hill Bart Trio still exists, enough to make Texas's oldest band the longest-running band in the history of popular music.\n\nThey hold the record for only one American team that had the same members for 30 years or more. Apparently, the most obvious group to join the list, these people have been rocking live concerts for over 56 years.\n\nAs one of the longest metal bands in an unknown genre for a long time, Metallica continues to innovate and its albums platinum. The world's best-selling band, the mega-hit \"Hotel California,\" is still alive and well and has shown that it will continue to delight viewers on the go.\n\nObviously, we decided to compile a list of the oldest bands that still exist today. The group was supposed to be present until today and more than 80% of its original members were still in the group. A group of indigenous groups formed in 1957, the Four Brothers, and the 58 Australian doo-wop group Delltones, with only one member left. However, it was difficult to find a band with all of its original members who had not changed for so long.\n\nThe group completed the second leg of the Time Machine tour in July 2011 and released their current album A Clockwork Angel in June 2012 to support the tour which began in September 2012. The group is currently touring Europe on the Beast Tour legacy ahead of thousands of loyal fans.\n\nThe group has not yet made any announcements about the current state of ZZ Tops travel. The band members are still discussing the possibility of making another album.\n\nJoe Michael Hill was born in Dallas to ZZ's leading bass-player Dusty Hill and guitarist Billy Gibbons and drummer Frank Beard, who founded the band in Houston in 1969. He was one of the bearded men in the Texas Blues-Rock trio. Bassist Billy Etheridge and his partner Stevie Ray Vaughan left the band unwilling to sign a recording contract, with Dusty Hills and Frank Beard (US blues singer) following suit. Hill and Beard moved from Dallas to Houston in 1970, where the group was signed to London Records, the American label for British label Decca Records.\n\nAfter selling a few copies, Eliminator and Afterburner (1985) became the top charts of the charts. The group's 1976 world tour of Texas, with its iconic Texas stage adorned with cacti, snakes, longhorns, and cattle, was one of the most successful rock tours for decades."
