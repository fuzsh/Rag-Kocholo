        "text": "If you are not an Argonne National Laboratory employee, a user agreement signed by your home institution is a prerequisite for work at any of Argonne's user facilities. Argonneâ€™s User Facilities include:\n\nThe Advanced Photon Source (APS)\n\nThe Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM)\n\nThe Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF)\n\nThe Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS)\n\nThe Intermediate Voltage Electron Microscopy (IVEM) - Tandem Facility\n\nAtmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)\n\nSouthern Great Plains (SGP)\n\nBankhead National Forest (BNF)\n\nThe Department of Energy recently formulated master agreements that cover liability, intellectual property, and financial issues (access templates from the links in the left sidebar). The names of institutions with master agreements currently in place appear below.\n\nIf your institution does not appear in the list below*, complete an online User Agreement Questionnaire, which is the first step toward putting a master user agreement in place.\n\n* If there is a limited agreement covering participants from your institution for research at the specific facility you plan to use, it will be valid during the transition to a master agreement."
