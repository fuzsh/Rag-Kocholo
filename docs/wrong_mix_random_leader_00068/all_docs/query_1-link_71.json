        "text": "In my DECRA fellowship which started in mid 2021, I am aiming to fabricate multi-junction photodiode arrays for use in brain machine interfaces like retinal implants.\n\nBackground: Two of the main causes of vision loss, retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, are caused by a degeneration of photoreceptors in the retina, while the remaining visual pathway stays intact. By placing electrodes in the retina, it is possible to electrically stimulate the remaining intact neural tissue and restoring vision.\n\nThe School of Photovoltaic & Renewable Energy Engineering within the UNSW Faculty of Engineering has been at the leading edge of solar cell development for over 30 years, reporting many world record solar cell efficiencies. In a collaboration with the UNSW Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering we are now aiming to develop solar cells that can stimulate nervous tissue upon illumination and to fabricate arrays of small solar cells as prototypes for wireless retinal prostheses and other light powered brain machine interfaces."
