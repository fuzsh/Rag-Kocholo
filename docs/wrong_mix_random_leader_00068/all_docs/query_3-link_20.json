        "text": "Calculus, a branch of mathematics, was developed in the 17th century by two renowned mathematicians, Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The term âcalculusâ comes from Latin and means âsmall pebble used for counting.âÂ\n\nCalculus is the mathematical study of continuous change and is divided into two branches: differential calculus and integral calculus.Â\n\nDifferential calculus focuses on the concept of a derivative, which can be thought of as how a function changes as its input changes.Â\n\nIntegral calculus, on the other hand, involves the concept of an integral, which can be thought of as the area under a curve. Calculus plays a pivotal role in various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, computer science, and more. It helps us understand the changes between values that are related by a function.\n\nI.
