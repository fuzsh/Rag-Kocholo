        "text": "Description\n\nCharles John Huffam Dickens FRSA (/ˈdɪkɪnz/; 7 February 1812 – 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime and, by the 20th century, critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories are widely read today.\n\nDickens married Catherine Thomson Hogarth (1815–1879), they had ten children and separated in 1858. Catherine Dickens took one child with her when she left; her sister Georgina raised the rest. Catherine and Charles never saw one another again.\n\nWikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_...\n\nThis is a general description. It is not a review."
