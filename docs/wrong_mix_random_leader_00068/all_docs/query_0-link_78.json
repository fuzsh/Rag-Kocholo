Murnau's death in a car accident.\n\nThe Viking (1931), given its public release over three months after co-director Varick Frissell's death in an explosion, along with 26 other crew members, on board the SS Viking; the film, shot on location in Newfoundland by George Melford and Frissell in the winter of 1930-31, had been nominally completed and privately screened when Frissell decided it needed more sensational and realistic footage from the Labrador ice floes. Within days, Frissell and his crew re-joined the SS Viking (already used in the film) in order to shoot more footage; however, the ship quickly became trapped in ice about eight miles (13 km) off the Horse Islands. On March 15, 1931, a cache of dynamite loaded on the vessel, being used for Frissell's film to add to the sensationalism of giant explosions of icebergs, spontaneously blew up, destroying the back of the ship, blowing the stern off the vessel, and causing the Viking to catch fire and sink,[1][2][3] killing 27[4] members of the crew who were filming an iceberg, including Frissell and cinematographer Alexander Gustavus Penrod. The film as Frissell had left it was prepared for its posthumous release by associate producer Roy W. Gates. A French-language version of the film, Ceux du \"Viking\", shot simultaneously with the English-language version by French director René Ginet and also featuring Frissell's nature footage, was released in February 1932, 11 months after Frissell's death.\n\nAmbush (1950), released four months after Sam Wood's death from a heart attack.\n\nThe Lovers of Montparnasse (1958), released over a year after Max Ophüls's death from rheumatic heart disease, while shooting interiors on the film.

Hite's death in an automobile accident; Hite was on the way to his home in New Rochelle, New York, and was crossing the viaduct at 155th Street in Manhattan when his vehicle skidded off the roadway and onto the sidewalk, tore through an iron railing and plunged fifty feet before landing atop a wooden fence, with Hite underneath it, having suffered a fractured skull, a compound fracture to his jaw, and three broken ribs. After it took fifteen minutes to pull him from beneath it, Hite was taken to hospital, where he died that same night. Both the serial's production and the film studio Hite owned, Thanhouser, went into a long, slow decline following his death.\n\nThe Viking (1931), given its public release over three months after producer Varick Frissell's death in an explosion, along with 26 other crew members, on board the SS Viking; the film, shot on location in Newfoundland by co-directors George Melford and Frissell (Melford filming actors, Frissell filming nature) in the winter of 1930-31, had been nominally complete when Frissell screened it privately at the Nickel Theatre at St. John's on March 5, 1931, but the producer came away feeling it needed more sensational and realistic footage from the Labrador ice floes. Within days, Frissell and his crew re-joined the SS Viking (already used in the film) for its annual seal hunt to shoot more footage; however, the ship quickly became trapped in ice about eight miles (13 km) off the Horse Islands. On March 15, 1931, while trying to film an iceberg, Frissell, cinematographer Alexander Gustavus Penrod, and 25[4] other film crew members were killed when a cache of dynamite loaded on the vessel, being used for Frissell's film to add to the sensationalism of giant explosions of icebergs, spontaneously blew up, destroying the back of the ship, blowing the stern off the vessel, and causing the Viking to catch fire and sink.[1][2][3] The film that had been screened at the Nickel Theatre was subsequently polished and prepared for release by associate producer Roy W. Gates, who directed a prologue featuring Newfoundland explorer Sir Wilfred Grenfell, who had known and worked with Frissell, lionizing the producer and the men who had died with him. A French-language version of the film, Ceux du \"Viking\", shot simultaneously with Melford's English-language version by French director René Ginet and also produced by Frissell and featuring his nature footage, was released in February 1932, 11 months after Frissell's death.\n\nThe Naked City (1948), released over two months after producer and narrator Mark Hellinger's death from a sudden heart attack; after Hellinger's death, executives at Universal Studios were ready to scrap the film, as they had no idea how to market it, and feared it would be a box office failure. Hellinger's widow, however, reminded the studio that Hellinger's contract for the film included a \"guarantee of release\" clause from Universal; having no choice, Universal released the film into theaters, and were subsequently surprised when it became a hit, garnering two Oscars for the studio.\n\nApache Drums (1951), released less than a month after producer Val Lewton's death from two massive heart attacks, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.\n\nThe Happiest Millionaire (1967) and The Jungle Book (1967), both released a year after Walt Disney's death from lung cancer.\n\nMr. North (1988), released a year after John Huston's death.\n\nThe Witches (1990), released in the UK nine days after Jim Henson's death.\n\nThe City of Lost Souls (2000), Spirited Away (2001) and Koro's Big Walk (2002), all released in Japan after the death of chief executive producer Yasuyoshi Tokuma.\n\nThe Fog (2005) and World Trade Center (2006), both released after the death of producer Debra Hill.\n\nThe Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause (2006), Phat Girlz (2006) and Breach (2007), all released after the death of Robert Newmyer.\n\nStone of Destiny (2008), Edison and Leo (2008), The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009) and Push (2009) all released after the death of William Vince from cancer. Vince served as executive producer of the former two films and producer of the latter two.\n\nThe Reader (2008) and Margaret (2011), released after Anthony Minghella's death from a cancer-related hemorrhage and Sydney Pollack's death from cancer. In addition, Minghella also produced the short film, Love You More (2008).\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man (2012) and The Butler (2013), released after Laura Ziskin's death from breast cancer.\n\nStoker (2013), released after Tony Scott's suicide.\n\nThe Girl in the Photographs (2015) released a month after the death of Wes Craven, caused by brain caner.\n\nCreed (2015), released months after Robert Chartoff's death from pancreatic cancer.\n\nThe Legend of Tarzan (2016), to be released after Jerry Weintraub's death.\n\nFilms whose composer/lyricist died before the release[]\n\nBambi (1942), released three months after Frank Churchill's suicide.\n\nAirport (1970), released less than a month after Alfred Newman's death from complications of emphysema.\n\nTaxi Driver (1976) and Obsession (1976), both released after Bernard Herrmann's death in December 1975.\n\nFuneral Home (1980), released eight months after Jerry Fielding's death from a heart attack.\n\nBeauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992), both following lyricist Howard Ashman's death due to complications from AIDS.\n\nMan Trouble (1992) and Rich in Love (1993), both following Georges Delerue's death from a heart attack.\n\nLarger than Life (1996) and 'Til There Was You (1997), both following Miles Goodman's death from a heart attack.[10][11]\n\nAgainst the Ropes (2004) and First Daughter (2004) both released a year after Michael Kamen's death.\n\nVadakkumnathan (2006) and Kalabham (2006) both released a year after Raveendran's death.\n\nThe 33 (2015), and The Magnificent Seven (2016) both released after the death of composer James Horner in a plane crash; a third film, Southpaw (2015), went into wide release just over a month after Horner's death.\n\nFilms whose actor/actress died before the release[]\n\nIn several cases, actors or actresses have died prior to the release of a film: either during filming or after it has been completed, but is yet to be released. In the case that the actor dies during filming, their scenes are often completed by stunt doubles, or through special effects. Only people who actually appear in some capacity in a posthumously released film are listed here. Those who were scheduled to start a project, but died before filming began, are not included.\n\n1910s[]\n\nA Dash Through the Clouds (1912), released just twenty-three days after aviator and actor Philip Orin Parmelee's death in a plane crash; he was piloting an airplane at an air show in Yakima, Washington, on June 1, 1912, at altitudes variously described from 400 to 2,000 feet, when air turbulence flipped over his airplane and caused it to crash, killing him instantly.[12][13]\n\nA Woman's Way (1913), In the Haunts of Fear (1913), and The Blight (1913), all released after Joseph Graybill's death at the age of 26—strangely, different records state conflicting information as to the cause of Graybill's death; the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) lists it as acute spinal meningitis,[14] and the first death notice in the New York Times contradicts the death certificate as to the day of death—it lists the cause of death on August 2, not the 3, as a nervous breakdown [15]—but an obituary on August 4 lists the cause as gastritis.[16] Contradicting all of these, a 1913 Motion Picture Story magazine article states that he had a \"nervous disorder of the optic nerve and died\". Finally, Graybill's death certificate states that the cause of death was acute pachymeningitis and a contributory factor was alcohol poisoning; both the certificate and the first death notice note he entered Bellevue Hospital on July 24.[17]\n\nAcross the Border (1914), released over a month after Grace McHugh's death during filming; while on location on the Arkansas River in Colorado, re-shooting a scene of McHugh fording the river on horseback, her horse lost its footing, and the actress was thrown into the swift current. Cinematographer Owen Carter stopped filming and plunged into the river to save her; together they succeeded in reaching a sandbar, which unfortunately proved to be quicksand, and they both drowned. Shooting of the picture was otherwise complete, and the film was released with the majority of Grace McHugh's work intact.\n\nThe Great Romance (1919), Shadows of Suspicion (1919), and A Man of Honor (1919), all released after Harold Lockwood's death in the 1918 flu pandemic; because he died before filming on Shadows of Suspicion was completed, changes were made to the script, and the film was completed using a double shot from behind to stand in for Lockwood.\n\nThe Lone Star Ranger (1919), Wolves of the Night (1919), The Last of the Duanes (1919), and The Spite Bride (1919), all released after Lamar Johnstone's sudden death at age 34 from heart disease.\n\nPaid in Advance (1919), released six days after William Stowell's death in a train accident, while scouting locations for Universal in the Belgian Congo.\n\n1920s[]\n\nThe Skywayman (1920), released just over a month after daredevil stunt flier and actor Ormer Locklear's death on the last day of filming; while shooting the finale by night, Locklear had to dive the plane, carrying himself and co-pilot Milton 'Skeets' Elliott, towards some oil derricks and appear to crash it. He forewarned the lighting crew to douse their lights when he got near the derricks, so that he could see to pull out of the dive; the lights remained full on, blinding him, and he crashed. The finished film showed this crash, and its aftermath, in gruesome detail.\n\nEverybody's Sweetheart (1920), released less than a month after Olive Thomas's death, at the age of 25; on the night of September 5, 1920, Thomas and her husband, Jack Pickford, went out for a night of entertainment and partying at the famous bistros in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris. Returning to their room in the Hotel Ritz around 3:00 a.m., Pickford either fell asleep or was outside the room for a final round of drugs. An intoxicated and tired Thomas accidentally ingested a large dose of a mercury bichloride liquid solution, which had been prescribed for her husband's chronic syphilis. Being liquid it was supposed to be applied topically, not ingested.[18] She had either thought the flask contained drinking water or sleeping pills; accounts vary. The label was in French, which may have added to the confusion. She screamed, \"Oh, my God!\", and Pickford ran to pick her up in his arms; however, it was too late, as she had already ingested a lethal dose.[19] She was taken to the American Hospital in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, where she succumbed to the poison a few days later.\n\nCoincidence (1921), released a year after Robert Harron's suicide; he fatally shot himself in the left lung with a revolver due to disappointment that director and mentor D.W. Griffith had passed him over for the starring role in Way Down East.\n\nFoolish Wives (1922), released almost a year after Rudolph Christians's death from pneumonia; the German actor, father of Austrian stage and screen actress Mady Christians, was playing the central part of the cuckolded American envoy in Erich von Stroheim's film. As Christians died in the middle of production, von Stroheim was forced to bring in actor Robert Edeson (back to camera) to finish Christians's scenes.\n\nWildness of Youth (1922), released nearly two months after child star Bobby Connelly's death from bronchitis, brought on by a years-long battle with endocarditis and worsened by a heavy work schedule; Connelly was 13 years old.[20]\n\nThe Warrens of Virginia (1924), almost a year after actress Martha Mansfield's death at the age of 24; on November 30, 1923, while working on the film on location in San Antonio, Texas, Mansfield was severely burned when a match, tossed by a cast member, ignited her Civil War costume of hoopskirts and flimsy ruffles. Mansfield was playing the role of Agatha Warren and had just finished her scenes and retired to a car when her clothing burst into flames. Her neck and face were saved when leading man Wilfred Lytell threw his heavy overcoat over her. The chauffeur of Mansfield's car was burned badly on his hands while trying to remove the burning clothing from the actress. The fire was put out, but she sustained substantial burns to her body. She was rushed to a Physicians and Surgeons Hospital in San Antonio, where she died in less than twenty-four hours; however, most of Mansfield's scenes had already been shot, so production on the film continued.\n\nGreed (1924), released nearly a year after Frank Hayes's death from pneumonia.\n\nSon of the Sheik (1926), was publicly released a month following Rudolph Valentino's death from peritonitis, although the premiere was a month prior to Valentino's death.\n\nKing of the Pack (1926), released nearly four months after canine actor Peter the Great's death while protecting his master; an argument had broken out between owner Edward Faust and a friend of Faust's, culminating with Faust running back to his car while the friend came out of his house with a rifle—in the process, Peter leapt up to protect his master, and was shot in the neck, lingering for three more days before dying.\n\nTwo Masters (1928), released nearly a month after Rex Cherryman's death from septic poisoning, which he contracted while sailing to France to read for a play in Paris; he died in Le Havre, France at age 31.\n\nThe Rush Hour (1928), released almost five months after Ward Crane's death from pneumonia, following an attack of pleurisy that sent him to a rest cure lodge at Saranac Lake, New York.\n\nThe Wedding March (1928), released a year after the deaths of both George Nichols and Hughie Mack.\n\nShow Boat (1929), released over three months after Ralph Yearsley's suicide.\n\nThe Hottentot (1929), The Argyle Case (1929), and The Drake Case (1929), all released after Gladys Brockwell's death in an automobile accident; the car, driven by her friend Thomas Brennan, went over an 75-foot (23 m) embankment on the Ventura Highway near Calabasas, and Brockwell, the passenger, ended up crushed beneath it. Brennan later said that a bit of dust had blown into his eye before the accident, temporarily blinding him. Seriously injured, Brockwell died a few days later in a Hollywood hospital from peritonitis; Brennan eventually recovered from his own injuries.\n\n1930s[]\n\nThe Sea Wolf (1930), released six days after Milton Sills's death from a heart attack, while playing tennis with his wife at his Santa Barbara, California home.\n\nThe Miracle Man (1932), less than five months after Tyrone Power, Sr.'s death. Power was in the midst of filming the title role in a remake of the 1919 film, but collapsed and died of a heart attack in the arms of his son, Tyrone Power, Jr., while on the set; Power's part was taken up by Hobart Bosworth, but his work was not refilmed.\n\nThirteen Women (1932), released the night of Peg Entwistle's suicide by jumping off the Hollywood Sign.\n\nI Cover the Waterfront (1933), released just six days after Ernest Torrence's death following gall bladder surgery; while en route to Europe by ship, Torrence suffered an acute attack of gall stones, but after being rushed back to a New York hospital, he died of complications following surgery.\n\nShoot the Works (1934), released just over a month after Lew Cody's death from heart disease and Dorothy Dell's death in a car accident.\n\nWake Up and Dream (1934), released just over a month after Russ Columbo's death in a shooting accident; the singer was shot under peculiar circumstances by his longtime friend, photographer Lansing Brown, while Columbo was visiting him at home. Brown had a collection of firearms and the two men were examining various pieces. Quoting Brown's description of the accident,[21] \"I was absent-mindedly fooling around with one of the guns. [...] I had a match in my hand and when I clicked, apparently the match caught in between the hammer and the firing pin. There was an explosion. Russ slid to the side of his chair.\" The ball ricocheted off a nearby table and hit Columbo above the left eye. Surgeons at Good Samaritan Hospital made an unsuccessful attempt to remove the ball from Columbo's brain; he died less than six hours after the shooting.[22][23] Columbo's death was ruled an accident, and Brown exonerated from blame.[24][25]\n\nJew Suss (1934), released six months after Gerald du Maurier's death from colon cancer.\n\nSteamboat Round the Bend (1935) and In Old Kentucky (1935), both released months after Will Rogers's death in an airplane crash; while being flown through Alaska by famed aviator Wiley Post, they became uncertain of their position in bad weather and landed in a lagoon to ask directions. On takeoff, the engine failed at low altitude, and the aircraft, uncontrollably nose-heavy at low speed, plunged into the lagoon, shearing off the right wing and ending inverted in the shallow water of the lagoon; both men died instantly.\n\nFrankie and Johnnie (1936), released over two years after Lilyan Tashman's death from abdominal cancer.\n\nCounterfeit (1936) and Poppy (1936), both released just two months after character actor Tammany Young's death from a heart attack.\n\nThe Devil-Doll (1936), released almost a month after Henry B. Walthall's death from influenza and a nervous condition.\n\nSaratoga (1937), following Jean Harlow's death, with 90% of filming completed; a body double and two voice doubles completed the filming in Harlow's role.[26]\n\nRikas tyttö (1939), released less than two months after Finnish actress Sirkka Sari's death; Sari played the lead role in the film. At a party with the rest of the cast and crew, while shooting at the Aulanko Hotel, Sari and one of the men there (she was engaged, but the man was not her fiancee) went up to the roof of the hotel; on the flat roof, there was a several-feet high chimney, with a ladder leading up to the top. Sari mistook this chimney for a scenery balcony, climbed up, and fell into a heating boiler, where she died instantly. Because of Sari's death, the end of the film needed to be changed a bit; the crew shot further away, and so another woman had to replace Sari on these final shots. It was only Sari's third film; she was 19 years old.\n\n1940s[]\n\nThe Masked Marvel (1943), released two months after David Bacon's mysterious death; he was seen driving a car erratically in Santa Monica, California before running off the road and into the curb. Several witnesses saw him climb out of the car and stagger briefly before collapsing. As they approached, he asked them to help him, but he died before he could say anything more. A small knife wound was found in his back – the blade had punctured his lung and caused his death. When he died, Bacon was wearing only a swimsuit, and a wallet and camera were found in his car. The film from the camera was developed and found to contain only one image, that of Bacon, nude and smiling on a beach.\n\nCaptain America (1944), whose later segments arrived at theatres following Dick Purcell's death from a heart attack, just a few weeks after shooting had wrapped.\n\nHangover Square (1945), two months after Laird Cregar's death, due to complications from stomach surgery following a crash diet that included prescribed amphetamines.\n\nHaving A Wonderful Crime (1945), released nine months after Mildred Harris's death from pneumonia.\n\nHouse of Horrors (1946) and The Brute Man (1946), both released after Rondo Hatton's death from a heart attack, due to his acromegaly.\n\nLost City of the Jungle (1946), following Lionel Atwill's death, from pneumonia caused by poor health due to lung cancer, while filming this serial; Atwill was playing the mastermind villain, Sir Eric Hazarias, a chief foreign spy. Universal could not afford to throw out the footage already filmed, so they were forced to adapt the serial: Firstly, another villain (Malborn, played by John Mylong, who was originally just a servant of Sir Eric) was introduced as the boss of Atwill's character to take over most of the villain requirements of the film; secondly, a double of Atwill was used to complete his remaining scenes. The double was filmed from behind and remained silent. The villain's henchmen were filmed repeating their orders back to the silent double and stock footage of Atwill was edited in to show a response.\n\nThe Naked City (1948), released over two months after producer and narrator Mark Hellinger's death from a sudden heart attack; after Hellinger's death, executives at Universal Studios were ready to scrap the film, as they had no idea how to market it, and feared it would be a box office failure. Hellinger's widow, however, reminded the studio that Hellinger's contract for the film included a \"guarantee of release\" clause from Universal; having no choice, Universal released the film into theaters, and were subsequently surprised when it became a hit, garnering two Oscars for the studio.\n\nNoose (1948) and Brass Monkey (1948), both released after Carole Landis's suicide; Landis was reportedly crushed when her lover, actor Rex Harrison, refused to divorce his wife, Lilli Palmer, for her. Unable to cope any longer, she committed suicide at her Pacific Palisades home by taking an overdose of Seconal.[27][28] She had spent her final night alive with Harrison; the next afternoon, he and the maid discovered her on the bathroom floor. Harrison waited several hours before he called a doctor and the police.[29] According to some sources, Landis left two suicide notes; one for her mother, and the second for Harrison, who instructed his lawyers to destroy it.[30] During a coroner's inquest, Harrison denied knowing any motive for her suicide and told the coroner he did not know of the existence of a second suicide note.[31]\n\nRed River (1948) and So Dear to My Heart (1949), both released after Harry Carey's death from a combination of lung cancer, emphysema, and coronary thrombosis in 1947; both films had been delayed due to lengthy post-production problems, including the addition of several animated sequences to the latter, a Disney film.\n\n1950s[]\n\nThe Furies (1950), released four months after Walter Huston's death from an aortic aneurysm.\n\nAlice in Wonderland (1951), released over a year after Dink Trout's death and released two months after Larry Grey's death. Dink voiced the King of Hearts. Larry voiced Bill the Lizard and a card painter.\n\nMy Son John (1952), eight months after Robert Walker's death, from an allergic reaction to sodium amytal given to him by his psychiatrist. Because Walker died in the middle of production, parts of the film were heavily rewritten; several scenes use a double shot from behind, and others recycle footage of Walker from Strangers on a Train. The final scene, where a recording of John delivers an anti-Communist speech, is lit with a halo around the tape-recorder.\n\nJudgement of God (1952), released five months after French actor Pierre Renoir's death, due to complications from a kidney operation.\n\nRebel Without a Cause (1955) and Giant (1956), both following actor James Dean's death in an automobile accident in September 1955, just days after filming on the latter was completed; due to his trademark mumbling rendering him inaudible on his final scene of the film, his speech in that scene was overdubbed by friend Nick Adams after his death. Dean received a posthumous Best Actor Oscar nomination for his work on Giant.\n\nThe Vagabond King (1956), released a year after Walter Hampden's death from a stroke.\n\nAround the World in 80 Days (1956), released almost seven months after Robert Newton's death from a heart attack, brought on by chronic alcoholism.\n\nBop Girl Goes Calypso (1957) and Jailhouse Rock (1957), both released after Judy Tyler's sudden death in a car accident, alongside her husband.\n\nThe 30 Foot Bride of Candy Rock (1959) and The World of Abbott and Costello (1965), both released after Lou Costello's death.\n\nPlan 9 from Outer Space (1959), following Bela Lugosi's death. He died having filmed two minutes of footage.[26] This footage, not shot for Plan 9, but for two separate, unfinished Ed Wood projects, was combined and then inter-cut with new footage featuring a double, Tom Mason, who looked nothing like Lugosi, in order to put a credit for Lugosi on the picture.[26]\n\nLa Fièvre Monte à El Pao (1959), released ten days after French actor Gérard Philipe's death from liver cancer, at age 36.\n\nSolomon and Sheba (1959), following Tyrone Power's death of a sudden heart attack; having completed 75% of the required shooting, Power's death forced the production to recast the role with Yul Brynner and reshoot most of Power's scenes. Footage of Power, however, was retained for long shots, such as in the sword fighting sequence toward the end of the film, and reels featuring the rest of Power's performance are rumored to be kept locked away in vaults to this day.\n\n1960s[]\n\nThe Misfits (1961), released on what would have been actor Clark Gable's 60th birthday; he had died three months earlier of a heart attack, brought on in part, according to later reports, by the stress of difficulties working with co-star Marilyn Monroe.\n\nAdvise & Consent (1962), where, appearing in two scenes as Senator McCafferty, who whenever awakened from a deep sleep automatically responds \"Opposed, sir! Opposed!\", was 87-year-old Henry F. Ashurst, one of the first senators elected by the state of Arizona and served five terms. Ashurst died on May 31, 1962, a week before the film's premiere.\n\nFrom Russia with Love (1963). released nearly four months after Pedro Armendáriz's suicide, following a long development of cancer that turned terminal during filming.\n\nThe Thrill of It All (1963) and It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), both following Zasu Pitts's death from cancer.\n\nThe Incredible Mr. Limpet (1964), released nearly five months after Larry Keating's death from leukemia.\n\nA Tiger Walks (1964), released just over three months after Sabu Dastagir's sudden death from a heart attack; he was only 39.\n\nThe Carpetbaggers (1964), released about ten weeks after Alan Ladd's death.\n\nMuscle Beach Party (1964) and The Patsy (1964), both released after Peter Lorre's death from a stroke.\n\nThe Pumpkin Eater (1964), released three months after Cedric Hardwicke's death from emphysema.\n\nCat Ballou (1965), released four months after Nat King Cole's death from lung cancer.\n\nFluffy (1965), released eight months after Sammee Tong's death.\n\nUncle Tom's Cabin (1965), released in West Germany two months after John Kitzmiller's death.\n\nThe Glass Bottom Boat (1966), released three months after Alice Pearce's death from ovarian cancer.\n\nThe Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming (1966) and Incubus (1966), both released after Milos Milos's suicide in January 1966; the latter film was released just twelve days after Milos's co-star, Ann Atmar, also committed suicide.\n\nA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1966), following Buster Keaton's death from lung cancer.\n\nManos: The Hands of Fate (1966), released a month after John Reynolds's suicide; it was the only film appearance of Reynolds, who played the infamous character Torgo in the film.\n\nThe Defector (1966), released in the USA nearly four months after Montgomery Clift's death from a heart attack.\n\nCasino Royale (1967), released less than a month after Duncan Macrae's death.\n\nThe Gnome-Mobile (1967), released over a year after Ed Wynn's death from throat cancer.\n\nThe Tiger Makes Out (1967), released about six months after Roland Wood's death.\n\nThe Jungle Book (1967), released over ten months after Verna Felton's death from a stroke; Felton had voiced Colonel Hathi's wife, Winifred the elephant, in the film. (Note: The film's producer, Walt Disney, died the day after Felton.)\n\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), released six months after Spencer Tracy's death from a heart attack and emphysema. Tracy died only seventeen days after filming wrapped, and was in failing health during the shoot — the filming schedule was altered to accommodate him.[32] All of Tracy's scenes were filmed between 9:00 AM and noon of each day in order to give him adequate time to rest.[33] For example, most of Tracy's dialogue scenes were filmed in a such a way that during close-ups on other characters, a stand-in was substituted for him.[34] Tracy posthumously received his ninth Oscar nomination for his work on the film.[35]\n\nThe Young Girls of Rochefort (1967) and Billion Dollar Brain (1967), both released after Françoise Dorléac's death at the age of 25; the older sister of French actress Catherine Deneuve died when she lost control of the rented Renault 10 she was driving and hit a sign post ten kilometers from Nice at the end of the Esterel-Côte d'Azur motorway. The car flipped over, and burst into flames. Dorléac had been en route to Nice airport and was afraid of missing her flight. She was seen struggling to get out of the car, but was unable to open the door; police later identified her body only from the fragment of a cheque book, a diary, and her driving license.\n\nNever a Dull Moment (1968), released a year after Philip Coolidge's death.\n\nThe Bamboo Saucer (1968), released four months after Dan Duryea's death from cancer.\n\nSkidoo (1968), released about four months following Phil Arnold's death from a heart attack; another cast member, Fred Clark, died only two weeks prior to the film's release.\n\nThe Night They Raided Minsky's (1968), over a year after noted comic actor Bert Lahr's death from pneumonia and undiagnosed terminal cancer; while working on the film, Lahr agreed to shoot an extensive night scene outdoors in New York City on a cold December night, causing him to develop the pneumonia that killed him. Due to his death occurring in the middle of production, his role was posthumously made smaller, and what footage needed to be reshot for scenes where Lahr had completed his close-ups employed burlesque legend Joey Faye, shot from behind, to fill in for Lahr.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West (1968), released seven months after Al Mulock's suicide; Mulock, a noted Canadian character actor, played the gunslinger Knuckles in the opening sequence. This sequence, the last filmed in Spain on the production, was scheduled for four days; Mulock committed suicide after the third day's shooting, for reasons that are still unclear, by jumping from his hotel room window, several floors up, in full costume. Production manager Claudio Mancini and screenwriter Mickey Knox, who were sitting in a room in the hotel, witnessed Mulock's body pass by their window. Knox recalled in an interview that while Mancini put Mulock, still in his costume, in his car to drive him to the hospital, director Sergio Leone said to Mancini, \"Get the costume! We need the costume!\" As Mulock had already shot most of his close-ups and a few medium and wide shots, only a double, of similar height and build, was needed to complete the sequence; looking similar enough to pass, screenwriter Knox was drafted into taking Mulock's place for those shots.[36] Mulock's absence is obvious in the last few minutes of the sequence; while the other two gunslingers, played by Woody Strode and Jack Elam, get close-up reaction shots to Charles Bronson's character, Knuckles gets none before he is shot to death.\n\nThe Wild Bunch (1969), released over a year after Albert Dekker's death by autoerotic asphyxiation; Dekker had played Pat Harrigan, the unscrupulous railroad detective, in the film.\n\nThe Thirteen Chairs (1969), following Sharon Tate's death; it was her last film before her murder.\n\nThe Reivers (1969) and The Pursuit of Happiness (1971), both following Ruth White's death from cancer.\n\n1970s[]\n\nStant Toons:the Motion Picture (1970), released nine months after Judy Garland's death from a Drug Overdose. the 6/22 Funeral caused the movie to move the date to March 1970.\n\nPatton (1970), released nearly three months after James Edwards's death from a heart attack.\n\nRabbit, Run (1970), released five months after Nydia Westman's death from cancer.\n\nCold Turkey (1971), released almost five months following Edward Everett Horton's death.\n\nWho Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?

Because Shaw was so ill during filming, his voice and delivery were subsequently very weak and shaky. After his death, his voice was dubbed by actor Robert Rietty, although impressionist Rich Little also dubbed three words near the end of the picture (\"Harry, come on\"), and six words in Shaw's own voice were deemed usable (\"Too hot in that train\" and \"Harry\").\n\nThe Muppet Movie (1979) released nine months after Edgar Bergen's death from kidney disease; he had died during the film’s production, after filming his scenes.\n\n1980s[]\n\nBrubaker (1980), released just under a year after Richard Ward's death from a heart ailment.\n\nThe Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu (1980), released less than a month after Peter Sellers's death from a heart attack.
