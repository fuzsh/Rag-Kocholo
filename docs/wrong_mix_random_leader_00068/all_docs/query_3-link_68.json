The origins of digit span as a psychological construct date back to the work of Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716). Leibniz suggested that individuals have a finite capacity to prospectively process or hold in mind the information from the environment. He termed this capacity the span of apperception (see JTE Richardson’s paper: Measurements of short-term memory: A historical review.
