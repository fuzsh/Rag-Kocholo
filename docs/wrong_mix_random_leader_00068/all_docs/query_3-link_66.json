This document discusses different philosophers' views on the phenomenology of death. It begins by explaining Epicurus' view that death should not be feared because when it comes, one no longer exists. It then discusses why people fear death, noting it usually connotes suffering, pain, and the loss of life and relationships. The document also discusses Heidegger's view that death is a way of being that humans always have as a possibility, and that confronting one's own mortality is essential to achieving authentic existence. In the end, it concludes that while death is inevitable and uncertain, how we choose to live our lives takes on added importance and meaning given our finite time in the world.",
