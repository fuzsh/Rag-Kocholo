        "text": "It's About More Than Just Math: Fear, Growth, and Adaptation\n\nMath anxiety â a fear of getting math concepts and problems wrong and the resulting avoidance of math because of that â is something Iâve seen many times over my life and not just in children. Itâs just as prevalent in adults and, believe it or not, despite my PhD in math, I experienced math anxiety as a child, too. While some children allowed their math anxiety to grow into a lifelong avoidance of math, mine fueled my competitive spirit and led me to push ahead of my peers, learning advanced math concepts even when I wasnât able to get into the advanced math classes my middle school offered.\n\nWhat Parents Need to Know About Math Curriculum in Algebra and Beyond\n\nAt the end of the day, algebra comes down to these three steps: define, recognize and produce. No matter if your child is in middle school or a PhD math program, itâs all about defining (can you understand it?), recognizing (can you identify it?), and producing (can you use it to produce results or new research?). If you can help your child with these three aspects of algebra at home, theyâll be better set up for success in the classroom and in the future.\n\nLater Elementary Math Concepts and Strategies: What Parents Need to Know for Grades 3-6\n\nMost students learn to multiply in school by memorizing their multiplication tables. Thereâs nothing wrong with memorizing multiplication tables, but a child must know what the multiplication tables mean. If theyâre multiplying seven by six, they need to have that picture in the back of their head of six groups of seven or seven groups of six. If not, they donât have a true understanding of what multiplication actually is and it wonât serve them later on in life. Take, for example, a child who knows that five times four is 20. She can solve the multiplication problem with ease.\n\nHow to Gamify Your Math Lessons\n\nMaking math fun for your child within the confines of your everyday world is easy. Letâs say youâre walking down the sidewalk with your child and they say, âOh, thereâs a train.â Thatâs an opportunity for you to ask how many train cars they can see. How many engines are on the train? Even if itâs just their toys sitting out on the floor, you could ask them, âCan you give me three toy dogs right now?â Then your child has to identify whatâs a dog, whatâs not a dog and how many of them equal three. Take whatever your child can identify and formulate a math lesson thatâs on their level.\n\n5 Common Math App Pitfalls â and How Elephant Learning Is Different\n\nMany math apps are parent-free zones or, at best, parents are an afterthought within the app. Elephant Learning knows that the best results come when the parent is involved in the childâs education. Every study shows outcomes for students are better when parents are involved. The truth is, when I started this company, my first child was on his way. I created this system as a tool to ensure that he receives the benefits of mathematics education and avoids the American educational pitfall. We live in a time when, increasingly, if you are not the person creating the automation, you are the person being replaced by it. Our reports detail exactly how we intend to teach each topic down to the milestone level with advice on how you can further learning with fun games outside of the system. This turns your childâs playtime in the system into a tool to succeed in playtime with you. We provide advice on how to work with the students on mistakes so that the pressure is always off. At any point in time, if your student is struggling, we are always happy to look at the data and advise. That is why Elephant Learning can guarantee results. The math app you choose for your childâs learning matters. Apps that focus on games and graphics with math sprinkled throughout may end up turning those math problems into perceived work for your child (and can become addictive). Elephant Learning begins with a proven curriculum and scientific understanding of how children learn math. We then build games and puzzles around the curriculum, empowering students to truly grasp math concepts. Knowing that parental involvement is key to student success, we also ensure that you, the parent, are involved every step of the way.\n\nWhy Your Child Is Behind in Math (Yes, Even Your Child)\n\nElephant Learning accurately tests and evaluates kids at different grade levels to see if they truly get what they should be learning. It then adjusts what theyâre learning to ensure they understand math conceptually right from the start. The app provides educational games for the kids while also providing parents with reports and information on how the app is actually teaching a concept. Parents will find games to play with their children outside of the app that further support learning. We break it down for you, telling you how to help your child along every step of the way and showing you how to identify your childâs misunderstandings simply. For instance, rather than correcting them or showing them how to do the math problem correctly, ask them why they think theyâre correct; youâre going to see what they misunderstand nearly immediately and be able to give them a hint on how to overcome it. This way, Elephant Learning is empowering to the student, but itâs also empowering to the parent. You no longer have to be afraid to take your childâs math education into your own hands.\n\nAnswers to Your Top Questions About Math Anxiety\n\nMake no mistake. Math anxiety can and does affect the course of your life. The wife of a friend said to me, \"I wanted to get a degree in physics, but it was all differential equations, so I became an English major.\" When she was a child, that's what she wanted to do; she wanted to be a physicist, but she gave that up because of math anxiety. The reality is, thereâs no such thing as a ânot a math person.â Whether itâs you or your child, those who arenât confident with mathematics are typically individuals who have math anxiety. Regardless of how much math anxiety exists in your household, remember: there is a solution.\n\nRestoring the American Dream\n\nWe tell our children in the United States that they can grow up to be whatever they want. It is the quintessential American dream and why thousands if not millions of people want to move to our country. Find out why the dream is over before students even have a chance. It is all due to a gap between parent's understanding of what counting to 10 is versus what kindergarten means by counting to 10."
