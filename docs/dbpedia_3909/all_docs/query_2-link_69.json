The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 2128, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Luis V. Gutierrez [chairman of the subcommittee] presiding. Members present: Representatives Gutierrez, Maloney, Watt, Moore of Kansas, Waters, Hinojosa, McCarthy of New York, Baca, Green, Scott, Cleaver, Ellison, Klein, Foster, Speier; Hensarling, Royce, Capito, Garrett, Neugebauer, Price, Marchant, Lee, Paulsen, and Lance. Also present: Representatives Kilroy, Manzullo, and Cohen. Chairman Gutierrez. This hearing of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit will come to order. Good morning and thanks to all of the witnesses for agreeing to appear before the subcommittee today. Today's hearing will examine the impact that the use of credit reports and information has on consumers outside of the traditional use for lending and credit purposes. We will examine the use of credit-based insurance scores, where the medical debt is predictive of a person's chances of defaulting, and finally, whether or not a consumer's credit information should be used to determine their employability. We will be limiting opening statements to 10 minutes per side, but without objection, all members' opening statements will be made a part of the record. We may have members who wish to attend but do not sit on the subcommittee. As they join us, I will offer an unanimous consent motion for each to sit with the subcommittee and for them to ask questions when time allows. I yield myself 5 minutes for my opening statement. This morning's hearing is about the use of credit information in areas such as insurance underwriting and employment purposes. We will hear about important yet complex and often opaque processes concerning credit board insurance and insurance scores in the first panel. In the second panel, we will hear about issues that are equally important to a vast number of consumers--the little known or understood use of credit information for hiring and even firing decisions, and the effect medical debt has on one's consumer report, even after you paid the medical debt off. When legislators or regulators attempt to fully grasp an issue such as credit-based insurance scores, they see a complex system laden with ever-changing computer applications and models, but it is precisely this complexity that should make us here in Congress delve further into an issue that affects every single American who owns or rents a house, a car, has insurance, has a job or is looking for a job, or is likely to incur medical debt. Do most consumers know that their car or homeowner's insurance rates may go up due to their credit score? Do they know that if one of their medical bills goes to a collection agency and they pay it in full and settle it, it will still affect their credit report for up to 7 years? Do people realize that even in these tough economic times, pre-employment consumer credit checks are increasingly widespread, trapping many people in the cycle of debt that makes it harder for them to pay off their debts and harder for them to get the job that would allow them to pay off the debt? I wonder--when you go to State Farm or Allstate or GEICO to get your insurance and they have a credit score, and that credit score was negative, so they are going to charge you more for your insurance, do they send you a note in the mail telling you that you are going to pay more for that insurance? I think these are all very important questions that the American public should know. Indeed, the current system facilitates the denial of employment to those who have bad debt, even though bad debt oftentimes results from the denial of employment, a vicious cycle. You cannot get a job, so you get a bad credit score. You have a bad credit score, so you cannot get a job. I wonder who is most likely to be affected, especially in these economic times. What? Extend unemployment compensation? What about the national debt? I have a way maybe we could settle unemployment compensation, how about letting somebody get a job and prove who they are without some mysterious number coming out of a black box somewhere where nobody knows about it. That is why the subcommittee is holding this hearing, the second so far this year on the issue of credit reports, credit scores, and their impact on consumers. We will look at reports and studies about the predictive nature of insurance scores and traditional scores among other things. As we do so, we also need to look at the basic guiding principles of equity, fairness and transparency. Some have contended that there is no disparate treatment of minorities in credit-based insurance scores. Some will say that even if there is a disparate impact on some groups, the system still does not need to be changed. The question of how predictive a credit-based insurance score is on an insured's likelihood to file a claim is important, as it is the predictive value of traditional credit scores used for credit granting. As long as there continue to be disparities in the outcomes of the current system for racial and ethnic groups and along class and geographical lines, I believe the system needs strenuous oversight and may need fundamental change. How to correct the disparities in the system with this disproportionately negative impact on minorities and low-income groups while maintaining the core framework of credit information as a risk management tool is a challenge we should take on. For example, on issues like the use of credit information for developing insurance pricing and the inclusion of medical debt collection in determining a consumer's risk of default, I have doubts as to whether there are biased uses of data. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Brookings Institution, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Texas Department of Insurance have all found that racial disparities between African Americans, Latinos and Whites in credit scores exist, and we will see this has wide ranging implications beyond simply obtaining consumer credit. Defending a system where decisions such as determining car insurance rates or even something as vital as to whether or not to hire someone is based on something that has shown to possess a degree of bias is difficult, to say the least. I welcome the testimony this morning of those who believe the system works, and of those who believe the system needs to be changed to work in a more equitable, fair, and transparent fashion. In the same spirit of transparency, I am making it clear at the outset that I side with the latter group. I do not think you need any sort of score to predict that, from my point of view. In order to persuade this committee not to move forward on legislation that would strongly limit what we believe to be unfair practices, the industry witnesses before us must prove to me that not only are the practices we call into question scientifically predictive, but more importantly, they are fair and equitable to all Americans. The ranking member, Mr. Hensarling, is recognized. Mr. Hensarling. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for calling this hearing. As we all know, last week we were greeted with more bad economic news in our Nation as unemployment ticked up yet again to 9.9 percent. Again, unemployment remains mired at a generational high. Since the President asked for and the Congress passed the stimulus bill, approximately 3 million of our fellow countrymen have now lost their jobs. There are countless stories of hardship, and countless stories of suffering. We know that the underemployment rate hovers around 17 to 18 percent of our country. By any historical standard, we should already be out of this recession. We should have robust GDP growth. We should have robust employment growth. Unfortunately, we do not. I believe, as do many, that the reckless spending, the enormous debt and deficit that has been brought up on us by this Congress, by this Administration, the serial bailouts, the government takeovers, and legislation passed that ultimately restricts access to credit have all contributed to the fact that we are still mired at almost double digit unemployment. I believe the Administration and Congress are holding back our economic recovery, an economy that wants to recover. Economies work on reverse gravity. What goes down must come up Yet, this recovery has been the most tepid and languishing recovery in the modern economic era. I did not even mention the impact of the high cost of the new health care bill and the threat of a national energy tax. As I talk to small business people in the 5th Congressional District of Texas, as I talk to investors, as I talk to bankers, as I talk to Fortune 500 CEOs, I hear the same message over and over, and that is, ``I am not willing to expand my business and create more jobs today. I do not know what the health care costs are going to be for my employees. I do not know what the energy costs might be associated with cap and trade. I do not know what my tax bill is going to be as tax relief expires at year's end, and I do not know how my Nation is going to pay for all of this debt.'' More taxes. More inflation. Given this backdrop, I would hope that any legislation that this subcommittee or full committee considers, that we would consider jobs to be job number one for our committees. I feel we are considering at least three more policy ideas that are going to further harm job creation in America by restricting access to credit. All of the ideas before us are either going to prohibit accurate data from going into a credit file or prohibit the use of accurate data that may be in a credit file. To many of us, this all has the distinct odor of government censorship and even the faint whiff of Orwellian thought control. The bottom line is, thinner credit files are going to erode risk-based pricing of these products, which in turn is going to lead to less available credit and more expensive credit, at a time again when our Nation is mired in almost double digit unemployment. Should credit scores be used in insurance underwriting? Are they predictive? I have seen a number of studies that claim they are but most importantly, I suppose those who are using them find them to be predictive. I believe they have an incentive to get it right. Otherwise, they would ultimately lose money and they would have to fold up shop. Those who get it wrong ultimately go out of business. Maybe one insurance company feels those who wear blue ties are riskier than those who do not. I do not know. I do not know if that is predictive. It is not logical, but maybe it is. One company may decide to use it and another one may choose not to use it. Information about discharged medical bills. There are a lot of setbacks that one can have in their life that ultimately impact their credit: divorce; unemployment; a medical bill. At the same time, are they predictive? If they are predictive, if we do not allow that information in, ultimately small businesses, many of which are organized as sole proprietorships-- Chairman Gutierrez. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Hensarling. In that case, Mr. Chairman, I will stop there. Chairman Gutierrez. I am going to ask unanimous consent that Ms. Kilroy be allowed to sit in this hearing, and grant her 2 minutes for an opening statement. Hearing no objection, it is so ordered. Ms. Kilroy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your leadership in this important issue. I thank the witnesses for their time here today. I am interested in what you have to say, particularly about medical debt and the impact it has on the credit scores for millions of Americans, and their ability to get an affordable home loan or car loan, long after they have paid their medical debt. I ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter written to me from my constituent, Julia Mueller of Columbus, Ohio. She is a responsible young adult, a college student. She pays her credit cards on time. She purchased health insurance. She checked with them before she was going to have an expensive procedure to see if it would be covered. She was assured it was. That was her understanding until the bills came and her insurance company denied coverage. She ended up in a year-long dispute with them on that. It was eventually resolved, but it destroyed her credit score. Now, she is worried about her ability after college to buy a car, and to buy a house. I worry it might even affect her ability to get a job. I introduced the Medical Debt Relief Act to help hard- working Americans like Julia who play by the rules, pay or settle their medical debts, yet find their credit scores adversely affected for years to come. Today, we are taking an important step in the right direction to deal with this important issue. I want to tell Julia when she writes to me that, ``I am fiscally responsible and I would like to be treated that way,'' and that is what we are aiming to do here today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back my time. Chairman Gutierrez. The gentlelady yields back the balance of her time. Mr. Price of Georgia is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. Price. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, if the past 2 years have taught us anything, it is that risk is unavoidable and ever present. In order for the economy to work, businesses must be able to price their products for the risk that they incur. Risk- based pricing is especially important when trying to determine the reliability of the insured and the exposure of job creators. Credit-based insurance scores have proven to be the most predictive factor in determining the likelihood of a consumer filing a claim. This risk model enables insurers to more accurately underwrite and price for risk, and when this is done well, everyone wins. Democrats want you to believe that everyone should not be judged by their past actions. However, it is the American way to pull one's self up by working hard and making responsible decisions. What makes risk-based pricing and insurance scores important is the ability for people to improve their scores and lower their rates by paying their bills on time and taking responsibility for their financial decisions. What would happen if there was no risk pricing? Everyone would get the same price regardless of how much an insurer has to pay to cover a claim. This would result in significant and dramatic increases in rates to virtually all Americans, less credit available, more expensive credit, and more job destruction. This is clearly not the most wise avenue. I look forward to the testimony and hopefully our response in wisdom. I yield back. Chairman Gutierrez. Mr. Green is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the witnesses for appearing. Mr. Chairman, I am concerned about credit-based insurance scores, especially as they relate to employment. It is very difficult to be poor. It is very expensive to be poor. In poor neighborhoods, goods cost more. In poor neighborhoods, you find that unemployment is obviously higher for any number of reasons. It is very difficult to be poor. When you are poor and you need a job, and it is difficult to get a job because of credit scores, it seems that we compound the problem. I am very concerned about how we approach credit scoring with reference to employing people, especially people who are poor. I look forward to hearing from the witnesses and I look forward to solutions such that poor people will not find that they are being invidiously discriminated against. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman Gutierrez. The gentleman yields back the balance of his time. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Manzullo be allowed to sit on the subcommittee, and hearing no objection, I recognize him for 1\\1/2\\ minutes. Mr. Manzullo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There is a distinction between people who incur medical debt and those who go out and charge vacations and consumer items. I practiced law for 22 years and have been through probably 1,000 bankruptcies. In several of those cases, the people I put into bankruptcy either exhausted their insurance or had no insurance and they filed bankruptcy not because they wanted to, not because they did anything intentionally, but simply because they could not pay off their medical bills. I talked to two colleagues of mine in Rockford, Illinois, who specialize in bankruptcy. The two of them have been through 30,000 bankruptcies together. One had the record for credit card debt, $140,000. Mr. Chairman, it was all medical expenses. We have to draw a distinction here between people who because of their spendthrift outrageous uncreditworthy conduct go out and buy things just because they want them, and people who are caught up, especially today, without insurance or lack of insurance or many times very high deductibles, co-pays, etc. I am a sponsor of this bill because it is the right thing to do, especially with so many credit card companies, the case that my wife and I had on a simple $150 coat that was put on layaway, it took us 4 years to clear that. It was not until I threatened a lawsuit under the Fair Credit Reporting Act that the credit companies finally backed off on it. Credit card reporting companies do a job and I understand what they are doing, but for people who are the unfortunate victims-- Chairman Gutierrez. The gentleman's time has expired. Mr. Manzullo. They should not have to suffer the consequences. Chairman Gutierrez. My friend, Mr. Watt, is recognized for a minute. Mr. Watt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I may not even take a minute. I just wanted to applaud your continuing effort to shed some light in this area, an area that a number of us started looking at during the last term of Congress and found some very disturbing things, like credit scores determine your automobile insurance rates. I never could quite figure out why somebody's credit had anything to do with their driving record or how somebody's credit had anything to do with the insurance rates that they paid on their homeowner's insurance. There are a lot of disconnects here, and we need more information about this so we can make some good judgments and possibly do some legislation in this area. I think that is why this hearing is so important, and I applaud the chairman for the hearing. Thank you. Chairman Gutierrez. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Garrett of New Jersey is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. Garrett. I thank the chairman, and I thank the ranking member, and I thank the members of the panel who are here. Credit information has obviously become an essential and valuable tool in allowing various market participants to more accurately price for the risk. One of the areas we are examining today is how this information is used by property casualty insurance companies in determining the premiums they charge to their clients. There have been numerous actuarial reports that have studied this. By using consumer-based insurance or CBIS, in determining premium rates for P&C lines, insurance companies are basically more able to accurately price for the risk of the consumer and the rates have significantly decreased for a broad majority of the policyholders. Credit scores are really just one of a number of different data points that insurers consider when determining a consumer's premium. If we were to now limit or restrict certain types of information from being used to allow insurers to more accurately price for risk, two things are going to happen: One, more people will pay higher premiums; and two, fewer people will be able to purchase insurance. Neither of these things are good. In the wake of the recent financial crisis, instead of looking for ways to decrease credit availability and the accurate pricing of risk, I believe Congress should be considering policies that will help expand credit for consumers and small businesses and lower the cost of credit and insurance premiums for the majority of Americans. With our current unemployment rate around 10 percent, we really must work on initiatives to expand economic opportunities for all Americans, not ways for the government to micro-manage our Nation's small businesses and risk trying to restrict the aggregate price of risk. With that, I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman Gutierrez. Last for our side, we have Congresswoman Maloney for 30 seconds. Mrs. Maloney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to welcome Mr. Wilson. LexisNexis is headquartered in the district I represent and I am very proud to represent his company which is so valuable to our country. The number of consumer complaints related to credit scores have been going up, and I look forward to his testimony and others on how we can better move forward in a way that is fair to consumers and fair to business. Thank you. Chairman Gutierrez. We have two panels this morning. The first panel will focus on the use of credit information for insurance underwriting and ratings, and the second panel will focus on the use of credit information in other areas such as employment. The first panel consists of three witnesses. First, the honorable Michael T. McRaith, director of the Illinois Department of Insurance, on behalf of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. I welcome Mr. McRaith here from Illinois. He is doing a great job out in the State of Illinois. I am happy to have him here. Then, we have Mr. David Snyder, the vice president and associate general counsel of the American Insurance Association. Our third witness is going to be introduced by Mr. Price of Georgia. Mr. Price. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Wilson is a constituent and I want to welcome him to our panel today. Mr. Wilson serves as the director of analytics for the Insurance Data Services Group at LexisNexis Risk Solutions. He joined Equifax in 1983, and his early experience included roles as a marketing analyst and as a field operations manager for electric gas and telephone utility customers, and he then served as manager of strategic planning and research before moving to Equifax Insurance Services in New Product Development. He has worked extensively on the development and introduction of the first credit scoring models, and has a wealth of knowledge in this area. In his current role with LexisNexis, he continues to support insurance risk scoring models and manages a team of statisticians and modelers, holds a B.A. in marketing from Oglethorpe, a grand university down in Georgia, and an MBA from Mercer University, another great education institution in Georgia. We want to welcome Mr. Wilson. Chairman Gutierrez. You are welcome here. We are going to start with the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. McRaith. You are recognized for 5 minutes. There is a clock there. It is green at the start of your 5 minutes. When there is a minute left, it will turn yellow. When you see it turning yellow, you have a minute left. A minute can last quite a while. When you see it turn red, I will tap. Five seconds later, we hope you will wrap it up. Please, Mr. McRaith, you are recognized for 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL T. McRAITH, DIRECTOR, ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE, ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC) Mr. McRaith. Thank you. Chairman Gutierrez, Ranking Member Hensarling, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify. I am Michael McRaith, director of Insurance in Illinois, and I serve as chairman of the Property and Casualty Committee for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Today, I offer the views of my fellow regulators on behalf of the NAIC. Thank you for your attention to the use of credit information in personal lines insurance. H.R. 5633, introduced and sponsored by the chairman last year, coincided with our own effort to scrutinize the use of insurance scores. As regulators, we do not fashion public policy. Those decisions are made by Congress and State legislatures. States view insurance scores from different perspectives. Some States have banned the use of credit information, others impose rate bans or prohibit use on renewal or allow only if credit information would reduce premium. Still others require only that credit not be the sole basis for an insurer's decision. In Illinois, unlike most States, our law requires only that insurers consider extraordinary life events and does not even recognize military deployment as an extraordinary event. In Illinois, an older gentleman from a small town wrote that he had paid cash for everything his whole life, car, farm land, etc. His handwritten note explained that he bought car insurance before the law required, never ate fancy meals or bought pricey clothes. He even added that he had been married 47 years to the same woman, but confronted a greater than 20 percent premium increase due to his thin file. Illinois law should be improved. For the NAIC, we applaud this committee's desire to move past the rhetoric of interested parties and toward a fully informed approach. To that same end, the NAIC held public hearings in 2009. Interested parties, insurers, actuaries, and insurance score vendors argued that insurance scores allow for more accurate underwriting and rating. Consumer representatives argued that credit-based insurance scores have a disparate impact on members of protected classes and are premised upon irrelevant if not inaccurate information. We heard in great length about the studies that support both positions. In our own States, insurers sell homeowner insurance in urban neighborhoods where homeowners were previously stretched to find affordable coverage. Insurers argue that credit-based insurance scores have facilitated that market change. Studies also indicate that individuals of racial and ethnic minority heritage are overrepresented in low credit score categories and that credit-based insurance scores discriminate on the basis of that heritage. Our national focus has turned. Rather than engage in that circular debate, we have undertaken a two-pronged strategy to assist policymakers. First, we are developing a standardized data call or detailed interrogatories for personal lines auto companies. This data call will target the impact of different factors upon rates paid by consumers: gender; marital status; age; and credit score, among others. This data will enable Congress and the States to measure the consumer and market impact of one State's law versus another's. Second, the NAIC is developing a model law to bring insurance score vendors within insurance regulator oversight. One panelist indicates in written testimony that those vendors are already subject to State regulator oversight, an assertion with which we largely agree. However, those same vendors argued the exact opposite before the NAIC, and we intend to eliminate the ambiguity. As digital information expands insurer access to consumer specific details, insurance regulators remain vigilant in protecting consumers against potentially abusive underwriting and rating practices. We are watchful for any underwriting or rating formula that may constitute a proxy for race, gender or other protected characteristics. Insurance must function as insurance. For the NAIC, we appreciate the chance to assist this subcommittee and pledge our continued support of your efforts. With our two-pronged approach, State regulators intend to offer reliable, fact-based information for Congress and the States. As our data call and model law development conclude, we will deliver the results to this committee and to Congress. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. McRaith can be found on page 81 of the appendix.] Chairman Gutierrez. Thank you so much. Mr. Snyder, you are recognized for 5 minutes, sir. STATEMENT OF DAVID F. SNYDER, VICE PRESIDENT AND ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL, AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION Mr. Snyder. Good morning. Chairman Gutierrez, Ranking Member Hensarling, Mr. Price, and members of the subcommittee, my name is Dave Snyder, and I am vice president and associate general counsel for the American Insurance Association. In the midst of the financial turmoil and its related chaos, the U.S. property and casualty insurance sector is stable, secure, and strong. There are good reasons for this. We, you and the States never lost sight of our fundamental shared goals, reduce risk where possible, accurately assess and assume the remaining risk, and provide effective coverage to the American people. As a result, auto and homeowner's insurance markets are by every measure financially sound, competitive, and affordable. Claims are being paid daily by solvent companies. The market is very competitive by any measure and insurance is taking less of a bite out of household incomes than in the past. This is good for the economy because this maximized competition forces prices down to the lowest feasible level so people have money to spend on other things. Insurance scoring has played a major role in creating this positive market for all concerned. By empowering more effective risk assessment and pricing, the majority of the population pays less. Insurance is more available and more people can receive reasonably priced coverage, instead of being relegated to the high-risk pools, because insurers have a cost-effective tool to assess and price for risk, giving them the certainty they need to provide coverage to nearly everyone. You have asked us to address certain issues relating to insurance scoring. In summary, it is race and income blind, and has repeatedly been proven to be an accurate predictor of risk, indeed, one of the most accurate. The States have actively regulated it and insurance commissioners have full access to all the information they desire. In response to your request for recommendations, we suggest that all States adopt the National Conference of Insurance Legislators' model law. Second, the States should make sure they capture and analyze all of the credit complaints they can and communicate with insurance companies about them, individually, and any trends. We note, for example, from Director McRaith's testimony, that the rate of complaints under the existing system for credit-based insurance scores is about 1 complaint out of every 1.5 million policies issued or renewed. In addition, we all need to work together more effectively on financial literacy to help the American people understand how insurance scores are used by insurance companies to provide them with coverage. There is one other recommendation we did not emphasize in our written statement, that is to make it more possible to innovate on a pilot basis. For example, to introduce more direct measures of driving performance, such as the ability to assess risk, based not only on mileage, but how, when, and where those miles were driven. One other factor in the strength of the personal lines insurance market is that we have collectively reduced risk. Thanks to your leadership and that of safety groups, the insurance industry, and the States, far fewer Americans are injured and killed on our highways than ever would have been expected. Using fatality rates of 1964, last year alone, we have collectively saved 120,000 lives and prevented millions of injuries. This has created a solid foundation of the healthy auto insurance system we have today. The insurance industry is focused on building safety as never before through advocacy of smoke detector laws and codes requiring sprinklers and disaster resistant buildings, and the eminent opening of a building construction test center with wind turbines powerful enough to test the structural integrity of buildings. We hope to see a pattern of positive change similar to that which we helped bring about in auto safety with your cooperation and assistance. Thank you for inviting me to speak with you today. I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Snyder can be found on page 147 of the appendix.] Chairman Gutierrez. Mr. Wilson, you are now recognized for 5 minutes, sir. STATEMENT OF JOHN WILSON, DIRECTOR, ANALYTICS, LEXISNEXIS RISK SOLUTIONS Mr. Wilson. Good morning. My name is John Wilson, and I am director of analytics for the Insurance Data Services Group at LexisNexis Risk Solutions. LexisNexis provides technology and information that helps businesses, government agencies, and other organizations reduce fraud and mitigate risks. In our Insurance Data Services Group, we provide a variety of products and services to support the insurance industry, including credit-based insurance scores. In my remarks today, I will focus specifically on how our insurance scores are developed, utilized, and regulated. Credit-based insurance scores have long been used by insurance underwriters and actuaries to more accurately assess risk for auto and homeowner's insurance policies. Insurance scores provide an objective, effective, and consistent tool that insurers use with other information such as driving histories and prior claims to better predict the likelihood of future claims and the cost of those claims. Deriving an insurance score follows a straightforward process. A carrier compiles historical policy experience, including earned premiums and incurred losses, on a selected population of risks. LexisNexis then works with the credit bureau to match that policy experience to the historical consumer credit from the particular point in time to which the policy performance data pertains. Then, using regression techniques, we identify the credit variables that taken together provide the best representation of the observed loss ratio performance. Most credit variables can be grouped into one of five primary areas: one, how long you have had accounts established; two, the number and type of accounts that you hold; three, indications of recent activity, including inquiries and new account openings; four, the degree of utilization on your accounts; and five, payment history. The relevant weight of each of these areas can vary depending on the line of business being modeled but for any specific model, the insurance regulator is given access to the individual variable descriptions, bins, and point assignments. Insurance scores do not consider factors such as race, religion, national origin, gender, marital status, age, sexual orientation, address, income, occupation, disability or education. Also, inquiries made for account review or promotional or insurance purposes are not used in calculating insurance scores. We also exclude medical collections. It is important to note that while LexisNexis provides insurance scores, we are not an insurance company. We are not involved in insurer rate setting determinations or rate decisions with respect to groups of individuals or individual consumers. LexisNexis is also not a consumer credit bureau, and we do not make credit decisions. Our role is to supply information to the insurance carriers to assist them in making underwriting decisions. The credit-based insurance scoring process is currently regulated at multiple levels. LexisNexis is considered a consumer reporting agency under the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and its State analogues. As required by that Act, LexisNexis provides consumers upon request with access to all the information in the consumer's file at the time of the request. We have also set up a process by which any consumer may order a copy of their insurance score via our Choicetrust.com Web site. Additionally, because insurance is regulated at the State level, LexisNexis must conform its models to specific State statutes, regulations, and guidelines relative to insurance scoring. Most States have adopted regulations based on the model law on insurance scoring developed by the National Conference of Insurance Legislators. Pursuant to State requirements, a third party vendor like LexisNexis must file its model for review with State insurance departments. In many States, carriers are required to include the LexisNexis model filing materials in their rate filing. In other States, a carrier may be allowed to reference the LexisNexis model once it has been filed. Finally, the insurer must gain approval of its rate filing that may include an insurance scoring component. As a result, LexisNexis works on an ongoing basis with State departments of insurance to explain our models and to create State-approved scoring solutions for our insurance customers. In addition, LexisNexis provides two consumer Web sites, Choicetrust.com and Consumerdisclosure.com, to make information about our insurance scores and processes more readily accessible to consumers and to other interested individuals. In conclusion, credit-based insurance scores provide an objective, effective, and consistent tool that insurers use with other information to better predict the likelihood of future claims and the cost of those claims. There are existing Federal and State regulation and approval processes that provide comprehensive oversight by individual State departments of insurance over insurance scores, insurance score developers, and the use of insurance scores. LexisNexis works cooperatively with State insurance commissioners and their staffs in seeking approval for our scoring models. I appreciate the opportunity to provide the subcommittee with information on insurance scoring, and I am happy to answer any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Mr. Wilson can be found on page 180 of the appendix.] Chairman Gutierrez. Thank you so much. I welcome all of you here. I know there are a lot of questions because I can see that quite a number of members have shown up this morning. Let me just take a couple of minutes, and then I will allow members to ask questions. I will just make some general comments. If someone has cancer and they become very ill and they do not have health insurance, they are likely to suffer great economic harm, and that is going to affect their credit score. Let me ask you, if someone becomes ill, is it more likely they are going to drive quickly, get into an accident, or drive erratically if they become ill? Their credit score, as we know, is going to be affected. Each of you answer the question, please, from left to right. Mr. McRaith? Mr. McRaith. Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me say and also in reply to Congresswoman Kilroy's concern about medical expenses, we are aware that two-thirds of all personal bankruptcies are based on medical costs. Three-quarters of those people filed even though they had health insurance. It is a significant problem. Different States have adopted different approaches to dealing with an extraordinary life event like medical expenses as you have described, and allowing-- Chairman Gutierrez. If you use my credit score, a deteriorating credit score, is it more likely I am going to cause the insurance company additional liability? Mr. McRaith. To answer that question, I do not know the answer to that. I am not sure that anyone has explained directly the nexus between credit score and driving. Chairman Gutierrez. Mr. Snyder? Am I more likely to survive cancer and have incredible debt? Is my house more likely to have a fire? Mr. Snyder. Mr. Chairman, the answer to that is no. That is why we have supported language in the National Conference of Insurance Legislators' model that removes collection accounts with a medical industry code. That is what was done first, and then this past summer, the National Conference of Insurance Legislators tightened that up even more with our support. It removes the consideration of negative factors resulting from a serious illness or injury. Chairman Gutierrez. Just for the record, just so it is clear to all the members of this committee, you are coming here representing who? Just so we have it for the record. You are representing the American insurance industry? Mr. Snyder. Yes, sir. Chairman Gutierrez. Thank you. Mr. Wilson, you provide them with the information, so what do you think? Mr. Wilson. We have not tried to study the specific question that you have asked. We also agree that medical collections should not be used in our scores. Chairman Gutierrez. But they are used in scores. Mr. Wilson. They are not. Chairman Gutierrez. In your credit report, they are. If someone fails to pay a medical bill, it has a derogatory impact on my credit report, which is going to have a derogatory impact on my credit score. Mr. Wilson. I am not going to-- Chairman Gutierrez. You cannot. It shows up. In other words, Mr. Wilson, if someone does have difficulty paying a hospital bill and it goes to a collection agency, does that show up on the individual's credit report? Mr. Wilson. It will show up on the credit report. Chairman Gutierrez. Does it have a derogatory effect on their credit score? Mr. Wilson. It is not used in our scores. Chairman Gutierrez. It is not used in your scores, but it is used in their credit reports. Mr. Wilson. It is on the credit report. Chairman Gutierrez. Thank you. It is used on the credit report. Everybody has witnesses here. I do not think Mr. Wilson is too upset at me asking him the questions. What we are trying to get at here is how is it that people who have an accident, who have an illness, in the end are not deprived of insurance even though they had no way of dealing with this and maybe it does not have anything to do with them. Let me ask, if I am employed and I become unemployed and cannot pay my bills because I have become unemployed, does that mean I am more likely to have an accident or fire in my house? Mr. Wilson? Mr. Wilson. Again, the scoring models that do look at delinquent payments which would potentially be a result of having lost a job show that those delinquencies are in fact indicative of greater risk of claim filing. Chairman Gutierrez. Therefore, I would pay more in health care insurance? I am sorry. Therefore, I would pay more in car or home insurance? Mr. Wilson. You could; yes. Chairman Gutierrez. I would. Mr. Wilson. Not every carrier uses credit scoring and the weights-- Chairman Gutierrez. Thank you. My time has expired. Mr. Snyder. Mr. Chairman, if I might, just to provide a further response to that, the extraordinary life circumstances language added to the National Conference of Insurance Legislators' model specifically excludes the use of loss of employment for a period of 3 months or more if it results from involuntary termination. Yes, that is a factor which we are trying to work with consistent with your question. Chairman Gutierrez. Thank you. Mr. McRaith. Mr. Chairman, if I could add-- Chairman Gutierrez. I am sorry. I ask unanimous consent for 10 more seconds. Mr. McRaith, please? Mr. McRaith. They cannot both be true; if medical loss expenses are not considered, then there would be no reason to have an extraordinary life exception. Also, the so-called NCOIL model has been adopted in different States in different variations, as I said. The State of Illinois, for example, only requires that the company consider such an event. Chairman Gutierrez. Thank you. I recognize Mr. Price for 5 minutes. Mr. Price. This is a remarkably important topic and I think there is a lot of misinformation that is going into the debate, and there is a lot of hyperbole that occurs. I am hopeful that throughout the question period in this hearing, we will be able to sort out some of that. Mr. Wilson, you mentioned in your testimony that the main variables, the primary areas where credit variables are looked at are: length of time of an account; number and type of credit accounts; indications of recent activity; the degree of utilization; and payment practices. In your next statement, ``Insurance scores do not consider factors such as race, religion, national origin, gender, marital status, age, sexual orientation, address, income, occupation, disability or education.'' Given that, why do you think there is all this misinformation about what goes into a credit score? Mr. Wilson. I do think some of the comments that were introductory to this session are accurate, that not every consumer has a clear understanding of all of the details of credit reports, credit scoring, or how these things are used in making decisions about them. I do think we have tried to be out there making information available to consumers. We developed training programs for continuing education credits for agents, insurance agents, because they are very often the first line of answering questions about these things. Mr. Price. Providing a score, you are not an insurance company, you are not a credit bureau, you do not provide credit, you provide information? Mr. Wilson. Right. Mr. Price. There is a lot of information that goes into the rationale for why a consumer might be excluded from gaining credit. I would be interested in the opinion of the panel on if we as a Congress determine we ought to exclude certain things from being considered, is it possible that would actually harm consumers as opposed to helping consumers, Mr. Wilson? Mr. Snyder? Mr. Snyder. Mr. Price, the FTC estimated that 59 percent of the people pay less as a result of credit-based insurance scores. Frankly, in public testimony given by companies in the States, the numbers are really much higher for many companies. We would envision first of all a very negative effect on the vast majority of policyholders directly. Secondly, it would deprive the market of a critical tool that has allowed the market to evolve much more toward objective underwriting individually tailored to each risk, which in turn is giving the companies the confidence to write virtually everybody. Under the old system that was sort of pass/fail, you were either very good, normal or you were relegated to the high cost assigned risk plans. Now, because of the tool that is capable of individual accurate and objective risk assessment, insurance companies are pretty much able to write anyone who comes to them, which has resulted in the shrinkage to historic lows of these high risk pools, so there are a number of harms that would come, some directly, to the majority of policyholders, and then indirectly to a market as a whole resulting in less competition and potentially less availability of insurance. Mr. Price. And higher costs? Less availability and higher costs. Mr. Snyder. And higher costs. Mr. Price. Mr. McRaith, do you agree with that? Mr. McRaith. Congressman, we should always be concerned about unintended consequences and certainly the pricing of one risk in a company's pool affects the pricing of another risk in that same pool. However, we should not accept as gospel that 60 percent of people benefit from the use of credit-based insurance scores because we do not know what the baseline is. Mr. Price. Do you dispute that number? Mr. McRaith. What I am saying is, I described earlier our effort with the data call to collect information from insurance companies. One is to get behind the rhetoric which argues that a certain percentage of consumers benefit from the use of credit-based insurance scores. We do not know when we hear the word ``benefit,'' what is the starting point. We do not know what the baseline is. That is what we intend to find out. We will report back to you. Mr. Price. Mr. Wilson, do you have any comments? Mr. Wilson. No. Mr. Price. In the remaining seconds, what factors did Congress rely on when examining and endorsing the non-lending uses of credit information while amending the Fair Credit Reporting Act in 1996 and the FACT Act in 2003? Mr. Snyder? Mr. Snyder. Congress continued the ability of insurers to use credit information for insurance underwriting, and that has long been the case. Congress continued that through the recent amendments. The recent amendments also made the whole credit scoring system better. Frankly, we have a major interest in making sure that scores are accurate and that people have access to their credit history and the ability to correct any issues that may exist. I think the Congress improved all of that through the most recent amendments, but did maintain the long-standing ability on the part of insurers to use credit for underwriting subject to Federal law under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and all that implies as well as being currently State regulated, all the State regulation that applies as well. Mr. Price. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gutierrez. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. Watt, you are recognized for 5 minutes, sir. Mr. Watt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to try to make a distinction here between causation and correlation. I take it, Mr. Wilson, you are in the nexus business. That is the correlation business. What you are saying is, there is a correlation between somebody's credit score and these factors that impact driving insurance rates and homeowner's insurance rates. I am not clear whether you are prepared to assert to me that there is some causal connection between those things as opposed to a correlation between those things. Let me ask the question directly: Are you prepared to assert to me that if I have a low credit score, that will cause me to be a worse driver? Mr. Wilson. No. Mr. Watt. Are you prepared to assert to me that if I have a low credit score, that is likely to cause me to have a fire at my house? Mr. Wilson. I am not saying it is causal. Mr. Watt. You are saying that the correlation factor makes it more likely that I will be a bad driver; right? That is what the nexus is in your LexisNexis, I take it. Is that right? Mr. Wilson. I am not actually familiar with what the nexus in our LexisNexis-- Mr. Watt. Do not waste my time on hyperbole. Let's talk about insurance, not LexisNexis. I am sorry. I got you off track. You are saying there is a correlation. We have made it explicitly clear that if there is a correlation between race and bad driving or race and more likelihood that I will have a fire, that is prohibited; right? You cannot take that into account. There is no question about that. If you find some substitute for race that correlates in the same way, has the same impact, would you think it would be appropriate to use that as a factor and then turn around and say well, no, we are not considering race at all, we are just considering this correlation factor that we have out here? Mr. Wilson. You are giving me a hypothetical. Mr. Watt. No, I am just asking you a question. Would you think it would be appropriate to do that? Mr. Wilson. If you could find a pure proxy, you should not be able to use it; yes. Mr. Watt. Okay. What about you, Mr. McRaith? I assume you would not think it would be appropriate to do that. Mr. McRaith. It is absolutely fair to say, Congressman, that the States have taken different approaches to this subject. If one factor were identified to be a proxy, I believe all States would be opposed to that. Mr. Snyder. Mr. Watt, if I might add that-- Mr. Watt. I am not sure I asked you anything, Mr. Snyder. You are welcome to add something. Mr. Snyder. Thank you, sir. The FTC did conclude that credit-based insurance scoring is not serving as a proxy for race. Mr. Watt. I read that study. We had a hearing about that study. It did not exactly say that. I understand you want to get that in the record. Maybe we ought to put that study in the record. We had it in the record last year when we had a hearing about this. That is not exactly what it says. It says kind of there is the same kind of correlation that you are talking about as legitimate here for credit-based scoring between this and race. You want to use it on one side and say we like the correlation on one side and we are going to use it, and on the other side, we do not like the correlation, so we want to say no, no, we should not be using correlations here. Is there not a strong correlation between these factors and race? That requires either a yes or no answer. Is there a strong correlation or is there not? Mr. Snyder. It found that it was not a proxy for race. Mr. Watt. I heard that. That is what you testified to earlier. That is not the question I asked. I want to know, is there a strong correlation, not whether there is a proxy. I do not think anybody in here knows what ``proxy'' means. Tell us, is there a strong correlation or not? Chairman Gutierrez. The time of the gentleman has expired. Answer the question. Mr. Snyder. It found that there were larger percentages in various demographic groups with lower credit scores than other groups. It also found that within these groups-- Chairman Gutierrez. Your time has expired. Mr. Watt. Can I just get him to answer my question, Mr. Chairman? Chairman Gutierrez. I tried. We will come back around. Mr. Watt. I just want to know whether there is a strong correlation or not. That is a simple question. It is not a trick. Chairman Gutierrez. Mr. Marchant, you are recognized for 5 minutes, sir. Mr. Marchant. Thank you. Mr. Wilson, talk to us about the relationship you have with your customer. Your customer is an insurance underwriter, salesman, company? Mr. Wilson. Right. Our primary customer is the underwriting department and/or the actuarial department in the personal lines property casualty industries. Mr. Marchant. Is a major consideration--would the insurance company come to you regardless of whether there was credit being extended to the customer to purchase the product? Mr. Wilson. Yes. The credit scoring used by insurance companies is generally not a part of say premium finance decisions. It is a risk indication. Mr. Marchant. The credit history that you are looking at has nothing to do with the fact as to whether the insurance company is going to get paid for the product they are selling? Mr. Wilson. Right. It is not about payment of premium. Mr. Marchant. It is purely a historical fact that gets plugged into the fact of what they pay for insurance actually; right? Mr. Wilson. Right. The credit factors or the score in conjunction with driving record, in conjunction with coverage amounts, in conjunction with prior losses, it all goes into the underwriting or rating of the policy. Mr. Marchant. If a customer comes to the insurance company and says, I want this kind of coverage and I am going to pay cash, the companies still go through the same process, and if your information taints that customer, even though they are planning to pay cash or pay for it other than with that company, it still taints that customer or has the potential to taint them? Mr. Wilson. Right. If the carrier does use credit scores as part of their rating, then it would be used even if the consumer were paying cash for their premium. Mr. Marchant. This is the complaint that I get from my constituents the most. They feel that because they have had bad credit or they have had a car repossessed or they paid their last insurance policy and their premiums were slow, they feel like when they apply for more insurance, the reason why their insurance--the rate has been raised is because there is a direct correlation between the late payments on a previous policy. You are saying it is the late payments on any kind of credit they may have? Mr. Wilson. That is right. Mr. Marchant. Not specifically on that product, on the insurance itself? Mr. Wilson. On the premiums; right. Mr. Marchant. You give the report to them, but it is up to the underwriting department to make its own decision based on your report, how much they weigh each of those things? Mr. Wilson. That is correct. Mr. Marchant. What is your experience in that weighing process? Is it pretty reliable if you have a very low credit score that you are going to pay more for your insurance? Mr. Wilson. These scores have been tested not only by independent parties like actuaries and the Federal Government and the Texas Department of Insurance, but also by carriers themselves. Carriers would not use these tools if they did not work well for them. There is a great deal of variation, however, in the weight that individual carriers assign to credit score in their overall rating programs. Mr. Marchant. Mr. Snyder, in your particular instance, would a driving record be a significant factor in your information that you gave to an underwriter that bought your service? Mr. Snyder. Absolutely. Auto insurance rating generally involves not only credit information but the age of the driver, the prior driving experience, the make and model of the vehicle, and on and on. The ultimate underwriting and rating decision is based upon many factors, only one of which is credit. Chairman Gutierrez. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. Moore is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held the first in a series of hearings last week on the topic of the end of excess, a broad look at lessons learned from the crisis. I believe that one lesson from the financial crisis is we need to go back to living within our means and that is true for our government, for financial firms, for businesses, families, and individuals. Mr. Snyder, I agree with the point you make in your testimony that we need to increase financial literacy, which will be the focus of one of our subcommittee hearings in our lessons learned series. We need to teach personal finance to our students in high school and college, ensuring that our young people are fully empowered to make sound financial decisions. Mr. Snyder, as we think about credit scores, how can we encourage individuals to regularly review their credit report, correct any misinformation, and learn how to build their credit scores? Mr. Snyder. Thank you. It is a message which we try to repeat on Web sites. Attached to my testimony is some information where we talk about what goes into an insurance score and the need to stay on top of it. There are adverse action notices that make that point as well. I know the credit industry is doing a lot. Frankly, we look forward to increased cooperation with the Congress and the States on improving financial literacy. We have done some work on our own. We would like to work collaboratively to see what we can do to raise the level of financial literacy for everyone in this country. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Mr. McRaith or Mr. Wilson, do either of you have any comments? Mr. McRaith. Financial literacy is important for all sectors of consumer finance. Insurance in particular can be very confusing to the average family, the average small business. States are committed to helping consumers understand how their insurance policies are underwritten, how they are priced, and providing whatever direct consumer assistance we can. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Mr. Wilson? Mr. Wilson. I would agree with the gentleman. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Mr. McRaith, in your experience as a State regulator, how accurate are these credit scores? Do they get abused in how are they used by insurance firms? Do credit scores assign reasonable value if one is comparing medical debt to excessive spending habits, and do insurance firms focus more on credit scores or the inputs that provide the credit scores? What is your view? Mr. McRaith. Congressman, in fact, we understand a broad range. What one company does and the weights that one company might assign to one factor like a credit score might be significantly different from another company. Of course, different States have different parameters. There is a wide variation. I think one State estimates a variance of credit score affecting a rate from 7 percent up to the high double digits. That indicates that companies use this one factor of credit scores in a way that--companies use them differently based on their proprietary or pricing formula. Medical expenses and the debt associated with medical expenses frequently is a problem for consumers. State law varies with respect to whether consumers can be penalized for that or what is the recourse the consumer might have in the event that consumer is penalized for medical debt. It is inaccurate to say that companies do not consider medical debt as part of a credit score. It is also inaccurate to say that all States allow medical debt to be exempted as an extraordinary life event. Some States do. Some States do not. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Do either of the other witnesses have a comment? Mr. Snyder? Mr. Snyder. Yes, sir. With regard to the latest point, we support the enactment of the National Conference of Insurance Legislators' model, including extraordinary life circumstances, including the provision on use of serious injury or serious illness with the individual or family member. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you. Mr. Wilson. I think I would just add that even in States that have not adopted an NCOIL model or an NCOIL-like model, we still do not consider medically coded collection items in our scoring. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back my time. Chairman Gutierrez. The gentleman yields back the balance of his time. Congressman Lance, you are recognized for 5 minutes, sir. Mr. Lance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to you all. Commissioner McRaith, if credit-based insurance scores were not used by insurers as one factor out of many for setting premiums, what other factors, in your opinion, would be more heavily weighted and what would be the likely effect on rates? Mr. McRaith. Congressman, the availability of data to any one insurance company at this point is so expansive, it is impossible to determine exactly what or to conclude what factors would replace a credit score. Some companies are using all of the sub-components of a credit score right now for pricing and not relying solely upon a credit score in and of itself. What we expect is that eliminating one rating factor will shift costs. There are some people who might pay more. Others might pay less. When you affect the price of one person in a risk pool, you are going to also affect someone else in that same pool. Mr. Lance. That is obviously my point, and whether that would be fair to others where the risk would be shifted is obviously a question of great concern. Mr. Snyder, do you have an opinion on that? Mr. Snyder. I would agree with the comments of Director McRaith on the potential impact on people paying more as a result. Mr. Lance. Mr. Snyder, could you move your microphone closer? Mr. Snyder. Yes. I would just indicate my agreement with the comments Director McRaith just made, that if some people pay less, many more people will pay more. Mr. Lance. From your experience, what might be those factors if we were to eliminate this factor? Mr. Snyder. Well, in one sense it might force the industry to go back to larger classifications and rely more on those, such as territory and other factors which themselves were controversial. With the addition of credit-based insurance scores, you have added a degree of objectivity and individual tailoring that did not exist before, and it allows both not only accurate rating and underwriting of individuals but has improved availability in the market because the confidence companies have that they have the ability to price every risk and therefore, many more risks are being written in the voluntary market. Mr. Lance. Credit scores are individual. I recognize a once-in-a-lifetime situation should be excluded. Credit scores are individual in a way that geographical territory is not and may be bitterly unfair to those who live within the territory, and actually in my judgment may be extremely harmful to those whom we are trying to help. Mr. Wilson, your thoughts? Mr. Wilson. That is certainly a possibility. There are only so many factors that have been demonstrated to have a correlation with expected loss costs, and insurance companies do try to use them as effectively as they can to write risks. Mr. Lance. What would your view be on a risk based upon territory? Mr. Wilson. Territory has been demonstrated to be strongly indicative, but as you know, it is broad, and one of the benefits as we saw it for credit scoring is it was individual. Mr. Lance. Yes. It is my observation that in several other areas, unrelated to the discussion this morning, Congress has inappropriately tried to pressure those. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac certainly come to mind. I trust as we move forward on this issue that we do not engage in the type of behavior in which Congress was certainly guilty regarding that matter. I yield back the balance of my time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gutierrez. The gentleman yields back the balance of his time. Congressman Hinojosa is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. Hinojosa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gutierrez, I want to thank you for holding this important hearing on a very important issue, consumer credit. I commend my colleague, Congresswoman Mary Jo Kilroy, for introducing H.R. 3421, the Medical Debt Relief Act of 2009. The intent of her legislation is admirable. I agree with her that medical debt should be removed from credit reports 30 days after that debt has been repaid or settled, and that it not continue to hurt the credit rating of that individual, having gone through so many difficulties with sickness. I am concerned about one issue involving credit reporting agencies. They buy and sell information from virtually all adult residents in the United States. For a long time, we have been encouraging them to provide credit reports in languages other than English, especially Spanish. Mr. Chairman, I would ask that each credit reporting agency provide in writing their proposals to provide credit reports in languages other than English or that we at least have an opportunity to debate that. I would like to ask my question to Mr. Snyder. I am interested in legislation that would require that every adult American citizen 21 years or older receive a free credit score on an annual basis. Would the American Insurance Association support such legislation? Mr. Snyder. I think we would. We are interested in having both transparency in the process as well as accuracy in credit scoring. I have not checked with my other colleagues in that industry. Perhaps they have a view of that. I certainly think anything that makes the process more transparent as the Congress has done recently is something worthy of very serious consideration. Mr. Hinojosa. I am glad to hear you say that. Mr. McRaith, do lenders or insurance lenders pay for the credit reports they obtain from the credit reporting agencies? Mr. McRaith. Insurance companies typically will contract with a vendor that will provide or develop the insurance score on which the underwriting decisions and pricing are determined by that insurance company. Some of the larger companies have their own independent proprietary insurance scoring formula. Mr. Hinojosa. I see. Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back. Chairman Gutierrez. The gentleman yields back. Mr. Neugebauer? Mr. Neugebauer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to go back to one of the things that seems to be a common theme, and I do not want to put words in people's mouth, but that the credit scores are used in part of the underwriting process. What is not standardized is some companies put more weight on that credit score than others. If I am a company and I am competing for business, if I am overly penalizing people for their credit scores and using that as a higher rate, I am probably losing business because I would say I would be pricing myself out of the market. Is that a reasonable assumption? Mr. Snyder. Yes, sir; that is. Mr. Neugebauer. Basically, the checks and balances of how that information is being used is in the marketplace today; right? Mr. Snyder. Yes, there are many checks and balances in the marketplace, and the additional check and balance of detailed regulation at the State level. Mr. McRaith. I would add, Congressman, that the companies pursued the profitable risks, and if in fact credit-based insurance scores identify prospectively less profitable risks, the pricing might be geared towards reducing the likelihood of that less profitable risk from enrolling with that company. Mr. Neugebauer. Which is probably prudent business, wouldn't you say? Mr. McRaith. I would say that is the business judgment of the company; absolutely. Mr. Neugebauer. What we want is these companies--I do not want to do business with an insurance company that is broke. Do you? Mr. McRaith. No, that is exactly right. We want financially strong companies able to deliver on the promises they make to consumers. Mr. Neugebauer. I think one of my colleagues asked the question and I want to rephrase it just a little bit, is it fair to say that because of the underwriting tools, credit report being one of them, and other information, that people can actually effectively lower their insurance costs by good behavior? Mr. Snyder. Yes, absolutely. The system very much rewards that behavior, not only on the road but in terms of responsible management of credit. Mr. Neugebauer. Mr. Wilson, any reflection on that? Mr. Wilson. I would agree. You do have the opportunity to modify your profile, your risk profile, and therefore become a better risk. Mr. Neugebauer. We have gotten into the business around here it seems like that we kind of are trying to get government to pick the winners and losers. We do it with legislation that hand-ties a process that works and rewards good behavior where people who pay their bills, drive safely, demonstrate certain characteristics that they are responsible, and they get to reap the benefit from that. It seems to me if we go in and sterilize that system, basically it becomes harder to determine who is the higher risk or the more profitable, so what happens is in order for a company to counteract that, I guess they just raise everybody's rates. Would that be a fair assumption? Mr. McRaith. I think it would in fact pricing, Congressman. As I mentioned in my opening statement, we see homeowner insurance companies, for example, offering insurance in neighborhoods where previously it would have been very difficult for them to price a homeowner policy. Having said that, actuarial justification is not in and of itself a sufficient reason to allow a rating factor to be used. In our examples over time, I will not bore you with it right now, actuarially justified factors that Congress or the States later determine should be prohibited. Mr. Neugebauer. Should we be careful as we go down that road? Mr. McRaith. I think those are the public policy questions, of course, that Congress and the State legislatures answer every day. Mr. Neugebauer. One of the things that I think about is I know there are different insurance products, for example, they ask you if you are a smoker. If you are not a smoker, there is a discount. There must be a reason actuarially that non-smokers get a discount. Would you agree with that? Mr. McRaith. Absolutely. The one example that I recall, Congressman, is several years ago, there were life insurance companies charging higher premiums to African-American enrollees because their life expectancy was shorter. The country and States determined that was inappropriate. I am not disagreeing with you. I think we want companies to be accurately pricing their products and financially strong. All I am pointing out is that actuarial justification in and of itself is not sufficient. Chairman Gutierrez. The time of the gentleman has expired. The gentlelady from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you for having this hearing. I thank the panelists for their information. We know that some individuals do not have traditional credit reports. Some have alternative reports that are created by items such as rental payments and utilities, to create a credit history. Those kinds of reports typically are different than a traditional credit report in underwriting. For all of you, the current economic downturn has resulted in financial struggles for many of our constituents. As a result, they have seen their credit reports negatively impacted, even though they have had a good history from the past. How could this affect an individual's ability to renew their insurance? I will throw that out to all of you. Mr. Snyder. Thank you. Lending scores and insurance scores are very different. We have included some materials in our statement from FICO, which is one of the major modelers, indicating they have not seen an overall pattern of insurance scores declining. It is because of the different make-up of the scores. You have heard no doubt and read newspaper articles about lending scores. That has not been the case with insurance scores. They continue to be very stable over time, and they continue to reflect differences in risk. Insurers also have the ability to adjust their rating tier so that if you have an overall decline in the economy, you can understand that across-the-board, so you have not had the impact on insurance scores that has occurred with regard to lending scores that you might otherwise assume would be occurring. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. Just a follow-up question, so many homes have actually de-valued in their worth, and yet they are continuing with basically--I just thought of this when you were speaking. My homeowner's insurance basically has gone up even though my home value has gone down. Are you seeing a trend like that across the Nation? Mr. McRaith. Congresswoman, we have seen homeowner insurance premiums increase. We perceive that not to be a reflection of the value of the house necessarily, more a reflection of the economic challenges. Investment portfolios of insurance companies, of course, did not provide the return they had been seeing over the years, and as a result, we expect premiums increased for many companies to reflect the decrease in portfolio return. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. It has nothing to do with basically--to rebuild the home would be lower, but you are still paying a higher price. Mr. McRaith. Right. In fact, one question that I have heard with some frequency is, since construction costs are less now because construction workers are generally less expensive, why is the cost of my premium not declining as well? Again, the premiums are not necessarily tied to the value of the home or the cost of replacing that home. They are connected with that but not directly and solely connected with that. I would also add in terms of the question that you asked Mr. Snyder earlier, we do have that concern and have explored that question. For example, many credit card limits decreased through no act or fault of the consumer as a result of our recent financial challenges nationally. That affects the credit ratio for that individual consumer. Does that then affect the insurance score? That remains to be an open question and we have heard conclusions on both sides of that question. However, our effort, as I mentioned earlier, is to provide Congress with more fact-based information and reply to some of those questions, and we expect to have that survey done by the end of this year. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. Thank you. Mr. Wilson? Mr. Wilson. Yes. I guess I would note that we also track information on our insurance applicants' scores, and while we have seen some adverse changes as an example, a slight increase in delinquency rates and in some cases, as Mr. McRaith mentioned, a reduction in the limits on credit cards, we have also seen some positive changes. We have seen fewer inquiries, fewer recent account openings. We have also seen many consumers are actually paying down their revolving indebtedness. That, I think, has tempered the changes in the scores. Chairman Gutierrez. The time of the gentlelady has expired. Mr. Royce, you are recognized for 5 minutes, sir. Mr. Royce. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Instead of dealing in the abstract, I would like to focus on a few facts here. I come from California. In California, we continually rank among the highest rates for auto insurance in the country. A study just came out, again, California is in the top five, as we always are. Despite the fact that many safe drivers in California have decades of driving experience and clean driving records, they are also paying the highest insurance premiums in the Nation. My home State also happens to ban the use of credit scores for insurance. I was going to ask Mr. Snyder, is there a correlation between the fact that the insurance rates are so high and the banning of credit scores? Mr. Snyder. We think there is. California has an unique and incredibly restricted rating system. According to economist David Appel, that cost California consumers $10 billion throughout the 1990's because loss costs, which we were pleased to participate in, for example, through highway safety, anti- fraud measures declined dramatically. The entire State played a role in that, and we were there to support it. Because the regulatory system was so rigid, companies were not able to respond as rapidly as they would in a free market to those declining costs, and the difference calculated just during one decade was the cost to California consumers of about $10 billion. We think there are huge subsidies within the system as a result of that strict rating regime that is in place. We also think it would fail any cost/benefit analysis and is grossly inefficient--a totally unique system with major negatives about it. Mr. Royce. It seems that the essence of this issue when you get down to it is whether or not a credit score has a predictive value when it comes to auto insurance scoring. I know study after study, and I think you mentioned the FTC study, they all conclude that a credit score has a strong predictive value and is a net benefit to the market. The result, I think, in that study, said the use of credit scores produce a situation where 59 percent of policyholders pay less as a result of that use. What happens when we remove this risk indicator? Is there a viable alternative out there to credit scores that you can think of that is as good? Mr. Snyder. Right now, no. That was actually confirmed in the FTC study. The fear would be if you eliminated an individual objective factor like credit scores, they would be forced to go back to larger risk classifications or more reliance on larger risk classifications in the past, such as territory and other factors like that. I think what the FTC concluded is there was not another factor out there that was able to assure the same predictiveness as we currently have. I think that would be the fear, that we would have a system less accurate, actually less fair, and one relying on larger classifications rather than on the more individual risk classification. Mr. Royce. The FTC concludes that risk-based pricing benefits the majority of market participants. The observation I would make is that if there is a flaw in the marketplace in terms of anti-competitive pricing or the availability of insurance, we should look at the fragmented antiquated regulatory model that exists in the United States that is unlike that anywhere else in the world, where we have this regulatory model overseeing the industry where we have 50 different markets instead of one national market, and I think recent estimates put that cost of the fragmented State-based system at $14 billion in higher premiums every year for consumers. If we could focus instead on enhancing competition, instead of unnecessarily limiting tools in the marketplace, it would be much better for the consumer, although I am sure many of our elected State insurance commissioners would have to find other things to focus on. It would certainly move us into a national market for insurance. It would certainly not only reduce the costs but produce a much more competitive industry, especially when you look at what Europe is doing right now as it goes to one market for all of Europe for insurance. Chairman Gutierrez. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. Royce. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gutierrez. You are very welcome. Congressman Baca, you are recognized for 5 minutes, sir. Mr. Baca. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I thank you and the ranking member for your leadership on this issue which is important to a lot of us, especially as we represent diverse groups of individuals within our communities. I am concerned from both aspects that it impacts everyone but also how it impacts many minorities as we look at the credit rating. I heard a lot of you talk about it when Congressman Moore said we needed more financial literacy. The problem is on this literacy, where does it go and what kind of outreach are we doing in making sure that when we target it, the different diversities, that they are actually aware of the credit scores that they are going to get, and if they get it, when do they know they are getting a credit score? Right now, as we look at its impact, it is not only on the automobile but also as we look at the health bill that is coming before us. Maybe any one of you three can explain that, and since no one has clearly explained the casual connection between credit scores and insurance risks, are customers at least made aware of the credit scores that are used when they purchase that coverage? Is there an adjustment during any period of time to their rates they are getting because they may have improved or something may not have been accurate during that period of time that the credit report went out, but yet you underwrote your insurance policy or health coverage, which means they are paying a higher premium. Another question: I am going to try to get all my questions in all at once. What effect does it have on our seniors? A lot of our seniors right now, when you look at their credit ratings, a lot of them get their checks once a month, there are adjustments in there, and then the ratings are there. Do we have any studies on the impact on a lot of our seniors? What are their rates compared to someone elses? How are we doing it in terms of geographical areas on the credit scores? People who live within certain geographical areas get a higher score versus individuals who do not live in those geographical areas, based on the high risk? Therefore, their premiums are a lot higher, yet their income does not change, but they are being impacted. When does the insurance company review the credit scores, after the initial purpose, or do they make adjustments in the ratings at one period or another, so this way the rates can also be lowered? If there are two individuals who get a credit score, husband and wife, say one or the other gets a higher score than the other. How is it underwritten, based on whom? The higher score or the lower score, or is there an adjustment in between? All three of you can tackle all of these questions. Mr. McRaith. I will do my best to answer them quickly. Congressman, first of all, in terms of financial literacy, the States are committed to improving the literacy of consumers. Mr. Baca. States are committed, but do we know that they are really doing that? In a lot of minority areas, do they really know they have gotten a credit score based on their automobile or their health bill that will be coming up right now because we are saying we want to make it affordable, but ``affordable'' means you have to have a good score as well. If you do not have a good score, you are going to be paying a higher premium on that health coverage. Mr. McRaith. We absolutely have to do it better than we are doing it right now. I think this hearing illustrates all the reasons for that. I would point out I am not sure knowledge of the impact of a credit score affects whether someone is able to pay their medical expenses. Literacy is one component. It is not necessarily going to put the dollars in someone's pocket to help them pay during a difficult time in their lives. Mr. Baca. No, but if a score is given, that means their premiums are higher. That makes a big difference based on if you have a fixed income as a senior, that impacts me, because today I have to decide whether I pay for groceries, pay my rent or pay for my insurance policy. Mr. McRaith. That is exactly right. That gets to your last question, the impact on seniors and other people with fixed incomes. We also hear from the disabled community, of course. They are on fixed incomes. Under Illinois law and under many States' laws, individuals who do not have credit records are to be treated as ``neutral.'' What exactly ``neutral'' means varies from State to State. It largely means they do not get a benefit of a great credit history and they do not get penalized for having a negative credit history. By and large, that is how people on fixed incomes are treated. Mr. Baca. But that is not a standardized process or procedure that is used in other States. It is only in Illinois. Mr. McRaith. No, that is generally the practice across the country, not in every State, but it is generally the practice. In terms of geography and credit scores, I believe different studies have shown that different parts of your district, for example, will generally have higher credit scores. Again, we have heard today higher credit scores result in lower insurance premiums. Chairman Gutierrez. The time of the gentleman has expired. Congressman Hensarling, you are recognized for 5 minutes, sir. Mr. Hensarling. That was quick, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gutierrez. A triangle has three corners. Five minutes has those many seconds, unfortunately. Mr. Hensarling. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I did not know we would be getting a geometry lesson here as well. I will beg the forgiveness of our witnesses. I missed your testimony trying to straddle two meetings. I am one of the Republican appointees to the President's Fiscal Responsibility Commission. We have our work cut out for us. I was attending some of those proceedings. We may cover some ground that has already been covered and I apologize to you about that. I guess the central question I have with regards to the use of credit scores in insurance ratings, clearly, there are those who feel this is predictive. Otherwise, I do not understand why they would be using it, but particularly as I look at the incredibly high unemployment rate that remains in our country, how important is it to small insurers and small businesses that they be able to use credit-based insurance scores? In your dealings in the marketplace, again, your observation, how important is it to small businesses and small insurers? Why don't we start with you, Mr. Snyder? Mr. Snyder. I think it is very important. I think the use of credit-based insurance scores in the personal lines of insurance has proven to be very important for the market. It has allowed a degree of objective and individually tailored decision making that more accurately assesses risk than was possible before. The risk assessment is good in and of itself because how else would you price an insurance product but to reflect the risk within that product, and the danger of moving away from that, I think we have seen perhaps too much of in other sectors. Secondly, it has had an overall positive availability impact on the market for personal lines. That would be true if you are an individual. In commercial lines, credit information has long been used because everyone understands that one of the first things that is reduced is maintenance of critical equipment and other things like that, and that leads to safety issues, which in turn leads to increased insurance risks. I think it is important up and down the line in terms of assessing for risk and then pricing for risk. Mr. Hensarling. How many years of history do we have now to observe as far as the use of credit scores in our credit-based insurance scores? Mr. Snyder. In personal lines, about 15 years or so. Mr. McRaith. 1993. Mr. Hensarling. Thank you. It is a fairly substantial time period. Mr. McRaith? Mr. McRaith. Just to build on Mr. Snyder's comment, Illinois has more insurance companies competing for personal lines insurance than any other State. We have seen some of those smaller companies able to compete because of their ability to accurately price. They state the reason they can accurately price is the credit-based insurance scores. Mr. Hensarling. I personally have not seen it, has not come across my desk, have there been any studies that would indicate kind of the overall economic impact that is derived from credit-based insurance scores? Is there something like that out there that has crossed your desks? Mr. Snyder. There is some data. Professor Powell may have some data which we can provide to you. He testified previously before Congress last session. We have a report that proves the reverse, which is we have very good data about California where credit-based insurance scores have not been permitted, that loss costs went down dramatically, but because of the absence of free market pricing, the prices that were actually charged in the market lagged the downturn in loss costs, because companies simply could not go through the very elaborate process that you have to go through there. I think there is strong evidence-- Mr. Hensarling. What happened in California? Mr. Snyder. What happened in California is that you have a situation with massive cross subsidies, a very inefficient system with a huge overhead cost, and for many years and I think now, overall prices that would be lower if the free market were permitted. Mr. Hensarling. If we were to somehow restrict the use of credit scores in insurance pricing, what you see in California, would you predict might spread nationwide? Mr. Snyder. I think that is right. Chairman Gutierrez. The time of the gentleman has expired. Congresswoman Waters is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. Waters. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I was just going over some information with my staff. I want to thank you for holding this hearing. I wish that we could get at some of the information that is so desperately needed to try and understand how decisions are made to determine insurance rates, and what is taken into consideration. From everything that I can gather, there may be 500 different variables that are taken into consideration. We just do not know and understand what that is all about. I am told that all kinds of studies are done, including studies about your Zodiac sign. Let me just raise the question: How many variables are taken into consideration by members of the Association for determining insurance rates? I will address that question to Mr. David Snyder, who is the vice president and associate general counsel for the American Insurance Association. Mr. Snyder. Thank you, Ms. Waters. That will differ from insurer to insurer. There are dozens of variables that are considered. Many different credit variables, as well as other variables, such as prior loss experience. In automobile insurance, make and model of car. In homeowner's insurance, prior loss experience, proximity to a fire station, and on and on. The whole effort is to try to combine these factors, to be as accurate as possible in predicting future risk of loss and therefore, pricing for it. Ms. Waters. Do you think it would be helpful to set some standards so that people can have a good understanding about what is taken into consideration no matter what insurance company you go to, rather than having all of these variables that are not identified in any insurance policy that I know of, to tell people how the decision was made? Should we have some standards? Mr. Snyder. There are general legal standards, but to encourage competition in the market, the models and the variables are all subject to insurance commissioner review on a State by State basis. That is the system that has been followed, general legal standards, and then allowing the companies to innovate and experiment, and subject to both legal standards and actuarial standards. Ms. Waters. Have members of your Association done their own studies? There is not one, two, three, four or five studies every year done by the Association or do they all do different studies? Mr. Snyder. For anti-trust reasons, the Association cannot discuss how individual companies do their business. I am very aware they are constantly reviewing their data, constantly reviewing their factors, constantly subject to insurance commissioner review on their models and programs and the factors used in them. Ms. Waters. What is the difference between defending the fact that they all use variables unknown and different for competitive purposes and the question that I just asked about the studies? Do you know something about that? You can talk about that but you cannot talk about the studies. What is the difference? Mr. Snyder. I can talk about generally from published reports what the companies have said in the media, but they do not share with us-- Ms. Waters. Any of the companies using the Zodiac study? Mr. Snyder. Excuse me? Ms. Waters. Are any of the companies in your Association using the Zodiac study? Mr. Snyder. Using which study, ma'am? I am sorry. Ms. Waters. Zodiac. Mr. Snyder. Zodiac study? Ms. Waters. Yes. Are you aware of that? Mr. Snyder. I am not aware of it. Ms. Waters. Never heard of it? Mr. Snyder. I have not. Ms. Waters. Thank you. Do you believe that given the way decisions are made by insurance companies to charge or to not insure--is the Association satisfied that your companies in the Association are acting in the best interest of the consumers? Mr. Snyder. Yes, so far as we know. Ms. Waters. Do you know of any changes that you would recommend that should be taking place to have them do a better job of acting on behalf of the consumer"
