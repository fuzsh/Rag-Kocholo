        "text": "‚ÄúDomo arigato, Mr. Roboto!‚Äù has become a popular culture catchphrase. But what is the song ‚ÄúMr. Roboto‚Äù about? And what‚Äôs the story behind this Styx hit?\n\nThe song comes from the band‚Äôs 1982 album Kilroy Was Here. Inspired by real-world controversies in which religious groups accused Styx of satanic messaging, Kilroy Was Here is a rock opera set in a world where rock music is banned.\n\nThe band‚Äôs plan was to show a short film to introduce the album‚Äôs premise. Then, they would come out on stage to play live. ‚ÄúMr. Roboto‚Äù was originally meant as a transitional piece between the film and the show.\n\n‚ÄúI wrote the song because it fits a transitional piece from the backstory movie from our live show to the concert stage,‚Äù Dennis DeYoung told Songfacts. ‚ÄúI never thought it was going to be a hit record‚Äîever.‚Äù\n\nBut hit record it became! Today, the catchphrase ‚ÄúDomo arigato, Mr. Roboto‚Äù (‚ÄúThank you very much, Mr. Roboto‚Äù in Japanese) can be found all over pop culture, including appearances in Austin Powers, Archer, How I Met Your Mother, and The Simpsons.\n\nMaster the Piano YOUR Way üî•\n\nAs a Pianote+ Member, you‚Äôll get access to our 10-step Method, song library, and growing community of piano players just like you.
