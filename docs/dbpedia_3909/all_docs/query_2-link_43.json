        "text": "‘Kilroy Was Here,’ was rock band Styx’s eleventh studio album and its accompanying tour of a rock opera-esque performance complete with an opening short film. The plot of the film and album is of a futuristic fascist society that bans rock music and jails former rock star Robert Orin Charles Kilroy, played by the band’s keyboardist Dennis DeYoung, who escapes by masquerading as a robot guard when he sees a rogue transmission from a young rocker named Jonathan Chance, played by the band’s Tommy Shaw, who wants to bring rock back.\n\nIt was a strange decision to open a live performance with such an experimental concept, and likely audiences were treated to something new-ish; a short film not quite a full rock-opera, but most definitely a departure from the band’s regular performances. Though the album spawned one of Styx’s most popular singles, ‘Mr. Roboto,’ and by itself was largely a success, the ‘Kilroy’ tour ended up being a financial failure and became the last Styx performance with the original line up of Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw, James Young, and finally John and Chuck Panozzo.\n\nThe music video to ‘Mr. Roboto,’ and the minifilm ‘Kilroy Was Here,’ were filmed at the same time and share many similar shots and scenes.\n\nThe experimentation of different media formats to tell an obviously sarcastic society-mocking story reveals that Styx, though mainly DeYoung as this was his brainchild, thought that their audience would possibly be welcome to such a change in the rock performance format, or at the very least be open-minded. The story itself is an obvious criticism of anti-rock activists and Christian fundamentalist groups demonizing rock at the time; the film specifically showing what the future might look like, albeit over exaggerated, if groups like these were to get their way.\n\nLikely the backmasked latin words at the beginning of the track ‘Heavy Metal Poisoning,’ were a nod towards the bill passed in Arkansas that required all records containing backwards messages to be labelled by the manufacturer, a bill heavily influenced by anti-rock organizations.\n\nThe backwards latin is “annuit cœptis, novus ordo seclorum” translating to “[he/she/it] has favored our undertakings, a new order of the ages,” which are mottos that can be found on the opposite side of a U.S. dollar bill in the ‘Great Seal of the United States,’\n\nStyx tried to tell one story through three different mediums: Music, Film, and Stage Performance. However, the only part of the work that saw some sort of perceived success was the album, which debuted at #10 on the Billboard 200 in its first week and sold more than a million copies. The tour, on the other hand, is well documented as being a financial disaster. It’s possible that fans of Styx weren’t completely on-board with the new direction their sound was taking, or that the heavy anti “anti-rock” stance Styx was taking maybe didn’t connect as well with their audience as they hoped.\n\nRegardless, it’s important to understand that without the short film and stageshow fans of this particular album aren’t getting the complete story by just listening to the music. Too often we let music into our lives superficially without attempting to understand it completely, and in this case to fully experience the artists’ intended meaning of the piece we must also experience it through film and stage.\n\nSarah O’Heeron\n\nWord Count (Including Sources): 604\n\nSources"
