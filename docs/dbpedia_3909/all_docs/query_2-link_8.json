        "text": "This is a sign that i'd seen before in treasure hunting, but only recently identified it, as well as identifying the history (purpose) behind this Kilroy sign.\n\nThis sign became quite popular during WW II. The troops saw this sign EVERYWHERE......they even wondered just how-the-hell Kilroy could get around to so many places.....leaving his \"signature\" logo.\n\nTruth is, as our troops went to the Pacific to fight Japan, the elite knew that our troops would run across this sign...over and over and over and over again. So, in order to whitewash the MEANINGS of theTRUE SIGNS that these troops would come across, this very same symbol that says \"a tunnel opening is nearby\" was adapted as Kilroy...to make the troops \"laugh it off\" as a joke.\n\nOur troops no doubt ran across this Kilroy signs again and again and again. These islands are very rich iin Pirate treasure rooms, and the treasure signs are FOUND EVERYWHERE.\n\nBut, instead of looking for this concealed opening when this sign was found, the soldiers laughed it off and wondered....\"How the hell does Kilroy get around like that?\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_was_here\n\n\"Other sources suggest that Foo was a man that was inspecting the welds in submarines.[citation needed] He had to crawl inside small spaces to do this, his superiors were wondering if he was doing his job so everywhere that Foo went he would write \"Foo was here\". This has been found on the wreckage of many subs and ships. This trend soon caught on.\"\n\nNever heard of 'Foo was here' found in wreckage of submarines and ships before- anyone have a REAL citation of such a thing or is this a random humorous wikicism?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Kilroy\n\nMaybe this is the citation meant even though it isn't a Foo but a Kilroy.\n\nThe website (Quincy's Shipbuilding Heritage) on the history of the Qunicy shipyard where Kilroy was employed reads;\n\n\"One of the most interesting stories to come out of the war is that of \"Kilroy was here.\" The \"Kilroy was here\" phrase appeared everywhere during World War II, but its origin did not become widely known until after the war had ended. In 1946 the American Transit Association ran a contest to find out where and why the phrase originated. As it turned out, the winner was James J. Kilroy of Boston. It seems as if Kilroy was hired by Fore River shipyard on December 5, 1941 as a checker. His job was to count the rivet holes and then leave chalk marks where he had left off. It was on this basis that the riveter's piece of work was calculated. Some of the riveters were not too honest and would erase the mark left by Kilroy. Thus, some of the rivet holes were counted twice. Kilroy got wind of this devious practice and proceeded to scrawl \"Kilroy was here\" on his rounds. He reportedly left his mark on such famous Fore River vessels as the battleship, Massachusetts, now berthed permanently at \"Battleship Cove\", Fall River, Massachusetts, the Carrier, Lexington (II), and the heavy cruiser, Baltimore, as well as numerous troop carriers. In later life Kilroy became a Boston City Councillor and state representative. He died on November 26, 1962.\"\n\nThe New York Times of 24 December 1946 read:\n\n\"During the war he [James J Kilroy] was employed at the Bethlehem Steel Company&#8217;s Quincy shipyard, inspecting tanks, double bottoms and other parts of warships under construction. To satisfy superiors that he was performing his duties, Mr. Kilroy scribbled in yellow crayon &#8216;Kilroy was here&#8217; on inspected work. Soon the phrase began to appear in various unrelated places, and Mr. Kilroy believes the 14,000 shipyard workers who entered the armed services were responsible for its subsequent world-wide use.\"\n\nSo, if the first article has its date correct, any sightings before December 1941 would mean James Kilroy was not the originator (although he might still have caused its popularity).\n\nThose ships that Kilroy supposedly annotated - any evidence for when they were built and if the phrase was actually seen on them?"
