        "text": "''By order of the Majority for Musical Morality, this album contains secret backward messages,'' reads the sticker on the cover of the new Styx album, ''Kilroy Was Here'' (A&M SP-3734). Photos on the back and the inner sleeve of the album are taken from a 10-minute movie featuring members of the group. The film is an integral part of the Chicago-based rock quintet's new show, which comes to City Center for four nights, starting March 31.\n\nIn the film, James Young, Styx's 33-year-old lead guitarist, plays Dr. Everett Righteous, a demagogue who turns his own cable network into a potent political base. Blaming society's ills on rock music, Dr. Righteous and his organization, the Majority for Musical Morality (MMM) gain enough power to have rock music banned in America. Any similarities between the MMM and the Moral Majority are not purely coincidental.\n\n''Kilroy Was Here'' is the brainchild of Dennis DeYoung, Styx's 36-year-old senior member, keyboardist, lead singer, and writer of most of the group's hits. Mr. DeYoung plays Robert Kilroy, a famous rock star who is falsely accused of murdering a protester at an MMM rally and sent to prison. Tommy Shaw, Styx's other guitarist, plays Jonathan Chance, the underground leader who contacts Kilroy and helps him escape. Chuck and John Panozzo, the twin brothers who make up Styx's rhythm section, play characters named Lieut. Vanish and Col. Hyde.\n\nAlthough the comic book scenario for ''Kilroy Was Here'' seems farfetched and simplistic, it contains a kernel of seriousness. In the last two years, Styx has been targeted by fundamentalist religious groups for the ''backward masking'' of satanic messages on its albums. Backward masking means the recording of subliminally perceived messages that can only be deciphered when a record is played backward. At the height of the Beatles' psychedelic period, the rumor of Paul McCartney's death was fueled by the message, supposedly backwardly coded on the sound collage, ''Revolution No. 9,'' ''Turn me on, dead man.'' Since then, many other groups have played with the notion of coding cryptic backward messages that the devoted listener could then detect by rotating a disk backward by hand.\n\nThe idea that such messages might be sinister has gained currency only in recent years, with the rise of fundamentalist Christian fringe groups. Far-fetched as their crusade against rock seems, it has nevertheless gained enough credence to inspire local legislation. On Feb. 3, 1983, the Arkansas State Senate passed a bill, by 86 to 0, requiring that all records containing backward masking be labeled as such by the manufacturer. Cited in the legislation were albums by the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Electric Light Orchestra, Queen, and Styx.\n\nThe Majority for Musical Morality sticker on the cover of ''Kilroy Was Here'' is Styx's response to the charges of satanism. And on one cut, the James Young song ''Heavy Metal Poisoning,'' Styx has indeed backward masked a cryptic-sounding Latin message, ''annuit coeptis novus ordo seclorum,'' which happens to be the inscription on the Great Seal of the United States.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
