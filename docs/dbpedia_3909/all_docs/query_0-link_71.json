They scrawled the walls of their schoolyard with spray paint: “The people want the fall of the regime” and “Your turn is coming, doctor,” in reference to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe words started a war.\n\nSyrian security forces made an example of the children, detaining and torturing them for more than a month. In the wake of their release, what began as a local protest movement morphed into an international conflict that still rages today, leaving hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced. Their words were the first, but certainly not the last, protest painted on the walls of Syria’s civil war.\n\nOver decades and even centuries of conflict, political art has become part of the landscape of war. Graffiti is, by definition, an act of defiance, and as political art, it’s especially suited to battle. Graffiti goes up quickly and leaves a bold mark, even after authorities destroy the evidence.\n\nWhere they don’t, the art remains — a proud and painful reminder of a shared history of violence and strength.\n\nOur history of writing on walls in times of war is long and storied.
