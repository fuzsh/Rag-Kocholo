        "text": "Left: Los Angeles Wastoid With an Idea for a Book He Says Will Be a Guaranteed Bestseller If He Ever Writes It After Figuring Out How to Connect the Beginning to the End (2015) • Right: Vampire Weekend’s Tour Manager Trying to Get in on a Toast for Someone He Doesn’t Know at a Party Too Loud for His Sensibilities (2019)\n\nDo you know how insanely out of whack your existence has to be for you to huck half your wardrobe, scoop reading glasses you’ve needed for years, and put together three calendars in order to keep track of all the things you always wanted to do but never did?\n\nLet me back up.\n\nIn January, I was coming apart at the seams, so I decided to rework myself and the world around me — I quit drinking, I started weekly therapy, I took a hiatus from drugs, I upped my exercise routine, I made a point of getting a good night’s rest, and so on. In February, I reflected on my progress and wrote about it here: I’m Trying to Not Be an Out of Control Mess This Year — and It’s Working. In March, I made the experiment more blood than air, ensuring my life changes were practical, not just theoretical. Now it’s April and I’ve definitely learned five things.\n\nIt takes a good baseline to observe the bad.\n\nDistractions don’t hold the same allure after a break.\n\nSelf-fulfilling prophecies are preventable.\n\nAcknowledgement and acceptance are not the same.\n\nThere’s always time to change.\n\nYou see, this all began a long, long time ago…in a galaxy brain far, far away…\n\nLook, here’s the truth of the matter: I trapped myself at some point.\n\nI couldn’t tell you how, where, or when. I only know the who and the why. Sure, it’d probably make for a better story if I could spot when exactly I ostrich’d reality altogether. In fact, I’d like to believe it was a crucial moment at some house party that I could then spectate like the Dickens as some Ghost of Christmas Time-Is-A-Flat-Circle and catch myself sinking into yours truly like quicksand.\n\nBut it could likely all be boiled down to the fact that I grew up too meticulous and cautious and then eased up in young adulthood, tasting blood on my lip after a lifetime of chapstick, and thus punted control to the thrashing wind and went spinning into the great wild unknown.\n\nAnd a lot of that life was damn crazy fun and soul-enriching good! I said absolutely-hell-yes to a score of adventures as a theatrical goofball who refused to slow down. [I put a score of them into a piece you can read if you’re curious — Once: 100 Moments of a Dunce’s Life.]\n\nHowever, along the way, in parallel, I also created a cycle of distraction, daydream, and destruction. It worked long enough — too long, some would say, including me, which is why any of these words are even here to begin with — and, at the start of this year, I found myself in a rather narrow existential tunnel, a most sudden and drastic realization, which lead to an extremely frantic, panicked escape.\n\nBut escape I did!\n\nHow far I’ve made it from the tunnel has yet to be called. The jury of understudies I call a conscious sucks ass at existential math.\n\nIn reflection, this all sounds like an insane amount of work for someone who lived like this in order to avoid challenges and difficulties, even though hardships and obstacles are a part of…well, everything. So my cunning plan was to basically not fully experience life and the evolution that comes with it, instead cultivating a life largely reliant on ease and instant.\n\nBut now I’m here, somewhere between the tunnel and, like, a homestead of some kind…? I don’t know. I’m still figuring out this analogy. Don’t worry, there’s more ahead.\n\n1. Them bad deals glow big-time hot when the rest of you is all good and at peace.\n\nWhen all is chaos, nothing and everything makes sense. There’s just so much going on you can’t even fathom structure. It’d be like assembling IKEA furniture in the middle of a tornado. So you accept it for the time being and assume the tornado will die down — except you’re the one in charge of the tornado.\n\nLiving rent-free in my own head, my default mantra became “I wish” — a throwaway reasoning I lifted from the great philosopher Skee-Lo, manifesting in everything from “I wish I could save money” to “I wish I was in better shape.” Those magical two words were essentially an easy pat on the back, a liner note to call out that I wanted to get better, that I had a general goal of improvement, that I believed I could evolve; but footnotes don’t exactly make a story. For me, where it all began was exactly where it all ended.\n\nSimply put, it was a fantasy — and I tended to that garden of reverie, those precious fields of delirium, because it was easier than replanting the entirety of my estate.\n\nThis subconscious decision would, of course, prove unideal. In no way does living in an unreality suit you better in the long run. For the most part, detachment is a coping mechanism; it’s not emotional life insurance. And the longer it went on, the more parts of me came unconnected given the speed and lack of maintenance. I got away from myself.\n\nWhen I became (wildly) untethered, brought on by a habitual penchant for instant gratification that was unwisely paired with self-destructive tendencies and a season or two of self-loathing, them lively, vibrant cords that formerly connected my core — a complex and firmly held mass of beliefs, principles, and values — to the rest of my existence — extensive avenues of emotional processing and hearty communication, well-founded methods of pursuing rich moments of joy and obtaining a deeper sense of contentment, robust operating systems to deal with disappointment and grief, and the like — went flying. They whipped in the bellowing wind of my extraordinary, labyrinthine cavern.\n\nWho I was at my core had been buried, lost to the sands of everything from diversion to rage. So now I’m in the midst of an archeological dig and these analogies might be a plague.\n\nSee, when you lose a connection to your core, your emotions, decisions, and reactions become surface level. They devolve and decay. They turn primitive. You maneuver in remarkably shallow terms, since there’s no source to a deeper, richer well. The scale of what you have to offer is therefore shortened, so frustration can easily erode into fury, disappointment can breezily melt into despair, and on and on until your emotions are essentially grouped together and you come to solely operate in the eight basic colors when you were once an entire glorious spectrum. You more or less remove the concept of complexity from your emotional range.\n\nIn a sense, it’s childish. In another sense, it’s reallychildish. Allow me to expand on this because this is my essay and I have all the time in the world.\n\nLet’s say your emotional range as a kid is 1–10. Every adjustment of your world has the potential to feel dramatic. That’s why each change can matter so much; there’s only so much your brain can recognize and process. Ice cream can throw you from a low number to a high one and it feels sweeping. When your entire scale is 1–10, going from a 3 to an 8 feels like a swift arrival of euphoria.\n\nNow, if you’re proactive about your emotional development, the scale evolves. So let’s say, as an adult, your emotional range is more like 1–100. Maybe ice cream still increases your happiness by five points, but going from 70 to 75 isn’t huge. It’s a noticeable spring in your step, but it doesn’t exactly turn your life around.\n\nSo you have to work at the scale and maintain it. What that means and how it manifests is different to everyone. I more or less neglected mine and, in turn, it shrunk.\n\nBeing centered is important because, ideally, you cultivate what you believe to be the best of you and that hopefully fuels your entire being. It’s not inherently easy and everyone has a different level of skill with it. The work is ongoing and can be strenuous. The level of difficulty has to do with a score of factors, both internal and external, and the quickest way to lose focus is to compare yourself to others. However, that doesn’t mean you’re prevented from admiring others and modeling some aspects of yourself after them. That’s actually a good starting point in my opinion.\n\nAll this to say, reattaching the different parts of me has felt like my existence has weight again. I know what feels out of place — I catch myself using too many words when less words would do because I had trouble sleeping the night before, I feel less confident in my decisions because I’m sluggish after not eating right, I feel negative about something I shouldn’t because I’ve been on the go and therefore haven’t exercised much.\n\nPreviously, as my only resident head-dweller, I took everything as immediate. Any emotion was genuine and well-founded because my world was all-encompassing and on my terms. When you’re that far in your head, things shift in your favor. Of course you’re in the right! Of course this! Of course that! However, perspective matters and there’s distortion on your end, but you’ve come to believe the fuzz is just part of the picture.\n\nThe gut isn’t always instinct; the heart isn’t always truth; sometimes it’s all just noise. [Please enjoy these post-rock album titles that I have sprinkled throughout.]\n\n2. Dealing with the bunk bogusness can prove more gateway than diversion.\n\nAll my lively new year/not spaced energy had to go somewhere — and it’s turned out to be everywhere. From writing to running to meditating to organizing get-togethers, I’m being proactive and productive, rather than reactive, in a way I’ve never been before. I’m veryhere — yet somehow not as noisy…curious—and I’m becoming more instinctive about separating problem and solution.\n\nThere’s a lot I can’t control in this life. But I can control how I deal with it.\n\nFor instance, in February, my father was diagnosed with cancer for the second time. It was the first big challenge for My Big New Brain™ in the matter of dealing with a Giant Fuck That™ entirely out of my control. I couldn’t cure cancer and I had no intention of funneling my energy into the languishing flatline hymn of “I wish (my dad didn’t have cancer).” I therefore informed my therapist that my dad’s cancer may impact my emotional stability and decision-making process, but I didn’t have much to share beyond that in sessions. It wouldn’t be fruitful to complain for an hour. Finally, I recognized my father’s cancer as a dominating presence in my attention range and I allowed myself to dedicate a session shortly before his surgery to getting all the worry and concern out of my system. [Twist: There was a lot.] But even that felt like control. I didn’t let it consume me. I treated the growing dread with patience and awareness.\n\nI had no intention of retreating to my old “fixer” ways —where you basically trial-and-error any given thing until you pretty much smother it — because belligerently texting and calling my dad like some high school crush would’ve felt like final days (when they weren’t). So I checked in with him a reasonable amount, organized a family game day, set up a dinner with my folks, and hyped the good sir’s poetry. [That final effort transformed into friends and family scooping his poetry collections like whoa, thus sending him into the surgery with good vibes. I wrote about it here: Why I Asked Everyone to Read My Dad’s Poetry When His Cancer Returned.]\n\nThese were all methods of dealing with life’s bad turns and a general lack of control. Sitting at home wishing things were different does nothing. If anything, it only presents an alternate reality that’s so alluring you think about it more than your actual present — and doing just that is how this whole journey of mine started!\n\nThis continued. Last week, sitting in LA traffic on the way to visit my dad in the hospital, I felt the trying weight of physical exhaustion and emotional depletion while knowing my good-hearted father was laid up with scars and staples like 19th-century railroad tracks with my sleepless mom beside him and, hey, fuck that. I got mad. And that would’ve stuck with the old me. I would’ve been wrathful at circumstance — the wily bastard, always doing things and presenting situations! — and there would’ve been no route for me to go but stay there and be irate.\n\nAnd. That. Is. A. Bonkos. Way. To. Live.\n\nSo I asked myself what I could do to improve my mood. Given the seasonal focus on self-improvement, a recent activity I found exciting and rewarding, I concentrated on that.\n\nThus, in dead-stop traffic, I applied/signed up to volunteer with three local organizations — Big Brothers & Big Sisters of Orange County, Pacific Marine Mammal Center, and Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County. [This part of my life rework actually began in February, when my friend Scott and I decided to get involved with theOrange County Racial Justice Collaborativeand the ACLU of Southern California.] And it worked. I felt way better. I got excited about deepening my role as an active participant in communal good.\n\nI tell ya, blackout drinking energy manifests in all sorts of wild ways! I never considered myself the I-need-a-drink type because I seamlessly slid in and out of hazes and highs, but maybe those regular, seemingly inevitable disappearances from Earth were forever on my horizon and I was on more crutches than I initially wagered. Because now I’m pretty damn jazzed about exploration and everything I can do. Plus, now that I’m sober with what feels like 40-hour days, I’m assembling a future I’m keen on.\n\nPlanning reveals intent. It’s not like I’ve ever scheduled, “Refresh Twitter for an hour and then go to war with a college sophomore you don’t know in the replies.” Now I have two Google Spreadsheets posing as existential editorial calendars with my friend Chris — one is for weekly creative projects, one is for weekly non-creative to-dos/activities — and I have one calendar for the book and graphic novel I plan to finish each week in order to hit my annual goal of 100 stories. [I haven’t been close in years because some god gave me juvenile delinquent eyes that went wonky years back and I only got around to fixing up this spiritual season. More on that later.]\n\nI’m writing more than I have in years, I’m expanding my creative output like hell, I’m making my way through cookbooks that have sat on my kitchen shelf, and I’m running like Postfontaine. [Prefontaine was in primo shape and I ain’t there yet. I’ve lost 15 pounds with sobriety, but all my muscles are in my legs and brain.] Anyway, the point is I’m making bad stuff good and good stuff great and god are these analogies somehow getting worse.\n\n3. Self-fulfilling prophecies are basically hoaxes you make real, which is not as hilarious as you think.\n\nOnce of the wildest things my therapist has ever asked me is this: “Do you have any reason to believe that?”\n\nSure, such a casual three-flies-up huck of basic curiosity is more akin to something a dork like me would’ve scrawled on his notebook to impress smart girls back in fifth grade after reading exactly one book by Madeleine L’Engle, but this question honestly struck me like a drunken grandfather clock. It uppercutted me so bad, in fact, that I had to actually ask, “What do you mean?”\n\nOf course, she meant, HEY, DO YOU HAVE ANY TANGIBLE EVIDENCE THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS HAPPENING IS ACTUALLY WHAT IS HAPPENING?\n\nAnd, obviously, after the layabouts I have the nerve to declare brain cells glanced at each other with wishy-washy brain-celly eyes and collectively shrugged their brain-celly shoulders, I answered, “No, I guess not.”\n\nSuch a revelation was liberating! Holy shit, did that free up my haunted house of a head — like I hit it with a flashlight and the buggos went scurrying (hopefully not to plague someone else’s brain because aw sads) — and it should’ve been how my mind worked goddamn years ago.\n\n[I will likely, at least for a while, keep repeating “and it should’ve been how my mind worked goddamn years ago.” I want to cheer myself on while simultaneously reminding myself that, in my own humble opinion of yours truly, I’m catching up, not pioneering. I mean, I got a degree in print journalism — *in 2008* — so, you know, take anything I say here with a grain of salt.]\n\nIt turns out you can fear something so much and so bad that it wholly and unforgivably consumes you. It’s so dramatically in focus as the destination you don’t want to visit that you find yourself heading toward it. Then you get there and you unsurprisingly hate it, and yet never take to asking, “How could this have happened when it was literally the only thing I thought about?”\n\nDon’t self-sabotage.≠ Be your best self.\n\nFor years, I have been a dusty archive of warnings whereas now I’m, like, some modern museum of motivations. [I’m still getting used to optimistic analogies, so I figure I’m going to sound like a beach house kitchen sign of cursive on reclaimed driftwood for a spell. Bear with me because we all need to live, laugh, and love, folks.]\n\nI’d long taken to framing my personal narrative as what would probablyhappen because that’s what usuallyhappened or because that’s what I thoughtwould happen (or both!). So I’d defeatedly resign to what I believed was inevitable and be not-exactly-blown-away by my fear becoming actualized. “I saw this coming,” I’d say to a whole lot of no one. “I am a genius.”\n\nEVERYONE CAN SEE THE PROBLEM HERE; YES EVEN ME NOW.\n\nThe problem is that you can clearly obsess about an outcome until you “accidentally” ensure it. You essentially come to recognize patterns without source. You see what you usually happens and you take it at face value because you’ve seen it before. And yet you don’t go back to the first time it happened. You don’t see how the dominos were kicked over. You just behold the mess and I just fucking can’t with these analogies anymore; please, someone take my fingers away from me.\n\n4. Acknowledgement vs. Acceptance is the battle of the century but maybe it doesn’t have to be.\n\nAcknowledgement is in passing. Acceptance is head on.\n\nIn years past, I would acknowledge certain qualities about myself as unideal — punctuality, everyone I know screamed at once, before clearing their throat and rolling out the entirety of their Times New Roman scroll — but these were brisk tips of the hat to an untrustworthy character. Once I accepted them, they became tangible pieces of actionable change. They went from what I saw to what I could do.\n\nI was like that dumb fucking mayor from Jaws; I acknowledged the shark, but I didn’t accept the situation’s seriousness and thus close the beach right away.\n\nTo me, a man potentially and clinically addicted to unnecessary analogies, it’s the difference between driving by and pulling over. Acknowledgement is what I see out the window; acceptance is what I consider the destination.\n\nSee, acknowledgement leans too easily on a sense of temporariness, that the bunk quality is a part of you, sure, and…shrug. It’s mentioned as a clarifier — I’m bad with punctuality, I’m bad with money, I’m bad with vulnerability — but it’s treated as more of a disclaimer rather than the beginning of a new chapter.\n\nHell yes I’m saying shit like “new chapter” now. Watch me move to Sedona and sell CDs and turquoise jewelry, you hip city wastoids, with your pedestrian buckleless belts and your decade-late arrival to the aisle that sells goji berries.\n\nThe above are three random personal examples.\n\nI’ve gotten better at punctuality.I actually used to always be 10–15 minutes early or right on time growing up. [I was raised to be an insufferable dork nurtured on manners alone.] At some point, I didn’t like waiting — and sometimes extreme punctuality comes off as a flex, a notion that was veryunintentional coming from a gangly question factory such as myself — so I began showing up fashionably late. Then I couldn’t pull out of it. Then I couldn’t be on time for literally anything.\n\nI’ve gotten better at money. OH MY GOD YOU BASICALLY BECOME A FINANCIAL GENIUS WHEN YOU STOP DRINKING AND NO ONE HAS TO TAKE YOUR CREDIT CARD AWAY FROM YOU AFTER A WEDDING RECEPTION IN DOWNTOWN SANTA ANA BECAUSE YOU’RE TRYING TO BUY ROUNDS FOR STRANGERS — so that’s been good. Also, being of sound mind and choosing order over chaos helps.\n\nI’ve gotten better at vulnerability. This has honestly been strange, surprising exploration for me. I’m a huge fan of vulnerability — more conceptually than personally as it turns out. I think people should be vulnerable! It’s healthy! It makes sense to be your most earnest self! But I’ve more or less unearthed that I resent the actual sensation of feeling vulnerable. I grew up overly empathetic and thus often unguarded, and as a teenager I developed a compulsion to always appear fine that got away from me in adulthood. I figured I was wildly capable of dealing with myself — that if I wasn’t fine, I wasn’t doing my job as Human Being. Yet, in the last two months, I’ve been significantly more open about where I’m at — mentally and emotionally — and, holy shit, it’s less exhausting by a fucking miracle mile. Those in my life are understanding rather than sympathetic. [This is exactly the response I want, because I can also tend to read sympathy as too within range of pity, something else to unpack and work on.] But I used to lowball the enormity of an issue until the problem disappeared or I moved on — thus continuing to carry it with me. But now look at me! Look at this essay! It’s like I’m the mayor of Vulnerable City! [And I’m way better than that fucking mayor from Jaws. Like, seriously, wasn’t he still the mayor in the second one? I mean, holy shit, Amity.]\n\nRepeat something enough times and it becomes true — to you anyway, and that can make all the difference. Inspect specific traits within you. If you like them, keep them. If you don’t, ask what it would take to change them. Go from there. I did and now look at me; I’m 6’4”.\n\n5. Everyone should be evaluating their existence all the time.\n\nOn St. Patrick’s Day, after nearly two months of sobriety, I decided to have a whiskey on the rocks at a cast party for a play about King Kong that I somehow wound up in for nine weeks. [Okay, so things have really changed for me this year.]\n\nAfter a season of practicing mindfulness, all while living the driest I’d been since 17 years old, it felt strange to feel myself drifting out of a moment. It wasn’t an out-of-body experience, but I could tell my brain and body were separating a bit. Internally, it was akin to getting buzzed for the first time as a teen all over again, continually asking, “Is this what I would be saying if I were sober? Is this what I would be doing if I were sober? Where is Katie McNamara? Is she here? Oh my god, what if this is my chance? Is one crazy night enough to turn it all around?”\n\nOkay, so the line of questioning didn’t devolve that hard into youthful resurgence. Instead, I reached the only question that mattered: “Do I even like this?”\n\nBut that wasn’t the first time I’d asked this question. I had spent weeks asking that question, about everything from home decor to my phone background. I just kept strolling through my existence asking, “Do I even like this?”\n\n[Of course, it eventually dawned on me that I was basically ripping off Marie Kondo’s “Does it spark joy?” I just added a dour western ‘tude that made the question decidedly more poised for potential desertion.]\n\nI looked at everything anew — emotions, hobbies, relationships, personality traits, lamps; you name it, I interrogated it. Once I had a clear mind, my existence looked significantly different and I had a lot of new opinions about it. I was ready to deconstruct everything.\n\nBut it all started with getting dressed.\n\nOne Saturday morning with zero plans for the day — save for the play that night, as it turned out to be a good time to become a self-improving recluse; ‘twas metamorphosis! — I stared at my open closet and asked the inevitable: “Do I even like this?”\n\nWell, the answer was a resounding FUCKING NO, I’VE MADE THAT STUPID “I DRESS LIKE AN EIGHTH GRADER WITH A GROWTH DISEASE” FOR YEARS AND THESE CLOTHES AREN’T WHAT I WANT TO ADORN MY ONLY BODY. So, after thinking deeper about this category (that I deal with every single day of my life) for all of ten seconds, I yanked out half my wardrobe and stashed three bags of clothes in my car to donate.\n\nIn an instant, I realized that, for many years, I bought or inherited clothes I found agreeable in a style I deemed my wheelhouse. I had a handful of favorite outfits and everything else was a shrug to wear. Clothes were more or less utility to me, a fact that should’ve become extremely more obvious to me when American Express called to see if my credit card had been stolen after buying a single new outfit.\n\nSo last month I went shopping like a motherfucker. It was a whole goddamn montage. I had shopping bags. I was spinning. I was screaming, “HE’S GONNA MAKE IT AFTER ALL.” I returned stuff. I told ’em nothing was wrong with the shirt, that I just got carried away. They understood. I moved on with my life. I looked fucking fresh.\n\nFrom there, realizing I was now who I wanted to be on the outside — most notably with an odd enthusiasm for capris, high waters, and minor league baseball pants — I had to ask who I wanted to be on the inside. [Goddamn, I sound like the delinquent second chance of Mr. Rogers’s grandson.]\n\nSo I assembled a word doc that was basically a ridiculous lineup of desired qualities.\n\nI want to be someone who bakes.\n\nI want to be someone who is patient.\n\nI want to be someone who volunteers.\n\nI want to be someone who can do basic woodworking.\n\nI want to be someone who has gone skydiving.\n\nI want to be someone who knows how a fucking engine works.\n\nOkay, the last one’s on there, but I added the swear here because it’s been on my to-do list for a decade and a half.\n\nDo I sound like a body snatcher? Hell yes I do, but otherwise it’s just little notes floating about a study with the windows open. I want to be a million things!\n\nBut it’s hard to really sum it all up on a whim. It’s like how you’re a complex being and you have all sorts of dreams and ideas and you interpret the world with robust consideration and you build and strengthen relationships and you enjoy so very many things in life and then someone asks you to describe yourself and you barf the tiniest, “I don’t know, I think I’m pretty nice?”\n\nSo I made a list.\n\nAfter you catch up to yourself, like some fugitive who’s been on the run for a decade-plus, you have to do some digging into the past. What were all those things you wanted to be and do?\n\nThis all sounds bonkers, but I’ve already noticed changes.\n\nI say little to nothing I regret. This sounds impossibly easy. It was not. I had trouble with silence. Combine that with my subconscious “fixer” solutions, and I spoke/texted every joke or conversation extender that popped into my manic, feverish brain. Guess what? A whole lot of it wasn’t thought out. Guess who didn’t always like what I said? A whole lot of people (including me).\n\nI make decisions I agree with. Again, this sounds impossible easy. But instant gratification means sabotaging long-term rewards. Now it feels like a superpower to simply think I shouldn’t snack at work and then actually follow suit. On the shield of old me, there was probably a banner of Latin reading, “I Know I Shouldn’t; Oh, But I Must.”\n\nI move slower. Given that I was formerly horrendous at time management and eternally trying to distract myself with as much as humanly possible, I moved with freneticism. It no longer looks like I’m in a hurry to literally everywhere and everything, although I do still have these cursed-ass long legs and nobody under 6’0” appreciates that. I take my time. This in turn has caused me to drop and break less. It’s a win for everyone.\n\nI wear reading glasses now. Holy shit, this change is absolutely the most indicative on me putting things off. I was so in my own world that I didn’t get glasses. I just strained my eyes instead, procrastinating the task of g-e-t-t-i-n-g g-l-a-s-s-e-s — as a f u c k i n g w r i t e r. Now I’m reading in bed again rather than dicking around on my phone and thus elongating my attention span, that should in turn make me more ready for new skills!\n\nWith all these changes, I return to a quote, a passage, and a moment.\n\nQuote: My therapist gave me a sentence that immediately replaced my old mantra: “You can only control your thoughts, your feelings, and your behavior.”\n\nPassage:In Still Life With Woodpecker, a book I once held instead of the Bible as a secular minister, Tom Robbins wrote: “It’s never too late to have a happy childhood.”\n\nMoment: One night, I found myself on a dinghy with my friends Chase and Rex, drifting aimlessly in San Diego Bay, 21 years old and wildly drunk on cheap rum. We were arguing about superpowers and I made the pitch that any choice of superpower was a reveal of real-life weakness. [e.g. You choose flying because you feel trapped.] “So what’s yours?” I informed them that mine’s always been time travel because my greatest weakness is regret. [I know, I’ve been like this forever.] Neither of them stood for this. I, naturally, pitched having my cake and eating it too. “It doesn’t work like that.” Ultimately, they convinced me that every moment influences who you are in the moments that follow, whether it’s the next day or the next decade. You don’t get to choose what made you who you are and as much as I’d like to have gotten here sooner and have done so without crashing my mind, body, and spirit, that sounds like “I wish” and I ain’t going back to that life. You change when you’re ready.\n\nAs much there stays within me a small desire to add an addendum of “but better early than late” to the age-old adage “Better late than never,” this is the very nature of change. You cannot force it. You should not lament it. I am, in every sense of the word, forbiddenfrom changing the past and therefore it is out of my control, and so I can only use what has happened as insight to guide me from here on out. What I was along the way has made me who I am today and, hey, I’m pretty stoked. Things are good. Things are getting better.\n\nEach moment is a decision. That’s all I got.\n\n[Plus analogies — I just have so many analogies.]\n\n“Proof of Flight” by John Kilroy is available on Amazonand Barnes & Noble. “Torque” is sold out until reprints.\n\nA Lesson in Forbearance From the Forefather\n\n“When can we read it?” I asked.\n\n“When you’re 30,” he said with a laugh.\n\nA pause kicked its heels up between us. I very obviously assumed he was kidding, and then the actuality of waiting more than a decade settled into me. Even though I stayed silent, I definitely thought, “Oh my god, it’s a bunch of poems about you boinking Mom, isn’t it? You pervert. You absolute goddamn pervert.”\n\nBut the good sir had long been a source of wisdom for me, so I rolled with it.\n\nWhen he handed down his ’93 Toyota Tercel to me — a stick-shift whip that eventually became known as The Deathmobile in my hands, among my cohorts— he left boxes of Torquecopies in the trunk. I unearthed the discovery while drinking (what I assume was Goldschläger) and smoking (what I assume was a clove) in the local parking garage with coworkers after a bunk shift at our restaurant gig. The three of them asked what I thought of his work and I told them I respected his wishes for me not to read aforementioned work at present.\n\nYou see, I write myself — just look at all these goddamn words! — and all you ever want is somebodyto read your work. So if you outright ask someone to not read your work, there’s gotta be a pretty good reason.\n\nSo, that summer, my dad began going to poetry readings in the area with my mom, who, in these outings, he would ask to don scarlet headwear. That way, at the end of his set, he could (and certainly would) point to the back and tell the (assumedly captive) audience to find “the woman in the red hat” in order to buy his poetry.\n\nGiven that Torquewas the self-published debut of an unknown poet, sales weren’t what the author had hoped. But the fact it happened at all is damn admirable and practically miraculous in my book.\n\nSee, this was 2002. Back then, even putting together a not-shitty website was some arduous nightmare headache. [I know because I published my own website called Zaftig!in 2004 and wanted to blow up my entire house.] To self-publish an actual book, my dad hired his designer friend to do up the cover and formed a company called Chrome Press. He was the publishing house’s owner and sole employee, unless you count the three teens who began answering the second phone line that suddenly appeared in their wall.\n\nYears passed, the leftover copies of Torquewound up stashed in the garage, and my dad went on with his life, forever writing poems. And — like father, like son — I did the same.\n\nLike Father, Like Son — Like, Forever\n\nI’ve written and been fascinated with poetry my whole life. My poems were, I suppose, salvageable until I was bummed one year in my mid-twenties and used the medium to pull myself out of the funk, and suddenly my poems got a lot better. I discovered a way into myself then that was constructed out of meditative observance instead of reactive and fiery emotional turmoil.\n\nA few years later, at the age of 29, I printed out three poetry chapbooks I made on my home computer and mailed out free copies to anyone who wanted them. A small part of me was likely and unwittingly motivated by knowing I would soon be receiving my copy of Torqueand wanted the world at large to know, as well as myself to some degree, that I had my own way of approaching the medium that wasn’t inherited like an heirloom.\n\nMeanwhile, my dad had offered up Torquea few years early and I politely declined and thus stuck to the originally discussed timetable. [If I had waited this long, what was a few more years? Let’s just make it a curious, extremely final rite of passage, I figured — like how you can’t rent a car until you’re 25.]\n\nSure enough, on my 30th birthday, as I held gifts in my arms and cheesecake in my stomach, about to exit my parents’ house, my dad stopped me with Torquein his hands and a little speech prepared.\n\nThe thoughtful, self-deprecating oration was more or less, “Well, here it is, a book nobody wanted, but also a testament to the spirit of simply doing. I couldn’t figure out how to get people to read it, but maybe this will offer some gems about life and insight into your old man.”\n\nFollowingTorque’s release, this is how my father would come discuss his poetry for the foreseeable future — “Nobody wants to read poetry, not even poets.”\n\nHe went on to explain why he jokingly threw out 30 as the minimum reading age. Paraphrased from memory, it was along these lines: “When you were a teenager, I was still someone who was hopefully guiding you through life. Those aren’t easy years to figure out, and so I had to live and exist by example. The concept of your father is all-encompassing, and I didn’t want you to read my poems about sex, drugs, and anguish and then confuse your dad the father with your dad the poet.”\n\nAt the newly minted age of 30, that made a crazy amount of sense to me and I was grateful I didn’t read his poems as a teenager. It would’ve changed things between us, well before we were peers.\n\nIt should also be noted that my dad writes poems in a wildcard alter ego of sorts that goes by the namesake of Clem. For him, it’s easier to go big, wild, and weird when he sees his words as fuel for the wily and restless existence of some rambunctious character in a world that isn’t necessarily this one. [I can definitely tell you first-hand this tidbit has come in handy with the more “spicy” poems, as one friend recently put it. Turns out the man did boink my mom, the son of a bitch!]\n\nSo my dad has always had a lot to say about and through poetry. He loves poetry. So do I. But the poetry industry, to the two of us anyway, is some bonk-ass labyrinth. Personally, I do my best to guarantee my best readership by mailing free copies of homemade volumes to people’s homes. One day, I’ll put together a real book that has a dollar sign somewhere. Still, it also helps me tremendously to be a millennial and thus be in constant, direct communication with literally every person I’ve ever met.\n\nThat was my dad’s only glaring error—not being born in or after the ’80s. Growing up with the internet reworked the entire prospect of artistic outreach. Your audience is already in attendance. Your PR is accidental. And everyone’s hustling in their own way.\n\nTruly, as a millennial, I can better market to people because I’ve inadvertently established a long-standing network of people my age who fervently believe we have to support each other’s art and remain willing to donate our tiny pieces of money, time, and energy to each other forever until we’re dead. And we’re all so fucking online too, oh my god.\n\nBut here I was, finally the reader, with my new-old copy of Torqueand inside was a tiny, dedicated note.\n\nJake,\n\nWe sail on will alone.\n\nLove,\n\nDad\n\nAnd then I read the first poem.\n\nelephant’s highway\n\n[by John Kilroy]\n\nsteven’s dead in the new mexico desert\n\nhis bones picked apart and scattered cross the sand\n\nsame way elephants hide death\n\nthe way my father would have dealt with me\n\ntear me apart and throw my bones\n\nbehind the bushes round the neighborhood\n\nthey say this is the life then walk away\n\nhanding you explosives\n\nand expecting you to hold ’em quietly\n\nwith the fuse lit\n\nno room for questions\n\nthey got somebody waiting to take your place\n\nsomeone who won’t make a sound\n\nuntil the moment they blow up\n\nlike steven and the way he’d shake\n\nthe week before he’d go back to college\n\nand in his four years of selling insurance\n\nhe lost the ability to sleep\n\nand the wife who made him apologize to a cocktail party\n\na house that ate him up\n\ntill steven’s taking shots at neighbors’ cars\n\nwalking naked through a park\n\nsmearing spaghetti sauce all over his bedroom walls\n\nand finally walking straight out into this wasteland\n\nleaving his station wagon running\n\nalongside the interstate\n\nan older brother you learn to hate\n\nbecause he’s what might happen to you\n\n10 years older, 10 years ago he died\n\nand i’m stuck 40 miles out of albuquerque\n\nlooking for a ride\n\nstilll no sign of steven\n\nThe poem knocked my socks off, but it wasn’t the first poem of his I ever read. I had scoped the few poems he previewed on the Chrome Press website back in the day. Plus, in 2004, his poem “Wave for Miki Dora” wound up in a book called Zero Break: An Illustrated Collection of Surf Writing, 1777–2004. He was in there with Mark Twain and Jack London — not bad for self-published poet who used to do readings at The Ugly Mug, a local home-turned-coffee-shop run by a mysterious dude who lived above and greeted each guest like he couldn’t figure out how people kept finding the place.\n\nHowever, this was the first poem of my dad’s that I ever read in a book that was decidedly his. So I inhaled a handful of his poems in my apartment, only two or three cities over from my folks, and then it dawned on me — I honestly didn’t know when I would have new poetry from my father to look forward to again.\n\nUp until that moment, I had spent the entirety of adulthood in close proximity to the good sir, waiting to read his poetry in full bloom, and now that I had it, there was a sense of rushing I wanted to kick.\n\nSo I put it back on the shelf. Days later, I came back to it and read a few more poems. Days after that, I read a few more. And still I felt like I was blowing through it. And then things changed.\n\nOut of Sight, In the Mind\n\nTwo months after my 30th birthday, I put all my belongings in storage, save for two duffel bags and in one of them was my copy of Torque. Ultimately, I took Torquewith me on each bounce that year and a half on the road, from Mexico to France, and it came with me when I moved into a speeding Airstream. Eventually, the near-delusional motion of my dad’s poetry became as familiar as the practical delirium and constant fever action of my day-to-day life.\n\nI read a poem or two when I worked at a bar above the Grand Canyon for three days, waiting for my buddy to come back up to the rim; while I befriended the bartenders, who tanked me on sundowners as bleak as blood thinners, and wound up at the fancy restaurant next door — drunk as hell, underdressed, and eating for two.\n\nI read a poem or two in the Texan hotel bar overlooking the sprawl of Big Bend where I later drank with the staff until the on-duty bartender had to go home after being blinded by the ghost pepper extract she added to our bloody marys in a competition.\n\nI read a poem or two in New Orleans, dozing off in an RV park beneath the big bridge and beside an empty street primarily used for late-night drag races; it was the evening after I witnessed my friend having his soul read by a pregnant mystic outside a jazz club and only hours after I was in some shotgun house chanting sound baths with topless women and a quiet healer I couldn’t figure out named Fox.\n\nI read a poem or two at the campsite in Mississippi where I couldn’t go to the bathroom if it rained because the gators could blend too easily into the mud; better was the campsite later in the Everglades where the bugs were just as mean and damn near twice as big.\n\nI read a poem or two as the only living soul on a windy stretch of desolate beach near the Florida-Alabama border while my friend surfed, since he had asked me to play lifeguard because, according to the locals, “nobody knows what’s in those waters these days.”\n\nI read a poem or two while tripping on mushrooms in a hammock in the Great Smokies, believing I was at the bottom of the ocean, watching the great kelp sway above me.\n\n*ahem*I had to reread that same poem or two the following morning over wake-up whiskey as my brain reassembled itself.\n\nI read a poem or two in Havana the night the air-conditioning in the bedroom broke, so I slept in the unfinished, half-roofed room of a friend of a friend of a stranger, where my legs were ripped apart by bed bugs.\n\nSo Torquewound up as a travel companion of sorts that saw a lot of my world few others did and the whole eclectic collection made sense in the moments I opened it and gazed inward. But I never told my dad all this.\n\nThe Reverence of Learning Your Elders\n\nIn truth, reading my dad’s poems was an unintentionally sacred thing I did. It never involved anyone else. In fact, I might’ve made the subconscious point of reading those poems when no one was around who knew him. I didn’t want it to ever seem like I was promoting my father, which reads poser for both of us — him as writer, me as reader.\n\nAnd while the text was by no means holy to me, I suppose I have to admit that I didn’t read his poetry like other poetry. Instead, it was this strangely tangible pull of a brain I never had access to — no one did. No one could. Poetry puts a lot of lessons on the whiteboard that don’t necessarily make the seminar. Reading it was like pulling out the pumpkin pulp by hand. It was reverential in a way.\n\nPlus, all cards on the table, given the similarities between my father and me, there was a component of reviewing a possible future version of myself, so there was potential for the pages of poetry to operate like cheat sheets for yours truly: “This could be you; beware or relax!”\n\nMy dad’s an earnest and emotionally buoyant gent who I’ve never really seen shy away from the conceptual offering of emotions. In fact, he’s always vocally encouraged them. One of his (many) notable phrases has long been “…and that’s okay.” It’s always been meant as a closer to assure you that you were entitled to your feelings, that you had every right to react the way you did, that you didn’t have to forbid yourself from sadness or anger, as long as it didn’t take over for the long haul.\n\nHis sharpness as a writer seemed so obvious to me that it went without mentioning. And it shouldn’t have gone without saying, but any praise for artists you know dearly sounds inherently fraudulent. [We’ve all seen our friends’ friends’ band at some point or another. After that, each cheerful, familiar review comes with a cautionary suspicion — and rightfully so.]\n\nIn August 2017, my dad’s resilience was tested when he was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer in his neck. That was a big blow; because, otherwise, he was the healthiest I’d ever seen him, making the 5k and 10k rounds as someone who didn’t get into running until his children were moving out. But cancer came and it came mean.\n\nThe treatment process tore him up. Chemotherapy drained him and radiation ripped him up so bad he couldn’t speak some days. He was distant with a notepad and his lively nature was largely diminished. As a huge fan of craic — a Gaelic term for what is basically the essence that is the life of the party (whether it be a joke, a story, a game, or any source of good vibe) — him being without spirited charm was rather disorienting to behold. It was a long bad autumn and winter was worse.\n\nFinally, in January 2018, he got the all-clear from the doc. He had beaten cancer. The good sir got his life back.\n\nThe Hunger of Cancer\n\nLast month, however, my dad was given the cancer diagnosis once again. This time around, squamous cell cancer is pressed against his carotid artery and pinching his spinal accessory nerve. His surgery is next week.\n\nThis round of cancer shook me weirder, not necessarily harder, than the first time he had it and the time my mom had breast cancer in 2014. There’s something inherently weighted about a surgery like this rather than months of treatment with continual updates. Thus I hurried up and finished Torque, so I could discuss it with the good sir before the blade came, and the collection closed with a familiar line.\n\nNorth\n\n[by John Kilroy]\n\nMy skeleton a mast,\n\nand skin a sort of sail;\n\ndesire blows a wind;\n\nI find my body here —\n\nthe long calm at 47 years,\n\nslumped on a weathered deck\n\nfrom thirst and hunger. Yet\n\nI sense a breeze, as hope\n\nbrushes by my cheek, then fails\n\nto fill the empty sheets,\n\nend this life adrift.\n\nThe hell with this!\n\nIt’s only up to me,\n\nto make my own fine wake,\n\nand discover in the race\n\nof night skies or omens\n\nwritten on the waves\n\na course due north\n\nto final islands, green,\n\nbefore the Arctic ends.\n\nFly the skull and bones!\n\nLet stars crowd round!\n\nDolphins, rhyme the bow!\n\nWe sail on will alone.\n\nHow to Build a Book Club\n\nLast Thursday, I finally opened Proof of Flight, my dad’s second volume of poetry, published in January, a year after his cancer was gone. As I prepared to blow through it in days instead of years, I noticed inside was the same handwritten note.\n\nJake,\n\nWe sail on will alone.\n\nLove,\n\nDad\n\nBeing an online geek, I took to Goodreads to move Proof of Flightto my “Currently Reading” lineup and I noticed the book had no ratings or reviews. It was zeros across the board and it bummed me out.\n\nThat observation shouldn’t have struck me the way it did — it’s a self-published book of poetry and its author doesn’t exactly spend his entire waking life online — but the sight knocked me around that hour before bed.\n\nI mean, of course it did. Earlier that evening, I had spent my entire therapy session finally owning up to how legitimately scared I am about this surgery. On the drive home, I recited a makeshift eulogy and my eyes wouldn’t shut the fuck up. I could barely get words out to my empty car. [Admittedly, I shouldn’t have been listening to Youth Lagoon’s first album on the drive home. That one’s on me.]\n\nSo before turning out the lights that night, I did the only tangible thing I could surmise and blocked my dad on Instagram — look, whatever you’re thinking, I know — and posted a story offering to buy a copy for whoever wanted to read Proof of Flight in hopes they’d post about it on Goodreads. I posted the same offer on Twitter and Facebook, where my dad and I are not chums.\n\nI went to sleep feeling assured because at least the prospect was…something. I couldn’t cure cancer — I can barely patch holes in the wall because I also can’t hang things correctly — but I could at least ensure my dad’s words traveled a bit farther from home. To me, there was suddenly more of a spotlight on what he offered up to the world rather than what the world came at him with. I word it like that because, although my family has an enormity to be thankful for, cancer is still a goddamn horror. Meanwhile, my dad’s been, in all outward appearances, at peace with everything — “I’ve had a good life” / “I’ve been very fortunate” — though my mom would say that goofball husband of hers is a little TOO at peace.\n\nFriday morning, I woke up to folks enthusiastically asking to read Proof of Flight. I was grateful. Then I got questions about Venmo and direct purchases. So I clarified to all that the book was indeed available via Amazon and Barnes & Noble, but I wasn’t asking or expecting anyone to buy it outright. [We’re millennials; reading a new book is a dang luxury.]\n\nBut friends kept telling me they either bought it or were planning to do so. Given that I had no expectations of any kind, paired with the heavy evening before, the whole deal got overwhelming for me rather quickly. I mean, this was already in addition to dozens of ridiculously thoughtful messages flooding my text threads and social channels in the weeks prior, ranging from “I’m here for anything you need” to “Here’s what I’m going to do for your family” — and my nerves were clearly becoming shredded and exposed. Simply put, my thank-you replies were bursting out of me like I was tripping on acid at my bon voyage party before being blasted into space. I was just so fucking beholdened to people who were who they’d always been to me and my family. It has always felt like there’s a million at least.\n\nAnd it went beyond that still! People I respect on social media yet barely talk to bought copies, college students expressed their hopeful interest in free copies because the last of their money went to groceries, and two friends each donated $50 for three books respectively, so I wouldn't go broke in my drive for readership. In the meanwhile, I compiled a list of people to send free copies once they came my way and my phone continued to blow up with friends telling me their copy was downloaded, on its way, or soon to be purchased.\n\nIt wasn’t long until the shipping estimates for copies of Proof of Flight went from 1–2 days to 1–3 months. Torquesold out entirely.\n\nThe Other Side of Culture and the Waves Between\n\nAt my mom’s birthday dinner Friday night, I informed my dad that I had finally finished Torque. He cracked a self-deprecating smile and told me I’d joined a very exclusive club.\n\nI had a loot bag of things I wanted to say, but I had read the collection over four long years in moments I could hardly even account for and explain, so there wasn’t much about cohesion beyond a handful of whimsical sentences. I soon realized I’d have to go back to the prose and return with specific lines that knocked me to the other side of the world. Still, only a few poems into Proof of Flight, I recognized there was a different vibe, but I couldn’t put it into words. So I asked.\n\nRegarding Torque, he told me he wrote it to “rearrange your molecules” and that its objective was “to take the reader out of zombie culture” and show them a different world of what culture could be. He used feverish language that bounced and crashed and, in my humble opinion, had the buzz of that wild night in American Graffiti, where a million things were happening at once and any direction could prove the right one.\n\nAs for Proof of Flight, he mused that it was a part two of sorts, that this other world he’d previously suggested, where anything was possible, could actually work. It could be our reality, or something like it, if our minds got a bit looser and a lot better. So if Torquetook your mind and soul there, Proof of Flight could show you how it might function as a truth you could make your own — Torquewas the ticket, Proof of Flight was the explainer. He used everyday language to standardize the experience, to make it comprehensible, to engage in terms that were as mystic as they were makeshift.\n\nPeople Being People for People\n\nIn the days following, my social feeds became dotted with Proof of Flight. Friends told me their favorite poem on Facebook, they told others to buy it on Instagram, and they told everyone out there how thrilled they were to dive into it on Twitter. I received texts about my dad and his poetry throughout.\n\nAfter a month and a half of uncertainty, this last week has felt grounded and tangible. While our family cheers on the good sir in a notably more personal realm, putting his brain and heart out into the world relieves the familial weight — that exposure, by its very nature, invites more positive thoughts and good vibes — and the closed circuit of prayer and the like opens up to reveal some pretty mesmerizing grandstands.\n\nMy family has long been stoked on our bonkers network of supportive humans — I mean, truly, bothparents have been through cancer once before — and the dramatic reminder of spectacular human beings within close range this past month has knocked the wind out of me. It’s one thing to be aware of love; it’s another deal altogether to be pulverized by its outpour.\n\nNot only have dear friends and relatives delivered encouraging words and offered charitable actions, but I honestly had to spend an entire evening replying to people I’d never met — online friends and strangers alike — who came to me with the same giant, remarkable heartstring orchestra.\n\nI don’t have a robust takeaway beyond gratitude with this, honestly. It just feels too big to hold in my hands or explain with the vocabulary I’ve been able to assemble in this brief life to grasp a full appreciation for how strange and lovely the world can be — even as my family loses speed, sleep, and energy. It’s just been a wild month and a wilder week, and I hate why I’m writing this but I love that I get to, that it can be the truth, that even the worst moments can indeed feature the best people.\n\nI suppose my final thought is this: Know that tiny acts can mean the world. That’s basically all it comes down to anyway.\n\nWe sail on will alone.\n\nAuthor’s note, for the rest of time:If you scoop a copy of Proof of Flight, please send a (faceless) pic to jake.kilroy@gmail.com. I plan to update this post indefinitely, with the closer only getting visually stronger.\n\nFor years and years and for better or for worse, I have maintained what I would describe as manic energy. Many other people would too. And it’s come to an end.\n\nOr at least it’s come to some version of an end. I’m not going to suddenly be a sharply dressed mute expressionist whose only contribution to a conversation is the obnoxiously loud sipping of expensive tea. I’m just going to be a different, better version of me.\n\nSee, in January of this year, I basically took on the “Summer-Winter of Jake Kilroy.” (It’s like Seinfeld’s “Summer of George” episode, except it’s more lateral than opposite, and I take my New Year’s resolutions very seriously.)\n\nThis is me shortly before blacking out at my sister’s wedding—where I was the minister.\n\nAs of last month, here’s what I’m doing with my life:\n\nI go to weekly therapy.\n\nI don’t drink.\n\nI’m taking a break from drugs.\n\nI exercise more than usual.\n\nI sleep eight hours a night.\n\nI make thoughtful decisions.\n\nI practice mindfulness.\n\nThese, as you can likely already tell, are not exactly revelations. At best, these are things most of us learned to do as kids. It wouldn’t surprise me if a substantial portion of readers are instantly, “Yeah, dude, fucking duh. Like, forever ago, we learned this.”\n\nWell, yours truly didn’t. In fact, yours truly really dug on a life of delirium and mania. To be honest, there was something exciting about life as a space cadet. Basic existence was dimensional voyaging. Day-to-day activity was visiting an alien world. I was between realities. All of it was thrilling and weird.\n\nWild-eyed hyperbole aside, I really wasn’t “here” as much as I could’ve been, and when I was, I wasn’t exactly centered. I became untethered sometime ago, and I never did anything about it.\n\nI am choosing to fully reboot in a way I have never done before.\n\nAbout every three years—thus far, at the ages of 24, 27, 30, and now 33—I investigate myself and decide who and how I should be. That has not always meant an overall healthier, calmer existence. I have absolutely chosen wilder.\n\nThis time around, however, I am choosing to fully reboot in a way I never have before.\n\nTherapy and figuring out myself\n\nI put off going to therapy for a decade and a half, and there was no good reason for the delay. Like a million other things on my existential to-do list, I just kept meaning to do it and then… didn’t.\n\nThe first two sessions of therapy were easy. I just rattled off everything I knew to be true about myself. I had ideas of what I wanted to explore, improve, and upgrade, but it was coming from a place of weakness and defeat rather than excitement and reward. I basically hated certain aspects of how I operated as a person, and I couldn’t figure out a way to break free from it as a conceptual whole.\n\nFinally, I pulled on a single thread—“I don’t think I’m as present as I could be”—and that got things going like whoa.\n\nMy therapist eventually said something that I will likely carry with me forever: “You might live so far in your head that you’re taking in a distorted sense of reality.”\n\nNow, on the surface, this reads sci-fi. But, sincerely, nothing has ever made more sense. It was like walls fell away, and I learned my surroundings were not my actual surroundings. It was all a ruse!\n\nOkay, that also reads sci-fi.\n\nBut, in an instant, I knew she was right. It explained a lot. It was like falling backward into cool water on the hottest day of the year. The realization suddenly informed why I have trouble understanding the world, why I function as a visitor, why I don’t accurately communicate myself, why peculiar things frustrate me, why cause and effect seem off in my relationships, and so on.\n\nFor all my empathy and engagement, I wasn’t always entirely here. Or I would be deeply here in a moment and then I’d disappear into my head, and that would change my comprehension. I created hypotheticals so regularly, sitting with them so repeatedly that I practically trained myself to believe them instead. Little things evolved into big things, big things eroded into little things, and I became so familiar with my own interpretation and rationalization that I accepted it over actual truth, more or less without meaning to do so.\n\nFrom time to time, up until now, I’ve encountered confusing issues with reacting to certain stimuli because so many parts of it have had to be ridiculously processed. There was such a great distance between the real world and me. It was like a postal service was carrying basic nuance from my five senses to my brain. Immersion wasn’t instant. Basic reality came to me like I was some worldly liege accepting a messenger in his court.\n\nSo my chatting skills would range from spaced-out drivel in order to survive dialogue to a dozen steps ahead of the other person in a conversation because I’d already mentally played out the things I wanted to say in their entirety. My words would sometimes come off negative when I didn’t mean for them to be delivered as such—argumentative, critical, dismissive, judgmental, pious, pretentious, snarky, tense, and the like—because I would regularly speak without thinking, leaving thoughts ill-timed, insensitive, raw, reactive, unformed, out in the open, and available for interpretation. At times, I would find myself following up with folks at great length because I was too out of it or too in my own head the first go.\n\nWas all this annoying and frustrating? Probably. Maybe. I don’t know. What did I care? I was so far up my ass-brain I didn’t always know what was happening.\n\nTo theoretically enable some form of control, I more or less conditioned myself to consider those hypothetical outcomes, so I would have prepared responses I could mail in from afar. But I assigned different weights to possibilities, so, in strange instances, the unexpectedness of reality made me oddly vulnerable and incapable. I wouldn’t know how to deal with situations because I was so frantic and far removed from them while simultaneously being grossly concerned and unsure how to proceed. I created a sort of helplessness cycle that would make me feel hopeless until I spaced out again and then all of it felt distant and I cared less about everything.\n\nSanity can be relative. Control can be illusionary. What should matter is happiness. However, your gauge of joy isn’t always what you believe it to be.\n\nFor me, I was happy being in my own world. I just severely underestimated how hard it had knocked me out of the real one. I brushed it off as bumping into people at grocery stores while crafting a narrative in my head, whereas I should have been asking myself, Hey, do you ever wonder if you’re purposefully removing yourself from real-life situations in order to guarantee an outcome you prefer, one with little to no consequences?\n\nIn retrospect, I was regularly blindsided by very obvious truths and remarkably easy situations simply because I was vacationing from existence so very often. I decorated the inside of my head quite exquisitely, I must say. (The fact I was able to do this in the first place is a gargantuan reveal of my straight-white-maleness.)\n\nI just sort of floated. Relationships came and went. Friends would be temporarily disappointed in me. Family would get mad at me and then they wouldn’t because they’re family. I coasted through life because my priority was me, and I knew exactly what I wanted and acted accordingly.\n\nAll the while, I maintained the calendar and momentum of a social butterfly, and I would still make a point to be there for people, whether to help them move, get them through a breakup, or simply ask them a million questions about their life. But I often saw each interaction as a singular moment, a blip, rather than a valuable part of a longer string or larger scheme. I was out and about in the world to get my emotional passport stamped and then return to the safety and comfort of home.\n\nIt doesn’t make much sense to me now. It actually bums me out. But it felt comfortable for a long time, mostly because, at some point, I realized I’m only on this planet for a handful of years, and if some god replays my highlight reel, I want to make sure I lived for me and had a blast. I never felt like I was missing out. I was serving my own master—me.\n\nThus learning that I was something of a mental and emotional ghost in the House of Jake Kilroy was legitimately terrifying. I wasn’t just absent from the lives of others; I was absent in my own life as well, and for some reason, that new context made all the difference.\n\nMy therapist is max chill and for that I am grateful because my response was, “Holy fuck, you’re right,” followed by a plague of “What in the hell?” and “How in the shit?” It was unfathomably draining at first, and then, shortly after, it became ridiculously energizing. It felt comparable to the time I found out my vision had been bad my whole life while I thought that’s just how eyes worked.\n\nI felt alive. I was present. The world instantly became easier.\n\nWhat makes you feel good in the moment is surface level. Feeling good at your core is work.\n\nAs that same session of therapy revealed, I tend to overthink and overanalyze. In theory, this should make me highly perceptive of reality, but it has the opposite effect. No one needs hours of philosophy regarding the tiniest of moments. No one needs to consider how the future may or may not unfold like they’re goddamn Donnie Darko. No one needs to ruminate on nothing forever.\n\nSo I’ve stopped.\n\nI mean, I’m still training my brain to halt that shit as more reflex than exercise because it already feels like a much breezier way to live, but it’s a change to how I’ve come at the world for a good spell, and that takes time and practice.\n\nFor instance, since my therapist delivered that crucial line, I’ve felt my mind wandering and my presence drifting, and I’ve had to catch it like a balloon rising up to meet the big blue sky.\n\nI’ve taken to meditating, doing yoga, repeating mantras, reading self-help books, and even naming what I see and hear just to keep from retreating and disappearing into a daydream version of reality.\n\nWith that, I’ve had to remove some control and accept that I can’t control everything. This is a basic lesson, sure, but as an unmarried dude without kids, it can prove quite easy to control what I do with my life. I make decisions that directly and immediately affect me and only me—for the most part, or so you’d think.\n\nWhen you get used to control, you’re perplexed when you don’t have it. You feel anxiety you can’t put into words, and your scrambled set of actions and responses have new limitations. This all baffles and frustrates you, and it’s sourced from a bizarre state of comprehensive weakness. In therapy, I’ve learned that I am someone who, in default mode, will trial-and-error his way through things, ideally to a desirable outcome—I’m a fixer, as my therapist puts it. But I’ve had blinders on, so my resolutions have been more Band-Aids than surgeries.\n\nThe odd part of all this, of course, is that I am not known for being in control—not even a little bit. That’s, like, half my problem. I have long tended to operate in a world of chaos, but I was able to easily control what interested me—and there was a lot I didn’t care about, even though I absolutely, totally should have. (Read: “Sure, my car insurance is late because I didn’t check the mail for weeks, but here’s how I spent my Saturday doing everything I wanted to do.” That sort of nonsense shit.)\n\nSo now I’m someone who is in attendance for general existence, not just my own—someone who is actively working on experiencing reality objectively. I’m actually high on life, which sounds like an inspirational throwaway, but, come on, it’s my first time here.\n\nShifting toward sobriety\n\nGiving up booze was surprisingly easy. It finally and fully settled into me that I had a problematic relationship with alcohol. Since I started drinking as a teen, I haven’t ever given serious thought to sobriety. To be frank, I never really evaluated my relationship with the substance.\n\nThis reads odd, given that overly analytical mind of mine, but it boils down to an easy personal truth: Given that overly analytical mind of mine (that truly never shuts the fuck up), booze was a shiny “off” button.\n\n“I’m turning off this thunderous racket right the fuck now,” my inner monologue would bellow, right before a first drink would turn into a half dozen. For as much as I was in my own head, I didn’t always like it. It’s loud in there. Even partiers need to go to sleep at some point.\n\nThat readiness to drink, paired with an established distance from reality and an overall decision to not give as much thought to everyday things, brought out a pretty bunk version of me some nights.\n\nIt’s way too easy for me to become way too much to handle as a drunk. I’ve had solid moments of being a charming delight, or so I’ve been told, but I’ve also had notable instances being a fucking nightmare. No one who has gone drinking with me more than once would say otherwise.\n\nSure, while you and I may have once had a lovely evening of wine, finger foods, and a discussion of the nation’s two-party system (that went beyond simple teenage fist-shaking), we’ve also maybe had a night out where I wound up drinking the cocktails of two strangers on a date at some Downtown Disney establishment. (That’s a true story and it’s not a good one.)\n\nUltimately, you can only say, “That’s not who I am,” so many times until somebody steps in and points out, “Okay, well, whoever that other person is seems to be rentinga lot of space in your body.”\n\nThat somebody pointing it out should be you, by the way.\n\nBut I only recently did that. Up until now, each incident was considered isolated. I’d stop or cut back on drinking in response to what we in the industry call a “big fucking whoops.” For me, that could range from getting my friends and I kicked out of one bar and almost a second in the same night, to waking up and assuming my car had been stolen until looking at my phone and seeing Lyft was the last app I opened—and then later finding out my friend had to beg and bargain with me not to drive myself home.\n\nIn short, the best thing you could say about me as a drunk was that I was good or tolerable “most of the time.”\n\nAs a drinker or non-drinker, I don’t know what my plans are from here on out. I haven’t poured out my extensive bar supplies yet. I just moved them from the counter to the cabinet and replaced their former space with fruits and vegetables. (I’m such a sucker for symbolism.)\n\nNow that I’m weeks out of the habit, I may return to alcohol at some point and come at the entire prospect totally anew. In my brain, that means a one/two-drink limit in all instances and much greater infrequency—like how I only have soda a handful of times a year, mostly at summer barbecues. Loosening the nerves is a nice treat, but it shouldn’t be the default operating system. Maybe I’ll never drink again. I legitimately don’t know. But it’s definitely only minimal as a max from here on out. That’s for sure.\n\nTaking a break from getting high\n\nI’m not quitting drugs forever, but it definitely clashes with my attempt at being more present. Down the road, something like ayahuasca may just deliver the universe’s plan for me. Who knows?\n\nWeed’s been the only drug I really engage with anymore these days, and given local dispensaries, I’m basically snacking on druggo superfoods anyway. Hell, the last time I got high was cannabis-infused granola bites with almonds, chia seeds, dates, goji berries, and sunflower seeds—it was like being a college freshman with John Muir—so I figure it’s “just a phase.”\n\nUnlike with alcohol, the most shameful things I’ve done while high is shushing a microwave and hosting a half-hour debate with myself about whether to send handwritten apology letters to the neighbors for chewing too loudly.\n\nHowever, any high is still putting me out of my brain, and the rush of awareness is new to me and I’m chasing that one big time.\n\nExercising my body more\n\nThis isn’t a huge update. I just have the time to do it now, and I’ve changed my environment. Last October, my gym membership expired, and I took to running around my neighborhood. Huge surprise: I found jogging around a quiet, picturesque residential area to be more relaxing than sprinting on a machine beneath fluorescent lights, facing televisions.\n\nI never wanted to spend that much time at the gym. Coming into this year, I suddenly had entire evenings available and so I took to going several miles, running because it felt great and walking because it was relaxing. These longer routes became the focus of my evening, rather than a brief component of my day.\n\nMy runs used to be late because I preferred them as the last thing of the day, working off any nonsense I ate or drank. But now I consistently eat healthy and I’ve stopped drinking, so my runs feel remarkably easy, and I find them tremendously soothing. They make for good one-on-one sessions with myself.\n\nGetting the rest I need\n\nIt seems like sleeping should be impossibly easy. It’s one of the first things you learn to do when you enter this world. You can even do it on accident.\n\nHowever, I’ve always found sleep to be utter nonsense. Until this year, I only slept eight full hours when I was sick, traveling, or depressed. Truly, I have never embraced a good night’s rest before this year because there were a million things I’d rather do and I never minded being delirious.\n\nPrior to this year’s brain rework, I’d sleep an average of five hours a night. Sometimes, I’d stay up until nearly sunrise simply because I got into the groove of a puzzle. Surely this lack of sleep explains some things about my life before. Reading this, people who’ve known me for years would say, “Now I know why simple tasks were so very difficult for him. He was half-braindead all the time.”\n\nBut I liked that weird energy that came with modest sleep deprivation. I enjoyed functioning in an oddball way. I preferred being just slightly removed from reality. Nothing bad seemed too bad in that mode.\n\nBut that’s why simple tasks were so very difficult for me, because I was half-braindead all the time. Now I’m not, and I feel like a genius—or my version of genius anyway. Seriously, now that I’m getting decent rest, I feel like I put in cheat codes.\n\nPutting thought into decisions\n\nGiven a well-rested body and brain, devoid of typical poisons, it’s apparently quite easy to choose long-term reward over instant gratification. To many people, this is obvious. To me, this is now also obvious, but I just always found the notion of abiding by it immensely difficult. It’s only been just recently that I took it as sacred philosophy.\n\nI never consciously thought, “Hey, you’re only on this planet for so long,” before deciding to treat myself to takeout instead of cooking at home or buying more books when I haven’t read a substantial portion already on my shelf, but there was some spring of that step in me somewhere. Since I had essentially conditioned myself to live my “best life” at a numbing constant, the gap between “I want this” and “I shall have this” was often short-lived.\n\nTo me, long-term reward was not exactly a reward. It was homework. It was business. For all my absence of presence, I was good about treating myself in the moment. I was forever chasing happiness. Happiness was immediate. Anything later was not happiness.\n\nBut living sleep-deprived, half-drunk, and kind of high is the exact recipe for a lack of larger consideration. What makes you feel good in the moment is surface level. Feeling good at your core is work. I was coasting. I gave myself what I wanted in reflex—not what I thought I should ultimately have deep down.\n\nNow it’s easy. Now it’s core decisions. Now it’s a life of principles. And what I want to do and what I should do are blending. It can be easy to be healthy—nutritionally, financially, etc. You just need to be in a good place.\n\nLetting myself be mindful\n\nMindfulness for me is huge because it deals with the root of things.\n\nI have never actively attempted to escape my head. I liked it in there. It was comfortable. It wasn’t great for me as it turns out, but, hey, I knew my way around the place.\n\nI used to be rather good about checking in with myself. But I haven’t been for a long while. There are a few reasons for that, but there was definitely one big source.\n\nIn 2017, I was depressed. It wasn’t clinical depression. But it was for sure a low point that lasted for more than half the year, and I have severely underestimated its impact ever since.\n\nHands down, 2016 was the best year of my life. I put my stuff in storage and existed as I had always wanted to—living on the road, bouncing around states and countries, and writing for a living. Everything made sense to me and my manic energy flourished because I was game for anything. I was constantly exploring and reacting to new stimuli while doing what I loved. It seriously felt like I beat the game.\n\nWhen I moved home at the end of the year, I promised myself I would take that feverish joy and put it into a domestic, more stationary existence that was just as rewarding. I was ready to figure it out. The problem was that freelance work abruptly tapered off across the board, and I had no money in savings—I had treated myself outrageously, indescribably well that year with travel. So I was suddenly broke, buying material possessions I needed in a post-duffel bag life, and I owed the government a substantial figure in taxes.\n\nI had gone from living the dream to being too poor to do anything. I was living alone, working from home, unable to go out, and it was not a good place to be. I picked myself apart—pretty ruthlessly at times.\n\nI became isolated. I felt like a failure. I kind of hated myself. And these were all things I recognized toward the end or shortly thereafter. Earlier on, my brain was so scrambled with anxiety and fury, I couldn’t purposefully focus on myself too long or too deep because I’d have a meltdown. I would literally tear my hair out from stress at home and then just say weird, ominous shit when out and about before drinking myself into oblivion.\n\nIn moving on, I acknowledged these destructive feelings and tendencies as relics of the past, as if they could be spotted in the distance of a bad time in my life. I didn’t realize I was carrying them with me like cursed tokens. Once I returned to an office job with a steady income, I put all my focus into feeling better. And I did! I totally felt better! Who wouldn’t after going from having nothing to root for to everything trending upward? With that, though, I more or less paved over a sinkhole I believed to be a pothole.\n\nLooking back, I suppose without truly realizing it, I refused to look too far inward, scared of what I might see again. Instead, I projected a strange confidence, looked for solutions elsewhere, and basically stopped checking in with myself.\n\nIn turn, I made 2018 the busiest year of my life. I couldn’t slow down. I simply wouldn’t. I ensured that I was so distracted I’d never be able to sit with myself too long or too deep, from constantly checking social media to taking work home to scheduling social event after social event. Even my minimal travel last year was basically inhaled. In October, I went to a bachelor party, attended two weddings, and went all out on a business trip—Austin, D.C., Kauai, and Las Vegas, respectively—all in the span of three weeks. I’d go to work for a day in between each trip, and I came home from that wildcard stint broken-brained and still charging.\n\nNeedless to say, I was coming apart by the end of 2018, and I came into this year in tatters.\n\nI felt the developing weight for a while; I somehow resented it without truly acknowledging it. But I had also been in that mode for so long, it felt practically standard. I found myself retreating inward without excavating or even really examining. Weird vulnerabilities were coming to the surface, I was seeking unfamiliar validation to quench uncharacteristic insecurities, and I couldn’t recognize what should’ve outright been considered a plague of outliers, novel undesirables ranging from bitter to self-righteous. My entire setup of mental and emotional processing had been damaged at light speed, and I kept the trajectory going instead of stopping for repairs. It wasn’t until everything in my life came to a head that I had to admit my entire existence was out of whack.\n\nThe curious thing is that I also came into this year with more energy than I knew what to do with—more new year energy than I’ve ever had, in fact. I recognized I wasn’t myself the last two years—one year depressed, one year distracted—and it took several life changes to break free this January and now it’s like I’m glowing.\n\nI feel like I’ve come alive again.\n\nNo, really, for all my annoying love of hyperbole, I mean it. It’s been wild. I’ve legitimately never operated like this. I’ve looked deep within myself for the first time in years and I like what I see and love what I could see.\n\nI like who I am. For the most part, I’ve always liked who I am. I just had spots that needed a remodel instead of a new coat of paint.\n\nI’ve never felt this calm. I’ve never tried to be this collected. I’ve always been my version of calm and collected, which in my head (RIP), looked like a guru floating in a house in flames. (I suppose it’s just the “This is fine” cartoon dog meme, really. Ugh, how predictably millennial.)\n\nTo be honest, I feel a bit sedated. I’m not used to this, and I used to fear any sense of slowness or any hint of boredom. I’m not familiar with peace. I’m not accustomed to tranquility. I’m not acclimated to rationale. I’ve always just… spun. Part of me worries my manic energy was a source of humor and creativity, but that’s the myth that our best offerings are rooted in nonsense habituals.\n\nI’ve asked myself what kind of person I ultimately want to be and now I’m coming up with answers. Lately, I’ve found myself doing things I’ve long put off, and I’ve functioned in a way I should have a lifetime ago.\n\nFrom engaging in activities I’ve always meant to do to getting involved in local organizations I always meant to join, I’m nailing this new life. This particular part of my upgraded existence didn’t take an outrageous amount of work either. All it required was a clearer mind, a life without self-made distractions, and the decision to simply show up. For some reason, “I always meant to” never counted as a desire because it wasn’t immediate. I put things off, and it’s made for a long list.\n\nMy brain has never worked better and I’m only a month in, so I’m pretty stoked and eager to see what comes of this approach. Even now, I speak without later regret because my brain is working at full capacity; there’s a thoughtful center and an actual filter. I’m months ahead on bills because it suddenly became easy to sit down, organize my finances, and be smarter about spending. Overall, I’m exploring the world anew rather than sticking to what I know, kicking it in some oddball mental tower.\n\nI like who I am. For the most part, I’ve always liked who I am. I just had spots that needed a remodel instead of a new coat of paint this time, and I’ll be better about maintenance from here on out.\n\nTo be honest, it feels like I just joined the population—and I feel fucking good about it, about all things.\n\nPart of me wants to say I don’t know how to describe this feeling, but that’s a pretty obnoxious way to close out. See that awareness? That’s the new me!\n\nAnd I’m thrilled to be here.\n\nA regular exercise of mine is to organize memories — take them out of storage, dust them off, and settle them back in a bit more polished than before — so it hopefully proves easier to revisit my brain down the road as it slowly, and then I assume quite rapidly, deteriorates. I do this with good and bad moments alike; however, the latter doesn’t necessarily read light and bouncy, and I tend to keep those ones personal anyhow.\n\nSo, in the spirit of a jovial read, I’ve kept this public offering of my memory bank polite, congenial, and amusing (ideally). It’s not meant to be a comprehensive reflection of an entire life. [Hell, I’m only in my 30s.] Instead, this particular assemblage of moments was more or less driven by, “Huh, that was curious or screwball,” rather than simply joyous memories that make me smile like a glossy-eyed dork.\n\nWhile I’ve had moments of deep, transfixed sadness and gross emotional ineptitude, I dig the idea of, from time to time, life being reviewed like a highlight reel or some sparkling beach net collection of gems, even if they’re mere blips that only mattered for a few minutes.\n\nPer my usual rule, I’ve left out the more personal narratives of sex and drugs. [Them memories are for my jubilation, triumph, and shame and my jubilation, triumph, and shame alone.] I’ve also kept names out of this because I lost all my permission slips and release forms. Everyone under the buddy, pal, or friend banner here knows who they are.\n\nI suppose I engage in this memory recollection and refurbishing activity because it reveals how lucky I’ve been in this life, and I never want to overlook that or fail to appreciate it. My memory gets worse with each passing year, and I like having a seemingly tangible memory bank that I can readily come upon. And then I put it out in the world because I haven’t lead an interesting enough life to pen a memoir, so this is the closest I’ll ever get to nailing an autobiography.\n\n100 Onces\n\n1. Once, I convinced my friend he won concert tickets with a fake email from Travis Bickle. I asked if he’d take me. He said, “Maybe.”\n\n2. Once, I wasn’t into a party at my house, so I watched Wise Bloodin my bedroom. It made me feel so weird I came downstairs and lit myself up mad drunk with a distant stare I honestly couldn’t shake.\n\n3. Once, I met Tim Armstrong from Rancid. Given that neither of us properly enunciate, much of the conversation was just the word ‘what.’\n\n4. Once, riding shotgun on the way home from a party, my pal and I smashed into a car stopped in freeway traffic. Two dudes dressed like assassins from The Matrix — all leather and white/spiral contacts with weird make-up, legit looking from the future — popped out of the vehicle, to which I yelled, “WHO THE FUCK DID WE HIT.” Given that my buddy only had his permit, we avoided legal trouble by him saying, “So…he can’t be here,” and I just nodded and left with the strangers’ friends, who were also hit. I climbed into the backseat of a two-door sedan with a young woman crying into her phone, “And now some kid just got in our car!” Left at a gas station, I called my dad collect from a payphone. He wasn’t happy. Next day, he warmed up, asking, “How were you not kidnapped?” I had no answer — joking about vampires knowing their own, realizing how bad I am at making decisions, thinking, “I’m gonna die so dumb.”\n\n5. Once, from a cab, I watched two officers in separate cop cars cuss each other out. It was the most New York thing I’ve ever seen in my life.\n\n6. Once, in college, our house threw a bonkers party. The cops showed up, citing multiple calls. Each roommate then revealed he had called the police. Every single noise complaint was from us.\n\n7. Once, when I was a 13, I broke into my neighbors’ house while they were on vacation to watch cable because my dad had gotten rid of ours.\n\n8. Once, as a teen, a friend’s older babe neighbor offered me a smoke. I held it out for her to light like it was crime scene evidence. She laughed, “First cigarette?” It was.\n\n9. Once, a designer I was dating asked what I thought of her new fonts. The first card read WHY DON’T YOU LOVE ME. The review did not go well.\n\n10. Once, I forgot my ID, so a waitress, my age, quizzed me — when I graduated, what I grew up knowing, etc. There was a thoughtful pause as she considered me. I added that my prom’s DJ played “Ignition (Remix)” twice. She nodded, bellowed “YUP”, and served me a beer.\n\n11. Once, at 19, I submitted an essay to The New Yorker. It was rejected. A month later, I received a second rejection letter for no reason.\n\n12. Once, shortly after Sam’s Town came out, I went as Brandon Flowers for Halloween and kept putting on The Killers, so I could sing along like it was a concert. My extremely obnoxious running joke was not well-received.\n\n13. Once, Mandy Moore came to my high school for an assembly. Wanting to woo her with a cute yet casual gesture, I gifted her a Del Taco coupon (that was only good down the street).\n\n14. Once, as a party was winding down, I overheard a hookup pause so the woman could slap the dude and growl, “I said, do you believe in God?”\n\n15. Once, a date wore a UCLA sweater to Knott’s Scary Farm. In an asylum maze, a monster with an ax ran at us, only to calmly quip, “USC rules.”\n\n16. Once, hammered at a Thanksgiving party, I sprayed the leftovers with whipped cream and left to hook up in a van. No one was happy (but me). To this day, nothing I’ve done has come even remotely close to making my friends as mad as they were about this. Whenever it comes up in conversation, it’s like it happened just yesterday.\n\n17. Once, at a party, things were weird with a girl I was dating…that got way weirder when she hooked up with an off-duty firefighter in the same jacuzzi as me.\n\n18. Once, well after midnight, my pal joke-swerved on a dark mountain road to scare us and hit a parked car. Before waking the owner, he informed us we had to first bury all the drugs he was selling in the surrounding woods.\n\n19. Once, at a club in Mexico, a stripper corrected my Spanish while still coyly writhing around stage as I slipped money into her underwear.\n\n20. Once, in college, a friend’s mother snuck a foot up my bathing suit in a jacuzzi. I muttered, “Well, it’s getting too hot for me,” and got outta there.\n\n21. Once, the weekend of Halloween, I hydroplaned, spun out, and wound up in a head-on collision on the freeway. I was down the street from my college and I hit two soroity girls in sexy costumes. As the family minivan was full of smoke and the rain was coming down brutal, the ladies invited me to wait for my dad in their car. By the time my dad showed up, I was having a blast, something he was extremely unstoked to behold. Days later, he calmed down, grateful I was alive, and told me if I ever saw them on campus, I should say, “Hey, funny running into you again!”\n\n22. Once, attempting to use a gated community pool’s clubhouse, my very adult friends and I accidentally attended the most epic 420 high school party ever seen. It wound up as us drinking beer in the jacuzzi, surrounded by what felt like hordes of high schoolers. They tarped up the clubhouse windows and had a cover charge we didn’t have to pay because they were worried we’d call the cops.\n\n23. Once, a pizza joint offered free cheesy bread if the Anaheim Ducks scored a power play goal — one per dining party. So my roommates and I piled into a car and staggered our arrival, waiting around like strangers. Things were going fine until one of us went rogue with a loud, elaborate backstory about being a CEO.\n\n24. Once, when I was a teen insane with my first high school crush, a different girl at a party asked me if I wanted to go make out and I politely turned it down like someone’s mom had offered me a snack and then I caught my friend giving me the hardest WTF face I’ve probably ever seen.\n\n25. Once, 3 a.m. in rural Kentucky, on our way home from Bonnaroo, my pal and I took a shortcut as the rainy forest road’s lone car on our way to a town we saw a turnoff for. After passing a church with a ominous swinging light, we came upon a meadow, flanked by mountains and a giant moon. “Where’s the town?” he asked flatly and gravely. Spooked, we sped to a motel and stayed up while the other showered out of fear of hungry ghosts.\n\n26. Once, as a kid, my mom made pasta. I wasn’t into it that night and asked, “Can I have something else?” She answered, “Pretend this is a restaurant and you have to eat it.” I stared at it for a moment before informing her, “Well, then I didn’t order this.” My dad snorted wine out his nose and had to leave the table.\n\n27. Once, in college, I left a party because I got way too high and came home to an empty house. Shortly after, my roommates killed the power and started creeping around, making weird noises. They didn’t know I kept a bat under my bed and it’s the closest I’ve come to murder.\n\n28. Once, my friend and I saw an orchestra — in suits and on edibles. After an epic crescendo, he whisper-yelled, “Holy shit, I need to hit the bathroom to wipe all the cum off my face.” I concurred, “YEAH, DUDE.” And then the lady in front of us did the slowest turn I’ve ever seen.\n\n29. Once, at a party, a friend saw me and said, “Nice shirt.” I agreed, explaining how I lifted it from our mutual clothes-grifting pal as retribution. My friend laughed, clarifying it was actually his shirt before it was stolen. That’s when the stripper pole came out of the ceiling.\n\n30. Once, at a summer party, I drank wild on an empty stomach and spent the night making out with someone’s friend, treating her like my girlfriend. My sister got a head’s up about the gal and passed it onto me as I was leaving. I laughed, cross-eyed as hell and totally bewildered: “Who the fuck is Megan?”\n\n31. Once, before a college girlfriend left to study abroad, my friends and I built a theater set of a restaurant that enclosed our patio. I scooped her and returned, where everyone played a role — valet, host, waiter, busboy, cook, owner, live music — each dude welcoming us as strangers.\n\n32. Once, a teacher called my house during an otherwise delightful family dinner to inform my parents that she straight up couldn’t teach her class with me in it because I just wouldn’t stop talking. I had been there exactly one time. That’s how I rounded out my first day of 2nd grade. Later that year, she would send me outside for talking straight through the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n33. Once, on the first day my 7th grade friends and I walked home from school, we were pegged by jagged cans outside a donut shop. I went into a rage. I opened my grape soda, took one sip, and ran to pour it out on the kid. Then his older brother pinned me against the alley wall by the throat.\n\n34. Once, I was banned from a Vancouver hostel. We befriended a drunk soldier on leave after he approached our table with a literal handful of weed. I let him use the bathroom and when the owner got mad at me, the dude threatened to beat his ass. It was our last night in town anyway.\n\n35. Once, at 18, I went to a carnival in Vienna. Another student got a bloody nose on the bungee. The very buff operator turned to us laughing with blood on him. I said, “You look like a tough motherfucker!” He caught little and growled, “MOTHER.FUCKER?” He stepped at me with developing fury until my teacher explained that I was simply an idiot.\n\n36. Once, when I played drums in 9th grade, my band was invited to play a popular dude’s party. That week, I was grounded for bad grades. My folks allowed me to go — only to play. So once my band wrapped its set, they rolled into the full-throttle party to help me load my gear into the minivan in front of everyone.\n\n37. Once, my buddy and I were broke in Cuba. Our only chance was a Western Union transfer to our hostel’s employee. I scribbled the dude’s info with the note PLEASE SEND THIS MAN MONEY and texted a screenshot. Then I lost service. So for hours, my mother worried I had been kidnapped.\n\n38. Once, when I was on a JV basketball team that went 1–21, we watched a 7-footer clear our 5'3\" guard on a dunk and our AND1-loving bench went insane. Next practice, coach made us run until we couldn’t stand to teach us not to cheer for opponents. “That’s, like, Sports 101, guys.”\n\n39. Once, while on the road, my buddy brought a gal back to our Airstream. I commented on her “Always” tattoo. She sang Snape’s praise as I called him a Nazi asshole with a crush. We drunkenly fought about this until I yelled, “Avada Kedavra!” She was instantly livid and did not stay.\n\n40. Once, in high school, my friend, my brother, and I were to attend my sister’s basketball game. We forgot to rally everyone to go, so instead we each wore a homemade shirt featuring a letter (C/A/L) and hung up a paper banner reading SORRY CAITLIN, THE OTHER GUYS COULDN’T MAKE IT!\n\n41. Once, as a grade school supervisor, two little girls told me I should make the other supervisor my girlfriend. One girl: “My dad has a girlfriend. It’s my mom.” Other girl: “My dad has a girlfriend. Mommy doesn’t know about it.” [Then it was just me splashing water on my face, trying to collect myself.]\n\n42. Once, my grandparents gave me a shirt for Christmas. Upon opening the gift, a curious look crossed my face. My grandma said, “When I saw it, I thought, ‘That looks exactly like something Jake would wear!’” She was right — because she had bought me the same exact shirt the year before.\n\n43. Once, I saw Skrillex crowd-surfing at a Refused show. Toward the end of ‘New Noise,’ I grabbed his collar and we repeatedly screamed “THE NEW BEAT” at each other with our sweaty foreheads touching. When it was over, I gave him an eskimo kiss and put him back on the wave of hands.\n\n44. Once, while at a favorite bar in Baja, our bartender invited us to a party he was working that night. Hours later, 17 of us rolled up to the big garden bash in a van — piled inside, atop the roof, hanging on back — and started drinking…with the bride and groom’s friends and family.\n\n45. Once, while living in a college party house, my roommates and I agreed to let our friend build a two-story living space in the garage. When he moved out, another buddy moved into the “Get-Outta-Townhouse.” Yet he still came around like a super — just fixing stuff and checking on things.\n\n46. Once, as my friend and I set up a tent at sunset in Missouri, fireflies came out. It was magical. Neither of us had seen them before. We hustled to the nearest gas station, bought bottles of Boone’s Farm, and came back to sit in our lawn chairs. By then, the fireflies were gone.\n\n47. Once, the ex of my pal’s lady razed him at a bar. He countered. Then a half dozen of us lined up with a half dozen of them like a damn movie. The monstrous meathead assigned to me was a chatty one. “Don’t wanna kick your ass, but I may have to,” he said, 1,000% stronger than me and earnestly filled with regret. My reply, simply: “Ah, that is unfortunate to hear.”\n\n48. Once, in 1st grade, I opened a one-night pop-up eatery called eEvita’s (an edgy spelling, I suppose). My parents worked the kitchen, my siblings ran a hosting station/lemonade stand in the entryway, and every relative in the county packed the place. I dressed up and did not pay my staff.\n\n49. Once, three pals and I cruised to the beach on Labor Day for (what was at the time) the best pizza. We picnicked on a hill overlooking the San Clemente Pier on a perfect day. Before us, against the sunset, a couple in their late 40s took turns aggressively getting each other off.\n\n50. Once, as a boy, I had my future told over tarot cards in a treehouse by two girls. With a nearly debilitating crush on one of them, I tried to make a cool, funny, and memorable exit. It was only the latter. I fell out, got the wind knocked out of me, and thought I broke my arm.\n\n51. Once, at a health food café, a server entered the patio carrying an enormous bowl of harvested vegetables, and all I could ask was, “What doofus ordered a whole veggie basket for brunch?” To my surprise, I had. It was then I learned crudité and crostini were not the same thing.\n\n52. Once, a buddy got us WAY too stoned at a party. I sat at a table, hands folded like a job interview, loving the music. I asked him who it was. “Of Montreal. Sunlandic Twins,” he answered. A pal spoke up. “Okay, I have to step in. You two have had this exact conversation six times now. One of you has to get less high.”\n\n53. Once, at a Vegas bachelor party, a few of us ate edibles without considering the consequences. In the wave pool, life was bliss. In the lazy river, however, we succumbed to delirious panic, convinced the current implied a waterfall, and chain-held one another so we wouldn’t go over. Kids continued to swim by.\n\n54. Once, my 1–21 JV basketball team’s guard made a buzzer beater. As we walked off dejected — it was still a double-digit loss — he was scooped by our joyous forward. Coach yell-asked why he was So damn happy when we lost. Player replied, “Oh…I thought it was the end of the 3rd.” Coach made us run then and there.\n\n55. Once, junior year, our English final was to pitch our summer goal, no matter how unrealistic. I wrote about owning a flamethrower. To add authenticity, I borrowed a friend’s lighter and lit the edges of the essay. It caught more and I had to put it out in a dead-quiet classroom.\n\n56. Once, senior year, during an admin meeting, I learned our admin bought cameras — due to car vandalism — but not the tapes. So a bud and I made a huge banner reading WE SMILED FOR THE CAMERAS and hung it from the amphitheater’s roof. Problem "
