        "text": "There are a few words that denote the idea of a personal mark or signature that could encapsulate one's name. The idea of marking something or leaving a trace behind is very similar to the idea of signing.\n\nFurther than that, however, are the following concepts:\n\nbreadcrumbs — a trail of such marks intended to lead someone somewhere\n\ninscription — typically a carving intended as a unique signature; it can also refer to calligraphy\n\nepigraph — \"an inscription on a building, statue, or coin\"\n\neaster egg — in addition to the holiday game, easter eggs also refer to hidden features or signatures in software, film and books\n\nreference — a less peculiar version of the concept\n\nIf you write your signature (or \"[name] was here\") as graffiti on a wall, that is a tag, and the action is tagging.\n\nI have heard the term leave-behind for an object that you give away so that people will remember you (for example, salespeople leaving trinkets). This is marketing jargon, though, so it doesn't seem to match what you're looking for.\n\nI can think of several nouns that could describe the thing or sign that is left (memento, trace, sign, mark, ...) but I can't think of a verb that describes the action of leaving it, in the sense that you seek."
