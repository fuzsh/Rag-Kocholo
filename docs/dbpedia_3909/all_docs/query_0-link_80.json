        "text": "The Overland, the Hippie Trail, the Big OE\n\nI was interested to read this to observe some of this particular overland route that many young people took in the late 1960’s early 1970’s.\n\nWhile for some it signified the hippie trail, for others, for example, those coming from New Zealand, it was a kind of right of passage, referred to as ‘the Big OE’, the ‘overseas experience’, which that culture accepts is something that every young person might do in their twenties, while still single, and eligible to get a working holiday visa in the UK to help fund their travels.\n\nBy the 1990’s when I did my OE, the overland route had changed, it was no longer advisable to take the route that those from the 1970’s had taken. My mini version of the overland, was to spend three months travelling through India, Nepal, Vietman and Thailand.\n\nEmployers expected many young in their twenties to leave to take up the two year visa opportunity and gain valuable experience from living in another country and travelling in other cultures. I remember my boss when I told him I was leaving telling me that he learnt more in first couple of weeks travelling in Asia than he had in the previous couple of years in his employment. It did make me wonder what happened in those couple of weeks!\n\nBoth of my birth parents travelled a similar route, from different starting points, and reading Overland made me want to know more about their experiences, because they were very different from what I read here.\n\nBoth had to find work in foreign countries to fund their travels, and set off on their own, without a vehicle or travelling mate, although as anyone travelling alone soon discovers, it doesn’t take long to connect with other like minded travellers.\n\nRecently my father found some old photos from that journey he set out on at the age of 18, one of which is depicted above, others show him working on a construction site in Kuwait, interacting with local workers. Not the same route followed as this overland novel depicts, much more of an intrepid journey.\n\nYoung Brits Abroad in a Land Rover\n\nThree youth did an overland trip and on the first page of the novel, Joyce, who describes herself as a nobody, is looking back fifty years later after an otherwise uneventful life, recollecting the trip. There had been scandal and controversy at the time of their voyage and she had slipped under the radar. A recent visit to a car boot sale in the grounds of an old country house has awakened memories and now she is reliving the trip.\n\nI saw Persia in the time of the Shah, and the sun set over Kabul and the sun rise at Taj Mahal. I was there too and this is my story.\n\nOverland thus begins with an advertisement in a London newspaper in 1970.\n\nKathmandu by van, leave August\n\nShare petrol and costs.\n\nJoyce is just out of secretarial college and comes across the ad because she likes reading the miscellaneous section of the newspaper. She goes to Clapham to meet the two boys who are taking the Land Rover on the trip. Friends from boarding school Fred, whose aristocratic family own the vehicle, and Anton, son of an Egyptian Doctor and English mother, who has been supported by Fred’s family since a family tragedy.\n\nThe Aristocrat, The Son of an Immigrant, A Working Class Girl\n\nIt becomes clear that the three travellers are from different socio-economic backgrounds and being confined to a vehicle for a trip through foreign lands is going to bring out aspects of what each of them is either escaping or moving towards. When Anton asks Joyce why she wants to go, she can tell he’s looking for an intellectual response and sceptical of her motives. Reasons she keeps to herself (and from the reader) for a long while.\n\nFirst impression: arrogant little twit. My face was burning with embarrassment at having been corrected, but he didn’t seem to notice. I might not have all your certificates, but I know about real life, I thought.\n\nThere’s No Place Like Home\n\nThe three of them go on the journey and have to overcome various challenges they confront in each country, whether cultural, mechanical or human. Over time their characters and back stories are revealed and in Fred’s case his father’s dark history, in one of the countries they will travel to. All of this plays into how they cope with the situations they encounter. And they come to consider their own destiny.\n\nIn a nutshell, if I could have articulated it, I’d have said that England was my destiny. Because by that point – although I liked those landscapes and those wild places that we drove through, don’t get me wrong – a realisation was growing in me, more and more, about the sheer beauty of the English countryside.\n\nThey will discover the consequences of acting or not acting on their instincts, who they can trust, who they should avoid and what to do when one of them starts experimenting in ways that threaten to derail them from their objective.\n\n“We were all on pretty much the same route, there were only so many digs to stay in. So even though we were crossing the world, there was a small world on the overland, its own little bubble, the same faces and names and rumours recirculated and resurfaced.”\n\nThe Memory Trip\n\nI enjoyed the novel for the way it depicted the journey and the places they stopped, mostly unfamiliar until they get to India, then it awakened my own overland journey, particularly the memory of taking the local night buses, with 3 people per seat (no headrest) and trucks/buses driving in the middle of the road in the dark of night. (We soon understood what “HORN PLEASE” on the back of the vehicle in front referred to). Yes, the all night loud music playing to keep the driver awake (ear plugs essential), stopping for sweet roadside chai, meeting young Indian astronomers on their way to view the total solar eclipse in Fatepar Sikri.\n\nUltimately, the overland is an opportunity to immerse in a culture, live for a period in a different way, encounter different ways of thinking and being, different perspectives, that much of this was missed in their journey taints the possibility of this experience having any meaning.\n\nI enjoyed less the depiction of the dysfunctional character of Fred and the obsessive, slightly unreliable narrator Joyce. Anton was the more interesting character for me, due to his interest in the culture and languages and people, so without giving anything away, the ending was disappointing, but maybe that’s the message, about who in this life gets protected and who falls into the cracks.\n\nSo, there is the significance of the roles each of them played, their own histories, that of their families, the different social class they issued from and how that figured in the way they behaved and how they end up.\n\nAlwynne, one of my Goodread’s friends articulates the themes succinctly here, in and extract from her review:\n\n“Khan’s novel’s convincing, beautifully-observed and meticulously researched, making it hard sometimes to remember Joyce is a purely fictional creation. This isn’t a nostalgic glimpse at lost innocence, instead Khan’s narrative gradually constructs a damming portrait of a newly post-colonial world, casually racist, steeped in orientalist attitudes. A place where, for people like Joyce and Fred, nation, the myth of empire, class and identity are still tightly intertwined. Khan’s exploration of these connects to an oblique, underlying series of reflections on history, memory and the legacy of imperialist atrocities – and above all the failure to take responsibility or atone for the evils of the past. But despite the complexity of Khan’s themes, it’s highly readable. An absorbing, fluid piece.”\n\nHighly Recommended.\n\nYasmin Cordery Khan, Author\n\nYasmin Cordery Khan is a novelist and historian. Her first book, The Great Partition: the Making of India and Pakistan (2007), won the Gladstone Prize for History from the Royal Historical Society. Her second book was The Raj At War: A People’s History of India’s Second World War (2015) followed by the novel Edgeware Road (2022).\n\nShe has written for the New Statesman and Guardian and appeared on BBC radio and television, and is an editor of History Workshop Journal and a trustee of the Charles Wallace India Trust. She lives in Oxfordshire.\n\nWomen in Translation\n\nTidal Waters is my first August read for #WIT month. Reading Women in Translation.\n\nWhat an original, good-hearted, open, vulnerable read. I’m not sure whether what I read was fictional or not, because much of what is described in the ‘letters to a close friend’ coincides with elements in the author bio inside the front cover of the book and the main character is Vel.\n\nThe Epistolary Novel\n\nAn epistolary narrative, it is about the return to a place and finding new purpose, along with the motivation to pursue it and taking others with you – told through a correspondence that bears witness and though we don’t see the replies, we can tell that they encourage and support both the idea(s) and the woman pursuing it.\n\nI don’t know if I mentioned this specifically, perhaps not in a letter, though maybe when we met up before I left to come and live here here for good, but part of what pushed me to make this radical life change was the need to feel that my existence had meaning, that I was spending each day doing something I cared about and could feel proud of at the end of my life. And that’s just what I found in being Seño Velia, the woman who has meetings with people about books, who tries to motivate children to love reading and books as much as she does, and who supports the teachers.\n\nFinding Purpose and Motivation, In Community\n\nThe letters span 3 years from May 2015 and they track a significant change in Vel’s life as she decides to return to Choco (to the Afro-Colombian community she was raised in) to start a new venture to bring reading, literacy and a love of books to it. The correspondence exhibits the growth and expansion of her writing, the letter becomes a safe harbour and she tests it by taking her writing to another level, stretching into a more personal yet contained arena.\n\nTomorrow I start a diploma in reading promotion, and with it my project, Motete. We’ve chosen three areas of Quibdo where I’ll start running the workshops.\n\nShe is taking a risk starting a new venture, but believes in it and is surrounded by extended family and connections, which facilitate her ability to reach out even further into the community and invite everyone in, to be part of or benefit from her shared love of reading.\n\nAnd so this project is coming together. This basket, this Motete, is filling up. The slogan for my project is ‘Contenidos que tejen’ – contents that weave – and every day I like it more. Every day I realise that these contents are weaving fulfillment and happiness within me…\n\nThe thing is, motetes have been used to carry food for the body: plaintains, bushmeat, fish. Our is to fill them with food for the soul: art, culture, books. And just as motetes are woven by hand, I thought these new contents would also form a fabric: the fabric of society, of community, the fabric of souls.\n\nLetter Writing\n\nHer unnamed friend that she writes to is someone she hasn’t known long, he occupies a space between the familiar and the unfamiliar that she claims as a freedom to express herself, to be vulnerable and open, someone who has mentored and shown her how to get funding. The range of things she will write to him of, span a wide spectrum.\n\nWe never see the replies but the continuation of her own correspondence displays her life, her dealing with health problems, the double bind of her wounding and love, of being raised by doting grandparents, while having complicated relationships with a teenage mother unable to mother her and an emotionally absent father. Her later sadness and depression, helped through therapy, tears and conversations, to ways of coping and healing. Her optimism for her venture, and the community connections she creates keep her going.\n\nI grew a lot. I learned. But most of all I tried to weave a new way of relating to my father that hurt as little as possible.\n\nThe Sea, The Sea\n\nOne of the themes is the sea, the absence of sea, the way the river meets the sea and her relationship to it. She yearns for it when it has been absent for some time, just as she yearns for the letter writer and the relief that comes in the act of writing to him.\n\nShe describes herself in her current role as being like the sea at that place where it meets the river.\n\nI’m like the Pacific Ocean, pressing at the river with its tides to make it flow the other way, or lapping at the land when its waters rise, when it feels like gaining inches of new ground. You need strong motivation to stick to this way of life, which isn’t exactly a fight against the world, but rather the certainty of forging your own path.\n\nAn Homage to Correspondence\n\nI loved this slender book, it’s project and generosity, its intimate sharing and platform for expanding and learning and having the courage to venture into new areas. It made me think of an exquisite title I’d forgotten about, Leslie Marmon Silko’s slim book of correspondence The Delicacy and Strength of Lace: Letters Between Leslie Marmon Silko and James Wright.\n\nThat correspondence was written when Silko was 31 years old and Wright 51. They had planned to meet in the Spring of 1980, mentioned in letters of Oct/Nov of the previous year, not knowing he would be gone before then.\n\nThey discuss her novel, his poetry, language, his travels, her adventures with animals, their speaking engagements, their mutual challenges and experiences as university professors, and soon began to share more personal feelings, as she acknowledged the tough time she was having and he shared his own experience, expressing empathy.\n\nVelia Vidal dedicates her book:\n\nTo my recipient,\n\nsimply for being there.\n\nand when I read about her own projects in society, her love of the sea and shared readings and efforts to help move children and young adults out of poverty, it is all the more inspirational to read these letters, understanding the difference a letter can make, to see someone take a risk and pursue something that will help others from her community, while fulfilling her own dreams and aspirations.\n\nHighly Recommended.\n\nVelia Vidal, Author\n\nVelia Vidal (Bahía Solano, Colombia, 1982) is a writer who loves the sea and shared readings. In 2021 she was a fellow at Villa Josepha Ahrenshoop, in Germany.\n\nFor her book Tidal Waters she won the Afro-Colombian Authors Publication Grant awarded by Colombia’s Ministry of Culture. She is the co-author of Oír somos río (2019) and its bilingual German-Spanish edition.\n\nShe is the founder and director of the Motete Educational and Cultural Corporation and the Reading and Writing Festival (FLECHO) in Chocó, one of the most isolated, complex and neglected regions in Colombia with the highest afro-descendant population density in the country.\n\nVidal graduated in Afro-Latin American Studies and has a Masters in Reading Education and Children’s Literature. She is also a journalist and specialist in social management and communication. In 2022 she was included in the list of 100 most influential and inspiring women in the world by the BBC.\n\nShe writes children’s literature, fiction and non-fiction, and poetry. Her work has been translated into German, English and Portuguese.\n\nI picked this book up because of its premise of a child having questions about her early life and origins, sensing she is being lied to by her parents.\n\nA 30 Year Story from 80’s London to Córdoba\n\nThe book is 480 pages and most of the first half is narrated by Eva as a child or teenager. It begins as she is starting school and beginning to develop friendships. She befriends Bridget Blume and is besotted. Not just by her, but by her entire family, especially her mother who is so unlike Eva’s mother whom she calls Cherie (like her father does).\n\nAt school Eva is deeply affected by a book the teacher reads ‘The Rainbow Rained Us’, in which a rabbit throws a stone at the rainbow of Noah’s Ark breaking it apart into hundreds of multicoloured mothers who repopulate the earth with children.\n\nThe Many Colours of Mother Love\n\nThere Blue Mother stood in a mesmerising cornucopia of blues, at the edge of a turquoise sea, laughing, the wind in her hair, surrounded by her blue family.\n\n‘Blue Mother is free and open and speaks from her heart.’\n\nShe sounded exactly like Bridget’s mother – utterly perfect.\n\nFrom then on she refers to her mother as Pink Mother and Bridget’s mother as Blue Mother.\n\nPink Mother was sitting upright in a kind of fairy-tale bed, a bit like my mother and father’s, a four-poster, with a roof and curtainy droops around it.\n\nNo,no,no.\n\n‘Pink Mother is delicate and feminine,’ said Miss Feast, explaining that delicate meant not strong.\n\nWhen they are asked to share a baby photo, Eva becomes even more convinced than she already was, that her mother is not her mother, there is no photo of her as a baby, nothing before the age of three and a half.\n\nThe novel’s first half follows her through primary school, her developing friendship and first great loss, first the loss of a favourite teacher, then a death that will result in her friend’s family moving to another country and then abandonment by her father, who returns to Spain and rarely if ever makes contact.\n\nEva’s personality develops and is compromised by these losses and causes her to develop or accept superficial relationships, taking some time to realise what she lost by neglecting what has been meaningful to her.\n\nHispanic Studies, La Mezquita, A Headless Nun\n\nIn the second half of the novel she has started a university degree, changing locations due to the demands of her boyfriend Michael.\n\nThe pace really picks up in this half, perhaps because we have left the child narrator behind, so Eva becomes less introspective and more in charge of acting on the questions and thoughts she has and voicing some of the strong opinions she has.\n\nWhen told they will spend a summer semester in Córdoba, Spain, the separation from all that is familiar and expected of her, marks the beginning of a transformation and a quest into looking for the answer to questions she has about her origins.\n\nThe second half is something of an adventure as she develops a new friend Carrie who is interested in helping her and the two begin to consider not returning to their previous lives, to stay in Córdoba.\n\nAs Eva enters her 20’s her relationships and perspective begin to evolve, although she remains somewhat detached, circumspect and emotionally distant. With the presence of those around her, she begins to understand the complexity of being a mother, of being mothered and that judgments can change, as can people, especially when they find those relationships that are mutually nurturing.\n\nThe final third of the jumps into a second person narrative perspective ‘you’ and becomes somewhat nostalgic and didn’t work quite so well as the preceding chapters. It’s like the beginnings of a letter to a little girl who is still a baby, perhaps the thing that she had missed from her own life, being provided for another.\n\nWriting From Experience versus Imagination or Observation\n\nIt is an interesting and captivating read, however I couldn’t help but feel as I was reading that this was imagined, rather than felt, because I am interested in books, fiction or nonfiction that come from the experience of separation.\n\nIn an interview with Carolyn Ray of JourneyWoman Bookclub, Joanna Glen shared that one of her aims was to explore the question, What is Our Deepest Longing?\n\nI suppose the motherhood theme came next thinking what is our deepest longing that we have right from the beginning and of course a baby’s deepest longing is to gaze into the mother’s eyes and receive the gaze of love back. So I was thinking, what would be the most powerful or perhaps the saddest lack, would be not to feel that connection. That would be a very visceral fundamental lack.\n\nShe shares more about her own experience in the interview, which was the opposite of what she explores in the novel regarding the mother child connection, but brings alive the adventure of living abroad, in the town of Córdoba as a young person.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable summer read that is likely to spark an interest in Córdoba, if like me you have never been there and one that celebrates female friendship and connection across different age groups and cultural backgrounds.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTripFiction Review: All My Mothers by Joanna Glen, coming of age novel mainly set in Córdoba.

Matthew Arnold\n\nThe Hand That First Held Mine by Maggie O’Farrell was the winner of the former Costa Novel Award in 2010.\n\nI read and really enjoyed O’Farrell’s memoir I Am, I Am, I Am – Seventeen Brushes With Death, the first of her books I encountered and Hamnet, which won the Women’s Prize for Fiction (2020).\n\nI have The Marriage Portrait still to read, however I was curious to discover more of her earlier work and decided to read this one next.\n\nDual Narrative, Dual Timeline\n\nThis novel is narrated as two stories of two couples, one set in 1950’s/60’s that centres around Lexie, a rebellious university graduate who has been asked to apologise for using a door for men, before receiving her degree.\n\nAt home in Devon with her parents, she is about to abandon them all, the academic institution and her family for London, after Innes, a 34 yr old sports car driving art dealer, journalist, critic and self-confessed hedonist, breaks down not far from the field where she is sulking.\n\nInnes has been in St Ives, visiting the studio of an artist whose work he’d been hoping to buy. He had found the artist rather drunk and the work far from completion. The whole excursion had been a raging disaster. And now this.\n\nLexie will move to London, creating an unconventional life and career in 1950’s Soho guided by her pleasure seeking lover, but with the spiteful eye of one who wishes her harm. Inne’s past will come to haunt Lexie’s future, and she will throw herself into her career, doing what she can to maintain her independence.\n\nHis father, he tells her, was English, but his mother was a mestizo from colonial Chile. Half Chilean, half Scottish, he explains, hence his Hibernian Christian name and also his black hair.\n\nThere’s much more to Lexie’s story, but to share any more of it would spoil the discovery for new readers of this compelling mystery. It is one of those novels where you know the narrative threads are going to connect and so each revelation keeps you guessing, until it eventually becomes clear.\n\nPresent Day London, Forgetting\n\nIn the present day (2010) Elina, a Finnish woman in London and her boyfriend Ted, have just had a baby boy and she recalls nothing about the birth or the 3 days spent in hospital.\n\nShe tests herself, scans her mind. Has she remembered anything? Has it come back to her while she was sleeping? The birth, the birth, the birth, she intones to herself, you must remember, you have to remember. But no. She can recall being pregnant. She can see the baby here, lying in her lap. But how it got there is a mystery.\n\nNot only has their life been turned upside down, but Ted is having memory flashes of childhood, but the images he is seeing are not like what his parents have told him. He knows what happened to Elina, but for now he is not sharing it.\n\nFour days ago, she’d almost died.\n\nThe thought has a physical effect on him. One of disorientation and nausea, like seasickness or looking down from a high building. He has to lean his head in his hands and breathe deeply, and he feels the earlier tears crowding into his throat.\n\nSlowly, the two of them begin to piece together the missing elements from their stories. Ted confronts his mother and finds her unhelpful. But since the birth of his son, the flashes of scenes from the past revisit him with increasing frequency.\n\n‘Do you remember…?’ he asks, then has to break off to think. ‘A man came to the house once. And you … you sent him away. I think. I’m sure you did.’\n\n‘When?’\n\n‘Years ago. When I was small. A man in a brown jacket. Sort of untidy hair. I was upstairs. You were arguing with him. You said – I remember this – you said, “No, you can’t come in, you have to leave.” Do you remember that?\n\nWhen Traumatic Events Awaken the Past\n\nEveryone is being confronted with challenges and O’Farrell deftly carries the reader through them all, and keeps us puzzling over the mysteries underpinning each of their lives.\n\nThere is a level of unease and intrigue that is present throughout the narrative, that quickens the pace of readings, as we realise that not all characters are being honest or have good intentions.\n\nSecrets, lies, infidelities, manipulative jealousies, tragedy and the unconditional love of true motherhood. The novel has emotional depth and psychological insight, while keeping up a well thought our plot.\n\nAn absolutely riveting read with brilliant storytelling and just enough withholding to allow the slow reveal of mystery and deception.\n\nHighly Recommended.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe Guardian/Observer review: The Hand That First Held Mine by Maggie O’Farrell – Elizabeth Day enjoys a compelling novel of memory and motherhood, 25 Apr 2010\n\nNPR review: A Moving Look At The Bonds Of Motherhood by Jessa Crispin, 27 Apr 2010\n\nAuthor, Maggie O’Farrell\n\nMaggie O’Farrell is a Northern Irish novelist, now one of Britain’s most acclaimed and popular contemporary fiction authors whose work has been translated into over 30 languages.\n\nHer debut novel After You’d Gone won the Betty Trask Award and The Hand That First Held Mine the Costa Novel Award (2010).

She lives in Edinburgh.\n\nBoy Swallows Universe is the debut novel of Australian author and journalist Trent Dalton, who shared with audiences during the promotional tour of his novel (now a 7 episode Netflix series) that the book was semi-autobiographical, 50/50 fact and fiction.\n\nEli “does a lot of what I would have [done if I could]. It was all wishful thinking.”\n\nWhile much of what occurs is true, it reads like a crime, suspense and thriller novel, with unforgettable characters. It is set in a suburb of Brisbane in 1985 and follows a boy through dark, dangerous and at times magical teenage years, intent on changing his family’s lives.\n\nComing of Age Amid Drug Wars, Corruption and Crim’s\n\nYour end is a dead blue wren.\n\nBoys Swallows Universe begins with this cryptic opening line, one of many that appear throughout the text, clues that are eventually resolved in this unique family saviour mystery.\n\nEli Bell is the main character, he is 13 years old; his brother August, a year older does not talk, he spells words in the air with his finger. He has not spoken since something happened in the past that Eli doesn’t remember. To do with their father. Who he also does not remember.\n\nI can see my brother, August, through the crack in the windscreen. He sits on our brown brick fence writing his life story in fluid cursive with his right forefinger, etching words into thin air.\n\nFinding Meaning and Escape in the Details\n\nTheir occasional babysitter Slim, a man who spent a quarter century in jail for the alleged murder of a taxi driver, has taught Eli the importance of details. It’s how he survived the hole. Creating double meanings for here (in the jail) and there (the boundless universe in his head and heart).\n\nWhen he grows up Eli wants to be a crime reporter for the local newspaper. Slim writes lots of letters to his mates still in prison (using a false name) and suggests Eli can practice by writing letters as well. He has a penpal Alexander Bermudez, once sergeant-at-arms of the Rebels outlaw motorcycle gang.\n\nSlim says a good way for me to remember the small details of my life is to associate moments and visions with things on my person or things in my regular waking life that I see and smell and touch often. Body things, bedroom things, kitchen things. This way I will have two reminders of any given detail for the price of one.\n\nA Stupid Plan, A Secret Plan and a Well Meaning Busybody\n\nThe boys live with their mother Frankie Bell and her boyfriend Lyle. The boys get on with Lyle, although Eli has not forgiven him for getting his mother addicted to heroin. Lyle wants to save them all and has a fast track, risky idea about how to do it.\n\nWhen Lyle’s plan backfires, Eli and August are thrust into survival mode and Eli takes this further with his own big secret plan by going into full on rescue mode, investigative detective, naive peacemaker, all with the aim of trying to get his family back together and his future career on track. Ironically for all the calculated risks it requires, it is his schoolteacher getting too interested in their welfare that worries him.\n\nMrs Birkbeck leans in closer across her desk. There’s something pious in the way she sits.\n\n‘What I’m trying to say, Eli, is that trauma and the effects of trauma can change the way people think. Sometimes it can make us believe things that are not true. Sometimes it can alter the way we look at the world. Sometimes it can make us do things we normally would not do.’\n\nSly Mrs Birkbeck. Woman wants to suck me dry. She wants me to throw her a bone about my missing bone.\n\n‘Yeah, trauma is pretty weird, I guess,’ I say.\n\nEli’s experience of trauma results in him having a highly intuitive subconscious, that combined with a fearless instinct for asking straight up questions push him forward on his quest. The red telephone in the secret dugout room of Lyle’s house is something of an enigma, why does it always ring when he is in there and who is the voice that responds?\n\nA Funny, Thoughtful, Hair-Raising Life Adventure\n\nBoy Swallows Universe is an exceptionally well told tale of a young boy Eli Bell surviving a tumultuous childhood, exposed to the effect of adults involved in drug dealing, of violent school mates, an unusual babysitter and some other hopeful, inspirational characters that make it all worthwhile.\n\n“All of me is in here. Everything I’ve ever seen. Everything I’ve ever done. Every girl I ever kissed on a wagged school day, every punch I ever threw, every tooth I ever lost in a Housing Commission street scrap and every flawed, conflicted, sometimes even dangerous Queenslander I’ve ever come across, as the son of two of the most incredible and beautiful and sometimes troubled parents a kid could ever be born to.” Trent Dalton\n\nThis is no story of misery, it is about solidarity between brothers and the tenacity of a boy who won’t accept the way things are, he questions everything and everyone, asking forbidden questions, training himself in observing the details and taking action. Never giving up.\n\nHe is trying to save his mother, his mute brother August and himself from the terrible trauma cycles they are all stuck in. He is determined to grow up and become a crime reporter for a local newspaper and to meet the enigmatic Caitlyn Spies.\n\n“The key characters all draw on the people I love most in the world. The most beautiful and complex people I’ve ever known, and I never even had to walk out the door of my house to find them. I just wanted to give the world a story. To turn all these crazy and sad and tragic and beautiful things I’ve seen into a crazy, sad, tragic and beautiful story.”\n\nBrilliantly told, unforgettable characters, a wonderful balance between grounded in the dark reality of a dysfunctional family, a seedy underworld and the ethereal escape of two boys with an ability to dream and imagine their way through the darkest moments of an unsettling childhood.\n\nSo many highlighted passages, one of the reading highlights of 2024 for me. Highly Recommended.\n\nI am looking forward to reading his nonfiction book of short stories Love Stories, created when he sat on a busy street corner with a sky-blue Olivetti typewriter and asked the world a simple question: Can you please tell me a love story?\n\nFurther Reading\n\nNew York Times review: ‘Boy Follows Universe’ follows a Gritty Coming-of-Age in 1980’s Australia by Amelia Lester, May 2019\n\nTrent Dalton on : Why I Wrote ‘Boy Swallows Universe’ Harper Collins\n\nThis book is for the never believers and the believers and the dreamers.

Now, for the first time, translated from Spanish into English.\n\nBreaking the Silence, Exploring the Consequence\n\nWith echoes of Edith Wharton’s Summer , this radical feminist novel broke the silence around abortion to reshape the way women’s bodies and rights were perceived in 20th-century Argentina.\n\nA radical feminist text, January was the first Argentine novel to represent rape from the survivor’s perspective and to explore the life-threatening risks pregnancy posed, in a society where abortion was both outlawed and taboo.\n\nThey talk about the harvest but they don’t know that by then there’ll be no turning back, Nefer thinks. Everyone here and everyone else will know by then, and they won’t be able to stop talking about it. Her eyes cloud with worry; she slowly lowers her head and herds a small flock of crumbs across the worn oilcloth.\n\nA 16 year old girl in a predicament, not of her own making discovers she is pregnant, but not by the young man she dreams of. She is the daughter of peasant farm workers and has limited options, but will pursue them all the same, in order to try and avoid the inevitable, forced outcome that awaits her once her secret becomes known.\n\nShe is just of an age where she begins to notice and feel something for someone around her, but her virtue is stolen by another. Instead of imagining love, she imagines death, and wonders if this might be when her will finally see her.\n\nShe no longer cares about anything besides this thing that consumes her days and nights, growing inside her like a dark mushroom, and she wonders if it shows in her eyes as they remain fixed on her worn-out espadrilles, two little gray boats on the tile floor, or in her hands crossed in her lap, or in her hair burned by the perm.\n\nThe novella follows her panic, her attempt to find resolution without support, her symptoms, her desperation to seek absolution, her confession, her realisation of the terrible consequence, the life sentence, the marriage plot.\n\nThis thought floods her with a tide of anxiety as she remembers her secret. A sense of impotence rises to her throat, as if time has become something solid and she can almost hear its unstoppable current conspiring with her own body, which has betrayed her, tossing her to the mercy of the days.\n\nShe lives in rural Argentina, a conservative catholic environment, an unruly place for a young girl.\n\nWhat will happen to her in this place that reveres the cloth, that judges and shames girls regardless of their innocence?\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe New York Review of Books: Nefer’s Mission by Lily Meyer\n\nThe New Yorker: The Abortion Plot: A newly translated novel by the Argentinean writer Sara Gallardo provides a missing link in the history of abortion literature, by S. C. Cornell\n\nSara Gallardo: Recently rediscovered Argentine writer by Jordana Blejmar (University of Liverpool) & Joanna Page (University of Cambridge).\n\nit is perhaps her abiding concern for the ‘Other’ – marginalized, solitary characters, women, animals, monsters, even elements of nature – that gives Gallardo’s literature its most powerful political dimension…\n\nAuthor, Sara Gallardo\n\nSara Gallardo was born in Argentina in 1931 to an aristocratic Catholic family. She became a journalist in 1950 and was twenty-seven years old when her powerful debut January was published in 1958.\n\nShe grew up in Buenos Aires in a family of men so famous there are streets named after them all over Argentina (all key figures in the constitution of the Argentine nation): her grandfather Ángel Gallardo was a civil engineer and politician; her great-grandfather Miguel Cané was a journalist, senator, and diplomat; and her great-great-grandfather Bartolomé Mitre was president of Argentina from 1862-1868.\n\nBy the time she died in 1988 she had published more than a dozen books, including collections of short stories and essays. Gallardo has been compared to Lucia Berlin or Shirley Jackson.\n\nJanuary is considered required reading across Argentina.\n\nDaughters Beyond Command is a wide ranging chronicle of 1970’s France, seen through the eyes of the Malivieri Catholic family with three daughters, living in an apartment in Aix-en-Provence. It traverses issues of family, feminism, worker’s rights, class, animal rights, amid the rapid transformation of society in the 19070’s France.\n\nWhile the story follows the changing lives and events, in particular of the daughters and the mother (we don’t learn too much about Bruno, the father), it also demonstrates the shifts in society and of generations that occur through the way these daughters seek their independence. It contrasts with the way their mother harbours secrets and makes other complicit when she does share what she would prefer to hide.\n\nRegardless of their ages or circumstances, the country and the world is changing and attitudes and behaviours are shifting and everyone is forced to reckon with the changes as they impact them in different ways, raising consciousnesses and often unable to maintain previous ways of being .\n\nSabine, the eldest wants to work in theatre and acting and will do everything she can to pursue that dream in Paris. Fiercely independent, she has developed an irritation around comfort and conformity.\n\nShe watched as Maria set the table under Michelle’s authority. She looked at the framed photographs of her cousins who had not yet come home.Happy times on horseback, in cars, on boats. It was like a huge advertising campaign. It filled her with rage. There had to be something behind this publicity for the life she was being shown, both here and at home, in the silver frames of photographs, or poor people’s kitchens, behind the slogans like Moulinex Sets a Woman Free, the injunctions to promote progress, comfort, and the frenzied pursuit of happiness, luxury, and family life, there was something else. Which could be neither bought nor sold.\n\nThe second sister Hélène has been seduced by the trappings and comfort of this sophisticated Parisian family. Sabine can’t understand why she chooses to spend so much time with them, a family that lives in a way beyond anything they have ever experienced. Hélène spends most of her holidays with the family who don’t have daughters; the Uncle who has taken a particular interest in her. That regular proximity changes some of her habits, including the way she speaks.\n\nIt was a betrayal of the Malivieri clan, and Sabine was astonished that her sister could flaunt her bonds of dependence so naturally.\n\nHélène will also leave home early and pursue an education Paris, supported by her Uncle. She is less outspoken but equally passionate, affected by moral question around the protection and rights of animals.\n\nAs time passed, a breach had come between Hélène and her parents; adaptation upon her return required quickly taking stock of her loved ones. She saw her father, whose kindness and altruism for everything he could not lavish on his family financially. She saw her mother, hard-working and attentive, doggedly managing her household, and the rare moments she seemed to cast off her condition as a housewife, when she really seemed to be her true self, were when they visited Laurence on Saturday afternoons at her bastide.\n\nThe student riots of May ’68 had an impact on the nation and caused both fear and admiration in these adults trying to figure out how to parent their daughters, growing up surrounded by influences they could not control.\n\nAs the lives of the daughters changes, so too does the outside world. Simone de Beauvoir and Gisèle Halimi found the movement Choisir la cause des femmes (Choose the Cause of Women) in 1971 to decriminalise abortion in France, riot police storm the Lip watch factory that had been occupied by workers for three months, forcibly removing them; there is talk and images of the horrors of Vietnam, of the desire for freedom, respect for the proletariat, and the lyrics of the Bob Dylan song The Times Are A Changin’, the death of the President Georges Pompidou.\n\nSabine told her his name was Bob Dylan and that his song said, more or less, that the world was changing, you had to keep your eyes open,and the parents had better watch out, their sons and their daughters were beyond their command. It was a political song.\n\nAs time passes and events happen the sisters find a way to strengthen their bond despite their differences, separating from each other and then coming together in solidarity, while their parents seem stuck in time. Agnes, the mother is unable to stop changes happening to her, which will bring about a crisis, one the two older girls question but are again met with silence.\n\nWhile the novel isn’t necessarily about resolving any of the issues presented, it encapsulates the impact of changing times on the various members of the family in a way that I found interesting, having lived in France for around 19 years, but not during the era mentioned. So much of the landscape was familiar, and some of the references, but many were not.\n\nI appreciated the story for the depiction of what it might have been like to be part of an ordinary family growing up in this town in the 1970’s and learning about the significant events that challenged and affected people’s thinking, seen from the perspective of inside France. It is these changes in the background of the family lives and the adept writing that maintains the narrative pace.\n\nIt might be set in the 1970’s but it feels as relevant today in many respects as it did for that era of change.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nMy review of Véronique Olmi’s novella Beside the Sea (2015)\n\nListen to Bob Dylan’s The Times They Are A Changin\n\nKirkus Reviews: The personal is political for Olmi’s finely drawn characters.\n\nLitro Magazine Review: Daughters Beyond Command by Monica Cadenas\n\nAuthor, Véronique Olmi\n\nVéronique Olmi was born in 1962 in Nice and now lives in Paris.

I have enjoyed a few books by Catherine Chidgey, including Remote Sympathy (my review), The Transformation and most recently Pet.\n\nSurviving the High Country\n\nWhile the novel’s hero and narrator is a common magpie, The Axeman’s Carnival is a social commentary on the struggles of carrying on family farm traditions and tending to relationships on a remote high country farm, infused with magic realism and comic relief. The author acknowledges the use of diaries belonging to her late mother-in-law, who lived on a high country sheep station.\n\nStrong Man Chops Wood\n\nThe Axeman’s Carnival refers to a wood chopping competition, which is one of the final scenes in the novel and an event that Marnie’s husband Rob judges himself by.\n\nHe runs a hill country sheep farm in Central Otago, in the South Island of New Zealand, land that his father in part cleared of stones making it more fertile for grass, but also land that was in part lost (including his childhood home) to flooding required to create a large dam. Though he doesn’t remember the home, images of it recur often in his dreams.\n\nThe farm is struggling, they are increasingly drowning in debt and despite Marnie’s working outside the home as well as helping on the farm, her husband is volatile and easily made jealous, quick to turn his rage against his wife. When he’s not outside tending to the farm, he watches one genre of crime show.\n\nLater he watched his crime show about beautiful dead women found in alleyways, all rucked up and staring. The man who came to look at the beautiful dead women wore a gun strapped to his side and sunglasses that were also mirrors, and he said things like This was no suicide, Trent. See the spatter patterns and The perp’s taunting us. He’s dangling the victims as bait and we’re biting.\n\nSeparation from the Family of Origin\n\nOne day Marnie acquires a fledgling magpie chick and brings it inside, despite the threats from Rob. The entire novel is narrated from the perspective of Tama, including those first memories of being lifted into her pillowed palm.\n\nMy siblings cried out as she carried me away, calling from our nest high in the spiny branches: Father! Father! Where are you? Come back! My mother called for him too, her voice frantic and afraid – but he , hunting for food, had left us all unguarded.\n\nCan Humans Be Trusted?\n\nThe bird is named Tama, he survives and grows and when she releases him, he revisits his magpie family up in the pines, but realises they seem to have disowned him due to his association with humans.\n\nFather magpie is an expert on the faults of humans and preaches lessons to the younger generations, warning of traps and lures. When he learns what happened to his mother ‘Death by car’ and his brothers ‘Death by cold‘, he makes up his mind.\n\nTama, who has learned to use the cat door, returns to Marnie and begins to speak his first words. Because Tama is the narrator, we also hear his thoughts on what he is observing and see how he tries to navigate between the worlds of the two species he is entwined with, his magpie family and his human one.\n\nMy father kept his eye on me, waiting or me to betray myself. Every day he told me another bad story about humans: they wrung our necks, they ran us down, they shot us, they poisoned us.\n\n‘Doesn’t that bother you?’ he said.\n\n‘Yes, Father,’ I said.\n\n‘I don’t think it bothers you. I don’t think you believe me.’\n\n‘I believe you, Father.’\n\n‘You still reek of her.’\n\nBringing the Outside World In\n\nWhile Marnie is amused by Tama’s antics, her husband is irritated by his attachment to her and encroachment into their lives. But every threatening line he utters adds to the increased repository of retorts that come out of the beak of the bird.\n\nI suppose I should have tried to behave myself – and I was wary of him, don’t get me wrong. I saw the strength in his hard hands, and I knew it could lead nowhere good. I knew he’d had a gutsful. But I couldn’t keep quiet; I was my own worst enemy.\n\nWhen she creates a twitter account for the magpie, it becomes popular while being another source of disapproval by her possessive husband. Until they discover he could be a source of income and help save the farm.\n\nThe story follows the family and the impact of the internet sensation and becoming known, however none of these changes to their life or fortune transform our characters in any way. Marnie continues to try and gain approval of her husband, he remains jealous of any contact she has with others, whether around them or online. While his behaviour is checked by the presence of webcams in the home, through Tama’s eyes, we witness the relaationship unravelling with mounting dread.\n\nChampion or Brute\n\nThe narrative builds up to the carnival where he aims to become a 10 times ‘golden axes’ champion and Marnie and her sister have a surprise planned for their husbands, which she becomes increases nervous about whether it is a good idea or not.\n\nThe novel is full of clever wise-cracking moments, thanks to the mimicking retorts of the magpie, which lighten what is otherwise a threatening environment and a serious subject. Marnie is a victim of domestic violence and the only witness, Tama the talking magpie. He is the intelligent observer and hero of the novel, even if his own authenticity has been compromised by how the humans have turned him into a money making spectacle causing him to be spurned by his own.\n\nWhile the theme is covered well, including the victims tendency to make excuses for the perpetrator and the constant critical comments of a mother, ceaselessly undermining her self-worth, I was disappointed that there wasn’t real transformation or growth in the human characters. There is resolution yes, but an opportunity missed, particularly given the serious nature of the crime.\n\nAs unsettling as it is entertaining, the brilliantly written voice and antics of Tama, carry the story forward, poking fun and provoking an already tense situation, until its splintering, scorching conclusion.\n\nHighly Recommended.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe Conversation review: Catherine Chidgey’s revealing, uncomfortable novels bridge worlds by Julian Novitz, 25 Mar 2024\n\nFinancial Times review: The Axeman’s Carnival — when a magpie steals the limelight\n\nIrish Times review: An imaginative and well executed novel\n\nNew Zealand Family Violence and Economic Harm Statistics\n\nAuthor, Catherine Chidgey\n\nCatherine Chidgey is an award-winning and bestselling New Zealand novelist and short-story writer whose novels have been published to international acclaim.\n\nHer first novel, In a Fishbone Church, won the Betty Trask Award, and was longlisted for the Women’s Prize for Fiction.

Thank you kindly to Europa Editions for providing me with a copy of the book to read and review.\n\nI came across The Hypocrite randomly and was intrigued firstly by the Sicilian setting and secondly by its premise of being a clash of generational perspectives.\n\nI was also intrigued, having recently read Enter Ghost by Isabella Hammad, to discover another novel with a theatre setting. It is a thought provoking novel about the family dynamics of a daughter and her parents, played out one afternoon as she lunches with her mother, while her father watches the play downstairs. It is an awakening of sorts for them all.\n\nA Daughter Creates\n\nA young woman Sophia, has written a play. It is set in a summer holiday house on one of the Aeolian islands of Sicily, a place she spent a month with her father, typing his dictated novel, mostly hanging out alone, quietly observing the women he bedded nightly. That was 10 years ago.\n\nThe Father Watches\n\nToday, her father, the (in)famous author, attends a matinee showing of his daughter’s work for the first time. He knows nothing about the play prior to being seated in the theatre. He swiftly realises that much of the set and characters are familiar to him. This might even be about him. About that holiday. He begins to feel uncomfortable.\n\nNo stories are entirely imaginary, cherub, he’d said then. Everything is always a little bit real. Sometimes you steal things from other stories and change them until they work how you like.\n\nHe wonders if the people sitting either side of him know who he is. He begins to prepare defences in his mind. He decides to interact with the young woman who had been seated next to him.\n\nHe thinks, I have never been any good at arguing. I have only ever said what is on my mind. So he asks her, without malice, whether she dislikes him because of what they’ve both watched; does his best to keep his breathing steady in the interval between his question and her answer.\n\nRound Glasses is blunt. She disliked him before, she says. And the play is no great shakes.\n\nThe Mother Bitches\n\nUpstairs in the theatre restaurant, the daughter dines with her mother. She spends most of the meal talking about her ex-husband. She has re-experienced living with him for a period during lockdown. Unaware, she begins to create a scene.\n\nThe narrative shifts between the father observing the play unfold, the daughter listening to the mother complain of him and that month long holiday in the past that inspired her to write the play.\n\nIn Sicily, Sophia had looked forward to spending the longest uninterrupted time with her father she had ever had. She did not realise that she would spend most of the time alone or in the company of Anto, the nephew of the woman who cleaned the house. Her father would be absent to her, except when dictating his chauvinistic novel. She would observe and learn things.\n\nWe Are all Products of Them and Ourselves\n\nThe novel explores the unmet expectations of each character in the family trio, their deafness to each other’s desire and the clash of generational perspectives.\n\nThe contradiction of the time had been the heightened moral obligation to consider other people as a means to keeping one’s own self-interest afloat. Showing other people care meant avoiding them.\n\nThe scenes pass in a kind of circumambulation, one after the other, progressing onward.\n\nRevelation comes slowly to the father seeing himself from another’s perspective, through actor’s on a stage, where he cannot interrupt or change the narrative, he is forced to bear witness.\n\nHeld To Account, Punished and Portrayed\n\nThe mother is witnessed by both the daughter and the waiter, who forces her to account for her deteriorating behaviour. This is not the family home, no dsyfunction permitted.\n\nThe daughter equally will be challenged by a random stranger in a public place.\n\nIt is not quite a reckoning, but a challenge to each of them to see what they are not seeing, to pause from the habit of inflicting a perspective on others.\n\nThe novel puts on stage personal power, public perception and creative potential and asks it audience to consider the responsibility and ambiguity of creating art, mining lives and the sanctity or not (for art) of relationships.\n\nSo who is the hypocrite?\n\nEveryone it seems.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe Guardian Review: The Hypocrite by Jo Hamya review – sharp generational shame game by Miriam Balanescu, 12 May, 2024\n\nThe Guardian Interview: Jo Hamya ‘Could I just write one massive grey area?’ by Hephzibah Anderson 20 Apr, 2024\n\nJo Hamya, Author\n\nJo Hamya was born in London. After living in Miami some years, she completed an English degree at King’s College London and a Masters in contemporary literature and culture at Oxford University. She has worked as a copyeditor for Tatler, edited manuscripts published by Edinburgh University Press and Doubleday UK.\n\nShe has written for the New York Times, Guardian and Financial Times. Currently, she works as an in-house writer and archivist for the Booker Prizes and its authors and is a PhD candidate at King’s College London.\n\nHer debut novel was Three Rooms (2021). She lives in London.\n\nThis was my third novel by Percival Everett, having very much enjoyed So Much Blue (2017) and Erasure (2001). I knew James would be quite a different premise because it is connected to the well known, classic adventure story of Huckleberry Finn.\n\nI have a brief sense of familiarity with Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, I may have seen episodes of a television show when I was a child. I wasn’t sure if I had ever read the book it is based on. I don’t think so. Boy and the Sea Beast by Ann de Roo was more my kind of adventure story.\n\nSet in the period just before the American civil war is about to break out, we meet Jim, a black slave, waiting outside for corn bread. Two boys, Tom and Huck are trying to play a trick on him and plan to steal something from the kitchen.\n\nA Boy, A Young Man or an Adult\n\nI admit that for the first 60 pages I thought Jim was a young boy too. When on page 62 he asks after his wife and child I shift my perspective. The way the two boys were interacting with him (pranking him) seemed appropriate towards another boy, not a man.\n\nIn a world where slavery exists, relationships have a perverse hierarchy, one that is demonstrated from the opening scene of the novel. When I go back and close read I see where there were signs I missed.\n\nJim helps collect wood and takes a risk by putting some aside (hidden) for different members of his family and community.\n\nThe weather remain unseasonably cold and I found myself pilfering wood for not only April and Cotton, but also my family and a couple of others. I was terribly concerned that the wood might be missed, and that fear worked its way into reality one Sunday afternoon.\n\nHe hears that the owner is planning to sell him to a man in New Orleans. Without waiting for morning Jim decides to escape, though he feels bad about leaving his family. He is determined to find a way to raise the funds to free his family from slavery.\n\n“You can’t run,” Sadie said. “You know what they do to runaways.”\n\n“I’ll hide out. I’ll hide out on Jackson Island. They’ll think I’ve run north, but I’ll be there. Then I will figure out something.”\n\nHe heads down to the river, the Mississippi, crosses to an island where he finds a safe place to rest a while. To his surprise he encounters the boy Huck, who is running from his abusive, drunkard father Pap. It is not good news, because Huck has left things in a way that people will believe him to have been murdered. And now Jim is missing.\n\nLanguage and Expectations\n\nWhenever Jim is around Huck, he speaks in a certain way, a kind of dialect. We know that Jim has had access to the house library in the past, that he can read, write and articulate, but he must suppress his ability to understand intellectually and more importantly hide his capable manner of his speech, in order to keep him safe from those whose racist ways of thinking will be threatened by a man showing superior comprehension.\n\nWhen Jim gets bitten by a snake and spends a few nights in a fever, his dream time ramblings put him at risk. He starts having conversations with Voltaire and other French philosophers, a pattern that emerges whenever he enters dream state. (And typical of Everett to throw in French literary motifs – they add both comic relief and increase the danger surrounding the protagonist). His subconscious is unable to hide the knowledge he has acquired over the years.\n\nFrançois-Marie Arouet Voltaire put a fat stick into the fire. His delicate fingers held the wood for what seemed like too long a time.\n\nOn the inside cover there is a map of the river and the locations on his journey south where they will have different encounters, where they become separated for a while. Each time they are separated, sometimes for a significant period, they manage to find each other again.\n\nHow To Trust a Man\n\nIt is not easy for Jim to trust another man. The people he encounters may be slaves or white men, or men passing as white, or white men. Each encounter presents a situation he must navigate, an aspect of the society within which they live, how different people are.\n\nHe has withheld information from Huck that might have benefited him. He considers telling him, but fears he might be angry and betray him, causing his capture.\n\nOne of the most uncomfortable encounters he has is with a travelling minstrel show, a band of white men who put on a show and sing to people, songs that mock black people. While the man who runs that show says he does not believe in slavery, he “hires” Jim as a tenor for his show. This presents the farcical and most dangerous situation as he is be painted to be a black man as if he were a white man.\n\nThe most costly, traumatic episode for Jim comes following the help of four men he encounters at the riverside. They ask what they might bring him and he asks for a pencil. It is a most dangerous thing for an enslaved man to have on him or for another to source for him and the cost will be high. They also understand its power and want him to have it.\n\nTo Read and Write, A Subversive Act\n\nThe discovery of abandoned books and paper is one of the most significant discoveries Jim makes. It marks the beginning of a new stage in his life. He is going to write. About his life and its meaning. His first attempt is with a stick, the pencil he obsesses over and eventually acquires will bring further elucidation.\n\nI really wanted to read. Though Huck was asleep, I could not chance his waking and discovering me with my face in an open book. Then I thought, How could he know that I was actually reading? I could simply claim to be staring dumbly at the letters and words, wondering what in the world they meant. How could he know? At that moment the power of reading made itself clear and real to me. If I could see the words, then no one could control them or what I got from them. They couldn’t even know if I was merely seeing them or reading them, sounding them out or comprehending them. It was a completely private affair and completely free and, therefore, completely subversive.\n\nA Turning Point\n\nThere comes a point where Jim has had enough experiences and encountered sufficient people that his purpose becomes stronger and clearer and his fear dissipates. The mood is changing as groups of young people begin to amass to fight in the war. At this point he turns around and heads back north, from where he came. His purpose changes, becomes clear, his resolve strong.\n\nIt marks a shift in his relations with those around him, including Huck. He has encountered help and harm from different quarters, he has taken risks and overcome adversity. He moves from “running from” to “running towards”. His language changes and he begins to take on the character of a leader.\n\nI thought it was an excellent novel and collection of encounters that confronted many of the issues and circumstances of the society they lived in at the time and the dangers a runaway slave had to navigate in order to seek freedom. How the journey changed him and the inevitability of violence taking a place in the life a man, not prone to violence, but brought to it by the oppression and injustice surrounding him.\n\nI love that we are beginning to see a narrative shift in stories, in terms of the perspective from which stories are told and the nuance of character developed in those who have been sidelined or typecast.\n\nFrom Book to Film, Writing Slant\n\nI’m looking forward to what the partnership between Percival Everett and Taika Waititi will create, in bringing this story to the big screen, a creative partnership just announced this past week.\n\nWith my pencil, I wrote myself into being. James\n\nPercival Everett, Author\n\nPercival Everett is the author of over thirty books, including So Much Blue, Telephone, Dr No and The Trees, which was shortlisted for the 2022 Booker Prize and won the 2022 Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize.\n\nHe has received the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award and the PEN Center USA Award for Fiction, has been a Pulitzer Prize finalist, and is Distinguished Professor of English at the University of Southern California. His novel Erasure was adapted into the major film American Fiction.\n\nThe novel James (a reimagining of Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, told from the perspective of the enslaved Jim) was published on 11 April 2024. He lives in Los Angeles."
