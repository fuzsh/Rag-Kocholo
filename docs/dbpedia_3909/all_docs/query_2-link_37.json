Cited in the legislation were albums by The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Electric Light Orchestra, Queen, and Styx themselves.[10] ELO similarly responded with its own 1983 album Secret Messages.\n\nThe hard rocker \"Heavy Metal Poisoning,\" the fifth track on the album, begins with the backmasked Latin words \"annuit cœptis, novus ordo seclorum.\"[10] Translated from the Latin, these words mean \"[he] has favored our undertakings,[11] a new order of the ages.\"[12][13] These are the two mottoes from the Great Seal of the United States on the reverse side of the United States one-dollar bill.\n\nThe album's somewhat rock-operatic story tells of a future in which a fascist and theocratic government and the \"MMM (the Majority for Musical Morality)\" have outlawed rock music. The story's protagonist, Robert Orin Charles Kilroy (DeYoung), is a former rock star who has been imprisoned by MMM leader Dr. Everett Righteous (Young).[14] He escapes using a disguise (according to the album's famous song \"Mr. Roboto\") when he becomes aware that a young musician, Jonathan Chance (Shaw), is on a mission to bring rock music back.\n\nVocalist and keyboardist Dennis DeYoung conceived Kilroy Was Here as an album and accompanying stage show, which opened with a short film of the same name. According to the episode of Behind the Music featuring Styx, the early part of the supporting tour was a financial disaster, due to the fact that Styx had booked small, theater-sized venues for a more intimate experience, while later tour dates saw the group performing in large arenas to sold-out crowds. The album debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 in its first week and sold over 1 million copies (although some sources say 2.5 million copies) and peaked at No. 3 on the US charts; however, it broke the streak of multi-platinum albums for Styx, and ushered in a more keyboard-oriented, theatrical direction.\n\nIn an interview with the Chicago Tribune, James Young talked about the creative differences in the band, and what led to their breakup: \"Dennis really wanted to do these soft, intimate love ballads, and that was against the grain for me and Tommy Shaw, so our differences got magnified, because Dennis was insisting on going outside the boundaries we lived with. He's an assertive and strongly opinionated guy.\"[15]\n\nDespite the album's financial and chart success, after the Kilroy tour, the songs were not performed live by the band Styx (who fired DeYoung in 1999) in subsequent tours (with the exception of segments from \"Mr. Roboto\" and \"Heavy Metal Poisoning\" performed in the \"Cyclo-medley\"), until \"Mr. Roboto\" reappeared in full (in their encore) on May 30, 2018.[16] DeYoung does perform the songs \"Mr. Roboto\" and \"Don't Let It End\" regularly during his solo tours. The James Young Group performed \"Heavy Metal Poisoning\" and \"Double Life\" as well on their tour in 1993.[17]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThree of the four videos for the album, \"Mr. Roboto,\" \"Don't Let It End,\" and \"Heavy Metal Poisoning,\" were filmed at the same time and used footage from the minifilm. A fourth video, \"Haven't We Been Here Before,\" was filmed a few months after the album was released; it did not interact with the album's story.\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nStyx\n\n[edit]\n\nDennis DeYoung – vocals, keyboards, accordion\n\nJames \"JY\" Young – vocals, electric guitars, vocoder\n\nTommy Shaw – vocals, electric and acoustic guitars, shamisen, vocoder\n\nChuck Panozzo – bass guitar\n\nJohn Panozzo – drums, percussion\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n[edit]\n\nSteve Eisen – saxophone\n\nDan Barber – horn\n\nMike Halpin – horn\n\nMichael Mossman – horn\n\nMark Ohlson – horn\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nArranged & produced by Styx\n\nEngineers: Gary Loizzo, Will Rascati, Rob Kingsland\n\nApprentice engineer: Jim Popko\n\nMastering by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound, NYC\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications and sales\n\n[edit]\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/sales Canada (Music Canada)[27] Platinum 100,000^ United States (RIAA)[28] Platinum 1,000,000^\n\n^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
