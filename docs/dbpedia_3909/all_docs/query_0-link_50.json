        "text": "Greg Williams produces more cartoons than newspapers can print (or do print) — he’s got a blog called WikiWorld as an outlet for some of them. At WikiWorld, he does a one-panel cartoon to accompany some article he found at Wikipedia. It’s much cooler than it sounds.\n\nDo our history students appreciate the significance of Kilroy? Williams offers a quick cartoon to explain.\n\nIn my studies of rhetoric at the University of Arizona, one class turned to a long discussion on Kilroy. Without the internet, we had to make do with memory, logic, argument, and a quick trip to the library to see what we could find quickly.\n\nMy thesis, which I still hold, is that the presence of Kilroy marks the existence of sanity in otherwise crazy world, and that the rise of Kilroy, or Kilroyism, in war, demonstrates the spirit necessary to win. Kilroy didn’t win the war singlehandedly, of course — but it was that spirit of Kilroy that turned the tide to victory for the Americans and allies so many times, in so many places.\n\nWhy isn’t Kilroy in the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) list?\n\nMore, resources:\n\nMore of Greg Williams’ work (some of this stuff is way cool)\n\nBlogjam is good, too — why isn’t this in the Dallas Morning News every week?\n\nWikipedia entry on Kilroy\n\nKilroy is engraved in stone. Really. See the picture below.\n\nKilroy has his own website, explaining his biography\n\nJames Kilroy of Boston, Massachusetts, won a contest to determine who was the real Kilroy\n\n“Kilroy was here” exhibit at the Ohio Historical Society"
