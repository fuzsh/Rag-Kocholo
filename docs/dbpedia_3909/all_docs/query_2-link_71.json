        "text": "For this week’s Song Lyric Sunday theme words of Automated, Mechanical, Modern, and Robotic were suggested by Melanie B Cee of Sparks From a Combustible Mind. I have a feeling that I won’t be the only one this week going with the Styx song, “Mr. Roboto.”\n\n“Mr.Roboto” was written by Dennis DeYoung of the band Styx, and recorded on the Styx album Kilroy Was Here. The song reached number 3 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in April 1983. The Japanese lyrics at the beginning of the song translate in English to Thank you very much, Mr. Roboto / Until the day we meet again / Thank you very much, Mr. Roboto / I want to know your secret.\n\nKilroy Was Here was a concept album that is a commentary on censorship. “Kilroy” is the main character of the album, a famous rock star who is sent to prison for “rock and roll misfits” by the anti-rock-and-roll group the Majority for Musical Morality. In prison, workers have been replaced by robots, called Robotos, who perform menial jobs. Kilroy escapes the prison by overpowering a Roboto prison guard and hiding inside its emptied-out metal shell. This song is about his escape from jail. The story makes a statement about the dehumanizing of the working class.\n\nIn the early ’80s, the First Assembly Church of God in Ankeny, Iowa, made news by burning albums with what they considered “Satanic influences.” Styx was one of their targets because of the band’s name, Styx, which in Greek mythology, is a river that runs through hell. This got DeYoung thinking about censorship, which formed the central concept of the song. Later, he saw a documentary on robots put to work in factories. DeYoung had been to Japan with the band and was intrigued by the Japanese culture. He merged these concepts of censorship, robotics, and Japan into “Mr. Roboto,” the story of a human/robot hybrid who is called upon to save the world.\n\nFor their 1983 tour based upon the album, a short Kilroy film was shown at the beginning of every concert. The film ends in a scene where DeYoung’s character takes off his robot helmet and reveals himself to the authorities, at which point the band continued the scene live on stage, with the song “Mr. Roboto” playing, rock opera style.\n\nDeYoung said that he was surprised when it went over so well in concert. “The audience would yell ‘Kilroy,’ like they’re out of their minds at the end of the song when I play it, and I still don’t know why, because I guarantee you, 75% of them have no idea what Kilroy is doing in there,” he told Songfacts.\n\nHere are the lyrics to Mr. Roboto\n\nDomo arigato misuta Robotto\n\nMata au hi made\n\nDomo arigato misuta Robotto\n\nHimitsu wo shiritai\n\nYou’re wondering who I am-machine or mannequin\n\nWith parts made in Japan, I am the modern man\n\nI’ve got a secret I’ve been hiding under my skin\n\nMy heart is human, my blood is boiling, my brain I.B.M.\n\nSo if you see me acting strangely, don’t be surprised\n\nI’m just a man who needed someone, and somewhere to hide\n\nTo keep me alive, just keep me alive\n\nSomewhere to hide to keep me alive\n\nI’m not a robot without emotions, I’m not what you see\n\nI’ve come to help you with your problems, so we can be free\n\nI’m not a hero, I’m not a savior, forget what you know\n\nI’m just a man whose circumstances went beyond his control\n\nBeyond my control, we all need control\n\nI need control, we all need control\n\nI am the modern man, who hides behind a mask\n\nSo no one else can see my true identity\n\nDomo arigato, Mr. Roboto, domo, domo\n\nDomo arigato, Mr. Roboto, domo, domo\n\nDomo arigato, Mr. Roboto\n\nDomo arigato, Mr. Roboto\n\nDomo arigato, Mr. Roboto\n\nDomo arigato, Mr. Roboto\n\nThank you very much, Mr. Roboto\n\nFor doing the jobs nobody wants to\n\nAnd thank you very much, Mr. Roboto\n\nFor helping me escape to where I needed to\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you\n\nI want to thank you, please, thank you, oh yeah\n\nThe problem’s plain to see, too much technology\n\nMachines to save our lives. Machines dehumanize."
