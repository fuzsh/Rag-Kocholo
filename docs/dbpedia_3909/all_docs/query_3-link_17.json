        "text": "American slang term\n\nFor the graffiti character, see Kilroy was here.\n\nNot to be confused with Chav.\n\nIn modern internet slang, Chad refers to a White male who is stereotypically masculine, sexually active, athletic, and gainfully employed.[1][2][3] The term is related to the alpha/beta male dichotomy.[2][4][5][6] It originates from the 4chan message board, though it had previously been used locally in Chicago to refer to wealthy, athletic jocks from the city's northern suburbs.\n\nOrigin\n\nThe term \"Chad\" became a viral meme in the 2010s after appearing on the online message board 4chan under the name \"Chad Thundercock\".[2] Chad is described as a heterosexual White male, usually blond-haired,[1][7] who is gainfully employed, athletic, sexually active, and well-endowed.[3]\n\nYears before the term became popular online, it had been used locally in Chicago to refer to wealthy, athletic men from the city's northern suburbs.[8] In Chicago, the term was covered by a satirical website dedicated to the Lincoln Park Chad Society, a fictional social club based in the city's upscale Lincoln Park neighborhood.[9][10]\n\nManosphere and internet use\n\nFurther information: Manosphere and Internet slang\n\nThe term has come into use in incel forums and as internet slang to refer to sexually active, genetically superior men, or \"alpha males\".[11] Within the manosphere and internet culture, Chads are generally viewed as constituting the top decile in terms of genetic fitness.[12] In online animation drawings in the manosphere, a Chad is further tagged with an explicit last name and is often depicted as a muscular blond man with very pronounced masculine features. One such depiction, in the \"Virgin vs. Chad\" internet meme that originated from the /r9k/ board on 4chan in 2017, contrasts an introverted and insecure \"Virgin\" who acts normal, compared to a muscular and egotistical \"Chad\" who acts absurdly and over the top.[13] Chads are sometimes portrayed as the opposite to \"omega\" or \"beta\" males, and as physically attractive. The term Chad is sometimes used interchangeably with \"slayer\".[14] Due to their characterization as being genetically gifted and privileged—though sometimes depicted as shallow, air-headed, arrogant, and overtly sexual[15]—the term Chad is used in both a pejorative and complimentary way on incel forums and on the internet as a whole.[16][17]\n\nThe female counterpart to a Chad, in slang, is a \"Stacy\",[18][19][20][21] or previously, the \"Trixie\".[22]\n\n\"Gigachad\" is a related internet meme that uses black-and-white photographs of a muscular male model. It is used to assert one's opinion as correct, without providing evidence or reasoning.[23]\n\nSee also\n\nReferences"
