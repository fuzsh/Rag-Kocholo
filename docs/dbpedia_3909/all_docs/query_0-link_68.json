It was originally a term of endearment, probably from Middle Dutch boele ‘lover ’.\n\n‘mob’ is the standard word for a disorderly crowd. It is the colloquial term for a gang in British English, or for the mafia in US English. It is an abbreviation of the Latin mobile vulgus, ‘excitable crowd’.\n\n‘fun’ is the standard term for amusement. It is colloquial, when used as an adjective (a fun thing to do).\n\n‘dis’ (also ‘diss’) is US slang for putting a person down. It is an abbreviation of ‘disrespect’.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 2.2\n\nNote the choice of vocabulary in this extract from a literature essay.\n\nDoes it distract the reader from the ideas expressed?\n\nLady Macbeth is such a high-maintenance wife, it’s no wonder Macbeth was driven to murder Donald, but should he have taken the rap for it? We can see in the play how she is constantly egging her husband on for her own ends. She calls him out for a coward and even makes jibes about his sexuality. This probably damages his ego so much that he can’t stand up to her. He starts to believe that if he shows any fear, she’ll take it as a sign that he’s not really a man. She’s the sort of female who will use unfair means to get what she wants. He is the sort of insecure man who falls for her tactics.\n\nShow Commentary\n\nIn a recent examiner’s report, such use of contemporary words in literature essays was criticised. One example was ‘high-maintenance’ to characterise Lady Macbeth’s relationship with her husband. Terms from a twentieth-century background of psychology and problem pages seemed anachronistic. Others may disagree, on the grounds that the pupil produced an interesting, valid interpretation of the text from a modern perspective.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 2.3\n\nIdentify the non-standard word forms in the following text:\n\nslang and colloquialisms\n\nneologisms (new/invented words)\n\nabbreviations\n\nphonetic spellings (words spelt as pronounced)\n\nDescribe the situation: genre, audience, purpose.\n\nWhat degree of formality is appropriate for this situation?\n\nWelcome to the latest, brightest, most brilliant edition of Bliss.

For example,\n\n? mischew ? chewitis\n\nAs both words were created according to the rules of English morphology, both can be understood by these same rules. Most people would guess the meaning of these invented words to be something like this:\n\nmischew biting the inside of your cheek by mistake chewitis the condition arising from frequent mischewing\n\nDepending on their awareness of prefixes and suffixes, pupils may invent other potentially meaningful words such as:\n\nchew mania chew ophile anti chew ism chew arium pseudo chew dis chew ed in chew rable (as in ‘incurable’)\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 2.6\n\nWhat processes were used in the formation of these words?\n\nbabelicious fanzine telethon chocaholic mike blog lad mag cheriegate fitnesswise malformed homesick AIDS bloodthirsty demigod rustle\n\nShow Commentary\n\nbabelicious blend: babe + delicious fanzine blend: fan + magazine telethon blend: television + marathon chocaholic blend: chocolate + alcoholic mike abbreviation: from ‘microphone’ blog blend: web + log lad mag compound and clipping: lad + magazine cheriegate derivation: proper noun + new suffix –gate (from ‘Watergate’) fitnesswise derivation: fit + suffixes –ness + -wise malformed derivation: prefix mal– + form + inflection –ed homesick compound: home + sick AIDS acronym: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome bloodthirsty compound and derivation: blood + thirst + suffix –y demigod derivation: prefix demi– + god rustle onomatopoeia: from Middle English ‘rustel’\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 2.7\n\nThe following compounds all occurred in an edition of the magazine Just 17.\n\nEven if you have never seen the compound used before, is the meaning understood?\n\nWhich ones are listed in a contemporary dictionary?\n\nTable 2.3\n\nseen before understand in dictionary well-busy matchmaker tiptop chat-up close-knit bad-for-you catwalk half-decent work experience knock-out giveaway closed-circuit sell-out factfile streetwise wise-up\n\nActivity 2.8\n\nUse a dictionary to check the sources of the words underlined in this text.\n\nShe chucked a banana, chocolate and a cardigan into her duffel bag, suspecting that leotards would alarm the guy she’d agreed to meet in the spa.

Are they two separate words, two words with a hyphen, or a single word?\n\nhomework spellchecker housework chatroom coursework desktop wordprocessor laptop\n\nShow Commentary\n\nTable C.2\n\nIt is likely that the words ‘homework’ and ‘housework’ are used as a single word by the majority of language users; with the minority using a hyphen and none using two separate words. Thus the form ‘homework’ has become standard English.\n\nHowever, my computer signals (by a wiggly red underlining) concern over the following:\n\ncoursework, wordprocessor, spellchecker, chatroom\n\nYou may find some variation in the way users of the language spell these words:\n\ncourse work course-work coursework word processor word-processor word-processor spell checker spell-checker spellchecker chat room chat-room chatroom\n\nBecause the words ‘laptop’ and ‘desktop’ are currently accepted as a single word, we may predict that the same processes of change and variation will lead to the acceptance of the other common compounds.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nChapter 4\n\nActivity 4.1\n\nExplain how the verbs underlined in the box in Chapter 4 show a child’s intuitive grasp of grammar.\n\nWhat suffixes and prefixes does the child use?

(function)\n\nWhat is unusual about the child’s use of these roots for verbs?\n\n‘soup’, ‘broom’, ‘scale’, ‘earth’, ‘bread’, ‘jam’, ‘hammer’\n\n‘dark’, ‘sharp’, ‘full’, ‘flat’\n\nRe-phrase the examples in Group C to show the standard use of these verbs:\n\n‘swim’, ‘sneeze’, ‘die’, ‘fall’\n\nShow Commentary\n\nForm Function verb + –ed actions that happened in the past verb + –ing actions happening in the present un– + verb indicates opposite meaning verb + 0 (zero suffix) various functions (See Chapter 8 for a discussion of verb phrases.)\n\nYoung children show an intuitive grasp of some grammatical forms and functions. They use the ‘–ed’ and ‘–ing’ suffixes to distinguish between past and present. They know the prefix ‘–un’ can be used to express opposites. However, they use these in unconventional ways, so are being creative, rather than simply imitating language forms.\n\nVerb Roots\n\nThe child has:\n\nused an existing noun as a verb,\n\ne.g. ‘soup’ (noun) – ‘I’m souping’ (verb);\n\nused an existing adjective as a verb,\n\ne.g. ‘sharp’ (adjective) – ‘How do you sharp this?’ (verb).\n\n• ‘These flowers are sneezing me’. The standard use would be:\n\n‘I am sneezing’ or ‘These flowers are making me sneeze’.\n\nNB The verb ‘sneeze’ is normally intransitive – used without an object. The child has used ‘sneeze’ as a transitive verb – used with an object. (See Chapter 8 for the distinction between ‘transitive’ and ‘intransitive’ verbs.)\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 4.2\n\nName things you can see or hear in the classroom.

One interpretation adds these grammatical words:\n\nMy friends flew to New York, because they wanted to find some bargains in the top designer stores, but the clothes were too expensive, so they bought only a pair of jeans before returning home.\n\nThese word classes are:\n\ndeterminers my, some, the, a pronouns they prepositions to, in, of conjunctions because, but, so\n\nHide Commentary\n\nIdentify the conjunctions used in the following extract from a narrative.\n\nWhat is the effect of this style?\n\nI said, \"Who killed him?\" and he said, \"I don't know who killed him but he's dead all right,\" and it was dark and there was water standing in the street and no lights and windows broke and boats all up in the town and trees blown down and everything all blown and I got a skiff and went out and found my boat where I had her inside Mango Bay and she was all right only she was full of water.\n\n(Ernest Hemingway, After the Storm)\n\nShow Commentary\n\nThe writer uses the conjunction ‘and’ to link a series of observations. The only variation is the use of ‘but’ and ‘where’. This creates a simple, excitable voice for the narrator.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 4.5\n\nWhat words can replace these prepositions?\n\nOn the window At three o’clock Sunday the afternoon\n\nShow Commentary\n\nA number of prepositions indicate meanings related to the position – or place – of a noun. For example,\n\non, in, under, over, beside, by, at, through, behind, in front of, opposite\n\nSome of these prepositions are also used to specify time. For example,\n\nat, by, before, after, until, on, in\n\nOther common prepositions indicate meanings such as:\n\npossession of this school means by bike accompaniment with my friend\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 4.6\n\nNote the various prepositions that can follow the verb ‘take’, conveying different meanings.\n\nTake The plane took off. She took off her teacher. Don’t take on too much work. I can’t take in so much information. These books take up so much space. I’m going to take up karate.\n\nCreate as many different phrasal verbs as possible by adding a different preposition to verbs, such as ‘give’ and ‘make’.\n\nUse each one in a sentence to make the meaning clear.\n\nShow Commentary\n\nDon’t give up the fight.\n\nSay ‘Stop’ if you give in.\n\nGive over!\n\nI’ll have to make up a story.\n\nShe made up with her best friend.\n\nThey made off with the money.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nChapter 5\n\nActivity 5.1\n\nWhich word is used most often in English spoken and written language?\n\nWhere might you read, or hear, these four examples?\n\nTrain delay funeral anguish\n\nClimbers trapped on mountain\n\nEntry without permit forbidden\n\nPut cup on table\n\nWhich words have been omitted in these abbreviated structures?\n\nWhy might their role be thought of as ‘glue’ or ‘nuts and bolts’?\n\nShow Commentary\n\nIn a list of the 100 most frequently used words (The Birmingham Corpus), the top ranking word is ‘the’. This is followed closely by ‘of’, ‘and’, ‘to’ and ‘a’. In fact, most of the top 100 words are grammatical words, as opposed to content words: the frequently used main verbs are ‘said’, ‘do’, ‘think’, ‘know’, ‘get’, ‘see’ and ‘go’, and there are only two nouns – ‘people’ and ‘way’.\n\nPoster promoting a local newspaper.\n\nNewspaper headline.\n\nNotice outside a factory.\n\nSpoken by a young child.\n\nThe grammatical words have been omitted. These may include prepositions, conjunctions and auxiliary verbs, but they are usually this type of word:\n\nThere was anguish at the funeral because of the delay of a train.\n\nSome climbers were trapped on the mountain.\n\nYour entry without a permit is forbidden.\n\nPut a cup on the table.\n\nThese words can be omitted, as they do not play a significant role in conveying meaning. Their role is essential, however, in the structure of standard English. In this way, they can be compared to ‘glue’ or ‘nuts and bolts’ – generally present, but often unnoticed.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 5.2\n\nUse the substitution test to see which other words can replace ‘a’ and ‘the’.\n\nPut a cup on the table Put _ cups on _ tables\n\nShow Commentary\n\nThe following words are all determiners, as they function in a similar way in English structure:\n\nPut a cup on the table. this that your my whose which table? some cups on; all tables. these those Alison’s Fred’s\n\nApart from the possibility of using any name (‘Sally’s’, etc.) in this position, the number of determiners is finite, as it is a closed class of word.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 5.3\n\nAre these words determiners: ‘side’, ‘coffee’, ‘special’, ‘tea’, ‘main’?\n\nDoes the structure remain intact, if you remove these words from the following sentences?\n\nPut some coffee cups on those side tables.\n\nLeave my special tea cup on this main table.\n\nShow Commentary\n\nThese words do not function as determiners, as they can be removed from the structure.\n\nPut some [coffee] cups on those [side] tables. Leave my [special tea] cup on this [main] table.\n\nThey are adjectives or nouns, adding more detail.\n\n(See Chapter 6 on adjectives and Chapter 7 on noun phrases.)\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 5.4\n\nUse the substitution test to identify the nouns in the following.\n\nWhat is a must?\n\nStop being such a know-it-all.\n\nThe Unbearable Lightness of Being.\n\nNB You might also use inventive texts, such as ‘The Jabberwocky’ by Lewis Carroll, for this activity.\n\nShow Commentary\n\nThe substitution test shows that familiar nouns function in the same way as the words in question:\n\nWhat is a must? desk? tree? Stop being such a know-it-all swot idiot The Unbearable Lightness of Being piece cake packet cigarettes\n\nThis test indicates that the words are being used as nouns.)\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 5.5\n\nThe underlined words in the following text are nouns.\n\nHow can you tell a noun is plural? (form)\n\nHow do nouns show that something belongs to them? (form)\n\nWhat words often come before a noun? (function)\n\nWhat is the difference between an alligator and a crocodile? Well, first of all the alligator has a broad snout and all of its teeth in the upper jaw overlap those in the lower jaw. An alligator is slightly bigger than a crocodile, and the crocodile's snout is bigger, and narrower. You can also see a crocodile's enlarged, lower teeth even when its mouth is closed.\n\nMale alligators are called bulls. The bull is usually much larger than the female alligator. The male alligator will roar very loudly to call a mate and to scare other bulls away. Female alligators will lay their eggs in a nest.\n\n(http://www.kidscape.com)\n\nShow Commentary\n\nForm\n\nThe suffix ‘–s’ is added to many nouns to make them plural: ‘alligators’, ‘bulls’.\n\nThe suffix ‘–’s’ is added to show possession: ‘crocodile’s’.\n\nNB There are some irregular plurals in English (such as ‘mice’, ‘feet’) or remnants of Old English – ‘children’, ‘oxen’ – or the influence of Latin and Greek – ‘phenomena’, ‘media’.\n\nThe use of the apostrophe is a common source of confusion in English, well documented in Lynne Truss’s popular book on punctuation, Eats, Shoots and Leaves (2003).\n\nFunction\n\nThe determiners ‘a’, ‘an’, ‘the’, ‘its’, ‘other’, ‘their’ often occur before nouns.\n\nNB Other types of words can occur between the determiner and noun, e.g. ‘a broad snout’, ‘the upper jaw’.\n\n(See Chapter 6 on adjectives and Chapter 7 on noun phrases.)\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 5.6\n\nIdentify the nouns in the following quotation:\n\nWorkers of the world unite. You have nothing to lose but your chains.\n\nCan you add, or remove, the suffix ‘–s’ to change the word from singular to plural?\n\nIf you are not sure, try the substitution test, or your awareness of determiners.\n\nShow Commentary\n\nThe nouns are: ‘workers’, ‘world’ and ‘chains’.\n\nThe insertion and deletion of suffixes works well to identify some nouns:\n\nworker(s), chain(s)\n\nBut other nouns do not share this change in form:\n\n? worlds\n\nThe substitution test shows that other familiar nouns can occur in this position:\n\nWorkers of the world factory country, etc.\n\nThe structure determiner + noun (‘the world’, ‘your chains’) is another indication that ‘world’ and ‘chains’ are nouns. It is possible to insert a determiner before ‘workers’ – ‘the workers’.\n\nThe word ‘nothing’ does not pass these tests:\n\nnothings\n\nthe nothing\n\nIt is a pronoun and replaces a noun or noun phrase:\n\nYou have all your money to lose. nothing\n\n(See Chapter 5 on pronouns.)\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 5.7\n\nCompile a list of proper nouns – names for specific people, places, organisations, etc. that are normally written with a capital letter.\n\nMake a second list of common nouns – more general terms for people, places, things, etc.\n\nFor example,\n\nHayley teenager Austria country December winter Coronation Street park Abbey National bank\n\nCan you add ‘–s’ to form a plural? (form)\n\nCan you insert determiners like ‘a’, ‘an’, ‘the’ before the word? (function)\n\nShow Commentary\n\nProper nouns differ from common nouns in form, as they do not normally take a plural form:\n\n* Austrias countries * Decembers winters\n\nProper nouns differ in function from common nouns, as they do not usually follow determiners:\n\n* the Hayley a teenager * the Coronation Street the park\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 5.8\n\nClassify these nouns as mass or count nouns.\n\nWhich nouns can take a plural form – the addition of ‘–s’ suffix? (form)\n\nmoney, cash, wage, coin, loaf, bread, fish, hair\n\nShow Commentary\n\nMass nouns Count nouns money wage(s) cash coin(s) bread loaf (loaves) fish (category of creature) fish(es) (individual examples) hair (on head) hair(s) (in soup, or on chin)\n\nThe words ‘money’ and ‘cash’ function as mass nouns, as they do not take a plural form. Words such as ‘fish’ and ‘hair’ can function as either mass or count nouns, depending on the context. Although ‘hair’ is regarded as a mass noun in English, some languages refer to hair on the head in the plural: ‘I’ve got brown hairs’.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 5.9\n\nUse the meaning definition to identify the abstract and concrete nouns in the following.\n\nLord, make me an instrument of your peace.\n\nWhere there is hatred… let me sew love.\n\nWhere there is injury… pardon.\n\nWhere there is discord… unity.\n\nWhere there is doubt… faith.\n\nWhere there is error… truth.\n\nWhere there is despair… hope.\n\nWhere there is sadness… joy.\n\nWhere there is darkness… light.\n\n(Peace prayer, attributed to St Francis)\n\nShow Commentary\n\nNearly all the nouns in this prayer are abstract: ‘peace’, ‘love’, ‘truth’, etc. Some nouns are concrete, as they are entities that can be perceived by the senses: ‘instrument’, ‘darkness’, ‘light’. However, we may feel that these nouns are being used metaphorically and are thus also abstract.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 5.10\n\nUnderline the verbs in the first and the changes to nouns in the second.\n\nHow does this affect the tone and style?\n\nExtract 1\n\nYou must observe the school rules. Make sure you behave and choose suitable clothes to wear so that the school day runs smoothly. We hope that you will achieve good exam results to benefit us all. We will exclude anyone who departs from these standards.\n\nExtract 2\n\nThe observation of the school’s code of conduct is a requirement for all pupils. The maintenance of orderly behaviour and the choice of appropriate clothing is essential to the smooth running of the school day. It is our hope that the achievement of academic success will be of benefit to all members of the school community. Any departure from our standards will result in exclusion.\n\nShow Commentary\n\nNearly all the nouns in this prayer are abstract: ‘peace’, ‘love’, ‘truth’, etc. Some nouns are concrete, as they are entities that can be perceived by the senses: ‘instrument’, ‘darkness’, ‘light’. However, we may feel that these nouns are being used metaphorically and are thus also abstract.\n\nExtract 1\n\nYou must observe the school rules.

The maintenance of orderly behaviour and the choice of appropriate clothing is essential to the smooth running of the school day. It is our hope that the achievement of academic success will be of benefit to all members of the school community.

But anyway choice isn't an end in itself. It is one important mechanism to ensure that citizens can indeed secure good schools and health services in their communities. And choice matters as much within those institutions as between them: better choice of learning options for each pupil within secondary schools; better choice of access routes into the health service. Choice puts the levers in the hands of parents and patients so that they as citizens and consumers can be a driving force for improvement in their public services. And the choice we support is choice open to all on the basis of their equal status as citizens not on the unequal basis of their wealth.\n\n(Speech on public services, 23 June 2004)\n\nShow Commentary\n\nBlair uses the nominalisation ‘choice’, rather than the verb ‘choose’. For example,\n\nthe choice we support is choice open to all.\n\nIn this way, he does not commit himself to a precise statement about who can choose, or exactly what or when they can choose something. This can be changed to a verb:\n\nAll people can choose their schools and health service.\n\nHowever, it is not actually true that all people can choose the school or health service they want. ne.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 5.12\n\nRead this extract from a speech made by President George Bush to the American people after the events of 11 September 2001.\n\nIdentify the progression from abstract nouns to concrete nouns.\n\nComment on the effects.\n\nGreat harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in our grief and anger we have found our mission and our moment. Freedom and fear are at war. The advance of human freedom - the great achievement of our time, and the great hope of every time - now depends on us. Our nation - this generation - will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future. We will rally the world to this cause by our efforts, by our courage. We will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail.\n\n(Applause.)\n\nIt is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return almost to normal. We'll go back to our lives and routines, and that is good. Even grief recedes with time and grace. But our resolve must not pass. Each of us will remember what happened that day, and to whom it happened. We'll remember the moment the news came - where we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an image of a fire, or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever.\n\nAnd I will carry this: It is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. This is my reminder of lives that ended, and a task that does not end.\n\n(Address to the Joint Session of Congress, 20 September 2001)\n\nShow Commentary\n\nAt the beginning, abstract nouns are used: ‘harm’, ‘loss’, ‘grief’, ‘freedom’, ‘fear’, ‘war’, ‘hope’, etc. The negative abstractions mount up, but are set against the positive words ‘freedom’ and ‘hope’.\n\nBush develops the idea of hope, with other abstract nouns such as ‘lives’, ‘routines’, ‘resolve’, before introducing the first concrete nouns: ‘moment’ and ‘fire’. This general reference to the event is then made more personal by the nouns, ‘face’ and ‘voice’. He immediately makes this specific to an individual person in the concrete nouns ‘shield’, ‘man’, ‘mom’, ‘son’.\n\nThe example of one person’s death is then represented in abstract terms as a ‘memorial’, ‘reminder’, and finally a ‘task’. The nature of the task has already been formulated in the contrasting words: ‘freedom’ and ‘war’.\n\nThe identification of word classes should, of course, be developed by exploration of semantics – the figurative and emotive associations of words.

On this occasion I am going to have to side with the BBC.\n\nShow Commentary\n\nThis extract expresses the writer’s personal viewpoint, using the first person throughout. This becomes too subjective with the use of verbs such as ‘believe’ and ‘feel’.

Sickert was living in London in 1884 and engaged to be married. He was an apprentice to Whistler and knew the East End rag shops in the slums of Shoreditch and Petticoat Lane and would etch them in 1887. Sickert went where the master went. They wandered together. Sometimes Sickert wandered about the squalor on his own. The ‘Elephant Man’ was just the sort of cruel, degrading exhibition that Sickert would have found amusing, and perhaps for an instant, Merrick and Sickert were eye to eye.

It is possible to combine about seven elements into a grammatical clause structure.\n\nNB Pupils may find enterprising ways of combining a larger number, perhaps using a phrase, such as ‘irresistible’ or ‘on the porch’ as part of an expanded noun phrase, or adding the phrase ‘most peculiar indeed’ as an afterthought.

Widow Twankey tripped up.\n\nA clause is a group of words distinct from a phrase: it must contain a verb, or verb phrase, conveying what happened. This essential element occurs in the second position in English structure. In the most simple clause structure, the verb has a subject before it, referring to who or what did this.

Widow Twankey tripped up. morosely.\n\nThe third card can be either a prepositional or adverbial phrase in form. The function of these phrases is adverbial, as it provides information about the verb: where, when or how it happened.\n\nNB Some grammar books use the term ‘adjunct’, rather than ‘adverbial’, for the function of this element.\n\nThe adverbial phrase can be moved to other positions in the structure, for a change in emphasis:\n\nBefore breakfast the politician dozed.\n\nThe politician morosely dozed.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 9.5\n\nUse one of the verbs ‘skinned’ or ‘had abandoned’.\n\nChoose a subject.

It is necessary to add another noun phrase as the object. These phrases could also be used in the subject position, but this alters the meaning completely. It is not a stylistic variation like the position of adverbial phrases.\n\nWidow Twankey/had abandoned/the politician.\n\nOther verbs can be used in transitive, as well as intransitive, structures: ‘tripped up’, ‘wanted to hide’\n\nWidow Twankey/wanted to hide/an ageing beetle.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 9.6\n\nUse the verb ‘was’ to form a clause structure with three elements.\n\nWrite an equals sign ‘=’ on the back of the card.\n\nDiscard all the prepositional phrases – you have already seen that these function as adverbials.\n\nChoose a subject.\n\nAdd a third card - NOT a prepositional phrase.\n\nWrite the clause down as Example 4.\n\nWhat other cards can be used in this third position?

(Prepositional and adverbial phrases function as adverbials.)\n\nBecause the verb ‘to be’ expresses a state, rather than an action, the third element does not function as an object. The equals sign indicates the relationship between the verb and the following element. It is called a Complement, as it does not refer to another person or thing, but adds extra information about the subject.\n\nIt is often possible to reverse the order of the subject and complement without altering the meaning.

This position also contributes to effects of rhythm and rhyme.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 9.12\n\nIdentify the verbs and any conjunctions in the following extract.\n\nReplace commas with full stops to separate complete clauses.\n\nAfter a cup of tea and a biscuit I got to work, I started to see if they had forced their way in. The room was very stuffy, so I thought I would open the window, the view was of the back garden leading into woods. On my travels to the back of the house I bumped into Mrs Hinton she stopped to talk, on the other hand I could ask her a few questions, so here we are talking away.\n\nShow Commentary\n\nThis writer uses the conjunctions ‘so’ and ‘if’ to join some clauses into more complex sentences. The verbs are underlined to indicate each clause:\n\nI started to see if they had forced their way in.\n\nThe room was very stuffy, so I thought [that] I would open the window.\n\nOn the other hand I could ask her a few questions, so here we are talking away.\n\nAfter a cup of tea and a biscuit I got to work.\n\nThe view was of the back garden leading into woods.\n\nOn my travels to the back of the house I bumped into Mrs Hinton.\n\nShe stopped to talk.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 9.13\n\nNote the simple, one-clause sentences used in this account.\n\nAt last, after what seemed a long time - it might have been five seconds, I dare say - he sagged flabbily to his knees. His mouth slobbered. An enormous senility seemed to have settled upon him. One could have imagined him thousands of years old. I fired again into the same spot. At the second shot he did not collapse but climbed with desperate slowness to his feet and stood weakly upright, with legs sagging and head drooping. I fired a third time. That was the shot that did for him. You could see the agony of it jolt his whole body and knock the last remnant of strength from his legs. But in falling he seemed for a moment to rise, for as his hind legs collapsed beneath him he seemed to tower upwards like a huge rock toppling, his trunk reaching skywards like a tree. He trumpeted, for the first and only time. And then down he came, his belly towards me, with a crash that seemed to shake the ground even where I lay.\n\nI got up. The Burmans were already racing past me across the mud. It was obvious that the elephant would never rise again, but he was not dead. He was breathing very rhythmically with long rattling gasps, his great mound of a side painfully raising and falling. His mouth was wide open - I could see far down into caverns of pale pink throat. I waited a long time for him to die, but his breathing did not weaken. Finally I fired my last two shots into the spot where I thought his heart must be. The thick blood welled out of him like red velvet, but still he did not die. His body did not even jerk when the shots hit him, the tortured breathing continued without a pause. He was dying, very slowly and in great agony, but in some world remote from me where not even a bullet could damage him further.\n\n(George Orwell, Shooting an Elephant\n\nShow Commentary\n\nThe following sentences are simple in structure, with one clause. The verbs are underlined.\n\nHis mouth slobbered.\n\nAn enormous senility seemed to have settled upon him.\n\nOne could have imagined him thousands of years old.\n\nI fired again into the same spot.\n\nI fired a third time.\n\nHe trumpeted, for the first and only time.\n\nI got up.\n\nThe Burmans were already racing past me across the mud.\n\nHis mouth was wide open –\n\nI could see far down into caverns of pale pink throat.\n\nIn this sentence, Orwell uses a ‘comma splice’, even though these are two complete main clauses!\n\nHis body did not even jerk when the shots hit him, the tortured breathing continued without a pause.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nChapter 10\n\nActivity 10.1\n\nWhat sentence types are used in the following text?\n\nWhat does this reveal about the purposes of the text?\n\nWhat revisions could be made to improve this text?\n\nBULLIED? STOP IT!\n\nI was once bullied. Horrible, isn't it? I was once punched regularly. Horrible isn't it? I was once made to feel scared and alone. Horrible isn't it? I once told my teacher - it stopped. Wouldn't that be great?\n\nBullies are cowards. They pick on you because they're jealous. They pick on you because they don't think you'll snitch.\n\nYou can do something about it. You can stop them bullying you. You must tell your teacher. Or you can let them continue making your life hell. What will you do?\n\nWhat can I do to stop them?\n\nFirstly you must tell a teacher. They are trained to deal with bullies and despite what you may have heard, teachers do care.\n\nSecondly you must try and avoid being alone around the bullies. Cowards never pick on people if they are in groups.\n\n(student work)\n\nShow Commentary\n\nThis extract is from a pupil’s leaflet giving advice on bullying. The series of repeated interrogatives at the beginning could be effective, but the impact is weakened by using too many in a short text. It is not necessary to introduce the advice with two similar questions: ‘What will you do?’ ‘What can I do to stop them?’ The two bullet points signal two steps of advice, so it is not necessary to introduce them with ‘Firstly’ and ‘Secondly’. It might be clearer to express the imperatives simply: ‘Tell a teacher’, rather than ‘You must tell a teacher’.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 10.2\n\nIdentify the verbs in each sentence.\n\nWhich sentences are simple – one clause – structures?\n\nThe boy leaps out into the road.\n\nThere’s a blare of horns, a screaming of tongues and tyres.\n\nBut the cat with no name feels safe in the boy’s jacket.\n\n‘Ahhhh’ the boy called Shane yells as he dives through.\n\nThey won’t follow him here.\n\n(Libby Hathorn, Way Home)\n\nShow Commentary\n\nThe following sentences are simple, with one main verb:\n\nThe boy leaps out into the road.\n\nThere’s a blare of horns, a screaming of tongues and tyres.\n\nBut the cat with no name feels safe in the boy’s jacket.\n\nThey won’t follow him here.\n\nOne sentence is more complex, with three verbs indicating three clauses.\n\n‘Ahhhh’ the boy called Shane yells as he dives through.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 10.3\n\nReverse the order of the two clauses in the following sentences.\n\nWhat happens to the position of the conjunction (underlined)?\n\nIt is a sunny day and everyone is in the park.\n\nI want to play football but there’s a maths test tomorrow.\n\nWe can go shopping to Meadowhall or we can watch a video.\n\nI didn’t like the film so I left early.\n\nI left early because I didn’t like the film.\n\nShow Commentary\n\nThe co-ordinating conjunctions remain in a linking position between the two clauses.\n\nEveryone is in the park and it is a sunny day.\n\nThere’s a maths test tomorrow but I want to play football.\n\nWe can watch a video or we can go shopping to Meadowhall.\n\nThe conjunction ‘so’ is slightly different, as it expresses a relationship of cause and effect. Although it always operates in a linking position, the meaning is changed if the clauses are transposed.\n\n? I left early so I didn’t like the film.\n\nThe clause it introduces cannot be moved to the beginning of the sentence:\n\n* So I left early, I didn’t like the film.\n\nThis shows that the word ‘so’ is not a subordinating conjunction. It has a linking function and is always placed between two clauses.\n\nThis test demonstrates the different way that subordinating conjunctions operate. Conjunctions such as ‘because’, are bound to the clause they introduce, so they move when the clauses are transposed.\n\nBecause I didn’t like the film, I left early.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 10.4\n\nRemove the conjunctions from the following sentence.\n\nDoes each clause make grammatical sense?\n\nWhat do you need to insert in place of the conjunctions?\n\nDavid's going to Barcelona, but he's only going for 10 days and we're going for two weeks and I've got my own room with a TV and everything.\n\nShow Commentary\n\nEach clause can stand alone, making full grammatical sense. Full stops are needed to separate the simple sentences.\n\nDavid’s going to Barcelona. He’s only going for ten days. We’re going for two weeks. I’ve got my own room with a TV and everything.\n\nNB The conjunction ‘and’ is also used to link two nouns in a list: ‘a TV and everything’.\n\nThe term finite verb is used to indicate that the form of the verb makes complete grammatical sense. These are distinguished from non-finite verb forms – the present and past participles used to introduce subordinate clauses.\n\nFinite verb form Non-finite verb form I’ve got my own room. Having my own room, I... David’s going to Barcelona. Having gone to Barcelona, David...\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 10.5\n\nIdentify the use of simple co-ordinating connectives in the following extracts.\n\nWhat does this suggest about the fictional characters in each?\n\nExtract 1\n\nNow you’d think, and I’d think, and everybody with a bit of imagination would think, that we’d done as clean a job as could ever be done, that with the baker’s shop being at least a mile from where we lived, and with not a soul having seen us, and what with the fog and the fact that we weren’t more than five minutes in the place, that the coppers should never have been able to trace us. But then, you’d be wrong, I’d be wrong and everybody else would be wrong, no matter how much imagination was diced out between us.\n\n((Alan Sillitoe, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner)\n\nExtract 2\n\nSuddenly Lok understood that the man was holding the stick out to him but neither he nor Lok could reach across the river… The stick began to grow shorter at both ends. Then it shot to full length again.\n\nThe dead tree by Lok’s ear acquired a voice.\n\n“Clop!”\n\nHis ears twitched and he turned to the tree. By his face there had grown a twig: a twig that smelt of other, and of goose, and of the bitter berries that Lok’s stomach told him he must not eat..\n\n((Alan Sillitoe, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner)\n\nShow Commentary\n\nCommentary 10.5\n\nThe repeated use of the simple conjunctions ‘and’, ‘but’ and the connective ‘then’ is a deliberate stylistic device to create a convincing voice for the young narrator in the first extract. In the second passage, it represents the Stone-Age character’s perceptions.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 10.6\n\nTranspose the order of clauses in the following sentences.\n\nWhat happens to the position of the conjunctions (underlined)?\n\nEveryone is in the park and the sun is shining.\n\nEveryone is in the park, because the sun is shining.\n\nI want to play football, but there is a maths test tomorrow.\n\nI want to play football, unless there is a maths test tomorrow.\n\nWe can go shopping, or we can watch a video.\n\nWe can go shopping, unless you prefer to watch a video.\n\nShow Commentary\n\nIn each pair of examples, the two clauses can be transposed, but the conjunctions do not operate in the same way. Co-ordinating conjunctions function independently rather like links in a chain – they are always inserted between two main clauses.\n\nWe can watch a video or we can go shopping.\n\nSubordinating conjunctions are bound to the clause they introduce. If the clause is moved to another position in the structure, the conjunction moves with it.\n\nUnless you prefer to watch a video, we can go shopping.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 10.7\n\nIdentify the subordinate clauses in the following sentences.\n\nWhich clause can be deleted, leaving a complete simple sentence?\n\nBecause it is a sunny day, everyone is in the park.\n\nEven though it’s a sunny day, no one is in the park.\n\nIt was a sunny day, when everyone was in the park.\n\nI want to play football, unless there’s a maths test tomorrow.\n\nAlthough I want to play football, there’s a maths test tomorrow.\n\nWhenever I want to play football, there’s a maths test the next day.\n\nWe can go shopping to Meadowhall, unless we watch a video instead.\n\nIf we go shopping to Meadowhall, we can watch a video later.\n\nAfter we go shopping to Meadowhall, we can watch a video later\n\nShow Commentary\n\nThese clauses can be deleted, leaving a complete grammatical structure:\n\n[Because it is a sunny day,] everyone is in the park.\n\n[Even though it’s a sunny day,] no one is in the park.\n\nIt was a sunny day, [when everyone was in the park.]\n\nI want to play football, [unless there’s a maths test tomorrow.]\n\n[Although I want to play football,] there’s a maths test tomorrow.\n\n[Whenever I want to play football,] there’s a maths test the next day.\n\nWe can go shopping to Meadowhall, [unless we watch a video instead.\n\n] [If we go shopping to Meadowhall,] we can watch a video later.\n\n[After we go shopping to Meadowhall,] we can watch a video later.\n\nHide Commentary\n\nActivity 10.8\n\nIdentify the subordinate clauses in the following examples from romantic fiction.\n\nUnderline the non-finite verb forms.\n\nWhich clause can be deleted leaving a complete grammatical sentence?\n\nShe shifted in her seat, eyeing Sarah with interest.\n\nShe waited, holding her breath without realising that she did so.\n\nIn silence she did so, flicking the switch and filling the room with light.\n\nOutside she sat in the car for a moment, resting her head against the cold steering wheel.\n\nAlerted by sudden small gusts of wind, Deirdre Shackleton looked up.\n\nShaken by the directness of words which re-echoed her own recent thoughts, Sarah was embarrassed.\n\nSmiling, Katie nodded.\n\nScratching his head, the elderly locksmith stared at the back of the door.\n\nSquaring her shoulders, she pressed the"
