        "text": "Design Competition\n\nDuring Stage I, approximately 400 preliminary design visions were reviewed by an Architect-Engineer (A-E) Evaluation Board. Entries were evaluated on their originality, appropriateness, feasibility, and compliance with project requirements. The board selected six design visions to compete in Stage II.\n\nStage II design concepts were judged by a Design Jury. Evaluation criteria in this stage included design concept, past performance, specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, and capacity to accomplish the work in the required time. The Design Jury identified the strengths and weaknesses of each concept and provided a rationale for their final ranking to the A-E Board. The board, in turn, reviewed the jury’s recommendations and interviewed the design teams before making a final recommendation to ABMC. St.Florian’s winning design was the unanimous choice throughout the Stage II process.\n\nBill Lacy, president of Purchase College, State University of New York, was the professional advisor for the competition.\n\nMemorial Design\n\nThe National World War II Memorial design recognizes that the site itself pays special tribute to America’s WWII generation. The memorial design creates a special place within the vast openness of the National Mall to commemorate the sacrifice and celebrate the victory of WWII, yet remains respectful and sensitive to its historic surroundings. The vistas from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial and the site’s park-like setting are preserved, and the double row of elm trees that flank the memorial have been restored. Above all, the design creates a powerful sense of place that is distinct, memorable, evocative and serene.\n\nSculptures\n\nInside each victory pavilion is a sculptural canopy called a baldacchino. These baldacchinos are actually four eagles holding a laurel victory wreath suspended above an enlarged victory medallion set into the floor below. The eagle is the symbol of the United States of America. The laurel wreath is a symbol of victory going back to ancient Greece. So, the sculptures symbolize American victory in the Atlantic and in the Pacific theaters. The eagles have wingspans of 11 feet and are perched on columns 18 feet tall. Each of the laurel wreaths weighs 5,000 pounds and was designed by Ray Kaskey of Maryland.\n\nBas-Relief Sculpture Panels\n\nThere are 24 bronze bas relief panels flanking the formal 17th Street entrance to the memorial. Each panel measures two feet tall by five feet long and was designed by Maryland artist Ray Kaskey. Twelve scenes from the homefront and the Pacific Theater are displayed on the south walk and twelve scenes from the homefront and the European Theater are along the northern walk. Descriptions and explanations of the sculptures are available as handouts at the World War II Memorial visitor contact station located along Home Front Drive.\n\nA series of bas-relief sculpture panels created by sculptor Ray Kaskey is set into the balustrades of the north and south ceremonial entrance walls. The bas-reliefs consist of 24 separate panels. The 12 on the north depict the Atlantic front; the 12 on the south depict the Pacific front.\n\nThe unifying theme of the panels is the transformation of America caused by the country’s total immersion in World War II. The panels depict the all-out mobilization of America’s agricultural, industrial, military, and human resources that transformed the country into the arsenal of democracy as well as the breadbasket of the world.\n\nThe visual inspiration for these panels is the bas-relief sculptures that encircle the Pension Building in Washington, D.C., which were influenced by the bas-reliefs on the Parthenon. What these bas-reliefs have in common is that all are isocephalic, a Greek word meaning that the heads of the principal figures line up horizontally. The human scale is the visual unifying element common to all 24 panels; all details, scenes, equipment, etc. are subordinated to the scale of the figure. The unity of purpose unique to this time in America is best evoked by placing the visual emphasis on the individual in this time-honored manner. Most of the panels are based on historical photos.\n\n“Kilroy Was Here”\n\nKilroy Was Here\n\nThe enormously popular “Kilroy Was Here” graffiti of the Second World War, likely originated with James J. Kilroy, a ship inspector at the Fore River shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, who would sign his completed work with his famous cartoon signature.\n\n“Kilroy Was Here”, accompanied by a cartoon drawing of a man looking over a wall, was a popular form of graffiti drawn by American troops in the Atlantic theater and then later in the Pacific theater. It came to be a universal sign that American soldiers had come through an area and left their mark. Its origins most likely come from a British cartoon and the name of an American shipyard inspector. The myths surrounding it are numerous and often center on a German belief that Kilroy was some kind of superspy who could go anywhere he pleased. There are two Kilroys hidden in the Memorial. You have to find them yourself!"
