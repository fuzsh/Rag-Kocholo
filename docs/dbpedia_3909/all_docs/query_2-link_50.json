        "text": "Judging by the wikipedia article suggested by Lawrence, doing a barrel roll seems to mean that you should \"do something different\" and \"change your perspective,\" setting the problem aside for while and doing something unrelated to it before coming back to it. This is common advice if you are having a mental block.\n\nHowever, my interpretation does not quite agree with the origins of the phrase in a Nintendo 64 game, as found by FumbleFingers in the Urban Dictionary. There the phrase is described as being used as a panacea for all problems - perhaps the equivalent of the IT fix-all \"Have you tried turning it off and back on again\"."
