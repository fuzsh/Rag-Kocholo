        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nInternet memes (hereafter, just “memes’’) are a social form of communication used by individuals as part of group knowledge transfer. Meme “templates’’, such as key images or phrases, are used to communicate information and understanding using a known meaning or structure. Contextual content is then added to the template to express relevant ideas and information. The meme template's meaning or structure situates the content that individuals add, acting as a frame of reference. These frames, and the ability to understand them, allows for personal and oftentimes complex knowledge transfer and experience sharing.\n\nCountless memes exist in the digital era, and new memetic templates are formed at rapid rates. Despite the novelty of new meme templates, general audiences are often able to quickly adopt an understanding of the meaning a template conveys, which contributes to a meme's proliferation through engagement such as sharing. This understanding allows individuals to interpret meaning surrounding the content added to the template across contexts. The phenomenon of being able to evoke content understanding through template clues highlights the educational potential for memes.\n\nThis paper details findings from a qualitative interview study exploring student reasoning about memes, and how that reasoning may be applied to computer science educational contexts. We are interested in the following research questions with this work:\n\nRQ1: How do students reason through intended meaning when presented with memes?\n\nRQ2: Are students able to reason about computer science concepts, even ones they may be unfamiliar with, when presented with contextual memes?\n\nRQ3: Does reasoning with memes connect with students in a way they find valuable and/or engaging?\n\nRQ4: What evidence might exist to support memes as a valuable tool for communicating about computer science concepts in educational contexts?\n\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW\n\nMemes consist of a common template whose “rules’’ and meaning are decided by some group, often through repeated usage which reinforces these norms. While the group “owns’’ the usage norms, individuals create content using these norms to share individualized forms of expression with the group [29].\n\nBeing able to engage in individual-with-group dynamics - such as the creation, consumption, and sharing of memes - can contribute to a sense of belonging to a group. As individuals become familiar with the “customs” of a particular meme, they become part of a shared discourse community [35], which can allow them to engage and connect with others in new ways. Developing a sense of belonging can increase programming student retention, as well as perceptions of ability [38]. This suggests that contexts and tools which can foster a sense of belonging may play an important role in student persistence and success.\n\nHumans have leveraged memes long before the Internet, from specific examples such as “Kilroy was here” graffiti in World War II [5] to phrases and gestures from news and popular culture. Memes are a part of everyday communication [19], and are largely used to convey something about their creator's emotions in a way that will be understood by others [28]. Memes encourage both the creator to express, and the viewer to share in that expression, often attempting to elicit an emotional reaction or emotional connection such as shock, commiseration, or laughter [2, 20].\n\nIn education, emotional reactions can be strong motivators and learning triggers [36, 40], which highlights further the potential value of memes as a pedagogical tool. Kirk [21] notes that “the primary content that we engage with is actually content we generate in relationship with the work”. The emotional and social components of memes highlight their value as communication tools, and also exemplify how they may “provide a more approachable, creative, and fun experience for those involved.” [32].\n\nSharma [32] notes that learning occurs through both the “cognitive’’ and “experiential’’ modes, where experiential “relies upon imagery, emotions, and metaphors evoked through narratives’’ [32]. Sharma's paper showcases prior efforts to apply memes to education, and suggests that image and video memes can be a method of incorporating experiential modes much the same way that case studies or stories might be leveraged in the classroom.\n\nThe use of memes in particular follows a format - that is, memes “work’’ by considering both the meaning of the template frame and the content applied to that frame. These frames suggest analogical reasoning is critical in understanding memes, as viewers analogically encode examples when first seeing a meme in order to discern a schema (“template structure’’) based on core generalizations [15]. The way in which meme formats develop a schema of structured relationships and entities evokes Gentner's structure mapping theory of analogy [14].\n\nWork on the use of analogy as a tool in learning, which requires analogical reasoning, has been conducted in computing education contexts. Most of the work presented as analogy work focuses on verbal or written analogy [4, 8, 9, 12, 13, 17, 18, 31]. While a majority of analogy work in computing education has centered on verbal and text analogies, there is a body of research exploring other forms of analogy, such as physical representations, or visualizations and imagery [3, 16, 33, 34, 37, 39]. Alternative analogical forms often still carry text or verbal analogy components with their usage, such as being incorporated into the representation itself or for explanation, instructions, and communication. The common correlation of text and verbal to alternative forms of analogy may contribute to research largely focusing on text and verbal forms when discussing analogy.\n\nProvided that analogical reasoning has been explored in computing classrooms as evidenced from the citations above, there is evidence to support the exploration of a novel structure-based analogical reasoning method for possible value to the computing classroom. Even more specifically however, structure mapping theory [14, 15] has seen work in analogical reasoning within computing education build upon it [3, 9, 17]. If template-based reasoning does occur as suggested when interpreting memes, then there is theoretical alignment with some existing work in computing education. Outside of computer science education, there exists evidence for the value of memes as a pedagogical tool [32], as a communication and community tool [2, 20, 28, 29], and as a general qualitative method worthy of further exploration [19].\n\nWhile there is a novel gap in computing education's exploration of memes, work within this gap is supported by the field having conducted prior efforts in examining analogy and analogical reasoning phenomena in various forms. This support is coupled with evidence of meme exploration from outside disciplines motivating questions of possible value that may be found within computing education research from the use of memes. Viable qualitative methods, as well as potential communication, community, and pedagogical benefits are all of potential value to computing education research. Beyond our discipline, memes have been examined through these frames, further suggesting examination of memes may be worthwhile within our context.\n\n3 INTERVIEW STUDY DESIGN\n\nAn interview study was conducted to explore participant reasoning when viewing memes. The interview study was designated as exempt by the university research ethics office. Participants were undergraduate students who were recruited via word of mouth and advertisement across campus. Recruitment efforts were officially posted in the CS1, CS2, Concurrent Computing, and Engineering Fundamentals courses, as well as the Biomedical Engineering Club.\n\nParticipants scheduled a one-hour time block to take part in a semi-structured, guided interview. During this interview they were first provided a consent form for both audio recording and the review of their responses for research. They were encouraged to share any questions they had.\n\nThe interview process was guided but semi-structured [1, 11], with additional questions being raised when relevant, such as clarifying or summarizing questions. This is in line with dialectic study forms as seen in Lave et al. [22], allowing for gap-closing with regard to interviewer understanding of participant responses. Further, it allowed the interview process to feel less “formal’’ and for participants to share more openly as the format was conversational.\n\n# Template Name Description NonProgramming Example Programming Example 1 Is This a Pigeon?[25] A drawn animation male character (named Yutaro Katori) from “The Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird” (light skinned with black hair, wearing glasses and a yellow t-shirt and collared red shirt under a light blue blazer) who is holding a textbook (the title is written in Japanese) stands outside of a building and gestures toward a yellow butterfly while with the text “Is this a pigeon?” beneath. The male character is labelled with “me” and gestures towards the butterfly with text overlaid labeling “refreshing twitter every two minutes for an hour”, with “Is this working on my book” beneath. The male character is labeled with text as “programmer” and gestures towards the butterfly with text overlaid labeling “if statement,’’ with “Is this AI?” beneath. 2 It's Free Real Estate[24] A closeup still from a “Tim & Eric” sketch of a man's face (white, light brown slicked-back hair) focused on his eyes with a pursed smile, looking slightly mischievous. His dialogue, “It's Free Real Estate” is captioned at the bottom of the image. Above the template is text that reads “Me: *leaving empty box on the floor*”. Followed by the text “My cat:”, and beneath is the meme template image, suggesting the image represents the cat in this scenario. Above the template is an image of a RAM stick with text above that image reading “RAM: *exists*”. Following is the text “JVM:” (Java Virtual Machine). Below that is the meme template image, with images of the Java programming language logo over each of his eyes, indicating the image represents Java in this scenario. 4 Does He Bite?[26] A four panel “Cyanide and Happiness” comic shows two drawn stick figure men (both with light skin and bald) speaking, one of which has a large dog. The man without a dog (green shirt) asks “does he bite?” to which the other (blue shirt) replies “no, but he can hurt you in other ways”. The third panel is left blank with a line extending from the dog for speech. The fourth panel shows the first man crying and turning away. The dog's speech bubble in the third panel says “PS4 Pro can't play games in 4K.” Everything else is the same as the blank template. The dog's speech bubble in the third panel says “Array indexing starts at 1.” Everything else is the same as the blank template. 6 Gru's Plan[27] A four panel sequence showing the 3D animated character Gru from the film “Despicable Me” (a light skinned, bald man with broad shoulders and a strong nose) standing next to a large standing notepad which is left blank. In the first three panels, Gru is not looking at the board, while doing various gestures that suggest confidently explaining what is on the board. In the fourth panel, Gru looks back at the board with a crestfallen expression. On the notepad behind Gru, the first panel indicates “Have a 4 day long holiday” with the second panel indicating “plan to study every single day”. The third and fourth panel instead indicate on the notepad “stay every day watching TV”. The first panel notepad indicates “We find the bug”, and the second panel indicates “We fix the bug”. The third panel says “Now we have two bugs”, and the fourth panel says “Now we have three bugs”.\n\nIn total eight meme templates were used for the study. In the interest of space and for a more targeted analysis, this paper segments our analysis and examines four of these templates, detailed in Table 1 . While the details and template image can be found at each linked citation, we have also compiled a shared folder with each image used in this study [10].\n\nAs our analysis is “segmented” (half of the main study templates are presented here), it is important to note that the choice of which memes were selected for this paper was done prior to major analysis. Only meme one was completed prior to segmentation choice, as a means to develop and validate an initial codebook (detailed in the Analysis section), and this selection was purely based on numeric order. The choice thereafter of which additional three memes would appear in the first “segment” of analysis was a team choice based on which memes the research team found most interesting and/or efficient in terms of work hours to explore first. This selection of the study data's segmentation before analysis means that the results of the analysis did not factor into our presentation of results here.\n\nEach meme template was shown a total of three times, representing three “categories’’ for interviewees. A synthetic memetic image (the “Curious Squirrel”) is presented here to better illustrate the categories and their content.\n\nBlank: (Figure 1) A template, no text or content added.\n\nNon-Programming: (Figure 2) Content unrelated to computing and programming has been added.\n\nProgramming: (Figure 3) Content related to computing and programming has been added.\n\nMemes were presented by category first, then by template with the order referenced by number value in table 1. Potential for ordering effect of templates was recognized, but ultimately considered to be unlikely given time between elements. Ordering effect for categories was included as part of the study design. Presenting Blank templates first allowed for a baseline understanding of familiarity with the meme and reasoning about its usage. Non-programming was then shown to explore how participants may reason about the template once content is added. Finally, programming memes allowed for an examination of how or if that reasoning process would extend to being applied to computing concepts. Four additional “remixed’’ memes, which presented derivations of template formats, were presented after the main study design was completed for additional consideration by participants as well. While part of the study design, these results are not considered in the scope of this paper or the “main” eight templates.\n\nThe following questions guided the semi-structured interview design. Given the dialectic approach, some questions were naturally answered by participants in their discussion without prompting, and prompting was somewhat shortened as participants became accustomed to the interview procedures and expectations.\n\n(Blanks Only) Have you seen this meme template before? (No, Yes, I don't know)\n\nDo you have familiarity with any content in this meme, such as characters, text, or symbols that are shown? If so, describe what you recognize and how you recognize it.\n\nWhat context do you think this image creates? What situation would you imagine someone using this image in?\n\n(If text is present) Does the text that is present modify the image and your understanding of it in any way? If so, how?\n\n(Non-Blanks Only) Please describe the situation you think this meme is trying to convey. Who or what is this meme about? Who is it intended for? How are the images and text combining to create that understanding?\n\nA pre-interview and post-interview survey were conducted verbally with participants. The results of the pre-interview survey are explored in the “Overview of Participants’’ section of “Data Collection’’. While the post-interview is part of the study design, it is not explored in the scope of this paper.\n\n4 DATA COLLECTION\n\nData was collected in Spring of 2020. One pilot interview was run in order to test timing and flow of the interview process, followed by thirty recruited participants. Eleven interviews were conducted in-person on campus, with the remainder online. The first five in-person interviews had note taking methods which differed from the approach used for the other twenty-five, due to late adoption of a more effective note taking method. As a result, these five participants were removed from the data analysis within this paper for methodological consistency.\n\nThis study was originally designed for on-campus interviews to be conducted with physical consent forms and signatures. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic caused campus closures, the study was moved to remote via Google Hangouts calls. Participants were sent a calendar invite which included a PDF version of the consent form to review, and a link to a Google Forms version of the consent form to provide their digital signature. An amendment to the exempt study design was filed with and acknowledged by the research board office. No other aspect of the study required a change in transitioning to remote.\n\nThroughout each interview, the interviewer noted timestamps for later review. This qualitative data collection approach was chosen based on Brown's research design [7]. Brown noted that having investigators and/or participants note events of interest allowed “selection before selection”, reducing bias by indicating interesting phenomena prior to any investigation. All interviews were approximately an hour.\n\nAfter all interviews were completed, each noted timestamp was transcribed for analysis. Some timestamps were collapsed together during transcription due to ongoing dialogue connecting them. Of the 25 analyzed participants, 1,169 entries in total were transcribed for analysis. The number of entries for the memes analyzed in this paper are presented in Table 2.\n\nMeme Transcribed Entries Is This A Pigeon? 115 It's Free Real Estate 114 Does He Bite? 120 Gru's Plan 107\n\n4.1 Study Context\n\nThis research was conducted at a public university within the midwestern United States in the upper peninsula of Michigan, which is largely rural. The university is STEM-focused with a majority white and majority male student body. Enrollment metrics from 2020 for Bachelor's degrees at this institution indicate 87.3% white and 71.5% male. Approximately 12% of the university's enrollment is in computing-related majors, which have figures that correspond to overall enrollment trends across the university.\n\n4.2 Participant Overview\n\nThe pre-interview gathered information on participant gender identity (Table 3), university major (Table 4), year in university (Table 5), and age. Participants were also asked to name three things they would describe as “memes’’ as a rapport and grounding question, which is not included in this analysis.\n\nGender Identity Man 11 Woman 14 Nonbinary, Not Specified, or Other 0 Age Mean 19.96 Mode 18 Highest 24 Programmed Prior Yes 22 No 3\n\nComputer Science 9 Software Engineering 4 Computer Engineering 2 Electrical & Computer Engineering 2 Mechanical Engineering 2 Biomedical Engineering 2 Cybersecurity 1 Environmental Engineering 1 Economics & Finance 1 Business Analytics 1\n\n1st Year 2nd Year 3rd Year 4th Year N/A 13 0 4 7 1\n\nParticipants were also asked if they had programmed before (Yes/No), which is aggregated with gender identity and age in Table 3. If yes, they were asked what language they felt most confident with (Table 6 ).\n\nJava C# C N/A Java/Python Python Matlab Basic 12 4 3 2 1 1 1 1(*)\n\nParticipants also responded to the following Likert Scale questions based on the text prompts shown, with the numeric value recorded by interviewer based on selection, with responses shown in Table 7:\n\n“How frequently do you see or interact with memes?” (Never (1), Rarely (2), Sometimes (3), Often (4), Almost Always (5))\n\n“How would you rate your understanding of memes you've seen?’’ (None At All (1), A Few Have Made Sense (2), About Half Make Sense (3), Many make Sense (4), Almost All of Them (5))\n\n(If ‘Yes’ to Programming, after most confident language, ‘0’ recorded if ‘No’) “And what skill level would you describe yourself as with that language?’’ (Exposed (A few days or hours of practice) (1), Beginner (A few weeks) (2), Developing (A few Months) (3), Advanced (About a year) (4), Expert (A year plus) (5))\n\nFamiliarity With Memes Mean 4.38 Mode 5 Lowest 2 Understanding of Memes Mean 4.14 Mode 5 Lowest 2 Programming Experience Mean 3.82 Mode 5 Lowest 0\n\n5 ANALYSIS\n\nThe size and richness of this data set, even with Brown's reduction, clearly suggests the limits placed on the scope of analysis for this paper. Initially, Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis [6] was used in an attempt to identify topics. This thematic analysis laid the groundwork for approaching the design of a qualitative codebook [30]. The codebook was aligned with observations from the thematic analysis of prominent topics within the data, as well as allowing further analysis of the research questions. One initial meme was chosen as the development space for crafting the initial codebook, with researchers working together to identify, merge, and agree upon the codes to be included in the codebook. The codebook was then considered in a preliminary glance over one other meme, to validate that the developed codes appeared to be consistently applicable outside of the development grounds. Given the initial thematic analysis across the entire scope of data, this was considered to hold, but the review check provided confirmation to the process.\n\nReferences to specific participants across analysis and results will be indicated by “P#’’, for example Participant 0 would be indicated as “P0”.\n\n5.1 The Qualitative Codebook\n\nThe following codes and their descriptions were developed for the initial qualitative codebook, which was used by all coders. Example quotations from participants that would be identified with this code are also shared.\n\nMS+ (Meme Symbolism Correct): The “meaning’’ of the meme and what it is conveying is inferred by the participant and is largely correct. Example: “so the programmer's kind of like patting himself on the back like “oh well technically an if statement ya know, it has to make its own choice and recognize that so it could be AI’’ when to other people it's like nah dude, it's just an if statement’’ - P29\n\nMS (Meme Symbolism Middling): The “meaning’’ of the meme and what it is conveying is inferred by the participant and gets some aspects correct or is mostly correct, but has significant inaccuracies. The meme is understood or found funny, but difficulty in describing why or the content. Example: “Because of like maybe the commonality of like people being like Oh is that AI? ’cause like that's the like coolest thing that people think about when they think about programming.’’ - P18\n\nMS- (Meme Symbolism Incorrect): The “meaning’’ of the meme and what it is conveying is inferred by the participant and is largely to fully incorrect; or the participant struggles to understand or interpret any meaning from the meme. Example: “Yeah. Like “if it's AI or not’’ um but I guess I don't really understand how it all ties together I don't understand why the if statement's the butterfly um’’ - P26\n\nRA+ (Reality Awareness Correct): Showcases largely correct understanding of the realities of the situation and relationships the meme presents, whether or not personal experience or prior knowledge is present; puts into context understanding of a situation. Example: “because the program's making a decision you think hey, you know, maybe it's making it's own decision.’’ -P9\n\nRA- (Reality Awareness Incorrect): Showcases largely incorrect understanding of the realities of the situation the meme presents or relationships between its subject matter. Example: “Uh it's just a simple if statement and the guy thinks is this artificial intelligence? I kind of...I don't get this one.’’ - P22\n\nPP+ (Prior Programming Experience): Describing an experience with programming and programming ideas from prior knowledge Example: “an if statement can only make like one like a yes or no choice’’ - P30\n\nPP- (Prior Programming Little to No Experience): Actively describing little to no prior experience with programming or programming ideas from prior knowledge Example: “I don't know a whole lot about if statements, I know that it's like a if this, then this happens um, that's my if-then statement tutorial right there’’ - P8\n\nCO (Comparison Observed): Elements within the meme are being actively compared to each other. “This is like this’’ or “X is A while Y is B’’. Example: “Uh, no, um AI is *chuckles* a bit more advanced than just a bunch of if statements and that's kind of the joke is like yeah just very simplified of something and then like is this complex is this a you know, some complex thing.’’ - P15\n\nSG (Spontaneous Generation): Creation of new memes, conjured people, stories, and relating past experiences in real life to explain understanding. Example: “if I told that to any of my friends you know, who are humanities majors, they'd kind of be like’’ - P29\n\nAB (Abstraction Broadening): More generalized context is created beyond what the meme directly portrays to make it more relatable to a broader audience. Example: “everybody's you know, had to do something some kind of responsibility that they've had to work on, and take time to do, but, maybe they've procrastinated a little too much and that's where the relatable sense comes in.’’ - P8\n\nMP (Meme Parts): The “cogs’’ of the meme are being explored or explained. May showcase understanding or describing the different parts, or indicate the concept of a reusable template, which suggests the template has “parts’’ that can be leveraged. Example: “Like the meme template was like the guy's clearly identifying the butterfly as the wrong thing’’ - P29\n\nFF (Fundamental Flaw): Presentation of some sort of belief about important information to the meme that is incorrect or irrelevant to understanding it. Understanding of the meme may still be correct, but there is a belief as to what is important that is not needed or incorrect in interpretation. Example: “Yeah, and their wings beat very quickly, so that's what I would think is you know when a butterfly's flying they're flapping their wings really fast um so if someone's you know really bored, they'd sit and just refresh Twitter to look at more tweets and then they're not, you know is this working on my book’’ - P26\n\nCA (Cultural Awareness): Acknowledges the existence of or engagement with spaces in a digital and memetic society, such as spaces where memes may be used or “normative’’ behaviors of “meme culture’’; Recognition of humor, chuckling, saying it is funny or a joke. Example: “Subreddit called r/programminghumor, I think I've seen this exact one actually’’ - P12\n\nDuring further analysis, two additional codes were requested and agreed upon for inclusion into the codebook. A note was also added to the codebook above the original codes in an effort to better clarify MS and RA codes.\n\nPB (Potential Bias): Evidence in transcribed entry suggests the possibility of a leading or summarizing question that the participant minimally responds to affirmatively. While this may have been clarifying if pieces around it were transcribed, the piece as presented may be influenced by the interviewer's question more than actually representing the participant's perspective.\n\nCR (Conflicting Responses): Within the same transcribed entry being observed for coding, the participant says something which suggests understanding followed by something suggesting misunderstanding, or vice versa. For example, Meme Symbolism correctly applied, followed by a statement which shows incorrect Meme Symbolism.\n\n5.2 Code Convergence\n\nWith the development of the qualitative codebook, analysis by meme was conducted following a convergence process. Each coder reviewed the codebook for understanding as well as examples of codebook classifications, then reviewed their meme and applied codebook codes to each entry within that meme independently. Codes could be applied once for each timestamped entry. While participants may have multiple data points related to a single meme, each entry was reviewed independently and coded for each relevant code. Coders working on a single meme then came together once all had completed individual coding and reviewed their codes together until they reached agreement, with the results tallied in a final shared convergence analysis. Any coding which had converged prior to the two additional codes being included reviewed their coding and briefly re-converged to incorporate them.\n\nQuick review checks were also conducted as convergence efforts by meme completed to ensure coders across memes felt that the coding done by others seemed to be reasonable representation. Given the management of teams, scheduling, and personnel shifts, this was deemed the most effective way to ensure that while not all coders worked on every meme, coders had verified that other results appeared reasonable, lending a form of overall checks. Note that this means that interrater reliability was not able to be measured across-memes (where different coders may have worked), nor was an “all-hands” convergence conducted.\n\n6 RESULTS\n\nThe final counts of converged code instances across each meme can be seen in Table 8.\n\nMS+ MS MS- RA+ RA- PP+ PP- CO SG AB MP FF CA PB CR Is This A Pigeon? 26 28 5 37 5 10 10 16 13 15 32 6 25 6 1 It's Free Real Estate 38 28 11 51 13 10 5 4 18 14 34 5 31 3 2 Does He Bite? 41 16 11 41 7 27 2 4 17 5 26 4 16 9 3 Gru's Plan 59 10 8 65 7 9 0 2 19 17 47 2 40 12 0\n\nWhile a code may only be applied once per transcribed entry, a participant may have multiple timestamped data points related to a single meme using the same code. To better understand how many individuals per meme indicated specific codes, the analysis for unique participant instances shown in Table 9 was also conducted.\n\nMS+ MS MS- RA+ RA- PP+ PP- CO SG AB MP FF CA PB CR Is This A Pigeon? 18 16 4 23 4 5 2 13 11 13 18 3 14 4 1 It's Free Real Estate 21 14 7 22 12 10 5 3 13 10 19 5 15 3 2 Does He Bite? 22 12 6 21 6 20 2 4 13 5 17 4 12 7 2 Gru's Plan 23 9 5 22 5 7 0 2 12 9 18 1 17 9 0\n\nBased on the code counts, “MS+’’ and “RA+’’ (positive understanding of Meme Symbolism and Reality Awareness) having some of the highest counts would suggest general success among students in understanding the memes presented. However, this alone does not immediately answer the research questions of reasoning processes and potential pedagogical value. Based on this, our analysis moves to the results of two other highly ranked codes related to memetic reasoning and usage: “MP’’ (Meme Parts) and “CA’’ (Cultural Awareness). Of note, an interesting phenomena “variants of correctness’’ was observed in reasoning with the “MS+’’ code, which is also further analyzed.\n\nIn order to better understand processes of understanding as well, we also diverge from strictly examining highly counted codes in order to look at those moments in which understanding was missing, but reasoning was still somewhat or fully successful. To this end we look for intersections related to the “MS’’, “RA’’, “PP’’ (Prior Programming), and “MP’’ codes in which the juxtaposition of knowledge in one area but not another may be captured to better understand what learning and reasoning is occurring at these intersections.\n\n6.1 Communication and Reasoning with Meme Parts\n\nIn the Meme Parts (MP) code, the components of the meme are being explained or explored by the respondent. A respondent may showcase an understanding of or describe in greater detail the meme's different parts – like characters, expressions, physical comic panels, or well-known languages and turns of phrase. While some participants that explore meme parts may describe or focus on a specific element, many touch on themes relating to the meme's “reusability’’, which illuminates what the meme template really captures: that memes are reusable and alterable, meaning the underlying template is made of individual parts that can be leveraged.\n\nFor example, one of the meme templates used in our study, “Is This a Pigeon’’ [25] has several parts that constitute its template. It is a screenshot showing a moment of dialogue, making the caption play an important role. The man addresses what is obviously a butterfly, but questions that it may be a pigeon. So, three essential parts (“entities’’) of this template are the man, the butterfly, and the caption (which conveys the question “Is this a Pigeon?’’). This meme's structure relies on the fact that the question from the man is easily answerable; it is obviously a butterfly (these are the “relationships’’ between the man, butterfly, and caption). These entities and their relationships evoke the structure mapping theory of analogical reasoning [14]. Individuals likely adopt a general schema of reasoning about a particular template through recognition, reasoning, and abstraction from specific examples, aligned with Gentner and Lowenstein's work on generalized schema in analogical reasoning [15]. This generalization following “meme part rules’’ can be observed in common modifications of the meme, which include different text or images over the butterfly, the man, and changing the details of the question in the caption. In all of these other edits, the “rules’’ of the meme are kept intact (the entities and relationships which compose its structure), even as the content and therefore its overall intended message changes. The example in Figure 4 showcases visually how the analogical reasoning structure might be represented for the Synthetic “Curious Squirrel’’ meme introduced in the “Interview Study Design’’ section.\n\nThe analysis provided several examples of participants describing their reasoning using template-based “Meme Parts’’ reasoning. One participant describes the rules of “Is This a Pigeon’’, mirroring what is described above, to understand the nonprogramming meme, which labeled the butterfly as “browsing Twitter’’ and the caption as “Is this working on my book?’’: “Like the meme template was like the guy's clearly identifying the butterfly as the wrong thing so he's not working on his book at all, he's just sitting on Twitter and he's trying to compare that to like working on his book, but it's obviously wrong’’ - P30.\n\nAs another example, in describing “Gru's Plan’’ [27], a participant notes that despite being less familiar with the source material of the meme, they are still able to reason about and understand its parts: “[...] I still understand the reference because you can see it in his face like, he's like getting super excited then he's like “shit’’ *giggles* like I messed up here or something, so I feel like a lot of people if they if they looked at it and they like analyzed the face because you have to look at two different things here you have to look at the writing on the board and his face and how like whatever he's doing to really understand it [...]’’ -P16. This is reflected in the reasoning of another participant: “Usually, I'm sorry, the first two panels are him describing something, and then the third panel it usually switches to something a little more sour, and the fourth panel is him realizing ‘oh this isn't really going with what I was saying earlier’ so he looks back at the slide and kind of the realization hits him’’ -P29.\n\nThe list of possible examples could go on, but these illustrate that participants tend to develop structured reasoning about memes, and that when a generalized schema is achieved, one can observe similar reasoning patterns across participants grounded in their understanding of the template “Meme Parts’’. These similarities in reasoning and conclusions suggest adoption of a shared language, indicating a level of membership into a discourse community [35]. In a discourse community, having a shared language and baseline knowledge is a springboard which leads to greater discussion. While the definition is contentious, most can agree on the goals of a discourse community – most understand that a discourse community is composed of a group of people that have a shared vested interest in discussion about a certain topic Through shared, recognized writing forms, those discussions can take place and critical thinking can occur [35]. For our purposes, memes are the shared, recognized writing form of the community, which is the classroom. The classroom is naturally a place that encourages critical thinking and discussion. The commonality of memes in a forum of open discussion like a classroom may also contribute to a sense of belonging through ability to communicate with the discourse community[23].\n\n6.2 Multiple Pathways to Correct Interpretations\n\nAs a form of communication, memes may be interpreted differently by different individuals, especially if individuals have varying comprehension of the context. The “Gru's Plan’’ [27] meme, for example, illustrates Gru (who, in this case, represents the person reading the meme) finding a bug in a program and then fixing the bug. Then, more bugs present themselves – the amount increasing from panel to panel for humorous effect. Participants who viewed the meme had several distinct inferences about its meaning.\n\nOne conclusion that some participants reached was that the fix to the bug caused new bugs and errors – as stated by one participant, “[...] it's very common that when you're debugging a program um you'll create more bugs than you fix um so that's the struggle that Gru is going through he's elaborating his plan and then he's discovered that he's accidentally made two bugs[...]’’ -P12. An alternate conclusion that was reached was that the fix to the bug revealed existing bugs that were not visible because of the original bug. This interpretation was described by another participant: “[when] you fix that [...] problem uh you [...] find more problems by having that original problem fixed because the previously code that was wrong would make the code uh that's run later uh run correctly even though the first part was wrong so when you fix the first part the later parts actually become wrong as well.’’ -P26.\n\nBoth of these reasons have the same conclusion: more bugs appear when debugging. However, the participants reached this conclusion from different lines of reasoning. The first participant had a surface-level understanding of coding, saying that fixing the bug was what created more bugs. The second participant had a deeper understanding of the concept, pointing out that fixing bugs that stop the code early can unearth bugs that occur in later parts of the program.\n\nParticipants also came to varying conclusions when analyzing the “Does the Dog Bite’’[26] meme. In the programming iteration of the meme, the dog – who participants had previously identified to speak true statements that “hurt’’ to hear – says, “array indexing starts at one.’’ In the following panel, a green-shirted character reacts to the statement as if the dog had physically hurt them. Depending on their programming experiences, the participants had different interpretations of what the dog's “painful truth’’ entailed.\n\nOne participant said, “That one would wound me actually, [...] so I don't know any languages that the array index starts at 1 but, there could be? Uh array indexes typically start at zero in the languages I'm familiar with and having them start at one would definitely put a wrench in a lot of people's um brains’’ -P12. The participant's prior knowledge was exclusively in programming languages in which array indexing starts at zero (indicated by their mention of physical pain at reading indexing starts at one). Regardless, due to their previous understanding of the meme template (the dog speaking truths) the participant acknowledged that there must be languages in which array indexing starts at one.\n\nAnother participant said, “I don't know a whole lot about arrays, maybe some people think they start at zero? Or maybe some other specific number, and that's how they do it, but, maybe this is like the actual true textbook way to do it, so they're hurt by that fact and they don't wanna give up their ways’’ -P8. This participant had little to no prior knowledge about coding and arrays. They are informed exclusively by their prior exposure to the meme template. Despite their limited background, the participant was still able to understand the overarching theme of the meme. This participant deduced the idea that, “some people think [arrays] start at zero?’’ and also previously deduced that the dog speaks truths. These deductions were the basis for their assumption that the dog was exposing the “actual true textbook’’ method of indexing arrays.\n\nIn the case of the first participant, their knowledge of the meme informed them about coding languages where array indexing starts at one. Their preconceived notions were overwritten because they knew the relationship within the meme. In the case of the second participant, a similar process occurred. The dog speaking truths informed them of new information, and the participant was able to draw accurate conclusions within a subject in which they had little knowledge.\n\nThese different interpretations can come from different perspectives, sometimes indicating different levels of experience in the field. Participants of different experience levels reaching the same conclusion from the meme suggests the ability of memes to assist in explaining concepts across multiple background levels. The ability to arrive at correct conclusions across different understanding levels, even with differing interpretation techniques, provides evidence of complex yet valuable reasoning pathways.\n\n6.3 Community Belonging and Cultural Awareness\n\nThe bustling online discourse community is filled with many meme variations. Members can contribute to these digital libraries. These acts of creation strengthen members’ familiarity and enjoyment of memes. In addition, these communities are interlocking, as when a particular meme spreads, the base photo can stay constant while the text may change per the requirements of a specific community. Such transitions of information mean these changes may only connect with very specific audiences as discussed by P20, “Memes are tailored to member or some sort of group” On occasion, a variation will be so relatable that it spreads to many diverse audiences, allowing for even more iteration from communities. This evidence of an intersection between constant change and a consistent community is explained by P24, “[...] I've seen memes like that where the dog is replaced with like country's flags sort of like there's this subreddit called r/historymemes they have a lot of memes like that”. Memes spread to different online groups via members adjusting the template to fit the discourse community's common interest.\n\nEven more valuable, however, are the group bonds forged by memes amplified by both positive and negative emotions. P7, for example, mentions they “can immediately think of one [meme] that me and my friends used to send each other [...] *laughs*,” and the participant then proceeds to explain the study meme's underlying concept. The important information was shared through memes, and the participant had a positive emotional attachment between memes and their friends. The feeling of joy associated with memes and subsequent engagement are exemplified by P26’s reaction, “*laughs* okay. Um *laughs* this one's a little bit more funny”. The participant engagement is not only limited to the initial comprehension, but also in the identification of humor. This connection between emotions and memes has been verified before, as exemplified in the findings of a recent paper by Akram et al: “the disproportionate tendency for individuals presenting symptoms of depression to perceive depressive memes as significantly more humorous and shareable with the potential to improve the mood of others with depression’’ [2]. Further, it has been observed that the connection between emotions and memes is due to personal, opinionated response [29]. An emotional response, positive or negative, increases engagement with the meme and the community at large. In summary, emotions lead to a heightened meme engagement, and meme engagement can lead to stronger emotions overall.\n\nThe intersection of a valuable sense of community and engaging aspect of humor amplifies engagement. For the members, this involvement in the propagation of memes benefits their rational and emotional frame of mind. As stated by P29, “I love programming memes, I think they're so funny when they're done right. [...] it's like combining those two worlds of like ay I recognize that and it's talking about something I know about [...] but it's kind of like the recognition of oh my gosh there are other members who are like me who they like memes and they like programming and they're making content about it.” The unified aspects of a community and positive emotional experiences can aid in the learning process. More specifically, “learning strategies that emphasize emotional factors are more likely to result in long-term knowledge retention” [36, 40]. In addition, these emotions help foster higher engagement with the class material among students. Positive engagement in memes improves mental conditions, which in turn enhances educational endeavors.\n\n6.4 Evidence of Pedagogical Value at Intersections of Understanding\n\nIn the case studies of P4, P8, and P14, each mentioned a lack of prior programming knowledge. Participants either simply stated they had no background, or lacked background on a specific topic. For example, P8 noted, “I don't know a whole lot about if statements”, while P14 said they “didn't really know the true definition of AI”. Yet, each of these participants were still able to move towards a more complete understanding of the core programming concept when presented with the programming meme, albeit not reaching full understanding. With no influence or encouragement from the interviewer, participants used the context of the memes to identify programming concepts such as array indexing, variable types, and even more complex concepts such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) taking up large amounts of memory.\n\nThe correlation between little to no prior programming experience (PP-) and participant ability to understand both the meme meaning (MS) and the real world context (RA) illustrates that memes can be a tool for educational purposes, but only so far as the information that is contained within the meme's frame of reasoning. In the case of the JVM from “Is This Free Real Estate?’’ [24], P26 knew that something named “JVM’’ takes up some sort of resource from the RAM (and that “JVM’’ was represented by the man). Without the word “Java” present, the participant did not recognize the Java logo in the character's eyes, and thus did not arrive at a complete understanding that “JVM’’ and the “coffee’’ (P26) were referencing the same thing.\n\nAnother example is P14 in response to “Is This a Pigeon?’’ [25]. This meme's template suggests dissimilarity between the caption and the element imposed on the butterfly. P14 was not in a position to qualify what AI was (text in the caption), but they knew what it was not, an if statement (the butterfly): “But I know that like from the context of the meme that it's not.” -P14.\n\nA strategy used by students to better ask questions in a pedagogical context is to thematize and analogize information [23]. Students who are given extra context like that which is provided through a meme may be able to better engage by adding self-synthesized comments or questions. A great example of this was demonstrated by P8 – who had little prior knowledge on the topic of AI – but presented a sarcastic and humorous rhetorical statement in response to the “Is This a Pigeon?” [25] meme, saying: “Oh, if I do a bunch of if-then statements, eventually it'll just become smart enough that [it] just works[...]” This rhetorical statement allowed them to organize their understanding.\n\n7 DISCUSSION\n\nWe begin by reviewing our research questions in light of the results.\n\nRQ1. How do students reason through intended meaning when presented with memes?\n\nAs observed in the usage of MP (Meme Parts) from Section 6.1 (Communication and Reasoning with Meme Parts), we find evidence of students using analogical reasoning based on a structured schema to interpret and meaning communicated by memes. This schematic analogical reasoning appears to align with Gentner's structure mapping theory [14], as well as providing evidence of our belief that memetic templates provide a structural schema which is used in the reasoning process.\n\nIn Section 6.2, we also see evidence of Multiple Pathways to Correct Interpretations, suggesting that even with the ambiguity that some analogical forms can invite and despite traversing that ambiguity in different ways, the intended meaning is often still found. This shows that despite complexity and the ambiguity it invites being found in the memetic image as well as reasoning about it, there is a certain robustness in examining their design that seems to offer many ways to reason while still often arriving at correct interpretations. This navigation of ambiguity and different interpretations still leading to similar, often correct, outcomes aligns with the analogical reasoning employed in Bettin et al [4] by students in a concurrent computing course. Despite reading the same assignment prompt, students often interpreted and described details of that prompt very differently, but their answers did not suggest that these differences had led to incorrect outcomes.\n\nRQ2. Are students able to reason about computer science concepts, even ones they may be unfamiliar with, when presented with contextual memes?\n\nAs we saw from the Evidence of Pedagogical Value Intersections from Section 6.4, which explored spaces where various codes overlapped, students who were missing computing context were still able to derive meaning from memes with computing concepts. While this is not a universal truth for every student, evidence of the ability to reason about unfamiliar computing concepts was found. What's more, this evidence was found in an interview study, meaning it occurred outside of a learning environment. A learning environment context may provide additional details and information that would better aid in understanding. We see the ability to reason in “out” context largely successfully as a strong indication that “in” context these elements may be even more strongly understood and thus effective as learning aids.\n\nThe ability of students to reason about the computing concepts presented in the memes appears to align with instructional humor processing theory [40]. While the paper explores humorous messages relayed vocally, memes are messages, often humorous, and in this case portrayed visually. Students appeared largely able to recognize that labels placed on the meme templates created “incongruity” (a gap, where the humor lies, that must be reasoned about to be understood) and often used the Meme Parts explored in Section 6.1 to reason through this incongruity, even in spaces where they were unfamiliar with the content.\n\nRQ3. Does reasoning with memes connect with students in a way they find valuable and/or engaging?\n\nGiven the evidence of Community Belonging and Cultural Awareness in Section 6.3, there appears to be broader conversations and communities that students find connection to when viewing memes. Further, their emotional responses such as laughter and empathy, as well as their commiseration or reflection on similar situations they have encountered, shows active engagement with and relation to the memes. As Tyng et al and Wanzer et al [36, 40] demonstrate, emotional reactions to classroom material can have a positive affect on learning. These reactions were clearly demonstrated and shared by students throughout the study.\n\nFurther, students also discussed communities and “meme culture”, as well as sharing memes with others such as friends and family. This sense of shared language and discourse community [23] established through the use of the Meme Parts (Section 6.1) analogical schema can create a sense of belonging through ability to communicate, understand, and be understood. As sense of belonging can be an important factor in sense of ability and thus resilience within computer science [38], this creates even more potential value for students within the computing learning context.\n\nRQ4. What evidence might exist to support memes as a valuable tool for communicating about computer science concepts in educational contexts?\n\nThe evidence from examining RQ2 and RQ3 point to several interesting pieces of evidence supporting the use of memes in computing education contexts. The ability to derive understanding despite missing or incomplete knowledge using Communication and Reasoning with Meme Parts (section 6.1) and observed in Evidence of Pedagogical Value Intersections (section 6.4) may create valuable scaffolds to learners when they are navigating new computer science concepts “in” context - within a computing classroom or informal computing learning environment. Our study showed evidence of memes being used to build understanding in an “out” context, that is, not within a learning environment but within an interview setting.\n\nThe active processing that students employed in connecting memes to their lives, emotions, and a broader community (most readily explored in Section 6.3, Community Belonging and Cultural Awareness) also suggests memes may be a particularly unique method of fostering student engagement. Students readily shared examples from their life or stories that they had heard that were “like this”, creating connections not just within a memetic discourse community, but to lived and known experiences. Connecting not just the message in the image, but the image to oneself and one's knowledge shows a significant level of active processing and information transfer efforts, which is significant for learning with analogical reasoning [14, 15] as well as general “gap closing” dialectic efforts at bridging understanding [22].\n\nOverall, we had hypothesized that memes had some relational structure which might evoke analogical reasoning, but the specificity with which these structures were described and leveraged was fascinating. Participants ascribed rules to templates and used these rules to evoke meaning and understanding from the memes presented. Even participants lacking programming knowledge were able to reason about programming memes using this logic, drawing at least some degree of meaning. While this was a laboratory study, these findings show significant potential for research using memes in classroom contexts. If participants are able to work toward understanding pedagogical content knowledge without a lesson using memes, there is great potential for their use as an understanding aid alongside classroom content.\n\nFrom an educator's point of view, the possibilities for initial explanation of topics, improved student understanding, and general transfer of information to a wider audience are exciting. Using memetic templates to “reinforce” lesson concepts may promote engagement as students use active processing to reason about the pedagogical meme alongside the actual content. Having students reflect on and discuss the meaning of pedagogical memes provides additional opportunities for classroom engagement. Another activity design idea may also have students develop their own pedagogical memes and explain their choices and the intended meaning to communicate understanding. Students may also find creation of their own pedagogical memes - especially if they are shared with the classroom community - to increase their sense of belonging.\n\nInstructors using memes in a classroom context should work to engage classes in active discussion of not only what a pedagogical meme is conveying, but how that is represented and known. Such activities might support students without initial understanding in gaining the vocabulary and “template rules” to join in both the pedagogical reflection and the shared discourse community. Memes should not be seen as a “replacement” for lessons, but rather a supplement or support that may help increase engagement and understanding among students. Different cultures may also have cultural variants of the same memetic structure using a different image [29], which would be a necessary consideration for their utility in conversations and activities in the classroom.\n\n8 CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS\n\nThis study was conducted within a single university during a single semester, and may not be representative of other contexts, institutions, and study iterations. Recruitment methods may have resulted in a sample which is not representative of the university context.\n\nQualitative coding can result in different individuals approaching the presented data differently. While a codebook and example coded entries helps in baseline training, individuals may still arrive at different conclusions. Convergence ensures that there is a level of agreeance in the approach, but different individuals may still converge and arrive differently, which would alter resulting analysis of the data. This limitation exists across qualitative coding studies. For our study in particular, the lack of interrater reliability across memes and of “all-hands” convergence further suggests that coder convergence by meme is likely to exhibit differences in approach when compared to other analyzed memes. We also note that one author did participate in the interview study when it was conducted and at a later point joined the research lab and analysis team. Given data anonymization before analysis, within-meme convergence, and communications across the full analysis team, we believe any potential effects this may have had should be mitigated.\n\nConsidering our participants and outcomes, many had programming knowledge, the majority of which was with C-family languages. Some programming memes made reference to C-family language concepts. In particular from this analysis, the programming version of “It's Free Real Estate’’ references the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n\nNo participant in our study stated they had absolutely no familiarity with memes, despite active recruitment for such participants. Further, most participants indicated a strong understanding of memes. However, we recognize that not all students may have familiarity with or interest in memes, especially in different contexts and institutions. Given the literature review and an increasingly digital society, this high level of general familiarity might suggest that memes are simply becoming more ubiquitously seen and engaged with as individuals increasingly visit and interact with online spaces. This may make memes somewhat familiar as a baseline among many students, even those who do not particularly enjoy or interact with them. However, this does not dismiss the concern that being disinterested in or lacking understanding of memes could have an undesirable effect on learners.\n\nThere is always a possibility that any instructional strategy or tool will not resonate with a particular student or will not be effective for that student, and memes are no exception. We recommend that instructors attempting to incorporate memes should work to understand their students and context. If a classroom community or instructional style is built solely on memes, it may result in students feeling excluded. We recommend that instructors take care to use memes alongside other instructional methods, not as a replacement for them. With careful and appropriate application alongside other instructional methods, we have difficulty finding any other major concerns or limitations with the use of memes. Inclusion of a meme appears similar to an instructor making a comment on their subject that is intended to be humorous or a joke. While humor does not always land in any context, instructional humor processing theory [40] does suggest that topical related humor is positively correlated with affective learning and learning indicators. This is of course, provided that students understand that is topical humor, meaning that topic instruction must occur outside of this method.\n\nFor students who do understand memes, while pedagogical memes may be relevant there is a chance of distraction from the learning objectives as a result of humor. A student may find themselves caught up in enjoying the humorous content and miss a detail of the ongoing lecture, activity, or discussion. They may also distract themselves away from the classroom setting in order to share the humorous content (or something related that it reminded them of) with others.\n\nThe use of memes in peer group settings may invite the potential for exclusionary behaviors based on group dynamics, but may also create contexts for peers to support each other through explanation and exploration of the memes together. As a value, this would allow peers to create a learning community which includes each other, inviting in those who do not initially understand memes. However, such an approach requires instructor care and observation to examine if the classroom dynamics are creating supportive or potentially exclusionary peer groups. Given this consideration, we might suggest the larger factor for consideration here is the classroom context, balance of usage, and discussion dynamics that occur around the use of instructional memes in this way. Instructors should consider and design for these factors when planning any activities around pedagogical memes to ensure that an inclusive classroom environment is the most likely outcome.\n\n9 FUTURE WORK\n\nConducting further interviews, especially with participants who have less programming and/or meme experience are of interest. Interviews using new memes would also be an interesting future avenue.\n\nFurther analysis of this data set is ongoing. Designing classroom-based meme activities and assessment of the perception, utility, and impact of memes in the classroom is also a logical and intended next step after the results of this work.\n\n10 CONCLUSION\n\nThis paper explored the results of qualitative analysis from an interview study exploring student reasoning using memes. A codebook was developed as part of the data analysis, and exploration of those codes led to four result themes: Communication and Reasoning with Meme Parts; Multiple Pathways to Correct Interpretations; Community Belonging and Cultural Awareness; and Evidence of Pedagogical Value at Intersections of Understanding. Of note, participants from across majors, backgrounds, and skill levels often drew similar conclusions on the meaning of programming memes without a lesson to frame their approaches.\n\nThis exploration yielded indications toward how students reason using memes, as well as evidence of success in doing so with computing concepts. Students also often seemed to enjoy the process of reasoning about the memes through their reactions and responses. The study did so removed from the classroom and lecture context, suggesting this analogical reasoning schematic mechanism is able to be successfully (and often happily) activated in an “out” context. This encourages the possibility that “in” context - from informal learning spaces to classrooms - the schematic scaffolds provided by memes may be able to support students in their learning process for computing concepts.\n\nFurther, this may promote new ways of fostering classroom community and student engagement or sense of belonging. As the theme “Community Belonging and Cultural Awareness” showed, there appears to be a strong sense of discourse community surrounding memes. From smiling to themselves when they stumble upon a meme, seeking them out actively, sharing them with others, or even creating a meme themselves, the shared language of memetic schema is a powerful creative communication and thus, can be a community building tool among students. While it is important that instructors do not over-rely on memes to the point of creating exclusionary or inaccessible environments, memes certainly show positive potential for both individual student engagement and enjoyment as well as positive potential for community and communication building across students. With a new way to communicate and/or understand classroom content and knowledge of a discourse community within the classroom, some students may feel greater motivation to persist even when content gets hard. Some students may find that when they are working to bridge gaps in content knowledge, memes provide them a familiar schema to work to build their knowledge from. Still others may feel more able to express their thoughts and questions as a result of using or engaging with a medium they feel is comfortable or enjoyable.\n\nIncorporating relevant pedagogical memes into slides and readings alongside the concepts the meme examines; as an image greeting students when they enter class or during break sessions; or as a tool to help drive topic discussion through explanation of the humor (and thus, the pedagogical concepts) may all be valuable ways in which pedagogical memes could be introduced into computing learning contexts. In contexts where instructors are certain that it will not create an exclusionary environment, creation of student memes (alone or as a group) and providing an explanation for their pedagogical meaning (and thus, humor) may also present new opportunities for student creativity and a new form of knowledge sharing to enter the computing learning environment and classroom community.\n\nOverall, these findings suggest that memes can provide a powerful schematic structure for activating student analogical reasoning and active processing of information, in a way that for many seems enjoyable. When presented with pedagogical content within memetic formats, even students without familiarity of the topics used this schema to analogically reason about meaning. Within a learning setting, this activation of schema-based analogical reasoning could be a useful scaffold for understanding and learning computing concepts. Thus, these findings suggest positive potential value in instructors using memes as pedagogical tools in computing education contexts."
