I’ve already started floating possible job ideas in my head once I graduate Rowan. I am also taking a minor in advertising just in case I want to apply my RTF skills in a more commercial type of way. The fact is there are so many job opportunities with this major it’s still hard to know which one you will wind up taking once you graduate!” – Emily Sayles, sophomore, RTF major, Advertising minor from Somerdale, NJ (Camden County)\n\n“It teaches me a lot about the industry and how to get my foot in the door.” – Jerry Libert, junior, transfer, first-generation college student, RTF major and Creative Writing minor from Beachwood, NJ (Ocean County)\n\n“It teaches me about the process of making films, television, and radio which allows me to see what things I like about each. It gives me access to equipment I can use to make my own projects.” – Corey Peoples, senior, transfer from RCGC, RTF major from Williamstown, NJ (Gloucester County)\n\n“This major teaches me the skills I will need to get into the industry. By educating us on Radio, Tv, and Film, we are able to get our foot in the door easier because we have so many skill sets.” – Julia Faupel, junior, transfer, RTF major, Theatre minor from Collingswood, NJ (Camden County)\n\n“It helps me to get into NASCAR or the NFL to pursue the career I want.” – Ally Bruce, freshman, RTF major from Woolwich Twp., NJ (Gloucester County)\n\n“I learn from a lot of people who i respect and are professionals in my desired fields.” – Gary Erdelyi, senior, first-generation college student, RTF and Journalism major from Brick, NJ (Ocean County)\n\n“I want to be a screenwriter, and the classes have helped me learn more about the craft while Cinema Workshop has given me real life experience in writing for the screen.” – Joe Pidgeon, junior, transfer, RTF major and Creative Writing minor from Swedesboro, NJ (Gloucester County)\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\n4 Communications Studies Majors Share One Cool Thing They’ve Learned From Their Major\n\nFrom curriculum to content, four Communication Studies majors reveal what they really like about this program.\n\n“I think the coolest thing about the Communication Studies major is our ability to customize our experiences and tailor it to our specific interests through the addition of other majors, minors and CUGS. There’s a lot of really valuable free elective space, so we are granted the opportunity to branch out, try different things, and further our studies in different areas if we so choose. Students should take full advantage of this, and try something new or declare some other majors, minors, CUGS, etc., in order to really make the most of their time at Rowan University and make themselves stand out!” – Nadine El Maalem, junior, first-generation college student, Communication Studies major, with minors in International Studies and Arabic, French CUGS, from Monmouth County\n\n“One cool thing about my major is the conversation-based classes. I’ve found myself engaged 100% of the class time. I have also learned much more in my major courses than in Rowan Core courses because of the way our professors structure them.” – Lexi Robinson, Junior, Communications major, Bellmawr, NJ (Camden County)\n\n“One cool thing that I learned this major is the different types of communication from interpersonal, mediated, and face-to-face. Learning these concepts helped me to be a better speaker and effective communicator.” – Jonathan DeRose, senior Communications Studies major from Marlton, NJ (Burlington County)\n\n“In a way communications reminds me of psychology, but instead of learning about why people are the way they are you learn about how they react to things you say/do. In return you are able to create better relationships with others.” – Tatianna Addison, senior, transfer student from Rowan College of Burlington County, Communications Studies major from Pemberton, NJ (Burlington County)\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nBeyond the Classroom: Generation Action’s Rowan Chapter President, Alexis Thompson\n\nToday we feature Alexis Thompson, who goes by Lex, from Lawnside, NJ (Camden County).

People who care about finance and economics generally tend to gravitate towards each other.” – Brian Vechesky, senior, transfer from Rowan College of South Jersey, Finance major from Burlington, NJ (Burlington County)\n\n“This major was the right major for me in the beginning because I knew that Rowan had an awesome business college, and the amount of networking events that they offer here is invaluable.” – Jonathan Phan, sophomore, Accounting major and Management Information Systems major, commuter from Mullica Hill, NJ (Gloucester County)\n\n“Throughout my first classes each topic sparked my interest.

Campbell Jr., a senior Marketing major from Neptune, NJ (Monmouth County). He lived on campus for three years and lives off-campus this year. Byron is a first-generation college student.\n\nHow have you gotten involved at Rowan?\n\nI joined Greek life and I was a Resident Assistant for three years. I have gone to ASPIRE Leadership retreats, and I have been to Multicultural Men’s Retreats for the Social Justice, Inclusion, and Conflict Resolution (SJICR) office. I have also spoken on a panel about leadership at Rowan.\n\nWhat does the Black Lives Matter movement mean to you?\n\nBLM is an awareness of what’s been happening since the beginning. We want to be equal like everyone else. It’s always been one step forward, one step back. The protests get attention, and they get people to see what’s been happening since the beginning.\n\nWhat do you think that Rowan can do to better serve the BLM movement?\n\nRowan has made great strides, but there should be more free spaces to speak. There is SJICR, where people usually talk. There needs to be more spaces to talk about it. People feel a divide, and they need an opportunity to talk. There are lots of meetings, events and resources are out there, but for some reason it hasn’t translated to the students participating more. Understanding how other people feel is important. You need to understand how others feel.\n\nWhat does inclusivity mean to you?\n\nA space to talk. Some people will put you down and say all lives matter, but having your voice heard is important.\n\nDo you feel Rowan is an inclusive environment?\n\nIt will take a while to be more inclusive. Rowan is reactive and not preventative. Nobody speaks up and tells the right people when there is a problem, but always [does] something after the fact.\n\nCould you share a little bit about your relationship with Vice President Richard Jones?\n\nHe has been one of the most supportive people on campus for me. I met him at my freshman orientation, when he was a speaker. I asked him my freshman year if he could take me under his wing, and he’s helped me through college. Richard Jones has been a mentor to me.\n\nWhat is one of your favorite moments with a faculty/staff member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nOne favorite experience in my Intro to Marketing class with Professor Puckett was learning how marketing is used all the time, whether selling a product or service or even selling yourself for a job. That really made me want to switch my major to marketing. At the time I was an accounting major, and it was Professor Puckett who shared with me that he thought marketing would be a good fit for me.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nOne amazing thing I learned in my major this year is all the paths I can take with a marketing major. I can be in all types of fields in the job force.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nPhotos courtesy of:\n\nByron P. Campbell Jr., senior marketing major\n\n3 Sports Communication and Media Majors Share Why They Became Interested in Their Major\n\n“This major combined my two biggest passions: sports and cameras. I’ve always been a huge sports fan, and I’ve always known I wanted to work in sports. During high school I knew I wanted to work around cameras doing photo/videography. So, when I found out about Sports CAM at Rowan, it was the perfect match.” […]\n\nPhysically Distant but Socially Strong: Luis and Nick\n\nAssistant resident director Luis Acevedo and resident assistant Nick Petrole share how they continue to social distance during the pandemic.

Erwin, a first-generation college student, lives on campus in the Rowan Boulevard Apartments. He’s a member of the Pre Physician Assistant Club, Crew Club Team and the Exercise is Medicine Club, for which he’s Fundraising Chair. Erwin also works for the Office of Orientation and Student Leadership Programs.\n\nWhy did you choose your major?\n\nI chose Health and Exercise Science as my major because at first, I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do. I knew I wanted to go to graduate school, and I knew I wanted to be part of a health-related field. Health and Exercise Science gave me a broader spectrum of things that I can do, such as medical school or PA school or PT and OT, and so on.\n\nWhat would you share with a future student interested in your major?\n\nThe major is fun and you can do a lot with it. It is very versatile and there isn’t only one thing you have to do with it. It is very flexible in regard to what you can do with it.\n\nHow does your field impact the world?\n\nIt’s helping people, no matter what field you go into after completing the Health and Exercise Science program. No matter what you do with it, there’s always going be that aspect of helping people and providing a service to people.\n\nHave you had any professors that you felt really cared about your wellbeing?\n\nThis isn’t major-specific, but my College Composition professor, Professor Mandi Dorrell, was a really great professor. She understood that you’re also a person and not just a student. She was very helpful and understanding of people’s problems. She was very caring in that aspect.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\n9 Biomedical Art & Visualization Majors Tell Us Why Their Major Excites Them\n\nFrom new mediums to emerging technologies, 9 Edelman College of Communication & Creative Arts students in the Biomedical Art & Visualization program share why they are passionate about their major.\n\n“Learning new techniques and nuances of drawing and illustration that I was entirely unaware of prior. That and the steady and consistent addition of new mediums to explore and develop skills with.” – Isaiah Reese, senior, first-generation college student, Biomedical Art and Visualization major with a Biology minor from Newton, NJ (Sussex County)\n\n“I love that I’m getting a great education in the sciences and methods of educating others, while also still be held to the esteem of a studio artist. Though I’m not a studio art major, I’ve still been taught all of the same skills you would expect a studio art major to have. This way I can make beautiful anatomical and scientific drawings as well as traditional fine art.” – Rose Price, senior, first-generation college student and Biomedical Art Visualization major with a minor in Biology, Sicklerville NJ (Gloucester County)\n\n“The BMAV program is much more diverse than you would expect. Students are able to choose their topic of choice to research and to build their portfolio. There might be a student who enjoys studying scientific processes next to you and another student who likes exploring prosthetics on your other side. A student sitting across from you might like studying animals and another likes examining medical conditions. I am never bored in class because there is always something interesting to learn and do. Everyday is exciting and worthwhile.” – Terry Nguyen, junior, majors in Biomedical Art and Visualization and Music, Pre-medical minor from Moorestown, NJ (Burlington County)\n\n“The atmosphere in our major is what excites me most. We are a small family, so we support each other. We all have our different interests and learn from each other as well.” – Mariele Ford, junior Biomedical Art Visualization major with a minor in Biology, Brigantine, NJ (Atlantic County)\n\n“The future of my possibilities [is] in the arts.” – Hannah Knight, senior, transfer, first-generation college student and Biomedical Art and Visualization major with a minor in Art History and an associate degree in Biology from Medford, NJ (Burlington County)\n\n“The thing that excites me the most about my major is the ability to portray what I want while it’s still very informational and well-researched. Creating infographics about animals or plants is definitely what captivates me the most. But not only that, but the ability to also use newer technologies such as 3D modeling and even a chance to experiment with VR excite me to no end!” – Sofia Monaco, junior Biomedical Art and Visualization, CUGS in Game Media Design from Cherry Hill, NJ (Camden County)\n\n“All the possible choices I will have for jobs in the near future and the fact that you build your own way.” – Diana Lahr, sophomore, first-generation college student and Biomedical Art and Visualization major from Elmer, NJ (Salem County)\n\n“I am excited to learn more about the anatomy of humans as well as plants and animals along with how to properly illustrate and explain them. I am also excited to be able to communicate these aspects of life with others.” – Harley Modestowicz, sophomore Biomedical Art and Visualization major, Franklinville, NJ (Gloucester County)\n\n“What excites me most about Biomedical Art is how much I realize I’m being prepared for my future. I feel as if all my classes are geared toward strengthening my talents as an artist and creating artwork just as I would when dealing with clients in the future.” – Veronica Cava, junior Biomedical Art and Visualization major, Marlton, NJ (Burlington County)\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\n#PROFspective: Meet Electrical and Computer Engineering Major Bhavik Malkani\n\nMeet Bhavik Malkani, a junior Electrical and Computer Engineering major with a minor in Systems Engineering and an Honors Concentration at Rowan University. Bhavik is a first-generation college student from Voorhees, NJ (Camden County). Bhavik is a part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Phi Kappa Psi and Honors College. Here, he shares his experience as a Prof thus far.\n\nTell us about one club, organization or group of friends that make you feel like Rowan is home.\n\nOne of the biggest organizations that made me feel like Rowan is my home is Residential Life and University Housing or RLUH. Ever since becoming a Resident Assistant (RA), I have felt like I truly have a home here. Everyone within RLUH has made me feel like family, and it was definitely one of the best decisions I have made so far in my college career.\n\nCould you share a moment you’ve experienced in which you have felt that Rowan is a welcoming environment for you?\n\nI think Rowan being a welcoming environment started with orientation, along with the PROS and other orientation staff who made that experience possible. I met people who immediately made me feel welcome and am still friends with today.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing about one typical day at Rowan for you?\n\nMy favorite thing about one typical day at Rowan is being able to see my friends.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan that was a happy surprise for you?\n\nOne thing about Rowan that was a happy surprise for me was how active campus was along with how many events are put on throughout the semesters.\n\nDescribe for us an experience you’ve shared with a professor or staff member in which you felt like they truly cared about your well-being.\n\nI was a sophomore and concerned about my academic success as well as my choice of major. I talked to a couple professors together after class for a few weeks, and they gave me many study suggestions as well as encouraged me to stick with my current major. They showed me that I could earn my degree and be successful.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nLoredonna Fiore, junior public relations and advertising major\n\nPhotography by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\nBeyond the Classroom: Katelyn Rapp’s PR, Foreign Language Skills Help Her Give Back to Her Community\n\nToday, we feature Public Relations major and senior Katelyn Rapp, a commuter from Pennsville, NJ (Salem County) and first-generation college student. Katelyn recently started interning for the nonprofit organization Miracle for Mateo. She’s also on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using her Spanish translation skills, Katelyn helps out her area’s testing site. Here, she tells us a little more about her experiences and how she’s helping her community.\n\nTell us more about your public relations internship.\n\nI am currently working with Miracle for Mateo, a nonprofit that I have been familiar with since they started up 10 years ago. I actually got involved with them during this past semester because I was doing a couple PR and nonprofit related classwork.\n\nMiracle for Mateo provides financial support for families with dependent children who: have complex congenital heart disease or life-threatening illness and are struggling through a lengthy hospitalization, waiting for an organ transplant, or living at home on hospice care.\n\nI realized during a rhetorical analysis of their website that it was quite outdated and gave the impression that they were no longer a functioning NPO. I knew one of the board members personally, and I reached out to her to see if she would be open to some changes.\n\nBefore COVID started, I went to her house and we talked about all the changes needed. After some approval from the board I was able to rewrite all the body copy for the website, choose updated photos, recreate some graphics with InDesign and now we are about two weeks away from the new website going live!\n\nWas there any Rowan affiliation?\n\nAs far as I know there is no affiliation with Rowan, but I actually think it could be a great idea to create some type of affiliation. They have some small projects that impact people on a great scale (of course I may be a bit biased). Can tab collections and food drives that benefit the families who are by their child’s side in the hospital are two of their longest-running projects that require a bit less ‘in person work’ but make a huge difference for the organization and their families.\n\nHow did you find the opportunity?\n\nI found the opportunity by reaching out to one of the board members I knew personally. I grew up with her kids, and seeing if the organization would consider letting me help. In my ADV/PR Writing course I had to choose an organization to ‘write for’ throughout the semester, and I thought it would be a personal challenge to write for a NPO since all of my internship experience is in oil refineries and transportation. I also decided to analyze their website in my Writing for the NonProfit class since I was already writing a pretend backgrounder and had so much information on the organization. I found the website was outdated and generally needed some work, and although I know I am nowhere near an expert, I thought I might be able to help.\n\nHow did you get involved in your county’s COVID-19 response?\n\nMy mom works for the Salem County Department of Health, and so naturally when COVID hit, she and her coworkers became the response team for my county. Soon enough, my county opened up a COVID testing site, and it became apparent that my county’s Hispanic population was getting hit harder than others. My mom and her coworkers had become contact tracers/COVID test site nurses and were trying to speak what little Spanish they could to communicate. I wrote up a little speech for my mom to use when she called someone to speak with them about results or the test site and they only spoke Spanish. When she came home, she told me the whole department was using it! She also told me that her boss was interested in seeing if I would volunteer at the test site as a translator. The next week I did my fit test, and the day after I went to the test site.\n\nTell us more about your skills as a translator and how that’s helped in your county’s COVID response.\n\nMy skills as a translator allowed me to check in patients at the drive-up clinic, give them instructions on what to expect in the barns (testing area/hot zone), and if they had not signed up for testing before that day give them information on how and where to be screened before coming to the test site for a COVID test. I was also able to help the nurses/contact tracers by writing up some helpful Spanish phrases and a small script, which would allow them to explain who they were and that they would call back with a translator.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to this semester or in the future?\n\nI think I am looking forward to the same things as most students now, I would love to see a safe return to campus to continue my classes. This upcoming semester I am also starting the 4+1 (CAPD Program) Public Relations/Strategic Communication program, so I will start working towards my master’s while finishing my bachelor’s. Personally, I am really looking forward to traveling internationally again. I was planning on a couple of trips this year, but unfortunately traveling isn’t an option right now.”\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nPhotos provided by:\n\nKatelyn Rapp\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Growing as a Writer, Padmini Rao\n\nMeet Writing Arts major Padmini Rao.

I look forward to creating new bonds, extending my knowledge and growing as a writer.\n\nWhat is one activity, club, sport or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan?\n\nI was the president of my school’s poetry club, Young Poet’s Society. From the time I was a freshman I’ve seen it grow from a small club to publishing school magazines. I’m excited to see what Rowan University offers and the range it comes with! I’d [also] love to indulge in swimming!\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?\n\nI had been awfully torn between choosing a major for my passion or career and my passion won! Creative writing is what I’ve grown up with and what has grown with me. I look forward to enhance my skills as a writer.\n\nHow did you get to know campus?\n\nI have friends that go to Rowan, I’ve visited them and taken a tour individually. I have also toured with a guide so I’m pretty familiar with the campus!\n\nWhat music do you like?\n\nHip-hop/R&B soul, but I’ve got a soft spot for pop and rock. In fact I’ve made some songs myself.\n\nNight owl or morning person?\n\nWeirdly both, I honestly prefer naps in the middle of the day.\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nIts writing program intrigued me, and I wanted to explore more!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMelanie Sbaraglio, public relations and advertising graduate\n\nPhotos by:\n\nPadmini Rao\n\n#PROFspective: Rising Senior Psychology Major Callie DeMaria\n\nToday we feature rising Senior Psychology Major Callie DeMaria. Callie is an off-campus resident from Little Egg Harbor, NJ (Ocean County). Callie is a first-generation college student.\n\n​On your busiest day, what academic, non-academic, and social responsibilities are you juggling?\n\nOn my busiest day, I usually have two classes I have to attend, then I usually spend the bulk of my day in Savitz Hall in the Admissions Office either doing office work or giving tours at the Welcome Center, then I will usually attend an event my sorority would be hosting or compete in an intramural game, and finally, I usually get dinner with my friends. To end the day, I will go to the library for an hour or two to finish up on some homework.\n\nDid you ever have a moment of uncertainty within your major? How did you get through the challenge?\n\nI never had a moment of uncertainty within my major. I was very stressed about what I would do with my Psychology degree. Until last year, I had no idea. Then one of my professors introduced me to Applied Behavior Analysis. After hearing about it, I knew that is exactly what I wanted to do. Now, I am applying to graduate school to receive my Masters in Applied Behavior Analysis.\n\nTell us about one moment that made you feel like Rowan was the right fit for you.\n\nI knew Rowan was the right fit for me when I took a tour of the campus. My tour guide was very knowledgeable and was able to answer all my questions. I was very interested in a lot of the clubs my tour guide mentioned as well. As soon as I got to campus, I got heavily involved and through my involvement, Rowan became my second home.\n\nTell us about your transition into college and how you pushed through any challenges.\n\nCollege was not an easy transition for me. I was a homebody in high school, so leaving my family was very hard. I won’t lie, the first few weeks were hard. But once I got involved, and started to meet new friends, I didn’t want to leave campus. Since I forced myself to go outside my comfort zone, it helped me to feel more at home and more comfortable at Rowan.\n\nWhat advice would you give your high school self about choosing a college?\n\nThe advice I would give my high school self would be to choose the college that feels like home once you step on campus, that has a ton of internships and opportunities for me, and the college that has a lot of extracurricular clubs and organizations I would love to join.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nSophomore Reflects: Monica Torres Shares Her Freshman Experience and Advice\n\nToday we feature rising sophomore Monica A. Torres. Monica is a Computer Science major with a concentration in Software Engineering from Jersey City, NJ (Hudson County). Monica is an on-campus resident. She lived in Evergreen Hall during her freshman year, and now will be living in the Edgewood Park Apartments for her sophomore year. Monica is a first-generation college student.\n\nWhat did you most enjoy during your freshman year at Rowan?\n\nThe thing I enjoyed the most was getting a feel for everything. There are a lot of activities set up for freshmen not only for them to have fun, but for them to get a feel for the campus. One, for example, is Welcome Week, where many students from all grades come together to enjoy each other’s company and welcome the freshman and new transfer students to campus. I enjoyed meeting new people and seeing that Rowan is very diverse.\n\nCould you share a happy moment you had with friends, professors, or other members of the Rowan community that made you realize Rowan felt like home?\n\nOne of my favorite memories was getting to know my roommate. We were familiar with each other through PCI (Pre-College Institute), aka EOF (Educational Opportunity Fund), over the summer, but we didn’t really talk. However, once I got to know her, we had a lot in common, and exploring campus with her was fun. I’m from Jersey City, so to have someone who is from South Jersey as a close friend is great, because we get to compare North Jersey and South Jersey.\n\nWhat advice do you have for future freshmen looking at colleges right now?\n\nMy advice to future freshmen is that it isn’t about getting a good grade, it’s about understanding the material for your major. In addition, it’s okay to not know what you wanna study right off the bat because that is what advisors are for. They are there to help you explore and find a major that suits you.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to next year at Rowan?\n\nI can’t wait for some of my friends from home to come to Rowan. I can show them around and help them get around. Plus, it means the friend group on campus gets bigger. It will be nice to have a few familiar faces from home on campus, to be honest, because I won’t be as homesick.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nRA and Psychology Major Jeremiah Garcia Reflects on His Experience as a Rowan Freshman\n\nToday we feature third-year Psychology major and Urban Studies minor Jeremiah Garcia. Jeremiah is a first-generation college student from Camden, NJ (Camden County). Jeremiah is also a Residence Assistant (RA) in Evergreen Hall.\n\nHow does being involved on campus impact your college experience?\n\nI am an RA and I am involved in the Minority Association of Premedical Students (MAPS), and the Residence Hall Association (RHA). I was able to step outside of my comfort zone, learn leadership and confidence, and feel like I have my voice heard. As an RA I help incoming freshmen with things I had a hard time with. This has made me a better person and made me not afraid to use my voice.\n\nHow were you able to make friends on campus?\n\nI made friends by going to the Rec Center. I was able to get my mind right at the Rec Center when things got hard and I met people there. I also met people at events, Rowan After Hours (RAH) and classes. Freshman year was competitive, but you have to be a leader in class and make study groups or say that you should get lunch together. It depends on the class, though. Some are more group-oriented than others.\n\nHow were you able to adjust to campus life?\n\nI was able to adjust by getting help and using Rowan’s resources. Putting myself out there was the best way to adjust. It gave me confidence and a push to succeed.\n\nWhat does inclusivity mean to you?\n\nSome people are different, and it is important to have inclusivity so that people can make new friends and have the same opportunities as everyone else regardless of race, gender and appearance.\n\nDo you think that Rowan is inclusive?\n\nYes. Everyone has the opportunity to be in leadership positions, they just need to do well academically and have the confidence to earn the positions. Rowan is inclusive.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to next year?\n\nBeing on campus. I miss campus. I am also excited to get into new opportunities. I would like to try out for the baseball team and to get into an honors society. It will be my second year as an RA and I am looking forward to the experience. I am also looking forward to taking new classes, doing well in my major and getting better grades.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\n#PROFspective: Nutrition and Exercise Science Major Caroline Lippincott\n\nToday’s #PROFspective features Caroline Lippincott, a senior majoring in Nutrition and Exercise Science from Columbus, NJ (Burlington County).

Peterson reflects on his experience as a Prof and how he made the most out of his college experience.\n\nDid you have an on-campus job?\n\nI worked for the Office of Career Advancement, which consisted of filing documents, answering phones, managing meetings, preparing career fairs, engaging and interacting with students. It was a great opportunity to acquire well-rounded skills to apply in an office setting post-grad. It enhanced my customer service, Excel sheet and interpersonal communication skills.\n\nDo you have any mentors at Rowan?\n\nMr. Richard Jones, [Vice President of Student Engagement], has been a mentor of mine. I was part of a new program he was starting up to best interact with students and increase student participation on campus, which helped to broaden my horizon.\n\nWhat is your favorite academic or professional accomplishment?\n\nThat I graduated and am in the position I’m in. Not everyone gets the opportunity or finds the motivation to go to college where I’m from.\n\nWhat got you interested in your intended field?\n\nI was always interested in finding the reasons why people do the things they do. Originally, I was a psych major but changed due to the amount of school you need to go through and knowing how much money people pay psychologists to receive help. I want to figure out the common problem a group of people have and create a space for them to relate and resolve the problem.\n\nSociology keeps the mind running and I love it. I will never stop thinking and learning in my field. I get to live and learn through everybody else. I will use their testimonies for future experiences.\n\nEventually, I’d love to help traumatized soldiers transition into society. Every group of people is institutionalized in their own way. Students in school, inmates in prison, soldiers in combat. Soldiers don’t have an accessible outlet. Most people can call a friend, parent, or mentor to mellow you out; but as a soldier, not many people can relate to the suffering or they have difficulty opening up. Talking to a counselor engages everyone in the discussion. It teaches them the tools to reclaim a “normal” lifestyle and how to handle and cope with certain environments.\n\nWhat knowledge or skills have you developed through your time at Rowan that you will take into you for future endeavors?\n\nThe most important lesson I’ve learned at Rowan is exercising social skills — articulating a conversation, guiding important discussions, interacting in the corporate world … being punctual, organized and accountable.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nAlyssa Bauer, public relations graduate\n\nPhotos courtesy of:\n\nPeterson Dossous\n\nJunior Major Moments: Bio Major Michael Camacho on His Favorite Class and Rowan Clubs\n\nToday we feature Michael Camacho, a Biological Sciences major with a minor in Psychology. He is a first-generation college student who commutes from his home in Pine Hill, NJ (Camden County).\n\nWhat is your favorite moment with a faculty member or favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nMy favorite part was going to my Microbiology class and learning from Dr. Elizabeth Brooks. She taught her lectures in such a manner that not only excited me to learn, but also intrigued me. She has over 30 years of experience in her field and still has this spark of passion in her that is truly remarkable and inspiring to me. One day I hope to walk in her footsteps and become the passionate, caring, professional, and inspiring person that she is.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nI’d say the most amazing and interesting thing I’ve learned in my major is that the human body truly is amazing in that the physiology protects us every day.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth?\n\nSome of my pre-professional experiences include the Minority Association of Premedical Students (MAPS) and Rowan’s Biology Club. Though, the one organization that has truly supported my growth is Alpha Phi Omega (APO).\n\nWe are an organization that strives by our principles of being a leader, being a friend, and being of service. Being surrounded by these individuals has truly made it feel like a second home and seeing the passion in each of us to be of service to our community is one of the many reasons why I enjoy APO so much.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\n#PROFspective: Feeling Like a Member of the Student Body Through the Online Learning Experience\n\nMeet Liberal Studies major Krystal Mannering from Atlantic County, NJ. Krystal, a first-generation college student, works full-time while running a business, providing for her household and taking care of a toddler. Read her perspective on how Rowan has made her feel “accepted and welcomed” as an online student.\n\nBeing an online student for most of my educational career, the need for a connection with a physical campus might seem like a translucent goal. Common speculation is online students aren’t receiving “the college experience” that an in-person student receives.\n\nFor many online colleges and educational facilities, this statement is true. I’ve attended two other online colleges throughout my career, and Rowan University is the first online program where I’ve felt like an actual member of the student body.\n\nFrom the moment I called Rowan, I felt accepted and welcomed. My heart had just been broken by my current school at the time, and as I was sobbing uncontrollably, I began calling multiple schools and explained my situation. The first Rowan advisor I spoke to was faced with the challenge of my vulnerability but ensured me that even as an online student, my role had a place.\n\nI work a full-time job, have a home to provide for, a business, and a toddler to take care of, so online schooling is my only option. Two other schools stated they couldn’t help me, and another didn’t answer the phone. The advisors at Rowan greeted me with a cheerful attitude and helped me every step of the way. Even though I live an hour away, the Rowan staff took the necessary time I needed to feel comfortable with my decision.\n\nAs I entered my first semester, I was armed with eagerness and fear. I wasn’t sure what to expect. I wasn’t sure that I was going to feel the acceptance that I craved. I joined Rowan’s social media platforms and I was quickly comforted by fellow Rowan students. One student suggested that I attend the campus orientation and I signed up for the next available event (highly recommended!).\n\nWalking through the Rowan campus reassured my decision to attend Rowan as an online student. It felt right to walk through the halls, dorms and college grounds. Each orientation leader was extremely informative to the incoming freshman students, and each demonstration I attended that day began to further confirm my choice.\n\nThe orientation leaders expressed that online students are offered the same accommodations as in-person students. My friend (and now fellow classmate) and I walked through the streets of the campus, and we were presented with cheerful little shops, wonderful eateries, statues and artifacts plastered throughout the campus.\n\nAs the event concluded, my friend and I decided to make our way out to Richard Wacker Stadium, the stadium that I will graduate in. Being eligible to attend a physical graduation as an online student is very important to me and is one of the many perks of studying online with Rowan University. As we stepped foot onto the track that surrounds the beautiful stadium, the reality of my choice to attend Rowan began to set in.\n\nOverwhelmed with emotion, I was so thankful to have found Rowan University. The online classes are more organized than other schools that I’ve attended. The professors are extremely involved, and helpful if you maintain a consistent work ethic. The alumni at Rowan reassured me that my needs weren’t burdensome. Class sizes are manageable, and classmates are a welcoming wealth of knowledge. Each day, I continue to be thankful for my choice to attend Rowan University as an online student. My future is clear now that I’m a PROF!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nKrystal Mannering, liberal studies major\n\nJunior Major Moments: Law and Justice Major, Track and Field Captain Francis Terry\n\nToday we feature Francis Terry, a Law and Justice Studies major from Laurel Springs, NJ (Camden County) who recently completed his junior year at Rowan. Francis, a first-generation college student, is a transfer student from Neumann University and lives off-campus.\n\nCould you share your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nMy favorite moment with a faculty member was with my coaches on March 15, 2018 in Birmingham, Alabama at the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships. I finished 5th in the nation and earned my first All-American accolade. When they called my name I stepped on the podium and looked at the cameras, the crowd and my teammates cheering for me. My assistant coach, Coach Tate, handed me the medal. I remember hugging Coach Tate thanking him for everything he’s done for me.\n\nWe took our picture and I had to get my pants and jacket back on and cool down because I had another race in about 2 hours. The 4×400 was the last event of the day and we finished 3rd in the 4×400. That placement would place us 3rd in the nation as a team. So after I hugged my teammates and congratulated the other teams I got back on the podium. When I got off the podium I saw my Head Coach, Coach Dimit, crying tears of joy so we hugged. We were all so excited to be ranked 3rd in the nation as a team. No, we didn’t win the National Championship, but we were all still proud of every single one of our teammates.\n\nIs there anyone who is a visionary in your field who inspires you and goes above and beyond for you? I wouldn’t say he’s a visionary in my field, but someone who has impacted me tremendously at Rowan University is Eddy. He’s one of the janitors at Rowan University in Esby Gym [editor’s note: this staff member was identified as Edward Garrison, senior maintenance worker for both Esby Gym and The John Green Team House]. Eddy is one of the loudest, but also down-to-earth men I have ever met. Every time I walk into Esby Gym I can just feel his presence. He always screams “Yo Francis,” then shakes my hand and asks how my day is going. Some days we just stand in the hall and talk about sports, life, or anything on our minds that day.\n\nNo matter what, Eddy always makes time to say “Hi” to someone. He’s one of the hardest-working guys I know, and his attitude is always upbeat no matter what. I may not want to be a janitor in my lifetime, but I want to mimic the way he looks at life — his demeanor, work ethic, attitude and just his everyday life of bringing happiness to others. Eddy is one most influential people I’ve encountered throughout my life. Every day I’m blessed to have met a man like Eddy and have him to help shape me for the future.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting ​thing you’ve learned in your major this year? The most amazing thing I’ve learned in my major this year was in my Law Seminar Class with Professor Stone. Even though the majority of the class was taught online due to COVID, this class really opened my eyes. During the course of the semester, we had to use an Excel spreadsheet and take our 40 questions and ask every student who was enrolled in that class questions about their family life. We then had to compare all of our work and compare it to our thesis. We wrote about a 10-page paper on our thesis and results that we calculated throughout the semester. It was an awesome experience working with classmates and developing our own short theory.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth? Due to COVID, I had one internship canceled, but two pre-professional experiences I have had would be being a Team Captain for the Men’s Track and Field team and working on the Board for S.A.A.C (Student-Athlete Advisory Committee). Being one of the Captains in the team I’ve definitely had to look at myself differently. Over the past 4 years at Neumann and Rowan, I’ve had many people to look up to and follow. Jeffery Tucker was one of the Captains in 2018, and he’s played a huge role in my life on and off the track.\n\nBeing a captain you’re held to a higher standard. As a captain, I’ve been in difficult situations with my own teammates but we’ve worked past them together. I always try and make myself available for my teammates or even other student-athletes. We all have stuff going on in our lives and every day I’ve learned something new from being around other student-athletes. When you’re around 70+ teammates and being one of the leaders of the team it gets very stressful. Being a captain doesn’t make me higher than anyone else, we are all still on the same team representing the same school and athletic department. I strive to represent myself in the best way possible in the classroom, on the track and even within the community. I hope that I can impact someone’s life for the better the way Jeff did for me.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\n#PROFspective: Sophomore Health Promotion and Wellness Management Major Brianna Bentley\n\nToday we feature sophomore Brianna Bentley, a first-generation college student.

What made Rowan feel like home was the group of friends I made through my organization. Everyone was extremely welcoming and supportive. There’s never a boring time at programs and meetings, and you can make great friends. For instance, when we don’t have a program coming up, we spend time outside of the club playing games, cooking, and chatting at a member spot.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing about your typical Monday at Rowan?\n\nAfrican Student Association (ASA) general meetings have to be one of the greatest things on Mondays at Rowan. As an e-board member, I have to go to general meetings and bring Rowan ASA together. We all meet up and do activities to educate African students.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan that was a happy surprise for you?\n\nOne thing that was a happy surprise to me about Rowan is that there’s always something to do. For instance, Rowan After Hours (RAH) hosts events every Thursday, Friday and Saturday for students on and off-campus. Before coming to Rowan, I was a homebody, but the events on campus are interesting and it forces me to come out and meet new people.\n\nDescribe for us an experience you’ve shared with a professor or staff member in which you felt like they truly cared about your well-being. ​\n\nDuring my first semester, I struggled horribly to stay on top of my work due to being a first-generation student with no support from home. Not because I was not hardworking, but because my memory was almost nonexistent. It did not imply if I went to class because I couldn’t concentrate. Not like, “Oh! I am just distracted,” but like, “Did I even go to class today? What did we talk about?” “How are my siblings back home?” “Who’s helping my mom?” It was scary and frustrating. But reaching out to my professors and communicating with them cleared my mind off a little.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nNicole Cier, writing arts graduate\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Computer Science Major, Musician Hunter Gareau\n\nToday we feature Computer Science major Hunter Gareau.

I’d like to continue playing trumpet in college.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?​\n\nI wanted to design games for a while, but I decided to broaden that with computer science. I like being creative, and I’m good at math, so this is my ideal field.\n\nHow did you get to know campus?\n\nI visited the campus last summer while looking at colleges.

She’s a first-generation college student who transferred to Rowan University from Rowan College of South Jersey. She reflects on her time at Rowan and tells us where she’s headed next.\n\nHow does it feel to be an official college graduate?\n\nIt feels great! I am a first-generation college student, so to be able to have this accomplishment for not only myself but for my family as well is a great achievement. I worked very hard to graduate, and although I loved my time at Rowan, I am excited to see what is next for me.\n\nWhat was your most memorable experience at Rowan?\n\nMy most memorable experiences at Rowan are the times I was able to work with the amazing students and staff in the Reading Clinic and the Rowan University Early Childhood Demonstration Center. The Reading Clinic is where I had my classes School Reading Problems and Supervised Clinical Practice in Reading. In those classes, I was able to tutor children with reading comprehension, fluency, writing and word study. I loved seeing how much the children’s literacy skills grew by the end of each semester.\n\nIn this class, I worked with amazing people who guided me in my journey to become a teacher. Those people include my classmates, Kelly the secretary, and my professor the amazing Dr. Valarie Lee. I also loved my time at the Rowan University Early Childhood Demonstration Center. The children and staff there were all so sweet, and it was the best way to either start or end my school day! I loved seeing how creative the children could be. And I loved having little dance parties with the children. I do not think I ever had a day there where I was not laughing or smiling.\n\nWhat are the things you will miss the most about Rowan?\n\nI will definitely miss the staff and students at Rowan University Early Childhood Demonstration Center. I will also miss my advisor (April Ellerbe), and my professors I had throughout my years here at Rowan. I will also miss HollyBash, it was always something I looked forward to during the Spring semester.\n\nWhat’s next for you?\n\nI have been applying to many daycares to become a teacher lead, and I am just waiting to hear back from them. I heard back from one daycare, and they told me when they are open again they will get in touch with me!\n\nAny advice for those who are graduating next year?\n\nBe proud of this accomplishment no matter how long it took you. I am graduating with my bachelor’s in Literacy Studies after six years of college, and I am very proud of myself. No matter if you graduate in four years or six years or more than that, what you have done is amazing and I want you to celebrate this milestone. You deserve it!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nBehind the Scenes with #Rowan2020 Contest Winner Edgar Aquino Huerta, Creator of the Viral Graduation Video\n\nMeet recent graduate and #Rowan2020 Social Media contest winner, Edgar Aquino Huerta! Edgar, from Bridgeton, NJ (Cumberland County), earned a bachelor’s degree in Radio/TV/Film. His virtual commencement video became a viral sensation and caught the attention of national media outlets. Read more about Edgar and his plans after Rowan.\n\nEdgar Aquino Huerta wants to be famous for creating videos and films, but he never expected popularity to come so soon.\n\nHis 15-second video has racked up over 600,000 views on TikTok, over 34,000 views on Instagram, and over 3,500 views on Facebook.\n\nEdgar’s video features him celebrating his graduation at the farm where he works. In it, he watches Rowan’s “virtual commencement,” and then walks down the center aisle of a greenhouse as his coworkers applaud. This is set to the tune of Glenn Miller’s “In the Mood,” a song that makes Edgar think of the Golden Age of Hollywood — fitting, since he dreams of making it big as a screenwriter and director.\n\nWhen Rowan announced a social media contest, Edgar started brainstorming. The best five posts from graduating Profs would win $100 Target gift cards, and Edgar thought that “sounded good.” At first, he struggled to come up with an original idea. Then, his boss made a joke about holding commencement at the farm.\n\nEdgar ran with that idea and drew up storyboards. He says, “Although my video was 15 seconds, I still wanted to use my skills to make it cinematic.” He learned a lot as a Radio/TV/Film major at Rowan, and wanted to make the best contest entry possible.\n\nEdgar says that two of his coworkers, Maria and Jose, were especially important to the video’s production. Maria helped organize everyone by telling the other workers where to stand. Jose assumed the role of cameraman — despite having never used an iPhone before! Edgar taught him on the fly and was impressed with how quickly Jose caught on.\n\nAt first, Edgar says his coworkers didn’t understand the video they were making. He says, “It wasn’t until they saw the final picture that they understood the purpose of the video.” That said, they were always enthusiastic to help celebrate his achievement. And later on, some coworkers “even made their kids download TikTok so they could show their families.”\n\nEdgar also received support from his mother, who has been in Mexico for the past 10 years. She got “sentimental because she couldn’t be with [him] during that little ceremony.” The image on Edgar’s cap is actually a picture he drew of his mother. He included that as a way to recognize all she’s done for him over the years.\n\nEdgar’s video got very popular overnight, and only got more buzz from there. He says, “The next morning, I noticed the video was going viral.” His phone was going off constantly with notifications. It wasn’t before long that news stations caught wind of the sensation. He has now been featured on several platforms, including Good Morning America, Un Nuevo Dia (Telemundo), and Despierta America (Univision). Edgar says, “I was making headlines for one week straight, and getting to talk to people I never thought I would meet.” He was even contacted about a few work opportunities in Los Angeles.\n\nEdgar attributes the video’s viral success to a couple different factors. For one, it was uploaded at just the right time. With the COVID-19 pandemic ruining gatherings of all kinds, these are unprecedented times. Edgar’s uniquely safe way of celebrating acts as a much-needed ray of hope. Edgar says, “I turned a bad situation into something great.” Additionally, the video encourages pride in underappreciated workers. Greenhouses are places of hard manual labor, but Edgar chose to celebrate its beauty instead. Edgar says, “I was aiming at inspiring my community into being proud of where they come from, and to never feel ashamed of our own people.”\n\nIn the future, Edgar plans to move to Los Angeles and write screenplays. He credits Rowan’s Professor Keir Politz with helping him decide to pursue this path. Edgar wants to expose his “audience to these worlds that are being ignored.” For now, Edgar and his friends are working on projects to show appreciation for farm workers in their community. They do this though organizing caravans and collecting donations to meet the workers’ needs. Edgar wants everyone to know that farm workers are essential.\n\nYou can hear about Edgar’s immigration story in this audio documentary from Rowan Radio.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nAdam Clark, senior radio/television/film major\n\n#PROFspective: Sophomore Health Promotion & Wellness Management Major Hajah Carpenter\n\nToday we feature sophomore Health Promotion & Wellness Management major Hajah Carpenter. She is a first-generation college student from Somerdale, NJ (Camden County). Before campus closed due to COVID-19, Hajah lived in the Rowan Boulevard Apartments.\n\nHow are you getting the most out of your college experience?\n\nI’m getting the most out of my experience at Rowan by trying to participate, get involved and take walks on beautiful days. I really appreciate Rowan’s campus and how beautiful it is.\n\nWhat are you learning socially and academically about yourself?\n\nI am learning about how much I love to work and communicate with people! I love to help others, whether it’s with schoolwork or being someone to talk to!\n\nHow have you grown as a person since coming to Rowan?\n\nRowan has helped prepare me for the outside world and has made me very excited for my future! My ideas for the future have grown and I’m excited to continue in my education! My major has inspired me to hopefully open up my own gym one day!\n\nWhat experiences have you enjoyed the most at Rowan?\n\nI love all the events Rowan runs in the Student Center!\n\nHow do you get involved on campus?\n\nI get involved by attending events on campus, and being a part of the Club Lacrosse team!\n\nHow have you made friends and continue to make friends?\n\nI have many many friends at Rowan who I love dearly. I have met some friends from Willow Hall, where I lived my freshman year! I also like to keep in contact with people I have done group projects or been in classes with! I have made a good amount of my friends in study groups I join for my classes too.\n\nHow do you create that “away” at school experience while close to home?\n\nMy friends have become my family here at Rowan, so I feel at home here.\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nRowan has always had a good reputation while I was growing up! My family is from Glassboro, and watching the ‘boro be built up to what it is now has been amazing!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Psychology Major, Maryland Native Bri Broadwater Headed to Glassboro\n\nToday we feature future freshman Bri Broadwater from Bel Air, Maryland. Bri is a Psychology major and the first in her family to attend college.\n\nWhat is one activity, club, sport or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan?\n\nIn high school I was involved in a lot of extracurricular activities. Most of them were based around choir and the Creative Writing Club, which I founded.\n\nIn my junior year I decided to try out for cheerleading. At first, I was not sure if it was the right choice. How was a visually impaired girl who had never cheered before going to learn all of the complexities of this hands on sport? It was not easy, and I made a lot of mistakes. But I loved it! I learned to tumble, stunt, and smile, even when I’m tired. Not only has it made me a better athlete, I am also a better person because of it. I will not be trying out for cheer at Rowan during my first year, but that does not mean that I won’t cheer again.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?\n\nHave you ever wondered why people are the way they are? Why addicts stay addicted even though it damages them? How mothers can look at the children they birthed and hurt them in the same ways they were hurt, children repeating the same mistakes they saw their parents make? Have you ever wondered any of those things? I have, and the field of psychology is a great place to start looking for answers to questions like that. It also puts people in a position to help others who are searching for the same answers.\n\nWhat is something you’re looking forward to next year at Rowan?\n\nLike most freshmen, going to college will be the first time I am on my own. When I visited Rowan, there were a multitude of things that interested me — from the theatre program to taking a dance class. There are so many things that I cannot wait to become a part of.\n\nWhy did you choose a university that is out-of-state or out-of-country for you?\n\nI have always been an adventurous person. As a child, I moved around a lot. I got to learn about different cultures and people, and I stayed in interesting places. Because of this, I like to explore and see new places and people.\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nI visited 7 colleges over the past two years — from South Carolina to Ohio, and even two colleges in my home state, Maryland. Visiting Rowan was different from any of them. The atmosphere was so fun and inviting, and I could see myself being in classes at Rowan as well as extracurriculars.\n\nI felt like Rowan pulled me out of my shell. College is going to be a new experience, and Rowan is where I feel most comfortable having that new experience.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nJunior Major Moments: Law and Justice Major, Student-Athlete Johnathan Nguyen\n\nToday we feature Johnathan Nguyen, a Law & Justice major from Galloway, NJ (Atlantic County) and a member of Rowan’s Track and Field team. He is a first-generation college student who transferred to Rowan and commuted until COVID-19 shut down campus.\n\nWhat is one of your favorite moments with a faculty/staff member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nOne of my favorite moments with a faculty or staff member would have to be meeting Coach Dimit. He introduced me to the school and team and made me feel like family the moment I stepped on Rowan’s campus.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting ​thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nThe most interesting thing I learned about this year would have to be in my class “Treatment of the Offender.” You learn so much different material and it wouldn’t be the same without my professor Joel Friedman.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth?\n\nThe internship I will be applying to in spring 2021 is helping me grow as a person and help guide me to be a better person in school. There are guidelines to make for the internship so I would have to keep my GPA up and make sure I have enough credits every semester.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMelanie Sbaraglio, public relations and advertising graduate\n\nMeet Rowan #2024: Athletic Training Major, Firefighter Chooses Rowan To Be Close to Hometown\n\nToday we feature Logan Robenolt, an incoming Athletic Training major from Barrington, NJ (Camden County). He tells us more about what he’s looking forward to at Rowan University and why he chose Rowan.\n\nWhat is one activity, club, sport or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan?\n\nI did stage crew in high school, and I would like to continue to help with productions that take place at Rowan.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?\n\nI chose athletic training since I would like to become a physical therapist and this is a start to that profession. But the reason why I want to become one is that I was in physical therapy for about three years when I broke my arm and I just grew a liking to it.\n\nWhy did you choose a university close to home?\n\nI chose a university close to home since my twin brother wanted to go to an out-of-state college, and I wasn’t trying to create a lot of debt. However, I am a firefighter in my hometown so when I’m home I can still run fire calls when the time permits.\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nI’ve had many teachers and mentors who were in Rowan for my major and other topics. They encouraged me to go to Rowan since it’s the same education — if not better than — other schools for a much, much cheaper price.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nFirst Year Voices: Shahir Mollah Talks Cars & Mechanical Engineering\n\nToday’s (FRESH)man Voices features Shahir Mollah, a mechanical engineering from Galloway, NJ (Atlantic County) who lived in Mullica Hall until COVID-19 shut down the campus.\n\nWhat inspired you to choose your major? I’ve always been a big car guy. Junior year of high school I wanted to build a car, which inspired my decision to become a mechanical engineer and add an automotive engineering concentration.\n\nHow does your involvement with SAE/Motorsports help you professionally? In SAE/Motorsports, we get hands-on experience designing a motorsport vehicle, then travel to compete the car in a bunch of races. This process prepares me for my future in automotive engineering and allows me to meet like-minded people.\n\nDream car company you’d work for? Mazda or Ferrari!\n\nWhat’s the best decision you’ve made since you got to college? Applying for a specialization in automotive engineering because my senior year I’ll be able to take courses specifically about how to engineer and manufacture cars.\n\nWhat advice would you give your high school self about choosing a college? Choose an affordable and quality program that best fits your major.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\n#PROFspective: Computing & Informatics Major Robert Brown\n\nToday’s #PROFspective features Robert Brown, a junior computing and informatics major from Bridgeton, NJ (Cumberland County), who lived in the Triad apartments until COVID-19 shut down the campus. He’s looking forward to being a resident assistant in Magnolia Hall when returning in the fall.\n\nWhy did you choose a university close to home? I actually commuted my first two years, which was best when it came down to cost. But now being on campus, I have the opportunity and flexibility to go home on weekends.\n\nHow do you get that “away” feeling while still being close to home? My involvement on campus has me more involved and focused on what’s going on here, so being close to home isn’t a factor when I’m busy. I make sure I’m out and exploring and discovering new things on campus when I’m here.\n\nWhere’s your favorite place to eat on campus? It’s hard to choose because everything in the Student Center is great but Freshens is always a go-to.\n\nWhat advice do you have for incoming freshmen or transfers? Talk to your resident assistant (RA), even if it seems intimidating. It’s their job to let you know what’s going on and how you can get involved on campus.I’d also encourage them to check out all of the Rowan After Hours events. I didn’t take advantage of them until sophomore year and wish I went from the beginning. The midnight hot bar is worth the trip. For transfers, I would suggest to reconnect with people you know already know to get a better understanding of the ins and outs of campus.\n\nWhat’s the best decision you’ve made since you got to college? I don’t think I have just one. There hasn’t been just one decision that I thought was “it.” That changed everything. So many decisions have equal value that made me who I am and brought me to where I am now. They’re all important, even if it doesn’t seem that way.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\n#PROFspective: Honors Bio Major Drusilla Appiah-kubi Sets Her Sights on Med School\n\nToday we feature Drusilla Appiah-kubi, a Biological Science major, Psychology minor and Honors concentration student wrapping up her junior year. Drusilla is a first-generation college student from Old Bridge, NJ (Middlesex County) who lived in the Townhouses.\n\nAcademic or social clubs you are a part of: I’m the Vice President of the Rowan African Student Association\n\nWhat inspired you to choose your major?\n\nWhen I was little I would babysit my little cousins all the time, and I would play with them all the time until it was nap time. Even though taking care of babies is a pain :), I would always love putting a smile on their faces. I also loved it when I was younger my pediatrician would come to work so lively and energetically. At the end of the appointment, I would always receive a sticker and a lollipop, which always put a smile on my face. This showed me that they truly loved what they do and gave me a huge interest in that field.\n\nWhat would you share with a future student interested in your major?\n\nBeing a Biological Sciences major isn’t easy, especially if your main focus is to go to medical school. One thing I’ve noticed is that if you like chemistry you’re not going to like organic chemistry so much. Every major consists of putting time into studying, but if you plan on majoring in science and going to medical school, you should put a lot of time into studying, be organized, and have friend groups where you guys can all study together.\n\nHow does your field impact the world? What impact would you like to have on the world in your field?\n\nBeing a pediatrician plays an important role in today’s world by taking care of children, making sure they’re well treated and healthy, and that their growth and development are where they should be in age. The kind of impact I’ll like to have on the world in my field is having my own office where kids will come and have fun.\n\nDescribe for us an experience you’ve shared with a Rowan professor in which you felt like you were working with a visionary in your field.\n\nI felt like I was working with a visionary in my field when I attended [one of my professor’s] office hours. I felt like I was able to talk to her and build a great relationship. Exchanging conversations back and forth made me realize that she truly cares for students and is willing to help her students succeed. Over the semester, I told her that I was planning on furthering my education by going to medical school and becoming a pediatrician.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nNicole Cier, senior writing arts major\n\nPhotos courtesy of:\n\nDrusilla Appiah-kubi\n\nSenior Reflects: First-Generation Law & Justice Major Ashley Bermudez-Villacis\n\nToday we feature first-generation senior Ashley Bermudez-Villacis, a Law & Justice major from Lyndhurst, NJ (Bergen County). Before leaving campus due to COVID-19, Ashley lived in the 220 Rowan Blvd Apartments.\n\nCould you tell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes? My favorite moment with a faculty member was this past February with Penny McPherson Myers and Amy Ruymann and the rest of the Flying First committee, preparing for the Annual First Generation Symposium. I had the opportunity to meet everyone, and they helped me practice for my welcome speech that I had the chance to give this year.\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan? Besides all the amazing moments and great friends I made these last four years, my most meaningful personal moment at Rowan was being a part of the club swim team. I had so much fun being a part of a great team that loved to get competitive but also have fun. Swimming was a sport I’ve done since I was very little, and I’m happy I was able to continue it in college.\n\nWhat are your career aspirations, and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations? I plan on working at a prosecutor’s office to eventually become a detective in the SVU unit. My advisor Rachel Budmen was a huge help in guiding me into the right direction. I’m the type of person who has many questions and I was able to get the answers thanks to Rachel.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors? Most importantly I would like to thank my parents and family for always supporting me throughout my college career. As a first-generation student I faced many battles, but I was able to overcome them thanks to my loved ones. I would like to thank my advisor once again for always helping me and make me understand that sometimes plans can change and that’s okay. Lastly I would like to thank my friends I’ve made throughout the years. I had the opportunity to create so many memories that I will forever be grateful for, along with lessons that will help me be a better person in the future.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nSenior Reflects: Early Childhood Education Major Already Making a Difference\n\nMeet Candice Gavin, a first-generation college student, transfer student, commuter and Early Childhood Education and Literacy Studies major from Mount Ephraim, NJ (Camden County). She reflects on her time at Rowan and tells us some of her favorite experiences and where she’s headed to next!\n\nTell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes:\n\n“I would have to say that my favorite experience was tutoring in the Reading Clinic during School Reading Problems and Supervised Clinical for Reading. I would tutor students in reading and writing who were struggling. It was rewarding to see such progress from the students. They would come in struggling and by the time the semester was over they had made great strides. I wasn’t expecting my student to master every topic because it was a short time spent with each other. Knowing that I made a little difference was a great feeling! It was fun to come up with engaging lessons and activities to use. It was just a great way to practice what I have learned and a great feeling to help students.”\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\n“I have had many moments that had a significant meaning to me during my time at Rowan. One of my favorites was when I participated with the Early Childhood Club for the Haunted Student Center. This was where I really connected with a lot of club members and had a lot of fun! We transformed a classroom into a circus theme and children would walk through and have a chance to do different activities. It was nice to have an opportunity to do something for children and have a lot of fun with club members while doing it.”\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\n“I hope to be a kindergarten or first grade teacher. Rowan has given me many opportunities to go out into the field and interact with students and teachers. It was a great way to network and learn hands on. In teaching we can read and study, but you really get the full experience when you are in the classroom actually teaching and working with students.”\n\nShout outs:\n\n“I want to give a shout out to my mom, dad, and sister who have been there since day one. It has been a long ride, but they stuck by my side giving me support and encouragement when I needed it the most! I also want to give a shout out to Brandi White (the former Praxis Lab Coordinator) for helping me during this journey. She was always there as a mentor and friend! My group of friends all deserve a shout out too. They have experienced all the highs and lows of this journey with me too, so thanks for all your help! Lastly, my professors and advisor deserve recognition. They always wanted what was best for me and guided me in the right direction to get to this opportunity. I wouldn’t have made it this far without having the best support system, thank you all!”\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nSenior Reflects: Transfer Political Science Major Finds Her Fit\n\nMeet Morgan Golightly, a first-generation college student, transfer student and commuter from Belmar, NJ (Monmouth County) who just finished her time at Rowan with a Political Science degree.

We learned in depth about the state elections and created online quizzes to help voters find ideal candidates to vote for. This class sparked the moment when I knew that Political Science was the right major for me.”\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\n“My favorite moment at Rowan was at transfer orientation when I made an abundance of new friendships with those of similar majors and goals as myself.”\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\n“With the encouraging words from many professors, I took my LSATS my junior year and am planning on attending law school in the fall of 2021. I hope to be a copyright lawyer while participating in local and state government.”\n\nShout outs:\n\n“I want to thank Harold Thompson, my advisor who helped stay on track. I want to thank the professors that worked with me during some of the hardest times of my life. I want to thank the Gunderson family for their continuous support, love and guidance. I don’t know where I would have ended up without the Gunderson family supporting me through every hardship and struggle.

The best moments were when he would split the class into different teams and we would have little competitions.\n\nExperience with Alpha Chi Rho- Iota Chi Phi Chapter: Over the past couple years, I have been fundraiser, bursar, and postulant educator. My proudest experience was being able to do “Alpha Chi Rhoses,” a yearly fundraiser in which people around the Rowan community can purchase flowers and send notes to each other.

She is from Egg Harbor Township, NJ (Atlantic County). In her time at Rowan she spent half of her time living on campus and the other half in a house off-campus. She reflects on her time at Rowan and tells us some of her favorite experiences and where she’s headed to next!\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\n“I had some trouble when I first came to Rowan figuring out what I wanted to be. I started off as a Civil Engineering major, then I went into Music Education, and eventually Elementary Education and Liberal Studies. It took me a while, but through taking all of these different classes, I was able to realize my passion for education. I want to be an elementary school teacher and, one day, an administrator in a public school district.\n\nThe first professor who helped me realize this passion of mine was Dr. Adrian Barnes in my Music Education classes. He showed me a passion for education that I learned from and took with me in my future education classes and I will forever be grateful for his teachings. My other professors in my Education classes, such as Nancy Pagliughi, Arlene Stampa, and Gary Dentino, are who took that passion I had for teaching and shaped me into a real teacher. I will always remember their teachings when I have a classroom of my own. I would be remiss if I did not also mention my Writing Arts and English professors who helped me realize my talent for writing and showed me how to use that to make me into a better teacher. My professors Keri Mikulski, Dr. Jennifer Courtney, Amanda Haruch, and Dr. Yvonne Hammond, all saw my potential and shaped me into the writer and educator I am today. I have had so many amazing professors at Rowan that have given me knowledge and skills that I will be forever grateful for!”\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\n“My most meaningful moments at Rowan were when I was President of my sorority, Alpha Sigma Alpha. I met so many of my greatest friends there and almost every one of my good memories comes from them. Going to Greek Week, volunteering at the Special Olympics, and recruitment are just a few things that I will always remember and treasure from my time with ASA. My roommates, Rachael, Sara, and Nicole, were with me through three years of being at Rowan and they were the reason I called Rowan my home. Looking back at my time in college in the future, I know I will fondly remember the times I spent with them the most.”\n\nTell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes:\n\n“One memory I have of my experience in the College of Education that I think I will always remember was being in Professor Gary Dentino’s class. Almost every single day, he would email us a whole letter telling us how proud he was of us and how we will change the world. He took the time out of his day to handwrite personal letters to us as a class almost daily. Even when my classes were getting tough and I felt like I was falling behind, I would read his daily email and feel like I truly had someone in my corner. His dedication to forming a positive and uplifting relationship with his students is something I hope to carry with me when I become a teacher someday.”\n\nShout outs:\n\n“I’d like to give a special shoutout to my best friends in the entire world: Sara Riegel, Nicole Traeger, and Rachael Kolmins. Thank you for always being there for me through it all. Another special shoutout to all of my ladies at Alpha Sigma Alpha, especially my big Rosie Nanfara and my little Emily Fishman. Keep on joyously living each day to its ultimate good! Shoutouts to other amazing people I met at Rowan like Hersh and Fraidy Loschak from Chabad at Rowan, Celeste DelRusso and Donna Mehalchick-Opal from the Rowan Writing Center, and all of my fellow Edgewood RAs. Thank you for making a difference in my life! One more shoutout goes to my boyfriend, Mark Kozak, for being my rock throughout my years at Rowan. My biggest thanks will go to my parents, who are the reason that I am where I am.

Justin lived on campus, as a resident assistant at Rowan Boulevard Apartments.\n\nOn-campus Clubs: Alpha Phi Omega (APO) and Rowan University Philippine American Coalition (RUPAC)\n\nCould you share with one happy moment you had with friends, professors or other members of the Rowan community that made you realize Rowan felt like “home”? Alpha Phi Omega is one organization that helped me turn Rowan into a house from a home. As a co-ed service fraternity, I joined for the service, but I stayed for the people. I became a brother in Spring ’17, and I can truly say every experience through the organization has been transformative. Every brother I met became a friendly face that I had the pleasure of getting to know, and these same brothers I met inspired me to hold two Vice President positions, and eventually become President. Completing service projects and being selfless for others releases all those feel-good hormones in your body, but completing them with people you care about truly spikes your serotonin levels.\n\nCould you share a moment you’ve experienced in which you have felt that Rowan is a welcoming environment for you? As transformative as APO has been for me, it was RUPAC that first showed me how welcoming the Rowan community can be. Just like any freshman looking to get involved, I reflected on interests and hobbies I hold close to my identity. Luckily, I came across a flyer in Science Hall advertising RUPAC’s first general body meeting; as a Filipino-American that hasn’t ventured too deep into his Filipino identity, this was a perfect opportunity to do just that.\n\nWhen I arrived at the meeting, I was met with a room full of people that looked just like me, exuding bundles of energy and warm welcomings. They had just met me, but they showed genuine interest in getting to know me almost instantly. Thanks to them, I found a pamilya (family) that I can rely on for just about anything.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing to do on a typical Thursday? Before the pandemic ensued, my absolute favorite thing to do on my typical Thursday was volunteering through Rowan’s Get FIT program. As a pre-Occupational Therapy student, this program helped get my feet wet for the profession. This program brings in young adults with cognitive and physical disabilities seeking to enhance their physical well-being through exercise. The young adults can even work out with their family members as well. During my short time in the program, I had the pleasure of being paired with a nonverbal client that brought joy to my face whenever we met. Seeing him smile from exercises I taught him brought me happiness, and helped reassure me that I was making the right career choice for future.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan that was a happy surprise for you? Coming to Rowan, one happy surprise was realizing how close the campus is to Philly. It was an even better surprise when I learned that Rowan has a free shuttle to Philly every Friday. This allowed me to venture into the city just about every other weekend, learning about different neighborhoods and people of the city. Through different networking opportunities offered by RUPAC, I met incredible people from the Filipino clubs of Philly schools. Ultimately, it was these networking opportunities that helped me decide on attending University of the Sciences in Philadelphia to earn my master’s in Occupational Therapy this upcoming May.\n\nDescribe for us an experience you’ve shared with a professor or staff member in which you felt like they truly cared about your wellbeing. In my third and final year on staff with ResLife, my Resident Director, Bri Vogel, made me feel as though someone truly cared about my wellbeing. As RAs, we have biweekly one-on-one meetings with our Resident Director. These meetings turned into free therapy sessions between Bri and I; she fostered an environment in which we were comfortable sharing personal details about our lives both in and outside of ResLife. Bri was an integral part of my journey in coming to terms with my suffering mental health, and I can’t thank her enough for encouraging me to start counseling through the Wellness Center. When people say that some of the biggest lessons you learn from college come from outside of the classroom, I feel like this small snippet of my four years at Rowan is a true testament to that.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nAlyssa Bauer, senior public relations major\n\nSenior Reflects: Health & Physical Education Medallion Winner Angela Lakatos\n\nToday we speak to Health and Physical Education major Angela Lakatos, a new alumna from Pennsville, NJ (Salem County)!

My group of classmates are so competitive and every class was so much fun!\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan? One of my most meaningful moments was when I was told that I was not only nominated but I was awarded the Cone Award Medallion for Teaching Students with Disabilities. This award means so much to me because I have learned so much from teaching the students with disabilities at my elementary student teaching location and my passion for Health and Physical Education grew even more because of those students.\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations? I hope to become a Health and Physical Education teacher! Every professor has helped me get to where I am today, along with a few of my fellow classmates.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors? Shout out to Professor McCall and Professor Lieberman! These two awesome humans have taught me so much as a future educator. They are the best, and I know that all of my fellow classmates would agree with me on that!!! Also, of course shout out to my parents! If it wasn’t for them, I don’t know where I’d be or what I would be doing. They have always supported me and have been my back bone. I believe I have the best parents in the whole wide world (I might be biased)!!!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, freshman communication studies and public relations double major\n\nSenior Reflects: Kelly Auletto Gives a Shout Out to Favorite Professor\n\nToday we feature senior Kelly Auletto, a Human Services major from Maple Shade, NJ (Burlington County). Kelly transferred to Rowan from Rowan College of Burlington County, and commuted to campus. She is a first generation college graduate.\n\nPlease tell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nI truly enjoyed Prof. McCann’s lectures, she always had us thinking outside of the box. One night during class she had us work as a group drawing the steps to make toast, who knew there were so many steps involved. She had the class laughing and engaged and even with this simple task, she had us thinking on a whole different level. She always pushed us to be our best.\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\nWorking with the Human Services Club, brainstorming ideas and ways to give back to the community. I will miss this amazing group!!\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\nWorking my three field placements during my time at Rowan University has assisted me in my professional development. I was able to move up to a managerial position within my agency and entered a program that I never thought I would if it wasn’t for my field placement. Working as a vocational specialist with adults with mental health has been an amazing experience. Watching my clients grow and become integrated into the community is so rewarding, I am thankfully to have been given this opportunity.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors?\n\nYES… Professor McCann – you have been my rock!!! Thank you for all your support (personal and professional), guidance, words of wisdom and putting up with my insanity. I never would have made it without you. You are an amazing person and thanks for being you. My human service people… I will miss all of you. We did it!!! Thanks to my family for putting up with my never ending journey, love you guys.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nSenior Psychology Major Says Young Son Was “Motivation” For Her Degree\n\nToday we feature Ashley D.
