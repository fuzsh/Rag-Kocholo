        "meta_description": "French postcard by Cinémagazine, no. 238.\n\t\n\t<strong>Jean Forest</strong> (1912-1980) is best remembered for his touching, naturalist and convincing performances as boy actor in the silent French films by Jacques Feyder: Crainquebille, Visages d'enfants and Gribiche.\n\t\n\tJean Forest, born in Paris, Montmartre, was picked up from the streets by Belgian film director Jacques Feyder to debute in his 1922 urban realist French film Crainquebille, based on a story by Anatole France, which reverses the standard orphan plot. Forest plays Mouse (Souris), a young orphan who saves the old vendor Crainquebille (Maurice de Feraudy) from suicide when the latter has been plagued by misunderstandings, prison life, loss of clientele and alcohol. The film was a worldwide success, praised for its naturalistic acting and location shooting (at les Halles). In Visages d'enfants (Feyder, shot in 1923, but released in 1925) Forest, the oldest son of a widower, has problems accepting his new stepmother and her daughter. When he has gone too far in pestering his stepsister he commits suicide by drowning but his stepmother saves his life in the nick of time, causing Jean to accept her. Again the film marked naturalistic acting and authenticity in the location, now the mountain area of the Haut Valois in Switzerland. Unfortunately, the truly touching and beautiful film - a tinted and toned copy was found back at the Netherlands Filmmuseum some years ago and restored, in combination with other existing copies -was no commercial success at the time. One year after, Julien Duvivier's Poil de carotte (1926), a likewise story, obliterated Visages d'enfants. Forest's third film with Feyder was again a big success, even bigger than Crainquebille: Gribiche (1926), all centered around Forest, deals with a boy who consciously accepts to be adopted by a rich American lady, because he knows it will enable his working-class mother to remarry. He cannot get used to the luxurious but empty milieu [sets by Lazare Meerson] though and escapes during the Bastille festivities to his mother and her new husband.\n\t\n\tForest also played in other fillms. He was the young vagabond Claudinet in Les deux gosses (Louis Mercanton 1924) after the classic story by Pierre Decourcelle. One year after he played young Jack in Jack (Robert Saidreau 1925) after the famous novel by Alphonse Daudet. In 1927 he played the lead in Les coeurs héroïques by George Pallu. In the sound era Forest still played in French films, even if it was a limited number: firstly, he played the young Jean Chapelain in Une femme a menti, an early French Paramount sound production (Charles de Rochefort 1930). He performed the title role in Etienne (Jean Tarride 1933); Lt. Drake in La route impériale (Marcel L'Herbier 1935); St. John/Jean in Golgotha (Julien Duvivier 1935); and Jean in Tovaritch (1935) by Jacques Deval and German Fried, though uncredited Victor Trivas and Jean Tarride are also mentioned as co-directors. It was the French version of the much better known American Tovarich with Charles Boyer and Claudette Colbert, released in 1937. After 1935, no more film roles of Forest are known, but he pursued a career in radio. In 1951 for instance, he won ex aequo the first prize in Naples with his radio adaptation of Theophile Gauthier's Une larme du diable , and in 1956 his adaptation of the Jack Perret piece L'examen de calcul won the Prix Italian for literary or dramatic programmes in Rimini.  \n\t\n\tSources: IMDB, French Wikipedia, BiFi, DvdToile.
