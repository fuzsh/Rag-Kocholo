        "text": "As the central figure in the film conception of Victor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" Lon Chaney portrays Quasimodo, the ape-like bellringer of the famed cathedral, as a fearsome, frightful, crooked creature, one eye bulging but blind, knees that interfere, sharp, saw-edged protruding teeth, high, swollen cheek bones and a dented and twisted nose—a \"monstrous joke of nature.\" He gives an unrestrained but remarkable performance in this production, which opened last night at the Astor Theatre, where there gathered familiar faces of the stage and screen, literary lights and men-about-town.Naturally there is much in this picture which is not pleasant any more than the works of Poe, some of Eugene O'Neill's strokes of genius, the stories of Thomas Burke, Stacey Aumonier and many of the masters of the pen in the olden days. It is, however, a strong production, on which no pains or money have been spared to depict the seamy side of old Paris. The \"set\" of the cathedral is really marvelous, having the appearance of stolidity and massiveness, and in sequences looking down from it to the streets below give one a dizzy idea of height. If there were nothing else to see in this film it would be worth while to gaze upon the faithful copy of Notre Dame.The streets of Paris of yesteryear are also well constructed, but if they were not so mudless and dustless they would be more real and less like stage settings.Chaney throws his whole soul into making Quasimodo as repugnant as anything human could very well be, even to decorating his breast and back with hair. He is remarkably agile and impressive when showing his fearlessness for a great height, and the strength of his awful hands by climbing down the facade of the cathedral, and on one occasion down a rope, looking like a mammoth monkey on a stick. And yet in this distorted body there was gratitude, for Esmeralda is carried to sanctuary from the gibbet by this muscular ogre.Undoubtedly the most picturesque person in this photodrama is Clopin, the king of beggars and assassins, a character that Ernest Torrence plays and appears to enjoy. He is introduced several times in the so-called court of miracles, where the halt become nimble and the blind see. Torrence is a commanding figure, seated on a block-like throne, handing down his laws to his hordes.The highest dramatic sequence in this film is where Clopin calls upon his filthy crew to storm the cathedral, and the director. Wallace Worsley, has made this a most telling, inspiring incident. The ragged, half-starved mob comes forth at Clopin's behest from the sewers, the alleys, the underground muckpots and the hovels in which many of them dwell, and, with gathered numbers as they rush along, they charge upon the church with torches, sticks and knives. Quasimodo strains himself lifting heavy granite blocks, which he drops over on the advancing mendicants and murderers, finally hurling a heavy teak beam on the frenzied lot. It pinions four under it when it falls, but unfortunately they seem to be too neat in their fall to be realistic.Eventually this beam is used as a battering ram, and one sees, as if from the cathedral towers, the diligent antlike mortals banging the ram on the oaken portals of the cathedral.Patsy Ruth Miller has the part of Esmeralda, a truly pretty, chubby girl, whose only fault is the over-decorating of her upper lip, which was too perfectly \"bowed.\" However, her acting is unusually good in the many difficult scenes in which she has to appear. Her paramour. Captain Phoebus, is capably portrayed by Norman Kerry.Louis XI, is played by the careful Tully Marshall, who makes every scene in which he appears count for something.Throughout this drama there is one humorous sequence—one which is pictured in an interesting manner. It is where Quasimodo appears before the court for kidnapping Esmeralda. The Judge is deaf, but is too proud to admit it. The hunchback doesn't care a rap about his similar affliction and admits it. The prisoner says one thing, and the Judge, not understanding a single word, pretends to have heard, forthwith ordering Quasimodo to be flogged with twenty lashes.There are a number of changes, obviously necessary, which have been made in this adaptation. The story is subservient to the atmosphere and the acting. It is merely that a girl befriended Quasimodo when he was arrested for a nocturnal attack, inspired by the wicked brother of the Archdeacon. She is arrested finally herself, accused of having stabbed Captain Phoebus, with whom she was in love, and is saved by the hideous bell-ringer. However, the film holds the interest because of the excellent acting and \"sets\" and the splendid atmosphere throughout the drama. True, the cast has certain weaknesses, but they are not obtrusive. It is a drama which will appeal to all those who are interested in fine screen acting, artistic settings and a remarkable handling of crowds who don't mind a grotesque figure and a grim atmosphere.The new Harold Lloyd production, which is holding forth this week at the Strand, contains a number of new and absurdly farcical bits of \"business.\" The film is called \"Why Worry?\" In it Lloyd has enlisted the support of a formidable giant, whose height and beam is in itself a huge laugh, seeing that he is contrasted in every scene with Lloyd, who appears like one of the Lilliputians with a great Gulliver for a pal.To give the spectators an idea of the size of this man—Johan Aasen—Jobyna Ralston, who officiates as Lloyd's faithful and loving nurse, ties her wrist watch around his stalwart thumb.Lloyd is Harold Van Pelham, a wealthy hypochondriac who goes to Paradise, somewhere in Mexico, in search of quiet. The place is pictured as a spot where the inhabitants would look upon Rip Van Winkle's slumbering period as a nap, and where the moths had gathered in the rifles of the insurrectionists because they have been peaceful so long.Van Pelham is mistaken for a spy from an American business concern, so that when he asks the way to his hotel he is told to follow the squad of soldiers in the street, to whom the Captain explains that Van Pelham is to be thrown into prison. Lloyd is very amusing as he walks along in the midst of the corporal's guard, shaking hands with one soldier after another, thanking them, then mischievously pulling the trigger of a gun. He is locked up, to his utter dismay, and in the same cell he discovers Colosse, whom the soldiers have only managed to get into prison because he is suffering from tooth ache.Van Pelham escapes through the window, with the assistance of Colosse, and Colosse, after crumbling the walls of the structure, emerges himself, ready to attack all the troops. A cannon is tied to his back and the soldiers are driven back, and those who have not been swift enough Colosse bangs on the ground until they are unconscious. The ammunition gives out, when the hotel is stormed by the Paradise reserves, and thereupon Colosse puffs smoke through the empty barrel and blows huge cocoanuts on the uniformed men with amusing effect. Van I'elham gains the gratitude of the giant by managing to extricate the painful molar. The sequences dealing with this dentistry are brimful of fun, especially when Van Pelham weights himself down with ballast to make a final heave at the tooth, only to discover when he falls that it has already been pulled.This is a swift-moving production, Just as good as any in which Harold Lloyd has ever appeared.\"Bill,\" which is Anatole France's \"Crainquebille,\" was shown privately the other day, and now is enjoying the honor of sharing the Rivoli screen with \"Salomy Jane,\" in which Jacqueline Logan has the principal rôle. But in this review we will deal only with the wonderful character sketch delivered by Maurice de Feraude. The film, only three reels, was bought in Paris by Hugo Riesenfeld, and he deserves much credit for his enthusiasm about this poetic little story, which reminds one a good deal of O. Henry's \"The Cop and the Anthem.\"One sees the old pushcart man, Crainquebille, going happily through the streets, selling his vegetables, bought at Les Halles. He encounters a fiery policeman, who orders him to move on. Crainquebille explains that he is waiting for payment from a woman in a shoe shop. Crainquebille mumbles something to the effect that he is not a fathead. \"Whereupon the policeman accuses him of calling an officer of the law a fathead.\"I said 'fathead' because you said 'fathead.' That's why I said 'fathead,'\" he says to the man in blue.He is shown in prison and in court, where the lawyer assigned to him is pondering over the racing sheet, and he is convicted. Examined by the prison doctor, he receives medicine, and laughs at the idea. When he finally takes a spoonful and then drinks half the bottle, de Feraude's acting is excellent. He finds his customers have forsaken him on coming out of prison, and finally one rainy night he seeks his end in the Seine, but is stopped from jumping into the dark, swirling waters by a little boy to whom he had given a pear before he had seen the inside of a prison. He had resolved that jail was more comfortable than wet streets, and deliberately went up and called an agent de police a \"fathead.\" This policeman refuses to arrest him, declaring that he would have his hands full if he took into custody all those who insulted him.Given comforts by the little boy, and sharing his cigarette, old Crainquebille says:\"Young man, it may mean nothing to the French Republic, but you have saved an old man's life.\"This is a beautiful, simple production, with an inspiring actor in the title rôle.Other Photoplays.\"The French Doll,\" with Mae Murray, is the feature this week at the Capitol.Pola Negri in \"The Cheat\" has been held over at the Rivoli for a second week.\"The Silent Command,\" a story of the United States Navy, opened last night at the Central Theatre.\"If Winter Comes\" will be presented tonight at the Times Square Theatre.\"Rosita,\" with Mary Pickford, will open this evening at the Lyric Theatre.\n\nThe Hideous Bell-Ringer.THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, with Lon Chaney.
