        "text": "\"Les Deux Timides\" (1928) aka \"Two Timid Souls\"\n\nAn Albatross Film produced by Alexander Kamenka at the Gaumont Studios in Billancourt, France.\n\nDirected by Rene Clair\n\nBased on a play by Eugene Labiche\n\nRunning time of 62 minutes when released in 1928.\n\nThe cast includes Pierre Batcheff, Jim Gerald, Vera Flory, Maurice de Feraudy and Yvette Andreyor.\n\nThe Story\n\n\"Les Deux Timides\" revolves around petit-bourgeois puppet characters consisting of a young marriageable daughter, a timid wooer, his blustering rival and a complacent father-in-law.\n\nOur story begins with Fremissin (Pierre Batcheff), a timid young lawyer, pleading his first case and attempting to defend his client, burly wife beater Garadoux (Jim Gerald). Garadoux was charged with beating his wife, trashing his dingy apartment when he had returned to his sparse, dingy home after having one too many drinks.\n\nLawyer Fremission gives the court the version of the incident that he was given by Garadoux in which Garadoux states that he had actually returned home and, kissing his wife, he gave her a bouquet of flowers. He then entertained her with a violin concerto. Fremission repeats the story over and over again and bores all of the spectators in the court including the judges. Then chaos occurs when a mouse runs through the court room. Garadoux is none too pleased with his lawyer's defense and constantly interrupts the proceedings which annoys the judges and amuses the court spectators. Fremission, thoroughly confused by the proceedings, pleads to the court that his client should be given all of the sternness of the court. The judges give Garadoux three months in jail, and he angrily attempts to beat Fremission until he is set upon by the spectators and Fremission's aunt who is one of the spectators.\n\nTwo years go by, and Fremission, who is still timid, is courting a timid young lady, Cecile Thibaudier (Vera Flory), who lives in the countryside. Garadoux, now a widower, has made the small town his home, and, having seen Cecile, he arranges to encounter her wealthy father, Mr. Thibaudier (Maurice de Feraudy) outside a commercial building. Garadoux gives Thibaudier the impression that he owns the building. The persistent Garadoux gets himself invited to Thibaudier's home to court Cecile, and, glancing out of a window, he sees Fremission approaching the house, who also is coming to court Cecile.\n\nGaradoux recognizes Fremission as his incompetent lawyer who bungled his case and had him serve three months in jail. Realizing that Fremission is also courting Cecile, he begins a campaign to frighten Fremission. Garadoux, wearing a mask, surprises Fremission on a lonely road in the vicinity where Cecile lives. Fremission receives a letter that his life will be in jeopardy if ventures out of town. A Mack Sennett chase for Cecile's hand begins with the timid lawyer being constantly foiled by the blustery Garadoux. Fremission has to decide if Cecile's hand is worth the danger.\n\nThe Director and Actors\n\nRene Clair (1898-1981), born Rene Chomette, was one of the great French directors, and his films had a certain \"Frenchess\" about them -- light, witty and elegant -- and they ranged from farce to sentimental comedy. With the play writer, Eugene Labiche, he produced two Labiche farces, \"The Italian Straw Hat\" (1925) and \"The Two Timid Souls.\"\n\nJim Gerald (1889-1958), born Gerald Cuenot, was a popular stage actor before entering films in 1923 and made films in France, Italy and Hollywood. His last screen appearance was in 1957, and a few of his silent films are available including \"The Italian Straw Hat\" and \"An Imaginary Voyage.\" He appeared in over 60 films during the sound era, and a few of his English films are available including \"The Barefoot Contessa\" (1954) and \"Father Brown\" (1957).\n\nMaurice de Feraudy was a very popular stage actor with the Comedie and made his film debut in \"Crainquebille\" (1922) based upon a story by Anatole France. He appeared in eight feature films during his career, and his last screen appearance was in 1929.\n\nPierre Batcheff (1901-1932), was one of the outstanding actors of early French avant-garde cinema during the mid-to-late 1920s. His best-known films include Gance's \"Napoleon\" (1927) and Clair's \"Les Deux Timides\" (1928), but he is still most famous for playing the main character in Bunuel and Dali's classic art film \"Un Chien Andalou\" (1929).\n\nThe video includes French and German titles with an English translation and a running time of 87 minutes\n\ncopyright 2001 by John DeBartolo.
