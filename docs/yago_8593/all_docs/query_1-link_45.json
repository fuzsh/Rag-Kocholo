        "text": "An ageing Parisian vegetable peddler gets caught in the cogs of a corrupt legal system after resisting attempts by a policeman to move him on from his pitch of 40 years in Les Halles. After serving his prison sentence, he is shunned by his regular customers and falls into poverty and alcoholism. Contemplating suicide, he is saved by the intervention of young newspaper seller who encourages him to make a fresh start and forget the past. Based on a short story by Anatole France, the film is noted for its realistic depiction of the life of the poor in Paris.\n\nLive musical accompaniment by Meg Morley.\n\nThis programme is presented as part of Opening Up the Magic Box, a heritage element of Film 2021 which marks the centenary of the death of Bristol-born film pioneer William Friese-Greene and the 125th anniversary of the first public cinema screening in Bristol, which took place at the Tivoli on 8 June 1896, as well as celebrating Bristol – a UNESCO City of Film since 2017. It is generously funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.\n\nIt is part of a new season of screenings celebrating early Parisian cinema in collaboration with South West Silents and Arnolfini.\n\nBooking Information\n\nBooking is via the Arnolfini box office. If you’re unable to book online we aim to keep a number of spaces available on the day, please speak to a member of staff on arrival. Should you need assistance, we have a priority entry system in place.\n\nKeeping Everyone Safe\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming more people into Arnolfini. However, we appreciate that the number of covid infections, particularly in Bristol, remain high at the present time and it remains our priority that everyone wanting to visit Arnolfini can do so with confidence and feel safe, this includes considering the needs of disabled and clinically vulnerable. For events taking place in our theatre, places will be limited, seating will be distanced, and face coverings are requested to be worn, to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19.\n\nOur team will continue to wear face coverings and we ask you do so too, particularly to consider those who have disabilities or are clinically vulnerable.\n\nAt Arnolfini Harbourside Bar, customers will be asked to continue to wear face coverings while moving around the Bar, both inside and out. The team will continue to wear face coverings too.\n\nWe have reduced the maximum capacity to make your visit safe and more comfortable.\n\nWe have extra sanitising and cleaning facilities in high touch point areas. Hand sanitising stations can be found throughout the building. Please use sanitiser provided on entry to the building.\n\nWe will be reviewing this regularly based on infection rates in Bristol and beyond and remain committed to creating a safe environment for all our visitors and community friends. We hope to be able to increase capacity as and when the situation allows. We really appreciate your cooperation with this policy.\n\nIf you have any symptoms of Covid-19, are self-isolating or have been contacted in accordance with the track and trace system, please do not enter the building. All members of our team are checked accordingly too.\n\nArnolfini have been awarded We’re Good to Go certification from Visit England. For more information about the accreditation and scheme please visit www.visitbritain.org/were-good-go-industry-standard-all-sectors-tourism-industry\n\nAccessibility\n\nOur lifts are reserved for users with accessibility needs only. We ask everyone else to use the stairs for which there are social distancing measures in place. Please check no one is using the stairs before you go either up or down. Please be aware of those who may need assistance and avoid using the handrail where possible."
