        "text": "Mercedes de Acosta was eager to write a script for Greta. One day Thalberg gave his okay and some time later she gave him her finished script, titled Desperate.\n\nThe heroine is a confused soul named Erik Chandler. Her father (Sloane) is an American diplomat living in Paris; divorced from her mother (Erika), who was the daughter of the Norwegian ambassador to the Russian Imperial Court. As the story begins, Erik is going home to be with her mother on her eighteenth birthday. Her father delays her departure and her distraught mother, believing she has been deserted, jumps into the nearest fjord (hanging on just long enough to die in Erik's arms).\n\nA vengeful Erik begins her reckless adult life. She is beautiful, polished, arrogant, wild and now irrevocably estranged from her father. When her companion, Toto, is killed in a club in Harlem, Erik disguises herself as a boy to avert a scandal and leaves town.\n\nA scripted montage shows Erik transforming herself into a boy, and winds up in a swank gambling club in Mexico City, dressed in perfect evening clothes, her hair brushed straight back, her face a mask. She is a subject of interest among the feminine gamblers. Each woman feels there is some unfathomable mystery in this beautiful, pale, Shelley-like boy that no one can move to talk. Her eyes rarely leave the game, she has never been seen to smile and is indifferent to the others around him. Everyone wonders about him but her luck has changed.\n\n“Once I was afraid to be alone with myself, now I no longer have that fear – and I am not lonely – ever”, Erik says.\n\nShe is last seen in Wyoming as a “pretty new cowboy” able to tame wild horses and men. An old lover reappears, and Erik wins a dramatic life-and-death struggle at the rodeo with the fiercest black stallion this side of the Mississippi. Irving Thalberg turned Desperate down. He thought it sounded too uncommercial and preferred to do Luigi Pirandello's play As You Desire Me with Garbo next.\n\nA project considered for Garbo after As You Desire Me was based on a novel by Elinor Glyn (1864 – 1943). Glyn was a British novelist and scriptwriter who pioneered mass-market women's erotic fiction. She was the celebrated author of early 20th century bestsellers such as It, Three Weeks, Beyond the Rocks, and other novels which were considered quite racy, as tame as they might seem now.\n\nA silent film was made of Three Weeks in 1924 starring Aileen Pringle and Conrad Nagel. Why Garbo never made the film is unknown.\n\nThe plot: The Queen of Sardalia is in a bad marriage with the brutal King Constantine II. She decides to get away and goes on vacation to Switzerland. Here, she meets Paul Verdayne and they have an affair for three weeks.\n\nIcelandic Nobel laureate Halldór Laxness particularly liked Garbo and wanted her to play Salka Valka\n\nSalka Valka was Laxness's breakthrough novel and reflected the Socialistic views of his novels in the 1930s and 1940s. The story depicted a young woman, Salka, and a small fishing community. Evil enters into the town in the form of merchants and fishing entrepreneurs and is pitted against labor movement. The book gained a huge success in England and the The Evening Standard wrote that Greta Garbo would be the perfect Salka in its film adaptation.\n\nMGM showed interest in one of his \"magnificent\" scripts (Sakja Valka) that \"will conquer the world\" – about a silent, erotic, pipe-smoking, whip-wielding woman who becomes a ship's captain, whom he imagined being played by Garbo. When the studio wanted to move the setting from Iceland to Kentucky, he threw in the towel. \"Here it is not possible to do anything with genius. What they ask for is idiocy.\""
