        "text": "French critic Anatole France, pen name of Jacques Anatole François Thibault wrote sophisticated, often satirical short stories and novels, including Penguin Island (1908), and won the Nobel Prize of 1921 for literature.\n\nAnatole France began his career as a poet and a journalist. From 1867, he as a journalist composed articles and notices.\n\nIn 1869, Le Parnasse Contemporain published La Part de Madeleine of his poems. In 1875, he sat on the committee in charge of the third such compilation. He moved Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé aside.\n\nSkeptical old scholar Sylvester Bonnard, protagonist of famous Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard (1881), embodied own personality of the author. The academy praised its elegant prose.\n\nAnatole France in La Rotisserie de la Reine Pedauque (1893) ridiculed belief in the occult and in Les Opinions de Jerome Coignard (1893) captured the atmosphere of the fin de siècle.\n\nPeople elected him to the Académie française in 1896.\n\nPeople falsely convicted Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish army officer, of espionage. Anatole France took an important part in the affair, signed manifesto of Émile Zola to support Dreyfus, and authored Monsieur Bergeret in 1901.\n\nAfter the nearsighted Abbot Mael baptized the animals in error, France in later work depicts the transformation into human nature in 1908.\n\nPeople considered most profound La Revolte des Anges (1914). It tells of Arcade, the guardian angel of Maurice d'Esparvieu. Arcade falls in love, joins the revolutionary movement of angels, and towards the end recognizes the meaningless overthrow of God unless \"in ourselves and in ourselves alone we attack and destroy Ialdabaoth.\"\n\nPeople awarded him \"in recognition of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a nobility of style, a profound human sympathy, grace, and a true Gallic temperament\" in 1921.\n\nIn 1922, the Catholic Church put entire works of France on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Index of Prohibited Books).\n\nHe died, and people buried his body in the Neuilly-sur-Seine community cemetery near Paris."
