        "text": "An good example of French satirical fiction from Anatole France, atmospheric paintings typical of Bernard Lamotte’s work, and fine book design by the Heritage Press, are all packed into this slim volume.\n\nHeritage Press; 1949; xiii, 69pp; 4to (285x225x18mm); 0.97kg; quarter bound in buckram with marbled paper sides; in plain maroon slipcase; black and white illustrations throughout.\n\nThe Limited Editions Club published Anatole France’s 1901 short satirical tale, Crainquebille, as part of its nineteenth series in 1949. Not unusually, this signed, limited edition was also reproduced in a more affordable standard edition by the Heritage Press. Here, I’ll be taking a look at this Heritage Press edition, which packs a lot of book design into a svelte 69 page volume.\n\nThe book is presented in a relatively basic maroon slipcase. It is quarter bound in a coarse, natural buckram with sides covered in a red marbled paper. The spine of the volume bears the title in a red stylised script that matches the title page. Interestingly, the Limited Editions Club tried, and rejected, several designs for the title text before the serendipitously discovering that Bernard Lamotte had hand-painted “Crainquebille” on the front of the folio containing his illustrations. The illustrator’s script was thus appropriated for the purpose of titling the book. The binding is sewn and all three exposed page edges are stained maroon.\n\nSet by Eugene A. Clauss, the text is Monotype Garamont in a substantial 18pt size that quickly fills the large pages. Even the low page count, therefore, deceptively overstates the book’s length. The text manages to remain elegant despite its size. Each chapter begins with a simple italicised title and a drop cap in an accent colour. As for the paper, it’s a very heavy, matte but smooth stock that is quite luxurious, highly opaque, and gives the whole volume a premium feel.\n\nAnyone familiar with the George Macy Companies’ postwar output of French literature should not be too surprised to learn that Crainquebille was illustrated by Paris-native Bernard Lamotte. The illustrations are monochrome, but bring Lamotte’s characteristic expressiveness and, much like his illustrations for Carlyle’s The French Revolution present an atmospheric and sympathetic portrait of the ordinary people of Paris. There are sixteen illustrations in total, including the frontispiece.\n\nThe LEC found extant translations to be wanting. We are thus presented with an original translation by Jacques LeClercq, who also provides a short introduction. The brief story is a satire of society and justice. Our simple protagonist, Jérôme Crainquebille finds himself at the mercy of a seemingly irrational legal process. This is not the dark satire of Kafka, who torments his protagonists with oppressive bureaucracy. Rather, this is a light-hearted tale of society’s processes viewed—with much bewilderment—from the outside, somewhat in the vein of Voltaire’s Candide.\n\nThe book ends with a colophon page that bears a few details of its production. ■\n\nWhere to buy\n\nYou can search for this edition on eBay US*, eBay UK*, AbeBooks US*, and AbeBooks UK*.\n\n* denotes an affiliate link"
