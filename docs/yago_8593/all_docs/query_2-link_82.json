        "text": "It’s been a good while since I’ve written here. Nothing in my placid life seemed to justify a blog. What follows, then, is a meandering miscellany intended to keep my hand in.\n\nThere was, of course, our political roller coaster, about which I have plenty to say, but nothing that hasn’t been said already, many times over. It was certainly a popular topic on Facebook. One fellow posted so much vitriol that at last I had to unfriend him. He was a student of John’s, so I hated to do it, (to say nothing of how it feeds my vanity to have a large number of friends), but each day, his snide mockery of people I respect made me feel bad. He had to go.\n\nLosing a virtual friend was compensated by gaining two actual friends, neighbors who stopped to admire the garden and stayed to chat. Possessed of wit and charm, they encouraged me to drop in for a glass of wine. I knew they were serious the next day when a bottle of good wine and a sweet note appeared at my door. It seems this geezer still has it.\n\nThen there was the exasperating ending of this season on Professor T. The writers killed off my favorite character, played by the beauteous and talented Emma Naomi. It’s such a cliche to have the grim reaper nip an endearing romance in the pre-nuptial bud. This is becoming a predictable and unwelcome staple of detective series.\n\nEmma Naomi\n\nI was so annoyed that I felt like writing the station to vent my displeasure. What a treat it had been to look at Naomi’s pretty and expressive features. Her eyes and slight smile conveyed that she knew what you were up to but didn’t especially mind.\n\nEmma Naomi is just the sort of girl I had crushes on all the way through college. Yes, I had straight crushes until I finally sorted out the life I actually had to live.\n\nShe’s still there to be savored in Bridgerton where again she’s my favorite character. I heartily wish her the fulfilling career she deserves. Let’s get that slyly seductive face up on the big screen.\n\nOne of my very favorite films has always been Carnival in Flanders or, in the original French, La Kermisse Heroique. Thanks to a striking poster, I now know the Swedes called it Hertigen onskar Natikvarten.\n\n“Carnival” is beautifully acted, especially by its illustrious lead, Francoise Rosay, wife of the gifted director, Jacques Feyder. It is also brilliantly designed by Lazare Meersen whose sets echo many fine old Flemish paintings. Full justice is done to these clever sets by the shrewd cinematography of Harry Stradling who, after a number of films with Feyder, had great success in America, culminating, to my mind, in his powerful work on A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\nI mention these contributors to the whole because each brings a sensibility that sharpens the enjoyment of this delicious movie. I must note one more, the costume designer, Georges Benda. His cunning outfits, particularly for the women, are both apt and amusing.\n\nOnce, as I was leaving England, I found a DVD of “Carnival.” I snapped it up, but back in the states, I discovered it could only be played in Europe. Fudge.\n\nI had to have the poster when it was offered at auction, but what came turned out to be too big for my changeable frame, unlike previous Swedish posters, which I love for their graphics. I thought I’d just store it away and take it out to admire from time to time, but gradually I decided it deserved a frame of its own, despite my lack of wall space.\n\nI went with Lois to Michael’s, where we have great confidence in the woman who heads the framing department. The poster excited her, and she offered a number of suggestions, some, of course, more costly than the poster itself. I pondered the lot until Lois gave her usual sensible advice, “Which will bring you joy?” Naturally, it was the most expensive of them all.\n\nA week or so later, Tim, renowned in the region for his expert hanging of anything, went with me to pick up both that frame and a much smaller one of a piece of sheet music for “It’s Magic,” the one song I’d like my friends to play after I’m gone. Ann knew how much I liked it, and imported it from London.\n\nMagical Doris.\n\nThe girl who waited on us looked at my name and said, “Did you teach at Washington High?” I did. She grew quite animated and said, “I didn’t have you, but my best friend did. He still talks about how much he loved your class. He bought your book! Do you mind if I take your picture? He’ll be so excited.” I didn’t mind; in fact, it made my day.\n\nOnce home, I helped Tim move some tables and bric-a-brac away from the wall where the poster would hang, and what should we discover but a small dead mouse. Hmmm.\n\nI’d been afraid that the large frame would overwhelm the space, and I hated to lose any of the desert scene on the walls. By positioning it off to the side and nestled by a palm tree, Tim found the perfect spot for it. It looks as though it always belonged there.\n\nWelcome to my lair, “Hertigen.” By any name, you have a place in my home and my heart.\n\nAnytime I’ve been prescribed prednisone, I’ve known I was in for a good ride for at least a few days. Some people don’t tolerate it well, but I’m not one of them.\n\nRecently, thanks to an abscessed and painful tooth, I was put on prednisone to speed the healing. Once again, I awoke at 8:00, not 10:00 or 12:00. I was refreshed and actually ready to leave happy bedland. Not only that, I was ready to tackle long neglected chores of the “I’ll get to that sometime” variety. I cleaned out the fridge, checking use by dates, and tossing mystery packages. I packed up a hefty bag of clothes for goodwill. I vacuumed the Garden of Allah. On prednisone, sometime is now.\n\nThis pharmaceutical gift of extra energy coincided with my 87th birthday. I never expected to be this old. It helped considerably to have some pep to see me through the door of dotage.\n\nI awoke to a sunny day of cards, calls, and texts of good wishes from seemingly everyone I know. I set out for a long, bright walk without a sweater or jacket. I got to pet Midnight, my favorite dog. The cosmos was conspiring to make me happy and keep me so.\n\nThat evening, Tim and Lois spirited me off to Gamba, my favorite restaurant. The place holds a certain glamor for me, so I dressed up a bit. Josh, the best waiter in the multiverse, steered us through course after sumptuous course, beginning with silky smooth oysters. The handsome couple at the next table turned out to be friends I hadn’t seen in ages. It was their anniversary, so there were celebrations and warm camaraderie all around. Josh produced a cake with a towering pyrotechnic, and when we were through lingering over coffee, we took up loitering. I was in a glow as we closed the place.\n\nMy explosive dessert, thanks to Josh.\n\nI had eaten cautiously, humoring my errant tooth, but day by day, it eased, and my sense of well being expanded. Steve and Johnnie were there when I awoke the next morning, and their easy company was an ongoing pleasure for the next few days.\n\nPrednisone reminded me of how good it is simply to move through your day with energy and without pain. I wish as much for all of you.\n\nI toast your health!\n\nIn the words of an erstwhile radio sponsor, “Good health to all from Rexall.”\n\nI’ve been going back to the movies pretty fearlessly of late. In the past fortnight, I’ve seen three of the pictures people are talking about. Being a people, I herewith talk.\n\nTim and I thought Mission Impossible, whatever its current sequel number, might be worth seeing in IMAX. Indeed it was. Yes, there is a talky opening scene that could give you the giggles with what they are all spouting, but once these gasbags are gassed, (literally), “Mission” roars off at top speed where it remains to the very end.\n\nMission Impossible Poster\n\nI’m not a fan of mindless car chases, but the action scenes here are so artfully contrived that my interest never flagged. The motorcycle cliff jump pays off beautifully, and the bridge dangling Orient Express sequence is quite simply thrilling. It builds and builds until you think it can’t top itself, and then it does. I haven’t seen anything as seat gripping since Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nAfter all this time, no one is to blame or praise for anything that happens in this franchise, but Tom Cruise. He knows what he wants, and he knows what he’s doing. The plots are pipe dreams, but Cruise makes a pact with the audience. “Suspend your disbelief, and I’ll give you a three ring circus joyride that you’ll never forget.”\n\nHis eye for detail extends to feminine beauty and the talent behind it. Both Rebecca Ferguson and Hayley Atwell have faces that would have ruled in Hollywood’s golden age, and the skills to make you care about them in this sea of fictional nonsense. Cruise himself is older, but we should all age as he has. His physical appearance and athletic skills are “picture in the attic” stuff. He is our Douglas Fairbanks Sr.\n\nThis iteration of Mission Impossible, like its predecessors, hasn’t a serious idea in its head. It aims only to distract and entertain. Yet, given this level of craft, creativity, and polish, it rises to movie making at its best. So, A for attaboy.\n\nNext was Barbie, which I saw with Darlene, my fashion consultant. Thanks to Greta Gerwig, Barbie has a head stuffed with serious ideas. Seeing it unprepared would be like sitting down to a banana split, only to discover that under the banana are a medley of nutritious vegetables and fiber. America Ferrera, in particular, delivers a speech that powerfully conveys the curse of being a woman with even half a brain in your head.\n\nStill, the banana on top doesn’t disappoint. The sets and costumes have the most cheerful pink and turquoise sheen imaginable. You want to hitch rides in Barbie’s car, her boat, her plane. Just don’t bang your head on the water in her pool.\n\nThen there’s Ken. Quite a few of him actually. Poor neglected Ken. Barbie is repulsed by his clueless advances. A trip to the real world inspires him to attempt a coup in Barbieland, but of course, the Barbies are too smart for him.\n\nThe movie has a split personality, and tries to divert two quite different audiences. Mostly, it succeeds. Little girls will like what they see, and adults will be amused by what they hear. At one point, the various Kens are quarreling about which of them does best the only thing they do well – beach (for them, it’s a verb). The resulting face off suggests to the jaded ear the prospect of an epic Mattel circle jerk. And Barbie’s final line, one for the ages really, might need some explaining to very young viewers.\n\nMargot Robbie is a restrained dream as Barbie. There hasn’t been as earnest a portrayal of a cartoon character since Shelley Duvall played Olive Oyl in Popeye. Ryan Gosling is just whom you’d want as Ken, and Rhea Perlman has a lovely cameo as Barbie’s creator. So, I’ll give Barbie a B for better than you might expect.\n\nFinally, Tim and I were back at IMAX for Oppenheimer. Full disclosure, I had gotten up at what seemed like crack of middle of the night for other errands, and felt under-slept as we got to the theater. I’ve never changed my opinion of a movie so drastically while I watched it. The first two hours (it’s a long watch) I alternately nodded off in boredom or hated what I snapped awake to see. Tim told me I missed some enjoyable but gratuitous full frontal nudity and a suicide.\n\nChristopher Nolan is a show off. He serves himself first and his subject second. You must be made aware this is a movie by Nolan, so he does things that John Ford or Howard Hawks would never stoop to. He employs a slice and dice form of editing so that you’re given brief ribbons of alternating scenes, now color, now black and white, now the present, now a flashback, and you are expected to stitch them together in your head to form a cogent narrative. In my sleep deprived state, this was impossible, but Tim, who was wide awake and alert, found the editing similarly exasperating. It also didn’t help that much of the dialogue was tamped down to a whisper.\n\nThen, about two thirds of the way in, Nolan stops hot dogging. It’s as though someone grabbed him and said, “If you don’t put down that scissors, we won’t have a picture.” Scenes lengthen, to accommodate anyone with an attention span, and a meaningful and involving story emerges.\n\nI can’t imagine the actors are happy with Nolan’s fragmenting of their efforts. Cillian Murphy gives us the multi-faceted complexity of Oppenheimer’s troubled genius. Emily Blunt is well cast as his stressed out wife, and Gary Oldman has a telling, nasty bit as Truman, once more disappearing into a well known character as he did with Churchill in Darkest Hour. The real surprise here though, is Robert Downey Jr. as Oppenheimer’s nemesis. It’s a masterful job that I didn’t Know he had in him. Shame on me.\n\nSo, overall, I’d say this is indeed worth seeing, (though there’s no need for IMAX), particularly if you can arrive late. I rate it C for Can you stop running with scissors?\n\nTwo of my greatest pleasures remain reading and listening. Most days, all it takes to keep me sane and civil is a good book or some good music. Currently, I have both, thanks to a pair of formidable women, each a master of her art.\n\nThe best program I know about serious music, (admittedly not a huge number), is Bill McGlaughlin’s nightly Exploring Music. He achieves a persuasive intimacy that makes me stop what I’m doing, sit down, and consider the piece or composer he’s extolling. Last week, each night was devoted to the pupils of the most sought after authority on musical composition, Nadia Boulanger.\n\nBoulanger’s influence on American composers was especially powerful. At the end of World War I, France was keenly mindful of the role the U.S. had played with troops, arms and funds. As a gesture of gratitude, a French school for American musicians was set up, with Boulanger as one of its founders. Among the first of her students was the young Aaron Copland, whose career she helped establish. She continued to guide and shape American music for the rest of her life.\n\nI was aware of Boulanger as an important influence, but had never troubled to explore the nature of that influence and find out why so many of the twentieth century’s greatest composers and conductors flocked to her door for guidance and inspiration. By the end of last week, it was clear that the list of those who had not done so would be a short one.\n\nAnd so, I bought a book, a wonderful book, Nadia Boulanger: A Life in Music, by Leonie Rosenstiel. I’m not even halfway through, (this is not an experience to be rushed), but already, I’m fascinated by her youthful brilliance and determination against obstacles that included an imperious, Russian stage mother, and the mysogyny of the male musical world of the time. Her chief nemesis and detractor, Camille St. Saens, wrote scores that burst with glorious melody. Samson and Delilah and his organ concerto are great favorites of mine, but what a backward thinking, sexist curmudgeon! This book convinces me he’d have voted for Trump. Ah, the conundrum of separating the creator from the work (but I can).\n\nIt also convinces me that I’d have loved to have lived in Montmartre in the late nineteenth century. How it teems with life, and how vividly Rosenstiel renders it. I have a great read behind and ahead of me.\n\nBoulanger is gone, but the second woman keeping me in good spirits is alive and kicking two shapely legs high in the air. Gunhild Carling is a jill of all trades, but a master of every one.\n\nGunhild Carling\n\nA Swedish dynamo, she sings, dances, and plays more instruments than I care to list, (mostly brass). She travels the world with her son and daughter as part of her band, and has an enthusiastic fan base, propelled by her success on Swedish television.\n\nThe woman knows her music in and out, as well she might, growing up in a family of vaudevillians equally adept at multiple instruments, dance, rope tricks and juggling. There’s a marvelous video of a one woman performance in Norway, where she entertains with what amounts to a master class on trombone styles, from Jack Teagarden to Trummy Young. At one point, she provides perfect percussion accompaniment by tap dancing.\n\nHer energy is boundless, but not overbearing in the manner of, say, Betty Hutton. Instead, it is infectious. I defy you to watch one of her videos, (Plenty are there to be googled) without tapping your feet and grinning.\n\nDid I mention she is also a stylish clothes horse? Polka dots and florals become her, but what wouldn’t? I have Judy Carmichael’s Jazz Inspired program to thank for my discovery of Gunhild Carling. Where have you been all my life, you potent antidote to the blues?\n\nMany years ago, at the dawn of time, a pretty nineteen-year-old named June got married to a handsome fellow named Gene. To save on expenses until they could afford to buy a home of their own, they moved into the upstairs apartment at 8039 Manistee, in Chicago.\n\nThe floor below was occupied by my dad, my grandmother, my little brother – and me. For three years, the happy couple lived above us. They had two children, and at times baby sat for the brats below. The upstairs was not large, certainly not large enough for what would become a family of six. Eventually, they moved out, and we Kingsmills were sorry to see them go, for they were a sweet, funny, cheerful couple. That was sixty-eight years ago, and we hadn’t seen them since.\n\nGene is gone. He passed away this year, but June, still sweet, trim, and funny, now resides in Benton Harbor, Michigan. How do I know this? The long arm of coincidence stretched out and tapped me on the shoulder in the form of my great friend, Tim. It turns out that June is his aunt. To make the world even smaller, I discover that my favorite childhood playmate was Tim’s uncle, Jackie.\n\nTim decided that June and I should meet again, so last Sunday, we set out for Benton Harbor. June greeted me with a hug, and I couldn’t resist saying, “What’s new?” Plenty, of course, but more important was what was old.\n\nJune and I reunited after almost 70 years.\n\nWe swapped memories eagerly, and soon the old house rose again from the ashes, (It was destroyed in a fire, years after we too moved out), bursting with friends, relatives and neighbors also long gone, and with the sights, sounds and smells of that distant time. June remembered the aroma of baking bread wafting upstairs, (Grandma baked twice every week). Often, they were awakened by the loud crackling and crunching as Grandma ground beans for coffee.\n\nAs to our conversation, far from not knowing where to start, we didn’t know how to stop. Pictures helped. Margaret Thompson, (Maggie to June), our neighbor directly across the street, was another of our former baby sitters and maid of honor at June’s wedding. We reminisced about Margaret and her sisters, Scottish lasses proud of their heritage, who sword danced competitively. Indeed, it was a colorful neighborhood.\n\nWhen we grew hungry, June suggested Bucks where I enjoyed an exemplary olive burger. Ushering us in was a cute boy about seven feet tall with a wild mop of curly hair. He was all in black, shorts and a tee shirt reading “DON’T GO BACON MY HEART.” Tim and I wanted one, but the nearby store closed early on Sunday.\n\nJune lives on a small lake, and Tim had brought a fishing rod and some flashy lures to dazzle the local sea creatures, so when we got back, the two of us spent a while on June’s dock. The Michigan fish spurned Tim’s aquatic bling, but it didn’t matter. The situation was therapeutic, and I was content to watch Tim cast (he’s skilled and graceful and did have one strong tug on his line), and listen to the birds and the lapping water, the only sounds amid the sunny serenity.\n\nFisherman Tim\n\nBack indoors, I was gratified to find June reading the copy of my book I had brought her. The house has many rooms, each more comfortable and inviting than the last, and all with lush, lakeside views. It doesn’t become me to covet the roll top desk, or the grandfather clock, but I do.\n\nMore memories were exchanged, but our heads were not completely taken up with the past. June and I have the loss of a treasured partner in common. Hers, after seventy plus years, seems unimaginably wrenching to me. June is a strong lady, and a survivor, but we survive one night at a time, alone, in the dark, not a task for sissies.\n\nTim did well to reunite us. It grew dark on the drive back, and as I watched the jagged, horizontal chains of lightning, I kept thinking of the grand woman of substance the pretty, young girl had become.\n\nWednesday was full of news and events, good and bad. Good first. After two months of viral pneumonia, I am well and off my oxygen hose. I feel like a dog, unleashed to scamper about a park. No, much better than that, I feel like myself again, free to drive without being driven, free to walk every inch of my garden, free to do lovely ordinary things like going to the store without dragging a tank along, free to get a haircut, which I did at once, free to sleep unfettered. My elation is tempered only by my new understanding of what those who must live on oxygen continue to face.\n\nOn to the bad. I have never been good at backing up my car. Is anyone? Yes, there are exceptions, but I suspect they are aliens from the planet Smugaintya. My long driveway is no help. It looks straight, but isn’t. it confounds everyone doomed to negotiate it.\n\nI have learned to back out of the garage without landing in the bushes, but friends keep telling me I’d be better off backing INTO the garage. Then, I’d be able to drive straight out of it. Giddy with my new freedom, and excited to be back at the wheel, I decided to heed the oft given advice and back into the garage. I almost feel like stopping here and leaving the carnage unspoken.\n\nI go a few feet and hear a thump. I have veered over onto the lawn, hit a big rock, and knocked off a hard rubber piece of the car. I correct my course and continue. Not realizing how close I am to the garage, I hear another thump. I have hit the door, buckling it beyond use. The replacement door will set me back $2550.\n\nTo soothe my jangled nerves, I seek the solace of my old Adirondack chair in the shade garden. I sit down. Down is the operative word, for I am now sprawled flat on the ground atop a pile of rotted wood slats. It takes some effort to hoist myself to a standing position. I ponder, without success, what message the universe is trying to send me.\n\nI will concentrate on the positive, but I will never, ever back Dimitrios into the garage again. From now on, it’s full frontal or nothing.\n\nMy depleted energies have been spent on healing and putting the garden to rights, but this is a blog that will probably write itself. My cousin, Ariana and I sometimes talk about writing, and recently I sent her a list of my ten favorite novels. They are of an age, as am I, and no doubt they reveal much, perhaps too much, about who I am at heart. I treasure these volumes and have read each of them more than once, for they continue to nourish my spirit.\n\nHerewith: Two of these books were impossible to put down. I retreated to the bathroom of my grandmother’s house so as not to keep the family awake with my guffaws at Jane Austen‘s Pride and Prejudice. I stayed there until three in the morning. Yes, I had to know what happened with Darcy and Elizabeth, but now that I know, I’m still amused by Austen’s dry wit. After seventy years, she can still make me laugh out loud.\n\nThe Bridge of San Luis Rey was a high school assignment by Dr. Annan. I started it when I got home that day from South Shore and became so lost in it that when I was called to supper, I didn’t want to come. Thornton Wilder‘s prose is like intricately balanced architecture. Suddenly, I saw that what I wanted most in life was to be able to work such magic with words. Wilder made me want to become a writer.\n\nTwo of my favorites must be read in translation. I have a little French, but not enough to get me through Flaubert‘s Madame Bovary. My Russian is non-existent, so I can only read Tolstoy‘s Anna Karenina at one remove.\n\nFor this reason, I’ve read these novels in more than one translation. Still, the power of such consummate prose and the keen psychological insights leave me in awe. To read these beauties in the original languages, with nothing between me and the author’s intent would leave me gasping, or maybe just sighing.\n\nNo such barrier blocks my access to George Eliot‘s Middlemarch, and such felicities as “The red drapery which was being hung for Christmas spreading itself everywhere like a disease of the retina.” Middlemarch runs to 613 pages. That didn’t stop me from foisting a copy on my mother and questioning her about her reactions. Can one be a jerk in the service of the arts? I guess one can.\n\nThree of my pets have swept me away by the sheer inventiveness of their plots. If Thornton Wilder made me want to be a writer, Emily Bronte‘s Wuthering Heights made me want to love and be loved beyond all reason. In that, I got my wish. Dickens‘ Great Expectations tugs at me, after many readings, with, among other things, the pure, loving relationship between Pip and Joe Gargery. And then there’s Gone with the Wind. Yes, those happy plantation slaves are a problem. They always were. But what a plot! And what an utterly fascinating pair of characters. Has there ever been a more maddeningly compelling heroine than Scarlett O’Hara – and in the book, she’s more Scarletty than ever. And Rhett Butler – oh my. I’m sorry, but whatever its faults, GWTW is one terrific read – and re-read.\n\nI was given a copy of Huckleberry Finn by my maternal grandmother when I was quite young -too young. Urbane little snob that I was, for me the tale of two country yokels on a raft held little appeal. Time passed, and I grew fonder and fonder of this American treasure. The arc of Huck’s transformation still makes me cry as he declares he’d rather go to hell than betray Jim. Thank you, Grandma. I just needed to grow into it.\n\nFinally, Bram Stoker‘s Dracula. I love epistolary novels with their push pull of withhold and reveal. It’s a truly scary tale and extremely well written. John and I found ourselves in a sloping graveyard at Whitby, the setting of part of Dracula. The dread atmosphere of the book was palpable, helped on by an impending storm.\n\nAnd there you have it. These ten tomes have given me uncountable hours of pleasure, and continue to do so.\n\nFor five days straight after getting home with the oxygen, I was blessed with company, at a time when I deeply needed not to be alone. I acknowledge my gratitude in what follows.\n\nThat first night home from the ER, I slept quite soundly – almost straight through. I was tired, of course, but I’ve since discovered the extra oxygen is a boon to slumber. Al was up long before I came down. He’d had breakfast and a mid morning snack. Trying to be disciplined on a new diet, he’d brought enough of the assigned portions for several days.\n\nI found him in the family room, watching what appeared to be the “Let’s scare the pants off you with goofy things unlikely ever to happen” channel. Left to my own devices, and barring a national calamity, I never turn the set on before evening. To me, that’s just a preview of life in a nursing home. But I wanted Al to have every comfort he could find here, and as they say, “Chacun a son gout.”\n\nI had calmed down a bit, and we talked. It’s easy to feel safe in Al’s presence. He’s so mechanically resourceful that, on a desert island, he’d have a snug hut whipped up in no time, with game sizzling on a spit. He whiled away the afternoon fixing a loose handrail, and replacing a faulty back doorknob.\n\nBoth of us enjoy old Perry Mason reruns, so that evening we contented ourselves predicting the murder victim (always the most obnoxious character in the first five minutes), the suspect (always found with gun in hand by the corpse, but never guilty) and the murderer. Poor Hamilton Berger, his chances of winning a case were slimmer than Charlie Brown had with Lucy holding the football. No, suave Raymond Burr would ever prevail.\n\nI asked Al if he’d care to see a shadier and heftier side of Burr. I’d recorded Pitfall, in which he plays one of the most loathsome villains ever to disgrace the screen. I hadn’t seen it since it came out in 1948. I was eleven, but it stayed with me, especially the very un-Hollywood ending. It didn’t disappoint, and we had much to discuss after Eddie Muller‘s final comments.\n\nAl stayed another night, and I couldn’t have asked more of him. He had greatly eased my orientation to my new constraints. I shuffled about after he left, carrying my loops of hose and trying not to step on them or ponder the possibility of their permanence.\n\nThat evening, Darlene came by bringing supper from a Greek place she likes. There were rich egg lemon soup, chicken kabobs, rice, potatoes, and dolmades. They needed heating, but Dar wouldn’t let me stir from my seat. The dishwasher was full. She emptied it and left me nothing to clean.\n\nWe moved to the Garden of Allah to watch something. She’d never seen Pitfall, and I didn’t mind seeing it again so soon at all. It’s really a pillar of 40’s noir with trenchant dialogue and smart, strong performances from Dick Powell, Jane Wyatt, Burr, and even Lizabeth Scott. Andre De Toth was able to coax some actual acting out of that lovely head. All in all, a film for grownups, or twisted eleven year olds.\n\nThursday, Ant Boy was on the premises. Young Spencer Monroe arrived to spray. I’m never thrilled to watch tiny ants troop in after a heavy rain, but I’m always glad to see Spencer. He’s a cutie pie, and a paragon of politeness. Picture Archie Andrews, with all the youthful enthusiasm but none of the hare brained schemes. He likes the house and said, “I’m going to tell my mom we really need a laundry chute like you have. Oh, and a sun room too.” His work ethic is impressive. With that, and a name like Spencer Monroe, he’ll run the company one day – unless that moniker drags him into politics.\n\nFriday, Jack Rocha paid a visit. Years ago, when I tutored Jack, I worried that his serious commitment to community activism was leaving too little time for a social life. I needn’t have. He’s now engaged to an absolutely beautiful and utterly likeable young woman.\n\nHis current project is a study of changes in the southeast side community as reflected in neighborhood movie houses in the first half of the twentieth century. He knew I’d be interested, and I was flattered that he sought my advice.\n\nJack stayed for several hours. I’m always refreshed, stimulated, and encouraged by his visits. Nothing dampens his idealism. He successfully raised the funds for a vibrant modern sculpture to be erected near the skyway. Now, he’s negotiating a land grant for a small public park at the site. Before he left, he had me sign a copy of my book to be placed with a local historical society.\n\nAll of this company helped distract me from my current fears – and I have them. I fear that my oxygen disability may prove permanent. At the same time, I fear, since my numbers are promising, that I’ll be given too hasty a bill of health, and slide back to the state of exhaustion which brought me here. Over the weekend, I started to feel worse. After almost twenty-four hours, I found that my hose was disconnected. Well, I didn’t die, but the rapid rise in my energy once I was back on oxygen, convinces me that, for now, I need it.\n\nJust a little while ago, my dentist called to say that he and his wife would be bringing me whatever i wanted for supper from Cafe Borgia, where they’d be dining. It occurs to me that my fifty foot world, peopled as it is with such saints and angels, is still a good place to reside."
