Photo Pathé Natan. <b>Emile Génevois</b> as Gavroche in <i>Les Misérables</i> (Raymond Bernard, 1934).\n\t\n\t<b>Émile Genevois</b> (1918-1962) was a French film actor who is best known for his film debut, as the street kid Gavroche in  <i>Les Misérables</i> (1934). Genevois appeared in over ninety films and television programmes, generally in character roles and bit parts.\n\t\n\tÉmile Genevois was born in 1918 in Barlin, France. He made his film debut as Gavroche in Les Misérables (Raymond Bernard, 1934), a film adaptation of Victor Hugo's 1862 novel of the same name. The film lasts four and a half hours and is considered by critics to be the greatest adaptation of the novel, due to its more in-depth development of the themes and characters, in comparison with most shorter adaptations. It was released as three films that premiered over a period of three weeks. Gavroche is a boy who lives on the streets of Paris. His name has become a synonym for an urchin or street child. Gavroche is the eldest son of Monsieur and Madame Thénardier. He has two older sisters, Éponine and Azelma, and two unnamed younger brothers. Hugo never provides his given name but says Gavroche has chosen his own name. His parents show him no affection and send him to live in the street, where he is better off than at home. During the student uprising of 1832, Gavroche joins the revolutionaries at the barricade. After an exchange of gunfire with the National Guards, Gavroche overhears Enjolras remark that they are running out of cartridges. He decides he can help. He goes through an opening in the barricade and collects the cartridges from the dead bodies of the National Guard. In the process of collecting the cartridges and singing a song, he is shot and killed.\n\t\n\tIn 1934, Emile Génevois also appeared in Crainquebille (Jacques de Baroncelli, 1934). He played La Souris (The Mouse), the boy who befriends Crainquebille (Tramel). Another box office success on its release was the drama Maria Chapdelaine (Julien Duvivier, 1934) starring Madeleine Renaud, Jean Gabin and Jean-Pierre Aumont. During the 1930s, he played small parts in such films as the drama Les yeux noirs/Dark Eyes (Viktor Tourjansky, 1935) starring Harry Baur, and La Bête Humaine/The Human Beast (Jean Renoir, 1938) starring Jean Gabin. In the following decades, he did dozens of small parts and extras in such films as Les Portes de la nuit/Gates of the Night (Marcel Carné, 1946) starring Serge Reggiani, the Guy de Maupassant adaptation Le plaisir/The Pleasure (Max Ophüls, 1952), the Belle Époque tragedy Casque d'Or/Golden Helmet (Jacques Becker, 1952) starring Simone Signoret, and the crime film Du rififi chez les hommes/Rififi (Jules Dassin, 1955). One of his final films was Affaire d'une nuit/It Happened All Night (Henri Verneuil, 1960), starring Pascale Petit. On television, he played a small part as a blind man in Gavroche (Alain Boudet, 1962), a new version of Victor Hugo's novel that had jumpstarted his career. Emile Génevois passed away in Draveil, France in 1962, aged 44.\n\t\n\tSources: Wikipedia and IMDb.\n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
