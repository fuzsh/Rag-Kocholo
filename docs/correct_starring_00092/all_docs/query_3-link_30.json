        "text": "What Is Bridgette Wilson's Net Worth?\n\nBridgette Wilson (also known as Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) is an American model, singer, and actress who has a net worth of $25 million. A large portion of Bridgette's net worth is attributed to her husband since 2000, retired tennis star Pete Sampras.\n\nWilson is probably best known for playing Veronica Vaughn in the 1995 Adam Sandler comedy \"Billy Madison.\" She has more than 30 acting credits to her name, including the films \"Higher Learning\" (1995), \"Mortal Kombat\" (1995), \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" (1997), \"House on Haunted Hill\" (1999), and \"The Wedding Planner\" (2001) and the television series \"Santa Barbara\" (1992–1993) and \"The $treet\" (2000–2001).\n\nBridgette also produced several videos on 1997's \"Michael Jackson: HIStory on Film – Volume II,\" and she has released two albums, \"I Only Wanna Be with You\" (1994) and \"Gimme a Kiss\" (1996). Though Wilson hasn't appeared in an on-screen role since 2008, she voiced Sonya Blade in the 2020 video game \"Mortal Kombat 11.\"\n\nEarly Life\n\nBridgette Wilson was born Bridgette Leann Wilson on September 25, 1973, in Gold Beach, Oregon. She grew up with mother Kathy, father Dale, and sister Tracy, and she attended Gold Beach High School, graduating in 1991. As a teenager, Bridgette played on the school volleyball team and competed in beauty pageants, winning the Miss Teen USA pageant in 1990.\n\nCareer\n\nWilson made her acting debut in 1992, playing Lisa Fenimore on the soap opera \"Santa Barbara\" and landing a recurring role as Ginger on \"Saved by the Bell.\" Her first film was 1993's \"Last Action Hero,\" in which she played the daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Detective Jack Slater. Bridgette also guest-starred on \"Murder, She Wrote\" that year, and in 1995, she appeared in the films \"Higher Learning,\" \"Mortal Kombat,\" \"Nixon,\" and \"Billy Madison.\" She then appeared in the TV movie \"The Stepsister\" (1997) and the films \"Final Vendetta\"/\" Sweet Evil\" (1996), \"Unhook the Stars\" (1996), \"Nevada\" (1997), \"The Real Blonde\" (1997), and \"Marina\" (1997) and played Elsa Shivers, the sister of Sarah Michelle Gellar's Helen Shivers, in the hit horror movie \"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\" which grossed $125.3 million against a $17 million budget. In 1998, Wilson appeared in the TV movie \"Host\" and the film \"Starstruck,\" followed by \"The Suburbans,\" \"Love Stinks,\" and \"House on Haunted Hill\" in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Wilson appeared in the Sally Field-directed film \"Beautiful\" and began playing Bridget Deshiel on the Fox drama \"The $treet.\" The following year, she co-starred with Christina Applegate in \"Just Visiting\" and with Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey in \"The Wedding Planner.\"\n\nIn 2002, Bridgette performed on the Tommy Shane Steiner song \"What We're Gonna Do About It,\" which peaked at #43 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart. She appeared in the 2002 films \"Buying the Cow\" and \"Extreme Ops\" and guest-starred on \"Frasier\" (2002), \"CSI: Miami\" (2003), and \"Jake in Progress\" (2005). Wilson co-starred with Steve Martin, Claire Danes, and Jason Schwartzman in 2005's \"Shopgirl,\" which was based on Martin's 2000 novella of the same name. In 2007, she guest-starred on \"Carpoolers\" and appeared in the TV movie \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" and in 2008, she starred in her final film to date, the Sonny Liston biopic \"Phantom Punch.\"\n\nBridgette also served as a judge for the 2006 Miss Universe pageant and appeared in an off-Broadway production of \"The Rocky Horror Show.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nBridgette married professional tennis player Pete Sampras on September 30, 2000. They welcomed son Christian Charles on November 21, 2002, followed by Ryan Nikolaos on July 29, 2005.\n\nReal Estate\n\nPete Sampras and Bridgette Wilson have bought and sold a number of impressive properties around the Los Angeles area over the years.\n\nBeverly Hills & Brentwood: In 2001 Pete and Bridgette paid $8.9 million for a 10,000 square-foot mansion in Beverly Hills. They listed this home for sale in mid-2008 for $23 million. They eventually accepted an offer of $17 million from \"Will & Grace\" creator Max Mutchnick. Mutchnick and his husband performed a massive renovation on the property. In 2018 Mutchnick sold the home to Adam Levine for $34 million. In April 2021 Adam Levine sold the home for $45 million.\n\nIn 2009, Pete and Bridgette purchased a property in Brentwood for $5.6 million. In 2016, Sampras put this property on the market for $8.9 million. They accepted $7.25 million in February 2017.\n\nIn 2014, the couple spent about $5.9 million on a new property in Bel-Air. Also in 2014, it was reported that Pete Sampras had purchased a second property in Bel Air, California for just over $3.5 million. This second property was adjacent to the house they had already purchased.\n\nThousand Oaks: In 2009 Pete and Bridgette completed construction on a 16,000 square-foot mansion on Lake Sherman in Thousand Oaks, California. They did not stay in the 20-acre property for long, listing it in March 2021 for $25 million. The mansion comes with a perfectly positioned and lit tennis court, of course, along with seven bedrooms, twelve bathrooms, lots of closets, and a position on a hilltop that allows for privacy and beautiful views of the surrounding countryside. It is basically 16,000 square feet of awesome, including a separate 2,000 square foot gym, and a 1,200 square foot guesthouse. They apparently sold this home in an off-market deal in late 2013 for an undisclosed price, but what was reported to be a bit more than $13 million. The sale price is not listed on the home's recorded price history on public real estate records."
