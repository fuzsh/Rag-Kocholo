        "text": "\"MORTAL KOMBAT!\" This was the sound that greeted moviegoers back in 1995 when Paul W.S. Anderson's 'Mortal Kombat' hit the big screen. Based on the popular series of video games, the modestly budgeted movie ($18 million) ended up raking in over $122 million dollars worldwide. It made stars out of current unknowns and gave gamers hope that video game movies can be good. Hope that was quickly destroyed with the terrible sequel.\n\n18 years after Lui Kang faced off against Shang Tsung, we take a look at the cast to see where they are now. (Our only omission on this list is Trevor Goddard as Kano, who passed away in 2003 from an accidental drug overdose.)\n\nRobin Shou, Liu Kang\n\nThen: Robin Shou played the Shaolin monk looking to avenge his brother's death. Before playing the popular video game icon, Shou went to Hong Kong to make martial arts movies. After returning to the States, he also appeared in 'Beverly Hills Ninja' alongside the late Chris Farley.\n\nNow: Shou had a minor role in another video game movie, the 2006 stinker, 'D.O.A.: Dead or Alive.' He also appeared as Gen in 2009's 'Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.' His last role was in 2012's 'Death Race 3: Inferno.'\n\nJohnny Cage, Linen Ashby\n\nThen: Before punching four-armed monsters in the groin, Ashby had some minor roles in film before getting noticed in 1994's 'Wyatt Earp.' After 'Mortal Kombat,' he went on to star in a bunch of movies no one has ever heard of.\n\nNow: Ashby had minor roles in 'Melrose Place,' 'The Young and the Restless' and 'Days of Our Lives.' His last starring role was in 2013's 'Iron Man 3.' Ashby is still married to Susan Walters, who he met on the set of 'Loving' back in 1983. They have two daughters, and Ashby continues to study Karate, Tae Kwon Do and Kung Fu.\n\nSonya Blade, Bridgette Wilson\n\nThen: Wilson performed all of her own stunts as serious law lady Sonya Blade. Before kicking Kano's ass, this former Miss Teen USA starred in Adam Sandler's 'Billy Madison' and appeared in five episodes of 'Saved by the Bell.' 'Mortal Kombat' didn't stereotype this blond beauty, who continues to act.\n\nNow: Wilson has starred in everything from 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' back in '97, to appearing in episodes of 'Frasier' and 'CSI: Miami.' Her last role was in the 2009 flick 'Phantom Punch.' She's still married to former ATP pro Pete Sampras.\n\nLord Raiden, Christopher Lambert\n\nThen: Lambert appeared in French films before being discovered by international audiences in 'Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes' back in 1984. After that he made waves as Conner MacLeod in the popular sci-fi movie 'Highlander.' He went on to star in a series of action movies in the '90s, and you couldn't peruse an aisle at Blockbuster Video without seeing his face on the cover of a movie.\n\nNow: Lambert married Sophie Marceau in 2012. He has been diagnosed with myopia, and can't see unless he's wearing glasses. He owns a mineral water business, a food processing plant, and also produces Côtes-du-Rhône wines. He is also the owner of Lamb Bear Productions.\n\nKitana, Talisa Soto\n\nThen: Soto started her career as a model at the age of 15 before becoming a Bond Girl in 1989's 'Licence To Kill' alongside Timothy Dalton. In 1990, she was chosen as one of People magazine's '50 Most Beautiful People in the World.' She also appeared in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue in 1995.\n\nNow: Soto married actor Benjamin Bratt in 2002 and they have two children. She continues to act, and was last seen in the 2013 science fiction film 'Elysium' starring Matt Damon.\n\nShang Tsung, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa\n\nThen: The son of a Japanese actress, Tagawa shares a film role with Talisa Soto. He also appeared in 1989's 'Licence To Kill' before playing in various villain roles that led up to 'Mortal Kombat.' He also starred in blockbusters like 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Memoirs of a Geisha,' before returning to video game movies in 2009's 'Tekken.'\n\nNow: Tagawa is still acting and is reprising the role of Shang Tsung in the second season of 'Mortal Kombat: Legacy.' He can also be seen in the upcoming Keanu Reeves action film, '47 Ronin.'"
