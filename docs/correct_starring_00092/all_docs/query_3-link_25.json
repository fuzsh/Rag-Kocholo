        "text": "Last Updated on November 2, 2023\n\nBridgette Wilson-Sampras, who brought Sonya Blade to life in 1995’s Mortal Kombat and proved the object of Billy Madison’s juvenile affection, has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\n\nIn a statement, Bridgette Wilson-Sampras’ husband, tennis legend Pete Sampras, wrote, “This past year has been an exceptionally challenging time for my family…Last December, my wife, Bridgette, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Since then, she has had major surgery, pushed through chemotherapy and continues with targeted maintenance therapy…It is hard to watch someone you love go through a challenge like this. However, seeing our boys step up and be such strong supports of Bridgette, myself and each other has been amazing. Watching Bridgette continue to be an incredible mom and wife through it all has been inspiring.”\n\nThat Bridgette Wilson-Sampras was diagnosed nearly one year ago shows just how difficult it must be for her and her family to discuss the topic openly. While we do not know the exact stage the actress is in, according to the Mayo Clinic, the five-year survival rate for advanced ovarian cancer ranges anywhere between 31-50%. Regardless of her condition at this point, this is absolutely horrible and stunning news and we here at JoBlo.com are hoping for the best.\n\nBridgette Wilson-Sampras made her big screen debut playing Arnold Schwarzenegger’s daughter in 1993’s Last Action Hero before truly breaking out in 1995 with both Mortal Kombat and Billy Madison, playing third grade teacher Veronica Vaughn. There, too, would be turns in teen slasher I Know What You Did Last Summer, supernatural horror remake House on Haunted Hill and rom-com The Wedding Planner. Television credits include soap opera Santa Barbara, a recurring role on Saved by the Bell and Fox’s The Street. And while Wilson-Sampras hasn’t appeared onscreen since 2008, her likeness was used in NetherRealm Studios’ Mortal Kombat 11.\n\nPrior to acting, Bridgette Wilson-Sampras was named Miss Teen USA 1990. She married Pete Sampras in 2000, two years before his last match. The couple has two children.\n\nWhat is your favorite Bridgette Wilson-Sampras performance?
