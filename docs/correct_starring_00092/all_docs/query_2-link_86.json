        "text": "The 1995 film adaptation of Mortal Kombat stands as a prominent milestone among video game adaptations, although its trajectory could have vastly differed due to casting challenges. Helmed by director Paul W.S. Anderson, the feature film loosely drew from the eponymous video game series that gained prominence in 1992 for its combat-centric gameplay and visceral violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoasting cast members like Robin Shou, Linden Ashby, and Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, Mortal Kombat clinched success at the box office, prompting a subsequent sequel titled Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and spinoff television productions. After a period of development hurdles, a Mortal Kombat reboot is slated to premiere in 2021. Here are six famous actors who turned down the franchise.\n\nAlso Read: Ed Boon Shares Another Hilarious Celebrity Kombat Video Ahead of Mortal Kombat 1’s Release\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme\n\nLinden Ashby took on the role of Johnny Cage, the Hollywood luminary who entered the tournament with the aim of proving his martial arts prowess to the world. This exceedingly self-assured character lent a touch of humor amidst the tense, action-laden sequences. Ashby, in reality, underwent training in karate, tae kwon do, and kung fu to embody Johnny. Even Johnny Depp was attached to the role, but he backed out for unknown reasons.\n\nThe in-game persona drew inspiration from Jean-Claude Van Damme, with the actor himself being considered for the part in Anderson’s cinematic rendition. Van Damme, however, declined the opportunity, opting instead to portray Colonel Guile in the movie adaptation of another video game, Street Fighter.\n\nCameron Diaz\n\nPortraying Sonya Blade, Bridgette Wilson-Sampras embodied the role of a resolute officer within the United States Special Forces, propelled by the desire to avenge her partner’s demise. In her pursuit to eliminate the crime lord Kano, Sonya’s journey led her to engage in the tournament, aiming to thwart the malevolent sorcerer Shang Tsung and his allies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring auditions for the character, Wilson-Sampras participated but, due to an extended casting process, she became involved in the film “Billy Madison” instead. Notably, the studio opted for Cameron Diaz to take on the role of Sonya, impressed by her performance in The Mask.\n\nAlso Read: Gamescom 2023: Mortal Kombat 1 Gets Incredible Gameplay Trailer\n\nDanny Glover\n\nRemarkably, Christopher Lambert assumed the role of Rayden, the thunder deity who assumed the role of mentor in the heroes’ quest to safeguard Earthrealm. In the gaming realm, the character is known as Raiden, an ageless figure sworn to defend Earthrealm, albeit restricted from direct tournament engagement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Lambert was aptly cast as the sagacious leader of the ensemble, he wasn’t the initial contender for the role of Rayden. Intriguingly, several illustrious actors, Danny Glover included, were under consideration for this character.\n\nSean Connery\n\nThe iconic James Bond star, Sean Connery, emerged as an unconventional option for the portrayal of Rayden in the 1995 movie. The rationale behind this choice was to potentially attract a broader viewership, given Connery’s well-established presence in the ’90s.\n\nDespite ranking high among the favored contenders for the role, he displayed zero inclination towards it. Interestingly, Connery declined the opportunity, opting instead to reject the offer and devote additional time to his passion for golf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom Cruise\n\nRenowned figure, Tom Cruise, also emerged as a contender for the role of Johnny Cage. Remarkably, Tom Cruise relinquished the chance in favor of leading Mission Impossible.\n\nThe reasons behind other actors’ decisions remain elusive, though many actors were engaged in a steady stream of commitments throughout the mid-’90s, possibly impeding their involvement in Mortal Kombat.\n\nBrandon Lee\n\nThe initial selection for the role of Liu Kang was reportedly Brandon Lee, renowned as the son of the iconic Bruce Lee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTragically, Lee’s life was cut short during the production of The Crow. While portraying the film’s protagonist, he was engaged in a scene involving gunfire. A mishap with faulty blank ammunition led to Lee’s injury, and he passed away at the age of 28 after being transported to the hospital.\n\nAlso Read: Mortal Kombat 1 Gets New Live Action Trailer Featuring Dave Bautista and Countless Easter Eggs\n\nSource: Screen Rant"
