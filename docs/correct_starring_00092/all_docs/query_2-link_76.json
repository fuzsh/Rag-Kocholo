        "text": "Tennis star Pete Sampras has revealed that his wife, actress Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, has been privately battling ovarian cancer since receiving a diagnosis in 2022.\n\nSampras announced the news in a statement shared on the ATP Tour’s social media, expressing that his wife’s health battle has been “an exceptionally challenging time” for the family.\n\n“As most have come to know, I am a pretty quiet and private person. However, this past year has been an exceptionally challenging time for my family and I have decided to share what’s been going on,” he wrote.\n\nHis statement continues, “Last December, my wife, Bridgette, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Since then, she has had major surgery, pushed through chemotherapy and continues with targeted maintenance therapy.”\n\nSampras went on to praise their sons for managing to “step up” during this difficult time.\n\n“It is hard to watch someone you love go through a challenge like this. However, seeing our boys step up and be such strong supports of Bridgette, myself and each other has been amazing,” he said. “Watching Bridgette continue to be an incredible mom and wife through it all has been inspiring.”\n\nThe 14-time Grand Slam champion concluded his statement by asking his supporters for thoughts and prayers “as Bridgette continues to thrive on her healing journey.”\n\nTennis player Andy Murray shared his support for the couple, writing, “All the best to your wife and your family Pete.”\n\nWilson-Sampras has not personally addressed the news.\n\nThe former actress began her career in 1992 with a brief stint on Saved by the Bell. She then landed her first lead role in Adam Sandler‘s 1995 comedy Billy Madison, in which she played his love interest. She later played the scorned bride opposite Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey in The Wedding Planner.\n\nHer career featured a number of memorable film appearances throughout the ’90s, including Mortal Kombat and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Her final credit is listed on IMDb as voice acting in the 2019 video game Mortal Kombat 11.\n\nThe pair married in 2000 and share two children."
