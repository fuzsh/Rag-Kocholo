        "text": "Raiden and Johnny too!\n\nJust a week after Mortal Kombat 11's Ultimate update, NetherRealms Studios surprised fans with even more exciting content when they rolled out three new character skins as Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade, and Raiden now have the look and sound of their 1995 Mortal Kombat film actors: Linden Ashby, Bridgette Wilson, and Christopher Lambert, respectively.\n\nThe trio of actors lent both their voices and looks to the characters, meaning we now get to compare them to those of Andrew Bowen, Ronda Rousey, and Richard Epcar. Cheng Teoh has graciously edited some intro dialogue for each of these fighters together so we can decide who we think did each the best.\n\nLet's kick things off by addressing the elephant in the room. Ronda Rousey is a very talented woman who has already achieved a wildly impressive lot, but voice acting has proven not to be one of her strongest suits. Mortal Kombat fans' online reactions to this news about the Lambert, Ashby, and Wilson versions of these characters were arguably almost evenly split between hype for the content and remarks about having a new voice for Sonya, if that's any indication of general reception.\n\nThis isn't only about Wilson and Rousey, however, as the absolutely unmistakable voice of Christopher Lambert is a nostalgic blast from the Kombat past for many of us. That said, Epcar has delivered a strong performance that's more than worthy of the thunder god, (he knocked it out of the park as Joker in this game as well) and offers a very powerful and different approach than Lambert's softer sage-like and wisdom-filled delivery.\n\nWhile I'd personally go with Lambert for Raiden, (and that might just be nostalgia-driven) I can't stress enough that Epcar does a fine job with the iconic combatant.\n\nThough Linden Ashby's \"let's dance\" and \"those were $500 sunglasses a******\" lines were probably the ones my sister and I quoted most as children, his execution here seems a bit fatigued. Andrew Bowen set a high bar for the Hollywood hero, (I think I've heard the Johnny Cage announcer selected more often than any other) and I think I might prefer his over Ashby's by just a bit.\n\nCheck out the video below and let us know which versions you prefer most and why in the comments."
