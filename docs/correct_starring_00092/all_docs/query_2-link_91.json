The former pageant queen starred in a range of hit movies during this period, from the original Mortal Kombat to Adam Sandler smashes like Billy Madison. Whether you went looking for satirical bombast in The Last Action Hero or schlocky horror in I Know What You Did Last Summer, Wilson was impossible to miss. \r\n\r\nThe hot streak wouldn't last, however. Bridgette Wilson-Sampras hasn't been seen in a movie since 2008's B-list boxing biopic Phantom Punch, an exit that would be impossible to predict for someone taking in House on Haunted Hill from a movie theater's upholstered seat in 1999. The question, of course, is why.\r\n\r\nWhere did Bridgette Wilson-Sampras go and why haven't we seen her onscreen in over a decade? The answer is actually rather simple. But before we get to that, it helps to know just how much of a sensation Wilson-Sampras was. \r\n\r\nRead More: [url]https://www.datalounge.com/thread/26034367-bridgette-wilson[/url][/quote]\r\n\r\n[url]https://www.filmboards.com/board/20933098/[/url]",
