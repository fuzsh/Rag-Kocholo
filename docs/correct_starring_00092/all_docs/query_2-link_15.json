        "text": "Five foot nine inch former teen volleyball star Bridgette Wilson used her 1990 title as Miss Teen USA as a springboard to an acting career. Soon after relocating to Los Angeles in her Miss Teen USA Mercury Tracer, the blonde Oregon native landed a ten-month stint on the daytime serial \"Santa Barbara\" (NBC, 1991-92) and then made her feature debut as the pistol-toting daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger in \"The Last Action Hero\" (1993). 1995 saw her in small parts in the movies \"Nixon\" and \"Higher Learning\" and in higher profile roles as a tough drug task-force leader in \"Mortal Kombat\" (her bad ass quotient went through the roof) and as Adam Sandler's love interest in \"Billy Madison.\" Wilson made an indelible impression as a woman in jeopardy in \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" (1997) and received perhaps her best notices to date for her turn as prize model Sahara, the self-effacing bottle-blonde given to holding forth on the \"deeply spiritual\" essence of \"The Little Mermaid\" in Tom DiCillo's \"The Real Blonde\" (1998). Her TV work has included the thriller \"The Stepsister\" (USA, 1997) and \"Virtual Obsession\" (ABC, 1998)."
