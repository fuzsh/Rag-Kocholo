Niles sets Frasier up with Lisa, one of his patients, who owns a bookstore. Roz tries to partner him with artist Suzanne, though it proves a definite mismatch, and Martin introduces Frasier to Kris, an attractive girl from his building, who seems to know every man at the bar.\n\nDead Zone\n\nWhen an undersea treasure hunter is found spear gunned to the hull of his boat, the CSIs find themselves dropped into the murky depths of modern day piracy."
