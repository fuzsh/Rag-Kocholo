        "text": "American tennis great Pete Sampras revealed that his wife Bridgette Wilson Sampras, 50, had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\n\nThe 14-time Grand Slam champion released the news through the ATP and asked for “good thoughts and prayers” from the tennis community as his wife battles the disease.\n\nWilson Sampras had been diagnosed in December, according to the statement.\n\n“As most have come to know, I am a pretty quiet and private person,” the statement read. “However, this past year has been an exceptionally challenging time for my family and I have decided to share what’s been going on. Last December, my wife, Bridgette, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Since then, she has had major surgery, pushed through chemotherapy and continues with targeted maintenance therapy.”\n\nThe couple married in 2000 and has two kids together — Christian, 20, and Ryan, 18.\n\nSampras said it’s “hard to watch” his wife go through “a challenge like this,” but he credited his two sons for the way they’ve stepped up.\n\n“Seeing our boys step up and be such strong supporters of Bridgette, myself, and each other has been amazing,” Sampras said. “Watching Bridgette continue to be an incredible mom and wife through it all, has been inspiring. I have also learned that it is very hard to reach for support when something is simply too hard to talk about.\n\n“With that said, I will end this by humbly asking for good thoughts and prayers for our family as Bridgette continues to thrive on her healing journey.”\n\nWilson Sampras was crowned Miss Teen USA in 1990 and is a former actress who appeared in a number of movies and television shows.\n\nHer credits include appearances in shows such as “Saved by the Bell,” “Murder, She Wrote,” “Frasier” and “CSI: Miami.”\n\nShe starred in the film “Billy Madison” and was cast in “Last Action Hero” and “I Know What You Did Last Summer.”\n\nThe news spread quickly, and a number of fellow tennis stars and fans expressed their well wishes.\n\nIn response to the statement, Andy Murray wrote on X: “All the best to your wife and your family Pete.”\n\nSampras is viewed as one of the greatest players in the modern era.\n\nHe was ranked No. 1 in 1993 and held the position for 286 weeks.\n\nSampras captured seven Wimbledon titles, five US Opens and two Australian Opens."
