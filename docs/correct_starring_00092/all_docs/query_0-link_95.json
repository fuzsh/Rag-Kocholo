        "text": "Continuity mistake: When Jack rips the door off the cab, he first breaks the top hinge and enters the cab. In the next shot when he pulls the cabbie out of the car, the door is completely off and laying on the ground. A few shots later when Jack grabs the newspaper, the door is seen hanging again. (01:40:10)\n\nTrivia: When Danny is being shown Jack Slater IV,it states that its a Franco Columbo film. Franco Columbo is one of Arnold's friends from his bodybuilding days, back in the 70s/80s."
