Jonah Hill Feldstein, professionally known as Jonah Hill, is a 38-year-old native of Los Angeles, California. While his name may be most associated with movies like the teen comedy Superbad, starring Seth Rogen and Michael Cera, or Get Him to The Greek starring Russel Brand and Sean 'Diddy' Combs; he has way more acting experience up his sleeve. Acting and entertainment tend to run in the Feldstein family, as Jonah's father, Robert Feldstein, works as an entertainment industry accountant, while his sister, Beanie Feldstein, is an actress who has starred in movies and series like American Crime Story, Booksmart, Neighbors, and Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising. For the fans who find his sheepish nature as adorable as they do his foul mouth, here are eight Jonah Hill movies that exceeded expectations.
