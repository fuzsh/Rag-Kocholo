Producer Judd Apatow portrays high school insanity in 'Superbad'

By John Beifuss

The fun, misery, insecurity and idiocy of high school are depicted with vulgar, imaginative and almost heroic excess in "Superbad," which may be the funniest movie yet from the apparently infallible comedy factory of producer Judd Apatow.

Apatow is the writer-director of "Knocked Up" and "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," but "Superbad" -- for all its outrageous action and crude sexual content -- owes as much to such time-compressed films as "American Graffiti," "Dazed and Confused" and even Martin Scorsese's "After Hours" as to Apatow's previous work and such frank predecessors as "Fast Times at Ridgemont High."

The action in "Superbad" takes place primarily over a single day, two weeks prior to high school graduation, as two nerdy best friends cope with an escalating series of disasters and humiliations while they attempt to illegally buy and deliver liquor to a cool kids' party in hopes of impressing a pair of beautiful classmates.

The friends are Seth (Apatow regular Jonah Hill), a boastful and overweight serial penis-drawer whose Richard Pryor T-shirt suggests one source for his foul mouth, and Evan (Michael Cera), a soft-spoken model student headed for Dartmouth, which means the end of the long-running Seth-and-Evan team.

The barely tolerated adjunct member of the team is skinny, bespectacled ultra-geek Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who -- in the tradition of Charles Martin Smith in "Graffiti" and DJ Qualls in "Road Trip" -- experiences the most memorable evening of all after he hooks up with the most berserk comedy cops since the days of Mack Sennett. The cops are played by Bill Hader and "Knocked Up" star Seth Rogen; Rogen co-wrote "Superbad" with his longtime friend, Evan Goldberg, which explains why the teen heroes are named "Seth" and "Evan."

The cops are a bit much, and they move the film into almost surreal territory. Greg Mottola -- who hasn't directed a movie since his 1996 Slamdance Film Festival indie hit, "The Daytrippers" -- is on surer ground when he follows the bizarre, even dangerous coming-of-not-quite-age quest of Seth and Evan, whose friendship proves as sweet as it is convincing.
