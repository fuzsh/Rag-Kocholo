        "text": "It's good to see you at Sundance,\n\nYeah, you too, good to see you always.\n\nhere with Gus Van Zant's movie,\n\nwhich is, it's exciting to see him back\n\nand with Joaquim, Rooney Mara,\n\nthe title of it is, let me get it right,\n\nDon't Worry, He Won't Get Far On Foot,\n\nbut it's based on a true story?\n\n(laughs) Yeah, Joaquim Phoenix plays this guy,\n\nJohn Callahan, who was a friend of Gus's\n\nand a very alternative, controversial cartoonist,\n\nwho was an alcoholic and becomes a paraplegic\n\nand then my character gets him sober\n\nand sort of walks him through the sobriety process\n\nand it's very darkly funny\n\nand emotional, sort of like the best of what you,\n\nlike when you have a Gus Van Sant movie,\n\nvery much, I think, a movie only he could make\n\nand pull it off.\n\nWhat was he like to work with?\n\nHe's incredible, I mean, he just is quiet,\n\nhe's a man of few words, Hm-mm.\n\nbut he is able to create this environment\n\nwith very little talking,\n\nthat just has this really emotional,\n\ncreative, you know, tone to it.\n\nHm-mm, and what do you like about your character?\n\nThis is maybe my favorite experience I've had,\n\nacting in this movie, Really?\n\nbecause I'm usually playing people,\n\nthat are so chaotic inside and stressed out\n\nand you know, all these things going on internally\n\nand this was someone, who was sort of\n\nat the other end of that in their life,\n\nwho was helping other people deal with that\n\nand he's such a, I mean, when you see the film,\n\nhe's such a easy, you know, free spirit,\n\nkind of like peaceful guy, that I just was the happiest\n\nI ever was playing this character,\n\nplus I got to have long, blond hair\n\nand blonds really do have a lot of fun,\n\nYeah. (laughs)\n\nYou've had such a cool career\n\nand now you're doing a Netflix show too, I see,\n\nwith your Superbad co-star, Emma, you guys, Maniac?\n\nYeah, working with her after all these years\n\nwas a very interesting experience.\n\nReally, how crazy.\n\nWe were like two little like, weepy, emo nerds,\n\nbecause we were like, it was 10 years,\n\nright before we started shooting,\n\nit was 10 years since we made Superbad,\n\nwe've maintained a friendship all this time\n\nand it was just crazy to see, for me to see\n\nhow, not that she wasn't amazing then,\n\nbut to see how someone, who's so talented grows in 10 years\n\nand just how great she is\n\nand it was just so nice to work with an old friend.\n\nHm-mm, I wanna know what movie did you direct?\n\nI wrote and directed a movie called Mid '90s\n\nand it'll come out this year,\n\nHopefully about the mid '90s?\n\nIt takes place in the mid '90s,\n\nMid '90s, okay.\n\nbut it's, I don't really wanna talk much about it,\n\n'cause I'm hopefully gonna get it ready for Telluride,\n\n[Krista] Oh great, okay.\n\nit's, that's my dream\n\nand it's with Scott Rudin and A24\n\nand you meet people, who either have no expectations\n\nor they have certain expectations\n\nand so I just wanna show the film,\n\nbecause it's pretty much,\n\nI don't think it's gonna be anything like\n\nwhat you might expect,\n\nso I just want people to have the experience of watching it.\n\nDo you think you will direct again?\n\nYeah, of course,\n\nYeah, you like it? Can't wait.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nBut it takes me four or five years to write something,\n\nthat actually means something to me,\n\nHm-mm. it's not like,\n\nsome high concept movie,\n\nusually the shit I end up writing about takes a few years,\n\nbecause it's usually processing some real emotions\n\nor things that either happened to me,\n\nor friends or just kind of reflecting\n\non a certain period of your life,\n\nso it's not something I'll just bang out\n\nanother movie in like a year.\n\nHm-mm. Yeah.\n\nThat's incredible,\n\nwell it's great to see you, Jonah.\n\nYou too.\n\nI always love seeing you in person and on screen,\n\nall of that, Same with you.\n\nlooking very handsome, I like the beard, I like the hair,\n\nThat is very nice, Krista. I like it all.\n\nI'm tempted to flirt back,\n\nbut also Yeah.\n\nI'm just trying to be respectful,\n\n'cause I know she's married, right?\n\nYeah, yeah. She's taken,\n\nso you know, Yeah, alright.\n\nI'm just gonna take the compliment\n\nand just say thank you very much.\n\nYou're welcome very much."
