        "text": "The 'œteenage sex comedy' may be the lowest of all cinematic forms, said Michael Machosky in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. But now 'œthis decrepit genre has its Citizen Kane.' Superbad, a night in the life of three horny high school friends trying to buy alcohol and get laid, is very raunchy and very funny. Co-writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg started the script while still in high school, and Jonah Hill and Michael Cera play their eponymous alter egos. But newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse runs away with the film as Ã¼ber-nerd Fogell, 'œa cult character destined to live forever in college dorms.' Superbad gets adolescent sex absolutely right, said Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times, summoning 'œnot only the agony but the complete absence of ecstasy.' Even its raunchiness rings true, 'œbecause if you know nothing about sex, how can you be tasteful and sophisticated on the subject?' Superbad was produced by gross-out auteur Judd Apatow, who directed Knocked Up and The 40-year-old Virgin, said Craig D. Lindsey in the Raleigh, N.C., News & Observer. As in those films, rude jokes provide cover for a surprisingly heartfelt moral tale. Superbad only seems to be about Evan's and Seth's lust for girls. What's really interesting is their relationship with each other, which makes this 'œthe most raucous, adventurous, and ultimately endearing portrait of friendship since Sideways.'\n\nRating: R"
