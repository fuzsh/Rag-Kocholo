        "text": "Your new film is about a young music fan, played by you, who goes on a week-long drinking bender with a rock star, played by Russell Brand. Did you do a lot of research for the role?\n\nWhen we were in London shooting, he asked me if I wanted to hang out after work. I figured we'd go and get a coffee or something. We ended up at a gentlemen's club. A place called Stringfellows?\n\nUh oh. Did you come away a poorer man?\n\nI actually didn't spend a lot of money. Strip clubs kind of depress me. Also, I get a different experience there because I'm recognisable. As opposed to being, like: \"Oh my God, there's Jonah Hill, I'm gonna give him a lap dance!\", the strippers go: \"Oh my God, there's Jonah Hill, I'm gonna talk to him about my childhood for 45 minutes and find out how I can become an actor too!\"\n\nDid you know who Russell Brand was when you first met him?\n\nIt was funny. When we were filming Forgetting Sarah Marshall in Hawaii, he told me that he was very famous in Europe. I thought: \"Yeah, right.\" It turns out he is pretty famous in Europe.\n\nHave you been invited to his wedding?\n\nNot yet, but I'm checking my mailbox every day, hoping.\n\nWhat was your first break?\n\nI always wanted to be a film-maker when I was younger, not an actor. I was an eight-year-old who dreamed of being a writer on The Simpsons, which was a weird dream to have. But I started taking acting classes as a way to learn how to direct actors and I sort of fell in love with it. I started writing and acting in these little plays and then I was discovered by Dustin Hoffman. He got me my first audition for a film he was in, called I Heart Huckabees.\n\nWhat, do you mean Dustin Hoffman discovered you?\n\nI was 17 or 18 and I made this crank call CD that he really liked. I would call up hotels and pretend to be the assistant of a celebrity, asking what kind of weird things I could bring into the hotel. Once, during Oscar season, I asked about bringing in an aquatic tank for a pet seal, and they started figuring out all the different valves we'd need, the water pressure and stuff. Dustin thought it was so funny he made me do crank calls live for his family.\n\nAnd then?\n\nI dropped out of school but [laughs] unfortunately I didn't work for a couple of years. It was a tiny part in I Heart Huckabees, nobody had seen the movie, I didn't have an agent. Why would anyone want to cast me? I struggled and didn't get any work. Then I met Judd Apatow as he was about to direct his first movie, The 40-Year-Old Virgin. We just clicked and he mentored me, gave me a lot of opportunities. Without Judd and Seth [Rogen] and Evan [Goldberg, his writing partner], I wouldn't be talking to you today. They made Superbad and allowed me to star in it.\n\nDo you ever regret dropping out of college after getting your first part?\n\nNo, I found it very frustrating. I'm an ambitious guy, y'know? People mostly know me from Superbad and must think I'm a horny, foul-mouthed, loud-mouthed teenager. But I'm a 26-year-old guy and I'm very ambitious. You don't get to make movies by accident, you have to work hard, so being in school I felt kind of stagnant.\n\nHow did the success of Superbad affect you?\n\nMy life changed in a day. I remember the day before the movie came out, Michael Cera and I walked around my neighbourhood and nobody recognised us. One day later, we had to run to my apartment to escape the attention. There's a kinship and a bond between us that's pretty unique, because we went through the exact same thing at the exact same time.\n\nYou are friends with a lot of your co-stars. Have you ever signed up for a film just to hang out with pals?\n\nAlthough I tend to work with people I'm friends with, the foundation of that friendship is a respect for their talent. Hanging out with Michael for, like, three months would always be amazing. But I have plenty of friends that I'd never stake my career on making a movie with.\n\nIs it hard maintaining a friendship when both of you are in the public eye?\n\nNo, it's amazing! Because you have support from people who know what you're going through. When Michael's movie is good and does well, or when Seth's movie is good and does well, I feel genuine pride and happiness for them. We need each other to give each other constructive criticism and really be there for each other because there's really very few people who know what exactly this life is like.\n\nSeth Rogen has muscled up in recent years. Will you ever follow his lead?\n\nI've recently started exercising a lot and eating healthily. Not because of any reason besides it being good for me. And my girlfriend helps by sneaking vegetables into my meals. Chopping them up so I can't see them.\n\nGet Him to the Greek is your first starring role since Superbad three years ago. Why so long?\n\nHonestly, I could have sold out hundreds of times since then. Once you make a movie like Superbad, when it's popular and you're the lead, you get offered all kinds of things and there's a temptation to make bad movies either for the money or to maintain your relevance in pop culture. But I took my time and I waited for the right one, out of respect for Superbad. I really love that movie.\n\nAs well as Russell Brand, you've also worked with Ricky Gervais, on The Invention of Lying, and Sacha Baron-Cohen, on Brüno. Were you intentionally working through our best comedic exports?\n\nI love British comedy – things like Brass Eye, and Garth Marenghi's Dark Place, Look Around You, and The Mighty Boosh. In college, I was a huge fan of The Ali G Show, I thought it was the most brilliant thing I'd ever seen. So getting to work on Brüno as a writer and producer was a dream come true. I was writing words that came out of Brüno's mouth! As for Ricky, I think the British version of The Office is possibly one of the best TV shows... not even best TV shows... one of the best pieces of creative work ever made.\n\nAfter dreaming about writing on it as an eight-year-old, you were a guest on The Simpsons last year. How did that feel?\n\nI cried when they asked me. I called my mom and we both started tearing up. She knew what it meant to me. A whole generation was raised to learn about comedy from The Simpsons. To get to be in a booth with Homer and Marge and be in Springfield – it was unimaginable the emotions that I felt."
