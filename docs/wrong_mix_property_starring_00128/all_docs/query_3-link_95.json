        "text": "Jonah Hill proves he’s a versatile box office star\n\nJonah Hill perfected the art of comedic timing in “Superbad,” “21 Jump Street” and “This is the End.” But after dramatic turns in “Moneyball” and the recently-released “The Wolf of Wall Street,” he’s proving to be a versatile box office star.\n\n“I try to do all types of different things as an actor in different ways,” Hill told The Desert Sun in a recent telephone interview. The goal isn’t to transition to more serious roles, it’s to continue challenging himself as an actor.\n\n“I think the idea is to do everything,” said Hill, who will participate in a Q&A moderated by Bryan Cranston following a screening of “The Wolf of Wall Street” at Cinemas Palme d’Or on Jan. 5. “I’ll try and do whatever I feel passionate about at that time. It’s not some master plan to leave comedy or anything like that.”\n\nEven though it’s been labeled a dark comedy, “The Wolf of Wall Street” is a departure from the movies Hill is often associated with. Described by Screen International magazine as “Goodfellas” without all of the guns, he shares the screen with Leonardo DiCaprio in the Martin Scorsese project.\n\nThe film follows the questionable dealings of rising stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who peddled fast talk and penny stocks in the late 1980s and early-’90s before the scam fell apart. Based on the memoir of the same name, Hill plays Belfort’s pushy partner, Donnie Azoff, who like Belfort, lives an extravagant life of easy money, women and drugs.\n\n“I recognized who this person was in society,” Hill said. “I think they are a lot of what’s wrong in certain elements of society as far as only caring about money and having no impulse control.”\n\nThose greedy qualities enticed Hill, a Southern California native, to take on the part of Azoff after two months of preparation.\n\nReleased on Christmas Day to glowing reviews and earning spots on several notable critics’ best-of-2013 lists, making “The Wolf of Wall Street” wasn’t without its setbacks. During the shooting both DiCaprio and Hill snorted mass quantities of Vitamin D powder to simulate cocaine use. Ultimately, Hill contracted bronchitis from the amount of powder snorted, but he said he’d do the role again in a heartbeat.\n\n“[Azoff] is just a really complex, evil kind of guy,” he said. “There’s just a lot of challenge in bringing that person to life.”\n\nHill’s movie career was launched in 2004 with a part in David O. Russell’s ensemble comedy, “I Heart Huckabees,” and he’s appeared in at least one film every year since.\n\nActing was enticing, Hill said, because it was one of the first times in his life that he felt good at something. And audiences took notice.\n\nIt was in the biographical sports drama “Moneyball” (2011) that Hill proved his dramatic acting chops as economics graduate Peter Brand. For his performance, Hill was nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe.\n\nFor his on-screen versatility, Hill will will receive Variety’s Creative Impact in Acting Award on Jan. 5 during the Palm Springs International Film Festival.\n\nNext year, Hill has four movies set for release, including sequels to “21 Jump Street” and “How to Train Your Dragon.” But he isn’t concerned with what genre he’ll take on next; it doesn’t matter.\n\n“It’s kind of the excitement of it,” said Hill, who just turned 30. “I’m trying to take time to figure out what is really next, what I’m really passionate about.”\n\nIf you go...\n\nWhat: Live Q&A with “Wolf of Wall Street” star Jonah Hill, moderated by Emmy-winner Bryan Cranston\n\nWhen: Noon, Jan. 5\n\nWhere: Cinemas Palme d’Or, 72840 Highway 111, Palm Desert\n\nInformation: www.thepalme.com\n\nJonah Hill selected filmography\n\n“I Heart Huckabees” (2004): The supporting roll of Bret Hooten helped launch Hill’s acting career.\n\n“Superbad” (2007): Faced with poor social standing in their high school, life-long friends Seth (Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are set on attending a booze-filled party.\n\n“Cyrus” (2010): Hill portrays the manipulative adult son of Molly (Marisa Tomei) and is set on keeping his mother apart from her new boyfriend (John C.
