But how experimental, or verité, or quasi-avant-garde, do we want a documentary on mental health?\n\nMy answer: if there’s a spectrum, with films on one end that are heavily contrived by their maker, and films on the other end that are direct and uninfluenced, then I want my documentary on therapy — or really, any documentary — on that latter end.\n\n“Stutz,” directed by Jonah Hill, presents itself that way. It’s shot in black and white. Hill wears a simple white t-shirt. Hill and his therapist, the eponymous psychiatrist Phil Stutz, sit across from each other. It all appears like we’re going to be privy to a straightforward conversation.\n\nHill even provides his mission statement: he’s making this film because of how much this therapy has helped him. He thinks Stutz’s tools are great — so does Stutz. The psychiatrist claims his tools will help people right away.\n\nBut not long after this first scene, the film takes a turn. Hill reveals that they’ve been shooting for two years. That they’re sitting in front of a green screen with Stutz’s office superimposed. Even that Hill, who at some point cut off his blond frizz, is now wearing a wig."
