        "text": "1. Film title Superbad Director Greg Motolla Year 2007 Genre Comedy Area of Analysis Example Technical feature (Camera/sound/mise en scene/ editing) Conforms to genre? Y/N Breaks conformity? Y/N If yes, how? Codes and conventions Most of the film features funny parts such as for example when at the end the two friends are lying down with each other and saying they love each other using a funny voice. There is two little scene of violence when one of the characters gets punches in the face as he was going to buy some booze. And at the party outside the house where one man beats the other onto the ground Laughter, bails and head Buts and violence used in the movie. There is a lot of different types of shots in the movie there was no fast paced movements because there is no fast paced act such as car chases etc. it was all normal and tats what you intend to get in a comedy yes Yes because it is hilarious and when I first watched it I felt that effect and I know that it breaks conformity Setting In the city at school and a block they were the settings of the movie there were no other locations. They have corner shops and small blocked streets and school in the movie these are the settings in the movie. yes I think it breaks conformity because it was a suitable location and it looks perfect because when you see drunk teenagers on their way home in real life it was the same in the movie superbad and it feels real life to us because see that happen every night. Character The characters are young obviously because there still at school and they are casually dressed. They are The main character the chubby one is very desperate to have intercourse with one woman he likes in the movie who is the main female character in the film. He goes through yes Character wise it breaks conformity because were young and cool and fresh school boys like how every person goes\n\n2. also wild in fun wise in partying and getting drunk the process of buying the booze for her to witch does work out at the end of a long night and after getting into bad situations just so he can get her drunk and do it with her. through in life and it was like looking into a mirror because we used to do the stuff they do in the movie and still do it . Themes They were on a mission to buy the booze and they get into trouble throughout the mission. There was aLiquor store police car and pavements with long clean streets there was a lot of M.S, l.S and a few E.L.S yes They went through a ot of trouble to get the booze like trying a fake id which did not end up[ working and we do that aswell in real life so I think it break conformity based on that. Narrative Three desperate friends want intercourse with 3 different women one of them teams up with one of the girls n class as a cooking partner then she finds out they were getting a fake id and then she asks him to buy her booze for her party and they spend all night looking and getting into trouble and the end of the night they finally arrive to the party with the booze and he finds out that she does not what him. In the movie they use a lot of loud sounds such as police sirens and loud party music and the reason why they have put loud music in the film is because the music relates to young audience who do the stuff in theirown life on what they do in the film so for example partying trying to buy booze with fake ids that’s what like 65% of the teenage population do. In the sequence of the film there are no quick cuts the reason why this is, is because it is an action they wont to show everything at normal speed so they can look at the comedy in the movie whereas if it was a fast paced action /thriller then there would be a lot of quick cuts to suit the genres pace yes it breaks conformity because they actually do this, this is what happens in the movie. Iconography The shop in the movie was named liquor store and they call it that in America the school busses are yellow in America as well as in the movie and the stands on the side of the football pitch is The mise en scene of the movie was very bright and colourful throughout the whole movie I think if it was raining it would not suit the movie It has to be bright otherwise it would not look good. yes It breaks conformity because when I watched it looked very American because of the shop being named ‘ liquor store’ and the school hand stands on the side of the football pitch."
