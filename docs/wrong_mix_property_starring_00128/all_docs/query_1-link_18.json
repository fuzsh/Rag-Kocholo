        "text": "This is going to be the wildest night of our lives!\n\nAfter attending a party, Superbad landed in theaters in 2007. Three high school seniors plan to attend a party. Attempting to impress their crushes, they work up a plan to buy alcohol. What follows is the craziest night - if they remember it.\n\nI have not laughed so hard at a movie in a long time. Superbad defined the genre of comedy. Unlike other films that take place in a high school setting, Superbad is genuine. Littered with the nastiest jokes and absurd situations, Superbad is all about enjoying your teen years.\n\nJonah Hill, Michael Cera, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse were excellent. They had the funniest interactions. Signifying the language in which teenagers speak, I snorted at most of their dialogue.\n\nMost of the banter between the boys, mainly Hill and Mintz-Plasse, was heavily influenced by their dynamic off-camera. All friendships are different. We’re all trying to figure ourselves out in the latter half of high school.\n\nSeth’s behavior and actions are questionable. At times, Seth was very annoying with his crude opinions. Hill accomplished comedic delivery. It was his first leading role. I liked Cera’s interpretation of his character. Shy and awkward, Seth and Evan are trying to have a fun night.\n\nIn his film debut, Mintz-Plasse is forever known as Mclovin. Fogel has the night of his life. Due to his age, his mother had to be on set for one scene that no teenager wants a parent to see.\n\nThe main reason why I watched this film was for Bill Hader. Hader and Seth Rogan nailed their parts as two cops who are horrible at their jobs. Arguably, they were my favorite parts of the movie. They delivered the best lines of dialogue. There’s a lot of improv.\n\nWant to know whose film debut this was? That’s right, Emma Stone! She improvised a hilarious line of dialogue that made me drop to the floor laughing.\n\nEveryone who starred in this film had a blast. They knew full well that Superbad was a comedy. Side characters were given full permission to go as over the top they wanted in reaction, delivery, and improv.\n\nComedy has several definitions. Greg Mottola went as over the top as he could while still keeping the story grounded. Does this film have to be serious? No! It’s a wild ride of nonstop jokes. That’s what a comedy film should be.\n\nEditing deserves its own honorable mention. Seth imagining different scenarios in the market scene was hilarious. The film is given its own creative touches.\n\nSuperbad was written by Seth Rogan and Even Goldberg. They started writing it when they were 13! The story tends to meander with every misadventure the boys take, but it's played out in a fun way. First, it takes place in the school setting until getting into night events.\n\nAnother aspect that I liked about Superbad is that it did not contain the usual high school stereotypes that we see in every movie. Superbad is about a group of boys living out the last nights of adolescence. The characters were actually played by actors of high school age. I never like it when films cast adults in their 20s or 30s.\n\nSuperbad is not a film for everybody. I really did not think that I was going to enjoy this film, but it turns out, it made me laugh. This movie is for mature audiences only. The raunchy comedy and dirty language is inappropriate. Otherwise, have a laugh and enjoy this film."
