        "text": "When Superbad premiered in 2007, Jonah Hill and Michael Cera weren’t big Hollywood stars yet. The instant classic launched their careers.\n\nEmma Stone, Seth Rogen, and Bill Hader also played key roles in one of the best comedies of the 21st century.\n\nSuperbad\n\nSuperbad was the type of movie that a generation of high schoolers hangs on to and constantly references all the way through adulthood. It was the equivalent to a John Hughes movie two decades after the John Hughes movies came out.\n\nThe idea of two rowdy teenage boys just a few weeks shy of graduation meshed flawlessly with the movie’s raunchy sense of humor. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera played two characters with all the wrong things on their minds in the funniest kind of way.\n\nThe jokes didn’t leave much to the imagination. The constant sexual references can be a lot to handle, but they sparked the truest humor in Superbad.\n\nUnforgettable Scenes\n\nThere were the obvious ones. Jonah Hill’s flashback to his childhood of drawing… man parts… isn’t a scene that many people would (or can) forget. The detail that went into the drawings shown during the end credits is astonishing.\n\nMcLovin, of course, quickly became a household name after Superbad came out. The 25-year-old organ donor from Hawaii comes up pretty much anytime someone jokes about printing a different name on a fake id.\n\nFilming scenes with a high school kid going joyriding with cops who know exactly how old he is wasn’t the most mannerly idea, but it certainly made for an iconic side plot."
