Funny guy Jonah Hill spoke with senior West Coast editor Krista Smith about his performance inMoneyball,based on the book byV.F.’s Michael Lewis. (They spoke in early December.) Highlights from their chat:Krista Smith: We’re doing these Q&As during the campaign season, and I certainly hope you get in there because you’re definitely worthy. Everyone loves you in Moneyball.\n\nJonah Hill: Well, that is a great compliment.\n\nHow is it to be in the mix?\n\nIt’s nerve-wracking, but even getting to do these interviews is some sort of a significant sign that I maybe did some work that people appreciate, you know?\n\n__Let’s talk about Bennett Miller and the other B guy, Brad. At what point did you come along?__I came on once Bennett came on—Brad had always been on. Then Bennett was hired and I was the next hire after that.\n\nAnd how did you get to meet with Bennett?\n\nI was at the bottom of a list of actors that have probably all been nominated for Oscars, who you might imagine [a] part in a Bennett Miller-Aaron Sorkin-Steve Zaillian-Brad Pitt drama based on a Michael Lewis book.\n\n“Jonah Hill” wasn’t first?\n\nI was at the very bottom of that list, and based on a recommendation by Catherine Keener, who was working with me on Cyrus at the time—\n\nOh, right.\n\nCatherine kindly recommended me to Bennett. And Bennett and I had been friends for five years, and he knew I was eager to break out of whatever box I was in. So he took a meeting with me on it. And I read the book, and I told him what my take on the character was, and we kept talking—and then I eventually did a table read with him and Brad, and it went really well. Then, I basically pulled a Truman Show on Bennett, where I had seen a cut of Cyrus, and I knew that it was work that I felt was impressive, and felt that it showed I could do something very different. And the way I did it was, I asked the DuPlass brothers for a friends-and-family screening, and basically, it was all like a Truman Show on Bennett, where I just invited my friends and family, but really the whole screening was in order to show Bennett the film.\n\n__You were great in Cyrus, by the way. But go ahead.__Oh, well, thank you. And then the next day, I got the part.\n\nWith you and Brad, it’s so apparent that you had really good chemistry with him.\n\nYeah, I mean we had known each other through Ed Norton and Catherine Keener. That’s how we knew one another—we were randomly both in Italy. Our friend Shauna [Robertson] and Edward Norton and him and I went to see Radiohead together in Italy. And we had a really great night. It was super-fun.\n\nBrad Pitt and Radiohead in Italy?\n\nIt was amazing. It was in Milan.\n\n__Did you sneak in or were you mobbed?__We all kind of got in and out without anyone noticing.\n\n__Wow.__And we really hit it off, and he was great. When I got the part, we spent so much time together, because we knew our relationship was really the central relationship of the film, and the movie is really about what these two guys were able to accomplish with one another, against the odds. Brad, Bennett, and I just spent so much time with one another.\n\nI am a sports fan but not necessarily a baseball fan, but I just loved the story of Moneyball.\n\nSports, to me, is the last thing that the movie is about. It’s really about thinking differently and being the underdog, and new ideas, and adapt or die. The first one to the wall always gets bloody. I mean those are kind of the issues that really, to me, resonated.\n\n__And what’s been the most meaningful, or torturous, or Looney Tunes experience you’ve had so far?__There’s one that is the most memorable experience, easily, of my entire life. I remember the day. . . . We get to Toronto, and first people start seeing the movie and saying all of these wonderful things—the inside people, like Brad’s agent, Bryan, and my agents, Ari and Sharon. And then I see it, and I really am blown away by it. But then it wasn’t really until the Toronto Film Festival—our premiere that night—[that] I sat there and I watched this movie in front of, I think, 2,500 people, on the top of the balcony in the front row, sitting between Brad and Bennett. Phil Hoffman was sitting right behind us. My whole family and [my] friends were all there, and we were sitting just the three of us in that row. And the movie ends, and a spotlight comes just on the three of us. And every single person—2,500 people—stood up and gave a standing ovation to us three. And it was the most profound moment of my entire life. . . . It just hit me that, I guess that in some way, I felt like my hard work had paid off. I walked out, and Spike Jonze and Keener and Phil and Amy and all the studio were out there, and I just look at all my friends and my parents are all just sobbing. I completely, completely lost it—completely broke down and started crying.\n\nWhat do you remember Brad from?\n\nI think Snatch and Fight Club were probably the most important.\n\n__Not True Romance? As the stoner?__Well, of course. I mean, he has a ton of incredibly memorable performances, but Snatchand Fight Club were the two that came out while I was in high school that I really responded to, and they were both so different from [that] version of Brad Pitt where he was just a handsome leading man. True Romanceand Snatch and Fight Club are three of many where he’s carved out something completely different for himself—something completely original and off the beaten path. And that, to me, is the advice . . . I take away from him the most: the drive to think differently about your own career.\n\nWhat are you working on? You have The Sitter coming out, too, obviously.\n\nRight now I’m doing a comedy called Neighborhood Watch with Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, and myself.\n\nAnd then?\n\nI’m looking for a drama to do after that.\n\nWhat else is on your list?\n\nI think more projects like Moneyball—more different types of characters, different types of shades, and different tones of films. I think with Cyrus and Moneyball, I got a real taste for a new type of blood, as they say. Something was so inspiring and so challenging and so wonderful—to get to stretch in a different way.\n\nJust don’t start a band on me.\n\nOh no, I promise.\n\nYou won’t ever, right?\n\nI promise you.\n\nMaybe Broadway.\n\nMaybe a musical film.\n\nI could see it.\n\nFor sure. I would love that.\n\nWhat was the most challenging thing for you to play this character?\n\nThat he is so different for me. You know, I’m someone that has such an easy time being in the spotlight, or telling a story and getting the attention of the room. And the main thing about Peter Brand is that he blends into the wall. The story of him in this movie is the story of a guy that has never had a light shined on him before, and now has a huge spotlight on him, and how does he react? How does he grow into his skin, and how does he come into himself? There’s one scene in particular that’s the hardest scene I’ve ever shot in a movie, and it’s maybe a 30-second scene. It’s where I have to trade a player and go tell him he’s been traded.\n\n__Oh right, I remember that.__I have to trade [Carlos] Pena, because up to this point, all of my ideas have been executed, and it’s been all this great part of responsibility. Your ideas are coming into play, everyone’s listening to what you’re saying. You’re powerful! But now it’s like, Here’s the real stuff. Your decisions now affected a man’s life negatively, and you need to go break it to him. And I think it’s rare—and Bennett’s such a great filmmaker that you can have a scene that’s 45 seconds long that shows someone go through a complete maturation.\n\n__It’s really great.__I just found that very, very difficult and inspiring. It’s my favorite scene, and the hardest scene I’ve ever done.\n\nWatch Krista Smith and Jonah Hill chat aboutMoneyball at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival here."
