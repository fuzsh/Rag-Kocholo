        "text": "One of my favorite hobbies when I was a teenager was reading film reviews online. Back then, my access to movies was limited. Streaming services didn’t exist yet, and I didn’t have a lot of disposable income for movie rentals or the movie theater. So, I experienced film through the eyes of others. I’d go online and read reviews of foreign films not available in my small town, comedies I was too young to see, and new releases I couldn’t get my hands on yet. It was in this context that I found my first queer interpretation of a film — specifically, a 2007 review of the movie Superbad on a now-defunct website I frequented when I was fifteen years old.\n\nThe critic was harsh on the film. I remember words like childish and obscene being thrown around. But it is the opening lines of the review that are burned into my brain:\n\n“This movie would be better if it would admit the leads were gay.”\n\nTwo years passed before my parents finally allowed me to watch the movie. I noticed the subtext that had been mentioned in the review, but wrote it off as a fun, out-there interpretation. Circa 2009, this made sense. The lives of gay men were still relegated to art house films or the occasional chaste sitcom. I couldn’t wrap my brain around the concept that gay men could exist in the media in any other context.\n\nThere was no place for realistic gay men in raunchy comedy.\n\n*\n\nThirty red band trailers were approved by the MPAA the year after Superbad’s release.\n\n*\n\nThe late 2000s and early 2010s were a unique time in the comedy world. Raunchy was in, and everyone wanted a piece of the pie. At the center of this trend stood Judd Apatow and his frequent collaborators: Jonah Hill, Leslie Mann, Michael Cera, Paul Rudd, Jason Segal, Adam McKay, Seth Rogen, Will Ferrell, and Kristin Wiig. Comedians who have since become famous in their own right — Aziz Ansari, Bo Burnham, Aubrey Plaza — are featured in his early films. The stamp of Apatow on our current comedy landscape is ever-present despite some complaints in recent years that audiences have grown tired of comedies where adults behave badly.\n\nNot all taboos are treated equally in the films of Apatow and his collaborators. Sure, characters may smoke, drink, and have explicit sex, but the love that dare not speak its name is relegated to the background at best. At worst, gay people are punchlines. It is notable that Apatow has gotten flak in recent years for scenes in Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin in which the characters make derogatory comments about gay people. Apatow has never issued apologies for any of his homophobic jokes, despite frequent collaborator Seth Rogen admitting some of the things in his past films were homophobic.\n\nUnfortunately, recognition of past offensiveness has not translated into creating positive representation. In 2016, Seth Rogen released Sausage Party, a raunchy animated film about talking food that somehow managed to do justice by none of its three queer protagonists. All of these characters are ethnic stereotypes, and their queerness is treated as a punchline.\n\nI guess you could say it’s a little. . .distasteful.\n\n*\n\nIn 2017, GLAAD’s annual Where We Are On Tv report listed 129 gay male characters on broadcast, cable, or streaming television. This is up from 39 in 2007.\n\n*\n\nTen years and five months have passed since Superbad was released. During that time, we’ve seen a handful of heartwarming depictions of gay men in mainstream comedies that push the envelope. In 2013, GOB Bluth came out of the closet via a scheme involving masks and a videotape. Just this year, Mac from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia self-actualized in-part due to an obscene joke involving a repurposed exercise bike. Comedies have made room for certain gay narratives — at least on TV.\n\nOn film, the situation is a bit more dire. Notably, purported dark comedies with gay leads such as 2014’s The Skeleton Twins lean more towards drama than laughs. Mainstream coming of age stories with gay characters still lean towards the dramatic as well. The likes of 2013’s GBF or 2009’s Humpday, entertaining romps with plenty of obscene jokes to go around, are still relegated to film festival status. Queer male characters in mainstream raunchy comedies still hold the status of Damian in 2004’s Mean Girls — present, but with little to no character arc.\n\nRaunchy films are still struggling to make room for gay men.\n\n*\n\nIn the third grade, I had…like…an odd problem. For some reason, I don’t know why, I used to have this thing…where I would…like, kinda…sit around all day and draw pictures of. . .\n\n*\n\nYou don’t have to look very far to find homoeroticism in Superbad. One of the central conflicts of the film is that Evan is abandoning Seth for another man. Seth carries a passed-out Evan bridal-style to his house and puts him to bed. At the end of the film, the two of them admit to loving each other so much they want to shout it from the rooftops.\n\nThen there is the matter of Seth’s fourth grade obsession with male anatomy.\n\nSuperbad is littered with lewd art that Seth compulsively drew when he was eight years old. He kept this art hidden in a Ghostbusters lunchbox, terrified that someone would find it. This fear was justified; because of these drawings, the adults in his life believed he was possessed by the devil. Subsequently, Seth was forced into the type of reparative therapy that wouldn’t look out of place in 1999’s But I’m a Cheerleader. Ten years later, Seth still holds a grudge against the girl who ratted him out.\n\nWe’re never told if therapy cured him of his ills.\n\n*\n\nDEFAMER: Ever thought about making the first mainstream bear comedy — or, failing that, a movie with a prominent gay character?\n\n[JUDD] APATOW: I almost wrote a movie which was about gay characters but I ultimately realized I didn’t know enough about the subject.\n\n*\n\nAt the end of Superbad, the audience is given a very clear message about the direction of Seth and Evan’s friendship. The two of them are paired off with girls who promise to take them home in separate cars. Superbad’s original script best describes what happens next:\n\nAs they walk away from one another, Seth and Evan look back and give each other a small and yet emotionally-charged wave. A SLOW, GUT WRENCHING SOUL SONG STARTS TO PLAY. They look as though they’re never going to see each other again.\n\nThis narrative — that male friendships are valuable, but heterosexual relationships are inevitable — hearkens back to the beginning of cinema. In The Celluloid Closet, published in 1981, the late gay film historian Vito Russo said of buddy comedies:\n\nHeterosexual romance was often just a standard plot ingredient, thrown in at regular intervals because it had to be there, and lacking the emotional commitment that the filmmaker failed to give it. The real emotions in the movies, as well as in the movie industry, have always taken place between men.\n\nHowever, our media landscape is changing. Heterosexuality is not inevitable — even children’s television is starting to recognize this. Ironically, films that push the envelope are becoming one of the last great frontiers of queer representation.\n\n*\n\nIn a discussion about LGBT representation, a friend once said to me, “If someone isn’t going to do it right, I’d rather they didn’t do it at all.”\n\n*\n\nThere is an ever-present question in the LGBTQ community about what representation means. Audiences have come to expect affirming coming-out narratives and romantic relationships. However, queer people know that our experiences are much more nuanced than that. Many of us have had the experience, like Seth or Evan, of being in love with your best friend and not understanding its intensity. Everything is read with a heterosexual lens before you come to terms with your own queerness.\n\nWithin the heterosexual media tradition, Superbad looks like a standard coming of age story. Sure, maybe the friends are unusually close, but they both end up with girls on their arms at the end of the story. Heterosexuality has kept the world in balance in a media context where heterosexuality is inevitable. When this context is stripped away, I can’t figure out how I would make Superbad more queer. To change the film at all would be telling a lie about my own struggles with heterosexuality.\n\nSeth and Evan represent the time in my life when I couldn’t represent myself.\n\n*\n\nThis year, GQ’s ten-year retrospective called Superbad the perfect bromance movie.\n\n*\n\nGay people have a long and storied history of looking for even the smallest reflection of ourselves in the media we love. Countless books, papers, and articles have been written analyzing film, television, theater, novels, and music from a queer perspective. It can be difficult for straight people to understand this urge to overanalyze media when the narratives presented to them have always represented their lives. Unlike media that is in the definitive queer canon — which may or may not include gay people — straight people don’t have a list ‘must- sees’ that they connect with. As our canon expands to include more movies that are actually gay, the genres where we are excluded become more apparent. Raunchy comedies still exist in a dark age where gay audiences must settle for ‘bromantic’ scraps rather than gay narratives written by gay screenwriters on purpose.\n\nIt would be intellectually dishonest of me to say that Superbad has gay representation just because I relate to some of the characters. As long as critics take offense at the idea that films about male love might be gay, vaguely relatable narratives cannot be counted as legitimate representation. For now, we need raunchy films with out and proud protagonists who aren’t walking punchlines. A queer reading of Superbad in 2018 feels more natural than it did in 2007, but it still butts heads with authorial intent.\n\nTaking a retrospective look at Superbad paints a stark picture of how far we’ve come in the past decade — and how far we have left to go."
