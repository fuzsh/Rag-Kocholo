        "text": "Wanna feel old? Superbad came out ten years ago Thursday. Time really is the fire in which we burn!\n\nIn honor of the anniversary, Superbad writer/actor Seth Rogen dropped a whole bunch of trivia about the 2007 film on Twitter, a popular microblogging platform that is also often used for setting American foreign policy. According to Rogen, almost all of the names used in the film are those of actual people that he and co-writer Evan Goldberg attended high school with, and \"lots of the stuff in the movie really happened to us.\" The film took \"like 7 years\" to write, Rogen drove himself to set, and the cast of Jersey Shore once confirmed to him that their DTF catchphrase came from the movie.\n\nMore than five thousand people responded to this tweet, and a fair number of the questions Rogen answered came from former Good Wife (RIP) star Josh Charles:\n\nThe period blood scene was Rogen's favorite, and it was based on a true story.\n\nAnd here's the origin story for the \"These Eyes\" scene (as asked by none other than former VQR editor Ted Genoways!):\n\nAnd a little more about the making of the movie, starting with this shocking reveal:\n\nAlso, for anyone wondering, the movie takes place in \"a Clark County we made up.\"\n\nLike all great things, the film's title emerged while smoking weed at the infamous Oakwood apartment complex:\n\nHuge if true:\n\nLittle-known fact: every single thing to ever happen in L.A. since June 1994 can be connected to O.J. Simpson by no more than two degrees of separation.\n\nAlso huge if true:"
