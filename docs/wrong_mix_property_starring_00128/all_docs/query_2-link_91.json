But this weekend, I suspect people will walk into “Superbad” saying, “I hear this is the funniest movie of the year.” Which is also true.\n\nProfane and Coke-geysering-out-of-your-nose funny, “Superbad” finds laughs and surprising sweetness in this conflict: High school is over for Seth and Evan, and it may also be the end of their friendship, something they realize one night when they face the prospect of heading off to different colleges while attempting to buy booze for one final blowout.\n\nIf the movie were just a raucous comedy, it would be worth seeing, but as the changing-the-rules-of-a-friendship theme begins to dominate the movie, it also becomes clear “Superbad” has real insight into the way guys interact.\n\nWritten by Seth Rogen, who’s hilarious in a supporting role, and Evan Goldberg, “Superbad” is one of those movies – like “Austin Powers” – that is destined to be quoted until nobody remembers where the quotes came from. Not that you’ll be able to say any of them in polite company. “You used my leg as a tampon” and a bit of dialogue that makes fun of the easy availability of DNA evidence on “CSI” (“If he had ejaculated, then punched you in the face, we’d have a good shot at cracking this case”) are two of the few lines that are printable here, and even they aren’t going to work if you try to rock them at, say, a church ice cream social.\n\nMichael Cera, best known for “Arrested Develoment,” plays Evan, the mathletic one, and Jonah Hill, who slacked around in “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” and “Knocked Up,” is the insecure Seth. Both are brilliant as guys who hang out with each other because it allows each of them to believe he’s not the nerdiest nerd in the nerd universe.\n\nHill strikes a fine balance between bluster and self-doubt. Cera, whose specialty is mortification, gets plenty of opportunities to express it here. His stricken look when he accidentally grazes a girl’s breast is genius because, like everything else he does in the movie, it is real before it is funny (his authentically awkward sexual initiation is another highlight).\n\nAs a result, “Superbad” is also something more important than the movie where Cera says the f-word. It’s the movie that’s going to make him a star.\n\nChris Hewitt can be reached at chewitt@pioneerpress.com or 651-228-5552.\n\nWhat: “Superbad”\n\nDirected by: Greg Mottola\n\nStarring: Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen\n\nRated: R, for profanity, fisticuffs, sex and underage drinking/drugging\n\nShould you go? It’s wickedly funny. ***Â½\n\nOriginally Published: August 16, 2007 at 11:01 p.m."
