        "text": "12. KNOCKED UP (2007)\n\nDirector and writer: Judd Apatow. Starring Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd.\n\nAfter breaking through as a film director with “The 40-Year Old Virgin” Judd Apatow followed that success with “Knocked Up.” The film tells the story of an underachieving guy who spends most of his days stoned and working on a porn website. After a one night stand with a beautiful woman who rebuffs him the morning after. He later learns that the two have inadvertently conceived a child. Hill plays one of Rogen’s fellow slacker roommates.\n\n11. FUNNY PEOPLE (2009)\n\nDirector and writer: Judd Apatow. Starring Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Leslie Mann.\n\nHill once again played Seth Rogen’s roommate in a Judd Apatow film in this dark comedy. The film stars Adam Sandler as a depressed stand up comedian turned movie star who is unhappy with the low quality of the films he turns out. Things become even worse for him when he is diagnosed with a form of cancer with a low survival rate. Hill plays a stand up comic whose career is beginning to take off.\n\n10. CYRUS (2010)\n\nDirectors and writers: Jay Duplass, Mark Duplass. Starring John C. Reilly, Marisa Tomei, Catherine Keener.\n\nHill had a key role in this early film from the Duplass brothers who would go on to produce a number of successful films and television series. This story revolves around the beginning relationship between a middle aged couple (John C. Reilly, Marisa Tomei) and the problems the couple face in starting their romance. The biggest hurdle the couple have towards happiness is Tomei’s difficult son Cyrus played by Hill.\n\n9. HAIL, CAESAR! (2016)\n\nDirectors and writers: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen. Starring George Clooney, Frances McDormand, Josh Brolin.\n\nHill has worked with some esteemed directors during his brief film career. Here he worked with the Coen brothers on a story about the Hollywood studio system of the fifties. Hill has a small role as a man the studios hire to prevent scandals and bad press for their stars. Hill’s character is charged with providing foster care to the child of a young unmarried actress who gets pregnant.\n\n8. 22 JUMP STREET (2014)\n\nDirectors: Phil Lord, Christopher Miller. Writers: Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel, Rodney Rothman. Starring Channing Tatum, Peter Stormare, Ice Cube.\n\nIt is quite rare when a sequel rises to the same level as the original but that is exactly what happened to this sequel to “21 Jump Street.” Both the sequel and the original have equal scores on Rotten Tomatoes of 85% positive reviews. This time the inept cops are sent to college to continue their undercover work.\n\n6. WAR DOGS (2016)\n\nDirector: Todd Phillips. Writers: Stephen Chin,Todd Phillips, Jason Smilovic. Starring Miles Teller, Bradley Cooper, Kevin Pollack.\n\nHill earned a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for this story based on actual incidents. Hill and his friend (played by Miles Teller) are a pair of young men who get involved with bidding on US military contracts. They find themselves in deep waters when they are asked to take on a 300 million dollar deal to run the Afghan military. Hill lost the Golden Globe to Ryan Gosling for “La La Land.”\n\n5. 21 JUMP STREET (2012)\n\nDirector: Phil Lord, Christopher Miller. Writer: Michael Bacall. Starring Channing Tatum, Brie Larson, Dave Franco.\n\n“21 Jump Street” was a television show that was one of the first shows to air on the then brand new fourth television network, Fox. The show is probably best remembered today for introducing Johnny Depp to stardom. The series was the story of a bunch of young looking cops who go undercover and pose as teenagers to stop various crimes. The series played it seriously but this film version had Hill paired with Channing Tatum as two less than competent cops and was done as a comedy.\n\n4. SUPERBAD (2007)\n\nDirector: Greg Mottola. Writer: Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg. Starring Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse.\n\nSeth Rogen wrote and Judd Apatow produced this film about two socially awkward high school students who try to score points with the cool kids at school (and also perhaps impress a few young women) by throwing a huge party. Cera and Hill are both quite funny and sort of sadly charming as two high school misfits who just can’t seem to figure out how to get themselves out of the unpopular status they occupy in their high school. The film achieved a nomination for Best Comedy Movie from the Broadcast Film Critics Association.\n\n3. GET HIM TO THE GREEK (2010)\n\nDirector and writer: Nicholas Stoller. Starring Russell Brand, Elisabeth Moss, Rose Byrne.\n\nThis film of Hill’s also received a Best Comedy Movie nomination from the Broadcast Film Critics Association. Hill plays a young man interning at a record company who is assigned to escort an outrageous British rock star to his concert. The concert is to take place in Los Angeles’ Greek Theater hence the title. Russell Brand is wildly out of control and manic as the rock star. Hill plays the desperate intern who is assigned the task of getting Brand from London to the Greek Theater without him ingesting too many drugs or imbibing too much alcohol.\n\n2. THE WOLF OF WALL STREET\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese. Writer: Terence Winter. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, Matthew McConaughey.\n\nIt was a bit of a shock when Jonah Hill’s name was called as a nominee for Best Supporting Actor when the Oscar nominations were announced in 2014. The film received a total of five nominations including Best Picture, Director, Actor and Screenplay but Hill’s inclusion was a surprise since he had not been nominated for any of the major precursor awards that year such as the Golden Globes, SAG, or BAFTAS. Hill plays the best friend of the title character who joins him in a corrupt stock market business which ultimately results in Leonardo DiCaprio’s character spending time in jail. The film may have done better in awards totals had Martin Scorsese finished the post production of the film earlier. As it was the film was ignored by SAG (perhaps because the nominating committee didn’t have time to see it) and that sent DiCaprio into the Oscar race with a handicap and he’d eventually lose to Matthew McConaughey for “Dallas Buyers Club.”\n\n1. MONEYBALL (2011)\n\nDirector: Bennett Miller. Writers:Steven Zaillian, Aaron Sorkin. Starring Brad Pitt, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Robin Wright.\n\nHill earned his first Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for this film but unlike with “The Wolf of Wall Street” this year his nomination was not a surprise. Hill had met all the precursor marks this year being nominated by BAFTA, SAG and the Golden Globes. Hill plays an Economics graduate of Yale University who devlopes a computer system to pick baseball players based on computer generated statistics. He is then hired as Assistant General Manager for the Oakland A’s to implement his system and help the team out of a huge slump. Hill would not win the Oscar though. That year’s winner was Christopher Plummer for “Beginners.” The award made 82 year old Plummer the oldest person ever to win a competitive acting Oscar."
