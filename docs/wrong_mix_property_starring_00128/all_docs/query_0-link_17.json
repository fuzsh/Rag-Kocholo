Jonah Hill made it official on Twitter.\n\nJules repped Stone’s breakout feature role after parts on such TV series as HBO’s Lucky Louie and Fox’s Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nPREVIOUS, Oct. 23: A Superbad cast reunion and watch party in support of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin will be held on October 27 at 8 PM CT.\n\nCast members and filmmakers from the 2007 teenage coming of age film will watch the movie with fans around the country, giving live commentary and jokes. The event will be available for a donation of any amount, and all proceeds will go towards the Democratic party.\n\n“We are thrilled to have the cast of Superbad join us in the fight to defeat our super awful president,” said Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler. “With the help of our talented guests, we know that we can win this election for Wisconsin and for the country. Laugh with us as we raise the funds and mobilize the volunteers we need to finish this race strong.”"
