        "text": "Ask a Waiter Jan. 8, 2008\n\nMichael Rankin of Diner: ‘I Think That Guy’s McLovin — You Yesterday we caught wind that Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the actor who played McLovin in Superbad, was at Diner on Friday night. Naturally, we wondered whether he had attempted to procure an adult beverage. And who better to tell us than Michael Rankin, who has been a waiter at the converted twenties railcar for three out of the nine years it’s been serving up slow-cooked American food? Rankin had plenty to say on the celebrity front (Bono biting a bartender?) and the foodie front — including a convincing reason the humble establishment might overtake its neighbor Luger in steak supremacy.\n\nCelebrity Settings Jan. 7, 2008\n\nMcLovin Eats Out, and Not at McDonald’s As jaded as we are from combing through gossip columns for our weekly Celebrity Settings feature, there are certain celebs we’d give our middle nut to spot. Case in point: Friday night a friend texted us that she saw Christopher Mintz-Plasse, better known as McLovin from Superbad, leaving Diner in Williamsburg — presumably after eating a “sexy hamburger.” No word as to whether he attempted to purchase a drink with a Hawaiian I.D. (somehow the bartender hadn’t seen Superbad), but it’s good to see McLovin is keeping it low-key despite the mounting Oscar buzz.
