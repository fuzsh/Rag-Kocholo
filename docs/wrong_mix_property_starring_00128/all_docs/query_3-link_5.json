        "text": "Highest Rated: 100% This Place Rules (2022)\n\nLowest Rated: 0% Freaks of Nature (2015)\n\nBirthday: Dec 20, 1983\n\nBirthplace: Los Angeles, California, USA\n\nActor Jonah Hill went from providing comic relief as a supporting player to becoming a major creative force within a few short years. After a brief debut in David O. Russell's philosophical comedy \"I Heart Huckabees\" (2004), the aspiring actor went on to a handful of minor performances until his star began its rapid ascension three years later. Suddenly, he was working with the likes of Steve Carell in a comedy of biblical proportions, \"Evan Almighty\" (2007), as well as with writer-director Judd Apatow in the unplanned pregnancy romp \"Knocked Up\" (2007). It was, however, Hill's foul-mouthed, yet oddly endearing performance opposite Michael Cera in the teen buddy comedy \"Superbad\" (2007) that officially made him a player to watch. Although not starring roles, his characters in the Jason Segal romantic comedy \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" (2008) and the Adam Sandler vehicle \"Funny People\" (2009) stole every scene they were in. Now a force to be reckoned with, he co-starred with Russell Brand in \"Get Him to the Greek\" (2010), Brad Pitt in the acclaimed sports drama \"Moneyball\" (2011), Jamie Foxx in Quentin Tarantino's \"Django Unchained\" (2012), and Leonardo DiCaprio in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013), and received Oscar nominations for his work in \"Moneyball\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\" While starring in quirky fare like identity theft drama \"True Story\" (2015) and War on Terrorism satire \"War Dogs\" (2016), he maintained his status as a comedy star with starring roles in \"21 Jump Street\" (2012) and \"22 Jump Street\" (2014), as well as supporting roles in films ranging from \"The Lego Movie\" (2014) to the Coen Brothers' \"Hail, Caesar!\" (2016). Expanding his creative scope to include writing, directing and producing, Hill positioned himself as one of young Hollywood's key players in an astonishingly short period of time.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n94% Moneyball 89% Knocked Up 88% Superbad 87% Django Unchained 86% Hail, Caesar! 85% 21 Jump Street 84% 22 Jump Street\n\n84% Rocket Science\n\nPhotos\n\nJonah Hill, Amy Pascal, Channing Tatum at arrivals for 21 JUMP STREET Premiere, Grauman''s Chinese Theatre, Los Angeles, CA March 13, 2012.
