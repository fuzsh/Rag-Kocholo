        "text": "On Thursday, Superbad turned 10 years old. The brazen comedy about three desperate high-schoolers trying to buy alcohol for a party (played by baby-faced trio Michael Cera, Jonah Hill, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse) was an instant, foul-mouthed hit at the box office, raking in about $169 million worldwide. It also served as a high-profile jumping-off point for screenwriters Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who went on to write hits like Pineapple Express and Sausage Party, which also star Rogen.\n\nLate Thursday night, Rogen decided to celebrate the anniversary of the film that kicked it all off by sharing some truly weird and delightful fun facts about the movie. For instance: did you know that, according to the MPAA, Superbad was the first film in history to use the word “fingerfuck?” Now you do.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nOf course, that shouldn’t be too surprising for fans of Superbad. The word “fuck,” typically flying out of the mouth of Hill’s permanently pissed-off character, Seth, is used nearly 200 times over the course of the movie.\n\nRogen also revealed that the title Superbad was dreamt up by his friend Dave Krumholtz (star of another Iconic teen movie, 10 Things I Hate About You) one day when he was smoking weed in the legendary Oakwood apartments. The building was (and probably still is) a hub for up-and-coming stars, serving as the one-time home for actors including Michelle Williams and Kirsten Dunst. Forget Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon—if you try really hard, you can probably connect everything in Hollywood back, in some way, to this bizarrely well-connected complex; it deserves the Ryan Murphy miniseries treatment. (Ahem: if you’re reading this, Rogen, don’t forget my 10 percent cut.)\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nRogen also dropped some rather macabre trivia, including that the final house party scene—you know, the one where Jonah Hill accidentally head-butts his crush, played by a young Emma Stone—was filmed a block away from the house where Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered. Or, as Rogen puts it, “the OJ murder house.”\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nUnlike the Oakwood, the O.J. Simpson trial has been covered in every damn medium you can think of, to the point where we could staunch the flow of Simpson content forever and still have mounds of stories to sort through. All these years later and it’s still a topic on everyone’s lips, dominating airwaves, awards shows, and movie anniversary tweetstorms.\n\nRogen continued sharing little tidbits, including the surprising idea his mom contributed to the script (McLovin’s ending), and the fact that the cast of Jersey Shore lifted the phrase “D.T.F.” (“down to fuck”) from the script. He ended his trivia stream with a heartfelt message, thanking everyone for giving the film that changed his career a chance.\n\n“Anyway, if you dig Superbad, thanks for digging it,” he tweeted. “I wrote it with my best friend in high school and we still write together. It’s lovely.”\n\n15 of the Most Torturous Movie Shoots in Hollywood History\n\n1 / 15"
