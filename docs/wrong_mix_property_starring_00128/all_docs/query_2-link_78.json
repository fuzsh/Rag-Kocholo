        "text": "What, you think I’d only do game reviews? Think again.\n\nI didn’t see this movie when it first came out. I was still in third grade, so that was a given. But everyone in my grade knew it came out, because it sounded like the most R-rated movie of that era. I still remember seeing the poster for it in theaters and marveling at the list of reasons it had an R-rating. It was basically my generation’s Porky’s.\n\nWhat I got was… definitely Porky’s-level humor, but it also turned out to be a genuinely sweet coming-of-age story that I’ve now seen multiple times. Might as well mention that there’s gonna be SPOILERS, so be prepared for that before reading.\n\nFrom Teen to Celebrity\n\nSuperbad is a screenplay written by Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg while they were in middle school. If my math is right, that would be 1996. They wrote it because all of the highschool movies of their era still took place in the 80s, and while they enjoyed those films, they didn’t really relate to that time period as teenagers. I gotta say, I deeply relate to that, because even when I was in middle school (2013), all of the highschool films & books I was given still took place in the 80s. I really wish I saw this movie while I was still a teen.\n\nSeth & Evan’s personal touch to the writing is reflected in the two main characters being named Seth & Evan. They originally wanted to play themselves, but by that age they were already in their mid-20s and didn’t look the part anymore. So they cast Jonah Hill (Seth) & Michael Cera (Evan) in their place. Also supporting them in a B-plot is their nerdy friend Fogel, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse; who was an actual teenager at the time.\n\nThe basic plot of the movie is the three of them are about to graduate, and they’ll be going to separate colleges. But Seth wants to get laid before they do, because he’s convinced that “experienced” guys get more girls. He takes a liking for a girl named Jules (played by Emma Stone), and makes a deal with her to get alcohol for a party she’s throwing in an attempt to impress her. Seth has the idea in his head that Jules will only get with him if they’re both wasted, so he’s fully committed to the plan. Evan’s not sure about the idea, because he wants to pursue an actual relationship beyond the sex. They get Fogel to buy the booze since he’s the only one with a fake ID (one that lists his name as McLovin), and he gets busted by the police.\n\nFrom there, the movie splits off: One branch is Seth & Evan blackmailing wanted felon to get them alcohol at a drinking party (though mostly just Seth), and the other branch is Fogel getting into antics with the two police officers who took him into custody (one played by Seth Rogen, but sadly not Evan Goldberg). I’m gonna focus on the Seth & Evan branch because the Fogel side is mostly just dicking around in an anti-cop but somehow might also be pro-cop kinda way.\n\nBefore that, lemme tell you about something I did when I was 17.\n\nBeing 17 is a period of time where you’re not technically an adult yet, but you still feel like you’re becoming an adult. I went through that, and one day I got bold & tried browsing sex toys in a Spencer’s Gifts. This particular Spencer’s had their sex toys out in the open, though still in the back. So my thought process was I could look at them, but if I tried to buy one they’d card me. So looking is all I did, for what felt like 15 minutes.\n\nThose 15 minutes were thrilling. I wasn’t quite an adult yet, but I fantasized about all the things I could do when I became one. The internet gave me a glimpse of all the things I could do, and I was almost at that point. I felt like I was at that point.\n\nThen a cashier asked if I was 18 and I sheepishly left in embarrassment. That was my one & only wake-up call to the fact that I was still a minor, and even today I’m a bit embarrassed by it.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Because Superbad reminded me that being a minor in adult spaces is fucking terrifying, and I am so glad I didn’t try to do anything worse.\n\nKids, don’t try to be an adult\n\nThere are a few major events that happen at this drinking party. First, people at this party recognize the felon, drag him outside, and kick the shit out of him. The boys use this as a distraction to steal booze, but Seth ends up getting sidetracked & dances with a girl. After a while, he finds out that girl is engaged, her fiancee catches him, and he threatens to kick the shit out of him.\n\nMeanwhile, Evan hides away in a side room because he’s starting to get disillusioned by this plan, but before he can leave he gets cornered by some guys who start doing hard drugs. He tries to sneak out, but they spot him and pressure him into singing.\n\nObviously it’s played up for comedy, but it’s a legitimately terrifying position to be in. When you’re a kid, it’s tempting to want to integrate yourself into adult actions, but the truth is you’re still not old enough, and those adult actions can have a lot more consequences than a child could understand. You can get dangerously sick, physically injured, even arrested for doing things or being in places you’re not supposed to.\n\nIt also reminded me that when I’m in adult spaces, I absolutely do not want any kids to be there. Because if you’re doing something that only an adult can do, having a kid present can get everyone into serious trouble; even if the kid showed up of their own accord. And things that are already illegal become a fuck of a lot more illegal if a kid is involved.\n\nIf you’re underage and reading this, or you have kids of your own, I cannot stress enough that trying to enter adult spaces is not worth it. Superbad is one of the best illustrations of this.\n\nAfter they get out of the party, with Seth stealing several forty’s worth in drained laundry soap bottles (gross), he gets pissed at Evan because he felt abandoned as they split off. It’s implied that they’ve been growing distant throughout the school year, and Evan’s especially getting annoyed because Seth’s been badmouthing the girl he’s been going after. Even more significant is Evan & Fogel are going to the same college & even becoming dorm mates without Seth, but they haven’t told him yet.\n\nAt this point, Fogel’s B-plot crashes right into Seth, and they all head to Jules’ party. Once there, despite being celebrated for providing booze, their ultimate plan of getting laid completely backfires.\n\nConsent has to be sober\n\nAt the party, Seth drinks himself shitfaced before approaching Jules. But once he’s wasted he finds out she’s totally sober and doesn’t drink at all. Seth cries his heart out over this, and in a drunken stupor accidentally headbutts her.\n\nMeanwhile Evan, who doesn’t want to exploit his love interest (named Becca), finds out she’s already wasted. So he gets himself drunk despite not really liking alcohol, and they both go into an empty room in the house where she throws up on the bed next to him.\n\nI like the contrast between these two. Seth’s convinces himself through insecurity that Jules would only like him if they were both drunk. While Evan isn’t really committed to getting laid, but ends up forcing himself to drink when he doesn’t want to, just so he can impress her. It’s not really about getting laid in the end, they just want to have some love life before they graduate. They just think “love life” equals sex, because they’re teenagers.\n\nUltimately neither of them get laid, and they leave the party as it gets raided by the same cops that tugged Fogel around.\n\n…okay I guess I can talk about the B-plot.\n\nIs this movie anti-cop or pro-cop?\n\nThe police depicted in this movie are… interesting. For most of the film they’re shown abusing power to run red lights, get better parking spots, and also showing general incompetence with distracted & drunk driving. At first it’s anti-cop, but near the end of the film, after they bust Jules’ party, they find Fogel and tell him they knew from the beginning his ID was fake. They explain at his age they hated cops despite becoming officers, and just wanted to show they could be cool too.\n\nWhich is a weird direction to go when the entire movie is spent showing just how shitty they are; especially since Fogel forgives them & even says they’re awesome. Hell, one of the cops is played by Seth Rogen, who wrote the damn movie. It’s just a weird both-sides play-it-safe approach, and probably the only part of the movie I’d call a flaw.\n\nWhat’s not a flaw is Seth & Evan’s conversation near the end.\n\nBros need love\n\nSeth takes Evan back to his house & they both crash on the floor. As they set up sleeping bags, Seth confesses he knew the whole time that Evan & Fogel were moving into the same dorm. He was just being a dick because he didn’t want to lose his best friend, and they both talk about how they love each other. It even goes into a speech about how weird it is that guys can’t say they love each other, and is just a genuinely heartfelt scene that perfectly ends an otherwise raunchy movie.\n\nBut it doesn’t end there. The next day, Seth & Evan run into their two crushes together. Jules has a bruise from when Seth headbutted her and is going makeup-shopping to cover it up. Meanwhile Evan’s crush (who I now realize I never said her name. It’s Becca), is shopping for the same thing Evan’s looking for. The four of them decide to split, with Seth & Jules going for makeup, and Evan & Becca going for college items. The movie ends there, showing they’re still on good terms even after the previous night.\n\nComing of age\n\nBefore I saw this movie I thought it was going to be a millennial Porky’s. I’ve never seen Porky’s, but I have a pretty good idea of what it entails. What I wasn’t expecting was a movie that made me look back at my own teenage life, and made me consider how I’d raise my own kids if I had any. It’s definitely crude & offensive, not something I’d watch as a family, but it’s definitely something I’d slip under a teenage boy’s bedroom door if he was having a sleepover.\n\nDo teenage boys have sleepovers?"
