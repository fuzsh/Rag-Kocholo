Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) want nothing more than to lose their virginity before they head off to college. To do that, though, they need to get liquor for the big party that night. With the help of their friend Fogell, a.k.a. McLovin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and his fake I.D., the three of them go on a hilarious chase for that elusive booze, dodging incompetent cops (Knocked Up's Seth Rogen and \"Saturday Night Live's\" Bill Hader), angry neighbors and jealous boyfriends.",

        "text": "The best of all of that eraâ€™s comedies, and one of the funniest teen movies ever\" (25th anniversary)\n\nAugust 26, 2022\n\nThe oftentimes outrageous dialogue and vulgar exchanges between stars Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are both wildly hilarious and genuinely portrayed.\n\nNovember 28, 2020\n\nAn intelligent and occasionally insightful look at the sometimes scary place we call the adolescent male mind.\n\nSeptember 24, 2020\n\nThere are enough laughs to make it worth your time. It may not be super good, but it is good enough.\n\nNovember 21, 2019\n\nYes, Superbad is a boy's story, so a certain perspective should be expected, and it's not the cheerful filth that bothers me, nor even the conventional morality; it's the paternalism.\n\nAugust 23, 2017\n\nSuperbad is a movie about partying and getting wasted and getting the girl, but as the night wears on, much wisdom is gained too, about self, friendship and the end of teenage innocence in all its wondrous, terrifying splendor.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
