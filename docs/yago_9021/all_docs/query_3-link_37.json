        "text": "Matrix and Jessica Jones actress Carrie-Anne Moss has joined Season 2 of Netflix‘s Arnold Schwarzenegger-led FUBAR, the streamer announced Monday.\n\nMoss will play Greta Nelso, a former East German spy who has a passionate history with Luke Brunner, Schwarzenegger’s veteran CIA operative who, before the series began, was on the verge of retirement.\n\n“After his last mission in saving another operative — who just so happened to be his daughter — Brunner’s back and face-to-face with new villains,” reads the action-comedy’s sophomore season description. “This one is an old flame from Luke’s past who threatens to destroy the world… if she doesn’t destroy his life first.”\n\nFUBAR’s Season 2 release date remains TBA, though the season will be comprised of eight 60-minute episodes.\n\nReturning alongside Schwarzenegger are Monica Barbaro (UnREAL), Fortune Feimster (The Mindy Project), Travis Van Winkle (YOU), Jay Baruchel (Man Seeking Woman), Aparna Brielle (A.P. Bio), Andy Buckley (The Office), Milan Carter (Warped!), Fabiana Udenio (Jane the Virgin) and Barbara Eve Harris (Prison Break).\n\nNick Santora is back as creator, showrunner and executive producer. Schwarzenegger also executive-produces, alongside Adam Higgs, Scott Sullivan, Phil Abraham, Amy Pocha, Seth Cohen and David Ellison."
