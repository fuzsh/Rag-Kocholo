        "text": "The following story contains spoilers for FUBAR Season 1 on Netflix.\n\nTHIS YEAR has already been a big year for spies and espionage on TV. We aren't even halfway through the 2023, and already we've seen The Night Agent and The Diplomat on Netflix, Rabbit Hole on Paramount+, and the mega-budgeted Citadel on Prime Video. Netflix's latest entry in this expansive field is FUBAR, an action/comedy that may not have a $300 million budget, but has something those other shows could only dream of: Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nThe 75-year-old movie icon leads FUBAR as super spy Luke Brunner to what it works absolutely best as: a True Lies-esque story that jumps from thrills to jokes and is never boring for even a minute. Schwarzenegger is cracking jokes just as often as he's kicking ass, and just as it worked throughout his career (and especially in the James Cameron-directed True Lies), it works here. FUBAR is a fun show that audiences will likely binge in only a handful of sittings at the most and not regret their choice one bit.\n\nIt also helps that FUBAR is filled with a number of faces that viewers will likely recognize from other popular watches. Much of FUBAR centers on Luke's relationship with his daughter, Emma, played by Top Gun: Maverick star Monica Barbaro. Her boyfriend, Carter, is played by Judd Apatow favorite Jay Baruchel, while Boro, the show's resident villain/crime lord is played by Schwarzenegger's Terminator: Dark Fate co-star Gabriel Luna (who audiences recently saw as Tommy in HBO's hit The Last of Us). They're all joined by Travis Van Winkle (from Netflix's You), Aparna Brielle (from Peacock's AP Bio), and Fortune Feimster (stand-up comedian) as Arnold's spy coworkers. In general, it's a fun time with a fun group of characters.\n\nBut when you're done making your way through the action and the laughs, there's going to be one more question: will FUBAR be back ASAP? Or is this show going to go MIA?\n\nWill there be a Season 2 of FUBAR?\n\nWe don't know for sure whether there will be a Season 2 of FUBAR just yet, but given the way Season 1 of the show ends (with a cliffhanger) and with the streamer's seemingly overwhelmingly positive relationship with Mr. Schwarzenegger—it also has a three-part documentary on his life coming out, and prominently featured him in a new marketing video—it seems very likely that the show will return for another go-around.\n\nThat said, it will always ultimately depend on the audience turning out. FUBAR seems likely to be liked, watched, and embraced by audiences, but stranger things have happened in the past. We will have to wait and see.\n\nWhen could we expect Season 2 of FUBAR to come out?\n\nFilming for Season 1 of FUBAR began in April 2022, in time for the show to be released in May 2023. So by that logic, if the show is a hit and gets a relatively quick season 2 pickup, we could expect to see Season 2 on Netflix about a year and change later.\n\nFall 2024 may be the optimistic timing for FUBAR Season 2.\n\nWhat would Season 2 of FUBAR be about?\n\nThere's lots to dive into for Season 2 of FUBAR, starting with the cliffhanger from the end of Season 1; Luke, Emma, and the rest of their close friends and family are all on the run after their identities were compromised. Luke declares it as the season comes to a close: It's FUBAR (meaning Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition).\n\nThat means Season 2 will likely be first and foremost about our heroes finding new identities and new missions in a brand new location.\n\nThere are more throughlines of FUBAR to consider for Season 2 as well, though. Just as the chaos broke out at the wedding, Luke had just professed his love for Tally, finally able to open himself up now that he was really retired. Except, whoops, seem like the job may have found him again. We'll see how that turns out (and if poor Donnie gets the short end of the stick again).\n\nThere's also the unresolved love triangle between Emma, Carter, and Alden. Who knows where that will go but it's likely to come up again. One relationship going well is that between Barry and Tiny, except... well, Tina was very mysteriously and sketchily talking to someone in Russian on the phone at the tail end of the Season 1 finale. So she's probably a mole and poor Barry is probably being played like a fiddle. Not cool, but it's a spy show after all.\n\nWho would be in the FUBAR Season 2 cast?\n\nWe could expect most of our primary FUBAR Season 1 cast to return for a potential Season 2. That means Arnold Schwarzenegger (as Luke), Monica Barbaro (as Emma), Jay Baruchel (as Carter), Fortune Feimster (as Roo), Travis Van Winkle (as Alden), Milan Carter (as Barry), Fabiana Udenio (as Tally), Andy Buckley (as Donnie), and Aparna Brielle (as Tina) are all likely to return. We could even expect special guest stars Tom Arnold (in a great True Lies reunion) and Adam Pally (in a very funny brief appearance) back in the same limited capacity.\n\nThe one person we can probably rule out from making a return, however, is Gabriel Luna as the villainous Boro, considering he got shot about 50 times (including one final time by Roo at close range) in the Season 1 finale. But he also survived a nuclear blast earlier in the episode, so all the Boro stans out there can hold out a sliver of hope if they really want to."
