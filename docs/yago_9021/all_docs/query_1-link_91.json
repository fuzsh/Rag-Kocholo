        "text": "Luke Brunner will be back for FUBAR season 2.\n\nFUBAR season 2 was confirmed at Netflix's most recent Tudum event and will be putting Arnold Schwarzenegger in the field again as the undercover CIA agent, Luke Brunner. Looks like he's not going to retire after all!\n\nFUBAR's first series saw Brunner forced to return to the field for one last job. On that mission, he ended up discovering that his own daughter, Emma (Monica Barbaro), was also an undercover operative, leading him to juggle being a father while trying to do his job.\n\nNews about FUBAR season 2 has been thin on the ground since the announcement, though we did just get a big bit of casting news, and we know that production was meant to have gotten underway recently. Here's what we know about FUBAR season 2 right now.\n\nWhat's new on Netflix this month\n\nAs of our latest update, we still don't know when FUBAR season 2 will land on Netflix. As and when we hear anything, we'll be sure to include it here.\n\nLead star Arnold Schwarzenegger underwent some heart surgery and had a pacemaker put in earlier this year, but he said on social media that this surgery would 'absolutely not' delay filming on the second season, which he said would get underway in April of this year.\n\nIf you're looking for more entertainment while you wait, Netflix followed FUBAR season 1 up with Arnold, a three-part documentary exploring the star's life and career.\n\nAnd if you're looking for more recommendations, check out our picks for the best shows on Netflix or the best comedies on Netflix we think you should be streaming right now.\n\nWhat will happen in FUBAR season 2?\n\nPlot details about the new season are still relatively thin on the ground, but FUBAR creator Nick Santora has teased that the second season is 'bananas' and told Tudum that the crew were 'coming up with some real fun surprised for FUBAR fans in Season 2, for sure' back in May.\n\n*spoilers for FUBAR season 1 ahead*\n\nThere are a couple of things coming in the second season. Santora let slip that Brunner and co will be dealing with the fact that Tina (Aparna Brielle) is secretly working undercover, stating \"In season 2, we're going to go in knowing there might be a rat in the kitchen. And what are they going to do about that?\"\n\nBesides the potential rat, we're also dealing with the fact that the team's secret identities have all been leaked, which will surely spell trouble for Luke, Emma and their fellow agents.\n\nFUBAR season 2 cast\n\nIn addition to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Monica Barbaro, FUBAR also stars Jay Baruchel, Aparna Brielle, Andy Buckley, Fortune Feimster, Barbara Eve Harris, Gabriel Luna, Fabiana Udenio, and Travis Van Winkle. In general, we'd expect the bulk of the supporting cast to return for the second season... with one major exception.\n\nWe're pretty confident we've seen the last of Gabriel Luna's (The Last Of Us) villain, Boro. After all, the last time we saw him he was gunned down by Emma and Luke in the season finale, so it seems pretty likely that Luke and the gang will be facing a new foe next time around.\n\nAs and when we learn more casting info for the new series, we'll be sure to include it here.\n\nThe latest addition to FUBAR season 2 is Carrie-Anne Moss (The Matrix, The Acolyte). She's joined the show as Greta Nelso, a new villain who is an East German spy... and an old flame of Brunner's who threatens both his life, and the wider world. (As reported by THR)\n\nIs there a FUBAR season 2 trailer?\n\nWe still haven't seen a trailer for FUBAR season 2 as of our most recent update. However, when the second season was confirmed, we were at least treated to a blooper reel featuring the cast showing their lighter side which you can enjoy while you wait for more info."
