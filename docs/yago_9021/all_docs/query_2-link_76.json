        "text": "“An infantile way for a man to spend his adult years,” sniffs Dr. Glatt (Eugene Levy), a pompous New England physician, when his son Doug (Seann William Scott) declares that a hockey enforcer, or goon, is his choice of occupation.\n\n“I’m stupid,” Doug replies. “For once in my life I get to wear a uniform that doesn’t have ‘security’ on it.”\n\nThis is the moment, midway in the film, when “Goon” reveals its true colors and turns from a rowdy sports farce into something vaguely resembling the “Rocky” of hockey movies. Until then it has presented a pungently realistic vision of an extremely violent and chaotic sport and the roughnecks who devote their lives to it.\n\nDirected by Michael Dowse (“It’s All Gone Pete Tong”) from a screenplay by Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg, the movie was inspired by the book “Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey,” by Doug Smith and Adam Frattasio.\n\nClearly, the film’s creators are intimately acquainted with every rank, sweat-stained crevice of the supermacho culture of professional hockey, its arcane rituals and its profane, combative style of male camaraderie. In almost every scene in the rink, fists fly, and blood is spilled, but the violence is no big deal; it goes with the job.\n\nDoug, who used to work as a bouncer at a bar in Orangetown, Mass., is recruited as a goon for the Halifax Highlanders after a scout observes him in a brawl at a local game. Doug has such weak ankles that he can hardly stand up on his skates in the beginning. But he has a knockout punch and a fist, one player says, “the size of my Uncle Murphy’s prostate.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
