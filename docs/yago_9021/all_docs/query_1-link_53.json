        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger and his action figure are giving fans an update about Netflix’s FUBAR season two.\n\nReleased on Netflix in 2023, season one of FUBAR stars Schwarzenegger as Luke Brunner, a CIA agent who is pulled back from the cusp of retirement when he is tasked with rescuing a secret government asset who is being held captive.\n\nWhen he arrives at the mission’s location, however, Luke is shocked to learn that the important asset he’s rescuing is his daughter, Emma Brunner (Top Gun: Maverick star Monica Barbaro), who is also a CIA agent.\n\nForbesHow Arnold Schwarzenegger Became A Billionaire\n\nSeason one of the dysfunctional family comedy action-adventure series also stars Milan Carter, Jay Baruchel, Fortune Feimster, Travis Van Winkle, Fabia Udenio and Gabriel Luna.\n\nTo promote FUBAR season two, the action movie legend paired up with the mini-Arnold for a video announcement from Netflix on Monday. In the video, which was posted on X, Schwarzenegger is quoted as saying, “Get to the choppa! FUBAR season two is now in production and it's gonna be really, really, really big.”\n\n“Get to the choppa!” of course is one of Schwarzenegger's famous catch-phrases from his action film days—along with ‘I’ll be back!’—and it made a comeback in the actor’s appearance in a Super Bowl 2024 commercial for State Farm.\n\nThe ‘FUBAR’ Season 2 Promo Highlights The World’s Biggest Action Figure\n\nIn the FUBAR promo spot, Arnold Schwarzenegger holds up his action figure close to the camera and says, “This is not Kindergarten Cop. This is Luke Brunner.”\n\nFrom there, the action figure becomes the subject of different scenes as it flies through the air and rides on and drives vehicles while Schwarzenegger notes, “This is the smallest Arnold ever but FUBAR season two is going to be the biggest.”\n\nAnd Schwarzenegger isn’t kidding, as a time-lapse video puts together what the showbiz icon declares “is the biggest action figure ever built.” He said that the upscaled version of the 5.52-inch tall Scwharzenegger action figure is—according to The Guinness Book of World Records—“the biggest in world history” at 22.14 feet in height.\n\nThe mini-Arnold then takes a drone ride up to the top of the big figure so it can stand atop big Arnold’s left shoulder.\n\nForbesWhat Made 'Baby Reindeer' A Hit? Netflix's CEO Has Thoughts\n\nSchwarzenegger isn’t the only one having fun in the FUBAR season two promo. Series co-star Fortune Feimster also appears in the video and she appropriately yells while imitating Schwarzenegger’s distinct Austrian accent, “Bigger! It’s better than ever! Now get to the Netflix! Let’s go!”\n\nFUBAR season one marked the first of two high-profile original projects Schwarzenegger teamed with Netflix on in 2023. A couple weeks after FUBAR premiered, Netflix released the original three-part documentary Arnold, which in three stages chronicles Schwarzenegger’s life as a bodybuilder, an actor and a politician as the governor of California.\n\nFUBAR season two is still awaiting a release date. There’s no word of whether Netflix is going to merchandise a Schwarzenegger FUBAR action figure."
