        "text": "“Stuber” and “Goon” helmer Michael Dowse has been set to direct the movie adaptation of the “Just Cause” video game series for Constantin Film. He joins “John Wick” creator Derek Kolstad who will pen the script.\n\nOver 26 million copies of the games have sold worldwide and follow Rico Rodriguez (aka. Scorpio), a CIA operative and occasional freelance mercenary who specialises in ‘regime-change’ operations. In each game, you overthrow the despotic dictatorship of an entire nation – the first in the Caribbean, the second in Micronesia, the third in the Mediterranean and the fourth in South America.\n\nThe games boast massive open world sandbox environments where almost everything is destructible and you have a high powered grappling hook, retractable parachute and more. The aim of the game is essentially to blow up as much as you can and cause chaos, while the tone starts out as a 1980s action blockbuster and gets increasingly ridiculous.\n\nKolstad, Robert Kulzer and Adrian Askarieh will produce the film which is expected to include the game’s regular antagonists – the lethal mercenary group the Black Hand."
