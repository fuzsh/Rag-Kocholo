Our Film and Performing Arts editor looks at this year's nominees, makes a couple of predictions, and wonders aloud why only technically three of the Best Feature nominees have actually been released in theatres.\n\nThe Best TIFF Canada’s Top 10 Yet\n\nThink 2013 was a weak year for Canadian cinema? Think again because most of the best work from this past year is merely being sat on for release this year. Our Film Editor looks at this year's TIFF Canada's Top Ten (kicking off this weekend) and the finest line-up of Canada's best to date.\n\nTIFF 2013: The F Word Review\n\nThe F Word Special Presentation Director: Michael Dowse While not the most original take on best friends becoming lovers, the latest film from Dowse (Goon, Fubar) has charm in spades, largely thanks to snappy banter delivered by two perfectly cast leads. Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) has recently crawled out from under his yearlong funk following a […]\n\nInterview: Don McKellar\n\nDork Shelf talks to director and actor Don McKellar about his return to feature film directing with The Grand Seduction (debuting Sunday September 8th at TIFF) and about how people perceived his time away from filmmaking, the script that tempted him to come back, shooting on location in Trinity Bay, the different stresses between city filming and country filming, and what Gleeson brought to his role and to the set.\n\nThis Week in DVD: 5/29/12\n\nWhat We Talk About When We Need to Talk About We Need to Talk About Kevin, Goon, and the second season of Rookie Blue.\n\nInterview: Seann William Scott\n\nWrapping up a week's worth of Goon coverage, Dork Shelf talks to Goon star Seann William Scott about why Doug \"The Thug\" Glatt was less of a challenge than playing Stiffler a fourth time, what it's like to finally get into hockey after never playing as a kid, and his deep and almost nerdy love of movies.\n\nInterview: Liev Schreiber\n\nDork Shelf catches up with Goon actor Liev Schreiber and talks about the extensive preparation required to become a hockey player on film, learning how to fight on ice, and his earliest memories of the game."
