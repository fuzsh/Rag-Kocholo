        "text": "EOne has released the UK trailer for Michael Dowse’s What If, the film formerly known as The F Word.\n\nThe film is the story of a unlucky in love guy whose friends are all in long-term relationships. When he strikes up an amazing friendship with a girl he wonders if perhaps they could be more…\n\nDaniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan star as the central pair, with support from Adam Driver, Megan Park, and Mackenzie Davis.\n\nWhat If is out in Ireland on August 20th.\n\nWhat If is the funny, feel-good story of Wallace, who’s been repeatedly burned by bad relationships. So while everyone around him, including his roommate Allan, seems to be finding the perfect partner, Wallace decides to put his love life on hold. It is then that he meets Chantry, an animator who lives with her long term boyfriend Ben.\n\nActing with the best of intentions and a touch of denial, Wallace and Chantry take on the challenge of being just friends. The adventure is both rocky and very funny as our protagonists navigate the perils of unintended nude camping, risqué wardrobe malfunctions and generally terrible advice from their friends."
