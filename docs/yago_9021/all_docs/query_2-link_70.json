The feature will be written by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad.\n\nRELATED: Production Begins on Tom Holland’s Uncharted Film!\n\nAvalanche Studios and Square Enix’s video game series follows the adventures of Rico Rodriguez, an operative for a fictional U.S. covert agency sent to destabilize and overthrow oppressive regimes. The series’ name stems from the real-life United States invasion of Panama, code-named “Operation Just Cause.” Rodriguez has become one of the few Latino iconic video game characters.\n\nThe plot of the film is being kept under wraps, though the outlet reports the movie will follow Rodriguez on a race-against-time mission to stop the Black Hand, a lethal mercenary group.\n\nRELATED: My Friend Pedro: John Wick Creator Adapting Video Game Into a Series"
