        "text": "Thelma Schoomaker would make Oscars history this year with a fourth win for Best Film Editing thanks to her stellar work in Martin Scorsese‘s “Killers of the Flower Moon.”\n\nSchoomaker and Scorsese have been collaborators since the beginning of both of their careers and the partnership between them has been a fruitful one. Eight of Schoonmaker’s nine Academy Award nominations have come for Scorsese movies. The exception was her first bid, for “Woodstock” in 1970. After that, she amassed eight bids for Scorsese and clocked up three Best Film Editing victories. They were for “Raging Bull” in 1981, “The Aviator” in 2005, and “The Departed” in 2007.\n\nSchoonmaker was also nominated for “Goodfellas” in 1991, “Gangs of New York” in 2003, “Hugo” in 2012, and “The Irishman” in 2020. She is nominated again this year for “Killers of the Flower Moon” alongside Laurent Sénéchal (“Anatomy of a Fall”), Kevin Tent (“The Holdovers”), Jennifer Lame (“Oppenheimer“), and Yorgos Mavropsaridis (“Poor Things”). If she were to win this award, she would become the most decorated editor in Oscars history with four victories. Currently, she is tied on three wins with three other editors.\n\nRalph Dawson won for “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” in 1936, “Anthony Adverse” in 1937, and “The Adventures of Robin Hood” in 1939. Daniel Mandell won for “The Pride of the Yankees” in 1943, “The Best Years of Our Lives” in 1947, and “The Apartment” in 1961. And Michael Kahn, who is known for his longtime collaboration with another auteur, Steven Spielberg, also claimed three Best Film Editing Oscars. They were for “Raiders of the Lost Ark” in 1982, “Schindler’s List” in 1994, and “Saving Private Ryan” in 1999. Dawson has the best conversion rate, winning his three awards from four nominations, while Mandell won three out of five and Kahn has won three out of eight. Schoonmaker has won three out of nine, with the ninth nomination pending.\n\nSchoonmaker is already the most nominated editor in Oscars history. Her “Killers of the Flower Moon” bid took her one above Kahn, who was last nominated in 2013 for “Lincoln.” Schoonmaker would also be the oldest winner in this category at 84 years old. The current record also happens to be Kahn, who was 68 for that “Lincoln” bid.\n\nCurrently, Schoonmaker is in joint third place in our Oscars odds chart for Best Film Editing with “The Holdovers” and “Poor Things.” “Anatomy of a Fall” is in second place while “Oppenheimer” is in first place. “Oppenheimer” cutter Lame won Best Editing at both the Critics Choice Awards and the BAFTAs, making her the clear favorite. However, the ACE Eddies have yet to have their say in the editing race just yet. Schoonmaker is nominated there against Lame for Best Drama Editing. The winner of that race could have a big say in the Oscars result but, so far, it does look like Schoonmaker will have to wait until another year to become the most decorated editor of all time.
