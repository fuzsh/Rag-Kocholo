        "text": "Article content\n\nBehind every successful man there is a woman.\n\nIn Martin Scorsese’s case, her name is Thelma Schoonmaker.\n\nA three-time Oscar winner, Schoonmaker has been Scorsese’s film editor for 50 years, from his very first feature and on to Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street, among many others. Their latest collaboration is Silence, Scorsese’s powerful drama about Jesuit missionaries risking their lives in 17th century Japan. Starring Liam Neeson, Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield, Silence is an examination of faith based on Shusaku Endo's 1966 novel; the film was nearly three decades in the making and is a labour of love for Scorsese and Schoonmaker.\n\nSilence comes out March 28 on Blu-ray. It seemed like a good time to catch up with Schoonmaker on her working relationship with Martin Scorsese, which has lasted longer than any of his five marriages. Put together.\n\nHow did your work relationship begin?\n\n“I knew nothing about editing when I met Mr. Scorsese... Through a series of weird events I ended up at New York University and there was Martin Scorsese, and he had some troubles with a film I was able to fix. That’s the only reason I became a filmmaker. Gradually, over the years, our collaboration changed from student to real collaborator, so that now, it’s just an equal partnership. He says he relies on me heavily to bring out the humanity of his movies. But he’s the one who put the humanity in there [Laughs].”\n\nWhich of your films together presented the biggest challenges?\n\n“Silence, I think, was the hardest, because it’s so different from everything we’ve done before and required very delicate handling, and trying to find the right meditative pace… I love it dearly and wish I was still working on it.\n\n“Departed had a lot of structural problems, and we had to solve those in the editing room by trying all kinds of dramatic things.\n\n“Raging Bull was just a dream to work on, but it took a lot of work to get all those fights to work right and incorporate them properly into the story.”\n\nRaging Bull left me in a daze for weeks. I’d never seen anything like it.\n\n“Neither had we! It was pure gold in my hands, that movie. Pure gold. Every frame was extraordinary. And if I’m forced to say, which was the most important film, that’s it. Because it was my first major feature film. And my God! What was I looking at every day? A masterpiece.”\n\nIs it fair to say Mr. Scorsese’s spiritual ideas are in all his films?\n\n“Marty has always had a deep interest in religion. Not in the traditional way … in the closeness of the editing room, I’ve come to know how religious he is, in his own way. In Silence, he’s been able to actually put that up on the screen. And it was so exhilarating and emotional to share that with him, to see him finally able to outright tackle the subject. He wants to do more films that deal with spirituality, shall we say, which is very important for our culture right now, I think. He never wants to preach. He wants to make you feel, and maybe think about spiritual things.\n\n“Just to explore that part of yourself.”\n\nTwitter: @LizBraunSun"
