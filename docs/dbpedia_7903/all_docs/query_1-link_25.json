I'm Terry Gross.\n\nToday we have some stories behind classic Martin Scorsese movies. Thelma\n\nSchoonmaker has won two Oscars for her film editing, one for \"Raging Bull,\"\n\nthe other for \"The Aviator.\" She also edited each of the films Scorsese made\n\nbetween those two. I spoke with her in 2005, shortly after the release of\n\n\"The Aviator\" and the 25th anniversary DVD edition of \"Raging Bull.\"\n\nSchoonmaker's late husband was the British film director Michael Powell. He\n\nmade \"The Red Shoes,\" \"Black Narcissus,\" \"The Life and Death of Colonel\n\nBlimp,\" \"Peeping Tom,\" and many other films.\n\nThelma Schoonmaker, welcome to FRESH AIR. Now, you worked with Martin\n\nScorsese on his very first film--I think he was still a student when he made\n\n\"Who's That Knocking On My Door?\"--but then you didn't team up with him again\n\nuntil \"Raging Bull.\" \"Raging Bull\"'s out on DVD. It's one of the--like, the\n\nlandmark films in American filmmaking. How did you end up working with him on\n\n\"Raging Bull,\" reuniting with him after a period of, what, 10 years in\n\nbetween?\n\nMs. THELMA SCHOONMAKER: Right. I wasn't in the union in New York or LA,\n\nand--the editors union--so I couldn't work for Marty when he went to bust into\n\nHollywood. He kept calling me and asking me to come and work with him, but\n\nI--the union wouldn't let me, so--they had very restrictive policies then.\n\nYou had to serve long apprenticeships, and then you had to serve another long\n\nstretch of time as an assistant before you were allowed to be an editor. And\n\nby that time, we had made \"Woodstock.\" I was the supervising editor of\n\n\"Woodstock.\" I had been nominated for an Oscar. And I just didn't feel I had\n\nto go back and become an apprentice in order to be able to work for Marty and\n\nspend seven years before I could work for him, anyway. So I couldn't do it,\n\nand he started working with Marcia Lucas, who was also the wife of George\n\nLucas. And he kept calling me, but every time I couldn't do it. So I worked\n\non documentaries about the American Revolution for WQED in Pittsburgh. I did\n\na little short film for Paul McCartney on his world tour. And, finally, on\n\n\"Raging Bull,\" Marty called me, and I said, `You know I can't work for you.'\n\nAnd he said, `Well, we got you in the union.' And I never asked how, but\n\nshortly after that the union did open up their--the doors to a more liberal\n\npolicy.\n\nGROSS: So to this day you don't know how he got you in the union?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: No. I don't ask.\n\nGROSS: So did you have any idea what you were in for with \"Raging Bull,\" how\n\ninteresting and complex the editing was going to be?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: I had no idea. I had always worked in a rather small,\n\nindependent film environment or on documentaries, which were very critical, by\n\nthe way, for the editing of \"Raging Bull,\" because documentaries teach you how\n\nto take unshaped footage and create a story out of it, which I had to do with\n\nsome of the wonderful improvisations between De Niro and Joe Pesci. So I had\n\nno idea what a big, major studio film was like. And when I went out to\n\nHollywood, there were assistants and things that I had never experienced\n\nbefore. I had always put my own trims away, and suddenly there was this big\n\nsort of studio system, and I--post-production system, and I said to Marty,\n\n`You know, I've never done this kind of thing before.' And he said, `Don't\n\nworry, I'll be there with you. I've been through it.' So he--that was good to\n\nknow.\n\nBut I had no idea the raw power of the footage that was going to land into my\n\nhands. In my Oscar speech, I said it was like having pure gold to work on,\n\nand it really was. That film is burned into the screen. The crew, on the\n\nother hand, was a bit baffled by the film. They couldn't understand why so\n\nmuch time was being spent on a man who seemed to be so unpleasant. And so\n\nwhen I would meet the crew on their way back from shooting, they would say,\n\n`Oh, wait till you see what we shot today. We don't get this at all.' But I\n\nwas seeing in the editing room, already, how amazing it was. And often\n\nScorsese does not put into his scripts what he has in his head, so when they\n\nsaw the film put together, they were--they saw it then. They were stunned.\n\nBut I was seeing it, already, just so alive in my hands. It was astounding.\n\nGROSS: Now, you mention that you had to do a lot of shaping in the editing\n\nroom of the improvisatory scenes between De Niro and Joe Pesci. Can you talk\n\na little bit about what the raw footage was like and how you shaped those\n\nscenes?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Well, the--Joe Pesci had not done much work before in\n\nfilms. He had been in one film, I think, which De Niro saw and brought to\n\nshow Marty, and that's why they decided to cast him. And--but De Niro, of\n\ncourse, had done quite a few films by then, and he was wonderfully helpful to\n\nJoe Pesci in the improvisations because he would look over at Marty, and Marty\n\nwould give him a little look, saying, `Do it again.' And Bob would start the\n\nimprovisation over again and again and again until Marty got exactly what he\n\nfelt he needed out of Joe Pesci's performance. And Pesci is such a fertile\n\nimproviser, and he and De Niro would just kick each other off.\n\nWhat you want to do in a situation like that, when you have two actors who are\n\ngoing you don't know where--it's not scripted--is to have two cameras shooting\n\nat all times because--so you can capture the actors' responses to this new\n\nsort of tangent they're going off on. But sometimes in the locations Marty\n\nwas shooting in--in the Bronx, in real houses, like the ones that Jake LaMotta\n\nwould have lived in--he couldn't get two cameras in the room, so that was the\n\ntime when--for me, it was--I had to try and figure out a way to take two\n\ndifferent sessions of great improvisations, one on camera and one off, and try\n\nand make it work together, dramatically.\n\n*****End of Cheryl B.'s proofing\n\nThe most obvious example of that is the kitchen scene, where De Niro is\n\nhassling this wife about bringing him a cup of coffee. The babies are crying,\n\nand Joe Pesci's trying to get him to agree to fight a fighter that he doesn't\n\nwant to fight. And Marty based that whole scene on the way his agent used to\n\nexplain his deals to him in Hollywood, because he could never understand the\n\npercentage this, the that, the--he could never--and he always used to say,\n\n`Tell me again. Tell me again.' And so that was what he said to De Niro, and\n\nDe Niro then kept, you know, not understanding what his brother is telling him\n\nand making him repeat it over and over again.\n\nIt was a wonderful improvisation, but it was very hard to make hang together\n\ndramatically. I had a hell of a lot of fun working on it because, again, my\n\ndocumentary background, having been handed large amounts of footage that\n\nneeded to be shaped into a story, helped me immensely.\n\nGROSS: Why don't we hear that scene? And this is from the new DVD release,\n\nthe 25th anniversary release, of \"Raging Bull.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"Raging Bull\")\n\nMr. ROBERT DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Don't ever do that Janiro\n\nbull...(censored) again. No more deals like that. You hear what I'm saying?\n\nMr. JOE PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) What are you talking about?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) What am I talking about? Look at that, 168\n\npounds.\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) Stop eating.\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) What's this little smart-ass? I told you I\n\ndidn't want to do it in the first place. Didn't I tell you that?\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) No, you didn't say that. You're the one that\n\ntold me you could get down to 155 pounds. Where'd I get it? What? Did I\n\npull it out of the (censored) air?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) I don't know if I'm going to make it down to\n\n155. I'm lucky I make it to 160. And on top of that, you sign me for a fight\n\nat 155, and if I don't make the 155, I lose $15,000.\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) That's right.\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Oh! You're supposed to be a manager. You're\n\nsupposed to know what you're doing.\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) I did just what I wanted to do.\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) That's what I'm worried about. You did it...\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) You want a title shot?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) What are you talking about?\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) Do you want a title shot?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) What is--what am I? What am I? In the\n\ncircus over here? I ask him, he's got more sense about this. What are you\n\ndoing?\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) You've been killing yourself for three years\n\nnow, right? There's nobody left for you to fight. Everybody's afraid to\n\nfight you. OK, along comes this kid, Janiro. He don't know any better. He's\n\na young kid, up and coming. He'll fight anybody. Good. You fight him. Bust\n\nhis hole. Tear him apart, right? What are you worried about? What's the\n\nbiggest thing you got to worry about? The weight?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) I'm worried about the weight.\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) You're worried about the weight?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) What are we arguing about it for? I just\n\nsaid the weight.\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) OK, let's say you lose because of your weight.\n\nAre they going to think you're not as tough as you are, you're not the same\n\nfighter? Good. They'll match you with all those guys they were afraid to\n\nmatch you with before. What happens? You'll kill them. And they got to give\n\nyou a title shot.\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Bring me coffee, please.\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) Why? There's nobody else. Nobody's left. Who\n\nthey going to give it to?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Coffee.\n\nMs. CATHY MORIARTY: (As Vickie LaMotta): In a minute.\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) Are you listening to me?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Please, honey, bring me a coffee, huh?\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) All right?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Hey, how long I got to wait?\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) Are you listening?\n\nMs. MORIARTY: (As Vickie LaMotta) I don't know.\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) Now let's say you win, you beat Janiro...\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Yeah.\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) ...which is definitely--you should beat\n\nhim--Right?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Yeah.\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) Right?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Yeah.\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) They still got to give you a shot at the title.\n\nYou know why?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Why?\n\nMr. PESCI: (As Joey LaMotta) Because of the same things before; there's\n\nnobody left. There ain't nobody around. They gotta give you the shot. You\n\nunderstand? If you win, you win. If you lose, you still win. There's no way\n\nyou can lose. And you do it on your own, just the way you wanted to do,\n\nwithout any help from anybody. Understand? Just get down to 155 pounds, you\n\nfat bastard. You stop eating.\n\n(End of soundbite)\n\nGROSS: A scene from \"Raging Bull\" with Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro. My\n\nguest, Thelma Schoonmaker, was the editor of \"Raging Bull.\" She won an Oscar\n\nfor her editing on that. And she's worked with Martin Scorsese on every\n\nsubsequent film that he's made. And, by the way, \"Casino\" and \"The Aviator\"\n\nhave just come out on DVD.\n\nThelma Schoonmaker, in an improvisatory scene like that, would you ever\n\nconsult the actors--you know, De Niro and Pesci, in this case--and ask them\n\nwhat was going through their minds when they did certain things? Would that\n\nbe a helpful thing to know?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: I didn't--no, I didn't need that. It was quite clear in\n\nthe footage what I should try and get to work. There's one wonderful moment,\n\nI'll just tell you about in the improvisations, where the wife, played by\n\nTheresa Saldana, of Joe Pesci says--tries to defend her sister-in-law and\n\nsays, `She didn't mean nothing.' And Joe Pesci just turns to her and says,\n\n`Who asked you?' It's just one of the great laugh scenes in the film because\n\nit's so outrageous, and that was completely an improv. She spoke up,\n\nunscripted, and Joe's reaction--the timing of the head turn is so wonderful,\n\nthe pause before the line is so perfect.\n\nOf course, comic lines are built out of beats. You know, waiting just a\n\nmoment or two can make the line funnier. My husband always used to say that\n\nabout silent films. They had almost mathematical counts that the comedians\n\nused to do with each other. Gracie Allen, I understand, also used to do that.\n\nYou wait two beats before you answer, and that makes it funnier.\n\nGROSS: Of course, you could ruin that in the editing. You could take out\n\nthose two beats if you wanted to.\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Yeah. Well, you can make an actor sometimes look not as\n\ngood or make them look even better, depending on how you edit their footage.\n\nThat's why it's such a wonderful job. You get to shape things and build\n\ndrama, build rhythm, build pacing.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Academy Award-winning film editor, Thelma Schoonmaker.\n\nShe's edited each of Martin Scorsese's movies from \"Raging Bull\" on, with the\n\nexception of Scorsese's documentary on Dylan. We'll talk more after a break.\n\nThis is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Thelma Schoonmaker. She's edited each of Martin\n\nScorsese's movies from \"Raging Bull\" on, with the exception of his documentary\n\nabout Dylan. Let's talk about the climactic fight scene in \"Raging Bull.\"\n\nMartin Scorsese had that pretty thoroughly storyboarded before he shot it?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: He did, and we did start out with exactly the way he had\n\nstoryboarded all these amazing shots. But then we began fooling around with\n\nit and, during the process of editing, discovering that, for example, when\n\nVickie puts her head down into her hands--his wife's sitting in the audience\n\nwatching this massacre. When she puts her head down in her hands and then\n\nwhen she picks her head up were key moments to hang the whole construction of\n\nthe montage around. So things like that, that you don't expect, occur when\n\nyou get footage that's been shot, and so you sometimes have to change things a\n\nlittle bit. We did violate the initial structure of the storyboard. We\n\nworked on it for a very long time. And some--we even put one shot in upside\n\ndown. But...\n\nGROSS: What shot was that, and why did you do that?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: It's a shot of the legs--De Niro's legs buckling. It just\n\nworked better that way. I don't know. And so it was a wonderful montage to\n\nwork on. And Scorsese...\n\nGROSS: And is--wait--is that almost subliminal, that shot? I mean, does it\n\ngo by so quickly that you don't notice it?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Yeah. Yes, it does. It goes by very quickly, yeah. He\n\nhad actually his trainer on his shoulder when he was doing those shots of the\n\nknees, so that he would actually have that great weight on his shoulders. And\n\nit helped him when he was, you know, buckling from the pounding he's taking\n\nfrom Sugar Ray. But Marty had wonderful ideas in that film. For example,\n\nwhen we--the fighter who is beating De Niro to a pulp, Sugar Ray--playing the\n\ncharacter Sugar Ray Robinson--can't understand why he won't go down. Of\n\ncourse, LaMotta--Jake LaMotta--was famous for never going down. He could take\n\nany amount of punishment and never go down.\n\nThe--Sugar Ray backs away and tries to figure out what the hell is going on,\n\nand Marty had this wonderful shot where the lights dim and a complete silence\n\noccurs on the track. Our sound editor suggested that to us. He said, `Taking\n\nsound away, often, is much more powerful than bringing it in.' So we took the\n\nsound away, the lights darkened down, and Sugar Ray just stands there\n\nbreathing like an animal. You hear animal sounds of breathing, which our\n\nwonderful sound editor, Frank Warner, put in.\n\nAnd then he decides to come back in for another attack, and as he does that,\n\nthe camera ramps back up to normal speed again. And we cut to a smashing shot\n\nof the glove hitting De Niro's head. Beautiful directing, beautiful\n\nconception.\n\nGROSS: What's an example of something that you had never tried before, never\n\nreally thought of before, until editing \"Raging Bull\"?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Well, I think the...\n\nGROSS: Probably everything you've just told us, but...\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Yeah, it's...\n\nGROSS: Come to think of it.\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Well, it's such a rich film. You know, I--when I talk to\n\nstudents, I just put the film on and I start talking about it. There's so\n\nmuch I can--I could talk for seven years about it, I think. Anyway, I would\n\nsay that the--Scorsese had designed the fight so beautifully. Each fight is\n\ndifferent. The size of the ring is different in each fight, depending on the\n\nemotional state of Jake's mind. For example, the first time he knocks down\n\nSugar Ray, which was a great triumph, the ring is large and sweeping and\n\nbrightly lit. And when he loses a fight on a technical decision, which he\n\ncan't understand, the ring is filled with smoke and dark and murky. And\n\nScorsese shot it with flames below the lens, so that there's a mirage-like\n\nfeeling, a kind of queasy, nauseous feeling throughout. When De Niro goes and\n\nsits down in a corner, there's a rope in front of his eyes, so you can't see\n\nhis face. All these things contribute to this incredible evocation of his\n\nbefuddlement about why he lost this fight.\n\nSo Scorsese had such a strong conception for all of these fights, and the\n\nfootage was so brilliantly shot. You have no idea how hard it is to do\n\nextremely difficult camera moves in a ring when you have two fighters and a\n\nreferee moving around constantly in the ring, and try and be in the ring with\n\nthem shooting--extremely difficult.\n\nThat was Scorsese's commitment from day one. He had looked at every boxing\n\nfilm ever made, and the thing he noticed about most of them is that the camera\n\nwas outside of the ring, of course, because it's so hard to shoot in. But he\n\nwanted to be in the ring, and he almost always is. I don't know how they did\n\nthese shots. It took six weeks to shoot the fights in a studio in California.\n\nGROSS: Were you on the set during the shooting of \"Raging Bull\"? As a rule,\n\ndo you like to be on the set when Scorsese's shooting?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: I tend not to like--I love to go to the set to watch Marty\n\nand the actors and the crew, many of whom are old friends. We've worked\n\ntogether on so many films together. But I do find it prejudices my eye. My\n\njob, I think, is to sit in dailies with Scorsese every night, and he wants to\n\nknow my reaction. Do I believe something? Is there something wrong? Is\n\nthere something I don't understand? And if I go on the set and people say to\n\nme, `Oh, gosh, wait till you see this shot. We just laid 20 feet of track,\n\nand we're going to crane up here and'--then I don't get the same feeling about\n\nit if I see it being made as I do when I see it on the screen.\n\nGROSS: Let's talk a little bit about \"The Aviator.\" Can you talk about the\n\nscene that you found most challenging or most interesting to work on in \"The\n\nAviator\"?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: I loved all the ensemble acting scenes in the nightclubs\n\nand the rapid-fire patter that Scorsese wanted to have, which was very much\n\nlike the way scenes were shot those days in Hollywood, a lot of very clever\n\ndialogue.\n\nThe overlapping dialogue was--normally it would be considered a problem, but\n\nhe shot it that way. He wanted everybody to be talking on top of each other\n\nas part of the style of the film, and that can be alarming for an editor.\n\nUsually actors are not allowed to overlap each other because the editor cannot\n\nget in with--and make cuts in between the dialogue then. But this was\n\nall--this worked out amazingly. We only had to loop a couple of lines.\n\nSo the biggest challenge was the scenes of Howard going mad in his screening\n\nroom, and that took a long time of living with it, living with different edits\n\nand, finally, towards the end, going with a very kinetic, emotional approach\n\nto it and just slashing into the footage and picking out of it just what made\n\nme feel something for Howard and putting it together not in a linear way, but\n\njust an emotional way. So when that suddenly happened, it was great.\n\nSomething just clicked, and we knew we were finished with it. But it took a\n\nwhile to arrive at that approach because there was a lot of footage in there\n\nof him going mad. And we found we had to condense it to make it work within\n\nthe body of the film.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. Hughes was obsessive-compulsive, and in this mad scene at the\n\nend, I mean, you know, he has to figure out what angle to hold the milk bottle\n\nso he doesn't contaminate it. And there's just, like, a spotlight on these\n\nmilk bottles because he's--you're just kind of seeing it from his point of\n\nview, I guess. And it's--I mean, he's become so compulsive about germs and\n\neverything that he--there's no longer anything that he can touch or eat. And\n\nso did you have, like, a whole array of different examples of this\n\nobsessive-compulsive disorder and have to choose between those examples?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Yes. Marty had originally thought he would do a lot of his\n\nmemos--Hughes' insane memos to his employees. For example, when he was\n\nreceiving reports from detectives who were following his girlfriends, the\n\ndetective had to stand at the bottom of the office building, and his reports\n\nwere winched up on a rope, so that his physical presence would not be anywhere\n\nnear anyone in the building. I mean, he--it was insane, the kind of things\n\nthat he would write to his employees. And we had a lot more of those in\n\noriginally, but we found that within the entire length of the film, we had to\n\ncut them down to something very short. But they are amazing. I mean, you\n\ncould read them forever, they're...\n\nAt the same time he was able to make quite sane business decisions. He was\n\nrunning huge companies, and he was able to do both at the same time. You see\n\nin the film that he pulls himself out of his madness in order to defend\n\nhimself in front of the Senate. That's all very true. There's actual video\n\nfootage of him there triumphing and turning the tables on the corrupt senator\n\nwho's opposing him.\n\nGROSS: Film editor Thelma Schoonmaker. We'll continue the interview in the\n\nsecond half of the show. I'm Terry Gross and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: Coming up, the give and take between director and editor. We continue\n\nour conversation with film editor Thelma Schoonmaker about editing the films\n\nof Martin Scorsese. And she'll tell us about her late husband, the British\n\nfilm director Michael Powell, whom she met through Scorsese.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with film editor Thelma\n\nSchoonmaker. She won an Oscar for editing Martin Scorsese's film \"Raging\n\nBull,\" and has edited each of his films since then, with the exception of his\n\ndocumentary about Dylan. She won her second Oscar for \"The Aviator.\"\n\nWhat's the give and take like between you and Scorsese when you're in the\n\nediting room?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Well, you know, we're almost of one mind at this point.\n\nScorsese taught me everything I ever knew about editing when I worked on his\n\nfirst film and in the years after that. I never thought I would become an\n\neditor. He was born a director; I'm sure he came out of the womb a director.\n\nI've never met anyone more completely a director than him. And so he's taught\n\nme everything I know; our taste is the same, therefore, I know what he likes\n\nand what he doesn't like. And if we have a severe disagreement, we screen it\n\none way and ask our friends how they feel about it and then screen it the\n\nother way. But that rarely happens.\n\nIt happened at the end of \"Raging Bull,\" because when De Niro is confronting\n\nhimself in the mirror, Scorsese felt very strongly that it had to be a cold\n\nperformance. And he and De Niro had laid down 15 takes, each one of them\n\ncompletely valid, each one of them different in warmth or coldness. And\n\nScorsese kept sort of striving to get it colder and colder. And he thought\n\nthat take 15 was the best take and De Niro and I felt maybe a slightly warmer\n\none. And so we screened it both ways, and, of course, Marty was absolutely\n\nright. We ended up with the one he wanted. But, frankly, that hardly ever\n\nhappens.\n\nWe work very compatibly. We're very different. I'm very optimistic and calm\n\nand patient, and Marty is emotional and dramatic. We balance each other. And\n\nso we have a lot of fun in the editing room. We joke and talk and share all\n\nkinds of things, our love of Michael Powell's films, for example. And he\n\nalways has on, in the corner of the room, Turner Classic Movies with the\n\nlatest classic movie running silent and--so it doesn't interfere. And every\n\nonce in a while we'll look over, and he'll say, `Oh, look at this great shot.\n\nOh, look what this director did here,' or--we never have the sound up, by the\n\nway. It's all visual. And so this constant infusion of inspiration from\n\nother films is always going on in his mind. And I think I have the best job\n\nin the world. And I'm sure there are a lot of editors who would like to shoot\n\nme, so they could have him instead of me.\n\nGROSS: You mentioned that film--the scene in \"Raging Bull\" where De Niro's in\n\nfront of the movie and he's practicing a scene from \"On the Waterfront.\" He's\n\ndoing the \"I could've been a contender\" scene. This is what you're talking\n\nabout, right?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Yes.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. And you know what? You said that Scorsese wanted to use, like,\n\nthe cold version. What I really like about that in a movie is that you could\n\ntell that, OK, LaMotta is not exactly a good performer or a good actor.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: And--nor is like...\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: You didn't like his Shakespeare?\n\nGROSS: And...\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: \"A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a...\"\n\nGROSS: And nor his empathy going to be his big thing. Like, he may have\n\nlived it, but it doesn't mean that he can act it.\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: That's right.\n\nGROSS: And I think that's such an interesting thing for a great actor to play\n\na scene, you know, playing a character who's lived it but can't act it.\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: That's right. It's a--there are so many layers of De Niro\n\ndoing Marlon Brando doing--I mean, it's just...\n\nGROSS: Exactly. Right.\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: And, of course, now that was a direct suggestion by Michael\n\nPowell, by the way. When he...\n\nGROSS: Really?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: When Marty had rediscovered Michael Powell and brought him\n\nto America, Michael thought that \"Mean Streets\" was one of the greatest movies\n\nhe'd ever seen, and he demanded of De Niro and Scorsese that they show him all\n\nthe locations where it had been made. In fact, a good deal of \"Mean Streets\"\n\nwas shot in LA. But the scenes in the cemetery outside the church, for\n\nexample, and obviously the festival scenes, the San Gennaro Festival, those\n\nwere shot in New York. And he demanded to be shown where they--those\n\nlocations were.\n\nSo De Niro and Scorsese were driving him around downtown, and they stopped off\n\nat the gym where De Niro was training. De Niro could have fought as a\n\nmiddleweight. I mean, he trained for two years to be a boxer. He was\n\nunbelievable.\n\nAnd so Scorsese and De Niro were looking at the latest videotapes of some\n\nchoreography that Marty was working out about the fights, and Michael Powell\n\nwas standing there watching with them. And he said, `You know, there's\n\nsomething wrong about the red gloves.' And Marty said, `My God, you're right.\n\nThe movie should be in black and white.' And it was that wonderful moment when\n\none director kicks off an idea in another director's head. He didn't say,\n\n`The movie should be black and white.' He said, `There's something wrong with\n\nthe red gloves,' and that just clicked with Marty. And he remembered that\n\nhe'd always seen all the fight films his father took him to, or on television,\n\nthey were always in black and white. And so if--something just coalesced in\n\nhis mind.\n\nAnd then at the end of the film--Michael had read the script, and he said,\n\n`Why are you doing Shakespeare again at the end? You should do something\n\nAmerican. You should do something that comes from your own experience.' And\n\nso they decided to do the \"On the Waterfront\" scenes. They were going to do\n\nShakespeare.\n\nGROSS: Wow. That's so great.\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Here's the scene from \"Raging Bull\" that we were just talking about.\n\nJake LaMotta, played by Robert De Niro, is in his dressing room rehearsing in\n\nfront of a mirror before going on stage.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Raging Bull\")\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Some people aren't that lucky, like the one\n\nthat Marlon Brando played in \"On the Waterfront,\" an up-and-comer who's now a\n\ndown-and-outer. Do you remember that scene in the back of the car with his\n\nbrother Charlie, a small-time racket guy? And it went something like this.\n\nIt wasn't him, Charlie. It was you. You remember that night at the garden?\n\nYou came down to my dressing and you said, `Kid, this ain't your night; we're\n\ngoing for the price on Wilson'? Remember that? `This ain't your night'? My\n\nnight. I could have taken Wilson apart that night. So what happens? He gets\n\na title shot outdoors in a ballpark, and what do I get? A one-way ticket to\n\nPalookaville. I was never no good after that night, Charlie. It was like a\n\npeak you reach, and then it's downhill. It was you, Charlie. You was my\n\nbrother. You should have looked out for me a little bit. You should've\n\nlooked out for me just a little bit. You should've taken care of me just a\n\nlittle bit instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money. You\n\ndon't understand. I could've had class. I could've been a contender. I\n\ncould've been somebody instead of a bum, which is what I am. Let's face it,\n\nit was you, Charlie. It was you, Charlie.\n\nMr. MARTIN SCORSESE: (As Barbizon) How you doing, Jake?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Everything all right?\n\nMr. SCORSESE: (As Barbizon) Yeah.\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Ready?\n\nMr. SCORSESE: (As Barbizon) Give me about five minutes.\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) OK.\n\nMr. SCORSESE: (As Barbizon) You need anything?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) Nah.\n\nMr. SCORSESE: (As Barbizon) You sure?\n\nMr. DE NIRO: (As Jake LaMotta) I'm sure.\n\nGROSS: A scene from \"Raging Bull.\" By the way, the guy who comes into the\n\ndressing room at the end of that scene is played by Martin Scorsese.\n\nWe'll talk more with Academy Award-winning film editor Thelma Schoonmaker\n\nafter a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Thelma Schoonmaker. She's edited each of Martin\n\nScorsese's movies, from \"Raging Bull\" on, and has won Oscars for \"Raging Bull\"\n\nand \"The Aviator.\"\n\nWhen you started working with Scorsese, are there certain touchstone films for\n\nhim that he wanted you to watch, films that kind of represented the delirium\n\nthat a film is capable of achieving or whatever?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Oh, yes. And, fortunately, I'm able sometimes to screen\n\nwith him when he and his wife and friends are looking at films he loves\n\ndearly. For example, \"8 1/2\" is one of the benchmark films for him; \"The Red\n\nShoes\" is another. Recently he showed \"Ashes and Diamonds,\" the great film by\n\nAndrzej Wajda, Polish filmmaker, to DiCaprio as just sort of reference for the\n\nrole DiCaprio is playing in our new movie called \"The Departed.\"\n\nSo this--these screenings with Marty are--they're almost religious events\n\nbecause we're all--a small group of people are in a room sharing this\n\nmagnificent film and then spending an hour afterwards talking about it and\n\nreveling in it. And it's a really precious experience.\n\nFor example, when we were cutting \"Raging Bull,\" Scorsese was educating me\n\nabout the films of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, because he had just\n\ndiscovered Michael Powell living in complete oblivion, and brought him to the\n\nTelluride Film Festival. He had entered \"Peeping Tom\" into the New York Film\n\nFestival, and it had been a big hit there. And he had paid some money towards\n\nthe rerelease of \"Peeping Tom\" in America, so he--there was also a\n\nretrospective at the Museum of Modern Art, and he suggested that I go see\n\ncertain films there.\n\nAnd one night when I came to work--because we used to work late at night in\n\nthose days on \"Raging Bull\"; we now work during the day--he said to me, `I\n\nhave just seen another great Powell-Pressburger film, and I want you to go\n\ninto the living room instead of working right now and watch this on video.'\n\nUnfortunately, I had to watch it on video the first time. And that was \"I\n\nKnow Where I'm Going!\"\n\nAnd so that's very typical of the way Marty is with his friends. He's often\n\neducating people. You'll notice that his video archivist is suddenly churning\n\nout copies of Powell and Pressburger when an actor is cast in one our films,\n\nand they're given the Powell-Pressburger education.\n\nGROSS: This year marks the centennial of the birth of your late husband, the\n\nBritish film director Michael Powell. And some of his films include \"The Red\n\nShoes,\" \"Black Narcissus,\" \"I Know Where I'm Going,\" \"The Life and Death of\n\nColonel Blimp,\" \"A Canterbury Tale,\" \"Peeping Tom.\" There was a tribute to him\n\nat the Cannes Film Festival this year. And you've been screening some of his\n\nmovies in other cities.\n\nDid you meet Michael Powell through Scorsese? Scorsese was a huge Michael\n\nPowell fan. Michael Powell was--became a big fan of Scorsese's movies. Is\n\nthat how you met him?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Yes. Marty not only gave me the best job in the world but\n\nthe best husband as well, so I've had all the luck anyone can ever want in\n\ntheir life.\n\nWhen Marty was educating me about the films of Michael Powell and Emeric\n\nPressburger, he--Michael Powell was at Dartmouth College. He had been brought\n\nthere by David Thompson to be an artist in residence. And he would call the\n\nediting room, particularly since he knew we worked late at night. If he was\n\nlonely at 10:00 or something at night, he would call Marty, and often I spoke\n\nto him then. And at one point Marty said, `Well, he's coming to dinner. You\n\nshould meet him.' And I fell in love with him immediately, even though there\n\nwas 30 years' difference in our age.\n\nHe was the most amazing man I have ever met in my life. His love of life was\n\nstamped all over his face. He was so unusual in the way he dressed and the\n\nway he spoke. He didn't speak much, but when he spoke, it was quite\n\nremarkable what he said. And I--he came back into the editing room because we\n\nwere editing in a spare bedroom that Marty had at that point. \"Raging Bull\"\n\nwas being edited in a spare bedroom, and I had racks in the bathtub in the\n\nadjoining bathroom. And, of course, Michael thought that was hilarious. He'd\n\nnever seen anything so insane in his life, and he loved it.\n\nSo he would come back and talk with me a little bit, and then we would talk\n\nmore on the phone. And when we were nominated for \"Raging Bull,\" went out to\n\nLA for the Oscars, I went to see him at Zoetrope Studios, the\n\nill-fated--unfortunately--experiment Francis Coppola was trying independent\n\nfilmmaking in Hollywood, and Michael was there as an artist in residence. And\n\nwe started having lunch and then dinner, and then things developed. And then\n\nwe had to tell Marty.\n\nGROSS: What was Scorsese's reaction?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Well, he was shocked and--but then he said, `That's\n\nwonderful.' And he loved having Michael around. So for the rest of the time,\n\nthe 10 precious years I had with Michael, he was with us and advising and\n\nreacting to the films, which meant so much to Marty and me. For example, he\n\ngave us the ending for \"After Hours.\" Many people had--we didn't really have\n\nan ending. At the end of \"After Hours,\" Griffin Dunne is encased in a plaster\n\nof Paris sculpture, and he's stolen by Cheech and Chong and thrown into a van,\n\nand they drive off towards Harlem. And we thought that was a fine ending, but\n\neverybody else complained. So some people said, `Well, he should go off in a\n\nballoon, and he should do this, and he should do that.' And Michael Powell\n\nsaid, `Oh, no, no, no. He has to go back to hell, he has to go back to the\n\noffice, which he hates so much.' So that's what Marty then shot.\n\nHe also was very instrumental in getting \"GoodFellas\" made, by the way.\n\nScorsese was having a lot of trouble because the studio was concerned about\n\nthe drugs, which was the major theme of the movie, and they wanted to know if\n\nit could be removed. And Scorsese said, `No, I can't remove it. That's the\n\nwhole point of the movie.' And so I told Michael about this, and he was very\n\nconcerned always about Scorsese's artistic integrity and his artistic freedom,\n\nhaving had his own career savaged by the failure of \"Peeping Tom\" with the\n\ncritics. He was very, very anxious that Marty be allowed to do what he\n\nwanted.\n\nSo he said to me, `Read me the script.' And I did because his--he had macular\n\ndegeneration, and he couldn't--he could see, but he couldn't read very well.\n\nAnd I read the script to him, and he said, `Get Marty on the phone.' And he\n\nsaid, `Marty, this is the best script I've read in 20 years. You have to make\n\nthis movie.' So Marty went back in one more time, and he got it made. And,\n\nunfortunately, Michael never saw it because he fell ill then and--which is too\n\nbad, because he really had a great deal to do with it getting made.\n\nGROSS: Thelma Schoonmaker, has being a woman in the movie world ever had an\n\nimpact one way or another? Because when you started, I mean, you started\n\nediting movies--what, in the early '70s or late '60s. And so, you know, there\n\nweren't as many women either editing or directing or producing as there are\n\ntoday. So did that make it any more difficult for you to get started?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: I was fortunate that I fell into a group of\n\nfilmmakers--Scorsese, of course, being the most important one--at New York\n\nUniversity who were very accepting of my role in the films we were making. I\n\nwas very lucky, I think. It was a quite unique situation.\n\nAnd it just so happened that I think certain feminine characteristics of\n\npatience and discipline and organization were needed at that point,\n\nparticularly in the editing field, which is why I eventually fell into\n\nediting. In the early days when we were making, for example, Marty's movie\n\n\"Who's That Knocking,\" we all were doing everything. We drove the cars with\n\nthe cameraman on the hood. We pushed the wheelchairs. We ran sound. We--I\n\neven learned how to tie into power sources in basements, and the people who\n\ntaught me said, `Always bend your knees 'cause if you get a jolt, you'll fall\n\ndown and it'll break the contact.'\n\nWe got the food. We did everything. We didn't shoot, and we didn't direct.\n\nMichael Wadleigh was the cameraman, and Scorsese was very much the director.\n\nBut it was just a wonderful collaborative time, and I wish filmmaking were\n\nmore like that these days, big feature filmmaking.\n\nBut--so I--the editing fell to me, I think, mainly because the men were always\n\nbreaking the film and losing things, and things were completely disorganized.\n\nSo that's why it began to be my job. But then my collaboration with Scorsese\n\ndeveloped, and that--so it worked out so well that I was lucky to get the\n\nbreak to work on all these magnificent films.\n\nThere are many, many women film editors today, of course, and there were women\n\neditors way back in the early days. Cecil B. DeMille's editor was a woman,\n\nfor example. But I just never felt particularly slotted into a category that\n\nway. I just thought of us all as filmmakers, I guess.\n\nGROSS: So, now, you didn't grow up in the United States. Where did you grow\n\nup?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: I grew up on the island of Aruba before it was a big\n\ntourist spot. My father worked for the Standard Oil Company in the personnel\n\ndepartment, and he and my mother met--both Americans, both living in\n\nParis--they met there and married, and my brother was born there. And then we\n\nwere moved to Algeria just when World War II broke out, and I was born in\n\nAlgeria but evacuated from there immediately when the North African invasion\n\ntook place.\n\nSo we landed on the island of Aruba, where there was an oil refinery. And I\n\ngrew up there in a blissful childhood of coming home from school, throwing off\n\nmy shoes, and running down to the beach every day--very blissful for us as\n\nchildren but not for the parents because it was a company town. So it was a\n\nlittle--it was a part of the island that was owned or rented by the Standard\n\nOil Company, so it was a little hard for them. But it was wonderful.\n\nAnd I grew up in a very cosmopolitan atmosphere. There were people from every\n\nnationality working in that refinery: Danes, Australians, Dutch, French,\n\nEnglish. And so I grew up as a European, really. And when I came to America\n\nwhen I was 15, it was quite a shock. I felt like I was on Mars. I didn't\n\nknow anything about rock 'n' roll or football, and I sort of just spent the\n\nlast two years of high school pretty privately.\n\nAnd when I went to Cornell University, then I met a whole bunch of New York\n\nCity girls, and I was fine 'cause they did the same things I did. But it was\n\nquite a shock coming back to the States.\n\nGROSS: What were your formative film experiences? Did you get to see movies\n\nin Aruba? Were there a lot of movies you realized you'd missed out on when\n\nyou moved to the States?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Certain films did come there. Interestingly enough, I saw\n\n\"The Red Shoes\" there and was deeply affected by it long before I ever knew\n\nanything about Michael Powell. I remember seeing--I was probably about 12,\n\nand it was quite, quite an experience. And then, later, when I came to the\n\nStates, I saw another Powell-Pressburger film called \"The Life and Death of\n\nColonel Blimp\" on a wonderful show called \"Million Dollar Movie.\"\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Which Scorsese was watching at the same time, where they\n\nshowed the same movie seven times a week. And so Scorsese would study the\n\nsame movie over and over again, until his mother would scream, `Turn that\n\nthing off! I can't'--and I saw \"Life and Death of Colonel Blimp\" there and\n\nwas terribly moved by it. I remember weeping afterwards.\n\nAnd I wasn't allowed to watch television in the afternoon, which was when the\n\nshow was on. And my mother, when she would come home from work, would always\n\nput her hand on top of the TV set to see if it had been on. And--but I\n\nremember being deeply influenced by that film. But I didn't intend to become\n\na filmmaker. I had no idea I was going to become a filmmaker.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Academy Award-winning film editor Thelma Schoonmaker.\n\nWe'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Announcements)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Thelma Schoonmaker. She's edited each of Martin\n\nScorsese's movies from \"Raging Bull\" on, with the exception of his documentary\n\nabout Dylan. How did you start making movies?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: I was--because of my European sort of background, I thought\n\nI would become a diplomat. I loved being abroad. And so I studied Russian\n\nlanguage and political science at Cornell University and then took all the\n\nForeign Service exams and passed them all and got to what they call the stress\n\ntest, where they try and unsettle you as if you're at a cocktail reception in\n\nSouth Africa and they ask you difficult questions to see how you would behave\n\nas a member of the embassy. And I gave all the wrong answers.\n\nI said I thought apartheid was horrible, and they were very upset by this.\n\nAnd they said, `You are going to be really unhappy in the Foreign Service.\n\nYou can't do that. You have to say what Washington tells you you can say,\n\nuntil such time as they're ready to make a statement like that.' They said,\n\n`Why don't you go to the USIA, the United States Information Agency? You'll\n\nbe happier there.' But I didn't want to do that, and I went back to Columbia.\n\nI didn't go to Columbia, but I took a night course at Columbia in primitive\n\nart, which is one of my interests.\n\nAnd I read in The New York Times an ad saying `Willing to train assistant film\n\neditor,' which you never see. Today you would never see an ad like that.\n\nPeople are hired by word of mouth. Editors recommend people to each other.\n\nAnd so I thought, `Hmm, I don't know what this involves, but I'll check into\n\nit.' And it was a horrible guy butchering the films of Antonioni and Truffaut\n\nand Godard for late-night television slots. He would sometimes just take a\n\nreel out of one of--\"Rocco & His Brothers,\" for example, a film by Visconti,\n\nand if it was too long to fit into the slot between 2 AM and 4 AM or whatever.\n\nAnd I would say to him, `You can't do that.' And he said, `Oh, nobody looks at\n\nthese things.' But you know who was looking at them? Marty.\n\nAnd so that was so awful. He was a big lush, also. I used to have to bring\n\nhim a quart of whiskey every day, which he drank. And--but I learned enough\n\nabout negative cutting and subtitling and a few things that I thought, `Well,\n\nmaybe I should look into this.' And I saw that NYU was doing just a six-week\n\nsummer course, and I thought, `Well, I can just barely afford that. I'll take\n\nthat.' And they split us up into little teams of 10 each filmmakers. I was\n\nworking on a horribly boring thing about harness racing, and Scorsese was on\n\nanother team, of course, doing one of his student films called \"What's A Nice\n\nGirl Like You.\"\n\nAnd it turned out that someone had cut his negative wrong. They were all\n\nstudents; they didn't know how to do it right. And I knew how to correct it\n\nbecause I had worked for this horrible man.\n\nSo the professor, Haig Manoogian, a wonderful professor, said, `Would you help\n\nout Scorsese with this film?' And I went over, and he'd been up for three days\n\nediting it. And he--I said, `I'll just run down and tell you you have to lose\n\nsix frames here and four frames there.' And we recut the film in the negative,\n\nand that was the beginning of my whole new life. If I hadn't gone that\n\nsummer, he wouldn't have been there the next summer. I'm so lucky.\n\nGROSS: Wow. You started editing in the early '60s, and editing has changed a\n\nlot since then. I imagine most of your work is digital editing, so I know,\n\ntechnically, your editing has changed. But does the digital approach to\n\nediting, has that fundamentally changed anything about how you go about\n\nshaping a film?\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Yes, it does, because I feel I can experiment wildly now\n\nwith digital editing. I can make a copy of my edit in one second by just\n\npushing a button that says `copy.' And I then slash into that edit not\n\nworrying about the sync of the dialogue or the sync of the music. I turn the\n\nscene upside down, put the beginning at the end and just try anything that\n\nkinetically seems worth trying.\n\nOn film, I wouldn't have been able to do that. I would have waited till he\n\ncame in, shown him the edit. Then he would have had to walk around for a\n\nwhile, while I re-edited, undid all the splices and tried--and made a record\n\nof how I did the original edit. And so it would have, I think, dampened my\n\nenthusiasm for wild experimentation. So that's a very good aspect of it.\n\nThere--the main thing to remember, always, is that it's just a tool; that the\n\nmain thing about editing is living with the film--hopefully being given enough\n\ntime to live with it, to figure out what it needs.\n\nIt's so important to live with a film for two or three months, and then\n\nsuddenly you begin to see something, and you realize what needs to be done to\n\nit. And digital editing is just a tool in that. The actual aesthetic,\n\nemotional and rhythmical solutions for things are the same as they were when\n\npeople were working on upright Moviolas.\n\nGROSS: Thelma Schoonmaker, thank you for your great movies, and thank you so\n\nmuch for talking with us and for explaining a little bit of how you do what\n\nyou do. We really appreciate it a lot.\n\nMs. SCHOONMAKER: Well, it's been wonderful. Thank you.\n\nGROSS: Thelma Schoonmaker edits Martin Scorsese's movies. Our interview was\n\nrecorded in 2005.\n\n(Credits)\n\nGROSS: I'm Terry Gross.
