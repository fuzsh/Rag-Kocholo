        "text": "This piece originally ran in March 2015, and has been republished to mark Thelma Schoonmaker being awarded the 2019 Bafta Fellowship\n\n\"You can sit in the master’s chair,” says Thelma Schoonmaker, ushering me towards a large upholstered seat behind her desk. The “master” is Martin Scorsese, whose editor she has been for 35 uninterrupted years, and with whom she first worked in 1967.\n\nAs she returns to her desk, I ease myself into Scorsese’s place, facing several screens and a wall full of pinned strips of paper, the numbered remnants of their work on The Wolf of Wall Street. There’s a remote control embedded in the armrest on my right, with which the director can indicate but not edit, and just beyond it a spot for the cup of tea Schoonmaker has made me. “We make a thousand decisions a day in here,” she says. “It’s a hell of a lot of work, but it’s so much fun.”\n\nOrdinarily, there would be another large screen in this room, a television Scorsese turns on within seconds of arriving each day. That has already been sent to Taiwan, where they’re about to begin work on a long-mooted adaptation of Shusaku Endo’s book Silence, but their usual habit is to leave the Turner Classic Movies channel running silently beside them, so they can occasionally interrupt their work to admire someone else’s. Schoonmaker and Scorsese are a legendary film-making team, but they are also the world’s most devoted twin cineastes.\n\nScorsese was eight years old when his parents took him to the cinema to see Moira Shearer in The Red Shoes. Schoonmaker saw it too (she was 12), and though it would be years before the two would meet, both were deeply affected by the film’s dark and operatic storytelling.\n\nLater, Scorsese gave Schoonmaker a “Powell-Pressburger education” – they watched Powell’s controversial masterpiece Peeping Tom, wartime classics such as The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, the elaborate Tales of Hoffmann. One night he interrupted the editing of Raging Bull to show her the latest Powell-Pressburger masterpiece he’d discovered.\n\nBy then, he had become obsessed with tracking down Michael Powell, whose career had ended abruptly with Peeping Tom in 1960. The hero of that film is a maker of snuff movies, who murders prostitutes and catches their dying moments on camera. With its clever reference to the voyeurism of cinema itself, its daring camerawork and its empathy with the killer, the film proved too much for its contemporaries. Although Hitchcock’s Psycho was released the same year, critics were disgusted by Peeping Tom. As a result, the distributors got frightened, the film never went on general release and Powell wasn’t allowed to make another movie.\n\nNot long afterwards, Schoonmaker met him over dinner at Scorsese’s house. “I just had never met anyone like him before in my life,” she says. “He was unique, so original, and anything he said was so interesting.” They all went to Los Angeles together, where Robert De Niro and Schoonmaker both won Oscars for Raging Bull, and, she says with an irrepressible laugh, “things developed unexpectedly – and we had to tell Marty!” Schoonmaker and Powell moved in together and four years later they were married – or, as they put it at the time, “spliced”.\n\nThelma Schoonmaker is warm and white-haired, sharp in her intellect, earnest in her delivery, the rounded timbre of her voice reminiscent of Judy Garland’s in The Wizard of Oz. “There’s nobody like him,” she says of Scorsese, and you can’t help hearing “there’s no place like home”. The energy in her conversation and the muscularity of her work – she’s lost count of the number of producers who have asked her to cut for them a scene as electric as the last 20 minutes of Goodfellas – is such that you forget the notion of age altogether. But I look hers up eventually, and find that she is 75, almost the same age Michael Powell was when they met. It’s as if she’s re-enacting the optimism and imaginative spark she describes in him.\n\nThey both liked to cook – she still tries to reproduce Powell’s elusive fish pie – and often held big dinners. “People still remember: his stewed pears, his potato soup,” she says wistfully. “One time, Napoleon, the great film by Abel Gance, was going to be shown at Radio City Music Hall, and Coppola’s father had done a live score. So Michael said, ‘Well, I’m buying tickets for everybody.’ Because it had influenced him so much. I forget what film we were working on, but I was exhausted. And he said, ‘Then we’re going to have a dinner afterwards.’ And we did. We did a ham en croute, red cabbage. Nobody ever forgets those dinners.”\n\nPowell became, in a way, the godfather of Goodfellas. Scorsese’s script had been turned down several times by the studio – they told him he had to take out the drugs, the entire driving force of the plot – and Powell asked Schoonmaker to read it to him. He was losing his eyesight by then, but he listened to it and pronounced it the best screenplay he’d come across in decades. He persuaded Scorsese to try to get it funded one last time, and that time he succeeded. But in February 1990, while Schoonmaker and Scorsese were editing the film, Powell died of cancer.\n\n“I wanted to kill myself,” she says now. “But I knew that Michael would kill me if I didn’t go back and help Marty finish that movie. So I did and it really pulled me through. It’s such an interesting circle, isn’t it? I wish he could have seen it.”\n\nNow Schoonmaker does a good deal of work on her late husband’s behalf. She has described her editing of his memoirs – there were two volumes – as one of the richest experiences of her life; now she is working on his diaries. With the help of Scorsese, who is able to raise the money, she has restored a number of his classic films, the latest of which is The Tales of Hoffmann, a high-colour rendition of Jacques Offenbach’s opera, made in 1951, with choreography by Frederick Ashton and starring Moira Shearer. As it happens, it’s one of Scorsese’s favourites; he has always admired the way the camera moves with the music, and in particular the way it’s edited. It offers, he has said, “a sense of the film as music – the composed film”.\n\nWe pause over the beauty of designer Hein Heckroth’s trompe l’oeil stage – Shearer dancing from one water lily to another, or down an uncannily painted staircase – and over the puppets that turn into real people, dancing as if they’re wind-up dolls, in an evocation of Hoffmann’s famous story The Sandman. A sword fight on a gondola causes Schoonmaker to exclaim, almost to herself, “Beautiful editing!” The whole thing is full of extravagant, joyous artifice, yet produced, as she points out, for the equivalent of “what we now spend on coffee”.\n\n“They shot it on a big, silent stage,” she explains, “because they didn’t have sound – they were singing to playback. So they felt particularly free, and their imagination just went wild. It was like they were making a silent film again.” Every time Schoonmaker watches it, she finds more details that are, she says, “so exquisite”. And she gets to know Powell himself better in the process. “The bravery of the choices,” she says. “The guts: it never tires of startling me.”\n\nThe invisibility of film editing is one reason why women tend to be good at it. “There are more women editors than people realise,” Schoonmaker says. “I think we’re more able to keep our eye on what the film needs. Between men sometimes it’s a real ego battle, and that’s very bad for the film. And there were women editors way back. In the very beginning, women were editors because they were the people in the lab rolling the film before there was editing. Then when people like D W Griffith began editing, they needed the women from the lab to come and splice the film together. Cecil B DeMille’s editor was a woman.” She smiles. “Then when it became a more lucrative job, men moved into it.”\n\nBut when she left, she avoided diplomacy and answered an ad for a job with an editor who cut European films down to standard American television run times. Painfully, she colluded in the chopping up of Truffaut’s Shoot the Pianist, one film by Fellini, two films by Visconti… “He took a whole reel out of Rocco and His Brothers, which is a masterpiece. I said, ‘You can’t do that,’ and he said, ‘Oh, nobody’s looking at these things.’ ”\n\nIt occurs to me that one person who may well have been looking is Martin Scorsese, whose addiction to movies, even as they were then shown on television, is the driving force behind their office’s extraordinary archive.\n\n“Yes, I do think he was probably watching some of the things that I butchered,” she says with a sigh.\n\nBut no matter. The experience landed her a place at NYU film school, where the future collaborators met. “And then him introducing me to Michael…” she says, trailing off. “It’s all luck,” she adds, smiling. “I’ve had it all.”"
