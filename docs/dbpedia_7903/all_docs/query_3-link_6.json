Who am I forgetting? Who's your favorite?\n\nDede Allen\n\n- Odds Against Tomorrow, The Hustler, Bonnie and Clyde, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Slap Shot, Reds, Breakfast Club, Wonder Boys\n\nPaul Hirsch\n\n- Hi Mom, Carrie, Empire Strikes Back, Blow Out, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, Source Code, MI Ghost Protocol\n\nSam O’Steen\n\n- Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf, Cool Hand Luke, The Graduate, Rosemary’s Baby, Chinatown\n\nGeorge Greenberg\n\n- French Connection, Taking of Pelham 123, Apocalypse Now, Dressed to Kill, Scarface\n\nRalph Rosenblum\n\n- The Pawnbroker, Fail-Safe, The Group, The Producers, Love and Death, Annie Hall\n\nDylan Tichenor (the youngest gun, at 50 y/o)\n\n- Boogie Nights, Unbreakable, Royal Tenenbaums, Brokeback Mountain, TWBB, ZD30, Phantom Thread\n\nThelma Schoonmaker\n\n- Raging Bull, After Hours, Goodfellas, Wolf of Wall St\n\nAnd the Coens (who are the reason I made this thread--discussed with friends how they are insanely talented as editors too and don't get enough credit there) and Walter Murch whose books on editing are must-reads.\n\nPost by stephen on\n\nLeslie Jones is also criminally underappreciated in the medium. She is probably the best at evoking that sense of \"intentional aimlessness\" -- that is to say, an almost organic, freewheeling style of storytelling, as seen in The Thin Red Line and The Master.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nNot yet mentioned is Jay Cassidy as someone doing it right now and maybe peaking - not an all timer but someone whose name should be known - who has done a lot of big movies and some that are considered narrative messes by directors who specialize in that but without his involvement wouldn't have had any arc at all. He's an industry guy who can often take opaque or odd material and give it a unique and consistent shape.\n\nMenke will always have that association with QT that makes her like Schoonmaker is a way. Schoonmaker and Murch in some aspects can be argued have flat out saved the greatest films of Scorsese and Coppola - I mean for all I know Schoonmaker (nearly 80) is doing the hardest editing job ever on The Irishman trying to make consistency and rhythm on the de-aged lead and other actors flow believably and coherently from scene to scene.\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nAnother one is William Goldenberg. Heat, The Insider, National Treasure, Argo, Zero Dark Thirty, Detroit.\n\nI saw him give a lecture once and he talked about his craft and how much the directors are involved in post-production and basically said that Kathryn Bigelow gives him full reign on her films and barely gives him notes. Worth mentioning just for his Mann films anyway, but also some majorly terrific cuts like in ZD30 from the explosion to Chastain at the computer and that blinking cursor...\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nNot yet mentioned is Jay Cassidy as someone doing it right now and maybe peaking - not an all timer but someone whose name should be known - who has done a lot of big movies and some that are considered narrative messes by directors who specialize in that but without his involvement wouldn't have had any arc at all. He's an industry guy who can often take opaque or odd material and give it a unique and consistent shape.\n\nYes-- he's worth mentioning for his flawless work on Foxcatcher alone. Surprised to see he did Fright Night Part 2 which I watched last month and if that film is anything (other than being moderately solid sequel) it's stylishly edited and put together.\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nLeslie Jones is also criminally underappreciated in the medium. She is probably the best at evoking that sense of \"intentional aimlessness\" -- that is to say, an almost organic, freewheeling style of storytelling, as seen in The Thin Red Line and The Master.\n\nShe's very talented for sure. Punch-Drunk Love couldn't be better. And with The Master-- well I find almost all of it mesmeric and that's largely due to the rhythms of its edit. Also there's 20th Century Women, beautifully edited, and she should've been nom'd damn it (that whole film was shockingly snubbed). As for Inherent Vice-- I think there's a better film in there. I mean there's stuff in the deleted scenes that I couldn't imagine leaving out....\n\nTrivia: her father edited It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, Last Detail, Shampoo, etc. And her grandfather edited some Elia Kazan films!\n\nAs for Pietro Scalia.........he peaked in the '90s. And with him there's a good example of adapting to different creative visions or sensibility: matching the loony-Leone vibe of Quick and the Dead with a fast pace and jump cuts and then something more tempered, dissolves etc, with Good Will Hunting.\n\nPost by ibbi on\n\nThe Coens really are amazing, and definitely deserve to be up there. My pick would be Thelma in spite of continuity hiccups here and there. There's so many who have done a couple of great ones, but her record going all the way back to Woodstock and certainly all the way up to Wolf of Wall Street is incredible.\n\nPost by jakob on\n\nLeslie Jones is also criminally underappreciated in the medium. She is probably the best at evoking that sense of \"intentional aimlessness\" -- that is to say, an almost organic, freewheeling style of storytelling, as seen in The Thin Red Line and The Master.\n\nAnd she was actually pretty good in Ghostbusters!\n\nPost by idioticbunny on\n\nMy go-to would probably be Thelma Schoonmaker, but only because she's the most recognizable name I can think of (outside of the Coens or Kirk Baxter/Angus Wall with their Fincher work which is some all-time great stuff, including Mindhunter). But there are a ton of names you listed that I think I love their work a lot.\n\nWill say, I'm surprised I'm the first to mention Sally Menke. Her work, though mostly limited to Tarantino, was always fantastic.\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nFour more:\n\nAlan Heim - Oscar & Emmy winner, still working at 83y/o - most significant work with Bob Fosse (Lenny, All That Jazz, Star 80). He also did Network, one of the great underrated comedies Beer from '85, and co-edited underrated thriller Copycat....\n\nwith Jim Clark who did The Innocents (all-timer editing), Marathon Man, and won an Oscar for The Killing Fields. His final work was Happy-Go-Lucky.\n\nand the next two are French fellas.... Yann Dedet (74yo). Often worked with Truffaut - Day for Night, The Story of Adele H, Small Change; and Maurice Pialat - Loulou, A Nos Amours, Under the Sun of Satan, Van Gogh. And....\n\nHervé de Luze (71) one of my very favorites ever. Worked with Claude Berri - Tchao Pantin, Uranus, all-timer Jean de Florette/Manon of the Spring; and did ten with Polanski - The Pianist, The Ghost Writer, etc - but those two are masterpieces of editing. Some other stuff, different tones - the lived-in Le Garcu, and the thrilling fast-paced Tell No One.\n\nPost by Tommen_Saperstein on\n\nChristopher Rouse deserves mention for his nail-biting work with Greengrass, and I definitely second some that have already been mentioned: Goldenberg, The Coens, Angus Wall/Kirk Baxter, Menke--all pivotal.\n\nI don't know much about Jay Cassidy's slate but his work on Foxcatcher definitely deserves a shout-out and was curiously overlooked at the time. I'm glad Mattsby and pacinoyes were paying attention at least! He had such a keen eye for jump cuts in that film. I'll always remember the agonizing tension of that first training session between Mark and Dave at the beginning of the film ending on a close-up of Mark's drool-strewn anguished face before Cassidy sharply cuts away from the scene. Those jump cuts infuse Miller's coldly observational approach with the jagged edges implicit in the psychological profile and serve as a reminder of the rage and desperation constantly bubbling beneath the surface.\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nMiroslav Hájek - an extremely talented editor and probably quite unsung as a key figure of the Czech New Wave. He did....... The Ear, The Firemen’s Ball, Marketa Lazarova, And the Fifth Horseman is Fear, Case for a Rookie Hangman, Diamonds of the Night, Black Peter, Daisies, etc - some preliminary cutting of Amadeus too. He has over 200 IMDb credits.\n\nCzech New Wave movies always fascinate me and largely I think it's bc of the editing, the style - defying traditional form, but never vainly (cough Godard), almost always to complement the artistic intention, often slyly, and as daring as the artists were against their controlling gov't. Other '60s movies using jump-cuts, hectic montage, and surreality I feel like could often be called \"playful\" but in these films they are essential, impactful, harrowing, poetic.\n\nRookie Hangman has some of the most stirringly creative and whirlwind montage sequences you could imagine; The Ear is a practically perfect example of the editing structure informing theme and narrative; Diamonds of the Night is tight as a dot with ephemeral inserts and can like the opening shot feel so enclosed and shimmering that a cut would be indiscernible; and there's the semi-vérité Milos Forman's where Hájek is shaping lighter, wry jaunts but no less keenly."
