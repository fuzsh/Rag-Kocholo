        "text": "Martin Scorsese is widely regarded as the greatest living filmmaker of modern cinema. But like a modest director, Scorsese has long credited his success to his collaborative partnership with Thelma Schoonmaker, whom he considers the greatest living film editor. For over five decades, Schoonmaker has been the mastermind behind the editing room, shaping Scorsese’s vision into cinematic masterpieces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScorsese-Schoonmaker collaboration has given birth to the most iconic films in history, including Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and more. However, despite their celebrated legacy that won Martin Scorsese and Thelma Schoonmaker several accolades, their triumphant moment at the 1981 Academy Awards was tinged with sadness.\n\nMartin Scorsese was Snubbed at the Oscars for Raging Bull\n\nAcclaimed filmmaker Martin Scorsese is often known for pushing the boundaries of filmmaking with his iconic vision and spectacular art. But a major part of his success goes to renowned film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who serves as his trusted partner, shaping the narrative and refining Scorsese’s vision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThelma Schoonmaker’s intuitive understanding of Martin Scorsese’s vision and her technical genius have resulted in some of the most memorable scenes in cinema history. From collaboratively working on Goodfellas‘ Copacabana nightclub sequence to the hauntingly beautiful finale of Raging Bull, Scorsese and Schoonmaker have together set an excellent standard in Hollywood.\n\nHowever, despite Martin Scorsese and Thelma Schoonmaker’s collaboration being celebrated as a testament to the power of creative synergy, there was a time when the filmmaker was turned down at the Oscars for his deserving credit. While Scorsese and Schoonmaker’s Raging Bull is often regarded as a masterful work of art, the 53rd Academy Awards apparently snubbed Scorsese of his win, via Slash Film.\n\nWhile sometimes the Academy Awards offer the coveted accolades of Best Director and Best Picture separately, other times, they go all-in on a single film. During the 1981 Academy Awards, it was because of the latter, that Martin Scorsese was turned down the Best Director award for Raging Bull since Robert Redford’s Ordinary People took home both, Best Picture and Best Director awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Raging Bull’s Oscar Win Thelma Schoonmaker was Heartbroken\n\nAlthough for acclaimed filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, these sorts of moments and Academy Awards results are quite common, they still sting a bit. But it was his editor Thelma Schoonmaker who was the most heartbroken to witness how Scorsese was turned down his deserving win, especially after she won the Best Film Editing Oscar.\n\nSpeaking with Total Film magazine (via Slash Film), Thelma Schoonmaker thus reflected on the sorrow she felt on the night of the 53rd Academy Awards. As she took home the Best Film Editing Oscar for her legendary work on Raging Bull, and Scorsese was snubbed for Best Director, Schoonmaker mentioned feeling shattered by the exclusion of the director from the Oscar category.\n\nI wanted to give him my Oscar. I learned so much on ‘Raging Bull.’ Marty was teaching me constantly. And the brilliant camerawork, the changing of speeds, the cutting… it’s just phenomenal.\n\nSpeaking publicly about the disappointment she felt that night, calling it “one of the saddest nights of my life” Thelma Schoonmaker mentioned that despite her own achievement, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of loss for her colleague and friend. Addressing how Martin Scorsese had poured his heart and soul into the film, Schoonmaker even admitted feeling the overwhelming desire to give him her Oscar.\n\nAdvertisement"
