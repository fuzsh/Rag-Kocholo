        "text": "\"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is nominated for 10 Oscars this year, including best picture, best director for Martin Scorsese and best actress for Lily Gladstone.\n\nThe film is is Scorsese's sorrowful epic about the long history of U.S. mistreatment of Native Americans with powerful acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Oscar favorite Gladstone.\n\nBased on David Grann's nonfiction bestseller, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is set in the 1920s when oil is discovered on Oklahoma land where the feds had exiled the Osage Nation. Suddenly, they are beyond rich, riding in chauffeured cars and easy targets for white interlopers who marry Osage women, rob them blind and kill them and their families at any hint of resistance.\n\nIt's a dark chapter of American history that Scorsese, in a directorial high-wire act on par with \"Gangs of New York,\" \"Goodfellas\" and \"The Departed,\" uses to explode the myth of western heroism.\n\nIn the keenly observant script he wrote with Eric Roth, Scorsese trades in urban mean streets for the landscapes of the rural west. But you'll recognize the same tribal warfare.\n\nHere are the categories that \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is nominated for:\n\nBest picture\n\nBest director: Martin Scorsese\n\nBest actress in a leading role: Lily Gladstone\n\nBest actor in a supporting role: Robert De Niro\n\nBest cinematography: Rodrigo Prieto\n\nBest costume design: Jacqueline West\n\nBest film editing: Thelma Schoonmaker\n\nBest original score: Robbie Robertson\n\nBest original song: \"Wahzhazhe (A Song For My People)\" - Music and Lyric by Scott George\n\nBest production design: Production Design: Jack Fisk; Set Decoration: Adam Willis"
