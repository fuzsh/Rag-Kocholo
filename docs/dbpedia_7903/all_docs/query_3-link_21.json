        "text": "Behind the violent, emotional, and unpredictable men who have populated most of Martin Scorsese's films, there has always been one cheerful, whip-smart woman. Thelma Schoonmaker began working with Scorsese on his first feature, 1967's Who's That Knocking at My Door, and since Raging Bull has edited every one of his films, winning three Academy Awards along the way. For The Wolf of Wall Street, the hotly debated film released on Christmas, Schoonmaker was helping Scorsese trim the original four-hour cut of the film, along with navigating tricky waters of depicting the terrible behavior of stock trader Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) without celebrating it.\n\nSchoonmaker says she always knew they were going to have to delay the film from its original November release date—it was just a matter of getting the studio to listen and give her and her collaborator the time to do their work. In our conversation, Schoonmaker discussed what it's been like to watch DiCaprio grow as an actor since he first worked with Scorsese on Gangs of New York (\"It's wild, what he's doing\"), why she loves editing scenes with improv, and how the cuts they made to Wolf of Wall Street are nothing compared to the pain of cutting her favorite scene from 1985's After Hours.\n\nDid this movie feel like it was going to be so big and so funny when you started?\n\nNo, I don't think any of us except the writer and Marty and our casting director realized it was going to be so funny. That was a bit of a shock, a delightful shock. Everybody thought oh, this is going to be about Wall Street, it's going to be serious. But what happened instead is there's this wonderful humor that comes out of the callous behavior of these guys. I was sitting here just roaring with laughter as I watched the dailies, and that's unusual for me.\n\nHow many days of dailies did it take before you realized you could laugh at all this?\n\nOh, I realized right away, because one of the first things I saw was that incredible thing of Matthew McConaughey at lunch, training Leonardo DiCaprio to be a broker in the worst possible way. I could not believe the funniness of how it was written and then the beautiful way it was acted. And Leo's reactions were so fantastic. It was just a delightful thing to fall into my hands!\n\nThat scene at lunch goes on for a really long time, and it's really different from the quick rhythm of the earlier scenes. How did you settle on that rhythm? The movie kind of pauses to have Matthew McConaughey give that speech.\n\nMarty wanted the film to have sort of a ferocious quality to it. He planned all these beautiful sequences, for example, from the very opening of them throwing the dwarves and then him riding in his Ferrari and the way he introduces the mansion and his wife and the yacht, and everything. It's all very fast. Then when we found out that these actors were going to be so incredible in these scenes, then the film comes to a screeching halt for a moment to savor that beautiful scene and then picks up again, then slow down again for another scenes. So it was kind of an unconventional structure. But it's something new, and that was fun to discover.\n\nDoes that ever make you nervous, to embrace an unconventional structure? Do you ever worry about losing the audience?\n\nI think that's certainly always a concern, but i must say these scenes play like crazy! Whenever I see them with an audience they're laughing right through it and they want more.\n\nIs there more improv in this than anything else you guys have made?\n\nYeah, more of the scenes had improv in them, but the basic script was beautifully written by Terry Winter. They humor is not just improv. What would happen is they would embellish and embroider the wonderful scene that Terry had written. But our early films—Raging Bull, King of Comedy, After House, Casino, Goodfellas—were heavily improvised. It was so much fun to get back to that again. I love it, because it's like a puzzle you're given and you sort of have to fit it together to make it a full scene.\n\nHaving gone through 20 years since the last improv-heavy film, are you smarter about doing it now?\n\nOnce you learn how to do that, I don't think you ever lose it. It very quickly came back to me, believe me. The problem is then that you have this rich material and you have to shorten it. It was hard sometimes to take out some of this wonderful stuff, but we had to to get the film to flow right. That's part of my job. But it was hard.\n\nI'm curious about the conversation between you and Scorsese when you realized the release date had to be pushed.I mean, it just became clear that the way it had ballooned up in the film—it had gotten much bigger than was intended because of the improvisation. That we were going to need more time. I knew that very early on. It just took a long time to convince people!\n\nWas there any particular character or thread that especially ballooned?\n\nThe whole thing of Jordan teaching his brokers how to sell to rich people was actually a much, much longer scene. We just found that people wanted it to be shorter. That was very clear from our early screenings. We just kept cutting it down and cutting it down until we got to where we are now. That took a long time.\n\nPeople actually enjoyed the four-hour version. It was clear that it would be better for the whole film to cut it down, so that the film has a flow instead of stopping and starting. It's part of your job always as an editor, you always have to drop stuff. At least I didn't have to drop my favorite scene and Marty's favorite scene, like we had to do on After Hours. It was literally my favorite scene and Marty's favorite scene It was like cutting off a leg, as an editor.\n\nThere are scenes where you guys lingering on the suffering and destruction in all this—like the woman having her head shaved—but not a lot of them.\n\nThe writer, Marty and Leo wanted to immerse you in the craziness of this world and make you understands why these people were attracted to it and made these terrible decisions to be part of it. And just like Marty did in Goodfellas, where he sort of immerses you in the world of the Mafia, and you see why people think it's a great idea to join it, and then you see the end of result of it and it's terrible, they don't take care of their women, then they go to jail. And all the terrible things have happened. I think he wanted to do that. It was better to get people to feel what these guys were doing, and that's why they committed themselves to that.\n\nThe scene you've probably gotten asked the most about is the Lemmons scene, the wild drug trip. There's so much interesting stuff going on with the camera, it stays still and them moves within the perspective. How did you not only assemble the scene but maintain the tone so that it stays funny?\n\nWell, it's interesting. I didn't expcet it to be as funny as it is. But Marty knew, right from the beginning, it was going to be funny, and that it could sustain. When he starts to crawl toward the car, I said to Marty, \"Didn't you do any coverage, to cut away to a close-up here or an insert of his hands or anything?\" and he said, \"Oh no no, the humor is in his body language as he drags himself in a wide shot toward that car.\" And Marty knew it was going to work. And I was a little nervous about it. The first time we screened it people were just roaring. He really knows, and he's very daring. He was just killing himself, Leo. That's very painful what he was doing. He never gives up. He will do anything for Marty. He will just keep going until he drops. He hurt his neck and all kinds of things, but he just kept going. But Marty knew the humor of the body language in that wide shot was the thing.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio has given a lot of great performances, but this feels like a new level he couldn't have done without working for you guys so many times. Do you feel like you've watched him grow?\n\nYeah, I think of course he just completely trusts Marty. A lot of the actors have been saying on these panels that they feel safe in Marty's hands, because he understands that things can be humiliating. He's acted himself, and he's been very nervous when he's done it. So he knows that actors need to have the feeling of security. Once they get that feeling, then they're willing to just blossom and do anything. Leo has been incredibly good about just trusting Marty. He's so brave in this movie, isn't he? It's wild, what he's doing. I think that he understands that Marty will do right by him, once we get into the editing room. That trust is built over the years more and more and more. I love that he can really make fun of himself. And there's nothing like a handsome actor doing that."
