        "text": "The Academy Awards of 2011 had an excellent assortment of Best Picture Nominees. There were some “traditional” films, such as The King’s Speech (which was the winner). There were fresh, innovative stories told in non-traditional ways, such as Inception and Black Swan. The lineup of directors was also impressive: Aronofsky, Fincher, the Coen Brothers, and Nolan are all master filmmakers. However, there is one master director who had a film that was completely overlooked. That director is the very great Martin Scorsese. I had heard a great deal about the film Shutter Island, yet had never watched it before. Having seen it, I don’t know why it got totally overlooked at the Oscars.\n\nBeing a gigantic fan of Mr. Scorsese, I have often noticed that many of his films get overlooked at the Oscars. I believe I know the reason for this. The man has made some of the greatest films of all time. Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas are all perfect films which appear on many “Best Of” lists. When a filmmaker creates films on that level, anything that doesn’t reach “masterpiece” status gets overlooked. Two of his most recent films The Wolf of Wall Street (my favorite film of 2013), and The Irishman got shut out at the Academy Awards. Shutter Island didn’t receive a single nomination. Is it as masterful as Goodfellas? No. However, that in no way makes it a weak film, undeserving of attention.\n\nShutter Island, (based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane) is a mysterious film about a US Marshall, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who goes to Shutter Island, a hospital for the criminally insane, to investigate the disappearance of a patient. While he and his partner, played by Mark Ruffalo try to find the missing person, DiCaprio experiences a series of flashbacks about his experience in World War II, and his family. I won’t go into more detail because I don’t want to spoil the film. I went into this film without knowing the entire plot. I’m lucky because the entire film unwraps like a present, leading to a conclusion I truly did not see coming. The script was tight, with twists and turns throughout the film. The editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, was, as always, perfect. Schoonmaker wove the present together with DiCaprio’s memories seamlessly. Not only was I surprised by the film not receiving a Best Picture nomination, but I also don’t know how DiCaprio starred in this film and Inception and failed to receive a nomination for either film. Shutter Island is a satisfying mystery, which leads to a conclusion that I’m sure most people didn’t see coming. It absolutely deserved a Best Picture nomination."
