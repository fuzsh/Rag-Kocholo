        "text": "Best Film Editing and Best Picture have had an important relationship throughout Oscars history. While the two awards don’t always necessarily go to the same film, it is rare that a Best Picture winner isn’t at least nominated for Best Film Editing. Only two out of the last 20 Best Picture champs were snubbed by the editors’ branch: “Birdman” in 2015 and “CODA” in 2022.\n\nOne of the best cutters in the business is Thelma Schoonmaker. This longtime collaborator of Martin Scorsese reunites with him for this year’s red-hot Oscar contender, “Killers of the Flower Moon.” This story tells the true tale of the murder of several Osage tribe members in the USA in the 1920s, which led to an FBI investigation involving J. Edgar Hoover. Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone star.\n\nSchoonmaker reaped her record ninth nomination for her work on this epic. Her other bids were as follows: 1971 for “Woodstock,” 1981 for “Raging Bull,” 1991 for “Goodfellas,” 2003 for “Gangs of New York,” 2005 for “The Aviator,” 2007 for “The Departed,” 2012 for “Hugo,” and 2020 for “The Irishman.” She won for “Raging Bull,” “The Aviator,” and “The Departed.” You’ll notice that seven out of those eight bids came for Scorsese-directed movies. The only exception was her first nomination — “Woodstock,” which was directed by Michael Wadleigh (although, coincidentally, Scorsese did also work on “Woodstock”). All three wins came for Scorsese films.\n\nThose three wins are a record. Well, a joint record.\n\nMichael Kahn has reaped eight bids to date: 1978 for “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” 1982 for “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark,” 1988 for “Fatal Attraction” alongside Peter E. Berger, 1988 again for “Empire of the Sun,” 1994 for “Schindler’s List,” 1999 for “Saving Private Ryan,” 2006 for “Munich,” and 2013 for “Lincoln.” He’s won for “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark,” “Schindler’s List,” and “Savings Private Ryan.”\n\nThere’s a curious parallel here. While Schoonmaker is known for her collaboration with Scorsese, Kahn has the same relationship with Steven Spielberg. Seven out of those eight bids came for Spielberg movies, with the exception being “Fatal Attraction,” a film helmed by Adrian Lyne. And all three wins came for Spielberg flicks.\n\nDaniel Mandell and Ralph Dawson have also won three Best Film Editing awards each. Mandell won for “The Pride of the Yankees” in 1943, “The Best Years of Our Lives” in 1947, and “The Apartment” in 1961. Meanwhile, Dawson won for “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” in 1936, “Anthony Adverse” in 1937, and “The Adventures of Robin Hood” in 1939.\n\nPS: That wouldn’t be the only record Schoonmaker would break. If she were to win, she’d become the oldest winner in this category at 84 years old come the time of the Academy Awards next year (her birthday is in January). The current record is held by Mandell, who was 65 years old when he won for “The Apartment.”\n\nMake your predictions at Gold Derby now.
