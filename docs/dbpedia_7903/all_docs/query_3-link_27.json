        "text": "She talked about how Scorsese helped to boost the reputations of Powell and Pressburger, how Powell was the great love of her life, and how the Film Foundation restored in 4K the duo’s hallucinogenic three-strip Technicolor 1951 operatic masterpiece “The Tales of Hoffmann,” which debuted at the London Film Festival last fall and played the Cameraimage and Lumiere festivals in Europe, and hits Film Forum in New York and Cinefamily in LA on March 13.\n\nIt was a big huge lavish opening in New York at the Metropolitan Opera, it did well in certain parts of Europe and England, but it was not a huge raging success. That’s one reason the negative was undamaged: it was not used very much. It didn’t do great."
