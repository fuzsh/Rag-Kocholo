        "text": "The relationship between a director and an editor is a special one. After the madness of the production is done, directors are stuck in a room for endless hours with editors, so it might help maintain everyone’s sanity if they’re frequently on the same page. That’s why a lot of established directors work with the same editors throughout their careers. For example, Steven Spielberg has Michael Kahn, Clint Eastwood has Joel Cox, and The Coen Brothers have the ever-reclusive Roderick Jaynes (they’ve been working together for over twenty years, how come there still isn’t a picture of this guy anywhere?).\n\nPerhaps the most famous of these duos is Martin Scorsese and his superstar editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who’ve been consistently working together since Scorsese’s first feature “Who’s That Knocking At My Door” in 1967. In fact, the two have been so closely connected for the past 40-plus years that it’s hard to find a single non-Scorsese film in Schoonmaker’s resume."
