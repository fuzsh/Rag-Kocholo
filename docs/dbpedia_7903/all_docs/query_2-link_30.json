        "text": "Ever since her Oscar-worthy cutting on \"Raging Bull\" (1980) - arguably one of the greatest films ever made - editor Thelma Schoonmaker enjoyed an exclusive working relationship - as well as a close friendship - with director Martin Scorsese. Not since the partnership between director Billy Wilder and writer I.A.L. Diamond has there been collaboration as creatively fruitful and personally fulfilling. Soft-spoken and decidedly low-key, Schoonmaker has been the polar opposite of her excitable and demonstrative counterpart, allowing for a symbiosis of equal footing in the editing room; two sides of the same coin that together produced some of the most iconic films in recent memory."
