        "text": "Film editor and longtime Martin Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker, 83, could break a few Oscar records with “Killers of the Flower Moon.”\n\n9\n\nAn Academy Award nomination for “Flower Moon” would give Schoonmaker the most film-editing nominations ever.\n\n2\n\nSchoonmaker and Steven Spielberg’s go-to editor, Michael Kahn, who turns 93 on Dec. 8, are tied atop the all-time nominations list at eight apiece.\n\n3\n\nSchoonmaker won Oscars for “Raging Bull,” “The Aviator” and “The Departed.”\n\n4\n\nA 2024 Oscar for Schoonmaker would break a four-way tie among her, Kahn, the late Ralph Dawson and Daniel Mandell for most film-editing Oscar wins.\n\n1\n\nSchoonmaker Oscar nomination came for a film not directed by Scorsese: the 1970 documentary “Woodstock,” directed by Michael Wadleigh.\n\n10\n\nBeloved by BAFTA, Schoonmaker has received 10 editing nominations, two wins (for “Raging Bull” and “Goodfellas”) and in …\n\n2019\n\n... a BAFTA Fellowship lifetime achievement award. Although the UK awards body treats Schoonmaker like part of the crown, she was born in Algiers to American parents. But Michael Powell, Schoonmaker’s renowned late filmmaker husband, was English.\n\nGet the Envelope newsletter, sent three times a week during awards season, for exclusive reporting, insights and commentary."
