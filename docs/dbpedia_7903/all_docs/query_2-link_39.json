        "text": "Martin Scorsese‘s longtime collaborator, Oscar-winning editor Thelma Schoonmaker, was devastated when the Academy didn’t recognize his work on “Raging Bull.”\n\nThe boxing biopic starring Robert De Niro lost Best Picture and Best Director to Robert Redford’s “Ordinary People.” And while Schoonmaker won Best Editing, she still calls the 1981 Oscars ceremony the “worst night” of her life.\n\n“When we were standing there, those of us who did win, I was waiting for Marty to come with his Oscar. And he didn’t,” Schoonmaker told Esquire UK. “It was the worst night of my life. It was devastating that he didn’t win.”\n\nShe added, “I think he would have liked to win for ‘Raging Bull.’ A movie like that, that is so brilliantly directed. But it was a tough movie. And ‘Ordinary People,’ I understand it’s a very good movie, I’ve never seen it,” Schoonmaker said. “But people were maybe a bit put off by the toughness of ‘Raging Bull.’ But look how it’s lasted. It’s a benchmark movie.”\n\nThroughout her decades-long collaboration with Scorsese, the duo have only shared Oscar wins for “The Departed” in the Best Editing and Best Director categories. “The Departed” marks Scorsese’s sole Academy Award; Schoonmaker has three total for “Raging Bull,” “The Aviator,” and “The Departed.”\n\n“Yeah, we’re not very lucky with the Oscars. I mean, Marty has deserved many,” Schoonmaker said. “I know, and that’s not fair. Because they’re really his as well as mine.”\n\nShe continued, “But Marty should have won at least seven, as far as I’m concerned. But we’re very unlucky at the Oscars, because the films are sometimes very unusual. And people are sometimes not used to it, or they resist it, or [resist] voting for it.”\n\nScorsese recently told The New Yorker that his “The Departed” win was a total surprise in 2006."
