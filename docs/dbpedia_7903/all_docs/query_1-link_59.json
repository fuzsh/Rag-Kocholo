        "text": "Martin Scorsese's Oklahoma-made cinematic epic \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" has emerged as a strong contender in the cinematic awards season.\n\nSince garnering widespread critical acclaim with its autumn theatrical debut, \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" which is now streaming on Apple TV+, has been named the best film of 2023 by the New York Film Critics Circle, Oklahoma Film Critics Circle and National Board of Review; received a tribute at NYC's Gotham Awards; made the American Film Institute's list of top 10 movies of the year; and scored an historic Golden Globe victory for star Lily Gladstone.\n\nHere's a look at what the film's Academy Awards prospects are and what \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" has won so far:\n\n'Killers of the Flower Moon' is nominated for 10 Oscars\n\nNow available to rent or buy digitally, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" has brought to light a dark and often-overlooked chapter of Oklahoma history: The 1920s \"Reign of Terror,\" a series of brutal murders of oil-rich Osage Nation citizens.\n\nFilmed in and around Osage County in 2021, Scorsese's 3 1/2-hour fact-based drama is adapted from “Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.\"\n\nScorsese's made-in-Oklahoma epic is nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture.\n\nLily Gladstone, the fact-based drama's Native American star, earned an Oscar nomination for best actress as she continues to make cinematic history this awards season: Gladstone, who is NiMíiPuu, or Nez Perce, and Siksikaitsitapi, or Blackfeet, is the first Native American to be nominated for best actress in the nearly 100-year history of the Academy Awards.\n\nShe has proven the film's awards favorite for her powerful lead turn as Mollie Kyle Burkhart, a real-life Osage woman who was marked for death in the Reign of Terror.\n\nHer co-star Robert De Niro, already a two-time Oscar winner (\"Raging Bull,\" \"The Godfather: Part II\") was nominated for best supporting actor, while Scorsese received a nod for best director when the nominees for the 96th Academy Awards were announced Jan. 23.\n\nWith his nomination for \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" Scorsese, 81, now has been nominated for best director 10 times, becoming the most nominated living director in Academy Awards history.\n\nThe Western crime drama is nominated for best cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto; best production design for Jack Fisk and Adam Willis; best costume design for Jacqueline West and best editing for Thelma Schoonmaker.\n\n\"Killers of the Flower Moon\" received a best score nomination for the late Robbie Robertson. Robertson, who died last August at the age of 80, was the son of a Cayuga and Mohawk mother and lived on the Six Nations Reserve in Canada southwest of Toronto as a youth. After a 45-year partnership with Scorsese, the composer received his first Oscar nomination posthumously for \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\"\n\nThe movie also is nominated for best original song for “Wahzhazhe (A Song For My People),\" with music and lyrics by Oklahoma-based Osage Nation composer Scott George. The song was performed by Osage Tribal Singers.\n\nRobertson and George are the first Indigenous nominees in their respective categories. Plus, George is the first member of the Osage Nation to be nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nThe 96th Academy Awards are scheduled to air March 10 on ABC.\n\n'Killers of the Flower Moon' and 'Reservation Dogs' nominated for Writers Guild Awards\n\nUnlike most years, the Oscars won't be the grand finale of awards season.\n\nBecause of last year's lengthy writers strike, the Writers Guild Awards will not be handed out until April 14, more than a month after the Academy Awards.\n\n\"Killers of the Flower Moon\" is nominated for best adapted screenplay, recognizing the work by writer-director Martin Scorsese and co-writer Eric Roth to adapt David Grann's best-selling book \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\"\n\nIn the television categories, Tulsa native Bill Hader's acclaimed HBO series \"Barry\" earned a nomination for best comedy series. Along with Hader, the writers for the series, which ended in May 2023 with the Season 4 finale, include Mark Ashmore, Emma Barrie, Duffy Boudreau, Nicky Hirsch, Taofik Kolade and Liz Sarnoff.\n\nIn the episodic comedy category, the trailblazing Oklahoma series \"Reservation Dogs\" scored a nomination for “House Made of Bongs,\" an episode from last year's third and final season for the FX series that streams on Hulu. The episode was written by the series' Tulsa-based showrunner Sterlin Harjo and Tommy Pico.\n\nLily Gladstone makes history again by winning best actress at SAG Awards\n\n\"Killers of the Flower Moon\" star Lily Gladstone has made history again, this time by winning Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role Feb. 24 at the 30th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nGladstone becomes the first Indigenous performer to win in the best film actress category as well as the first Native American to ever win a SAG Award for an individual performance, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nStreaming live for the first time on Netflix, the SAG-AFTRA union's awards show honors the best in film and television performances from the previous year.\n\nGladstone seemed to fight back tears as presenter Jessica Chastain read her name as the best film actress winner. The star-studded crowd at Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall in Los Angeles rose to give Gladstone a standing ovation.\n\n\"It's truly a gift that we get to do this for a living. That's the win: It's getting to be here, it's getting to be on set, it's getting to tell stories. We bring empathy into a world that so much needs it,\" said Gladstone, who again briefly spoke the Blackfeet language while accepting the award.\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" continued to prove an awards season juggernaut Saturday night. Christopher Nolan's historical drama won the top film prize — Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture — at the SAG Awards.\n\nThe film's titular star, Cillian Murphy, took home The Actor trophy for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role, while Robert Downey Jr. continued to dominate the supporting actor category.\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph continued her triumphant run of the best supporting actress category with her breakthrough turn in \"The Holdovers.\"\n\nOn the TV side, \"The Bear,\" \"Beef,\" \"Succession,\" \"The Last of Us\" and \"The Crown\" were among the winners at this year's SAG Awards.\n\nBarbra Streisand accepted SAG-AFTRA’s highest tribute, the SAG Life Achievement Award.\n\nAfrican American Film Critics Association honors Lily Gladstone's breakout performance\n\nLily Gladstone's acclaimed turn in \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" has earned her the breakout performance prize from the African American Film Critics Association.\n\nThe association honored Gladstone and the other winners at the 15th annual AAFCA Awards Feb. 21 at the Beverly Wilshire in Beverly Hills, California.\n\n\"Killers of the Flower Moon\" also made AAFCA’s Top 10 Films list, along with \"American Fiction,\" \"Origin,\" \"The Color Purple,\" \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Past Lives,\" \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" and \"Poor Things.\"\n\n“American Fiction” and “The Color Purple” each won a leading four awards from the African American Film Critics Association.
