Academy Award-winner Thelma Schoonmaker has edited every Martin Scorsese movie for nearly four decades. She talks about cutting Scorsese’s latest project: the beautiful, meditative film “Silence.”

“[Scorsese] wanted to make the movie simple and classic,” Schoonmaker explains. “He deliberately did not want to make it look like any film being made today.” She also walks through how she edited the classic scenes in “Goodfellas” and “Raging Bull.”
