        "text": "“The relationship between genes and development is unknown.” This is the bold opening statement of the 1980 article by H. Robert Horvitz and John Sulston that reported the first step of a comprehensive genetic analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans cell lineage. In this article, Horvitz and Sulston demonstrated that systematic mutational analysis could dissect the regulation of the precise cell lineage of the nematode C. elegans. The article heralded a new wave of developmental analysis that would, over the next decade, make that opening statement false.\n\nIn 1977, Sulston and Horvitz had described the largely invariant postembryonic lineage of C. elegans, the most extensive cell lineage ever described. Although this extraordinary accomplishment was important for revealing key aspects of C. elegans development (for example, the existence of invariant programmed cell deaths and a few cases where position was clearly more important than lineage in determining cell fate), its main value was as a road map for studying development at the cellular level. Using this road map, Sulston, Horvitz, and their colleagues were able to frame hypotheses about regulative potential and intercellular interactions, design experiments to test those hypotheses by perturbing development using laser ablation, and, most importantly, interpret the consequences of their perturbations. This kind of classical experimental biology, although informative about general principles of development, revealed little about the role of genes in development.\n\nWorking in Sydney Brenner’s group at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (MRC LMB) in Cambridge and following on the groundwork of Brenner in developing the worm as a genetic model, it was natural that Horvitz and Sulston would appreciate the potential for combining mutational analysis with the cell lineage map to reveal the mechanisms by which genes contribute to the cell lineage, and hence the development, of the worm. Natural as it was, it was also an important first step into a new era of developmental genetics.\n\nBefore 1980, almost all existing mutations that perturbed development had been obtained by chance rather than design. In October 1980 that was changed with the publication of the Horvitz and Sulston article and the first report by Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus of genetic saturation screens to study segmentation in Drosophila embryos. The work leading up to these two articles was based on the same conceptual leap. Echoing thinking from C. H. Waddington in the 1930s, both groups believed that a systematic analysis of a collection of independent mutations affecting a developmental process would reveal mechanisms of development. History has proven that conceptual leap to be extremely productive.\n\nIn his lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Horvitz and colleagues continued to screen for cell lineage mutations, including mutations affecting vulval development, programmed cell death, the egg laying system, and mutations causing reiterations of the cell lineage (“heterochronic” or developmental timing mutants). They described the phenotypes, mapped the mutations, and established epistasis relationships among the genes. Meanwhile Sulston and colleagues at the MRC LMB finished the embryonic cell lineage in 1983 and then went on to construct a physical map of the C. elegans genome. Correlating the physical and genetic map greatly facilitated the isolation of the corresponding genes, making it possible to learn the biochemical activities and expression patterns of the encoded proteins. The combination of molecular and genetic analysis of the cell lineage contributed to our current understanding of the mechanisms controlling induction and development of the vulva, the core machinery of programmed cell death, the development of the muscles and nerves that control egg laying, the completely new field of the genetics of developmental timing, and the consequent discovery of microRNAs. Now, thanks in large part to the efforts heralded by the publication of this 1980 GENETICS article, we can confidently state that we know a tremendous amount about the relationship between genes and development. In 2002, Horvitz and Sulston shared with Sydney Brenner the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine “…for their discoveries concerning genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death.”"
