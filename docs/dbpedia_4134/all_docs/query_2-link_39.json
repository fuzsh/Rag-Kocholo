        "text": "Three developmental/molecular biologists have won this year's coveted Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for the study of the little roundworm called Caenorhabditis elegans, better known as C. elegans. The prize will be shared by Britons Sydney Brenner of the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, and John Sulston of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK, and American H. Robert Horvitz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Brenner had the genius to pick C. elegans, in the 1960s, as the model organism to study how genes control development. After earning his doctorate from Oxford in 1952, he worked at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, rising to the Directorship (1987-1992). During those many years he collaborated in the discovery of the triplet code of mRNA and ultimately established the importance of C. elegans in genetic research. The little (1 mm) soil nematode C. elegans turned out to be a brilliant choice of study because it grows easily in culture, is transparent and allows the researcher to study cell division in a simple visual format with a light microscope. John Sulston, who worked in Brenner's lab in the 1970s made many crucial observations. He noted the fate of each cell of the worm as it developed from egg to precisely 959 cells. Furthermore, when he discovered that these cells died in a certain repeatable fashion, the concept of “programmed cell death” was brought to light. Lastly, Horvitz, who also worked in Brenner's lab in Cambridge, identified the genes that controlled this programmed cell suicide. The genes were named ced-3 and ced-4, and had corresponding sister genes in humans. The concept of programmed cell death has since been studied for decades by a myriad of scientists and seems to have implications in HIV, neurodegenerative diseases, brain tumors and many other neoplastic processes. This trio of biologists combined in a cohesive, productive and beautiful fashion to focus on a complex problem in developmental biology with a well-chosen model. Their observations permitted scientists, for the first time, to tell the entire story of how cells go from egg to organism and then commit cell suicide, in a reproducible fashion. In 1998, Sydney Brenner wrote a powerful essay on The Impact of Society on Science (Science (Nov. 20) 282:1411-1412, 1998). In that essay he prophetically commented, “since all science is problem driven, it should be judged by the quality of the problems posed, and the quality of the solutions provided.” The Nobel Committee clearly rewarded the quality of the solutions these scientists provided in their lifelong scientific endeavors.\n\nRICHARD G.
