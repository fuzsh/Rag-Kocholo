        "text": "John Sulston (born March 27, 1942, Cambridge, England—died March 6, 2018) was a British biologist who, with Sydney Brenner and H. Robert Horvitz, won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2002 for their discoveries about how genes regulate tissue and organ development via a key mechanism called programmed cell death, or apoptosis.\n\nSulston earned a B.A. (1963) and a Ph.D. (1966) from the University of Cambridge. Following three years of postdoctoral work in the United States, he joined Brenner’s group at the Medical Research Council in England (1969). From 1992 to 2000 Sulston was director of the Sanger Institute in Cambridge.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFaces of Science\n\nSulston’s award-winning research examined programmed cell death. The process—in which certain cells, at the right time and place, get a signal to commit suicide—is vital for normal development in all animals. During the fetal development of humans, huge numbers of cells must be eliminated as body structures form. Programmed cell death sculpts the fingers and toes, for instance, by removing tissue that was present between the digits. Likewise, it removes surplus nerve cells produced during early development of the brain. In a typical adult human, about one trillion new cells develop each day; a similar number must be eliminated to maintain health and to keep the body from becoming overgrown with surplus cells."
