        "meta_description": "Howard Robert Horvitz is an American biologist best known for his research on the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, for which he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with Sydney Brenner and John E. Sulston. He currently studies how genes control the development of the nervous system and how the nervous system controls behavior.",

        "text": "H. Robert Horvitz received his Ph.D. in 1974 from Harvard University, under the tutelage of Jim Watson. He joined the MIT Department of Biology faculty in 1978, and was named David Koch Professor of Biology in 2000. He is also an Investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and was appointed Investigator at the McGovern Institute in 2001.\n\nHorvitz is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and a recipient of the Gairdner Foundation International Award, the Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. Prize from the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation and the Bristol-Myers Squibb Award for Distinguished Achievement in Neuroscience. In 2002, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine with Sydney Brenner and John Sulston “for their discoveries concerning ‘genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death’.”\n\nHorvitz currently studies how genes control the development of the nervous system and how the nervous system controls behavior. He has elucidated a molecular genetic pathway for programmed cell death (apoptosis), which is fundamental to nervous system development in all animals."
