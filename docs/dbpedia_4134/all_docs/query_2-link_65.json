        "text": "Jonas Salk\n\nSalk Institute Founder\n\nHailed as a “miracle worker” in 1955 for developing the first safe and effective polio vaccine, Salk went on to found his eponymous institute in 1960. He became the first Institute president on December 28, 1960 and served until March 7, 1962. Salk died June 23, 1995 at the age of 80.\n\nUrsula Bellugi\n\nDistinguished Professor Emerita and Founder’s Chair\n\nBellugi pioneered the neurobiology of American Sign Language (ASL). She was the first to demonstrate that ASL is a true language, leading to the discovery that the same areas of the brain that specialize in spoken language are activated by sign language. Her work also provided a better understanding of Williams syndrome and autism, conditions that affect social behaviors in opposite ways. Bellugi died April 17, 2022, at the age of 91.\n\nRead more »\n\nSydney Brenner\n\nDistinguished Professor Emeritus\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist shaped the modern understanding of the genetic code. Brenner joined the Institute in 2000 and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2002, along with H. Robert Horvitz and John Sulston, for their pioneering research using the translucent microscopic worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. Brenner died April 5, 2019 at the age of 92.\n\nRead more»\n\nJacob Bronowski\n\nFounding Resident Fellow\n\nA British mathematician who worked for the UK’s Ministry of Home Security during World War II, Bronowski developed mathematical approaches to bombing strategy.

He was a nonresident fellow of Salk from 1973 to 1985 and served on Salk’s board of trustees from 1975 to 1985. Edelman died May 17, 2014 at the age of 84.\n\nRoger Guillemin\n\nDistinguished Professor Emeritus\n\nConsidered the “father of neuroendocrinology,” Guillemin shared the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for “discoveries concerning the peptide hormone production of the brain.” His discoveries led to advancements in the medical treatment of infertility and prostate cancer. He served as the Salk Institute’s interim president from October 2007 to February 2009. Guillemin died on February 21, 2024, at the age of 100.\n\nRead more »\n\nStephen Heinemann\n\nProfessor\n\nIn 1970, Heinemann was invited to join the core faculty of the Salk Institute, and was among its very first neuroscientists. He established Salk’s Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory, a program that by the late 1980s was ranked number one in the world. He died August 6, 2014 at the age of 75.\n\nRead more»\n\nRobert Holley\n\nResident Fellow\n\nIn 1968, two years after his arrival at the Salk Institute as a professor and fellow, biochemist Holley received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the structure of transfer-RNA. He remained at the Institute until his death on February 11, 1993 at the age of 71.\n\nEdwin Lennox\n\nFounding Resident Fellow\n\nLennox, an expert in physics and cellular and molecular immunology, had a long career in science, spanning several fields of research, with more than 100 research papers to his name. He was among the first four fellows to join the Salk Institute alongside Melvin Cohn, Jacob Bronowski and Renato Dulbecco.\n\nSalvador Luria\n\nFounding Nonresident Fellow\n\nThe Italian microbiologist became one of the first nonresident fellows of Salk in 1965.
