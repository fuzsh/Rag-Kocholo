        "text": "An American and two Britons won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine yesterday for their discoveries, made largely in studies of a tiny worm, of how healthy cells are instructed to kill themselves. The process, called programmed cell death or apoptosis, is necessary for the proper tissue and organ development, but also plays a role in many diseases.\n\nThey are Sydney Brenner, 75, a British citizen who founded the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley, Calif., and who is a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego; H. Robert Horvitz, 55, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator; and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, England.\n\nThe three, who worked together in Cambridge, England, in the 1970's, will share a $1 million prize. The prize honors their collective work, over the last 30 years, on C. elegans, a 1-millimeter soil worm or nematode.\n\nThe investigation of programmed cell death have given scientists better insights into cancer and the way some viruses and bacteria invade human cells, according to the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which selected the winners. The body uses cell suicide in immune cell development and function, and for removing unnecessary or damaged cells."
