        "text": "Daniel Aberdam, PhD, INSERM Unit U898, France, INSERTECH, Israel\n\nFrance, Paris - Daniel Aberdam completed his first degrees at Pierre and Marie Curie University (Paris, France) and his PhD at the Weizmann Institute (Israël) on the oncogenic potential of homeotic genes, under the supervision of Professor Leo Sachs. He currently holds the position of INSERM Director of Research and Long Term Visiting Professor of the Israeli Institute of Technology (Technion). He is Director of the INSERM Unit U898 (Nice, France) and Director of INSERTECH (Technion). His scientific interests focus on epithelial gene regulation and skin physiopathology. Lately, his group developed strategies to recapitulate in vitro embryonic skin development derived from embryonic stem cell lines. The current projects developed by his teams are centered around the function and regulation of p63, a p53-related epithelial master gene and the use of pluripotent stem cells as cellular models and for cell and gene therapies.\n\nKEYWORDS: stem cells; development; genetics; epithelial cancers; genotoxic stress\n\nEl Bachir Affar, MSc, PhD, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Canada\n\nMontréal - Canada, El Bachir Affar is a principal investigator at the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, where he leads the Cellular Signaling and Cancer Research unit. He holds a position as a full professor in the Department of Medicine and an accredited professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine at the University of Montréal. His academic career began with a B.Sc. equivalent in Animal Biology from University Hassan II in Morocco, followed by a M.Sc. degree equivalent in Cell Biology, Physiology, and Toxicology from University Paris VII, France. He then pursued a Ph.D. in Physiology-Endocrinology at Laval University in Canada. His postdoctoral studies included work at Harvard Medical School, where he furthered his expertise in cell signaling in the context of chromatin biology and co-discovered the shRNA approach. Dr. Affar's current research is primarily focused on understanding the mechanisms of cellular signaling through ubiquitination and deubiquitination and the molecular basis of cancer, with a special emphasis on the BAP1 gene, known for its tumor suppressor functions in various cancer types. His approach utilizes advanced techniques in biochemistry, genomics and proteomics. His significant contributions to understanding the ubiquitin system have been recognized with several awards and honors.\n\nKeywords: ubiquitin signaling, deubiquitination, chromatin, epigenetics, apoptosis, liquid-liquid phase separation.\n\nIvano Amelio, PhD, University of Konstanz, Germany\n\nProf. Dr. Ivano Amelio holds the Carl Zeiss Endowed Chair for Systems Toxicology at the University of Konstanz, Germany. He received his training at the MRC Toxicology Unit of the University of Cambridge, where he was first awarded (in 2011) a Career Developmental Postdoctoral Fellowship and was later promoted (in 2015) to a Senior Scientist position. Originally, he received his PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (2011) from the University of Rome TorVergata (Italy). In 2020 Ivano was awarded the prestigious AIRC Start-Up program, which led him to a tenure-track professorship with a joint appointment between the TOR Centre of Excellence in Rome (Italy) and University of Nottingham (UK) until 2022, when he joined the University of Konstanz.\n\nIvano is a member of the board of directors of the European Cell Death Organisation (ECDO) and member of a number of international advisory boards. He has served as Editor-in-Chief of Cell Death Discovery since 2018 and as member of the editorial board of Cell Death & Disease and Molecular & Cellular Oncology since 2017 and 2014 respectively.\n\nKEYWORDS: p53, DNA damage response, hypoxia, miR, skin biology\n\nNicolas G Bazan, MD, LSU Neuroscience Center of Excellence, USA\n\nUSA, New Orleans - After obtaining his MD in Tucuman, Argentina, Dr Nicolas Bazan was a postdoc at P&S, Columbia University, and Harvard Medical School. In his first lab at the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, Toronto, he found that ischemia or seizures cause an increase in free arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid pools in the brain. He then discovered that the lipid mediator platelet activating factor (PAF) is released by injury and that PAF antagonism is protective in experimental stroke. He identified PAF binding in synaptic and intracellular membranes; defined PAF-mediated regulation of early gene expression; and found that PAF mediates long-term potentiation and memory. He also uncovered that the supply of the omega-3 fatty acid DHA to synapses is liver-regulated and that DHA is retained in photoreceptors by a \"short loop\" (RPE-to-photoreceptors) and a \"long loop\" (liver-to-retina). He found that Usher's Syndrome patients have DHA shortage in the blood, implicating the long loop in retinal degenerations. He and his colleagues discovered the synthesis and bioactivity of neuroprotectin D1, which arrests apoptosis at the pre-mitochondrial level, is anti-inflammatory, and is neuroprotective in experimental stroke and Alzheimer's disease models. He found NPD1 is decreased in the CA1 area of Alzheimer's patients. The recognitions he has received include the Javits Neuroscience Award, NINDS, NIH; elected to Royal Academy of Medicine, Spain; elected fellow, Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, Dublin; and Proctor Medal, the highest honour of The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology. He is the founding director of the LSU Neuroscience Center of Excellence, New Orleans. Dr Bazan's research focuses on synaptic signaling in neuronal plasticity, cell survival signaling in epilepsy and ischemia-reperfusion, and inflammatory signaling in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerations.\n\nKEYWORDS: neurodegeneration, Alzheimer’s disease, ophthalmology, retinal diseases, apoptosis\n\nEric H Baehrecke, PhD, University of Massachusetts Medical School, USA\n\nUSA, Worcester - Eric Baehrecke obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin – Madison, and was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Fellow of the Life Sciences Research Foundation at the University of Utah during his postdoctoral studies. He was a faculty member of the University of Maryland from 1995-2007, and is currently a Professor in the Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. His team studies the regulation and function of autophagy in cell survival and cell death, and the mechanisms controlling non-apoptotic cell death.\n\nKEYWORDS: autophagy, apoptosis, Drosophila\n\nMarco E. Bianchi, MSc, San Raffaele University in Milano, Italy\n\nItaly, Milan - Marco E. Bianchi is Professor of Molecular Biology a San Raffaele University in Milano, where he also served in various managerial roles. He is most interested in inflammation, both in trauma and cancer, and in epigenetics. He first found that High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1) is a DNA chaperone that both recognizes and induces DNA bending. He then realized that nuclear HMGB1 can be passively released or actively secreted by dead or stressed cells, and serves as a Damage Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP). DAMPs are signals of tissue distress that Polly Matzinger had hypothesized in her “Danger Theory” to initiate immune responses, but had not been identified experimentally. He then showed that HMGB1 has multiple redox forms that bind different receptors. The switching of HMGB1 between its redox forms is critical for the damaged tissue to decide to continue inflammation or start healing. In cancer as well, HMGB1 redox forms support tumor growth or instruct immune responses, for example in Immunogenic Cell Death. He also demonstrated that the number of nucleosomes is actively controlled by the cells. The variation in nucleosome number is now an emerging theme in epigenetics, with implications for aging, cancer and inflammation. To date, Marco E. Bianchi has authored more than 200 publications, and is a coinventor on 13 patents. He founded Hmgbiotech, where he still is a co-owner.\n\nKEYWORDS: inflammation, epigenetics, HMGB1, DAMPs, immunogenic cell death\n\nChristoph Borner, MSc, PhD, Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg, Germany\n\nGermany, Freiburg - Christoph Borner studied Biology at the University in Basel where he graduated in 1984 with a specialization in biochemistry. He continued his training under the supervision of Prof. Urs Eppenberger and Dr. Doriano Fabbro at the Women’s Hospital of the University of Basel and received his PhD in 1988 on the topic of the immunological and biochemical characterization of protein kinase C (PKC) in human breast cancer cells. He then got a postdoctoral fellowship of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) to join the laboratory of Prof. I. Bernhard Weinstein at the Columbia University in New York City to continue his work on the potential oncogenic function of particular PKC isoforms. In 1991 he returned to Switzerland to perform a second postdoc/maître assistant position in the laboratory of Prof. Jürg Tschopp at the Institute of Biochemistry of the University of Lausanne in Epalinges. Here he completely changed the research topic and started to work on apoptosis, in particular the characterization of the survival factor Bcl-2, the only known member of the protein family at that time. After 2 years, he succeeded to obtain a prestigious SNF START grant (today called Junior Professorship) to become for the first time an independent group leader at the Institute of Biochemistry of the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. He continued to work on the Bcl-2 family (in particular on its binding partners and subcellular localization) and also began studying caspase-independent cell death mechanisms.\n\nIn 2000 he was appointed as Associate Professor in Medical Cell Research at the Institute of Molecular Medicine of the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg, Germany. He was promoted to Full Professor at the same institution in 2006 and was the first to win the competition to build up a doctoral/graduate school (the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, SGBM) in the frame of the German Excellence Initiative in Freiburg. He successfully defended the school for the second funding phase in 2012 and also became an executive board member of the excellence research cluster BIOSS (Centre of Biological Signaling Studies). He also helped building up a new study track in Molecular Medicine from 2000 on and was its study dean from 2009-2010. Recently, he became the director of the International Master Program in Medical and Biological Sciences (IMBS) between the Universities of Buenos Aires and Freiburg and received the Doctor honoris causa of the University of Buenos Aires for his achievement in the program. Since he started to work in Freiburg, Germany, Christoph Borner has made major contributions to the field of interaction partners and posttranslational modifications of Bcl-2 family members, mechanisms of caspase-independent cell death and, more recently, identification of death signaling pathways induced by viruses and fungi as well as by FasL in conjunction with TNFα in primary hepatocytes.\n\nKEYWORDS: Bcl-2 family members, caspase-independent cell death, death signaling pathways, FasL, TNF\n\nDirk Brenner, PhD, Luxembourg Institute of Health​, Luxembourg\n\nDirk Brenner studied at the Universities of Bonn and Witten/Herdecke in Germany, and received further training at Stanford University and Harvard University. He completed his PhD with Dr. Peter H. Krammer at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, Germany. As an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow, he pursued his postdoctoral training under Dr. Tak W. Mak in Toronto, Canada.\n\nDr. Brenner has since established his own laboratory in Luxembourg, where he serves as the Deputy Director of the Department of Infection and Immunity at the Luxembourg Institute of Health, and is Full Professor of Immunology and Genetics at the University of Luxembourg. His research is dedicated to understanding the metabolic regulation of the immune system, particularly in the context of inflammation and cancer. He has made significant contributions to our understanding of the role of redox control and reactive oxygen species, investigating how these factors influence metabolism, immune cell function and contribute to disease processes.\n\nKeywords: Immunometabolism, Reactive Oxygen Species, Immunology\n\nEleonora Candi, PhD, University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Italy\n\nItaly, Rome - Eleonora Candi, received the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences of University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, in 1995. She did her pre- and post-doctoral training, from 1993-1998, at the Skin Biology Branch, NIAMS, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA, working under the supervision of Dr PM Steinert on transglutaminases and their substrates. From 1999 to 2001 she received a Telethon Research Fellowship to study the role of transglutaminases in the genetic disease lamellar ichthyosis. Currently, she is full-professor in Molecular Biology at the University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Department of Experimental Medicine and Surgery. Her current research interests include the role of p63, homolog of p53, and non-coding RNAs in epithelia development and tumour formation, using both in vitro and in vivo models.\n\nKEYWORDS: skin development, skin cancer, p53/p63, non-coding RNAs, animal models\n\nFrancis Ka-Ming Chan, PhD, Duke University School of Medicine, USA\n\nUSA, Durham - Francis Chan is Professor and Vice Chair of the Department of Immunology at the Duke University School of Medicine. He graduated from the University of California, San Diego with Summa Cum Laude and went to the University of California, Berkeley for his PhD study. He was a Cancer Research Institute (New York) postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Michael Lenardo at the National Institutes of Health. He started his independent research group at the University of Massachusetts Medical School where he rose through the ranks and became Full Professor and the Chair of the Immunology and Microbiology Program. In 2018, he moved to Duke University School of Medicine. Francis’ research interests center around cytokine signaling, cell death (especially necroptosis), host-pathogen interaction and immune responses.\n\nKeywords:TNF, inflammation, viral infection, cancer, necroptosis, apoptosis, immune responses\n\nNavdeep Chandel, BA, PhD, Northwestern University, USA\n\nUSA, Chicago - Navdeep Chandel is a professor in the Department of Medicine and Cell Biology at Northwestern University located in Chicago. He received a BA in mathematics and Ph.D. in Cell Physiology at University of Chicago. He also did his post-doctoral work at University of Chicago. In 2000, he established his lab at Northwestern University focusing on the role of mitochondria as signaling organelles. Historically, mitochondria have been primarily viewed as biosynthetic and bioenergetic organelles. His work has elucidated that mitochondria participate in signaling by releasing reactive oxygen species which regulate distinct biological outcomes including differentiation, proliferation, and adaptation to stress.\n\nKEYWORDS: mitochondria, ROS, immunology, lung cancer\n\nAaron Ciechanover, MSc, MD, DSc, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Israel\n\nIsrael, Haifa - Aaron Ciechanover was born in Haifa, Israel in 1947. He is a Distinguished Professor in the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. He received his M.Sc. (1971) and M.D. (1975) from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and his D.Sc. (1982) from the Technion. There, as a graduate student with Dr. Avram Hershko and in collaboration with Dr. Irwin A. Rose from the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, USA, they discovered that covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a target protein signals it for degradation. They deciphered the mechanism of conjugation, described the general proteolytic functions of the system, and proposed a model according to which this modification serves as a recognition signal for a specific downstream protease.\n\nAs a post doctoral fellow with Dr. Harvey Lodish at the M.I.T., he continued his studies on the ubiquitin system and made additional important discoveries. It is now clear that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis plays major roles in numerous cellular processes, and aberrations in the system underlie the pathogenesis of many diseases, among them certain malignancies and neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, the system has become an important platform for drug development. Among the numerous prizes Ciechanover received are the 2000 Albert Lasker Award, the 2003 Israel Prize, and the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (shared with Hershko and Rose). Among many academies, Ciechanover is a member of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA (Foreign Associate) and the Israeli Academy of Sciences and Humanities.\n\nKEYWORDS: pathogenetic mechanisms of diseases, malignancies and neurodegenerative disorders, ubiquitin‐mediated protein degradation\n\nRune Busk Damgaard, MSc, PhD, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark\n\nDenmark, Copenhagen - Dr Rune Busk Damgaard is an Associate Professor and research group leader at Department of Biotechnology and Biomedicine at the Technical University of Denmark.

Director of the Department of Life Sciences since 2012 and Full Professor in Applied Biology since 2001 at the University of Trieste, Italy, Giannino Del Sal is Chief of the Molecular Oncology Unit at Laboratorio Nazionale CIB (LNCIB) in Area Science Park in Trieste since 1996.\n\nGiannino Del Sal graduated in Biology at the University of Trieste, and had his research training at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in Trieste, at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, at LNCIB in Trieste and at the University of Trieste. Thereafter, he worked as an associate expert at ICGEB in the Cell and Genome Studies Unit, as a visiting scientist in the Laboratory of Cell Biology of the US biotech company Mitotix Inc. in Cambridge, and as an assistant and associate professor in Applied Biology at the University of Trieste.\n\nSince the beginning of hisscientific career, Del Sal's research has been mainly focused on tumor biology, embracing and integrating the study of the mechanisms of tumor suppression in health and cancer, the investigation of the role of different oncogenic pathways in cancer development and metastasis, and more translational activities devoted to the development of new tools for cancer therapy.\n\nDel Sal was the first to clone the Sonic Hedgehog binding protein GAS1, and to characterize its functions in the context of growth arrest. His team discovered new post-translational modifications and new sub-cellular localizations of the tumor suppressor p53, as well as new regulatory mechanisms of p53 and p53 family proteins. Focused on the role of phospho-dependent protein conformational changes as key signal transduction events in cancer, his group highlighted the role of the prolyl-isomerase Pin1 in Notch pathway control and in the control of proliferation and maintenance of normal and cancer stem cells of the mammary epithelium. His team discovered the contribution of Pin1 to full activation of mutant p53 oncogenic functions and characterized the proteasome machinery as a key target of a common gain-of-function program shared by diverse missense mutants of p53 in cancer. Del Sal's group discovered new hormonal and metabolic mechanisms of control of the Hippo pathway transducers YAP/TAZ, and using drug repositioning approaches identified compounds able to target YAP/TAZ and mutant p53 pathways in triple negative breast cancer.\n\nTo date, Giannino Del Salauthored over 120 publications among scientific articles,reviews and book chapters. He is also inventor of two patents. In 2006 he was elected member of EMBO.\n\nKEYWORDS: p53, Hedgehog pathway, Hippo pathway, YAP/TAZ\n\nVishva Mitra Dixit, BM BCh, MD, Genentech, USA\n\nUSA, San Francisco - Vishva Dixit has conducted pioneering studies defining key components of the cell death pathway.

She holds appointments in the Schools of Public Health and Medicine, Departments of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Neurology, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, and Oncology. She earned a PhD in microbiology from the University of Kansas and was a postdoctoral fellow in virology at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. Her lab uses mouse, Drosophila and yeast genetic model systems to understand the molecular determinants of cell death, particularly in the brain. The overall strategy is to det­ermine the normal cellular function of cell death factors.\n\nThe Hardwick lab identified non-apoptotic \"day-job\" functions of anti- and pro-apoptotic regulators of cell death including cellular and viral BCL-2 family proteins. They found that BCL-2 family proteins and caspases regulate viral pathogenesis in the brain, that BCL-2 family proteins can be cleaved by caspases to convert them from anti- to pro-death functions, and that BCL-2 proteins regulate neuronal activity and alter seizure behaviors in mice. BCL-xL regulates membrane structure, mitochondrial membrane dynamics and energetics. She developed yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model to identify novel factors that mediate gene-dependent cell death. These approaches also revealed the pressures of cell death on genome evolution. Knocking out any individual gene in the yeast genome leads to two mutations, the engineered gene knockout and a specific second evolved mutation in another gene that dramatically alters cell death and/or growth rates. These evolved yeast mutations have led to the identification of new human disease genes that cause neurodegeneration. She is the inaugural David Bodian Professor and is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nKEYWORDS: Bcl-2 family proteins, mitochondria, cell energetics, yeast genetics, neurodegeneration\n\nH Robert Horvitz, PhD, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA\n\nUSA, Boston - Dr. H Robert Horvitz received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2002.

She was awarded an IARC WHO fellowship to come to the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London in 1986 and studied for her PhD under Birgit Lane. In 1993 she joined the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR), St. Mary's Branch, Imperial College as an Assistant Member and was progressively promoted to LICR Full Member and Professor at Imperial College in 2000. In 2004, she was appointed as the Director of the LICR’s UCL Branch but moved the unit to Oxford in 2007. She is an elected Member of EMBO and Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\nProfessor Lu's research is focused on understanding tumour suppression and to identify molecular switches that selectively kill cancer cells. Cancer is a disease where cells grow in the wrong place at the wrong time. Regenerative medicine involves growing cells to replace the ones that were lost or damaged. Therefore, understanding molecular mechanisms that control cell growth is vital, both to stop cancer cell growth and to grow normal cells to replace the damaged ones. Professor Lu's research team has been one of the major research groups in the world to study the regulation of the tumour suppressor function of the p53 protein whose function is lost in most human cancers. The majority of nuclear import pathways are mediated by importin-cargo interactions. Yet around 50% of all nuclear proteins do not use this pathway. Through a detailed understanding of the regulation of the ASPP proteins, Professor Lu's group has identified identified a code that defines RaDAR as a novel nuclear import pathway of ankyrin repeats (AR) containing proteins. AR is a structural motif found in over 250 human proteins with diverse functions. The RaDAR (RanGDP/AR) pathway is acquired by the most common familial melanoma-associated CDKN2A mutation, leading to nuclear accumulation of mutant p16ink4a. It is frequently used by AR-containing transcriptional regulators, especially those regulating NF-ĸB/p53. All these suggest the existence of an Ankyrin repeats signaling and its role in infection and cancer.\n\nKEYWORDS: apoptosis, p53, EBV, ASPP proteins, Ankyrin repeats signaling\n\nJan Paul Medema, MSc, PhD, Amsterdam University Medical Centre, The Netherlands\n\nThe Netherlands, Amsterdam - Jan Paul Medema studied Chemistry in Leiden graduating in 1991 with a specialisation in biochemistry and medical biochemistry. He continued his training under the guidance of professor Hans Bos at the University of Utrecht and received his PhD in 1996 on the topic of the oncoprotein p21Ras. He then decided to study the role of programmed cell death in tumor biology and immunology in order to understand the basic concepts of cell death signalling and the way these are perturbed in cancer. He unravelled several modes of cell death escape, specifically in the face of a cytotoxic immune response. Later on his work moved into the direction of cancer heterogeneity and its role in cell death resistance, tumor growth and therapy response. His work centers around the role of cancer stem cells in these processes as well as the role of inter-patient heterogeneity in the aggressiveness of tumors.\n\nKEYWORDS: programmed cell death, tumor biology, immunology, cancer heterogeneity, cancer stem cells\n\nJames Murphy, PhD, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia\n\nAustralia, Melbourne – James Murphy is Head of the Inflammation Division at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia.

His research is focused on programmed cell death and how defects in this process cause cancer or autoimmune disease and affect the response of tumour cells to anti-cancer therapy. Key discoveries have been that abnormalities in cell death control can cause cancer or autoimmune disease; that Bcl-2 antagonizes multiple pathways to cell death; that Bcl-2 collaborates with c-myc in tumorigenesis; that Bcl-2 inhibits the death of lymphocytes that fail to receive a signal through cytokine or antigen receptors; that Bcl-2 and death receptors regulate distinct pathways to apoptosis; that DNA damage can induce apoptosis in lymphocytes via a pathway that is independent of p53 but can be blocked by Bcl-2; the discovery of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim and Bmf; that BH3-only proteins are essential for initiation of programmed cell death and stress-induced apoptosis; that Bim is required for negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes and mature T cells; that the BH3-only proteins Puma and Noxa are essential for DNA damage-induced apoptosis mediated by the tumour suppressor p53. Current efforts include determination of which anti-apoptotic proteins are essential for the development and, more important for clinical translation, the sustained growth of different cancer types. This includes efforts to develop antagonists of pro-survival proteins for cancer therapy.\n\nKEYWORDS: apoptosis, cancer, chemoresistance, hematology\n\nQiang Sun, PhD, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China\n\nChina, Beijing – Qiang Sun obtained his PhD in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at the Forth Medical University, Xi’an, under the supervision of Professor Hua Han. Then, he moved to Beijing Institute of Biotechnology where he systemically investigated the mutual regulation between TGF-beta signaling and miRNAs. During that period, he independently discovered and investigated cell-in-cell structures before postdoctoral research with Dr. Michael Overholtzer in MSKCC. His postdoctoral work identified entosis as a mammalian mechanism of cell competition that promotes clonal selection and tumor evolution. He is currently a full professor of cell biology in Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, and director of the Research unit of Cell Death Mechanism, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. His lab is dedicated to basic and translational studies related to cell death and diseases, in particular those involving cell-in-cell formation homotypically among tumor cells, and/or heterotypically between tumor and immune cells.\n\nKEYWORDS: cell-in-cell, entosis, cell cannibalism, cell fusion, aneuploidy, mitotic surveillance, cancer, virological disease\n\nDavid Vaux, MD, PhD, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Australia\n\nAustralia, Melbourne - David Vaux is currently at The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI), in Melbourne, Australia. He graduated in medicine from the University of Melbourne, before completing a PhD at WEHI, and a post-doc at Stanford. He is best known for his work on Bcl-2, having found in 1988 that it acted, unlike other oncogenes known at the time, to inhibit cell death, rather than promoting cell proliferation. By showing human Bcl-2 could inhibit developmental cell death in C. elegans, he showed that apoptosis and programmed cell death were the same, evolutionarily conserved process. He was among those who first identified the mammalian inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, and their mammalian antagonists, such as Smac/Diablo. He is currently on the Scientific Advisory Board of TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals.\n\nKEYWORDS: Bcl-2, IAP protein family, apoptosis\n\nAndreas Villunger, BSc, MSc, PhD, Medical University Innsbruck, Austria\n\nAustria, Innsbruck - Professor Andreas Villunger conducted his undergraduate studies in Biology in Salzburg and Innsbruck, Austria, and obtained his Master and PhD degrees for research on cytokine signalling in multiple myeloma.
