        "text": "Dr. Bruce Alberts\n\nEditor-in-Chief of Science\n\n\"Partnering with the annual meeting of the AAAS, the American Junior Academy of Science convention offers young scientists an opportunity to present scientific papers at a poster session and to participate in activities that are tailored to the interest of high school age scientists. This convention also serves the important function of introducing the students to the wider science community, which is very well represented by the other, older attendees at the AAAS meeting.\"\n\n\"It has been my pleasure to attend the AJAS Breakfast with Scientists for the last few years, and to meet the bright, enthusiastic young scientists who are taking an important new step at the start of their scientific careers. I have also had the privilege of brainstorming with the AJAS leadership about sharing resources and ideas.\"\n\nBruce Alberts, a prominent biochemist with a strong commitment to the improvement of science and mathematics education, serves as Editor-in-Chief of Science and as one of President Obama‘s first three Science Envoys. Alberts is also Professor Emeritus in the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco, to which he returned after serving two six-year terms as the president of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).\n\nDuring his tenure at the NAS, Alberts was instrumental in developing the landmark National Science Education standards that have been implemented in school systems nationwide. The type of science as inquiry teaching we need, says Alberts, emphasizes logical, hands-on problem solving, and it insists on having evidence for claims that can be confirmed by others. It requires work in cooperative groups, where those with different types of talents can discover them – developing self confidence and an ability to communicate effectively with others.\n\nAlberts is also noted as one of the original authors of The Molecular Biology of the Cell, a preeminent textbook in the field now in its fifth edition. For the period 2000 to 2009, he served as the co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, a new organization in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of 15 national academies of sciences and that was established to provide scientific advice to the world.\n\nCommitted in his international work to the promotion of the creativity, openness and tolerance that are inherent to science, Alberts believes that scientists all around the world must now band together to help create more rational, scientifically-based societies that find dogmatism intolerable.\n\nWidely recognized for his work in the fields of biochemistry and molecular biology, Alberts has earned many honors and awards, including 16 honorary degrees. He currently serves on the advisory boards of more than 25 non-profit institutions, including the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttp://biochemistry.ucsf.edu/labs/alberts/\n\nReturn to Top\n\nLarry Bock, MBA, Entrepreneur\n\nLawrence A. \"Larry\" Bock (September 21, 1959 – July 6, 2016) will always be remembered as a true friend of AJAS.\n\nFounder and Organizer of the USA Science & Engineering Festival\n\nThese are both exciting and challenging times in science -- a period when new technological advances, spawned by creative ideas and innovation, stand to impact our everyday world like no time before. This is why I, as an entrepreneur in biotechnology, am particularly pleased to be associated with the American Junior Academy of Science and similar organizations that encourage and motivate young students in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).\n\n\"I especially want students to know that in the emerging fields of life and physical science, biotech start-up research companies are making a significant contribution to scientific innovation – from drug discovery, genetics and neuroscience to evolution, renewable energy and materials science. In my continued involvement with AJAS, I look forward to communicating with young people about these and other exciting opportunities the start-up arena has to offer, including how students can combine their interest in science with entrepreneurial skills to make a real impact in biotechnology and nanotechnology.\n\nLarry Bock was Founder and Organizer of the USA Science & Engineering Festival – the largest celebration of science and engineering of its kind in the country. He was also a successful serial entrepreneur who has founded, co-founded or financed the early stage growth of 50 companies in the life and physical sciences from inception to achieving an aggregate market capitalization in excess of $70 billion.\n\nHe was also the inspiration and executive director of the Inaugural San Diego Science Festival and USA Science & Engineering Festival which were the world‘s largest science festival of their kind in their first year. Bock is now organizing the 2nd USA Science Festival which will take place in the spring of 2012.

Guidotti, MD, MPH\n\nPast-President of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Honor Society\n\nAAAS Fellow\n\nAJAS Fellow\n\nThe American Junior Academy of Science was a key experience in launching my career in science. While I was a high school student in Burbank, California, I did research in the summer of 1965 in the biophysics laboratory of Dr. Myles Maxfield at the University of Southern California, under a program of the Committee for Advancement in Science and Technology, managed by Dr. Harry Sobel. People noticed and I was invited to present the work at the AJAS session at the AAAS Meeting in Berkeley, California, in 1965.\n\nThat experience introduced me into the real and adult world of how scientists communicate and exchange information rigorously and dispassionately. Successfully navigating that experience encouraged me in my interest in science and led me to take part in enrichment programs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, which was a long drive on a Saturday morning – I got a ride every week with the Lehman family. Under the mentorship of Dr. Gretchen Sibley I became President of the Museum Student Association and edited the science journal before graduating high school in 1967.\"\n\n\"Fifty years later, I have mentored my own students and served as leadership (as President of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Honor Society), and as editor of an important journal in my field. I learned to do these things well by doing them early. I give back through participation in the AJAS Breakfast with Scientists and the Sigma Xi Student Research Forum.\n\nLooking back on those early years, I would not have had the confidence to be a leader in science and to do these things without the encouragement that AJAS gave me. A child‘s interest in science needs to be sustained as they become teenagers. I know that having such an intense, deep interest in science sets young people apart from their peers during adolescence and young adulthood. Being with others who share their enthusiasm and focus gives validation and encouragement when young people need it most. Today, I get a thrill from interacting with these keen young minds and watching them achieve and grow confident, as I did from rich experiences.\n\nDr. Guidotti was raised in Burbank, California, a city with a strong science and engineering foundation due to the Lockheed Corporation‘s headquarters and legendary Skunk Works and the technical side of the entertainment industry (especially animation, due to Disney Studios and Warner Brothers) due to its concentration of television, movie, and studios. He haunted the local branch of the Burbank Public Library, was a member of its science club in elementary school, and became a Smokey the Bear Junior Forest Ranger by reading and discussing books on conservation and the environment. He attended John Burroughs High School and participated in several enrichment programs that proved critical to his understanding and appreciation of science. He attended the University of Southern California in Biological Sciences, becoming President of the Biology Students Association and in 1969 he founded a campus organization devoted to the environment that sponsored Earth Day (1970) and helped build both a coalition of ecology groups in Southern California and a federation of student ecology groups in California. However, he went to medical school at the University of California at San Diego to become a physician and public health practitioner with a career interest in the environment. He then completed medical training in internal medicine, pulmonary medicine, and occupational medicine and obtained his MPH at Johns Hopkins. He has devoted his career to occupational and environmental health, at the University of Alberta and the George Washington University, from which he retired in 2009 to launch a second career as an international consultant. In 2015 he was a Fulbright Visiting Research Professor at the University of Ottawa in the Institute for Science, Society, and Policy. He has received numerous awards (including the Knudsen Award, in occupational medicine) and fellowships (including AAAS) in occupational medicine, environmental health, and science. In addition to specific technical contributions in occupational health and air quality research, he has played a major role in shaping modern occupational and environmental medicine as a visible, evidence-based medical specialization. His work has focused recently on health and problems of environmental sustainability. He has served as President of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Honor Society, and is active with the Council of Scientific Society Presidents.\n\nWebpage: www.teeguidotti.com\n\nReturn to Top\n\nDr. H. Robert Horvitz, Ph.D., Biologist\n\n2002 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine\n\nHHMI Investigator\n\nProfessor of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nDr. H. Robert Horvitz was born in Chicago, IL in 1947. He attended DeWitt Clinton Elementary School and East Prairie Grammar School. After graduating from Niles Township Community High School (East Division) in Skokie, IL, he enrolled at MIT where he received two degrees, in mathematics and economics. He then enrolled in the PhD program in biology at Harvard University where he worked in the laboratories of James Watson and Walter Gilbert studying the bacterial virus T4 and mechanisms of controlling gene expression. He did his postdoctoral work in Cambridge, England in the laboratory of Sydney Brenner. There he began his studies of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In 1978 he became a faculty member in the Department of Biology at MIT. He shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Sydney Brenner and John Sulston for discovering and characterizing genes controlling programmed cell death (apoptosis) in and organ development of C. elegans.\n\nIn his Nobel autobiography, Dr. Horvitz wrote, \"It was my mother, with her interest and knowledge as a science teacher, who encouraged my first experiences with experimental science. My sixth grade science project, which I think was her idea, was entitled 'Electricity Produces Light through Heat' and won a third prize. My ninth grade project, in which I used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to replicate Gregor Mendel's famed 3:1 and 9:3:3:1 inheritance ratios, required my mother to relinquish her bathroom for my breeding experiments. She helped me prepare the fly food, which smelled awful, and tolerated the fact that to anesthetize the flies I used ether, which smelled worse. This project also won a prize, and earned me a trip to the Illinois State Science Fair, in Champaign-Urbana.\"\n\nDr. Horvitz is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the U.S. Institute of Medicine and is a recipient of numerous awards in addition to the Nobel Prize.\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttp://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2002/horvitz-autobio.html\n\nReturn to Top\n\nDr. Leon Max Lederman, Ph.D.\n\nDirector Emeritus of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab)\n\nFounder of the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy\n\nNational Medal of Science in 1965\n\nWolf Prize for Physics in 1982\n\nNobel Prize in Physics in 1988\n\nLeon Max Lederman, the internationally renowned high-energy physicist, is one of the founding fathers of the Illinois Mathematics andScience Academy (IMSA) for high school students.

The AJAS activities have become an integral component of the big annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).\"\n\n\"I have participated in the AJAS Breakfast with Scientists and met with students at their research poster sessions for many years, before and since my three years as president-elect, president, and board chair of the AAAS during 2004-2007.\"\n\n\"I have introduced the group at Plenary Lectures of the AAAS meetings, and encouraged others to do the same. And I greatly enjoy the chats with individual students.\"\n\n\"Our country needs a growing number of diverse and ambitious young scientists, engineers, and physician-scientists. We also need much greater science literacy among the rest of the population in all the roles in which people depend upon or utilize science and engineering. AAAS encourages members to get involved locally and statewide all across the country, which makes AJAS a key partner. Such activities are a great way to help our university students get involved with K-12 science.\"\n\nGil Omenn‘s research interests include cancer proteomics, chemoprevention of cancers, public health genetics, computational biology, science-based risk analysis, and health policy.\n\nHe was principal investigator of the beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) of preventive agents against lung cancer and heart disease; director of the Center for Health Promotion in Older Adults; creator of a university-wide initiative on Public Health Genetics in Ethical, Legal, and Policy Context; and a Howard Hughes Investigator while at the University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle from 1969 to 1997.\n\nHe served as Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs at the University of Michigan and Chief Executive Officer of the UM Health System from 1997 to 2002.

Raven, Ph.D., Botanist\n\nPresident Emeritus, Missouri Botanical Garden\n\nGeorge Engelmann Professor of Botany Emeritus, Washington University in St. Louis\n\nNational Medal of Science, 2001\n\nThe encouragement of students to become scientists and engineers is one of the most important functions of our community. By given them the opportunity to attend AAAS meetings and mix with professionals, AJAS goes a long way toward encouraging them to take this direction in their lives. Also, the chance to mix with other students with common interests can be a powerful stimulus to taking up a meaningful scientific career. I have greatly enjoyed the AJAS breakfasts that I have been able to join at the meetings, and to have the chance to exchange views with the bright young students who attend.\n\nI have served as an AJAS Board member in the past and will be pleased to continue helping to look for sponsors to enable students to travel to the annual meeting. I am extremely enthusiastic about the potential of the organization to inspire and assist in the development of young scientists. The association of students and their teachers in promoting, teaching, and implementing real research programs would certainly be encouraged by these activities, which definitely deserve the investment of time, resources, and money.\n\nPeter Raven, a leading botanist and advocate of conservation and biodiversity with a notably international outlook, is president emeritus of the Missouri Botanical Garden and George Engelmann Professor of Botany Emeritus at Washington University in St. Louis.

She was fortunate to carry out research at the Worcester Biological Foundation and Clark University while she was still in high school. She did her undergraduate studies in Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania and graduated with honors in 1968. She did her graduate studies in Organic Chemistry at UC Berkeley where she received her Ph. D. in 1971, and was a Postdoctoral researcher at UCLA. Dr. Stubbe moved to Williams College in 1972 as an assistant professor in the Chemistry Department. After a leave of absence from Williams to conduct research at Brandeis University, she joined the faculty in the Pharmacology Department at Yale University. In 1980 she moved to the Biochemistry Department at the University of Wisconsin in Madison where she received tenure in 1985. In 1987 Dr. Stubbe became the first female tenure professor in the MIT Chemistry Department and is currently the Novartis Professor of Chemistry and Biology. She received the National Medal of Science in 2009 for her ground-breaking research in biochemistry and enzyme mechanism.\n\nJoAnne Stubbe's research has helped scientists understand the ways in which enzymes catalyze chemical reactions with rate accelerations of 1017 (faster than a speeding bullet) over non-enzyme catalyzed reactions. Her major research efforts have focused on radical based reactions using the mechanism of nucleotide reductases, the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the building blocks required for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) biosynthesis, the molecule of heredity, as a paradigm. Her work has led to the design and synthesis of nucleotide analogs--structural derivatives of nucleotides--that are used clinically in the treatment of a number of cancers.\n\nWebsites:\n\nLearn more about Dr. Stubbe‘s background and career path.\n\nLearn more about Dr. Stubbe‘s research.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nDr. Jamie L. Vernon, Ph.D\n\nExecutive Director and CEO,\n\nSigma Xi, The Scientific Research Honor Society\n\nPublisher, American Scientist\n\nThe American Junior Academy of Science Conference has proven year after year that science is much more than learning facts from a textbook. The students who participate in the AJAS Annual Conference are given the opportunity to showcase their research, to meet leading scientists from different fields, and to interact with students from around the country who share their enthusiasm for science. These experiences cultivate a deeper relationship with science and establish an indelible appreciation for the scientific process.\n\nMy involvement with AJAS extends across a broad range of interactions—from attending the AJAS Breakfast with Scientists to attending the poster presentations and moderating the oral presentations. I‘ve also had the pleasure of publishing research papers in Sigma Xi‘s pre-collegiate journal, Chronicle of The New Researcher, written by outstanding AJAS students. The leadership and volunteers who organize the AJAS events demonstrate an unparalleled commitment to these students and it shows in the breadth of opportunities that are created for them.\n\nScience, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) are the driving forces behind the U.S. economy. The benefits of STEM are clearly reflected in our businesses, healthcare, and national security. In order for the U.S. to continue to lead on the global stage, we must invest time, resources, and money in teaching our students about the scientific process and how effective application of it can prepare them to realize their dreams. Once students truly grasp the potential of science, they are empowered to change their own lives and the world.\n\nJamie Vernon is a North Carolina native, who currently lives in the state capital city of Raleigh, North Carolina. Born in Concord, he has mostly resided in the rural eastern part of the state, including Rocky Mount and Wilmington, where he graduated from John T. Hoggard High School. He holds a B.S. in zoology from North Carolina State University, an M.S. in molecular biology and biotechnology from East Carolina University, and a Ph.D. in cell and molecular biology from The University of Texas at Austin.\n\nCurrently, he is the executive director and CEO at Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Honor Society, based in Research Triangle Park, and publisher of the Society‘s award-winning magazine, American Scientist. Vernon was director of science communications and publications at Sigma Xi and editor-in-chief of American Scientist magazine from 2014 to 2017. He has also served as the Society‘s interim co-director of operations.\n\nHis scientific research career extended for more than a decade, during which he studied the expression of transcription factors involved in determining the animal body plan at East Carolina University with Dr. Jean-Luc Scemama, he endeavored to develop a gene therapy technology, similar to the CRISP-Cas9 system, at UT Austin with Dr. Alan Lambowitz, and he studied the immunological responses to HIV vaccines and the viral neutralizing capacity of engineered antibodies at the National Cancer Institute with Dr. Marjorie Robert-Guroff. More recently, he transitioned into science policy and communications by serving as an AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow and Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education Fellow at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), where he worked in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). His primary goal at DOE was to improve the measurement and communication of the economic impacts of the Department‘s $2.7 billion annual investment in clean and efficient energy technologies. To this end, he helped implement an EERE-wide evaluation system to measure and communicate evidence-based impact metrics. Also at DOE, he led an initiative to improve consumer energy data access services nationwide and helped launch the DOE National Clean Energy Business Plan Competition. In 2012, he worked with the U.S. Global Change Research Program in collaboration with the White House Office of Science & Technology Policy to improve the communication of federally-funded climate science to policymakers and the public.\n\nHe is a communicator, an organizational leader, and an entrepreneur. His first experience building a new organization occurred in the late 1990‘s when he helped establish the East Carolina Student Rural Health Coalition, an organization that delivered no-cost healthcare to North Carolina‘s rural population. He went on to launch student and professional organizations that address critical public needs at the University of Texas at Austin and in Washington, DC, including co-founding Potential Energy DC, an energy technology startup accelerator, in 2014. Along the way he has come to appreciate the important role that communication research and technology play in advancing organizational goals and he continues to integrate these lessons into his work.\n\nHe is currently focused on using digital technologies and programs to increase the reach and impact of American Scientist magazine and Sigma Xi‘s high school research journal, Chronicle of the New Researcher, and to enhance the member experience and the influence of Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Honor Society worldwide.\n\nWebpage: Jamie L. Vernon, Ph.D.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nStephen Wolfram, Ph.D.\n\nWolfram Research\n\nFounder, CEO, and Chief Technologist\n\nStephen Wolfram works on building science, technology, and businesses based on computation. Born in England in 1959, Stephen started doing research in physics at an early age, publishing his first paper at 15 and receiving his PhD from Caltech at 20. He started using computers as a tool in 1973, and in 1979, built the first commercial system for symbolic mathematical computation.\n\nWolfram received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1981, and soon thereafter began a large-scale basic science project to explore the computational universe of simple programs and their implications for understanding the complexity of nature. His early results on programs known as cellular automata have had wide applications across science, technology, and the arts. In 1986, seeking better tools for his own research, Wolfram began the construction of the Mathematica software system and formed his company, Wolfram Research. First released in 1988, Mathematica has been responsible for many inventions and discoveries over the past quarter century, and is used in essentially every university and major R&D organization around the world.\n\nWolfram founded Wolfram Research in 1987 and has been its CEO and chief technologist ever since. From 1991 to 2002, Wolfram returned to the study of the computational universe, and made a series of discoveries about the computational universe as well as physics, biology, and mathematics, which he summarized in his magnum opus A New Kind of Science, published in 2002. Building on ideas from A New Kind of Science, Wolfram then embarked on an ambitious project to make the world‘s systematic knowledge computable. The result, first launched in 2009, is the Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine, which is used by millions of people every day and serves as the basis for intelligent assistants such as Siri.\n\nWolfram has been progressively building a stack of technology for nearly three decades, which in 2014 led to the launch of the Wolfram Language—a unique knowledge-based computer language in which as much knowledge as possible about computation and about the world is built in. The Wolfram Language has many implications for software and app development, as well as for data science and other applications of computation. It is also the basis for a major new educational initiative aimed at teaching computational thinking.\n\nWolfram‘s company Wolfram Research currently has a staff of about 700, mostly involved with research and development. Wolfram currently spends the majority of his time architecting technology and understanding its implications. He is interested in a wide range of areas where computational thinking is relevant. He lives in Concord, Massachusetts, and has four children.\n\nReturn to Top"
