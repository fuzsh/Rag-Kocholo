        "text": "To identify novel, functionally important HIF effectors, we analyzed the modulation of C. elegans egg laying, the behavior that led our laboratory to discover the first EGLN gene, egl-9, and the first known functional role for any member of the EGLN/HIF pathway (Trent et al., 1983). egl-9(lf) mutants, in which HIF-1 is constitutively active, are defective in egg laying and become bloated with eggs as adults. Although the egg-laying defect of egl-9(lf) mutants is well-established, the downstream effectors of EGL-9 and HIF-1 in regulating egg-laying behavior remain unknown.\n\nWe performed a mutagenesis screen to identify genes that act in response to egl-9 to control egg laying. Specifically, we screened for second-site mutations that suppressed the egg-laying defect of egl-9(lf) animals (Figure 1A). Such suppressors could define genes that function downstream of egl-9. Two isolates from this screen were allelic to hif-1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B), consistent with a previous observation that hif-1(lf) suppresses the egl-9(lf) egg-laying defect (Bishop et al., 2004) and validating the screen as a means of identifying components of the HIF-1 pathway. A third isolate, n5666, was not allelic to hif-1 and had a G106R missense mutation in the gene cyp-36A1, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and C). A transgene carrying a wild-type copy of cyp-36A1 fully rescued the suppression by n5666 of the egl-9(lf) egg-laying defect, demonstrating that the mutation in cyp-36A1 is the causative mutation and suggesting that the suppression phenotype is caused by reduction of cyp-36A1 function (Figure 1B–1E). Confirming these conclusions, a nonsense allele of cyp-36A1 also suppressed the egl-9(lf) egg-laying defect (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C). cyp-36A1(lf) single mutants did not exhibit hyperactive egg-laying behavior (Figure 1F and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and D), indicating that suppression of the egl-9(lf) egg-laying defect by cyp-36A1(lf) is not a consequence of a nonspecific increase in egg-laying rate. We further showed that cyp-36A1(lf) suppressed the previously reported egg-laying defect of hypoxia-exposed worms (Miller and Roth, 2009), demonstrating a role for CYP-36A1 under physiological conditions of HIF-1 activation (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We then analyzed the role of cyp-36A1 in regulating other behaviors. We observed that egl-9(lf) mutants have reduced locomotion and defecation rates, both of which were suppressed by hif-1(lf) (Figure 1G and H). cyp-36A1(lf) partially suppressed the slow locomotion and defecation rates of egl-9(lf) mutants, showing that CYP-36A1 modulates not only egg laying but also multiple other HIF-1-regulated behaviors.\n\nNext we observed that cyp-36A1 expression is increased in egl-9(lf) mutants in a hif-1-dependent manner (Figure 1I), consistent with results from an earlier genome-wide microarray study that identified cyp-36A1 as one of 63 genes regulated by hif-1 in hypoxia-exposed worms (Shen et al., 2005). ChIP-seq of HIF-1 by the modERN project showed HIF-1 binding at two sites near the cyp-36A1 coding region, one 5’ to the start of the gene and one in the first intron (Kudron et al., 2018); both of these sites contain the HIF binding motif 5’RCGTG (Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008). We conclude that cyp-36A1 is a downstream effector of the hypoxia-response pathway that regulates multiple behaviors and that cyp-36A1 likely is a direct transcriptional target of HIF-1.\n\nWe sought to determine if CYP-36A1 regulates other HIF-1-dependent processes. Based on sequence identity, CYP-36A1 is most closely related to the CYP2 family of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which function in both detoxification of xenobiotics and metabolism of endogenous molecules (Nebert et al., 2013). CYP2 family members and other CYPs can act on endogenous substrates to generate diffusible signaling molecules that regulate gene expression, such as eicosanoids and steroid hormones (Rendic and Guengerich, 2015; Dennis and Norris, 2015; Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014). We hypothesized that CYP-36A1 might function in a transcriptional cascade to mediate aspects of HIF-1-dependent gene regulation. We performed an RNA-seq experiment comparing the wild type, egl-9(lf) mutants, egl-9(lf) hif-1(lf) double mutants, and cyp-36A1(lf); egl-9(lf) double mutants. We found that hif-1(lf) suppressed egl-9-dependent gene expression for 93% of egl-9(lf)-downregulated genes and 87% of egl-9(lf)-upregulated genes, indicating that most but not all regulation of transcription by egl-9 occurs through hif-1, consistent with previous work (Angeles-Albores et al., 2018). We further found that 36% of HIF-1-upregulated genes (i.e. genes that are upregulated in egl-9(lf) mutants and suppressed by hif-1(lf)) and 10% of HIF-1-downregulated genes were also regulated by cyp-36A1 (Figure 2A and B and Supplementary files 1 and 2). We focused on the HIF-1-upregulated genes, for which CYP-36A1 function appeared to be more broadly required. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these HIF-1/CYP-36A1-upregulated genes suggested a role for cyp-36A1 in regulating stress resistance downstream of egl-9 and hif-1 (Figure 2—source data 1). The EGL-9/HIF-1 pathway has previously been implicated in responses to numerous stressors in both nematodes and mammals, with crosstalk occurring between HIF and regulators of the immune response, unfolded protein response, and other stress-response pathways (Palazon et al., 2014; Schito and Rey, 2018; Wouters and Koritzinsky, 2008; Nakazawa et al., 2016; Powell-Coffman, 2010). We tested whether CYP-36A1 is involved in the response to three stressors for which HIF-1 is known to mediate resistance in C. elegans: infection by the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Darby et al., 1999; Bellier et al., 2009; Shao et al., 2010; Budde and Roth, 2011; Kirienko et al., 2013), tunicamycin-induced ER stress (Leiser et al., 2015), and oxidative stress from tert-butyl hydroperoxide (Bellier et al., 2009). Animals in which HIF-1 is constitutively active because of mutation in egl-9 or the C. elegans VHL homolog vhl-1 are resistant to these stressors relative to wild-type animals: such mutants survive longer when grown on Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14 (Bellier et al., 2009), display reduced tunicamycin-induced growth inhibition (Leiser et al., 2015), and survive exposure to tert-butyl hydroperoxide at a higher rate than the wild type (Bellier et al., 2009). We found that cyp-36A1(lf); egl-9(lf) double mutants are more sensitive than egl-9(lf) mutants to all three of these stressors (Figure 2C–2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1), suggesting that CYP-36A1 mediates responses to these stressors downstream of HIF-1. Together the CYP-36A1-dependent changes in gene expression and stress resistance indicate that CYP-36A1 plays a major role in regulating HIF-1-mediated physiology.\n\nWe next sought to identify the site of action of CYP-36A1. We hypothesized that CYP-36A1 might function cell non-autonomously, as is the case for other cytochrome P450 enzymes that generate signaling molecules (Nebert et al., 2013; Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014; Gerisch and Antebi, 2004). We observed cyp-36A1 expression in many tissues, including neurons, intestine, hypoderm, and muscle (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). To test the hypothesis of cell non-autonomous CYP-36A1 function, we focused on a cyp-36A1-mediated abnormality of egl-9(lf) mutants for which the site of dysfunction is well defined. Specifically, we examined expression of a GFP transcriptional reporter for the gene T24B8.5 (Shivers et al., 2009), which is expressed in only the intestine and based on our RNA-seq data is upregulated in egl-9(lf) mutants in a cyp-36A1-dependent manner. Interestingly, T24B8.5 expression is also upregulated in response to infection, ER stress, and oxidative stress (Shivers et al., 2009; Lim et al., 2014; Park et al., 2009). Expression of the reporter recapitulated the T24B8.5 expression changes observed by RNA-seq: increased expression of GFP was observed in egl-9(lf) mutants, which was suppressed by a second mutation in either hif-1 or cyp-36A1 (Figure 3A and C and Figure 3—figure supplement 3). To determine the site of action of cyp-36A1 for regulation of intestinal T24B8.5 expression, we expressed wild-type cyp-36A1 cDNA using tissue-specific promoters. We found that the low PT24B8.5::gfp expression of cyp-36A1(lf); egl-9(lf) double mutants was rescued by expressing cyp-36A1(+) either cell autonomously in the intestine or cell non-autonomously in neurons, hypoderm or body-wall muscle (Figure 3B and C and Figure 3—figure supplement 3). cyp-36A1(+) expression in all four tissues also rescued the suppression of the egg-laying defect of cyp-36A1(lf); egl-9(lf) mutants (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Next we found that expressing a nondegradable constitutively active HIF-1 mutant protein (P621A) (Pocock and Hobert, 2008) in any of the same four tissues also promoted intestinal expression of the GFP reporter and that this HIF-1-mediated increase in expression required cyp-36A1 (Figure 3D and E and Figure 3—figure supplement 4). Thus, CYP-36A1 can function cell non-autonomously to regulate gene expression downstream of HIF-1, consistent with the hypothesis that CYP-36A1 acts by generating a diffusible signal.\n\nWe performed a mutagenesis screen to identify CYP-36A1 effectors that regulate egg-laying behavior, stress responses, and gene expression. We screened for mutations that suppressed both the low PT24B8.5::gfp expression and normal egg laying of cyp-36A1(lf); egl-9(lf) double mutants, looking for triple mutants that, like egl-9(lf) single mutants, had high GFP expression and were egg-laying defective. By screening for suppressors of the two abnormalities simultaneously, we were able to focus on effectors of CYP-36A1 rather than finding genes that affect only egg laying or only expression of T24B8.5 independently of the EGL-9/HIF-1/CYP-36A1 pathway. From this screen we identified one nonsense and one missense allele of the nuclear receptor gene nhr-46 (Figure 4A–4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1), both of which caused an egg-laying defect and high expression of the PT24B8.5::gfp reporter. We tested whether nhr-46 also functions in regulating stress responses downstream of cyp-36A1 and found that cyp-36A1(lf); nhr-46(lf); egl-9(lf) triple mutants were more resistant to Pseudomonas infection, ER stress, and oxidative stress than cyp-36A1(lf); egl-9(lf) double mutants (Figure 4E–4G and Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Thus, NHR-46 is a downstream effector of CYP-36A1 in regulation of stress resistance as well as of behavior and gene expression. Interestingly, nhr-46(lf) single mutants displayed wild-type egg laying (Figure 4D), tunicamycin resistance (Figure 4F), and oxidative stress resistance (Figure 4G), and nearly wild-type survival on Pseudomonas (Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 2), indicating that in addition to nhr-46 at least one other pathway is required to transduce egl-9-mediated modulation of egg laying and stress resistance. For example, in egl-9(lf) mutants or hypoxia, HIF-1 might drive expression of two (or more) targets that act together to inhibit egg laying and promote stress resistance. Thus, cyp-36A1 activation and consequent nhr-46 inhibition would promote egg-laying inhibition and stress resistance in egl-9(lf) mutant animals – in which this second pathway was also activated – but not in nhr-46(lf) single mutants – in which this second pathway was not activated. nhr-46(lf) single mutants had increased expression of the PT24B8.5::gfp reporter (Figure 4B and C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1), suggesting that at least some gene expression changes can be mediated by nhr-46 alone.\n\nnhr-46 is expressed in many tissues, including neurons, hypoderm, muscle, intestine, and the spermatheca (Feng et al., 2012). Tissue-specific expression of nhr-46 in the intestine, but not in neurons or muscle, rescued the high GFP expression caused by nhr-46(lf), indicating that nhr-46 acts cell autonomously in the intestine to control intestinal expression of T24B8.5 (Figure 5A and B and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). nhr-46 expression in neurons fully rescued the egg-laying defect of cyp-36A1(lf); nhr-46(lf); egl-9(lf) triple mutants (Figure 5C), demonstrating that nhr-46 function in neurons is sufficient to regulate egg-laying behavior. nhr-46 expression in intestine, but not muscle, also partially rescued the egg-laying defect of cyp-36A1(lf); nhr-46(lf); egl-9(lf) triple mutants (Figure 5C). In combination with the tissue-specific CYP-36A1 and HIF-1 experiments described above, these results suggest that a CYP-36A1-regulated cell non-autonomous signal from any tissue can act on NHR-46 in the intestine to drive intestinal T24B8.5 expression and in either the nervous system or the intestine to regulate egg-laying behavior. That nhr-46 can act in either of two different tissues to regulate egg laying suggests that a second intercellular signal, for example a peptide or other hormone, might regulate egg laying downstream of NHR-46.\n\nNumerous studies have reported that HIF-1 promotes longevity and stress resistance of C. elegans (Darby et al., 1999; Treinin et al., 2003; Bellier et al., 2009; Mehta et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2010; Shao et al., 2010; Budde and Roth, 2011; Kirienko et al., 2013; Fawcett et al., 2015). Nonetheless, despite substantial interest in the role of this pathway in stress biology, few relevant HIF effectors have been identified. Interestingly, a recent study reported that HIF-dependent serotonin signaling from the nervous system cell non-autonomously drives expression of the xenobiotic detoxification enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase-2 (FMO-2) in the intestine, resulting in increased stress resistance and consequent extension of lifespan (Leiser et al., 2015). Here we report that a different signal, likely a lipophilic hormone, acts cell non-autonomously downstream of HIF to regulate gene expression and stress resistance. Consistent with the findings of Leiser et al. (2015), our RNA-seq data showed that in egl-9(lf) mutants there is a strong induction of fmo-2 expression and that this induction is suppressed by hif-1 mutation (Supplementary file 2), that is HIF-1 upregulates fmo-2 expression. Notably, this HIF-dependent expression of fmo-2 does not require cyp-36A1: the high fmo-2 expression of egl-9(lf) mutants is not suppressed by cyp-36A1(lf). We therefore suggest that serotonin-mediated fmo-2 expression and cyp-36A1/nhr-46-mediated gene expression are parallel pathways downstream of HIF that regulate stress resistance.\n\nWe previously identified another cytochrome P450 gene, cyp-13A12, as acting downstream of egl-9 in a locomotory behavior (Ma et al., 2013). In contrast to CYP-36A1, which is upregulated by HIF-1, CYP-13A12 is downregulated by HIF-1 upon hypoxia exposure or in egl-9(lf) mutants. The downstream effectors of CYP-36A1 and CYP-13A12 are also distinct, as we show here that CYP-36A1 regulates a nuclear receptor that controls transcription, whereas CYP-13A12 generates eicosanoids that act on a seconds-to-minutes timescale unlikely to require gene expression changes. Thus, different cytochrome P450 enzymes can act broadly, through multiple mechanisms, downstream of the EGL-9/HIF-1 hypoxia-response pathway in C. elegans. We propose that cytochrome P450 enzymes might similarly be important HIF effectors in mammals. Polymorphisms in numerous human cytochrome P450 genes have been associated with cardiovascular disease (Elbekai and El-Kadi, 2006; Rowland and Mangoni, 2014), for which HIF plays a protective role (Semenza, 2012), and with cancers (Agundez, 2004), for which HIF contributes to pathogenesis (Semenza, 2012). Furthermore, a study of genetic adaptations in humans to the environmentally hypoxic Tibetan plateau identified well-established members of the HIF pathway and, intriguingly, also noted positive selection at two cytochrome P450 loci (Simonson et al., 2010). Together these observations suggest that the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes is important in a wide range of hypoxia-associated contexts in humans. We suggest the presence of a mechanistic link between the canonical HIF pathway and the function of cytochrome P450 enzymes in humans and posit that an understanding of how these highly druggable enzymes (Schuster and Bernhardt, 2007) control processes downstream of HIF might reveal new therapeutic avenues for treating a broad array of disorders.\n\nCytochrome P450 enzymes require oxygen as a substrate and thus might be regulated by oxygen availability. A long-standing issue in the understanding of HIF function is ‘range finding,’ that is how activity of the EGLN/HIF pathway is modulated such that it responds to different oxygen set points depending on context to drive a diversity of biological outputs (Ratcliffe, 2013). We hypothesize that the oxygen sensitivity of HIF-regulated cytochrome P450 enzymes might enable them to function in such a range finding mechanism to narrow the range of oxygen concentrations at which a subset of HIF-regulated physiological changes are activated.\n\nThe Pcyp-36A1::gfp::unc-54 3’UTR construct (transgene nIs682) was generated by using PCR fusion (Hobert, 2002) to fuse a PCR product containing the cyp-36A1 promoter fragment (4.4 kb of upstream sequence) to a PCR product containing gfp::unc-54 3’UTR. The cyp-36A1 rescuing construct (transgene nIs674) was generated by amplifying a PCR product from gDNA containing 4.4 kb upstream, the cyp-36A1 locus, and 1.6 kb downstream. The nhr-46 rescuing construct (transgene nEx2586) was generated by amplifying a PCR product from gDNA containing 1.9 kb upstream, the nhr-46 locus, and 0.9 kb downstream. All remaining constructs were generated using the Infusion cloning technique (Clontech). The promoter fragments used for dpy-7 (hypoderm) (Gilleard et al., 1997), vha-6 (intestine) (Allman et al., 2009) rab-3 (neurons) (Mahoney et al., 2006) and unc-54 (muscle) (D. Ma, personal communication) contain 1.3, 0.9, 1.4, and 1.9 kb, respectively, of sequence upstream of the start codons of each of these genes. Expression of tissue-specific rescuing transgenes was confirmed using mCherry tagging. We noticed expression in some unidentified cells outside the body-wall muscle near the junction of the pharynx and intestine in the strain cyp-36A1(gk824636); agIs9; egl-9(sa307); nEx2859 [Punc-54::cyp-36A1 cDNA::F2A::mCherry::tbb-2 3'UTR, Pttx-3::mCherry::tbb-2 3’UTR]; such expression might contribute to rescue of the mutant phenotype in that strain. C45E5.6b was used for nhr-46 cDNA. F38A6.3a with a P621A stabilizing mutation was used for hif-1 cDNA (Pocock and Hobert, 2008). Where present, the F2A sequence served as a ribosomal skip sequence to cause separation of the two peptides encoded before and after the F2A (Ahier and Jarriault, 2014). Transgenic strains were generated by germline transformation as described (Mello et al., 1991). All transgenic constructs were injected at 2.5–50 ng/μl.\n\nTo screen for suppressors of the egl-9 egg-laying defect, we mutagenized egl-9(n586) mutants with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) as described previously (Brenner, 1974). The starting strain contained the Pcysl-2::gfp (nIs470) transgene, which is highly expressed in egl-9(lf) mutants and served as a reporter for HIF-1 activity (Ma et al., 2012). We used a dissecting microscope to screen the F2 progeny for suppression of the egg-laying defect (i.e. the Egl phenotype), picking (1) adults that appeared less Egl than egl-9(n586) mutants, and (2) eggs laid by the F2 animals that were at an earlier developmental stage than those laid by egl-9(n586) mutants. Screen isolates were backcrossed to determine dominant vs. recessive and single-gene inheritance pattern and crossed to him-8(e1489); egl-9(sa307) hif-1(ia4) to test complementation with hif-1(lf). The screen allele n5666, which conferred a recessive phenotype and was not allelic to hif-1, mapped between SNPs pkP1052 and rs3139013 on LGI with SNP mapping (Davis et al., 2005) using a strain containing egl-9(n586) introgressed into the Hawaiian strain CB4856 (Ma et al., 2013). Whole-genome sequencing identified a mutation in cyp-36A1 in the n5666 interval, and transgenic rescue demonstrated that this cyp-36A1 mutation is the causative mutation, as described in the text.\n\nReads were aligned against the C. elegans ce10 genome assembly using bwa 0.7.5a (Li and Durbin, 2009) and samtools/0.1.19 (1000 Genome Project Data Processing Subgroup et al., 2009) (bwa aln/bwa samse), and mapping rates, fraction of multiply-mapping reads, number of unique 20-mers at the 5’ end of the reads, insert size distributions and fraction of ribosomal RNAs were calculated using dedicated perl scripts and bedtools v. 2.17.0 (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). For expression analysis, reads were aligned against the C. elegans ce10 genome/ENSEMBL 65 annotation using RSEM 1.2.15 (Li and Dewey, 2011) and bowtie 1.0.1 (Langmead et al., 2009), with the following parameters: -p 6 --bowtie-chunkmbs 1024 --output-genome-bam. Raw expected read counts were retrieved and used for differential expression analysis with Bioconductor’s edgeR package in the R 3.2.3 statistical environment (Robinson et al., 2010). First, common, trended, and gene-specific read dispersion across sequencing libraries and genes was estimated using the estimateDisp function. Given the small number of replicates, a gene-wise negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM) with quasi-likelihood tests (as implemented in the glmQLFit function) was used to test for differential expression between conditions (Lun et al., 2016). Briefly, this statistical framework works by first fitting the observed and expected distributions of read counts for each gene across conditions using a GLM, which is based on the negative binomial distribution and the observed read dispersion. The significance of biases in read counts is then tested using the quasi-likelihood F-test (implemented in glmQLFTest). This test provides more robust and reliable error rate control at low number of replicates, because it reflects the uncertainty in read distribution better than the likelihood ratio test. Models were fitted across all conditions and relevant differential expression testing was performed using glmQLFTest between pairs of conditions of interest. P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed using GOrilla (Eden et al., 2009), examining genes that were significantly downregulated in cyp-36A1(lf); egl-9(lf) double mutants vs. egl-9(lf) single mutants (i.e. orange circle in Figure 2B) as compared to genes that were at least twofold upregulated in egl-9(lf) mutants vs. wild type (adjusted p value<0.05) and significantly downregulated in egl-9(lf) hif-1(lf) vs. egl-9(lf) (adjusted p value<0.05) (i.e. purple circle in Figure 2B)."
