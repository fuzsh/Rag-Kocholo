        "text": "Top 10 universities in the US for life science degrees 2024\n\nScroll down for the full list of best universities in the US for life science degrees\n\nThe life sciences cover a wide range of subjects including biology, zoology, agriculture and many others.\n\nDue the multiple skills that students learn on a life sciences degree, graduates will be able to use their degree to enter a range of industries and jobs.\n\nIf you’re interested in a life sciences degree that offers flexibility and breadth, the US could be a good fit. You can choose to study across a range of courses in the life sciences and then home in on your interests in the third and fourth years.\n\nMost veterinary medicine courses in the US are offered at the postgraduate level, and you will be expected to have completed an undergraduate degree already.\n\nFamous US scientists include biologist Lynn Margulis, who transformed our understanding of evolution through her work on symbiosis, and Barbara McClintock, who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1983 for her discovery of genetic transposition.\n\nThese are the best universities in the US for a life sciences degree.\n\nBest universities in the world for life sciences degrees\n\nBest universities for life science degrees in Australia\n\nBest universities for life sciences degrees in Canada\n\nBest universities for life sciences degrees in the UK\n\n5. Princeton University\n\nPrinceton University follows a liberal arts curriculum, with students opting to study either a bachelor of arts or a bachelor of science. Students can choose to study across a range of these subjects and declare their major in their first or second year.\n\nUndergraduate programmes within the life sciences discipline available at Princeton include molecular biology, ecology and evolutionary biology and environmental studies.\n\nAt a postgraduate level students can choose to undertake research in a range of subjects including molecular biology and cellular biochemistry.\n\nPrinceton University is also one of the world’s foremost research universities with connections to more than 40 Nobel laureates, 17 winners of the National Medal of Science and five recipients of the National Humanities Medal.\n\n4. Yale University\n\nYale University was founded in 1701 and is the third oldest university in the United States.\n\nYale University in Connecticut is a member of the prestigiously known Ivy League\n\nStudents have the option to study a range of courses covering liberal arts and science. Once you have completed your first year, you can then declare your major for your second year. This provides students with the ability to try an array of subjects before they find the perfect fit.\n\nPostgraduate students have the ability to join the school of the environment or the graduate school of arts and science.\n\n3. Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nFounded in 1861, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is an independent, co-educational, private research university based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nAmong its 89 Nobel winners is current MIT professor H. Robert Horvitz, known for his research analysing the role of genes in animal development, and how this could be useful in tackling human disease.\n\nAt MIT you can choose between eight interdisciplinary undergraduate life science programmes, including chemistry and biology, molecular biology, and humanities and science. Within these programmes you can take an array of classes in the life sciences, covering everything from human physiology to experimental biology and biostatistics.\n\nThere are also many options for a minor, and a range of graduate programmes specialising in the life sciences.\n\nScientific discoveries and technological advances accredited to MIT also include the first chemical synthesis of penicillin and the development of radar.\n\nWhat can you do with an agriculture degree?\n\nWhat can you do with a biology degree?\n\nWhat can you do with a sports science degree?\n\nWhat can you do with a veterinary science degree?\n\n2. Stanford University\n\nLocated in the heart of Silicon Valley, Stanford University was founded in 1885, and has one of the largest college campuses in the US, with 18 interdisciplinary research institutes and seven schools on a single site.\n\nStanford’s curriculum offers considerable flexibility through its liberal arts approach.\n\nAll undergraduate students are required to take classes in writing, ways of thinking and a foreign language, alongside a major or joint major.\n\nWithin this structure, you can take courses across a range of life sciences disciplines, including kinesiology, marine biology, human biology, physiology, ecology and many more. Undergraduate students pursuing a biology major are encouraged to undertake research, either by working in a research lab on campus or taking part in the Biology Summer Undergraduate Research Programme.\n\nThe coterminal master’s programme is designed for undergraduates who want to participate in graduate-level programmes and refine their research skills.\n\nStanford University is also home to many leading research institutes in the life sciences, including Bio-X, a pioneering interdisciplinary biosciences research centre, the Baxter Laboratory in Stem Cell Biology, and the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.\n\n1. Harvard University\n\nFounded in 1636, Harvard University is the oldest university in the US and a member of the prestigious Ivy League.\n\nAt undergraduate level, the university offers a four-year liberal arts and sciences programme. You can study a range of courses and only need to declare your major or concentration in your second year.\n\nConcentrations in the life sciences include biomedical engineering, human developmental and regenerative biology, human evolutionary biology, integrative biology and molecular and cellular biology among others.\n\nThe university also offers a master of science in a number of areas, including biostatistics, immunology and biophysics. The Harvard Integrated Life Sciences programme covers 14 different PhD programmes, which offers students the flexibility to conduct research in the areas they are most interested in.\n\nHarvard University has one of the largest endowments of any university in the world and is well known for its generous financial aid programme.\n\nTop universities in the US for the life sciences 2024"
