After graduating from Columbia University in 1917, he got a job at Philip Goodman Advertising Agency as a director of advertising. His primary role was to design a trademark for Goldwyn Pictures. He used Colombia’s lion known as Mascot as a basis to create the Goldwyn studio’s roaring lion trademark. This masterpiece was used by Goldwyn Studios at the beginning of their every film.

In 1924, Goldwyn joined two studios and became Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) corporations. He also came up with a Latin motto which would accompany the lion titled ‘Ars Gratias Artis’ (‘Art for Art’s Sake). He was appointed as the MGM Vice President in 1942 and retained the position until 1957 when he retired.
