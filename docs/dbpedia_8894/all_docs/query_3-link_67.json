        "text": "We have the latest Days of Our Lives spoilers from Monday, July 1, to Friday, July 12. A desperate offer is made, one man has a difficult request, and a secret summer plan is revealed — plus, Nicole can’t believe what she learns about Eric. Read on for that and more heartache ahead in Salem…\n\nDays of Our Lives spoilers week of July 1:\n\nIn honor of Canada Day, we bring you photos of soap stars from the ‘Great White North’!\n\nDays of Our Lives spoilers for Monday, July 1:\n\nIn today’s recap, EJ offers Melinda a job to keep her quiet, Tate asks Holly to runaway with him, and Eric gets a job offer.\n\nIt’s been a long time in coming, but at long last, Stefan and Gabi find themselves sharing a blissful reunion.\n\nAva can’t stop feeling guilty, but Kristen — who’s not typically one to feel that particular emotion — tries helping her see it’s futile.\n\nTate’s hoping that if his dad talks to Theresa, perhaps he’ll finally be allowed to openly see Holly.

Also, which show did way, way worse!\n\nDays of Our Lives spoilers for Friday, July 5:\n\nIn today’s recap, Gabi announces Eric is Jude’s father at EJ’s press conference, and Connie recalls stabbing Li!\n\nNicole couldn’t possibly have prepared for what Eric tells her: He’s leaving Salem… immediately!\n\nNow that she’s in charge of DiMera Enterprises, Kristen contemplates putting Melinda in a powerful position!\n\nJada stuns Rafe by filling him in on what Bobby is now claiming. Meanwhile, Everett… or Bobby… or both do their best to prevent Marlena from making progress.\n\nThat was fast! Arianne Zucker is back at work already — and wait till you see her wild new look!\n\nDays of Our Lives spoilers week of July 8:\n\nDays of Our Lives spoilers for Monday, July 8:\n\nAs we get closer and closer to her portrayer’s exit, Nicole finds out a bit of news about her son that is going to blow her away. Meanwhile, EJ makes it clear that he intends to do as much harm as possible to Stefan and Gabi, whom he wants to see punished!\n\nWhen new info comes to light about Li Shin’s murder, will we finally learn who was responsible?\n\nDays of Our Lives spoilers for Tuesday, July 9:\n\nStefan is thrilled to have Gabi back in his life, but that doesn’t mean he’s going to just let everything go. In fact, he wants answers from his lady love!\n\nGet ready, because today’s the day everyone’s been waiting for as Eric finally learns the truth from Nicole.\n\nWhen EJ opens up to make a confession, how will Holly react to what he has to share?\n\nDays of Our Lives spoilers for Wednesday, July 10:\n\nChad is desperate to find answers about Abigail, and he’s come to the conclusion that there’s really only one way to uncover the truth.

But today, an unexpected visitor’s arrival will leave the conflicted young man on the receiving end of the shock!\n\nDays of Our Lives spoilers for Friday, July 12:\n\nPerhaps because he lives in Salem, where all secrets eventually come to light, Stefan frets that what he’s been keeping under his hat will soon be exposed.\n\nRafe suggests that Gabi forget about what’s come before and instead focus on moving forward. But something tells us she’s not likely to listen…\n\nJada draws a line in the sand with Bobby/Everett. But will he/they take her ultimatum to heart?\n\nAnd open our photo gallery below as we pay tribute to beloved soap stars lost in 2024.\n\n— Richard Simms/Amy Mistretta"
