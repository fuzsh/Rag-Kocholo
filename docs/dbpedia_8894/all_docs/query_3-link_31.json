        "text": "KT Sullivan makes her debut at Birdland with her new Cole Porter show “You’re The Top” on April 10th. The title refers to KT’s concept that Cole Porter is at the top of the food chain when it comes to songsmiths, and thus her favorite. Among the musical gems from Cole’s catalog presented in Jim Caruso’s Monday night series will be It’s Delovely, In The Still Of The Night, Don’t Fence Me In, So In Love, I’ve Got You Under My Skin, Physician, Experiment, Down In The Depths On The 90th Floor, and Brush Up Your Shakespeare.\n\nMusical Director: John Weber.\n\nBassist: Steve Doyle.\n\n2 Sopranos / 1 man - and how he changed their lives. Barbara Cook’s career was resurrected through a relationship with Wally Harper, who introduced her to the world of cabaret, opening an amazing second act in what had been a luminous career as an actress and vocalist. A Broadway legend, Ms. Cook found her musical equal in Harper, and he his muse in her.\n\nTHEN in 1980, a chance introduction to Barbara’s album IT’S BETTER WITH A BAND started a starry-eyed Oklahoma native on the way to a career in cabaret. In I CAN COOK, KT Sullivan pays tribute to both Barbara and Wally, and the amazing journey that began when they met.\n\nFeaturing SING A SONG WITH ME and IT’S BETTER WITH A BAND (both written by Harper) and classics arranged by Wally for Barbara such as DANCING IN THE DARK, WAIT TILL YOU SEE HIM, SWEET GEORGIA BROWN, I LOVE A PIANO, COME IN FROM THE RAIN, IF LOVE WERE ALL, and, of course, I CAN COOK.\n\nAs Will Friedwald wrote, “Sullivan is one of few appearing in cabaret rooms who can safely be described as a KILLER soprano”.\n\n​\n\nEric Michael Gillett, Director\n\nJon Weber, Musical Director\n\nAll the songs in “Rhyme, Women and Song” are written in whole or in part by women. Dorothy Fields, Carolyn Leigh, Kay Swift, Betty Comden, Dorothy Parker, Marilyn Bergman and Joni Mitchell are some of them. Accompanying Ms. Sullivan at the Oak Room are two (unrelated) musicians with almost identical names: Jon Weber, on piano, and John Webber, on bass, who give several numbers a solid jazz kick.\n\nThe changes in style and mood from song to song are so quick that at times “Rhyme, Women and Song” suggests a sequence of lightning-fast blackout sketches. But there is a rough through line under it all. Early in the show a medley of “Don’t Let a Good Thing Get Away,” “The Best Is Yet to Come,” “On the Sunny Side of the Street” and “The Other Side of the Tracks” becomes a suite about a woman’s determined upward mobility in which Ms. Sullivan doesn’t disguise the connections between romantic aspiration and material calculation. - Stephen Holden, New York Times\n\n\"Timeless Tunes,\" consists entirely of songs written in 1929 or earlier. Including such standards as \"Let Me Call You Sweetheart\" and \"Shine on Harvest Moon\"; relative obscurities (Cole Porter's hilarious \"Tale of an Oyster,\" cut from his musical \"50 Million Frenchmen,\" and selections from such operettas as \"The Merry Widow\" and \"Die Fledermaus,\" the songs provoke a nostalgic swoon even in those who weren't yet born when they were written. Best of all, Sullivan, accompanied by superb pianist Jon Weber, performed most of the evening without a microphone, which only enhanced the crystalline beauty of her voice. She resorted to miking only once, when she wandered the room singing a wonderful medley of 29 numbers written in 1929. Clearly, that was a golden year for American popular songwriting. - Frank Scheck, New York Post\n\nThe spirit of the show, which also includes the work of collaborators like Leo Robin, Frank Loesser, Dorothy Fields and Vernon Duke, is predominantly lighthearted. The show is a series of quick changes connected by smart, funny patter that doesn’t waste a remark.\n\n​\n\nThe ability to convey a sense of continual surprise and discovery while singing almost any standard is one of Ms. Sullivan’s many gifts. That her light-operatic voice is as supple today as ever is her ace in the hole. A virtuoso at multiple styles of musical comedy who has refined a hundred variations of the double take, Ms. Sullivan can turn on a dime and deliver a formal rendition of “Dancing in the Dark” in which her luscious middle and lower registers supply serious drama. - Stephen Holden, New York Times\n\nJerome Kern, the composer of “All the Things You Are,” “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” and the music from “Show Boat,” is widely regarded as the rock upon which American popular song was built. But being a monument comes with a price. Reverence precludes humor, and statues of founding fathers rarely wear smiles.\n\n​\n\nAs KT Sullivan reveals in her Kern show, “All the Things You Are,” at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, however, there is a lot more to him than stately ballads. The early, half-forgotten Kern of the Princess Theater musicals composed between 1915 and 1920 was a playful scamp, especially in collaborations with P. G. Wodehouse. The hilarious, dirty-minded “Cleopatterer” (from the 1917 show “Leave It to Jane”), which imagines the prolific sex life of Cleopatra, might even be seen as an early-20th-century prototype of rap. And Ms. Sullivan delivered it on Thursday with a tongue-in-cheek sense of merriment. - Stephen Holden, New York Times\n\nThe journey from the sticks to the Broadway stage is a pilgrimage that has been made by countless performers. But no one in recent memory has turned it into the kind of thrill ride that the singer K T Sullivan makes of it in her new cabaret show, “Autumn in New York.”\n\n​\n\nAs she travels in song from her rural hometown, Boggy Depot, Okla., to Manhattan, Ms. Sullivan evokes the mythical distance between polar dream worlds. The naïve show-business hopeful who begins the journey is given voice by two songs from “The Fantasticks”: “Try to Remember,” in which she looks back wistfully, and “Much More,” in which she dreams of going to town “in a golden gown.” The sophisticated urban malcontent her alter ego recognizes but refuses to become is evoked in songs by Stephen Sondheim (“Who’s That Woman?”) and Noël Coward (“World Weary”). It is a persona Ms. Sullivan would rather laugh at than embrace. - Stephen Holden, New York Times\n\nThe golden voice of KT Sullivan evokes memories of stellar screen legends in this superb tribute to the songs and singers made famous on film.\n\n​\n\nThrough songs immortalized by those ladies of the silver screen, including Bette Davis and Doris Day to Carmen Miranda and Marlene Dietrich, you'll be transported back to vintage Hollywood, where you'' discover the truth aboutthe unknown female voices captured on celluloid.\n\n​\n\nKT Sullivan, a voluptuous platinum blonde with a bright-eyed wit, is a fusion of those not- so -dumb screen idols, Marilyn Monroe and Judy Holliday, and has built a thriving cabaret career on her stylised parody of a 1950's glamour girl. KT effortlessly moves from sassy tart to elegant vamp and is a pure delight as she salutes the singers, The Ladies Of The Silver Screen.\n\nThe show is called “Noel, Cole and Bart” and is, quite naturally, a cornucopia of prime, patrician songs by Messrs. Coward, Porter and Howard. These are the kinds of songs Mabel Mercer used to sing – the finely crafted pearls of great wit, intelligence and musical sophistication I used to hear in rooms like L’Intrigue, R.S.V.P. and the Blue Angel. Mabel is gone now and the memory grows dim, but Ms. Sullivan keeps the flame at her altar burning brightly. She’s not old enough in years to remember how privileged New Yorkers were to sit around in exalted clusters at 2 A.M. listening and learning from Mabel about the art of song. But Ms. Sullivan is quite prepared in terms of compassion, enthusiasm and good taste. From Howard’s piercing “Walk-Up” and “It Was Worth It,” a raspberry to growing old that he wrote for Mabel’s 50th birthday, to Noel Coward’s hilarious 1945 obscurity “That Is the End of the News,” you are in for some delicious surprises. - Rex Reed, New York Observer\n\nLife would be a snap if you followed some basic musical comedy advice. Make someone else happy, and you will be happy too. Remember that every day comes once in a lifetime, so make the most of every day; and so on and so forth. Those useful tips are embedded in the song lyrics of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, the dearly beloved team to whom Mark Nadler and KT Sullivan pay affectionate tribute in their effervescent cabaret show “Make Someone Happy.” - Stephen Holden, New York Times\n\nA book musical in which Mark Nadler and KT Sullivan tell, sing and reenact one of the great American love stories They put Irving Berlin's music in service to the story, weaving the composer's songs in and out of the narrative according to their emotional content and give us the intimate story of a musical colossus.\n\nThe two act evening features a zesty smorgasbord of Berlin tunes -- many well known, many rarely heard. Some are performed in their totality; others are woven into evocative medleys that punctuate dramatic arcs in Berlin's life. This show is rich in American history as well as a deeply moving theatrical event.\n\nA salute to the great Broadway and Hollywood lyricist Dorothy Fields, the first woman elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nThe daughter of famed vaudevillian and theatrical producer Lew Fields, Dorothy Fields was a schoolteacher when she met composer Jimmy McHugh and found her talent as a lyricist. In 1928 they scored their first big hit with I Can't Give You Anything But Love. For the next five decades Fields collaborated with such legendary composers as Jerome Kern, Arthur Schwartz and Cy Coleman, and produced such imperishable gems as I'm In the Mood for Love, Don't Blame Me, Pick Yourself Up, He Had Refinement, Lovely to Look At, The Way You Look Tonight, I Won't Dance, Growing Pains, Poor Everybody Else, Baby Dream Your Dream, Remind Me and Sunny Side of the Street, which KT and Mark will render in their inimitable fashion.\n\nThis delightful duo effortlessly migrates between operetta, story-telling, nonchalant anecdotes and complex, yet easy-on-the-ear, his and hers medleys. Lamenting (Ira Gershwin style) that it’s a pity they had never met before, they bounce songs back and forth like balls in a top class tennis match.\n\n​\n\nCovering mostly standard material ranging from Who Cares to They All Laughed and a wonderfully poignant rendition of Chicago’s Class, they are equally at home entertaining solo. Ross is endearing as much as he is commanding, but most of all it is his superb piano playing and lyric positioning that stand out. His phrasing is reminiscent of Fred Astaire and the late Bobby Short.\n\n​\n\nSullivan plays to her heritage with some 19th century authentic Irish material and wandr’es through cadenzas in Poor Wandr’ing One with gusto. She also salutes the great early 20th century cabaret singer Mabel Mercer. - Jennifer Reischel\n\nTucked into the saucy cabaret revue “Vienna to Weimar,” a survey of Austrian and German songs from operetta through the Weimar era at the Triad, is a guilty pleasure titled “A Little Attila.” Composed in 1922 by Rudolf Nelson and translated into English by Jeremy Lawrence, the song is a politically incorrect rape fantasy focused on Attila the Hun, whom the song describes as “a cute little brute” who’s “selfish and oblivious, lascivious and lewd.” The narrator declares, “I don’t need a flotilla or a villa by the sea/but oh for a scintilla of some virility.” - Stephen Holden, New York Times"
