        "text": "KINTNERSVILLE, Pa. -- Arthur Schwartz, who wrote scores of Broadway's most memorable melodies including 'Dancing in the Dark' and 'That's Entertainment,' died Tuesday at his Bucks County home. He was 83.\n\nSchwartz collaborated with Broadway's finest lyricists, including Ira Gershwin, Oscar Hammerstein II, Frank Loesser, Dorothy Sields and Leo Robin, but he was most famous for his longtime partnership with Howard Dietz.\n\nIn addition to 'Dancing in the Dark' and 'That's Entertainment,' Schwartz and Dietz wrote 'By Myself,' 'I Guess I'll Have Change My Plan,' 'You and the Night and the Music,' 'Alone Together' and 'Something to Remember You By.'\n\nSchwartz's career spanned six decades and his work was marked by romantic, graceful melodies often compared to the music of Jerome Kern.\n\n'Arthur Schwartz was not only one of America's great songwriters, but also a beloved colleague and friend,' lyricist Hal David said.\n\n'He was one of the sharpest minds in our business -- a true giant - whose contributions will be missed, but whose music happily will stay with us.'\n\nSchwartz, responsible for stage and screen smashes such as 'The Band Wagon' and 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,' began collaborating with Dietz in 1929's 'The Little Show.'\n\nThe show featured 'I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan.' The song eventually became a standard, but did not catch on as a hit in the United States until several years later, when it was brought back from England.\n\nOther shows included 'Three's A Crowd,' 'At Home Abroad,' 'Inside USA,' 'By the Beatiful Sea' and 'The Gay Life,' whose score was considered to be one of Schwartz's masterpieces.\n\nIn addition to his songwriting career, Schwartz produced several Hollywood films including 'Night and Day,' a biography of Cole Porter, and 'Cover Girl,' starring Rita Hayworth.\n\nSchwartz, born in Brooklyn on Nov. 25, 1900, composed songs at an early age but planned a career in law. He wrote several football songs while working toward a bachelor's degree at New York University.\n\nHe went on to obtain a master's degree in literature from Columbia University and passed the bar in 1924.\n\nHis last show was 'Jennie' in 1963, starring Mary Martin. 'That's Entertainment,' an anthology of Schwartz-Dietz songs, had a short run in 1972.\n\nSchwartz is survived by his wife, Mary, and two sons, Jonathan and Paul."
