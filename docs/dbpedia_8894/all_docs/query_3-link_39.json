        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe formal process of specialization and subspecialization in medicine began at the start of the 20th century. Although forensic psychiatry has long held a central place within organized psychiatry, it was not officially recognized as a subspecialty until the end of the 20th century. This milestone was achieved through the efforts of many leaders in the field, and prominent among them has been Howard Zonana, MD. His contributions as a clinician, scholar, leader, and mentor over the past several decades have helped advance the maturation of forensic psychiatry and pave the way for its accreditation as a subspecialty. A review of his career illuminates the core stages of this process.\n\nOn April 22 and 23, 2010, the Yale University School of Medicine held a Festschrift to celebrate the work of Howard Zonana, MD. Six months earlier, I had received a phone call that left me feeling delighted, but somewhat stunned. Would I give a keynote presentation? As one of Dr. Zonana's 69 former and then current fellows, my assignment was to describe the development of the fellowship program and the impact that it has had. My words would have to speak for all of my fellowship colleagues in a way that did justice to our collective experience and to what the man we refer to only as Howard has meant to each of us.\n\nI accepted the assignment, of course, but I quickly realized that Dr. Zonana's role as a mentor and fellowship director tells only a small part of the story of his overall contributions to the development of forensic psychiatry as a recognized subspecialty area. A Festschrift in honor of his career to date would be woefully incomplete without an attempt to pull all of this together. Other speakers would focus on different aspects of his career, but I decided to tackle the daunting task of describing the full nature of his professional achievements.\n\nPart of the preparation for my presentation involved talking to, corresponding with, and reading the testimonials of over a hundred people, including former and current fellows, members of the legal and psychiatric professions, and Dr. Zonana's family. Both my talk and this article rely heavily on their words to characterize Dr. Zonana's professional contributions and accomplishments and his personal attributes. Limited presentation time and journal space have allowed me to include just a sample of what I heard, but I will try to summarize some of the main themes that came up over and over again from people of all backgrounds. The traits of Dr. Zonana that they described are among the attributes that have enabled him to figure so prominently in the establishment of forensic psychiatry as a recognized and respected subspecialty.\n\nAlmost without exception, people commented on Dr. Zonana's intellectual prowess and curiosity. He has the ability to ask the unthought-of question that compels a person to rethink what has previously seemed to be a complete and coherent analysis of a topic. His insights often reveal the inadequacies of simplistic explanations while simultaneously making the complex understandable. Although he can instantly deflate a well-reasoned but faulty premise, he does so with a soft-spoken wisdom that leaves the recipient feeling acknowledged as well as enlightened. He conveys a respect and humility that allows people to be fundamentally swayed in their understanding of a topic but still feel good about it.\n\nDr. Zonana's honesty and integrity also came up in almost every conversation, correspondence, and testimonial. Prosecutors, defense lawyers, and judges, for example, commented on their esteem for Dr. Zonana and his unwavering practice of calling it straight, regardless of the side that retains him. For whomever he spoke, his ethics were right, His respect came from colleagues and judges alike.—Jack Zeldes, Esq., and Nancy Zeldes\n\nMany people made special note of Dr. Zonana's warmth, compassion, and humor. Although he can come across as reserved and even a bit intimidating on first encounter, this impression does not last long for those who get to know him. Scratch the surface and his true colors shine through. Perceptive observers pick up on the surprising shyness that underlies his initially restrained exterior. A “playful smile along with the twinkle in his eye is what readily comes to mind” when his former fellows think of him. Anyone who has the good fortune to experience misfortune in his presence discovers an ally prepared to mobilize his resources to assist in any way he can. Several people commented on how he drew on his connections within the medical community to find the best resources when they or their loved ones faced serious illness. He is also, as so many noted, always generous and accessible to anyone in need of his time and guidance. I was pleased, albeit somewhat disappointed, to learn that he responds to all requests for advice and takes everyone's phone calls, not just mine.\n\nDr. Zonana's intellect, skills, and character traits help explain his success as one of the foremost contributors to the formal recognition of forensic psychiatry. In recent years, he has been our preeminent spokesperson and ambassador. After briefly reviewing the history of specialization and subspecialization in medicine and the highlights of the early history of forensic psychiatry in this country, I will examine Dr. Zonana's influence as a clinician, scholar, leader, and mentor. In each of these roles, he has advanced the stature of forensic psychiatry within the core components that make up a psychiatric subspecialty."
