        "text": "A veteran pianist gazes intently at the piano keys in front of her. The Kansas City radio studio is quiet, the microphones eagerly awaiting the sound of her music. This isn’t anything new for her. She’s performed improvised piano pieces to packed Vaudeville houses for years — and this piano expert is only 14 years old.\n\nBorn in Kansas City, Missouri in 1909, Dana Suesse’s own personal “Missouri Misery” was that she was considered a bit of an oddity by kids her age. “There is only one thing worse than being an only child, and that is being an only child that is also a child prodigy. Your peers consider you some kind of freak and hate you when their mothers goad them to practice piano,” Suesse is quoted in Peter Mintun’s bio of her in Dana Suesse: Jazz Nocturne.\n\nOn October 1st, 1982, Suesse was presented with the key to the city of Kansas City, Missouri, and it was proclaimed Dana Suesse Day.\n\nSuesse composed “Missouri Misery” in 1934 with the help of America’s hardest working lyricist and boyhood friend or Ira and George Gershwin, Yip Harburg. Harburg is most famous for writing the lyrics to the song “Over the Rainbow,” but if that’s all you know of him, it’s time to learn more.\n\nYip Harburg once said, ”I’ve always thought that the way to educate, to teach, the way to live without being miserable, even though you’re surrounded by misery, was to laugh at the things that made you miserable.” His lyrics are, first and foremost, original. If you hear a song that has predictable lyrics, you know it is not a Yip Harburg song. A Yip Harburg song can be comical, meaningful, and beautiful, all at the same time.\n\nThe prolific, top-tier American lyricist Johnny Mercer had this to say about what he learned from working with Harburg: “Yip Harburg will sit in a room all day and he’ll dig and he’ll dig and he’ll dig. And it shows, I think. He’s witty. He has inventive words. When Yip writes a comedy song for the stage I think he’s almost without equal. Yip was a big influence in teaching me how hard to work.” (See below for a list of some of Harburg’s musical collaborators.)\n\nHarburg’s lyrics for “Missouri Misery” are certainly unique: a man needs to get back to the woman he loves in Missouri. Its near-rhyme title makes for a bit of a novelty song, so it never quite captured the world’s attention as a lyric. It was recorded by the Dorsey Brothers’ Orchestra and was also sung by Dick Robertson with Jerry Johnson and His Orchestra. Other than that, “Missouri Misery” appears to have gotten little exposure, as it never showed up in any Broadway shows.\n\nDownload the fake-book style sheet music to “Missouri Misery” here: Missouri Misery\n\nLyrics to “Missouri Misery” by Yip Harburg:\n\nNo rest, no sleep, no dreaming.\n\nNo dusk, no dawn for me.\n\nThat love-sick, home-sick demon\n\nsays, “Mister, hop a train and stop this old Missouri misery.”\n\nTried for diggin’ gold up in Alaska.\n\nOl’ Missouri gal she voodoo me.\n\nTried to burn my bridges in Nebraska.\n\nThrough the golden corn her eyes I see.\n\nNo rest, no sleep, no dreaming.\n\nNothin’ you can do but hop a choo-choo to Missouri\n\nwhen you got Missouri misery."
