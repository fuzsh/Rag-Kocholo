        "text": "Recent news articles about the American shipbuilding industry lagging far behind China, Japan, and South Korea brought to mind my first job after finishing college. While attending college I worked as a technician at Emerson Electric designing motors for refrigerators and air conditioners. That experience helped he land a job at Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company writing FØRTAN programs for electrical engineering applications.\n\nMy major project was a voltage drop program for the USS Nimitz (CVN-68) and USS Eisenhower (CVN-69) aircraft carriers. I worked with an engineer I will call Howard, who was a little older than me but considerably more experienced. Howard was so convinced that the shipyard was wasting money that he offered to work for no salary if he could keep a small percentage of what he saved them. He viewed inefficient practices at the shipyard as shoveling money into the James River and letting it float away into the ocean. Management didn’t consider his offer seriously. From recent news reports American shipbuilders haven’t become that much more efficient than they were in the early 1970s.\n\nHoward provided the theory and I developed a model and wrote code to implement it. As electricity travels along a wire, a portion of it is loss to resistance. The longer the wire, the greater the loss. If the loss is too great, the size of the wire must be increased. Since wires can’t grow to increase in size, they must be replaced with a wire of the same length but of a larger diameter. If a wire proved to be too short, it couldn’t be lengthened; a new one must be cut. This was where the problems lay. For an aircraft carrier, the wires that distribute electrical current throughout the ship are very large in diameter and long, sometimes as thick as a grown man’s forearm just below the elbow and as long as a football field. This is a lot of copper and copper is expensive, too expensive to be throwing into the James River.\n\nEngineers computed the lengths and gauges (thickness) of the cables (wires) that were needed in a room reminiscent of the scenes in the movie Hidden Figures where men computed figures for NASA’s Mercury Program. Changes or errors rippled down the line causing many previous calculations to be incorrect and requiring up- and/or downstream cables to be changed. These computations took a lot of time to make and were often completed after the cables were cut. Too often cables had to be replaced with larger, more expensive ones. If that wasn’t waste enough, the replaced cables were often not used elsewhere, just scrapped.\n\nThe computer program we developed performed the computations much more quickly than could be done manually. Making corrections before cables were cut would save millions of dollars over the construction of a behemoth carrier. Howard and I considered doing the manual calculations drudgery plus Howard knew of important engineering tasks that were not being done because engineers were tied up calculating voltage drops. His hope was to free up his colleagues from this drudgery to do actual engineering. Comfortable with the existing task and fearful of the unknown, the engineers resisted the change. Human nature does not change quickly, so one would expect new inefficiencies now exist and aren’t being corrected.\n\nThe Nimitz and Eisenhower are now scheduled to be scrapped by the end of the decade. One wonders if their replacements are being built more efficiently. I suspect so but not as efficiently as those being built in China, Japan, and South Korea.\n\nOne of the artifacts Craighead House holds is a framed certificate complete with official seal and ribbon from then governor of Kentucky, John Y. Brown Jr., commissioning Jean Craighead George as a Kentucky Colonel. It was dated 9 September 1983, the 92nd year of the Commonwealth. Like Pennsylvania, Kentucky is also a commonwealth, whatever that means.\n\nResearch into Indiana’s Sagamore of the Wabash honorific found that the Bluegrass State’s Kentucky Colonel program had existed long before Indiana’s. Kentucky’s goes all the way back to its first governor, Isaac Shelby, who put his son-in-law, Charles Todd, on his staff with the title of Colonel, and not to the Civil War as many suspect. Shelby, who had fought in battles against the Indians in colonial times and against the British during the Revolutionary War, as governor raised a force of 3,500 volunteers and led them in the Battle of Thames during the War of 1812 against the British. After the war, he commissioned all who had enlisted in his regiment as Colonels. Later on, other governors commissioned Colonels to act as their protectors. They even wore uniforms and were present at most official functions.\n\nIn 1932, the chief counsel of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, Charles Pettijohn, convinced then Governor Ruby Laffoon to found The Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels. He then appointed Pettijohn as the National Commanding General of the Order, a position that was responsible for the finances of the Order. Anna Bell Ward was appointed Secretary and was given the task of organizing the Order. Later on it was made a charitable organization.\n\nThe Governor and Lieutenant Governor serve as the unpaid Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief, respectively. The Order continues to this day. Commissions are for the recipients’ lifetimes but membership in the Order requires annual donations to the Good Works Program. The Order also sells memorabilia to raise money and holds a major event over the Kentucky Derby weekend each year. Active members are also expected to help out during the Annual Day of Service.\n\nNumerous famous people, including movie actors, Presidents, and star athletes. Winston Churchill was a Kentucky Colonel. The most unusual commissioning was that of John Glenn while he was orbiting the earth in a Mercury capsule.\n\nSomeone must have considered Jean’s works important enough to nominate her commission.\n\nBelow is what was mounted on the backside of her commission.\n\nLast week the wife of one of my grad school professors called to tell me that he had died. I won’t dwell here on the tremendous loss his demise is to me but will explore something new I learned. This Indiana University professor was a leader in his field for decades and received many honors, one of which may sound unusual. He was made a Sagamore of the Wabash, the state’s highest civilian honor, by the Governor of Indiana. Unfamiliar with this name, I looked up its meaning. As defined by Merriam-Webster, a sagamore is a subordinate Algonquin chief or sachem. In practice, a sagamore was a person the head chief relied on for advice due to his experience and wisdom. My old professor definitely was a source of wisdom and he didn’t hold a high political office. The Wabash part is self-explanatory to anyone familiar with the geography of Indiana or is aware of songs about that river, including the popular song recorded by The Mills Brothers among others, “On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away,” which was established as the Indiana State Song by the Indiana Code in 1913. But how did this honorific come into being?\n\nIndiana Governor Ralph Gates (1945-1949) was about to attend a tri-state conference with officials of Ohio and Kentucky in Cincinnati when he was informed that the governor of Kentucky was planning on naming him a Kentucky Colonel, the Bluegrass State’s highest honor. Something had to be done because Indiana had no such honor. The Life and Times of Little Turtle, First Sagamore of the Wabash provided more details on the honorific’s conception: “In 1946 Indiana governor Ralph F. Gates created the Council of the Sagamores of the Wabash in response to a suggestion made by Samuel R. Harrell, who had been named a Kentucky Colonel and felt that Indiana needed a similar reciprocal honorary organization. Kurt Pantzer joined with Harrell in devising the details.” Business executive (and World War I pilot) Samuel R. Harrell and attorney Kurt Pantzer were both good Hoosiers, Wabash College alums, and friends of Governor Gates. Harrell suggested “Honorary Citizen of Indiana” for the name of the award. Attorney General James Emmert proposed “Hoosier Schoolmaster.” Patzer’s idea “‘Sagamore of the Wabash’ was deemed to be more deeply steeped in the history of Indiana.”\n\nGovernor Gates made Simeon S. Willis, Governor of Kentucky, the first Sagamore of the Wabash and Ohio Senator Robert Taft the second. Kentucky wags suggested that Willis’s naming the Indiana governor a “Kentucky Colonel” as “a long step forward toward getting Indiana cooks to stop putting sugar in cornbread.”\n\nAfter reading up on this topic I recalled that Jean Craighead George had been named a “Kentucky Colonel.” More on that next time.\n\nUsing the GI Bill’s education benefits he had earned by serving in the Navy, Fred enrolled in a nuclear engineering program at Oregon State University. His medical conditions and the treatments for them made attending college difficult. The medications prescribed for him may have included opioids because Fred sometimes found himself to be “out of whack” and unable to concentrate. A bright spot was discovering a sign from someone looking for a person owning a 1962 man’s suit. Fred had one and responded. He was hired to play “grim, balding professor” in the movie Animal House. He was paid $35 for the day of work and was fed well. He recalled the actors who played Neidermeyer and Dean Wormer as being jerks.\n\nGetting a passing grade on a test, when his mind was disheveled by the medications he was prescribed, disillusioned him about the nuclear engineering program. He feared that incompetent people might be given degrees and could create another Three Mile Island disaster. These feelings caused him to drop out of the program.\n\nLater, Fred enrolled in the architecture program at the University of Oregon, graduating with a B.S. degree. Sadly, his physical condition prevented him from putting his education to full use as he was frequently having medical episodes requiring treatment in hospitals. He was able to make the wooden parts for the mobiles his wife Nancy made and sold.\n\nWhen he was in his 60s and about to lose their house, a VA nurse stepped in to help. All Fred wanted was assistance from the VA in paying for the expensive medications he had to take to stay alive. After reviewing his case, the moder-day Florence Nightingale filed the necessary paperwork to get Fred a 100% disability caused by his Navy service. The money from this allowed Fred and Nancy to live in modest comfort.\n\nFred is now gone, too early as the result of what happened to him in the Navy."
