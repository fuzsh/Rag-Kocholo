        "text": "This piece is a jazz standard that was composed by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz. Schwartz was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 25, 1900 and died on September 3, 1984. He began playing piano and harmonica at a very young age and also wrote silent films at the age of fourteen. Dietz was born on September 8,1896 and died on July 30, 1983. He was a publicist and lyrists. Him and Schwartz first started working together when they teamed up for a Broadway show in 1929. They composed Alone Together in 1932 for the Broadway musical “Flying Colors” (Schwartz composing the music and Dietz the lyrics). This particular piece is considered a ballad, meaning that the tune tells a story. Ballads come from the French chanson and they are often made up of thirteen lines with an ABABBCBC form. It was originally used for dance tunes, but in the nineteenth century it was used for slow tunes. The actual form for Alone Together is AABA. The significant thing about the first two A sections, is that it is fourteen bars long which is very uncommon when it comes to American song writing. In common song writing, each A section is only eight bars long. The bridge of the tune also known as the B section is quite normal. It is the standard eight bar length which leads to the last eight bars of the third A section. The tune is written in key of D minor, but, instead of playing a D minor in the thirteenth measure of the last A section, Schwartz decides to play a D major which is called a Picardy"
