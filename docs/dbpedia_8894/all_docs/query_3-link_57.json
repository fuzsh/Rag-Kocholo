        "text": "During rehearsals for ''I Married an Angel,'' a 1938 musical comedy about a Hungarian banker, the show's lyricist, Lorenz Hart, a quick-witted master of the last-minute fix, decided to add a new number called ''At the Roxy Music Hall.'' When Joshua Logan, the director, asked anxiously how a number filled with allusions to contemporary New York personalities could possibly be made to fit into a comedy set in old Budapest, Hart answered airily: ''Well, just bring up the subject of New York. You can't sing about Budapest all night. We've got to give people a little fun.''\n\nThough Hart's collaborator, the composer Richard Rodgers, moved out of the city to Fairfield, Conn., in the early 40's, Hart remained behind, giving parties for the homosexual elite in his duplex at the Ardsley on Central Park West. On a visit to Khartoum he was indignant to learn that his hotel didn't carry Variety.\n\nTo Hart's mind, no musical comedy, whatever its putative locale, could be inhospitable to a mention of New York. Dependent on a lavish flow of cash and illusion, too loud and fast-moving for introspection or tragic denouements, the city is not only the birthplace of the musical comedy form but also its primary exemplar.\n\nManhattan's skyline, a competitive cluster of peaks and flops, metamorphoses architecture into a musical number, an affected riot of energy as irregular and surprising as the popular jazz rhythms Hart evoked into diabolically inventive lyrics. Daringly divorced from its continent, a gigantic, jagged sculpture served up to the world on an exceedingly fragile platter, New York is the ''Syncopated City'' (the first title of George and Ira Gershwin's ''Fascinating Rhythm''), a vaudeville act of desperation and glee. ''Now I'm sane,'' a Hart lyric runs, ''but I'd rather be gaga!''\n\nMovie musicals came in with the advent of the talkies in the late 1920's. From the start they depended on Broadway and Tin Pan Alley talent, including Rodgers and Hart, all of whose hit shows were turned into movies. Hollywood's most important artists in the musical form -- notably Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Bob Fosse -- began on Broadway and kept up with its fashions after they left; Fosse alternated between plays and movies throughout his career.\n\nThe big Hollywood studios maintained large, all-purpose New York City sets where New York stories like ''Broadway Melody'' (1929), ''42d Street'' (1933), ''Easter Parade'' (1948) and ''My Sister Eileen'' (1955) were largely shot. A montage of the neon signs of Times Square, a glimpse of a palpably cardboard Empire State Building, a Cole Porter tune on the soundtrack, is enough to tell us where we are. One of the most photographed cities in the world, New York, like the musical, is a state of mind, an instance of the supremely American confusion of the real and the fake. A New York set is a real New York location.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
