        "text": "After studying journalism at Columbia University, Howard Dietz took a job in advertising, where he designed a certain roaring lion logo for film producer Samuel Goldwyn. Following military service during World War I, his ambitions turned to songwriting as he became one of the more steady lyricists on Broadway. His career caught fire when he was introduced to Arthur Schwartz, and the pair collaborated on the scores for several Broadway musicals and revues, penning memorable songs, such as \"I Guess Iâll Have To Change My Plan,\" \"Something To Remember You By,\" \"You And The Night And The Music,\" and the enduring \"Dancing In The Dark.\"\n\nHOMETOWN\n\nNew York, NY, United States of America\n\nBORN\n\n8 September 1896\n\nGENRE\n\nJazz"
