        "text": "From sea to shining sea this country has produced some of the greatest songs in the world.\n\n24/7 Wall St. has collected the best song about every state, or song pertaining to that state. In certain cases, songs about popular cities within the state were selected as a proxy for the state. We’ve got ballads and rockers, tearjerkers and party anthems on this list. It’s a list as diverse as America itself and, like our nation, it’s full of surprises.\n\nSome of the songs on our list are tributes penned by hometown heroes, but many were written by out-of-staters who were moved to song. Another surprise is that not all of the top tracks state-by-state are tributes. Many of these songs are personal reflections by the songwriter that merely use a specific state or city as a backdrop. A few of these tracks even express dissatisfaction with the state they are about.\n\nTo determine the best song about every state, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the top-played songs about each state – or songs using a state as a major theme – on Spotify. Spotify play counts are as of July 25, 2018, and are rounded to the nearest thousand.\n\n1. Alabama\n\nSong: Sweet Home Alabama\n\nArtist: Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nSpotify plays: 305,858,000\n\nThough originally from Florida, Lynyrd Skynyrd band members became icons all over the South after \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was released. The song was written as joke by Skynyrd in response to Neil Young's harsh view of the South in \"Southern Man.\" Skynyrd were actually a bunch of Neil Young fans, and Young later said he preferred \"Sweet Home Alabama\" to \"Southern Man.\"\n\n2. Alaska\n\nSong: North to Alaska\n\nArtist: Johnny Horton\n\nSpotify plays: 4,018,000\n\n\"North to Alaska\" was Johnny Horton's biggest hit, but the country star didn't live to see the success. The song hit No. 1 on the Billboard Country charts just days after Horton was killed in a car accident in Texas.\n\n3. Arizona\n\nSong: Take It Easy\n\nArtist: Eagles\n\nSpotify plays: 96,247,000\n\nThis Eagles classic was co-written with their soon-to-be famous Los Angeles neighbor, Jackson Browne. Glenn Frey, who first heard Browne's song about a street corner in Winslow, Arizona, helped Browne finish the lyrics. Recorded later by the Eagles, \"Take It Easy\" was the band's first ever single.\n\n4. Arkansas\n\nSong: Mary Queen of Arkansas\n\nArtist: Bruce Springsteen\n\nSpotify plays: 1,027,000\n\n\"Mary Queen of Arkansas\" was one of four songs Bruce Springsteen played during his audition with legendary CBS Records producer John Hammond on May 22, 1972.

California\n\nSong: California Love\n\nArtist: 2Pac\n\nSpotify plays: 129,482,000\n\nThis iconic West Coast jam marked a rare collaboration between 2Pac and Dr. Dre. Despite the tune's massive success, the two hip-hop legends didn't share much California love for one another. Dre even told journalist Harris Rosen at the time that the two had never met in person -- a highly dubious claim.\n\n6. Colorado\n\nSong: Rocky Mountain High\n\nArtist: John Denver\n\nSpotify plays: 17,807,000\n\n\"Rocky Mountain High\" was a top 10 hit for John Denver in 1972, but it also dragged the country star into controversy. The song was temporarily censored by the FCC that year for perceived drug references. Denver ardently denied the claims.\n\n7. Connecticut\n\nSong: Peace Connecticut\n\nArtist: Apathy\n\nSpotify plays: 79,000\n\nApathy, a.k.a Chad Bromley, is a native of Willimantic, Connecticut, and does his home state proud on this Da Beatminerz-produced track. The track even gets a nice cred boost from Raekwon, who provides the signature sample from his own track \"Incarcerated Scarfaces.\"\n\n8. Delaware\n\nSong: Delaware Slide\n\nArtist: George Thorogood & The Destroyers\n\nSpotify plays: 471,000\n\nGeorge Thorogood has been the First State's chief ambassador of blues rock since the 1970s. Before he and the Delaware Destroyers topped the charts, however, he was busking in California. A passerby recommended him for an opening slot with Bonnie Raitt that launched his career. Thorogood showed his Delaware pride with the nearly eight-minute \"Delaware Slide\" on his band's debut album.\n\n9. Florida\n\nSong: Miami\n\nArtist: Will Smith\n\nSpotify plays: 84,721,000\n\nWill Smith scored top 20 success with his 1997 track \"Miami\" and wasn't kidding when he professed his love to the Florida city. Nearly 10 years later he gushed about Miami while speaking with Virgin Radio Dubai, saying \"my two favorite cities on earth are Dubai and Miami.\"\n\n10. Georgia\n\nSong: The Devil Went Down to Georgia\n\nArtist: Charlie Daniels Band\n\nSpotify plays: 42,037,000\n\nCharlie Daniels is originally from North Carolina but will forever be loved in the Peach State for \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia.\" Daniels says the song was inspired by a fiddle-themed poem titled \"The Mountain Whippoorwill.\"\n\n11.

In 2017, band member Cindy Wilson told Idaho's Sandpoint Reader, \"It's always fun to come back to Idaho.\"\n\n13. Illinois\n\nSong: Illinois\n\nArtist: Brett Eldredge\n\nSpotify plays: 2,940,000\n\nBrett Eldredge brings a healthy dose of home state pride to his anthem \"Illinois.\" The track was, in fact, penned by Eldredge along with his co-writers after an afternoon cruising through some of the rural farming communities near the singer's hometown.\n\n14. Indiana\n\nSong: Small Town\n\nArtist: John Mellencamp\n\nSpotify plays: 20,822,000\n\nJohn Mellencamp's \"Small Town\" is a classic anthem in Indiana, but the first draft of the lyrics was riddled with spelling errors. He struggled so mightily typing out the lyrics that members of his family laughed out loud as his digital typewriter rejected the misspellings.\n\n15. Iowa\n\nSong: Iowa (Traveling, Pt. 3)\n\nArtist: Dar Williams\n\nSpotify plays: 556,000\n\n\"Iowa (Traveling, Pt. 3)\" has endeared Dar Williams to the residents of the Hawkeye State, but the state also occupies a piece of her heart. Williams told website GoPride that she loves to write while on the road, and that she has \"little pieces of [her] personality identifying with all of these different parts of the country.\"\n\n16. Kansas\n\nSong: Wichita Lineman\n\nArtist: Glen Campbell\n\nSpotify plays: 11,313,000\n\n\"Wichita Lineman\" is certainly one of the most popular songs based in Kansas, but it wasn't born out of a love for the state. After scoring a hit with \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix,\" Glen Campbell was looking for a follow up. Songwriter Jimmy Webb, in \"American Songwriter\" magazine, recalled him asking, \"Can you write me a song about a town?\"\n\n17. Kentucky\n\nSong: Blue Moon of Kentucky\n\nArtist: Elvis Presley\n\nSpotify plays: 2,578,000\n\nThe King of Rock and Roll ascended his throne in the Bluegrass State after recording his version of Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" in 1954.

Louisiana\n\nSong: House of the Rising Sun\n\nArtist: The Animals\n\nSpotify plays: 217,462,000\n\nFor decades, New Orleans historians have suggested that the legendary \"House of the Rising Sun\" was purely fictional. If the famed \"house in New Orleans\" referenced in the song ever existed, the New Orleans Times Picayune says it was probably located at 535-537 Conti St., which was once a hotel called the Rising Sun Hotel.\n\n19. Maine\n\nSong: Portland, Maine\n\nArtist: Donovan Woods\n\nSpotify plays: 25,657,000\n\nDonovan Woods wrote \"Portland, Maine\" out of frustration with his commercial songwriting work in Nashville. After making numerous trips to Music City, trying to write radio-friendly hits for other artists, he penned the kind of song he personally liked. The result – \"Portland, Maine\" – was subsequently recorded by Tim McGraw and Woods later released his own version.\n\n20. Maryland\n\nSong: Baltimore\n\nArtist: Nina Simone\n\nSpotify plays: 17,289,000\n\nNina Simone's iconic track \"Baltimore\" was penned for her by Randy Newman.

Massachusetts\n\nSong: I'm Shipping Up to Boston\n\nArtist: The Dropkick Murphys\n\nSpotify plays: 96,115,000\n\n\"I'm Shipping Up To Boston\" is an anthem for the entire New England region, but the lyrics were initially just placeholders. Dropkick Murphys' singer Ken Casey says that he heard a Woody Guthrie line about a \"sailor peg\" and improvised the rest in a rehearsal.\n\n22. Michigan\n\nSong: Detroit Rock City\n\nArtist: Kiss\n\nSpotify plays: 41,594,000\n\nKiss helped define Detroit's rock identity with \"Detroit Rock City,\" but the storyline that plays out in the song didn't take place in Detroit. Paul Stanley reportedly had the song title and finished the rest of the lyrics after a fan was killed outside a Kiss show in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n23. Minnesota\n\nSong: Say Shh\n\nArtist: Atmosphere\n\nSpotify plays: 584,000\n\nAtmosphere's \"Say Shh\" is beloved in the group's home state of Minnesota. Speaking of the track, member Slug says it's relatable for those living outside of the state, as well, telling news website Minnesota Connected, \"A song like 'Say Shh' translates well because it's about being proud of where you're from. Many people can relate to that if they choose to.\"\n\n24.

New Jersey\n\nSong: Jersey Girl\n\nArtist: Bruce Springsteen\n\nSpotify plays: 7,299,000\n\nBruce Springsteen sits atop the pantheon of New Jersey rock stars, but his classic \"Jersey Girl\" was actually penned by Tom Waits.
