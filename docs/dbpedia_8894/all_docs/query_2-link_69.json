Johnny Fontenot officiating.\n\nThomas was born on August 17, 1935, in Iota to William and Mary Miller Dietz, who preceded him in death. He was a graduate of Iota High School and a veteran of the United States Navy. Thomas had a deep passion for fishing, hunting, and gardening; however, he also took pleasure in cooking and making wine. Above all else, spending time with his family brought him immeasurable joy. Thomas will be dearly missed by all who had the privilege of knowing and loving him especially his wife of sixty-two years, Anna Mae Dietz of Iota; his son, Thomas J. Dietz Jr. and wife, Mary of Iota; daughters, Jennifer Ann Aube of Slidell, Margaret “ Angie” Noe and husband, Jerry of Iota, and Leah Michelle Bertrand of Iota; seven grandchildren, Chasity Bush, Peyton Aube, Lacey Dietz, Alyssa Dietz, Erik Richardson, Jacob Dietz, and Jack Dietz; six great-grandchildren, Jaci Lyons, Ty Bush, Gunner Doucet, Kylan Gaspard, Kenzie Scarborough, and Kaden Floyd; as well as extended family and friends.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his son, David Paul Dietz; his parents; granddaughter, Melissa Scarborough; and his eight siblings.\n\nVisitation will be held at Ardoin’s Funeral Home in Iota on Saturday, January 20, 2024, from 9:00 am until time of services.\n\nWe invite you to leave memories and upload photos to the memorial page to honor Thomas’s life at www.ardoinfuneralhomes.com. Your love and support are greatly appreciated during this difficult time.\n\nArdoin’s Funeral Home of Iota, 840 Howard Street, (337)779.3083 is in charge of arrangements."
