        "text": "Central Coast captain Danny Vukovic says his travel weary AFC Cup-winning Mariners side will be “as best prepared as possible” for Friday night’s A-League finals clash with Sydney FC.\n\nThe triumphant Mariners – who on Monday morning (AEST) secured $2.3m in prizemoney by becoming just the second A-League men’s outfit to win an Asian club competition after beating Lebanese team Al-Ahed 1-0 in the Cup final in Oman – won’t arrive home until Tuesday night.\n\nThey will then have 72 hours to get themselves ready for their A-League semi-final first-leg clash against the Sky Blues at Allianz Stadium.\n\nWith Sydney hosting the first leg after the A-League premiership-winning Mariners chose to play the following weekend’s second leg at home in Gosford, Friday night was the only option, with Allianz Stadium booked for other codes on Saturday and Sunday.\n\n“We’ll go through recovery mode … and do what we can to be as best prepared for the game as possible,” Vukovic said after playing a leading role in the Mariners’ Cup triumph with a brilliant first-half save to deny Al-Ahed striker Lee Erwin.\n\n“That’s my job. The boys have been fantastic in front of me and a lot of time I don’t have to do as much work.\n\n“Tonight I had to make a couple of saves and that’s why I’m there. It was a full team effort throughout the tournament and we were deserved winners.”\n\nAn 84th-minute goal from substitute Alou Kuol at the Sultan Qaboos Sport Complex ensured the Mariners ended a 10-year wait for a second A-League club to win an Asian crown after Western Sydney Wanderers’ AFC Champions League success in 2014.\n\nHaving also clinched the A-League Premier’s Plate last Wednesday, the Mariners remain on track to win the treble, a feat they can seal by conquering the A-League finals series which would give them a third trophy this season and a second successive championship.\n\nMariners chairman Richard Peil said it would be an “amazing” feat.\n\n“We’re not kidding ourselves. We’ve got some big challenges ahead,” Peil said.\n\n“If we get through that (Sydney FC) challenge, there’ll be another great challenge (in the grand final) from either Melbourne Victory or Wellington.\n\n“There are four really good teams left in it, and I think anyone can win it.”\n\nMariners coach Mark Jackson said his side’s work wasn’t finished.\n\n“On to the next one now,\" said Jackson, who was full of praise for the “outstanding” Vukovic.\n\n“What a leader (he is) for this football club, and long may that continue.\n\n“He’s superb to have in the team. He leads by example.”\n\nThe Mariners will also go down in history as the final club to win the AFC Cup, which will be scrapped next season to make way for the three-tier Asian Football Confederation men’s club competitions – the AFC Champions League Elite, AFC Champions League 2 and AFC Challenge League.\n\nCentral Coast will contest the 2024-25 Champions League Elite competition courtesy of their A-League premiership win."
