He added that Maronites have full right in expressing opinion over the electoral law without having to impose anything on others.\n\nHe added that general Aoun's partaking in the Maronite Gathering is indicative of his agreeing to the resumption of national dialogue. He however, stressed need for implementing Taef before reaching a fair representation for all.\n\nKanaan described Aoun's attitude as being characterized by transparency without having to impose an electoral law on anyone. He spoke about what he termed as \"electoral money\" saying money and \"power-politics\" went hand-in-hand for a long time and during many electoral campaigns.\n\nKanaan criticized Hariri Trend's attitude towards the Bkerki gathering saying they were blowing rubrics out of proportion and that Aounists preserved the right in making their opinion public over any future electoral law.\n\nG.G./P.BC.\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Zahra: Orthodox proposal spares country sectarian tensions\n\nSat 17/12/2011 14:28\n\nNNA - 17/12/2011 - Lebanese Forces MP Antoine Zahra said Saturday to Radio Free Lebanon that the proposed electoral law submitted at Bkirky Summit is the best way out of sectarian strife.\n\nMaronite leaders were unanimous on Friday in agreeing on the Orthodox proposal which called for each sect to elect its own candidate based on proportional representation during parliamentary elections, while stressing the need to hold dialogue with the rest of Lebanese factions on the matter.\n\nZahra explained that, \"This law allows a better representation of each religious community while strengthening plurality and national partnership.\" He described those who attack attempts to correct parliamentary representation as \"hypocrites.\"\n\nOn another level, the Lebanese Forces MP criticized the methods of Hezbollah, the \"current Aounist\" Free Patriotic Movement (FPM), and the government in general, noting that it is the role of the opposition to rectify the performance of the cabinet. He added that the FPM believed that its slogan of reform allowed it to act at will in its ministries, just as Hezbollah believed its weapons permitted it to do whatever it wanted.\n\nZahra finally addressed the issue of funding of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon probing the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri, stressing that \"it is the government that funded it\" and that \"the story of the source of this funding was fabricated to avoid cabinet's resignation.\"\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Makari accuses Hizbullah of arrogance\n\nSat 17/12/2011 14:25\n\nNNA - 17/12/2011 - Deputy Speaker of the House, Farid Makari, criticized Hizbullah MPs' public appearances and attitude as arrogant and unbecoming.\n\nInterviewed by the Hariri-owned Paris-based As-Sharq Orient radio station today, the deputy said recent attitude of Hizbullah officials has been marred by haughty arrogance. He added that Party of God MPs simply wish to remain unaccountable for their actions and that they developed the bad habit of leveling accusations of treachery against their critics.\n\nMakari referred particularly to the verbal quarrel between Nawaf Mousawi and Sami Gemayel with the first resorting to abusive near-obscene language. The Deputy Speaker defended Gemayel saying he expressed sentiments of many Lebanese and that he remained pretty much composed through his address.\n\nHe concluded that recent Hizbullah utterances have become increasingly intolerable and unprecedented in dealings between parliamentarians. He however, commended House Speaker Berri's efforts to contain the situation.\n\nMakari challenged Hizbullah's ability to muster the Lebanese political game for a long time following the Syrian unrest. He dismissed the CGT as being an extension of March 8 and construed in Labor Minister Charbel Nahas's Law-suit against cabinet colleagues as a further testimony to the bad shape in which Mikati cabinet actually finds itself.\n\nHe however, commended the Prime Minister for his decision to fund the STL without government consent and had nice words for President Sleiman, who in his words gives the state and judicial system a positive facet.\n\nHe exonerated the Lebanese Canadian Banks saying it never engaged in any misconduct compared to other banks and ruled out Hizbullah's eventual handing over its four suspects and concluded that the Mikati government is here to stay because Asad deemed it so.\n\nG.G./P.BC.\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Adams from Mikati's: Canada reconsidering 2100 citizenships\n\nThu 15/12/2011 14:38\n\nNNA - 15/12/2011 - The Canadian Ambassador to Lebanon affirmed on Thursday that Canadian authorities were investigating the cases of 2100 citizens who had been naturalized despite not having been residing on Canadian territories prior to that period.\n\nAmbassador Hillary Childs Adams visited Prime Minister Najib Mikati at the Grand Serail, saying her visit came in the wake of Lebanon's decision to fund the Special Tribunal for Lebanon STL and for a briefing by Mikati on the Lebanese cabinet's priorities.\n\n\"Not all those being investigated are Lebanese. They belong to more than 100 countries,\" Adams said.\n\nShe explained that investigations have proven that many people who acquired the Canadian citizenship did not reside in Canada, as previously claimed.\n\n\"Canadian authorities are following up the matter to make sure that investigations take a transparent course and to make sure no one will receive an unjust verdict.\"\n\nMikati separately held talks with Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Minister Adnan Mansour over diplomatic formations.\n\nR.H.\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Sleiman for balanced development, administrative decentralization\n\nThu 15/12/2011 14:14\n\nNNA - 15/12/2011 - Lebanese President Michel Sleiman accentuated on Thursday the importance of achieving balanced development and mitigating burdens troubling the Lebanese people's lives, on daily basis.\n\nThe President who met at Baabda Palace with a number of visitors told them that the only means to achieve aspired goals at the developmental level in Lebanon was via the adoption of administrative decentralization.\n\n\"The Presidential General Directorate is devotedly following up Interior Ministry progress en route to the accomplishment of this project law which will rank first on the cabinet's works agenda, in the first half of 2012,\" the President promised, saying this step will directly follow the accomplishment of the Parliamentary electoral law and the budget law.\n\nOn another level, means of boosting the cellular phone network and internet services topped talks between the Lebanese President and Tele Communications Minister Nicolas Sehnawi.\n\nSleiman later tackled most recent local and regional political developments with MP Tamam Salam.\n\nOn emerging, Salam relayed Sleiman's call on the Lebanese to rise above petty squabbles, reminding that \"all should join ranks to face challenges threatening the nation with disintegration.\"\n\nR.H.\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Jarrah: We are more convinced to solve weapons issue\n\nThu 15/12/2011 10:32\n\nNNA - 15/12/2011 - Deputy Jamal Jarrah said that they (March 14) are more convinced to address weapons issue or matters would stay as they are or even get worse.\n\nThe MP felt sorry for the verbal language that was used on Wednesday in the Q&A parliament session between Deputies Nawaf Musawi and Sami Gemayel.\n\n\"It is dangerous to belittle the other team or treat it with disrespect\", the MP stressed on Thursday to \"Voice of Lebanon\"-Freedom and Dignity radio, adding that this confirms that weapons issue should be solved.\n\nOn the other hand, Jarrah said that the cabinet is trying to find exit for the social and wage increases issues but instead it is ruining things instead of solving them.\n\nA.A.M\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics - Asarta tackles security situation with Berri, Mikati\n\nWed 14/12/2011 19:21\n\nNNA - 14/12/2011 - UNIFIL spokesperson, Andrea Tenenti, on Wednesday stated that UNIFIL commander, Major General Alberto Asarta, had visited House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Najib Mikati to discuss the situation in UNIFIL operations area, in light of the recent incidents in South Lebanon.\n\nA statement by Tenenti said that General Asarta voiced to the Lebanese officials stern condemnation and concern over the attack which targeted the UNIFIL and the rocket firing from the Lebanese territories.\n\n\"The recent violent acts aim to undermine stability and peace in South Lebanon.

It is clear that there is a need to enhance security control in the region,\" he added.\n\n\"Recent incidents showed that despite all efforts exerted by the UNIFIL and the Lebanese Army, there are still weapons and hostile armed members in the [UNIFIL] operations area incompliantly with one of the most important clauses of the UNSC Resolution 1701,\" he concluded.\n\nR.A.H.\n\n© NNA 2011 All rights reserved\n\nPolitics -
