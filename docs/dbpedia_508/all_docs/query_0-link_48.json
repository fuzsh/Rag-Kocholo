There are more than 250,000 Palestinian people sporadically dispersed in the refugee camps in Sidon, Beirut and other major cities in the Levant. Displacement, conflict, trauma, unemployment and poverty are but some of the myriad factors that influence Palestinian refugee mental health. This article traces the historical, political and socioeconomic determinants of health for Palestinians exiled in Lebanon and describes the pivotal role that the non-Govenmental Organisation Medical Aid for Palestinians is playing in helping to alleviate the psychiatric distress of Palestinian sufferers of mental illness. The latter half of the manuscript contains an interview with a consultant psychiatrist about his experiences volunteering in the war-torn lands of Libya post Arab Spring. He expounds on how he feels mental healthcare services in Libya are woefully inadequate and broaches on his perception of how the resilience and the 'family-centric' model of the Libyan people has conferred a certain degree of protection towards developing severe psychiatric illness.\n\nLibyan Former Foreign Fighters and Their Effects on the Libyan Revolution\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-03-23\n\nGlocal organizations; Arab Spring; Sinjar Papers; CJSOTF 120; 16.

A questionnaire was addressed to 2 groups: health officials (n=60) and the general public (n=300). In their lists of health issues to focus on, 7 were the same although prioritization differed. Children and youth were considered the most important target groups and the school setting the most appropriate medium for them. Broadcast media were acknowledged as valuable for health education for the general public. We recommend systematic consultation across official and lay groups as a preliminary requisite for health education initiatives.\n\nThe Social Supervision and Its Role in Developing of the School Social Service in Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nTekali, Karima A.

To assess prevalence of acute stress disorder (ASD) and acute stress symptoms (ASS) in Jewish and Arab samples, and their correlates with demographic and exposure variables. Telephone survey conducted in the third week of the second Lebanon war with a random sample of 133 Jewish and 66 Arab adult residents of northern Israel. ASD, ASS and symptoms-related impairment were measured by the Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI) questionnaire, in addition to war-related exposure and demographic data. The majority of respondents experienced at least one of four symptom groups of ASD, 5.5% of the Jewish respondents and 20.3% of the Arabs met the criteria of ASD. Higher rates of Arab respondents reported symptoms of dissociation, reexperiencing and arousal, but a similar rate of avoidance was reported by the two samples. Higher mean scores of ASS and of symptoms-related impairment were reported by the Arab respondents. According to multiple regression analyses, younger age, female gender, Arab ethnicity and experiencing the war more intensely as a stressor significantly explained ASS variance, while Arab ethnicity and proximity to missiles exploding significantly explained the variance of symptoms-related impairment. A substantial rate of participants experienced symptoms of acute stress, while for only small proportion were the symptoms consistent with ASD. Higher ASD and ASS were reported by the Arab sample, calling attention to the need to build interventions to reduce the present symptoms and to help prepare for possible similar situations in the future.\n\nPrimary and acquired drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains in western region of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\n\nPubMed\n\nElghoul, M T; Joshi, R M; Rizghalla, T\n\n1989-10-01\n\nDrug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains prevalent in the Western Region of Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was studied for the years 1984, 1985 and 1986 at the regional tuberculosis control centre at Gurgi, Tripoli. Records of resistance to streptomycin, isoniazid, ethambutol and rifampicin were analysed. Whereas primary drug resistance was observed in 5.1%, 19.5% and 3.8%, acquired drug resistance was found in 12.2%, 34.0% and 15.3% of the strains in 1984, 1985 and 1986 respectively. Only 3 out of 598 strains (1.2%) were found to show acquired resistance to rifampicin. No primary resistance to rifampicin was observed. The situation of drug resistance in pulmonary tuberculosis in the Jamahiriya is discussed.\n\nValidity and reliability of the Arabic version of the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale in rural Lebanon.\n\nPubMed\n\nNaja, Farah; Hwalla, Nahla; Fossian, Talar; Zebian, Dina; Nasreddine, Lara\n\n2015-02-01\n\nTo assess the validity and reliability of the Arabic version of the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) in rural Lebanon. A cross-sectional study on a sample of households with at least one child aged 0-2 years. In a one-to-one interview, participants completed an adapted Arabic version of the HFIAS. In order to evaluate the validity of the HFIAS, basic sociodemographic information, anthropometric measurements of the mother and child, and dietary intake data of the child were obtained. In order to examine reproducibility, the HFIAS was re-administered after 3 months. Rural Lebanon. Mother and child pairs (n 150). Factor analysis of HFIAS items revealed two factors: 'insufficient food quality' and 'insufficient food quantity'. Using Pearson's correlation, food insecurity was inversely associated with mother's and father's education levels, number of cars and electrical appliances in the household, income, weight-for-age and length-for-age of the child and the child's dietary adequacy. In contrast, mother's BMI and crowding index were positively associated with food insecurity scores (P < 0Â·05 for all correlations). Cronbach's Î± of the scale was 0Â·91. A moderate correlation was observed between the two administrations of the questionnaire (intra-class correlation = 0Â·58; P < 0Â·05). Our findings indicated that the adapted Arabic version of the HFIAS is a valid and reliable tool to assess food insecurity in rural Lebanon, lending further evidence to the utility of the HFIAS in assessing food insecurity in culturally diverse populations.\n\nAging in Lebanon: Challenges and Opportunities\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbdulrahim, Sawsan; Ajrouch, Kristine J.; Antonucci, Toni C.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis spotlight offers a unique window into factors affecting aging in Lebanon. As a bridge between east and west, both geographically and culturally, Lebanon has the fastest growing older adult population in the Arab region, but few societal resources to address its needs. In a country with a history of political instability and war, but also a culture with strong family values, aging adults in Lebanon are vulnerable in some ways and advantaged in others. Outmigration of youth is an important determinant of the wellbeing of the elderly. While often advantaged by remittances sent by their children, older Lebanese adults have less access to instrumental social and personal support previously provided by young adults in the family. How Lebanon manages these challenges is likely to foreshadow the future aging experience for much of the Arab region. PMID:25326343\n\nLebanon.\n\nPubMed\n\n1988-04-01\n\nGeneral notes about Lebanon are presented: political history, government, population, geography, economy and foreign relations. Lebanon lies on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, and is composed of a coastal plain bound on the east by high mountains. The population numbers about 2.5 million, although no census has been taken since 1932. 6 different types of Christian sects and 3 of Muslims contribute to instability. The strife has been aggravated by invasions by Israel against Palestinians encamped there, and by Syria as part of an Arab peace-keeping force. Despite constant civil war since the 1950s, the Lebanese government has continued to function, a parliamentary constitutional system with a judicial system based on the Napoleonic code. Amendments to the 1926 constitution have mandated that representation in the National Assembly and among top government positions be apportioned based on distribution of significant religious groups. Political parties in Lebanon are extremely complex, and include parties loyal to clan or local leaders, those ranging from the right to left, those resembling Arab parties in other nations, and those dedicated to religious sects. The economy is normally based on agriculture, and on commerce and banking in the primary coastal cities, but is in decline currently.\n\nAging in Lebanon: Challenges and Opportunities.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdulrahim, Sawsan; Ajrouch, Kristine J; Antonucci, Toni C\n\n2015-08-01\n\nThis spotlight offers a unique window into factors affecting aging in Lebanon.

We contribute to this debate through a series of studies in which we investigated personality descriptors in Modern Standard Arabic, the variety of Arabic that is presumably common to about 26 countries and native to more than 200 million people. We identified an appropriate source of personality descriptors, extracted them, and systematically reduced them to 167 personality traits that are common, are not redundant with each other, and are familiar and commonly understood in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and the West Bank (Palestinian territories). We then analyzed self- and peer ratings (Nâ=â806) and identified a six-factor solution comprising Morality (I), Conscientiousness (II), Positive Emotionality (III), Dominance (IV), Agreeableness/Righteousness (V), and Emotional Stability (VI) without replicating an Openness factor. The factors were narrower or broader variants of factors found in the Big Five and HEXACO models. Conceptual and methodological considerations may have impacted the factor structure.

We translated the S-LANSS into Arabic and evaluated its reliability and linguistic validity for use by Libyan people. Thirteen of 45 Libyan nationals living in the UK were identified as having chronic pain and completed an English and Arabic S-LANSS 1 week apart. In addition, 23 of 104 respondents to a telephone interview in Derna City, Libya, were identified as having chronic pain and completed the Arabic S-LANSS. Seven of these 23 completed the S-LANSS again 1 week later. Cronbach's alpha was 0.72 (P < 0.001) for the Arabic S-LANSS and 0.71 (P < 0.001) for the English S-LANSS. There was good measurement of agreement of individual items in Arabic and English S-LANSS tools with kappa coefficients ranging from 0.69 to 1.00. Twelve of the 23 (52.2%) individuals with chronic pain scored 12 or more on the Arabic S-LANSS and were classified as possibly having neuropathic pain. There was good measurement of agreement of individual items in Arabic S-LANSS tools with kappa coefficients ranging from 0.462 to 1.00. There were strong intraclass correlations in both versions for test-retest reliability of total score. The Arabic S-LANSS is reliable and linguistically valid to use in Libya. Our translation of the S-LANSS into Arabic was shown to be linguistically valid and reliable for use in a Libyan population. Â© 2012 The Authors.

Publications on mental health in 21 Arab countries from 1966 to 2006 were screened using PubMed and Psychinfo. Data were collected and analyzed for Arab authors and affiliations, publication year, topic and type of journal. In 40 years (1966-2005), the Arab world published 2,213 articles on a vast variety of topics, most common being mood, anxiety and substance use disorders, and mostly in international journals. By the last decade, the total yearly publications increased about eightfold since the first two decades, and nearly doubled from the third one. The disparity of output was high across countries. The highest yearly output was from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Lebanon. Per million population, the top four producing countries were Kuwait, Bahrain, Lebanon and United Arab Emirates. Over a decade, the Arab world produced approximately 17% of the global output of mental health publications/million population and was comparative to Latin American and Caribbean countries. There is a wide gap in comparison with the industrialized world, with a fertile ground for cross-cultural and genetic studies.\n\nWar Memories and the Refusal of Male Dominance in Shakir's \"Oh, Lebanon\"\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAl-Momani, Hassan Ali Abdullah\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis study investigates the role of the war memories in the construction of the female gender identity in Evelyin Shakir's \"Oh, Lebanon,\" in which the female protagonist refuses to belong to her Arab identity when she lives in the United States because of the brutal war memories she witnesses in Lebanon.

Yet, social inequalities have received little attention in the expanding field of tobacco research in the Arab region. In this study, we examine inequalities in cigarette smoking by education and wealth in four Arab countries. Utilizing the most recently available population-level data sets (Syria 2009 PAPFAM, Jordan 2012 DHS, Palestine 2010 Family Health Survey, and Lebanon 2004 PAPFAM), we tested the association between cigarette smoking and education and wealth-controlling for age, marital status, and region of residence-for each country, and among men and women depending on data availability. Cigarette smoking prevalence among Arab men is high- 51.3% in Syria, 39.7% in Palestine, and 42.1% in Lebanon; among women, prevalence is 8.4% in Syria, 10.9% in Jordan, and 24.3% Lebanon. Cigarette smoking shows the expected patterns inequalities by education among men in Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon, and among women in Jordan and Lebanon. On the other hand, wealth does not show a clear pattern in its association with cigarette smoking and, in some cases (men in Palestine and women in Syria) the behavioral risk is higher among the wealthiest. Available data from 2004-2012 show that cigarette smoking among men and women in the four Arab countries is predominant among those with limited access to education as a fundamental cause. The weak or absent negative association between wealth and cigarette smoking suggests that access to material resources does not precipitate a reduction in the consumption of tobacco.\n\nThe population, environment, and health nexus: an Arab world perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nKulczycki, A; Saxena, P C\n\n1998-01-01\n\nThis report describes models of the links between population growth, environmental degradation, and health in Arab countries and in the world; management of the commons; urbanization and water as critical issues; and challenges in Lebanon. It is concluded that the complexity of interrelationships is difficult to untangle. Researchers frequently neglect health issues in modeling the relationships. The lack of attention to the health, development, and environment nexus has serious implications in the Middle East and North Africa. In Lebanon, national strategies do not include a national waste management strategy based on reduction, reuse, and recycling. Most Arab countries face the major issue of the lack of adequate planning in many economic sectors, which results in imbalances in supply and demand. Most Arab countries do not have adequate statistical databases upon which to base development, planning, and policy-making. The last census in Lebanon was in 1932. Information is missing on health. Health economics are ignored. It is not possible to estimate the health costs due to deficiencies in sanitation, hygiene, water, and air quality. Capacity building for environmental management and intersectoral collaboration is hampered. Arab countries with large oil reserves have ignored the population and environment links. Poorer countries will suffer the most from limited renewable water resources and their decline due to population growth. The political agenda in Arab countries should give priority to health, environment, development, and population issues.\n\nSocioeconomic differences in smoking in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine: A cross-sectional analysis of national surveys\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbdulrahim, Sawsan\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIntroduction The association between education and wealth, as fundamental determinants of health, and smoking is well-established.

All the patients received oral prednisone, in addition the following treatments were used: pulse intravenous (i.v.) cyclophosphamide (n = 23, 46%); azathioprine (n = 22, 44%); pulse i.v. steroids (n = 19, 38%); chloroquine sulfate (n = 17, 34%); methotrexate (n = 5, 10%); and plasmapheresis (n = 2, 4%). The median duration of follow-up was 5 y (range 1-33 y). On their last evaluation, out of 37 patients who were followed, 20 patients (54%) had controlled disease, eight patients (22%) were still on active medical treatment, four patients (11%) were on chronic hemodialysis, and five patients (13%) had died. Unlike three other Arab populations studies from Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, where the most frequent histopathologic abnormality was class III, diffuse proliferative LN (class IV) was the most common type of lupus nephritis in Lebanon, similarly to reports from USA, France, Netherlands, South Africa, Thailand and Taiwan.\n\nAn Arab NATO in the Making Middle Eastern Military Cooperation Since 2011\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2016-09-01\n\nwith a focus on strategy and security.

At present, modern scientific publishing in the Arab world is in its developmental stage. Arab biomedical journals are less than 300, most of which are published in Egypt, Lebanon, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Yet, many of these journals do not have on-line access or are indexed in major bibliographic databases. The majority of indexed journals, however, do not have a stable presence in the popular PubMed database and their indexes are discontinued since 2001. The exposure of Arab biomedical journals in international indices undoubtedly plays an important role in improving the scientific quality of these journals. The successful examples discussed in this review encourage us to call for the formation of a consortium of Arab biomedical journal publishers to assist in redressing the balance of the region from biomedical data consumption to data production.\n\nGender role expectations of pain mediate sex differences in cold pain responses in healthy Libyans.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlabas, O A; Tashani, O A; Johnson, M I\n\n2012-02-01\n\nPrevious studies found a relationship between response to experimentally-induced pain and scores for the gender role expectations of pain (GREP) questionnaire. Findings were similar in individuals from America, Portugal and Israel suggesting that gender role expectations may be universal. The aim of this study was to translate and validate Arabic GREP using Factor Analysis and to investigate if sex differences to cold-pressor pain in healthy Libyan men and women are mediated through stereotypical social constructs of gender role expectations and/or pain-related anxiety. One hundred fourteen university students (58 women) underwent two cycles of cold pressor pain test to measure pain threshold, tolerance, intensity, and unpleasantness. Participants also completed the Arabic GREP questionnaire and the Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale-Short form (PASS-20). It was found that Libyan men had higher pain thresholds and tolerances than women (mean difference, 95% CI: thresholdâ=â4.69â(s), -0.72 to 10.1, pâ=â0.005; toleranceâ=â13.46â(s), 0.5-26.4, pâ=â0.018). There were significant differences between sexes in 6 out of 12 GREP items (pâ<â0.004 after Bonferonni adjustment). The results of mediational analysis showed that GREP factors were the mediators of the effects of sex on pain threshold (zâ=â-2.452, pâ=â0.014 for Self Sensitivity); (zâ=â-2.563, pâ=â0.01, for Self Endurance) and on pain tolerance (zâ=â-2.538, pâ=â0.01 for Self Endurance). In conclusion, sex differences in response to pain were mediated by gender role expectations of pain but not pain-related anxiety.

To start the planning process to re-engineer the health sector, the Libyan Ministry of Health in collaboration with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other international experts in the field sponsored the National Health Systems Conference in Tripoli, Libya, between the 26th and the 30th of August 2012. The aim of this conference was to study how health systems function at the international arena and to facilitate a consultative process between 500 Libyan health experts in order to identify the problems within the Libyan health system and propose potential solutions. The scientific programme adopted the WHO health care system framework and used its six system building blocks: i) Health Governance; ii) Health Care Finance; iii) Health Service Delivery; iv) Human Resources for Health; v) Pharmaceuticals and Health Technology; and vi) Health Information System. The experts used a structured approach starting with clarifying the concepts, evaluating the current status of that health system block in Libya, thereby identifying the strengths, weaknesses, and major deficiencies. This article summarises the 500 health expert recommendations that seized the opportunity to map a modern health systems to take the Libyan health sector into the 21st century.

A cross-sectional study was undertaken with 322 individuals, using the CANE, the EQ5d and a socio-demographic questionnaire. Reliability was determined through measuring internal consistency of the CANE. Construct validity was performed through examining CANE inter-item correlations, and comparing correlations with the EQ5d and socio-demographic indicators. A factor analysis was conducted using varimax orthogonal rotation. Cronbach alpha was 0.71. For construct validity, correlations were highest in items measuring needs in looking after the house and food (r = 0.557); company and intimate relationships (r = 0.572); and medication and written/verbal information (r = 0.586). Moderate correlations were found with EQ5d items assessing the same measure, including: EQ5d 'problems taking care of self' and CANE self-care (r = 0.578) and daytime activities (r = 0.523); EQ5d 'problems performing usual activities' and CANE daytime activities (r = 0.553), self-care (r = 0.511) and mobility (r = 0.500); and EQ5d 'problems while walking' and CANE mobility/falls (r = 0.509). Corresponding items of the CANE and EQ-5d were significantly correlated with similar socio-demographic variables. The factor analysis supported results obtained in the CANE inter-item correlations. The Arabic version of the CANE appears acceptable in assessing needs of older adults in South Lebanon. Given that the CANE is an interesting tool that promotes the integration of older persons' perspectives for appropriate interventions, further research is recommended to establish its validity and applicability in other communities in Lebanon and the region.\n\nA Comparative Assessment of Higher Education Financing in Six Arab Countries\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEl-Araby, Ashraf\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis study analyses the policies for financing higher education in six Arab countries: Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, and Tunisia.

The surveys used a cluster-randomized sampling design. The 2 food security subscales underwent face and construct validity. In addition, both of these tools and the AFFSS underwent psychometric assessment for internal validity by using statistical methods based on Item Response Theory. The food security questions tested by focus groups were understood and accepted in all regions of Lebanon. The food security subscales and the AFFSS had acceptable levels of internal consistency. The psychometric assessment confirmed that the 7 items of the AFFSS had good internal validity and reasonable reliability with item in-fits from 0.73 to 1.16. Food insecurity was identified among 42% of southern Lebanese and 62% of Palestinian refugee households. The determinants and consequences of food security measured in this study provide additional support for the validity of the modules. Using multivariate logistic regression, the higher the mean monthly income per household member and the higher the educational attainment of the head of household, the lower the risk of food insecurity [ORs (95% CIs): 0.99 (0.98, 0.99) and 0.66 (0.54, 0.80), respectively]. There was a strong significant association between food insecurity and lower food expenditure and lower intake of all food categories except for legumes, which was significantly associated in the opposite direction (P < 0.001). The odds of borrowing money and accepting gifts/donations were significantly higher among moderately and severely food-insecure households (P < 0.000). The AFFSS has been validated within Lebanon and can potentially be extended to other Arab-speaking populations.\n\nDirectory of Early Childhood Care and Education Organizations in the Arab States.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, Paris (France).\n\nThe care and education of children is a primary task of all societies, and the role of parents, families, and communities is essential in this process.

However, no national studies have been conducted to assess this assumption in the Arab world. Methods: As part of the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative, a nationally representative psychiatric epidemiological survey of n = 2857 adults (ages 18+) was carried out in Lebanon (the Lebanese Evaluation of the Burden of Ailments and Needs Of the Nation: LEBANON). Twelve-month prevalence and severity of DSM-IV disorders and treatment were assessed with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, Version 3.0). Information was also obtained about socio-demographics and exposure to traumatic events in the Lebanon wars. Findings: One-sixth (17.0%) of respondents met criteria for at least one 12-month DSM-IV/CIDI disorder, 27.0% of whom were classified serious and an additional 36.0% moderate. Nearly half of respondents had a history of exposure to war-related traumatic events. Significantly elevated odd-ratios (OR) of mood, anxiety and impulse-control disorders were associated with two (OR = 2.0-3.6) or more (OR = 2.2-9.1) war-related traumatic events, resulting in substantially higher proportions of moderate or severe 12-month mental disorders among respondents exposed to multiple war-related traumata (16.8-20.4%) than other respondents (3.3-3.5%). Only 10.9% of respondents with 12-month disorders obtained treatment. Two-thirds of treatment was provided in the general medical sector. Interpretation: Mental disorders are common in Lebanon. Prevalence is similar to WMH surveys in Western Europe. Unmet need for treatment is considerably higher in Lebanon than in Western countries. PMID:16564362\n\nThe Arabic scale of death anxiety: some results from east and west.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdel-Khalek, Ahmed M; Lester, David; Maltby, John; TomÃ¡s-SÃ¡bado, Joaquin\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe twofold objectives of the present study were (a) to examine sex-related differences on the Arabic Scale of Death Anxiety (ASDA) in seven Arabic and Western countries, and (b) to compare the mean ASDA scores among Arabic samples (Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Syria) with Western samples (Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). A total sample of 2978 volunteer undergraduates participated in this study. They resided in their countries of origin and responded to the scale in their respective native-speaking languages. Sex-related differences on the ASDA were statistically significant in all countries (except the United Kingdom), with women having higher mean scores than their male peers. It was found that all the Arab samples, except the Lebanese men, had significantly higher mean ASDA scores than their Western counterparts. These differences might be explained either in the light of higher emotionally responsiveness of the Arab samples, differences in individualism and collectivism and in secularism in the countries, and the lower per capita income in the Arab countries except in Kuwait.\n\nPerceived Environmental Factors Associated with Obesity in Libyan Men and Women\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPapadopoulos, Chris\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBackground: There is a lack of research pertaining to the links between built environment attributes and obesity in adults in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. In the Libyan context, no previous studies have been conducted to investigate this relationship. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine associations between perceived neighbourhood built environmental attributes and obesity among Libyan men and women. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was also assessed. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used for the population-based survey in Benghazi, Libya. A multi-stage cluster sampling technique was used to select Libyan adults from the Benghazi electoral register. The Physical Activity Neighbourhood Environment Scale (PANES) was used to measure participantsâ perception of neighbourhood environmental factors. Using the Tanita BC-601 Segmental Body Composition Monitor and a portable stadiometer, anthropometric measurements were taken at a mutually agreeable place by qualified nurses. Results: Four hundred and one Libyan adults were recruited (78% response rate). Participants were aged 20â65 years, 63% were female, and all had lived in Benghazi for over 10 years. The prevalence of obesity and overweight was 42.4% and 32.9% respectively. A significant association was found between BMI and 6 neighbourhood environment attributes, specifically: street connectivity, unsafe environment and committing crimes at night, and neighbourhood aesthetics. For men only, these were: access to public transport, access to recreational facilities, and unsafe environment and committing crimes during the day. The attribute âresidential density zonesâ was only significant for women. Conclusions: The study suggests that Libyan people are at risk of living in neighbourhoods with unsupportive environmental features of physical activity, which are likely to promote obesity of both genders. The findings of this study could inform Libyan health policies about\n\nContextual and Pedagogical Considerations in Teaching for Forgiveness in the Arab World\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNasser, Ilham; Abu-Nimer, Mohammed; Mahmoud, Ola\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis study was conducted among Arab teachers in four countries in the Middle East (Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and Palestine) to examine their views and methods on teaching for forgiveness in their classrooms.

The present meta-analysis included 100 populations from 36 Arab and non-Arab communities, comprising 16,006 individuals, and evaluates the genetic profile of Arabs using HLA class I (A, B) and class II (DRB1, DQB1) genes. A total of 56 Arab populations comprising 10,283 individuals were selected from several databases, and were compared with 44 Mediterranean, Asian, and sub-Saharan populations. The most frequent alleles in Arabs are A*01, A*02, B*35, B*51, DRB1*03:01, DRB1*07:01, DQB1*02:01, and DQB1*03:01, while DRB1*03:01-DQB1*02:01 and DRB1*07:01-DQB1*02:02 are the most frequent class II haplotypes. Dendrograms, correspondence analyses, genetic distances, and haplotype analysis indicate that Arabs could be stratified into four groups. The first consists of North Africans (Algerians, Tunisians, Moroccans, and Libyans), and the first Arabian Peninsula cluster (Saudis, Kuwaitis, and Yemenis), who appear to be related to Western Mediterraneans, including Iberians; this might be explained for a massive migration into these areas when Sahara underwent a relatively rapid desiccation, starting about 10,000 years BC. The second includes Levantine Arabs (Palestinians, Jordanians, Lebanese, and Syrians), along with Iraqi and Egyptians, who are related to Eastern Mediterraneans. The third comprises Sudanese and Comorians, who tend to cluster with Sub-Saharans. The fourth comprises the second Arabian Peninsula cluster, made up of Omanis, Emiratis, and Bahrainis. It is noteworthy that the two large minorities (Berbers and Kurds) are indigenous (autochthonous), and are not genetically different from âhostâ and neighboring populations. In conclusion, this study confirmed high genetic heterogeneity among present-day Arabs, and especially those of the Arabian Peninsula.

This study aimed at analyzing its epidemiology in the country over time. Methods: Data were extracted from the Lebanese National Cancer Registry (NCR) for the years 2004 through 2010. Age-standardized and age-specific incidence rates for cancers per 100,000 population were calculated. Results: Breast cancer ranked first, accounting for an average of 37.6% of all new female cancer cases in Lebanon during the period of 2004-2010. Breast cancer was found to have been increasing faster than other hormone-related womenâs cancers (i.e. of the ovaries and corpus uteri). The breast cancer age-standardized incidence rates (world population) (ASRw) increased steadily from 2004 (71.0) to 2010 (105.9), making the burden comparable to that in developed countries, reflecting the influence of sociological and reproductive patterns transitioning from regional norms to global trends. The age-specific incidence rates for breast cancer rose steeply from around age 35-39 years, to reach a first peak in the age group 45-49 years, and then dropped slightly between 50 and 64 years to rise again thereafter and reach a second peak in the 75+ age group. Five-year age-specific rates among Lebanese women between 35 and 49 years were among the highest observed worldwide in 2008. Conclusion: Breast cancer is continuously on the rise in Lebanon. The findings of this study support the national screening recommendation of starting breast cancer screening at the age of 40 years. It is mandatory to conduct an in-depth analysis of contributing factors and develop consequently a comprehensive National Breast Cancer Control strategy.

Lebanon is ranked as a zone of moderate endemicity. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B and C in Lebanon and their distribution according to age, region and sex. This national prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2011 till December 2012 in the six Lebanese Governorates in collaboration with municipalities, the Ministry of Public Health, Health Centres and dispensaries. An upcoming screening for hepatitis B and C was announced? in different districts of each Governorate. All individuals presenting to local laboratory, not known to have chronic hepatitis, were asked for a blood sample and answered a questionnaire addressing sex, age, place of birth and residence. Screening tests were \"Abbots\" for hepatitis B and \"Human Hexagon\" for hepatitis C. PCR testing was used to confirm the positivity of the previous tests. Of 31147 individuals screened, 542 had a rapid test positive for HBV (prevalence 1.74%, 95% CI 1.6-1.89) with a male to female ratio of 1.08. This prevalence was higher in the South and Nabatieh (1.9%) compared to Beirut (0.73%). Of 31,147 individuals screened, 64 had a rapid test positive for HCV (prevalence 0.21%, 95% CI 0.16-0.27) with a male to female ratio of 0.85. This prevalence was higher in Nabatieh (0.61%) compared to Mount Lebanon (0.08%). The prevalence of HBV and HCV in Lebanon is 1.74% and 0.21%, respectively with a higher prevalence in South and Nabatieh districts. These data rank Lebanon amongst countries with low endemicity for both viruses. Decrease in the prevalence of HBV is due to awareness campaign as well as success of the MOPH National Hepatitis Program in vaccinating all new born since 1998 and in screening and vaccinating high risk groups.

Materials and methods We retrieved and analyzed 2190 case notes and biopsy records of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and the Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology, Al Arab Medical Sciences University, Benghazi, Libya, dating from January 1990 to December 2005. There were 326 cases (14.8%) of diagnosed odontogenic cysts among the 2190 biopsies performed during this period. The cases were analyzed for age and sex distribution, site of presentation, association with impacted teeth, and the method of treatment. Results The male to female ratio of patients was 1.3:1 Radicular cysts accounted for 222 cases (68.1%), followed by dentigerous cysts (n=49, 15%) and odontogenic keratocysts (n=43, 14.1%). Mean ages of the patients were, respectively, 31.7, 22.7 and 36.1 years. The maxilla was more commonly involved than the mandible (1.3:1). The anterior maxilla was the commonest site (n=132, 37.4%) followed by the posterior mandible (n=96, 29.4%). Fifty three cases were associated with impacted teeth, and the highest frequency was for dentigerous cysts (n=37). Enucleation and curettage was performed on 300 patients, marsupialization on 14, and marginal/segmental resection on 12. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first such study on a Libyan population. Our results are comparable to studies from other countries. Knowledge of the relative frequencies and sites of presentation of odontogenic cysts in different ethno-geographic backgrounds is essential for the early diagnosis and management of these benign yet potentially destructive lesions.

Important among the manifestations of this concern is the use of residue gas from a processing plant for injection into an oil-producing reservoir. The miscible drive created by the gas will increase ultimate recovery, and the processing plant recovers LP gas and condensate for sale. Following discovery of the 103-A in 1967, Occidental moved quickly to install production equipment and a 40-in. pipeline to Zueitina, 135 miles distant on the Mediterranean. By Feb. 1968, the firstmoreÂ Â» oil was loaded into tankers. Discovery of C and D fields in the 103 concession followed shortly. The three 103 fields plus an original discovery in the 102 concession increased Occidental's oil rate to more than 700,000 bpd by 1970. Facilities in the Intisar A and D fields each consist of a centralized separator system containing 3 stages of separation, plus degassing boots and surge tanks. The terminal at Zueitina includes 8,000,000 bbl of oil storage. The gas processing, the products pipeline, and other aspects of the industrial plant are discussed in detail.Â«Â less\n\nFaculty research productivity in six Arab countries\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAbouchedid, Kamal; Abdelnour, George\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThis article analyses the research output of a sample of higher education institutions (HEIs) in six Arab countries in order to start quantifying academic research productivity in the wider region of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). A questionnaire classifying HEIs was administered to 310 institutions in Lebanon, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. The study revealed a lack of capacity of HEIs to provide quality data, raising issues concerning institutional excellence and transparency. Those data which were available were analysed using a number of statistical methods. The result is that faculty research output in the Arab world is relatively low, confirming the existing notion of a lagging knowledge sector in the region. While traditional scholarship has focused on institutional factors such as budgetary allocation as one prime determinant of research productivity, this study claims that other factors need to be considered in explaining the low output, with broad implications for policy formulation. Such factors include overall satisfaction levels of academic staff, socialisation of faculty staff members into a research climate, and university mission vis-Ã -vis academic research. Given the distinct paucity of studies on faculty research productivity in HEIs in the Arab region, this study seeks to bridge this gap in the literature by providing original data derived from six Arab countries. The authors aim to provide a basis for further research into this topic.\n\nSociolinguistic reflection on neuropsychological assessment: an insight into selected culturally adapted battery of Lebanese Arabic cognitive testing.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbou-Mrad, Fadi; Tarabey, Lubna; Zamrini, Edward; Pasquier, Florence; Chelune, Gordon; Fadel, Patricia; Hayek, Maryse\n\n2015-10-01\n\nNeuropsychological tests (NPTs) are highly dependent on education, culture differences as well as age and sex. It is therefore essential to take these factors into consideration when translating NPTs to be used in screening for cognitive impairment. Translations into Arabic must respect the principles of linguistic relativity and cultural specificity of the population under study. The objective is to assess feasibility and outcome of translating neuropsychological tests to Arabic. A team of Lebanese professionals selected a battery of screening NPTs. These tests were translated into Arabic and independently back translated by a team of sociolinguists and cultural specialists. The translations were adapted to suit the Lebanese culture. The final NPT translated versions were reached by consensus of an expert panel and tested on a group of independently living community-dwelling elderly. Translated items had to be modified when: (1) terms could not be translated using one word as required by the test; (2) Concepts were foreign to the culture; (3) Translated words carried multiple meanings; (4) Words were rarely used in Lebanon; (5) Sentences did not have an equivalent; and (6) Words had letters pronounced differently by subgroups in Lebanon. Despite all measures to maintain cultural sensitivity in translations, non-linguistic challenges remained. A battery of cognitive screening tests were translated into Arabic and adapted for the Lebanese population. These adaptations allow for a better assessment of cognitive abilities since they reflect the thought patterns of the population. The challenge is to establish local normative data.\n\nEpidemiology and clinical characteristics of traumatic brain injury in Lebanon\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbou-Abbass, Hussein; Bahmad, Hisham; Ghandour, Hiba; Fares, Jawad; Wazzi-Mkahal, Rayyan; Yacoub, Basel; Darwish, Hala; Mondello, Stefania; Harati, Hayat; El Sayed, Mazen J.; Tamim, Hani; Kobeissy, Firas\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a debilitating medical and emerging public health problem that is affecting people worldwide due to a multitude of factors including both domestic and war-related acts. The objective of this paper is to systematically review the status of TBI in Lebanon â a Middle Eastern country with a weak health system that was chartered by several wars and intermittent outbursts of violence - in order to identify the present gaps in knowledge, direct future research initiatives and to assist policy makers in planning progressive and rehabilitative policies. Methods: OVID/Medline, PubMed, Scopus databases and Google Scholar were lastly searched on April 15th, 2016 to identify all published research studies on TBI in Lebanon. Studies published in English, Arabic or French that assessed Lebanese patients afflicted by TBI in Lebanon were warranting inclusion in this review. Case reports, reviews, biographies and abstracts were excluded. Throughout the whole review process, reviewers worked independently and in duplicate during study selection, data abstraction and methodological assessment using the Downs and Black Checklist. Results: In total, 11 studies were recognized eligible as they assessed Lebanese patients afflicted by TBI on Lebanese soils. Considerable methodological variation was found among the identified studies. All studies, except for two that evaluated domestic causes such as falls, reported TBI due to war-related injuries. Age distribution of TBI victims revealed two peaks, young adults between 18 and 40 years, and older adults aged 60 years and above, where males constituted the majority. Only three studies reported rates of mild TBI. Mortality, rehabilitation and systemic injury rates were rarely reported and so were the complications involved; infections were an exception. Conclusion: Apparently, status of TBI in Lebanon suffers from several gaps which need to be bridged through implementing more basic\n\nKnowledge, attitudes, and practices of argileh (water pipe or hubble-bubble) and cigarette smoking among pregnant women in Lebanon.\n\nPubMed\n\nChaaya, M; Jabbour, S; El-Roueiheb, Z; Chemaitelly, H\n\n2004-12-01\n\nCurrently, little is known about argileh (water pipe or hubble-bubble) and cigarette smoking among pregnant women in the Arab world, despite emerging evidence on the adverse health effects of argileh smoking and well-established knowledge about the health risks of cigarette smoking during pregnancy. The present study assesses pregnant Arab women's knowledge of chemical contents and related harmful effects of argileh and cigarettes, their attitudes towards smoking argileh and cigarettes, and their actual smoking of argileh and cigarettes, both before and during pregnancy. A stratified sample of 864 women from 23 health care centers in Lebanon completed a structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire. Information was collected on basic demographic variables, women's knowledge, attitudes, and cigarette and argileh smoking. Women were partially knowledgeable about the health risks of cigarette smoking, knew little about the harmful ingredients of argileh smoking, and had many misconceptions regarding how argileh worked or how it can produce harm. Attitudes were permissive towards all forms of smoking. Almost one quarter (23%) of participants reported smoking during pregnancy, with 17% smoking only cigarettes, 4% smoking only argileh, and 1.5% smoking both cigarette and argileh. A significant and growing percentage of pregnant Arab women are smoking in Lebanon, with four cigarette smokers for every argileh smoker. Smoking behaviors are empirically linked with important gaps in knowledge and with permissive attitudes. These data may be used to design more effective prevention programs targeting this vulnerable population.\n\nLibyan nationalizations: TOPCO/CALASIATIC vs Libya arbitration\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nVon Mehren, R.B.; Kourides, P.N.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nNine international oil companies operating in Libya were informed in 1973 and early 1974 that their interests and properties would be nationalized. This event followed four years after a military takeover of the Libyan government by Colonel Muammar el-Qadhafi, whose actions led to a major international arbitration. This article describes the background of the Libyan nationalization, the steps toward arbitration, the arbitration proceeding, the awards of the Sole Arbitrator, and the significance of those awards. The TOPCO/CALASIATIC vs Libya arbitration not only provides an excellent example of the process of arbitration, but also it confirms the effectiveness of the processmoreÂ Â» in leading to eventual settlement of the dispute. Basic fundamental principles of law were considered, articulated, and reaffirmed throughout the process, adding percedent to the small body of international case law. 38 references.Â«Â less\n\nPolymorphisms of the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene among the Libyan population\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZeglam, Hamza Ben; Benhamer, Abdrazak; Aboud, Adel; Rtemi, Haitem; Mattardi, Meftah; Saleh, Saleh Suleiman; Bashein, Abdullah; Enattah, Nabil\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyses the S-methylation of 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine. Low activity phenotypes are correlated with polymorphism in the TPMT gene. Patients with low or undetectable TMPT activity could develop severe myelosuppression when they are treated with standard doses of thiopurine drugs. Since ethnic differences in the TPMT gene polymorphism have been demonstrated worldwide, assessing it in the Libyan population is worthwhile. Methods We investigated TPMT gene polymorphism in a total of 246 Libyan healthy adult blood donors from three different Libyan regions (Tripoli, Yefren, and Tawargha) and 50 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We used polymerase chain reaction restriction length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and allele-specific PCR-based assays to analyse the TPMT gene for the variants *2 c.238 G>C, *3A (c.460 G>A and c.719 A>G), *3B (c.460 G>A), and *3C (c.719 A>G). Results Our results show that the TPMT variants associated with low enzymatic activity were detected in 3.25% (8 in 246) of adult Libyan individuals and the frequency of total mutant alleles was 1.63%. Heterozygous genotypes were TPMT*3A in three subjects (0.61%) and TPMT*3C in five subjects (1.02%). No TPMT*2 and TPMT*3B allelic variants and no homozygous or compound heterozygous mutant alleles were detected. The normal allele (wild-type) was found in 98.4% of the adult individuals studied. No mutant alleles were detected among the 50 children who had ALL. Conclusions We report on the presence of the TPMT*3C and *3A mutant alleles in the Libyan population. Therefore, monitoring the patients to be treated with doses of thiopurine drugs for TPMT variants is worthwhile to avoid the development of severe myelosuppression.

We further explored the role of ethnicity, gender and age in explaining psychological distress and the ways in which different coping strategies relate to health outcomes in the two ethnic groups. Data were gathered from 303 Israeli adolescents (231 Jews and 72 Arabs), 12-19 years old, who filled out self-reported questionnaires among which were demographics; Adolescent Coping Scale, Scale of Psychological Distress (SPD), state anxiety and state anger. Both Jewish and Arab adolescents mostly used \"problem solving\" coping strategies and reported relatively low levels of psychological distress. Similarities among Jews and Arabs were indicated in the use of \"problem solving\" coping strategies but not in the use of \"reference to others\"--and \"non-productive\" coping strategies. Significant but small effects were indicated for gender and interaction of ethnicity and age on \"psychological distress.\" The coping strategies explained only 35% of the variance of stress reactions for the Jewish group but 51% for the Arab group. The results are discussed against the background of an interactionist approach, considering coping as a function of interaction between the stressful war event and the individual-cultural background.\n\nUnderstanding the risk and protective factors associated with obesity amongst Libyan adults - a qualitative study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLemamsha, H; Papadopoulos, C; Randhawa, G\n\n2018-04-13\n\nThere are a range of multifaceted behavioural and societal factors that combine to contribute to the causes of obesity. However, it is not yet known how particularly countries' cultural norms are contributing to the global obesity epidemic. Despite obesity reaching epidemic proportions in Libya, since the discovery of oil in 1959, there is a lack of information about obesity in Libyan adults. This study sought to explore the views of key informants about the risk and protective factors associated with obesity among Libyan men and women. A series of qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with Libyan healthcare professionals and community leaders. Eleven main themes (risk and protective factors) were identified, specifically: socio-demographic and biological factors, socioeconomic status, unhealthy eating behaviours, knowledge about obesity, social-cultural influences, Libya's healthcare facilities, physical activity and the effect of the neighbourhood environment, sedentary behaviour, Libyan food-subsidy policy, and suggestions for preventing and controlling obesity. Key recommendations are that an electronic healthâinformation system needs to be implemented and awareness about obesity and its causes and consequences needs to be raised among the public in order to dispel the many myths and misconceptions held by Libyans about obesity. The current political instability within Libya is contributing to a less-active lifestyle for the population due to security concerns and the impact of curfews. Our findings have implications for Libyan health policy and highlight the urgent need for action towards mitigating against the obesity epidemic in Libya.\n\nMaternal mortality ratio in Lebanon in 2008: a hospital-based reproductive age mortality study (RAMOS).\n\nPubMed\n\nHobeika, Elie; Abi Chaker, Samer; Harb, Hilda; Rahbany Saad, Rita; Ammar, Walid; Adib, Salim\n\n2014-01-01\n\nInternational agencies have recently assigned Lebanon to the group H of countries with \"no national data on maternal mortality,\" and estimated a corresponding maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of 150 per 100,000 live births. The Ministry of Public Health addressed the discrepancy perceived between the reality of the maternal mortality ratio experience in Lebanon and the international report by facilitating a hospital-based reproductive age mortality study, sponsored by the World Health Organization Representative Office in Lebanon, aiming at providing an accurate estimate of a maternal mortality ratio for 2008. The survey allowed a detailed analysis of maternal causes of deaths. Reproductive age deaths (15-49 years) were initially identified through hospital records. A trained MD traveled to each hospital to ascertain whether recorded deaths were in fact maternal deaths or not. ICD10 codes were provided by the medical controller for each confirmed maternal deaths. There were 384 RA death cases, of which 13 were confirmed maternal deaths (339%) (numerator). In 2008, there were 84823 live births in Lebanon (denominator). The MMR in Lebanon in 2008 was thus officially estimated at 23/100,000 live births, with an \"uncertainty range\" from 153 to 30.6. Hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, with double the frequency of all other causes (pregnancy-induced hypertension, eclampsia, infection, and embolism). This specific enquiry responded to a punctual need to correct a clearly inadequate report, and it should be relayed by an on-going valid surveillance system. Results indicate that special attention has to be devoted to the management of peri-partum hemorrhage cases.

Several databases (Medline, PubMed, Science Direct, Springer Link, and PsycInfo) were searched using the following two sets of search words: (1) Arab, Jordan, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Libya, Morocco, Algiers, Palestine, Mauritania, Djibouti, Sudan, Comoros, and Somalia; and (2) epilepsy, seizure disorders, and convulsive disorders. Fifty-one studies were conducted in 12 Arab states. Social/emotional, employment, and other problems; knowledge and attitudes; and quality of life (QOL) were the most commonly measured parameters of psychosocial aspects of epilepsy in Arab countries. Results revealed elevated levels of depression and anxiety, a decline in cognitive function, various behavioral problems, sexual dysfunction, and underemployment among persons with epilepsy (PWE). Misconceptions about epilepsy were found to be prevalent. While many studies reported limited knowledge of epilepsy, some studies found an average knowledge. Negative attitudes toward epilepsy were reported in most studies, and moderately positive attitudes were reported in some studies. Finally, PWE showed low overall QOL scores in the majority of studies.

A feasibility study for the interconnection of the electrical networks of the Mashreq Arab countries, sponsored by the Arab Fund, was completed in June 1992. Each country is served by one utility except Saudi Arabia, which is served by four major utilities and some smaller utilities serving remote towns and small load centers. The major utilities are the Saudi consolidated electric Company in the Eastern Province (SCECO East), SCECO Center, SCECO West, and SCECO South. ThesemoreÂ Â» are the ones considered in this study. The Mashreq Arab region has a considerable mix of energy resources. Egypt and Syria have some limited amounts of hydropower resources, and the Arabian Gulf region is abundant in fossil fuel reserves. Owing to the differences in energy production costs, a potential exists for substantial energy trading between electric utilities in the region. The major objective of this project is to study the feasibility of electric energy trading between the Mashreq Arab countries. The basis, assumptions, and methodologies on which this energy trading study is based relate to the results and conclusions arising out of the previous study, power plant characteristics and costs, assumptions on economic parameters, rules for economy energy exchange, etc. This paper presents the basis, methodology, and major findings of the study.Â«Â less\n\nThe Interfaculty Graduate Environmental Sciences Program of the American University of Beirut: An ESD Initiative in the Arab World\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nZurayk, Rami; El-Fadel, Mutasem; Nuwayhid, Iman\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe American University of Beirut's Interfaculty Graduate Environmental Sciences Program was launched in 1997 as a means of addressing salient issues on the environment and development in Lebanon and the Arab World using an interdisciplinary approach.

A search of the MEDLINEÂ® database (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) was undertaken for all cancer-related publications published between January 2000 and December 2013 from seven countries, including Bahrain, Kuwait, Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine and Sudan. A total of 1,773 articles were identified, with a significant increase in yearly publications over time (P <0.005). Only 30.6% of the publications included subjects over the age of 50 years old. There was a dearth of cross-sectional/correlational studies (8.8%), randomised controlled trials (2.4%) and systematic reviews/meta-analyses (1.3%). Research exploring cancer associations mainly considered social and structural determinants of health (27.1%), followed by behavioural risk factors (14.1%), particularly tobacco use. Overall, more cancer research is needed in the Arab world, particularly analytical studies with high-quality evidence and those focusing on older age groups and associations with physical activity and diet.

Little is known about similar problems in developing countries, particularly the Arab region. The goal of this study was to assess the frequency of selected psychiatric problems among college students in two Arab countries: Qatar and Lebanon, and to compare them to the USA. The Healthy Minds Study, an online confidential survey of common psychiatric symptoms designed for college campuses was used. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to screen for major depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to screen for generalized anxiety and the SCOFF questionnaire to screen for eating disorders. Comparisons were made using ANOVA, Chi-Square tests and logistic regressions. A total of 1841 students participated in the study. The rates of depression (PHQ-9ââ¥â12), generalized anxiety (GAD-7ââ¥â10) and eating disorders (SCOFFâ¥3) at the combined Arab universities were 34.6, 36.1 and 20.4% respectively. The corresponding rates in the USA were: 12.8, 15.9 and 6.8% (pâ<â0.001 for all measures). The impact of psychiatric problems on functioning in general and academic performance in particular was more severe in the Arab countries compared to the USA (pâ<â0.001). Independent predictors of psychiatric problems in general included location, female gender, financial difficulties and poor grades. Being religious had a protective association with mental health. The rates of depression, anxiety and eating disorders were significantly higher among college students in Qatar and Lebanon compared to the USA. Additional research is needed to determine whether these results reflect methodological limitations or true differences in psychopathology across these populations. If replicated, the results indicate that the psychiatric problems on college campuses in the USA are a microcosm of a global problem that needs global solutions.\n\nAnalysis of Final Energy Consumption Patterns in 10 Arab Countries\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAl-Hinti, I.; Al-Ghandoor, A.\n\n2009-08-01\n\nThis study presents an analysis of the energy consumption patterns in 10 Arab countries: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria. Commonalities and variations between these countries are discussed and explained through key economic and energy indicators, and the relationship between the overall final energy consumption per capita and the GDP per capita is examined. The distribution of the final energy consumption across different sectors is also analysed, and the patterns of consumption in the industrial, transportation, and residential sectors are discussed with focus on the types of energy consumed, and the main drivers of this consumption. The findings and the conclusions of this study are believed to be beneficial to the national energy policy planners in identifying possible strengths, weaknesses, and areas of emphasis and improvement in their strategic energy plans.\n\nBioremediation potential of diesel-contaminated Libyan soil.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoshlaf, Eman; Shahsavari, Esmaeil; Aburto-Medina, Arturo; Taha, Mohamed; Haleyur, Nagalakshmi; Makadia, Tanvi H; Morrison, Paul D; Ball, Andrew S\n\n2016-11-01\n\nBioremediation is a broadly applied environmentally friendly and economical treatment for the clean-up of sites contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons. However, the application of this technology to contaminated soil in Libya has not been fully exploited. In this study, the efficacy of different bioremediation processes (necrophytoremediation using pea straw, bioaugmentation and a combination of both treatments) together with natural attenuation were assessed in diesel contaminated Libyan soils. The addition of pea straw was found to be the best bioremediation treatment for cleaning up diesel contaminated Libyan soil after 12 weeks. The greatest TPH degradation, 96.1% (18,239.6mgkg(-1)) and 95% (17,991.14mgkg(-1)) were obtained when the soil was amended with pea straw alone and in combination with a hydrocarbonoclastic consortium respectively. In contrast, natural attenuation resulted in a significantly lower TPH reduction of 76% (14,444.5mgkg(-1)). The presence of pea straw also led to a significant increased recovery of hydrocarbon degraders; 5.7log CFU g(-1) dry soil, compared to 4.4log CFUg(-1) dry soil for the untreated (natural attenuation) soil. DGGE and Illumina 16S metagenomic analyses confirm shifts in bacterial communities compared with original soil after 12 weeks incubation. In addition, metagenomic analysis showed that original soil contained hydrocarbon degraders (e.g. Pseudoxanthomonas spp. and Alcanivorax spp.). However, they require a biostimulant (in this case pea straw) to become active. This study is the first to report successful oil bioremediation with pea straw in Libya. It demonstrates the effectiveness of pea straw in enhancing bioremediation of the diesel-contaminated Libyan soil. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Three subtypes of the disease have been described, based on urinary excretion of cystine and the dibasic amino acids in heterozygotes, and oral loading tests in homozygotes. Cystinuria is very common among Libyan Jews living in Israel. Recently, we mapped the disease-causing gene in Libyan Jews to 19q, and have shown a very strong founder effect. In this report we present the results of biochemical and clinical studies performed on Libyan Jewish cystinuria patients and members of their families. High levels of cystine and the dibasic amino acids in heterozygotes support previous data that cystinuria in Libyan Jews is a non-type I disease. Oral loading tests performed with lysine showed some degree of intestinal absorption, but less than in normal controls. Previous criteria for determining the disease type, based solely on urinary amino acid levels, proved useless due to a very wide range of cystine and the dibasic amino acids excreted by the heterozygotes. Urinary cystine levels were useful in distinguishing between unaffected relatives and heterozygotes, but were unhelpful in differentiating between heterozygotes and homozygotes. Urinary levels of ornithine or arginine, and the sum of urinary cystine and the dibasic amino acids, could distinguish between the last two groups. Among stone formers, 90% were homozygotes and 10% were heterozygotes; 15% of the homozygotes were asymptomatic.\n\nSelf-esteem among college students from four Arab countries.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdel-Khalek, Ahmed M; Korayem, Adel Shokry; El-Nayal, Mayssah A\n\n2012-02-01\n\nThis study had three objectives: (a) to compare undergraduates from four Arab countries on self-esteem, (b) to explore the sex-related differences in self-esteem in these four Arab countries, and (c) to examine the association of self-esteem with both per-capita income and unemployment rate. Four samples of 2,643 students were recruited from Egypt (n = 576), Kuwait (n = 674), Lebanon (n = 826), and Oman (n = 567). They responded to the Arabic version of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Kuwaiti and Omani men had a significantly higher mean score on self-esteem than did Egyptian and Lebanese men. Egyptian women scored significantly lower than the Omani women, but the effect size was small. Regarding the sex-related differences in self-esteem, Kuwaiti men had a significantly higher mean score than did their female peers, but the effect size was small, whereas there were no significant sex differences in the other samples. The sex-related difference in self-esteem is a controversial result and it may not be replicable in different countries. It was suggested that self-esteem is associated with high per-capita income and low unemployment rate.\n\nSATISFACTION WITH LIFE AMONG YOUNG ADULTS IN FOUR ARAB COUNTRIES.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdel-Khalek, Ahmed M; El Nayal, Mayssah A\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThis study sought to explore the sex and cultural differences in satisfaction with life between undergraduate men and women recruited from four Arab countries, i.e., Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Qatar (N = 1,322); ages ranged from 18 to 27 years. The participants responded to the Arabic version of the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Egyptian and Lebanese women obtained significantly higher mean scores on satisfaction with life than did their male counterparts, whereas there were no significant sex differences in the Kuwaiti and Qatari samples. For men, the Qatari and Kuwaiti samples obtained the high mean scores on satisfaction with life, whereas the Egyptian and Lebanese samples obtained the low mean scores. For women, the Qatari sample had the higher mean score, whereas the Egyptian sample obtained the lowest mean score. The results were explained in light of the positive association between gross domestic product and satisfaction with life.\n\nWilsonâs disease in Lebanon and regional countries: Homozygosity and hepatic phenotype predominance\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBarada, Kassem; El Haddad, Aline; Katerji, Meghri; Jomaa, Mustapha; Usta, Julnar\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAIM To determine the phenotypes and predominant disease-causing mutations in Lebanese patients with Wilsonâs disease, as compared to regional non-European data. METHODS The clinical profile of 36 patients diagnosed in Lebanon was studied and their mutations were determined by molecular testing. All patients underwent full physical exam, including ophthalmologic slit-lamp examination ultrasound imaging of the liver, as well as measurement of serum ceruloplasmin and 24-h urinary-Cu levels. In addition, genetic screening using PCR followed by sequencing to determine disease-causing mutations and polymorphisms in the ATP7B gene was carried on extracted DNA from patients and immediate family members. Our phenotypic-genotypic findings were then compared to reported mutations in Wilsonâs disease patients from regional Arab and non-European countries. RESULTS Patients belonged to extended consanguineous families. The majority were homozygous for the disease-causing mutation, with no predominant mutation identified. The most common mutation, detected in 4 out of 13 families, involved the ATP hinge region and was present in patients from Lebanon, Egypt, Iran and Turkey. Otherwise, mutations in Lebanese patients and those of the region were scattered over 17 exons of ATP7B. While the homozygous exon 12 mutation Trp939Cys was only detected in patients from Lebanon but none from the regional countries, the worldwide common mutation H1069Q was not present in the Lebanese and was rare in the region. Pure hepatic phenotype was predominant in patients from both Lebanon and the region (25%-65%). Furthermore, the majority of patients, including those who were asymptomatic, had evidence of some hepatic dysfunction. Pure neurologic phenotype was rare. CONCLUSION Findings do not support presence of a founder effect. Clinical and genetic screening is recommended for family members with index patients and unexplained hepatic dysfunction.
