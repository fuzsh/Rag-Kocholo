        "text": "Group A\n\nIran\n\nThe soccer fanatic country has the biggest number of Europe professionals, has been the most successful Asian team at France 98 and so are favorites to win Lebanon 2000. Only they have not been convincingly recently and looking quite inconsistent. Before a difficult qualification for World Cup 2002 this Asian Cup will show if Iran can make this final step and convert their European experiences into a team that could be a clear step ahead of most the others.\n\n> report of Asian Cup qualification match Syria - Iran\n\nIraq\n\nIraq are a quite similar football team/nation to Iran. But the country has dropped back because of the recent political history. It is difficult to establish an experienced and confident football culture under these circumstances. They are now in a situation (footballwise!) that reminds of neighbours Iran 15 years ago. From talent and background they almost can beat anybody and lose to anybody.\n\nLebanon\n\nLebanon are trying to overcome the widely destroyed infrastructures of the various wars. They will not be an easy walk over because there is some talent. But if it is strong enough to challenge Iran or Iraq? Maybe if it comes down to one crucial match.\n\nThailand\n\nThailand, a soccer mad country are trying hard to close the gap to the top level nations. But at Lebanon they will not be cheered up by their enthusiastic crowds, but rather play in front of quite empty stadiums.\n\nday 1\n\nIraq - Thailand 2:0\n\nReuters/dailysoccer.com:\n\nScorers: Qahtan Drain 27, Haidar Mahmoud Majid 58\n\nHalftime: 1-0; Attendance: 2,000\n\nTeams:\n\nIraq: 1-Hashim Khamis Hassan; 2-Haidar Mahmoud Majid; 4-Abdul Jabar Hanon; 6-Ziyad Tareq Brisam; 7-Adnan Mohammad Hassb (13-Abbas Zayer 56); 25-Abdul Wahab Abul Hail (14-Essam Salem 88); 20-Hussam Fawzi Naji; 9-Ahmed Jasim; 10-Abbas Obeid Jassim; 11-Sabah Khalaf; 15-Qahtan Drain.\n\nThailand: 1-Wirat Wangchang; 2-Thanongsak Pajakkata; 5-Choketawee Promrut; 7-Chukiat Noosalung; 8-Therdsak Chaiman\n\n(11-Thawatchai Damrong-Ongtrakul 70); 12-Surachai Jaturapattarapong; 14-Worrawoot Srimaka; 16-Surachai Jirasirichote; 17-Dusit Chalermsan; 23-Sutee Suksomkit; 24-Tananchai Boriban.\n\nLebanon(hosts)- Iran(tournament favorites) 1845 gmt 0:4 (final score)\n\n1st half:\n\n-unlike in the first match of the day it is a full house and an enthusiastic crowd\n\n-Lebanon in red shirts, white shorts, iran in all white\n\n-Lebanon attacking in the first minutes with some half chances already\n\n-('17) a huge counter attack by Mehdi Mahdavikia and Ali Daei is stopped in the last moment\n\n-a fast and exciting match so far, much better than the first encounter of the day\n\n-('19) a free kick cross from the right hand side by Mehdi Mahdvikia and Karim Bagheria flies into it - his header from 7 meters leaves the keeper no chance - 0:1\n\n-Lebanon answer with more attacks and goal scenes\n\n-But Iran are more dangerous with their attacks\n\n-('40) during an attacking spell, originally initiated by Ali Karimi, Iran display their huge attacking potential and Bagheri hits the goal post with a low shot\n\n-after the good beginning Lebanon has not had much to add, Iran dominates the match now\n\n2nd half:\n\n-Lebanon begin the 2nd half trying to attack again, although it looks better than the end of first half they are not as dangerous as in the beginning, Iran now more solid\n\n-('54) Azizi comes in for Karimi who has seen yellow for a foul from behind\n\n-('59) Azizi is dangerous the first time, falls, wants a penalty but does not get it\n\n-Iran continue to be more dangerous\n\n-('63) Lebanon with a good attack but the eventual header comes from a too difficult angle and hits the outside of the net after a cross had manoeuvered out almost the entier defence\n\n-('64) Ali Daei answers with a sharp low shot which goes wide and leaves the keeper lucky\n\n-the crowd fires up the home team\n\n-('70) Iran is lucky as a shot from 20 meters with free way to the goal sails wide\n\n-('71) again Iran answer attacking themselves, but a defender can stop the counter attack for a corner which then brings some more danger\n\n-('75) great goal: Iranian counter: Ali Daei to Azizi who makes some great moves around keeper and defenders, then sidepasses it to Estili, who has just come in for Mahdavikia, who scores easily from about 12 meters - 0:2\n\n-('76)('77) Lebanon answer right away, abit lack of concentration now by Iran, especially #9 who has come in during the second half makes a lot of noise by his soloruns\n\n-('84) a must score opportunity for Lebanon, when a player, completely unmarked, fails to score from 5 meter distance\n\n-('85) the next Lebanon attack as Iran seem to approach the match too easy now\n\n-('88) a perfect Iranian triangle counter attack Azizi to the right to Daei who sidepasses to the left to Estili who scores - 0:3\n\n-('injury time) another nice triangle play, this time the ball is headed to Ali Daei who hammers it into the goal - 0:4\n\n-a frustrating scoreline for the brave Lebanese, Iran have confirmed their favorite position, Lebanon have to recover psycologically, then they are not without chance in the other two matches"
