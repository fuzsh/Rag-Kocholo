        "text": "Sara Shaltout\n\nDigital Marketing Manager at Lebaladna.\n\nUnlike many other organizations working in the field, we believe that charity and development must go hand in hand.\n\nIngey Nour El Din\n\nLebaladna Volunteer\n\nLebaladna is a platform to share thoughts and ideas, share what you’re passionate about. I’ve seen the impact of creativity and cooperation getting involved in the same process. It’s a place for development and a place where you are accepted. Being in Lebaladna will help you connect to the community, expand your network and boost your social skills.\n\nAbd El Rahman Assem\n\nLebaladna Volunteer\n\nJoining Lebaladna is my first social activity in my life. Lebaladna introduced to me the diversity in our society and how can I help in enhancing & developing our society. Lebaladna really helped me in knowing great people. Participating in many social and humanity activities and feeling satisfied in my life. I’m happy being here with Lebaladna.\n\nHussien Abd El Badea\n\nLebaladna Volunteer\n\nI choose Lebaladna because it has a vision to create a better world by sharing smiles and happiness with peoplealso it inspires me to kill my ego, and to invest my free time helping people who really need help.\n\nHearthy Kamal\n\nLebaladna Volunteer\n\nFor me Lebaladna represented the wise choice of many other alternatives, I wouldn’t call it a risk, but you never really live until you experience all kinds of kindness and choosing the road which is less traveled by turned out to cause all the great differences in my life.\n\nAhmed Tarek\n\nLebaladna Volunteer\n\nTo give away money is an easy matter but to decide to whom you give it to, how much to give, when to give, for what purpose and how to give the money is not an easy matter. This is what Lebaladna is searching for. The more you give away the more that comes back. Life works that way. Lebaladna is really my second family."
