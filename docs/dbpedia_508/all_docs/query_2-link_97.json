Friday's attack also killed five other people and threw Lebanon, which has been drawn into neighboring Syria's conflict, into further turmoil after a series of sectarian bombings aimed at Shi'ites and Sunnis over the past year. Former prime minister Saad al-Hariri accused Hezbollah of involvement in the killing of Chatah, his 62-year-old political adviser, saying it was \"a new message of terrorism\". \"As far as we are concerned the suspects ... are those who are fleeing international justice and refusing to represent themselves before the international tribunal,\" Hariri said. Chatah's killing occurred three weeks before the long-delayed opening of a trial of five Hezbollah suspects indicted for the 2005 bombing which killed former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri, Saad's father, and 21 other people. The trial is due to open in The Hague in January. The suspects are all fugitives and Hezbollah, which denies any role in the Hariri assassination, has refused to cooperate with the court, which it says is politically motivated. Preliminary U.N. investigations implicated Syrian officials. Chatah, a Sunni Muslim, was a vocal critic of Hezbollah. A message on his Twitter account less than an hour before the blast accused the group of trying to take control of the country. \"Hezbollah is pressing hard to be granted similar powers in security and foreign policy matters that Syria exercised in Lebanon for 15 years,\" the tweet read. The conflict in Syria has polarized Lebanon and increased sectarian tensions. Hezbollah has sent fighters to Syria to fight alongside Assad, who is from the Alawite sect, a heterodox offshoot of Shi'ite Islam. Some of the Sunni Syrian rebel groups are linked to al Qaeda, which is also seeking to topple Assad. Former minister Marwan Hamadeh, who survived a car bomb in 2004, told Al Arabiya television: \"Hezbollah will not be able to rule Lebanon, no matter how much destruction it causes or blood it spills.\"\n\nCONDEMNATION\n\nLebanese President Michel Suleiman and Prime Minister Najib Mikati and officials from across Lebanon's sectarian political divide condemned Chatah's killing. Mikati said the blast targeted \"a moderate academic and noble political figure who believed in dialogue, the language of reason and the right to different views\". Hezbollah parliamentarian Ali Ammar described the explosion as a crime. \"We condemn this terrorist act,\" he told Hezbollah's Al Manar television. \"It is part of a terrorist wave which the region and Lebanon are witnessing\". While Chatah had no political power base of his own, his international experience, diplomatic contacts and academic analysis made him a key member of Hariri's circle of advisers. An economist and a diplomat, he worked for the International Monetary Fund in Washington and served as Lebanon's ambassador to the United States. He was also minister of finance from July 2008 to November 2009, after which he worked as a foreign policy adviser to the younger Hariri. Sources at the explosion site said Chatah was on his way to attend a meeting at Hariri's headquarters when the explosion tore through his car. Hariri himself has stayed away from Lebanon for more than two years, fearing for his safety. A Reuters witness said Chatah's car was \"totally destroyed, it is a wreck.\" Chatah's identity card, torn and charred, was found at the scene. Iran, which backs Hezbollah, came under attack in Beirut last month. On November 19, two suicide bombings rocked the embassy compound, killing at least 25 people including an Iranian cultural attache. The sound of Friday's blast was heard across the city at around 9:40 a.m. (0740 GMT) and black smoke was seen rising in the chic downtown business and hotel district. It shattered glass in nearby apartment blocks and damaged cars, restaurants, coffee shops and offices. \"I heard a huge explosion and saw a ball of fire and palls of black smoke. We ran out of our offices to the streets,\" said Hassan Akkawi, who works in a finance company nearby. \"The explosion caught motorists driving in the morning rush hour here. There was terror and panic among residents. There was a big ball of fire and panic everywhere and then we learned that Chatah was the target,\" said Adel-Raouf Kneio.Much of Beirut went into lockdown following the explosion, with police blocking off roads across the city. After a series of explosions in the capital and in the northern city of Tripoli, the Lebanese army had stepped up security measures ahead of Christmas and New Year, fearing further attacks.\n\nFEAR AND PANIC\n\nThe explosion shocked residents and emptied the streets in downtown Beirut, where people seeking a respite from recent turmoil had ventured out to enjoy the Christmas and New Year holiday period.\n\n\"I was on my way to open the store and then the explosion happened. For a while I was thinking, 'Am I still alive?' I didn't know what happened. I was just seeing the people running and holding their ears and eyes, and running,\" said Maya, manager of the Taten dress shop. The owner of a restaurant down the street from the blast site, whose windows were smashed, said: \"The damage to the glass is not the problem. People won't want to come here now. We were fully booked for the next five days.\" Workers at luxury dress shops next to the site, where the entire glass facade was destroyed, were sweeping up glass, picking up damaged mannequins and counting the damage to the luxury dresses. \"I consider all this terrorism, damaging the country and the people. What can we say more? God helps us, God help this country,\" said Lebanese citizen Jamal near the explosion scene.\n\n(Additional reporting by Mariam Karouny, Leila Bassam and Dominic Evans; Editing by Giles Elgood\n\nReport: Starco Bomb Car Stolen from Shouf, Taken to Ain el-Hilweh\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/The olive green Honda CRV used in the assassination of former minister Mohammed Shatah was stolen in early 2013 from the town of Rmeileh in the Shouf district, a media report citing preliminary investigations said on Friday. During the ongoing investigations, it turned out that a black Honda CRV belonging to Internal Security Forces Warrant Officer Elie F. was stolen from the Shouf coast area before it was seized by the Lebanese army at one of its checkpoints at the entrance of the (Palestinian) Ain el-Hilweh camp only several days after the theft of the first (olive green) car, As Safir newspaper quoted sources involved in the investigation as saying. The sources said Ahmed A., aka Abu al-Daoud, was driving the black car and confessed during interrogation that he stole the olive green CRV that targeted Shatah's convoy in collaboration with a man called Moussa M. and another called Mohammed S. and nicknamed Mohammed al-Sarii, adding that the car was carrying a license plate with the number 177647/S. This (olive green) car entered the Ain el-Hilweh camp some time ago and was given to a man nicknamed Talal al-Ordoni, the sources quoted Abu al-Daoud as saying. The sources noted that Moussa M. and Mohammed al-Sarii were members of the Fatah al-Islam who receive their orders from the group's top official Haitham al-Shaabi. Foreign inmate Morshed Abdul Rahman, who is jailed at the central Roumieh prison over the case of the two cars, confirmed to interrogators that Moussa M. and Mohammed al-Sarii took the car to the Ain el-Hilweh camp and that they are members of Fatah al-Islam, the sources added. But later on Friday, Munir al-Maqdah, a military commander of the Palestinian Fatah Movement, said the three men mentioned in the report are not members of Fatah al-Islam but rather of the Fatah Movement. \"Talal al-Ordoni is a Fatah colonel, Mohammed al-Sarii is a 15-year-old football player ... and Mohammed Saleh was briefly detained (by Lebanese security forces) for two hours today,\" Maqdah told LBCI television. \"This issue poses a threat to the Palestinian camps and we won't provide political cover for anyone,\" he noted. Maqdah revealed that the three men were \"jointly interrogated with Roumieh prison inmates and they denied any involvement in taking the car to the Ain el-Hilweh camp.\" In response to a question, Maqdah confirmed that Haitham al-Shaabi is present at the al-Tawari neighborhood in Ain el-Hilweh, describing him as \"one of the remnants of Jund al-Sham.\" Shatah -- a former finance minister and an adviser to ex-Premier Saad Hariri -- was killed in a powerful car bombing in the Starco area in central Beirut as he was heading to a March 14 meeting at the Center House. Several people were killed and dozens others were also wounded in the attack.\n\nBan, Security Council Condemn 'Threat' to Lebanon's Stability, Plumbly 'Shocked' by Shatah Assassination\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/U.N. leader Ban Ki-moon and the U.N. Security Council on Friday raised fears over threats to Lebanon's stability after a bomb attack which killed a key former minister.\n\nBan and the U.N. Security Council strongly condemned the Beirut suicide bomb attack which killed six people including former Finance Minister Mohammed Shatah. \"The secretary general is deeply troubled by the recurring acts of terrorism in Lebanon which pose a severe threat to the country's stability and national cohesion,\" said U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky. Ban praised efforts by Lebanese authorities and security forces to \"protect the country from the impact of the crisis in neighboring Syria,\" added the spokesman. The U.N. leader \"reiterates the determination of the international community to support Lebanon's security and stability,\" during the mounting Syria crisis which increasingly threatens neighboring countries. The 15-nation Security Council agreed a statement which highlighted \"unequivocal condemnation of any attempt to destabilize Lebanon through political assassinations and demanded an immediate end to the use of intimidation and violence against political figures.\"The council reaffirmed past calls for Lebanese \"to preserve national unity in the face of attempts to undermine the country's stability and stressed the importance for all Lebanese parties to respect Lebanon's policy of disassociation and to refrain from any involvement in the Syrian crisis.\"\n\nMeanwhile, U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Derek Plumbly also condemned on Friday the assassination of Shatah, expressing his sorrow and shock by today's bombing.\n\nHe urged the need for restraint at this difficult time and for all Lebanese to come together in support of institutions of the state and the security forces as they seek to safeguard the country at this difficult time.\n\nHe stressed the importance of those responsible for this and other such acts of terrorism being brought to justice. Plumbly described Shatah as a good friend, and a wise, courageous and patriotic man, who had consistently sought to promote dialogue and Lebanons well-being. He extended his condolences to Shatah's family and colleagues, and to the families of all of the victims of the bombing. Shatah was killed in a major car bombing in downtown Beirut on Friday. At least six people were killed in the blast.\n\nHariri's Adviser Shatah Killed in Huge Explosion that Rocked Beirut\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/..A heavy explosion that rocked the capital Beirut on Friday targeted the convoy of former Finance Minister Mohammed Shatah, who is ex-Prime Minister Saad Hariri's adviser. Shatah's vehicle license was located in the area of the blast. The body of Shatah was retrieved from the scene and transferred to AUBMC. The blast that hit Starco area in downtown Beirut near Bank Audi-SAL killed six people and at least 50 others were wounded. Around 400 meters of the area was damaged. Caretaker PM Najib Miqati swiftly called for an emergency meeting for the Higher Council for Disasters. Hizbullah is pressing hard to be granted similar powers in security and foreign policy matters that Syria exercised in Lebanon for 15 years, Shatah wrote in a tweet a few hours before his assassination. Shatah had served as adviser to former PM Fouad Saniora and his successor and Saad Hariri, whose own father was assassinated in a huge Beirut seafront car bomb in February 2005 blamed on Syria. A meeting for the March 14 alliance was scheduled to be held at the Center House in downtown. State Commissioner to the Military Court Judge Saqr Saqr arrived at the scene to inspect the site of explosion. Saqr said that the explosion weighed between 50 and 60 kilos. Higher Defense Council chief General Mohammed Kheir also inspected the area at the head of a delegation to determine the needs of the victims and take the necessary measures to aid them. Early estimates said around 30 kilograms of highly combustible elements were used in the explosives. Red Cross Operations Director George Kettaneh told LBCI that there are more than 15 casualties. Caretaker Health Minister Ali Hassan Khalil later ordered all hospitals in Beirut to receive those who were wounded in the explosion. Television channels showed pictures of thick smoke near the Serail, where Lebanon's prime minister has his offices, and a major commercial district home to shops, banks, restaurants. People were seen running to rescue the injured as a helicopter was seen hovering over the area of the blast. Footage broadcast by Future TV showed people on fire, others lying on the ground, some bloodied, as well as fires blazing at several other points while ambulances rushed to the stricken area. Civil defense teams battled fire that erupted in the area of the explosion. The blast, according to media reports, was caused by a booby-trapped car. According to MTV the suicide attacker's name was identified by Ahmed. Security forces were seen opening fire in the air to disperse people gathered near the blast and began checking the identification papers of passers-by in the area. The blast caused a major dysfunction in mobile phone communications. Beirut has been hit by several deadly attacks over the past months, including twin suicide bombings in November that targeted the Iranian embassy and bombings in the bastion of Hizbullah in the south of the capital over the summer. The 33-month war in Syria has deeply divided the Lebanese and triggered political tensions and sectarian clashes in the country.\n\nHariri: Shatah's Murderers Same Ones behind Rafik Hariri's Assassination\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/Former Prime Minister Saad Hariri condemned on Friday the assassination of his adviser Mohammed Shatah, saying that Lebanon lost moderate figure who believed in peace and an independent Lebanon. He said in a statement: Shatah's murderers are the same ones who assassinated former Premier Rafik Hariri. The murderers seek to assassinate the whole of Lebanon and weaken the state, he remarked. The accused, and until further notice, are the same ones who are running away from international justice, added Hariri. The accused are the same ones who refuse to stand trial before the Special Tribunal for Lebanon because they are paving the way for evil and chaos in Lebanon, he continued. They seek to spread regional wars to Lebanon, he stressed. They practice oppression against anyone who follows the example of Rafik Hariri and who demands the rise of the state that does not include terrorists, murderers, and supporters of car bombings among its ranks, he declared. The murderers succeeded today in targeting our lifelong friend and partner in defending Lebanon, Mohammed Shatah, Hariri said. Shatah believed in peace and justice. His murderers will not stop their criminal path and their insistence to drag Lebanon towards the abyss of strife, he continued.\n\nThis reality will remain as long as some sides in Lebanon continue to bury their heads in the sand and continue to justify the possession of illegitimate arms, he stated.\n\nShatah's name will ring loud at the opening of the STL trial in a few days at The Hague, he remarked. His name will remain a beacon among a civilized and progressive Lebanon, said the former premier.\n\nYour career will remain a source of inspiration for us throughout our political and national life, said Hariri, while offering his condolences to his family. Shatah was killed on Friday in a huge car bombing in downtown Beirut.\n\nThe STL had accused five Hizbullah members of being behind the 2005 assassination of former PM Rafik Hariri. Hizbullah had slammed the accusation with party chief Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah vowing not cooperate with it.\n\nThe suspects have not been found. The trial is scheduled to kick off on January 16 at The Hague.\n\nMarch 14 Demands Shatah Assassination Be Referred to STL\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/The March 14 forces condemned on Friday the assassination of former Finance Minister Mohammed Shatah, saying that his murderer is known to all Lebanese.\n\nHead of the Mustaqbal bloc MP Fouad Saniora said: We demand that his assassination be referred to the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. The forces made their statement after an emergency meeting at the Center House in Beirut in light of Shatah's assassination on Friday morning. Shatah was killed at the hands of the same murderer who threatens us on a daily basis, he declared.\n\nThis is the same murderer who has not had enough in targeting the Cedar Revolution, he remarked. The murderer, with its Lebanese allies, is targeting Beirut, Tripoli, and Sidon in Lebanon and Syria's Daraa, Aleppo, and Damascus, he noted. We received the criminals' bloody message and we reply that Lebanon will remain free as tyrants will fall, declared Saniora. Lebanon will remain a country of freedom, dignity, and coexistence, he stressed. Addressing the Lebanese, he said: You should not be fearful, but the criminals should be fearful instead. Lebanon will remain a country for all Lebanese in spite of the criminals, he stated.\n\nLebanon will not die and it will not surrender. It has existed before us and it will continue after our death. It will remain stronger than its enemies and the criminals, said Saniora.\n\nHe announced that the March 14 forces will keep their meetings open-ended until they announce further steps to be taken after Shatah's assassination. Former Premier Saad Hariri's adviser, Shatah was killed in a major car bomb in downtown Beirut. At least six people were killed in the blast. The March 14 General Secretariat later condemned the assassination, saying that Shatah's moderation \"was a cause for concern for those seeking strife and crimes against humanity in Syria and Lebanon.\" It pledged that it will continue along the path of true resistance that witnessed the martyrdom of the several supporters of Lebanon's independence, starting with former Premier Rafik Hariri in 2005. It called on the people to take part in Shatah's funeral, which is scheduled for noon on Sunday at the Amin Mosque in downtown Beirut.\n\nEU Urges Political Leaders to Join to Restore Security\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/The EU's top diplomat on Friday deplored a deadly car bomb explosion in central Beirut and urged Lebanon's leaders to join together to restore security in the country. \"The spiral of violence in Lebanon is deeply worrying,\" said EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, deploring the blast that notably took the life of former Finance Minister Mohammed Shatah, .\"I urge Lebanon's political leaders and the Lebanese people to put aside all differences and join forces - as a priority and without delay - to restore security in the country.\" She also reiterated a call for the formation of a new government \"capable of addressing the many challenges Lebanon is facing\". \"The EU stands by the people of Lebanon and reaffirms its commitment to the unity, stability, independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon,\" Ashton added in a statement. Source/Agence France Presse.\n\nU.S. Says Shatah Murder an 'Abhorrent Terrorist Attack', Reiterates Support for STL\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/The United States on Friday deplored the assassination of former minister Mohammed Shatah as an abhorrent terrorist attack, urging the Lebanese to respect the Taif and Baabda agreements and reiterating its support for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. On behalf of President (Barack) Obama and the United States, I condemn in the strongest possible terms today's abhorrent terrorist attack and assassination of former Lebanese Cabinet Minister Mohammed Shatah in Beirut, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. This is a terrible loss for Lebanon, the Lebanese people and for the United States, he added. I had the privilege of spending many hours with Shatah during my visits to Beirut as a United States Senator, and I know he was a voice of reason, responsibility and moderation. His presence will be missed, but his vision for a united Lebanon, free from sectarian violence and destabilizing interference, will continue to guide our efforts, Kerry went on to say. The top U.S. diplomat said the Obama administration supports Lebanon as its leaders work to bring those responsible for this heinous and cowardly attack to justice under the rule of law. Such actions cannot be allowed to take place with impunity. This is why we fully support the work of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon and its efforts to find and hold accountable those responsible for these reprehensible and destabilizing acts, added Kerry. He noted that these acts only reinforce the strength and resolve of our commitment to support legitimate, unifying security forces in Lebanon, such as the Lebanese Armed Forces. It also shows the importance of all parties adhering to the Taif and Baabda agreements and U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1559 and 1710, and fulfilling their commitments to all of those principles, so that Lebanon maintains its sovereignty and stability, Kerry added. We stand with the Lebanese people at this time and will continue to do so, he stressed. Shatah -- a former finance minister and an adviser to ex-Premier Saad Hariri -- was killed in a powerful car bombing in the Starco area in central Beirut as he was heading to a March 14 meeting at the Center House. Several people were killed and dozens others were also wounded in the attack.\n\nSyria Slams March 14 'Accusations': Saniora, Hariri and Their Kings are Funding Terrorism\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/Damascus on Friday rejected accusations by the March 14 camp that the Syrian regime and its allies were involved in the assassination of former minister Mohammed Shatah, describing the allegations as a stupid and futile attempt to cover up for financing terrorism in Lebanon and the region.Some figures in Lebanon always resort to the approach of launching accusations whenever a painful assassination happens in brotherly Lebanon, Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zohbi said in a statement. These random and arbitrary accusations are based on political grudges that reflect the links of individuals such as (former premier Fouad) Saniora and others to the enemies of the nation and the enemies of moderation, Zohbi added.\n\nThese are desperate attempts to refute a verified and solid charge about Saniora's role in supporting and financing terrorism in Lebanon and the region, especially organizations such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, al-Nusra Front and the Islamic Front, the minister went on to say, accusing Saniora of providing safe havens for their leaders and operations rooms, under the sponsorship of (ex-PM) Saad Hariri and his kings and princes.\n\nZohbi noted that launching accusations in this stupid, futile and premature manner proves that some forces in Lebanon are controlling the ground now and are the same parties that are practicing terrorism across the region.\n\nThe minister said Syria wishes security, welfare and peace for the Lebanese people, calling all the honorable people in Lebanon to stand in the face of terrorism, for which some political forces are providing a real cover.Zohbi stressed that terrorism is the enemy of everyone and of all peoples in the world, calling for confronting it in a serious, firm manner, away from the absurd rhetoric of political accusations.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the March 14 forces condemned in a statement recited by Saniora the assassination of Shatah, saying that his murderer is known to all Lebanese.\n\nShatah was killed at the hands of the same murderer who threatens us on a daily basis, said the statement.\n\nThe murderer, with its Lebanese allies, is targeting Beirut, Tripoli, and Sidon in Lebanon and Syria's Daraa, Aleppo, and Damascus, it added.\n\nShatah -- a former finance minister and an adviser to both Saniora and Hariri -- was killed in a powerful explosion in the Starco area in central Beirut as he was heading to a March 14 meeting at the Center House.\n\nSeveral people were killed and dozens others were also wounded in the attack.\n\nArab Countries 'Strongly' Condemn Beirut Blast, KSA, Kuwait Urge Citizens to Leave Lebanon\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/Saudi Arabia and Qatar on Friday \"strongly\" condemned the car bomb blast in Beirut that killed six people, including former finance minister Mohammed Shatah.\n\nSaudi Arabia \"has followed with great concern and disturbance the outrageous terrorist bombing\" that rocked the Lebanese capital, said a statement on the official SPA news agency. \"The kingdom strongly condemns this cowardly criminal act and urges all parties in Lebanon to listen to the sound of rationalism and common sense... and insists on the need of the state to enhance its authority and that of the army across all Lebanese territories.\" Later in the day, the Saudi embassy in Lebanon released a statement urging its citizens to avoid traveling to the country.\n\n\"We also ask Saudis that are already in Lebanon to return to KSA as a safety precaution, the statement added. Shatah, an economist, former finance minister and Lebanon's ambassador to the United States, was the ninth high-profile anti-Syria figure killed in Lebanon since the 2005 assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri.

Dr. Chatah was a strong voice for peace and moderation in Lebanon, whom I had the opportunity to meet on my visit to Lebanon in August 2012. His loss will be deeply felt by peace-loving people in Lebanon and beyond. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family and friends and to the Lebanese people at this difficult time.\n\nCanada strongly condemns all attempts to destabilize Lebanon. We stand firmly with the Lebanese people in the face of terrorist threats and commend their resilience.\n\n- 30 -\n\nFor further information, media representatives may contact:\n\nMedia Relations Office\n\nForeign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada\n\n613-995-1874\n\nmedia@international.gc.ca\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @DFATDCanada\n\nKilling moderation\n\nDecember 28, 2013/The Daily Star\n\nThe explosion that ripped through Downtown Beirut Friday, taking the lives of former Minister Mohammad Shatah and five other people, wasnt merely the latest in a long series of terror acts targeting Lebanon. It can also be seen as the first salvo in a new attempt to push the country straight into the abyss. The killing of Shatah, a key figure in the March 14 coalition, follows months of political paralysis and rising tension, stemming mainly from the dispute over Hezbollahs participation in the war raging in Syria. The atmosphere has been poisoned by the threatening tone of rhetoric used by March 8 politicians, who have overtly and covertly warned the March 14 camp to accept whatever policies and conditions they decide are in the national interest. And in a few weeks time, the Special Tribunal for Lebanon will finally commence its long-awaited trial of Hezbollah members accused of assassinating former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in 2005, a crime that took place relatively close to Fridays horrific bombing. The car bomb attack, in a heavily monitored part of the capital, was also significant because it took place in close proximity to the government serail as well as the home of former Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who has long been the target of threats of assassination.\n\nHowever, the target of the attack deserves special scrutiny. Shatah symbolized March 14s policy of moderation, and its firm belief in the process of national dialogue to help Lebanon exit its current crisis.\n\nBy targeting Shatah  and the other moderate March 14 figures in recent years  the criminals have exposed their agenda. They want to rob Lebanon of the kind of figures who can help the country move forward. They want the voices of extremism and hatred to grow stronger, in a vicious circle of tension and conflagration. Only those who operate based on blind hatred, who devote themselves to playing with the fire of sectarian and other types of polarization, and who believe that violence is a solution to political disagreements, will be emboldened by Shatahs killing. Its not enough to bemoan the lack of security and the long list of crimes that preceded Fridays attack  because they have gone unpunished, Lebanons enemies have become emboldened to strike down whomever they see as a threat to their influence. And its certainly not enough, as some March 8 politicians are doing, to blame Israel, without any evidence. This only misleads the public and does nothing to address the root problem  no one is being punished for the long list of outrageous crimes that have targeted Lebanon and the Lebanese.\n\nLebanon is standing on the brink of a precipice, and those who uphold sovereignty and independence should make every possible effort to prevent the criminals who cold-bloodedly carried out Fridays bombing from reaping any benefit from this despicable crime.\n\nKidnapped Lebanese Factory Owner Freed in Nigeria\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/A Lebanese factory owner who was kidnapped by gunmen in the north Nigerian city of Kano has been freed after a search, police said on Friday. Police spokesman Magaji Musa Majia said that officers found Hassan Zein, the owner of the MC Plastics facility, around 0800 GMT on the outskirts of the city. He was unhurt and has been reunited with his family, Majia added in an emailed statement. \"No arrest has been made yet. (The) investigation is in top gear with a view to arresting the fleeing perpetrators,\" he said. Zein was abducted in the Sharada industrial area of Kano on Monday, prompting police to block exits from the city to ensure the kidnappers could not escape. Five assailants stormed the factory compound and seized Zein as he got out of his car in the car park, witnesses said. Shots were fired into the air, sending workers rushing inside for safety. A security guard and a female employee were shot and wounded. Kidnappings for ransom are common in Nigeria, with scores of foreigners, include those from the sizable Lebanese community, targeted every year.

Lebanon transferred 29 million euros that constitute its share of the tribunal funding.

God himself killed him, through the two martyrs in their attack on the Iranian embassy,\" Sheikh Sirajeddin Zureikat said. The recording was posted on the radical cleric's YouTube account late on Thursday and redistributed on jihadist forums.\n\nHe was referring to a twin suicide attack on November 19 that targeted the Iranian embassy in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a stronghold of Hizbullah. On December 4, Hizbullah said Laqqis was killed near Beirut. The party blamed Israel for the assassination. The online video does not show Zureikat's face. Instead, it shows the pictures of the two men who carried out the suicide attacks that killed 25 people.\n\nBeneath their pictures, in which they are shown wearing military gear, runs a caption reading: \"The martyr Abu Oweiss al-Sidawi (Moein Abu Dahr) God welcome him.\" A second caption reads: \"The martyr Abu Sufyan al-Shami (Adnan al-Mohammad) God welcome him.\" Immediately after the attack on the Iranian embassy, the Abdullah Azzam brigades had claimed responsibility for the blasts.\n\nIn the latest recording, Zureikat meanwhile said the attacks were in revenge for \"Iran's crimes\" in Syria against Sunnis, as well as for Hizbullah's \"crimes\". The Abdallah Azzam brigades leader meanwhile warned of new attacks against Hizbullah in the country. \"Our operations will come to an end in Lebanon only if two conditions are fulfilled: first, Hizbullah must withdraw its troops from Syria... and secondly Sunni youths must be freed from Lebanon's oppressive jails,\" Zureikat said. Dozens of Sunni fighters are being held in jails since the 2007 battle in Nahr al-Bared, northern Lebanon, that pitted the army against radical Islamists.\n\nOthers have also since been arrested in the southern city of Sidon, where a June battle pitted the army against Islamists that killed 18 troops. Referring to al-Qaida's chief, Zureikat meanwhile said: \"We emphasize that we do not target Shiite civilians, in keeping with orders from... Sheikh Ayman al-Zawahiri... and that our target is Iran's Hizbullah and its allies in the battle against our Sunni brothers in Lebanon and Syria.\"Source/Agence France Presse.\n\nGunmen Take to Streets in Tripoli after Shatah's Assassination\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/Gunfire erupted in Tripoli on Friday as news broke that former minister Mohammed Shatah, who hails from the northern city, was assassinated in a car bombing in downtown Beirut.\n\nGunmen roamed the streets on motorcycles and opened fire in the air, according to state-run National News Agency. Meanwhile, a number of young men blocked the main road in al-Beddawi in protest at the murder. And in the Abu Ali River area, unknown individuals hurled several hand grenades into the river's stream as gunshots echoed in the district. Shatah -- a former finance minister and an adviser to former premier Saad Hariri -- was killed in a powerful explosion in the Starco area in central Beirut as he was heading to a March 14 meeting at the Center House.Several people were killed and dozens others were also wounded in the attack.\n\nDead, Wounded Rebels Arrive in Arsal after Syrian Army Ambush in Damascus Province\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/A number of bodies and several wounded fighters arrived Friday in the Bekaa border town of Arsal after falling into a Syrian army ambush in Damascus' countryside. Around 150 dead and wounded gunmen arrived in Arsal after falling into a Syrian army ambush between al-Qastal and Maalula in Damascus' countryside, Syrian state television reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Voice of Lebanon radio (93.3) said the Red Cross transported two people who were wounded in Syria to the Farhat Hospital in the Bekaa while a dead Syrian man was buried in Arsal.\"\n\nEarlier on Friday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of rebels were killed in clashes that followed an ambush set up for them by regime forces in an area between al-Mrah and al-Qastal near the historic Christian town of Maalula. The Britain-based Observatory also said that 20 people were wounded in the clashes. State television said troops surprised fighters of the Qaida-linked al-Nusra Front Friday at dawn near Maalula, which the group along with other rebels captured in late November for the second time this year. Maalula had previously been firmly in the government's grip despite being surrounded by rebel-held territory. Maalula is on the edge of the rugged Qalamoun region, about 60 kilometers northeast of the capital, where the government has been on the offensive for weeks.\n\nFrom Senator John McCain\n\nThanks for standing with our Republican team and fighting for our conservative principles. As we prepare the battleground for 2014, we need patriots like you by our side now more than ever. 2014 will be an uphill battle, as we're going up against the well-stocked Obama Machine that's determined to take total control of Washington and continue to fundamentally transform America. We must protect our principles and defend our basic liberties by defeating these liberal bureaucrats. You and I know what makes America an exceptional nation. It's not just a matter of who we are. It's the record of what we've done. We have stood and fought for freedom, opportunity and free enterprise. But sadly, under the reign of President Obama and Washington Liberals, these founding, fundamental American principles are under attack. That's what's at stake this election. That's what we're fighting for to defend. And that's why it's essential that you commit to our cause by contributing right now. The RNC needs to raise millions of dollars to build their ground operation, enhance their engagement with voters in all communities, and arm the GOP grassroots army with critical data and technology. We must do the hard work now to get Republicans elected up and down the ballot who will fight for our commonsense, conservative policies and make our communities and our country stronger. Let's band together to defeat Democrats and defend our principles in 2014. Thanks, Senator John McCain\n\nQuestion: \"What sort of New Years Resolution should a Christian make?\"\n\nGotQuestions.org/Answer: The practice of making New Years resolutions goes back over 3,000 years to the ancient Babylonians. There is just something about the start of a new year that gives us the feeling of a fresh start and a new beginning. In reality, there is no difference between December 31 and January 1. Nothing mystical occurs at midnight on December 31. The Bible does not speak for or against the concept of New Years resolutions. However, if a Christian determines to make a New Years resolution, what kind of resolution should he or she make?\n\nCommon New Years resolutions are commitments to quit smoking, to stop drinking, to manage money more wisely, and to spend more time with family. By far, the most common New Years resolution is to lose weight, in conjunction with exercising more and eating more healthily. These are all good goals to set. However, 1 Timothy 4:8 instructs us to keep exercise in perspective: For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come. The vast majority of New Years resolutions, even among Christians, are in relation to physical things. This should not be.\n\nMany Christians make New Years resolutions to pray more, to read the Bible every day, and to attend church more regularly. These are fantastic goals. However, these New Years resolutions fail just as often as the non-spiritual resolutions, because there is no power in a New Years resolution. Resolving to start or stop doing a certain activity has no value unless you have the proper motivation for stopping or starting that activity. For example, why do you want to read the Bible every day? Is it to honor God and grow spiritually, or is it because you have just heard that it is a good thing to do? Why do you want to lose weight? Is it to honor God with your body, or is it for vanity, to honor yourself?\n\nPhilippians 4:13 tells us, I can do everything through Him who gives me strength. John 15:5 declares, I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If God is the center of your New Years resolution, it has chance for success, depending on your commitment to it. If it is Gods will for something to be fulfilled, He will enable you to fulfill it. If a resolution is not God honoring and/or is not in agreement in Gods Word, we will not receive Gods help in fulfilling the resolution.\n\nSo, what sort of New Years resolution should a Christian make? Here are some suggestions: (1) pray to the Lord for wisdom (James 1:5) in regards to what resolutions, if any, He would have you make; (2) pray for wisdom as to how to fulfill the goals God gives you; (3) rely on Gods strength to help you; (4) find an accountability partner who will help you and encourage you; (5) dont become discouraged with occasional failures; instead, allow them to motivate you further; (6) dont become proud or vain, but give God the glory. Psalm 37:5-6 says, Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him and he will do this: He will make your righteousness shine like the dawn, the justice of your cause like the noonday sun.\n\nSSNP Mourns Member Killed 'Performing National Duty'\n\nNaharnet Newsdesk 27 December 2013/The Syrian Social National Party announced on Friday evening the death of a member who was killed while \"performing his national duty in confronting terrorism and extremism, in an apparent reference to the war in neighboring Syria. Mohammed Ali Awwad, who hails from the town of Almat in Jbeil, joined the party in 2007, according to a statement released by the SSNP.\n\n\"A popular funeral will be held on Sunday at 2:00pm, after which Awwad will be buried in his hometown. Since the eruption of Syria's civil war, this was the first time the SSNP announces the death of a member amid many reports saying the party is fighting in the neighboring country alongside President Bashar Assad's forces. Hizbullah is openly fighting against Syria's rebels, and has announced the deaths of many members since 2011.\n\nAnd in November, former MP Wiam Wahhab's Tawhid Party said several of its members were killed in Syria."
