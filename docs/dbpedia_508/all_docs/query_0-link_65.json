        "text": "Kinda Alloush Kinda Alloush is a Cairo-based Syrian actress who has made her foray into acting by starring in Syrian dramas that have been widespread and successful across the Arab world at that time. However, Kinda's talent and ambition have enabled her to make her way through the Egyptian TV and film industry to establish a prominent name throughout the whole Arab world after that. She has an extensive repertoire of notable works with significant directors across the Arab world, including Chaouki Mejeri, Haitham Hakki, Sherif Arafa, Hatem Ali, Khaled Marei, Mohamed Yassin, and Marwan Hamed.

In 2012, Kinda settled in Egypt to take part in a number of outstanding TV series; Khaled Marei's NIRAN SADEEKA (2013), for which she won Excellence Award at the Oscar ART in 2013, and AL AHD (EL KALAM EL MOBAH) (2015) along with A'D TANAZOLY (2014), followed by Mohamed Yasine's AFRAH AL QOBA in 2016 and the two TV series HAGAR GOHANAM and AHL AL GHARAM in 2017.

THE SWIMMERS' success continues to astound everyone, especially after being nominated for a Bafta Award for Outstanding British Film of the Year. THE SWIMMERS, written and directed by Sally El Husseiny, is based on the true story of Yusra and Sara Mardini, Syrian refugee sisters who made it to the Olympics. On a further note, Kinda's upcoming works include YELLOW BUS, a co-production between USA, Mexico, India, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates. The film has finished its production process and shall screen exclusively on OSN Network as one of its originals, following its screenings in theaters and international film festivals. YELLOW BUS highlights several human topics, such as motherhood, Identity, Social alienation, and loss, all of which are entangled within a dramatic plot that represents Arab communities in particular, and international ones in general. This was evident in the story of a six-year-old girl who died of heat exhaustion after falling asleep on the school bus without anybody recognizing her. The film stars Kinda Alloush alongside Bollywood Indian star Tannishtha Chatterjee, who won Best Actress Award at a number of international festivals, including the British Independent Film Awards for her role in the British film BRICK LANE, as well as Bollywood star Amit Sial, known for the famous series INSIDE EDGE, that was nominated for the International Emmy Awards in 2018.

Kinda was selected as a jury member in a number of international film festivals, including the 32nd and 39th Cairo International Film Festival in 2012 and 2017, the Tropfest Arabia Short Film Festival (2012), the Alexandria Film Festival for Mediterranean Countries in 2013, the Freedom Films competition at the Luxor African Film Festival (2018), and the Short Film Competition within El Gouna Film Festival in 2020. On the humanitarian side, Kinda has always been keen on taking part in a lot of initiatives that support refugees from around the globe, especially from Syria. Kinda's support is not limited to the moral one, she is also keen on attending field activities and visiting refugee camps in different areas, the thing that put her name on the High Profile Supporters' list by the UN Commissioner for Refugees."
