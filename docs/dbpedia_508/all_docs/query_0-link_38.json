        "text": "With a smile that melts hearts and looks that catch all eyes, Lebanese actress Nour made quite an impression on audiences from her first roles in Egyptian films, TV series, and plays.\n\nHer beauty might be one of the elements that initially put her in the limelight, however, it's her talent that kept her shining in the film industry for over 20 years. Presenting striking performances in comedy, drama, or thrillers, Nour has no doubt proven to be quite a skillful actress.\n\nNour is a graduate of the Faculty of Fine Arts in Beirut. While studying, she started modeling in TV commercials. She first visited Egypt to audition for Chipsy Egypt's new TV commercial with Egyptian actor Hesham Selim and director Sherif Arafa. Soon after, Nour was chosen by director Saeed Hamed to star opposite Egyptian star Ahmed El Sakka in the blockbuster SHORT W FANELAH W CAP (2000).\n\nThe film was a massive success, with Nour leaving a good impression on audiences, who named her 'The Lebanese Nour.' In the following years, Nour starred in several romantic hits like IZZAY TEKHALI EL-BANAT TEHIBBAK film (2003), director Kamla Abu Zekri's first film SANA OULA NASB (2004), SAYED EL ATIFI (2005) - in which she starred opposite Egyptian singer Tamer Hosny in his first leading role - and then TISBAH ALA KHAIR (2017).\n\nRefraining from the typecast of the sweet, nice girl, Nour took part in many drama films, including ASHAB WALA BUSINESS (2001), in which she played the role of a young TV director whose passion for the Palestinian Intifada leads her to risk her own life. In 2007, she starred in two other drama films - NUQTAT ROJOO and KASHF HESAB, the first feature film by director Amir Ramsis. Two years later she starred in the psychological drama film MEKANO (2009) by director Mahmoud Kamel, alongside actors Taim Hasan and Khaled El-Sawy, and in 2016 she starred in the drama-thriller MEN TALATEEN SANA by director Amr Arafa.\n\nNour also showed audiences her funny side in the comedies OKAL (2004) alongside Egyptian actor Mohammed Saad, along with ZARF TAREK (2006) and MATAB SENA'Y (2006) with Egyptian actor Ahmed Helmy.\n\nWith more talent to flaunt, Nour surprised audiences by playing complex villain characters with Ahmed Ezz in Sandra Nashaat's blockbusters MALLAKI ISKANDARIYA (2005) and AL RAHINA (2006), playing the role of an international terrorist in the latter.\n\nHer small-screen repertoire includes many TV hits, such as AL-AMEEL 1001 (2005) with Mostafa Shaban, DOMOA AL QAMAR (2008) with Riyad Al-Kholi and Rania Farid Shawky, seasons one and two of SARAYA ABDEEN (2014-2015) - which featured a star-studded cast from Egypt and the Arab world - and EL-EXCELLANCE (2014), where she reunited with Ahmed Ezz.\n\nIn 2018, she took part in the Ramadan hit series RAHIM with Yasser Galal, for which she received the Best Actress Award at the Arab Satellite Channels Festival.\n\nNour also took part in the play TEHEB TESHOUF MA'SAH in 2002 and starred in radio series, including GHARAM ALA EL INSTAGRAM (2015) with Ahmed Ezz.\n\nIn Ramadan 2020, Nour starred in the TV series EL PRINCE opposite Mohamed Ramadan. Written and directed by Mohamed Samy, the TV drama received massive success among audiences and critics alike. In the same year, she also starred in the TV drama GAMAL EL HAREEM by director Manal El-Seify alongside Khaled Selim.\n\nIn 2021, Nour reunited with Egyptian star Yasser Galal in the TV series DEL RAGEL (MAN'S SHADOW). She was also featured in the TV prank show KHAMAS NAGOUM (Five Stars), which brought together Ghada Adel, Mostafa Amar, Karim Fahmy, and Mohamed Al-Sharnuby as TV show presenters for the first time.\n\nNour was also featured in the music video MET'ALA BEEKY which was released during the closing ceremony of the fifth El-Gouna Film Festival.
