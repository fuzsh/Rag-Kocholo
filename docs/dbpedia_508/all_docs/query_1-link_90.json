One was written in English by an English Colonel in 1938 called \"Tribes of Jordan\" by Col. Fredrick G. Peak. And the second called \"Madaba and the Karadsheh Tribe\", written by two of our own Karadsheh scholars, Mr. Mikhaeel K. Jumean and Dr. Amjad A. Jumean ... My sincere and heart felt thanks go to Captain Ramzi Matalqa who contributed the book \"Madaba and the Karadsheh Tribe\" to this page.\n\nMATALGA....began their journey with Odeh Ibn Issa Karadsheh (hereon Matalka). The name Matalka was derived from two Arabic words \"Ma\" and \"Talga\". Ma in arabic means No and Talga means divorce in effect the words mean \"no divorce\". There is a story about how Odeh was labeled Matalga. He was a very generous man, his house was always open to neighboring friends who are invited to trade their goods. Odeh would invite them to eat Mansaf. Once they are finished he would ask them to eat more, as was the custom in Madaba. The guests would say \"no thank you we are full\". He would respond \"Eat, Eat, if you don't eat I would divorce my left arm from its socket\". The guests would appease him and eat more and say \"Ma Talga\". Meaning you need not divorce your arm from its socket. The name Matalga and later Matalka caught on.
