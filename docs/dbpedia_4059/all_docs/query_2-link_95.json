        "text": "September 21, 1946 – December 14, 2019\n\nTom was born on September 21, 1946 in Omaha, Nebraska. He attended Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic School through 8th grade, Arch Bishop Ryan High School for 2 years, then moved to Millard and graduated from Millard High School. He completed a year of college before starting his career as a salesman in the food industry. This would be his career for over 40 years.\n\nTom married Diane on September 14, 1968. They had 2 kids, Eric & Jill. Tom spent many years and countless hours serving others as a football & baseball coach and scout leader. Long after Eric quit Cub Scouts as a young boy, Tom ran the pinewood derby track for hundreds of troops, as he had the only digital read-out finish line track in the city of Omaha.\n\nThough Tom had many titles of son, brother, husband, dad, & coach– to name a just few– his favorite title of all was grandpa. He loved being a grandpa to his 6 grandkids: Jackson, Madeline, Allison, Trevor, Cruz & Lola. His favorite thing to do was watch them shine in their sports and activities. They couldn’t have asked for a better grandpa.\n\nTom enjoyed fishing in his free time. For many years, he had a yearly fishing trip to Canada with his friends. He treasured that time with his dear friends. He was also known for his green thumb.\n\nIn December of 2007, Tom got a bacterial infection. This infection took his kidney function. After a year and a half of dialysis, Tom’s brother, Bob, gave him a kidney. For this, we are forever grateful, as it gave Tom another 10 years of living a good life. Because of this, Tom was able to see his last 2 grandchildren be born and do what he loved most: watch his grandkids in hundreds of sporting events. With the immuno-suppressive drugs from his transplant, Tom battled—and beat– lots of obstacles, including open-heart surgery, brain surgery, and sepsis 4 times. In November of 2019, Tom got another bacterial infection. This would prove to be the one that was too much. He fought for a long month before giving in to this illness.\n\nTom was a wonderful person with many great qualities: dependable, genuine, hard-working, and even-keeled. He will be forever missed by all who knew him. May he rest in peace."
