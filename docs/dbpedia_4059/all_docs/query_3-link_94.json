Hopefully I will make a Community Playlist with the best songs that you've put forward. If everyone could put forward 2 or 3 songs of their choice just to get the playlist started that would be fantastic!\n\nHave been developing a list for all of us who listen House Music in the car, studying, working, high, taking a bath, having a drink with friends and pretty much always...\n\nThe list is being updated periodically, only best tracks are being filtered. Latest music at the end of the list!\n\nLay down and relax!\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/kareenhanna/playlist/4WP8AgcYGMYo60NIAsy1Ff\n\nheyyyy\n\nJust went to Clockenflap last night, an art and music festival in Hong Kong, and discovered an Indonesian indie band with super long songs (14:00~) with few lyrics and chill beats. They were great live and I just added one of their songs to my chill playlist.\n\nCheck out the band The Trees and The Wild and their song Empati Tamako\n\nanielle\n\nYeah, they were great live.\n\nThat band introduced me to Indonesian music so I don't know much else, but I just found another band you may have heard of if you're already a fan, called Barasuara. If you haven't heard them they're pretty good too.\n\nanielle\n\nYeah, of course, no problem!\n\nI'm following your Spotify account already, but do you have any recommendations for me?\n\nI range from mainstream pop indie like Passion Pit to this easy-listening folk indie from Indonesia.\n\nanielle"
