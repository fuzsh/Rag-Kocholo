OLSON (d. 1923) CHARLES OLSON, 31, MEETS DEATH IN AUTO ACCIDENT FATALLY BURNED WHEN GAS TANK EXPLODES AS CAR STRUCK FROM BEHIND Unusual circumstances of the Tragedy Lead to Probe by the District Attorney- Charles F. Olson, 31, is dead and Harry Wuellner, 26, is a patient at the hospital suffering from severe burns inflicted when he attempted to rescue Olson who was literally burned alive under the wrecked Ford car in which the two were driving when the gas tank exploded after the car had been thrown from the road when hit from the rear by another car, the driver of which has not been identified. Olson survived his burns four hours, death resulting at the hospital where he was removed, at 5:45 this morning. Circumstances attending the tragedy are being investigated by Distric Atty. Charles E. Brady who is seeking to learn the identity of the unknown car which is said to have struck the Olson machine and forced it from the road. The driver of the car, according to Wuellner, made no move to stop and disappeared in the darkness so rapidly that the number could not be secured. Supporting Wuellner's statement of the collision from the rear is the fact that the car driven by Olson had a crushed left wheel and its fender was torn off. Clothing Ignited by Oil The accident happened one-half mile west of the Sogge corner, on a cut over road from the Shoto road to the Town Line, about 1 o'clock this morning. Olson was driving a Ford touring car owned by Andrew Beck of the Addison hotel by whom Olson was employed. According to Wuellner a big car coming from the rear struck the Ford in attempting to pass it and the smaller car was overturned in the ditch. As the car turned over there was an explosion and the unfortunate man, pinned under the car, was literally roasted alive, his clothing having been almost completely burned from his body which was a mass of raw flesh when Wuellner finally succeeded in freeing him and wrapping him in his coat. Olson was unconscious, when taken from under the car. Started To Carry Olson After pulling Olson from under the car and wrapping the injured man in his coat Wuellner made his way to the Sogge place and telephoned Dr. Luhman of the accident requesting the physician to be at the hospital when Olson reached here. He returned to the scene of the wrecked machine and had evidentally started to carry Olson to the Sogge place when he was overcome and a few moments later Ray and Clement Scott and James Dorey found the two on the road. Wuellner asked them to take Olson to the hospital and he would follow later. This was done and the speeding car, which was halted by Officer Darbant on its way because of its speed, was permitted to proceed when the officer learned of its mission. Wuellner, who today does not recall clearly the incidents when he dispatched his injured associate to the hospital, reached the Sogge place in an exhausted condition and was brought to the hospital by E. Sogge, proprietor of the Outside Inn. Mr. Sogge at the occasion of the first visit of Wuellner to the place, did not grasp the seriousness of the accident and Wuellner did not wait long enough to secure aid probably believing that he could convey Olson that far without help. At the hospital it was found that Olson's burns were of a character that gave no hope of his surviving, every portion of the body having been burned, the flesh in many places being completely burned away. Everything possible was done to relieve the suffering of Olson but the shock and burns was too much and death came a few hours later. Wuellner Severely Burned Although at the time Wuellner did not realize it, he was severely burned in his efforts to rescue Olson from under the car. At the hospital it was found that his left arm to the elbow was a mass of wounds and his face and right arm were seriously burned so that he will be confined at the hospital for some time, although his condition is not thought dangerous and he may not suffer permanent scars. Olson's Parents Dead Charles Olson, victim of the tragedy had made his home here most of his life. He was 31 years of age and born at Butte, Mont., being a son of the late Charles Olson, who for years conducted the Virginia buffet on Commercial street. Both of his parents are dead and Olson made his home with an uncle Louis Olson, Commercial street. He is survived by two sisters, Mrs. Agnes Kosnick and Mrs. Eva Wilson, both of Chicago. Mrs. Wilson recently visited here and Mrs. Olson, aunt of the young man, returned to Chicago with her. Wuellner, who was the companion of Olson when the accident happened, is a son of Henry Wuellner. His injuries are not serious and he will be able to be out in a few days. The two young men had spent Sunday evening together and shortly before midnight returned to the Addison House and Olson asked Mr. Beck for permission to use the latter's Ford touring car, saying that the men were accompanied by two girls whom they desired to take home. After leaving the girls the two men drove out the Shoto road and were cutting across to the Green Bay road to return to the city when the accident happened. Funeral arrangements for Olson have not been completed, awaiting word from his sisters who are expected here this evening. Manitowoc Herald News, Manitowoc, Wis.
