Dixon” left with the ship, because I have only the briefest of records for him.\n\nCity of Delhi\n\n* 11 Nov 1948 – Incoming crew list – Fremantle (from Beira) – PP1/1\n\n* 15 Jan 1949 (or thereabouts) – Outgoing crew list – Fremantle (for UK and Continent) – PP1/1\n\nLanarkshire\n\n* 14 Nov 1948 – Incoming crew list – Fremantle (from Mauritius) – PP1/1\n\n* 30 Dec 1948 – Outgoing crew list – Fremantle (for Liverpool) – PP1/1\n\nIncharran\n\nNote that the Incharran was a British-registered ship (or rather a Hong Kong-registered British ship) with a largely Chinese crew, hence there is a reasonable chance it would be required to register its crew movements between Australia and Hobart. If so, this may be precisely what we need, because I think – putting all the pieces together – that there’s a good chance the Somerton Man came across from Tasmania on the Incharran on the 29th November 1948.\n\n* 18 Nov 1948 – Incoming crew list – [*] Port Pirie (from Risdon) – D3064\n\n* 18 Nov 1948 – Outgoing crew list – [*] Port Pirie (for Risdon) – D3064\n\n* 23 Nov 1948 – Incoming crew list – [*] Risdon (from Port Pirie) – P2005\n\n* 24 Nov 1948 – Outgoing crew list – [*] Risdon (for Port Pirie) – P2004\n\n* 29 Nov 1948 – Incoming crew list – [*] Port Pirie (from Risdon) – D3064\n\n* 09 Dec 1948 – Outgoing crew list – [*] Port Adelaide (for Risdon) – D3064\n\nDesertions and Discharges\n\nIf the Somerton Man was a merchant seaman working in Tasmania, and had to go on some kind of sick leave, then this would very probably have been recorded in a ledger. The one I’d particularly like to check for October – December 1948 is:-\n\n* Tasmanian desertions for this period in P2562, VOLUME 1 at the NAA (held in Hobart).\n\nCompany Archives\n\nElectrolytic Zinc Company at Risdon\n\nIf the Somerton Man was a wharfie or longshoreman (rather than a merchant seaman) working at the Electrolytic Zinc plant in Risdon, then there is a good chance that we might find his details among the company’s personnel files."
