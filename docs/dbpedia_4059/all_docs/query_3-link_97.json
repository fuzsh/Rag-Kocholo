Jirikowic, veteran of the World war, who escaped the enemys bullets overseas, lost his last battle today to death, his demise being directly traceable to ravages of the war, in which his health was shattered during service with the United States forces. Mr. Jirikowic died at the family home at 910 Hancock street, at 5 oclock this morning after a lingering illness against which he made a brave fight. Mr. Jirikowic is a brother-in-law of Major Edward Schmidt and a son of the late Joseph Jirikowic. He was born in this city January 20, 1896, being 28 at his death, and attended the local schools and graduated with the class of 1915.

He served throughout the war and was mustered out of service February 29, 1920, at Fort Bayard, N.M. Following his service Mr. Jirikowics health failed and for many months he has been fighting to regain lost ground but without result and of late his condition had become such as to cause abandonment of hope and early this morning the end came.

Jesus was there when you fought your fight, He is going to bring you through. Jesus knew when you shed those tears, you did not weep alone. The burdens you thought too heavy to bear. He made them His very own. Jesus Himself was touched by that trial, you could not understand. Jesus stood by as you almost fell and lovingly clasped your hand. Jesus cared when you bore that pain, indeed, He bore it too. He felt each pain, each ache in your heart, because of His love for you. Jesus, your Saviour, will always be with you, no need to be anxious or fret. Wonderful love, He will be there all the time, He has never forsaken you yet. Herald Times Reporter, March 25, 1996 P.

She was born in Newport, England and came to this country in 1851. After a brief residence in Troy, N.Y. the family came to this county where the deceased has since resided. She was the mother of thirteen children, five of whom with her aged husband survive her. In the earlier time of this city Mrs. Johns was a very active woman in the community. No one was so ready to help in time of trouble as she, no one could more effectively minister to the necessities of the sick or could better console those from whom death had removed loved ones. Her life was no smooth journey. Trouble came often and bore heavily upon her but no sorrow dimmed her faith in Jesus. For over fifty years she was a consistent member of the Presbyterian church. For a number of years she has been an invalid and unable to attend services but her heart was with God's people. She longed for release from pain and \"___saw no messenger of gloom in him whom we call Death; nor met her doom. As prisoner his sentence; but naturally as ????? ??? untolds to ?????.

During the past ????e months there have occurred ten deaths among our two hundred odd inmates as follows: July 5, 1916-Thomas Nash of cancer of rectum, aged 65 years.[Evergreen, Manitowoc] Aug. 14, 1916-Mary Heindl of valvular heart disease, 88 years.[Evergreen, Manitowoc] Sept. 7, 1916-William Welsh of aortic insufficiency, 55 years.

[Wiedeman Wasten-Evergreen, Manitowoc] June 27, 1917-CATHERINE JOHNS, of arteric sclerosis, 76 years.[Evergreen, Manitowoc] Since the last report a portion of the Klingholz farm, lately purchased by the asylum has been set aside for a cemetery for the interment of those inmates dying, and unclaimed by relatives or friends. Under the humane management of Supt. Drews the patients are made as comfortable as possible under the circumstances. The systematic running of the farm furnishes an abundance of meat and vegetables, enough and to spare. To Mrs. Drews, the matron, praise is due for the efficient care of the kitchen and the preparation of plenty of plain but nourishing food. The many years of service the attendants have been employed testifies to their efficiency and trustworthiness in the care of the unfortunates. And lastly too much praise can not be bestowed to the trustees for the painstaking manner of the performance devolving upon them. For these various reasons our county asylum is ever acknowledged as one of the best in the state. Respectfully submitted. Louis Falge, M.D. Upon motion of Mr. Gennrich, the report was adopted unanimously upon roll call.

Miss Johns was 78 years old and was born at Newport, Wales, coming to this country with her parents when but a child. For many years she made this city her home, living alone in a home on North Seventh street. She is survived by two sisters, Mrs. Elizabeth Robinson of Baraboo and Mrs. Ruth Spaulsbury of Sawyer and one brother, William Johns, who is an inmate of the Odd Fellows Home at Green Bay. The funeral arrangements will be announced later. Manitowoc Herald News, July 25, 1921 P. 8 ******* Miss Sarah Johns died at the county hospital last Sunday evening. She was born at Newport, Wales, 78 years ago and came to this country with her parents when a child and lived here ever since. She is survived by two sisters, Elizabeth Robinson of Pewaukee, Ruth Spaulsbury of Sturgeon Bay and a brother, William Johns of Green Bay. The funeral was held Wednesday afternoon with interment at Evergreen. The life of Miss Johns is worthy the pen of a Balsac or Maupasant. When a young woman, a disease left her disfigured, hopelessly crippled and stone deaf. For over fifty years she bore up under these afflictions with an almost incredible Christian fortitude and for many years earned her own living and paid her own way. Her faith was no veneer. She loved her bible and was a profound student of it. Those who knew her best respected and admired her despite the eccentricities natural to her condition. When nature could stand no more in her age and her reason sagged under the strain a few friends learned from her irrational talk the romance of her early life, the tragic fact that she had been waiting all these long years for the return of a young man, sleeping on a southern battlefield, over a half century waiting and actually expecting but in terror that her physical condition would alter his feeling toward her. If the account is balanced in the other side, this woman is at last happy. Manitowoc Pilot, Thurs., July 28, 1921 ******* Miss (sic) Elizabeth Robinson who was here for the funeral of her sister, Miss Sarah Johns, has returned to her home at Pewaukee. Her brother William, who resides at Green Bay and was here for the same purpose, accompanied Mrs. Robinson for a visit at Pewaukee.
