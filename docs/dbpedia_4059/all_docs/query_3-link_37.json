As a musician, she is primarily known as a singer and flutist for the alternative rock band \"Hey Ocean!\" (2004-). As a voice actress she is primarily known for voicing two of the main characters of the long-running fantasy series \"My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic\" (2010-2019). She voiced the stubborn apple farmer Applejack and the overconfident speedster Rainbow Dash, both of them being tomboy characters. Ball voiced alternate reality versions of the two characters in four \"Equestria Girls\" films (2013-2016) and several television specials. These versions were depicted as adolescent musicians, with emerging magical powers.\n\nBall's first significant voice role was that of adolescent inventor Mary Test in the science fantasy series \"Johhny Test\". She voiced the character from 2006 to 2014, while the character was previously voiced by Brittney Wilson. For the same series, Ball voiced the character of Sissy Blakley, who served as both a rival and a love interest to the protagonist.\n\nBall voiced the accident-prone Oopsy Bear in the short-lived series \"Care Bears: Adventures in Care-a-lot\" (2007-2008). It was the third television series based on the \"Care Bares\" franchise. Oopsy had been introduced in the computer-animated film \"Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!\" (2007), with Ball as his voice actress.\n\nIn 2008, Ball voiced recurring antagonist Kirstee in the second and last season of the series \"Bratz\" (2005-2008). Ball replaced Kaley Cuoco, who had voiced the character in the first season. Kirstee worked as an intern for fashion magazine \"Your Thing\", while the protagonists worked for a rival magazine. They antagonized each other for both personal and professional reasons.\n\nBall had the recurring role of Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff in the second season of the superhero series \"Iron Man: Armored Adventures\" (2009-2012). This version of the character was initially depicted as a professional thief. After being captured by the covert organization SHIELD, she was recruited into their ranks. She had been given the option of either working for them, or serving a long prison sentence.\n\nBall voiced regular character Plum Pudding in \"Strawberry Shortcake's Berry Bitty Adventures\" (2010-2015). Her character was depicted as a professional dancer and the owner of her own dance studio. Plum had a competitive streak, and a quick temper. Ball also voiced Princess Allura in \"Voltron Force\" (2011-2012). This version of the character struggled between her duties as a pilot and as a head of state for the planet Arus. She eventually chose her niece Larmina as a replacement pilot.\n\nBall voiced co-protagonist Princess Talia in the English version of the magical girl series \"LoliRock\" (2014-2017). Talia was depicted as the most serious, disciplined, intelligent, and goal-oriented member of a team of magical girls. She blamed herself because her older sister Izira was defeated and captured by a foe, while Talia was attending a festival. She figured that she had to train hard in order to avenge her sister.\n\nBy 2022, Ball was 39-years-old. She has gained a cult following for her relatively high-profile voice roles. Fans of her voice acting have at times become interested in her music releases, and she has performed music at fan conventions. She has never stopped working regularly, and she seems to have no plans to retire yet.\n\nFor over three decades, Nancy Cartwright has given voice to a spikey-headed-10-year-old boy even though she's a grown woman; she's often been arrested for truancy and vandalism, yet she maintains a spotless criminal record; and finally, she's repeated the fourth-grade dozens of times in spite of earning her college degree. How has she managed to live this double life? Read on, man.\n\nAs the voice of Bart Simpson, Nancy quite literally breathed life into one the most groundbreaking characters in entertainment history. But she is also responsible for an array of other characters on The Simpsons, making her a versatile performer who's proved invaluable to the longest-running scripted show of all time.\n\nNot that her career begins and ends in Springfield-far from it. Nancy has lent her voice to a myriad of other animated touchstones, from Kim Possible to Rugrats, as well as live-action films, video games, radio and commercials.\n\nKettering, Ohio is the place where a young Nancy discovered her knack for voices and sound effects. In high school, she was a member of the theater department; played in the orchestra and marching band; and entered public speaking competitions. After winning the National District Tournament's \"Humorous Interpretation\" category-twice-the judges steered her towards cartoon voices.\n\nBy 1976, before attending Ohio University on a full scholarship, Nancy was already doing professional voice work for WING radio in her hometown. It really paid off in full when a rep from Warner Bros. Records visited the station and shared a list of animation industry contacts. She zeroed in on the superstar among them: Daws Butler, an industry legend who supplied the voices of Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Elroy Jetson, and dozens of other beloved characters Nancy grew up watching.\n\nNancy left Ohio in 1978 and transferred to UCLA so she could be closer to her mentor and the animation industry. Each Sunday, she would catch the bus to Daws' home in Beverly Hills for lessons. They lasted all afternoon-a real dream-in-the-making.\n\nSoon Butler brought her into the fold at Hanna-Barbera, where she met front-running voice actors and directors. Within a couple months, Nancy was cast as \"Gloria\" of the Richie Rich cartoon series. She the girlfriend of the show's titular character-a genuine Hollywood voice-acting job. No more bus rides for our Miss Nancy-now she was ridin' in style in a '68 Opel Kadette that looked like a smashed potato and appropriately named \"Spud\". It floored at 40 mph, but Nancy didn't care-she had her own wheels!\n\nAfter that, she was on her way to becoming one of the most legendary voice actors of our generation... but she didn't know it, just yet.\n\nNancy signed with a talent agency, completed her theater degree, and promptly landed her first feature film role, in Joe Dante's Twilight Zone: The Movie. More voice acting parts followed: the cartoon series Pound Puppies, Popeye and Son and My Little Pony, plus voice-over background work in Silverado (1985), Sixteen Candles (1984) and The Color Purple (1985), to name a few. Even minor parts, like the shoe that got dipped in acid in the hybrid live-action/animated classic Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) represented opportunities to expand her range.\n\nMeanwhile, an animator named Matt Groening was working on a series of shorts, slated to run as interstitials for The Tracey Ullman Show. His concept involved a dysfunctional family with three kids. Initially, Nancy planned to audition for the role of the classic middle child, Lisa, but felt unmoved by Groening's character description. She was drawn to the troublemaker son, Bart, and asked to audition for that role instead. The rest is history as she was cast on the spot.\n\nIt was a fine addition to her résumé. Then, two years after Groening's original shorts debuted on The Tracey Ullman Show, a breakthrough: Fox greenlit the sketches as a standalone half-hour animated sitcom. The Simpsons premiered on December 17, 1989. Early episodes centered around Bart, and he proved to be the show's breakout star. His slacker antics and catchphrases begged to be quoted-and licensed. Less than six months after the show's debut, The New York Times reported on \"Bartmania,\" quoting exasperated retailers who couldn't get enough merchandise to meet demand. Bart-and, by proxy, Nancy-had officially been catapulted into the zeitgeist.\n\nCartwright is also the unique voice behind several other Simpsons' characters, including Ralph Wiggum, Nelson Muntz, Todd Flanders, Kearney, Database and Maggie. In keeping with her history of playing popular characters on such animated series as Snorks; Animaniacs; and Pinky and The Brain, Nancy also became a hit with the millennials as the voice of Chuckie in Rugrats and Rufus-the naked mole rat-in Kim Possible.\n\nIn the middle of all this animation, Nancy had immersed herself in a scene study class for theatrical/film productions. Her curiosity and drive to create memorable characters led her on an adventure to Italy to find legendary Italian director, Federico Fellini. His \"La Strada\" intrigued our young actress so much that upon her return, she developed her journey as a one-woman show, garnering a DramaLogue Award in 1996. Fast-forward to 2017 when In Search of Fellini, the film, went on to achieve official selections with 9 film festivals. The New York Times raved that ISOF is \"a charming drama about the love of movies and youthful passion.\" The film won Best Director, Best Actress and Best Film in the Ferrara Film Festival 2017.\n\nSome of her work on television series and movies includes Fame, Empty Nest, Cheers, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Twilight Zone-The Movie and Godzilla, as well as a lead in the TV movie Marian Rose White.\n\nIn 1992, Nancy won a Prime Time Emmy® for outstanding Voice-Over performance for The Simpsons. Three years later, she coveted The Annie Award for Voice Acting in the Field of Animation also for The Simpsons. In 2004, Nancy was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for Kim Possible and again in 2020 for The Simpsons.\n\nIn 2001, Nancy co-created and produced The Kelly's-one of the first critically-acclaimed digital animated series in conjunction with Turner Broadcasting and NASCAR. At a top speed of 158.2 mph, Nancy is no spectator in the world of fast cars. Emboldened to continue writing and producing, Nancy penned her first episode of The Simpsons titled Girl's In the Band. It aired in the Spring of 2019 and was one of the highest-rated episodes of the season- Ay Caramba!\n\nIn 2004, Nancy's audiobook, My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, was nominated for the prestigious Audie Award. The release of the audiobook led to her one-woman show that premiered at The Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2004 to SRO crowds for the entire run of the production. The new-and-improved edition of her audiobook, I'm Still a 10-Year-Old Boy will be available late 2021. In 2020 Nancy co-created a new production company in addition to Spotted Cow Entertainment. She called the new venture CRE84U, a production company dedicated to producing international content for television with long-time partner, Monica Gil-Rodriguez, and partners Carolina and Jaime Aymerich.\n\nAlways with the sincere compassion to give back, Nancy has been the honorary mayor of her community for the past 16 years. She is the recipient of the Fernando Award presented to those whose community support is above and beyond. She has supported many non-profit organizations that focus on helping children, such as Famous Fone Friends, The Way to Happiness Foundation and The Citizens Commission on Human Rights. She also received the prestigious Icon Award from The Make-A-Wish Foundation. An accomplished self-taught fine artist, Cartwright has created dozens of reverse-style paintings on Lucite. Although this reverse-painting technique dates back thousands of years, it was the The Simpsons that motivated her to duplicate this animation technique that was popularized in 1937 with Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nHer work has been featured on over 300 billboards, bus wraps and bus shelter posters with the purpose of introducing parents and caretakers to the Know More About Drugs Alliance.\n\nSince its inception in 2004, Nancy has been the proud co-founder of Happy House, a non-profit organization dedicated to \"Building Better Families\". Through extensive outreach and the help of countless volunteers, Happy House is implementing a character-building program, How to Make Good Choices, to hundreds of children across California. Nancy is equally committed to helping those in her hometown where she has established a perpetual scholarship for forensic students to attend Ohio University. In June 2012, Ohio University bestowed upon Nancy an Honorary Degree Citation - Doctor of Communication in recognition of achievement in her field as an actress, as a philanthropist and through her scholarship endowment established at Ohio University.\n\nIn 2020, Nancy became the first ever voice-actor to be featured on MasterClass-- a platform where members learn from the best across multiple disciplines. Joining the likes of \"Masters\" James Cameron, Ron Howard and Annie Leibovitz, Nancy's class introduces aspiring voice-actors to the voice-over medium.\n\nClearly, Nancy Cartwright's journey is inimitable. She's at once a cultural icon and a face in the crowd, a megastar who walks the streets without being mobbed...an anonymous celebrity. Not too shabby for a spunky kid from Kettering, Ohio.\n\nSo, don't have a cow, man!\n\nShannon Chan-Kent is a Canadian actress and soprano singer from Vancouver, British Columbia. She has performed with the Vancouver Metropolitan Orchestra. She has often worked as a voice actress in animation. Her best known role was providing the singing voice of the regular character Pinkie Pie in the fantasy series \"My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic\" (2010-2019). In the same series, she provided the regular voices of the recurring antagonist Silver Spoon and the female dragon Smolder. Chan-Kent also voiced several significant characters in the spin-off series \"Equestria Girls\".\n\nChan-Kent voiced Misa Amane in the English dub of \"Death Note\" (2006-2007). Misa was depicted as a young model with traumatic experiences, who gained the eyes of a Shinigami (death spirit). At the cost of shortening her own life span, Misa could learn a person's real name and lifespan just by looking at their face. She used this ability to feed information to the supernatural serial killer Kira/ Light Yagami, due to her unrequited love for him and her agreement with his vigilantism. Kira viewed her only as a useful tool instead of a love interest.\n\nChan-Kent voiced Christina Sierra in \"Mobile Suit Gundam 00\" (2007-2009). Christina was a computer programmer aboard the mothership \"Ptolemaios\", and was previously a runaway from an unnamed space colony. Christina was repeatedly trying to befriend her introverted co-worker Feldt Grace and to spend private time with her, despite their different personalities and interests. Christina was eventually killed in action, using her dying moments to offer life advise to Feldt. Feldt mourned the loss of her closest friend.\n\nIn \"Strawberry Shortcake's Berry Bitty Adventures\" (2010-2013), Chan-Kent voiced the regular character Cherry Jam. The character was depicted as a semi-retired professional singer, who had just started a new career as a music teacher. She had reportedly tired of constant music tours, and was seeking to settle down and to develop closer bonds with her new friends. Cherry enjoyed having a less hectic lifestyle than the one she previously experienced, and found joy in simple things.\n\nChan-Kent voiced Larmina, the Blue Lion pilot in \"Voltron Force\" (2011-2012). The character was the niece of Princess Allura (voiced by Ashleigh Ball) and a replacement pilot for her aunt. Larmina was an entirely new addition to the Voltron franchise's cast. This series lasted for a single season and 26 episodes, ending on a cliffhanger. A planned second season was never produced due to budget problems.\n\nChan-Kent voiced Beatrice \"Trixie\" Sting in the science fiction series \"Slugterra\" (2012-2016). The character was a female member of the Shane Gang, and served as a strategist for her team. Trixie viewed her teammates as her surrogate family, and tried to convince her secretive teammate Eli Shane to confide to her about his mysterious past. Trixie had aspirations to become a documentary filmmaker.\n\nChan-Kent voiced the antagonist Lemon Zest in the animated film \"My Little Pony: Equestria Girls - Friendship Games\" (2015). The character was a leading member of the Crystal Prep Academy Shadowbolts. She and her teammates obsessively pursued victory at an academic and sporting competition, serving as the rival team to the film's protagonists. Lemon was portrayed as a rock music enthusiast, and as rather insensitive to the needs and emotions of her teammate Twilight Sparkle. In a moment of danger towards the film's ending, Lemon helped in pulling to safety both Rarity (one of her rivals at the contest) and Fleur de Lis (one of Lemon's classmates).\n\nChan-Kent voiced the antagonist Wallflower Blush in the television special \"My Little Pony: Equestria Girls - Forgotten Friendship\" (2018). Wallflower was depicted as a lonely girl, who kept being forgotten by people with whom she interacted regularly. She eventually gained a magical artifact which could erase or modify the memories of others. So she decided to take revenge on the popular girl Sunset Shimmer, by using this power to isolate Sunset from her friends and to turn her into a social outcast (like Wallflower herself).\n\nChan-Kent performed the singing voice of returning antagonist Sonata Dusk in the animated special \"My Little Pony: Equestria Girls - Sunset's Backstage Pass\" (2019). As before, Sonata was depicted as a formerly powerful siren who has been exiled into a human world and transformed into a human. In the special, Sonata and her depowered teammates were pursuing careers as music performers. Their old enemy Sunset Shimmer accused the sirens of being responsible for a mysterious time loop. The sirens revealed that they have had no access to magic for quite some time, and were not aware of any magic plot.\n\nChan-Kent has been announced as the new voice actress of the anthropomorphic hedgehog Amy Rose in the upcoming series \"Sonic Prime\" (2022-). Amy is typically depicted as Sonic's self-proclaimed girlfriend. Her signature weapon is a hammer, which she typically uses as a melee weapon. By 2022, Chan-Kent was 34-years. She seems to have no plans to retire yet."
