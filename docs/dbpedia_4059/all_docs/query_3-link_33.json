MOORE HAVEN, Feb. 14. - Winfield Scott, aged about 60, came to Moore, Haven. In July, 1918, from Chicago, where he had lived many years. He was a bachelor and, according to his own statement, had lived a life of a recluse. His home was where he slept, and he slept where darkness overtook him. he had paved up a neat sum of money and kept it on deposit in a Chicago saving bank. The cold winters of the north were too much for him and he came to Moore Haven to spend the balance of his days. He looked over the county and finally bought two acres of the finest land near Moore Haven. He made the deal with M. F. George, a local real estate agent, and took possession of it at once. He arranged with the Bank of Moore Haven to transfer from the Chicago bank enough of his deposits to pay for the land he had bought and to make needed improvements and went to work.\n\nOne day he was bitten by some small insect in the neck, and from that bite blood poison set in from the affects of which he died August,16, 1918 at Hotel Newell In Moore Haven. He was buried on a spot donated by Mrs. O'Brien, Moore Haven's mayor. Just before he died he called the bystanders to be witnesses to his will, as to how his property should be distributed, and which was in the following words: \"I wish my property to go to my two nephews, sons of my brother.\" This was reduced to writing and signed by the witnesses, and after his death was deposited in the local bank for safekeeping. He had frequently stated to his friends when in good health that he wanted his nephews to have his property when he died. His only relatives were those two nephews, Murray W. Scott, of Stark county, Ohio, and David H. Scott, state senator for Hamilton county, Ohio - and a married sister, Mrs. Merrett Fawcett, who resides in Portland, Ore. He died before his money was received at Moore Haven to pay for his land, and, there being no written contract of sale, the deal was not consummated. His property consists of money in bank in Chicago and some lots in the city, amount and value of which is unknown. A public administrator has been appointed to take charge of the estate in Chicago, and the will is being probated in DeSoto county, Florida, where he died, and will be the basis on which the property will be distributed after the payment of his debts.

Dr. Shields had been living at the Texas resort for almost a year seeking to benefit his health through the waters of the famous springs there. Burial was made at that place.\n\nDr. Shields was well known throughout the State of New Mexico, having been a resident for many years. His first charge was at Las Cruces in 1893, one year after his ordination as a priest of the Episcopal Church. In 1894 he went to Chicago where he remained for five years. In 1899 he returned to New Mexico to take charge of the mission at Jemez Hot Springs, from which point the removed to the Upper Gila and later to Bisbee, Arizona, where he remained until 1908 when he was sent by his bishop to the church at Dawson, New Mexico. Dr. Shields was always prominent in public affairs notwithstanding his calling. He was a man of more than ordinary ability and well liked by all who knew him. He was elected member of the board of county commissioners of Colfax County in 1911, and was chosen chairman of the board, a position which he held at the time of his death. Dr. Shields was also prominent in the good roads movement and for several years was vice-president of the National Highways Association. He is survived by a widow.
