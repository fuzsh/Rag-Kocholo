        "text": "Eric J. Van Riper, age 46, of Ann Arbor, MI, passed away on March 31, 2022 at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI with his family by his side. Eric was born on February 17, 1976 in Kewanee, Illinois to Jay G. and Sharon K. (Berg) Van Riper.\n\nSoon after his mom’s death, he moved to Ann Arbor from Illinois. Beginning at the age of seven, he came to live with Steve and Becky (Van Riper) Schultz as one of their own. On their farm is where his love of the outdoors was cultivated. He attended both Salem Lutheran School and Dexter Community Schools. His love of NASCAR took him on a journey working on a pit crew when he was younger while also working construction. He loved his current job and fellow employees working security at Costco. His days were filled with hunting, fishing, snowmobiling and anything else outdoors. He loved to fly, and he learned how to be a glider pilot. He also enjoyed spending time with family and friends, whether it was on the farm, traveling or on the boat with the McTaggart Family.\n\nEric is survived by his father, Steve Schultz of Ann Arbor, sisters, Nicole (George) Bollinger of South Lyon and Michele McGinnis of Illinois, multiple nieces and nephews, including Jessica (James) Lewandowski and Christopher Quillen, great-nephew, Max Lewandowski, his large extended family and former spouse, Laura Van Riper. He was preceded in death by his biological parents, as well as his mom who raised him, Becky Schultz.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the Southeast Michigan Bird Dog Rescue in Flat Rock, Michigan.\n\nVisitation will be held on Tuesday, April 5, 2022 from 5-7 p.m. at the Staffan-Mitchell Funeral Home, Chelsea."
