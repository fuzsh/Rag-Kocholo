Commander Eric Augustus Feldt (1899-1968) was an officer in the Royal Australian Navy. During the Second World War, until 1943, he was the director of the Coastwatchers organization. The Coastwatchers’ task was to monitor Japanese activity in the islands that make up the Solomon Archipelago. Feldt code-named his organization "Ferdinand", a name from a popular children's book about a bull. This audiobook is the account of the Coastwatchers’ many crucial contributions to the war in the Pacific and especially in the Battle for Guadalcanal. US Admiral of the Fleet William F. Halsey is quoted as saying: "The coast watchers saved the Guadalcanal and Guadalcanal saved the South Pacific." Besides vital intelligence gathering, the Coastwatchers’ rescued 321 downed Allied airmen, 280 sailors, 75 prisoners of war, 190 missionaries and civilians, and hundreds of native people.
