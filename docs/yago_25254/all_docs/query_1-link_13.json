        "text": "Charles III was King of Spain from May 1709 until his death on 20 October 1740. In 1700, the Spanish throne became vacant, and Charles's father, Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, claimed it for his younger son (Charles). However, Louis XIV of France claimed it for his grandson, Philip, Duke of Anjou. A war was fought for several years, before negotiations in 1709 resulted in Charles being accepted as King of Spain.\n\nWhen Charles's elder brother Joseph died without sons, some expected Charles to inherit. The merging of Spain and Austria, not seen since Charles V, provoked a negative response from other European Great Powers. Joseph and Charles had signed the Mutual Pact of Succession, while their father was alive, which stated that Joseph's daughters would take precedence over Charles's in the line of succession.\n\nJoseph's daughters were Maria Josepha and Maria Amalia. Maria Amalia was elected Holy Roman Empress following Joseph's death. Her husband was Charles of Bavaria, who would become Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor. However, it was agreed that Maria Josepha's husband, Augustus III, son of the Elected King of Poland and Duke of Saxony, would inherit Austria, Hungary and Bohemia. Tensions ran high between members of the family. Charles VII had agreed to allow Augustus III to rule the personal Hapsburg dominions only to secure peace, but secretly felt he was their rightful ruler. Charles III did not immediately announce his opinion on the succession, but allowed it to go ahead.\n\nThe other Great Powers were also weary of what would happen next. The union of Austria-Hungary-Bohemia with Saxony-Poland-Lithuania under Augustus III made them feel uneasy. However, he did not actually succeed to the latter trio of crowns until 1733, after his father's death.\n\nAnd so in 1733, that's what he did. He succeeded to the throne of Saxony, but in Poland, he was challenged for the throne by Stanisław Leszczyński, a powerful Polish nobleman, backed by France. However, Augustus received the backing of his relatives: Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, and won the throne."
