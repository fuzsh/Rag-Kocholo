        "text": "Finally, after 33 years since the beginning of its restoration, the heart of the Dresden Royal Palace has opened to the public. Nine state rooms, including the audience chamber, which is decorated with one of the most remarkable Italian upholstery velvets we’ve ever produced. And this is its story.\n\nThe eventful history of the Dresden Royal Palace\n\nOn the night of February 13th, 1945, the city of Dresden was subjected to carpet bombings that razed to the ground a large part of the historic center.\n\nOne of the monuments reduced to rubble was the Royal Palace, a Renaissance building which dates back to the 1400s. But it was Augustus II the Strong, king of Poland and prince-elector of Saxony, three centuries later that transformed it into a late-Baroque masterpiece.\n\nHe had visited Versailles when he was young, and its grandeur had fascinated him. So, he decided to turn the palace’s state rooms into a worthy competitor to its French model.\n\nRebuilding the palace\n\nAfter the end of the war, the palace repeatedly risked being dismantled: the bombs had burnt it to the ground, only its foundations were still standing. Any attempt to restore it seemed impossible.\n\nBut it was one of the masterpieces of Renaissance in Germany, and this is why people managed to protect it. Finally, in 1986, the local government decided to rebuild it. So, after a long period of research, and the use of substantial financial resources, numerous masters and expert craftsmanship skills, the building has finally returned to its former glory.\n\nThe inauguration date, in 2019, was not chosen by chance. It marks the 300th wedding anniversary of Frederick Augustus, son of Augustus II, and Maria Josepha of Austria, heiress to the Hapsburg Empire.\n\nOn that very occasion, in fact, Augustus II had the royal State Apartments constructed, including a banquet room, two foyers, an audience chamber with the throne and the bedroom with a magnificent imperial bed.\n\nThe restoration of the fabrics and silk velvet of the audience chamber\n\nThe most important of these rooms was the audience chamber, used for representation purposes, where you can find the throne, covered by a canopy. These two elements, as well as the walls and the curtains were made of the same crimson velvet.\n\nIt was in March 2015 when the curator of the restoration project asked us to recreate the upholstery fabrics of this room in the same velvet, faithfully reproducing the technical characteristics and color of the original. She then gave us an authentic sample of the fabric, the only fragment saved from the fire, which our technical director, Emanuele Bevilacqua, carefully analyzed.\n\nIn 2017, the production of crimson velvet began with a fabric height of 52cm, with a total of 5,280 threads of silk organzine between the underlying warp and the hair warp. The weft was also made of silk organzine. There were 101 threads per cm. The red dye was made using cochineal extract, which at the time was the most expensive red available.\n\nTo reconstruct the fabric, faithful in quality and characteristics to the original, a mechanical loom wasn’t enough; it would not produce a pile as thick as the original fabric.\n\nThis is why the State Art Collections of Dresden gave this commission to a traditional fabric manufacturer using the same handlooms employed in the 18th century: Tessitura Bevilacqua."
