        "text": "Painted in 1720, the year she spent in Paris, this portrait by Rosalba Carriera (1673-1757) is of Princess Maria Josepha of Austria (1699-1757). Maria Josepha was the daughter of Joseph I (26 July 1678 – 17 April 1711), Holy Roman Emperor, King of Bohemia, King of Hungary and King of the Romans. This portrait was completed the year after she married Frederick Augustus II, Elector of Saxony (1733-1763), who became King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as August III the Saxon in 1734. This lovely portrait includes fine examples of the jewelry and hair ornaments worn at the time by members of the court.\n\nRosalba Carriera was an Italian portrait painter most well-known for her work in miniatures and pastels.\n\nAs you will quickly notice, this site is a bit old-fashioned in design. The reason for that is 2-fold – I can focus my time on how the site functions (without being too overly dependent on plugins and other programmers) and I can continue putting the focus on the artists and their work."
