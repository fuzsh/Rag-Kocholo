        "text": "I think that the Habsburgs and the Jagiellons had a fair amount of entanglement at some point, so it may be doable. Didn't the Habsburg inherit Bohemia that way?\n\nHowever, I don't the think the Poles (and much less so, the Lithuanians) would be enamoured to the notion of being ruled from Vienna, especially as the relevant time is when the House of Habsburg was busy inheriting Burgundy and Spain as well.\n\nEDIT: if such a union comes out stable and Bohemia is included (which is sorta useful to it staying together) I can see Prague being the capital.\n\nMaria Josepha is the heiress to the Austrian lands in 1740 and she is married to the King of Poland-Lithuania, Augustus III. This brings Saxony into the union as a bonus. If the union is successful against Prussia, then Silesia is retained and perhaps East Prussia is added by conquest.\n\nAfter Augustus III's death his children with Maria Josepha would have had no claims to the Polish throne, although one of them might be elected - quite probable, in case of scuccessful war with Prussia. However, we're talking here about union of absolutist Austria and anti-absolutist PLC. Not a chance, IMHO."
