        "meta_description": "Maria Josepha of Bavaria (1739-1767) was the unloved second wife of Hapsburg Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. The emperor had been devoted to his first wife, Isabella of Parma, who had died of smallpox after three years of marriage, and only married Maria Josepha in 1765 because he had been forced into it for dynastic purposes. Maria Josepha was plain, unsophisticated, but genuinely kind and loving. She did her utmost to be a loving wife to her husband but received only cold rebuffs in return. By his own admission, Joseph simply could not bring himself to love her. After barely two years of marriage she also died of smallpox, like Joseph's first wife, at the age of 28. Joseph never re-married afterwards. This bronze relief portrait of hers stands on her sarcophagus in the Hapsburg Imperial Crypt in Vienna. Ironically, her sarcophagus stands next to Isabella of Parma's, the two wives now lying together in eternity. Joseph's lone sarcophagus lies in another part of the crypt (see my photo of it here: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/alex-david/50560755567/in/album-72157716331777977/\">www.flickr.com/photos/alex-david/50560755567/in/album-721...</a>)",
