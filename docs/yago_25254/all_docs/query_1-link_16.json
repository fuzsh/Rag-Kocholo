How do you see his chances?\n\nWhy not simply let Ludwig of Brandenburg survive? It requires a later POD (1680s for Ludwig to survive, vs. 1660s for Heinrich) - unless you want a 1664 POD for othr reasons. Since I'm guessing Brandenburg and Poland would end up in a PU here? As to Brandenburg troops being better than Saxon ones, AFAIK, it was only in the 18th century that Prussian troops started outstripping them, in the 1660s-1700s Saxon troops were regarded as some of the best in Germany\n\nin the 1660s-1700s Saxon troops were regarded as some of the best in Germany\n\nThey were regarded high, but GNW showed that in fact they were not so good. I've choosen Heinrich survival, because he is carte blanche. Louis' survival could of course give similar results.\n\nWith Hohenzollern on Augustus' place GNW would not happen in OTL shape, Heinrich has less reasons to join the war (hereditary Baltic duchy? He has one already) and if it happens, Heinrich would attack Stettin, not Riga.\n\no\n\nInspired by discussion about Frederick Augustus of Saxony remaining Protestant.

How do you see his chances?\n\nWould Henry be as dependent on foreign support as Augustus was IOTL for his succession?\n\nInteresting, it certainly has more opportunity for synergy as the two realms are in direct contact unlike Saxony which had Silesia between it and Poland. The Swedes would not like it as I'm sure they'd see the threat to Swedish Pomerania and Livonia. Pomerania had been recently occupied (1675) by Brandenburg and only barely recovered by Sweden thanks to French intervention so it would probably be Henry's first target. Truth be told I think it might make a lot of people uneasy as it clearly presents the possibility of a new Baltic power emerging. So Russia and Austria might not be fully on board.\n\nAs to the Radziwill marriage, her family was Calvinist so I'm not sure how well that would work if he converted but then again Frederick Augustus' wife refused to convert and he did all right.\n\nAs to the Radziwill marriage, her family was Calvinist so I'm not sure how well that would work if he converted but then again Frederick Augustus' wife refused to convert and he did all right.\n\nLudwika Karolina died IOTL in 1695 so if nothing changes about it, it would not be problem, and Henry could simply raise their little kids as Catholics (and propably would remarry to Habsburg or Wittelsbach Catholic girl). If he is such opportunist as Hohenzollerns used to be he'll not join any war that do not guarantee easy victory. Also with Henry being King of Poland already, would he push for making also Prussia a kingdom? Two royal crowns for one elector? That seems to be too much.\n\nSeems like Prussia would be sufficient for his purposes as a Duchy. He already has a crown so why create a new one whole cloth. Besides who would be the fount of that honor? I don't think he could get the Emperor to consent and the Polish crown can't create other crowns so he'd just be the self proclaimed but largely unrecognized King of Prussia.\n\nHeinrich of Brandenburg/Henryk II of Poland would be in much better position than Augustus with better army and shared border with PLC. He'd be, in the long run, feared by Habsburgs and Russians. If Henry's son (name him Louis, born in 1692) marries Maria Josepha of Austria like Augustus III did IOTL then now Catholic Hohenzollerns could even claim Imperial throne, something other powers would not be happy about. Henry could trade his support for Maria Theresa (let's go with minimal butterflies) in exchange for Austrian support for election of his son to PLC throne.\n\nHeinrich of Brandenburg/Henryk II of Poland would be in much better position than Augustus with better army and shared border with PLC.

First of all, we need to answer the question if Henry II wants to start GNW and join the alliance with Peter or he doesn't care and wants to strengthen his internal power in PLC first? If he chooses the second option (battle of Olkienniki is a good opportunity to do so, there was even IOTL a paper supposedly made by some Lithuanian nobles called \"postanowienie wileńskie\" which presented the programme to give Augustus an absolute control over the country) than he doesn't need Maria's Theresa's support (because his son is already made King/the throne goes hereditary) and could even start alt-Silesian war.\n\nIt depends on lots of factors.

So I mentioned it, I think that Henry wouldn't even bother with renouncing his rights but would attack nonetheless. But we should start from the very beginning. Even if Peter isn't willing to attack Sweden, it doesn't mean that he wouldn't do anything. Augustus the Strong is still around, so Saxony, Ottomans and Peter could team up against PLC."
