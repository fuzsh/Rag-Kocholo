        "text": "The paintings in this room take us back to the eighteenth century, to the time of Maria Theresa, the great-great-grandmother of Franz Joseph. She reigned from 1740 to 1780 and was married to Franz Stephan of Lorraine, who was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1745 as Franz I. The couple had 16 children, of whom ten survived into adulthood. The four exhibited paintings show Maria Theresa’s children performing on stage.\n\nAs a rule, the imperial couple’s children were encouraged to make music, dance or take part in dramatic entertainments at family celebrations such as birthdays and name-days or weddings. The painting between the windows shows a scene with the three youngest children of Maria Theresa – Ferdinand,\n\nMaria Antonia (the future French queen Marie Antoinette), and Maximilian – from the pastoral ballet Le Triomphe de l’Amour by Pietro Metastasio and Florian Leopold Gassmann that was performed on the occasion of the second marriage of their eldest brother Emperor Joseph II to Josepha of Bavaria in January 1765. The painting hanging opposite shows their elder sisters Maria Josepha, Maria Elisabeth, Maria Amalia and Maria Karolina singing and dancing in the operetta Il parnasso confuso in the roles of Apollo and the Three Muses. The music was composed by Christoph Willibald Gluck to a libretto by Pietro Metastasio.\n\nCOOKIE SETTINGS\n\nHere you can review and adjust the cookie settings used on the domain.
