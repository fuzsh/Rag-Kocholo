        "text": "Rockville, MD and Dallas, TX, June 7, 2002: MacroGenics, Inc., a biotechnology company with operations in both Rockville, MD and Seattle, WA, today announced the acquisition of Eliance Biotechnology, Inc., a private vaccine discovery company located in Dallas, TX, which was founded to exploit technology developed at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (UT Southwestern) Center for Biomedical Inventions (CBI) The company and university also announced the formation of an alliance between MacroGenics and UT Southwestern to enhance discovery and development of immunotherapeutics to prevent and treat cancer and autoimmune and infectious diseases.\n\nThe agreements include: the establishment of a MacroGenics research site in Dallas for infectious disease target identification and development of new methods for genetic immunization; the licensing of a patent portfolio from UT Southwestern related to new vaccine antigens, adjuvants, and methods of immunization; and a multiyear-sponsored research agreement with UT Southwestern in the field of immunobiology. In addition, the Board of Directors at MacroGenics will be expanded to seven members and will include the addition of Mr. Michael S. Richman, EVP and COO at MacroGenics, and Dr. Dennis Stone, VP for technology development at UT Southwestern.\n\nConcurrent with the acquisition of Eliance and agreements with UT Southwestern, MacroGenics raised an additional $12.6 million, led by InterWest Partners, and including investments by MPM Capital, OrbiMed Advisors, STARTech Early Ventures, Cogene Biotech Ventures, Hunt Ventures and Alexandria Realty Equities.\n\nThe acquisition of Eliance and the opportunity to work with Dr. Stephen Johnston and his team at CBI provide a superb complement to the technology being developed at MacroGenics and its collaboration with the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle,\" said Dr. Scott Koenig, president and CEO of MacroGenics. \"We are now well positioned to become a comprehensive immunotherapeutics company. Also, we are gratified by the addition of several Texas-based venture firms to our current group of investors and advisors and look forward to their participation, as we expand the breadth and depth of the company.\"\n\nThe company will add a diversified portfolio of vaccine targets and adjuvants, key patented technologies for the rapid screening of new disease targets, including rapidly emerging agents in bioterrorism, and the tools for developing more effective antibody and vaccine therapeutics to its existing technologies. The company expects to advance many of these targets into clinical testing and seek selective partnerships for both product candidates and the technology.\n\n\"The merger of Eliance and MacroGenics sets a new standard for biotechnology in Dallas and is a major milestone in the local development of this industry.\" said Dr. Dennis Stone of UT Southwestern. \"In addition to the breakthrough vaccine discovery technology of Eliance, the new entity brings to Dallas world class management, top tier biotech venture groups, alliances with The Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle and Dr. Jeffrey Ravetch from the Rockefeller University in New York, and the outstanding development team at MacroGenics' core in Rockville, Maryland.\"\n\n\"We are pleased to have the opportunity to provide additional funds to the outstanding management at MacroGenics,\" said Dr. Arnold Oronsky, General Partner of InterWest Partners. \"The addition of the technologies developed by the teams at UT Southwestern and Eliance will augment the existing assets at MacroGenics and position it to be a major player in the field of immunotherapeutics.\"\n\nAbout the Partnership\n\nThrough its acquisition, MacroGenics will gain the technology to rapidly screen bacteria and viruses that cause human diseases using animal model systems and methods called Expression Library Immunization (ELI) and Linear Expression Elements (LEE), both developed by Dr. Johnston and colleagues, including Dr. Kathryn Sykes, assistant professor of internal medicine at UT Southwestern, now at Eliance.\n\nThese methods have already led to the identification of new vaccine candidates and novel adjuvants for human and veterinary use that will advance into pre-clinical development at MacroGenics. Many of these candidates were unexpected proteins with the potential to protect against common illnesses in humans. New screens to identify protective proteins in many other pathogens are being pursued, including Emerging Disease and Bioterrorism Agents cited by the National Institute of Health.\n\nIn addition, methods have been developed that can efficiently produce antibodies to most human and murine protein antigens, and these will be used to create new diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents for the programs in cancer, autoimmunity and infectious diseases at MacroGenics. New technology in the field of genetic immunization also has been licensed from UT Southwestern and will be thoroughly evaluated in small animals and primates as a way to create multi-valent therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines.\n\nAbout the Agreements\n\nMacroGenics, Inc. and Eliance, Inc, completed a definitive merger agreement under which MacroGenics acquired Eliance through an equity exchange. In addition, MacroGenics, is entering into licensing and sponsored research agreements with the UT Southwestern entitling them to an option to license future technologies in the field of immunobiology under defined terms. In return, Macrogenics exchanged equity and agreed to future milestone and royalty payments on product sales. Licensed technologies included specific targets for immunotherapy, adjuvants and methods of immunization.\n\nAbout MacroGenics\n\nMacroGenics, Inc., is focused on the development of improved immunotherapeutic products based on the discoveries of one of its founders, Dr. Jeffrey Ravetch, and through the identification of new targets for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases in collaboration with MacroGenics' founders, Drs. Leroy Hood, Alan Aderem and Ruedi Aebersold at the Institute for Systems Biology. MacroGenics has a lead antibody candidate to treat autoimmune diseases in pre-clinical development. In addition to developing its own therapeutic products, the company intends to enter into partnerships with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies utilizing its licensed technologies to screen for more effective antibody therapies.
