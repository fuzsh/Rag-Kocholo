        "text": "2.4 Fully Paid-Up License Rights. All Patent and Know-How rights, including RBG Patents rights, granted to RBNV, RBG, and their Affiliates, in pre-existing agreements between or among RBNV, RBG and their Affiliates, are hereby paid-up and royalty-free at the Closing Date. With the exception of (1) any outstanding invoices at Closing, (2) the arrangements specifically made and/or referenced in the Definitive Agreements executed at Signing and/or Closing (such as the profit share for Supervax, the loan repayments, any outstanding accounts payable, any open invoices, and the payments under Section 2.5) and (3) the [ * ] between RBG and RBNV described in the October 1, 2005 Addendum to License Agreement (between RBG and GCVC dated June 30, 1998) with respect to the License and Technology Transfer Agreement between [ * ] sharing arrangement is also referred to at the end of Section 2.5). RBG and RBNV hereby waive all rights to any and all claims to all monies owed under such pre-existing agreements. If RBNV or RBG requests in writing, RBG or RBNV, respectively, shall promptly execute, and deliver to the other, any formal amendment documents confirming the waiver of any monetary obligations owing thereto and/or to its Affiliates and specific to the aforesaid pre-existing documents. Such confirmations must be consistent with this Agreement and the other Definitive Agreements. Such confirmations shall not have any force of effect to the extent inconsistent with this Agreement and/or any of the other Definitive Agreements. 4.3.1.1 The exclusion of Supervax Program Products, Theravax Program Product, Cytovax Program Products and Heplisav Program Products from the foregoing license means (without limitation) that such license does not extend to the making and selling of Hepatitis B surface antigen (or any other ingredient covered by or made using the RBG IP) for inclusion (or under contractual terms that would permit their inclusion) in any Supervax Program Product(s), Theravax Program Product(s), Cytovax Program Product(s) and/or Heplisav Program Product(s). Accordingly, RBNV and their Affiliates shall only supply Hepatitis B surface antigen, made using RBG IP, and such other ingredients to third parties under circumstances in which such third parties (and any entities to which they may transfer such antigen and other ingredients) are legally forbidden and precluded from making Supervax Program Products, Theravax Program Products, Cytovax Program Product and Heplisav Program Products using the supplied quantities of such antigen and other ingredients. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RBNV and its Affiliates shall not be required to amend their existing agreements to comply with the restrictions specified in this Section 4.3.1, but shall exert its reasonable diligent efforts, which do not adversely financially impact RBNV, to include such terms upon amendment thereof and shall include them on any voluntary extension to the relationship (i.e. one that is not required without RBNVs or its Affiliates consent under the contract that exists as of the Closing Date). 4.3.5 RBG Obligation to Secure Third Party Licensor Consent. At RBNVs written request, RBG shall promptly notify each third party licensor of RBG IP, of RBGs obligation under Section 4.3 to sublicense rights in such RBG IP to RBNV, and if consent or amendment under the appropriate license agreement is required, then RBG shall [ * ] to obtain written consent from each such third party licensor. Promptly upon securing each required consent from a third party licensor, if the terms of the consent are acceptable to RBNV, then the Parties shall execute a formal sublicense agreement with RBNV providing for (1) the sublicense of RBG IP rights to RBNV, and (2) the assumption of obligations by RBNV as provided for in such third party license agreements. If any such sublicense requires the payment of monies to the third party licensor (including any payment in the form of an amendment that results in a payment of less money to RBG under the contract than without such amendment), RBNV shall be informed in writing of such potential financial obligation, and RBNV shall be responsible for the payment of all such fees to said third party licensor. RBNV shall be entitled to terminate such sublicense in accordance with its terms, but shall not in this manner be able to avoid responsible for any non-cancelable sublicensing-related fees. 4.3.6 Licensed RBG Patent Maintenance. Given the non-exclusive nature of the license of Section 4.3.1, RBG and Dynavax will be under no requirement to prosecute or maintain RBG Patents, which do not specifically claim [ * ] If RBG and Dynavax elect to abandon any RBG Patent, RBG and/or Dynavax will first give RBNV reasonable notice of such intention and the opportunity to prosecute or maintain such RBG Patent. In this case, optionally, at RBNVs sole discretion, RBNV may do so in its own name; provided that RBG and Dynavax will receive a non-exclusive license to such RBG Patents, consistent with the licenses granted herein and with any pre-existing third party agreements (i.e. if 3rd party obligations exist that apply to the practice of the inventions claimed in the RBG Patents taken over by RBNV, then RBNV must comply with such 3rd party license obligations respecting such practice). If RBG and Dynavax choose, as part of a strategic move, to abandon a particular RBG Patent, which does not claim specifically [ * ] and which would reasonably benefit the RBG Patent portfolio, then the Parties will diligently [ * ] 4.5.2.2 If (a) RBG elects not to file legal proceedings against a third party within [ * ] such possible infringing activities, and has not engaged in, or has terminated, reasonably diligent business discussions to terminate such infringement, and (b) the infringement involves the commercialization of a product that competes directly with any then-marketed product of RBNV or any of its Affiliates, and if the alleged infringement is likely to have a more than insignificant impact on RBNVs business in the country(ies) where sales of allegedly infringing product is occurring, then RBNV shall have the right to effect termination of such infringement, including bringing suit or other proceedings against the infringer in its own name. The other Parties hereto shall be kept informed at all times of all such proceedings taken by RBNV. RBNV shall not be authorized to make any admission, consent, or other representation during the proceeding, which would admit the invalidity or unenforceability of an RBG Patent, without the advice and consent, in writing, from RBG, which RBG is entitled to withhold in its reasonable discretion. If RBG (or an RBG Affiliate) requests, such entity may join with RBNV as a party to the lawsuit or other proceeding at its own expense. In this case, RBNV shall retain control of the prosecution of such suit or proceedings, as the case may be, except that RBG shall have the sole right to control the prosecution of such suit or proceedings as regards all matters affecting validity and/or enforceability of the RBG Patent(s). 8.1.2 RBNV/Affiliate Responsibility. RBNV is responsible, and shall hold RBG and Dynavax harmless for: (i) all financial obligations to third parties (i.e. parties that are not Parties hereto and Affiliates thereof) due to the receipt or exercise by RBNV and its Affiliates of the license of subsection 4.3.1 and/or 4.3.2, and (ii) all requirements in relation to RBGs existing (as of the Closing Date) third-party licenses for RBG IP, arising out of RBNVs or its Affiliates receipt or exercise of the licenses of subsections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 of which RBG and/or Dynavax informs RBNV (i.e. if third-party obligations exist (meaning that they are provided for in a written agreement with a third party executed before the Closing Date) for the exercise of the licenses of Sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.2 shall not be Dynavaxs nor RBGs responsibility, but Dynavax or RBG must inform RBNC of such third-party obligations in order for RBNV and its Affiliates to be able to fulfill them. For the avoidance of any doubt, RBG and Dynavax shall not be liable for any financial obligations to third parties, including for example upstream royalties or other payments, arising out of RBNVs or its Affiliates exercise of rights to third-party RBG IP sublicensed hereunder. other activities in exercise of a license granted it hereunder, including the development or manufacture of licensed (hereunder) prototypes or clinical supplies by Licensee or its Affiliates, or the use of any licensed (hereunder) product manufactured, or used by Licensee or its Affiliates by any human being regardless of whether such use was contemplated by the Parties, except in the case of each (a) and (b) to the extent such liabilities result from (x) the willful misconduct, or gross negligence by the Licensor Indemnitees and/or (y) the Licensors breach of its representations and warranties under this Agreement. For purposes of illustration, Dynavax shall not be responsible and shall be defended and held harmless by RBNV for product liabilities relating to [ * ] while RBNV shall not be responsible for and shall be defended and held harmless by Dynavax and RBG for product liabilities relating to Supervax Program Products, Theravax Program Products and Cytovax Program Products. RBG is the Licensor, and RBNV and its Affiliates are the Licensees, regarding the licenses of Section 4.3. RBNV is the Licensor, and RBG, Dynavax and their Affiliates are the Licensees, regarding the licenses of Section 4.2. 8.3 Indemnification Procedure. If a Party (the Indemnitee) intends to claim indemnification under Section 8, Indemnitee shall promptly notify the other Party (the Indemnitor) of any claim, demand, action, or other proceeding for which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification. The Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in, and to the extent the Indemnitor so desires jointly with any other Indemnitor similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnitor; provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel at Indemnitees own expense. The indemnity obligations under this Article 8 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding if such settlement is effected without the prior express written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The failure to deliver notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after notice of any such claim or demand, or the commencement of any such action or other proceeding, only to the extent actually prejudicial to its ability to defend such claim, demand, action or other proceeding, shall relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Article 8 with respect thereto, but the omission so to deliver notice to the Indemnitor shall not relieve it of any liability that it may have to the misappropriation of a Partys Information, (each a Dispute) shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the [ * ] except where this rules conflict with this provision, in which case this provision controls. The Arbitration shall be held in English and shall take place in London. The Dispute shall be construed in accordance with the laws of [ * ] exclusive of conflicts of law rules. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of three neutral arbitrators, each of whom shall be an attorney who (a) has at least fifteen (15) years of experience in the biopharmaceutical field in a law firm or corporate law department of over twenty-five (25) lawyers or (b) was a judge of a court of general jurisdiction. However: (X) at least one of the arbitrators must be an attorney described in clause (a) of the foregoing sentence; (Y) at least one of the arbitrators must be trained in [ * ] and have been admitted to practice in [ * ] ; and (Z) at least one of the arbitrators must be a native English speaker. The arbitrators shall be neutral, independent, disinterested, and impartial. Each Party shall nominate in the request for arbitration and the answer thereto one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so named will then jointly appoint the third arbitrator as chairman of the arbitration tribunal. After appointment, the Parties shall have no ex-parte communication with their proposed arbitrator. If one Party fails to nominate its arbitrator or, if the Parties arbitrators cannot agree on the person to be named as chairman within [ * ] the President of the London Court of International Arbitration shall make the necessary appointments. Within [ * ] of initiation of arbitration, the Parties shall reach agreement upon and thereafter follow procedures assuring that the arbitration will be concluded and the award rendered within no more than eight months from selection of the arbitrators. Failing such agreement, the Arbitration Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration will control the procedures and scheduling and the Parties will follow procedures that meet such a time schedule. Each Party has the right before or, if the arbitrators cannot hear the matter within an acceptable period, during the arbitration to seek and obtain from the appropriate court provisional remedies such as attachment, preliminary injunction, replevin, etc., to avoid irreparable harm, maintain the status quo or preserve the subject matter of the arbitration. Any request for such provisional measures by a Party to a court shall not be deemed a waiver of this agreement to arbitrate. In addition, the Arbitrator Tribunal may, at the request of a Party, order provisional or conservatory measures (including, without limitation, preliminary injunctions to prevent breaches hereof) and the Parties shall be able to enforce the terms and provisions of such orders in any court having jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitration tribunal must be in writing and must specify the basis on which the decision was made, and the award of the arbitration tribunal shall be final and judgment upon such an award may be entered in any competent court or application may be made to any competent court for judicial acceptance of such an award and order of enforcement. AS IS CONSISTENT WITH SECTION 8.5, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE EMPOWERED TO AND SHALL NOT AWARD ANY PARTY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, MULTIPLIED OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (SUCH AS LOST PROFITS, OPPORTUNITY COSTS, MISSED BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR OTHER THINGS CAUSED BUT NOT PROXIMATELY CAUSED BY ANY BREACH OR 3.3 If Licensee takes the decision to file for marketing approval, and/or to market, no Supervax Program Product in any particular country in or for which Licensee has made a contrary decision for a Heplisav Program Product, and the Commercially Reasonable Diligent Efforts standard would require marketing Supervax in such country (taking into account all factors provided for in the definition of such standard above, including gray market effects on countries where Licensee will be marketing a Supervax Program Product and the potential impact on the selling price in such countries), then Licensee shall promptly inform Licensor in writing. Licensor may then inform Licensee, that for such country, Licensees exclusive license is revoked, and, thereafter Licensor or an Affiliate theoreof, will have the rights to register, market, offer to sell and sell Supervax in such country. Licensor shall have the right to reference regulatory dossiers useful for registration in such market. Licensor shall in this case be entitled under its license in Section 4.3.1 of the Definitive Commercial Agreement between the Parties of even date with this Agreement to manufacture Supervax Program Product solely to supply itself solely for such reverted countries. In addition, Licensee agrees to discuss in good faith with Licensor the possibility of Licensee supplying Licensor with quantities of Supervax Program Product for Licensors sales in any such reverted countries, but Licensor shall not be required to supply Licensor unless the Parties reach written agreement as to such supply and in any case Licensee shall not be required under any circumstances to prioritize supply for the reverted countries ahead of supply for countries where Licensee retains its license nor shall Licensee be required to increase its capacity for production of 5.8 Records; Inspection. Licensee, its Affiliates and their Sublicensees, shall keep complete, true, and accurate books of account and records for the purpose of determining the Profit Share amounts payable under this Agreement. Such books and records shall be kept at the principal place of business of Licensee, or its Affiliate, or Sublicensee, as the case may be, for at least three (3) years following the end of the calendar quarter to which they pertain. Such records will be open for inspection during such three (3) year period by an independent public accounting firm of national prominence retained by the other Party for the purpose of verifying the Net Profit Share statements, no more than once per set of records. Such inspections may be made no more than once each calendar year, at reasonable times mutually agreed by Licensee and Licensor. The Licensors representative or agent will be obliged to execute a reasonable confidentiality agreement prior to commencing any such inspection. Inspections conducted under this Section shall be at the expense of the 6.2 All documents, materials and know-how which may be furnished to the receiving Party hereto (the Recipient) by the disclosing Party hereto (the Disclosing Party) pursuant to this Agreement, and the predecessor agreements referred to in Section 6.1 hereinabove, shall be, if suitably marked or designated in tangible form, deemed the Disclosing Partys Proprietary Information and, therefore, considered confidential and shall not be used by Recipient other than for the purposes licensed under this Agreement and for the exercise of the Recipients rights under this Agreement. Recipient shall use the same degree of care regarding Disclosing Partys Proprietary Information as it uses in protecting and preserving its own proprietary/confidential information of like kind to avoid disclosure or dissemination thereof, but no less than a reasonable degree of care. Information which is disclosed orally or otherwise than in tangible form shall be considered Proprietary Information if: (a) the information is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and a written summary is provided to the Recipient within thirty (30) days thereafter, or (b) the information is identified as confidential in writing and provided to the Recipient prior to or at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party. 7.2 Neither Party shall disclose in any press release, public statement, or public release, the terms of this Agreement or any information with respect to this Agreement (including, without limitation, any release of information in connection with any scientific and medical conference) without the other Partys express written permission. The foregoing shall not apply to disclosures under an understanding of confidentiality or to information, which had theretofore been disclosed by or with the consent of the other Party. Either Party will be free to publish the results of the Supervax project after providing the other Party with a [ * ] (which period shall commence to the date that the other Party receives the text which is to be published and a summary of the manner of intended publication) in which to review and approve each publication, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In any such publication by Licensor, Licensees contribution shall be acknowledged by Licensor. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent a Party (or its Affiliate) from complying with its reporting requirements as part of its responsibilities as a public company. This includes public company reporting requirements of Dynavax Technologies Corporation, a Delaware corporation. Accordingly, while Licensee will attempt to give Licensor advance notice of any such required disclosures, and will reasonably consider Licensees comments thereon if provided on a timeline that is reasonable in view of the required disclosure, Licensee and its Affiliates retain the right to make all legally required disclosures (including as legally required based on SEC interpretations), based on the good faith advice of its outside corporate counsel. 8.1.1 Infringement Claims. If the production, sale or use of any Supervax in the Field results in a claim, suit or proceeding alleging patent infringement against Licensee or Licensor (or their respective Affiliates or Sublicenses), such Party shall promptly notify the other Party hereto in writing setting forth the facts of such claim in reasonable detail. The Party subject to such claim shall have the exclusive right to defend and control the defense of any such claim, suit or proceeding, at its own expense, using counsel of its own choice, provided, however, it shall not enter into any settlement which admits or concedes that any aspect of the Patent or Know How of the other Party hereto is invalid or unenforceable without the prior written consent of such other Party. Such Party shall keep the other Party hereto reasonably informed of all material developments in connection with any such claim, suit or proceeding. All liabilities under this Section are and shall be deemed deductible costs in the calculation of Net Profits via inclusion within the Patent Costs. 9.4 Indemnification Procedure. If a Party (the Indemnitee) intends to claim indemnification hereunder, Indemnitee shall promptly notify the other Party (the Indemnitor) of any claim, demand, action, or other proceeding for which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification. The Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in, and to the extent the Indemnitor so desires jointly with any other Indemnitor similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnitor; provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel at Indemnitees own expense. The indemnity obligations under Section 9.3 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding if such settlement is effected without the prior express written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The failure to deliver notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after notice of any such claim or demand, or the commencement of any such action or other proceeding, only to the extent actually prejudicial to its ability to defend such claim, demand, action or other proceeding, shall relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under Section 9.3 with respect thereto, but the omission so to deliver notice to the Indemnitor shall not relieve it of any liability that it may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under Section 9.3. The Indemnitor may not settle or otherwise consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim, demand, action or other proceeding, that diminishes the rights or interests of the Indemnitee without the prior express written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnitee, its Affiliates, and all of their employees and agents, shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the investigation of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding covered by this Section 9.4. 10.2 Termination for Cause. Either Party to this Agreement may terminate this Agreement in the event the other Party shall be in material breach of this Agreement (including by default), and such material breach shall have continued uncured for [ * ] after written notice thereof was provided to the breaching Party by the non-breaching Party. Any termination shall become effective at the end of such [ * ] period unless the breaching Party (or any other Party on its behalf) has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of the [ * ] period, or in the case of a breach incapable of cure during such time period, delivered a plan to cure the breach as promptly as practicable by the application of Commercial Reasonable Diligent Efforts, together with an undertaking to carry out such plan. However, if Licensee terminates this Agreement due to Licensor being in material breach of this Agreement, which breach cannot be or is not cured as provided in this Section, the licenses granted by Licensor in Section 2.1 shall continue after such termination. 11.3 Arbitration. Any controversy, dispute or claim which is not resolved pursuant to Section 11.2 and which may arise out of or in connection with this Agreement, including the exhibits attached hereto, or the interpretation, enforceability, performance, breach, termination or validity thereof, including disputes relating to alleged breach or termination of the foregoing (each a Dispute) shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration then pertaining, except where this rules conflict with this provision, in which case this provision controls. The Arbitration shall be held in English and shall take place in London. Subject to Section 11.6, the Dispute shall be construed in accordance with the laws of [ * ] exclusive of its conflicts of law rules. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of three neutral arbitrators, each of whom shall be an attorney who has at least fifteen (15) years of experience in the biopharmaceutical field with a law firm or corporate law department or was a judge of a court of general jurisdiction who has at least fifteen (15) years of experience in the biopharmaceutical field. However: (X) at least one of the arbitrators must be an attorney described in clause (a) of the foregoing sentence; (Y) at least one of the arbitrators must be trained in [ * ] law and have been admitted to practice in [ * ] ; and (Z) at least one of the arbitrators must be a native English speaker. The arbitrators shall be neutral, independent, disinterested, and impartial. Each Party shall nominate in the request for arbitration and the answer thereto one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so named will then jointly appoint the third arbitrator as chairman of the arbitration tribunal. After appointment, the Parties shall have no ex-parte communication with their proposed arbitrator. If one Party fails to nominate its arbitrator or, if the Parties arbitrators cannot agree on the person to be named as chairman within thirty (30) days, the President of the London Court of International Arbitration shall make the necessary appointments. Within thirty (30) days of initiation of arbitration, the Parties shall reach agreement upon and thereafter follow procedures assuring that the arbitration will be concluded and the award rendered within no more than eight (8) months from selection of the arbitrators. Failing such agreement, the Arbitration [ * ] will control the procedures and scheduling and the Parties will follow such procedures and meet such a time schedule. Each Party has the right before or, if the arbitrators cannot hear the matter within an acceptable period, during the arbitration to seek and obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction provisional remedies such as attachment, preliminary injunction, replevin, etc., to avoid irreparable harm, maintain the status quo or preserve the subject matter of the arbitration. Any request for such provisional measures by a Party to a court shall not be deemed a waiver of this agreement to arbitrate. In addition, the Arbitrator Tribunal may, at the request of a Party, order provisional or conservatory measures (including, without limitation, preliminary injunctions to prevent breaches hereof) and the Parties shall be able to enforce the terms and provisions of such orders in any court having jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitration tribunal must be in writing and must specify the basis on which the decision was made, and the award of the arbitration tribunal shall be final and judgment upon such an award may be entered in any competent court or application may be made to any competent court for judicial acceptance of such an award and order of enforcement. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT AWARD ANY PARTY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, MULTIPLIED OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO SEEK SUCH DAMAGES. NO PARTY MAY SEEK OR OBTAIN PREJUDGMENT INTEREST OR ATTORNEYS FEES OR COSTS. 3.6 If Seller and Purchaser fail so to agree prior to the Closing Date (which failure, however, will not constitute a cause for postponing the Closing), the parties will agree to refer any dispute for resolution to a reputable Big Four international accounting firm (other than the existing auditors of Seller or Purchaser) appointed (i) by Seller and Purchaser or (ii) in default of agreement on such appointment within 7 days, by the President for the time being of the Netherlands Institute for Chartered Accountants (NIVRA). Such accounting firm shall be instructed to render its opinion as soon as practicable and in any event within 30 days after being instructed. In making such determination such accounting firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator and its decision shall (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on the parties hereto. The expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne by the Seller and Purchaser in proportion to the allocation of the amounts in dispute between the Seller and Purchaser as made by such accounting firm, such that the prevailing party pays the less proportion of the fees and expenses. The Proposed WC Calculation shall be adjusted on the basis of such accounting firms resolution of such dispute and as so adjusted shall become the Final WC Calculation. 6.1 Conduct of Business. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts in order to cause the Company to be operated only in the ordinary course of business and in a manner consistent with past practice, and that the Company shall preserve substantially intact the business organization of Company, to keep available the services of the current officers, employees and consultants of Company and to preserve the current relationships of Company with customers, partners, suppliers and other persons with which Seller has significant business relations. Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser of any event or occurrence not in the ordinary course of business of Company, and any event of which it is aware which reasonably would be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company (even if the likelihood of such event has previously been disclosed or could result from any item set forth in the Disclosure Letter). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or disclosed in the Disclosure Letter, Seller shall not, from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, cause, or permit the Company to do any of the following without the prior written consent of Purchaser: 6.6 Shareholders Meeting. The Seller, acting through its management board and/or supervisory board, shall, subject to and according to applicable law and its articles of incorporation, promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as soon as practicable to ensure obtaining requisite shareholder approval following the date hereof, the Shareholders Meeting for the purpose of voting to approve and adopt the Transaction (the Seller Voting Proposal). The board of directors of the Seller shall, subject to the fiduciary duties of the management board and supervisory board of the Seller under applicable Law, (i) recommend approval and adoption of the Seller Voting Proposal by the stockholders of the Seller and include in the related Shareholder Circular to the stockholders of the Company such recommendation and (ii) take all reasonable and lawful action to solicit and obtain such approval and take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the Sellers stockholders required by Netherlands Law or applicable Frankfurt Exchange requirements to obtain such approval. The Seller represents that the Seller stockholder vote required for the approval of the Seller Voting Proposal shall be a majority of the outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock on the record date for the Shareholders Meeting. (b) If the Claim relates to a claim or the commencement of an action or proceeding (a Proceeding) by a Third Party against the Company and/or the Purchaser, then the Seller shall have, upon request within 20 business days after receipt of the Indemnification Notice, the right to defend, at its own expense and by its own counsel (and such counsel reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser), any such matter involving the asserted liability of the Company and/or the Purchaser. If the Seller assumes the defense of such a Claim, no compromise or settlement of such Claim may be effected by the Seller without the Purchasers consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld) unless (i) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by Seller, and (ii) the Purchaser will have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Claim effected without its consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a Proceeding may adversely affect it or its affiliates (other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement), the Purchaser may, by notice to the Seller assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Proceeding, but the Seller will not be bound by and determination of a Proceeding so defended or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld). 2.1.1 The Parties hereby agree that this Agreement sets forth the entire understanding between the Parties and their Affiliates with respect to the ownership of, all licenses to, and all rights to use and practice, the RBG IP and the [ * ] strain (here and everywhere else used in this Agreement where we refer to [ * ] we mean the strain [ * ] as described in [ * ] Release Testing, Genetic and Product Characterisation). That is to say, where we refer above to except to the extent specifically modified hereunder, the grants of licenses under and rights to use and practice the RBG IP set forth in this Agreement is, together with the remainder of this Section 2.1.1 and Sections 2.4 and 2.5, are intended to supersede all prior understandings with respect to the ownership of, licenses under, and rights to use RBG IP and the [ * ] strain, and to set forth the Parties entire agreement with respect to all of the foregoing matters mentioned in this sentence. RBNV and its Affiliates hereby acknowledge that they have no ownership or license rights in the RBG IP (excluding the Master Cell Line) and the [ * ] strain other than the license rights set forth in this Agreement. RBNV acknowledge that they have no financial interest in the RBG IP or [ * ] strain other than as set forth in Section 2.4 and 2.5. 2.4 Fully Paid-Up License Rights. All Patent and Know-How rights, including RBG Patents rights, granted to RBNV, RBG, and their Affiliates, in pre-existing agreements between or among RBNV, RBG and their Affiliates, are hereby paid-up and royalty-free at the Closing Date. With the exception of (1) any outstanding invoices at Closing, (2) the arrangements specifically made and/or referenced in the Definitive Agreements executed at Signing and/or Closing (such as the profit share for Supervax, the loan repayments, any outstanding accounts payable, any open invoices, and the payments under Section 2.5) and (3) the [ * ] between RBG and RBNV described in the October 1, 2005 Addendum to License Agreement (between RBG and GCVC dated June 30, 1998) with respect to the License and Technology Transfer Agreement between [ * ] sharing arrangement is also referred to at the end of Section 2.5). RBG and RBNV hereby waive all rights to any and all claims to all monies owed under such pre-existing agreements. If RBNV or RBG requests in writing, RBG or RBNV, respectively, shall promptly execute, and deliver to the other, any formal amendment documents confirming the waiver of any monetary obligations owing thereto and/or to its Affiliates and specific to the aforesaid pre-existing documents. Such confirmations must be consistent with this Agreement and the other Definitive Agreements. Such confirmations shall not have any force of effect to the extent inconsistent with this Agreement and/or any of the other Definitive Agreements. 2.5 RBNV Rights to RBG Third Party License Revenues. RBG shall pay to RBNV all monies (excluding those already included in RBGs accounts receivable as of the Closing Date) received by RBG from third parties pursuant to obligations in license agreements with RBG, which agreements exist on the Closing (other than current licenses with RBNV and its Affiliates and specifically excluding [ * ] and the License and Technology Transfer Agreement between [ * ] ) (Current Licenses), to the extent that such monies exceed [ * ] annually after adjustment for payments owed (a) based on agreements existing at Closing, to other third parties from such monies (including any royalties due to such other third parties on in-licensed IP sublicenses to the RBG licensees), and (b) for intellectual property that becomes licensed under the Current Licenses due to RBG obtaining control thereof after the Closing Date, to such third parties pursuant to the written agreement by which RBG obtains such control. For the purposes of clarity, these payments shall not include any payments received by RBG with respect to its Supervax Program Products, Theravax Program Products and Cytovax Program Products. RBNV shall have reasonable audit access to records of such payments on reasonable terms and at reasonable times. Such audits must be performed by a reputable certified public accountant, under appropriate obligations of confidentiality. Such audits shall not be made more frequently than once annually, no later than three (3) years after the payment period being audited. 3.2 Asian Countries and Low Cost Registration European Countries. Dynavax, or an Affiliate thereof, shall promptly notify RBNV in writing within [ * ] of taking its decision to [ * ] in any Asian Country(ies) and/or Low Cost Registration European Country(ies). Such decision must only be made if the Supervax Program Product and data regarding it is such that it shall be at a stage that it would be reasonable to [ * ] it being understood and agreed that if in the particular country it is customary that [ * ] Dynavax, and/or an Affiliate thereof, shall not [ * ] any third party for the sale and/or distribution of Supervax for and in any Asian Country(ies) and/or Low Cost Registration European Country(ies) until after the Parties have exercised their commercially reasonable efforts according to this Section 3.2 (unless RBNV fails to provide a notice that it wishes to negotiate with Dynavax or its Affiliate under Section 3.2.1 within the deadline stated in such Section in which case Dynavax and RBG are free to proceed regarding such Supervax Program Product rights for the country(ies) mentioned in the notice, without restriction). 4.3.2.1 The foregoing license explicitly does not extend to the making and selling of Hepatitis B surface antigen (or any other ingredient covered by or made using the RBG IP) for inclusion (or under contractual terms that would permit their inclusion) in any Supervax Program Product(s), Theravax Program Product(s), Cytovax Program Product(s) and/or Heplisav Program Products. Accordingly, RBNV and their Affiliates shall only supply Hepatitis B surface antigen, made using RBG IP, and such other ingredients to third parties under circumstances in which such third parties (and any entities to which they may transfer such antigen and other ingredients) are legally forbidden and precluded from making Supervax Program Products, Theravax Program Products, Cytovax Program Product and Heplisav Program Products using the supplied quantities of such antigen and other ingredients. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RBNV and its Affiliates shall not be required to amend their existing agreements to comply with the restrictions specified in this Section 4.3.2, but shall exert its reasonable diligent efforts, which do not adversely financially impact RBNV, to include such terms upon amendment thereof and shall include them on any voluntary extension to the relationship (i.e. one that is not required without RBNVs or its Affiliates consent under the contract that exists as of the Closing Date). 4.3.5 RBG Obligation to Secure Third Party Licensor Consent. At RBNVs written request, RBG shall promptly notify each third party licensor of RBG IP, of RBGs obligation under Section 4.3 to sublicense rights in such RBG IP to RBNV, and if consent or amendment under the appropriate license agreement is required, then RBG shall [ * ] to obtain written consent from each such third party licensor. Promptly upon securing each required consent from a third party licensor, if the terms of the consent are acceptable to RBNV, then the Parties shall execute a formal sublicense agreement with RBNV providing for (1) the sublicense of RBG IP rights to RBNV, and (2) the assumption of obligations by RBNV as provided for in such third party license agreements. If any such sublicense requires the payment of monies to the third party licensor (including any payment in the form of an amendment that results in a payment of less money to RBG under the contract than without such amendment), RBNV shall be informed in writing of such potential financial obligation, and RBNV shall be responsible for the payment of all such fees to said third party licensor. RBNV shall be entitled to terminate such sublicense in accordance with its terms, but shall not in this manner be able to avoid responsible for any non-cancelable sublicensing-related fees. 4.3.6 Licensed RBG Patent Maintenance. Given the non-exclusive nature of the license of Section 4.3.1, RBG and Dynavax will be under no requirement to prosecute or maintain RBG Patents, which do not specifically claim [ * ] If RBG and Dynavax elect to abandon any RBG Patent, RBG and/or Dynavax will first give RBNV reasonable notice of such intention and the opportunity to prosecute or maintain such RBG Patent. In this case, optionally, at RBNVs sole discretion, RBNV may do so in its own name; provided that RBG and Dynavax will receive a non-exclusive license to such RBG Patents, consistent with the licenses granted herein and with any pre-existing third party agreements (i.e. if 3rd party obligations exist that apply to the practice of the inventions claimed in the RBG Patents taken over by RBNV, then RBNV must comply with such 3rd party license obligations respecting such practice). If RBG and Dynavax choose, as part of a strategic move, to abandon a particular RBG Patent, which does not claim specifically [ * ] and which would reasonably benefit the RBG Patent portfolio, then the Parties will diligently [ * ] 8.1.1 Dynavax/RBG Responsibility. Dynavax and RBG shall be responsible, and shall hold RBNV harmless for: (i) all financial obligations to third parties (i.e. parties that are not Parties hereto and Affiliates thereof) due to the receipt or exercise by Dynavax or RBG of the rights addressed in section 4.2; and (ii) all requirements in relation to RBNVs existing (as of the Closing Date) third-party licenses, arising out of Dynavaxs or RBGs receipt or exercise of the rights addressed in section 4.2 of which RBNV informs Dynavax (i.e. if third-party obligations exist (meaning that they are provided for in a written agreement with a third party executed before the Closing Date) for the use of the Master Cell Line by RBG and Dynavax under the license of Section 4.2, then fulfillment of those obligations shall not be RBNVs responsibility, but RBNV must inform RBG and Dynavax of such third-party obligations in order for RBG and Dynavax to be able to fulfill them). For the avoidance of any doubt, RBNV shall not be liable for any financial obligations to third parties, including for example upstream royalties or other payments, arising out of Dynavaxs, RBGs or their Affiliates exercise of rights to third-party technology the rights in which have been sublicensed hereunder. (a) Each licensing Party herein (Licensor) shall not be liable for, and each licensed Party herein (Licensee) shall defend indemnify and hold Licensor together with its Affiliates and the directors, officers and employees of all of them (the Licensor Indemnitees) harmless against, any and all liabilities (including product liability and infringement of third party Patents insofar as such infringement relates to activities carried out by Licensee under this Agreement), damages, losses costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees (collectively Damages), resulting in any manner from third-party claims, demands and actions (collectively, Claims) arising out of (a) the use by Licensee or its Affiliates of the Master Cell Line and/or the licensed Know How, or (b) the Licensees other activities in exercise of a license granted it hereunder, including the development or manufacture of licensed (hereunder) prototypes or clinical supplies by Licensee or its Affiliates, or the use of any licensed (hereunder) product manufactured, or used by Licensee or its Affiliates by any human being regardless of whether such use was contemplated by the Parties, except in the case of each (a) and (b) to the extent such liabilities result from (x) the willful misconduct, or gross negligence by the Licensor Indemnitees and/or (y) the Licensors breach of its representations and warranties under this Agreement. For purposes of illustration, Dynavax shall not be responsible and shall be defended and held harmless by RBNV for product liabilities relating to [ * ] while RBNV shall not be responsible for and shall be defended and held harmless by Dynavax and RBG for product liabilities relating to Supervax Program Products, Theravax Program Products and Cytovax Program Products. RBG is the Licensor, and RBNV and its Affiliates are the Licensees, regarding the licenses of Section 4.3. RBNV is the Licensor, and RBG, Dynavax and their Affiliates are the Licensees, regarding the licenses of Section 4.2. 8.3 Indemnification Procedure. If a Party (the Indemnitee) intends to claim indemnification under Section 8, Indemnitee shall promptly notify the other Party (the Indemnitor) of any claim, demand, action, or other proceeding for which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification. The Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in, and to the extent the Indemnitor so desires jointly with any other Indemnitor similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnitor; provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel at Indemnitees own expense. The indemnity obligations under this Article 8 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding if such settlement is effected without the prior express written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The failure to deliver notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after notice of any such claim or demand, or the commencement of any such action or other proceeding, only to the extent actually prejudicial to its ability to defend such claim, demand, action or other proceeding, shall relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Article 8 with respect thereto, but the omission so to deliver notice to the Indemnitor shall not relieve it of any liability that it may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under this Article 8. The Indemnitor may not settle or otherwise consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim, demand, action or other proceeding, that diminishes the rights or interests of the Indemnitee without the prior express written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnitee, its Affiliates, and all of their employees and agents, shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the investigation of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding covered by this Section 8. Any controversy, dispute or claim which may arise out of or in connection with this Agreement, including the exhibits attached hereto, or the interpretation, enforceability, performance, breach, termination or validity thereof, including disputes relating to alleged breach or termination of the foregoing, but excluding any determination as to the infringement, validity or claim interpretation of Patents of each Party related to the subject matter hereof and/or the misuse and/or misappropriation of a Partys Information, (each a Dispute) shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the [ * ] except where this rules conflict with this provision, in which case this provision controls. The Arbitration shall be held in English and shall take place in London. The Dispute shall be construed in accordance with the laws of [ * ] exclusive of conflicts of law rules. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of three neutral arbitrators, each of whom shall be an attorney who (a) has at least fifteen (15) years of experience in the biopharmaceutical field in a law firm or corporate law department of over twenty-five (25) lawyers or (b) was a judge of a court of general jurisdiction. However: (X) at least one of the arbitrators must be an attorney described in clause (a) of the foregoing sentence; (Y) at least one of the arbitrators must be trained in [ * ] and have been admitted to practice in [ * ] ; and (Z) at least one of the arbitrators must be a native English speaker. The arbitrators shall be neutral, independent, disinterested, and impartial. Each Party shall nominate in the request for arbitration and the answer thereto one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so named will then jointly appoint the third arbitrator as chairman of the arbitration tribunal. After appointment, the Parties shall have no ex-parte communication with their proposed arbitrator. If one Party fails to nominate its arbitrator or, if the Parties arbitrators cannot agree on the person to be named as chairman within [ * ] the President of the London Court of International Arbitration shall make the necessary appointments. Within [ * ] of initiation of arbitration, the Parties shall reach agreement upon and thereafter follow procedures assuring that the arbitration will be concluded and the award rendered within no more than eight months from selection of the arbitrators. Failing such agreement, the Arbitration Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration will control the procedures and scheduling and the Parties will follow procedures that meet such a time schedule. Each Party has the right before or, if the arbitrators cannot hear the matter within an acceptable period, during the arbitration to seek and obtain from the appropriate court provisional remedies such as attachment, preliminary injunction, replevin, etc., to avoid irreparable harm, maintain the status quo or preserve the subject matter of the arbitration. Any request for such provisional measures by a Party to a court shall not be deemed a waiver of this agreement to arbitrate. In addition, the Arbitrator Tribunal may, at the request of a Party, order provisional or conservatory measures (including, without limitation, preliminary injunctions to prevent breaches hereof) and the Parties shall be able to enforce the terms and provisions of such orders in any court having jurisdiction. The decision of the arbitration tribunal must be in writing and must specify the basis on which the decision was made, and the award of the arbitration tribunal shall be final and judgment upon such an award may be entered in any competent court or application may be made to any competent court for judicial acceptance of such an award and order of enforcement. AS IS CONSISTENT WITH SECTION 8.5, THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE EMPOWERED TO AND SHALL NOT AWARD ANY PARTY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, MULTIPLIED OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (SUCH AS LOST PROFITS, OPPORTUNITY COSTS, MISSED BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR OTHER THINGS CAUSED BUT NOT PROXIMATELY CAUSED BY ANY BREACH OR DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER THE THEORY OF LIABILITY IS GROUNDED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE), AND EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO SEEK SUCH DAMAGES. NO PARTY MAY SEEK OR OBTAIN PREJUDGMENT INTEREST OR ATTORNEYS FEES OR COSTS. 9.4 Priority of Agreement. The Parties agree and acknowledge that this Agreement supersedes any and all prior written or oral agreements between the Parties and any of their affiliates concerning the subject matter of this Agreement. In particular, this Agreement supersedes the Letter of Intent in all respects regarding the subject matter of this Agreement. The Letter of Intent shall not be used to interpret or deemed to limit or modify the terms of this Agreement. However, the Confidentiality Agreement will remain in effect and will not be superseded by this Agreement; provided, however, that information exchanged between the Parties (with each Party for this purpose being deemed to include its Affiliates) shall be deemed exchanged under the Confidentiality Agreement) and protected thereunder; and provided, further, that notwithstanding any restriction on use stated in such Confidentiality Agreement, the right of a Party and its Affiliates to use items of confidential information, materials and know-how as stated in this Agreement shall not be restricted by such Confidentiality Agreement within the scope of a right or license granted hereunder to such Party and its Affiliates and instead the Parties (and their Affiliates) rights stated in this Agreement shall prevail. This Agreement and the Exclusive License Agreement between Green Cross and RBG and the Trademark Assignment Agreement both signed on the Closing Date together state the Parties entire agreement with respect to Supervax Program Products, as if they were a single agreement, with none of such agreement superseding any of the others of them. 3.3 If Licensee takes the decision to file for marketing approval, and/or to market, no Supervax Program Product in any particular country in or for which Licensee has made a contrary decision for a Heplisav Program Product, and the Commercially Reasonable Diligent Efforts standard would require marketing Supervax in such country (taking into account all factors provided for in the definition of such standard above, including gray market effects on countries where Licensee will be marketing a Supervax Program Product and the potential impact on the selling price in such countries), then Licensee shall promptly inform Licensor in writing. Licensor may then inform Licensee, that for such country, Licensees exclusive license is revoked, and, thereafter Licensor or an Affiliate theoreof, will have the rights to register, market, offer to sell and sell Supervax in such country. Licensor shall have the right to reference regulatory dossiers useful for registration in such market. Licensor shall in this case be entitled under its license in Section 4.3.1 of the Definitive Commercial Agreement between the Parties of even date with this Agreement to manufacture Supervax Program Product solely to supply itself solely for such reverted countries. In addition, Licensee agrees to discuss in good faith with Licensor the possibility of Licensee supplying Licensor with quantities of Supervax Program Product for 6.2 All documents, materials and know-how which may be furnished to the receiving Party hereto (the Recipient) by the disclosing Party hereto (the Disclosing Party) pursuant to this Agreement, and the predecessor agreements referred to in Section 6.1 hereinabove, shall be, if suitably marked or designated in tangible form, deemed the Disclosing Partys Proprietary Information and, therefore, considered confidential and shall not be used by Recipient other than for the purposes licensed under this Agreement and for the exercise of the Recipients rights under this Agreement. Recipient shall use the same degree of care regarding Disclosing Partys Proprietary Information as it uses in protecting and preserving its own proprietary/confidential information of like kind to avoid disclosure or dissemination thereof, but no less than a reasonable degree of care. Information which is disclosed orally or otherwise than in tangible form shall be considered Proprietary Information if: (a) the information is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and a written summary is provided to the Recipient within thirty (30) days thereafter, or (b) the information is identified as confidential in writing and provided to the Recipient prior to or at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party. 7.2 Neither Party shall disclose in any press release, public statement, or public release, the terms of this Agreement or any information with respect to this Agreement (including, without limitation, any release of information in connection with any scientific and medical conference) without the other Partys express written permission. The foregoing shall not apply to disclosures under an understanding of confidentiality or to information, which had theretofore been disclosed by or with the consent of the other Party. Either Party will be free to publish the results of the Supervax project after providing the other Party with a [ * ] (which period shall commence to the date that the other Party receives the text which is to be published and a summary of the manner of intended publication) in which to review and approve each publication, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In any such publication by Licensor, Licensees contribution shall be acknowledged by Licensor. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent a Party (or its Affiliate) from complying with its reporting requirements as part of its responsibilities as a public company. This includes public company reporting requirements of Dynavax Technologies Corporation, a Delaware corporation. Accordingly, while Licensee will attempt to give Licensor advance notice of any such required disclosures, and will reasonably consider Licensees comments thereon if provided on a timeline that is reasonable in view of the required disclosure, Licensee and its Affiliates retain the right to make all legally required disclosures (including as legally required based on SEC interpretations), based on the good faith advice of its outside corporate counsel. 9.4 Indemnification Procedure. If a Party (the Indemnitee) intends to claim indemnification hereunder, Indemnitee shall promptly notify the other Party (the Indemnitor) of any claim, demand, action, or other proceeding for which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification. The Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in, and to the extent the Indemnitor so desires jointly with any other Indemnitor similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnitor; provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel at Indemnitees own expense. The indemnity obligations under Section 9.3 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding if such settlement is effected without the prior express written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The failure to deliver notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after notice of any such claim or demand, or the commencement of any such action or other proceeding, only to the extent actually prejudicial to its ability to defend such claim, demand, action or other proceeding, shall relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under Section 9.3 with respect thereto, but the omission so to deliver notice to the Indemnitor shall not relieve it of any liability that it may have to the Indemnitee otherwise than under Section 9.3. The Indemnitor may not settle or otherwise consent to an adverse judgment in any such claim, demand, action or other proceeding, that diminishes the rights or interests of the Indemnitee without the prior express written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Indemnitee, its Affiliates, and all of their employees and agents, shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor and its legal representatives in the investigation of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding covered by this Section 9.4. 10.2 Termination for Cause. Either Party to this Agreement may terminate this Agreement in the event the other Party shall be in material breach of this Agreement (including by default), and such material breach shall have continued uncured for [ * ] after written notice thereof was provided to the breaching Party by the non-breaching Party. Any termination shall become effective at the end of such [ * ] period unless the breaching Party (or any other Party on its behalf) has cured any such breach or default prior to the expiration of the [ * ] period, or in the case of a breach incapable of cure during such time period, delivered a plan to cure the breach as promptly as practicable by the application of Commercial Reasonable Diligent Efforts, together with an undertaking to carry out such plan. However, if Licensee terminates this Agreement due to Licensor being in material breach of this Agreement, which breach cannot be or is not cured as provided in this Section, the licenses granted by Licensor in Section 2.1 shall continue after such termination. 11.3 Arbitration. Any controversy, dispute or claim which is not resolved pursuant to Section 11.2 and which may arise out of or in connection with this Agreement, including the exhibits attached hereto, or the interpretation, enforceability, performance, breach, termination or validity thereof, including disputes relating to alleged breach or termination of the foregoing (each a Dispute) shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration then pertaining, except where this rules conflict with this provision, in which case this provision controls. The Arbitration shall be held in English and shall take place in London. Subject to Section 11.6, the Dispute shall be construed in accordance with the laws of [ * ] exclusive of its conflicts of law rules. The arbitration tribunal shall consist of three neutral arbitrators, each of whom shall be an attorney who has at least fifteen (15) years of experience in the biopharmaceutical field with a law firm or corporate law department or was a judge of a court of general jurisdiction who has at least fifteen (15) years of experience in the biopharmaceutical field. However: (X) at least one of the arbitrators must be an attorney described in clause (a) of the foregoing sentence; (Y) at least one of the arbitrators must be trained in [ * ] law and have been admitted to practice in [ * ] ; and (Z) at least one of the arbitrators must be a native English speaker. The arbitrators shall be neutral, independent, disinterested, and impartial. Each Party shall nominate in the request for arbitration and the answer thereto one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so named will then jointly appoint the third arbitrator as chairman of the arbitration tribunal. After appointment, the Parties shall have no ex-parte communication with their proposed arbitrator. If one Party fails to nominate its arbitrator or, if the Parties arbitrators cannot agree on the person to be named as chairman within thirty (30) days, the President of the London Court of International Arbitration shall make the necessary appointments. Within thirty (30) days of initiation of arbitration, the Parties shall reach agreement upon and thereafter follow procedures assuring that the arbitration will be concluded and the award rendered within no more than eight (8) months from selection of the arbitrators. Failing such agreement, the Arbitration [ * ] will control the procedures and scheduling and the Parties will follow such procedures and meet 12.7 Assignment and Successors Rights/Waiver. Except in connection with a sale by a Party of all or substantially all of its assets to which this Agreement relates, or a Partys merger with another entity, or an assignment to a Partys Affiliate, this Agreement may not be assigned without the prior written consent of either Party, and is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto, their representatives, successors and permitted assigns. No failure or successive failures on the part of either Party, its successors or permitted assigns, to enforce any covenant or agreement, and no waiver or successive waivers on its or their part of any condition of this Agreement, shall operate as a discharge of such covenant, agreement or condition, or render the same invalid, or impair the right of either Party, its successors and permitted assigns to enforce the same in the event of any subsequent breach or breaches by the other Party, its successors or permitted assigns."
