        "text": "One of my former students recently asked me how many concerts I had seen in my lifetime, and I told them I had no idea but it had to be over a hundred. UPDATE: I counted. It’s 303. Anyway, I LOVE live music and always have, and I’ve been going to shows for 50-years. Anyway, because I was asked I have attempted to recall all the shows I’ve seen, and believe me when I say there is no way I’ll remember them all. Because of this you can bet this blog will be updated often as the memories come flooding back or somebody reminds me of something I forgot. With all this in mind, let me begin. I’ll list the concerts along with notes on some of them, and they will be in somewhat of a chronological order but not really. An asterisk indicates a Rock Hall of Fame inductee, and I believe I’ve seen 25 bands/artists that have earned that honor. That said, I’ve also seen some shows that might surprise you. Let us begin . . .\n\nRedbone\n\n1974, Kings Island Senior Night. They were Native Americans, they wore full Native American regalia, and their big hit was “Come and Get Your Love.” I was front row and I was forever turned on to live music. Who could not be after seeing this?\n\nNote: I have no idea if that’s politically correct or not, I just know it’s a great song.\n\nBrownsville Station\n\nThese cool cats sang the original “Smokin’ in the Boys Room” and followed Redbone. I’ll never forget singer Cub Coda’s roaring vocals and drummer Henry “H-Bomb” Weck destroying the skins. Epic.\n\nSeals & Crofts\n\nThanks to my Uncle Myrl we always had great seats at the Ohio State Fair. Hence the front row seats for the band that gave us “Summer Breeze” and “Diamond Girl.” It was a very good show.\n\nThe Stylistics\n\nBelieve it or not I saw this legendary R&B group at the Ross County Fairgrounds. Who booked them there I do not know, but it was the early to mid-70s so they were in their heyday.\n\nAerosmith*\n\nAh, the famous (well, at least to me) Aerosmith concert. You know, the one where I drank Stroh’s beer with Joe Perry and Steven Tyler? That one? Yeah, I used to have a cool photo of me sitting between those rock Gods on a backstage couch, smiling broadly, luxurious locks cascading down our backs. Sorry, I got lost in the mists of time there for a second. Anyway, here’s the link: Steven, Joe and Me: Meeting Aerosmith. Read it. I would but it would make me cry again.\n\nNote: I looked it up. It was March 24th, 1978 at Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Columbus.\n\nAllman Brothers Band*\n\nI saw these guys at an outdoor venue somewhere over near Zanesville. I don’t think it was Legend Valley, but I could be wrong. Anyway, they were as good as you might expect Southern Rock legends to be.\n\nThe Beach Boys* (6)\n\nI’ve seen The Boys six times at various venues, including the big return of Brian Wilson sometime around 1977. They’re always a good show. Oh, and remember the time Mike Love tried to steal my girlfriend? If not, here’s the story: In the late 70’s I went to see them, again at Riverfront Coliseum in The Natti. We were once again right down front. From the get-go Mike Love was paying special attention to my date, at one point getting down on one knee and singing a song right up in her grillmix. I don’t remember the song, probably because I was too busy watching the security dude and figuring my odds of getting a shot at Love’s nose. Eventually Love actually sent a guy down to ask if she was interested. She said no and he never came close to us the rest of the show. Bizarre experience.\n\nChicago* (4)\n\nChicago was always a good show, especially when they rocked and before they started with all the sappy ballads in the early 80s. The most memorable show was when Peter Cetera nearly stole my date. Yep, it happened again, and this show and The Beach Boys show were only a couple weeks apart. I guess I should look at the bright side and assume I had good taste in women? Anyway, here’s a link to the whole sordid affair: How Peter Cetera Once Ruined a Relationship. Mine. I saw Chicago again on 7.23.22. They only had two original members, Pankow, Loughnane and Lamb (who wasn’t there that night) but I still enjoyed them immensely.\n\nWarren Zevon\n\nI saw the legend back in early ’79 when I was living on West 8th Avenue, just south of The Ohio State University campus. I distinctly recall sitting at a table in the since demolished Serene Lounge, a misnamed establishment if there ever was one. As I sat there enjoying Happy Hour, a buddy came rushing in and said he had tickets to a show up the street at The Agora, which is now The Newport. Of course I asked who was playing, and he told me Warren Zevon. Being the sophisticated music aficionado that I was, I immediately jumped at the chance. O.K., truth be told I’d never heard of Warren Zevon. Seems I’d missed the whole “Werewolves of London” hoopla from a few months prior. Go figure. Long story short, I went, was blown away and became a huge fan.\n\nNote. It’s odd but one clear memory I have of that night was Zevon mentioning that his dad was named Stumpy. That’s a cool dad name, don’t you think? Anyway, one of my big regrets (among many) is the fact that I never saw Warren Zevon live again.\n\nSteely Dan\n\nI think I saw these guys at St. John Arena, but I’ll be damned if I can remember exactly. Anyway, it was the late 70s, a period my loving father used to refer to as “my hazy period.”\n\nThe New York Dolls\n\nBelieve it or not I actually saw these punk legends at the Fairgrounds Coliseum where they opened for The Babys and, wait for it . . . REO Speedwagon. To say I’d never seen anything like them (spiked collars, high heels, multi-colored hair, hot pants) is an understatement. I’m pretty sure I stood there, mouth agape, during their entire show.\n\nSteppenwolf\n\nThese rock legends actually performed at Sam’s Place, a big barn-type venue south on Chillicothe on Route 23. I believe the building is still there. Anyway, they rocked out “Born to Be Wild” and “Magic Carpet Ride” right here in good ol’ Ross County USA.\n\nThe Babys\n\nThe Babys followed the New York Dolls, and although “Isn’t It Time” and “Every Time I Think of You” are great songs, following the Dolls was a tough gig ( not to mention everyone was there to see REO).\n\nREO Speedwagon\n\nI feel like I’ve seen REO more than once, but perhaps not. Anyway, it was a rockin’ show. I remember they closed with “Ridin’ the Storm Out.”\n\nElectric Light Orchestra* (13)\n\nYep, I’ve seen ELO 13-times at least, and every single show was a joy, a revelation and an absolute rock spectacle. Hey, who doesn’t like lasers, giant spaceships and giant butterflies and moths fluttering above the audience? I know I do. Seriously, Jeff Lynne is a musical genius and a rock legend, and I shall see him again in less than a month. However, the most memorable ELO show was the night I found myself in the middle of a Jeff Lynne/ELO scenario of which I wanted no part of. To fully understand, read this: Pimping for the Electric Light Orchestra. UPDATE: Caught ELO again on 7/30 at Nationwide in Columbus. Once again it was an outstanding show.\n\nRoxy Music\n\nI saw Roxy Music open for ELO at Veterans Memorial in 1975, and Bryan Ferry did not disappoint, singing “Love Is The Drug” and others in all his Glam Rock glory.\n\nGentle Giant\n\nSaw this Prog Rock band open for ELO in The Natti, circa 1977.\n\nSteve Hillage\n\nHillage was a guitarist of note back in the 70s.\n\nRick Derringer (3)\n\nI first saw Derringer on the “Frampton Comes Alive” tour at the Tangerine Bowl in Florida. There were several bands before Frampton, and one of them was Kansas. They came out and it was clear from the get-go they were tanked. Just smashed, drunk and/or high as hell. Midway through song two or three they just turned and walked off the stage. The crowd basically rioted until something pretty cool happened. Rick Derringer, who had played a short set earlier, returned to the stage and started playing. Slowly the crowd got into it and eventually he was actually playing requests. That’s a true pro right there, and he saved everyone from a potentially nasty situation. When Frampton finally came out he thanked Derringer profusely and even called him back out for an encore. I’ll always have fond memories of Rick Derringer because of that day.\n\nLed Zeppelin*\n\nAt some point a bit before The Who tragedy at Riverfront Coliseum (again, my dates are a little fuzzy) I saw Led Zeppelin there. The whole festival seating/general admission thing was in place, and it was pretty ugly. We got there real early to get in line. The coliseum’s policy at the time was to open just 4-doors at around 6:30 PM (again, hazy) for the 8:00 show. We were right up front, and a little after 5:00 PM things began to get ugly. Remember, 4-doors for 12,000+ people. Idiocy. People in the back began pressing forward and those of us in front were getting crushed against the doors. Guys were begging the security inside to open up, but they weren’t listening. A police chopper suddenly appeared and began hovering about 30-feet up, and a guy with a bullhorn was telling people to back up. Nobody was having it, and at one point I remember a beer bottle being thrown at the chopper and shattering off its side. By this time I was seriously in fear of not making it out of there. My arms were pressed against my sides so tightly that I couldn’t raise them. Occasionally my feet would rise off the ground and I’d have to completely go wherever the crowd took me. Scary stuff for sure. The worst part was when the crowd would start to lean and you feared getting crushed. It was hard to breathe and several people passed out but obviously didn’t fall down. Surreal as hell. Finally, an ignorant security guard did a dumb but ultimately good thing – he cracked a door open, ostensibly to tell somebody when the gates would open. At that point the door was ripped open and the crowd poured in. Glass was flying everywhere, and as I was being pushed through a guard reached out and ripped a flask from my neck, nearly slashing my throat. No tickets were taken and chaos ensued. After I got away from the rushing crowd, I sought out a cop and yelled, “If these people don’t start opening more doors somebody’s going to get killed here!” A prophetic statement, unfortunately. When the news came down months later that 11-people were killed at The Who show, I wasn’t surprised. I knew exactly what had taken place. Oh, and by the way, I scored a front row spot. Hey, it was Zep.\n\nThe Eagles* (3)\n\nI first saw The Eagles during their Hotel California Tour, and I remember the big album cover backdrop. Joe Walsh had just joined the group and he was on fire. Great show. As a bonus, no band member tried to pick up my girlfriend.\n\nTodd Rundgren (5)\n\nI’ve seen the greatest rocker never to be inducted into the Rock ‘n Roll Hall of Fame four times, and every single time he has been amazing. Just a multi-talented musician and performer. Most recently I saw him at the Taft Theater in Cincinnati and then as a member of the Beatles 50th Anniversary White Album Tour and he was amazing as always.\n\nElton John*\n\nI was lucky enough to see Elton at the peak of his powers, during the legendary Yellow Brick Road Tour. I can’t recall who opened for him but I do remember Kiki Dee coming on stage for the song, “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart”. I also remember that we had seats w-a-y at the back of the arena, near the top. At one point Elton stopped to thank his writing partner Bernie Taupin and pointed him out in the crowd. They shone a spotlight on him, and he was sitting right behind me. I asked him why he was sitting in the cheap seats and he said he liked to hear what the acoustics were like from up there. Cool.\n\nMarshall Tucker Band\n\nNo clue where this concert took place. Kentucky perhaps. Rupp Arena? I’ve no clue but it was during the “Heard It In A Love Song/Can’t You See” era. What can I say? I fell into the Urban Cowboy country rock phase for a minute.\n\nCheap Trick*\n\nThis one was at St. John Arena in Columbus and I recall that it was on the same Monday night that Marquette won the NCAA Basketball Title. 1977 perhaps? Let me check. Hold on . . . . . . . yep, March 28th, 1977. 67-59 over Dean Smith and North Carolina. Al McGuire’s last game. Anyway, at one point some kid from Zane Trace threw his ZT hat on stage and Rick Neilson put it on and wore it for the rest of the show. Wild night. Can’t remember who opened.\n\nRush*\n\nWent with a buddy who was a huge Rush guy, I believe it was in Dayton at Hara Arena. On a related note, Rush people are an interesting group.\n\nEdgar Winter Group\n\n“Frankenstein” baby! EWG rocks, man. Saw them at an outdoor show somewhere in Columbus. It was in a big parking lot and was sponsored by QFM-96. I think.\n\nJoe Walsh (2)\n\nI saw Joe just before he joined The Eagles, just after he released his “But Seriously, Folks . . .” album. Dude was really good with the crowd, and of course his guitar playing was amazing. I recently saw him again when he held a concert for veterans in Columbus along with Dave Grohl, the Black Keys, Nine Inch Nails and some others.\n\nKansas\n\nI told you about Kansas when I talked about Rick Derringer earlier. They sucked.\n\nPeter Frampton (3)\n\nI was a big Frampton fan back in the day, and myself and 3 friends followed him on his “Frampton Comes Alive” Tour. We saw him in Tampa, Louisville and back in Ohio. He was touring with the aforementioned Kansas, Rick Derringer and the J Geils Band. Trust me, Peter Frampton put on one hell of a show.\n\nJohn Sebastian*\n\nJohn Sebastian was the frontman for the Lovin’ Spoonful before embarking on a solo career. He didn’t have much success until he penned the theme song for the TV show “Welcome Back Kotter”. Anyway, I saw him as the opening act for, wait for it . . . Steve Martin. The show was at Mershon Auditorium in, I believe, the Spring of ’77 or ’78.\n\nJ Geils Band (2)\n\nSaw these guys during the Frampton tour, and one thing sticks out in my mind. Their Louisville show was the last show of the tour and lead singer Peter Wolf busted out the champagne. As usual we’d worked our way down to the front row, and Wolf poured a good portion of the bottle right over my head before I tilted my head back and drank the rest. Good times indeed.\n\nJohn Waite\n\nWaite was the lead singer of The Babys before starting a solo career. I saw him at a small venue in Columbus (The Newport?) and he was really good. Remember “Missing You”?\n\nWild Cherry\n\nYep, I saw these guys sing “Play That Funky Music” in a small bar on High Street in Columbus j-u-s-t before they hit it big.\n\nBarry Manilow\n\nI told you some of the artists would surprise you. I went with my sister and her husband Jigger, and it was a really good show. Vets Memorial I believe.\n\nDoobie Brothers\n\nThankfully I saw The Doobies before Michael McDonald arrived to wreck their sound with his so-called “blue-eyed soul”. Newsflash: It was not. I preferred the pre-McDonald days of “China Grove”, “Long Train Runnin'” and “Blackwater”. It was a fantastic show that I saw somewhere in Cleveland.\n\nJames Taylor* (5)\n\nAh, the original JT. I’ve seen him at least 5-times, the most memorable being the night I stole his jacket. From my original blog: I went to see him at Blossom Music Center back in ’78 with my friends Tom and Chris. After the show we ambled down to the side of the stage, just getting a look at the setup really. The roadies were tearing down the set, wandering around doing this and that. At some point I looked up and said, “Hey, look. He left his jacket hanging on the mike stand.” He’d worn it onstage and had taken it off during the show. Anyway, one of us (probably Tom) gets the bright idea to try to grab it. Nice plan but the place was crawling with security and roadies. I turn to Chris for ideas, turn back around, and Tom had already jumped the railing and was halfway across the stage. He was just casually walking like he belonged there. A couple of guys glanced at him but didn’t say a word, either because he looked like he belonged or because he was 6′-3″, 280-lbs and looked like he could rip your heart out and show it to you before you died (which by the way he could have but that’s another story). He casually grabs the jacket, throws it over his shoulder, and hops off the other side of the stage as Chris and I run frantically around to meet him. We walk away without looking back, expecting at any moment to hear, “Stop them! Thieves! They have James Taylor’s jacket! For God’s sake stop the bastards!” Except it doesn’t happen, and we make it to the car. At that point Tom tries it on. Obviously too small. Chris grabs it. Too big. Heh-heh. Fit me perfectly. Apparently, in ’78, James Taylor and I were exactly the same size. Anyway, that’s how I came to own James Taylor’s jacket. By the way, later I woke up wide-eyed in the middle of the night, realizing I hadn’t checked the pockets. The possibilities were mind-boggling. Carly Simon’s phone number possibly? Alas, nothing. Damn . . .\n\nCharlie Daniels Band\n\nAgain, this was during my country rock phase, which lasted about, oh, a minute and a half. Charlie was cool back then though, although I felt that way partly because I wasn’t aware of the right-wing conservative assclownery he’s exhibited the last 20-years or so.\n\nBlue Oyster Cult\n\nDayton, Ohio, in Hara Arena. At the end of the concert the drummer threw his sticks into the crowd. I got my hand on one but it slipped through my fingers, damn it.\n\nYes*\n\nI was never a big Yes fan, but I attended this show with a friend. As I recall I wasn’t that impressed.\n\nEmerson, Lake & Palmer\n\nSee Yes above.\n\nGrand Funk Railroad\n\nI watched Mark Farner, Don Brewer and the boys at St. John Arena in Columbus and they were great. I distinctly recall them blowing the roof off the joint with “We’re An American Band”. I think Farner found Jesus shortly after this tour.\n\nAmy Grant\n\nAnother shocker, amirite? Yep, I saw Amy at the Ohio State Fair and once again we were right up front. My girlfriend at the time loved her, hence my presence at the show.\n\nGordon Lightfoot*\n\nI’d forgotten about this show until someone reminded me of it recently. It was at Mershon Auditorium in Columbus, Ohio during his “Sundown” period. I have zero memory of it otherwise.\n\nHall & Oates*\n\nTalk about a great opening act. I saw these guys open for ELO in Cleveland at Richfield Coliseum. Of course, they were incredible.\n\nPat Benatar*\n\nYep. Big Pat Benatar fan, man. Saw her in Riverfront Coliseum back around ’82 ish. I remember being impressed with her lead guitarist and future husband Neil Geraldo too. Dude could shred.\n\nAlabama\n\nAnother Ohio State Fair show where I couldn’t turn down the tickets. Hey, it was the early 80s and the band was pretty damn big.\n\nBarbara Mandrell\n\nSame as the Alabama show with one big difference – Barbara Mandrell was smokin’ hot at the time.\n\nKenny Rogers\n\nYou’ll have to give me a break on this one. My mother was a big Kenny Rogers fan and I took her as a surprise for her birthday. She loved it. I’m such a good son.\n\nThe Alarm\n\nThis show was actually a surprise for me pulled off by my ex-wife Twana, and it was spectacular. I loved The Alarm (still do) and their show at Riverbend in Cincy was great. However, they were just the opening act for the big surprise, which was . . . drumroll please . . .\n\nBob Dylan*\n\nIt was 1988 and like I said, this was a surprise gift for me. Dylan was amazing as you might expect, putting on an unforgettable show.\n\nPink Floyd*\n\nIn June of 1975 I traveled to Pittsburgh to see Pink Floyd at Three Rivers Stadium, and they were insanely good. Obviously this was when Roger Waters was still with them, contrary to the American tour 20-years later when they were without him and I refused to attend. To me, the best part of Floyd was Roger Waters. Anywho, great show with flyin’ pigs and whatnot.\n\nMeat Loaf\n\nI saw Meat at a small venue near Lancaster in the mid-80s. This was after his success with Bat Out of Hell in the late 70s and before his big comeback in ’93, and he was in the middle of his well publicized emotional issues. At one point during the show he stopped mid-song and helicoptered his mic stand into the crowd, nearly decapitating myself and several others. It was like “Meat Loaf! YEAH! Woohoo! Wait . . . look out!” Fortunately he got it together and finished, but I remember his voice was freakin’ shot. Let’s just say Meat did not bring his A game that night.\n\nPaul McCartney* (10)\n\nYes, I have seen Sir Paul many times at many venues in cities ranging from Cincinnati to Indianapolis to Cleveland to Chicago. Perhaps my favorite show was the one in Columbus where a bunch of us went all out rented a suite. Our seats were right over the stage. Also, one year in Cincy I was in the front 8-10 rows which was incredible. With McCartney every song is legendary, plus there’s always that awareness that you’re watching a freakin’ Beatle. I recently saw Paul at Winston-Salem, NC on 5/21/22 and he was fantastic. He put on a 3-hour show with no breaks at nearly 80-years of age. Amazing.\n\nDan Fogelberg (4)\n\nFogelberg was always great live, and I saw him at Blossom in Cleveland, The Palace in Columbus and a couple other places.\n\nIndigo Girls\n\nI’d never heard of the Indigo Girls when first saw them open for R.E.M. at Riverfront Coliseum, but it didn’t take a genius to figure out they were going to be big.\n\nR.E.M.* (15)\n\nI’ve seen R.E.M. more than almost any other band, first on May 5th, 1985 at a gym in Springfield, Ohio in front of maybe 100-people, and the last time at Blossom in Cleveland in ’04 along with 20,000 other fans. It was pretty cool watching them grow from a small, relatively unknown band to a worldwide sensation. R.E.M. trails only The Beatles on my favorite bands list.\n\nThe Minutemen\n\nI saw these alt legends open for R.E.M. at Vets Memorial a couple weeks before lead singer D. Boon was killed in an auto accident. Memorable concert for sure.\n\nThe O’Jays*\n\nOk, technically I never bought a ticket to watch these guys. However, I did hear them sing along with me on an airplane. Not kidding. Here’s the story: It happened when my late friend Jigger and I were heading to Vegas back in the early ’90s. You’ve got to remember that I’ve always been quite the Motown/Philly Sound fan and am pretty knowledgeable about a lot of the groups of that genre. We’d been in the air for a few minutes when I thought I recognized a guy a couple of rows in front of me. Was that Eddie Levert of The O’Jays? I loved The O’Jays! What the hell, I thought. I went up and sat by him (keep in mind there were only about 30-people on the plane). Sure enough, it was Levert and the rest of the group along with about eight roadies sitting here and there. Throwing caution and common sense to the wind, I started singing one of their big hits, “Love Train” and begging the guys to join in. What can I say? I was overcome with joy at meeting the O’Jays and I was pretty sure I’d never have this chance again. Long story short, in a couple minutes all three O’Jays were singing backup to yours truly on lead vocal. One of the guys (Walter Williams possibly) actually got up in the aisle and was doing the dance moves as I stood and sang beside him. Surreal. About halfway through I forgot the words and Levert took over. I then attempted to join the dancing but failed miserably, to the delight of the audience. I then took a theatrical bow with the group as the crowd went wild (at least in my mind, don’t tell me they didn’t), the stewardesses applauded and Jigger sat there shaking his head. I believe I even followed up by trying to start a rousing rendition of “Backstabbers” but my moment had passed. The group got off at our stopover in Minneapolis, bro hugs were shared all around, and the O’Jays went on their way. And you know what? To this day I can’t hear “Love Train” without getting a big grin on my face.\n\nFetchin Bones\n\nThe Bones opened for REM at Bogart’s and they were great. One reviewer described them as such: “a band that must be seen live for a full grasp of their eclectic frenzy.” Couldn’t have said it better.\n\nThe dB’s\n\nYes, that’s how they spelled it. These guys opened for REM in Dayton, at either Hara or UD Arena (I can’t remember which). The band was led by Pete Holsapple, who later sat in on many an REM gig.\n\nThe Neats\n\nThe Neats opened for REM at that show in Springfield, Ohio.\n\nToad the Wet Sprocket\n\nI saw TTWS at The Newport sometime in the mid-90s. Can’t remember much about the show other than the fact that lead singer Todd Phillips didn’t wear any shoes.\n\nMatthew Sweet\n\nAh, another great Newport show. I’ve loved Matthew Sweet since 1991 and he did not disappoint.\n\nHootie & the Blowfish\n\nOnce again I saw these guys at The Newport, just before they blew wide open. I remember Darius Rucker downed about 8 Budweiser bottles during the show, and he often had one in his hand as he sang.\n\nThe String Cheese Incident\n\nI’m not really into Jam Bands, and I have no idea what inspired me to go to this show. Now that I think of it, I have no idea who I was with or where they played. Somewhere outside for sure.\n\nScreaming Trees\n\nThe Trees were the middle act at College Park, MD in 1992. They followed Gruntruck and preceded Alice in Chains. Of those three bands, I loved the Screaming Trees the most. The show was at Ritchie Coliseum as I recall.\n\nAlice in Chains\n\nSee above.\n\nGruntruck\n\nAlso see above.\n\nFugazi\n\nGreat show at the tiny City Lights venue in Indy back in 1993. I remember clearly that the tickets cost a mere $5.00.\n\nThe National\n\nThe National opened for REM at Blossom in 2004.\n\nBrian Wilson* (2)\n\nI was thrilled to see Brian Wilson during his Pet Sounds Tour in 2002. His backing band was the Wondermints and they were fantastic too. He played the album in its entirety, start to finish. Stellar, and the work of a musical genius. I went to see him again on 7.23.22 and, although came onstage with the aid of a walker, once he sat down at the piano he was magical. Sure, he needs help with the high notes but along with Paul McCartney I consider him to be a an absolute living legend.\n\nSteve Forbert (4)\n\nI put Steve Forbert in my Top 10 All-Time favorite artists. I’ve seen him at small venues in Newport, KY, and Granville and Worthington in Ohio (2). He always puts on a great show. One of music’s most underappreciated talents that I’ve met a couple times.\n\nFaith No More\n\nCaught these guys at The Newport (surprise!) in September of 1992. The main thing I remember is that lead singer Mike Patton had some absolutely killer pipes.\n\nHelmet\n\nI have very little recollection of this one. Sorry Helmet.\n\nThe Temptations*\n\nI finally got to see The Temps around 2008, and they only had one original member remaining. Still a great show though.\n\nZiggy Marley\n\nI can attribute this one to pure luck. One night in the Caribbean I was sitting at a little Tiki Bar, and a guy came up and casually mentioned that Ziggy was playing a couple hundred yards down the beach. Wait. What? Hell yes mon. I hustled down there and the rest is history.\n\nThey Might Be Giants (8)\n\nMan, I’ve seen the two John’s 8 times since 1992 (the last this past winter) and every show has been awesome. One of my favorite bands ever.\n\nOK GO\n\nThis group opened for TMBG the night the electric went out at The Newport and everything was delayed a couple hours. They were great, but my main memory was after the show when the lead singer tried to pick up my nephew’s wife out by the merch stand. Musicians, man.\n\nEels (7)\n\nI’ve seen E and the boys on several occasions, usually in Columbus but at least once in Cleveland. Big, big fan and E never, ever fails to entertain. I’ve been on E’s bandwagon since his early solo albums “A Man Called E” and “Broken Toy Shop”. One of the most underappreciated artists of my lifetime.\n\nThe Flaming Lips\n\nLove the lips, and I saw them at the Nelsonville Music Festival a few years ago. And yes, Wayne Coyne got in one of those big bubbles and walked out over the audience. Fun aplenty.\n\nBeck\n\nI used to volunteer for a company that worked concerts around Columbus (actually I only did it twice) but on one occasion I ended up being Beck’s damn backstage bodyguard. He actually invited me to stand beside the stage and watch the show. Dude really liked me for some reason, man. You can read all about it here: Bodyguarding Beck. True story.\n\nMartina McBride\n\nI must have received good reviews for being Beck’s bodyguard, because a couple weeks later they asked me to be the bodyguard for Martina McBride. Once again I was allowed to watch from the wings. Hey, I’ve never owned a Martina McBride song but damn she was a hottie. Anyway, I protected two famous singers and neither were harmed under my watch. My record is unblemished.\n\nCarbon Leaf (22)\n\nI’ve been a big Carbon Leaf fan since around 2000, and I’ve become acquainted with lead singer Barry Privett and the other band members. I’ve seen them at Kelly’s in the Outer Banks, The Basement and a few other places in Columbus, a little bar in Chapel Hill, the Southgate House in Newport, KY and The 20th Century Theater in Cincy among other places. I highly recommend this band! Update: I caught them at The Kent Stage on March 8th, 2020. Still amazing. Update II: Saw them again on October 16th, 2020 at Natalie’s Grandview. Amazing again. Update III: I saw them at the A & R in Columbus Ohio on 4.16.24 and believe me, they only get better with age. Go see these guys!.\n\nThe Wallflowers\n\nI have no earthly idea where I saw these guys. Maybe the old Capital Theater on High Street in Columbus?\n\nPaul Westerberg\n\nI’d waited many a year to see the former Replacements frontman in person, and it was one helluva show. It was at The Newport, which was perfect, and one of my friends said it was the first time he’d actually seen a real life rock star. Westerberg growled/wailed his tunes in black jeans, boots and a leather jacket, all the while smoking a cigarette and barking at the occasional roadie. At one point he played while laying on his back, and he added covers like “If I Had a Hammer” and “Daydream Believer” along with his solo stuff and some Replacement classics. Just an amazing, powerful performance from a rock legend that I’ve admired for years. I’ll never forget it.\n\nBen Folds (4)\n\nBen always puts on a great show, and the interaction with his fans is incredible. I last saw him in the fall of last year and he hadn’t lost a step.\n\nBilly Bragg\n\nThis show was at Mountain Stage, West Virginia, and was actually broadcast live on National Public Radio. For some reason I remember Billy telling the audience that on the way to the show his bus had passed a little town with an interesting name – Bragg. Weird the stuff you remember.\n\nMC Honky\n\nMC Honky was actually Mark Oliver Everett, otherwise known as E of the Eels. He opened for, you guessed it, The Eels. Strange but interesting night.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nYep, I saw her at OU-Chillicothe at the very beginning of her career back in 2007, performing before maybe 2500 people. She’d only had a couple hits at that time, and I remember she stood at the back of the gym after the show until she’d signed every single fan’s autograph. There was no dancing or anything like that, she basically just sat on a stool and played her songs solo.\n\nBruce Springsteen & the E Street Band* (2)\n\nQuite simply one of the best live performers to have ever lived. There was no big light show, no video screens, no theatrics. Just Bruce and the band playing straight ahead rock and roll. I saw The Boss at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, and it was unforgettable. Update: I saw Bruce again on 4.21.24 and he was even better than he was in 2002. His voice was incredible and the E Street Band sounded amazing.\n\nBuddy Guy*\n\nBuddy opened for Clapton at The Schott in the late 00s, and he was spectacular.\n\nBon Jovi* (4)\n\nAn ex of mine had a deep, unapologetic love for Jon Bon Jovi, hence the many trips to see the band. They’re crazy good live, and the trips were worth it to me to watch Richie Sambora play guitar. All the shows were at large arenas.\n\nGoo Goo Dolls (3)\n\nI saw the Goos in their heyday, which was sometime around 1998-1999. according to my internal heyday meter. I must say Johnny Rzeznik and the boys were pretty damn good. I cannot recall where I saw them. Update: I recalled. I saw them open for Bon Jovi at Nationwide or The Schott. Update 2: I saw them again this past Sunday, 11.6.22, at The Embassy Theater in Fort Wayne, IN. They were in fine form I must say.\n\nCracker (3)\n\nLove me some Cracker, and I’ve seen them at Kelley’s in the OBX, the Southgate House in northern Kentucky, and the Picktown Palooza (yes, such a thing exists). I’ve had the pleasure to meet guitarist Johnny Hickman a few times and am happy to report that he’s a good dude.\n\nGreen Day*\n\nI took my son to see these guys at The Schott in Columbus as part of my Expose My Kid to The Legends Project (he’s seen McCartney, R.E.M., AC/DC, The Eels, and several others) and they were just about what you’d expect. Those little dudes are like Energizer Bunnies, man. It was their American Idiot Tour I believe.\n\nAC/DC*\n\nTremendous show at The Schott, and for some reason I was pleasantly surprised at how good of a guitarist Angus Young is. I should have known I guess? Anyway, there were more 50-year old boobs on display than I care to recall.\n\nEric Clapton*\n\nSaw Slowhand at Nationwide Arena, and it was something to behold. See, even though the show was 2 1/2 hours long Clapton didn’t play that many songs. All the tunes were a long, bluesy numbers and every one was breathtakingly good. Although a few morons were yelling for them there was no “I Shot the Sheriff” or “Tears in Heaven.” To top off the greatness of the show, Derek Trucks was a part of the band and Robert Cray came out to jam during the last 30-minutes or so. Legendary.\n\nRobert Cray\n\nSee Eric Clapton above.\n\nAngels & Airwaves\n\nA & A is led by Blink-182’s Tom Delonge, and I went to The Newport with my son to see the band in the mid-00s. Kip wanted to get down front, so we worked our way down to the right front of the stage with yours truly against a railing. Suffice to say the mosh pit was deadly, my ribs were crushed repeatedly against the railing, and I could barely get out of bed the next day. Hey, you have to sacrifice for family. On a related note, it was totally worth it.\n\nThe Color Fred\n\nThese guys opened for A & A and I have very little recollection as to whether they were any good.\n\nFuel\n\nI caught Fuel at a small venue in Columbus, but I can’t remember the exact location. Interesting crowd at Fuel shows.\n\nThe Smithereens\n\nI saw these guys at the Roanoke Island Festival Park in Manteo, NC as part of a big summer show with 4 other acts. I’ve always loved The Smithereens and they did not fail me.\n\nScars on 45\n\nScars on 45 are English band that was a part of the Mateo show. They impressed me.\n\nGin Blossoms (4)\n\nI’ve seen these guys at the Manteo Festival, Summerfest, Bogey’s in Dublin, OH and with Toad the Wet Sprocket and Barenaked Ladies at Rose Music Center in Huber Heights.\n\nSpin Doctors\n\nAnother band at the Manteo concert, and believe me when I say they still have it.\n\nJoan Jett* (2)\n\nJoan headlined the big Manteo show in North Carolina and she was very, very good. On a related note, the Roanoke Festival Park is a stunning venue with the backdrop to the stage being the Roanoke Sound. Beautiful. I also saw her at the Sonic Temple Festival in Columbus, Ohio and she was great there as well. Finally, I saw her on 7.24.24 at Riverbend in Cincinnati. She was the middle act between Morgan Wade and Alanis Morissette, and she was incredible once again.\n\nSocial Distortion\n\nAfter years of trying I finally got to see Mike Ness and Social D at what was then LC Pavilion in Columbus a few years ago. They were everything I expected them to be.\n\nMudhoney\n\nMy buddy Goose and I caught the legendary grunge rockers at tiny Café Bourbon Street in Columbus in 2010. Lead singer Mark Arm, the man who coined the term “grunge”, was in top form. I felt lucky to have seen them, and Arm gave me the setlist. Boom.\n\nManchester Orchestra\n\nThis band opened for My Chemical Romance and Blink-182 in Cincinnati. My only recollection is that they had a lush, orchestral sound, hence their name choice I guess.\n\nMy Chemical Romance (2)\n\nI’ve seen MCR twice, once opening for Green Day in Columbus and once for Blink-182 in Cincinnati. On both occasions they were very good, and it turned out that the Cincy tour was their last.\n\nBlink-182\n\nMy son was a big Blink guy and this show was pretty special. I recall sitting in the parking lot waiting for the rain to stop, and when it did we debated whether to make a run for the gates. We decided in the affirmative, and when we were exactly halfway to our destination the torrential downpour began anew. We were drenched for the entire show. I also remember that the banter between Tom Delonge and Mark Hoppes was hilarious. Really good show.\n\nBand of Horses\n\nSaw Band of Horse open for My Morning Jacket a few years ago and I thought they were fantastic. I actually enjoyed them more than the headliner.\n\nMy Morning Jacket\n\nI don’t know, there’s something about these guys that’s sort of monotonous to me. Can’t say I loved it.\n\nBowling for Soup\n\nA couple years ago I went to see Bowling for Soup at the A&R in Columbus. The show was at 7:00, but as I am want to do I went up around 4:00 to scout out the terrain. I could hear the band doing a soundcheck inside, and there was a line of probably 150 people sitting outside the door and down the sidewalk. I thought what the hell, I’ll take a shot at this. I walked past all the people, up to the door, and as luck would have it the door was open. I walked in, nodded at a few security guys in A&R polos, and sauntered on to the front of the stage and watched the guys warm up. After a bit I walked to the back of the venue and was leaning against the wall when I was approached by a very large dude. I was expecting the worst, but the guy said, “Hey, have you seen Greg?” I looked around as if I knew who the hell Greg was, then told him, “No, not recently.” He then thanked me and gave me a knuckle-bump before departing. Crisis averted. Then, a short while later I swear this happened: The band stopped and the lead singer looked straight at me and asked, “Whaddaya think? Is that enough bass?” The world stopped for a second as the entire band and everyone in the venue looked at me. I nodded knowingly and gave the thumbs-up sign as the bass player shot me a return thumbs-up before kicking into another tune. At that point I had cred with the entire place so I could basically do whatever I wanted. What can I say? The secret is acting like you belong. Bottom line, I saw the soundcheck and the show, and both were great.\n\nBacon Brothers\n\nI was invited to this show at an outdoor mall somewhere in Dayton, and I have to say Kevin Bacon and his brother were pretty good. Somebody opened but I can’t recall the band name.\n\nLit\n\nI saw Lit along with the Gin Blossoms and the next three bands during the Summerland Tour a few years back. Lit was excellent, Gin Blossoms were very good, Marcy Playground was Ok, Sugar Ray was surprisingly amazing and Everclear was disappointing.\n\nSugar Ray\n\nSee Lit.\n\nMarcy Playground\n\nSee Lit.\n\nEverclear\n\nSee Lit.\n\nThe Hold Steady\n\nCaught these guys in Cincy at Bogart’s (I think). They were excellent. Really underrated band in my opinion.\n\nNathanael Rateliff & the Night Sweats (3)\n\nSaw their show at the Nelsonville Music Festival a couple years back and they were great. They also opened for Kings of Leon last summer, and I saw them at Express Live! in early October. Always stellar.\n\nSister Hazel\n\nUrban Meyer’s favorite band played Bogey’s in Dublin/Muirfield a couple years ago along with the Gin Blossoms. And yes, Urb and Shelley were in attendance. I used to know Shelley back in the day, and here she is giving me a shout out:\n\nSoul Asylum\n\nFor the life of me I cannot recall where I saw Soul Asylum, but I remember it being a grungy little bar type of establishment. Go figure. It was towards the beginning of their success.\n\nKings of Leon\n\nAttended a KOL show at Riverbend in Cincinnati last summer. Great band, great show.\n\nGuided by Voices (2)\n\nOne of my friends is a big fan so I went with him to see his hero Robert Pollard. I’m glad I went. Update: Caught GBV again at the Bellwether Festival in Waynesville, Ohio. Once again a fantastic performance.\n\nTedeschi Trucks Band\n\nAmazing band I saw during their Wheels of Soul Tour back in 2015 at the PNC Pavilion in The Natti. They’re unbelievable live.\n\nAvett Brothers (9)\n\nI first laid ears on The Avetts around ’03 in the Outer Banks, and have since seen them in Raleigh, NC, The Louisville Palace in KY, and several other venues in Ohio. One of my favorite live bands currently. Update: Caught The Avetts at Timberwolf on 6.28.23 and once again they were incredible. One of the best live bands out there today.\n\nTall Heights\n\nI saw this band open for Ben Folds last fall. Cool sound.\n\nTodd Snider\n\nTodd is one of my friend’s favorite artists, and I must say I enjoyed the show. I think we saw him in Cincinnati. I think. UPDATE: I checked. It was at the Madison Theater in Cincy.\n\nThe Pixies (2)\n\nThe Pixies were on my Bucket List, and thankfully I’ve seen them twice in the last year or so. The first was at Express Live! in Columbus and the second at an amazing show I’ll talk about shortly. Just a legendary, influential alternative band.\n\nJohn Hiatt\n\nI love John Hiatt and I finally got to see him a couple years ago in Columbus. I think it was The Palace, and it was just John and his guitar. Incredible performance.\n\nRick Brantley\n\nOpened for John Hiatt, and I remember his song “Hurt People” the most.\n\nG-Love\n\nG-Love opened for Jack Johnson and he was great. He came out later with Jack to sing “Rodeo Clowns” and it was amazing.\n\nJack Johnson\n\nI was never a huge Jack Johnson fan but he won me over a few weeks ago at Riverbend in Cincinnati. It was a laid back, mellow show with a tremendous vibe.\n\nFoo Fighters* (7)\n\nAh, The Foos. I’ve seen them 7-times in the past few years and they blew me away. The first show was in Cincy at US Bank Arena (formerly Riverfront Coliseum) and the second at Ruoff Home Mortgage Music Center in Noblesville, IN outside Indianapolis. The Indy show was special because we were 12-rows back. Incredible night. The third time I saw them was at CalJam ’18, which I’ll talk about below. Then I saw them at the Sonic Temple Festival in Columbus, Ohio and they were epic. We had backstage passes and spent some time in keyboardist Rami Jaffee’s private box. Amazing stuff. I also saw them in their first live tour performance after the pandemic in Cincy and their return was incredible.\n\nPS – Dave Grohl is a God.\n\nThe Struts (3)\n\nThe Struts are a Queen-influenced group fronted by a guy named Luke Spiller, who is fantastic. They opened for the Foo Fighters all three times I saw them. High energy, rockin’ band.\n\nThe Wombats\n\nI loved The Wombats back in the late 80s, and if you didn’t like “Let’s Dance to the Joy Division” you are a phony, a pretender, and you have the musical taste of a ferret. I finally saw them a couple weeks ago as the opener for The Pixies and then Weezer, and as expected they killed it.\n\nWeezer\n\nTo be honest I went to the Weezer show for opening acts The Wombats and The Pixies, but to my surprise Weezer blew the roof off at Riverbend. I mean, I knew they’d be good but they were way better than I expected. Incredible show that actually shocked me, and I don’t shock easily.\n\nJimmy Buffett (3)\n\nI first saw Buffett in 1977, again in the late 80s, and finally a couple years ago in Cincinnati. Buffett shows are basically one big beach party, replete with leis, bikinis and margaritas, among other things [clears throat]. You get the picture.\n\nSome of the bands below have been mentioned before, but I saw them all at Cal Jam ’18 the weekend of 10/4-10/6. What an amazing experience:\n\nNirvana*\n\nStill can’t believe I was at this legendary show where Nirvana (minus Kurt Cobain of course) reunited with Joan Jett and Deer Tick lead singer John McCauley to perform seven songs at the end of the regular Foos show. When Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic walked out the place erupted, and Joan and John sounded great singing the lead with Dave Grohl back on the drums. Incredible.\n\nPost Pop Depression\n\nLOVED these guys. PPP is Godfather of Punk Iggy Pop (The Stooges), Josh Homme (Queens of the Stone Age, Eagles of Death Metal), Dean Fertita (QOTSA, The Dead Weather) and Matt Helders (Arctic Monkeys) among others. Amazing show, and at 71 Iggy was still going strong.\n\nGarbage\n\nI really liked Garbage a lot. Shirley Manson definitely still has it, and her band was tight.\n\nYungblud (2)\n\nI was surprised how much I liked this guy. Trust me, angry British punk is alive. The Sex Pistols would be proud. I saw him at both CalJam and Sonic Temple.\n\nMetz\n\nEnjoyed this show as well. Rockin’ young band.\n\nTenacious D\n\nYep, Jack Black’s band was there too, and I have to say I didn’t love them. Hard to take Jack Black seriously as a musician after School of Rock, you know?\n\nGreta Van Fleet\n\nHonestly, I can take or leave these Led Zeppelin sound-alikes.\n\nDeer Tick\n\nLOVED these guys. Great band with 3 different lead singers. Reminded me a little of The Band in that way.\n\nGang of Youths\n\nI really liked frontman David Le’aupepe and this Australian band. Sort of a cross between U2, Springsteen and The Alarm. Lots of anthemic rock.\n\nThe Front Bottoms\n\nProbably my favorite new band I saw in California. I got to meet lead singer Brian Sella briefly, and I can report he is a good dude.\n\nThunderpussy\n\nThis all-girl band rocked the hell out of it, and Foos drummer Taylor Hawkins sat sidestage and watched their drummer, who was fantastic.\n\nGiants in the Trees\n\nThis is Krist Novoselic’s band, and I cannot say I’m a huge fan of the dreamy, psychedelic vibe they were putting out.\n\nBilly Idol\n\nBilly played the first night, and he did not disappoint. Dude still has the pipes, and guitarist Steve Stevens was as good as ever.\n\nCal Jam Bonuses:\n\nAt the backstage layout, I absentmindedly asked out loud what kind of pasta they were serving. From behind me I heard a voice say, “That’s Couscous Mac ‘n Cheese, man. You have to try it.” I turned around and it was Foo Fighter’s drummer Taylor Hawkins. Update: Rest in Peace Taylor.\n\nI also got to meet and spend a little time with the man who played drums on one of my favorite songs of all-time, The Church of Logic, Sin and Love by The Men. Suffice it to say that Dave Botkin was a great guy.\n\nI also had a brief encounter with Josh Homme that was very pleasant. Oh, and I watched Billy Idol for a bit beside Virginia Grohl, Dave’s late mother.\n\nThe Hives\n\nCaught these guys at Sonic Temple and they were great. I’s always wanted to see them and was glad I did.\n\nThe Interrupters\n\nAt the Sonic Temple again, and if you like music akin to Elvis Costello you’ll love these guys.\n\nPhish\n\nMy buddy had been begging me to see these guys for years but I just didn’t get the whole Phish thing. Having gone, I must say I had a good time. It was great music, great people and a great vibe. I’m not going to quit life and follow Phish, but I’ll certainly go again.\n\nSelo\n\nSaw this band at the Bellwether Festival and I was impressed. Good new band.\n\nStrfkr\n\nYep. That says what you think it says, and they were a lot of fun. Because hey, who doesn’t like spacemen crowd surfing and blow-up dolls being tossed into the audience?\n\nNick Lowe\n\nCaught the legend himself at the Joanne Davidson Center in Columbus and he did not disappoint. His voice is as good as ever, and his backing band, the legendary Los Straightjackets, were tight as hell. Loved every minute of it.\n\nTodd Rundgren, Micky Dolenz, Christopher Cross, Joey Molland of Badfinger and Jason Scheff of Chicago\n\nSaw these guys perform The Beatles’ White Album in Cincinnati on its 50th Anniversary and it was special to say the least. Amazing show.\n\nSmashing Pumpkins\n\nFinally caught the Pumpkins on 5/28/22 at Kemba Live! in Columbus, Ohio and they were amazing. Great great show.\n\nToad the Wet Sprocket\n\nI finally saw Toad on 7.19.22 with both the Gin Blossoms and Barenaked Ladies at Rose Music Center in Huber Heights, OH (a GREAT venue by the way) and they were really good.\n\nBarenaked Ladies\n\nSee Toad the Wet Sprocket above.\n\nRoddy Ricch\n\nThis cat opened for Post Malone on 9.18.22 at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, OH and I must say I liked the hell out of him.\n\nPost Malone\n\nCaught Posty at the above aforementioned show and he was electric. His stage presence is unreal, his songs are melodic and his relationship with his audience is really, really special. I have to say the crowd was as loud as any I’ve experienced. Loved this concert.\n\nWhitehall\n\nCaught this up-and-coming band when they opened for The Goo Goo Dolls in Fort Wayne, IN on 11.6.22 and I have to say I loved them. YouTube the song “Don’t Check Your Phone” to catch the vibe. Cannot wait to catch them again.\n\nDave Grohl\n\nDave was at the aforementioned Joe Walsh show and played with Joe and The Black Keys. Sadly no individual set though.\n\nThe James Gang\n\nI missed the James Gang in their heyday but I saw them when they reunited at, you guessed it, the Joe Walsh Concert for Veterans. They were stellar.\n\nThe Breeders\n\nAlso at the Walsh show, and I’d always wanted to see them. Excellent.\n\nThe Black Keys\n\nI’ve never been a Black Keys fan but I enjoyed their set at the Walsh show. However, they were overshadowed by . . .\n\nNine Inch Nails\n\nHoly Mother of God these guys blew me away. I’d liked a few of their songs previously but immediately downloaded a ton of their stuff after the show. As Joe Walsh said when he followed them onstage, “I’ve never heard Nine Inch Nails live but I feel like I’ve been in an earthquake.” I will see those guys again for sure.\n\nBrantley Gilbert\n\nSaw this hard rockin’ country cat open for Nickelback at Riverbend in The Natti and he was great. Pleasant surprise.\n\nNickelback\n\nThese guys get a bad rap from a certain genre of music fans and I know not why, because they rock. I saw them before a sold out show in Cincy with 20,500 other unapologetic fans and they sounded amazing.\n\nAlanis Morissette\n\nI finally saw Alanis on 7.24.24 at Riverbend in Cincinnati and she was everything I’d hoped for and more. She led a badass all women lineup that included Morgan Wade and the legendary Joan Jett. Alanis still has an incredible voice and amazing stage presence. Loved every minute of this concert!\n\nJ-u-s-t Missed Shows:\n\nThe Who\n\nYep, we had tickets to Riverfront Coliseum the night of the tragedy where 11-people were crushed to death, and we were actually on the way to the concert. It was my birthday (12/3/79) and fortunately we were stupid enough to think a party for me in Chillicothe would be more fun, and it might have saved our lives. And yes, I know about a million people claim to have had tickets to that show. We actually did.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd\n\nI had tickets for a show at St. John’s Arena in Columbus on October 28th, 1978, but unfortunately we all know what happened 8-days prior – their plane crashed in Mississippi. I’ll never forget waking up the morning and my roommate Jed telling me what had happened. And, being the 21-year old jackass that I was, I returned my ticket because I thought I needed the $8.25 or whatever the hell the ticket cost back then, probably to buy beer.\n\nPearl Jam\n\nI had tickets for Pearl Jam at Wrigley Field in the summer of 2018 but sadly my father was buried the day of the concert. He would have probably told me to go but of course that wasn’t going to happen. I’ll catch them at some point I’m sure.\n\nUpcoming shows: Crowded House, Burton Cummings, The Lemonheads and America ."
