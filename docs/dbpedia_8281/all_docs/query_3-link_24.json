        "text": "Stage and screen actor Bruce Davison (b. 1946) has been one of the busiest and most sought-after character actors in America for the past fifty years. So, fortunately, we all had the chance to admire his acting skills during the past half a century, from “The Strawberry Statement” (1970), the original version of “Willard” (1971), and the forgotten art-house film and little masterpiece “Short Eyes” (1977), to the insightful and wrenching AIDS drama “Longtime Companion” (1989), which earned him a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination, and the blockbuster “X-Men” (2000) with Mr. Davison playing the character of Senator Kelly.\n\nSwitching from leading to supporting and character roles and back, ranging from art-house and independent low-budget features to mainstream films and blockbusters—not to forget his work on stage and for television which includes Randal Kleiser’s award-winning TV movie “The Gathering” (1977), and his comedy episodes on “Seinfeld” (1989)—Mr. Davison has done it all. With over a hundred features and roughly fifty TV movies to his credit, which in truth also includes some films you have never heard of, he worked with the very best, such as Natalie Wood, Maureen Stapleton, Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman, Daniel Day-Lewis, Clive Owen, Juliette Binoche, and Emma Stone. And when you always work with the best, you are one of the best.\n\n“Grease” film director Randal Kleiser took the time to introduce me to Mr. Davison—thank you very much—as both of them have known each other forever and worked together on multiple occasions. Mr. Kleiser’s highly acclaimed VR project “Defrost: The Virtual Series” (2016) was their latest project up until now.\n\nSo when I had the opportunity for a one-on-one conversation with one of the screen’s most talented and most experienced character actors, I was all ears. And I don’t know how he did it because despite his hectic working schedule, this distinguished actor—a happy and happily married family man and father of two—granted me quite a bit of his time at a restaurant in the suburbs of LA. The food was great, but it was nothing compared to the insightful thoughts he shared over an early dinner.\n\n“The Strawberry Statement” (1970, trailer)\n\nMr. Davison, after I had seen “The Strawberry Statement,” which was a revelation to me, I was convinced that you were here to stay. And you did.\n\nWell, it was my first Hollywood film; I had done one film in New York. But I guess you’re right: after all those years, I’m still working. The opportunities are different now, but I’m glad to be able to work. The best advice came from director Robert Aldrich when I did “Ulzana’s Raid” [1972] with Burt Lancaster for him. He took me aside one day and said, ‘Listen, you don’t want to be a leading man. If you become a leading man, you will do six pictures and be washed up at thirty, and nobody will ever hear from you again.’ And he went on to name a couple of actors that it happened to, and that he had worked with. ‘Be a supporting actor, play the character parts, like the doctors, the lawyers, the chiefs, the villains, and the victims, and you can live a life and raise a family in this town.’ I guess that was the advice I took to heart eventually, and that’s the reason why I’m still working. And I’ve been able to raise several families in this town [laughs].\n\nWhat kind of a director was Robert Aldrich? Was he a tough director?\n\nHe was not tough at all; he was a graceful man. He was like one of the guys in “The Dirty Dozen” [1967, directed by Aldrich], and he was very gracious with the acting, but the most important thing for him was to tell the story of the film. I would say he was a story director. When I auditioned for the part and walked into his office, I said, ‘Mr. Aldrich, I just wanted to tell you “The Sand Pebbles” is one of my favorite movies of all time.’ And he said, ‘Thank you very much, that’s my friend Robert Wise.’ Years later, he told me, ‘That was the reason why you got the part; you were an idiot!’ [Laughs].\n\nAnd what about now? After all these years in the business, do you still have to audition?\n\nOh yes, I did one last week for an HBO show. That never stops; it comes and goes.\n\nReally? That doesn’t make any sense, does it?\n\nWell, that’s the way it is. I once played poker with Michael Lerner, George Segal and Charles Durning, pitching about having to go in front of a nineteen-year-old girl who doesn’t know who any of us are when we’re sitting on a bench to read three lines of dialogue to be taped by a little camera—like you’re getting a mug shot—and so we were complaining about the humiliation of it all. Charles Durning looked up from his cards and said, ‘Now, here’s your chance to act’ [laughs]. And I carry that with me, every humiliation I have to go through, but it doesn’t change after fifty years. That’s the way it goes, and that’s the nature of the business. And at the same time, this is Hollywood: people are successful, and then they’re not successful; people come and go. When I was nominated for an Academy Award, I had six William Morris agents in my trailer telling me about the next five-year plan, and when it turned out I didn’t win, I couldn’t get any of them on the phone the next week. And as I’m older now, it has become more difficult. I used to listen to people like Henry Fonda—he directed me in “The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial” [play]—and he’d say, ‘Well when you get older, they don’t have a lot of parts. Maybe three good ones this year, and they’ll probably go to James Stewart’ [laughs]. Jason Robards once said to me, ‘I’m looking at the pictures on my wall in my house; I’ll probably have to sell one because I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to work again.’\n\nDo you think you could have done more with your Academy Award nomination if you received it now?\n\nOh yes, if I received a nomination now, I’d have the six agents back in my trailer again [laughs], giving me the best scripts. If people win an Academy Award now, for a certain amount of time, they all get to pick out their scripts. There are a number of great parts every year, and they all get the first crack at all of that, and the rest of us are the lawyers, the doctors, and the chiefs. But that’s how I can survive: I don’t carry a lot of films, I’m in them.\n\nI always thought you were one of those highly accomplished and reliable character actors like George Sanders, Eli Wallach, and Claude Rains.\n\nI have to tell you this story. When I was a little boy—four or five years old—I had a record of Claude Rains doing “David and Goliath” and “Joseph and his Coat of Many Colors.” When my mother would tell me to go to bed, I would come down and stand at the top of the steps and say [imitating Claude Rains], ‘This is the story of David and Goliath, the young shepherd boy who went on to fight the giants.’ And all the adults would fall down and laugh, so I learned as a kid that I was a mimic and that I could mimic voices. That was my first inkling to the power of the word, the cinema and character acting. Claude Rains was my first hero because I got to imitate him.\n\nHe passed away shortly before you entered films, but did you ever meet him?\n\nNo, I never met him, but I got to meet James Mason when I did “The Strawberry Statement.” I was doing interviews for Life Magazine, and I said to him, ‘That scene in “Odd Man Out” [1947, directed by Carol Reed] when you’re on the steps, you’re dying, and your drool is coming out of your mouth, that’s the most incredible moment I’ve ever seen on film.’ And he said [imitating James Mason], ‘Oh, I’ve never seen that, I just can’t bear to watch myself.’ I thought, ‘This guy is nuts!’ But now that’s what is happening to me; I’m also having such a hard time watching myself on film. Katharine Hepburn once said, ‘Who wants to see yourself rot?’ [Laughs].\n\nDo you have a specific working method as an actor? Do you like to improvise, for example?\n\nThat depends because every project is different, every job is completely different. I mean, when you do Shakespeare, you can’t change the lines, and you can’t improvise, but for “Harry and the Hendersons” [TV series, 1991-1993], you can do different things and change scenes. But basically, every job is as different as there are people—it’s like any other business. There is great material that you have to have a real reverence for, and there’s stuff that you simply have to make work.\n\nThat’s the challenge?\n\nWell, there’s always a new challenge in everything you do. I try to do stories that are of interest to me, but that’s not always the case. Sometimes you have to try to make things work.\n\nWhen you read a script for the first time, do you focus on the story or on the character you’re about to play?\n\nThe first thing I do is to see how many lines I have to memorize [laughs]. Where’s my character? Does he go all the way through? And then I sit down and read the story. But for the most part, I always hope to play a really worthwhile, interesting character, and you can find some of the best parts in little scenes like Beatrice Straight did in “Network” [1976]. She won an Academy Award for a scene of something like two minutes. So you never know if it’s a great part unless you really focus on the story that is being told.\n\nDo you still need a lot of direction when you’re on the set shooting a scene?\n\n[Laughs]. That is a good question to answer. My biggest problem is, can people leave me alone in letting me do what I do. Sometimes directors are like traffic cops, but then there are others that come along that are very specific. I’ve become a little bit paranoid because I’ve been let down the wrong path a number of times, but there are wonderful directors, and I usually like to work with them a few times to really understand them. Some of them are so specific about every moment that I am wiped out by the time I’m done working with them. But at the same time, I look at the work that they have created out of me, and I find it better than anything that I had in mind or could come up with in the first place. So it’s worth it, but those opportunities are not always something you notice immediately or that you are aware of. Sometimes a director can drive you crazy with stuff, and you’ll be let down the wrong path, or he will force you to be overacting in a scene when you know better. But it all varies. Once again, there are great directors, and others are, like Shakespeare said, ‘some of nature’s journeymen.’ I worked with great directors and some that aren’t so great.\n\nWho do you consider some of the great directors you worked with? Robert Altman?\n\nSure, I loved him because he loved actors, and what was great about him, he was a real improviser and worked with actors on an improvisatory scale. He always knew what he wanted, every shot, but lots of times, the acting would be open to improvisation. I worked with him on a film that had the least improvisation because it was the tightest script—“Short Cuts” [1993]—but in a lot of his films, you can see the improvisation. I also liked Ken Russell a lot [“Crimes of Passion,” 1984]. He was a total madman, and I certainly liked Robert Aldrich. Raoul Coutard was a great cameraman, wonderful to work with [“The Jerusalem File,” 1972]. Steven Spielberg was a great friend, although I never got to work with him, except for playing an extra in “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” [1977] because we were friends. I got off the mothership as one of the pilots. Steven was an early friend of mine, and I remember an agent one time telling me that Steven was a genius. I thought that was just agent talk, but over the years, I watched Steven be that genius. He can watch five cameras at the same time and be editing in his head as he’s creating his story. But I’m not in Steven’s league; he sort of left everybody in the dust. But the old Laurel Canyon group… we were all neighbors. We all lived on Laurel Canyon back in the early seventies when he was sneaking into Universal. At that time, there were a lot of folk musicians, too, with Joni Mitchell and Graham Nash living at the top or at the bottom of the hill. Helen Reddy was a friend; David Geffen was just producing music then, putting Crosby Stills & Nash together in those early years. So there was a lot of Laurel Canyon stuff happening. Frank Zappa, Alice Cooper, and Mickey Dolenz were living there too. It was all a hang-out at that time.\n\nAre you nostalgic about that era?\n\nNo, I had a miserable time. I was stoned and drugged most of the time. I mean, I had some fun, but I was kind of a wreck too.\n\nGoing back to your craft as an actor, what was it like for you to appear in Randal Kleiser’s VR series “Defrost”? Did you have to adjust in any way as an actor?\n\nOh yes, for every camera angle, wide shot or close-up, anything. It’s the same with stage work. Hume Cronyn, a wonderful friend of mine, told me he was always playing old men even when he was a young kid. When he came out to Hollywood to do his first film, “Shadow of a Doubt” [1943], for Alfred Hitchcock, he was playing an older character and he was in a scene at a dinner table with Joseph Cotten and Teresa Wright, and she had to yell at him. Hitchcock then told him, ‘When she yells at you like that, come into her and look at her.’ But he said, ‘That doesn’t feel natural, Mr. Hitchcock, it just doesn’t feel right.’ Then Hitchcock said, ‘Fine. Be a natural actor with your head cut off or have a close-up. What’s it gonna be?’ That was his first lesson in film acting. He came from the stage! I always remembered that because every camera angle requires a different kind of acting. If the camera is right here in your face, or if it’s further away, that makes a huge difference.\n\nWhen you prepare for a scene, are there certain things you keep in mind—other than what you have to do and what you have to say?\n\nNot really because there’s always something going on on a film set, so the worst part of film acting is the distraction. There’s always an interruption, there are eight hours setting up camera lights, and then hours between each shot, and you have to maintain what you were doing a few seconds ago. If you were in an emotional state of some sort, that’s the most challenging part of acting. You always have to recreate the reality of the truth while at the same time it’s all illusion.\n\nDo you still enjoy acting as much as you did fifty years ago?\n\nIf they offer me something that I’m really devoted to, yes. But those opportunities don’t come along very often. They come along occasionally. There are a few opportunities in our lives that we get to do something of great quality, for supporting character actors especially. But yet, I’m working more than most people I know in terms of credits.\n\n“Longtime Companion” [1989] was one of those unique opportunities?\n\nAbsolutely. That was very meaningful. So was Randal Kleiser’s “It’s My Party” [1996]. People sometimes ask me, ‘Wasn’t it difficult to do “Longtime Companion”?’ And my answer is always, ‘No. It was difficult doing the sitcom “Harry and the Hendersons” for three years!’ I saw the film again recently; it’s probably one of the very few films to hold up as well today as it did when it was made. The acting, the story, the writing—it’s such a pure story, it really is. Telling this story from one certain group of people’s point of view, a story about a whole group of people living through the AIDS holocaust, the AIDS crisis, was terribly important.\n\nThe 1989 Golden Globe nominees for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture were Armand Assante (“Q&A”), Bruce Davison (“Longtime Companion”), Hector Elizondo (“Pretty Woman”), Andy Garcia (“The Godfather, Part III”), Al Pacino (“Dick Tracy”), and Joe Pesci (“Goodfellas”). Presenters were Macaulay Culkin and Mickey Rooney.\n\nYour speech when you received your Golden Globe was very relevant too.\n\nI remember that night very well. Christopher Reeve said to me, ‘That was the only political speech tonight.’ The Golden Globes and the Academy Award nomination certainly catapulted me to a whole other level for some time, and then that time passes. I got to do “Short Cuts” with Robert Altman after that. It was funny because I got invited to go to the right parties for a period of time, so I finally went up to Altman and said, ‘You’ve been scaring me for years. I wanted to introduce myself to you on the street, but you looked like you’d bite my head off, so I stayed away. But now, I just want to say hello.’ The next day I got a call from my agent who said, ‘We’ve been working on this Robert Altman picture for you, and we’ve gotten you an audition and an interview’ [laughs]. So I went in, and there was Robert Altman making bread, and he said, ‘Well, I’m making this picture. Jeff Daniels fell out; you want to do it?’ That was my audition [laughs]. So much of what happens is a result of being in the right place at the right time.\n\nAnd when you’re working, do you need a lot of takes?\n\nI like to get it right away. I don’t think it helps when you have to do things over and over again, but it depends: sometimes things start to occur to you as you work and see more, and it depends on who’s being shot first. I just played a part with a lot of dialogue, and I was sort of panicking. But the director shot the girl first with all the reactions, so after five hours of doing that, I knew what I was going to do. Also, I had seen what she was doing, so I could play it out, and that worked really well. But any time before that, I would have said to you, ‘I want to get it over with’ [laughs]. I’m learning things every time I work—new stuff, new ways to work—I haven’t fallen into any set pattern. So yes, sometimes twenty takes will work, sometimes just one. Do I like to get it over with, or do I like to wait? I don’t know. But I like to be as spontaneous as possible. One thing some of the greatest actors have taught me, just by watching them, is never ever to underestimate the insecurity of an actor, no matter who it is, Ian McKellen [they made four films together], or Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman [“Runaway Jury,” 2003]. You have to support that. You know, William A. Wellman, one of the founders of Hollywood, was a great mentor of mine. I had dated his youngest daughter. He was just a revelation to me, he taught me so much, and one day, I asked him, ‘Why did you stop working?’ And he said, ‘Television! Master shot, over the shoulder, over the shoulder, close-up, close-up, move on, next shot by lunch… it’s like making sandwiches, while it’s all about the bouncing ball’ [moves his forefinger up and down]. The bouncing ball is the essence of a scene, the story, the moment, what’s important. He also said, ‘When I was making “The Ox-Box Incident” [1942], I broke [Darryl F.] Zanuck’s jaw over the fact that he wanted a close-up of Henry Fonda with tears running down his face, reading a letter at the end of the film. All you see is his mouth and a cowboy hat in front of his face when he’s reading the letter. But I wanted the letter because it’s all about the letter. But it’s not about Fonda or the tears or anything else, it’s about telling that story: they hung these guys, they killed these guys, and now they find out how? Through the letter! It’s not about looking in the audience with any emotion or anything.’ He also said that the most important thing in filmmaking, besides acting and directing, is to tell a story as cleanly and as purely as you possibly can. Everything else is lettuce on your sandwich.\n\nWhere do you put yourself as an actor in Mr. Wellman’s view?\n\nAn actor tells the story through his character and his acting: the actions you make, the choices you make, it’s not all about just emotion, it’s about what you do. Love is a verb. And maybe the character has a journey: it starts here, and it ends up there.\n\nIs it important to know, or at least think about what happened to your character before he first appears on the screen?\n\nYeah, that’s even important to know when or how he’s going to walk through a door. You do as much preparation as you can, but at the same time, it has to be fluid and it has to be honest in the moment. I teach acting occasionally, about auditioning or just about acting in a scene. I think there are three important rules for an actor in a scene. The first one is, a thing is what it is. Suppose somebody wants you to play King Lear, you walk into a room, and there’s a weak three-cornered stool. That’s your throne? Yes, that’s your throne. A thing is what it is. Number two: you gotta own it. You accept what it is, and you don’t pretend it to be something it’s not. The third one is, then you can create anything out of that. Once you own something, you can go anywhere with it. If you know what you’re doing, you know the place; you can walk into a room, you know the environment that you’re in, then you can create anything because you’re on solid ground within that environment. That’s the most important thing I can teach about acting. I have been astounded by the fact that some of those students can just turn around and suddenly do brilliant work. And I can be moved and shocked that it lives in their souls, that it was in there the whole time. If a person comes to me and he’s acting all over the place, then I’d say, ‘Okay, stop. Where are you now, what are you doing, what’s going on, what are you sitting on—a thing is what it is—why are you looking at me… you own that now? All right, now talk to me, tell me your lines.’ And then—boom!—suddenly there it is.\n\nLike watching those students at work, do you also like to watch actors at work when you’re on the set?\n\nYes, and I’m always amazed by the work they do. I remember working with Daniel Day-Lewis on “The Crucible” [1996] and Nicholas Hytner was a wonderful director. Daniel was very friendly during rehearsals—we just rehearsed briefly because he didn’t like to rehearse—and when we started to shoot, he wouldn’t talk with me. He didn’t speak to me the whole time, twelve weeks. I talked to [actor] Jeffrey Jones about it and asked him, ‘What’s his problem?’ And he said, ‘We are his enemies!’ And when we got to the end of the shoot—we were all out there, and it started to get dark on the last day and the last moment of shooting—the director said, ‘Well, we lost the light, but I think we got our film, I think we’re done.’ And Daniel turned to me and, I started to cry. And then I got it. To watch his devotion was very remarkable. He always came to the set, and together with the crew, he built the set—the town—with seventeenth-century tools. The nails were like the nails from the 1600s, those square things, hammered in with a rock—that’s the way they built the set. And he built it with the crew! So it was amazing to see him work like that. I could never do it. But that’s why he’s so brilliant in what he does and why it’s so painful for him to continue. So an actor, he pays the ultimate price for his roles. That’s the kind of an actor he is: it’s all about acting, nothing else exists, there’s only the work—no friendships or anything. I just come in and play the lawyer or the doctor and go home [laughs]. In between takes, I’m joking around, so I don’t pay that price. Although I do sometimes, but very rarely. For the most part, you know, it’s a job. He would never do any of the work I do. He would wait for three years and make shoes until the next part comes along. I couldn’t do that. I’d do seventy-two episodes of “Harry and the Hendersons” to pay for my son’s college.\n\nAnd yet, I think you were always underestimated.\n\nWell, thank you, I also think I’m underestimated, but that’s just me [laughs]. I don’t know; maybe every actor thinks that, but I’m not consumed with my career twenty-four hours a day. I’ve seen that destroy people. I love my family, I got a beautiful daughter, a loving wife, a son who’s now working on his own, and he’s doing great. That’s the essence, and that is what’s important to me—more than the job. If I had a great opportunity to have grabbed that brass ring when it came around, that might have changed things.\n\nDid you ever have any problems with your directors?\n\nNo, I don’t think so. I’ve been annoyed sometimes [laughs]. I had a problem when I was younger with being arrogant, thinking I knew everything, so some directors said, ‘Why don’t you just act, and I’ll do the directing.’ Ken Russell was funny—and he could be a bully too. He didn’t bully me too much when we did “Crimes of Passion” [1984], but we had this one scene when I had this horrendously abusive monologue, and he was doing very fancy camera work with it. So when I was doing this monologue, the camera was going all over the place, and I think by the twentieth take, I blew it; I just went up. Then he looked at me, and he started screaming, ‘You are ruining my American career!’ ‘No, I’m not!’ ‘You’re not?!’ And I said, ‘No!’ And that was the end of that [laughs]. I ended up going to his wedding on the Queen Mary with girls dressed up as Rockettes, and he was married by Anthony Perkins. I loved Ken Russell, but sometimes he would scream at people.\n\nYou also directed a few films of yours. If you could start all over again, would you still be an actor, or would you rather be a director?\n\nNo, I’d rather be an actor, because a director has to be a grown-up and an actor gets to be a child. An actor can say, ‘When is lunch?’ And the director will say, ‘Lunch? I’m three shots behind, don’t bother me with lunch! Why do you have to eat?!’ I mean, I love both, but I don’t know how good a director I’d be. I like directing, I like to have the opportunity, but I am at a point in my life when nobody is going to give me that opportunity at my age. They’d rather hire a kid right out of USC. There are a lot of choices I would have made differently; I’m not one to say I don’t have regrets, none that will kill me, but if I could, I’d like to fix a few things I did wrong over the years—and that I continue to do now [laughs].\n\nDo you also have any regrets about roles that you eventually turned down over the years?\n\nI got to meet Dalton Trumbo, and he wanted me to do “Johnny Got His Gun” [1971], but I had to turn it down because I was doing “Willard” [1971]. Trumbo was a great man. I would also have liked to play Billy the Kid in Sam Peckinpah’s “Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid” [1973]. I wish I could have gone in there and give him a better audition. I also auditioned for David Fincher for “Seven” [1995], and I didn’t give as good of an audition as I wanted to beat Kevin Spacey out of that part. If I could, I would go back and fix that.\n\nDid you ever pursue any roles?\n\nNo, I never really chased after anything, which is probably another reason I never had that great opportunity. I’m not driven; I wish I were, I wish I had more of a drive than I have, but I enjoy my life and my family. Acting isn’t the only or the main priority in my existence. For some people, it is, and that’s fine.\n\n“Longtime Companion” (1989, trailer)\n\nIs there anything in particular that you learned after fifty years of acting in front of a camera?\n\nYes, and it’s a quote by William Goldman, ‘Nobody knows anything in this business.’ They may tell you that they do, but they don’t know anything. Everybody has ideas about what will be successful, or what’s not… but nobody knows. Here’s a story that will sum it up for you. When “Longtime Companion” was being made, we were on Riverside Drive in New York, shooting in a building in people’s apartments, and if they found out that it was a movie about AIDS, we might lose our location. In the middle of the night, I looked out the window, and there were twenty trucks all over Riverside Drive; the street was covered with artificial snow that had been pumped in, there were hundreds of extras walking in 1940s costumes, and I walked down to watch this enormous production. There were two friends of mine, [actor] Ron Silver and [director] Paul Mazursky, sitting on their chairs in the middle of all of this, holding their cigars, and I walked up to them, ‘Hey! I am in this little independent film, but if I could just get one good break like this with a film that paid, your own dressing room and everything—being in a great film, boy, that would be wonderful!’ Cut to one year later. I am at the Academy Awards, nominated for “Longtime Companion,” and Ron Silver is sitting behind me. He taps me on the shoulder and says, ‘Our movie was called “Enemies: A Love Story” [1989], and it lasted one weekend. Be careful what you wish for.’ So nobody knows anything. You never know if you’ll be on that merry-go-round and spin around at thirty-three miles an hour, and the brass ring will drop down at the perfect instant for you to grab it.\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nMarch 23, 2019\n\nFILMS\n\nLAST SUMMER (1969) DIR Frank Perry PROD Sidney Beckerman, Alfred W.
