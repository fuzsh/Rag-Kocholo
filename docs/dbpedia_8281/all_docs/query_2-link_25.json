        "text": "3 November 2023, Barclays Centre, Brooklyn, New York, USA\n\nMy name is Tom Morello, and I am one quarter of Rage Against the Machine. I am deeply grateful for the musical chemistry I've had the good fortune to share with Brad Wilk, Tom Commerford, and Zach de la Rocha. Like most bands, we have differing perspectives on a lot of things, including being inducted into the Rock Hall. My perspective is that tonight is a great opportunity to celebrate the music and the mission of the band—to celebrate the fifth member of the band, which is Rage Against the Machine's incredible fans. The only reason we are here and the best way to celebrate this music is for you to carry on that mission and that message.\n\nThe lesson I learn from Rage fans is that music can change the world. Daily, I hear from fans who have been affected by our music and in turn have affected the world in significant ways. Organizers, activists, public defenders, teachers, the presidents of Chile and Finland have all spent time in our mosh pit. When protest music is done right, you can hear a new world emerging in the songs skewering the oppressors of the day and hinting that there might be more to life than what was handed to us. Can music change the world? The whole aim is to change the world or at a bare minimum, to stir up a shit load of trouble.\n\nWhen Rage started, we rehearsed deep in the San Fernando Valley. This guy passed by our place regularly and one day asked, what are you guys doing in there? We said, we're a band. He asked to hear us and we said, sure. He came in, sat down. This was the first guy to ever hear the music of Rage Against the Machine. We played him a couple songs. After we finished, we asked him what he thought. He paused, stood up and said, your music makes me wanna fight.\n\nThroughout history, the spark of rebellion has come from unexpected quarters: authors, economists, carpenters. But as Salvador Allende said, ‘There is no revolution without songs.’ So who's to say what musicians might or might not be able to achieve with revolutionary intent when the bouncing crowd makes the Richter scale shake? Personally, I'd like to thank my wife Denise, and my kids who remind me daily that the world is worth fighting for.\n\nAnd thanks to all the musicians and change makers who helped shape the band's collective vision. Rage has also been fortunate to have so many talented coworkers and co-conspirators who have believed in the band: from Michael Goldstone, the guy who signed us and insisted the first radio single be an unedited song featuring 17 cuss words, to the greatest guitar tech of all time, Slim Richardson. Thank you and thanks. And deep appreciation to the hundreds of others, from those who put up flyers to those who have moved mountains to amplify the message and the music. What I hear in the music is this: that the world is not going to change itself.\n\nBut throughout history, those who have changed the world in progressive, radical or even revolutionary ways did not have any more money, power, courage, intelligence or creativity than anyone watching tonight. The world's changed by average, everyday ordinary people who have had enough and are willing to stand up for a country and a planet that is more humane, peaceful and just, and that, and that is what I'm here to celebrate tonight. Fans often ask, ‘but what can I do?’ Well, let's start with these three things. One, dream big and don't settle. Two, aim for the world you really want without compromise or apology. And three, don't wait for us.\n\nRage is not here, but you are. The job we set out to do is not over. Now you’re the ones that must testify. If you've got a boss, join a union. If you're a student, start an underground paper. If you're an anarchist, throw a brick, if you're a soldier or a cop, follow your conscience, not your orders. If you're bummed out, you didn't get to see Rage Against the Machine, then form your own band and let's hear what you have to say. If you're a human being, stand up for your planet before it's too late.\n\nSo tomorrow, crank up some Rage and head out and confront injustice. Wherever it rears its ugly head, it's time to change the world, brothers and sisters, or at a bare minimum to stir up a shitload of trouble. And finally, a special thanks to my mom, Mary Morello, a retired public high school teacher, a proud Rage Against the Machine fan and a lifelong radical who turned 100 years old a couple of weeks ago. She's watching at home tonight, but she asked me to tell you this: History, like music, is not something that happens. It's something you make. Thank you very much.\n\n9 February 2024, St Leonard College, Brighton East, Melbourne\n\nPeter Clague is the principal of St Leonard College\n\nWominjeka and a very warm welcome to you all.\n\nIt is the proud duty St Leonard’s College to host this year’s Art Exhibition for graduates of Victorian & Tasmanian IB schools. Part of that responsibility includes providing the Guest Speaker who will address this formal opening tonight. You are doubly blessed as a result of that. Not only does it mean that you are shortly to hear from one of our inspiring Old Collegians (who speaks superbly), but that also means less time listening to me.\n\nIn fact, I only have two things that I want to share before Olivia speaks. The first is that this is a guilty pleasure for me. Along with my fellow Principals who are here tonight, I spend a lot of my time attending functions relating to school activities. And the Big Book of ‘How to Be a Successful School Principal’ says that you must show equal enthusiasm and no bias in all College events.\n\nPeople should never guess that you enjoy watching Basketball matches more than Hockey, or that you secretly like the Senior Jazz Band’s concerts more than you do listening to the Year 3 strings group torturing their violins. If you were a Geography teacher before you landed this job, you should always appear to be equally interested in Mathematics or French. And so on. You mustn’t have favourites when you are the principal.\n\nHowever, the St Leonard’s Art Department have already cottoned on to the fact that I have a huge soft spot for their endeavours. Which has a lot to do with the fact that, many years ago, my own son did Higher Level Art in his IB Diploma, and it changed his life. Which was remarkable given the fact that Year 11 was the first time he had ever shown any artistic inclination.\n\nNot only did he excel in his IB course, including in his Extended Essay, which was on whether the work of a little-known artist was actually art. (This was 15 years ago, and the newcomer was some fellow by the name of ‘Banksey’). He then went on to complete a Bachelor of Fine Arts and then Master’s Degree with Honours. I am proud to say that he is, today, a fulltime artist. And before you all get too excited, he is penniless. Poor as a church mouse. Although he wears that as a badge of honour, I might add.\n\nHe is also one of the most self-actualised, intellectually curious, and delightfully grounded people I know. And I lay most of the credit for that at the door of the IB Diploma Art programme. So, this is my happy place.\n\nThe second thought I want to leave the young artists in the room with is this. Even in the 15 years since my son graduated, the world has changed enormously. Social media, incessant shouty texting, and the rabbit holes of the internet dominate almost every aspect of our lives. Even those who strive to resist it have become consumers of vast amounts of content. Unimaginable volumes of ideas and imagery spill out of small screens and flood our lives every day.\n\nI am not going to stand here and tell you not to be passive consumers – just about everyone is. But I would plead with you to continue to be creators. Because creators are a far rarer breed than consumers. Anyone can take, but not everyone can make.\n\nI marvel at the magical, mystical process that happens between your neurons as you sit in front of a blank canvas or an inert lump of clay. It is wonderous to create something where once there was nothing.\n\nIn your Diploma portfolios and in your own private artwork, you have established the skill of being a maker. So, whatever you do from here forth, whether you become a professional artist or not, I would implore to keep on being creators throughout your lives. It makes for far more interesting people and, if my son is anything to go by, far more content ones as well. You fill me equally with awe and gratitude. So, thank you, and please enjoy consuming one another’s creations this evening.\n\n8 August 2023, Collingwood House, Melbourne, Australia\n\nLast October Joel Deane published a poem on his blog -- intriguingly titled, Things I wish my father taught me. I’m going to read it to you.\n\nYesterday is\n\nash. Tomorrow is\n\nsmoke. Today is fire.\n\nI don’t know what provoked Joel to write this fine little poem, but it’s hard not to think about the Black Saturdays of our recent past, and the fires that probably lie in our future.\n\nRead that way it’s a grim, even apocalyptic, poem. But it can be read in another way.\n\nEverything behind us has been reduced to embers, and the future can’t be seen – so don’t dwell too much on either of them.\n\nWhat we have – the only thing we have -- is the fire of today. The spark, the light, the warmth that keep us alive.\n\nFire is death and fire is life; the potential instrument of humanity’s end, and of its beginning.\n\nEverything in the poem turns on the two-faced nature of fire.\n\nJoel knows better than most that good poems are in some ways allusive and elusive.\n\nTheir meanings – even the meanings of individual words within them – are often not clear.\n\nThe reader has to do the work.\n\nAnd as we do the work, our imagination expands to fill the space the poet has left for us, and we find meanings in the poem that even the poet might not have intended.\n\nBut, of course, while Joel is first of all a poet, he’s not only a poet.\n\nHe has written three novels, and he wrote Catch and Kill, a superb account of the Bracks and Brumby Governments.\n\nAnd, famously, he worked as a speechwriter for both those Premiers.\n\nSo a question that fascinates me: how does a poet become a political speechwriter?\n\nHow did Joel make the journey from the ambiguity of poetry to the brutal, cut-through clarity demanded by political speech?\n\nHow, and why, did he leave the Shire of poetry, where language is life itself, and enter the Mordor of politics, where lovely words go to die.\n\nWhen I was a speechwriter, I learnt that trying to guide your elegantly crafted lines through eight or 10 speech drafts while an army of public servants, advisers and media people pore over it is like trying to walk a baby gazelle across an eight-lane freeway at rush hour.\n\nWhen Joel was appointed Steve Bracks’ speechwriter, The Age wrote an article about him and published one of his poems.\n\nThe Attorney-General Rob Hulls rang him up and said, “Your poetry’s shit, mate. It doesn’t rhyme.”\n\nTo which Joel replied, “Rob’s more of a dirty limerick man.”\n\nBut all frustrations aside, drafting speeches was one of the best things I’ve done as a writer, and I’m sure that was true for Joel as well.\n\nIn trying to capture the thought and voice of another person, you have to put away your ego. You sometimes have to express ideas you don’t agree with.\n\nYou have to understand, as Joel once wrote, that “Australian politics is suburban – it’s not the West Wing, it’s the sausage sizzle at Bunnings.”\n\nI never had the pleasure of working with Joel but I have no doubt he was a good speechwriter.\n\nHe was in the job for the right reasons. He believed in the people he worked for and in the larger social democratic ideal that they embodied.\n\nIn a time of huge cynicism about political language, Joel still believes, as he once said, that rhetoric is a good thing in the hands of good people.\n\nStill, the solitary writer in him couldn’t resist small rebellions, pebbles thrown under the chariot of power.\n\nIn 2005, he inserted the phrase, ‘constitutional conflagration,’ into one of Steve’s speeches, and somehow the advisers missed it.\n\nIt’s an iron rule of speechwriting: never insert anything that your boss might trip up on.\n\nAccording to a book on White House speechwriters I read, one of them once put ‘indomitable’ into a presidential speech, and was told to take it out.\n\nHe replaced it with ‘indefatigable’ – and was sacked on the spot. His replacement put in ‘steadfast’.\n\nJoel escaped the sack but he remembers watching his then chief of staff, Tim Pallas, making a bee line for him in the office after the speech.\n\nPallas said, very gently: “Mate, just wanted you to know that the Premier gave ‘conflagration’ a red-hot go.”\n\nA few years later Joel had to write a speech for Pallas. He threw in a ‘conflagration’. Pallas did not give it a red-hot go.\n\nJoel has dedicated Judas Boys to Michael Gurr – a close friend of his, and of mine, who died in 2017.\n\nJoel and Michael wrote speeches together for Steve Bracks.\n\nI feel envious not to have sat in on their conversations, as they riffed off each other.\n\nMichael once wrote that writing speeches for state politics meant “dreaming of the Gettysburg Address and waking up to the Cheltenham Chamber of Commerce.”\n\nBut when he spoke at Michael’s memorial service, Steve Bracks said that when you delivered a speech written by Michael to the Cheltenham Chamber of Commerce, it always felt a bit like you were giving the Gettysburg Address.\n\nI’m sure he would say the same about Joel.\n\nAs a former journalist, public servant, and press secretary, Joel was shaped by the newsroom, the bureaucracy and the political office.\n\nHe became a master of many voices – as the journalist Ken Haley wrote when he reviewed Catch and Kill, “Deane is several writers rather than one.”\n\nAll these cultures and languages Joel has lived in, all this poetry and politics, have shaped the writing of his new novel.\n\nJoel began working on Judas Boys in 2017, soon after the deaths not only of Michael Gurr but of his father, Barry.\n\nBoth deaths were untimely and shocking, and left much bewilderment and sorrow in their wake.\n\nOver the years, Joel had kept in touch with some of his old Catholic school mates, first at the Marist Brothers in Shepparton, then at St Kevin’s in Melbourne.\n\nA few of these boys had suffered the abuse that we now know a lot about but that had been hushed up for decades.\n\nJoel also dedicates his book to those boys “who lost their way and never made it back.”\n\nWith these awful events in his head, with an intense but entirely unfocussed feeling of anger, Joel began to write.\n\nHis labor in the salt mines of writing took six years and 25 drafts. It nearly killed him.\n\nBut I’m here to say that Joel’s pain is our gain.\n\nJudas Boys is a gripping read, with strong characters, a total page turner.\n\nI don’t want to say too much about the story. It’s an unfolding mystery, a roman a clef, as the French say. I want you to read it and turn that key for yourselves.\n\nBut I’ll say a few things.\n\nJudas Boys is in no sense a hidden memoir, yet the writer has drawn on some crucial life experiences. They include a Catholic boyhood and education, and his moment as a small, frenetically whirring cog in the political machine.\n\nHis narrator, Pin -- short for his surname, Pinnock -- works for Benedict Cox, a Labor MP who wants to be Prime Minister but is having to do his time as Assistant Minister for Regional Tourism.\n\nNow, Coxy is a piece of work. If you’ve spent any time around a political office, you’ll know the type.\n\nJoel describes him like this:\n\n“Cox is a trophy hunter. Everything he thinks, says, does, is geared to winning the silverware. He’s never told me what prize he’s after. He doesn’t have to. Some trophy hunters just want a seat in parliament, others want to be a minister, but they’re just making up the numbers. The thoroughbreds, the egomaniacs, dream big. They want to be prime minister, want it so much they fire themselves like a human cannonball at the world in the hope that the arc of their ambition falls in sync with the vagaries of the political gods. Cox is a thoroughbred.”\n\nIn this portrait I see Coxy so vividly. I reckon he wears a single-fronted navy-blue suit with a white shirt, very pointy black shoes, and spends a lot of time checking his phone.\n\nHe calls people ‘Comrade’, though he’s about as communist as Twiggy Forrest.\n\nMany years earlier, Cox and Pin had boarded together at St Jude’s, the upmarket Catholic school that gives the book its name, Judas Boys.\n\nThe book ping-pongs between two time periods, between Pin’s dysfunctional years as a political operative and his dark years at St Jude’s.\n\nAt the school Pin’s main friend – if that’s the right word for such a sad, damaged relationship – is David O’Brien, known to everyone as OB.\n\nI feel like I remember boys like OB – boys whose surface exuberance hides some deep sorrow.\n\nBoys who we know really need our friendship but who are also so annoying they drive us away, leaving us with deep guilt that in the end we were not large enough to protect them.\n\nJudas Boys is brilliant on the brightness, mystery, terror and cruelty of adolescence – at times it reminded me of Lord of the Flies.\n\nJoel shows how feelings for a band, in this case Lloyd Cole and the Commotions, can capture the intense urges and no words of teenage male love.\n\nOr listen to this. Pin, now an adult, has just walked on stage to give a talk at the school he once attended:\n\n“At first I don’t see the boys - just feel the impatience of so many young bodies harnessed, tied, and buttoned into matching uniforms.” That’s good writing.\n\nOr the portrait of OB’s Dad, Tom. He is a classic absent father. He calls his son ‘sport’. Anyone raised in Australian masculinity knows that’s a problem.\n\nTom’s marriage to Mrs O’Brien – who is the object of Pin’s desire – is not good, to put it mildly. Joel manages to convey this in one brushstroke:\n\nPin, the narrator, is hiding in OB’s bedroom: “:I listened as Mr O’Brien banged about in the kitchen – he didn’t seem to know where anything was…”\n\nBut what we gradually learn – Joel is good at allowing the mist to come very slowly off the mountain he has created – is that the life of the father has been blighted by the same power that destroyed his son.\n\nAs OB will say: the spark that was stolen from me was also stolen from him.\n\nThe villain here is revealed so fleetingly that you might miss him, like the killer in the Antonioni movie Blow Up, seen for just a second as the pictures develop in the dark room.\n\nBut Joel catches him in another vivid brushstroke:\n\n“His silver hair was slicked back, his green eyes cold, and his oversized head the shade of supermarket ham.”\n\nJudas Boys is about the passing on of trauma -- through institutions and through families.\n\nNo doubt it has a bleak worldview. The writer understands how hard it is to shake oneself free of pain incurred early and ingrained very deep.\n\nYet the book’s final scene – to which Joel brings all his poetic gifts – evokes, with no sentimentality, a faint, fragile and haunting possibility of redemption.\n\nJoel, as I read Judas Boys, I wondered whether it marks a new direction for you.\n\nWhether you have more to explore about all the cultures that formed you, and that have shaped your words.\n\nAnd whether that exploration might take the form of poetry, memoir or more fiction.\n\nAnd though you have already a fine body of work behind you, I am sure that the best lies ahead.\n\nAnd so it gives me great pleasure to launch Judas Boys.\n\nI urge you all to read it and to spread the word about it.\n\nLet’s celebrate the fire that enables and drives Joel Deane to write, and trust that it will burn for a long time to come.\n\n20 September 2022, Nashville, Tennessee, USA\n\nWell hi.\n\nI want to say thank you to [Bart Herbison, the NSAI’s executive director] for introducing me in such a generous way and I want to say thank you to the NSAI for getting us all together for this event. For me, tonight feels brimming with a genuine camaraderie between a bunch of people who just love making stuff. Who love the craft. Who live for that rare, pure moment when a magical cloud floats down right in front of you in the form of an idea for a song, and all you have to do is grab it. Then shape it like clay. Prune it like a garden. And then wish on every lucky star or pray to whatever power you believe in that it might find its way out into the world and make someone feel seen, feel understood, feel joined in their grief or heartbreak or joy for just a moment.\n\nI’ve learned by being in the entertainment industry for an extended period of time that this business operates with a very new, new, new, next, next, next mentality. For every artist or songwriter, we’re all just hoping to have one great year. One great album cycle. One great run at radio. And these days, one song that goes viral on TikTok. One glorious moment in the sun. Because on your next project you’ll probably have to invent a new thing to be. Think of all new things to say, and fresh ways to say them. You will have to entertain people. And the fact is that what entertains us is either seeing new artists emerge or established artists showing us a new side to themselves. If we are very, very lucky, life will say to us ‘your song is great’. The next thing life will say is ‘What else can you do?’\n\nI say all of this because I’m up here receiving this beautiful award for a decade of work, and I can’t possibly explain how nice that feels. Because the way I see it, this is an award that celebrates a culmination of moments. Challenges. Gauntlets laid down. Albums I’m proud of. Triumphs. Strokes of luck or misfortune. Loud, embarrassing errors and the subsequent recovery from those mistakes, and the lessons learned from all of it. This award celebrates my family and my co-writers and my team. My friends and my fiercest fans and my harshest detractors and everyone who entered my life or left it. Because when it comes to my songwriting and my life, they are one in the same. As the great Nora Ephron once said, “Everything is copy.”\n\n20 years ago I wrote my first song. I used to dream about one day getting to bounce around the different musical worlds of my various sonic influences, and change up the production of my albums. I hoped that one day, the blending of genres wouldn’t be such a big deal. There’s so much discussion about genre and it always usually leads back to a conversation about melody and production. But that leaves out possibly my favorite part of songwriting: lyricism.\n\nAnd I’ve never talked about this publicly before, because, well, it’s dorky. But I also have, in my mind, secretly, established genres categories for lyrics I write. Three of them, to be exact. They are affectionately titled Quill Lyrics, Fountain Pen Lyrics, and Glitter Gel Pen Lyrics.\n\nI know this sounds confusing but I’ll try to explain. I came up with these categories based on what writing tool I imagine having in my hand when I scribbled it down, figuratively. I don’t actually have a quill. Anymore. I broke it once when I was mad.\n\nI categorize certain songs of mine in the ‘Quill’ style if the words and phrasings are antiquated, if I was inspired to write it after reading Charlotte Brontë or after watching a movie where everyone is wearing poet shirts and corsets. If my lyrics sound like a letter written by Emily Dickinson’s great grandmother while sewing a lace curtain, that’s me writing in the Quill genre. I will give you an example from one of my songs I’d categorize as Quill.\n\n“How’s one to know\n\nI’d meet you where the spirit meets the bones\n\nIn a faith forgotten land\n\nIn from the snow, your touch brought forth an incandescent glow\n\nTarnished but so grand”\n\nMoving on to Lyricism category #2: Fountain Pen style. I’d say most of my lyrics fall into this category. Fountain pen style means a modern storyline or references, with a poetic twist. Taking a common phrase and flipping its meaning. Trying to paint a vivid picture of a situation, down to the chipped paint on the door frame and the incense dust on the vinyl shelf. Placing yourself and whoever is listening right there in the room where it all happened. The love, the loss, everything. The songs I categorize in this style sound like confessions scribbled and sealed in an envelope, but too brutally honest to ever send.\n\nFor Example:\n\n“Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\n\nWe’re dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\n\nDown the stairs, I was there\n\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd there we are again when nobody had to know\n\nYou kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath\n\nSacred prayer, and we’d swear to remember it all too well “\n\nThe third category is called Glitter Gel Pen and it lives up to its name in every way. Frivolous, carefree, bouncy, syncopated perfectly to the beat. Glitter Gel Pen lyrics don’t care if you don’t take them seriously because they don’t take themselves seriously. Glitter Gel Pen lyrics are the drunk girl at the party who tells you that you look like an Angel in the bathroom. It’s what we need every once in a while in these fraught times in which we live.\n\nExample:\n\n“My ex man brought his new girlfriend; she’s like ‘oh my god’ but I’m just gonna shake and to the fella over there with the hella good hair, won’t you come on over baby we can shake, shake, shake.”\n\nWhy did I make these categories, you ask? Because I love doing this thing we are fortunate enough to call a job. Writing songs is my life’s work and my hobby and my never-ending thrill. I am moved beyond words that you, my peers, decided to honor me in this way for work I’d still be doing if I had never been recognized for it.\n\nLately I’ve been on a joyride down memory lane. I’ve been re-recording my first six albums. When I go through the process of meticulously recreating each element of my past and revisiting songs I wrote when I was 13, 14, and 15, that path leads me right to music row. How my mom would pick me up from school and drive me to my co-writing sessions with dozens of writers (and some of you are in this very room tonight) who 15 years ago decided to give me their time, their wisdom, their belief before anyone thought writing with me was a productive use of an afternoon. I will never forget you, every last one of you.\n\nPart of my re-recording process has included adding songs that never made the original albums, but songs I hated to leave behind. I’ve gone back and recorded a bunch of them for my version of my albums. Fearless, my version, came out last year and as I was choosing songs for it, I came across one I’d written with the Warren brothers when I was 14. I decided to record it as a duet with the brilliant Keith Urban. When I called the the Warrens up to tell them I was cutting our song 17 years after we’d written it, I’ll never forget the first thing they said. “Well, I think that’s the longest hold we’ve ever had.”\n\nIn 2011, just over ten years ago, my trusted collaborator and confidant Liz Rose came over to my apartment and I showed her a song I’d been working on. I was going through a rough time (as is the natural state of being 21) and had scribbled down verse after verse after verse, a song that was too long to put on an album. It clocked in at around 10 minutes. We set out editing, trimming, cutting out big sections until it was a reasonable 5 minutes and 30 seconds. It was called All Too Well. Last year when I re-recorded my 2012 album Red, I included this 10 minute version with its original verses and extra bridges. I never could’ve imagined when we wrote it that that song would be resurfacing ten years later or that I’d be about to play it for you tonight.\n\nBut a song can defy logic or time. A good song transports you to your truest feelings and translates those feelings for you. A good song stays with you even when people or feelings don’t. Writing songs is a calling and getting to call it your career makes you very lucky. You have to be grateful every day for it, and all the people who thought your words might be worth listening to. This town is the school that taught me that.\n\nTo be honored by you means more than any genre of my lyrics could ever say.\n\nThank you.\n\n28 April 2023, Sydney, Australia\n\nYou can read some analysis of this speech in this Speakola newsletter post\n\nWell thank you very much, Kimmy. I was gonna say all that. Now I can’t say anything because you said it all.\n\nYeah, that Olympics gig.\n\nWe we were on our way to that show, that biggest gig in the world, the Sydney Olympics. And first of all, Australians have a strange use of the word \"or\". Like, if you're at an airport and you've got a bunch of musicians and guitars, drums and keyboards, someone will eventually sidle up to you and say, \"youse in a band orrrr.....\". And there's nothing else you could possibly be! You're getting on a plane and you're going to Sydney. There's nowhere else you could be going and they'll say \"youse going to Sydney orrrr...\".\n\nWe were on our way to the Olympics gig and first of all, we're in this minivan with this guy who had a nose like a muscateale grape. He'd done some plucky elbow work and he kept on driving along. It was me and Greg and he's driving along and he's going, \"Oh, I love youse blokes. Yeah I love youse blokes. I don't like this new stuff but oh I love youse blokes.\" And I said, \"Yeah, can you just keep your eyes on the road?\" And he gets to a big hangar where we were rehearsing for three or four days and there's a gate and a guy with a clipboard.\n\nHe goes, \"Who you got there, mate?\n\nAnd he goes, \"Ahhh.... The men from down under?\".\n\nAnd he says \"not down here mate\".\n\n\"Danger? Men at work?\"\n\n\"No danger, mate. No, just men at work.\"\n\n\"Yeah that's it yeah!\".\n\nSo we go in and we get out of the car and this big civilian guy gets out of the car and he goes, \"Don't worry about a thing. On the night, stand on one spot, somebody will come to get you. Stand on that spot, he'll take you to another spot. Stand on that spot and somebody else will come to get you, take you to another spot, all right? And then walk across the field, get on the stage. Don't worry about a thing, mate. We’re professionals.\"\n\nSo we go and we rehearse this thing for three or four days and it's like everybody's there with thousands of big sharks and it's a massive production. And we rehearsed it very well. Eleven times. We went on after Kylie Minogue, and it's 160,000 people going to be in the stadium and, as they said, 4 billion people watching around the world. And it was quite nerve wracking. On the night we're standing in one spot, somebody came to get us, took us to another spot. We stood in that spot, and then somebody gave us ears to put in. We stood in that spot. Somebody took us down the down the tunnel, and it's a big, huge, 160,000 crowd. And we thought \"This is incredible!\" We stood in that spot. And then somebody else took us around to the very last spot before we had to walk across the field to the back of the stage.\n\nAnd we're standing there for what seemed like too long. And I remembered when we rehearsed it at this point, when Kylie was doing her song, we were already walking up to the stage. And we weren't. We were just standing there. And I turned round to Greg, and I don't know what he'd taken, he was foaming at the mouth. And he said, \"I don't think we're supposed to be here, mate …\".\n\nAnd just as he said that, the girl said into the walkie talkie, \"Somebody coming to get you, orrrr ...?\".\n\nAnd then we just sprinted across the field and got on the stage just in time for the guy to say, ‘ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Men At Work’. And we did the thing, and it was incredible singing the song, and Jimmy was there. He sang in the end, if you check out, it's really fantastic. Everyone was there. And afterwards we're out to the green room, and the guy that first met us from the minivan, he stood there and he goes, \"How bloody good was that mate hey? Fuckin' enormous mate, fuckin' enormous! Yers CARVED it!\"\n\nAnd I said, you know how you said to stand in one spot?\n\nHe goes, \"yeah\".\n\nI said, “well, somebody came to get us.”\n\nHe goes \"yeah\".\n\n“And then we went to another spot.”\n\nHe goes, \"yeah”.\n\nI said, “Somebody came to get us”.\n\nAnd he goes, \"yeah\".\n\nI said, “we stood the last spot”. I said, \"Fucking nobody came to get us!\".\n\nHe said \"Nobody came to get yers?\"\n\nI said “no!”.\n\nHe goes, \"Well, mate, you worked it out. You're a professional.\"\n\nSo I'm almost embarrassed at such an effusive intro.\n\nAlmost. But I failed the Leaving Certificate. First of all, I was born on the Southwest coast of Scotland.\n\nOne day my father said, \"Right, pack your bags, were off to Australia\".\n\nI said, \"Is that a long way, Daddy\"?\n\nHe said, \"Oh, yes, it’s as far as you can go before you have to start coming back again\".\n\nSo we came here and everything was different. I had this kind of accent when I came, and people would say to me, \"What kind of accent that you got, mate?\" I said it was a Scottish accent. \"You can't talk like that mate. You gotta learn how to talk like us\".\n\nSo I learned how to speak like an Australian bloke, just to assimilate, not to get into too many fights. And it was very different. Accents were very different. I come from a small town called Saltcoats. You've probably never heard of it.\n\nAnd everything was different from Saltcoats. And you would go surfing and your friend's mother would drive you down the surf and you fancied your friend's mother because she was hot. And that was also very different because you never fancied anybody's mother from Saltcoats. I apologise to all the mothers in Saltcoats.\n\nAnyway, I failed Leaving, the High School Certificate in 1971, and I came to Australia. Over the next few years, I slowly became an idiot.\n\n1971, I failed Leaving. And so I was devastated and so were my parents. I repeated it and now I did the matriculation year. And that's when I met my friend Kim Gyngell, some 51 years ago, as he said, and we connected immediately.\n\nWe would experiment with our respective floor shows for whomever would listen. And indeed, I was Kim's straight man for his first scribblings of Kim's character, Col'n Carpenter, which was born during that time. I was happy to be a straight man and still am. Indeed, Men At Work would not have existed if it hadn't been for Kim, because one day he introduced me to a beautiful, blonde, bright eyed, sharp witted, multitalented lad called Gregory Norman Ham, who I miss every day. So, Kimny, I thank you for your love and friendship this past half century and for making me laugh from a place that no one else does.\n\nIf I hadn't have failed Leaving, though, I would never have met Kim. Proof perhaps that apparent failure can later manifest into a more profound and successful destiny. I would like to thank a few people Milly Petriella, Dean Ormston and everyone at APRA AMCOS for bestowing upon me this prestigious award.\n\nI love APRA. They were the first corporate entity that didn't make me feel weird or insecure about following the path of being a songwriter. I'd like to thank Peter Karpin for signing Men at Work back in 1981, Peter Mclan for producing the Men at Work albums, and John Anderson, who was at EMI Music Publishing for many years. Damien Trotter at Sony Music Publishing for looking after the songs, but also for being my friend these past 40 years or so. Nanette Fox for being such a great manager and friend down here in Australia. Michael McMartin, who received this award in 2007. Michael gave me some great advice in 1991 when I called him up, complaining about something. He said, \"Oh, you're wallowing in self pity. If you try a little harder, you can become your better person\".\n\nAnd he was right. So I thank him for that.\n\nMy friend Mario Maccarone, who's here, who gave me a gig at the Continental down in Melbourne, one of the greatest venues you could ever play at, which is, sadly, no longer there. He gave me a gig when I couldn't get one from anywhere else.\n\nSo tell me, by the way, I know you've been sitting here for a long time, but I'll just speak for a wee while longer, because as Kim said before, hearing Uncle Archie before was quite moving. One Song, that's it. It says all for me. You start with nothing and then hopefully, at the end of some period of time, you have something. And it took me a long time to realize that.\n\nMy old band Men at Work, which I was very proud to be in. Unfortunately, we had a short but extraordinary run, and I'll kind of sum it up in a way with a few words, a little poem:\n\nWe opened up for Fleetwood Mac.\n\nA lucky break. A sneak attack.\n\nIt was only going one way back then\n\nTo the Stratosphere and back again.\n\n15 weeks at number one.\n\nWe toured two trips around the sun.\n\nWe were kings of the world in 1981.\n\nI remember the moment it stopped being fun.\n\nThe end of 83, we were done.\n\nIt was over fast before we begun\n\nTo be sure, the music remains\n\nit floats in the air through the supermarkets and summer state fairs\n\nIt was a once in a lifetime, I don't care.\n\nI got to the summit, I was there.\n\nAt the end of the 80s I had to leave this fair land. I was getting divorced and I was having trouble with the drink. And I had a record deal based in Los Angeles.\n\nSo I thought, off I go. And all my friends thought I was mad. And I had all kinds of beautiful friends, highly functioning, successful people, but big drinkers. And I was becoming an alcoholic. And it's not the kind of thing you want to realise straight away. You want to get at least 35 or 40 years of heavy drinking behind you, before you realise that, but I realized it quite quickly. And they really thought I was crazy. \"What are you going to go and live over there for, you’re fucking mad, mate? Stay here, mate. Stay here, mate. You're fine, mate. You're not an alcoholic. You’re just like us.\"\n\nSo I went to Los Angeles and I made one record. Then I was promptly dropped by MCA Records. So I had no record deal, no booking agent, no management. So I just went on the road around 1991.\n\nAnd I'm still on the road. I thought it would be a temporary thing, a distraction, while I plotted and schemed and figured out how to once again reach the lofty peaks of superstardom, where I firmly believed I belonged.\n\nI thought I'd be offered another record deal from an LA based label. But that was not to be. Indeed, I continued to tour, solo mostly, for 13 years. It's not for everyone, it's not for the faint of heart. But it was the only way to find my audience out there in the world.\n\nGradually, I realized that the path I was on was where I was meant to be. Audiences wanted something from me. Old songs, new songs, in between songs, to connect at a deep level. Playing solo to audiences all over the world was habit forming. Nourishing, unpredictable.\n\nA current forms and I feel connected. It's a frequency that's palpable. When I was finally able to stop drinking all those years ago, I remember standing out in the backyard. I stretched my hands up to the sky, yet my feet were on the ground. I felt plugged in. A part of everything. Not separate. I had a place in the world. I still have a place in the world.\n\nMost of all, I feel useful. And to me, that's an important thing to feel. My professional life involves three stages. Writing songs, producing and recording them, and going on the road and playing for people. The rest of the time, I'm at home perfecting my recipe for seared Brussels sprouts, a much maligned vegetable which has seen, perhaps like myself, a welcome renaissance in popularity in recent times.\n\nSomeone asked me the other day if I would recommend songwriting as a vocation. I answered them by saying I started writing songs when I was 14 years old. I couldn't help it. Some ten years later, I co- wrote Down Under. It took 40 minutes to write (without a flute line) and it has sustained me for 40 years.\n\nBut even if it hadn't, I still would be writing songs. I can't imagine doing anything more worthwhile after breakfast. So, yes, I highly recommend it. Indeed, in the words of the great Kurt Vonnegut:\n\n\"Go into the arts. I'm not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow for heaven's sake! Sing in the shower, dance to the radio, tell stories, write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can.You'll get an enormous reward. You will have created something!’\n\nThank you very much.\n\nAnalysis of this speech in Speakola newsletter\n\nLast night I attended the unveiling of a facsimile of a portrait of my father painted when he was fresh off the boat in 1941. Thanks go to Bruce Chapman above all, but to many others for organising. To Erwin Fabian, who pained the portrait all those years ago. It’s been over 16 years since Dad departed and I’ve made two other speeches reflecting on things, one at his memorial after he died, another, more general one using Dad as a foil to reflect on ‘the asylum seeker issue’. I needed to make another one!\n\nI.\n\nWhen Heinrich Schliemann unearthed a gold mask in Mycenae, he was reputed to have said “I have gazed on the face of Agamemnon”. In a more modest way Erwin Fabian’s magnificent portrait allows us to gaze back through time – upon the face of a very different person to the one we all knew.\n\nWhen Dad arrived in England in 1936, he was 15 and alone. He must have been scared. Met by a teacher from Herne Bay College where he was to board, Dad had no English. “Salve” he said, greeting the teacher in Latin. No dice: He was the gym instructor.\n\nThe portrait was painted just four months after the Dunera arrived. To find him in those days you just followed the signs in the main street of Hay to the “Concentration Camp”. Dad must have wondered where his mother Marianne was; how she was. She was taken to Theresienstadt. It was a way-station to Auscwitz.\n\nIt also had creepy similarities to Hay. Theresienstadt was Hitler’s home for Europe’s Jewish cultural elite. So, as the inmates quietly starved, it doubled as a set for Nazi propaganda showing how well Jewish ‘resettlement’ was going. As she waited to discover her fate, Marianne would sometimes have attended lectures, recitals, poetry readings, and concerts, just as Dad was doing in Hay.\n\nII.\n\nI’ll return to the person in the portrait shortly, but I thought I’d list some propositions I take from my father’s success.\n\nYou make your own life\n\nBut look after people\n\nKnuckle down. Work hard. Get on with things\n\nBut don’t be a workaholic\n\nTake yourself seriously\n\nBut not too seriously\n\nDon’t be shy. Chat with strangers.\n\nIf you’re nice to them, they’ll probably like you\n\nBelieve in, invest in, your own integrity and that of others.\n\nDon’t get on your high horse or start a fight unless it really matters\n\nYou’ll know it really matters if, maybe only if, real injustice is done to someone who can’t easily defend themselves\n\nIf you want your intellect to make a positive contribution to people’s lives, the trick is to combine a warm heart with a cool head.\n\nThere is no shortage of people with exceptional intelligence and no damn sense\n\nListen carefully to those who disagree with you.\n\nListen like they might even be right.\n\nBuild, don’t destroy\n\nBut turn your back on things if you have to\n\nAppreciate life\n\nIt ends\n\nIII\n\nTo me anyway, it’s important to remember that, however accomplished Dad was, however enjoyable his company, however much Max Corden praised his scrupulousness as a scholar, describing him as a one person Royal Commission, it was all built on the normal human difficulties and frailties.\n\nIn the last month or so we had plenty of long talks. In one he said “That’s the last time I really understood you. When you punched a hole in the wall of your room. That was the sort of thing I might have done at that age. Later I decided I needed to knuckle down. Work hard. Get on.”\n\nThe thing was . . . I’d not punched a hole in the wall. In a move that can only be fully appreciated with some understanding of adolescent AFL fans, in the dying moments of some unspecified Grand Final, I’d taken a magnificent ‘speckie’, descending from my ecstasy into the softness of my bed, only to learn that I’d not defied gravity by digging my knee into some obliging opponent’s back. I’d simply thrust it through the accommodating canite of my bedroom wall.\n\nIV\n\nAt Dad’s memorial I read a Yiddish poem from the child of Holocaust survivors:\n\nSleep my dear parents but do not dream.\n\nTomorrow your children will shed your tears\n\nI recall five years later – perhaps ten – sitting in a barber’s chair and some unusual – indeed ridiculous – facts came to mind. I fantasised again, not, this time the unheralded adolescent superhero. I’d become a great poet (again mysteriously undiscovered). I was composing a great poem that would uncover the sublime from the ridiculous.\n\nThe pity of it is, as you will appreciate, I’m no poet. I barely understand a lot of poetry. Still, sometimes a poem speaks for itself. As when I first heard this extraordinary fragment – a single sentence in eight lines of free verse – tossed off by John Keats in the margin of a page on which he’d been writing another, longer poem. Keats was 23, desperately in love with Fanny Brawne. And he knew he was dying:\n\nThis living hand, now warm and capable\n\nOf earnest grasping, would, if it were cold\n\nAnd in the icy silence of the tomb,\n\nSo haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights\n\nThat thou would wish thine own heart dry of blood\n\nSo in my veins red life might stream again,\n\nAnd thou be conscience-calm’d – see here it is –\n\nI hold it towards you.\n\nWhat did Keats mean by this last gesture, reaching across the chasm separating the living from the dead?\n\nIn any event, as the barber snipped away, tears swept down my cheeks, my mind flooding with grief for my father, rekindled by the beauty of this poem I’d never write. Self-conscious, I added to the surrealism of the occasion by managing to smile: Beatific, if somewhat zoned-out. The bemused barber asked if I was OK. “I’m fine” I said with such nonchalance that I surely convinced him, however momentarily, that his customers usually haemorrhaged tears, smiling blankly into his mirror.\n\nThe poem might have been called “Three moustaches: Three ages of man”. I expect moustaches were more important for the generation of my Dad’s father Willi than they were for Dad’s. In any event as a newlywed, Dad briefly experimented with growing a moustache. He and Mum both agreed it looked ridiculous.\n\nUnable to grow their own, Dad’s young sons urged him to grow it once more. It was a long time coming. Then, with David and I in our twenties, on a cruise to Hong Kong and perhaps the last time we spent any sustained time together as a family, Dad’s moustache arrived unannounced; initially unnoticed, but then unmistakable, becoming quite the full huntsman spider in the middle of his handsome face, before yielding, perhaps to my mother’s conviction that it was as ridiculous then as it had ever been.\n\nThen within a week or two of the end … the professor dying … that moustache crept up on us again, initially mistaken for some slip in Dad’s shaving routine. But after the second day and until his death, and in the coffin as he lay there, it stared back at us – as mysterious as it was unmistakable.\n\nWe can only speculate about what it meant – on what he meant. I guess like Keats, he was trying to say something across the chasm.\n\nHe was saying:\n\n“See here it is. I hold it towards you.”\n\nHe was reminding us, that no matter how much we love someone, they always remain, as life remains . . . a mystery.\n\nMagda:\n\nI don't want to put pressure on the next person, but the J in his name stands for joke machine. Please welcome the captain and first speaker for the negative, the sparkling, Sammy J.\n\nSammy J:\n\nWell, thank you so much, Magda. Thank you, Charlie. Thank you to all my fellow human beings who are watching this right now, here on this beautiful, vast, mysterious planet that we call Earth. The same planet that created every person you've ever loved, every song you've ever sung. Every kebab you've ever regretted, every grain of sand on every single beach, as the sun shines down on the dolphins, as they play in the waves and yet somehow this planet is still not good enough for the affirmative team who would rather escape to a barren wasteland then stay here and frolic in our own garden of Eden. Course, perhaps we shouldn't be surprised, but that's the behaviour that Charlie is putting forward today. After all, he was once a proud citizen of another blue planet in his past.\n\nAnd tell me my friends, What did Charlie do once he'd made a mess there on that planet? Once he sniffed the winds of insolvency and sold the share price plummeting? Did he stay and defend? Hell no. He jumped on a taxpayer-funded spaceship and made his way to the dusty red plains of the ABC. And now he's stuck there, left wandering alone, looking for signs of life, forced to participate in gruelling experiments to see how much the human body can endure in such a harsh environment, like hosting the New Year's Eve telecast for seven hours straight.\n\nWell, the affirmative team might condone such behaviour, but we on the negative side take a different view. Round of applause for my teammates Dulcé Sloan and Rich Hall. Together we will be attempting to convince you that an actual life here on Earth sure beats a fictional life on Mars. We may indeed have screwed up one planet, but that does not give us permission to screw up another one. My friends, we must stay here and clean up our mess.\n\nI will never forget when I was in my bedroom one day playing and my mother walked in and opened the door and her face just dropped. She was aghast, and it was just chaos in there. I've got to say, there was just Jurassic park figures flying around, the Spice Girls music was blaring, all spices. There were Lion King soft toys strewn across the carpet, just fluff hanging out. It was chaos, it was bedlam and my mother said, \"Sammy, you've got clean up your room.\" This was like two weeks ago, so she had a point. I was going through a rough patch and I don't know about you, but when I'm stressed, I just need to visualise a velociraptor disembowelling Simba. It really helps me. Or any Lion King character. Nala or Zazu or Timon or Pumbaa or Mufasa or Scar or Sarabi. Sarabi for those who don't know is Simba's mother in the Lion King, not that you can tell from the lack of screen time they give her, despite the fact she's the only character to consistently stand up to Scar from the beginning while her useless piece of shit, son, Simba runs away at the first sign of trouble. But that's women in Hollywood for you!\n\nAnd the point is when my mother told me to clean up my room, did I say, \"Oh, don't worry, I'll do a Simba and run away? Did I say, \"Don't worry, mom, just build me a new bedroom up the hall. That'll be clean.\" No, I stayed up. I tidied up my mess. Because what example are we sending to our children if we say, Earth is ruined. Let's move to another planet\"? That's not the circle of life. That's the oblong of death. It's avoiding responsibility for a problem that we created.\n\nNow, Charlie talked about the first words on Mars. I want to talk about some words right now. I want to talk about the word, must that is in this topic, that we must go to Mars. Look at that word. It's a fascinating little word, isn't it? I mean M and U are not natural bedfellows yet there they are snuggled up side by side with the S viewing on like a creep and the T pleasuring itself in the carpet. I mean, it's just, it's a creepy little word. It's a four letter word and yet I struggled to think of another four letter word that has done as much damage to mankind as the word must — except maybe tofu, or tuba or Trump, which to be fair, it's a five letter word, but let's not let facts get in the way of our argument now. It's what he would have wanted.\n\nPoint is my friends, the word must has been responsible for some of the history's worst abuses. We must conquer that land. We must fight that war. We must dedicate seven days straight media coverage to a bit of sandpaper and a cricket ball despite the fact that indigenous life expectancy is 10 years lower than the rest of us, but don't worry about that because the boys in the baggy green have brought shame on our nation. Real shame, not that silly life expectancy shame, real shame.\n\n\"Oh Sammy, don't. No, don't make fun of the boys in the baggy green. Oh, they've had a hard time. The boys in the baggy green. Oh little boys in the baggy green, [baby talk] I just want to gobble you up. Oh, now I'm pooing out the boys in the baggy green. Oh, put them in a little bag and throw away the boys in the baggy green.\" The boys in the baggy green, they'll be okay, don't worry. They've got an extra 10 years to get over it. They'll be fine.\n\nWe must go to Mars. I'm not done with this statement yet. I want to keep drilling down, okay? Because when I'm told I must do something I inspect that something a little bit more closely. What is it I must do. Why must I do it? Why must I do it and who might I ask is dishing out the must in the first place? Well, in this case, my friends, the man dishing out the must for Mars is none other than Musk. That's right. You heard me, Elon Musk. Entrepreneur born in 1971, founder of PayPal, Tesla, and other nonsensical words that would make our grandparents roll in their graves.\n\nBut it's most ambitious plan ever has been the creation of the company SpaceX. SpaceX made history in 2012, when it became the first private company to send cargo to the International Space Station. I understand the cargo included seven crates of original flavoured Pringles, the first three seasons of Masterchef on DVD and much to the relief of the astronauts stationed there, the Wi-Fi password.\n\nAnyway, SpaceX got a bit cocky after that first interplanetary home delivery service because now Elon Musk plans to put a human colony on Mars in just six years. That's right. Six years. Humans, Mars. It was an inappropriate use of fingers. I failed my Auslan auditions, so ....\n\nSo let's get this straight. Okay. A private company is planning, as Charlie said, to call dibs on Mars. That means there is no rules here. This is uncharted territory. The private company is going to claim ownership of Mars. That means Elon Musk will become the self-appointed CEO of Mars. Although it would surprise to nobody if after a brief cooling off period, he updated his title to Lord of Mars or perhaps Glorious Supreme leader of Mars. And at that point did any of us put our hands up and say, \"Oh, sorry, Mr. Musk, sir, I beg your pardon. Just thought maybe Mars might belong to all of us.\" He would simply laugh and say, \"Well then dickhead, build your own bloody rocket ship. P.S., I killed Mufasa.\"\n\nThe fact is you can't argue with a man who is worth over $20 billion. Well, you could, but he would probably destroy you with one of his flamethrowers. Now that sounds like a joke, except for the fact that Elon Musk recently sold 20,000 flamethrowers on his website just for fun against the advice of all safety experts. This is completely true. And that is the man you want in charge of a foreign plant. Of course, I shouldn't be too harsh on Elon Musk. I mean, after all he did recently instal the world's largest battery in South Australia, so he's had experience in bringing new technology to empty lifeless barren lands. Am I right?\n\nWhy don't we send all of Adelaide to Mars? Who's with me? Let's do it. Interesting. Interesting response. Let's see what just happened then. I mean, clearly I was joking. I've got relatives in South Australia. I visit oft, and yet interstate rivalry is alive and well here in this country. We delight on hanging shit on each other across state borders. In fact, the history of human experience tells us that distance plus people will equal conflict. And can you imagine what an Earth-Mars rivalry would look like? I mean, they're football fans would probably be super obnoxious and pronounce a handful of words slightly differently like 'castle' instead of 'castle. I constantly bitch about how we stole the spaceship Grand-Prix from them even that was 20 years ago and they should just get over it.\n\nSee what no one seems to be asking is who is the, we, in the statement that we must go to Mars? It's not you. It's not me. It's not anyone on this stage. Not even Elon Musk is volunteering. And you know why? Because it's a one-way trip. You're not coming back from Mars. But has that stopped anyone from volunteering? No, it hasn't because right now hundreds of people are on a short list waiting to see if that will be part of the first colony going to Mars. And they're all from different backgrounds, different races, different genders, but it's safe to assume that one thing unites them all and that is that they must have done some seriously disturbing shit here on Earth if their best option is getting off the planet. I would've loved to see the sea of applicants the day they opened the office doors. Just a whole crowd of middle-aged men in trench coats going, \"One-way ticket off the planet? Sign me up, yeah. Oh, yes, will there be animals on board?\"\n\nDon't groan. When your argument is weak insert a beastiality reference. So I learned that from Cory Bernardi. And even these volunteers aren't evil, okay. Let's just assume even if they do truly believe that they're helping humanity evolve through their sacrifice, it wouldn't stop the rivalry occurring and we know how it would start, don't we?\n\n\"Mars to Earth, we are out of fresh milk.\"\n\n\"Earth to Mars, copy that. Did you look in the second fridge?\"\n\n\"We're storing Gary's body in the second fridge. He died on arrival.\"\n\n\"Sorry to hear that. What about the soy milk?\"\n\n\"The soy milk is what killed Gary.\"\n\n\"Righty-oh. We'll send fresh milk. That will take 300 days and cost $230 billion dollars. Over and out.\"\n\nAnd we'll all be sitting right back here on Earth, going, \"We could probably spend that money on hospitals and public transport and slowly the seeds of discontent will be sown my friends before the people on Mars start to be viewed by the rest of us as somehow different, a different race, if you will. Almost, dare I say, less than human. And when you dehumanise someone, you make it easier for people to ignore their suffering. So suddenly when someone says let's invade them and take over the planet, we'll all be like, \"Yeah, damn straight. Let's invade Mars.\" Only one problem though, the people on Mars will have flamethrowers.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we must not go to Mars. We must stay here. We must get along and we must clean up our mess. In the words of David Attenborough, \"Earth forever.\" Thank you."
