        "text": "SOUNDTRACK: ELEKTRA-“I Don’t Do Boys” (2009).\n\nI found out about this band and video because of my recent reading of the Icelandic magazine Séð og Heyrt and this post on I Love Icelandic Music.\n\nThis song was listed as one of Iceland’s musical scandals because of the aggressively lesbian imagery.\n\nThe song is simple enough. Piano chords play slowly until the tone changes for the bridge and the very simple chorus (which reminds me of Blur’s Boys and Girls in a way, although it doesn’t sound anything like them): “I don’t do Boys, I just do Girls, I just do girls with style and class. I don’t do boys I just do girls I just do girls with kissable ass”). It’s poppy but a little more aggressive than a typical pop song (and not as metal as a pop metal song). There’s an interesting style to the backing vocals that seems to make it more than a pop song as well. I’m not saying it’s good, but it’s more than typical.\n\nAs for the video, I can’t tell if this is male fantasy lesbianism or what, but since this story is all about kissing, here’s a video that’s all about kissing. See if it’s as scandalous as Iceland thinks.\n\n[READ: May 16, 2013] “Leaning In”\n\nThe five brief pieces in this week’s New Yorker are labeled as “Imagined Inventions.” And in each one, the author is tasked with inventing something.\n\nMindy Kaling is always funny, especially when you’re not sure how serious she is. As when she begins her essay, “One of the perks of my job is that I regularly get to kiss men—often married men—with zero repercussions for anyone involved.” Of course she’s talking about acting, but as she says—who is to know if she slips out of character while kissing?\n\nShe explains that kissing new people is one of the great joys in life and, while being in a committed relationship is also wonderful, she feels that removing the joy of kissing new people is a terrible drag. She agrees that marriage is a serious business but kissing is not. “Kissing in and of itself can’t create offspring or cause life-threatening disease.” She offers an example of how if you just kissed someone you would never be stuck having to listen to his post-coital ramblings afterwards.

I loved the orchestral pop that Neil Hannon seemed to effortlessly create. His last few records have been less exciting to me. He has toned down the orchestration and made his songs more subtle. They’re still beautiful but they’re not always as immediately arresting. I thought that was true of this album as well, although I found that when I sat down and really listen to the music and words together (what a novel idea) the music played so well with the lyrics that the album overall is easily one of his best. Although I still prefer the pomp and full orchestration of the earlier music, this newer stuff is very interesting. An artist has got to grow, right?\n\nThe new sound is more Tin Pan Alley. It’s piano with guitars and occasional horns–very limited strings are present at all. And, as any fan knows, Neil writes wonderful songs about love, and the songs on here are some more great love songs. The non-love songs span the gamut of ideas–from emotionally wrenching to downright silly. Neil is definitely a “get to know him” kind of songwriter. And it’s rewarding when you do.\n\n“Down in the Street Below” is a piano based song that morphs into a jaunty little number after some quiet verses. It features yet another of his great melodies. “The Complete Banker” is a jaunty piano song that mercilessly mocks the banking industry. Not terribly original but certainly fun and lyrically it’s quite clever. “Neapolitan Girl” is a faster song (reminds me of a Broadway musical or movie instrumental) which is (as they all are) very fun to sing along to). “Bang Goes the Knighthood” is a musical hall song that is really quite funny despite the somber sound of the music (it’s about a knighted man who indulges in certain proclivities that might cost him what he has).\n\n“The Indie Disco” is the exact opposite, it’s bouncy and shuffly and yet understated as only an indie disco can be (this may be the softest, least excited “yea!” in any song ever. Name checking Morrissey may not be original but it would be a less real picture without him. The songs he mentions are kind of dated, but are probably pretty accurate to what gets played in an indie disco these days. “Have You Ever Been in Love” could be used in any rom-com film montage. Although maybe it’s too obvious? Sweetly filled with strings (yes strings).\n\n“Assume the Perpendicular” is a slightly faster song, as befits lyrics, “I can’t abide a horizontal life while “The Lost Art of Conversation” is another bouncy tune with a whistle for an ending!\n\n“Island Life” is one of the first duets I can think of from the Divine Comedy–it sounds like something out of the movie Brazil. “When a Man Cries” is an emotionally wrenching song. It seems somewhat out of place for Hannon’s usual topic, but it’s quite beautiful. The silly fun of “Can You Stand Up on One Leg” is the perfect antidote. Each verse provides something that’s harder to do than you think. The final verse offers, “can you hold a singing note for a stupidly long time…. Let’s see how long you can hoooooooooo….oooold on to a note.” For the record, Neil’s note is 29 seconds long….stupidly long! Is that really him holding that high note for 29 seconds?\n\nThe final song “I Like” is a wonderful poppy ditty, in which the full band rocks out (more or less) to another great melody. It’s a perfect love song (even modernized to include a kind of rhyme with sexy and texting).\n\nInitially I was a little disappointed by this disc, but it really proved to be fantastic. More, Neil, more!\n\n[READ: December 28, 2011] Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?\n\nIs Mindy Kaling a big enough celebrity to write a book (memoir or otherwise?). To use her own in-book comparison, she’s nowhere near Tina Fey’s level of fame, right? (although I actually think she is funnier). I mean, she’s a minor character on a popular show. True, she’s also a writer and producer, but that’s not going to lead you to fame or anything. The more I read about her in the book, the more I wondered exactly who would know her aside from fans of The Office.\n\nNone of that is to say that Kaling isn’t awesome. She is. She’s funny and talented and I am thrilled she wrote a book–sometimes within an ensemble your individual voice will get lost. But I have to wonder how much name recognition she has. And the book doesn’t do a lot to dispel this sense for me. I mean, she tells about everything she’s done, and really all she had done was write Matt & Ben (which sounds awesome and which I remember hearing about back in the day) and work (a lot) for The Office. Not minor accomplishments by any stretch, but not a fame-inducing resume. Nevertheless, good for her that someone was interested in letting her write a book. And good for us who read it. If you are amused by the use of the subtitle of the book (which I am) you will like enjoy the humor here.\n\nI had read some excerpts from the book so I assumed it was all funny essays and whatnot, but it’s not. It’s actually a memoir with funny essays mixed in. Of course, Mindy’s life before Matt & Ben isn’t really very “interesting” (the book is very funny during this time of her life, even if she really didn’t do much more than babysit for rich folks and watch Comedy Central).\n\nIn the Introduction, Mindy provides a FAQ about the book. One of the questions is if she is going to offer advice and she says yes. And here’s the thing, Mindy’s advice is outstanding. She offers advice about many topics and I don’t think I disagreed with her about anything (except maybe pea coats). She’s like the voice of reason in a world gone mad and an excellent role model for anyone.

(I’ve always been confused why Paul and Ace both look like they are not wearing the white makeup in these photos). I must have listened to this 4 sided LP a thousand times as a kid (my poor mother–what did she do while I monopolized the only stereo in the house and made her listen to Paul Stanley rambling on and on?\n\n“Detroit Rock City” and “King of the Night Time World” open the concert just like they open Destroyer. But unlike on Destroyer, the next songs keep up the fast pace with “Ladies Room” and “Makin’ Love.” All four of these songs are a bit faster, a bit louder a but more intense than the album versions (especially the Destroyer tracks, which have all of the bombast removed). This first side ends with an energy-packed “Love Gun.” I mean, holy cow, what an opening, it’s all nonstop heavy rock. Even though I like, nay, love the originals, these version have so much energy, so much presence (they would have it even without the crazed fans screaming–which is practically like static it is so continuous) that they blow away the studio versions.\n\n“Calling Dr. Love” is a much faster tempo (with a wonderful intro about “rock and roll pneumonia”) and “Christine Sixteen” loses the piano (which I admit I liked, but it works great without it), and it’s far creepier here. “Shock Me” picks up some rock from the studio version, but more importantly, it picks up a crazy guitar solo (which is yes, much better seen than heard). “Hard Luck Woman” to me sounds funny in this setting. Don’t get me wrong, I love it, but it’s hard to imagine them playing it amidst all the chaos of the rest of the show. And then “Tomorrow and Tonight” is fine in this context, but you can kind of feel the fans wishing for “Rock and Roll All Nite.”\n\nSide three opens with “I Stole Your Love” which rocks equally as hard live. It’s followed by “Beth” perhaps the strangest thing on a live album. From what I’ve seen, Peter comes down from behind the drums, sits in the front of the stage and sings his mega-hit to piped-in piano music. I guess it was something of a break for the rest of the band. It’s followed by a truly intense version of “God of Thunder”–faster and heavier than the original and very cool. The only surprise is that it contains a drum solo–the solo is not the surprise (it is the 70s after all), the surprise is that “God of Thunder” is so obviously Gene’s song, it seems odd that they would break it up with a drum solo (although if memory serves, he uses the time to clean off all the blood from his face and guitar). “I Want You” sounds really great in this version (the guitars are wicked) and it gives Paul a chance to show some vocal acrobatics.\n\nThe LP version featured this awesome gatefold inner photo which I have to say may have really set the bar high for other bands in terms of concert awesomeness. My vinyl copy has pencil lines etched into the cardboard from the number of times I traced the picture. (Thanks to Porcelain Theology, a blog I am enjoying very much, for this picture). The live portion of the show ends with “Shout It out Loud” which works as a very solid anthem to end the concert.\n\nThe fourth side of the LP always confused me. When I was young and didn’t really understand how to read credits, I assumed that whoever’s name was after the song was the person who sang it (generally true, but not always). So, when side four featured covers and songs written by people not in the band, it blew my mind. I also didn’t understand why there were five non-live, indeed, brand new songs on this live album (they didn’t want to release any songs that were also on Alive!–perhaps the last time they didn’t reissue music). I respect this decision, but at the same time, how much cooler would this concert be with “100,000 Years” or “Deuce” included?\n\nThe five songs actually aren’t bad, but they don’t really have all that much excitement to them. “All American Man” is a surprisingly gritty song from Paul and “Larger Than Life” is pretty interesting musically (and I just realized that love means penis in this song too and that it’s actually a pretty funny brag song). “Rocket Ride” is probably the best song on this side. Ace didn’t contribute to any of the other songs on this side, but he goes out with a blaze! The chorus is a little cheesy but the verses are really cool, and the solo rocks.\n\nHow I miss the excess of the 70s.\n\n[READ: October 1, 2011] “Flick Chicks”\n\nMindy Kaling is a writer for and actor on The Office. She is very funny. I’m not sure if she has written for the New Yorker before, but I like her and wanted to include her here (just to get some of her magic mojo to appear on my blog). This piece is labelled an “L.A. Postcard” and it is more or less broken into two parts.\n\nThe introduction shows Mindy sitting down to pitch a new movie. She claims that all TV writers want to write for movies because “At the Oscars, the most famous person there is, like, Angelina Jolie. At the Emmys the huge, exciting celebrity is Bethenny Frankel.” [I actually don’t even know if Bethenny Frankel is a real person, so I guess that proves the point]. Although this year there has been a lot of chatter about the movies stars who are now on TV shows–see the New Yorker event Bravura Television. William H. Macy and Jeremy Irons may not be Angelina Jolie, but they’re still pretty awesome.\n\nAnyhow, the joke of her movie pitch is that she wants to write a romantic comedy, but the studio is now focusing solely on making movies based on board games (see the existence of Battleship: The Movie). Pretty darn funny. (more…)\n\nRead Full Post »"
