        "text": "Why am I becoming Catholic?\n\n“I’m from Assembly of God. I grew up in a church, always in and out. I met a few people going to UCA. When they said they were Catholic it kind of blew my mind. You hear all these things about Catholics and it’s not so good, ever. … They asked me one day if I ever considered becoming Catholic. I was like ‘No that’s never going to happen’ … (Catholic Campus Ministry Director and Deacon) Richard Papini, he opened up his door to me any time I needed him … It was just that first meeting at RCIA that confirmed I was going to do this. I’m still constantly praying if this is the right thing and I truly feel like it is for me.”\n\nAbbigail Gonzales, candidate\n\nSt. Joseph Church, Conway\n\n“A few weeks after moving to the Little Rock area, my husband (a cradle Catholic) asked if we could enroll our daughter into pre-K in a Catholic school, and I thought it was a great idea. We had been looking for a church home for a few years; I was raised Presbyterian and he Catholic. And we were not finding that feeling of home anywhere we attended — that is until I came to Our Lady of the Holy Souls in Little Rock for a tour of the campus. Not even five minutes into my tour, I just knew it was home. We enrolled our daughter, my husband and I joined RCIA and before I had even attended the first meeting I knew that I would become Catholic. I knew I was on the right path.”\n\nSamantha Minster, candidate\n\nOur Lady of the Holy Souls Church, Little Rock\n\n“My family has been active in churches pretty much our whole life. But as I’ve gotten older and began to reflect on things, I began to want to know how Christianity as we practice it has evolved. What was the history, how did we form our beliefs and why are some of our traditions different even though our core beliefs as Christians are the same? My wife was born into a Catholic family, practiced Catholicism for many years … This is my third year to take RCIA classes. It looked like RCIA could answer many of my questions and after attending the classes I have decided I want the Church and its history to be part of me as I worship and live each day.”\n\nDr. Ron Kaler, candidate\n\nSt. Mary Church, Hot Springs\n\n“My wife and I have been married 35 years in June. She’s always been Catholic and I’ve attended her church. When I met my wife, we went to her church; our kids are Catholic. I retired in 2014. I just had a calling that I needed to step up to the plate to be part of a bigger and better picture to have a closer relationship with Jesus and the Lord. (God) is expecting more from me. He’s kept me alive through some bad times, he has protected me. … I can’t answer ‘Why now’ — it’s just one of those things, he spoke to me … You could have knocked my wife over with a feather when I told her.”\n\nAlfred “Al” Moore, candidate\n\nSt. Peter the Fisherman Church, Mountain Home\n\n“I grew up in a Christian family and never doubted the importance of my relationship with Christ. When I started dating my husband, one attraction I had to him was his devotion to God and his Church. During Lent of 2017, I started to feel God’s tug at my heart and began praying about becoming Catholic. For the next several months, I prayed about my decision to join the Church and talked with my husband and he was obviously supportive and excited. I’ve enjoyed furthering my faith journey and learning more about the Catholic Church through RCIA and I’m truly excited to fully celebrate Easter Vigil with my family.”\n\nRebecca Gaffigan, candidate\n\nSt. Stephen Church, Bentonville\n\n“I became a Christian in college, but I saw the sheer number of denominations, and it bothered me. I eventually became an ordained Protestant pastor, but this never stopped bothering me. I pastored churches in two other denominations, and each one had its own unique doctrines. It made no sense, so I finally decided to study the early Church. I told myself, ‘whoever the early Christians were, that’s who I’m going to be.’ I found that the early Church believed in the Real Presence, in apostolic succession, in the primacy of the Church in Rome, in Mary as the New Eve, and so much more. My first time at Mass was Palm Sunday of 2017, and I knew I was where I belong.”"
