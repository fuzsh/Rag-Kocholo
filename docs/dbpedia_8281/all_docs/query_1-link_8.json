        "text": "Where are you from?\n\nI grew up in good ol’ Schaumburg, Illinois…aka the town with the huge IKEA.\n\nWhat is one thing about yourself that you want everyone to know?\n\nI once “opened up” for Billy Joel at a private birthday party performance…the guest of honor was a famed billionaire that I will not disclose for legal purposes (:\n\nA link to something about you (website, video, post, etc.)\n\nhttps://www.christianlmoreno.com\n\nWhat are you up to these days?\n\nLiving my best bohemian life as a freelance percussionist in Chicago!\n\nWhen did you intern with TCP?\n\nI worked with Third Coast during my freshman year at DePaul University, sometime in the middle of 2013.\n\nHow did you connect with TCP?\n\nI remember seeing a post on the TCP socials, announcing that applications had opened up for their annual internship program—I took a shot in the dark and decided to send an application, not expecting a response…the rest as they say, is history.\n\nDid you gain anything from the internship that you’d like to share?\n\nOne thing that always stuck out for me was their meticulous and detailed execution of tasks behind the scenes. The amount of planning and organization that goes into literally EVERYTHING that they do was very inspiring and changed the way that I think about being an artist. On top of that, watching them perform live was a masterclass in musicianship.\n\nWhat else did you do while you were interning?\n\n… my main focus was arriving to my group piano classes on time haha\n\nDid you leave a legacy or mark on the organization that you’re particularly proud of?\n\nI like to think so! My favorite contribution was creating the first iteration of TCP’s official Wikipedia page. It was more of an involved project than I originally anticipated, requiring some basic level of coding and in-depth research about the group’s history, but I really enjoyed the process. Peter was gracious enough to grant me a “one- on-one exclusive interview”, which gave me some great insight. I am very happy with how the page turned out.\n\nFavorite memory?\n\nGetting to drive a rented U-Haul box truck home from Notre Dame University, all the way back to Chicago by myself….it was my first time taking the I-90 back from Indiana into the city. As soon as I arrived in Chicago, I remember seeing the iconic Morton Salt Factory (now the Salt Shed) and the sun began to set…being stuck in traffic never felt so good.\n\nA GIF or YouTube link that sums up your experience with TCP?\n\n(I’m David Spade in this clip…)\n\nIf you were a cartoon character, who would you be?\n\nMy girlfriend Rebecca says Yosemite Sam…let’s go with that lol\n\nA funny or embarrassing story from the internship?\n\nOK, so it’s Day 1, and my very first assignment was to take Sean to the post office. At that time, I was listening to Radiohead’s, In Rainbows, pretty religiously, and I remember Sean and I conversing right away about how great that record was…not even a minute after driving us off, I made a wrong turn down a one way and literally saw my life flash before my eyes. There wasn’t a turn off for a few blocks and I felt so bad because the post office was literally 2 minutes away and it took 10 minutes to get there.\n\nOur interns can experience every part of TCP’s organization, from visiting recording sessions to writing grants and everything in between. We accept interns almost year-round. If you’re interesting in learning more about an internship with Third Coast, please contact Sean Connors at [email protected].\n\nPROGRAM\n\n7:00pm: Opening act by SRBCC’s La Cantera\n\n7:30pm: Música Poética by Carlos Carrillo\n\n(Chicago premiere)\n\n“Four Walls”\n\n“Como si fuera la primavera”\n\n“Dueling with Time”\n\nThird Coast Percussion (Sean Connors, Robert Dillon, Peter Martin, David Skidmore)\n\nFeaturing\n\nJuan Horie, Cello; Zachary Good and Katherine Jimoh, Clarinets\n\nPresented by Third Coast Percussion and the Segundo Ruiz Belvis Cultural Center.\n\nThe longest-standing Latino cultural center in Chicago, SRBCC was established in 1971 and named in honor of Segundo Ruiz Belvis, a Puerto Rican patriot and member of a secret abolitionist society that freed slave children under Spanish rule.

He has taught composition at DePauw University, Reed College, and the Conservatory of Music in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In the Spring of 2013 Dr. Carrillo was appointed Assistant Professor of Composition-Theory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nPROGRAM NOTES\n\nFour Walls, Como si fuera la primavera, and Dueling with time, bartering for minutes of existence are part of an evolving cycle of works by Carlos Carrillo, featuring percussion percussion instruments in different combinations and contexts, each of which is inspired by a poem.\n\nFour Walls for percussion quartet\n\nPaul Rochberg wrote his poem “My room has four walls” at age 16. Four years later, he was dead. From the first time I read this poem many years ago, it spoke to me, though I could not quite figure out why. It was not until after I completed this piece that I began to comprehend it. Like that song by the Cuban songwriter Silvio Rodriguez that says, “The most terrible things, we learn immediately. But the beautiful ones, take a lifetime.” By engaging with this poem through my composition process, I understood its depiction of both the profound and mundane. The contemplation of life by a teenager that, while quite mature, still shows his age. And this short poem, in inspiring this piece, remains a memorial and celebration of the beautiful things in life.\n\nFour Walls was commissioned by Chamber Music America’s Classical Commissioning Program, with generous funding provided by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and written for Third Coast Percussion. In memoriam Jim Primosch.\n\nPaul Rochberg escribió su poema “My room has four walls” (Mi habitación tiene cuatro paredes) a los 16 años. Cuatro años después, muere. Desde la primera vez que leí este poema hace muchos años, me llamó la atención, aunque no podía entender por qué. No fue hasta que terminé esta pieza que comencé a comprenderla. Como aquella canción del compositor cubano Silvio Rodríguez que dice: “Lo más terrible se aprende enseguida y lo hermoso nos cuesta la vida”. Al trabajar con este poema a través de mi proceso de composición, entendí su descripción tanto de lo profundo como de lo mundano. La contemplación de la vida por parte de un adolescente que, si bien es bastante maduro, todavía deja ver su edad. Y este breve poema, al inspirar esta pieza, sigue siendo un memorial y una celebración de las cosas bellas de la vida. Four Walls fue un encargo del Classical Commissioning Program de Chamber Music America, con una generosa financiación proporcionada por la Fundación Andrew W. Mellon, y escrito para Third Coast Percussion. En memoria de James Primosch.\n\nMy room has four walls\n\nMy room has four walls,\n\nlike a babycarriage\n\nlike a coffin\n\nMy room has four walls,\n\nand a closet with\n\nsliding doors that\n\nopen and close\n\nlike an elevator\n\nLast night a man stepped out\n\nof the closet and\n\nsaid\n\nsorrywrongfloor\n\ngot in and shut the door\n\nI hope he finds it,\n\nbecause I can still\n\nhear the elevator.\n\nPaul Rochberg (1944-1964)\n\nUsed with kind permission of the Rochberg Family\n\nDuration: 14 minutes\n\nComo si fuera la primavera for clarinet, bass clarinet, cello, and percussion\n\nThe title of Como si fuera la primavera (“As if it were spring”) is taken from the Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén’s poem “Canción.” The verse speaks of expectations that perhaps are not fulfilled.

For nearly 20 years, the ensemble has created exciting and unexpected performances that constantly redefine the classical music experience and “push percussion in new directions, blurring musical boundaries and beguiling new listeners” (NPR), with a brilliantly varied sonic palette and “dazzling rhythmic workouts” (Pitchfork). In its latest GRAMMY® nomination, TCP’s 2023 album Between Breaths has been nominated under Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance in the 2024 GRAMMY® Awards.\n\nThe ensemble has been praised for the “rare power” (Washington Post) of more than 30 recordings and “an inspirational sense of fun and curiosity” (Minnesota Star-Tribune). Bringing their uniquely compelling programs worldwide, Third Coast Percussion maintains a busy tour schedule, with past performances in 40 of the 50 states and Washington, D.C., plus international tour dates across four continents. Celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2025, the ensemble is embarking on the most ambitious collaborative projects of their career, with some of the world’s leading musicians, choreographers, and composers from around the world.\n\nA direct connection with the audience is at the core of all of Third Coast Percussion’s work, whether the musicians are speaking from the stage about a new piece of music, inviting the audience to play along in a concert or educational performance, or uniting fans around the world via one of their free mobile apps. The four members of Third Coast are also accomplished teachers, and make active participation by all students the cornerstone of all their educational offerings, including thoughtfully curated K-12 workshops and family programming.\n\nThe quartet’s curiosity and eclectic taste have led to a series of unlikely collaborations that have produced exciting new art. Their omnivorous musical appetite, paired with approachable and flexible working methods, remove collaborative boundaries across cultures and disciplines. The ensemble has worked with engineers at the University of Notre Dame, architects at the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, dancers at Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, and musicians from traditions ranging from the mbira music of Zimbabwe’s Shona people, to indie rockers and footwork producers, to some of the world’s leading concert musicians. Third Coast Percussion served as ensemble-in-residence at the University of Notre Dame’s DeBartolo Performing Arts Center from 2013-2018, and currently serves as ensemble-in-residence at Denison University.\n\nA commission for a new work from composer Augusta Read Thomas in 2012 led to the realization that commissioning new musical works can be – and should be – as collaborative as any other artistic partnership. Through extensive workshopping and close contact with composers, Third Coast Percussion has commissioned and premiered new works by Philip Glass, Missy Mazzoli, Jlin, Danny Elfman, Clarice Assad, Gemma Peacocke, Flutronix, Tyondai Braxton, Augusta Read Thomas, Devonté Hynes, Georg Friedrich Haas, Donnacha Dennehy, Glenn Kotche, Christopher Cerrone, and David T. Little, plus many of today’s leading up-and-coming composers through their Currents Creative Partnership program. TCP’s commissioned works have become part of the ensemble’s core repertoire and seen hundreds of performances around the world. In 2023, Jlin’s Perspective, commissioned by TCP, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nThird Coast Percussion’s recordings include 17 feature albums, and appearances on 14 additional releases. Besides putting its stamp on iconic percussion works by John Cage and Steve Reich, the quartet has created first recordings of commissioned works by Philip Glass, Augusta Read Thomas, Devonté Hynes, Gavin Bryars, Danny Elfman, Donnacha Dennehy, David T. Little, Ted Hearne, and more – in addition to recordings of original Third Coast compositions. In 2017 the ensemble won the GRAMMY® Award for Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance for their recording of Steve Reich’s works for percussion. Third Coast has since received four additional GRAMMY® nominations as performers, and in 2021 they received their first GRAMMY® nomination as composers.\n\nThird Coast Percussion has always maintained strong ties to the vibrant artistic community in their hometown of Chicago. They have collaborated with Chicago institutions including Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, the Uniting Voices Chicago choir, the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, Chicago Humanities Festival, and the Adler Planetarium. TCP performed at the grand opening of Maggie Daley Children’s Park; conducted residencies at the University of Chicago and the Civic Orchestra of Chicago; created multi-year collaborative projects with Chicago-based composers Jessie Montgomery, Clarice and Sérgio Assad, Augusta Read Thomas, Glenn Kotche, and chamber ensemble Eighth Blackbird; and has taught tens of thousands of students through partnerships with Uniting Voices Chicago, The People’s Music School, the Chicago Park District, Rush Hour Concerts, Urban Gateways, Changing Worlds, and others.\n\nThe four members of Third Coast Percussion (Sean Connors, Robert Dillon, Peter Martin, and David Skidmore) met while studying percussion music at Northwestern University with Michael Burritt and James Ross, and formed the ensemble in 2005. Settling in Chicago, the four friends have carefully and thoughtfully built a thriving nonprofit organization – including full-time staff, office/studio space, and a board of directors – to support their vision and facilitate their efforts to bring new works to life. Members of Third Coast also hold degrees from the Eastman School of Music, Rutgers University, the New England Conservatory, and the Yale School of Music.\n\nStay up-to-date and go behind-the-scenes by following Third Coast on Instagram (@ThirdCoastPercussion), YouTube (@thirdcoastpercussion), TikTok (@thirdcoastpercussion), Twitter (@ThirdCoastPerc), Facebook (@Third Coast Percussion) and LinkedIn (linkedin.com/company/third-coast-percussion)\n\n*Third Coast Percussion is a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization.\n\nJuan Horie is a Venezuelan/American cellist who was trained in Venezuela’s acclaimed SISTEMA, studying Cello in the Academia Latinoamericana de Violoncello with Maestros Leandro Bandres and William Molina Cestari.

The vision for this project was to create a 30 minute percussion quartet in 4 movements, with each of the movements representing 100 years in history of the iconic company.\n\nAfter a ceremonial introduction, the first movement, Alchemy (1623), begins with a solo marimba line representing Avedis Zildjian, the founder and first to make cymbals for the Sultan in 1618. A second marimba voice joins, played in pseudo counterpoint and representing the son, Ahkam, the first to succeed Avedis and share in the secret process. Thus the story begins! The movement reflects the baroque period with its polyphonic texture and driving dance-like climax. The title Alchemy refers to the genesis (coming together of the company) and the medieval reference to the chemistry of mixing metals to create gold.\n\nMovement 2, Campana – (Bells) (1723), represents the classical period with its pseudo rondo form. The movement also introduces the amadinda pipe rack, employed throughout the piece, as a nod to the sounds of church bells that were made by Zildjian in their early history. The rudimental drumming that characterizes the movement, played both on metal and membraned sounds, represents Zildjian’s role in making instruments for the Janissary music (Turkish Military music) of the period.\n\nHomage, movement 3 (1823), reflects on the romantic period incorporating the Turkish folk song, Agla garip agla (Weep, Sad One, Weep), which is vocally rendered by the ensemble. A haunting and contemplative movement, it slowly builds to one distinct climax, a characteristic of many works from this period in music history.\n\nThe final movement, Revolutions (1923), represents the last 100 years, where the evolution of Jazz, Popular and Contemporary Classical music shared a symbiotic relationship with the development and influence of Zildjian Cymbals on these genres. The movement reflects these styles using a gritty and driving rhythmic language and modal melodic platform reminiscent of Bebop, Boulez, Bartok and Zappa.\n\n*A special thanks to Zildjian for giving me the opportunity to write this work for this monumental occasion. I can’t think of another company that has consistently led with innovation and excellence while always putting artistry at the forefront of their mission. Congratulations! Here’s to the next 400 years!!!\n\n**Additional thanks to Third Coast Percussion for taking on this project. Working with you on this piece has been one of the most rewarding and meaningful experiences of my career. When your students become your heroes, you know you’re doing something right. — MJB, October, 2023\n\nDuration: 40 minutes.\n\n—\n\nHaving performed in four continents and more than forty states, Michael Burritt is one of his generation’s most accomplished percussionists. He is in frequent demand performing concert tours and master classes throughout the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and Canada. Mr. Burritt has been soloist with the United States Air Force Band, Dallas Wind Symphony, Omaha Symphony, Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra, Nexus, The Paris Percussion Group (France), The Amadinda Percussion Group (Hungary), Third Coast Percussion, Ju Percussion Group (Taiwan), Percussion Art Quartet (Germany) and the Amores Percussion Group (Spain).

It was written for the quartet to perform on one single 4.3 octave marimba. I have been friends with the members of Third Coast for many years and have watched them from afar with much admiration. It brings me great joy to write music for them.\n\nThere are moments in life that create a feeling I can’t quite describe. Like waking up in a sunlight room, or sharing a meal with old friends, or going on a road trip with someone you love. There’s a jovial, euphoric feeling to it. I feel it when I catch the sunrise with my family, and I feel it when I play music too. Maybe it is gratitude, or peace, or something in between. Whatever this feeling is, it is at the heart of Watercolor Sun.” – Ivan Trevino, Nov. 2023\n\nDuration: 5 minutes.\n\n—\n\nIvan Trevino is a Mexican-American composer, percussionist, teacher and arts advocate. Recognized around the world for his contributions to percussion literature, Ivan’s music has been performed on five continents in over 25 countries. He is a multi-award winning recipient of the Percussive Arts Society’s International Composition Contest and has over 80 compositions and songs to his name. His newly commissioned works include an etude book for The Juilliard School, a wind band piece for The Eastman Wind Ensemble, and a marimba quartet for the Grammy Award winning group, Third Coast Percussion. In 2020, Ivan was the featured composer on NPR’s Performance Today. Ivan currently serves as Assistant Professor of Practice at University of Texas at Austin, where he teaches a studio of undergraduate and graduate percussion majors. He is an artist and clinician for Innovative Percussion, Black Swamp Percussion, Zildjian Cymbals, Evans Drumheads, Pearl / Adams, and Meinl Percussion.\n\nIvan is also known for his work as a drummer with Break of Reality, an international touring cello rock quartet. As a member of the ensemble, Ivan was selected as a music ambassador by the U.S. State Department during the Obama administration. Break of Reality has released five studio albums and has been featured on PBS, Huffington Post, Yahoo Music and is on regular rotation on National Public Radio.\n\nIvan’s work spans various media including storytelling, poetry, and film scoring. His collection of online writings are regularly circulated throughout the arts community, including “My Pretend Music School”, a blog post that has sparked debate about music school curriculum and has become required reading for collegiate courses around the U.S.\n\nIvan currently lives in Austin, TX with his wife, Amanda, and their children, Henry and Oscar.\n\nA math lover, a former steel factory worker and a proud resident of Gary Indiana, Jlin (Jerrilynn Patton) has risen to become one of the most distinctive composers in America and one of the most influential women in electronic music. Jlin’s introduction to producing music stems from Chicago footwork, but diverse influences ranging from Igor Stravinsky and Philip Glass to Miles Davis and Eartha Kitt give Jlin’s complex percussion-driven work a sophisticated polyrhythmic sound all its own.\n\nJlin’s thrilling, emotional, and multidimensional works have earned her a rank as “one of the most forward-thinking contemporary composers in any genre” (Pitchfork). Her signature sound builds on a Chicago footwork style, expanded and warped into a frequency that is solely hers. Jlin was a 2023 Pulitzer Prize nominee for Perspective – originally commissioned and performed by Third Coast Percussion. Her albums Dark Energy (2015) and Black Origami (2017) received critical acclaim and have been featured “best of” in The New York Times, The Wire, LA Times, Rolling Stone, The Guardian, and Vogue. Referencing a wide range of musical movements and techniques, Jlin’s collaborations with contemporary artists are just as relevant to her practice exemplified by “JSLOIPNIE,” the product of JLin and the late, iconic SOPHIE. Additional collaborators include William Basinski, Dope Saint Jude, Holly Herndon, and Zora Jones. Jlin has since remixed works for major artists including Björk, Max Richter, Martin Gore (of Depeche Mode), Galya Bisengalieva, Marie Davidson, Nina Kraviz, Ben Frost, and others. Inspired by movement, Jlin has also collaborated with legendary choreographers: Wayne McGregor (2017), and Kyle Abraham (2021).\n\nHer seven-movement work Perspective was written for Third Coast Percussion through a highly collaborative process. After exploring and sampling instruments from TCP’s vast collection of percussion sounds at their studio in Chicago, she created an electronic version of each of the work’s seven movements using these samples and other sounds from her own library.\n\nThe members of Third Coast Percussion then set about determining how to realize these pieces in live performance. Diving into each of the audio tracks, the percussionists found dozens of sonic layers, patterns that never seem to repeat when one would expect them to, and outrageous sounds that are hard to imagine recreating acoustically. Even typical percussion sounds like snare drum, hi-hat, or kick drum exist in multiple variations, subtle timbral shades in counterpoint or composite sounds.\n\nIn pursuit of the broad expressive range of Jlin’s original tracks, TCP’s live version of this piece incorporates mixing bowls filled with water, bird calls, and a variety of gongs and tambourines, as well as many variations of drum set-like sounds: instruments that are like a hi-hat but not a hi-hat, or serve the function of a snare drum but are not a snare drum.\n\nJlin named her piece Perspective as a reference to this unique collaborative process, that this work would exist in two forms, the same music as interpreted through different artists and their modes of expression.\n\nIn addition to concert performances, Third Coast Percussion will feature the full 7-movement Perspective in its Carnegie Hall debut in January 2023, as part of a collaboration with Movement Art Is. That project features choreography by MAI founders Lil Buck and Jon Boogz, and new music by Tyondai Braxton in addition to Jlin’s work and TCP’s arrangements of music by Philip Glass.\n\nPerspective by Jlin was commissioned for Third Coast Percussion by the Boulanger Initiative, the Maxine and Stuart Frankel Foundation, Carnegie Hall, the Lester & Hope Abelson Fund for the Performing Arts at the Chicago Community Foundation, the DEW Foundation, and Third Coast Percussion’s New Works Fund.\n\nPerspective was named a Finalist for the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for music.\n\nDuration: 30 minutes.\n\nPerspective is featured on Third Coast Percussion’s GRAMMY®-nominated album Perspectives.

Glass has written music for experimental theater and for Academy Award-winning motion pictures such as The Hours and Martin Scorsese’s Kundun, while Koyaanisqatsi, his initial filmic landscape with Godfrey Reggio and the Philip Glass Ensemble, may be the most radical and influential mating of sound and vision since Fantasia. His associations, personal and professional, with leading rock, pop, and world music artists date back to the 1960s, including the beginning of his collaborative relationship with artist Robert Wilson. Indeed, Glass is the first composer to win a wide, multi-generational audience in the opera house, the concert hall, the dance world, in film, and in popular music – simultaneously.\n\nHe was born in 1937 and grew up in Baltimore. He studied at the University of Chicago, the Juilliard School and in Aspen with Darius Milhaud. Finding himself dissatisfied with much of what then passed for modern music, he moved to Europe, where he studied with the legendary pedagogue Nadia Boulanger (who also taught Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson, and Quincy Jones) and worked closely with the sitar virtuoso and composer Ravi Shankar. He returned to New York in 1967 and formed the Philip Glass Ensemble – seven musicians playing keyboards and a variety of woodwinds, amplified and fed through a mixer.\n\nThe new musical style that Glass was evolving was eventually dubbed “minimalism.” Glass himself never liked the term and preferred to speak of himself as a composer of “music with repetitive structures.” Much of his early work was based on the extended reiteration of brief, elegant melodic fragments that wove in and out of an aural tapestry. Or, to put it another way, it immersed a listener in a sort of sonic weather that twists, turns, surrounds, develops.\n\nThere has been nothing “minimalist” about his output. In the past 25 years, Glass has composed more than twenty-five operas, large and small; twelve symphonies; thirteen concertos; soundtracks to films ranging from new scores for the stylized classics of Jean Cocteau to Errol Morris’s documentary about former defense secretary Robert McNamara; nine string quartets; and a growing body of work for solo piano and organ. He has collaborated with Paul Simon, Linda Ronstadt, Yo-Yo Ma, and Doris Lessing, among many others. He presents lectures, workshops, and solo keyboard performances around the world, and continues to appear regularly with the Philip Glass Ensemble.\n\nPROGRAM NOTES\n\nThe repetitive structures and meditative harmonies of Glass’s music have allowed it to exist in many versions for different musical instruments. Selections from his piano etudes and the solo piano piece Metamorphosiswere arranged in the late 1990’s for a project with Brazilian musical group Uakti. This version, for Uakti’s unique gamut of custom-made instruments, was part of a project called Aguas da Amazonia, in which all of the movements (except for Metamorphosis No. 1) were renamed after the Amazon River and its tributaries.\n\nLong-time fans of Glass’s work, and hoping to someday commission the iconic composer for his first percussion ensemble piece, the members of Third Coast Percussion arranged a handful of these pieces for their multi-media project Paddle to the Sea in 2016. Drawing on both the Uakti arrangement and the original piano music, TCP reimagined these works using mallet percussion instruments and other unique instrumental colors such as melodica, desk bells, and almglocken (tuned Swiss cowbells). In 2020, TCP made their own arrangements of the rest of the Aguas da Amazonia, including Metamorphosis, to round out the collection, premiering the full cycle at the Philharmonie de Paris in 2021.\n\nGlass celebrated his 85th birthday in 2022 with a series of online concerts “Philip Glass: Three Cities,” with prominent artists performing Glass’s work in the three cities that formed his musical identity: Chicago, New York, and Baltimore. The Chicago portion of the series featured TCP performing movements from Aguas da Amazonia in Mandel Hall at the University of Chicago, where Glass attended many concerts as a student.\n\nThird Coast Percussion’s recording of Metamorphosis No. 1 appears on their album “Perspectives,” released in May 2022 on Cedille Records, alongside music by Danny Elfman, Jlin, and Flutronix.\n\nIn the midst of the arranging of Aguas da Amazonia, Third Coast Percussion also realized their goal of commissioning Glass for his first percussion ensemble piece. Although percussion instruments have played an important role in much of Philip Glass’s music, and a number of his works have been arranged for percussion by other musicians, Perpetulum was the first work Glass composed specifically for an ensemble of only percussion instruments. Glass, who was 81 years old when he composed this work, harkened back to childhood memories of his first experience with percussion. Though Glass’s primary musical instrument was the flute, he had the opportunity to participate in a percussion class while a student at the Preparatory Division of the Peabody Conservatory in his hometown of Baltimore. Perpetulum blends a bright-eyed exploration of the sounds of percussion with Glass’s signature musical voice.\n\nThe work is in three sections, with a cadenza between the second and third section. Glass proposes some general concepts and instruments for the cadenza, but leaves it to the performers to compose this segment of the music themselves.\n\nThird Coast Percussion premiered Perpetulum as part of a double bill that featured Glass performing his piano works, as part of the Chicago Humanities Festival in 2018, and released the debut recording of Perpetulum on Orange Mountain Music in 2019, on an album by the same name. This album also included works by members of the ensemble and new music by Gavin Bryars, and was nominated for a GRAMMY award in the “Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance.”\n\nPerpetulum by Philip Glass was commissioned for Third Coast Percussion with lead support from the Maxine and Stuart Frankel Foundation. The work was co-commissioned by Elizabeth and Justus Schlichting for Segerstrom Center for the Arts, Bravo! Vail Music Festival, San Francisco Performances, Town Hall Seattle, Performance Santa Fe, the University of Notre Dame’s DeBartolo Performing Arts Center, and the Third Coast Percussion New Works Fund, with additional support from Friedrich Burian, Bruce Oltman, MiTO Settembre Musica, The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra’s Liquid Music Series, and the Percussive Arts Society.\n\nABOUT THE ENSEMBLE\n\nThird Coast Percussion is a GRAMMY® Award-winning Chicago-based percussion quartet and GRAMMY®-nominated composer collective. For over fifteen years, the ensemble has created exciting and unexpected performances that constantly redefine the classical music experience. The ensemble has been praised for “commandingly elegant” (New York Times) performances, the “rare power” (Washington Post) of their recordings, and “an inspirational sense of fun and curiosity” (Minnesota Star-Tribune). Third Coast Percussion maintains a busy tour schedule, with past performances in 38 of the 50 states and Washington, DC, plus international tour dates across 4 continents.\n\nA direct connection with the audience is at the core of all of Third Coast Percussion’s work, whether the musicians are speaking from the stage about a new piece of music, inviting the audience to play along in a concert or educational performance, or inviting their fans around the world to create new music using one of their free mobile apps. The four members of Third Coast are also accomplished teachers, and make active participation by all students the cornerstone of all their educational offerings.\n\nThe quartet’s curiosity and eclectic taste have led to a series of unlikely collaborations that have produced exciting new art. The ensemble has worked with engineers at the University of Notre Dame, architects at the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, dancers at Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, and musicians from traditions ranging from the mbira music of Zimbabwe’s Shona people, to indie rockers and footwork producers, to some of the world’s leading concert musicians. Third Coast Percussion served as ensemble-in-residence at the University of Notre Dame’s DeBartolo Performing Arts Center from 2013—2018, and currently serves as ensemble-in-residence at Denison University.\n\nA commission for a new work from composer Augusta Read Thomas in 2012 led to the realization that commissioning new musical works can be—and should be—as collaborative as any other artistic partnership. Through extensive workshopping and close contact with composers, Third Coast Percussion has commissioned and premiered new works by Philip Glass, Missy Mazzoli, Gemma Peacocke, Flutronix, Jlin, Tyondai Braxton, Augusta Read Thomas, Devonté Hynes, Georg Friedrich Haas, Donnacha Dennehy, Glenn Kotche, Christopher Cerrone, David T. Little, Danny Elfman, and today’s leading up-and-coming composers through their Currents Creative Partnership program. TCP’s commissioned works have become part of the ensemble’s core repertoire and seen hundreds of performances across four continents.\n\nThird Coast Percussion’s recordings include fourteen feature albums, and appearances on fourteen additional releases. The quartet has put its stamp on iconic percussion works by John Cage and Steve Reich, and Third Coast has also created first recordings of commissioned works by Philip Glass, Danny Elfman, Augusta Read Thomas, Devonté Hynes, Gavin Bryars, Donnacha Dennehy, David T. Little, Ted Hearne, and more, in addition to recordings of the ensemble’s own compositions. In 2017 the ensemble won the GRAMMY® Award for Best Chamber Music/Small Ensemble Performance for their recording of Steve Reich’s works for percussion. Third Coast has since received 3 additional GRAMMY® nominations as performers, and in 2021 they received their first GRAMMY® nomination as composers.\n\nThird Coast Percussion has always maintained strong ties to the vibrant artistic community in their hometown of Chicago. They have collaborated with Chicago institutions such as Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, the Chicago Children’s Choir, the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, Chicago Humanities Festival, and the Adler Planetarium. TCP performed at the grand opening of Maggie Daley Children’s Park, conducted residencies at the University of Chicago and the Civic Orchestra of Chicago, created multi-year collaborative projects with Chicago-based composers Augusta Read Thomas, Glenn Kotche, and chamber ensemble Eighth Blackbird, and taught tens of thousands of students through partnerships with The People’s Music School, the Chicago Park District, Rush Hour Concerts, Urban Gateways, and others.\n\nThe four members of Third Coast Percussion (Sean Connors, Robert Dillon, Peter Martin, and David Skidmore) met while studying percussion music at Northwestern University with Michael Burritt and James Ross. Members of Third Coast also hold degrees from the Eastman School of Music, Rutgers University, the New England Conservatory, and the Yale School of Music.

We will be collaborating with Ellis, Vanderveer and Maunders to create new works to be premiered by Third Coast next season. Read more about these outstanding music-makers below and click their names to hear some of their music.\n\nWe received a remarkable 182 applications this year! It is so inspiring to see the creative and amazing work displayed by all of the proposals, and we know that our field will continue to be made better by the work of these composers! Thank you to everyone who submitted music and ideas this year.\n\nApplications for the Currents Creative Partnership are reviewed each fall. Applications are now open are due on October 31. Click here for more information about applying to the Partnership.\n\nBrian Ellis is a composer, web-based creative, and multi-instrumentalist. His musical drive lies in using code to realize his larger compositional vision, that: technology should be used toward divesting musical agency from the composer to the environment, the performer, and ultimately, the listener.\n\nHe believes strongly in the value of collaboration, and at times fills the various roles of composer, technologist, presenter, videographer, performer, or publicist while working with chamber musicians, videographers, conceptual artists, and dancers. In addition to a solo performance practice spanning classical guitar, live electronics, and no-input-mixing, Brian plays with saxophonist Jonathan Hostottle in the physically distanced new music group SANS; duo and performs with the Brooklyn-Based Echo Ensemble. Brian completed his undergraduate studies in Music (Classical Guitar) and Computer Science Honors at the University of Texas at Austin where he studied with Nina Young, Celil Refik Kaya, and Russell Pinkston. He has most recently studied with David Coll. As a composer, Brian focuses on writing chamber music, and has worked with Unheard-of Ensemble, Apply Triangle, the Subaerial Collective, the Playground Ensemble, and members of zFestival and SōSI, as well as has presented works at TURN UP, 21st Century Guitar Conference, ICMC, SEAMUS, NYCEMF, and ROCC.\n\nAs a professional software engineer, Brian has worked for Meta on Assistant and Spark AR Player as well as for Amazon on Audible.com. He additionally spent time in Dr. Howard Ochman’s Microbial Evolution Lab, where he was co author of a paper in the Journal Bioinformatics which discusses classifying prokaryotic species based on gene flow.\n\nClick here to see more of Ellis’ music.\n\nA Fromm Foundation Composer Fellow and an alum of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra EarShot New Music Readings, Sakari Dixon Vanderveer seeks to incorporate the unique artistry of her collaborators in each of her compositions. Her latest premieres include works for the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber Orchestra, Derek Bermel, HOCKET, the Portland Youth Philharmonic, and the Irving M. Klein International String Competition.\n\nHer desire to empower youth also remains a catalyst behind much of her work. A Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra Composer Teaching Artist Fellow, she founded the You(th) Can Compose! Summer Workshop, a personalized, online intensive program for beginners.\n\nVanderveer’s aim is that children from all walks of life will gain access to contemporary music and composition, allowing them to develop a better appreciation and understanding of concert music – new and old – so that they, too, can cherish it and engage with it throughout their entire lives.\n\nClick here to listen to see more of Vanderveer’s music.\n\nFlorence Anna Maunders started to compose music when she was a teenager, and her early tape-based pieces from this time reveal an early fascination with the unusual juxtapositions of sounds and collisions of styles which have been a hallmark of her music-making ever since. This is perhaps a reflection of the music which interested and excited her from a very young age – medieval dance music, prog-rock, electronic minimalism, bebop jazz, Eastern folk music, the music of Stravinsky & Messiaen, and the grand orchestral tradition of the European concert hall. Florence started out as a chorister, clarinettist and saxophone player, but following an undergraduate degree at the Royal Northern College of Music, where she studied with Anthony Gilbert, Adam Gorb, Simon Holt & Clark Rundell, she enjoyed a mixed and international career as a jazz pianist, orchestral percussionist, electronic music producer, conductor and teacher. After a long break of many years during which she didn’t compose at all due to her poor mental health, she returned to composition, transformed her life, changed her gender, and began to get enormously busy. Composition is now taking up more and more of her time. Over the last couple of years she has met with tremendous success despite her disabilities & had her music extensively performed across the UK, Europe and the USA, and received a significant number of awards, prizes and commissions. A full list of recent prizes and awards is available on her website.\n\nPROGRAM\n\nMatters/Mind by Alexis C.

Ditson Fund at Columbia University.\n\nThird Coast Percussion acknowledges support from the Illinois Arts Council Agency.\n\nPROGRAM NOTES\n\nAlexis C. Lamb (b. 1993) is a composer, percussionist, and educator whose work seeks to cultivate a connectedness to natural, historical, and societal relationships. Her recent\n\ncommissions and collaborations include Third Coast Percussion, Albany (NY) Symphony, Aizuri\n\nQuartet, Opera Omaha, Contemporaneous, and Vera Quartet. She is currently pursuing a Doctorate of Musical Arts at the University of Michigan and has previously earned degrees from the Yale School of Music and Northern Illinois University. Lamb’s compositions can be found on Innova Recordings, National Sawdust Tracks, and Evan Chapman’s self-published record, Caustics. Her works are self-published and available at https://alexislamb.com/ .\n\n“Do you ever feel like your mind overthinks and gets in the way of what truly matters?\n\n…Yes, I do too.”\n\n– Alexis C. Lamb\n\nNyokabi Kariũki (b. 1998) is a Kenyan composer based between Nairobi and New York. Illuminated by musical sensibilities from her African upbringing and training in Western classical contexts, Nyokabi shares a unique and affecting artistic voice spanning across various genres — from experimental & classical contemporary to sound art and explorations into (East) African musical traditions. Her debut EP, ‘peace places: kenyan memories’ (SA Recordings) was marked as one of Bandcamp’s Best Albums of Winter 2022 and The Guardian’s ‘Contemporary Album of the Month’, with additional praise from Resident Advisor, Pitchfork, and more. Her other works have been experienced in various contexts around the world, from audio art festivals — including the Hearsay International Audio Festival and the LUCIA Festival in Italy — to performances by award-winning ensembles like Brooklyn Youth Chorus Men’s Ensemble and Third Coast Percussion. Additionally, she has received commissions from Heartland Marimba, Arcis Saxophon Quartet, and more. Nyokabi’s sonic imagination is ever-evolving, reflecting a love for experimentation, inquiry, as well as a commitment to the preservation of African thought, language and stories.\n\n“I never hesitate to look for guidance and inspiration for my pieces in home, Kenya. My ethnic group, the Kikuyu, are farmers, and seasons are based on planting and harvest. The season of ‘big rain’ is known as Mbura ya Njahi, which refers to the rain that comes that allows the beans to grow (usually from April to July). When writing the piece, I found myself thinking of the sound of the tapping of rain on the roof of our home in Kirinyaga, where my father and his sisters grew up. It is one of my most favourite, most peaceful places to be.”\n\n–Nyokabi Kariũki\n\nKite aka Suzanne Kite is an Oglála Lakȟóta performance artist, visual artist, and composer raised in Southern California, with a BFA from CalArts in music composition, an MFA from Bard College’s Milton Avery Graduate School, and is a PhD candidate at Concordia University. Kite’s scholarship and practice highlights contemporary Lakota epistemologies through research-creation, computational media, and performance. Recently, Kite has been developing a body interface for movement performances, carbon fibre sculptures, immersive video and sound installations, as well as co-running the experimental electronic imprint, Unheard Records. For the inaugural 2019 Toronto Art Biennial, Kite, with Althea Thauberger, produced an installation, Call to Arms, which features audio and video recordings of their rehearsals with Her Majesty’s Canadian Ship (HMCS) York, which also consisted of a live performance with the conch shell sextet, who played the four musical scores composed by Kite. Kite has also published in several journals and magazines, including in The Journal of Design and Science (MIT Press), where the award winning article, “Making Kin with Machines,” co-authored with Jason Lewis, Noelani Arista, and Archer Pechawis, was featured. Currently, she is a 2019 Pierre Elliott Trudeau Foundation Scholar, a 2020 Tulsa Artist Fellow, and a 2020 Women at Sundance x Adobe Fellow.\n\n“Using Lakota women’s geometries in a design methodology developed by Sadie Red Wing, Kite collaborated with the members of Third Coast Percussion to allow each performer to tell a separate story through the designs. The four performers will follow separate pathways on the visual score, meeting in the center with singer Santee Witt, singing his own composition simultaneously. This performance explores Native American Church music, Lakota ways of creating new knowledge, and experimental composition practices.”\n\n– Kite\n\nArmenian-born, Los Angeles-raised pianist and composer Tigran Hamasyan is one of the 21st century’s true slipstream musicians. His work crosses boundaries between jazz, crossover classical, electronic, Baroque dance, vocal, and Armenian folk musics atop electronic backdrops and hip-hop beats. Hamasyan was born in 1987 in Gyumri, Armenia. He began playing the family’s piano at three and was enrolled in music school at six. His jazz tastes early on were informed by Miles Davis’s fusion period, and then around the age of 10 his family moved to Yerevan and he came to discover the classic jazz songbook under the aegis of his teacher Vahag Hayrapetyan. Tigran found himself part of the festivities at the Yerevan Second International Jazz Festival in 2000 and, when he was 16, his family immigrated to Los Angeles. Tigran stayed in high school for two months before gaining entrance to the University of Southern California, which he attended for two years. As a teen, he would go on just a few years later to win a number of contests including the 2003 Montreux Jazz Festival and the grand prize at the prestigious 2006 Thelonious Monk Jazz Piano Competition.\n\nEtude No. 1 was composed as a solo piano work and is from Tigran’s album An Ancient Observer,\n\nreleased March 2017 on Nonesuch records, featuring compositions written over the previous four years. Some pieces including Etude no. 1 were through-composed, while others offered less-formal frameworks, leaving space for improvisation. Well known as a jazz pianist, Tigran has also become increasingly regarded as a composer in his eight albums recorded as the sole leader. “I have been composing since I was 9 and composing is a huge part of my daily life and all the records I did from World Passion to An Ancient Observer,” he says. “For me creating a beautiful melody is very important and is the basis, but what you will do with that melody, considering the age of folk music creation is over, is the most important task.”\n\nAyanna Woods is a Grammy-nominated performer, composer and bandleader from Chicago. Her music explores the spaces between acoustic and electronic, traditional and esoteric, wildly improvisational and mathematically rigorous. A collaborator across genres and forms, her work spans new music, theater, film scoring, arranging, songwriting, and improvisation. She earned her B.A. in music from Yale University.\n\nWoods has been commissioned by Third Coast Percussion, Chanticleer, The Crossing, the Percussive Arts Society, Manual Cinema, Lorelei ensemble, the Chicago Children’s Choir, Boston Children’s Choir, and Chicago Chamber Choir.\n\nIn 2018, she originated her role as a vocalist in Place,a new oratorio about gentrification and displacement co-conceived by Pulitzer finalist Ted Hearne, director Patricia McGregor and poet/librettist Saul Williams.\n\nHer music appears in a range of film and theater projects. Two of her songs are featured in the Emmy-nominated web series Brown Girls. In 2017, she and her sister Jamila Woods co-composed the score for No Blue Memories: The Life of Gwendolyn Brooks, a live film created by writers Eve Ewing, Nate Marshall, and Emmy-winning performance collective Manual Cinema. She continues to tour the U.S. and Canada with Manual Cinemaas a bassist and music director.\n\nAs a gigging musician, she is a sought-after bassist and improvisor. She toured the west coast and performed at Pitchfork Music Festival in 2019 as bassist for TASHA. She’s currently recording a debut album with her own band, Yadda Yadda.\n\nWoods is a recipient of Third Coast Percussion’s 2017 Currents Creative Partnership, a 2017 3Arts Make A Wave grant, and a 2020 DCASE Individual Artist Program grant.\n\n“I was inspired by the way drumline tom melodies scramble from place to place, the way kids play together on a playground. Like the best hand-clapping games, there’s a feeling of being chaotic and very coordinated at the same time. The patterns grow and grow until they get too unwieldy; they burst and have to become something else!”\n\n– Ayanna Woods\n\nHailing from Portland, Oregon, multi-instrumentalist Machado Mijiga spins his creative web across denizens of genres, idioms, and formats to forge diverse soundscapes that encapsulate his core artistic identity. With an ever-changing vision chasing creative horizons, Mijiga seeks to bond mind to the ears with every sonic endeavor.\n\nPROGRAM\n\nBulldog by Andrea Venet\n\n…hence the term, well adjusted. by Robert Dillon\n\nNarratology by Hunter Ewen\n\nthe season of Big rain (Mbura ya Njahĩ) by Nyokabi Kariũki\n\nR.I.N. by Andys Skordis\n\nThird Coast Percussion’s “Currents” is made possible by the generous support of Sidney K.

Ditson Fund at Columbia University.\n\nPROGRAM NOTES\n\nDr. Andrea Venet is a percussion artist, educator, and composer specializing in contemporary and classical genres. She is Associate Professor of Percussion at the University of North Florida where she directs the UNF percussion ensemble, teaches applied lessons, pedagogy, methods and percussion literature. As an international soloist, chamber musician, and clinician, she maintains an active performance schedule with appointments in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Trinidad. Andrea’s compositions and arrangements can be found self-published via her website, through Keyboard Percussion Publications (KPP), and Tapspace, in addition to articles published with Percussive Notes and Rhythm!Scene Journals. Andrea is an artist for Malletech, Black Swamp Percussion, Remo, and DREAM Cymbals. She currently serves as the Percussive Arts Society Florida Chapter President and on the Board of Directors for The Green Vibes Project.\n\n“My beloved English bulldog, Shosti, is no stranger to drums and percussion. She has been surrounded by these sounds her whole life. She lays under the marimba while I practice and refuses to be far from sight when I’m playing drums at home. Added bonus: most of the things she does are rhythmic with some level of consistency. For example, Shosti drinks water in combinations of 7/8 and 9/8, which is represented at letter B. She witnesses a lot of creativity that happens at home and much of it is a direct result of interacting with her in idle moments because I am a huge dork. Consequently, one hilarious and interesting thing about her is that she loves paradiddles. Whether it be drumset, or a multi-setup, or tapping a groove on nearby objects, it instantly sets her off into a boisterous “play mode” frenzy, even from a dead-sleep. She also gets very fired up when hearing Steve Reich’s “Clapping Music”!\n\n“Bulldog” is inspired by Shosti and our jam time. The content of the piece is based on paradiddles in various forms, and includes rhythmic grooves and patterns that represent things I associate with the bulldog “freestyle”. Within paradiddle groupings of different lengths, there are variations of voicing, sticking, and patterns. One versatile thing about paradiddle language are the funky grooves that emerge when extracting one voice/hand, especially when juxtaposing over a contrasting but steady pulse. Like an English bulldog, the piece is intended to be fun, sturdy, thick, short and sweet!”\n\n–Andrea Venet\n\nThird Coast Percussion member Robert Dillon has enjoyed a career as an orchestral, solo and chamber musician, as well as an educator for all ages, and since college, has pursued music composition as an additional expressive avenue. His music appears on TCP’s just-released Archetypes album as well as the Grammy-nominated 2019 release Perpetulum, and his music has been performed by university percussion ensembles across the country and overseas.\n\n“I find the hardest part of writing a new piece is getting started. I began this piece in 2017 with a sound I wanted to explore — a rapid movement between many different instruments and objects, all with the same pitch. I liked the idea that one note would come through clearly, even while the timbres were changing too quickly for the listener’s ear to hold on to any one sound.\n\nThe hardest part is getting started, and once I had an initial sonic idea — a single note made of many colors — I could begin building on that one note to form harmonies, and with each new step, more and more possibilities opened up.\n\nI do find the hardest part of writing a new piece is getting started, but sometimes, even once I feel sure about where to begin, I can be paralyzed by the options of where to go next. The second step is when I actually have to decide what the piece is “about,” or whether there’s even really a piece there at all.\n\nI find the hardest part of writing a new piece is getting started, but often the part that excites me the most is a big-picture idea about the form or structure of a piece. I really like it when a book or movie or a tv show organizes its story in a clever way. Part of the eternal charm of “Groundhog Day,” for instance, is the way its imaginative premise speaks to the mundane challenges of our everyday lives. Many of our journeys unfold not in heroic arcs with inevitable ends, but in familiar cycles we have to repeat, again and again, until we figure out how to escape them, or at least until how we get them to lead where we want to go.”\n\n–Robert Dillon\n\nHunter Ewen is a dramatic composer and educator. During the day, Dr. Ewen designs systems for artificially intelligent creativity. At night, he masks up and fights crime with loud noises and strange ideas. His work rails against the waning borders of science and art—meaning and meaninglessness. Ewen values clamor and deviance. Clarity and frenzy. Space. Yowls and yips and screams that masquerade as music. He’s worked some of the same jobs and won some of the same awards as other composers too.\n\n“For percussion quartet and pre-recorded narrator, Narratology is a reflection on ambiguity and lack of autonomy in our public discourse. We Americans are slowly becoming more divided, more political, and more contentious. Society is forcing us into lockstep. We’re having to choose sides—and we keep getting quieter…and angrier. It’s hard to disagree peacefully anymore. So how can we have a real conversation if we just repeat talking points? How can we find our own voice in the 21st century, and how can we reclaim the strength to speak up? Narratology is what happens when we discover our patterns and start pushing back against the systems that deny our autonomy.”\n\n–Hunter Ewen\n\nNyokabi Kariũki (b. 1998, she/her) is a Kenyan composer and performer based between New York, Maryland and Nairobi. Her sonic imagination is ever-evolving, with compositions ranging from classical contemporary to choral music, film, experimental pop; and further includes explorations into sound art, electronics, and (East) African musical traditions. She is dedicated to using composition as a tool to not only re-discover the stories of her culture, but also to highlight its significance, and contribute to the preservation of African and Black stories.\n\nNyokabi’s works have been performed across the United States and internationally, and she has been commissioned by various performers and ensembles including Tetractys New Music, the Heartland Marimba Quartet, piano duo Chromic, and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus Men’s Ensemble. Most recently, she was the recipient of the 2021 Hearsay ‘Art’ Award, which celebrated her piece ‘A Walk Through My Cũcũ’s Farm’ as “audio that transports, transforms, evokes, immerses, transports”.\n\n“I never hesitate to look for guidance and inspiration for my pieces in home, Kenya. My ethnic group, the Kikuyu, are farmers, and seasons are based on planting and harvest. The season of ‘big rain’ is known as Mbura ya Njahi, which refers to the rain that comes that allows the beans to grow (usually from April to July). When writing the piece, I found myself thinking of the sound of the tapping of rain on the roof of our home in Kirinyaga, where my father and his sisters grew up. It is one of my most favourite, most peaceful places to be.”\n\n–Nyokabi Kariũki\n\nAndys Skordis (Cyprus, b. 1983) is a composer of contemporary music, with special emphasis on large scale works, music theatre and site specific pieces. His music is often characterized as archaic and dark, resulting in performances which are frequently compared with rituals or ceremonial occurrences. His work list includes operas, orchestral and chamber pieces, Gamelan music, vocal works, as well as music for dance, theatre and short films. In addition, he has created various music theatre performances in site specific locations like quarries, temples, abandoned buildings, forests, floating stages, and more. Recently he was awarded with the Black Pencil Prize in 2020. Besides composing, he is an artistic collaborator with the Greek National opera, the music curator of Xarkis festival and the guitarist of Monsieur Doumani, a multi awarded trio from Cyprus.\n\n“’R.I.N’ is inspired by a process where one goes into a deeper state of existence…an introverted state, going deeper into their own body and soul. The piece is divided into two movements, where the first one resembles the journey of going deeper in yourself and the second reflects the state when someone has arrived that state; in other words the two movements could be called as descent and exploration. The piece finishes when the whole process has finished, returning back into an altered state of mind and ultimately, existence.\n\nThe four percussionists represent a single entity broken into four pieces, where absolute harmony in all aspects should function in order for the collective “ego” to go through the entire process. The bass drum represents our mind, the nucleus of ourself which is broken in other pieces, and so on.\n\nLastly, as a personal note for the piece, I tried to engage percussion instruments found in various cultures around the world, thus reflecting my personal journey as a composer, expressing timbre and patterns from the various cultures I have studied as a musician, to arrive at the present time. The piece is dedicated to Third Coast Percussion, and our entire journey in creating this piece from the very beginning.”\n\n–Andys Skordis\n\nThird Coast Percussion’s programs are supported by The MacArthur Funds for Arts and Culture at Prince Charitable Trust, The Illinois Arts Council Agency, the City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, the Aaron Copland Fund for Music, the Amphion Foundation, the Gaylord and Dorothy Donnelley Foundation, and the Alice M.

Robinson in celebration of the 100th anniversary of Taliesin, the studio and residence of American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Of Common Patterns, the composer David Skidmore writes:\n\n“In writing this piece, I drew inspiration from the following Wright quotation:\n\n‘…striving for entity, oneness in diversity, depth in design, repose in the final expression of the whole – all these are there in common pattern between architect and musician.’\n\nThe piece is comprised of six movements and an interlude performed without pauses between the movements. Each movement draws its title from one of the key words from Wright’s quote: entity, diversity, design, and repose.\n\nWhen I was asked to write this piece, I quickly realized that I was not interested in writing music ‘about’ a piece of architecture. Even if the notion had interested me, I have no idea how one could accomplish such a thing. Instead, this is a piece inspired by architecture, and, more specifically, the work of one of the great creative minds of the last century, Frank Lloyd Wright. I am an amateur aficionado of architecture, not an expert, so I approached the project as such. When I look at a Frank Lloyd Wright building, the characteristic which most fascinates me is the manner in which simple geometric shapes – squares, rectangles, circles, triangles – are layered in such intricate and unpredictable ways to create the deep complexity and beauty of the whole work.\n\nThese simple shapes in complex layers, along with the quotation above, inspired both the title of the piece and the vast majority of the musical material. I have taken some basic building blocks of music –rhythmic groupings of 3, 4, or 6 notes; harmonies with 3, 4, or 6 pitches – and layered these elements in many, many different ways, each layer leading to a new musical idea, a new sound, a new inspiration. Taliesin is unique among Frank Lloyd Wright’s buildings in that he worked on it continuously from 1911 until his death in 1959. The house is therefore not a single, self-contained architectural idea but instead a fluid structure nearly 50 years in the making. Yet somehow Wright managed to create continuity across his decades of work on the building.\n\nAs my good friend, architectural guru, and progenitor of this piece, Sidney K. Robinson once said “Taliesin was always changing, but it was always Taliesin.” I have thus endeavored to capture some aspect of this combination of evolution and continuity. While the piece is a palindrome harmonically, with the end of the piece circling back to exactly where it began, the rigid and repetitious rhythmic nature of the beginning slowly loosens throughout the course of the piece and eventually completely dissolves as the piece draws to a close.\n\nThe materials of the percussion instruments used (glass, wood and metal) are woven throughout the work in much the same way Wright integrated materials to unify his own designs. This represents a striking similarity between percussion and architecture: more so than in any other music, percussion music is defined by the materials used in performance. A piece may call for marimbas and vibraphones, or it may call for radios, electric buzzer and tom toms; whatever palette the composer chooses, his or her work is defined and structurally unified by these materials as an architect’s work is defined and unified by his or her use of limestone, or plaster, or wood.”\n\nHear Common Patterns in Uncommon Time on Third Coast Percussion’s album Unknown Symmetry: click here to listen on Spotify, and click here to purchase the album.\n\nDavid Skidmore is an Ensemble Member and Executive Director of Third Coast Percussion.

Woods’ work has been performed by the Chicago Children’s Choir, ZRL, Fifth House Ensemble, Wet Ink Ensemble, and Longleash Trio, among others. Her music has also appeared in a range of film and theater projects, including the Emmy-nominated web series Brown Girls and an original Manual Cinema play No Blue Memories, based on the life of Gwendolyn Brooks. In 2018, she was a vocalist in the world premiere of PLACE, a new work by Ted Hearne, Saul Williams and Patricia McGregor. She is the bassist for TASHA and Michael Albert Group. Her music explores the spaces between acoustic and electronic, traditional and esoteric, wildly improvisational and mathematically rigorous.\n\n“The Triple Point of a pure substance is the temperature and pressure where it can be a solid, liquid, and gas in equilibrium. That sounds a lot more tranquil than it actually is; you can find videos online of liquid bubbling into gas, rapidly freezing and then exploding and melting into liquid again. In some ways it’s always the same, and in some ways, it never stops moving. It’s something that’s stable on the one hand, and colliding with itself on the other.\n\n“This title came out of one of our workshops together as the piece was taking shape. We talked about the sound world being meditative and groovy at the same time. That’s something that I tried to lean into as I was writing.”\n\n-Ayanna Woods\n\nTriple Point was composed as part of Third Coast Percussion’s 2017-2018 Emerging Composers Partnership, made possible by generous support from Louise K. Smith, with additional support from the Sargent Family Foundation.\n\nDuration: 6 minutes\n\n—-\n\nRobyn Jacob is a pianist, singer, composer and educator who lives and works on the unceded territories of the Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh Nations. She has toured Canada and internationally with her avant-pop project Only A Visitor, who have released three albums to date and are currently collaborating with sound designer Nancy Tam on a multi-media production called “Double Happiness: Detour This Way.” Her recent composition projects explore writing for unusual ensembles, as well as collaborations with visual artists and instrument makers. In early 2020 she celebrated the release of Earth Leaps Up on the label elsewhere music with her duo The Giving Shapes in collaboration with harpist Elisa Thorn. Since 2012 she has been part of the multi-disciplinary arts collective Publik Secrets, currently artists in residence at the Hadden Park Field House with the City of Vancouver. In 2013 she toured Bali with Gamelan Gita Asmara, and has since been co-leading Gamelan Bike Bike. Robyn has received a Bachelor’s degree in Music from the University of British Columbia, and has completed residencies at the Banff Centre for the Arts and Joya AiR in Spain. She has been teaching music and piano privately for over 10 years.\n\n“Much of my experience with percussion music has been the study of Balinese Gamelan, which is traditionally learned by rote. Around the time I started composing Transference and Zoosemiotics, I learned that humpback whales learn their songs by rote as well. Through further research, I was drawn to the beautiful sonograms that, in a poem of images, made visual the syntax of the whales’ songs. These graphs, which show pitch and texture through time, illustrate the clearly delineated and repeated themes of the songs. I wondered what could be shown by delving into the form of a song created by another species. With the growth of human mega-culture, the whales’ transmission of their songs seemed almost like a parallel form of ‘trending.’ I wanted to explore the tension that comes from the struggle to adhere to the form developed by another – and not only that but a collectively composed work of another species. No one knows what purpose the humpback whale song serves, and similarly, the reasons why people feel the need to perform is also a vast and indefinite discussion. I became interested in the performative actions of whales, such as is featured in films like Blackfish and appears from time to time in the news (for example, the case where a mother orca dragged her dead calf around for seventeen days). In the end these questions guided my composition process, in what is perhaps just an elaborate homage. Regardless, I am grateful to work with the beautiful sonograms that were first published in the journal Science by Payne and McVay (September 1971), and to draw inspiration from another emotionally intelligent being, who creates for reasons we can only begin to try and understand. I’d like to thank the members of Third Coast Percussion for inviting me along in this adventure.”\n\n– Robyn Jacob\n\nTransference and Zoosemiotics was composed for Third Coast Percussion’s Emerging Composers Partnership program, with lead support from Louise K.

I myself have always looked for a ‘third way’ of experiencing the world and expressing myself: a creative, alternative perspective to pure tradition. In music this means a fruitful third path – nourished in one way by clearly composed and subtly interpreted music, generally labeled ‘classical,’ and in another way by the working band-oriented, oral or communal way of creating groove music together. These music cultures usually require different strategies for rehearsing, playing and presenting music. But for me they have much more in common than separation-trained minds think, and they clearly are results of the same musical sources and of our need to share music together.\n\n“A group like Third Coast Percussion has an inspiring fresh post-genre and post-‘-ism’ attitude, both mentally and aesthetically: their curiosity, enthusiasm and way of working are important drives, whereas ‘membership’ in a scene, style or defined culture identity is secondary. Like myself, TCP sees the journey of music as an evolutionary process of learning and understanding the world and us — not as a cultural flow fixed by tradition, but also not so indecisive as the multicultural ‘anything goes.’ Their working spirit is based on differentiation, precision and dedication. They cultivate the scientific explorer attitude with a childlike, playful enthusiasm, which we all should preserve and cultivate in ourselves. This is why ‘Third Coast’ as a term inspired me not mainly geographically, community oriented, or as demarcation, but as a mind- and heart-opening attitude towards life, culture, music.\n\n“I tried to bring this positive spirit and its power into the piece to say, ‘Thank you, Third Coast Percussion, for your way of working and enriching the music ocean!’ The music can speak for herself; we are just standing on her coast to listen.”\n\n-Nik Bärtsch\n\nNik Bärtsch’s Third Coast Culture was commissioned by the Third Coast Percussion New Works Fund.\n\nDuration: 13 minutes\n\n—-\n\nWhat would you have paid to see this event?
