        "text": "Date of crime Defendant(s) Crime Location Sentence Time served Legally\n\nexonerated 1971 Richard Phillips Murder Detroit, Michigan Life without parole 45.7 years Yes Richard Phillips was 25 years old when he was imprisoned for a fatal shooting in Detroit in 1971—a case prosecutors now say was \"based entirely\" on false testimony from one witness. He was sentenced to life without parole. He was released in 2017 and exonerated in 2018 after the University of Michigan's innocence project took up his case, declaring him the longest-serving innocent man in the United States.[70] although his record has since been broken.[71]\n\nIn prison Phillips taught himself to paint watercolors. He painted custom greeting cards for other inmates to send to their families, and used the proceeds to buy more art supplies. Phillips painted and saved hundreds of original watercolors, now on display in his gallery. As the gallery describes, \"He painted to stave off the loneliness. He painted to break up the monotony. He painted to fill the long days. He painted to keep his heart soft and hope alive.\"[72]\n\n1972 Anthony Mazza Murder Boston, Massachusetts Life without parole 47.3 years Yes A Massachusetts jury found Mazza guilty of first-degree murder and robbery based on his answers often contradicting his statements to police and to the grand jury due to Mazza having a developmental disability and that he was functionally illiterate and had been in special-education classes for most of his time in school which was not revealed to the jury at his trial. He is now the second-longest-serving innocent man in the United States.[73][74][71][75] 1972 Wilbert Jones Sexual assault Baton Rouge, Louisiana Life in prison 44.7 years Yes A Louisiana jury found Jones guilty of aggravated rape based solely on the victim's testimony. The victim expressed some uncertainty about her identification of Jones in a lineup, e.g., \"[the victim] described her attacker variously as 5 feet 8 inches tall, 5 five feet 9 inches tall, and 6 feet 3 inches tall. She said he had a single gap between his front teeth and a smooth, soft voice. ... [After identifying Jones as the perpetrator] she expressed concern because Jones' voice was \"rougher\" than her attacker's, and because Jones was only 5 feet 3 inches tall ....\" The prosecution did not tell the defense about a serial rapist who had been arrested recently and fit the victim's [in Wilbert Jones' case] description. Louisiana incarcerated Jones for nearly 45 years before Innocence Project New Orleans helped him petition for a new trial. A district judge vacated Jones' conviction and ordered a new trial. The prosecution appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court, but the state's highest court rejected the appeal. The prosecution dismissed the charges on October 11, 2018. Jones' nearly 45 years in prison was the second longest time spent incarcerated after a known wrongful conviction in U.S. history at the time.[76] June 3, 1973 Chol Soo Lee Murder San Francisco, California Life in prison 9.8 years Yes Lee was convicted of the shooting death of Chinatown gang leader Yip Yee Tak and sentenced to life in prison. While behind bars, Lee was also convicted of killing Morrison Needham in a prison yard, which he claimed was self-defence. In 1982 Lee was retried and acquitted of Tak's murder and Lee's death sentence was nullified. He was released on March 28, 1983. He was not given an apology nor compensation from the state. Sep 28, 1973 Peter Reilly Manslaughter Falls Village, Connecticut 6-16 years Two years Yes Barbara Gibbons' mutilated corpse was found by her son Peter Reilly on September 28, 1973. Police quickly made him their prime suspect, based solely on his presence at the scene and what they felt to be an unusual lack of emotion. He was interrogated at length for 24 hours, having voluntarily agreed not to have an attorney present, and eventually confessed to the crime after being subjected to oppressive interrogation tactics. Reilly was ultimately convicted of manslaughter rather than murder. In 1976 he received a new trial; two witnesses, including a state trooper, had seen Reilly driving his car when the murder was believed to have happened, leaving him without enough time to get back home, commit the murder, and dispose of all the evidence before the police arrived. The charges against Reilly were dismissed in November.[77] 1974 Gregory Bright Murder New Orleans, Louisiana Life in prison 27.5 years Yes Bright was convicted of second-degree murder in 1974 at the age of 20.[78] After several years of appeals, Bright was granted a new trial in 2001 on the grounds that the prosecution had withheld evidence from the defense in his previous trial. On June 24, 2003, after 27+1⁄2 years in prison for a crime they did not commit, Bright and Earl Truvia were both released after the Orleans Parish district attorney dismissed all charges.\n\nBright speaks around the country about his wrongful incarceration and life since prison. In 2010, Bright joined Innocence Project New Orleans as Assistant Education and Outreach Director.[79]\n\nFeb 3, 1974 Delbert Tibbs Rape, murder Fort Myers, Florida Death 3 years Yes Teenager Cynthia Nadeau was raped and her boyfriend, Terry Milroy, was murdered by a man who picked them up while hitchhiking. Despite an alibi, Tibbs was convicted on the basis of a false eyewitness identification and an alleged confession to a fellow inmate.[80] In 2011, Tibbs was instrumental in the decision of Governor Pat Quinn to repeal the death penalty in Illinois.[81][82][83] May 15, 1974 Michael Lloyd Self Murder Galveston, Texas Life in prison Life (died in prison) No Teenagers Rhonda Johnson and Sharon Shaw disappeared while at a beach in Galveston, Texas, on August 4, 1971; their remains were found in a marsh in January 1972. Though Michael Lloyd Self, a local sex offender, wrote a confession, he contended that police officers forced him to do so at gunpoint. Self was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1975. In 1976, two of the officers who took his confession were arrested for numerous bank robberies and sentenced to 30–50 years. In 1998, Edward Harold Bell, a convicted serial killer, admitted to the murders of Johnson and Shaw, though no direct connection could be made. Self died in prison in 2000 of cancer. Numerous investigators, a Galveston police officer, and a former Harris County prosecutor all protested Self's conviction.[84] December 30, 1974 Glynn Simmons Murder Edmond, Oklahoma Death, later reduced to Life in prison 48 years Yes Mistaken Witness ID, Perjury or False Accusation, Official Misconduct, and Inadequate Legal Defense caused him to be found guilty. Exonerated in December 2023. He is now the longest-serving innocent man in the United States.[85] Mar 29, 1975 David Bryant Murder Bronx, New York 25 years to life 40 years, 9 months Yes In March 1975 8-year old Karen Smith was found dead in a stairwell of her apartment building. Previously charged twice for sexual misconduct, David Bryant was taken in as a suspect the same day and was convicted to serve 25 years to life a year later in October 1976. Bryant was briefly released in 2013 but was taken back to prison in 2014, until finally being released in 2018 and having his charges dismissed in 2019.[86] Sep 6–\n\nOct 21, 1975 Ledura Watkins Murder Detroit and Highland Park, Michigan Life without parole 41 years, 3 months Yes Ledura Watkins was convicted of the murder of 25-year-old public school teacher, Evette Ingram, who was also a drug dealer, based on testimony by Travis Herndon who gave conflicting stories about who had committed the crime. Herndon initially said Ledura Watkins committed the crime; later adding it was at the request of crooked Highland Park police officer Gary Vazana who was known for dealing drugs, and wanted Herndon and Watkins to kill Ingram and take any drugs they found so the drugs could be sold and the three of them could split the proceeds. Vazana was found murdered the same day Herndon began telling his stories to police. The Cooley Law School Innocence Project at Western Michigan University began investigating the case in 2012. In January 2017, they filed a petition for post-conviction relief citing the undisclosed police and laboratory reports, Herndon's recantation, the failure of the prosecution and police to disclose favorable treatment of Herndon in exchange for his testimony, and unreliable hair analysis. On June 15, 2017 the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office joined in supporting the motion which led to the judge vacating Watkins's conviction and the charges being dismissed due to insufficient evidence for a retrial. Watkins filed a federal civil rights lawsuit that was settled in 2021 for $2,350,000.[87] 1975 Ricky Jackson, Ronnie Bridgeman, and Wiley Bridgeman Murder Cleveland, Ohio Death Varied Yes Jackson and both the Bridgeman brothers were convicted and sentenced to death for the killing of Harold Franks, a money order salesman, based on the evidence of a 12-year-old boy, Eddie Vernon, who claimed to have seen them attack Franks. There were no other witnesses nor evidence linking the accused to the crime. In a signed affidavit in 2014, Vernon recanted, saying he had been coerced by the police. Jackson had escaped the death sentence because of a paperwork error. The sentences of the Bridgemans had been commuted to life. Jackson and Wiley Bridgeman were held in prison longer than any other persons who had been exonerated. Ronnie Bridgeman had been paroled after serving 28 years.[88] All three men received compensation and settlements from the state for their wrongful convictions and imprisonment. May 2, 1976 Clifford Williams Jr. Murder, attempted murder Jacksonville, Florida Death 42 years, 7 months Yes [89] Jul 1976 Charles Ray Finch Murder Wilson, North Carolina Death 42 years, 11 months Yes [90] Jul 1976 Lewis Fogle Rape, murder Indiana County, Pennsylvania Life without parole 34 years Yes Fogle was convicted in 1982 of raping and killing 15-year-old Deann Katherine Long, who had died in 1976. DNA tests on the semen in the girl's body proved he was not the rapist. In August 2015, a senior judge vacated his conviction. The local district attorney joined in the motion to vacate his conviction, and Fogle was released.[91] Nov 27, 1976 Randall Dale Adams Murder Dallas, Texas Death 12 years Yes Adams was convicted of killing Dallas police officer Robert W. Wood. In 1988, the film The Thin Blue Line, which was based on the case, was released. Public outcry over the film prompted officials to re-examine the case. Adams was released in 1989.[92] 1977 Dewey Bozella Murder Poughkeepsie, New York 20 years to life 26 years Yes Bozella was accused of killing 92-year-old Emma Kapser. He was convicted on the basis of testimony from two jailhouse informants. DNA testing was not available because evidence from the crime had been destroyed post-conviction.[93] Bozella's first conviction was overturned because the prosecutor removed all African Americans from the jury. He was tried again in December 1990. At the second trial, one witness recanted his prior statements, but Bozella was convicted a second time. The other witness later recanted. In addition, the defense later learned that the prosecution failed to turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense, including a fingerprint recovered from the scene that was linked to a felon. In 2009, Bozella's conviction was overturned and all charges were dropped.[94] Mar 14, 1977 Brian Baldwin Murder Monroe County, Alabama Death Executed No Naomi Rolin was a white girl of 16 who was raped and murdered. Ed Horsely confessed to the murder, which he said he alone had committed, and was executed. But the police charged Baldwin with the murder based on his confession, which Baldwin said was extracted under beatings and an electric cattle prod. No forensic evidence connected Baldwin with the crime. The murder was committed by a left-handed person whereas Baldwin was right-handed.[95] All evidence was lost or destroyed after the execution. Jul 9, 1977 Gary Dotson Rape* Chicago, Illinois 25–50 years 6 years (approximately) Yes Sixteen-year-old Cathleen Crowell Webb made up a rape allegation to explain her pregnancy concerns to her foster parents after having had consensual sex with her boyfriend the previous day. After a religious conversion, Webb confessed to her pastor that she had wrongly accused Dotson and began efforts to get him released. The prosecution refused to take any action, so they went to the media. The resulting public sympathy led the authorities to review the case. Eventually Dotson was cleared via DNA testing and released. May 11, 1978 The Ford Heights Four: Verneal Jimerson, Dennis Williams, Kenneth Adams, and Willie Rainge Rape, murder Ford Heights, Illinois Death (Jimerson, Williams), 75 years (Adams), life (Rainge) 18 years (Williams, Adams, Rainge), 11 years (Jimerson) Yes The Ford Heights Four were convicted of the rape of Carol Schmal and murder of Schmal and Lawrence Lionberg based on false forensic testimony, coercion of a prosecution witness, perjury by another witness who had an incentive to lie, and prosecution and police misconduct. Witness and DNA evidence uncovered in an investigation by three journalism students at Northwestern University cleared the Ford Heights Four and led to the arrest and conviction of the real killers.[96] May 11, 1978 Paula Gray Rape, murder, perjury Ford Heights, Illinois 50 years 9 years Yes Paula Gray was an additional suspect in the Ford Heights Four case. Gray, an intellectually-disabled teenager, was interrogated for two days before confessing to her involvement in the crime. However, Gray soon recanted her confession, stating that she had been drugged and coached by the police. Upon her recantation, Gray was charged with rape and murder and with perjury. She was ultimately found guilty and sentenced to 50 years in prison. In 1982, after two of the Ford Heights Four won new trials, prosecutors offered to release Gray in exchange for her testimony against the two men. Gray accepted the offer and was released in 1987. Following the exoneration of the Ford Heights Four, Gray's conviction was overturned, and in 2002, the Governor issued her a pardon.[97] Aug 31, 1978 Joseph Sledge Murder Elizabethtown, North Carolina Two consecutive life sentences 36 years Yes Sledge escaped from prison during a four-year sentence for misdemeanor larceny and was recaptured days later. During this time, Josephine and Aileen Davis were killed in their home in Elizabethtown, North Carolina. Sledge was convicted of murdering the two women based on the testimony of two inmates who claimed that Sledge had admitted to the crime while in prison the next year. One of the informants later recanted his testimony, saying that he had lied due to police coercion and a reward of early parole and $3,000 prize money. The other informant received similar special treatment. Mitochondrial DNA testing of hairs found at the crime scene believed to be from the killer did not match Sledge, and he was declared innocent in January 2015. He had served more than 36 years for the crime.[98] Aug 31, 1978 Bobby Joe Maxwell Murder Los Angeles, California Life without parole 39 years Yes Maxwell was falsely believed to be the Skid Row Stabber, and was convicted of two stabbings.[99] Nov 11, 1978 Craig Coley Murder Simi Valley, California Life without parole 39 years Yes Coley was convicted of the murder of 24-year-old Rhonda Wicht and her 4-year-old son Donald Wicht in 1978. DNA tests not available at the time of his trial later showed Coley could not have done the murders, and DNA from others was present. Police officers testified that the original investigating officer had mishandled the investigation. Coley was pardoned in 2017 after serving 39 years.[100] Sep 30, 1979 Kevin Green Second-degree murder, attempted murder, rape Tustin, California 15 years to life 16 years Yes On September 30, 1979, Diane Green, who was nine months pregnant with a girl, was assaulted and raped in her apartment by an assailant who beat her into a coma. She was found by her husband Kevin and taken to hospital where doctors decided to perform a caesarean section, but they were unable to save the unborn girl. Diane came out of her coma a month later and was initially unable to identify her attacker; however, she later claimed to have remembered that Kevin attacked her after being refused sex. Based solely on Diane's testimony, Kevin was convicted of her rape and attempted murder and the second-degree murder of their unborn daughter in spite of witnesses who testified he was at a fast food restaurant during the attack. 16 years later, investigators re-opened the case of the \"Bedroom Basher\" - a serial killer active in California during the 1970s who would break into women's apartments, rape them, and beat them to death with a hammer. DNA testing to try and identify the killer revealed that the DNA profile matched the one taken from Diane Green's rape kit. This profile was later linked to Gerald Parker, who confessed to the attack on Diane Green and the other murders and was sentenced to death in 1999. A judge declared Kevin Green factually innocent in June 1996 and ordered his release.[101] Nov 23, 1979 Cornelius Dupree Aggravated robbery Dallas, Texas 75 years 30 years Yes Dupree was convicted of aggravated robbery on the basis of eyewitness identification after allegedly robbing and raping a 26-year-old woman during a carjacking. He was later exonerated by the Innocence Project via DNA testing of pubic hair from the rape. 1979 Kevin Strickland Triple murder Kansas City, Missouri Life without parole for 50 years[102] 42 years, 4 months Yes[103] Strickland was exonerated for three murders and released in 2021 on November 23. His wrongful incarceration of 42 years and 4 months was the longest in Missouri[104][105][73][102] 1979 Jerry Frank Townsend Murder (six counts) Broward and Miami-Dade County, Florida Multiple life sentences 21 years Yes Townsend, an intellectually disabled man with an IQ of 50, was arrested for rape in 1979 and confessed to a number of murders committed in Broward and Miami-Dade counties. He was convicted or pled guilty to six of the murders he had confessed to and received seven life sentences. While he was in prison, DNA testing showed that at least two of the murders he had confessed to were in fact victims of serial killer Eddie Mosley, casting doubt on the accuracy of his confession. Further testing cleared him of two more of the murders. At the request of prosecutors, Townsend's conviction was vacated and he walked free after 21 years in prison.[106] Date of crime Defendant(s) Crime Location Sentence Time served Legally\n\nexonerated 1980s At least 36 people Child sexual abuse* Kern County, California Varied Varied Some The Kern County child abuse cases are a notable example of day-care sex-abuse hysteria of the 1980s.[107] The cases involved claims that a pedophile sex ring performed Satanic ritual abuse: as many as 60 young children testified they had been abused. At least 36 people were convicted and most of them spent years imprisoned. 34 convictions were overturned on appeal. Two convicts died in prison.[108][109][110] A documentary titled Witch Hunt was produced and released in 2007. MSNBC also did a documentary on John Stoll and the Kern County cases. In 2009, John Stoll sued Kern County and was awarded $5 million in compensation.[111]\n\nPrior to the start of the Kern County child abuse cases, several local social workers had attended a training seminar that foregrounded satanic ritual abuse as a major element in child sexual abuse, and had used the now-debunked memoir Michelle Remembers as training material.[112]\n\n1980s Cathy Woods Murder Reno, Nevada Life without parole 35 years Yes [113] May 6, 1980 Joyce Ann Brown Murder, aggravated robbery Dallas, Texas Life in prison 9 years, 5 months, 24 days Yes Brown was convicted of robbery in 1980,[114] although the rental car used in the crime had been leased to a different Joyce Ann Brown, who lived in Denver, Colorado. The defendant had a strong alibi, as she was at work at the time of the crime. The conviction was based on eyewitness identification and on testimony of a cellmate that she had confessed. Following investigations by 60 Minutes, The Dallas Morning News, and Centurion Ministries, an appeal was filed. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals set aside Brown's conviction because of prosecutorial misconduct: they had not revealed that the prosecution witness had been convicted of perjury, and it was not revealed that she received a reduced sentence after testifying. Her record was expunged in 1994. May 21, 1980 Kenneth Waters Murder Ayer, Massachusetts Life in Prison 18 years Yes Kenneth Waters was convicted on May 11, 1983, for the 1980 murder of Katherina Reitz Brow and was sentenced to life in prison until he was exonerated, with the help of his sister Betty Anne, on March 15, 2001, when DNA test results proved he was not the perpetrator. Waters died in an accident six months later on September 19, 2001. His case became the subject of a 2010 film titled Conviction.[115] Jul 6, 1980 Clifford Henry Bowen Murder for hire (three counts) Oklahoma City Death Five years Yes On July 6, 1980, three men were gunned down outside a motel in Oklahoma City. Police suspected that the murders were orchestrated by police officer turned drug dealer Harold Behrens, who believed that one of the men, Ray Peters, was planning to inform on him to the police. A police officer who had worked with Behrens while he was on the force thought the description of the shooter resembled Clifford Bowen, a criminal the two of them had surveilled together, and suspected that Behrens may have hired Bowen to carry out the murders. Two witnesses identified Bowen as the shooter, although Behrens denied knowing Bowen; he was sentenced to life without parole for ordering the murders, having turned down an offer to serve just ten years which would have required him to implicate Bowen. Bowen was convicted despite being able to prove that he was 300 miles away from Oklahoma City when the murders took place and was sentenced to death. His conviction was overturned in 1986 after the prosecution was found to have suppressed evidence which implicated Leonard Lee Crowe as the shooter.[116] Aug 23, 1980 Clarence Brandley Murder Conroe, Texas Death 9 years Yes Brandley was working as a janitor at Conroe High School[117] when 16-year-old Cheryl Dee Fergeson was raped and murdered in the loft above the auditorium following a volleyball game. A foreign blood sample was found on Fergeson's shirt that did not match either Fergeson's or Brandley's blood type. Following conviction, Brandley's defense team discovered that several pieces of exculpatory evidence were not disclosed by the prosecution. Semen had been found at the scene, but was destroyed without being tested. A Caucasian pubic hair was found on the body; Brandley is African American. Also missing were photographs taken of Brandley on the day of the crime showing that he was not wearing the belt that the prosecution claimed had been the murder weapon. The prosecution received statements implicating two other men in the crime, but failed to disclose them. One of the janitors went to police following Brandley's arrest. He told police he saw another janitor leading the victim up the stairs. He alleged that he was threatened with arrest if he didn't implicate Brandley at trial. Oct 12, 1980 Steve Titus Rape Seattle, Washington N/A N/A Yes Titus was convicted of the 1980 rape of Nancy Von Roper, a hitchhiking teenager. Seattle Times reporter Paul Henderson began investigating the case after a similar rape was committed a few months after Titus' conviction. His investigation of the case led to Titus' conviction being overturned, and the charges were dropped before he was sentenced. Henderson won the Pulitzer Prize for his articles on the case. Titus lost his job as a result of the case and died of a heart attack in 1985, shortly before being awarded compensation. Nov 12, 1980 Sandra Hemme Murder St. Joseph, Missouri 50 years 43 Yes Hemme was accused of murdering Patricia Jeschke. However, evidence linked police officer Michael Holman to the crime instead. On June 14, 2024, Judge Ryan Horsman ruled that all evidence linked Holman to the crime and there was no evidence linking Hemme. She served the longest prison service for an American woman wrongfully convicted of a crime.[118] Dec 21, 1980 Claus von Bülow Attempted murder Newport, Rhode Island 30 years 3 years Yes Claus von Bülow was convicted of attempted murder of his wife, Sunny von Bülow, on the theory that he injected his wife with insulin, sending her into a coma. She was comatose for 28 years until her death in 2008. His conviction was overturned and he was retried. His defense team hired a number of world-class experts who argued that Sunny's coma was caused by a combination of oral medications, alcohol, and chronic health conditions. Also entered into evidence was a hospital admission only three weeks prior to her irreversible coma where she ingested at least 73 aspirin tablets. The defense argued that this act demonstrated Sunny's mental state was such that she once again ingested an overdose of drugs. They also argued that the presence of insulin on the tip of the needle found near Sunny suggested that it had been dipped in the insulin, but not injected, as injecting it would've wiped the needle clean. He was acquitted.[119] Summer 1981 Thomas Martin Thompson Rape, murder Laguna Beach, California Death Executed No Thompson was convicted and executed for the rape and murder of Ginger Fleischli, a crime for which he is widely believed to be innocent.[120][121][122] He was mainly convicted on the evidence of two notorious informants who claimed Thompson had admitted committing the crime in jail. The prosecution did not inform the judge or the defense that they had also charged and later convicted another person of the crime.[120] Sep 7, 1981 Grover Thompson Stabbing Mount Vernon, Illinois 40 years Died in prison in 1996 Yes Serial killer Timothy Krajcir broke into the apartment of 72-year-old Ida White and stabbed her in her shower. Thompson, who was sleeping in a post office across the street from White's apartment building, was arrested for the crime; the victim misidentified Krajcir as a black man, as did a man who witnessed the culprit fleeing. Thompson's possession of a pocket knife with a speck of dried blood was used as evidence against him.\n\nWhile confessing to other crimes in return for avoiding the death penalty, Krajcir said he attacked a woman in Mount Vernon and that a \"black guy\" had been arrested for the crime. Reporter Carly O'Keefe linked the crime to White's stabbing; after work from the Illinois Innocence Project and unsuccessful appeals, Governor Bruce Rauner granted Thompson posthumous executive clemency based on actual innocence.[123]\n\nSep 18, 1981 Raymond Towler Assault, rape Cleveland, Ohio 12 years to life, 7–25 years, and 5–25 years 27 years Yes Towler was convicted for the assault of a 12-year-old boy and rape of 11-year-old girl in a wooded area. Towler was exonerated by DNA testing. Oct 29, 1981 Ernest Holbrook and Herman Rucker Murder of Tina Harmon Lodi, Ohio Life imprisonment One year Yes Holbrook and Rucker were accused of the abduction and murder of 12-year-old Tina Harmon in 1982. There was no physical evidence against either man and Holbrook had an alibi for Harmon's abduction, but they were convicted after two eyewitnesses linked them to the crime. However, one of the eyewitnesses was found to be a pathological liar and the other, who was mentally challenged, recanted his testimony and claimed police had pressured him to lie. Rucker was given a new trial in 1983 on the basis of the recantation and was found not guilty.[124] Holbrook was denied a new trial, but the following year his conviction was overturned after evidence came to light implicating Robert Anthony Buell in the crime.[125] Dec 1981 Gloria Killian Murder, attempted murder, burglary, robbery, conspiracy Rosemont, California 32 years to life 20 years Yes In December 1981, Gary Masse and Stephen DeSantis, disguised as telephone repairmen, entered the home of an elderly couple in Rosemont, California, shot both occupants and stole six suitcases of silver. Masse's wife told the police that a woman named Gloria masterminded the robbery, prompting the police to arrest 35-year-old Gloria Killian, a former law student with no criminal record. After a preliminary hearing, the charges against Killian were dismissed. Masse was sentenced to life in prison without parole. However, after striking a deal with the Sacramento Sheriff's Department to reduce his sentence in exchange for testimony against others involved, Masse implicated Killian. Killian was re-arrested, and based solely on Masse's testimony, a jury convicted her of first-degree murder, attempted murder, burglary, robbery and conspiracy and sentenced her to 32-years-to-life in prison. Masse's sentence was reduced to 25 years. Ten years later, defense investigators discovered the deal struck between Masse and prosecutors, including a letter where Masse wrote to the prosecutors, \"I lied my ass off for you people.\" Masse later admitted that his testimony against Killian was false. In March 2002, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Killian's conviction, and in August 2002, Killian was released. The prosecutor, Christopher Cleland, was admonished by the California State Bar for his conduct in the case.[126] Aug 14, 1981 Arthur Lee Whitfield Rape Norfolk, Virginia 63 years 22 years Yes In less than one hour on the night of August 14, 1981, two women in Norfolk, Virginia were raped. Both victims eventually identified Arthur Whitfield as the assailant. In 1982, he was convicted of one of the crimes and pled guilty to the second in order to receive a lighter sentence and have some of the charges dropped. DNA testing in 2004 proved that he was innocent of both crimes. The first victim was accosted as she got out of her car. The assailant threatened her with a knife, stole her money, and ordered her to undress. The perpetrator raped her and left her there. She then drove to a friend's house and reported the rape. At trial, she testified that she had several opportunities to view the perpetrator by the light of a streetlight and a spotlight on a nearby house. At the police station, she picked out seven photographs. One of the pictures was Whitfield's. She subsequently identified him from a live lineup. The second victim was attacked not long after the first. She had exited her car and was accosted, threatened with a knife, and raped. At trial, the defense argued that Whitfield had been misidentified. Both victims described their attacker as having no facial hair, but Whitfield wore a beard at the time. Whitfield's family testified that he was with them the entire evening. The jury convicted and Whitfield was sentenced to 45 years. He pled guilty to the second crime and received 18 years, to run consecutively to the first sentence, a total of 63 years. In October 2003, Whitfield filed pro-se under the Virginia statute that governs postconviction DNA testing (passed in 2001). It appeared that the evidence had been destroyed. In December 2003, however, the state crime laboratory found pieces of evidence taped inside a notebook of the serologist who had originally tested the evidence. Mary Jane Burton had, against laboratory protocol, saved samples from some of the cases she had worked on. In 2001, evidence located in a similar manner exonerated Marvin Anderson. In 2003, the evidence Burton saved in Julius Ruffin's case was tested and exonerated him. In 2004, the evidence in Whitfield's case was subjected to DNA testing. Whitfield was excluded from the rape kit samples of both victims. The profile obtained from testing indicated that another inmate, already serving life for another sexual assault, was the true perpetrator.[127] Dec 6, 1981 Julius Ruffin Rape, sodomy, robbery Norfolk, Virginia Life 21 years Yes On December 6, 1981, Julius Ruffin was accused of raping, sodomizing, and robbing a woman in her home. The victim looked for a black male and identified Ruffin as her attacker, though the description did not match up. Ruffin is 6'1\" (187 cm), with light skin, and two distinguishable gold teeth and facial hair. She identified her attacker as 5'8\" (174 cm) with dark skin. On October 1, 1982, he was sentenced to life in prison.[128] Although the real criminal has been convicted, only one of the 'convicts' has had his name totally cleared. Julius Ruffin received $1.5 million in compensation and has had his name completely erased from the registered sex offender list and his record has been cleared of the crimes. Aaron Doxie III, the real perpetrator, was convicted for unrelated rapes, and will not be tried for the Virginia rapes because the cases are too cold and much of the evidence has been destroyed. December 16, 1981 Nick Yarris Murder, rape Delaware Death 22 years Yes Yarris, facing a possible life sentence for crimes of which he was later acquitted, attempted to strike a deal with prosecutors by falsely implicating another man in the rape-murder of Linda Mae Craig earlier that month. When Yarris' story was disproved, he became the prime suspect and was convicted the following year. After 22 years on death row, Yarris was exonerated by DNA testing and his conviction was overturned. 1982 Anthony Porter Murder Chicago, Illinois Death 17 years Yes In 1998, students in a journalism course taught by Northwestern University professor David Protess investigated the murders of Marilyn Green and her fiancé Jerry Hillard as part of a class assignment for the Medill Innocence Project. The students gathered evidence exposing serious flaws in the prosecution. A witness recanted, saying that Chicago police had \"threatened, harassed, and intimidated\" him into accusing Porter. Another student noted that the shot had been fired by a left-handed shooter; Porter was right-handed. Inez Jackson, the estranged wife of Alstory Simon, came forward and said that she had been with Simon when he killed Hilliard in retaliation for \"skimming money from drug deals\". Four days later, Simon himself confessed to the crime on videotape. Protess and the students came forward with the information. Porter was released. Simon and his wife later recanted.\n\nIn October 2014, Illinois State's Attorney Anita Alvarez decided to release Simon, stating that David Protess, a former Northwestern University journalism professor whose students initially investigated the murders and private investigator Paul Ciolino had used coercive tactics that were \"unacceptable by law enforcement standards\". Among the charges that Alvarez made was that Ciolino used an actor to falsely implicate Simon. She also criticized Simon's attorney, Jack Rimland, who represented Simon at the suggestion of Ciolino.[129]\n\n1982 Ron Williamson and Dennis Fritz Murder Ada, Oklahoma Death (Williamson), life in prison (Fritz) 11 years Yes Debra Carter was murdered in her apartment following a night out with friends at a local bar. Evidence against the men included expert testimony in hair analysis, which is now regarded as unreliable. Ada resident Glen Gore testified against both Williamson and Fritz that Carter had complained to a friend that Williamson \"made her nervous\". Gore was later connected to the murder by DNA testing and convicted.[130] He is serving life without parole.[131][132] The case served as the inspiration for John Grisham's The Innocent Man: Murder and Injustice in a Small Town. Jan 11, 1982 Alton Logan Murder Chicago, Illinois Life 26 years Yes Two African-American men shot and killed Lloyd Wickliffe and wounded Alvin Thompson on January 11, 1982, in an attempted armed robbery of a McDonald’s restaurant on the far south side of Chicago where the victims were security guards. Andrew Wilson, having been arrested and charged with the unrelated murders of two Chicago police officers, confided to his lawyers that he had indeed committed the crime of which Logan had been convicted. However, his lawyers were bound by attorney–client privilege, during Wilson’s lifetime, not to reveal what he had told them in confidence.\n\nWilson died of natural causes in prison on November 19, 2007, and his attorneys were then able to release a notarized affidavit describing Wilson’s confession to them. Logan was released in September 2008, more than 26 years after he was arrested for a murder he did not commit. He subsequently received a certificate of innocence, and was awarded $199,000 in state compensation. In January 2013, the City of Chicago agreed to pay Logan $10.25 million to settle a federal wrongful conviction lawsuit.\n\nMar 5, 1982 Victor Rosario Murder, arson Lowell, Massachusetts Life 35 Years Yes A building fire killed eight people, including three adults and five children. Although evidence suggested the fire was accidental, prosecutors believed Rosario and his brothers set the building on fire with Molotov cocktails as revenge for a drug deal. Rosario's Attorney stated he was trying to rescue people from the fire. Rosario's brothers were not tried because he refused to testify against them. Rosario signed a confession believing it would let him go, not fully understanding it due to English not being his first language. In 2014 a court vacated his conviction and in 2019 Rosario filed a lawsuit against the city.[133] Jun 1982 Earl Washington Jr. Murder Culpeper, Virginia Death 17 Years Yes Washington was convicted of the murder of Rebecca Lynn Williams solely on the basis of coerced confessions during which he seemed to have little knowledge of the crime, the victim's appearance, or the location of the crime. Washington, a farmworker who has an intellectual disability, was exonerated in 2000 by DNA tests.[134] Jul 12, 1982 Walter Forbes[135] Murder, arson Jackson, Michigan Life in prison 37 years Yes On July 12, 1982, a man died in a fire that was set in Jackson, Michigan. Dennis Hall was killed in an apparent arson at his apartment. Prior to his death, he was involved in an altercation at a bar which was broken up by college student Walter Forbes. The day after the bar fight, Hall shot Forbes requiring a few months to recover. As Hall and Forbes had been involved in two recent altercations, police arrested Forbes for Hall's death. Forbes would be convicted in court for the murder and arson in May 1983 and he was sentenced to life in prison for first degree murder.\n\nIn 2017, a witness who had claimed she had seen Forbes and two others burn down the apartment recanted her statement. She claimed to a judge in 2020 that she had been threatened to do so by two men from her neighborhood who warned they would harm her and her family if she failed to testify against the three. Of them, only Forbes had been convicted due to discrepancies in her testimony. In addition to other evidence being uncovered, Forbes' conviction was overturned and he was freed in November 2020.\n\nIt is now believed that the owner of the apartment, David Jones, was behind the arson as part of an insurance fraud scheme. Jones received a significant payout for the arson that damaged the building and killed Hall. Eight years later, Jones would be convicted of a different insurance fraud scheme involving arson where another person died. Two people confessed to conspiracy in that arson and testified against Jones in court.\n\nJul 17, 1982 Marvin Anderson Rape Hanover County, Virginia Life in prison 15 years Yes A woman who stopped to help an injured bicyclist was instead attacked and dragged into the woods. During the rape, the black perpetrator told the victim that she reminded him of his white girlfriend. Based on this, Anderson, a local black man with a white girlfriend, was arrested. He was sentenced to life in prison, and despite a man named John Otis Lincoln confessing to the rape in 1988, his conviction was not vacated. He was released on parole in 1997. In 2001, it was discovered that the criminalist who worked on the case had saved the cotton swab used, against agency policy. When tested, it confirmed that Anderson was not the rapist. Governor Mark Warner pardoned him in 2002.[136] Oct 21, 1982 Johnny Briscoe Rape, robbery St. Louis, Missouri 45 years 23 years Yes Briscoe was tried for a 1982 rape and robbery. After the rape, the perpetrator smoked a cigarette, leaving the butt behind. While at the crime scene, the victim asked the perpetrator for his name. He told her his name was John Briscoe. Briscoe's photo was shown to the victim. A week later, she picked him out of a lineup in which he was the only one wearing a prison jumpsuit; the other men were wearing civilian clothing. Briscoe was convicted on the basis of a cross-racial eyewitness identification and hair analysis of hairs found at the crime scene, both of which are known to have a high degree of unreliability. In 2004, the cigarette butt was found from the crime scene matching another man named Larry Smith. Prior to the identification of Smith via DNA, Briscoe and Smith were serving time together in the same prison. Briscoe had heard rumors that Smith was the perpetrator and confronted him about it. Smith denied that he was involved. It is unknown why Smith used Briscoe's name during the crime, although he may have done it in order to frame Briscoe.[137] Feb 4, 1983 Carlos DeLuna Murder Corpus Christi, Texas Death Executed No DeLuna was executed in 1989 for stabbing gas station attendant Wanda Lopez to death in a robbery. He had been identified by eyewitnesses to the crime, but the witnesses' accounts contained many inconsistencies and several were unable to tell apart photos of DeLuna and alternative suspect Carlos Hernández. DeLuna claimed to have witnessed Hernandez committing the murder, and investigations after DeLuna's execution found multiple people who claimed Hernandez had bragged about the crime. Feb 25, 1983 Rolando Cruz and Alejandro Hernandez Murder of Jeanine Nicarico Naperville, Illinois Death Eight years Yes 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico was abducted by an intruder while home alone with influenza on February 25, 1983. Two days later her raped and beaten body was found in a wooded area near her home. Two Latino gang members, Rolando Cruz and Alejandro Hernandez, both separately made up details about the murder in an attempt to claim a monetary reward for information, but when their stories were disproven they soon became suspects and were convicted in 1987. Police allegedly added details of the crime that had not been made public to the men's confessions after the fact in order to make them more authentic. During the trial, serial killer Brian Dugan, on trial at the same time, offered to confess to Jeanine Nicarico's murder as part of a plea agreement but was turned down; this information was not given to the defense. Cruz and Hernandez were both given new trials in 1989 due to prosecutorial misconduct but were both convicted and sent back to death row. However, in 1994 DNA testing exonerated both men and proved that Dugan committed the murder. The following year, Cruz was acquitted at his third trial and the State's Attorney dismissed the charges against Hernandez. Brian Dugan later pleaded guilty to the murder of Jeanine Nicarico.[138] Aug 1983 Willie Earl Green Murder Los Angeles, California 33 years to life 25 years Yes Denise Walker was killed during a robbery at the home of her boyfriend, Willie Finley. One burglar struck Finley on the head as he was returning from a store, and then brought him into the house where he ordered Walker to let in a second burglar. Walker's mother told police that Willie Green had robbed Denise a year earlier. Finley identified Green in a lineup and he was convicted. Green sought help from Centurion Ministries, a New Jersey-based wrongful conviction advocacy group. In 2004, during their reinvestigation, Finley recanted his testimony. He said that he was high on crack at the time of the attack and that his eyesight had been impaired by the blow to the head. He told investigators that he did not identify Green until police suggested Green as the attacker and told him of the earlier robbery. Based on Finley's recantation, his conviction was vacated in March 2008, and prosecutors decided not to retry him.[139] Sep 13, 1983 Juan Roberto Melendez-Colon Murder Auburndale, Florida Death 17 years Yes Melendez had an alibi and was convicted of the murder of Delbert Baker largely on testimony of David Falcon, who had a longstanding grudge against Melendez. Witnesses said Falcon had threatened to kill Melendez at some point prior to Melendez allegedly confessing to him. His appeal was denied three times when defense lawyers discovered a taped confession made by Vernon James. In light of the new evidence, Justice Barbara Fleischer determined that Melendez was entitled to a new trial. The state of Florida declined to prosecute a second time since the key witness at the original trial, David Falcon, was now dead and another witness for the prosecution had since recanted his testimony. Nov 1983 John Gordon Purvis Murder Fort Lauderdale, Florida Life in prison 10 years Police received a tip that a man named Robert Wayne Beckett Sr. may have been involved in the murder of Susan Hamwi. Eventually a new set of detectives investigated Beckett, who admitted to the murder for hire on the instruction of Paul Hamwi, her ex-husband. He named Paul Serio as an accomplice.[140] Nov 1983 Glenn Ford Murder Shreveport, Louisiana Death by electrocution 30 years Yes An all-white jury delivered a guilty verdict in the case of the murder of Isadore Rozeman without any physical evidence directly linking Ford to the crime, with the inexperienced public defenders unable to secure any witnesses. Evidentiary hearings in 2004 and 2005 found the state failed to disclose exculpatory evidence. The state actively suppressed evidence from before the trial that showed two confidential witnesses corroborating Ford's story that he became involved in the crime after the murders, and that another man was in possession of the murder weapon after the crime. In 2013, the state notified Ford's counsel that a confidential informant for the Caddo Parish Sheriff's Office stated that another man confessed to the murder. Ford was exonerated and released in 2014.[141] 1983 Mary Ann and Joe Elizondo Child sexual abuse* Jefferson, Texas 35 years 7–13 years Yes In 1983, 10-year-old Robert Bienvenue and 8-year-old Richard told police that they had been sexually abused by their mother, Mary Ann Elizondo, and stepfather, Joe Elizondo. At the time, the boys were in the custody of their father and only spent weekends with their mother. Both Mary Ann and Joe were arrested and charged with sexual abuse, and in 1984, Joe was sentenced to life in prison, while Mary Ann was sentenced to 35 years in prison. After Mary Ann was released on parole in 1991, she was jailed for another six months for refusing to admit to sexually abusing her sons. All the while, Robert's father told him that Mary Ann simply abandoned him. But on his 17th birthday, Robert discovered a letter from his mother and learned for the first time that she and Joe were in prison, prompting him to reveal to the authorities that his father forced him to falsely accuse his mother of sexual abuse in retaliation for Mary Ann marrying Joe. A court granted Joe a new trial, and in 1997, prosecutors dismissed the case. In 2005, an appeals court vacated Mary Ann's conviction.[142] 1983 Maurice Hastings Murder, rape Inglewood, California Life in prison 38 years Yes Hastings was charged with the rape and murder of Roberta Wydermyer. Despite DNA evidence being recovered from semen, the DA's office denied the request to have it DNA tested. In 2022 it was tested and identified as belonging to Kenneth Packnett, who died in prison in 2020 after having been convicted of armed kidnapping and rape. Hastings was released in October 2022, and he was declared \"factually innocent\" by a judge in March 2023.[143] 1983–1984 Anthony Capozzi Rape, sodomy, sexual abuse Buffalo, New York 11–35 years 21 years Yes Capozzi spent 21 years in prison maintaining his innocence when in 2006, a woman was killed along a bike path in a Buffalo suburb. Investigators noticed similarities to a number of other rapes and murders in the area and believed they were committed by one individual. DNA testing implicated Altemio Sanchez, who would eventually plead guilty to the 2006 murder and two others. At least eight crimes were eventually linked to Sanchez via DNA analysis. During the investigation, a detective noticed that one of Capozzi's alleged victims testified that she saw her rapist driving several days later and she copied down his license plate information. When the police initially investigated the tip, they found the owner of the vehicle, but he had an alibi. He was reinterviewed in 2006 and admitted that he had lent the car to his nephew, Altemio Sanchez, that day.\n\nAuthorities subpoenaed the hospital where the rape victims were initially treated for evidence from the rape kits. It was believed that the evidence had been lost or destroyed, but eventually it was found and tested, excluding Capozzi and implicating Sanchez.[144]\n\n1984 Bernard Baran Child sexual abuse* Pittsfield, Massachusetts Three life sentences 21 years Yes Baran's conviction is cited as an example of the day-care sex-abuse hysteria of the 1980s and 1990s as well as a case of homophobia. The Baran case is the subject of the documentary film Freeing Bernie Baran. 1984 Alfred Chestnut, Ransom Watkins, and Andrew Stewart Jr. Murder, robbery, illegal use of a weapon Baltimore, Maryland Life in prison 36 years Yes [145] 1984 Leroy Orange Murder Chicago, Illinois Death 19 years Yes Leroy Orange was arrested along with his half-brother Leonard Kidd. He was convicted of killing Ricardo Pedro, Michelle Jointer, his ex-girlfriend Renee Coleman, and her 10-year-old son, Tony, on the basis of a confession allegedly obtained through torture methods such as beating, suffocation, and electroshock. He was pardoned in 2006. Kidd's death sentence was commuted to life in prison. He maintains his innocence and contends that his confession was elicited through torture as well.[146] 1984 Kirk Bloodsworth Murder Baltimore, Maryland Death 8 years Yes On July 25, 1984, 9-year-old Dawn Hamilton was found dead in a wooded area. She had been beaten with a rock, sexually assaulted, and strangled. Kirk Bloodsworth was convicted on March 8, 1985, of sexual assault, rape, and first-degree premeditated murder. A Baltimore County judge sentenced Bloodsworth to death. He was exonerated almost nine years later after DNA testing excluded him.[147] Bloodsworth became the first person in the U.S. exonerated with DNA evidence.[148] The Innocence Project established the Kirk Bloodsworth Post-Conviction DNA Testing Program, a program that helps states defray the costs of post-conviction DNA testing.[149] 1984 Darryl Hunt Murder Winston-Salem, North Carolina Life in prison 19.5 years Yes Hunt was convicted of the murder of Deborah Sykes on the basis of eyewitness testimony. He was later cleared by DNA testing, and another man went on to plead guilty to the crime. Jan 3, 1984 Thomas Haynesworth Rape Richmond, Virginia 84 years 27 years Yes Haynesworth was arrested at the age of 18 in 1984 after a woman identified him as her attacker. He was convicted of a series of violent rapes in Richmond, Virginia, now believed to have been committed by a neighbor who resembled Haynesworth. In 2009, new state laws and procedures allowed for DNA testing, which was not available in the 1980s, and semen collected from the first attack implicated the neighbor.\n\nThe case, which The Washington Post called \"one of the state's most extraordinary legal cases\",[150] utilized DNA testing and new state laws that allowed possibly innocent convicts to present new evidence.\n\nSep 23, 1983 Henry McCollum and Leon Brown Murder, rape Red Springs, North Carolina Death (McCollum); death, commuted to life (Brown) 31 years Yes McCollum and Brown were 19 and 15-year-old half-brothers, respectively, when they were arrested for the rape and murder of 11-year-old Sabrina Buie. Both half-brothers had intellectual disabilities, which made them susceptible to manipulation during their police interrogations. Red Springs and Robeson County police and interrogators convinced McCollum and Brown to waive their Miranda rights and sign inconsistent and contradictory confessions that implicated them in the murder, despite the evidence suggesting that Roscoe Artis, a serial rapist and possible serial killer in the area, had committed Buie's murder as he had committed several other similar crimes against at least two other women. In addition, Brown signed his confession in block letters rather than a signature because he was nearly illiterate and could not read his confession. In October 1984, both McCollum and Brown were sentenced to death, with Brown becoming the youngest person on North Carolina's death row. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia used McCollum's case to justify the existence of the death penalty.[151]\n\nAfter appealing, both death sentences were overturned in 1988, and the two had retrials in 1991. McCollum was again convicted of rape and murder and re-sentenced to death, while Brown was only convicted of rape and sentenced to life imprisonment. The two remained in prison/on death row for a total of 31 years before DNA testing confirmed that neither McCollum's DNA nor Brown's were found at the crime scene. However, because technology could not provide a positive match at the time, the two were held in prison until the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission looked into their case and concluded that the physical evidence matched Roscoe Artis. McCollum and Brown were exonerated in September 2014, with McCollum being the longest-serving death row inmate in North Carolina history. The two were formally pardoned in 2015, enabling them to pursue compensation for their wrongful imprisonment. After multiple state and federal lawsuits, a federal court cumulatively awarded McCollum and Brown with $75 million, the largest award for a wrongful conviction in United States history.[151] Artis died in prison in 2020 while serving a life sentence for a separate murder.\n\nDec 6, 1984 John Thompson Murder, carjacking New Orleans, Louisiana Life plus 49 years 18 years Yes Feb 5, 1985 Beatrice Six: Thomas Winslow, Joseph White, Ada JoAnn Taylor, Kathy Gonzalez, James Dean, and Debra Shelden Murder Beatrice, Nebraska Varies Varies Yes Thomas Winslow, Joseph White, Ada JoAnn Taylor, Kathy Gonzalez, James Dean, and Debra Shelden were found guilty of the 1985 rape and murder of Helen Wilson. They were pardoned in 2008 after DNA evidence from the crime scene identified Bruce Allen Smith as the true culprit. Smith died in 1992.[152] Feb 25, 1985 Anthony Ray Hinton Murder, armed robbery Birmingham, Alabama Death 29 years Yes Hinton was sentenced to death in 1985 for armed robbery and the murders of John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason, two fast food managers in Birmingham. The US Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that his defense lawyer had been deficient. Prosecutors admitted that the bullets found at the scene did not match Hinton's gun; Hinton's conviction was thrown out by a circuit court judge in April 2015 and he was freed.[153] Mar 1985 Dennis Perry Murder Camden County, Georgia Two life sentences 19 years Yes Harold and Thelma Swain were killed after an invasion at their church during a bible study session. Perry was convicted based on witness testimony by an ex-girlfriend's mother who later received a Crimestoppers reward. Perry was also believed to resemble a composite sketch made based on the information of several women who were at the church that night. Perry took a post-conviction deal to avoid the death penalty which restricted his ability to appeal.[154]\n\nAfter coverage by the podcast Undisclosed and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution a potential alternate suspect was identified and DNA testing was pursued by the Georgia Innocence Project. DNA evidence from hairs on glasses left at the scene were tested, and did not match Perry, but were consistent with the alternate suspect.\n\nMar 1985 Margaret Earle Murder Plymouth, Massachusetts Life in prison 5 years Yes In March 1985, Margaret Earle left her 21-month-old daughter Rachelle in the care of her boyfriend, Michael Burnham, to celebrate her 21st birthday with a friend. The next morning, Margaret found her daughter ill but was unable to reach her doctor. While Margaret went to a pharmacy, the paramedics rushed Rachelle to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Rachelle's autopsy revealed significant injuries, including fractured ribs and internal bleeding. However, both Margaret and Michael denied any wrongdoing, and the case went cold. Years later, Michael called 911 and confessed to murdering Rachelle in anger over having to babysit a child. Police accused Margaret of failing to promptly seek medical treatment for Rachelle, and both Michael and Margaret were charged with first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. But after Margaret's appellate lawyer uncovered evidence of Margaret's phone calls to the doctor, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reversed Margaret's conviction. Prosecutors subsequently dismissed the case.[155] Mar 9, 1985 David Lee Gavitt Murder, arson* Ionia, Michigan Three life terms 26 years Yes On March 9, 1985, a fire broke out at the Gavitt family home. David Lee Gavitt managed to escape the house, but his wife Angela and their daughters Tracy and Katrina were all killed. Arson investigators claimed that irregular circular burn marks on the floor indicated the fire was deliberately started using an accelerant. David Gavitt was accused of starting the fire, although no motive as to why he would have done so was presented, and he was convicted in 1986. He was freed on appeal in 2012 after advances in science revealed that the evidence was consistent with an accidental fire.[156] Jul 29, 1985 Steven Avery Rape Two Rivers, Wisconsin 32 years 18 years Yes 36-year-old Penny Ann Beerntsen was jogging along Lake Michigan when she was grabbed from behind, dragged into a wooded area and raped. Despite having alibis, Avery was convicted on the basis of a visual identification by the victim and visual hair analysis. In April 2002, DNA testing of 13 pubic hairs recovered from Beerntsen excluded Avery. The DNA matched a man named Gregory Allen, who bore a striking resemblance to Avery. Avery was exonerated and released. As a result of the case, Wisconsin made changes to their eyewitness protocol. Avery also filed a civil suit for wrongful conviction against Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, and some county officials, seeking $36 million in damages.[157][158] Avery settled the lawsuit for $400,000, used for his defense of the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach, for which he and nephew Brendan Dassey were convicted.\n\nOn December 18, 2015, Netflix released a documentary that covers both of Avery's convictions. This 10-episode documentary titled Making a Murderer was filmed over 10 years.[159]\n\nAllen was never charged in the Beerntsen case because the statute of limitations has expired.\n\nDec 1, 1985 Ralph \"Ricky\" Birch and Shawn Henning Murder New Milford, Connecticut 55 years 30 years Yes Birch and Henning were charged with killing 65-year-old Everett Carr, who was stabbed 27 times at his home. There was no forensic evidence directly linking the two to the crime, but they were convicted based on the testimony of forensics expert Henry Lee, who said a towel had tested positive for blood. However, tests conducted after the trial found the substance was not blood, and a judge found there was no evidence Lee had actually conducted any testing on the towel. The murder convictions were vacated in 2020.[160] 1985 Tim Cole Rape Lubbock, Texas 25 years 14 years (died in prison) Yes Cole was convicted of rape on basis of a visual identification by the victim, Michele Mallin, his classmate.[161] Among other things, Mallin told police that the rapist smoked during the rape. However, Cole never smoked because of his severe asthma. He died in prison on December 2, 1999, from an asthma attack. Another man, Jerry Wayne Johnson, confessed to the rape in 2007. DNA evidence later confirmed that the rape was committed by Johnson.[162] Cole was posthumously exonerated; it was the first posthumous DNA exoneration in the history of the state of Texas.[163]\n\nJohnson confirmed in court that he was the rapist and asked the victim and Cole's family to forgive him. \"It's been on my heart to express my sincerest sorrow and regret and ask to be forgiven,\" said Johnson, who is serving life in prison for two other 1985 rapes. However, Johnson cannot be charged in the Mallin case because the statute of limitations has expired.[164][165]\n\nApr 13, 1986 Johnny Lee Wilson Murder Aurora, Missouri Life in prison 8 years Yes In 1995, Wilson was pardoned by the governor of Missouri, Mel Carnahan. He had been sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 1986 murder of an elderly woman, seventy-nine-year-old Pauline Martz. Wilson confessed to the crime, but Carnahan concluded in his investigation that Wilson, an intellectually disabled twenty-year-old, was coerced by the authorities. Carnahan also concluded that there was no evidence linking Wilson to the murder.[166] Aug 13, 1986 Michael Morton Murder Williamson County, Texas Life in prison 25 years Yes Morton was convicted of his wife Christine Morton's murder in 1987. He was exonerated in 2011 after DNA tests linked another man, Mark Alan Norwood, to the murder. Norwood was subsequently convicted of Christine's murder. He also is a suspect in the 1988 murder of Debra Baker in her Austin home. Both women were beaten to death in their beds.[167] The prosecutor in the case was charged with contempt after it was discovered that he withheld evidence from the defense team. He gave up his law license and served five days in jail as part of a plea bargain.[168][169][170] Jul 14, 1986 Santiago Ventura Morales Murder Sandy, Oregon 10 years to life 5 years Yes Morales was convicted of the murder of Ramiro Lopez Fidel in 1986. At trial, he was provided a Spanish interpreter, though his native language is Mixtec. He maintained his innocence and several jurors later had second thoughts about the conviction and began advocating that he be released from prison. The lack of an appropriate interpreter and other deficiencies in his trial led to his conviction being overturned as well as evidence that pointed to another person.[171] In 1995, the state of Oregon passed a law that requires testing and certification of court interpreters as a result of the Morales case.[172] Jun 30, 1986 Kenny Richey Murder* Columbus Grove, Ohio Death 21 years No Two-year-old Cynthia Collins perished in an apartment fire while her mother was away. Her mother told police that Richey was babysitting. After partying with Cynthia's mother, Richey agreed to keep an eye on the girl in exchange for a place to sleep for the night. Richey was able to escape when the fire broke out, but Cynthia died from smoke inhalation. He was convicted on a number of charges related to starting the fire. The scientific evidence presented at trial to prove this was not accidental was highly disputed, and his conviction was eventually overturned. In lieu of taking the case to trial again, prosecutors had offered to accept a \"no contest\" plea to attempted involuntary manslaughter, child endangerment, and breaking and entering in exchange for release. Although his conviction still stands, the case gained widespread attention across Europe. The European Parliament approved a resolution urging that Richey's life be spared, and Pope John Paul II made an appeal on his behalf. Amnesty International described his case as \"the most compelling case of innocence we have come across on death row.\"[173][174] Sep 27, 1986 Douglas DiLosa Murder Kenner, Louisiana Life in prison 14 years Yes In September 1986, police were called to the DiLosa home to find Douglas and Glinda DiLosa tied up by intruders. Glinda DiLosa had been strangled to death. Police claimed not to have found any sign of forced entry and accused Douglas DiLosa of killing his wife for her life insurance policy. After his conviction, DiLosa obtained a police report revealing evidence withheld by the prosecution at his trial, which included hair belonging to a black man (DiLosa was white, but the men he accused of the murder were black) found on the rope used to strangle Glinda and unidentified fingerprints being found at the crime scene. DiLosa was released pending a retrial in 2001 and charges were dismissed two years later.[175] Nov 1, 1986 Walter McMillian Murder Monroeville, Alabama Death Four years Yes Ronda Morrison, an 18-year-old white girl, was shot to death at a dry-cleaners in 1986. Walter McMillian, a black man, was arrested and immediately sent to Alabama's death row, where he was held for two years without having even been charged. McMillian was eventually charged in 1988 despite six witnesses placing him at a fish fry during the murder. Informant Ralph Myers claimed to have witnessed McMillian commit the murder, and two other witnesses placed McMillian's low-rider truck at the scene (although his truck was not converted to a low-rider until after the murder). After six years on death row (including two years pre-trial detention), his lawyer Bryan Stevenson presented evidence withheld by the prosecution, including an interrogation tape in which Myers complained that he was being forced to implicate McMillian. The two witnesses who claimed to have seen McMillian's truck also recanted their testimony. McMillian was granted a new trial, and the charges were dropped later that year.[176] Jan 22 and Feb 16, 1987 Glen Woodall Sexual assault, sexual abuse, kidnapping, robbery Barboursville, West Virginia 2 life terms without parole plus 203–335 years 5 years Yes Two victims in two separate incidents were abducted, raped, and robbed. The assailant wore a ski mask, but both victims noted a few characteristics, such as the perpetrator was uncircumcised. Woodall was convicted on circumstantial evidence, including testimony that he shared the same blood type, similar body and beard hair, voice identification, and a partial visual identification by victim two, and the fact that Woodall was uncircumcised.\n\nWoodall was granted DNA testing in 1988 on semen samples recovered from the victims—the first ever admitted as evidence at the state level in the United States—which excluded Woodall, and the conviction was thrown out.\n\nWoodall was the first person to be exonerated after being convicted due to testimony by lab technician Fred Zain. Woodall's defense team conducted its own tests on the evidence, which determined that Zain had used flawed blood-typing methods in tying the semen to Woodall. It further appeared that Zain had initially determined a piece of hair was unidentifiable pubic hair, but later changed his identification to hair from Woodall's beard.[177][178] Woodall subsequently sued the state for false imprisonment and won a $1 million settlement.[179]\n\nAt the request of the state police, Kanawha County Prosecutor William Forbes began a criminal investigation. Forbes was so disturbed by what he found that he asked the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia to appoint a special judge and a panel of lawyers and scientists to investigate the serology department.[178] On November 4, 1993, Senior Circuit Court Judge James Holliday issued a report finding that Zain had engaged in a staggering litany of misconduct and outright fraud. According to the report, Zain had misstated evidence, falsified lab results and reported scientifically implausible results that may have resulted in as many as 134 people being wrongfully convicted. Holliday found that Zain's misconduct was so egregious that any testimony offered by Zain should be presumed as prima facie \"invalid, unreliable, and inadmissible\". It also found serious deficiencies in the serology division's quality-control procedures. The Supreme Court unanimously accepted Holliday's report on November 12, calling Zain's actions \"egregious violations of the right of a defendant to a fair trial\" and a \"corruption of our legal system\".[178][179][180] West Virginia paid out a total of $6.5 million to settle lawsuits by people who had been wrongfully convicted due to Zain.[181][182][183]\n\nFeb 11, 1987 Tim Masters Murder Fort Collins, Colorado Life in prison 9 years Yes Peggy Hettrick was murdered in 1987. Masters was a sophomore in high school at the time of the murder. He was convicted largely on the basis of graphic drawings by Masters portraying violent scenes. He was later eliminated via DNA testing. In 2008, special prosecutors assigned to the case agreed that critical information was not turned over to the original defense team.[184][185] Rather, the DNA results pointed to Hettrick's sometime boyfriend.[186] In 2008 a Colorado judge vacated Masters' conviction and ordered him released immediately. Sep 1987 Susie Mowbray Murder* Cameron, Texas Life in prison 9 years Yes In September 1987, car dealer Bill Mowbray shot himself in his bed, while his wife, Susie Mowbray, was lying next to him. Despite the fact that Bill had been threatening to commit suicide for months over financial troubles, the police zeroed in on Susie as the culprit and charged her with first-degree murder. At her trial, detectives claimed that the blood spatter indicated that Susie shot her husband, and in June 1988, Susie was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. In 1996, Susie was granted a new trial after it was revealed that the prosecution suppressed a report from blood spatter expert Herbert MacDonnell, who concluded that the police's luminol staining procedure was unreliable and that no blood spatter was found on Susie's nightgown. The police even admitted at a hearing that there was no scientific support for their case. In January 1998, a jury acquitted Susie of the charges.[187] Oct 24, 1987 Willie Grimes Rape, kidnapping Hickory, North Carolina Life in prison and 9 years 24 years, 9 months, 23 days Yes On October 24, 1987, around 9 p.m., a black man forced his way into the home of a white 69-year old widow in Hickory, North Carolina, brandishing a knife. He raped her on her couch, dragged her to her bedroom and raped her again before leaving through the back door, stealing some fruit from a bowl in the kitchen on his way out. Linda McDowell, a neighbor of the victim and sister of Grimes' ex-girlfriend, pointed the police to Willie Grimes, knowing of a $1,000 reward. During his trial, microscopic hair analysis was used to indicate him and the victim identified him as the perpetrator - after pointing to his attorney first. Eight friends who spent the evening with Grimes gave him an alibi and four other witnesses spoke to his \"calm\" character with no violent tendencies. Grimes himself pointed out that the victim never mentioned a significant scar on his chest and two missing fingertips. Grimes was convicted by a mostly white jury to life in prison for the rapes and 9 years for the kidnapping. In 2001, when post-conviction DNA testing was established in North Carolina, Grimes sought testing of the hair and was told the evidence was destroyed - although his lawyer had requested it to be preserved immediately after the conviction. In 2003, finger prints taken from fruit in the kitchen were matched to Albert Lindsey Turner who had been a suspect before the informant's call. In 2010, a petition was filed with the North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission and the case and new evidence were given to a tribunal of judges in 2012. The tribunal decided within 30 minutes to vacate Grimes convictions. In the retrial the DA apologized to Grimes instead of a closing argument and he was exonerated. He was awarded $6.2 million in damages in settlements with the city and state.[188] 1987 Levon Jones Murder Duplin County, North Carolina Death 14 years Yes Jones was sentenced to death in 1993 for the murder of Leamon Grady. Lovely Lorden, the sole witness against Jones, admitted in an affidavit that she \"was certain that Bo did not have anything to do with Mr. Grady's murder\" and that she did not know what happened the night Grady was murdered. His conviction was overturned in 2006 and he was released.[189] Jan 22, 1988 James Calvin Tillman Rape Hartford, Connecticut 45 years 16 years Yes Accused and found guilty of rape, Tillman was released after DNA tests proved he was not the culprit. Sep 7, 1988 Martin Tankleff Murder Long Island, New York Two terms of 25 years to life 17 years Yes Martin Tankleff's parents, Seymour and Arlene Tankleff, were murdered while the 17-year-old Tankleff was sleeping in the home. He was convicted on the basis of a false confession given during an extended interrogation. His convictions were overturned in 2007 after his defense attorney presented an alternative scenario involving Seymour's business partner, to whom he owed money, and three former convicts, one of whom confessed to being the getaway driver. Sep 1988 Virginia LeFever Murder* Newark, Ohio Life in prison 21 years Yes In September 1988, William LeFever, while in the middle of a divorce, died of an acute drug overdose. His wife, Virginia, found an empty bottle of antidepressants in their home and subsequently told police that he had committed suicide. However, the police accused Virginia of poisoning her husband and charged her with murder. In February 1990, Virginia was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. 20 years later, Virginia's lawyer discovered that the prosecution's key witness, toxicologist James Ferguson, lied about his credentials, prompting a court to reverse Virginia's conviction. In April 2011, the prosecution dismissed the case.[190] Oct 24, 1988 Chris Ochoa and Richard Danzinger Murder Austin, Texas Life in prison (both) 13 years Yes In 1988, Nancy DePriest was raped and murdered at the Pizza Hut where she worked in Austin, Texas. A coworker, Chris Ochoa, pleaded guilty to the murder. His friend and coworker, Richard Danziger, was convicted of the rape. Ochoa confessed to the murder, as well as implicating Danziger in the rape. The only forensic evidence linking Danziger to the crime scene was a single pubic hair found in the restaurant, which was said to be consistent with his pubic hair type. Although semen evidence had been collected, a DNA analysis of only one gene was performed at the time; even though Ochoa had this gene, it was known also to be present in 10–16% of individuals.[191] Both men received life sentences with no possibility of parole.[191]\n\nYears later a man named Achim Marino (who was in prison serving his three-life sentences for robbery, rape and murder respectively) began writing letters from prison claiming he was the actual murderer in the Pizza Hut case and that Ocha and Danziger were innocent. He said that he had converted to Christianity while in prison and wanted to tell the truth to free Ochoa and Danziger from prison. The DNA from the crime scene was tested, and it matched that of Marino.[when?] The DNA of Ochoa and Danziger was excluded from matching that evidence. Ochoa later said that he was coerced by the police to confess and implicate his friend in the rape and murder.\n\nIn 2001 Ochoa and Danziger were exonerated and released from prison after 12 years of incarceration. While in prison, Danziger had been severely beaten by other inmates in 1991 and suffered permanent brain damage. He requires all day medical care for the rest of his life.[192] Marino was later convicted of the murder (he couldn't be charged with the rape due to the statute of limitations.) and was given an additional life sentence.\n\nNov 8, 1988 Joseph Burrows Murder Kankakee, Illinois Death 6 years Yes William Dulan, an 88-year-old retired farmer, was found dead November 8, 1988. Several hours after the murder, a man named Chuck Gullion attempted to cash one of Dulan's checks at a local bank. Gullion was arrested along with 32-year-old Gayle Potter. Potter admitted to the killing, but implicated two others: Burrows and Ralph Frye, 22, an intellectually disabled friend of Burrows.\n\nNo physical evidence linked either Burrows or Frye to the crime, and the two men had alibis. After a lengthy interrogation, Frye agreed to a plea deal in exchange for testifying against Burrows. Following Burrows' conviction, Frye recanted his testimony to news reporter Peter Rooney, claiming that police had coerced him in exchange for a lesser sentence. Burrows' lawyers discovered a letter written by Potter asking a friend to lie and say that she had seen Burrows drive her to the crime scene. Confronted with the letter, Potter admitted that she had falsely accused the men in part because she mistakenly believed that Burrows had burglarized her trailer.\n\nJan 1989 Employees at the Little Rascals day care facility Child sexual abuse* Edenton, North Carolina Varied, 7 years to life Varied Varied Day-care sex-abuse hysteria: In January, 1989, allegations were made that Bob Kelly had sexually abused a child. A total of 90 children, after many therapy sessions (in some cases up to ten months' worth), also made allegations leading to accusations against dozens besides Kelly and charges against seven adults (Bob and Betsy Kelly, three workers at the day care, a worker at a local Head Start center and the son of a judge). The charges ultimately involved rape, sodomy, and fellatio, while other bizarre allegations were also made, including the murder of babies, torture, and being thrown into a school of sharks.\n\nDuring the trial, children were asked to testify about events that had occurred three years previously, with memories \"refreshed\" in therapy sessions, meetings with the prosecution and repeated discussions with their parents. While the alleged abuse was occurring, no parents noticed anything unusual about their children's behavior to indicate abuse or torture. The eight-month trial against Bob Kelly was the most expensive in North Carolina history, ending in conviction on 99 of 100 charges and twelve consecutive life sentences, though on May 2, 1995, all convictions were reversed in the Court of Appeals.[193][194]\n\nApr 19, 1989 Central Park Five: Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, and Korey Wise Assault, rape Manhattan, New York Varied Varied Yes The five boys, who were between the ages of 14 and 16 at the time, were convicted of the assault and rape of Trisha Ellen Meili, who was jogging in Central Park. They were convicted and their convictions were upheld on appeal, though they asserted that their convictions were based on allegedly coerced confessions and allegedly faulty scientific evidence. The convictions were vacated in 2002 when Matias Reyes, a convicted rapist and murderer serving a life sentence for other crimes and whose DNA evidence confirmed his involvement in the rape, claimed after the statute of limitations had run that he had committed the crimes alone, a claim the Armstrong Report disagreed with. Apr 11, 1989 Sabrina Butler Murder* Mississippi Death 5 years Butler was convicted of murder and child abuse after her unresponsive nine-month-old son, Walter Dean Butler, was rushed to the hospital. At retrial, one of Sabrina's neighbors corroborated her account of events and the medical examiner changed his opinion about Walter's cause of death, which he now believed occurred due to a renal condition. Sabrina was acquitted. Aug 1989 Jeffrey Scott Hornoff Murder Warwick, Rhode Island Life in prison 6 years Yes Victoria Cushman was killed in 1989. Hornoff was a police detective who had an affair with the victim. He was arrested in 1994, and convicted by a jury of first-degree murder in June 1996, despite what seemed a rock-solid alibi and no physical evidence linking him to the crime.\n\nIn November 2002, Todd Barry confessed to the murder and in 2003, Barry was sentenced to 30 years in prison.[195]\n\nDec 2, 1989 Debra Milke Murder Phoenix, Arizona Death 23 years Yes Milke was convicted of the murder of her four-year-old son, Christopher Milke, on the basis of testimony by police officer Armando Saldate that she had freely confessed to him, orally, in private and without a recording. Saldate had a long record of misconduct, including a suspension for taking \"liberties\" with a female motorist and then lying about it to his supervisors; four court cases where judges tossed out confessions or indictments because Saldate lied under oath; and four cases where judges suppressed confessions or vacated convictions because Saldate had violated the Fifth Amendment or the Fourth Amendment in the course of interrogations. Her conviction was vacated in 2013, and attempts at a retrial were dismissed two years later. Jan 4, 1989 Debbie Tucker Loveless and John Harvey Miller Murder* Emory, Texas Life in prison 4 years Yes Loveless and Miller were convicted of murdering Loveless' 4-year-old daughter, April Renee Tucker, who died on the operating table after sustaining multiple lacerations, including a severed femoral artery. Loveless and Miller claimed that April had told them she had been attacked and mauled by dogs, but investigators rejected their theory, in large part because April's wound was a clean cut, lacking the jagged edges one would expect in a dog attack. On November 5, 1989, they were convicted and sentenced to life in prison. While working on their appeal, lawyers for Miller and Loveless found that April's emergency room and autopsy photos, which had not been turned over the defense prior to the trial, strongly supported the theory that April was attacked by dogs. Furthermore, a key piece of prosecution evidence was found to be flawed: while trying to save April's life, doctors had cut away some of the damaged skin with scalpels, causing the clean cuts that had been mistakenly attributed to abuse. Based on the prosecution's failure to disclose potentially exculpatory evidence, Loveless and Miller's convictions were overturned and they were granted a new trial. Loveless and Miller were released from prison on December 23, 1993; prosecutors elected not to re-try Loveless and Miller for the crime, and formally dismissed the charges against them on May 2, 1994.[196] Jul 1989 Patricia Stallings Murder* Jefferson City, Missouri Life in prison 8 months Yes In July 1989, Patricia Stallings took her sick newborn son Ryan to the hospital for treatment, where tests revealed ethylene glycol, the main ingredient in antifreeze, in his blood. Patricia was accused of poisoning Ryan and was quickly arrested. While in jail, she gave birth to a second child, who began exhibiting the same symptoms as Ryan despite having no contact with Patricia. He was diagnosed with Methylamalonic Acidemia (MMA), a rare genetic disorder that may have explained Ryan's symptoms. However, Patricia's lawyer decided to argue that Ryan simply died of natural causes, and in January 1991, Patricia was convicted of first-degree murder and assault and sentenced to life in prison. But additional blood tests by biochemist William Sly revealed that Ryan did in fact die of MMA. Based on the new evidence, Patricia was granted a new trial, and in September 1991, the prosecution dismissed the case.[197] Jul 29, 1989 Han Tak Lee Murder, arson* Monroe County, Pennsylvania Life in prison 24 years Yes In July 1989 a fire erupted at a building at a Christian retreat camp, killing 20-year-old Ji Yun Lee. Her father, Han Tak Lee, was arrested and charged with starting the fire. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. In 2014, a judge ruled that his conviction was based on since-discredited fire evidence, and the conviction was thrown out.[198] Nov 1989 Claude Jones Murder San Jacinto County, Texas Death Executed No Store clerk Allen Hilzendager was shot dead during a robbery in November 1989. Three men - Claude Jones, Kerry Dixon, and Timothy Jordan - were arrested for involvement in the crime. Jordan testified that Jones had shot Hilzendager, but later recanted and stated that Jones was not involved in the crime and he had implicated him to avoid the death penalty. A hair found at the crime scene was said to belong to Jones, but DNA testing ten years after Jones was executed proved that it belonged to somebody else.[199] 1989 Mark Denny Sexual assault, robbery, other violent felony Manhattan, New York 19–57 years 28 years Yes[200] Date of crime Defendant(s) Crime Location Sentence Time served Legally\n\nexonerated 1990 Jeffrey Mark Deskovic Murder Peekskill, New York 15 years to life 16 years Yes Deskovic was convicted of the murder of Angela Correa on the basis of a coerced confession. He claims that during a 7-hour intensive interrogation, detectives fed him details and promised him he wouldn't go to prison if he confessed. Hair and semen samples collected did not match Deskovic, but prosecutors argued that they were from earlier consensual sex and were not related to the murder.[201] The DNA was later matched to a man who is serving time for another Westchester murder.[202] Jan 22, 1990 Laverne Pavlinac, John Sosnovske Murder Portland, Oregon Life imprisonment Four years Yes Pavlinac was in an abusive relationship with Sosnovske and, seeking to escape, made an anonymous phone call to the police in February 1990 accusing him of the abduction, rape and murder of Taunja Bennett the previous month. Pavlinac later told the police that she had seen Sosnovske standing over Bennett's body and helped him to dump the body by the Historic Columbia River Highway. She later changed her story and confessed to strangling Bennett after Sosnovske raped her. During the trial, Pavlinac recanted her statements and admitted she had made them up to escape from Sosnovske, who pled no contest to avoid the death penalty.\n\nThe year after the trial, The Oregonian received a series of letters from a serial killer giving details of eight murders, including that of Taunja Bennett. It was also revealed that during the trial, graffito in the same handwriting as the letters had been left by a person claiming to be the killer of Taunja Bennett. This person was identified in 1995 as Keith Hunter Jesperson, who was convicted of all eight of the murders he had confessed to, including Taunja Bennett's murder. Law enforcement stated they had fully corroborated Jesperson's confession, but the courts initially refused to overturn the convictions of Pavlinac and Sosnovske. Jesperson himself began writing letters to the media calling for the two to be exonerated.[203] Judge Paul Lipscomb overturned Pavlinac and Sosnovske's convictions in November 1995, declaring that their civil rights had been violated, although he condemned Pavlinac during the hearing for having framed Sosnovske in the first place.[204]\n\nNov 17, 1990 Jeff Titus Murder Kalamazoo, Michigan Two life sentences 21 years Yes Two hunters, Doug Estes and Jim Bennett, were fatally shot near Titus' property. Twelve years later, Titus was charged with their murders. Prosecutors accused Titus of killing the two because he didn't like trespassers, despite there being no physical evidence pointing to Titus being the killer. An appeal was filed in 2018, with the Innocence Clinic stating that Titus' lawyer was never informed that an investigator believed there could have been two shooters. Two years later, a file from the investigation was recovered that referred to a different suspect—serial killer Thomas Dillon, who killed five men in southeastern Ohio from 1989 to 1992. The evidence against Dillon included witnesses who identified Dillon at the scene and a car that resembled Dillon's wife's, as well as a cellmate of Dillon who told the FBI that Dillon had bragged about killing two people in the woods. Titus' lawyer had also not been informed of that file. Dillon died in 2011. In 2023, a judge threw out Titus' murder convictions and ordered his release.[205] Jan 18, 1991 Francisco \"Franky\" Carrillo Murder Los Angeles, California Life in prison 20 years Yes Carrillo was convicted of the murder of Donald Sarpy on the basis of testimony of six teenage boys who witnessed the murder. He was released after five of the six witnesses recanted; the sixth refused to testify.[206] May 23, 1991 Roy Brown Murder Cayuga, New York 25 years to life 16 years Yes Brown was convicted of the murder of Sabrina Kulakowski on January 23, 1992. Bite marks were left on Sabrina's shirt that did not match with Brown's, as Brown was missing teeth and the bite marks did not match with his missing teeth. Nonetheless, due to improper analysis, refusal of analyzing various DNA samples, and arguable incompetence, Brown was wrongly convicted of Sabrina's murder. In January 2005, correspondence between Brown and The Innocence Project began, where they requested additional DNA testing of additional saliva spots left on Sabrina's shirt. These samples did not match Brown's DNA, and were attributed to a deceased Barry Bench. Brown was not immediately released despite this, and Barry Bench's body was exhumed and compared to a DNA sample of Bench's daughter. On January 23, 2007, Brown was released from prison. On March 7, 2007, prosecution dismissed Brown's charges. Brown was awarded $2.6 million in compensation.[207] Aug 14, 1991 John Bunn Murder Brooklyn, New York 7 years to life 16 years Yes Bunn was convicted of the murder of Rolando Neischer in 1992. Bunn was one of 15 individuals whose convictions were overturned during 2013–2019 after long prison terms, in Brooklyn homicide cases involving the retired New York City Police Department detective Louis N. Scarcella.[208] Nov 1991 Dixmoor 5: Robert Taylor, Jonathan Barr, James Harden, Robert Lee Veal, and Shainne Sharp Murder Dixmoor, Illinois varied varied Yes Robert Taylor, Jonathan Barr, James Harden, Robert Lee Veal, and Shainne Sharp were convicted of the murder of Cateresa Matthews. They were between the ages of 14 and 16 at the time. Three of them confessed after high-pressure police interrogations, and all five were arrested and charged with the crime. Two pleaded guilty and testified against the others in exchange for shorter sentences. Both men have since recanted their testimony. Each received at least 80 years in prison. DNA testing on semen excluded the suspects.[209][210] A convicted sex offender has been identified as the source of the DNA, but his name has yet to be released and he has not been charged. A suit filed by the men alleges police withheld exculpatory evidence, including the DNA, from their defense teams.[211] In 2014, they reached a wrongful conviction settlement with the state of Illinois for $40 million US dollars, the largest wrongful conviction settlement in state history.[212] Nov 10, 1991 Sonia Cacy Murder, arson* Fort Stockton, Texas 99 years Five years Yes In November 1991, 76-year-old Bill Richardson was killed in a house fire in Fort Stockton, Texas. Traces of an accelerant were supposedly found on his clothes, which led prosecutors to accuse his stepdaughter Sonia Cacy, who was the only other person in the house at the time, of setting him on fire in his sleep to claim her inheritance. Scientific analysis later determined that there was no accelerant on Richardson's clothes: what was believed to be gasoline was in fact melted plastic from Richardson's mattress. Evidence suggested that the fire was likely started by Richardson dropping a lit cigarette which ignited his sheets. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles ordered Cacy's release in 1998 based on the scientific evidence, and her conviction was eventually vacated in 2016.[213] Dec 23, 1991 Cameron Todd Willingham Murder, arson* Corsicana, Texas Death penalty Executed No Willingham was convicted and executed for the death of his three children who died in a house fire. The prosecution charged that the fire was caused by arson. He has not been posthumously exonerated, but the case has gained widespread attention as a possible case of wrongful execution. A number of arson experts have decried the results of the original investigation as faulty. In June 2009, five years after Willingham's execution, the State of Texas ordered a re-examination of the case. Dr. Craig Beyler found \"a finding of arson could not be sustained\". Beyler said that key testimony from a fire marshal at Willingham's trial was \"hardly consistent with a scientific mind-set and is more characteristic of mystics or psychics\".[214][215] The Texas Forensic Science Commission was scheduled to discuss the report by Beyler at a meeting on October 2, 2009, but two days before the meeting Texas Governor Rick Perry replaced the chair of the commission and two other members. The new chair canceled the meeting, sparking accusations that Perry was interfering with the investigation and using it for his own political advantage.[216][217] In 2010, a four-person panel of the Texas Forensic Science Commission acknowledged that state and local arson investigators used \"flawed science\" in determining the blaze had been deliberately set.[218]\n\nIn 2011, a documentary film titled Incendiary: The Willingham Case was released.[219]\n\nDec 29, 1991 Ray Krone Murder Maricopa County, Arizona Death penalty, life in prison 11 years Yes Krone was twice convicted of the murder of Kim Ancona largely on the basis of bitemark analysis, a science that would later come into question. He was eventually cleared via DNA testing. Jan 31, 1992 Mark Mason Jones, Kenneth Eric Gardiner, and Dominic Brian Lucci Malice murder, firearm possession Savannah, Georgia Life in prison plus 5 years 25 years Yes Three white servicemen stationed at Fort Stewart, Jones, Gardiner, and Lucci, were convicted of the drive-by slaying of Stanley Jackson. The sole witness, James White, who is black, admitted to lying decades later, which helped start a review of the case. Prosecutors said the crime was racially motivated. The state's Supreme Court ruled that the government prosecutors improperly withheld evidence.[220][221] The Georgia legislature approved financial compensation to each of the three men.[222] Apr 6, 1992 Robert Jones Armed robbery, rape, murder New Orleans, Louisiana Life in prison 23 years Yes Jones was convicted largely on eyewitness identification, even though another man was also found guilty of the crimes and the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence. Jones' conviction was eventually overturned by the Louisiana Supreme Court, and all charges against him were subsequently dropped. Aug 17, 1992 Juan Rivera Murder Waukegan, Illinois Life in prison 20 years Yes Rivera was wrongfully convicted three times for the murder of 11-year-old Holly Staker, who was babysitting at a neighbor's house when she was raped and murdered by an intruder. Swabs were taken of a semen sample, but DNA testing was not performed at the time. Rivera was convicted on the basis of a confession that he claims was given under duress and which contained many factual inconsistencies. He was convicted twice before DNA testing was performed on the swabs taken from the crime scene. DNA testing excluded Rivera from being the source of the semen. Prosecutors decided to try him again despite the results of the DNA test, arguing that the semen sample was from consensual sex prior to the murder. He was convicted a third time.\n\nHis case was overturned a third and final time with the appellate court heavily criticizing prosecutors for arguing that Holly was sexually active without evidence and for putting so much weight on a confession obtained while Rivera, who suffered from mental illness, was in an \"acute psychotic state\" and which contained so many inaccuracies.\n\nFollowing his exoneration, his defense team sought to do further testing on shoes that the state had once sought to enter into evidence. Holly's blood was found on shoes worn by Juan. The evidence had been dropped once it was discovered that the shoes were not for sale anywhere in the US until after the murder. Genetic testing performed in 2014 found not only Holly's blood, but genetic material that matches the semen found at the crime scene. His defense team argued that the reasonable interpretation is that in an effort to plant blood on Juan's shoes, the state also planted DNA from Holly's real killer. Following this revelation, the state agreed to settle with Rivera, giving him a US$20 million settlement, which at the time was the largest wrongful conviction settlement in US history.\n\nThe source of the DNA has never been identified, but it has been linked to evidence found at another murder scene. The man convicted of that murder insists this is proof that he himself has been wrongfully convicted.\n\nSept 13-Dec 16, 1992 David Allen Jones Murder (three counts) Los Angeles, California 36 years to life Nine years Yes Between September and December 1992, four prostitutes were raped and murdered near an elementary school in southern Los Angeles. Police suspected an intellectually disabled man named David Allen Jones, who was arrested for trying to rape a prostitute near the school. He was interrogated without a lawyer until he confessed to all four murders. He later retracted his confession and serological testing showed that the killer was a different blood type, but Jones was ultimately convicted of three of the murders.
