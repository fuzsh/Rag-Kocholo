        "text": "GENERAL INFORMATION\n\nTITLE: THE MAGIC TOYSHOP\n\nAUTHOR: ANGELA CARTER\n\nPAGES: 198\n\nPUBLISHER: VINTAGE BOOKS\n\nYEAR: 1967\n\nGENRE: GENERAL FICTION\n\nCOVER TYPE: PAPER BACK\n\nBLURB FROM THE BACK COVER\n\nOne night Melanie walks through the garden in her mother’s wedding dress. The next morning her world is shattered. Forced to leave the rural home of her childhood, she is sent to London to live with relatives she has never met: gentle Aunt Margaret, mute since her wedding day; and her brothers, Francie, whose graceful music belies his clumsy nature, and the volatile Finn, who kisses Melanie in the Pleasure Garden. Brooding, over all is Uncle Philip, who loves only the puppets he creates in his workshop, which are life-sized and uncannily life-like….\n\nREVIEW\n\nI need to make two things clear from the get go:\n\nFirst of all, despite the title there is no ‘magic’ in the book. In any way, shape or form. Not the otherworldly kind anyway. I kind of hoped there would be but never mind. The title is a misnomer.\n\nSecondly, I am in love with The Magic Toyshop, painfully, completely and in an all-consuming way. I want to marry The Magic Toyshop and have its tiny, cute, book-shaped little babies.\n\nAt its core The Magic Toyshop is a coming-of-age story written in Carter’s lush style. I think of it as Carter’s version of Alice in Wonderland without the fantastical creatures.\n\nThe heroine, Melanie, is fifteen and has a younger brother and sister. Her world is torn apart when her parents are killed on holiday in America. Her parents made no provisions for the children in the event of their death so everything is sold and they’re sent to live with an Uncle they’ve never met, his wife and her two brothers.\n\nCarter’s writing is lush. Her descriptions are great and vivid. This gave The Magic Toyshop a ‘fairy-tale’ feel. The world of The Magic Toyshop was so real to me I felt I could reach into the pages and touch the world Carter created.\n\nThe Magic Toyshop is written in the third person and told from Melanie’s viewpoint. Carter takes you inside her head all the time. The effect was very powerful. I felt a deep connection to her and everything she experienced.\n\nMelanie is grief-stricken over the death of her parents. Carter does a great job at putting this across. She’s bewildered because she’s an orphan. Mrs Rundle, an elderly woman her parents hired as a house-keeper and someone she loved is no longer part of her life. She’s forced to make a new life with strangers and everything is different.\n\nThe most interesting part of The Magic Toyshop is the parts when Carter portrays Melanie trying to adjust to her new life. Her old life is over and she’ll never get it back. Her relatives live like pigs despite her uncle’s toyshop being successful. They use newspaper instead of toilet paper. There’s no hot water so she can’t wash her body or hair properly. There’s no money for books or anything personal. Uncle Philip is a foul ogre of a man. He cows his wife and beats her brothers and everyone is terrified of him.\n\nCarter does a great job at portraying Melanie’s initial horror with her new way of life and her gradual acceptance of circumstances she can’t change.\n\nThe characters in The Magic Toyshop are memorable with the exception of Melanie’s younger brother and sister. They’re little more than props, a bit like Uncle Philip’s puppets.\n\nAunt Margaret has been mute since her wedding day. She’s a frail, bird of a woman who dotes on Melanie’s baby sister and cowers in terror in the shadow of her ogre-like husband. Carter created a lot of sympathy for her. Finn and Francie are also very well drawn and memorable. Uncle Philip is great as the ogre-like, overbearing, violent villain of the story.\n\nThe Magic Toyshop deals with the theme of incest between Aunt Margaret and Francie. This is not revealed until the last chapter of the novel and Carter doesn’t leave any clues that lead up to this revelation. I was a bit shocked by this but Carter doesn’t make a big deal of it or make it the focus of the novel. It’s just something she reveals to explain Aunt Margaret’s reasons for staying with brutal Uncle Philip and the weird hostility between the brothers and the Uncle. This is revealed in a couple of paragraphs and the novel moves to its open-ended conclusion. If Carter had made this the focus of the novel or hinted at it earlier or went into a lot of detail about Francie and Aunt Margaret’s relationship I don’t think I’d have finished reading it. It would definitely have tainted by enjoyment. However, the way Carter chooses to explore this did not have a negative impact on how much I enjoyed the book.\n\nI was enchanted by everything about The Magic Toyshop.\n\nTHE OPENING LINE\n\nThe summer she was fifteen, Melanie discovered she was made of flesh and blood…\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nThe Magic Toyshop is a brilliant novel. I loved every word. I felt it was too short and wish it had gone on for another couple of hundred pages. I could easily have stayed in Melanie’s world for a little longer. I thought this was a better novel than Nights at the Circus. I also loved the cover of my copy which I got out of my local library."
