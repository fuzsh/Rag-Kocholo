Jude Cole is a rock singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist (primarily a guitarist) who has also worked as a record producer, television personality, and actor. He is best known for the 1990 single "Baby, It's Tonight", which hit the Billboard top 20, and the top-40 hit "Time for Letting Go".

He is married to Lori Pfeiffer (1993 - present), has two children and is the brother-in-law of Michelle Pfeiffer and Dedee Pfeiffer. Cole met Lori at a Rob Lowe New Year's Eve party.

When Cole arrived in Los Angeles, for a time, he lived in the guest house of Camelia Kath, wife of late Chicago frontman Terry Kath, and where at a party he met best friend and co-owner of Ironworks record label, Kiefer Sutherland.

During his early years in Los Angeles, Jude did a lot of studio work. He played bass for Del Shannon on an album produced by Tom Petty. After the sessions Jude was offered the bass player job with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, prior to Howie Epstein, but turned it down because he was happier playing guitar.
