        "text": "These hallowed halls of justice have been the setting for any number of iconic moments in the history of motion pictures, whether it’s Al Pacino declaring, “This whole court’s out of order!” in …And Justice for All or Jack Nicholson positively devouring some delectable Aaron Sorkin dialogue when he tells Tom Cruise, “You can’t handle the truth!” in A Few Good Men. Anatomy of a Murder doesn’t have individual lines or momentous scenes like these that would land the film on lists of the best movie quotes. (Although its Saul Bass-designed poster was declared the greatest of all-time by Premiere Magazine.) But there is a reason why it landed at number seven on AFI’s list of the best courtroom dramas: its authenticity.\n\nAnatomy of a Murder wasn’t the first courtroom drama, but it certainly set a high benchmark (heh) for the genre. It’s currently the 243rd highest-rated film of all time on Letterboxd (the twelfth highest-rated from Sony Pictures), and described by author and UCLA law professor Michael Asimow as “probably the finest pure trial movie ever made.” Letterboxd reviews like nickusen’s regularly point out the film’s relevance for those heading into the field, stating, “As someone who just finished their first year of law school, I was absolutely blown away. Felt like being in an extremely riveting class. There’s a reason why every lawyer is told to watch this and My Cousin Vinny.”\n\nThe son of a renowned lawyer in Austria, Otto Preminger earned himself a law degree from the University of Vienna while simultaneously studying his true passion: theater. That understanding of the ins and outs of the courtroom, along with the stage itself, fuses into Anatomy with a play-like sensibility that keeps the audience as a passive observer of this clinical orchestration of what a true court case would feel like. As Tom states, “What’s particularly remarkable about the film is that it doesn’t beat around the bush or pull the wool over our eyes at any point; rather, it takes an objective stance and openly presents the facts as they are for us to mull over.”\n\nPerhaps that air of authenticity is aided by the fact that Anatomy of a Murder is indeed based on an actual crime. Writer Wendell Mayes adapted the film’s script from the 1957 novel of the same name by John D. Voelker. Using the pen name Robert Traver, Voelker wrote the book as a recounting of a 1952 murder case in which he was the defense attorney for an army lieutenant who shot a bartender after the man had allegedly raped the lieutenant’s wife. Just like in Anatomy, the lieutenant pled not guilty by reason of temporary insanity, with a psychiatrist testifying that he suffered an “irresistible impulse”, a phrase that is put under much scrutiny in the movie. Even minute details, such as a specific letter delivered at the very end of Anatomy, were pulled from Voelker’s true experience. That attention to the real world plays a significant part in the enduring resonance of Preminger’s work.\n\nIf the title Anatomy of a Murder has been ringing familiar, fresh on the heels of the 2023–2024 Oscar season, you’re likely not alone. Anatomy of a Fall filmmaker Justine Triet has described her Palme d’Or and Oscar winner as “an homage to Preminger’s film”, telling Variety days after her picture’s Cannes premiere that “I’ve seen it so many times and it’s a film that has strangely haunted me for the last ten years.” Both Anatomies feature on Laura’s list “fragility of language”, highlighting “movies that involve miscommunication, feelings that get muddled in translation, or language that is analyzed and used to defend or harm.” Sounds like a bunch of lawyers to me!\n\nOne distinction between Triet’s Anatomy and Preminger’s is that the latter really takes its time before bringing us into the courtroom. The first hour of Murder follows James “Jimmy” Stewart’s defense attorney Paul Biegler as he meticulously puts together the pieces of what will be his case. As cinemaclown explains, “Anatomy of a Murder is an interesting observation of the research that goes into the preparation of a case, especially from the defence point of view, and also highlights some of the loopholes present in the judiciary system that may be taken advantage of by the lawyers to alter the jury’s final decision.” The American Bar Association selected Anatomy as the sixth-best trial movie ever made, singling out “the film’s ability to demonstrate how a legal defense is developed in a difficult case. How many trial films would dare spend so much time watching lawyers do what many lawyers do most (and enjoy least) – research?”\n\nDealing with what’s described in the film as “the natural impurities of the law”, the opening hour provides an immediate understanding of how Preminger and company are going to show us the ways that lawyers and their ilk mold and bend morality to win a case, erring just on the side of breaking the rules. We watch as Biegler coaches Frederick Manion towards his “irresistible impulse” defense, needling the lieutenant to come up with the right words without explicitly telling him that the only way to potentially get out of this is to say he was temporarily insane. Meanwhile, the coaching becomes tenfold with Manion’s wife, Laura. After observing her flirtatious behavior (including with him) and manner of dressing that could be seen as provocative by a jury, Biegler instructs the woman, “You’re gonna be a meek little housewife with horn-rimmed spectacles, and you’re gonna stay away from men and juke joints and booze and pinball machines, and you’re gonna wear a skirt and low-heeled shoes, and you’re gonna wear a girdle. Especially a girdle… save that jiggle for your husband to look at if and when I get him out of jail.”\n\nThis sinewy relationship with morality is part and parcel with this stage of James Stewart’s career, where he toyed with the dark side in a way that directly pushed against his wholesome image fostered by films like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and The Shop Around the Corner. Returning from World War II with psychological scars and plenty of military accolades, Stewart delved into moral rot with characters looking for redemption in the westerns of Anthony Mann and the many objectionable men he played for Alfred Hitchcock. Anatomy of a Murder fits this mold, as The Sweet East writer Nick Pinkerton describes in his essay for The Criterion Collection’s release of Anatomy how “the actor’s warbly candor is here a mask to be taken off and put back on at will—in any scene, much of the pleasure comes from gauging the distance between the line Biegler is giving and what he’s actually thinking, the degree to which his courtroom outbursts are actual eruptions or kabuki distractions meant to provide some room to strategize.”\n\nAnatomy of a Murder was nominated for seven Academy Awards, among them a Best Leading Actor nod for Stewart (the final nomination of his career) and Best Supporting Actor for his courtroom adversary, George C. Scott. The first nomination in the future Oscar winner Scott’s career (back before he called the ceremony a “meat parade” and began refusing his accolades), Anatomy was only the actor’s second appearance in a feature film period, and he comes in swinging like a bat out of hell, with Meyoan noting “a courtroom cannot be more exciting than seeing James Stewart and George C. Scott disrupt and bump heads with each other.”\n\nOut of the many disruptions presented throughout the trial are frank discussions on the specifics of language, one of the most defining and surprising elements of Anatomy of a Murder. Despite taking place within the era of Hollywood’s restrictive Hays Code, Preminger’s film broaches taboo conversations around sexual assault and victim-blaming, with Variety even stating that this was the first time in any American film with the Production Code seal that words like “contraceptive”, (sexual) “climax” and “spermatogenesis” were spoken. Rumor has it that even James Stewart’s own father was offended by the language contained in the film, going so far as to take an ad out in the local newspaper encouraging people not to see it. In the most popular review of Anatomy of a Murder on Letterboxd, liam writes, “there are fewer things more surreal than hearing someone say the word ‘bitch’ in a Hollywood film from 1959.” And if you think that’s alarming, just wait until you reach the scene where Dancer asks Laura on the witness stand if she often goes out without wearing any panties. Zoë brings a deeper analysis to this aspect of the film, reflecting that “the way the story handles rape felt much more like [an] exposé of rape culture in the justice system.”\n\nIf that’s not enough to convince you that Preminger, who fled his homeland of Bukovina with his Jewish family when the region was invaded by Russia during World War I, wasn’t putting up with any of this fascistic nonsense, consider who he hired to play Anatomy of a Murder’s judge: Joseph N. Welch. A real-life judge who had never worked as an actor (and would never act after this), Welch became a household name as counsel for the US Army during the Army-McCarthy hearings. Welch famously stood up to McCarthy and his aide Roy Cohn during the hearings, stating, “Senator. You’ve done enough. Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?” This moment is often cited as a turning point in the fall of McCarthyism—and Preminger had the guts to go ahead and hire Welch to act in his film, specifically playing a character who acts as the ultimate arbiter of decency. They really don’t make ’em like Preminger anymore, and who knows where cinema would be without him, and without Anatomy of a Murder."
