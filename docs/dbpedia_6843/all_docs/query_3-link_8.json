        "text": "Film noir is generally seen as a post-war innovation, mirroring the more jaded, cynical outlook that the world possessed after the cataclysmic conflict. Mr Raymond Chandler would have every right to disagree. In 1944, not only did he co-script what for me is one of the finest (and noirest) films ever made, Double Indemnity, but he also provided the source material (the novel Farewell, My Lovely) for this marvellous movie from the perennially underrated Edward Dmytryk.\n\nDick Powell transformed his frothy image in one fell swoop by personifying private detective Philip Marlowe so well and delivering Chandler's hard-boiled lines (via John Paxton's sharp script) as though born to them. We are introduced to him blindfold and under interrogation for multiple…\n\nMoose is a wonderful character. Almost comical, but wholly tragic, a man of few words, but a lot of muscles. I have mentioned my feelings on the femme fatale trope before, The fact that this big dumb lug is played by a woman falls into so many awful stereotypes, but there's just something likable about the hulking murderer. He, like certain goons from Blazing Saddles, is a mere pawn, and maybe that's why I have sympathy for him.\n\nThis is a great Philip Marlowe story. A twisty plot that's not too twisted. A lot of quippy dialogue that doesn't feel forced or out-of-character for anyone. And a seediness to it that isn't quite as seedy as it should be, unfortunately,…\n\nIf the human condition is to suffer with a smile, Phillip Marlowe throws his own tipped hat into the ring as the one who could lace his downfall with cracks so wise in their purple-tongued self-flagellation, that they would accidentally expose harsh truths born in the recesses of society no-one else would dare stick their nose into.\n\nThe choice to maintain Marlowe’s inner monologue throughout is an ingenious one if not entirely indispensable to the murky depths to plug at the fore, with Chandler’s sly manifestation of the loneliness of everyone’s favourite gumshoe arriving more crystal clear than ever; depicting the job of the lowly PI as one of ugly necessity for the man who can see but no other…\n\nRaymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe is a poet. He’s a sardonic dreamer, a man out of time who falls in love at the drop of a hat, shaping characters from the people he meets and attaching himself to them — however briefly — as a sort of indulgence; as a way of standing up to the harsh, brutal reality of the world in which he lives.\n\nIn Edward Dmytryk’s hands, Marlowe’s poetry morphs into surrealism, and there’s a doubling back of POVs, as we see Marlowe through his own eyes. In Dmytryk’s hands, Marlowe’s fog becomes our fog; Marlowe’s looping, questing dreams becomes our dreams.\n\nMurder, My Sweet is a fascinating translation of Chandler, one that proved enormously effective as a…\n\nDick Powell made for a better Philip Marlowe than expected; he wasn’t the best I’ve seen, but Powell was the first to play that iconic character on screen. As I needed more variety & it’s been months since a film noir has been experienced, the DVR was used from a TCM recording made last month. People will know this story as Farewell, My Lovely (and the famed Robert Mitchum movie from the 70’s), which I haven’t seen so a compare & contrast can’t be done. The name was changed-at least in the United States-as… RKO thought people would think of this as another Dick Powell musical like the Busby Berkeley musicals from the 30’s I know him best from. No, really.\n\nIt's…\n\nThoroughly satisfying film noir based on a novel by the great Raymond Chandler. The film is a trimmed down version of the book (if memory serves) but it's still plenty complicated enough - luckily there's a hard boiled voice-over that kicks in every now and again to keep you abreast of the latest developments. The plot focuses on gumshoe Philip Marlowe, who finds himself on the trail of a broad and a stolen necklace. The plot moves quickly and is plenty of fun - always just slightly the right side of weird and thoroughly charming with it. Dick Powell might not be exactly what you would imagine wisecracking detective Marlowe to be after reading the books, but he certainly makes…\n\nThe icon of the film noir genre is back again on another feature, and is a twisty as you may expect.\n\nThis time played by Dick Powell, who does a nice job though never reaches the highs of the man who gave a face and a voice to the character, Humphrey Bogart.\n\nThe script is very good. There are some really catchy dialogue and some nice moments, also it goes for a much detective vibe (in Spanish translates to A Detective Story), though it still has some of the elements of the genre, especially the femme Fatale.\n\nAll in all, a very generic hybrid of film noir and thriller that may not blow your mind, but it worth a watch just for the sake of having a good time.\n\nClassic film noir. First film outing for Raymond Chandler's private detective Philip Marlowe, superbly played by Dick Powell in a role that transformed his career.\n\nAdapted from Chandler's 'Farewell, My Lovely', the title was changed apparently because test audiences thought it suggested a Dick Powell musical. Although its original title remained in the UK.\n\nThe typically convoluted plot is slightly easier to follow than 'The Big Sleep' but it's not as important as the quick-fire dialogue or the characters or the atmosphere. Claire Trevor is a fine femme fatale.\n\nWatched on YouTube.\n\nSince they were first theorized by astronomical pioneer and English clergyman John Michell (in a letter published in November 1784), scientists have struggled to describe, in layman’s terms, the complex behavior of black holes, with the current and most widely accepted analogy being a comparison to the laws of thermodynamics - i.e., relating mass to energy, area to entropy, and surface gravity to temperature - and the application of quantum field theory to imply that black holes should radiate like a black body with a temperature proportional to their surface gravity.\n\nAs usual, the eggheads have overthought this concept to death. You wanna understand black holes? It’s simple:\n\nJust think of that thing Dick Powell does with charisma.\n\nThere ya go. You’ve got it."
