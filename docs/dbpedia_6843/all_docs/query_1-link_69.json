        "text": "Released: 1944\n\nCast: Dick Powell, Claire Trevor, Anne Shirley, Otto Kruger, Mike Mazurki, Miles Mander, Douglas Walton\n\nSUMMARY: Private detective Philip Marlowe (Dick Powell) is sitting in a police station with his eyes bandaged, being questioned about his connection to two recent murders. In flashback, Marlowe recounts his knowledge of the crimes. His story starts when he was hired by mobster Moose Malloy (Mike Mazurki), who wanted Marlowe to locate an old girlfriend named Velma Valento. Malloy has not seen Velma in eight years (he was in prison), so he and Marlowe go to the last place where he saw her – the nightclub where she worked as a singer. Unfortunately, the entire staff, including ownership, of the club has changed. Marlowe does find the previous owner’s widow, and goes to her house to ask about Velma. The woman tells Marlowe that she doesn’t know what happened to Velma, but then is caught trying to hide a photo of her from Marlowe. When pushed, the woman tells Marlowe that Velma is dead. He takes the photo and leaves, but through a window sees the woman making a frantic phone call. The next day, Marlowe is approached by Lindsay Marriott (Douglas Walton), who wants Marlowe to act as a bodyguard for a ransom exchange. Marriott is trying to buy back some jewels that belong to a female friend of his, and wants Marlowe to go along for protection. Marlowe agrees, but when the two men arrive at the rendezvous point, Marlowe is attacked and bashed over the head. He wakes up when a young woman shines a flashlight in his face and asks if he’s okay; when he assures her that he is, the young woman flees. Still woozy, Marlowe returns to the car to discover that Marriott has also been hit upside the head – enough times to kill him. The money that the two men brought with them to pay for the jewels is gone. Marlowe goes to the police, who let slip that they are looking into a man named Jules Amthor. Before he can investigate the man, a female reporter comes into Marlowe’s office asking about the case. He sees through her claims, and forces her to admit that she isn’t a reporter, but is connected the stolen jewels. Her name is Ann Grayle (Anne Shirley); the stolen necklace, made of valuable jade, belonged to her father. Ann then takes Marlowe to her father’s house, where he learns more about the theft.\n\nAnn’s father, Mr. Grayle (Miles Mander), a wealthy jade collector, lives with his much-younger second wife, Helen (Claire Trevor). Helen was wearing the necklace, worth over $100,000, while she was out dancing with Marriott; when he learned of the theft, Marriott offered to act as the go-between for Grayle, who gave him the ransom money. As Marlowe is preparing to leave, the mysterious Jules Amthor shows up at the house. Marlowe learns that the man professes to be a psychic healer, and has treated both Helen and Marriott. Helen hires Marlowe to find the still-missing necklace, but at a nightclub one evening, Ann offers him more money to stay out of the situation. Moose Malloy then reappears, and takes Marlowe to see Amthor. Marlowe accuses the two men of acting together to steal the jade from Helen, but when things went awry, Amthor used Malloy to clean up the mess. Without confirming or denying this, Amthor has Marlowe drugged and kept for several days in a private clinic, hoping that he will reveal the location of the jade. Since he doesn’t have the necklace, Marlowe doesn’t reveal anything, and eventually escapes. He goes to Ann’s house, and when she enquires about his health, he realizes that she was the one who found him after Marriott’s murder. He also learns that the police are interested in Mr. Grayle’s beach house, where Marriott had been living, so he and Ann head there immediately. They find Helen hiding in the house, and Marlowe starts to put the pieces together. He realizes that Helen thought he had the jade, and essentially handed him over to Amthor; Ann was trying to stop this. Helen then tells Marlowe that Amthor is blackmailing her: during her sessions with him, Amthor learned some unflattering secrets about Helen’s past, and threatened to reveal them to Mr. Grayle. He wants the necklace in return for keeping the secret, but the necklace is missing. Helen has decided that the only way to truly get rid of Amthor is to kill him, and wants Marlowe to help her lure Amthor to the beach house. Marlowe agrees to this, but before the plot can begin, he finds Amthor dead, killed by Moose Malloy. Back at his office, Marlowe finds Moose waiting for him, demanding to see Velma. Marlowe realizes that the picture of Velma he has (retrieved from the widow of the club owner) is a fake, designed to send him on a false trail; he then tells Moose to return the next night, and promises to take him to Velma. The next evening, both men go to the beach house, where Marlowe has Moose wait outside until he gives a signal. Inside, he confronts Helen, whom he now knows to be Velma, about what really happened to the necklace. Helen reveals that when she heard Marlowe was looking for her (from the club owner’s widow), she got nervous. To get close to Marlowe, she faked the entire robbery and ransom; when he went to the exchange with Marriott (whom Helen really was seeing on the sly), she killed Marriott and was ready to kill Marlowe when Ann appeared. Ann was there because she knew that Helen was seeing Marriott, and thought that Mr. Grayle might get jealous and try to harm Marriott. Back in the beach house, Helen draws a gun on Marlowe, but suddenly Ann and Mr. Grayle burst in. Though Grayle appears to side with Helen, he suddenly shoots her and kills her. Moose hears the noise and bursts in, then tries to attack Grayle. As Marlowe lunges toward the pair, Grayle fires again, right in front of Marlowe’s eyes. Marlowe is blinded and knocked unconscious, and winds up in the police station, ending the flashback. The detectives tell Marlowe that in the struggle, both Moose and Grayle were killed. One of the men then takes Marlowe outside to a cab as he discusses his attraction to Ann. Unbeknownst to him, Ann was in the police station with him, and is now following behind. She slips into the cab with him, and when Marlowe recognizes her perfume, she kisses him.\n\nMY TAKE: This is a good mystery, but it’s confusing. To start with, there’s a few too many characters, and a bunch of their names start with M – Marlowe, (Moose) Malloy, Marriott – which makes it hard to keep track of them. It seems like there’s two separate mysteries, but they’re ultimately connected: the missing person half is pretty simple (though Marlowe doesn’t spend much time on it), but the missing necklace part is really convoluted. Even at the end, I wasn’t sure what had happened, except that Helen was responsible. After a day of reflection and several readings of the Wikipedia summary, here’s what I think happened: Helen had been a nightclub singer with a less-than-stellar reputation/past, who was engaged to Moose Malloy. When Moose went to jail, Helen moved on. She eventually married Mr. Grayle, who was wealthy and in love with her. Helen was fond of him, but liked to go out with other men: however, she was unwilling to divorce Grayle and give up her comfortable lifestyle. When Marlowe started looking for her, Helen thought he would disrupt this life, and decided to get rid of him. She faked a robbery/ransom situation in order to hire him, along with current boyfriend Marriott. She managed to off Marriott, who could have implicated her, but failed to kill Marlowe. I’m not really sure how Amthor figures in, but when Moose found out that the man had double-crossed him, he strangled him. Marlowe then pieced things together, and took Malloy to the beach house. I also don’t know why Helen cooked up such an elaborate and complicated story to draw Marlowe in – couldn’t she have just told him the necklace was stolen? Maybe she wanted to get rid of Amthor, who probably really did know her secrets. I don’t know. It’s kind of a frustrating movie, because while Marlowe manages to figure things out, his deductions are not revealed to the viewer. This adds to the tension, but leaves you completely in the dark until the very end, when the solution ends up being rather muddled."
