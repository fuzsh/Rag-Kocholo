        "text": "This great 1940s production starred Dick Powell as Phillip Marlowe, the hard-boiled private detective \"antihero\" made famous by author Raymond Chandler's crime novels. Before this film, Powell was known as a \"song and dance man,\" having starred in many of the early Warner Brothers musicals. His career was in serious decline when director Ed Dmytryk took a chance and cast him in the lead as the famed detective. The studio wasn't so sure the director had made a wise decision. They even renamed the movie from its original title, Farewell My Lovely, because they were afraid the public might think it was another Powell musical. What was produced is considered to be one of the great early landmark movies of the film noir genre.\n\nYear: 1944\n\nNationality: United States\n\nCondition: Linen-Backed\n\nType: Original One Sheet\n\nSize: 27 X 41 Inches\n\nPoduct Code: P1560"
