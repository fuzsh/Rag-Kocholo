        "text": "Film Noir, a term coined by the French to describe a style of film characterized by dark themes, storylines, and visuals, has been influencing cinematic industries since the 1940’s. With roots in German expressionistic films and Italian postwar documentaries, film noir has made its way into American film as well, particularly identified in mob and crime pictures. However, such settings are not exclusive to American film noir. One noteworthy example is Billy Wilder’s film Sunset Boulevard, which follows the foreboding tale of Joe Gillis, the desperate-for-success protagonist, who finds himself in the fatal grips of the disillusioned femme fatale Norma Desmond. Not only does the storyline’s heavy subject matter and typical character\n\n“Reality is easy. Deception that's the hard the hard work” -Lauryn Hill. In the novel the Scarlet Letter, Nathaniel Hawthorne uses literary elements such as symbolism, irony and conflict to show deception and secrecy can lead to self-destruction. This relates to the Scarlet Letter because in the book the protagonist character commits an act of sin that was more than just frowned upon. Not only does the community gossip and turn their cheek to the sinner but a sickness comes along from keeping a secret from the community.\n\nThese three brides represent the femme fatale, the fatal woman. The over sexualised women whose charms ensnare her lovers in bonds of irresistible desire, often leading them into compromising, dangerous, and deadly situations. These women serve as monstrous reminders of what happens if the boundaries of proper behaviour and traditional gender roles are crossed. These women, although beautiful, possess the wrong type of beauty, one of which brands them as evil, openly sexual and seductive women. Who, in addition lack the chaste passivity and fragility of the ideal Victorian lady, thus making them deserving of some form of punishment in order for them to be returned to their pure, innocent, albeit dead, human form.\n\nSecondly, throughout this film, Chris suffers from multiple inner conflicts he believes he can easily manage, but this sparks the beginning of his severe agony, further representing a Shakespearean tragedy. An instance of this scenario where Chris’s inner conflict torments him severely, is when Nola surprises him with the fact that she is pregnant and how she repeatedly wants him to visit her. Thus, the importance behind this vulnerable moment in Chris’s life, is that he fears upon the idea than he can lose everything in a flash, if Nola tells Chloe the truth. Not only does his fear of loss sets him back from regaining his conscious, but he struggles to find an ethical way to release his misery and torment. Another example, is when Chloe asks Chris if he is having an affair,\n\nNoir is a genre of hard-boiled crime dramas, which originated in America in the 1930s and 1940s, during and post WWII. The films and novels that were associated with this genre reflected how the world was viewed during and after the war⎯cold, heartless and cruel. A noir anti-hero is the main character of a story that lacks the characteristics of a typical hero, but is relatable to the audience. He usually functions outside social norms and challenges the system. Hardboiled detective is a tough, cynical style of writing that brought an aspect of realism to the genre of detective fiction. It is often a gritty detective story set in a world overrun with violence and corruption. The way that Cain describes depression-era Los Angeles is a reflection of society during that time period. The anti-hero is morally compelling\n\nFilm Noir was extremely trendy during the 1940’s. People were captivated by the way it expresses a mood of disillusionment and indistinctness between good and evil. Film Noir have key elements; crime, mystery, an anti-hero, femme fatale, and chiaroscuro lighting and camera angles. The Maltese Falcon is an example of film noir because of the usage of camera angles, lighting and ominous settings, as well as sinister characters as Samuel Spade, the anti-hero on a quest for meaning, who encounters the death of his partner but does not show any signs of remorse but instead for his greed for riches.\n\nIt not only threatens, but also breaks through. Betrayed by love once in her life, she nevertheless seeks it in the effort to fill the lonely void; thus, her promiscuity. But to adhere to her tradition and her sense of herself as a lady, she cannot face this sensual part of herself. She associates it with the animalism of Stanley's lovemaking and terms it “brutal desire”. She feels guilt and a sense of sin when she does surrender to it, and yet she does, out of intense loneliness. By viewing sensuality as brutal desire she is able to disassociate it from what she feels is her true self, but only at the price of an intense inner conflict. Since she cannot integrate these conflicting elements of desire and gentility, she tries to reject the one, desire, and live solely by the other. Desperately seeking a haven she looks increasingly to fantasy. Taking refuge in tinsel, fine clothes, and rhinestones, and the illusion that a beau is available whenever she wants him, she seeks tenderness and beauty in a world of her own making.\n\nKleeman writes the main character to seem some sort of dark character because of all of the resources the woman uses trying to get out of her dark thoughts of how she’s alone and has no one and reminiscing in the past of her loved one. Not to mention how she claims to lose sight of the memories she’s held onto all this time of them even at the beginning of the story, tries to connect with the audience by using a loss of a pet to describe how she feels now that it is no longer there. Going back to symbolism the cat that she mentions in the first part of the short story is a symbol to not only help connect to the audience but create the feeling and the atmosphere to portray her feeling towards her situation with her abandoned life. The woman also states how the world was fading and “unthinking itself” and that in itself could be quite confusing but Kleeman is making the woman describe the world to be disappearing faster than anyone can imagine (Kleeman) and in reality it’s just the woman that is “withdrawing from life” (Gregory). The woman is stating how she’s just standing outside her loved ones house calling for him even though she knows no one will answer, almost like something from a movie.\n\nFilm noir is a style of filmmaking that began after World War 2, and it focused on darker themes and settings. Most commonly, this style of film is set in a city with rampant crime and corruption, with the characters and protagonist being morally ambiguous. Other important elements of movies made in this style are the unusual shot types, lighting, and framing which were designed to unsettle the viewer and give them a sense of instability. Other elements are also common between these films, such as general themes and character archetypes, but overall the message that these films were made to convey is one of cynicism and darkness in a setting familiar to many people."
