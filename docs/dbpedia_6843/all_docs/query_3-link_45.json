Dick Powell stars as novelist Raymond Chandler's hard-bitten, world-weary private detective, Philip Marlowe. Marlowe takes a job looking for Moose Malloy's (Mike Mazurki) girlfriend Velma. Malloy's a petty criminal just released after a seven-year prison sentence, and Velma has not been seen for six years. But a simple missing-person case becomes much more twisted than Marlowe ever anticipated as initially promising clues lead to a complex web of deceit, bribery, perjury and theft, in which no one's motivation is clear...least of all Marlowe's. Based on the novel Farewell, My Lovely by Raymond Chandler.",

        "text": "It enjoys dark atmospheres and the presence of Dick Powell as the cynical detective, but its irregular rhythm leads it through predictable areas that take away the impact hook of the mystery about necklace, suspicion and murder. [Full review in Spanish]\n\nJuly 2, 2024\n\nThe dialogue is the most interesting and unique aspect of this tough-as-nails thriller: film noir talk is like a language all its own.\n\nAugust 13, 2020\n\nMurder, My Sweet (1944) was to be released with the original title of its literary source, writer Raymond Chandler's 1940 novel Farewell, My Lovely, although it was changed so that fans of 30s song-and-dance star Dick Powell...\n\nSeptember 29, 2019\n\nTreats us to some savory snatches of dialogue in the best noir tradition.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\nFrom its strongly accented camera angles and darkness-drenched nighttime action to the hardboiled narration of a cynical Los Angeles gumshoe outfitted in trenchcoat and fedora, Murder, My Sweet is pure Detective Noir 101.\n\nJune 21, 2017\n\nPowell is glib and great in one of the best hard boilers ever.\n\nJune 21, 2017"
