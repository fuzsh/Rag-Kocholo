        "text": "Based on the 1940 novel written by Raymond Chandler, Murder, My Sweet is a classic film noir, directed by Edward Dmytryk and starring Dick Powell (Philip Marlowe), Claire Trevor (Helen) and Anne Shirley (Ann Grayle). It was first screened on December 18, 1944 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Known for its remarkable faithfulness to the book source, Murder, My Sweet deals with blackmail, murderers, drugs and more, reflecting the corruption in society around that time. Murder, My Sweet sets a solid example with its narrative and cinematographic techniques that soon evolves into the emerging film noir style, as seen in the numerous mystery films that followed with core elements from Murder, My Sweet.\n\nThe film starts off in the police station, as the cynical private-eye Phillip Marlowe (who was temporarily blinded by the bullet) retells the escalating events that has led to the multiple murders.

Overall, Murder, My Sweet was a very thrilling experience for an animation film-orientated viewer such as myself, and I would recommend it"
