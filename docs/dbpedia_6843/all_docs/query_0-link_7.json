        "text": "Magazine editor turned screenwriter who became a producer with RKO in 1943. Scott was responsible for such films as the Raymond Chandler adaptation, \"Murder, My Sweet\" (1944; from \"Farewell My Lovely\"), and the biting indictment of anti-Semitism, \"Crossfire\" (1947). His career was ended when he refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 and he served a year in prison as one of the \"Hollywood Ten.\" His fate was sealed by the damning testimony of Edward Dmytryk, who directed the majority of Scott's films."
