He was 61 years old and recently had undergone surgery for cancer.\n\nMr. Scott, who was born in Arlington, N. J., and was grad uated from Amherst College, came to California in 1939. His film credits included “Murder, My Sweet,” “The Boy With the Green Hair” and “Crossfire.”\n\nOn his release from prison in 1951, he became executive producer for a London film studio. He returned to this country in 1968, to write tele vision scripts and produce films for Universal‐International Studios.\n\nAfter being divorced twice, Mr. Scott in 1955 married Joan LaCour, a film and television writer, who survives him."
