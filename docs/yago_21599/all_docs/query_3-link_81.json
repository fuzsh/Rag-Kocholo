        "text": "From May 23-28, 1939, Norway's Crown Prince Olav (1903-1991) and his wife, Princess Martha (1901-1954), visited Washington State during a West Coast tour on the eve of World War II. Among other activities, they spent a day skiing at Paradise on Mount Rainier and attended the dedication of the Stanwood monument honoring the first Norwegian settler on Puget Sound, Zakarias Martin Taftezon (1821-1901). The royal couple also attended a program held at the Civic Auditorium that featured the Norwegian Male Chorus, conducted by University of Washington School of Music professor August Hansen Werner (1893-1980). The program pictured here is from the crown prince's luncheon with the Seattle Chamber of Commerce and the Norwegian Commercial Club. Prince Olav was a much-loved symbol of national unity for Norwegians, even after the Royal Family was forced to flee Norway when it was bombed by Germany. Throughout WWII the crown prince made other trips to the U. S. as envoy in exile, returning to Seattle in 1942 to discuss Norway's position as a country occupied by German troops. The prince became King Olav V in 1957 and again visited Seattle in 1968 and 1975. Caption information source: \"Norway's Crown Prince Olav skis at Mount Rainier on May 24, 1939,\" by John W. Lundin, HistoryLink.org Essay 10974. Caption information source: \"Norwegian Royal Party Visits in State,\" The Seattle Daily Times, May 23, 1939, p. 7."
