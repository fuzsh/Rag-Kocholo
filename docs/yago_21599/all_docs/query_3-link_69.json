        "text": "Following the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, King Haakon, his son Crown Prince Olav, daughter-in-law Swedish-born Crown Princess Märtha and three grandchildren (Ragnhild, Astrid and Harald) journeyed northwards by train, accompanied by members of the government, from Oslo’s Østbanen Station to Hamar in an attempt to evade capture. By the early evening, the royals had settled at an estate at Sælid, a few kilometres outside of Hamar, where they were just sitting down to dinner when word was received from the local police chief of the impending arrival of several busloads of German troops. The little group immediately set out by car towards Elverum, to rendezvous with members of the government who had fled there from Hamar, arriving at 10.30pm. However, the news there was equally uncertain and it was at this juncture that a decision was taken to send the Swedish-born Crown Princess Märtha and her three children over the border into neutral Sweden for reasons of safety. A royal convoy of three cars crossed the border into Sweden from Trysil, in the early hours of 10 April, and proceeded to the Høyfjellshotell in the ski resort of Sälen. As it was a glorious sunny day, the children spent most of the time skiing on the nearby slopes, while their mother remained at the hotel glued to the radio for news of events in neighbouring Norway. What she heard could hardly have lifted her spirits, as the Germans were now bombing Eleverum and Nybergsund, killing dozens of people. At one stage, King Haakon and his son Olav are forced to take shelter in a ditch to avoid being fired on by low-flying Heinkel bombers.\n\nCrown Princess Märtha’s mother, Princess Ingeborg of Sweden, arrived at Sälen a few days later, visibly tired yet ‘filled with a glowing hatred of the Germans’, according to one of the Norwegian royal party, for her homeland of Denmark had also recently been occupied. Ingeborg was also deeply concerned for the welfare of her brother, King Haakon and her son-in-law (and nephew) Olav. Meanwhile, the Swedish authorities were nervous of the Norwegian royalty remaining so close to the border area. As a result, the royals and their entourage sneaked out of the hotel in the middle of the night, on 18 April, and headed south by car (which almost upturned in a snow drift) towards Uppsala where, thanks to Princess Ingeborg’s efforts, they were able to take up temporary residence at Count Carl Bernadotte of Wisborg’s home at Rasbo.\n\nMeanwhile, King Gustav-viewed by many as pro-Nazi or at least pro-German, had refused a plea from King Haakon and Crown Prince Olav to briefly cross the border at Lillo into Sweden for fear of provoking Hitler, bluntly sending a message through his Foreign Minister, Christian Günther, “If you cross the border, you will be detained.” Nevertheless, after about two weeks, King Gustav, who was Crown Princess Märtha’s paternal uncle, decided to offer his niece and her party accommodation at Ulriksdal Palace, on the outskirts of Stockholm. Although at dinner on the first evening, ‘everyone was terribly kind and friendly’, there was no discussion of the increasingly perilous situation in Norway, where King Haakon and Crown Prince Olav remained in constant danger from a crack unit of German commandos’ intent on their capture or possibly death. Yet, Olav’s chief concern was for the safety of his children and wife in Sweden and he wrote to President Franklin D Roosevelt from Trangen, Langvatnet, on 10 May, mentioning an offer which Roosevelt had made, in late April 1939, during the Crown Prince and Princess’ weekend stay at the President’s country home at Hyde Park, ‘to take care of the children’ if the war should reach Norwegian shores.\n\nMärtha, meanwhile, spent time playing rummy and bridge each evening after dinner while the children and their nurse played games of tennis, swam in a nearby inlet or went picnicking. However, below the minutiae of everyday Palace life, the Crown Princess was increasingly anxious about the future, for her sole communication with her husband was via courier and, as he was constantly on the move, this was sporadic at best. This left her in a very vulnerable position and soon Märtha was subjected to considerable political pressure from the Administrative Council in Oslo, an interim body appointed by the Norwegian Supreme Court to deal with matters of civil administration, which indicated that they wanted the Crown Princess and Prince Harald to return to Norway and cooperate with the occupying power in order to save the monarchy for Hitler was now inclined to depose the Royal House. The timing of this political intervention was no accident for, as the Germans were only too well aware, the Norwegian King was no longer in Norway as, following the decision of the Allied powers to withdraw from Norway, he and his son Olav had departed Norwegian soil at Tromsø, on 7 June, to settle temporarily in England and carry on the fight for Norwegian democracy there. Furthermore, the powers that be in Berlin had appointed Josef Terboven as Reichskommissar in Norway. With hostilities in occupied Norway now at end, Terboven was currently involved on negotiations with members of the Storting’s Presidium on formulating a future political solution for Norway.\n\nThe Swedes now became involved in the discussions over the future of the Norwegian monarchy. In a telegram to Hitler on June 16, the Swedish King, who had newly learned of Hitler’s desire to ‘depose’ the Norwegian Royal House, encouraged the Germans to adopt a ‘Norwegian Regency’ model whereby three-year-old Harald would be proclaimed king, although his mother would act as regent until the Prince reached his majority. Märtha was clearly aware of the situation and sent a telegram to London on 24 June warning her husband and father-in-law that her Swedish family (i.e. King Gustav) and Hitler were conspiring to remove King Haakon and set up a regency. King Haakon now come to the view that his Swedish counterpart was a ‘treacherous piece of a Nazi sympathiser.’ Some commentators have noted that Gustav may actually have been trying to save the monarchy in Norway by his intervention, feeling that if the matter was not resolved soon Germany would insist on the royal house being deposed. At least under the regency proposal this would allow the monarchy to endure-albeit under German control. Certainly, with the Germans sweeping through Europe (by late June they had conquered France) those undertaking negotiations with the occupiers may well have taken the view that Germany might now win the war.\n\nMeanwhile, there was now the very real danger that Prince Harald might be kidnapped and taken to Oslo. This must have crossed the mind of Crown Prince Olav for, on 22 June, he had written again to President Roosevelt from Buckingham Palace pressing him to make good on his offer of sanctuary to his children, but this time he also included a request on behalf of his wife. Olav also made an approach to the US Secretary of State via the US Ambassador in London, Joseph Kennedy, entreating ‘if there is anything you can do in a hurry to get the [Crown] Princess out [of Sweden].’ On 12 July, the US Secretary of State sent a message to the US Minister in Stockholm saying that President Roosevelt was arranging for a naval transport vessel to be sent to Finland to evacuate the Crown Princess and her family, along with a group of ‘stranded’ US citizens. Both the German and British governments had agreed to grant the ship safe passage.\n\nAccording to the US Minister in Stockholm, the Norwegian politicians were now trying to reach a satisfactory agreement with the German occupying authorities, whilst also being careful to avoid upsetting the local population. The Regency option might well have been an attempt at sweetening the pill of removing King Haakon from his throne, for that certainly seemed to be the way the wind was blowing. For instance, Aftonbladet newspaper, which was admittedly operating under German censorship rules stated that ‘The King and government … have left us in the lurch; we must now try to manage without them.’ Finally, on 27 June the Presidium of the Storting agreed to formally ask the King to abdicate. Josef Terboven had proposed to establish a National Council, to be chosen by the Storting and be a collaborative body for the occupiers. However, the arrangement assumed that the King abdicated. On 8 July, the King announced his rejection of the abdication request via a BBC radio broadcast from London. What would this mean going forward?\n\nOn 18 July, Märtha received a telephone call from the Norwegian Minister in Washington, Wilhelm Thorleif von Munthe af Morgenstierne. He informed a somewhat nonplussed Crown Princess (who seems to have been in the dark about Crown Prince Olav’s recent correspondence with Roosevelt) that an American warship was being sent to Finland to transport her and her children to the US. But would she go? On 20 July, Märtha received the US Minister to Norway, Mrs Florence Harriman, who was now ensconced temporarily at the US Legation in Stockholm. The Crown Princess indicated to the American that she was happy to accept President Roosevelt’s kind offer. Nevertheless, Märtha was keen to emphasise that she wanted to enter the US ‘as quietly as possible’ and that she ‘would not be required to meet reporters or a reception committee’. The Crown Princess also clearly hoped the date of her arrival would be kept confidential. The American plan thwarted the regency option much to the annoyance of King Gustav who telegraphed King Haakon, on 24 July, stating that he objected to the American trip as it might undermine the future of the Norwegian monarchy, a viewpoint Haakon quickly dismissed.\n\nOn 22 July, Mrs Harriman was informed by the US State Department that a naval transport, the USS American Legion, was about to leave for the Finnish port of Petsamo (now Petsjenga, Russia) and should reach there around 5 August. It was also made clear that there was ‘no possible way’ the Crown Princess’ arrival in the US could be kept confidential. Indeed, soon after Märtha left Ulriksdal, on 12 August, the Norwegian Legation released a statement to the press, also broadcast over Radio Sweden, stating that the Crown Princess and her three children ‘will leave for the United States in the next few days to visit President Roosevelt’ who had issued ‘a personal invitation’ to the Norwegian royals. In the interim, the Crown Princess travelled northward into Finland and onwards to Petsamo where, on 15 August, she and the royal children embarked the American Legion which transported them across the Atlantic to New York. Märtha appeared on the ship’s manifest as ‘Mrs Jones.’ Others in the party included her Chief of Staff, Peder Anker Wedel Jarlsberg; a Lady-in-Waiting, Mrs Ragni Østgaard; the latter’s son Einar and the royal children’s nurse, Signe Svendsen. Touchingly, Prince Harald was pictured clutching his beloved teddy bear. However, in her luggage, Märtha also had a splendid farewell gift from her mother: a magnificent suite of emerald and diamond jewels which had once belonged to Queen Sophia of Sweden. The intention was that should the Crown Princess ever be in financial difficulties, during these difficult war years, she could raise cash by selling the jewellery.\n\nThe Crown Princess and her three children would eventually settle in a largish brick house set in substantial grounds in Pooks Hill, Maryland. President Roosevelt took a great interest in the family (he had even accompanied his royal guest on the house search) and Märtha would soon become part of his inner circle and ideally placed to obtain first-hand knowledge of the comings and goings at the White House and in Washington’s political circles. She was also a frequent visitor to the President’s private estate at Hyde Park, on the banks of the River Hudson near Poughkeepsie. The Crown Princess would go on to become an important bridge builder between the US and the Norwegian government-in-exile in London."
