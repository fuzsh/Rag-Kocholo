        "text": "Royal Relatives from around Europe gathered to celebrate the Wedding of Crown Prince Olav of Norway and Princess Martha of Sweden at Oslo Cathedral on this ay in 1929, following a Gala Performance at the Nationaltheatret.\n\nCrown Prince Olav of Norway married Princess Martha of Sweden at Oslo Cathedral\n\nThe church was adorned in flowers of different shades of white – azaleas, lilacs, tulips, hydrangeas and white lilies – against a backdrop of palms. Several hundred singers from three separate choirs flanked the pipe organ, while 50 military officers stood in salute along the centre aisle.\n\nThere were 1 600 invited guests, including numerous relatives and friends on both sides, as well as government officials, foreign diplomats and many prominent citizens.\n\nThe ceremony began at 12:00 pm. Crown Prince Olav entered the cathedral accompanied by his best man, the Duke of York, to the tones of Rikard Nordraak’s “Purpose”, played by the cathedral organist, Eyvind Alnæs.\n\nThe Crown Prince was followed by the closest members of the Royal families, while the Norwegian Student Choral Society sang Wilhelm Stenhammar’s “Sverige” (Sweden). The bride entered the cathedral on the arm of her father. Four pairs of bridesmaids – each comprised of a Norwegian and a Swedish representative – walked behind her hand-in-hand, with Princess Ingrid of Sweden and the Norwegian explorer and humanitarian Mr Fridtjof Nansen’s daughter Irmelin at the head.\n\nThe ceremony was conducted by Bishop Johan Lunde. The congregation sang the hymns “Kjærlighet fra Gud” (Love from God) and “Gud som ljos og gleda sender” (God Who Sends Light and Happiness). The ceremony was concluded with the “Hallelujah Chorus” by Händel.\n\nTwo 21-gun salutes were fired from Akershus Fortress. A wedding lunch for 200 guests was held at the Palace after the ceremony.\n\nRoyal Guests and Relatives were led by King Haakon VII and Queen Maud of Norway with Prince Carl and Princess Ingeborg of Sweden, and included Crown Prince Gustaf VI Adolf and Crown Princess Louise of Sweden, The Duke and Duchess of York, and Princess Thyra of Denmark.\n\nRoyal Guests and Relatives from around Europe attend the glittering Gala Performance at the Nationaltheatret (National Theatre) in Oslo, on the eve of the Wedding of Crown Prince Olav of Norway and Princess Martha of Sweden, which followed a Ball at the Royal Palace of Oslo and another Ball held the previous week at the Royal Palace of Stockholm.\n\nCrown Prince Olav of Norway (wearing the Order of St. Olav and Order of the Seraphim) and Princess Martha of Sweden (in the Vasa Tiara, Queen Lovisa’s Turquoise Necklace, King Gustaf V’s Portrait Brooch, and the Royal Family Order of King Haakon VII),\n\nThe Duchess of York (in her Persian Turquoise Parure Tiara), Crown Prince Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, Queen Maud of Norway (wearing Queen Alexandra’s Turquoise Circlet), and Prince Carl of Sweden.\n\nPrincess Ingeborg of Sweden (in her Emerald Parure Tiara), King Haakon VII of Norway, Crown Princess Louise of Sweden (wearing Queen Sofia’s 9-Prong Tiara), the Duke of York, Princess Thyra of Denmark, Princess Ingrid of Sweden (in the Khedive of Egypt Tiara) and Prince Axel and Princess Margretha of Denmark (wearing her Floral Tiara).\n\nCrown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Martha remained happily married until her tragic death in 1954, and are the parents of King Harald, Princess Astrid, and Princess Ragnhild.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nEmerald Parure\n\nQueen Josefina’s Diamond Tiara\n\nVasa Tiara\n\nBoucheron Pearl Circle Tiara\n\nDiamond Bracelet Bandeau\n\nDiamond Chandelier Earrings\n\nArt Deco Diamond Bracelet\n\nPearl Earrings\n\nEmbed from Getty ImagesEmbed from Getty ImagesEmbed from Getty ImagesEmbed from Getty Images\n\nCrown Prince Olav of Norway married Princess Martha of Sweden at Oslo Cathedral on this day in 1929.
