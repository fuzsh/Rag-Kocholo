It was given by Mr. & Mrs. Julius Christian August Fleischer, the Consul-General of Norway and his wife. Before arriving in New York the King had a two-week tour of the United States. He is 64 years old. He was wearing a suit tailored in the Ferner Jacobsen clothing store in Oslo, which is owned by the husband of his younger daughter, Princess Astrid. His other daughter, Princess Ragnhild, is married to Erling Lorentzen, a shipping man. His only son, Crown Prince Harald, is engaged to Sonja Haraldsen, daughter of an Oslo clothing store owner. One purpose of the trip was to promote trade between Norway and the U.S."
