        "text": "King Olav V of Norway, who as Crown Prince was a national symbol of resistance to Nazi Germany's occupation of his country in World War II, died yesterday after a heart attack, the Palace announced. He was 87 years old.\n\nOlav, the oldest monarch in Europe, was widely revered by his subjects in a reign that began in 1957. A constitutional sovereign with a sense of history and humor, he mingled freely and informally with his subjects. They in turn loved him as a father figure and fondly termed him a \"folke konge\" (a king for all the people). His royal motto was \"My All for Norway,\" first chosen by his father, King Haakon VII.\n\nHe is to be succeeded by his son, Crown Prince Harald.\n\nKing Olav traveled throughout much of the world and made more than a dozen trips to the United States, including several secret wartime visits. He was an ardent and adept sportsman into old age, and won many ski jumping and yachting competitions, including a 1928 Olympic gold medal for 5.5-meter-class sailboats.\n\nOlav's egalitarian geniality was epitomized in a popular photograph of him in the early 1970's, carrying skis aboard a local train on the way from the royal palace in Oslo to a nearby slope. At the time, his subjects were being exhorted to use public transit to conserve oil, nearly a decade before North Sea explorations made Norway an important oil and gas producer. Offered to Lead Resistance\n\nIn 1940, when Hitler's troops swept over southern Norway, Crown Prince Olav, the King and leaders of the parliamentary Government held out for two months in the north woods against nightly air raids and advancing German troops. As the leaders prepared to retreat to England, Olav offered to stay behind to help lead a resistance, but he was overruled by the others, who opposed the offer as too hazardous.\n\nIn the wartime Government in exile in England, Olav became the top envoy to the United States, helped build a fighting force of free Norwegians, often attended his exiled Government's Cabinet meetings, made radio broadcasts to his countrymen and, as the general commanding the armed forces, received a triumphant homecoming after aiding the 1945 allied liberation of Norway.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
