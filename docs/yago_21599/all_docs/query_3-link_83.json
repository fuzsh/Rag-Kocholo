        "text": "Princess Märtha Louise of Norway has announced her decision to give up her royal role, in order to ‘distinguish between myself as a private person on the one hand and as a member of the Royal Family on the other.’ The Norwegian princess is shifting away from her royal roots to pursue a life and career with her American spiritual healer fiancé, the self-described ‘shaman’ Durek Verrett. The latest announcement, however, is by no means the first indication of Märtha Louise’s commitment to following her own path. As she leaves royal duties behind, Tatler looks back at Märtha Louise’s major life milestones to date.\n\nRead More\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise of Norway relinquishes royal duties to pursue life with spiritual healer fiancé, Durek Verrett\n\nThe only daughter of King Harald V and Queen Sonja announced her intention to ‘distinguish between myself as a private person on the one hand and as a member of the Royal Family on the other’\n\nHer royal birth\n\nBorn on 22 September 1971 in Oslo, Princess Märtha Louise was the first child of the then Crown Prince Harald and Crown Princess Sonja of Norway. She was named after her paternal grandmother, Crown Princess Märtha, and her great-great-grandmother, Queen Louise, mother of King Haakon VII. Despite being the first-born child of the Crown Prince, she did not feature in the order of succession at the time of her birth, because constitutional law at the time dictated that only males could inherit the Norwegian throne.\n\nThe establishment of Princess Märtha Louise’s Fund\n\nIn 1972, when the young princess was just shy of her first birthday, a special fund was established in her name, launched ‘to provide assistance to children with disabilities under the age of 16 in Norway’ (as explained on the Royal House of Norway’s website). Initially set up with a capital of NOK 75,000, the return on the fund’s investments is awarded to projects carried out by NGOs, with the allocation of grants each year coinciding with the princess’s birthday on 22 September.\n\nA change in the order of succession\n\nPrince Haakon Magnus, Märtha Louise’s younger brother, was born in 1973 (later becoming Crown Prince on the death of his grandfather, King Olav V, in 1991). The Norwegian constitution was changed in 1990, switching to a system of full cognatic primogeniture – meaning the eldest child, regardless of their gender, takes precedence. The alteration was not retroactive, so Märtha Louise did not take up her brother’s place as future heir to the throne. Females born between 1971 and 1990, however, were granted succession rights after their brothers, meaning Märtha Louise is today fourth in line to the throne (having shifted down the order following the birth of Haakon’s children, Princess Ingrid Alexandra and Prince Sverre Magnus).\n\nHer early years\n\nMärtha Louise and her brother grew up at the royal Skaugum Estate near Oslo, where her parents are said to have ‘attached great importance to giving their children an upbringing that was as similar as possible to that of other Norwegian children’. The royal siblings attended a municipal day-care centre and a local primary school, with the young princess displaying an early aptitude for singing, music and dancing (she was part of a choir, played the flute and performed in a folk dancing group at the Norwegian Museum of Cultural History), as well as being a keen horsewoman.\n\nAn entrepreneurial streak\n\nWith her early enthusiasm for dancing and equestrian sports, the princess has always had an interest in physical wellbeing. A certified physiotherapist, she trained in Oslo and Maastricht in the Netherlands, before channelling her passion for Norwegian folk tales and performing to set up her own entertainment business: encompassing a ‘storytelling series’ on national TV and performing with respected Norwegian choirs. Her verve for entrepreneurialism has also seen her publish books, run classes, launch a YouTube channel and collaborate on beauty and clothing lines. The Royal Court’s website makes clear that since launching her ‘independent professional activities in the cultural sphere and as a Rosen therapist [trained under the principles of German-American physiotherapist Marion Rosen]’ in 2002, Märtha Louise has been classified as ‘self-employed’ and is therefore ‘subject to Norwegian tax laws’.\n\nShe loses her ‘Royal Highness’ styling and reduces her royal activities\n\nIn January 2002, in conjunction with the expansion of her business ambitions and the commencement of her taxpayer status, the princess also began to shift away from her constitutional royal role. After consulting his daughter, King Harald, who acceded to the throne in 1991, removed her ‘Royal Highness’ styling and her official duties were reduced, enabling her to have more freedom in pursuing her independent ventures.\n\nRead More\n\nPrincess Märtha Louise of Norway is engaged to spiritual healer boyfriend, Shaman Durek\n\nThe 50-year-old was previously married to Ari Behn, who tragically took his own life three years ago\n\nShe marries and starts a family\n\n2002 was a big year for Märtha Louise in more ways than one. Following her engagement to Ari Behn, a Norwegian author, playwright and artist, in 2001, the couple were wed the following spring, in a glittering ceremony at Trondheim’s Nidaros Cathedral on 24 May. The couple went on to have three daughters together: Maud Angelica (born in 2003), Leah Isadora (2005) and Emma Tallulah (2008).\n\nThe family move across the globe\n\nDuring their years as young parents Märtha Louise and Ari Behn spent periods living around the world in New York City and London. They eventually returned to Norway and settled in Lommedalen, a pretty rural valley in the county of Akershus.\n\nMärtha Louise’s divorce\n\nAfter publicly announcing their decision to separate in 2016, the princess and Ari Behn formally divorced in 2017. In a stroke of tragedy for the family, Behn, who had grappled with alcoholism and mental health issues, took his own life on Christmas Day in 2019. The sad news was publicly announced by the Norwegian royals, with King Harald and Queen Sonja expressing their ‘great sorrow’, lamenting that three of their granddaughters had ‘lost their dear pappa’.\n\nHer relationship with Durek Verrett\n\nIn May 2019, the princess publicly announced that she was in a relationship with the American spiritual healer and self-described ‘shaman’, Durek Verrett. Verrett, who has over 260k Instagram followers and a number of Hollywood connections (he recently appeared on Netflix reality show Bling Empire) began collaborating with his royal belle professionally, too, with the couple running seminars entitled, ‘The Princess and the Shaman’. Their work hasn’t been without controversy: Märtha Louise has previously suggested that she can communicate with animals and angels; while Verrett has faced criticism for implying in his book, Spirit Hacking, that cancer is a choice, and sells a medallion on his website which he claims helped him overcome Covid-19. The couple announced their engagement in June this year, with Verrett writing on Instagram: ‘I’m overjoyed with tears that I get to spend the rest of my life with the most pure hearted, angelic, wise, powerhouse woman who represents all levels of a goddess in my eyes. Together as a soulful spiritual couple, we will use our power to support the people to create a world based in love and acceptance.’\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMärtha Louise leaves royal life behind\n\nOn 8 November, it was announced that the princess would be relinquishing her royal role, in order to create ‘a clearer distinction between her own activities and the association with the Royal House’. She will no longer be a royal patron for various organisations and the couple will not ‘employ the title of princess or refer to members of the Royal House in their social media channels, in media productions or in connection with other commercial activities’, with the exception of Märtha Louise’s Instagram handle. The Royal House of Norway also alluded to ‘the racist attitudes that Durek Verrett has had to contend with, especially on social media’, stressing that they ‘deplore’ such views and ‘consider it a strength that the Royal House reflects Norway’s ethnic diversity.’ Taking to Instagram in the wake of the news, the princess added that ‘the process with the family has been amicable and loving’. She also explained that Verrett will not receive a title on their marriage, before stressing: ‘We both believe in the school of medicine, but that alternative medicine can be a great supplement in addition to school medicine.’ In her family’s statements, meanwhile, they added that ‘members of the Royal House of Norway have great confidence in the Norwegian health service and the Norwegian health authorities.’"
