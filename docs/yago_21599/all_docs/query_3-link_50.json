        "text": "Harald V (born February 21, 1937, Skaugum, Norway) is the king of Norway from 1991, succeeding his father, Olav V.\n\nHarald was the youngest of three children born to Olav and Crown Princess Märtha. However, as the only son, he became crown prince when his father assumed the throne in 1957. Harald attended the Norwegian Military Academy and Balliol College, Oxford, and attained the rank of captain in three branches of his country’s armed forces. Like his father, he was a fine athlete and excelled at yachting.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nHarald’s courtship of a commoner, Sonja Haraldsen, caused some controversy, and he reportedly threatened to never wed if the couple were prevented from marrying. Olav eventually gave his consent, and, after some nine years of dating, the pair were married on August 29, 1968. Harald and Sonja had two children, Märtha Louise (born 1971) and Haakon Magnus (born 1973)."
