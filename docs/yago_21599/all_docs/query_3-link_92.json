        "text": "OSLO -- When President Reagan greets King Olav V of Norway Monday he will be shaking hands with Europe's oldest reigning monarch and one of the world's leading sports enthusiasts.\n\nThe king's courtesy call at the White House Nov. 30 will climax a private journey in the United States and also mark their second meeting. Reagan first met Olav during an official visit by the monarch in 1982.\n\nAmerican presidents are no strangers to the King. Olav, 84, frequently conferred with President Franklin D. Roosevelt during lecture tours of the United States in the early 1940s as Norway's World War II resistance leader and chief of defense.\n\nEnglish-born King Olav V represents Europe's proudest royal traditions. His maternal grandfather was King Edward VII of England, Queen Victoria's eldest son. His father was Prince Carl of Denmark, younger brother of King Christian X.\n\nYet Olav heads what is often referred to as the most democratic royal house in the world. When Norwegians broke their 91-year-old union with Sweden in 1905, they turned to Prince Carl of Denmark and asked him to become their king.\n\nThe young Danish prince accepted on the condition that the issue be decided through a referendum. Thus Prince Carl was actually elected King of Norway and adopted the old Norse name of Haakon.\n\nThis democratic beginning of a dynasty has left its mark on the Norwegian royal family, which avoids the ceremonial pomp and circumstance characteristic of most other royal houses.\n\nOlav, the new crown prince, was born Prince Alexander Edward Christian Frederik on July 2, 1903, at Sandringham, England, the only child of Prince Carl and British Princess Maud.\n\nThe world's first royal prince to attend an ordinary second school, Olav once said he was 'glad that I didn't live during an era when the king was a remote and pompous person. It must have been very unpleasant.'\n\nCrown Prince Olav's youth was consumed in skiing and sailing. He won a gold medal for sailing at the 1928 Olympic games in Amsterdam. The widower monarch still, today, enters international regattas and is known among his fellow yachtsmen as a true hard-weather sailor.\n\nHis physical stamina stands him in good stead during strenuous state visits abroad. The tall and robust king appears unaffected by long days on the road, while aides and reporters less than half his age are driven to exhaustion by the king's murderous pace.\n\nDuring last week's official visit to Canada, Olav watched the home team Montreal Canadiens beat the New Jersey Devils 2-1 in a National Hockey League match and afterward handed out the prizes in Montreal's Forum stadium.\n\nHe never misses a chance to watch a good soccer match and braves sub-freezing weather for hours on end to follow the performance of Norway's top skiers in national and international competitions.\n\nIn a 1983 interview marking his 80th birthday, Olav, who lives in a hill-top palace overlooking Oslo's main thoroughfare, said he considered himself 'King of all Norwegians.'\n\nWhile neighboringSweden long ago stripped their monarchs of the powers that previously went with the throne, King Olav still formally appoints the prime minister.\n\nAlthough he stays away from party politics, on rare occasions the head of state will use his unique moral authority and appeal directly to the people when the normal political process appears to have failed.\n\nIn a speech last month, Olav criticized a display of racist tendencies among his subordinates and appealed to them to treat the increasing number of refugees and asylum-seekers from Third World countries as fellow Norwegians.\n\nAfter completing his officer's training and studies at Oxford University, Olav in 1929 married Princess Martha of Sweden. They moved from the royal palace in the capital of Oslo to the country estate of Skaugum, where their three children spent their early childhood in a quiet, rural atmosphere.\n\nBut their happy life was shattered on April 9, 1940, when Nazi German troops invaded Norway. Crown Princess Martha and the children fled to the United States, where they remained until the end of the war as the personal guests of President Roosevelt.\n\nMeanwhile, Olav and his father, Haakon, became symbols of the Norwegian determination to resist the German occupation. They led the month-long military campaign that followed the invasion, and then sailed across the North Sea to Britain to head the Norwegian armed forces in exile. At the same time, they guided the underground struggle of the Norwegian resistance movement.\n\nIn his capacity as chief of defense, Olav was the first member of the legal government to set foot in Norway when the war ended.\n\nOn May 13, 1945, wearing a uniform and defying the many Nazis and German sympathisers still in Oslo, Olav drove with one bodyguard through the capital in an open car -- provoking an outpouring of joy and a shower of flowers.\n\nOn Dec. 21, 1957, King Haakon died and Olav ascended to the throne, proclaiming his father's motto, 'All for Norway.' Three years earlier, Olav's wife, Princess Martha, had died, a few weeks after the postponement of their silver wedding celebrations."
