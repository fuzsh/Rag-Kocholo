        "text": "Olav V was originally christened Alexander Edward Christian Frederick. He was born on July 2, 1903, in Appleton House in Norfolk, Great Britain, as the only child of Prince Carl of Denmark (later King Haakon VII of Norway) and Princess (later Queen) Maud. When his father was crowned king of Norway in 1905, the son became crown prince and was given the name Olav. In 1929 Crown Prince Olav married his cousin, Princess MÃ¤rtha of Sweden. Together they had three children, Princess Ragnhild Alexandra, Princess Astrid Maud Ingeborg and Prince Harald.\n\nCrown Prince Olav accompanied his father on numerous journeys in Norway, journeys that provided him with detailed knowledge of his country and people. When the king and the government had to flee the country in the face of German occupation in 1940, Olav offered to remain in Norway, an offer not supported by the king and government. Through the war years, from 1940 to 1945, he was constantly travelling in Great Britain, USA and Canada, actively contributing to building up Norwegian forces. From 1944 to 1945 he was general commanding officer.\n\nIn the years following the liberation, Crown Prince Olav took on an increasing number of the king's duties. He was made regent in 1955, during his father's prolonged illness. When, after King Haakon's death in 1957, he was made King of Norway, he adopted the same motto as his father, \"Alt for Norge\", pledging to give his \"All for Norway\"."
