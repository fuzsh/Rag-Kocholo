        "text": "âThe Kings of the Liberationâ\n\nHM King Harald V of Norway was born at the Crown Prince residence Skaugum outside of Oslo on February 21st in 1937 as the son of HRH Crown Prince Olav and HRH Crown Princess MÃ¤rtha. He is a member of the House of GlÃ¼cksburg, a Royal house originally from Northern Germany. King Harald is closely related to other European monarchs, such as HM Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and HM Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain.\n\nKing Harald is married to HM Queen Sonja (born Haraldsen in Oslo in 1937) and they have two children; HRH Crown Prince Haakon (born in 1973) and Princess MÃ¤rtha Louise (born in 1971). The King is the formal head of the Church of Norway and the Norwegian Armed Forces.\n\nKing Harald succeeded to the throne of Norway upon the death of his father King Olav V on January 17th 1991, and his benediction was held on June 23rd 1991 in the medieval cathedral Nidarosdomen in Trondheim.\n\nThe Norwegian Royal Family is especially closely linked to the events of WWII. When Nazi-Germany invaded Norway on April 9th 1940 the family was forced to flee the country, and came to play an immensely important role in the resistance movement.\n\nThe triple portrait âThe Kings of the Liberationâ was painted to Norwayâs Resistance Museum at Akershus fortress at the occasion of the 70 years celebration of the liberation of Norway from Nazi occupation in 2015.\n\nThe triptych was unveiled at Akershus fortress on March 26th in the presence of His Majesty as well as the Secretary of Defense, Oslo's Mayor, WWII veterans and some 250 guests. The paintings were a gift from Samlerhuset and Norwayâs Resistance Museumâs friends.\n\nThe documentary film âThe Kings of the Liberationâ tells the tale of the Royal Familyâs role in WWII and sets Kolbyâs portraits of King Haakon, King Olav and King Harald in a historic perspective.\n\nRead an article on the Royal House of Norway's official site, that gives a little peek into the unveiling.\n\nAfter the liberation in the autumn of 1945 back then Prince Harald was the worldâs first Royal to attend a public school. He later studied at the University of Oslo, the Norwegian Military Academy and at the Balliol College in Oxford.\n\nAlthough Norway is a constitutional monarchy The King is highly involved in the state affairs. He heads the Council of State at The Royal Palace in Oslo every Friday at 11 OâClock, as well as he has weekly meetings with his Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. His Majesty also conducts the solemn opening of the Parliament every autumn.\n\nKing Harald is also an avid sailor and has represented Norway in three Olympic Games as well as several World Championships.\n\nThe King is a highly respected monarch, and especially after his very personal and caring involvement after the tragic terror attempt of July 22nd 2011 many a Norwegian expressed their warm feelings for the grandfather-like and heartily warm peopleâs King."
