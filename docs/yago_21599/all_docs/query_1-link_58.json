        "text": "Your Majesty, Vice President and Mrs. Humphrey, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:\n\nNeither the man nor the nation nor the traditions that we salute this evening, are strangers to America. The man and his family have been here before. The nation is one of the great nations that helped make America. The traditions have influenced our own.\n\nStill, this is the first time that a reigning Norwegian monarch has visited here. This gives us a very special occasion to express the gratitude, as well as the admiration, that has been in all of our hearts so long.\n\nLast night I went to dinner in Chicago with 7,800 politicians and partisans. Tonight I dine with a King. There, Your Majesty, is democracy--with a little \"d.\" It is really a wonderful system when the President of our country, in an election year, can attend two consecutive dinners on two consecutive nights and deliver two nonpolitical speeches.\n\nYou don't know how grateful I am because I do need the practice.\n\nI think I must also say that I very much envy our distinguished guest. He is that rarest of all visitors to this house--a man who is nonpolitical by law. I think some of you might suspect the very special pleasure that we had in meeting today, how much of common interest that we had to talk about-just the two of us nonpoliticians.\n\nSitting there in the White House listening to His Majesty, I began thinking of the life of kings. Then I got some ideas about my own retirement plans. I have not forgotten that the kind people of a small South Pacific island once upon a time offered me their throne. But perhaps I might just as well forget it now because someone might say that I was thinking of establishing the 51st State and planning to crown everything with the \"comeback.\"\n\nYour Majesty, our admiration for Norway has never been more substantial than it is now. As you may know, sir, I come from a section of our country known for its modest restraint in describing its own merit. I know you will observe that when you visit us in the days ahead.\n\nBut I must admit that even I am in total awe of your modesty and your restraint. I know that if I could speak for Norway following the Winter Olympics, I don't think that I could ever stop talking about it. However, what transpired during the Winter Olympics was really not out of character for Norwegians. The world has always admired the courage and the ability and the hearty endurance of the people of Norway. Their courage during the dark days of World War II is legendary. Their ability as artists and statesmen is no less so.\n\nLet us remember that Norway was the home of Ibsen, Grieg, and more recently of Trygve Lie.\n\nThe sons of Norway endured in the bitter winds of the open prairie to find a new prosperity in our own land and to give new strength to our own society.\n\nOne of the sons of Norway in America, Hubert Humphrey, has shown all of these qualities. They have already led him to the second highest office in this land.\n\nYour Majesty, Americans know that Norway is a friend of dignity all around the world. We know that Norwegians have built a fine life at home that is based on freedom and based on equality.\n\nWe celebrate the fact that Norway and the United States are allied in the causes of peace and the causes of progress. We work together in the United Nations, at Geneva, at the OECD in Paris, and in many other major international forums. In the Atlantic Alliance, Norway stands courageously on NATO's northern flank.\n\nYour Majesty, you mentioned to me this morning that we share a sense of community-and that is so. I know that you will feel at home as you visit throughout our country in the weeks ahead. And we are so pleased that you could come here and spend some time with us.\n\nI believe that your presence will further intensify that sense of community of which you spoke.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I would like to ask you to join me in a toast to His Majesty, the King of Norway, to the people of Norway, and always to the Norwegian-American enduring friendship."
