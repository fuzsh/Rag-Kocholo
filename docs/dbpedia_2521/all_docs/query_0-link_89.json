        "text": "When Weezer last performed at Costa Mesa’s Pacific Amphitheatre two years ago, the group added sprinklings of pizazz to its typical set list. Mixed in with expected hits were two cool covers, Foster the People’s “Pumped Up Kicks” and Radiohead’s “Paranoid Android,” plus relatively uncommon runs through “Photograph” and “Pink Triangle.”\n\nThat’s one way to approach an OC Fair gig: appease the gung-ho peeps who know everything with a couple deep cuts while remaining appealing to those who just stopped in to enjoy whatever was playing that day. That’s easily achieved given their extensive catalog: nine full-length albums, yielding at least a dozen radio tunes most everybody knows.\n\nThe other route is to go even safer and perform only widely recognized material to ensure the majority can sing along to every word. That’s the approach Weezer embraced for its return to Pacific Friday night: nothing out of the norm.\n\nI’m not necessarily complaining. For an outfit that’s been at it for just over 20 years, the norm is never less than superbly pro and undeniably entertaining.\n\nRivers Cuomo, Brian Bell, Scott Shriner and Patrick Wilson have perfected a surefire formula. First, pull at the audience’s nostalgia strings by opening with alt-rock classics like “My Name is Jonas,” “Hash Pipe” and “El Scorcho.” Next, insert a handful of recent, chant-worthy (though not particularly dynamic) rockers like “We Are All on Drugs,” “Perfect Situation” and “Troublemaker.” (That last one has come to include a token run through the pit from Cuomo, who didn’t do anything more rebellious here than briefly steal a soda cup and pop his Boy Scout shirt collar.)\n\nTo finish off the pattern, power through about eight more generational staples – “Surf Wax America,” “Island in the Sun,” “Beverly Hills,” “(If You’re Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You to,” an obvious main-set closing spot for “Buddy Holly.”\n\nCuomo did make efforts to create a special experience, however. During “Dope Nose” and “Keep Fishin’,” he climbed each of the amphitheater’s stage-flanking stairwells, ripping a couple sharp solos in cheering fans’ faces.\n\nAnd after the latter tune, as an intro to “Say It Ain’t So,” he pointedly drew attention to the significance of an O.C. show with a brief reminiscence about the song’s genesis: “I wish I could walk through the whole arena and say hi to everybody, because this is our hometown … where it all started, way back in 1992. (Pat and I) went into my garage … took these chords … and we got heavier and heavier until I said, ‘I think we’ve got something.'”\n\nThat brief interjection certainly seemed to add gusto to what stood out as the crowd’s most uproarious choral response, which in turn inspired Cuomo and Bell to deliver some of their most searing fret duels.\n\nThe one exception to the standard-set rule came with the encore’s opener, “The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn).” Most people were probably more stoked for the capper, “Undone (The Sweater Song),” but the former better comprises all of Weezer’s strongest elements: unlikely tempo changes, pitch-perfect harmonies and plenty of driving, riff-heavy cymbal-crash rock to wrap it up.\n\nIt’s been three years since their last release, and there were no tastes or even hints of anything coming up. Yet, based on Cuomo’s final entreaty – “keep listening to Weezer!” – one might guess something is on the docket. Hopefully that will guarantee a few change-ups for their next Pacific gig.\n\nSet list: Weezer at Pacific Amphitheatre\n\nMain set: My Name Is Jonas / Hash Pipe / El Scorcho / We Are All on Drugs / Troublemaker / Memories / Perfect Situation / Dope Nose / Surf Wax America / Island in the Sun / Beverly Hills / Keep Fishin’ / Say It Ain’t So / (If You’re Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To / Pork and Beans / Buddy Holly\n\nEncore: The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn) / Undone (The Sweater Song)"
