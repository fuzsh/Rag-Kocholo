        "text": "Ten To Hear Again: Soundgarden\n\nListen To The List: Soundgarden – Ten To Hear Again\n\nIf the Soundgarden you know best are songs like “Outshined”, “Spoonman”, “Pretty Noose” and “Black Hole Sun”, here are ten to hear again (or for the first time):\n\nSoundgarden was a band that brought together a variety of influences to create their unique sound and then, ultimately, wove them together in a style that rose above their influences to become something all their own. Soundgarden’s music was definitely influenced by the murky local Seattle sound that ultimately became known as grunge, and the band was rightly seen as one of the pioneers of that sound. However, Soundgarden also relied heavily on the heavy riffing of metal bands like Black Sabbath, the bombastic arena rock tendencies of groups like Led Zeppelin, flourishes of harcore punk, trippy pyschedelia, and elements of pop as well. These threads increasingly came together to create Soundgarden’s trademark sound and to make them one of the heaviest, most varied, and most successful of the grunge bands. So, if the Soundgarden you know best are songs like “Outshined”, “Spoonman”, “Pretty Noose” and “Black Hole Sun”, here are ten to hear again:\n\n“Slaves & Bulldozers” – From the album Badmotorfinger\n\nCombining elements of plodding metal, trippy psychedelia, and grunge murkiness “Slaves & Bulldozers” is the secret gem of Soundgarden’s breakthrough album Badmotorfinger; a powerful mishmash of styles that proved Soundgarden had arrived. One listen to “Slaves & Bulldozers” shows why Soundgarden could be nominated for a Grammy for best Metal album in the years before grunge was recognized as a distinct style of its own. “Slaves & Bulldozers” also rivalled the singles for the honor of being the best song on Badmotorfinger and served as proof that their album tracks could rival their singles, an issue that plagued their early records. Absolute power.\n\n“My Wave” – From the album Superunknown\n\nWhile “My Wave” was released as the fourth of five singles from Soundgarden’s landmark album Superunknown it was easily the least well known of those singles. Featuring a fat power chord on the verses that gives way to a psychedelic squall on the chorus ,“My Wave” finds guitarist Kim Thayil and bassist Ben Sheppard working in tandem to create something that is both pummeling and that has real forward momentum. This serves as a perfect musical bed for Cornell’s lyrics that equate keeping the world’s problems off “my wave” as the music has a weight that rushes forward and eventually breaks. “My Wave” is one of Soundgarden’s better more direct moments.\n\n“Hands All Over” – From the album Louder Than Love\n\nLongtime fans of the band will know this song as “Hands All Over” was a single from Louder Than Love, the last Soundgarden album to be released before grunge broke as a national phenomena and Soundgarden had their commercial breakthrough. “Hands All Over” combines Soundgarden’s love of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath in a way that may not yet be totally unique but that is, without a doubt, both powerful and impressive. “Hands All Over”, in my opinion, is Soundgarden’s best pre-Badmotorfinger moment and is a song that casual fans of the group should know along with the later hits.\n\n“Mind Riot” – From the album Badmotorfinger\n\nGrunge rock always had two sides to it: It was half heavy metal and half punk rock. Indeed, this marriage of styles was what made it a unique style and what caused its sound to vary so much from band to band. Soundgarden, for the most part, fell firmly on the more metal-driven side of grunge, and that feeling of metallic weight and sonic power can be heard on “Mind Riot”. Yet, for all that, something about “Mind Riot” has always felt like a punk rock song to me in its attitude. “Mind Riot” also has just a touch of pop melody running through it and while it was hard to hear at the time, in hindsight, one can hear the song pointing forward to Chris Cornell’s more streamlined solo career as well. Indeed, I always felt “Mind Riot” would have made a great fourth single from Badmotorfinger.\n\n“Girl U Want” – From the EP Satanoscillatemymetallicsonatas\n\n“Girl U Want” is Soundgarden’s fairly faithful cover of a song by new wave pioneers Devo (yes, Devo!). Soundgarden slow it down a little and give it a heavier and more menacing tone, but it is clearly not a radical rewrite. Where the Devo version exudes waves of sexual frustration, Soundgarden’s evokes a dark feeling of building lust and so takes on its own tone, while still being faithful to the original. Originally included on an EP packaged with early copies of Badmotorfinger “Girl U Want” was given wider release when it was included on the B-sides and rarities package Echo Of Miles.\n\n“Fresh Tendrils” – From the album Superunknown\n\nCo-written with drummer Matt Cameron, who has a gift for writing melancholy rockers with just a hint of pop appeal (a talent he would soon take to Pearl Jam where he would end their revolving door of drummers and co-write underappreciated songs like “You Are”). “Fresh Tendrils” has the feel of a massive beast rising from the water and plodding across the land to, slowly and inexorably, catch and destroy you. It has a sense of inevitability and power that feels like Soundgarden even while largely avoiding the murk of Soundgarden’s earlier work. “Fresh Tendrils” is definitely one of the highlights of their highly lauded album Superunknown; and while it is hard to argue with any of the five songs chosen as singles “Fresh Tendrils” sure feels like it could have been a hit.\n\n“A Thousand Days Before” – From the album King Animal\n\nAfter an acrimonious breakup and an eighteen year hiatus Soundgarden roared back in 2012 with King Animal and it sounds like nothing has happened in the intervening years. This, by the way, should be considered a good thing as the band pays no attention to current trends or, for the most part, Chris Cornell’s solo career and time with Audioslave, and just returns the metallic shredding and murky grunge they were known for in the early 90’s. The one song that perhaps is a bit of an exception is shiny and lightly psychedelic “A Thousand Days Before”. This song doesn’t feel out of place on an album that followed Superunknown and Down On The Upside but would have been out of place on some of Soundgarden’s early, sludgy works. “A Thousand Days Before” is undeniably rock, but it does feel produced more like a pop song and it works, giving the song a near epic gloss that follows in the footsteps of, although never quite achieves, the feeling of Led Zeppelin.\n\n“Rhinosaur” – From the album Down On The Upside\n\nDown On The Upside was both a move forward and a retreat from Superunknown. The album pushed the psychedelic elements more to the fore while also simultaneously returning to the harder edged production of earlier records. This can help or hinder depending on the song but in the case of the crunchy, riff-driven “Rhinosaur” it works superbly and makes this bone-breaking mauler one of the best tracks on Down On The Upside.\n\n“Like Suicide” – From the album Superunknown\n\nI debated whether or not to include this track due to the circumstances of Cornell’s death, but it is one of the band’s best non-singles and closes out their magnum opus Superunknown perfectly. Slow building desperation set to a musical framework that straddles the line between early and late Soundgarden. It’s a classic even if it has become more haunting in the years since his death.\n\n“Rowing” – From the album King Animal\n\n“Rowing” opens with a gang chant rhythm and a lyric that is defiant in the face of problems. The song briefly rises above the pain and conflict with Cornell wailing his defiance above a full band stomp, but the song ends somewhat ambiguously when it falls back into the prison gang feel of the opening for the end. In my opinion, it is one of the more interesting and effective songs on King Animal.\n\nTen To Hear Again: Simple Minds\n\nListen To The List: Simple Minds – Ten To Hear Again\n\nIf the Simple Minds you know best are songs like “Don’t You (Forget About Me)”, “Alive and Kicking”, “See The Lights” and “Promised You A Miracle”, here are ten to hear again (or for the first time):\n\nSimple Minds have such a long and varied career that I freely admit I am doing them a disservice by not breaking their career into various phases the way that I have for some other bands. That said, I have done my best to sum up their extensive career here, pulling from their early, experimental days, their anthemic 80’s hit making years, their Celtic and world music dalliances, and their superb later work as alternative elder statesmen. So, if the Simple Minds you know best are songs like “Don’t You (Forget About Me)”, “Alive and Kicking”, “See The Lights” and “Promised You A Miracle”, here are ten to hear again:\n\n“East At Easter” – From the album Sparkle In The Rain\n\nSimple Minds’ sixth album Sparkle In The Rain finds Simple Minds leaving behind their early experimental tendencies in favor of anthemic rock in a similar vein to U2. Sparkle In The Rain also finds the band hitting their commercial peak. “East At Easter” is a powerful song that also exemplifies these changes as the song is both huge sounding and packed with drama; music made for stadiums and trying to make a statement. “East At Easter” does these things without losing its songcraft to the message. Simple Minds at their emotional best.\n\n“Belfast Child” – From the album Street Fighting Years\n\nThe Street Fighting Years was an album dedicated to pushing for change in places facing oppression such as Northern Ireland and South Africa and themes addressing those issues repeatedly pop up. “Belfast Child” uses obviously Celtic instrumentation and borrows liberally from the Irish folk song “She Moved Through The Fair” to raise concerns about violence in Ireland. A beautiful, emotional, and defiant song, “Belfast Child” was a number one hit in the UK (and probably shouldn’t be on this list because of it). However, in the USA the Street Fighting Years album and its lead single “Belfast Child” were commercial failures, signalling the end of Simple Minds run as a mainstream artist in America. So, “Belfast Child” has a very divided impact. It is such a great song though that I decided to include it here for those who may not know it.\n\n“In Trance As Mission” – From the album Sons and Fascination\n\nIn 1981 Simple Minds released two albums on the same day – Sons and Fascination and Sister Feelings Call – which would be the last two albums from their early, more experimental phase. Soon, the band would morph into the Scottish U2 and create impressive and catchy stadium-sized rock, leaving behind weird synth and keyboard driven atmospheric pieces like the warmly pulsing “In Trance As Mission”.\n\n“New Gold Dream (81/82/83/84)” – From the album New Gold Dream (81/82/83/84)\n\nSimple Minds have two sets of fans, those who were with the band from the early days and prefer their experimental art rock and those who found Simple Minds when they embraced elements of new wave and college rock and became stars. Those two groups don’t overlap too much but the one album they can usually agree on is the fifth release New Gold Dream, which is something of a transitional album (albeit an excellent one) with one foot in both camps. That dichotomy can be heard in the title track which boasts a strong sense of melody and purpose, like a later Simple Minds, while also being rooted in the experimental synth sound and moody atmospherics of their early work. On “New Gold Dream” it all comes together and works.\n\n“The Kick Inside Of Me” – From the album Sparkle In The Rain\n\nI can’t ever hear the opening to Simple Minds’ “The Kick Inside of Me” without feeling like I am hearing an outtake from U2’s War (there is an especially eerie reminiscence to that album’s “The Refugee”). “The Kick Inside Of Me” also boasts a similar new wave meets The Rolling Stones’ swagger that would soon become the trademark of INXS. And while Simple Minds are obviously drawing on similar influences as U2 and INXS (or borrowing from those bands) “The Kick Inside Of Me” still feels fully realized as a Simple Minds song. In fact, I think it is one of Simple Minds’ best harder hitting moments.\n\n“Today I Died Again” – From the album Empires And Dance\n\nReleased in 1980, the long shadow of Joy Division hangs over “Today I Died Again”. It can be heard in Jim Kerr’s vocal style, the crawling atmosphere of the track, the bleak lyrics, and the production techniques. However, if Simple Minds have proved anything over the course of their long career it’s that they are masters at incorporating other peoples’ sounds and twisting it into something that is their own. They did it later with artists like U2, INXS, Peter Gabriel, The Pogues, and others, and they do it here as well. “Today I Died Again” may be different than much of their discography but it is really interesting as an example of early 80’s post-punk and has a dark majesty that is unavoidable.\n\n“When Two Worlds Collide” – From the album Real Life\n\nIn the early 1990’s U2 was critically praised and commercially rewarded for their transformation from sincere rockers who loved all things American to irony-drenched, Euro-centric dance/rock mavens with Achtung Baby. The truth is that Simple Minds made a similar shift six months earlier when they released their album Real Life. Anyone who knows the two groups well will hear the obvious similarities in style, tone and theme between these two albums. It’s easy to overlook Real Life because U2 did it better just a few months later, but Real Life is a great album full of many of the same themes and sonic tricks that made Achtung Baby so good. It is also notable that Simple Minds made their album first since they had spent so much of their career living somewhat in U2’s shadow. Now, I am not accusing U2 of carpetbagging or theft – after all they were well into the recording of Achtung Baby when Real Life was released – just that two similar groups made a similar sonic change at the same time. So why does Achtung Baby get so much more credit? Well, it is a better album than Real Life. U2 also push further into their new direction than Simple Minds do. It also helps that U2 was a more popular and successful band that drew more attention (especially in America) and that they not only changed their music but their entire visual look and aesthetic. All that said, one listen to an excellent Real Life track like “When Two Worlds Collide” and a listener will likely be shocked at both how good the song is and how it would fit in seamlessly onto Achtung Baby, an album nobody in Simple Minds had ever heard when they wrote and recorded this song. “When Two Worlds Collide” is an alternate universe hit that likely should have been one in ours.\n\n“African Skies” – From the album Real Life\n\n“African Skies” almost feels more like a sound poem than a song. Built up from frenzied, tribal drumming with Jim Kerr’s almost spoken-word vocals and Charlie Burchill’s guitars and keys used over the top to create a sense of tense atmosphere. “African Skies” could be about the rape of a continent or a metaphor for a relationship gone wrong. While the fusion of rock, dance, and world music feel like time, worlds, and genres colliding.\n\n“Seven Deadly Sins” – From the album Good News From The Next World\n\nReleased in 1994, right at the crest of the grunge rock and American alternative explosion, Simple Minds released the album Good News From The Next World. While certainly not a repudiation of their past or a dramatic embrace of then current trends, songs like the rocking “Seven Deadly Sins” do have a touch more edge to it. The guitars have a bit of distortion and bite and Kerr’s vocals have some grit and anger to them. It may or may not be a nod to the times but it gives “Seven Deadly Sins” a fresh attack that makes it stand out.\n\n“Barrowland Stars” – From the album Walk Between Worlds\n\nReleased in 2018, “Barrowland Stars” finds Simple Minds merging their early work with their later work. “Barrowland Stars” is built up from synths and keys and has a sense of experimentation and eerie atmospherics that are, at least, reminiscent of their early work from the 70’s (indeed, Jim Kerr at times sounds a little like Bowie here rather than Bono). However, there is also a windswept, widescreen tone to it that recalls their anthemic work from the 80’s. If nothing else, “Barrowland Stars” proves that Simple Minds can still make innovative and interesting music 40 years into their career.\n\nTen To Hear Again: Psychedelic Furs\n\nListen To The List: Psychedelic Furs – Ten To Hear Again\n\nIf the Psychedelic Furs you know best are songs like “Love My Way”, “Pretty In Pink”, “Heartbreak Beat” and “The Ghost In You”, here are ten to hear again (or for the first time):\n\nSitting right at the crossroads of post-punk and new wave are the Psychedelic Furs. Boasting a smoky, urban slickness that is cut through by Richard Butler’s rough and gravelly vocals, the Psychedelic Furs are both edgy and melodic and among the more unique sounding bands of their era and genre. Being both a little bit leather and a little bit lace meant that the Furs could have hits, even in America, without ever seeming like a shiny new wave pop band. Thus, the Psychedelic Furs were able to keep their artistic credibility even while having a run of hits. So, if the Psychedelic Furs you know best are songs like “Love My Way”, “Pretty In Pink”, “Heartbreak Beat” and “The Ghost In You”, here are ten to hear again:\n\n“Forever Now” – From the album Forever Now\n\n“Forever Now” juxtaposes fuzzy, distorted guitars and Richard Butler’s smoky rasp of a voice with chiming, sparkling guitars and keyboards and a gripping sense of melodicism to create one of the standout tracks from the Psychedelic Furs best albums. Indeed, “Forever Now” feels like an archetypal moment in the Furs discography and I still find it strange that it was not ever released as a single.\n\n“Imitation of Christ” – From the album The Psychedelic Furs\n\nThe Psychedelic Furs were born fully formed, and while they would later clean up their sound a little and push the new wave elements a little more to the fore, all the elements of their sound – from Butler’s smoky voice and angst-driven lyrics, the saxophone flourishes that lend their music an urban coolness, the brittle and raw feel of post-punk, and the quirky new wave melodicism – can be heard from the start. “Imitation of Christ” is an early standout track and has all of these hallmark elements of the band used to excellent effect. Indeed, the song seems to have the bleakness of Joy Division, the urban decadence of The Velvet Underground, and the slinkiness of Bowie all rolled into one.\n\n“Highwire Days” – From the album Mirror Moves\n\nMirror Moves is the album where the Psychedelic Furs begin to smooth off some of the rough edges and more openly embrace the new wave tendencies that had always been present in their music. This could be seen as selling out for a more commercial product (and indeed it is a path that many of their peers took) but it never really feels that way for the Psychedelic Furs. The keys are more present, the hooks a little bigger, and the drumkit more electronic (although that may have had as much to do with the fact that drummer Vince Ely had exited the group) but “Highwire Days” still has a sense of palpable sense of danger and a dark vibe running through it that would be recognized by any longtime fan of the band.\n\n“Book Of Days” – From the album Book Of Days\n\nThe Psychedelic Furs’ album Book Of Days was produced by The Cure’s frequent producer Dave Allen and you can hear his touch all of the album. In fact, Book Of Days was the project Allen worked on immediately after completing The Cure’s magnum Opus Disintegration and he uses many of the same technique to good effect here. The album’s title track is a good example of this as it features prominent bass work that moves the song forward, reverb-drenched guitar, heavy atmospherics, extended instrumental passages, and a droning sense of menace. That isn’t to say “Book Of Days” sounds like The Cure, because it never sounds like anyone other than the Psychedelic Furs, but it does sort of feel like The Cure, and that is a very good thing in the case of the oft overlooked “Book Of Days”.\n\n“Wedding Song” – From the album The Psychedelic Furs\n\n“Wedding Song” sounds nothing like a celebration of a new life together. The drums are huge, cavernous, and almost robotic feeling in their sound. The music has the smoky exotism and arabesque flavor of a hashish den or sultan’s harem. Meanwhile, over it all Butler wails words and barks lyrics, one of which is the repeated refrain of “useless…”. Not exactly a song of love and hope but definitely one that creates a strong sense of atmosphere that is very intriguing.\n\n“Shine” – From the album Book Of Days\n\nChiming and pretty with crisp, clean production “Shine” feels like a ray of hope in a darkening world. Driven forward by the excellent bass guitar playing of Tim Butler (who producer Dave Allen uses all across this album in a similar fashion to his use of The Cure’s Simon Gallup) “Shine” is uplifting, yet anchored to a sense of gritty realism by Butler’s bass. Book Of Days is often overlooked as a lesser Psychedelic Furs because it comes so late in their discography, but in truth it is something of a return to form after the slick and relatively lifeless Midnight To Midnight and songs like “Shine” are why.\n\n“Get A Room” – From the album World Outside\n\nThe last Psychedelic Furs album was World Outside, released in 1991 just as grunge and American alt rock changed the landscape of alternative music. That said, World Outside comes just as that wave broke and so was not really shaped by the sound of it or commercially affected by it. Indeed, songs like the slow-building, acoustic tension of “Get A Room” show that the Psychedelic Furs were already growing and embracing many of the same trends that would soon come to the forefront of alternative music. The Psychedelic Furs, who had always had a sense of darkness and grit in their music, were one of the few 80’s first wave bands whose sound could probably have still fit in during the 90’s without a massive overhaul of their sound. Indeed, a superb song like “Get A Room” seems to bear this out. However, after the World Outside album Richard Butler decided to end the Furs and make a clean start with his new 90’s band Love Spit Love, a group that would take the sound of late Furs songs like “Get A Room” and use them as a jumping off point for a sound that was similar to the Psychedelic Furs but better suited to the 90’s. (Note: If you like the Psychedelic Furs but haven’t explored the two Love Spit Love albums I recommend you do so now as they are both great listens.)\n\n“Susan’s Strange” – From the album The Psychedelic Furs\n\nA very early Psychedelic Furs track, “Susan’s Strange” was produced by legendary Joy Division producer Martin Hannett and echoes of his work with Joy Division can be heard here, especially in the sound of the bass and drums and the general production sound which somehow manages to feel both minimalist and cavernous at once. “Susan’s Strange” was not included on the original UK version of their debut album but was on the US version. The song was later added to the UK version as well. The Psychedelic Furs will always be strongly connected to the 80’s because of John Hughes’ use of their song “Pretty In Pink” as inspiration for his film of the same title (which the Furs recut for the soundtrack). However, to me, “Susan’s Strange” always feels like it should have been the theme song for Ally Sheedy’s goth/basket case character in the John Hughes film The Breakfast Club due to its titular refrain and the lyrical references to being misunderstood for being different.\n\n“All Of This And Nothing” – From the album Talk Talk Talk\n\n“All Of This And Nothing” begins with a long, jazzy intro that highlights Duncan Kilburn’s saxophone before almost completely shifting gears and morphing into a darkly urban groover that oozes the sense of desperation and nihilism of smoke-filled 80’s night clubs in New York or London. While not a single “All Of This And Nothing” has become a fan favorite, first wave cult classic and signature song for the band.\n\n“Goodbye” – From the album Forever Now\n\nSomething about “Goodbye” always vaguely reminds me of Oingo Boingo. It is possible it is the sax blasts, bass driven groove, or slick and strange new wave feel – all of which are also hallmarks of Oingo Boingo’s music – but those same elements are also used in many other songs by Psychedelic Furs and they don’t give me that same vibe. Regardless, “Goodbye” is a punchy, almost pop-oriented slice of new wave that is very good even if it doesn’t quite sound or feel like Psychedelic Furs’ early post-punk colored work or their later, slicker, more new wave sounding songs.\n\nTen To Hear Again: Eurythmics\n\nListen To The List: Eurythmics – Ten To Hear Again\n\nIf the Eurythmics you know best are songs like “Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)”, “Here Comes The Rain Again”, “Would I Lie To You?” and “Missionary Man”, here are ten to hear again (or for the first time):\n\nThe Eurythmics made their fame and fortune as pioneers of early synth music, spawning a run of hits that merged Dave Stewart’s cutting edge electronic music with Annie Lennox’s soulful and angelic voice. In the process the duo helped to popularize synth music in the UK and introduce it in America. What many fans didn’t know is that the Eurythmics had a history of more conventional music as part of the UK band The Tourists and even, at least in part, on their overlooked and mostly forgotten debut. Ultimately, this meant that Lennox and Stewart left behind the synth hits of their early albums and embraced a wider, and somewhat more traditional, sound before amicably calling it quits at the end of the 80’s. After a decade of solo albums and production work the Eurythmics reunited once more for one more go in 1999. Whether working as edgy synth pioneers, 80’s mainstream pop rockers, or mature adult alternative balladeers, Eurythmics do it incredibly well and have a much, much deeper catalog than their hit singles (which are inarguably amazing). So, if the Eurythmics you know best are songs like “Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)”, “Here Comes The Rain Again”, “Would I Lie To You?” and “Missionary Man”, here are ten to hear again:\n\n“Jennifer” – From the album Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\n\nFrom the landmark Sweet Dreams album “Jennifer” is a quiet, windswept synth ballad that, surprisingly, is fairly unique in the Eurythmics discography. It’s not that the Eurythmics don’t have other excellent ballads and quieter, more reflective moments because they do, but most of them have more instrumentation and the more soulful vibe Annie Lennox later mastered. Here, on “Jennifer”, the Eurythmics offer up an intimate moment that invokes images of Wuthering Heights or other Victorian gothic romances that is more of a piece with their early synthpop peers without sounding like anyone other than who they are. An overlooked, wonderful track.\n\n“The Last Time” – From the album Revenge\n\nOne of the best songs on the Eurythmics fifth album Revenge “The Last Time” continues the synths meets live instrumentation pattern of their previous hit album Be Yourself Tonight and while Revenge as an album is not as consistent “The Last Time” is a soulful pop number with a melancholy underpinning about a woman who has had enough with her wayward lover. In truth, it is a bit surprising that “The Last Time” wasn’t released as a single because it sure sounds like a hit. On a personal aside I sure would love to hear Erasure cover this song as it has always almost felt like the Eurythmics attempting to create the feeling of Erasure.\n\n“Adrian” – – From the album Be Yourself Tonight\n\nA duet between the Eurythmics’ Annie Lennox and Elvis Costello “Adrian” both sounds and feels like something that is pitched perfectly between the synthpop of the Eurythmics and the melodic, but slightly strange, indie pop of Elvis Costello (which is a tribute to the Eurythmics’ Dave Stewart as Costello does not have a co-writing credit here). In essence, the song is an interesting character sketch of a dreamer in a world of realpolitik and it sounds exactly like you would expect a song between these two powerful and pioneering alt rock stars to sound, which is a good thing.\n\n“Regrets” – – From the album Touch\n\n“Regrets” is from the Eurythmics third album (and follow-up to their breakthrough Sweet Dreams) Touch. A funky synthpop number full of strange effects and unusual melodic turns “Regrets” sounds and feels like it is a sonic cousin to Yaz’s “Situation” or “State Farm” both in the way the music sounds and in how Lennox’s soulful voice adds life to the technology in a similar way to Alison Moyet.\n\n“Savage” – – From the album Savage\n\nExcepting their debut, Savage is likely the Eurythmics least known and most overlooked album. Some of that is deserved as Savage can be a little inconsistent and because it was a shift back to the harsher and colder tones of their earlier synth-oriented work (a plus for me but not always for their more mainstream fans). That said, the title track “Savage” is a criminally overlooked gem in their canon and is one of their better slower moments as well as being a late career highlight. Lennox’s vocals are sultry and powerful and Stewart’s music is sleek and restrained. Not released as a single, and admittedly it may not be the kind of song that would have stormed up the charts, but I think it may have been worth the risk to try because it has an emotional resonance that may have spoken to people.\n\n“(My My) Baby’s Gonna Cry” – From the album We Too Are One\n\nBy the time of “(My My) Baby’s Gonna Cry”, from the Eurythmics final album for a decade We Too Are One, the duo had mostly abandoned their synthpop roots and adopted an indie-laced pop-rock sound that had brought them wider success, especially in the USA. In fact, “(My My) Baby’s Gonna Cry” is a perfectly good piece of blue-eyed soul inflected pop and is the only Eurythmics track to feature a co-lead vocal by Annie Lennox and her bandmate Dave Stewart. While Stewart’s voice is thin, I like the way they sound together here enough that it makes me wish Stewart had contributed just a little more often vocally. In fact, while this may sound like a bad thing to some, the interplay between them reminds me a lot of Swedish pop duo Roxette, who are masters of harmonic pop rock and seemed to have possibly based their whole career on this song.\n\n“The Miracle Of Love” – From the album Revenge\n\nA fairly straightforward love song that was released as a single in the UK but not in the USA. “The Miracle Of Love” is an ethereal and hopeful song about the power of love to heal that is aimed right at the Top 40 charts and has little of the bite or experimentation of the Eurythmics early music. Indeed, the song seems very safe as a single choice and it is surprising that it was not released in the much less experimental American market. Not a song to jump out and grab you, but “The Miracle Of Love” is not meant to be and it is an uplifting, softer moment from a band that often liked to challenge their listeners.\n\n“Better To Have Lost In Love (Than To Never Have Loved At All)” – From the album Be Yourself Tonight\n\n“Better To Have Lost In Love (Than To Never Have Loved At All)” is from the Eurythmics Be Yourself Tonight album, which is the album where the duo leave behind much of their synth-oriented past and embrace a more traditional rock/pop philosophy. This change in emphasis can be felt in the sad but warm “Better To Have Lost In Love” which combines elements of rock, pop, Motown, and synthpop into something that is both distinctive and, yet, of its time. Not surprisingly, it is Annie Lennox’s expressive and warm vocals that really tie it all together and make it more than just another album track.\n\n“17 Again” – From the album Peace\n\nAfter taking a ten year amicable break Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox reformed the Eurythmics in 1999 to a fair amount of fanfare and released the album Peace. As an album Peace is a beautiful and mature listen, full of hushed highlights and quiet pleasures. It also draws heavily on the mood and sound of Lennox’s two successful solo albums, but it’s hard not to wish the duo had been a little more experimental and dangerous at times. The album opens with the “17 Again”, a reflective trip down memory lane that recounts Lennox and Stewart’s younger days breaking into the scene and that references their own early hit “Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)” in a clever way that seems to bring their career full circle in a way. “17 Again” is melodic, warm, nostalgic, pretty, and full of subtle pleasures. One of the highlights from Peace, which may well be the duo’s swan song album.\n\n“Paint A Rumour” – From the album Touch\n\n“Paint A Rumour” does an excellent job of combining the Eurythmics early career trick of blending man and machine. Dave Stewart creates a cold, slick, mechanical bed of synths and bass to offset Annie Lennox’s warm and expressive voice. It is a formula that the duo used to become superstars in the early days of electronic music and MTV and “Paint A Rumour” is a prime example of this style with just a touch of eastern influences to add a sense of mystery and exoticism.\n\nTen To Hear Again: Collective Soul\n\nListen To The List: Collective Soul – Ten To Hear Again\n\nIf the Collective Soul you know best are songs like “Heavy”, “The World I Know”, “December” and “Shine”, here are ten to hear again (or for the first time):\n\nCollective Soul was one of the legions of bands to ride to success on the heels of the early 90’s grunge and alternative rock explosion. On the one hand Collective Soul always felt a little like carpetbaggers, jumping on the grunge rock bandwagon just in time to ride it to success and then jumping off again when it faded just in time to embrace the same post-grunge posturing and production as Nickelback and Creed. However, at heart Collective Soul (or at least primary songwriter Ed Roland) really writes great pop/rock songs and, in truth, Collective Soul likely always had more in common with post-alternative groups like Matchbox Twenty and The Wallflowers; bands who had one foot in the alt rock world and one in the classic rock arena. Eventually, Collective Soul understood and accepted this and began creating hook-driven, shiny pop/rock with just a touch of that 90’s alternative influence. So, in the end, Collective Soul may not be all that original or important, but they are a band that knows how to write a good tune as evidenced by not only their long string of rock hits, but also by many of their great album tracks that proved that they were more than a singles band. So, if the Collective Soul you know best are songs like “Heavy”, “The World I Know”, “December” and “Shine”, here are ten to hear again:\n\n“Goodnight Good Guy” – From the album Hints, Allegations & Things Left Unsaid\n\nCollective Soul first came to the attention of the world with their debut album Hints, Allegations & Things Left Unsaid and its “grunge” hit “Shine”. In fairness, it should be noted that bandleader Ed Roland has repeatedly claimed that the songs on that album were, in fact, demo versions released by the record company without his permission to quickly cash in on the success of grunge rock and that it was his intention to clean them up further. This may be true as most of their later catalog has a much slicker and more pop-oriented sound than “Shine” does. Another indication that Roland may not be playing loose with the truth is the straightforward lyrics and pop-heart lying underneath the fuzzy production on “Goodnight Good Guy”, a catchy rock number that is a better song than the hit single “Shine”.\n\n“Generate” – From the album Dosage\n\nMost successful alternative rock bands that survived into the late 90’s flirted with increased production and electronic textures and Collective Soul was no exception. On their fourth album Dosage the band almost completely abandons the grunge and alt rock overtones of their early albums in favor of slick, synthesized rock. The difference between Collective Soul and most of their peers is that this crunchy, pop-hearted, faux-glam is what they should always have been making as it is what they do best. “Generate” is a great non-single that depicts this era of the band’s sound.\n\n“She Gathers Rain” – From the album Collective Soul\n\nCollective Soul had a hit with their debut album with the success of “Shine”, but it was their self-titled second album that really made them stars, spinning off hit after hit and ultimately resulting in no less than five hit singles. However, the album has some good deep cuts too like the Pearl Jam meets Stone Temple Pilots riffing of “She Gathers Rain”. While it is obvious that the song is borrowing its tone from the Seattle sound Collective Soul are more careful here to make it their own than they did on “Shine” and “She Gathers Rain” has that same grimy tone married to a melodic core that many of the great grunge rock songs had.\n\n“Blame” – From the album Disciplined Breakdown\n\n“Blame” opens with a folk intro that could almost be borrowed from an Appalachian moonshiner’s record collection before reshaping itself into a shiny, modern power pop song. That sense of play and willingness to leave behind the grunge and alt rock trappings they had previously pursued (and that sunk much of their third album Disciplined Breakdown) makes “Blame” one of that album’s best moments and something of an overlooked minor gem.\n\n“Over Tokyo” – From the album Blender\n\nI have no idea what Collective Soul were doing with their fifth album Blender or who the album was supposed to appeal to. In truth, I am not sure they knew either. The album cover looks like one rejected by a B-level boy band, the songs continue the synthesized power pop of their previous album but also strangely added glam rock overtones that were completely out of step with the time (although have served some of the songs well over the long run of time). And I haven’t even mentioned the tepid duet with Elton John that is so boring even the band knew better than to release it as a single. That said, the album also gave us the excellent hit single “Why, Pt. 2” and the melancholic mid-tempo “Over Tokyo”. “Over Tokyo” has a great melodic hook and grooving bass line that gives the song an underlying sense of strength that really serves it well.\n\n“Feels Like (It Feels Alright)” – From the album Youth\n\n“Feels Like (It Feels Alright)” blends a party anthem vibe with the glam stomp of T-Rex to create something that sounds like the work of a much younger band. Trashy, sexy fun that is miles and miles away from the frowny-faced grunge-lite of their early work and is better for it. (In a strange side note that will mean nothing to almost anyone but me, for some reason Ed Roland’s voice on the chorus reminds me a lot of Ivan Doroschuk of 80’s synthpop band Men Without Hats).\n\n“Good Morning After All” – From the album Afterwords\n\nIn the latter part of their career Collective Soul would still occasionally try to rock a little. However, their best moments were the reflective midtempo numbers and ballads that played in the same neighborhood as Matchbox Twenty and Lifehouse. One of the best of these is the chiming, yearning “Good Morning After All”, a song that could be about either moving forward in a committed relationship or waking up with a one night stand only to realize you want more. It’s a skillfully written and beautiful song.\n\n“Right As Rain” – From the album Blood\n\nA midtempo rocker where Ed Roland questions his life’s path and the state of his soul, “Right As Rain” could come across flat and silly but “Right As Rain” has enough bite to feel credible. Indeed, “Right As Rain” could almost be a great lost song from the band Live, with its shiny alt rock hooks and spiritual-themes lyrics. “Right As Rain” is from 2019’s Blood and is proof that Collective Soul can still write a good song.\n\n“Fuzzy” – From the album Collective Soul (Rabbit)\n\nFrom Collective Soul’s second self-titled album (seriously, what is up with artists, supposedly creative people, naming not one but two albums after themselves?) “Fuzzy” is a fun, glam-inflected rocker that rides a fat bass groove and distorted guitars to create a song that almost sounds like classic early Collective Soul; or at least it would if not for the strange whistling at the intro and bridge and its playful genderbending lyrics.\n\n“Satellite” – From the album Youth\n\n“Satellite” is a simple, alt-rock ballad. A throwback to radio circa 1993 from the year 2004 and better for it. One of Collective Soul’s most gentle and overlooked moments.\n\nTen To Hear Again: Cracker\n\nListen To The List: Cracker – Ten To Hear Again\n\nIf the Cracker you know best are songs like “Low”, “Teen Angst (What The World Needs Now)”, “Get Off This” and “I Hate My Generation”, here are ten to hear again (or for the first time):\n\nCracker is a band that was both blessed with talent and cursed with eccentricity. Indeed, their rapid rise and fall had far more to do with timing and changing circumstances than anything that they did or didn’t do. In fact, their catalog is remarkably high in quality and consistent, if a little unusual. Singer and band leader David Lowery came from quirky 80’s college rock darlings Camper Van Beethoven and the sense of irony and anarchy that Camper Van Beethoven were known for can be found in Cracker’s music as well. However, Lowery partners up here with his old friend guitarist Johnny Hickman, who roots Cracker’s sound in equal parts classic rock, country, and alternative. In fact, Cracker’s eponymous debut, released in 1992 just as grunge rock was rewriting the rules of what could be mainstream, proved to be one of the last great hurrahs of college rock. They followed that up with Kerosene Hat, which put a bit more of a 90’s alt rock twist on their sound and spun off the massive hit “Low”, making Cracker one of the leading lights of the grunge and alternative rock revolution for a brief moment. The follow-up album The Golden Age continued in a similar vein but was released just as the bottom fell out for grunge and alt rock and the album was a commercial disappointment that came to be a symbol for alt rock’s fading fortunes in spite of being a good album. Cracker then got into a bitter dispute with their record label – Virgin Records – and released two very good albums that had little support from their record company or from fans outside of their dedicated core audience. Since that time Cracker has released a slew of independent albums that show a band comfortable with who they are, making the music that they want to make. Cracker had too many hits to be considered the forgotten 90’s band that people should know, but they are also often overlooked and have a far, far deeper catalog than most people expect. So, if the Cracker you know best are songs like “Low”, “Teen Angst (What The World Needs Now)”, “Get Off This” and “I Hate My Generation”, here are ten to hear again:\n\n“I See The Light” – From the album Cracker\n\n“I See The Light” is a great example of the kind of genre-blurring and ignoring rock Cracker makes. Musically, the song draws liberally on 70’s style southern and arena rock, as well as the key influences on those genres such as pop-oriented British Invasion rock and touches of country and folk music. However, lyrically Lowery delivers a witty and ironic tale that practically drips 90’s alt rock fatalism and sarcasm. For example the key refrain of the song is “I see the light at the end of the tunnel now/Someone please tell me it’s not a train”. This combination of the old and new, of Cracker’s willingness to borrow or steal from anyone or any time, creates a sound that works great on songs like “I See The Light”.\n\n“Friends” – From the album Sunrise In The Land of Milk & Honey\n\n“Friends” is a buddy song that draws heavily on drunken, barroom honky tonk country music. It is a loose jam that finds its soul in being unprofessional and rough around the edges. “Friends” features co-lead vocals between Cracker’s David Lowery and Patterson Hood of Drive-By Truckers and the interplay between them really sells the song. “Friends” is miles away from something that would be a radio hit (either at the height of Cracker’s commercial appeal or now) but is exactly the kind of humorous and free-wheeling fun one would expect of a band who has been doing it their own way for a long time.\n\n“Where Have Those Days Gone” – From the album Greenland\n\nCracker’s sixth studio album of new material, and the first to be released as an independent act following their long battle with Virgin Records, is Greenland – an album that is full of great songs but that has a production that lends the entire album a feeling of cold light, missed opportunities, and nostalgic memories. “Where Have Those Days Gone” is a great example of this. The song is not that different from many of Cracker’s other more serious and commercial moments, but instead of the bright and loose sound that it might have had if it had been on Kerosene Hat or The Golden Age, here it feels thin and lonely. That isn’t a knock on the song or its production as it is obviously a choice the band made. Indeed, it is a choice that serves the song well on this propulsive, but not energetic feeling look back at better and more carefree times.\n\n“Euro-Trash Girl” – From the album Kerosene Hat\n\nI debated long and hard about whether or not to include “Euro-Trash Girl” as it is definitely a fan favorite that even got a little radio play when Cracker was at the height of their commercial popularity. That said, “Euro-Trash Girl” was also a secret song hidden on the end of the Kerosene Hat album that never was released as a single. It also happens to be one of the best songs Cracker ever wrote. “Euro-Trash Girl” is a loose, darkly humorous, country-tinged travelogue about traveling the Old World (almost certainly drunk and on a very tight budget) to find the perfect (or maybe just the easiest) girl to win his heart.\n\n“Nothing To Believe In” – From the album The Golden Age\n\nCracker’s follow-up to their massively successful Kerosene Hat album was The Golden Age, an album that still exhibited all of Cracker’s myriad influences but also more firmly tread the paths of grunge and alt rock. This firmer embrace of the sound of the 90’s can be heard on both the hit lead single “I Hate My Generation” and its much less commercially successful follow-up “Nothing To Believe In”. However, the lack of commercial success has far more to do with the changing musical climate than with the song itself, which is actually a very solid slab at grunge-influenced rock done Cracker style.\n\n“El Comandante” – From the album From Berkeley to Bakersfield\n\nWhile Cracker had always been a group that obviously had warm feelings for their home state of California, their double album From Berkeley to Bakersfield is a love letter to, and a song cycle about, life in the nooks and crannies of the Golden State. “El Comandante” is a loose jam that mixes pop, garage rock, and country textures into a narrative about a young man who has run afoul of a drug kingpin (likely by stealing his product) while also dating his daughter. It is a song that straddles the line between humor and nostalgia as the protagonist attempts to talk his way out of his situation by appealing to the fact that the drug kingpin/girlfriend’s father was probably young and stupid once too, and probably liked to be in love and get high. Maybe not the best tack to take but it makes for an interesting song where the listener can’t decide if you feel for him or think he deserves what is probably coming.\n\n“Wedding Day” – From the album Gentleman’s Blues\n\nA bluesy, country ramble about an ex-girlfriend’s wedding day that sees our narrator sitting around waiting for the devil to send his minions to mark the occasion, while he laughs at the new man’s stupidity for getting himself into her clutches. The genius of the song is that it remains unclear whether these hard feelings come from anger at his devilish ex for the ways she did him wrong or the fact that she has moved on and he can’t let her go (or maybe a little bit of both).\n\n“Kerosene Hat” – From the album Kerosene Hat\n\nCracker has a mostly deserved reputation for writing humor-laced songs and not taking themselves too seriously. However, the blues-tinged indie-folk ballad “Kerosene Hat” is proof that Cracker could write an emotionally gripping serious tune when they wanted to. A broken love song set against a backdrop of crushing poverty and hopelessness, “Kerosene Hat” feels sounds and feels a lot like one of the Counting Crows darker moments (which shouldn’t be that surprising since singer Adam Duritz is a good friend of the band and Cracker’s David Lowery produced the third Counting Crows record). “Kerosene Hat” is the kind of downbeat, nihilistic ballad that the early 90’s was famous for. A song that sounds like Cracker while feeling of its time and place.\n\n“Movie Star” – From the album Kerosene Hat\n\nVintage Cracker, absurdist lyrics that somehow still seem to convey plenty of meaning set against a backdrop of music that is a perfect hybrid of 90’s alternative rock and 70’s arena bombast. Loud and rowdy, “Movie Star” mocks the artifice and dehumanization of fame without sounding pretentious or forgetting to have a little fun along the way.\n\n“Ain’t Gonna Suck Itself” – From the album Countrysides\n\nCountrysides is Cracker’s album of irreverent covers of classic country songs, but tacked onto the end (firmly outside of the album’s theme and sound) is the equally irreverent “Ain’t Gonna Suck Itself”. Musically a strange hybrid of quirky new wave and Jimmy Buffet style beach rock that somehow works, “Ain’t Gonna Suck Itself” is Cracker’s brutal and funny, innuendo and double éntendre-laced tell-off of Virgin Records.\n\nTen To Hear Again: Blink-182\n\nListen To The List: Blink-182 – Ten To Hear Again\n\nIf the Blink-182 you know best are songs like “All The Small Things”, “The Rock Show”, “I Miss You” and “Adam’s Songs”, here are ten to hear again (or for the first time):\n\nWhen I think of the career of Blink-182 I generally think of them as a fun, but ultimately immature and lacking growth. However, when I stop and really think of their career in depth I realize that description is (at least partially) untrue and unfair. Over the course of their career Blink-182 went from being second rate Green Day wannabes to bratty punk icons who then expanded their sound to include post-punk and sonic trickery before the departure of Tom Delonge and his replacement by Matt Skiba both shook things up and brought the band back to its roots. So, if Blink-182 you know best are songs like “All The Small Things”, “The Rock Show”, “I Miss You” and “Adam’s Songs”, here are ten to hear again:\n\n“Ghost On The Dance Floor” – From the album Neighborhoods\n\nIn the early 00’s Blink 182’s guitarist and co-lead vocalist decided to leave Blink-182 and pursue his fascination for U2, The Cure and Pink Floyd with his new band Angels & Airwaves. Ultimately, after an eight year recording break Delonge decided to reunite with the rest of Blink-182 (who had been working as the group +44) to record the Blink-182 comeback album Neighborhoods. Sadly, the album was a commercial failure, but creatively it proved that Blink-182 could both incorporate the post-punk elements they had begun to explore and grow older gracefully without recycling the juvenalia that was their stock and trade. “Ghost On The Dance Floor” kicks off Neighborhoods is a prime example of this as it has both a punk rock fervor and a subtle melancholy that really works. In truth, for good or ill, “Ghost On The Dancefloor” sounds much more like an Angels & Airwaves track (which Delonge almost certainly originally intended it to be) than a Blink-182 song, but that doesn’t take away from the song’s quality or the more mature tone it sets for the album.\n\n“Los Angeles” – From the album California\n\nThe commercial failure and creative tensions surrounding Blink-182’s supposed comeback album Neighborhoods meant that Tom Delonge once again jumped ship to Angels & Airwaves, but this time Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker decided to go on without him and brought in Alkaline Trio’s Matt Skiba to replace him. The first album from this new version of Blink-182, 2016’s California, is a fresh start, a return to form, and surprisingly strong. While Blink 182’s “Los Angeles” doesn’t have a huge debt to L.A. punk icons X (who have a classic album and song of the same title) in its sound, there is something of that seminal band’s spirit in this ferocious and angry punk grinder.\n\n“Aliens Exist” – From the album Enema of the State\n\n“Aliens Exist” is one of the best non-singles of Blink-182’s classic era. The song balances the band’s bratty, teen rebel persona with some really melodic punk pop riffs. “Aliens Exist” manages to sit right at the crossroad between their early career hero worship and the development of their own sound and style, falling just safely into the latter camp. Lyrically the song, while presented as silly and sarcastic, is also interesting considering Tom Delonge’s later full immersion with his time and money into extra-terrestrial research.\n\n“A New Hope” – From the album Dude Ranch\n\nBorrowing its song title from the subtitle for the original Star Wars film, “A New Hope” is a full-blown punk thrash that has just a subtle hint of the Star Wars theme buried in in. Lyrically, Mark Hoppus sings of his teenage crush/unrequited love for Princess Leia and how he missed his chance to have her because he was busy parting with Lando. It’s actually a really effective song about wanting the girl you can’t have given an unusual and somewhat comical twist.\n\n“Online Songs” – From the album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket\n\nThe sessions for Blink-182’s Take Off Your Pants and Jacket were the first that were somewhat contentious for the band. The band had always had co-leaders in Mark Hoppus and Tom Delonge and for the first time the two men had a different vision of what their new album should be. Hoppus loved the fratboy, party feeling of their massively successful previous album Enema of the State and wanted to recreate it, whereas Delonge wanted to pursue a more hardcore punk direction and work in other styles. Hoppus’ “Online Songs” falls into the first camp and not only sounds and feels like an extension of their earlier work but is an actual continuation of a previous storyline. The fact that this is not really a new direction for the band though is not a detriment and “Online Songs” is one of the peak moments of their classic sound.\n\n“Wendy Clear” – From the album Enema of the State\n\n“Wendy Clear” is a catchy, near-perfect example of the kind of pop-inflected punk that Blink-182 helped to popularize. With one foot firmly in the sound of classical California punk and the other foot in the melodic world of pop “Wendy Clear” is a good example of Blink-182’s raision d’être (although that term is way out of the league of these seemingly eternal adolescents). In truth, “Wendy Clear” would have made an excellent single, they just didn’t need it to be one as the album was full of superb examples of this style of punk rock.\n\n“Obvious” – From the album Blink-182\n\nFor their sixth album, the eponymous Blink-182, the band did what many groups do when they self-title a later career record, they attempted to redefine their sound. In this case, the boys in Blink-182 followed the path of punk rock’s early years and experimented with the colder, darker, angular textures of post-punk. The album is somewhat hit and miss but there are some high points, including the crushing stomp of “Obvious”. Built off the brutal and harsh riffing of late 70’s post-punk bands, “Obvious” eventually evolves toward a more traditionally punk sound as it increases its emotion and tempo over the course of the song and is one of Blink-182’s best experiments with the textures and sound of post-punk, which they do a good job of making their own.\n\n“Natives” – From the album Neighborhoods\n\nMuch of Neighborhoods attempts to show how Blink-182 has grown up and evolved. While the trio succeed in achieving that goal over much of the album it also means Neighborhoods doesn’t really ever feel like Blink-182. On “Natives”, the band seems to try less to sound mature and meaningful and in the process does exactly that without completely abandoning their classic sound. Yes, there are still some echoes of the sound of Angels & Airwaves here in the production, but as a song “Natives” is constructed more like classic Blink.\n\n“San Diego” – From the album California\n\nAnother song from Blink-182 version 2.0, “San Diego” is a great moment that finds the band sounding less like snotty punks and more like emo rockers in the vein of Dashboard Confessional. Indeed, “San Diego” seems to be Hoppus’ way of showing Delonge that he can write moody and emotional songs too. Of course, if this feels a little more like emo than punk that could be because the song does name check The Cure and has a co-writing credit from Fall Out Boy’s Patrick Stump. At this point though it is fitting for Blink-182 to be doing more than straight ahead and punk and “San Diego” is a classic latter-day Blink moment.\n\n“All Of This” – From the album Blink-182\n\nA sublimely weird, yet wonderful moment in the Blink-182 catalog, “All Of This” – from Blink’s eponymous “post-punk” album – is a collaboration with The Cure’s Robert Smith. While this combo may sound like it could wind up creating something that is neither fish nor fowl, it proves to be a delightfully unexpected combination that results in a song that sounds a little like something from The Cure’s minimalist early days with Blink-182 singing back-up. That may sound strange but it plays retro cool.\n\nTen To Hear Again: Weezer, 2014-2019\n\nListen To The List: Weezer, 2014-2019 – Ten To Hear Again\n\nIf the Weezer you know best from the later part of their career, 2014-2019, are songs like “Back To The Shack”, “Thank God For Girls”, “Feels Like Summer” and “Africa”, here are ten to hear again (or for the first time):\n\nWeezer’s later career covering the years 2014-2019 has seen the band return to their roots, for the most part. After a middle part of their career that saw them expand their sound in a variety of directions with varying degrees of success, Weezer decided to return to the metal-infused power pop of their early days – sort of. 2014’s Everything Will Be Alright In The End was the return-to-their-roots album many fans had long waited for and Weezer continued that trend, with a twist, on the California kissed follow-up White Album. However, since that time Weezer had jumped around in their own history from era to era drawing on whatever past (or new) influences they wanted to for the eclectic Pacific Daydream and Black Album. They also re-entered the mainstream public’s consciousness in a major way with their fun and faithful cover of Toto’s “Africa”, which inspired a whole album of covers on the Teal Album. So, Weezer’s recent years have been busy and had a little something to make everyone happy. So, if the Weezer you know best from the later part of their career, 2014-2019, are songs like “Back To The Shack”, “Thank God For Girls”, “Feels Like Summer” and “Africa”, here are ten to hear again:\n\n“DaVinci” – From the album Everything Will Be Alright In The End\n\nFrom its cheerful whistling opening, through its poppy verses, to its melodic, yet riff-heavy chorus, “DaVinci” sounds and feels like something that Weezer would have recorded for their popular Blue or Green albums and this is on purpose. Throughout Everything Will Be Alright In The End Weezer are looking to the past to inform their present and it results in one of their strongest and most consistent albums in a long time.\n\n“Mexican Fender” – From the album Pacific Daydream\n\nWeezer had spent their recent albums trying to recreate the sound of their early career but Pacific Daydream is where they begin to mess with the formula again and “Mexican Fender” proves that it this is a good idea. “Mexican Fender” is not a radical departure from their classic (or recent neo-classic) sound as it combines the sound of 70’s power pop like Cheap Trick with 80’s pop rock like Rick Springfield to create a shiny, catchy, and radio friendly slice of pop rock that still feels like classic Weezer even though it doesn’t quite feel like it.\n\n“Wind In Our Sails” – From the album Weezer (White Album)\n\nThe second of Weezer’s neo-classical albums is the White Album, but where Everything Will Be Right In The End was pretty much unabashed revivalism on the White Album that revivalism comes with a twist. That twist is that here Weezer filter their classic sound through a sunny California, Beach Boys influenced lens to create a very loose song cycle. Here sunny harmonies and Golden State themes crop up again and again to shape this breezy, sunny set of songs that show just a hint of the darker, corrupt underbelly of California and its culture. “Wind In Our Sails” though is breezy, upbeat pop rock that could almost be a latter-day Beach Boys song that was being covered by a modern alt rock band. Of course, it’s not, it’s all Weezer, but the mix of the DNA of Weezer and the Beach Boys (and a few others) is a good combo.\n\n“Can’t Knock The Hustle” – From the album Weezer (Black Album)\n\n“Can’t Knock The Hustle” is Weezer’s stab at hip-hop inflected 70’s R&B with a dose of 90’s Latin pop and as strange as that may sound on paper it really works. “Can’t Stop The Hustle” undeniably has both a flow and toughness (albeit, with an ironic wink) that creates a warm, smooth groove. When they add in the female backing vocals and the Latin horns and flourishes it creates a modern party anthem that is also a reflection on the darker underbelly of California culture. In fact, the original vision of the Black Album was to serve as the dark and mean cousin of the White Album, serving as the thematic and tonial flip side its largely warm and breezy partner. And while that concept seems to have ultimately been dropped (too much of the Black Album doesn’t fit that narrative, not to mention they released Pacific Daydream between the two) you can hear echoes of that concept here on “Can’t Knock The Hustle”.\n\n“Jacked Up” – From the album Weezer (White Album)\n\n“Jacked Up” is an “end of summer” song, warm but sad; an ode to the end of warm days and summer flings, infused with the lonely feeling of not being quite ready to let it all go but realizing the end is coming whether your ready or not. Built off a piano riff and featuring a falsetto vocal hook from Rivers Cuomo on the chorus the song is not really the typical Weezer sound, but it never feels like anyone other than Weezer, even with its Beach Boys references and pop overtones. It’s a more quiet and reflective moment on the White Album but it is also probably my favorite moment from that album.\n\n“Go Away” – From the album Everything Will Be Alright In The End\n\n“Go Away” feels like a cross between classic Weezer (which it nails near perfectly) and a song by a 60’s girl group. A duet between Rivers Cuomo and Best Coast’s Bethany Cosentino “Go Away” tells the story of a broken relationship from both sides of the story. Cuomo’s male character apologizing and begging for a second chance after he cheated, while Cosentino’s female character tells of the hurt and jealousy she feels. Ultimately, the song ends sadly as the female character can’t forgive and move on. It’s a simple concept done literally thousands of times before but Weezer sounds fresh and the interplay between Cuomo and Cosentino really clicks. It’s my favorite track from Everything Will Be Alright In The End.\n\n“Cleopatra” – From the album Everything Will Be Alright In The End\n\n“Cleopatra” opens with some folky acoustic guitar and harmonica but this is a feint. “Cleopatra” soon morphs into a neo-classic Weezer song that falls somewhere in between the sound of the melodic and hooky arena alt rock of the Blue Album and the rougher textures of Pinkerton. The song’s best part is the faux-metal count-up on the bridge and ending which elevates the song from a really good latter-day Weezer song to one that rivals their early work.\n\n“The Prince Who Wanted Everything” – From the album Weezer (Black Album)\n\nWeezer’s Black Album was originally planned to be a darker hued, meaner rock record that showcased the corrupt side of human nature. It is a concept that pops up on the record but not one that Weezer sticks to throughout. One of the songs that breaks from that theme and concept is “The Prince Who Wanted Everything”, which is a sweet pop rock song about the perils of fame and musical stardom that may or may not be referencing the musician Prince (funk rock riffs, paisley bones, red corvette?). Either way, it is a catchy, smooth song that both ruins the original intent of the Black Album but also makes the album stronger and more diverse.\n\n“Everybody Wants To Rule The World” – From the album Weezer (Teal Album)\n\nWeezer’s Teal Album is an all covers album that featured their hit version of Toto’s “Africa”. While the album has some fun choices it is far, far too safe. That said, Weezer’s slightly heavier cover of Tears For Fears’ “Everybody Wants To Rule The World” is still a fun listen.\n\n“Any Friend Of Diane’s” – From the album Pacific Daydream\n\nWeezer seemed committed to their classic sound reboot when they threw fans a bit of a curveball with the release of the breezy, pop kissed, hip-hop touched Pacific Daydream, an album that falls somewhere in between their more rock and pop oriented efforts, but pulls back from their full on embrace of their early albums. “Any Friend Of Diane’s” is slick pop rock but it also feels very personal and direct in a way that Rivers has rarely been since Pinkerton. Personally, I also have to give love to any song that references The Smiths’ Meat Is Murder in the song as well.\n\nTen To Hear Again: Weezer, 2005-2013\n\nListen To The List: Weezer, 2005-2013 – Ten To Hear Again\n\nIf the Weezer you know best from the middle part of their career, 2005-2013, are songs like “Beverly Hills”, “Pork & Beans”, “Troublemaker” and “Memories”, here are ten to hear again (or for the first time):\n\nThe middle part of Weezer’s career was a time of trial and error for the band that has a mixed reputation with fans. I agree that the albums during this time are less consistently brilliant than early in their career, but they are far, far better than the reputation many fans have given them. During this time the band was both expanding their sound and trying to find where they fit in a world where rock had little presence with mainstream youth culture; thus Weezer flirted with hip-hop, pop, prog rock, and dance music in a way they never had before. Frontman Rivers Cuomo also allowed his bandmates opportunities to write and sing songs that made it onto albums. Thus, Weezer went into a semi-difficult middle age. However, all of the albums during this time had more than a handful of highpoints and rumors of Weezer’s demise were greatly exaggerated. So, if the Weezer you know best from the middle part of their career, 2005-2013, are songs like “Beverly Hills”, “Pork & Beans”, “Troublemaker” and “Memories”, here are ten to hear again:\n\n“The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived (Variations On A Shaker Hymn)” – From the album Weezer (Red Album)\n\n“The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived” is Weezer’s stab at a “Bohemian Rhapsody” like prog rock opus featuring multiple parts and styles. The song’s core melody and concept is based on a traditional Shaker hymn but incorporates various other styles including metal, power pop, hip-hop, piano balladry, chorale vocals, spoken word, falsetto singing, and police sirens, among other parts. It is clever, quirky, catchy, and there isn’t really anything quite like it.\n\n“Freak Me Out” – From the album Make Believe\n\n“Freak Me Out” is one of Weezer’s best quieter songs that, like so many great Weezer moments, has a sense of humor running through it. Basically, “Freak Me Out” is a melodic and atmospheric ballad (with a great harmonica break) where Rivers Cuomo recounts a time he accidentally attacked an acquaintance who scared him. The genius of the song is that while Rivers plays it off as an accident that is his fault one can tell that underneath it all he really is a little distrubed by this person. Lyrically, “Freak Me Out” walks the line between comedy and concern, while musically it is a calm and meditative number with an anxious heart.\n\n“Trainwrecks” – From the album Hurley\n\n“Trainwrecks” is one of my favorite songs from this middle part of Weezer’s career. The story of a dysfunctional couple trying to work through all of life’s hardships as well as their own personal flaws and faults (including the gloriously perfect Millennial defect that they “don’t update our blogs”). However, ultimately the song is defiant and triumphant, as they overcome their flaws to make it all work in their own dysfunctional way. Musically, the song has a chugging, building feel that mimics the sound of a train gaining speed and momentum and it perfectly fits both the title and the mood of the song.\n\n“Peace” – From the album Make Believe\n\nWeezer is generally known for their funny, quirky, and clever music, but occasionally they decide to play it straight and “Peace” is one of their best serious moments. A slice of muscular power-pop with an absolutely gorgeous melody, lyrically “Peace” was an attempt by Rivers to find meaning in his life during a time of unhappiness and chaos. Despite its power chords and fat riffs “Peace” really is a reflective and meditative song that creates an aura of calm. It is my personal favorite song from Make Believe.\n\n“Love Is The Answer” – From the album Raditude\n\n“Love Is The Answer” is another song about spiritual searching and finding meaning in love. It is also one of the songs that divides the Weezer fan base, who are divided over its irony free sentiment, slick production, and Hindi language vocals. I find the song peaceful and melodic and feel that the Hindi sections make the song standout and feel unique, while also adding to the spiritual theme of the song.\n\n“Smart Girls” – From the album Hurley\n\nThe rare song that equates female intelligence with increased sexuality and desirability, albeit not without a dose of Weezer’s trademark humor. It is catchy, riff-driven power-pop (co-written with No Doubt’s Tony Kanal). In other words classic Weezer. In fact, “Smart Girls” would have been a great single choice but, alas, it was not no be.\n\n“The Girl Got Hot” – From the album Raditude\n\n“The Girl Got Hot” is an irony-laced attempt to create a 1970’s T-Rex styled glam stomp. Big, slick, slinky, and catchy, if 70’s glam was the goal then Weezer accomplished it in spades. Nominally, “The Girl Got Hot” is a tale of a late bloomer who now catches eyes and turns heads; however a close listen to the lyrics causes one to question the credibility of the narrator, or at least wonder whether his taste lines up with that of the average guy. It’s a fun, crunchy arena stomp.\n\n“Can’t Stop Partying” – From the album Raditude\n\nOne of the most divisive songs in the Weezer canon as it is a blatant stab at a hip-hop flavored pop song that was co-written with R&B singer Jermaine Dupri and features a rap by Lil Wayne on the bridge. I think “Can’t Stop Partying” is an interesting hybrid of Weezer’s more traditional sound with newer elements that really works. It also is a powerful repudiation of the hedonistic and self-destructive lifestyle of the rock star or rapper, lacing a dark and bitter undercurrent into both the music and lyrics that undercuts the more upbeat, party anthem feel that the song otherwise would have. It may not be “classic” Weezer but it really works.\n\n“Dreamin’” – From the album Weezer (Red Album)\n\n“Dreamin’” feels like a fusion of classic Weezer and Beach Boys flavored melody and harmony. Indeed, it feels like a midpoint between Weezer’s early career surf rock song “Surf Wax USA” and many of the songs on their later California/Beach Boys inspired White Album. The song even has an unexpected twist of a finish that suddenly shifts from Beach Boys harmonies to a brief, almost metal riff-driven conclusion.\n\n“Represent” – From the single Represent\n\nWritten by the band to be the theme song for U.S. Soccer during the 2010 World Cup, “Represent” has a big, rocking, singalong chorus that embeds itself in your head and stays there. The guitars roar and the drums crash and the whole thing could have been a triumphant anthem for American soccer and a hit for Weezer (think the American equivalent of New Order’s English soccer anthem “World In Motion”) as well. The only problem was that the American team had a fairly lackluster showing that sort of made the need for an anthem moot. Still, a great song though.\n\nTen To Hear Again: Weezer, 1994-2004\n\nListen To The List: Weezer, 1994-2004 – Ten To Hear Again\n\nIf the Weezer you know best from the early part of their career, 1994-2004, are songs like “Buddy Holly”, “Island In The Sun”, “Hash Pipe” and “Undone-The Sweater Song”, here are ten to hear again (or for the first time):\n\nWeezer is a band that likely never would have found a mainstream audience without the 1990’s alternative rock explosion, but they were also perfectly suited to crossover once that scene was set. A combination of alt rock sensibilities, power pop hooks, and classic rock posturing all sifted through a dose of irony that was informed by a true love for the “uncool” rock of the past, Weezer found themselves almost overnight successes – the right band at the right time. And then things fell apart. Following the indie pop/metal poses of their debut, the band wrote and recorded Pinkerton, a harder edged and more chaotic rock album that was really a singer/songwriter record at heart, and found little commercial favor. Weezer didn’t know what to do next. The band abandoned the space opera project that was to be their third album and went on an extended (ultimately 8 year) hiatus: Members started families and formed other groups, bassist Matt Sharp left permanently while bandleader Rivers Cuomo went to Harvard and then to a Buddhist monastery. Weezer seemed finished. However, time was kind to Pinkerton and to Weezer and the reputation of both improved and then grew to almost legendary status, so Weezer tentatively came back together. After a string of shows proved there was indeed a huge audience waiting for more Weezer, the group found a new bassist, withdrew to the pop-metal sounds of their debut and put out two more superb and commercially successful albums in the early 00’s that revived their career completely and proved they were both a working band again and master craftsmen of pop/rock. So, if the Weezer you know best from the early part of their career, 1994-2004, are songs like “Buddy Holly”, “Island In The Sun”, “Hash Pipe” and “Undone-The Sweater Song”, here are ten to hear again:\n\n“My Name Is Jonas” – From the album Weezer (Blue Album)\n\n“My Name Is Jonas” kicked off Weezer’s debut eponymous record (ultimately subtitled the Blue Album) and finds the band firing on all cylinders from the start. “My Name Is Jonas” is a perfect marriage of metal riffing, power pop hooks, indie rock artiness, and Weezer’s sense of humor. One can’t tell for sure whether it’s a stab at irony or a loving homage to the music of another era and that is both its genius and charm.\n\n“The World Has Turned And Left Me Here” – From the album Weezer (Blue Album)\n\nWhile Weezer, deservedly to some degree, earned a reputation as both ironic hipsters and juvenile jokesters, the band could (and often did) play it fairly straight. One of the best early examples of this is the hard rock heartbreak of “The World Has Turned And Left Me Here”. The guitar riffs roar like 70’s arena gods, the bass rumbles like 90’s grunge, and Rivers sings like a teenager who has suffered his first real heartache – inspiring hundreds of emo bands to come a decade later. “The World Has Turned And Left Me Here” is an underrated and somewhat pivotal song in the alt rock canon.\n\n“Love Explosion” – From the album Maladroit\n\nWeezer’s fourth album Maladroit was the second album of their early 00’s comeback and, in some ways, served the same role to the Green Album that Pinkerton had played to the Blue Album, namely it was harder edged and a little less pop-oriented than its successful predecessor. That said, Maladroit lacks the personal and emotional heart that Pinkerton had, and was really more a midpoint between Weezer’s two poles. “Love Explosion”, buried very deep on the album, is perhaps the song that most tries to find that same midpoint between Weezer’s heavier, harsher sound and the hook-laden power pop that had fueled most of their hits and does a fine job of pulling off this feat.\n\n“Don’t Let Go” – From the album Weezer (Green Album)\n\n“Don’t Let Go”, the opening track to Weezer’s comeback album – the Green Album – could be the very definition of power pop. The guitars churn out fat riffs layered in distortion and the drums crack, but none of this noise hides the candy sweet melody underneath it or the simple, yet catchy, “ooh-woah-woahs” of the chorus. Indeed, “Don’t Let Go” was a statement of purpose that now that Weezer was back they would look to the hook-laden and happier Blue Album rather than the darker and more personal Pinkerton as their guiding star, a decision that has guided the band’s work, more or less, ever since that time.\n\n“Crab” – From the album Weezer (Green Album)\n\nLike so many great Weezer songs “Crab” combines almost heavy metal riffing with sweet power pop hooks to create a delightful Frankenstein’s monster of rock elements. I especially have always loved the ascending vocal part on the chorus with lends the song just a touch of desperation. I still believe “Crab” could have been a hit single if it had been released.\n\n“Take Control” – From the album Maladroit\n\nI’ve never been certain if it’s a real connection or if it’s in my head but Maladroit’s “Take Control” has always felt like a harder rocking, sister-song to the Green Album’s “Crab”. They seem to have a similar melody on the chorus and a similarity to the vocal part as well that I have always found appealing. Whether others can hear that connection or not doesn’t change the fact “Take Control” is a pummelling, almost dark rocker with a beautiful and melodic pop center and is one of the best tracks on the very underrated Maladroit.\n\n“Getchoo” – From the album Pinkerton\n\n“Getchoo” is Pinkerton in a nutshell. Weezer still has both a sense of humor and pop inclinations, but the sense of humor is dark and bitter and the pop inclinations are buried in harder edges, fuzzy and chaotic production, and an overall feeling that the fun of the Blue Album has given way to a slightly manic insanity. While Pinkerton had a core of fans from the start (I always loved it more than the Blue Album, it is still my favorite Weezer album, and “El Scorcho” is still my favorite Weezer song) it didn’t reach the masses like the Blue Album did. While it is not shockingly different than the Blue Album really, it is definitely more personal, more frenzied, and much meaner in sound and spirit. Thus, while I can see why it wasn’t as big a commercial success as its predecessor, I find its critical and commercial rejection at the time to be baffling as well. “Getchoo”, and the album more generally, is less slick, obvious, and open-hearted, but it is by no means a repudiation of what came before or a complete change. Luckily, both critics and fans have come around.\n\n“Simple Pages” – From the album Weezer (Green Album)\n\nNot sure why, as nothing about “Simple Pages” really stands out or sounds that different than several other Weezer songs, but it has always been a personal favorite from the Green Album. It is a little more gritty than most of the other songs on the Green Album and points the way toward Maladroit to some degree so possibly that sets it apart a little, although I like Weezer’s pop songs too. Not really sure why I like it so much, but here it is for you as a superb deep track.\n\n“In The Garage” – From the album Weezer (Blue Album)\n\nFew songs capture the carefree spirit and innocence of youth, especially nerdy, teenage male youth, better than “In The Garage”. Rivers and company sing about their escape from a world of parents and bullies to a refuge of friends, cheesy rock, and role-playing games with an earnestness that saves the song from being an ironic rip and instead turns it into a loving homage to a place and time of safety and simplicity.\n\n“Butterfly” – From the album Pinkerton\n\nThe closing track from Pinkerton, “Butterfly” is very likely Weezer’s most vulnerable and intimate moment. In truth, “Butterfly” is a folky, singer/songwriter ballad in the style of the 70’s that borrows from the story of the opera Madame Butterfly (as does the album’s title) that Rivers Cuomo uses as a metaphor for a personal relationship crisis he was going through. The lyrics are brutally self-damning and the pained emotion in Rivers’ voice is heartbreakingly real. “Butterfly” sounds different than the rest of the album (and indeed almost Weezer’s entire discography) but it feels of a piece with the bitterness and emotional bloodletting that the rest of Pinkerton evokes. Weezer would never sound this raw and unvarnished again, which is both too bad, because “Butterfly” is so good, and part of what makes this song such a special moment in the band’s canon. The closing refrain of “I’m sorry” can still bring me to tears it’s so haunted and sad."
