        "text": "Ten To Hear Again: Weezer, 2005-2013\n\nListen To The List: Weezer, 2005-2013 – Ten To Hear Again\n\nIf the Weezer you know best from the middle part of their career, 2005-2013, are songs like “Beverly Hills”, “Pork & Beans”, “Troublemaker” and “Memories”, here are ten to hear again (or for the first time):\n\nThe middle part of Weezer’s career was a time of trial and error for the band that has a mixed reputation with fans. I agree that the albums during this time are less consistently brilliant than early in their career, but they are far, far better than the reputation many fans have given them. During this time the band was both expanding their sound and trying to find where they fit in a world where rock had little presence with mainstream youth culture; thus Weezer flirted with hip-hop, pop, prog rock, and dance music in a way they never had before. Frontman Rivers Cuomo also allowed his bandmates opportunities to write and sing songs that made it onto albums. Thus, Weezer went into a semi-difficult middle age. However, all of the albums during this time had more than a handful of highpoints and rumors of Weezer’s demise were greatly exaggerated. So, if the Weezer you know best from the middle part of their career, 2005-2013, are songs like “Beverly Hills”, “Pork & Beans”, “Troublemaker” and “Memories”, here are ten to hear again:\n\n“The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived (Variations On A Shaker Hymn)” – From the album Weezer (Red Album)\n\n“The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived” is Weezer’s stab at a “Bohemian Rhapsody” like prog rock opus featuring multiple parts and styles. The song’s core melody and concept is based on a traditional Shaker hymn but incorporates various other styles including metal, power pop, hip-hop, piano balladry, chorale vocals, spoken word, falsetto singing, and police sirens, among other parts. It is clever, quirky, catchy, and there isn’t really anything quite like it.\n\n“Freak Me Out” – From the album Make Believe\n\n“Freak Me Out” is one of Weezer’s best quieter songs that, like so many great Weezer moments, has a sense of humor running through it. Basically, “Freak Me Out” is a melodic and atmospheric ballad (with a great harmonica break) where Rivers Cuomo recounts a time he accidentally attacked an acquaintance who scared him. The genius of the song is that while Rivers plays it off as an accident that is his fault one can tell that underneath it all he really is a little distrubed by this person. Lyrically, “Freak Me Out” walks the line between comedy and concern, while musically it is a calm and meditative number with an anxious heart.\n\n“Trainwrecks” – From the album Hurley\n\n“Trainwrecks” is one of my favorite songs from this middle part of Weezer’s career. The story of a dysfunctional couple trying to work through all of life’s hardships as well as their own personal flaws and faults (including the gloriously perfect Millennial defect that they “don’t update our blogs”). However, ultimately the song is defiant and triumphant, as they overcome their flaws to make it all work in their own dysfunctional way. Musically, the song has a chugging, building feel that mimics the sound of a train gaining speed and momentum and it perfectly fits both the title and the mood of the song.\n\n“Peace” – From the album Make Believe\n\nWeezer is generally known for their funny, quirky, and clever music, but occasionally they decide to play it straight and “Peace” is one of their best serious moments. A slice of muscular power-pop with an absolutely gorgeous melody, lyrically “Peace” was an attempt by Rivers to find meaning in his life during a time of unhappiness and chaos. Despite its power chords and fat riffs “Peace” really is a reflective and meditative song that creates an aura of calm. It is my personal favorite song from Make Believe.\n\n“Love Is The Answer” – From the album Raditude\n\n“Love Is The Answer” is another song about spiritual searching and finding meaning in love. It is also one of the songs that divides the Weezer fan base, who are divided over its irony free sentiment, slick production, and Hindi language vocals. I find the song peaceful and melodic and feel that the Hindi sections make the song standout and feel unique, while also adding to the spiritual theme of the song.\n\n“Smart Girls” – From the album Hurley\n\nThe rare song that equates female intelligence with increased sexuality and desirability, albeit not without a dose of Weezer’s trademark humor. It is catchy, riff-driven power-pop (co-written with No Doubt’s Tony Kanal). In other words classic Weezer. In fact, “Smart Girls” would have been a great single choice but, alas, it was not no be.\n\n“The Girl Got Hot” – From the album Raditude\n\n“The Girl Got Hot” is an irony-laced attempt to create a 1970’s T-Rex styled glam stomp. Big, slick, slinky, and catchy, if 70’s glam was the goal then Weezer accomplished it in spades. Nominally, “The Girl Got Hot” is a tale of a late bloomer who now catches eyes and turns heads; however a close listen to the lyrics causes one to question the credibility of the narrator, or at least wonder whether his taste lines up with that of the average guy. It’s a fun, crunchy arena stomp.\n\n“Can’t Stop Partying” – From the album Raditude\n\nOne of the most divisive songs in the Weezer canon as it is a blatant stab at a hip-hop flavored pop song that was co-written with R&B singer Jermaine Dupri and features a rap by Lil Wayne on the bridge. I think “Can’t Stop Partying” is an interesting hybrid of Weezer’s more traditional sound with newer elements that really works. It also is a powerful repudiation of the hedonistic and self-destructive lifestyle of the rock star or rapper, lacing a dark and bitter undercurrent into both the music and lyrics that undercuts the more upbeat, party anthem feel that the song otherwise would have. It may not be “classic” Weezer but it really works.\n\n“Dreamin’” – From the album Weezer (Red Album)\n\n“Dreamin’” feels like a fusion of classic Weezer and Beach Boys flavored melody and harmony. Indeed, it feels like a midpoint between Weezer’s early career surf rock song “Surf Wax USA” and many of the songs on their later California/Beach Boys inspired White Album. The song even has an unexpected twist of a finish that suddenly shifts from Beach Boys harmonies to a brief, almost metal riff-driven conclusion.\n\n“Represent” – From the single Represent\n\nWritten by the band to be the theme song for U.S. Soccer during the 2010 World Cup, “Represent” has a big, rocking, singalong chorus that embeds itself in your head and stays there. The guitars roar and the drums crash and the whole thing could have been a triumphant anthem for American soccer and a hit for Weezer (think the American equivalent of New Order’s English soccer anthem “World In Motion”) as well. The only problem was that the American team had a fairly lackluster showing that sort of made the need for an anthem moot. Still, a great song though."
