        "text": "It’s clear on Lil Wayne’s long-awaited and much-anticipated “Tha Carter III,” that he’s taken on the burden of saving commercial hip-hop.\n\nHe’s also assumed responsibility for saving New Orleans, creativity in music ” everyone and everything, really, except for himself.\n\nAs he’s proven on countless mix tapes and his two full-lengths before this one, Lil Wayne (aka Dwayne Michael Carter, aka Weezy) is more than apt for that first mission. The other ones, well, we’ll see.\n\nBut as far as being a constant source of rhymes that are smarter, more self-aware, more playful and more complex than anything else coming off the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart, ” where “Tha Carter III” claims three of 10 spots ” Lil Wayne was and is there.\n\nHe does this by cramming his verses with wordplay: “I got game like EA,” “Blind eyes can look at me and see the truth / Wonder if Stevie do,” “I call ’em April babies, because they fools.”\n\nBy making us listen close to catch it all, Wayne puts himself on a level with Jay-Z, Ghostface Killah, Kanye West and heavies like The Notorious B.I.G. and 2Pac ” a level where songs stop being entirely about cash and money, and start being about the people singing them.\n\nDefinitely, “Tha Carter III” is about party rap and cars and sex and being the next big thing. But it’s also about Wayne’s inability to maintain relationships, his despair over Hurricane Katrina. It’s all over the place and it doesn’t always make sense from track to track.\n\nAnd that’s what makes Lil Wayne so interesting: he doesn’t care if his records make sense to you. It’s not all brilliant, and it’s not nearly as substantial as anything going on in the underground hip-hop world. But it is significantly meatier and more involved than anything else in its league, and it’s plenty of justification for Wayne to keep feeling like he’s hip-hop’s next legend.\n\nIn a commercial for “Viva la Vida,” the fourth Coldplay studio release, Chris Martin makes this hand gesture. It’s sort of halfway between a fist pump and a desperate grabbing for air. It tows the line between rocking out and reaching for a high note on a power ballad. It says, “I have something to say, but I’d rather just stand here and croon. Also, there will be piano, and perhaps some synthesized strings.”\n\nEverything you need to know about Coldplay, everything that has ever been expressed in any of the band’s songs, is contained in this hand gesture. There’s a tepid quality to all of it, a palette of wishy-washy emotions that aren’t especially deep or universal, a background that’s as ignorable as it is listenable.\n\nNow, I like Coldplay. But I wish I didn’t. I find most of their songs empty and uninteresting. But I also find them incredibly easy to listen to, and so I listen to them.\n\nAll the tracks on “Viva la Vida” fit that mold, except that they’re not nearly as engaging as anything on “Parachutes,” and they’re not as sonically dynamic as anything on “A Rush of Blood to the Head.”\n\nThe title track drags and feels insincere. Album opener “Life in Technicolor” works as a diet rock instrumental, and not as much else. “Lost!” has the unfortunate opening line, “Just because I’m losing, doesn’t mean I’m lost,” but it also has handclaps (which makes it better). “Yes” is just impossibly drony, and is seven minutes long.\n\n“Violet Hill” is a decent piano ballad, and is a workable lead-in to the album’s somewhat stronger final act, ending in the genuinely good “Death and All His Friends.” It’s all very pretty, and it’s all supported by expert Brian Eno production.\n\nIf you like Coldplay, which most people do at least a little bit, ” because seriously, why not? ” “Viva la Vida” won’t be anything special, but it will be worth listening to.\n\nThere are people who say “Pinkerton” is Weezer’s best album.\n\nAt least as far as songwriting goes, those people are right. But they’re not really fans of Weezer, a band that has reveled in its own blissfully ironic, pop-drenched stupidity since releasing its first self-titled CD in 1994.\n\nSince that first outing ” which was, by the way, pretty much brilliant ” Weezer mastermind Rivers Cuomo has been increasingly and unapologetically indulging a love for 1970s and ’80s power metal, blanketing his songs in an ultimate cheesiness that even his source material can’t match.\n\nAt first, this was charming, especially when Cuomo tempered 2002’s mostly metal “Maladroit” with straight-ahead pop on his next release, 2005’s “Make Believe” (producer of the ubiquitous and ultra-catchy “Beverly Hills”).\n\nToo bad for Cuomo, and for everyone who listens to his band’s third self-titled release, that approach is not charming any more.\n\nThe color-coded and often irritating “Red Album” kicks off in old-fashioned Weezer style with “Troublemaker,” a simple, self-aggrandizing rocker. Cuomo has long had a reputation for being evasive and not actually liking himself, so the cocksure swagger of the opener falls right in line with what Weezer fans fell in love with.\n\nHe keeps the joke fresh with “The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn),” a multi-genre rock opera that uses a Shaker melody to travel backward through every pop music movement of the last three decades. If that journey didn’t start in 1998, with rap rock, this song would be very good. As is, it’s just mildly interesting ” which sets it apart from the rest of the “Red Album,” and makes it, the second track, the last one worth listening to.\n\nAfter that, the cheery irony of a one-time nerd rocker embracing his hair metal roots wears too thin to bear."
