        "text": "Formed in L.A. in the early 1990s, Grammy-winning rock band Weezer have dropped six successful full-length albums over the course of their musical career.\n\nThe band owe much of their rise to mainstream success two award-winning music videos -- \"Undone - The Sweater Song\" and the Happy Days-themed \"Buddy Holly\" -- directed by Spike Jonze. And while alt-flavored pop punk songs like \"Pork and Beans,\" \"Beverly Hills,\" and \"Perfect Situation\" have come to define them, Rivers Cuomo and the gang have crossed genre lines and even toyed with rap on their latest release, The Red Album.\n\nNow, Weezer are about to release their unique brand of nerd rock on Guitar Hero 5 -- \"Why Bother?\" is their featured track. With that in mind, we're counting down the group's greatest albums from worst to best. Check it out.\n\n#6: Maladroit\n\nRiding the success of The Green Album, Weezer gave their fans the benefit of the doubt and conceived Maladroit, an interactive meeting-of-the-minds. Throughout late 2001 and early 2002, Rivers Cuomo collaborated with those who idolized him, accepting suggestions from the online masses ranging from chord progressions to which songs should appear on this, their fourth LP. When the resultant album finally dropped, the fans were pleased to learn that their input had been heeded. They were not so pleased to hear, however, that the album was weak.\n\nContaining 13 songs bound together by neither theme nor aesthetic, Maladroit came off as a compilation of B-sides. Ironically, the songs that didn't make the cut are the A-sides… \"Living Without You,\" \"Sandwiches Time,\" et. al. Instead we got the songs we decided were good, played the way we wanted them -- and, unsurprisingly, the final product was not Weezer, but rather some twisted vision of what we wanted Weezer to be.\n\n#5: Make Believe\n\nThis is Weezer's ballad album. \"Hold Me\" and \"The Damage In Your Heart\" represent some of frontman Rivers Cuomo's most stirring vocal. \"Peace\" and \"Pardon Me\" reflect upon Cuomo's ongoing searches, borne from his life-changing venture into Vipassana meditation. And the record concludes with the heart-wrenching \"Haunt You Every Day.\"\n\nBelieve offers heart and soul, but there's still room for that trademark Weezer whimsy. The ubiquitous single \"Beverly Hills\" opens the disc, replete with the bouncy pop and infectious hooks mirrored later in the novel \"We Are All On Drugs.\" \"Perfect Situation\" is classic Blue, complete with romantic self-depreciation; more self-regard awaits on the catchy, hand-clap-equipped \"The Other Way.\" \"This Is Such A Pity\" is an insanely addictive, synth-fueled Cars tribute.\n\nWhile Believe contains no \"throwaway\" tracks, the lyrics are generally less accomplished than they were a decade ago. Nothing too deep here, and that's what makes this album, while solid, a slight disappointment.\n\n#4: Weezer (The Green Album) Weezer's 2001 comeback clocks in at a lean 28 minutes. And with nary a guitar solo in sight, Green is as spartan as power-pop gets. It followed a hiatus of tremendous length and was the lynchpin in whether old Weezer followers would take the band back while newcoming interlopers assessed Rivers Cuomo's undeniable gift for pop melody. Of course, it was a smashing success, but we as Weezer fans are perpetually malcontent and many of us have resented this candy-coated nugget at one time or another.\n\n\"Don't Let Go\" kicks off a decalogy of songs, any one of which could have been a successful single. Generic lyrics about love supplement golden melodies; Green pleases the ear more than the brain. If you can divorce yourself from pretension and accept cotton candy for what it is, you'll get a hell of a lot of mileage out of Green. It's a pile of above-average songs by a great band. That's either agreeable to you or it isn't.\n\n#3: Weezer (The Red Album) The Red Album is totally bizarre, very experimental, and a hell of a lot of fun. It's a rock album, sure, but barely – it's power-pop first and foremost, and a lot of it… is rap. Rivers Cuomo surprised fans by rapping on three of the tracks. It's bad, but Cuomo knows it's bad and that makes it charming enough to purge from listeners' minds the utter vapidity of Make Believe's most benign tracks.\n\n\"Troublemaker,\" the record's opening track, is catchy (the pseudo-solo, accompanied by Cuomo spitting \"Wa-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na,\" is its highest point). \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\" is a schizophrenic, six-minute roller-coaster of 10 movements, few of which are longer than 30 seconds -- certainly the most curious song to leak from Cuomo's pen, and it is the runaway star of an equally spastic album. The most Weezer-y song on the record is the five-minute \"Dreamin',\" a pure pop treat that, like \"Greatest Man,\" cobbles together a series of sections that work together, fortunately, more often than not.\n\n#2: Pinkerton Pinkerton is a mess. But not in a bad way. It's a relentless deluge of distorted guitars and high-hat cymbals. Compared to the crisp, clean-cut pop of Weezer's eponymous debut, Pinkerton is a madman's demo tape. The band most certainly had not delivered more of the same -- when \"the same\" was precisely what many fans wanted. And while initial response to the record was mixed, now we know better.\n\nSomewhere between the beautiful noise of \"Tired of Sex\" and the delicate acoustics of \"Butterfly\" lay the underpinnings of the magnum opus of a band sent from the heavens to help quell the pain of Kurt's exit. Buoyed by singles \"el Scorcho,\" \"The Good Life,\" and thirsty-Thursday anthem \"Pink Triangle,\" Pinkerton excels at everything, yet does it in a shy, insecure, practically self-hating way. Its fanbase relates.\n\n#1: Weezer (The Blue Album)\n\nWhile Pinkerton is held by many to be their best record, nothing comes close to the simple brilliance of the original Weezer album (aka The Blue Album). With nary a bad track, this debut effort still sounds great a decade and a half after it's initial release.\n\nIt starts strong with the heartfelt \"My Name is Jonas\" and doesn't let up once as it rolls through all of its ten classic tracks. \"Say it Ain't So\" is probably the best offering, but the entire recording is packed with irresistible hook-laden melodies that will have you singing along. \"Surf Wax America,\" \"Buddy Holly\" and \"Undone (The Sweater Song)\" are about as catchy as songs can be. But catchy isn't necessarily enough… that's why songs like \"No One Else\" are here. \"I want a girl who laughs for no one else.\" Brilliant.\n\nWhat's your take on Weezer's best records?
