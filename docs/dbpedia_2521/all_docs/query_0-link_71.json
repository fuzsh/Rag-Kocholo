        "text": "Happy Monday!\n\nA friend asked me recently, \"What's the best album ever produced?\"\n\nWithout hesitation: Spirit's The Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus.\n\nHere it is on Apple Music - this is the best sounding online version of it. The original album is the first 12 songs.\n\nHere it is on Spotify. Again, first 12 songs.\n\nHere's it on YouTube, which doesn't do its sonic quality justice. Again. The first 12 songs are the original album.\n\nListen to it on Apple Music or Spotify. YouTube breaks the songs with commercials and the album was designed to flow from song to song with no breaks.\n\nTake 40 minutes out of your life and listen. Good speakers or headphones!\n\nSued by Led Zeppelin, Buddies with Hendrix\n\nSome of you might know this album and band. Most of you don't. These were the guys involved in a lawsuit with Led Zeppelin a few years back. It was alleged that the opening of Stairway to Heaven was nicked from this.\n\nSpirit was formed by guitarist Randy California, real last name \"Wolfe.\" Jimi Hendrix gave him the nickname \"California\" to differentiate him from another guitar player Hendrix nicknamed Randy Texas.\n\nIt's 1967, Randy Wolfe is 15, playing with Jimi Hendrix, when Hendrix gets invited to England by Chas Chandler. Young Randy's parents won't let him go. Hendrix goes to England to become HENDRIX, Randy goes back to California.\n\nRandy's stepdad was a West Coast jazz drummer named Ed Cassidy, who was rocking the shaved head look before anyone. They formed Spirit with jazz keyboardist John Locke, and then added bassist Mark Andes (later a member of Heart during its MTV days) and singer/multi-instrumentalist Jay Ferguson. They released their first album when Randy California was 17.\n\nSpirit was a genre all to themselves. Psychedelic prog rock with heavy pop and environmentalist overtones, perhaps? They had a minor hit with \"I Got a Line on You.\" They never sold a lot of records. This happens when there isn't a firm angle on genre for marketing. How do you promote albums with jazz instrumentals, pop tunes, songs sung in Hebrew, songs about pollution, etc.? The record label couldn't figure it out either.\n\nThe 12 Dream of Dr Sardonicus: How to Produce a Record\n\nThe 12 Dreams of Dr Sardonicus was Spirit's 4th album. It charted poorly on release in 1970.\n\nEvery individual song is great, and unlike anything else on the album, even though the songs quote moments from each other at times. The playing and singing is fantastic. The recording - done in Sunset Sound's studio 1 on a custom API console, is fantastic by the standards of the times and by the standards of today.\n\nThe production was by Randy California and David Briggs. Briggs is best known for working with Neil Young. As Briggs describes it: \"When people ask 'You produce Neil Young?' I'm not ashamed to say 'Only the best albums.'\"\n\nSo Much to Hear... and Steal!\n\nJust the panning of things on Sardonicus is amazing. Parts bounce around from speaker to speaker. Voices stack and talk to each other. Even a tambourine becomes a relegation. Songs don't fade out; they slip away into reverb, moving away from the listener into another space, and then returning as a different song. I don't think anyone has yet made a record that takes such advantage of movement as Spirit.\n\nSongs have different textures, grooves, colors and sounds from slide guitars to one of the earliest uses of a Moog synth. Vocals peak into mixes from radios or telephones, recorded backward and turned into choruses of creatures. There's string sections, horn sections, bongos, sound effects of traffic, tractors and cats, lyrics about love, nature, hippie stuff, capitalism...\n\nIt's an insane mix of elements.\n\nAnd it utterly works, because every decision is in service of the song.\n\nThe running order has a narrative arc to it. It seems to be about something, but you can't put your finger on it. The title is from a 1961 horror movie. California had an initial thought the record was a sci-fi adventure, and some of the song titles come from that, but it's a concept record mostly in execution and not in theme.\n\nWhatever. It's how you make a record.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nThere was tremendous creative tension between Randy California and Jay Ferguson. The classic lineup of Spirit broke up after Sardonicus. There were various forms of Spirit and Randy California after that. Jay Ferguson formed an insipid pop band called Jo Jo Gunne. He became a very successful film and TV composer. He wrote television's equivalent of a platinum record, this thing here.\n\nRandy California drowned in 1997. His son was caught in a riptide while the two were swimming in Hawaii. Randy pushed the boy to safety but couldn't manage it for himself.\n\nEd Cassidy outlived his stepson, dying at 89. Keyboardist John Locke played up until his death at 62. Mark Andes is semi-retired but still plays.\n\nI've been listening to the 12 Dreams of Dr Sardonicus since 1982. It still blows my mind. I'm writing this while listening to it. It sorta kills me that I'll never produce a record as good as this one. But it's a good pain.\n\nWhat do you think is the best album ever produced? Huge and somewhat dumb question, but I'd love to hear your answers, and hear what you're all listening to.\n\nHave a great week. Make some music!\n\nHappy Monday,\n\nSingers and singing today, and minimalist arrangements. And a scene from a great movie.\n\nStart here. Headphones or earbuds are perhaps preferred. There are such little things to hear.\n\nIt begins and perhaps it’s a heartbeat, but maybe a clock? Or dripping water?\n\nThere’s a rhythm that's perhaps the track noise of a vinyl LP, like the record has ended but it’s stuck in the runout groove, and no one is getting up to lift the needle.\n\nA voice drifts in, singing words that don’t matter. They’re just sounds to be sung, stretched into shapes.\n\nThe song never fleshes itself out beyond a harpsichord, a few piano chords, and a wet, ghostly choir.\n\nTrip-Hop Masterpiece\n\nThe singer, Elizabeth Fraser, hits a high point at about 4 minutes. And then it all drifts away, on that constant, watery pulse, stuck in that runout groove.\n\nTeardrop is a definitive statement in trip-hop. It’s a sad masterpiece in a genre that’s bleak to begin with.\n\nFraser came up with the words while working with Massive Attack in the studio. She had just heard about the accidental death of her former lover, American singer Jeff Buckley. She thinks the song is about him, about loss.\n\nJeff Buckley Died Too Soon\n\nJeff Buckley was blessed with a once-in-a-generation voice. The guy could sing your To-Do list and make it sound like a love letter.\n\nAlthough he too bends words into sounds and shapes, Buckley never loses grip on the meaning of lyrics. He digs in deeper, turning into a character delivering a monologue.\n\nCase in point is his rendition of Lilac Wine. Listen here.\n\nLilac Wine was written in 1950 by James Shelton. It’s been recorded by many artists, but Jeff Buckley’s version is like watching a drunk talking to himself before passing out.\n\nThe production and the mix is by Andy Wallace. Listen for a kick, so low and large that it’s more of an exhale than a drum, and gorgeous shimmers of reverb. Wallace’s basic rig was an SSL 4000 console and a Lexicon 480L reverb, and not much else.\n\nAt 3:20 the band drops out and the narrator has an epiphany or a hallucination, and then resumes drinking. As the song ends he seems to pass out, climbing a vocal staircase to heaven. An angelic ending.\n\nBuckley drowned in 1997. His breakthrough hit—a Billboard #1—was his cover of Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah, 10 years after his death.\n\nAside from a love affair, Elizabeth Fraser and Jeff Buckley are connected by influences: especially Nina Simone.\n\nNina Simone\n\nNina Simone: a classically trained pianist with a one octave growl of a voice, perfect pitch, and a penchant for not wanting to do what other people do.\n\nShe doesn’t have a pretty voice like Fraser and Buckley. Hers is ungainly and raw, but it works tremendously well. And it doesn’t matter the language, either. She’s a wonderful actress and always gets it across.\n\nListen here to Ne me quitte pas. You can ignore the lyrics. All you need is the title in English: Don't leave me.\n\nA cabaret tune by Jaques Brel, about a desperate lover, perhaps suicidal. Cut in 1965, this sounds live in-the-studio, with everyone in the room and Nina Simone in a booth rather than where she usually was, behind a piano.\n\nIf Lou Reed is the patron saint of singers who can’t sing, Nina Simone is the devil on your shoulder saying, “Screw it. Sing anyway. You’ll be fine.\"\n\nLet’s slam this all together. All this love and loss, singing and acting.\n\nA Great French Thriller\n\nTell No One (Ne le dis à personne) is a French thriller from 2006. If you’re looking for a movie to blow your mind and heart open, it’s highly recommended.\n\nFor eight years, Dr. Alexandre Beck has been limping through life, devastated by the horrific murder of his wife. He and Margot were in love even as children.\n\nWatch a brief sequence from it here.\n\nAll that without a word of dialog.\n\nAfter this scene he gets an email... from his dead wife! Or is she dead?\n\nSee the movie and find out!\n\nNew Monday #24\n\nThis is the 24th New Monday, written to inspire you to think about audio and recording as an artist and not a mechanic. Ai is here. We have only our humanity to hold the fort.\n\nWhat Ai cannot do is figure out how to take love and loss and make something wonderful out of it.\n\nWe have tons of great stuff happening. More later!\n\nThe Guys at Korneff Audio\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nCheck it out: our friend Malcom Owen-Flood, who is a wonderful engineer and location sound expert, made a video using our Echoleffe Tape Delay. Have a look, give Malcom some love, etc.\n\nONWARD and UPWARD into SPACE!\n\nJuly 20th, 1969, some of us heard this or saw it on TV.\n\nI saw it. I was 6?\n\nIn an effort to capitalize on the event, this was released on July 11th, 1969. Listen. Just sit there and listen.\n\nYou’ve heard this a million times but it remains a simply stunning recording, like nothing anyone had heard at the time and it still sounds startling and fresh 50+ years later.\n\nIt didn’t sell especially well, but it did on subsequent re-releases, and now... it’s one of the great songs and certainly one of the great productions in the rock canon.\n\nSpace Oddity was the lead single on Bowie’s second solo album, which was produced by the legendary Tony Visconti. However, Visconti thought Space Oddity was a novelty song, and while he produced the album, he passed the single off to engineer producer Gus Dudgeon.\n\nDudgeon LOVED the song and he and Bowie planned out its expensive and complex arrangement, which features a rhythm section, a mellotron, a string ensemble, and a wacky little electronic instrument called a Stylophone, which was basically an oscillator controlled by moving a little metal pen (stylus) across an engraved keyboard. The stylophone was on Bowie’s original demo of Space Oddity, and in the finished recording you can hear it behind the 12 guitar - it sounds like an oboe - and more obviously in a descending line here. Bowie played both 12-string and the stylophone, as well as performing all the vocals.\n\nWayne, Herbie and Terry\n\nI’ve always loved the lead guitar parts on this, played by Mick Wayne. This sound here, and similar moments scattered about the recording, are him screwing around with the tuning of his guitar’s strings — a studio accident. Wayne was tuning it and hooked both Dudgeon and Bowie by the ear.\n\nOf course, it wouldn’t be an interesting record from this time if Herbie Flowers wasn’t the bassist. His basslines are so fluid and melodic, and typical of his playing, somehow catchy and memorable. This line here at the start of the bridge is so killer, weaving in and out of the vocals and the flutes.\n\nThe drummer on Space Oddity is a guy named Terry Cox. He’s clearly a jazz drummer, occasionally keeping a simple beat but often providing more drama and dynamics than just time keeping. He was a member of Pentangle, which was perhaps prog rock before even King Crimson. Pentangle played a mix of traditional English folk music and jazz. Check out the opening drum riff of this live recording. Has anyone sampled this yet? This sounds like the great grandmother of Massive Attack. Or maybe it sounds more like Teardrop, especially in the vocals.\n\nThe interplay between guitar, bass and drums, and then vocal, mellotron, and string section, is probably something that could never be programmed or created with AI. Listen to the absolute looseness of this vamp out, and how all the parts weave around each other, especially Herbie and Terry.\n\nGus Dudgeon\n\nGus Dudgeon went on to a big career, working with Elton John during his heyday — from 'Madman Across the Water' to 'Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy', and yes, Dudgeon produced 'Goodbye Yellowbrick Road'. He’s also credited with using the first “sample” — a drum loop on this. He worked with XTC, Joan Armatrading, The Beach Boys...\n\nHe also produced Mott the Hoople! This is a personal fave, and it has the best 5 note guitar solo anyone ever cut.\n\nMott does have a Bowie-esque sound. It’s probably because they had broken up when Bowie heard about it, offered to produce an album and give them a song. They took him up on it and got their first hit.\n\nThe hit Bowie gave them, All the Young Dudes, is one of those songs everyone has heard but few know the title of it. It’s easily one of Bowie’s best songs. And he just gave it away.\n\nSo... we leave the glam for a while. Please feel free to write in and toss me ideas about what might happen next on a New Monday.\n\nHappy Monday, all\n\nSO... you’ve heard this song a million times, but it’s amazing, so put on your good earbuds or headphones, or listen on your good speakers, or if you’re at your computer and listening on something like iLouds (Dan and I both love our iLouds), put a pillow over your monitor - it tends to clean up imaging - and give this a good listen.\n\nHave a listen here.\n\nThe biggest hit from a very polarizing figure in rock.\n\nCan he sing? Meh... I suppose Lou Reed is the patron saint of singers that really can’t sing, but that didn’t stop him.\n\nThe studio was Trident, the producer was David Bowie with Mick Ronson, and the engineer was the amazing Ken Scott. He wrote a nice and detailed memory of the recording session that you can read here. I’ll hit upon a few of the main useful things below.\n\nHerbie Rides Again\n\nThe incredibly recognizable opening riff on the bass is courtesy of our hero from last week, Herbie Flowers. It’s amazing how two notes with a slur between them can be so catchy. He was called in to lay down an upright bass part, but ever the businessman, and knowing that he’d get paid more for additional tracking, Herbie suggested an overdub: an electric bass part a 10th up. You hear this part on the chorus and on the vamp out.\n\nDo D’do D’do Do d'Do\n\n'The “colored girls” sing the Do d’do' on the chorus were sung by Thunderthighs, and they weren’t 'colored', they were three white English girls who were session singers in London. And they even had their own hit, Central Park Arrest. It’s.. well, have a listen. A lot of fun and way way out there for a pop tune. And that’s the Thunderthighs in the video! I might have to clean this up audio-wise.\n\nIt was written by Lynsey De Paul, who was a major solo artist and singer/songwriter in England in the 70s. Touted as “England’s Carol King,” she wrote for herself and others. Here she seems to have written a song for Saturday Night Fever two years before the BeeGees. I found a playlist of all her singles, if you’re looking for things to inspire. There’s a good chance Herbie Flowers is playing bass on a bunch of these.\n\nBack to 'Walk on the Wild Side', there’s a wonderful, easy effect you can steal. When the Do d’do’s first come in, they sound far away, and as the part continues, the Thinderthighs seem to get closer. Do this: use a pre-fader aux send from a vocal channel, feed it to a reverb unit and crank the reverb’s output up. When the channel fader on the vocals is down, the reverb is dominant, and the vocals sound far away and back there. As you push up the vocal’s fader, they’ll seem to get closer. Of course, use this dramatically.\n\nMore Lou Reed\n\nLou is an acquired taste with a very inconsistent output. He phoned it in at many points in his career, but when he got himself together, and often with a great producer, he made some outstanding music.\n\nBerlin - this was his third solo album and it’s the most depressing record ever recorded. It’s also phenomenally good. I discovered it in college, played it every day for months until one afternoon I noticed my roommate, Carl, crying from it. He loved the album but it made him want to kill himself. Produced by Bob Ezrin, 'Berlin' has a rock band kicking ass alongside an orchestra! Check out Caroline Says I. Doesn’t it sound depressing to you? The Kids features children screaming for their mom and an out-of-tune flute at the end.\n\nRock n Roll Animal - this is one of the great live albums, not so much for Lou Reed, who seems strung out on most of the tracks, but for the band. Good lord, the band is ABSOLUTELY KILLER. This record will make you want to buy a phase pedal. Also the audience applause was from a John Denver concert. Lou Reed would throw up in his grave if he knew that.\n\nConey Island Baby - a sleeper of an album, produced by Godfrey Diamond. One doesn’t think of Lou Reed as romantic, but this collection of songs written for his girlfriend of the time, Rachel (who was actually transexual), is lovely and quiet. The two were so close they shared clothes, and that love comes across on the title track, and this wonderful love song She’s My Best Friend.\n\nThe Blue Mask - this came out in 1981. It’s Lou Reed live in the studio with guitarist Robert Quine, fretless bassist Fernando Saunders, and a great drummer, Doane Perry. One or two takes per song, then a vocal overdub, and next song please. Great album, great recording, great playing. Title track is killer, but the rest of the album unfolds beautifully. Stunning fretless bass all over, and moods ranging from love to murderous drug withdrawal.\n\nThis has been a strange rabbit hole to go down... one visit left from this particular slice of space-time before we’re off to something else.\n\nThank you for the TON of responses to last week’s New Monday. You all are lovely. Have a great week.\n\nThe Guys from Korneff\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nHave a listen to this!\n\nI wish I could go back to ten-year-old me listening to the radio when I heard this for the first time. The damn DJ didn’t say the singer’s name, and I misheard the title as “Rocco,” or “Rock Oh.\"\n\nOf course, the title is \"Rock On,” David Essex’s biggest hit, and 51 years later, it's still amazing.\n\nEssex was more successful as an actor than a musician, but he had 19 top 40 singles in England during his career, as well as successful albums. Rock On cracked the Billboard Top 40.\n\nSlapback on the Vox\n\nRock On started with a demo, which consisted of Essex singing and playing drums on a garbage can as a drum. The engineer on the session put a loud slapback echo on the demo, and that is really the crux of the sound of it, and what makes it so frickin’ distinctive.\n\nBut the lead vocal isn’t echoed the entire time. It sometimes splits and hockets from the left channel to the right, sometimes it’s doubled, sometimes there’s a harmony. There’s a wonderful moment where a mass of vocals drop in like Māori warriors performing a Haka. Supercreative use of vocal texture, and keeping the ear’s interest while never losing the thread of the song.\n\nChordless Arrangement\n\nThe vocals have so much breathing room because of the minimalist arrangement of producer Jeff Wayne. Wayne heard the demo and figured out a score for drums and percussion, bass, and a few string players. The music bed is melody lines rather than chords. In fact, the only true chord is the massed vocal.\n\nThe classically trained London string players hired for the session were playing too tight and in tune for Wayne and Essex’s taste. They solved the problem by getting them all a little drunk.\n\nEnter Herbie Flowers\n\nWayne’s arrangement had a rudimentary bass part. Fortunately for the session, the guy they hired was Herbie Flowers.\n\nHerbie Flowers was a top session man in England. He occasionally toured, but touring got in the way of his very busy studio career. By the end of the '70s he stopped counting the number of records he’d tracked on (over 500 at the time). Flowers played double bass (traditional upright string bass), electric bass and tuba, and was equally proficient playing rock, jazz, classical - whatever the session called for. He played bass for Bowie, Elton John, Miles Davis, all the Beatles except John, and tuba on Abbey Road.\n\nSteal These Ideas\n\nFlowers was also a businessman. At the time, session players got more money the more tracks they laid down. Herbie talked Wayne and Essex into letting him put two tracks down, one low and the other high. The result is the incredibly cool bass part on Rock On. It’s the lick that makes the record.\n\nFlowers tuned the low bass down a half step, which resulted in a low-end mess of rumble at the end of each iteration of the riff.\n\nUsually, putting reverb on a bass isn’t a good idea. But with the right arrangement, it can certainly work, and it does on Rock On. The riff Flowers came up with for the overdubbed high bass part, slathered with plate reverb and a hint of delay, sounds like a guitar part. There’s not a guitar to be found on Rock On.\n\nCheck This Out\n\nI found this brilliant guy, Chris Eger, who put together what sounds like a note-for-note version of Rock On, with him playing and singing every part. It's a vision of what happened back in 1973 at Advision Studios in London. It’s a deceptively simple song.\n\nCheck out his channel. It’s so damn cool!\n\nThe Whole Album is Killer\n\nWhile Rock On is the standout track, the entire Rock On album, which was Essex’s debut, is a sonic adventure. It’s 70s glam, but it’s peppered with horn arrangements that evoke Vaudeville, strange strange vocals, clever arrangements and wonderful production touches. And tons of Herbie Flowers bass lines with a fat sound that manages to be low and articulate at the same time.\n\nThere’s a semi-reggae tune called Ocean Girl... I don’t even know where to begin with this track. Is that an early use of vocoder on that vocal on the left channel? And if not, how did they do that effect? There’s something that sounds like a slide guitar flitting around the background, but I think it’s an Ondes Martenot, which is an obscure French electronic instrument, developed in the late 1920s. It sits somewhere between a cello and a theremin. It’s credited on the album. I think it’s lurking on Ocean Girl. What do you think?\n\nActually, this whole album is really worth a listen. Seriously. Put it on and cop a bunch of great ideas off of it.\n\nUntil next week... Rock On!\n\nThat was cheesy.\n\nThe Guys at Korneff Audio\n\nHappy New Monday!\n\nActor Donald Sutherland died last week.\n\nI recalled he was in a Kate Bush video for the song Cloudbusting.\n\nThe song is an odd one, the video is a strange one, but it is Kate Bush, and she is one of those people who does whatever they want.\n\nIn the video, Sutherland and Kate Bush play a father and a son, based on psychologist Wilhelm Reich and his son, Peter, and inspired by Peter’s memoir A Book of Dreams.\n\nPeter Reich adored his dad; his dad’s controversial ideas ended up getting him imprisoned — there’s a Kafka-esque scene in the video in which the father is taken away. Somehow Kate Bush turns it into a top twenty single.\n\nHere’s a deeper dive into the making of the video.\n\nYou never know where inspiration might come from.\n\nHumanizing Grooves: Pull and Push\n\nIn the studio, I always spent a lot of time on how things felt, on the groove of the song, whether it be humans or computers or a bit of both. On drum machines and software like that in Logic, or in packages like Superior Drummer, there are tons of options and controls, in addition to amazingly well-recorded drum sounds.\n\nOne of the key controls is whether the drum part is Pushed, or Pulled - pushed meaning the part is slightly ahead of the beat, pulled meaning slightly behind the beat.\n\nCommon thinking is that for something to sound funky and have a great groove to it, it should be pulled a bit behind the beat. I used to think so, but after experimenting and listening, I now think it is a lot more complex than that.\n\nHere are some guidelines for your thinking on this. These aren’t rules but it's hard to find exceptions. Of course, this is all based on my hearing and feel for grooves. Your results might be different.\n\nGuidelines for Grooves\n\nEight Notes are almost always pushed a bit ahead of the beat. And this makes sense from a physical perspective. Yes, there are swing rhythms involved too, but most rock and pop don’t swing all that much.\n\nListen to the hi-hat on this - it’s clearly pushed.\n\nAnd kick is also Pushed. Which leads to...\n\nPush kicks or whatever is doing four on the floor. Kicks are almost always slightly ahead, especially on 4 on the 4 stuff like this song here.\n\nNote that these are all real drummers playing real kits. Next guideline:\n\nThe snare can be pulled. It's not always pulled, but very often it’s either pulled or the arrangement is doing something such that the snare seems to almost stop the flow of the song on two and four.\n\nListen to this. The kick and hats are pushed, the snare is pulled, as is the bass.\n\nThis is Hella Good by No Doubt. Fantastic live in the studio playing by Adrian Young. Listen carefully: you’ll hear at the start the whole drum part is pushing, but the moment the band kicks in there’s a slight slowdown and that snare generally pulls back behind the beat.\n\nPerhaps instead of thinking pulled on the snare, think getting a sense of the whole song stopping for a moment, like the snare cuts it for a split second.\n\nOn this recording, listen to the slight change in arrangement on the fourth beat of each measure - the hi-hats drop out.\n\nThat snare “pothole” that breaks the flow of the song is super critical to that groove, and to a lot of grooves. Reggae players always talk about leaving space.\n\nThis Childish Gambino tune has pushed hats and kicks, a pulled snare that has that song “cut” effect to it.\n\nSpeaking of Space\n\nI watched a ridiculous Jason Stathem movie a few nights ago, The Beekeeper, and noticed that there was almost continual underscoring through all the dialog. It was distracting. Of course, we’re not talking great writing or great acting here so maybe it was needed, but the next night I watched episode 2 of House of the Dragon, and while the show is scored and orchestrated, it’s considerably less so than The Beekeeper.\n\nToo much music, too much production - it can turn into a surrogate laugh track that indicates what you’re supposed to feel.\n\nSpace is good.\n\nThanks for existing in time and space with us,\n\nThe Guys at Korneff\n\nSchönen Montag!\n\nThat’s German.\n\nI’ve been bopping around Montreal’s subway system listening to Krautrock. It’s perfect music for trains and tunnels and feeling odd and alienated.\n\nI went down a Krautrock rabbit hole. And this is your invitation to join me down there!\n\nKrautrock... that is a terrible name, coined by British music journalists. I hope any German readers don’t find it offensive, and please feel free to correct or add to anything in this Neuer Montag.\n\nIt’s also ridiculously reductive. It’s applied to a variety of music recorded from about 1968 into the 1980s, that stylistically ranges from psychedelic jams to synth-based minimalism to prog rock with embarrassingly bad lyrics to punk to free jazz. As a genre, Krautrock is all over the place.\n\nWhile a lot of it has a mechanical 4/4 beat known as “motorik,” the only commonalities seem to be a tendency towards experimentation and noise, and that it doesn’t have blues as a basis for chord structure or improvisation.\n\nWhoops! Another commonality in Krautrock is a brilliant engineer/producer named...\n\nConny Plank\n\nBy brilliant, I mean Bill Putnam or Al Schmitt or Tom Dowd brilliant. An engineer’s engineer. Someone who not only knew where to put the mics, but also how to build the console. BRILLIANT. Conny Plank should really be much better known.\n\nKomrad “Conny” Plank recorded or produced practically every group associated with Krautrock at one time or another. He also recorded albums for Scorpions, Eurythmics, Devo, Ultravox, Killing Joke, Brian Eno, and even Duke Ellington! Plank turned down working with David Bowie on the album that eventually became Low, (too much drugs, he thought). He also turned down working on U2’s Joshua Tree (too much Bono).\n\nThe center of his studio near Cologne was a 56-channel custom console, built to his own specifications and recording style with Michael Zahl, who now makes 500 series EQs and such.\n\nHere is some vintage console porn. I love this stuff.\n\nPlank also developed a recall system that used a camera suspended over the console to take a picture of the knobs. To recall this “snapshot” of the console, the film would be projected back through the camera onto the console and an assistant would turn the knobs to match the image projected onto them. Brilliant.\n\nHe also solved the problem of listening to finished mixes in the car: he built an illegal radio station in the studio. He and the clients would pile into his car, tune into the studio’s station, and wait for the assistant engineer to include the mix in a playlist of similar records. Again, brilliant.\n\nAnd, of course, he was a virtuoso engineer, a huge believer in mic placement and working room acoustics. His recordings of percussion-based experimental jazz are fabulous, capturing everything with amazing clarity and precise stereo placement. He was also a master of tape manipulation, blessed with a fantastic memory that allowed him to edit long, free-form jam sessions into cohesive songs, linking forward and reversed bits of tape and noise without keeping detailed notes. He just sort of “did it.\"\n\nConny died young, at 47 in 1987, of cancer. His console is now in England, still making records for artists like Franz Ferdinand. The Motorik goes on!\n\nSome Things to Hear\n\nHere’s a curated list of some things Krautrock and Conny Plank.\n\nThis is a wonderful extension to everything I’ve written above, going into a bit more detail on the recordings and linked to listening examples.\n\nhttps://thevinylfactory.com/features/10-essential-conny-plank-records/\n\nCan - this is out there stuff.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dZbAFmnRVA\n\nKraftwork - the Beatles of Krautrock. They’re still around. The album Autobahn was the last record they did that was engineered by Plank as they became more successful and ever more electronic. Here’s a playlist of vids. Great background music. Occasionally look up and see Germans dressed as robots.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQIYEPe6DWY&list=RDEMlS0N2Gz3BIH0JY8Cyyrimw&start_radio=1\n\nNeu! - Loose, jam-oriented stuff. The recording below is an 8-track, engineered by Conny Plank. The drums here can’t be on more than two tracks, but there’s astonishing clarity and stereo perspective on everything. My guess is he did this with just two mics in exactly the right place.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zndpi8tNZyQ&list=RDzndpi8tNZyQ&start_radio=1\n\nNiagara - who says a percussion-only album can’t be amazing? Breathtaking engineering by Conny Plank, and amazing playing by a bunch of killer drummers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4T5R4nFIBgg\n\nLa Düsseldorf - a spinoff comprised of members of Kraftwork and Neu! Industrial before industrial?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz9q9UZS4M0&list=PL4384B64D44A0F11C\n\nCluster - electronic and minimal, occasionally with Brian Eno.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l50cmJOiHv0&list=OLAK5uy_kNoI0SQPzDD4EFa5MY1gKk-dOyd202orU\n\nTangerine Dream - dramatic electronic Krautrock, or the basis of every sci-fi movie soundtrack since 1980.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdFHE73aOMI&list=RDEMflsAy-eLxQ2-oszlwebZ4g&start_radio=1\n\nFaust - Krautrock as noise. Or punk ska. I have no idea what this stuff is.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=menuXx3oq80&list=OLAK5uy_lJ5UzdPN6Dj1C7D3oYhQDSc_6Zjc3KgPI\n\nNot Krautrock, but Conny Plank...\n\nEurythmics - Belinda. Recorded by Conny Plank. This is when the band was way more rock.\n\nEno - Ambient 1: Music for Airports This is the record that started ambient music. Plank was very much involved.\n\nUltravox - Vienna A huge early new wave hit. High romance and electronic noise, Conny Plank at the faders.\n\nDevo - Q: Are we not men? A: We are Devo. Produced by Eno, engineered by Plank. Insane stuff.\n\nScorpions - Love Drive. Conny Plank and early metal. Great sounds overall.\n\nA Percussion Recording Tip\n\nI used to use a stereo tube mic most often, but when I was dealing with a percussionist who was playing a lot of different things all over the place, like congas, and then some bell tree thing, and then a rik, and then a talking drum, and on and on, it became impossible to mic all of it with a pair and get good capture, or mic things individually and not get tons of phase issues.\n\nThe solution was a t-shirt and a PZM.\n\nA PZM is a flat plate of a mic that has a semi-hemispherical pattern — it picks up everything across 180 degrees. Not a cheap mic, they were originally made by Crown and were like $800 each. However, you could get a Crown PZM for $60 if you went to Radioshack, because the Realistic PZM was in fact a Crown mic. For $120 you could get a pair of great-sounding, albeit unbalanced wreck-around mics.\n\nSO... I taped a PZM to the center of a t-shirt with gaffers tape and had the percussionist put the shirt on, the mic facing out from his chest, perfectly positioned for percussion pick-up. Since he was naturally balancing levels as he moved from instrument to instrument, I didn’t even have to ride gain. For the mix, I’d split the one track to a bunch of channels and then automate them with whatever EQ or effects were needed to get the best sound out of that particular bit of percussion. When dealing with expensive studio musicians, producers often wanted me to go fast with them in the studio and then work more on the mix because, well, my time was cheaper!\n\nThanks for coming down the rabbit hole. Tchüss til next week!\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nAnd belated Happy Father's Day to the dads.\n\nA week ago, just as I was finishing up New Monday 17, which featured The Cars, I heard an awful cover - just released. Awful awful awful. This got me thinking about the original, which is flat-out great, covers, and idea theft.\n\nThe Original\n\nThe original, and undisputed king: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boaJCrHNRMA\n\n867-5309/Jenny was written in about 20 minutes by Alex Call and Jim Keller. Call was a professional songwriter, Keller was the guitarist of a band named Tommy Tutone that was in the midst of recording their second album for Columbia Records.\n\nContrary to myth, there is no Jenny that inspired the song, and 867-5309 was just a bunch of numbers that sang well.\n\nThe song was huge, 40 weeks in the top 100, Tommy Tutone became a one-hit wonder, and everyone called that phone number and asked for Jenny, which drove people who actually had that number CRAZY. Ah, the good old days before caller ID!\n\nThe band knew they had a hit the moment they heard the demo. Good lord! Here’s the demo! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nwbee1zn90s.\n\nThey worked out the arrangements and tweaked the lyrics in the studio for a few days and then cut it live to 24-track tape at the now defunct Clover Recorders in LA. A few overdubs and a mix: instant smash hit.\n\nThe Recording\n\n867-5309 is very straightforward. It starts with a jangly guitar line that fades in on the right, slides toward center, there’s a Hammond organ swell and BANG! This is a SUPER high energy performance. It's electrifying and it still feels like a shot of adrenalin when singer Tommy Heath yells \"Hey!\"\n\nTommy Tutone was a tight and well rehearsed bar band. Parts slither and hand off to each other, leading you through the song and constantly keeping your attention. Guitar and drums fills are ICONIC: You can't imagine the song without them, as we'll see on the covers. The guitar solo is also iconic. With a great song like this, the best production is getting out of the way and just letting the band kill it.\n\nRe-record/Remaster\n\nIn 2009, or 2011 (the data gets hazy) Tommy Tutone re-recorded 867-5309/Jenny, probably for a \"Best of the 80's package for K-Tel. While technically a better recording, it's not a better record, even though it's basically a note-by-note remake. Everything is overly processed. Clover was a major studio in LA in 1981. In 2009, a recording like this, with minimal budget, is being done in a much smaller, cheaper situation, overdubbed rather than cut live, drum machine. There's a noticeable lack of energy and interplay.\n\nThe Cover that Sparked This\n\nThis was the cover, released last week. I’ve no idea why David Lee Roth decided to cover it. Yuck.\n\nIn the past, when Diamond Dave's covered a song he's done a reinvention. His “The Telephone Song\" is lackluster and boring. The drums sound like a live player did them on an electronic kit and then someone fixed it. PLEASE pull that snare back in time a bit, it's too ahead of the beat. The main guitar is a big, woofy-sounding acoustic. The iconic guitar fills are reduced down to just one, flown in stiffly throughout the song, and it's a lame guitar sound, too.\n\nThe guitar solo has been reduced to a harmonica solo that would embarrass Alanis Morissette.\n\nVocals are squashed and small. The whole recording is squashed and small. Did they ever master this?\n\nOf course, there’s worse: Nirvana butchered it live here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV4bCSjKBSo . In their defense they all switched instruments — Kurt on drums and vocals! And they’d been drinking.\n\nOriginal, a Cover, and a Cover of the Cover\n\nHush is a fabulous tune by Joe South. He wrote it for Billy Joe Royal, and it was released in 1967.\n\nDeep Purple heard it, amped it up and released it in 1968. This kicks ass. Damn, this is heavy. They redid it again in 1984 and screwed it up.\n\nKula Shaker covered Hush in 1996. They were smart enough to knock off Deep Purple’s version, but they missed on the tempo. They definitely dropped the funk ball on this one.\n\nAI for the Kill\n\nBut all this is perhaps water under the bridge. New Rick Beato thing on AI. I think you have to keep up on what’s going on with AI, especially if you want music as a career. Maybe everything is a cover tune.\n\nStay human, friends, stay human.\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nOk, imagine it's this time of year back in 1978, and you hear this song for the first time at a high school dance:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BDBzgHXf64\n\nChunky guitars, keyboard noises, a strange vocal, huge toms, drums and bass... and a chorus sung by the band overdubbed more than 50 times.\n\nWelcome to New Wave, kids! The Cars set the scene and the sound with their debut album, \"The Cars.\"\n\nThe Cars\n\nThis is easily one of the best debuts from any band ever. It’s a killer combination of great songs played by excellent musicians, sung by distinctive singers, and assembled by a master producer, Roy Thomas Baker. It also helps that it was recorded at AIR Studios London, which in 1978 was THE state of the art.\n\nThe Cars were a perfect blend of elements and musicians. The quirky songs and vocals were provided by Rik Ocasik, who was also a master of those clicky guitar parts all over The Cars’ records. Ocasik created happy pop tunes that were somehow depressing and world-weary. There’s always a sense of \"We’re in love, but I know you’ll leave me. Or die. Sigh.\"\n\nThe other lead singer of the group was Ben Orr, who had a terrific voice albeit not as distinctive as Ocasik’s. He was also a very musical bassist and had movie star looks, which was an interesting contrast to the skinny, angular 6’4” Ocasik.\n\nGuitarist Elliot Easton... a monster player. He’s the guy throwing country, jazz and Beatles licks all over the place, and intertwining guitar lines with Gregg Hawkes' keyboard parts. Often you can’t tell which is a guitar and which is a synth. Hawkes invented a lot of the musical vocabulary of New Wave, pioneering using sequencers and synths in the studio and live.\n\nDrummer Dave Robinson was The Cars' secret weapon. He is relentlessly solid with excellent timekeeping abilities and a killer sense of style: Robinson had a design background, and gave the band their signature look and album covers (although he didn’t design the cover of the debut record).\n\nThe Cars debut was pop, but it was rock, it had prog elements, it was serious, it was silly, and there’s not a bad song on it.\n\nIf you’ve not heard The Cars in its entirety, take 35 minutes and listen to it. Tons to learn and steal.\n\nBut if you’re busy, just take 8 minutes and listen to this excellent Rick Beato clip in which he breaks down a Cars’ hit off the album and explains it all to ya.\n\nRoy Thomas Baker\n\nIf you don’t know the name, you know the acts he’s produced: Queen (yes, he did Bohemian Rhapsody), Foreigner, Cheap Trick, Devo, Ozzy Osbourne, Mötley Crüe, Journey, Alice Cooper, The Stranglers, The Smashing Pumpkins, The Darkness... hell of a long, and wide, career.\n\nThis is an excellent interview with the man. He talks songs, bands, recording technique, and he paints a vivid picture of big studio recording in its heyday.\n\nStephens 40-track 2-inch\n\nJohn Stephens made tape decks and other audio gear. He started out by modifying 3M multitracks, and ended up designing his own electronics, tape heads, and a terrific drive system that minimized wear and tear on the tape.\n\nMost of you don’t remember a time when playing the tape wore it out, starting with high-end loss. Stephens built decks to minimize this as well as improve response characteristics. His company made portable multitracks for on-location use during film shoots, and studio decks with different track configurations including 24, 32 and a whopping 40 tracks on a single 2-inch roll of tape. 'The Cars\" was tracked on a Stephens 40.\n\nStephens decks were basically hand-made by the man himself and his small staff, and they were out of business by the 80s, when the industry standardized on 24-track 2-inch. Stephens decks are considered as good if not better than vintage Studer multitracks.\n\nHere’s a bunch of things on Stephens and his tapedecks, for all of the knobheads like me and Dan!\n\nA Tip, an Idea, a Thing to Try\n\nWe’ve heard from a bunch of you about last week’s tip from Dan, which was to try adding another iteration of the same plug-in and see what you get.\n\nHere’s another idea. It works well with most of our plug-ins, and depending on how a plug-in is designed, it might work on some plug-ins from other companies.\n\nTry overloading the input stage of the plug-in and see what you get. On most Korneff plug-ins, like the AIP, the PSC, if you turn up the INPUT TRIM, you’ll overload the input gain stage of the plug-in and you’ll get saturation and additional harmonics, similar would happen if you overloaded the input stage of a piece of analog equipment. This is because our plug-ins have a modeled analog circuit that includes an input gain stage. Not a lot of plug-ins are designed this way.\n\nWhen you overload the input stage of a piece of equipment (or a plug-in with an input stage), you affect the character and the operation of everything happening after that. Overloading creates saturation, which adds some dynamic range compression (think compression with an instantaneous attack and release) as well as additional harmonic distortion, which might warm things up and/or add some brightness. Much of the sound of classic analog recordings is subtle overloading of channels and tape, all happening before any additional EQ or compression.\n\nRemember that whenever you deliberately overload things to lower your monitor volume a bit—you don’t want digital clipping going through your speakers at high volumes or into your ears.\n\nIf you’re enjoying New Monday, can you do us a favor? Forward this to a friend who might be interested?\n\nAnd of course, if you write to us we will answer you.\n\nRock on!\n\nThe Guys at Korneff\n\nHappy Monday,\n\nSo much to write about...\n\nWe’re in a Podcast\n\nOur friends Benedikt and Malcom from The Self Recording Band recently had a conversation with Dan and I about recording, Korneff Audio, plug-ins, the industry, etc.\n\nBenedikt and Malcom are great guys who know their stuff. Their website has lots of resources on it, including the Podcast with the guys from Korneff. Audio.\n\nDouble, x2, Twice as Much\n\nDouble double toil and trouble... Today we’re looking at doing things x2. And there are double the number of production ideas and tips in here today, including Dan Korneff’s Secret Secret. Read on...\n\nProduction tip from Shakespeare\n\nHere’s the beginning of a monologue from William Shakespeare's Hamlet:\n\nO, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\n\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\n\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\n\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\n\nThis monologue from Hamlet goes on for like another 65 lines and then at the end, you get this:\n\nMore relative than this. The play’s the thing\n\nWherein I’ll catch the conscience of the King.\n\n71 lines of blank verse (that’s what they call this stuff) that do not rhyme, and then 2 lines that do.\n\nI studied Shakespeare at Oxford in the early 80’s, this monologue in particular, and the question was always: Why do the last two lines rhyme?\n\nShakespeare did it to make them stand out. To catch your ear. To add EMPHASIS. To make you remember that particular moment as important.\n\nI started to hear examples of this sort of thinking on records. Echos that would pop on for only a few words. A moment of strange EQ or distortion. Some little thing to grab your ear for a moment, like someone highlighting a line of text in a book.\n\nThe Beatles were masters of this, and they did it very often with doubling. Or, in some cases, not doubling.\n\nAnd I Love Her, the sort of ballad ANYONE would be lucky to write (notice the all caps... emphasis...). Have a listen, and note how the doubling of the vocal works.\n\nOnly two lines out of the whole song are un-doubled! All the rest is doubled. And they don’t even seem to be very consequential lyrics, but they do force you to pay attention to the hook line that follows.\n\nSo, next time you’re mixing and making, think about what little moment can be made special, and how you might do that.\n\nThere’s another thing to learn from this particular song: if you write something with a killer melody and have a great singer sing it, you don’t need to do much production-wise to make magic.\n\nDan Korneff’s Secret Secret\n\nI was surprised to learn that Dan’s mix bus has two iterations of the Puff Puff mixPass on it (along with a bunch of other things). I asked him about it, and he said this:\n\n“If something sounds good, I do it again, figuring that it will sound even better. With the Puff Puff on the mix bus, I added one with the default settings, and it sounded great. So I added another one, same thing, default settings, and that sounded even better. I tried a third one, but that didn’t work. So two it is.\"\n\nGAH!!! This is SO simple and SO obvious and I wish I'd thought of it, but I didn’t. Dan further confessed that he does this ALL THE TIME. He’s always adding another iteration of the same thing and listening.\n\nThis is a great trick. If it sounds good with one on it, try adding another.\n\nDouble Compression\n\nA friend showed me a trick using two compressors when tracking vocals, and it became my standard operating procedure for recording vocals, bass, acoustic guitars, or anything that had too much dynamic range to fit comfortably on tape. I still track things this way 30 years later.\n\nHere's an extended blog post on this, complete with settings, a few diagrams and usage ideas. This is a game changer for your engineering. Perhaps many of you already do this. If you don’t, you should.\n\nAI is Still Here\n\nWatch this good video in which a guy in our industry, Cameron from Venus Theory, discusses AI and its impact on audio careers, and how one might survive. His conclusion, by the way, is the same idea that I came up with a few months back, which is:\n\nDouble down on being yourself.\n\nAgain for emphasis: Double down on being yourself.\n\nHappy Monday all. We always enjoy it when you write to us. Thanks for reading.\n\nTwo Times the Love,\n\nThe Guys at Korneff Audio\n\nHappy Monday,\n\nI'm still experimenting with the format. That might never change, and it probably shouldn't.\n\n(If you're creative and not experimenting then somethings wrong).\n\nAll the links are now tucked into paragraphs, and people asked if the musical examples could start at exactly what I'm writing about, so I did that as well.\n\nI really appreciate all your comments and ideas. Please feel free to write and suggest. New Monday is here to inspire you and open ears and minds to possibilities, mine included.\n\nI think it is best we start off with a song today. Something mellow and sort of sad, like Memorial Day in the US, so have a listen to Paper Tiger by Beck. This is a great recording and performance. And we will chat about it lower down the newsletter...\n\nDeveloping Plug-ins: the Dan Method\n\nWe get asked a fair amount about how we develop plug-ins and why our plug-ins are the way they are. A lot of what we're about is revealed in this blog post Dan wrote about how he developed the Talkback Limiter. Did you know the TBL started as a DIY project with circuit boards, resistors and wires, etc.?\n\nMinimal Drum Micing and Drum Tuning\n\nDrum recording has evolved from letting them bleed into the vocal mic to over and under micing every piece of the kit... and then replacing everything with samples.\n\nThe Glyn Johns Micing Technique keeps popping up. It's not really a fixed technique as much as it's an approach, and Glyn Johns himself kept evolving and changing it.\n\nIn a nutshell, it's a mic on the kick, and then two overheads, one basically over the snare, the other somewhere near the floor tom. Often, though, extra mics were tossed in there as needed, depending on what was lacking.\n\nYou've heard this sound a lot — The Rolling Stones from Beggars Banquet to Exile on Mainstreet, the first Led Zeppelin album, and on and on. It's the sound of the early 70s.\n\nI stumbled across a really excellent video on the Glyn Johns thing, and on minimal drum micing in general. But what's really good about this video is how Joel from DrumsDotPizza ties drum tuning into the whole picture.\n\nTuning is not just a way to make the drums sound good, but getting them pitched correctly changes how they're picked up by mics. This guy gives away a lot of good information that applies to all drum recording, not just when you're being minimal about it. This is the most valuable thing in this week's New Monday.\n\nStealing Ideas and Influences\n\nBack to Paper Tiger...\n\nThis song has been on my mind since I first heard it. I love the sounds, and the orchestration. I originally pulled it into this newsletter because it seems to be a pretty good example of minimal drum micing, but I would bet it was tight mic'd as well. Whatever, a dandy fine drum sound. But there's more...\n\nSteal this:\n\nThere's wonderful interplay between the guitar on the right channel and the string section on the left—it sounds like they're soloing off each other, and I was wondering how the hell they pulled this off. Turns out Beck sang the string part, and then his father arranged it. This is a very stealable idea.\n\nThe theft, or inspiration, gets worse. Or better?\n\nPaper Tiger, and Beck's Sea Change album from which it came, are influenced heavily by a 1971 album called Histoire de Melody Nelson by Serge Gainsbourg.\n\nHistoire de Melody Nelson\n\nGainsbourg is... beyond France's Bob Dylan? Culturally, in France, he's a HUGE deal.\n\nHistoire de Melody Nelson is a concept album about a middle aged man hitting a 14 year old English girl with his car and then seducing her. And then she's killed in a plane crash. I kid you not. Needless to say, thematically, this wouldn't float at all today. It was controversial when it came out.\n\nBut the album was a tremendous critical success, and very influential. It featured very close mic'd vocals, a bass and drum driven funk groove, psychedelic guitar parts, and wonderful strings by arranger Jean-Claude Vannier. Have a listen to the first track from it, Melody.\n\nSee where Beck got Paper Tiger?\n\nBut not only Beck. There's also this recording by Goldfrapp. It's much tighter playing, but those string parts seem awfully familiar, as does the whole vibe.\n\nNot sure you can hear it, but the chorus is a V - IV progression that we talked about a few weeks ago.\n\nAnd more. Here's a song off Melody Nelson with a distinctive acoustic guitar part...\n\nNote this highly very extremely similar guitar part on this song by French electronica pioneers AIR.\n\nJ'adore AIR, and their entire career seems based on mixing Melody Nelson with certain songs off Dark Side of the Moon... like this song Highschool Lover. Sounds a lot like Breathe (in the air), doesn't it? Just add the bass and strings from Melody Nelson.\n\nAnd there are of course, more people who dipped into the Melody Nelson pool. Portishead. Jarvis Cocker. Placebo. Michael Stipe. The list goes on...\n\nIs it an influence? Is it stealing?\n\nIs it something that actually matters? It doesn't seem to.\n\nBe influenced. Pick ideas like flowers and put them in your garden and let things grow.\n\nNow get out there and borrow!\n\nWarm regards,\n\nThe guys at Korneff\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nThis week it seems we are revolving a bit around mixing.\n\nRead This Article\n\nThis is a wonderful dual interview featuring legendary mixing god Bob Clearmountain (Bowie, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, everybody), and the brilliant Jesse Ray Ernster (Kanye West, Doja Cat, Burna Boy).\n\nIt covers careers, fave gear, technology—there’s a huge chunk where these two breakdown mixing in ATMOS—the origin story of the NS-10 as a studio speaker, and more.\n\nIt’s also funny and warm: these two guys have total respect for each other and a great friendship. It’s how life should be. Very worth a read.\n\nBob and Jesse Ray Talk\n\nCool, not perfect\n\nMixing can get very clinical, nitpicky, and anal, and far too technical. Often, my favorite mixes have something wrong about them that makes them more memorable.\n\nIt’s like a beautiful face: sometimes there’s a flaw on that face that makes it stand out and even more interesting.\n\nLook at models. Some of them are really weird looking, but there’s something gorgeous about that.\n\nThis Roberta Flack song is a mixing mess. Have a listen and then read on.\n\nWhat is up with that kick, right? It’s HUGE. And it’s panned to the right. It sounds like someone beating a suitcase with a soup ladle. There’s a ton of stuff and gook in the low mids.\n\nI met the guy that mixed it, Gene Paul (Les Paul’s son). He was mastering a record I had mixed, and when I commented on how one thing had too much bass on it, Gene said, “I put way too much foot on Killing Me Softly, but it worked.” It sure did.\n\nThe song I put too much bass on... not so much. Sigh.\n\nAnother mess, courtesy of The Beatles\n\nThis is probably less about the choices made and more about the technology limitations of the time, but this is an oddball mix even by Beatles standards.\n\nThe drums are totally lost except every now and again there’s this really quiet go ‘round fill in the back corner off to the left. But there is a lead tambourine on it! It’s the loudest thing on the track, other than the vocals.\n\nBig fave moment at 1:51: There’s a great guitar riff that is super loud for like two measures, and then is gone, never to return. What??\n\nIt’s worth it to note that The Beatles had so many great riffs that they could basically throw one away for a break. Other bands would have built the entire song around that riff.\n\nMixing, Ears, Speakers\n\nWhile we are in the age of digital music, human biology and physics remain strictly analog. A mix lives or dies in that very analog interaction of air and ears.\n\nHere are some useful thoughts and tricks on dealing with speakers and your ears while mixing.\n\nMix with your ears\n\nJust a quick thought here: there are now so many visual aids to mixing—real time pictures of frequency response and the like—that one can get caught up in how things look rather than how things sound.\n\nIn the early 90s, I hooked up a RTA to an SSL and mixed with it for a few weeks. I would try to get my mixes to have a similar “picture” to reference mixes I ran through the RTA. I learned a lot, but mainly I learned that I didn’t get good mixes chasing a picture.\n\nNo one has ever said, “I love the way this mix looks.”\n\nBad mix. Keep at it or restart?\n\nOne can start with the best intentions and wind up with an awful mix. Or one can be mixing and just not be hitting it right.\n\nDo you restart the mix from scratch or just keep working through it?\n\nI found whenever I restarted a mix, I would pretty much get something very similar to the mix I thought was awful unless I approached it from a radically different perspective.\n\nThe next time you’re caught in a crappy mix, throw it out and start again, but do something very different to start. If you usually begin with drums, start with the vocals. If you like to get an overall balance first thing, start the mix with something really strange, like bring up the backing vocals or the keyboard pads and start there.\n\nThe point is to break your pattern. If you don’t break the pattern, you’ll just repeat the pattern.\n\nMix it up!\n\nWarm regards,\n\nThe guys at Korneff\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nSteve Albini died last week at 61. He was a superb audio engineer and by most accounts, a lovely person.\n\nHe was outspoken and had no time for stupidity or unscrupulous behavior. Needless to say, he had a negative opinion of the music industry.\n\nHe loved music, loved musicians, loved rock, and loved doing his work, which was engineering. Although he is called a producer by some, he thought “producer” was a dirty word and an exploitative job. He was an engineer, damnit.\n\nHe was a huge influence on recording, especially in the 90s.\n\nHere’s a compilation I made of some of the more interesting and useful videos and articles covering various aspects of this complex man. Lot’s of How To stuff, but also some of it is pretty funny.\n\nStart Here\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with Steve Albini, start here, with this video of him with Anthony Bourdain!\n\nAlbini was smart and a nerd about everything - he’s even nerdy about the sandwich.\n\nEngineering\n\nMust read article on engineering - Great article - he covers literally everything he does in the studio. You’ll learn a ton from this.\n\nVideo: Steve on the Job and Equipment - More good info and ideas.\n\nMr Albini always had a very well thought-out approach to everything he did, and of course especially to recording. I’ve selected a few clips for you all that illustrate his thinking, and also are useful for you developing your thinking.\n\nTechniques\n\nOn tuning drums\n\nPhase when mic’ing drum sets - he’s talking a lot about absolute phase here.\n\nMic’ing Snare Drums\n\nHow to Clean a Console and Outboard - this is REALLY useful\n\nHow to Mic a Speaker Cabinet - man, he goes into depth and is an excellent teacher.\n\nGear\n\nMr Albini had an interesting taste in equipment. Here are some links to some of the stuff you see in these videos or that get mentioned in articles.\n\nNeotek was a Chicago-based maker of recording consoles. They went out of business, were taken over by a company called Sytek (which was actually formed by former Neotek employees). Sytek too is now out of business.\n\nNeotek Elite II Consoles\n\nSytek MPX-4 preamps are spectacular. Incredibly clean with super fast response. They pop up on eBay and Reverb from time to time. Performance up there with an API.\n\nThose strange looking black speakers on the bridge of the console I know quite well: B&W 805v’s. Wonderful speakers with a very sophisticated internal design. The 800 Series of speakers had a sort of honeycomb internal bracing system that resulted in an almost non-resonant cabinet.\n\nThe Really Nice Compressor - awesome and cheap.\n\nOn Business and Relationship\n\nAdvice for bands\n\nThe Adventures of Steve Albini\n\nAbove all, we lost a good human being who lived life well. Rest in Peace, Mr. Albini.\n\nSteve Albini does his George Martin (the Beatles Producer) impression.\n\nAlbini and friends on Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend\n\nThey prank Gene Simmons... this is really funny!\n\nSteve on speaking Italian\n\nSteve interviewed by a cat\n\nSteve gets philosophical?\n\nTake care of yourselves.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nThe guys at Korneff\n\nHappy Monday - got your coffee? Evidently I've had too much of mine because this week's New Monday is manic and all over the place.\n\nSick of I vi IV V or John Barry’s Secret Chord Progression\n\nThere is entirely too much I-vi-IV-V happening in pop music today, in pop music in general.\n\nYes, it is the chord progression of hits like this, and this, but it and its variations are overused. Here’s an article on how often Taylor Swift has used it. And here’s a video on how often she uses a slight variation on it (I V ii IV).\n\nIf you’re looking for a different progression to base your stuff on, try this: IV - V. You can also call it V - IV or I - bVII or bVII - I.\n\nCall it what you want, the idea is moving between two major chords a whole step apart. It’s easy, very handy (especially if you’re a guitarist), and has a TON of great songs written using it.\n\nOn Broadway - original Drifters version sort of hides it a bit, but the George Benson version makes it more obvious.\n\nMy Generation - V - IV with a bass solo.\n\nLA Woman - this song is almost one chord, the IV - V only happens on the chorus.\n\nAnd there’s still more... Reelin’ in the Years.\n\nIV - V or V - IV has a modal quality to it —Mixolydian to be exact. It also doesn’t have a strong sense of resolve. Songs written with it can seem like they’ll go on forever.\n\nMore Allman Brothers???\n\nI promise I’ll stop with the Brothers next week, but for now:...\n\nThe song \"Dreams\", on their first album, is a IV - V for almost the entire song, including a fabulous extended solo by Duane Allman. Very modal and vibey recording. Great vox by Gregg.\n\nDreams\n\nI couldn’t resist running \"Dreams\" through my instant-this-sounds-better workflow of the Puff Puff mixPass into the El Juan Limiter. And I made a short video of that too.\n\nJohn Barry, the God of V - IV\n\nFilm composer John Barry was a top film composer. He won a bunch of Academy awards, scored the James Bond films, etc., etc. Huge name and a great musician.\n\nHe deployed IV - V often. It’s the cornerstone of the soundtrack to the James Bond film “You Only Live Twice.”\n\nNancy Sinatra sang the original version for the film. The distinctive opening riff is V - IV.\n\nBjork did a breathy, moody remake.\n\nJohn Barry, though, outdid himself, on the soundtrack for \"The Midnight Cowboy\". His \"Theme from the Midnight Cowboy\" is one of the most gorgeous things ever written. It features the most lonely sad harmonica on the planet. If there’s only one thing you listen to today, it’s this.\n\nJohn Barry plays Theme from Midnight Cowboy.\n\nThat song makes me cry. And here’s something else you can cry over!\n\nMusic has a tremendous effect or Fun with the BBC\n\nSeveral months ago Iwrote an article on the Johnny Nash hit “I Can See Clearly Now.” A producer from the BBC, Mair Bosworth, read it, contacted me, and I was honored to play a small part in a podcast about the song. The podcast is less about the music or recording and more about the almost supernatural effect the song has on people’s lives. The podcast is incredibly moving and worth a listen.\n\nThe podcast, on BBC’s Soul Music, is here.\n\nShout out to Mair Bosworth at the BBC. Soul Music rules!\n\nAnd... I couldn’t resist running I Can See Clearly through the Puff Puff. That plug-in is amazing.\n\nProbably too many links and ideas this week, but I got excited. There’s so much to listen to and to learn.\n\nHave a great week.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nThe guys at Korneff\n\nWe love to hear from you all. Send us your V - IV progression songs. Write some!\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nTwo things this week: we released a new plug-in, the Puff Puff mixPass, and Dickey Betts, the guitarist from the Allman Brothers Band, died at age 80.\n\nThe Puff Puff mixPass\n\nOur latest is a dynamics processor. Using waveshaping, the Puff Puff adds harmonic content to \"puff up\" the apparent volume of a signal. It's not a compressor or a limiter, rather the opposite, but it has a similar effect: it makes things LOUD.\n\nIt also has controls to add character to things—distortion, overdrive and all sorts of fun sonic garbage.\n\nCheck it out here.\n\nI also made a video using it to enhance an Allman Brothers Band live recording. More on that below...\n\nDickey Betts and the Original Band\n\nForrest Richard Betts... a great player and a great songwriter—he wrote a lot of the best-known Allman Brothers Band songs, including their biggest hit, Rambling Man.\n\n80 years is a pretty good run for anyone, but especially for a rock star who has had... adventures.\n\nThe original Allman Brothers Band line-up, brothers Duane and Gregg, drummers Butch Trucks and Jai Johnny Johanson, bassist Berry Oakley, and Dickey Betts, are generally considered about the best rock band the US ever produced.\n\nThe evidence is a bunch of live recordings from The Fillmore East, which was a concert hall in NY city that was open for a scant four years but is still remembered for the quality of the performers it attracted, and especially for the Allman Brothers performances. Their 1971 album Live At Fillmore East made the band's career, and the album is one the best live rock albums recorded.\n\nThe original lineup of ABB was a spectacular band. They had the power of Marshall amps and the listening skills of a top-tier jazz group. They had two fantastic guitarists, a killer rhythm section, and the most authentic-sounding white blues singer imaginable.\n\nThe Allmans played The Fillmore East a number of times, including the two nights that were recorded for the live album. They also headlined the closing, last show at The Fillmore East on June 27th, 1971.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Live - a bootleg\n\nDuane Allman died young and left a huge legacy that, while well deserved, has somewhat overshadowed Dickey Betts. Dickey was a great player, perhaps not as adventurous as Duane, but technically probably better. Duane actually remarked a number of times in interviews that he thought Betts was the better player of the two. We hear about Duane Duane Duane, but what about Dickey?\n\nWe have this: I found a bootleg from that last performance at the Fillmore, and pulled out a bit that features both Duane and Dickey rocking out with the band and also in solo segments. It's amazing playing, to my ear better than anything on the great live album.\n\nThe guitar sounds are phenomenal as well: both are using Les Pauls through cranked-up Marshalls, and it's the damn voice of rock 'n' roll. Dickey is over towards the left, Duane is on the right.\n\nDuane is amazing, but Dickey SCREAMS on this recording.\n\nFixing with the Puff Puff and friends\n\nI ran the recording through a couple of our plug-ins. The guitars sound great, but the drums are lost, so I did what I could. I made a video of how I enhanced it, and also I put the finished recording up for the world.\n\nI used the AIP, the El Juan, and the Puff Puff. It’s a deep dive.\n\nThe video is here.\n\nDuane died about four months after that last Fillmore gig, Berry Oakley a year after that. The band persevered, with Dickey Betts assuming the mantle of leadership for a decade. Butch Trucks and Gregg Allman died in 2017. The last living member of the original powerhouse that was this fantastic group is Jai Johnny \"Jaimoe\" Johanson, age 79.\n\nThe original members remain family, naming their kids after each other.\n\nRIP Mr. Forrest Richard “Dickey” Betts.\n\nHave a great week. Celebrate your friends.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nThe guys at Korneff\n\nWe love to hear from you all. Write even if you don’t have much to say!\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nIf you’re in the US, still working on your taxes or did you get them done?\n\nTAXMAN\n\nI remember hearing this song for the very first time. I had just bought my very first record, which was Revolver, by The Beatles. George Harrison’s song Taxman was the lead-off track. It began out with some strange noises (analog tape decks ramping up to speed) and a weird count-in, and then BANG!\n\nI made a special version of Taxman for you all.\n\nThere was an awful Beatles cartoon series in the late 60s. The voices all suck (except for Ringo), the animation is awful, but the music is good. Especially if you swap in better versions of the song... and then run the audio through the El Juan Limiter\n\nCheck out Taxman here.\n\nIt still blows my mind. Damn! That’s PRODUCTION. Guitar solos by Paul McCartney, by the way. The whole album is great.\n\nRevolver changed my life.\n\nWOW, man\n\nIt has been all WOW WOW WOW Thing at Korneff Headquarters for the past few weeks. Finally, I got a WOW Thing video done. I used it in some non-typical ways — it definitely isn’t a plug-in that only does big guitars. There are a few hacks in the video too, as well as Luke ADHD moments.\n\nWatch the Wow Thing video here.\n\nBy the way, the introductory low price goes away April 19th.\n\nBreaking Rules with Moving Coils\n\nThe WOW Thing became a thing when engineer Randy Staub used it on Metallica’s Black Album. He also used a Shure SM7 on the hi-hats. Not the usual thing you see.\n\nThe SM7 was Michael Jackson’s main vocal mic. Kind of a strange choice, especially since that mic is relatively insensitive and MJ used to make all sorts of weird little noises. Or maybe that was why they used an SM7.\n\nDan’s go-to acoustic guitar mic is an AKG D160. The Beatles loved this one, too. Luke's go-to acoustic guitar mic was the AKG D224.\n\nSometimes, actually very often, a moving coil is a better choice than a condenser.\n\nHere’s why you should use Moving Coil microphones.\n\nWe love your comments and questions. Please feel free to write us, we love hearing from you.\n\nHappy April 15th!\n\nWarm regards,\n\nThe guys at Korneff\n\nPS.. we have a new plug-in coming out soon. I used it on the music on that Taxman cartoon. The voice acting and cartoon soundtrack went through the El Juan, but the Beatles song went through something else. Any ideas as to what? Send us your guesses!\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nThe spirit of rock 'n' roll and playing live continues with this AMAZING video...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HldgxyA2XiQ\n\nThis is the definitive version of Johnny B Goode. Yes, Chuck Berry wrote it, but Hendrix blows the doors off of it.\n\nHow to Structure a Guitar Solo\n\nHendrix does two guitar solos, in the middle and at the end. Each solo goes through the changes (the chords of the song) three times. Each time through, he manages to drop a bomb of a solo that's different from, and yet similar to, the other solos.\n\nThis is a producing/artistic concept I'll dig into more later that we'll call Diverse in Unity/Unified in Diversity.\n\nEach individual time through the changes has a sustained note opening, followed by a contrasting section with more of a flurry of notes. Each time through the changes follows that formula, with some minor variations. This is a \"unity\" aspect that locks the solos together and allows us to hear them as one complete statement.\n\nBut each sustained opening is different from all the others, and in the middle solo, the drama and energy of each time through increases. The first time he wobbles the note around in the midrange and keeps the fast stuff in the same general area. The second time through is more aggressive, opening with a dive bomb and playing more complex patterns after that. The third time he kicks a wah in—using it more like a treble boost—and plays a bunch of piercing high stuff. It's very dramatic, building up like a train heading at you.\n\nThe ending solo is similarly increasingly dramatic - in the middle he plays with his teeth (and yes, he's really playing with his teeth) and ending with an unaccompanied speediest, followed by the entire band hitting the last note perfectly.\n\nI think my favorite moment, though, is right after the last note ends, Hendrix checks his tuning. It's sort of like, \"Oh, back to business here.\" I love that.\n\nSo, next time you're in the studio and things are boring, or the guitarist has more ambition than ideas, think on Diverse in Unity/Unified in Diversity.\n\nUse Our Plug-ins Backwards\n\nTo make the Hendrix video for y'all I took video from one source and audio from another, but even then it didn't sound all that good to me. So, I ran the entire thing through our EL Juan Limiter, and what a difference.\n\nI also realized that both Dan and I tend to use our plug-ins backwards from the way they're laid out. So I made a video of our \"reversed workflow\" for you and explained a few things as well.\n\nClick here for Using the EL Juan Backward video\n\nBy the time a lot of you get this we'll be in the middle of an eclipse. Crazy times! Last week an earthquake, this week a lunar eclipse! I wonder what might happen after that...???\n\nAs always, we love to hear from you, so please write us with your comments and ideas. We’re all ears.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nThe guys at Korneff\n\nHappy Monday!\n\nFirst: watch this before you read on any further:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIZD9WFpWZo\n\n***************************************************************\n\nI want to be reincarnated as a high school girl in a sundress and sandals, rocking out to Fugazi.\n\nThis thing is so damn HUMAN. This clip embodies the fun and camaraderie of rocking out in the band. Playing in a band. Remember: you don’t “serious\" music, you play music.\n\nLead singer is a killer. She has a sincerity about spelling out how she’s going to do what she wants with her life.\n\nDrummer is a killer, too. I wrote more about why he’s good and what is the takeaway if you’re recording/producing.\n\nTV Themes and Songs\n\nTV themes have gotten REALLY short. This has to be a byproduct of Instagram and TikTok and I don’t think I like it. I remember tv theme songs that were fabulous songs, like this and this.\n\nHowever, some of these short themes are wickedly good as well as wickedly short.\n\nTwo of my faves, Better Call Saul and The Lincoln Lawyer.\n\nGreat little, distinctive bits of production/writing.\n\nPerhaps think about getting good at making music like this.\n\nWhy are these things so effective?\n\n1) There’s something familiar about them. When we think we’ve heard something before but we’re not sure, our brain tends to lock in on that: It's like a puzzle.\n\n2) Cool sonics and sounds that are interesting. Both of these are using non-standard instrumentation, and again, our brain likes to puzzle out, “What is that?\"\n\n3) Strong moods that sum up the show. You can tell from the themes that 'Better Call Saul' is set in the West and has a sense of humor, and that 'The Lincoln Lawyer' is slick and mysterious.\n\nRemember: our brains love questions and a sense of what comes next. Think about that next time you’re writing music or producing something.\n\nAND... I couldn’t help it. I downloaded the themes off Netflix and they sounded AWFUL, like this...\n\nSO I confess... I ran them through our new WOW Thing and then through the El Juan Limiter and they sounded much better! Here’s a before and after I made...\n\n​​​​​Cutting Vocals\n\nWe kinda touched on this a few weeks ago, that vocals need to be thinned out somewhat in the mix to get them to sit right (and easily).\n\nThe problem is standing too close to the damn mic. BACK UP.\n\nClick here for more thoughts on this.\n\nThe struggle against our eventual robot overlords continues\n\nAnother AI product aimed at making creative work fast, cheap and coincidentally, uncreative?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tL5X8kuuGs\n\nContrast that crap to the Cleveland School of Rock Video we started with and be glad you’re not a robot.\n\nAt your request\n\nYou can now see back issues of New Monday online here: https://korneffaudio.com/new-monday-newsletter/\n\nWe are experimenting with the format a bit.

Please let us know what you like.\n\nDan and Luke\n\nHappy Monday\n\nUh oh! We’ve wound up in Britpop, the early 90s music movement that brought the world bands like Oasis, Pulp, Suede, the Verve and Blur, amongst others.\n\nBritpop is very English, with songs about English themes sung with English accents and harkening back to the English Music Hall tradition, which was the Empire’s version of Vaudeville. Obviously Britpop builds on music by The Beatles, Queen, 10CC and David Bowie, but also stuff from the 80s like The Smiths, XTC, the Cure, et al. Blur in particular channels Mott the Hoople. Singer Daman Albarn does a killer Ian Hunter impression.\n\nAside from Oasis, none of these bands did much in the US, which is a pity because there is some first-class songwriting, and, like a lot of music out of England, fantastic production.\n\nEspecially Blur. If you’re into extravagant production, listening to Blur for a few days will definitely give you a bunch of ideas.\n\nHere are some mixing takeaways from several days of squinting at the Parklife album from 1993. By the way, these are just good mixing ideas in general.\n\nThe more sources you have, the more they should be MONO\n\nAnd this makes sense if you think about it: stereo mic’ing adds width and phase shift and ambiance, all of which will turn into sonic clutter as more and more of it gets added in. So, think one mic, one source, or 1 input one keyboard/amp simulator. On most of the mixes on Parklife the drums are mono down the center.\n\nThink CONTRAST rather than Reverb\n\nYou’ll get more depth and drama out of a mix when most of it is dry and only a few things have reverb on them. Again, the more stuff you throw into a mix, the more things get masked, and reverb and echo really mask things up. Listen to good mixes and you might hear a very wet drum sound in there, but chances are it only sounds wet when it’s highlighted by the arrangement. When it’s part of the mix, dry it up. When it’s by itself, wet it up.\n\nThink CONTRAST Left and Right\n\nUse the left and right and down just leave stuff in the middle. Especially on songs that are headphone ear candy. Parklife has things panning everywhere, in some cases languidly migrating from one channel to another. It’s fun! It’s interesting! It’s easy to automate!\n\nOften on Parklife, a percussive part might be on the left, and something smoother and more sustained on the right. Or a percussive part is layered over a sustained part of the same channel so the two parts contrast rather than combine. In general these guys not only thought about what they were playing, but how it was going to fit into the big picture sonically.\n\nCONTRAST by Sections\n\nContrast by sections. The verse has a distinct sound from the chorus. Perhaps the verse sounds spacious and the chorus sounds claustrophobic. There are clicky guitar parts on the verse and legato parts on the chorus. Change things up, in other words.\n\nTHIN Things Out!\n\nGood lord, if there is one thing to remember it is this!\n\n​​​​Everything is thinned. There’s an octave between 200Hz and 400hz, and there’s an octave between 2000hz and 4000hz. But one octave has only 200 little frequency guys between the two while the other has 2000 little frequency guys in there. But what is up above 2kHz? Cymbals? Violin overtones? Annoying keyboard patches?\n\nContrast that to what’s down between, oh, 150hz to 900hz. Like, EVERYTHING lives down there. Just about every instrument or vocal range has most of its fundamentals in that range. It's like the kitchen at a party: everyone wants to be in the kitchen. So, to get ridiculous clarity, either you arrange things — not everyone gets to be down in that area at the same time — or you have to thin things way way out. So, the bass gets its little own space, the guitars get their own little space, etc. Think of an elevator. There’s a weight limit. You can have a lot of people in it, but they have to be skinny.\n\nThin out the vocals. If you back a singer a few feet off the mic in a pretty dead room you get a thinner vocal that blends well in a mix and doesn’t have a huge amount of muddy warmth. Yes, you can shelve out the bottom end, but it is better to just not record what you don’t want. In general, to me it sounds like Blur isn’t constantly close mic’d. There’s true acoustic space involved.\n\nFocus Focus Focus!\n\nParklife (and really, almost any good record) is mixed like someone directing a movie. During a movie, the director points the camera and tells the audience “You’re looking at this now.” A good mix works the same way: you’re listening to the vocals now, and now you’re hearing a drum break, and now it’s a guitar solo, etc. In other words, the listener is guided. The arrangement does this, and the mixing does this. PICK what is important. Make it louder. Change what is important on occasion. Let importance shift from part to part.\n\nA Question and an Answer\n\nWe got an interesting question last week. Loyal reader Keith asks: “What plugins does Dan use? Is only Korneff or does he use others? The answer: Dan uses mainly Korneff stuff. In fact, often we develop a new plug-in because Dan has been using something from some other company and wants to improve on it. So, Keith, Dan uses the plug-in he designs all the damn time. And Luke almost exclusively so because he doesn’t feel like wasting time auditioning things. He just wants to rock and roll.\n\nA Question for YOU\n\nNew Monday keeps evolving. We need some feedback from you all on how to make it better and more useful to you. We want you to be excited and inspired at 10am on Monday when you check your email. What do you like? What do you want more of? What do you want less of?\n\nDan and Luke\n\nHappy Monday. It’s March 11th.\n\n​​​Happy 311\n\nOh no! 311 the band?\n\nYep! They celebrate their existence with a concert every 3/11 since their start in the early 90’s, although this year they celebrated yesterday in Las Vegas.\n\nThese guys were all over the radio in their time and were a counterpoint to grunge.\n\nOh that snare! It’s one of the most distinctive things about a 311 record. Instantly recognizable with a ton of ping and ring. I love snare sounds like that. Anyway, check out this short vid with 311 drummer Chad Sexton: it’s not the snare. it’s how he hits it. He’s a great player.\n\nVIDEO: Chad on how to hit it...\n\nSo, here’s 311’s Beautiful Disaster. Have a listen.\n\nLet’s concentrate on dual heavy guitar parts.\n\nOften, doubled heavy guitar parts turn into a bland, undifferentiated goopy wall of sound, like someone dumped gravy over everything on the plate so the potatoes taste the same as the beef.\n\nThe 311 guys manage to get something heavy and the gtr on the left is distinct from the gtr on the right. If you listen, you’ll hear the guitar on the right has more midrange to it and the one on the left has the mids scooped out. The sounds stand out from each other and yet interlock.\n\nHow to do this? Use different amp/guitar combinations. Change things up. Can’t use a different guitar? Change the amp. Can’t change up the guitar and amp? Swap in different mics. Stuck with the same mic? MOVE THE MIC AROUND. Record one with the mic close, and the other with the mic further away. Eq them differently.\n\nUse Ray’s guitar micing trick\n\nMy friend Ray would unplug the guitar and crank the amp way up so that there was a lot of hiss (white noise sorta stuff) coming out of the cabinet. Then, he’d get down on the floor, cover one of his ears and move his head around closer and farther from the cabinet until the hiss sounded bright and warm - as full as possible, and then he’d stick the mic right in the spot where his ear was. and he got a great sound - full, with a good representation of the cabinet.\n\nWhat was Ray listening for? On a 4x12 cabinet, Ray was finding where all of the speakers on the cabinet and cabinet resonances were overall very much in-phase.\n\nRecord one part Ray style, and the other do your usual mic stuck right up against the grill.\n\nHere’s Steve Albini’s ideas on this exact topic\n\nHere’s Dan talking about how he gets guitar sounds in a Podcast.\n\nLast Thing\n\nClick here: it’s Quick, Inane and Funny\n\nHow are we doing?\n\nWe love hearing from readers and we're always looking for feedback. How are we doing with New Monday? Is there anything you'd like to see more or less of? What aspect of New Monday do you enjoy the most?\n\nHit reply and say hello - we'd love to hear from you.\n\nDan and Luke\n\nHappy Monday. One thing leads to another.\n\n​​​Happy Accidents\n\nHonestly, this is the whole point: Letting shit happen and then recognizing that it's good shit (or flushing it if it's bad).\n\nA happy accident is when something unintended turns out to be better than any idea you had or thing you tried to make.\n\nA great song is a series of happy accidents connected by music theory. A great production is a series of happy accidents connected by moments of waiting for the next happy accident.\n\nA good creative environment is one where happy accidents are encouraged.\n\nTalent is recognizing happy accidents when they happen.\n\nThis whole newsletter is a happy accident. Because of google searches for Shaun Ryder last week, all sorts of content about him is popping up on my feed. Happy accident? Perhaps. But what is important is that I spotted it.\n\nSo... here Shaun Ryder discusses a GREAT happy accident:\n\nShaun Ryder Explains\n\nAnd here’s a link to the song he’s talking about:\n\nGorillaz ‘Dare’ video\n\nDamn, that is a really catchy groove, Just two chords - like an A to a G. Gorillaz do interesting stuff.\n\nAnother fun one, this time courtesy of New Order. You wouldn’t think that a group that is sequenced and, well, orderly, would crop up here. But they do... a quick vid:\n\nNew Order Blue Monday\n\nAn Accident?\n\nThis popped up on my feed. I'm not a fan of the band, but this will scoop part of your brain out and smear it on the wall.\n\nIt's a room mic feed of EVH recording Eruption. From a talkback mic? Drum overheads? Miscellaneous leakage?\n\nWhatever. It's spectacular playing, and in this recording context, it's pretty clear he dropped that solo like a bomb in one take.\n\nOn the album, with that goofy panning and awful reverb... the slickness of it makes me think it was \"worked on.\" Punched in. Comp'd. Done with mirrors.\n\nBut the link below sounds like one incredible take. Leaps from one happy accident to another.\n\nEruption by Mic Leakage\n\nThink about how the processing changes the perception.\n\nHere’s a longer discussion of how this came to be.\n\nHappy Accidents and AI\n\nJust to tie the past few weeks together: AI can’t recognize a happy accident. It’s capable of screwing up, but it can’t decide if the screw-up is a keeper.\n\nRemember you have a human superpower right now that gives you an advantage over AI. You have an opinion, and you have taste. Cultivate that over skills.\n\nDan and Luke\n\nWe hope you’re finding this monday thing inspirational and a little bit educational. Let us know how we can make it better.\n\nHappy Monday. Hmm...\n\n​​​Happy Mondays\n\nWe only just noticed that this email series shares a name with an English rock band from the 80s, Happy Mondays.\n\nThese guys were ahead of their time. They sort of “invented\" their time.\n\nHappy Mondays pioneered looping, often cutting up drum and bass drum parts into loops and then playing as a band live over them. The result is an interesting fusion of rock and dance music. The songs are more grooves than anything else, but the things they put over them are wild, noisy and yet musical. These are really interesting recordings.\n\nDRUMS - Gary Whelan plays loops and then puts even more drums over them. And he’s a great player.\n\nBASS BASS BASS - Paul Ryder is the god of simple, perfect bass grooves. He could have played for Motown.\n\nVOCALS - Shaun Ryder is one of those vocalists who really can’t sing but somehow it works really well.\n\nGUITARS - Mark Day is one of those interesting players nobody seems to know about. Cool guitar parts and sounds.\n\nAh, so much to steal... Enough - listen to this album....\n\nPills Thrills and Bellyaches\n\nMics leak from the FRONT... a recording tip\n\nIf you’re getting bleed into a cardioid mic, chances are putting gobos and stuff behind it to block stuff out isn’t going to make much of a difference.\n\nCardioid mics already reject sounds behind them really really well. Most of the bleed getting in from behind is going to be low frequency, and not much is ever going to stop low-frequency bleed because cardioids tend to go omni a bit at low frequencies (and low frequencies tend to go around or through objects without a lot of difficulty anyway. Hard to stop bass.).\n\nSo, where is the bleed coming from? It’s coming in the front of the mic, along with the sound you’re trying to record. It’s coming in “over your shoulder.\"\n\nHow to deal? First, there’s the direct-to-reflection ratio. Is the direct sound getting in a lot louder than the leakage getting in? Let’s call this ratio Acoustic Separation - the difference between the thing you want to hear and the thing you don’t want to hear.\n\nTypically, acoustic separation is defined as 26dB: in other words, the direct sound should read 26dB higher on the meter than the indirect sound. In the studio, that’s pretty hard to get, but even a 10 or 15dB difference is going to be fine. Less than that and you will run into problems.\n\nIn the home studio, the best vocal booth you have is a closet stuffed full of clothes. Set up your mic facing into the closet - maybe a few inches outside of it but pointing into it and all the clothes. Then, stick your vocalist INTO the closet facing out at the mic. Yes, they should have clothes all around them. You’ll be amazed at how dead and clean that vocal will be.\n\nDan and Luke\n\nFeel free to send us comments. We always love to hear from you.\n\n​​​AI Music\n\nUndoubtedly AI is the future of music production, just like the microwave is the future of cooking.\n\nSuno.ai is fun in a scary way. Make an account for free, put in a prompt, and get a song a few seconds later.\n\nThe prompt was “Romantic pop ballad about alien abduction.” The result is this link here.\n\nIt’s not bad, and there are even some interesting chord changes leading into the chorus that are stealable. Humans have written worse songs.\n\nSorta wish the lyrics were more like, “Gorgax strapped me to a table and pulled out a machine” rather than “Star crossed lover looked in my eyes” but perhaps the AI was set for PG.\n\nWhat do you think? A good way to generate ideas? A fun thing to do on Valentines Day? A creative way to tell your boss to take this job and shove it? A means of singing goodbye to your career in music?\n\nWill.I.Am has some very cogent thoughts on the topic of AI. See the short vid here...\n\nAll Hail the Dyna Comp\n\nExploring unintended uses of audio equipment ranks high among Dan’s top studio pleasures. Enter The MXR 102 Dyna Comp: a guitar compressor pedal from 1972.\n\nIt's far from being the most Hi-FI piece of gear but it possesses genuine character and is readily accessible.\n\nThe brain of this circuit is an OTA (Operational Transconductance Amplifier), which adjusts signal volume based on its input. An Envelope Detector calculates the magnitude of the signal and gives the OTA current feedback relative to the input volume, boosting weaker signals. The distinctive sound of this pedal is linked to corrective equalization which helps tone down the noise. This makes it a perfect candidate to \"use and abuse\" in unintended ways.\n\nDan’s fave use, believe it or not, is as a really aggressive vocal compressor. It's over the top, in a great way, and helps create unique sounds that catch your ear.\n\nIt's also been rumored that the legend Randy Staub used this as a kick drum compressor.\n\nDon't forget, these things run at instrument level, so you'll need to convert to/from line level before you patch into your rig. There are dedicated devices that make this process simple, like the Radial Engineering EXTC. Or you can use a reamp and DI box to get the job done.\n\nYou can also just plug the damn thing in and see what happens, but whenever you do frankenstein games like this, don’t wear headphones and keep the speakers off or really low until you figure out if it’s working. You only get one set of ears.\n\nHappy experimenting!\n\nDan and Luke\n\nFeel free to send us comments. We always love to hear from you."
