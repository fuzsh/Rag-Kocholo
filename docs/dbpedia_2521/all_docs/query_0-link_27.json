        "text": "Already christened \"The Red Album\" by fans, Weezer's third eponymously titled album sees the progenitors of emo still frantically chasing their tail. For the first time, frontman Rivers Cuomo shares lead vocals and songwriting credits with his bandmates, but apart from Brian Bell's gently seething Thought I Knew, Cuomo's altruism leads to more messy diversity, and his midlife crisis continues to query his pop sensibilities. The nostalgic rush of Everybody Gets Dangerous crumbles into the acoustic Heart Songs, a lovingly drawn map of Cuomo's musical universe. Pork and Beans adds a power pop classic to the band's inconsistent canon, its speedy rhythm a throwback to breakthrough hit Buddy Holly, its hero an aging, grumpy hipster. But though the rap-prog-acoustic extravaganza The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations On a Shaker Hymn) has the cheeky bombast - and falsetto - of Bohemian Rhapsody, the geeky irony, tinged with desperation, is pure Weezer."
