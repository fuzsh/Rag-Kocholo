        "text": "10/16: Countdown to best Weezer albums, Red to Blue\n\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of Weezer's self-titled debut, the unlikeliest modern-rock radio staple of the early '90s, fueled by Rivers Cuomo's cult of nerdy personality, sing-along hooks and a blanket of fuzz.\n\nThe first of three self-titled Weezer albums, \"The Blue Album,\" as it came to be rechristened, would go on to sell more than 3 million copies, largely on the strength of three great videos: \"Undone — The Sweater Song,\" the \"Happy Days\"-themed \"Buddy Holly\" and \"Say It Ain't So.\"\n\n\"Pinkerton,\" a second album based in part on \"Madame Butterfly,\" killed the momentum, but it's now remembered in some circles as the greatest Weezer album ever, going on to win a five-star salute in \"The New Rolling Stone Album Guide.\"\n\nAnd while they've yet to top those first two efforts, Weezer's catalog is packed with albums well worth warming up to, including this year's \"comeback\" effort, \"Everything Will Be Alright in the End.\"\n\nIt's with that in mind that we begin our countdown to their greatest triumphs from their least essential moment, the third of those self-titled efforts. (And even that one had its moments).\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 16. Arizona State Fair, 1826 W. McDowell Road, Phoenix. $25 reserved; general admission is free with fair admission. 602-252-6771, azstatefair.com.\n\n10. \"Weezer\" a k a \"The Red Album\" (2008)\n\nThe third self-titled Weezer album is a long way off from \"Buddy Holly.\" But the hooks on lead-off single \"Pork and Beans,\" which spent 11 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart, are fairly undeniable. Inspired by a meeting with the label suits, who said they didn't hear a hit, the single gets in several classic swipes at an industry grasping at straws. After starting off strong with \"They say I need some Rogaine to put in my hair,\" it peaks when Cuomo turns his attention to the compromises artists now routinely make to reach the masses (\"Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts. Maybe if I work with him I can perfect the art\"). Other tracks try even harder to be funny to diminishing returns, from \"Troublemaker\" to \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Theme),\" a nearly six-minute suite that sets the tone with the demoralizing line, \"You try to play cool like you just don't care/But soon I'll be playing in your underwear.\"\n\n9. \"Raditude\" (2009)\n\nThe flying dog on the cover of an album titled \"Raditude\" is the first sign that they may be off the mark here. But the surest sign is when they bring in Lil Wayne to guest rap on a track called \"Can't Stop Partying,\" in which Cuomo actually invests his energies in singingthis: \"I gotta have Patron, I gotta have the beat/I gotta have a lot of pretty girls around me.\" As for Lil Wayne, he seems to be there mainly as a set-up for the lyric, \"Okay bitch, it's Weezer and it's Weezy.\" How clever is that? A few songs rise about the fray, most notably the hand-jive-flavored old-school rock and roll of \"(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To.\" But in the end, it sounds like what it is — a shameless bid to find a home for Weezer on the pop charts in an age when rock songs are in short supply. Which explains the checks their label cut to Lil Wayne, Jermaine Dupri and Dr. Luke.\n\n8. \"Death to False Metal\" (2010)\n\nDoes this even count as an album? Some of the tracks had been gathering dust since 1998, and the bulk of the album is made up of outtakes from the \"Make Believe\" and \"Red Album\" sessions. But when the hooks are as catchy as \"Turning Up The Radio,\" it's hard to argue, whether you share the man's nostalgia for the pop songs of the '80s or not. What's weird is that it feels more like an album than it has a right to. And they sign off with \"Un-Break My Heart,\" a heartfelt if melodramatic Toni Braxton cover that's so much better than it has a right to be, it singlehandedly makes up for any flaws that may precede it. The solo alone would make this album worth your while. Toss in the anguish in Cuomo's falsetto and it's feeling more like an essential purchase.\n\n7. \"Hurley (2010)\n\nThis albums kicks off with \"Memories,\" a bittersweet shot of nostalgia that rocks the drum beat to the Velvet Underground's \"I'm Waiting for the Man\" while someone bangs on a piano like the early Stooges. And it sounds like there's actually something at stake as Rivers wallows in nostalgia for the days of \"playing hacky sack back when Audioslave was still Rage\" before confessing \"I want to be there again\" coming out of the chorus. If the rest of the album rarely lives up to the promise of that first track, it still counts as a return to form as Cuomo makes his way through tracks as memorableas \"Ruling Me\" (a power-pop gems with chugging post-Ramones guitars) and \"Run Away,\" which makes the most of Cuomo's aching vocal. And ending the album with a wistful, existential ode to aging is a nice touch that would have been hard to imagine, hell, as recently as \"The Red Album.\"\n\n6. \"Everything Will Be Alright in the End\" (2014)\n\nMore often than not, when an album is hailed as an artist returning to form, it ends up feeling more like people just got tired of not liking an old friend and felt like maybe we could hug it out and everything would alright in the end, as they say. But there are way too many moments here that feel like classic Weezer to ignore the hype, with some epic, majestic guitar parts and a refreshing retreat from their goofier lyrical impulses. There's even an apology to fans for having lost their way: \"Sorry guys I didn't realize that I needed you so much / I thought I'd get a new audience, I forgot that disco sucks / I ended up with nobody and I started feeling dumb / Maybe I should play the lead guitar and Pat should play the drums.\" But the pop sensibilities ring truer than the \"Sorry guys\" on such obvious highlights as \"Ain't Got Nobody,\" \"Eulogy for a Rock Band,\" \"The British Are Coming\" and \"Go Away.\"\n\n5. \"Make Believe\" (2005)\n\nThey crash the gate with the sludge-rocking swagger of \"Beverly Hills,\" a Top 10 smash in which the singer's childlike fantasies of living like a king are offset by a spoken-word admission of \"The truth is, I don't stand a chance/Its something that you're born into/And I just don't belong.\" Produced with precision by the king of less-is-more, Rick Rubin, \"Beverly Hills\" remains their highest-charting entry on the Hot 100, and it's one of two tracks here that topped the modern-rock charts — the other being \"Perfect Situation,\" a power-pop gem fueled by fuzzy guitar hooks and yearning, emotional vocals from Cuomo. But the highlight may be \"Hold Me,\" a bittersweet ballad that eases in with Cuomo, accompanied only by a finger-picked guitar, admitting, \"I am terrified of all things, frightened of the dark.\" The other guys come crashing in to join him on the chorus, but he still sounds desperate and alone as he begs to be held and taken with you \"'cause I'm lonely.\"\n\n4. \"Maladroit\" (2002)\n\nCuomo's inner metalhead had always been a factor, hanging posters of his favorite rock group, Kiss, on the walls of the family garage he salutes on \"The Blue Album.\" But \"Maladroit\" is where he gives that inner metalhead the wheel, a hard-rock backlash to the New Wave Candy-O of 2001 with more than a slight hint of early Cheap Trick in the heavy guitar riffs. Meanwhile, lurking just below the surface of the Ozzfest-worthy chunka-chunk of those guitars? More candy-coated pop hooks, naturally, from \"American Gigolo\" to \"Dope Nose\" — yes, \"Dope Nose.\"\n\n3. \"Weezer,\" a k a \"The Green Album\" (2001)\n\n\"Blue Album\" producer Ric Ocasek of the Cars was back at the wheel for the poppiest Weezer album ever, a portrait in chugging guitar riffs and bittersweet melodies. Its 10 songs weighing in at less than 30 minutes, \"The Green Album\" traded the sexual tension, ambition and edge that made \"Pinkerton\" matter for a cuter, more accessible approach while still delivering the goods in highlights ranging from the handclap-driven \"Photograph\" to \"Don't Let Go.\" And \"Island in the Sun\" is Cuomo at his most contagious, a soft-rock gem that really hits its stride when the waves of distortion wash over the mix.\n\n2. \"Pinkerton\" (1996)\n\nVoted one of 1996's three worst albums by Rolling Stone readers, \"Pinkerton\" flopped in a big way at the time. But not unlike the Velvet Underground's first album, nearly everyone who got it formed a band. It's darker than the first one, with a concept based on \"Madame Butterfly\" and an opening line that may have pushed the loser cred a bit too far (\"I'm tired, so tired, I'm tired of having sex\"). A station could have lost its Trojan ads for playing that. But that awkward confessional tone is what makes it a classic — well, that and the sonic assault, an abrasive retreat from the fuzzy but slick Ric Ocasek production of the first one. Even Cuomo's vocals had moved in an edgier direction. The guitar sound alone should have gone triple-platinum. Highlights range from \"Tired of Sex\" to \"Across The Sea,\" a wistful ballad inspired by a Japanese girl's fan mail (\"I could never touch you/I think it would be wrong/I got your letter/You've got my song.\").\n\n1. \"Weezer,\" a k a \"The Blue Album\" (1994)"
