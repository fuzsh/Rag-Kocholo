Then, there's Pinkerton, an exploratory foray into heartfelt emotion, initially baffling critics but ultimately influencing the emo music scene. Fast forward to the recent years, and you have the intriguing baroque-pop sound of OK Human, and the vibrant nostalgia of Van Weezer, an homage to classic '80's glam rock. Each of these albums showcases Weezer's deft ability to experiment within the rock genre, while always ensuring an authentic and distinct sound.\n\nComprising of 15 studio albums, Weezer's discography is certainly no short list and that's why your vote counts.

Dive into our ranking, cast your vote, and contribute to the ongoing debate. After all, this is not just a ranking. It's a celebration of Weezer's captivating journey through the realm of rock."
