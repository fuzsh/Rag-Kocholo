        "text": "American alternative rock band Weezer formed in 1992. Led by Rivers Cuomo (lead vocals, guitar), Patrick Wilson (drums, guitar, backing vocals), Brian Bell (guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and Scott Shriner (bass, backing vocals, keyboards). With an array of albums and EPs, and a DVD, Weezer has sold over nine million records in the U.S. to date. Their notable singles include \"Buddy Holly,\" \"Undone - The Sweater Song,\" \"Say It Ain't So,\" \"Perfect Situation,\" \"Island in the Sun,\" \"Beverly Hills,\" and \"Pork and Beans.\"\n\nSet to tour the UK in June 2024, alongside The Smashing Pumpkins, they'll start off at Birmingham Utilita Arena on 7 June, and visit London, Dublin, Glasgow and Manchester before wrapping up the tour at Cardiff Castle on 14 June. Fans might spot that both bands will be in Europe during the start of the summer festival season, sparking speculation that we might see Pumpkins and Weezer playing in a few fields around these dates...\n\nWeezer last visited the UK on Green Day’s Hella Mega stadium tour in 2022, which also featured emo icons Fall Out Boy. The dates will come one month after Weezer’s self-titled debut album, commonly known as ‘The Blue Album’ celebrates its 30th anniversary. In anticipation of their return to the UK, we thought we'd take a look through some of the Deep Cuts in their back catalogue.\n\nSusanne\n\n\"Susanne,\" initially the B-side to \"Undone – The Sweater Song,\" later featured on the deluxe reissue of Weezer's 1994 debut. The song draws inspiration from a devoted Geffen A&R assistant. They were a huge supporter of the band during their early career, went above and beyond, baking brownies for them and fostering a positive environment as they prepared for the release of their first major label album. The song also nods to Guns N' Roses, a fellow Geffen act, with lyrics like \"Even Izzy, Slash and Axl Rose/When I call you put them all on hold.\" Originally, the line included Kurt Cobain alongside Axl Rose, but Cuomo, out of respect for Cobain's passing the same year as The Blue Album's release, chose to omit the reference.\n\nBurndt Jamb\n\nInitially an instrumental, the \"Maladroit\" track takes a sweet start before unleashing a powerful riff amidst verses exploring lost love. The band later added lyrics, transforming it into an album track for their 2002 release.\n\nKing\n\nBass guitarist Scott Shriner, a member since 2001, took the lead vocals on \"King\", a bonus track from the Red Album. His Scott Weiland-esque delivery infused the song with a grungier, heavier tone, diverging from Weezer's usual power pop sound.\n\nThe Angel and The One\n\nThe last track on Weezer's sixth album stands out as arguably the best on there. It begins with Cuomo on soft electric, challenging rejected-neckbeard beliefs with acceptance. As the band joins in, the song evolves into an earnest expression of \"peace\" and \"shalom,\" avoiding overly sentimental tones. Surprisingly, it has been performed live only once.\n\nSimple Pages\n\nAlthough reminiscent of \"Perfect Situation,\" this track predates it by four years. The irresistible repetition in Cuomo's angsty and catchy verse is quintessentially Weezer.\n\nI Just Threw Out the Love Of My Dreams\n\n\"I Just Threw Out...\" is a unique Weezer track from the abandoned Songs from the Black Hole project, showcasing an unusual blend of head-bopping joy and misery. It stands out as the sole Weezer song with lead vocals from an external artist, aside from Lil Wayne's contribution to \"Can't Stop Partying.\"\n\nEulogy For a Rock Band\n\nWeezer's 2014 album \"Everything Will Be Alright In the End\" is filled with deep cuts, yet it produced four strong singles. Considered their best since 2002's \"Maladroit\" and possibly their most realized work since 1996's \"Pinkerton,\" the standout track is \"Eulogy for a Rock Band.\" In this song, Cuomo's genius self-awareness explores the limitations of a veteran rock act, set against a backdrop of riffs reminiscent of their self-titled debut.\n\nFind the full list of notable mentions below plus tickets for their 2023 shows!\n\nFind Tickets\n\nKeep up to date with your favourite artists, priority bookings, and exclusive offers from See Tickets:"
