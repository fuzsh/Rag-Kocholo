        "text": "What you'll find, however, is a lot of low-fi and smooth soul juxtaposed by maddening experimental rock and blasting hip-hop. It's simple meeting the scatterbrained. But it's all big, and it's all good.\n\n1. \"Time to Pretend,\" MGMT — The New York duo gave its state of the union in \"Time to Pretend,\" the most fun music had in 2008. Experimental-pop kings Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden bring the year's coolest groove, a combination of drums, synth blips and techno-garble, but contrast by jamming a fork down Generation Y's \"live fast, do nothing\" lifestyle by embracing drugs, vacationing and playing around. \"I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world,\" they scream, before admitting \"everything will run its course!\" The story of our lives.\n\n2. \"Oh Girl,\" Raphael Saadiq — Instantly, superproducer Saadiq's \"Oh Girl\" lays you into a smooth world of neosoul bliss. Behind a slow and steady pulse, Saadiq enunciates his love poem to his one and only, as a sexy bells-and-guitar combo tips the melody. It's smooth as butter, cool as ice, dreamlike as anything you'll hear in soul music. Part of Saadiq's stunning \"The Way I See It,\" \"Oh Girl\" is the most rewarding soul groove in years.\n\n3. \"Live Your Life,\" T.I. feat. Rihanna — Blend rap's top mainstream lyricist and R&B's queen of dance-pop, and you have the defiant hip-hop anthem of 2008. We know T.I. can rhyme proficiently when he wants, and we know Rihanna can deliver the goods on a dime, so concentrate on the the melody — purposefully in minor keys — backed by nervous strings, a curious organ and big-boy beats. It's everything we love about hip-hop, tied off by an uber-positive message. In the song's intro, T.I. exclaims, \"Rihanna, let's get it!\" They got it.\n\n4. \"Golden Age,\" TV on the Radio — If the golden age TV on the Radio sings about sounds anything like \"Golden Age,\" we're all in for a treat. Its electro-funk beat fuels a fuzz-filled exclamation predicting what treasures lie ahead. Kyp Malone gives the scatterbrained lyrics a sputtering vocal treatment, before Tunde Adebimpe breaks in with a charging rap and defining chorus. When they collaborate for the bridge, the words \"Love, don't you falter,\" take a higher meaning: The unity behind \"Golden Age\" has enough power to bring all the good people together.\n\n5. \"Chasing Pavements,\" Adele — Twenty-year-old British soulstress Adele handed the world a slice of shattered soul with \"Chasing Pavements,\" a song that has garnered a wealth of Grammy Award nominations. While the song is about questioning a relationship, it found greater interpretation as it met more ears. And its attractiveness is undeniable — the basic soul groove is backed by a flurry of strings, harkening to the classic soul of the 1970s. Adele's voice, a combination of velvet and sugar crystals, adds to the tears.\n\n6. \"Move,\" Q-Tip — The first time you hear \"Move,\" you don't know what to do — dance, listen intently or check the CD because it may have a scratch. Produced by the late J-Dilla, \"Move\" knocks you out with its devastating beat, thanks to a sample of the Jackson 5's \"Dancing Machine.\" Part of his 2008 release \"The Renaissance,\" Q-Tip uses \"Move\" to reintroduce himself to everyone, calling himself \"the captain of the hot-butter caravan.\" Now that's ego.\n\n7. \"Low,\" Flo-Rida featuring T-Pain — \"Apple-bottom jeans! Boots with the fur!\" If you entered a club in 2008, you heard hundreds of young ladies scream that very line at the tops of their lungs. Flo-Rida — with help from the always-game T. Pain — made a name for himself with \"Low.\" It's a ready-made club banger with all the trimmings: hot beat, synthesizer bleeps, handclaps, crazy rhymes, a lot of yelling. Every other club banger bowed before it.\n\n8. \"Oxford Comma,\" Vampire Weekend — If you've fought with a teacher, editor or co-worker over grammar, the first line of \"Oxford Comma\" will make you giggle. Even if you've never given a ... about an oxford comma, you'll like Vampire Weekend's low-key, low-fi hit. Featuring a laughable guitar solo and Playskool-style electric organ line, \"Oxford Comma\" plays like its lyrics: These New York boys just don't give a ... you know.\n\n9. \"California Girls,\" the Magnetic Fields — Brian Wilson wrote a loving ode about the ladies of California in 1965; the Magnetic Fields wrote a seething memo about them in 2008. First, the lyrics: \"Looking down their perfect noses/at me and my kind/do they think we won't/well, nevermind.\" Now, the sound: A totally feedback-laden performance (their 2008 album \"Distortion\" featured songs with nothing but distortion) that most intuitive listeners couldn't decipher easily. And yet, past all the grumbling, the song itself is sunny and melodic. How perfect.\n\n10. \"Sour Cherry,\" the Kills — Grabbing attention on the CW's \"Gossip Girl,\" the Kills' \"Sour Cherry\" is a playful little romp about, well, a sour cherry in a fruit stand. But it superbly seizes the essence of modernity. Simply enough with some bass and scattered drums, Alison Mosshart (VV) and Jamie Hince (Hotel) pinch out a racy vocal, creating a quick, sexy pop song perfect for the youth of America.\n\n11. “Lay It Down” — Al Green\n\n12. “White Winter Hymnal” — Fleet Foxes\n\n13. “Graveyard Girl” — M83\n\n14. “American Boy” — Estelle\n\n15. “Be Mine!” — Robyn\n\n16. “Family Tree” — TV on the Radio\n\n17. “A Milli” — Lil Wayne\n\n18. “After Hours” — We Are Scientists\n\n19. “We Are Rockstars” — Does It Offend You, Yeah?\n\n20. “Strange Times” — the Black Keys\n\n21. “Neon Beanbag” — Stereolab\n\n22. “Lollipop” — Lil Wayne\n\n23. “So What” — Pink\n\n24. “Love Lockdown” — Kanye West\n\n25. “That’s Not My Name” — the Ting Tings\n\n26. “Viva la Vida” — Coldplay\n\n27. “Bleeding Love” — Leona Lewis\n\n28. “Electric Feel” — MGMT\n\n29. “Your English Is Good” — Tokyo Police Club\n\n30. “With Every Heartbeat” — Robyn\n\n31. “Stoner-Hate” — Scars on Broadway\n\n32. “Conquest” — Tapes ’n Tapes\n\n33. “The Girl” — City and Colour\n\n34. “My People” — Erykah Badu\n\n35. “Danny Callahan” — Conor Oberst\n\n36. “I Kissed a Girl” — Katy Perry\n\n37. “Machine Gun” — Portishead\n\n38. “Nothing Too Much Just Out of Sight” — the Fireman\n\n39. “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” — Beyoncé\n\n40. “Every Heart Broken” — Sugarbabes\n\n41. “That Green Gentleman” — Panic at the Disco\n\n42. “And I” — Portugal.
