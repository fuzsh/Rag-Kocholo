Ben Lippen School seeks to glorify God by educating students from a biblical worldview to impact the nations with the message of Christ and by assisting the family and church in equipping students spiritually, academically, socially, and physically under the Lordship of Jesus Christ.

We put God first, focus on academics and our future but we also enjoy our community! We have events year round that keep us grounded in who Ben Lippen is.

Our Events

We offer signature programs curated specifically to provide more opportunities to hone in on areas that students might want to specialize in after Ben Lippen.

Signature programs

As our students move from pre-school to grade 12, we have an end goal in mind: to fully prepare your student for college and beyond, ready to impact and influence the world according to his or her unique gifts. We do this through fully-engaged learning each step of the way.
