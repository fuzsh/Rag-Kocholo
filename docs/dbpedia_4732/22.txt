The Blue Ridge Institute for Theological Education (BRITE) serves the church in all branches of Protestant Christianity by preparing its students to be more faithful and effective church members and followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. The institute seeks to accomplish this by teaching and equipping its students through a program of graduate level theological education, a variety of training seminars, courses, and conferences, with all content based upon the authority of the inerrant Word of God, the sixty-six books of the Bible, and committed to the Reformed faith.

A foundational desire for BRITE is that it would further the health of the church by cultivating biblically, historically, theologically-rooted churchmen and women who will take what they have learned in classroom, in internship, and in mentoring, and inculcate those same priorities in the life of their own local congregation—thus further bolstering the health and vitality of the church of the Lord Jesus Christ for generations to come.

BRITE serves the local and regional church by offering courses, training, and seminars of interest to laypeople in order to equip them for more effective service in their local congregation.

BRITE serves the institutional church by offering formal education to future ministers for whom traditional seminary may not be an option.

BRITE serves the global church in theological education and training by partnering with likeminded churches and missions agencies in advancing our common goal of robust biblical & theological training for all of Christ’s church.
