What's the cause?

Jesus. It's Jesus.

​

​We want our children to continue their purpose-driven, Jesus-centered education at Blue Ridge Christian School because we believe we have something extra special going on inside these walls. We believe in what God is doing in this place. We see the profound impact it has had on our students. We are asking for you to support us in prayer, in labor, and in finance. We need all of these things, but funding is the thing we find we are lacking the most as we dream about God's plan for BRCS. This night is about having a great time while raising money for our beautiful school. So, let's raise some money, then maybe a roof, barn, hallelujah or something....
