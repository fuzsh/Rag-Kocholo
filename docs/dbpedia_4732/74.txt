From the time I was 4 years old I attended Blue Ridge Christian School. The teachers were helpful and always willing to help. I grew not only as a student I grew stronger in my faith. What I would like to see change is the diversity within the school. I never truly had a bad experience. I did have a few trials but, I overcame them and moved forward and completed by educational journey as a high school student.

A truly wonderful school! It is a great atmosphere. The teachers here genuinely care about each and every student. They care about our academics, but also our walk with God. It is a small school, but this makes it so easy to make friends because everyone knows everyone else in the school. I have been attending this school since the first grade. This is my senior year. I was always asked by my parents if I wanted to switch schools. But I always told them no, because I did not want to leave this school. This school, these teachers, and these friends have made an impact on my life, that would not have happened at any other school. Love this place.

Blue Ridge Christian School was a very good school and education experience. It really prepared me for my life today. The teachers and staff want to make each student feel welcomed. I am currently a Junior in college and I can say that Blue Ridge grooms students for the real difficult task of college. I still visit and meet with my previous educators and talk about a lot of things and changes in our lives. I am glad I got the opportunity to be schooled and graduate from Blue Ridge Christian School.
