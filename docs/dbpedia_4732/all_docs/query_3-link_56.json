        "text": "My name is Teresa Murnock. I am one of the founders of King's Light Christian Academy. I have an AS in Radiologic Sciences. I have been a Clinical Instructor at Culpeper Hospital for Radiography students and cross-trained into MRI. I have a passion for designing and building as well. I owned and operated Heavenly Scent Cupcakes and Cakes for 7 years.\n\nMy time beyond my professional work is spent with my two children, my husband, friends, and family. I enjoy reading, studying, hiking, kayaking, biking, and camping. I love the outdoors and taking in the wonder of our Father's creation.\n\nMy passion is for youth and children to know our heavenly Father, Savior, and Holy Spirit. I have served in children's ministry and youth ministry for 13 years and also served on the church leadership team for 2 years. My gifts and talents have been utilized in organizing and running children/youth programs, classes, and activities.\n\nMy hope is to see KLCA be a blessing to our local area and connect the family of God, building relationships and fostering support and encouragement to do His good and glorious work. We are here to partner with parents and help guide and educate with excellence the next generation that will be the salt and light in our world.\n\nMy name is Neal Stuckenschneider. I hold a BA from St. Mary's College of Maryland as an English Literature major, with a minor in Studio Art. Out of college, I taught at Covenant Life School in Gaithersburg, MD for six years, teaching English, Art, PE, and a variety of electives. I'm returning to the classroom after some years in the special events and agricultural industries.\n\nFrom leading church-based youth summer camps, teaching private music lessons and ESOL classes, and coaching baseball and cross-country, I've had broad experience with teaching and with youth.\n\n\"Those who lose their life, for me, will find it\"; where better to lose it than in investing in others? The richness of shared experiences and discoveries are where I've always felt fullness - seeing others grasp hold of new skills and concepts and work creatively with them in ways I wouldn't. God's majesty is observable in these glimpses of enlightenment, and it is uniquely edifying when this takes place in community. We are called to be on the horizon of His creation, stretching forward into the future.\n\nMy name is Noah Wharton, and I have a Bachelor in Middle Education- Social Science.\n\nI finished up at Eastern View High School in the fall of 2018 and received my diploma in May of 2019. My experience working with youth started over a year ago when I began teaching Sunday school at my church. I usually have teenagers and the numbers vary from week to week. Occasionally, I teach Sunday school on Sunday evenings as well.\n\nI had gone to church from time to time when I was little, but I started going regularly once I started my freshman year at Eastern View High School. I became a born-again Christian when I was 16 years old. I like to think of my music as my ministry because it allows me to go and play music at different places and meet new people and share my faith.\n\nBefore Covid, I would play on Sundays at nursing homes such as Autumn Care in Madison or Culpeper Health and Rehab. Some personal hobbies of mine are fishing, playing music, and raising chickens. I believe that I will be a blessing at KLCA because I love history and I want to share that passion with others.\n\nMy name is Adam Forster. I hold both a Bachelor’s and Master’s in theology. Most of my career has been spent in video production, producing hundreds of community television programs, and working on several independent movie sets. In 2011 the Lord led me to begin producing faith-based shows and that’s when I fell in love with telling the stories of our awesome miracle working God. This led me to go back to school and get my degrees in theology.\n\nI have worked with a lot of interns, many still in high school and enjoy teaching them the skills to work on and off camera and even begin a career in the industry. That said I am excited to be the Dean of Character Development and teach theology. I believe that learning about God is the single most important thing a person can do, it’s a process that should last a lifetime.\n\nI enjoy walking my dogs, running my sawmill, and spending time with good friends and family, but most of all I love talking about God and how good he is.\n\nMy name is Brittany Morton. I have a BS in Family and Child Development with minors in Special Education and Psychology from Liberty University. I have experience tutoring math. This past year I taught 6th and 7th-grade math and Algebra 1 and 2 at Banner Christian School, Culpeper.\n\nI have been married 16 years to my high school sweetheart, Jon, and we have 4 kids, Zoë, Josiah, and twins, Seth and Steven. We have been in full-time ministry since 2009, but nine years of that, we spent in youth ministry which is why I love working with and teaching teenagers.\n\nWhile most of my time is used up by my own 4 children, I do enjoy reading a good book, coloring, or marketing my very little Pampered Chef business.\n\nI am excited to be a part of KLCA and help to give godly guidance and equip students for their lives. I am passionate about making sure teens know that not only do I love them, but most importantly, God loves them.\n\nMy name is Teresa Murnock. I am one of the founders of King's Light Christian Academy. I have an AS in Radiologic Sciences. I have been a Clinical Instructor at Culpeper Hospital for Radiography students and cross-trained into MRI. I have a passion for designing and building as well.

We are here to partner with parents and help guide and educate with excellence the next generation that will be the salt and light in our world.\n\nMy name is Jason Murnock, and I’m the proud father of two of KLCA’s first students, and the husband of Teresa Murnock, Administrator. I have had the chance to see KLCA grow from an idea of my wife’s given the lack of Christian High Schools in our area, to the functional school it is today, complete with excellent teachers, staff, a location, and a large family that supports it!\n\nI see the vision and principles of KLCA, and those of a Christian education founded on the Lord and His teachings, as of great importance for our youth and our community. My family and I have always striven to incorporate God’s teachings in our everyday lives. Over the years, I have helped coach my kids’ soccer teams, and co-lead youth group with my wife. We currently attend City Light Baptist Church in Culpeper, where I now teach the 5th graders in AWANA.\n\nMy background is in environmental science. For work, I run a small environmental consulting firm and assist in the sales of a novel, technology-based stormwater management software product to alleviate flooding and boost water quality in our watersheds. In my spare time, I enjoy gardening and working in the yard, particularly on an aquaponics project.\n\nI attended Catholic schools in Erie, PA from first grade through college, where he received an MS in Environmental Science from Gannon University. I am happy to bring this background, my love for the Lord and His creation, and my management and marketing experience to KLCA as a board member.\n\nMy name is Aniscia Bellusci and a co-founder of KLCA. I have had the privilege of working in the medical field for 10 plus years, first in nursing/ medical assistant, and then becoming a Medical Records Director for not only a mental health company but for a nursing home where I would also train other facilities about accurate record keeping, ICD-10, auditing and preparing for State inspections.\n\nI put my career on the back burner to start homeschooling my children. I joined the local homeschooling support group where I was then a member of the board helping to bring resources to homeschoolers in the community. I’ve also helped to start a church in Warrenton, VA where I served on the board, and was the youth director amongst other things\n\nFor the past 6 years, I have been working with the mission group Hope For Appalachia, where now I’m a team lead and have the pleasure of bringing God's good news to about 1500 school-age children in Kentucky every year. I am also the Children’s Ministry Director at my church where I get to do what I love which is serving and teaching children and the youth about God’s love. In my spare time, I enjoy being with family and friends, camping, and serving others.\n\nI’m so excited to be a part of this great mission-KLCA, where I’m praying that we will instill a solid foundation for them to stand on in God's truth so when they graduate and head out into the world their foundation will not be shaken.\n\nMike and Liesa have been board members at KLCA for three years. Mike served four\n\nyears in the United States Air Force prior to entering law enforcement. He served on\n\nthe North Charleston, South Carolinahas and Culpeper Police Departments prior to joining\n\nthe Virginia Beach Police Department in 1984. Mike retired with the rank of Lieutenant\n\nin 2011 after serving assignments in Operations, Investigations, and Personnel and\n\nTraining. He attended Germanna Community College (Associate), St Leo University\n\n(Bachelor), Old Dominion University (18 credit hours in Master of Public Administration),\n\nand Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary (Masters). He have served as the Pastor at\n\nNew Salem Baptist Church since 2009.\n\n,\n\nLiesa grew up in Northern Virginia and attended Fairfax United Methodist Church.\n\nLiesa serves as the Marketing Director at the Harbor at Renaissance in Stanardsville,\n\nVirginia and has worked in the healthcare industry for the past 15 years. She attended\n\nGermanna Community College and has lived in the Culpeper area for the past 13 years.\n\nShe is active in numerous community organizations and teaches several classes on\n\ncaregiving, dementia, and chronic disease self-management. Liesa has served in\n\nchildren’s ministry most of her life including as Director of Children’s Ministry, AWANA\n\nCommander, VBS Director and Children’s Sunday School teacher.\n\nIn addition to serving at New Salem Baptist Church, Mike and Liesa have led Hope for\n\nAppalachia Va Team, Inc, a non-profit ministry that supports children in the Appalachian\n\nmountains of Eastern Kentucky. Currently, Hope for Appalachia supports 35 schools\n\nand approximately 13,000 children living in some of the poorest communities in the\n\nUnited States. This past year they have become active in prison ministry at Northern\n\nNeck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Virginia ministering to 460 inmates.\n\nWe have been married for 38 years and have been blessed with four children. We have\n\ntwo sons, Timothy (Dawn Marie) of Richmond, Virginia, and Gregory (Erin) of Virginia\n\nBeach. Both boys graduated from Greenbriar Christian Academy in Chesapeake,\n\nVirginia. We also have two daughters that we adopted from China, Mikaela, who\n\nattends Germanna Community College, and Ellie, who graduated from Culpeper\n\nChristian School and is currently in the 9th grade at Kings Light Christian Academy. We\n\nhave also been blessed with one grandson, Michael Dodson, who is three years old.\n\nWe enjoy spending time at Maranatha Farm in Boston, Virginia, hiking, gardening, and\n\nspending time with Little Michael in Virginia Beach.\n\nWe believe very strongly in Christian education and in parent’s choice. We are so\n\nthankful that we have been able to be a part of Kings Light Christian Academy. God\n\nhas brought together a group of dedicated and committed Christian leaders and\n\nteachers at KLCA and He continues to bless our school in a mighty way. We are\n\nexcited to see what God has in store for us as we travel this journey together.\n\nMy name is Terese Matricardi. I have been married to my husband Ed for 30 years, and we have three young adult children. I am a Licensed School Psychologist, Licensed Teacher and recent Culpeper County School Board candidate. I homeschooled my children for many years, though they each graduated from Eastern View High School, and are now attending/graduated from the University of Virginia.\n\n,\n\nMy work as a School Psychologist for 28 years has given me an honest understanding of the dangerous realities governing public education today, and I believe that the educational institutions that facilitate the hearts, minds, and souls of our children are sacred endeavors worth preserving with our faith.\n\nI am a member of Our Lady of the Blue Ridge Catholic Church which I attend with my family. I enjoy theology (with a specific interest in the writings of CS Lewis), history, cooking, gardening, ballet, piano, and interior design.\n\nAs a Christian I believe we all ultimately answer to God, and as Edmund Burke said, “Evil prevails when good men do nothing.” I believe we all have a personal responsibility to stand against evil in our time, and that King’s Light Christian Academy is a critical resource for Christian families today seeking to pursue God‘s will for themselves, their children, and their community."
