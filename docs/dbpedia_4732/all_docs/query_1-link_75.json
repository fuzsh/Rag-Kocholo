        "text": "Leadership\n\nHead administrators who have served the college over the years have included: Ernie W. Robinson, 1941-56; Tom Johnstone, 1956-58; Vernon R. Morrison, 1959-68; Dr. L. Thomas Holdcroft, 1968-87; and Dr. James G. Richards, 1987-2006. The current President is Dr. Dave L. Demchuk who began his administrative leadership in December 2006.\n\nThe classroom ministry and administrative leadership as Dean and Principal of Rev. W.J. Friesen extended over many years, and he served under three presidents. Rev. and Mrs. A.J. Schindel ministered as classroom instructors and in some administrative capacities over an eighteen-year period from 1944 to 1962. Dr. Roger Stronstad taught courses from 1974 until 2016 and was the Dean of Education from 1986-2005. Dr. Wilf Hildebrandt has served as Dean of Education since 2005. Laurie Van Kleek served as an instructor and librarian from 1972-2021. Kimberly Brown took over the role of Librarian in 2021.\n\nFrom the early years of the developing college, the British Columbia District Executive of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada was designated as the \"Bible School Committee\", and it thereby served as the Board of Governors. The District Superintendent was considered Chairman of the Board. In 1955, this arrangement was given formal sanction by approval of the District Conference. Thereafter, the District Executive, when meeting on matters concerning the college, was designated the Board of Governors. A group from within the Board, known as the Administrative Committee, was formed to handle matters involving routine business.\n\nAcademics\n\nIn the District Conference of 1966, full endorsement was given for an expansion of the academic curriculum, and that fall the first stages of the additions were implemented. In March 1967, the British Columbia Provincial legislature granted the college a charter officially recognizing it as \"a Theological College\" and conferring upon it \"the power to provide instruction and grant degrees in Theology, Religious Education and Sacred Music only.\" The charter became law when it was proclaimed in 1981.\n\nAfter the move to Abbotsford was completed, it was decided to seek accreditation with the goal of granting undergraduate degrees. The college curriculum was reviewed, further developed, and refined, and the academic preparation of its faculty systematically upgraded. The library was upgraded, and the college board and academic senate were reorganized to conform to American Association of Bible College guidelines (AABC). After receiving candidate status (1976) and associate status (1978) Western was awarded full accreditation in 1980.\n\nOnce Western’s accreditation was in place the College Board petitioned the National Bible College Committee of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada for permission to grant degrees. At the Graduation ceremony in April 1982, Western awarded bachelor’s degrees to qualifying graduates for the first time in its history.\n\nAccreditation was reaffirmed by the AABC in 1985, 1990, and 2000. In 2004 the association was renamed the ABHE (Association for Biblical Higher Education). SPC’s accreditation was reaffirmed in 2011 for ten years by the COA of the ABHE.\n\nIn 2017 the college engaged in self-study process which culminated in the submission of documentation required for the reaffirmation of accreditation. The extensive report submissions, interviews and evaluation conducted by a Team of Evaluators in 2020 was concluded in March 2021. This was a very positive process for the college and the Association for Biblical Higher Education through the Commission on Accreditation re-affirmed SPC’s accreditation for another ten years (to 2031). The college anticipates continued growth and development during the next decade of ministry.\n\nGraduate Studies\n\nSince 2015 SPC has offered graduate level studies that previously were taught through the Canadian Pentecostal Seminary at the Association of Theological Schools in Langley, B.C. [TWU campus]. Summit’s School of Graduate Studies (SGS) continues the mandate of CPS and offers courses of interest to Pentecostals while providing a track for PAOC credential seekers.\n\nSince 2015 the SGS has delivered several certificates that require completion of five courses. Subject matter for each graduate certificate includes Studies in Pentecostal Theology, Church and Para-Church Leadership, New Testament Studies, and Youth Ministry.\n\nBeginning in the Fall semester 2022, Summit will offer two MA degrees which include the MA In Youth Ministry, and MA in Theology and Spiritual Leadership. Graduate students who have completed courses or a one-year certificate will receive credit towards their MA degree.\n\nAlternatively, students may also transfer their Summit School of Graduate Studies courses to the following institutions if they so desire: Southeastern University, TWU/ACTS Seminaries, Regent College. Academic credits from five core courses are pre-approved to be transferrable to certain study programs in the above-mentioned institutions.\n\nName Change\n\nIn March 2003 Western Pentecostal Bible College was renamed Summit Pacific College by an act of the British Columbia Provincial Legislature. The prospects for Summit Pacific College continue to be both encouraging and challenging. Sacrificial efforts by a host of dedicated participants and friends have built a solid foundation. Spiritually, academically, and financially Summit is firmly established. Over 80 years of ministry the college has experienced much progress.\n\nAlumni\n\nAs of April 2024, a total of 2388 students have graduated from SPC with diplomas or degrees. Many others have earned certificates. The majority of these now hold posts of responsibility as ministers, missionaries, church musicians, Christian educators, youth leaders, and similar vocations within the staffs of churches, church related institutions, charities, community service organizations and marketplace ministries. Typically, more than one-half of the pastors of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada churches in British Columbia are alumni of the college. Many Summit graduates serve in provinces throughout Canada."
