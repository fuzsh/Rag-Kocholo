        "text": "This article is going to be a bit different. I’m going to start by quoting two US presidents, an atheist, a dictator, and a Christian researcher! And of course, I will be quoting God’s Word.\n\nPrior to his presidency, in his gubernatorial inaugural address in 1967, Ronald Reagan stated:\n\nFreedom is a fragile thing and it’s never more than one generation away from extinction.\n\nIn responding to mob violence in the country in 1838, President Abraham Lincoln stated:\n\nHow, then, shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the approach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest; with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a trial of a thousand years.\n\nAt what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction were our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.\n\nWhile delivering a speech in Australia, in August 2014, atheist Lawrence Krauss stated:\n\nChange is always one generation away . . . So if we can plant the seeds of doubt in our children, religion will go away in a generation, or at least largely go away—and that’s what I think we have an obligation to do.\n\nIn 1935, Nazi Germany’s dictator, Hitler, was reported as stating:\n\nHe alone, who owns the youth, gains the Future!\n\n(The quote was translated from German into English in 1946 during the Nuremburg trials.)\n\nIn the book of Judges, we read:\n\nAnd the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the LORD had done for Israel. (Judges 2:7)\n\nThen we are told Joshua and the generation with him who saw the great work of the Lord (e.g., the crossing of the Jordan River) died.\n\nAnd there arose another generation after them who did not know the LORD or the work that he had done for Israel. And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals. And they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them. (Judges 2:10–12)\n\nThey lost the spiritual legacy they had in one generation.\n\nIn January 2018, Christian researcher George Barna stated that Generation Z (born between 1999–2015) is the first truly “post-Christian” generation. In fact, statistics show Generation Z is twice as likely to be atheist as any previous generation.\n\nIt’s well known that a culture, a family, or an organization (e.g., church, Christian college, etc.) can change dramatically in one generation. Now many of you may have read my book Will They Stand: Parenting Kids to Face the Giants or heard me speak on the family. In that book and in my presentation, I emphasize that the family is the first and most fundamental of all human institutions. The family is the backbone of the culture, and the family is the educational unit God set up to pass on a spiritual legacy to the next generation and impact the world for him in each generation. It only takes one generation to lose the spiritual legacy, and the devil knows this. That’s why the family has come under incredible attack.\n\nThe devil knows that to destroy the family is to destroy the culture and stop a godly legacy from being passed to the next generation so it can impact people’s lives. As President Lincoln detailed, it’s the attacks from within that will destroy.\n\nIf you think about it, the evil issues permeating our culture right now are all ultimately an attack on the family to destroy the culture from within.\n\nIf you think about it, the evil issues permeating our culture right now are all ultimately an attack on the family to destroy the culture from within.\n\nThe devil has also attacked the family in the church. More attacks from within! There’s been a generational loss from the church, and now we are seeing church attendance figures for Millennials and Generation Z down to less than 9%. Much of the church has given up (compromised/ignored) the authority of God’s Word in Genesis, thus undermining the foundation of all doctrine and a biblical worldview. Much of the church is lukewarm, not raising up generations to boldly stand on God’s Word.\n\nSadly, we are now in a situation where generations of kids have been taught through the education system, media, internet, and movies that the Bible is a book of mythology, man is just an animal, and morality is relative.\n\nProverbs 29:18 states, “Where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint.” Now this literally means that where there is no revelation (e.g., prophetic vision, word from the Lord), there is no restraint.\n\nNotice that this verse finishes with “but blessed is he who keeps the law.” People will not be happy until they are obeying God’s law. We do live in a time where we see this happening. The younger generations are casting off restraint as purpose and meaning in life is whatever they can get out of it right now. And in their rebellion against God, they will do whatever they can to justify doing whatever they want to do (especially with sex).\n\nBut here’s the good news! There’s an increasing number of churches using our powerful VBS program, Sunday school curriculum, and other resources. These resources are unique because they include apologetics, biblical worldview training, science experiments, and doctrine and are evangelistic.\n\nWe’ve now produced a homeschool Bible curriculum based on the Answers Bible Curriculum for churches.\n\nOur Answers magazine for the whole family is a unique and powerful tool that has won awards year after year.\n\nOur eldest daughter, who was a nurse for five years but then worked as my executive assistant for a number of years (she wanted to be in the ministry of AiG), had a burden to start a Christian school (Twelve Stones Christian Academy) as a true biblical worldview discipleship school.\n\nThe school is really growing and in need of facilities to expand. As a part of this outreach, we have stepped out in faith to employ curriculum writers to produce a truly biblical worldview curriculum for all grades for Christian schools. This project is well underway but will take some time before it is available (and we need more writers).\n\nShockingly, statistics indicate less than 6% of all Christian schools teach a truly biblical worldview.\n\nShockingly, statistics indicate less than 6% of all Christian schools teach a truly biblical worldview. Eventually, we want to see Twelve Stones provide online classes (such as for homeschoolers) and be a model to, in a sense, “franchise” the school in the future.\n\nAt the same time, the Lord has brought some phenomenal specialist staff to AiG to enable us to offer all sorts of worldview training (including special lab programs) in a variety of subject areas throughout the year for different age groups at the Creation Museum and Ark Encounter.\n\nWe are also working on many other resources to help parents, churches, and schools in raising up godly generations, equipped to stand in this very secularized, anti-Christian culture.\n\nAnd of course, the exhibits at our two attractions have impacted millions of all ages—including millions of young people.\n\nNo other organization in the world is providing the apologetics worldview training available in many ways through the ministry of Answers in Genesis, the Creation Museum, the Ark Encounter, and Twelve Stones Christian Academy.\n\nThanks for stopping by and thanks for your support and prayer,\n\nKen\n\nThis item was written with the assistance of AiG’s research team."
