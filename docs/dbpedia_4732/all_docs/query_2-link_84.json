        "text": "We have a multi-step admissions process to produce the best partnership between prospective families and the school. All applicants Preschool through 12th grade require a pastoral reference from a local church to ensure there is the foundation of faith being supported at home. We then require teacher references for our Early Education program if the student has not been in school before or students who have been homeschooled, a Sunday school teacher or coach will suffice. Middle School students must have two teacher references, Math and English. High School students produce six references in total: three teacher, family pastor and student pastor, and then a character reference.\n\nOnce we have received the application and references, we also request a complete copy of a student’s scholastic record. Once the record is received the application is reviewed thoroughly by the admissions team\n\nAfter review, we determine if a student moves on to entrance testing. This allows SBS to assess the capabilities of students’ reading and math comprehension, oral processing and vocabulary skills, and penmanship/writing skills directly.\n\nFollowing testing, we complete the admissions process with a parent interview, and student interview for students applying for grades 8-12. Our principals meet with families one on one and provide deeper explanation about our philosophy and methodology while reviewing testing results. Enrollment offer is determined after parent interview.\n\nWe offer a multi-child discount for the third child at 35% off, and a family cap if a family has more than 3 students.\n\nA 50% pastoral discount on tuition is offered to families that minister at a local church with a presiding board.\n\nWe have two financial aid options for families. These are need-based scholarships to provide options for families with like-minded values and vision for their children’s education. The Children’s Tuition Fund (CTF) is one specific scholarship that families moving from out of state or that are transitioning from public school can look to qualify for.\n\nThe curriculum at StoneBridge is bibliocentric, meaning the foundation of all subjects we teach is found in the Bible. We incorporate biblical principles and scripture throughout the year in all facets of learning to show our students that God is present and instrumental in all we learn and do.\n\nStudents will have dedicated Bible instruction built into their curriculum from Preschool to 12th grade\n\nAll students have dedicated chapel time on Thursdays with worship and a message shared. We have separate chapels for Preschool-Kindergarten, 1st-5th, and 6th-12th"
