Profession-Based Learning complements college preparation by adding a dimension of career focus that supports students finding their passions and strengths and matching them to opportunities in the market.\n\nEvery part of K-12 education needs to redesign its approach and outcomes through the integration of real-world learning to prepare our customers – the students – for that future.\n\nRead our former students’ feedback now that they are out in the world. Where are they now? What skills matter to them? Would they recommend profession-based learning to current students?\n\nClick here to visit the CAPS Alumni page to view and download the full report.\n\nFounded as a single school district program in 2009, the CAPS model is now connected to 100 affiliate locations, spanning over 170 school districts, 23 states and four countries. The growth of the model is a testament to the innovative educators and creative students in these local communities.\n\nCAPS is a proud part of a broader movement to expand the number of students engaging in authentic, career-connected learning experiences. Each of our 100 affiliates have the ownership and authority to create and manage their programs to meet local conditions and the intrinsic interests of their students."
