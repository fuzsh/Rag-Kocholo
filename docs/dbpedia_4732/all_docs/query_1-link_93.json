You will see the chaotic joy in each lap of the Doughnut Run because at VES we show up for everyone.\n\nOur Community\n\nLearning How\n\nto think, not\n\nWhat to think\n\nThe teachers at VES will challenge you to come at issues from different directions and help you develop an inquisitive mind. At VES you will learn the value of listening, questioning, and forming your own opinions while respecting those of others. You will, therefore, graduate with superior communication and critical-thinking skills."
