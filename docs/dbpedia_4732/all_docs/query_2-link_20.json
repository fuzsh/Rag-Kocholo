        "text": "As image bearers of a creative God, we encourage all students to develop both an appreciation for the arts and technical skill. The music & art department offers a variety of courses and ensembles, from beginner level to advanced. The performing arts courses include a minimum of two opportunities for concerts or performances throughout the year. As opportunities arise, students may also participate in performances outside the school environment such as field trips and community events. Courses offered include:\n\nConcert Choir\n\nShow Choir\n\nConcert Band\n\nIntro to Drama\n\nMusic Theory\n\nDigital Photography\n\nAdvanced 2D\n\nFoundations of Art\n\nStudio Habits\n\nChapel is a key aspect of our student life at HCS as a community dedicated to living for the glory of God. High school students have their own weekly chapel time to facilitate thoughtful consideration of Christian topics. Chapel includes a devotional based on the theme verse of the year and a time of worship, led by the high school chapel leadership team.\n\nThe high school chapel leadership elective is a unique opportunity for students with musical ability to use their gifts to lead the student body in worship. Students who participate in chapel leadership rehearse daily and play at both the middle school and high school chapels.\n\nWe encourage all of our students to be actively involved in the community. In order to facilitate this, we host a variety of nonprofit drives and service days throughout the year. Middle and high school students participate in a Day of Service each spring, fanning out into the greater Harrisburg area to partner with local nonprofits and churches. National Honor Society members are also actively involved in the community and serve with various local organizations. High school students have further internship service opportunities during J-Term each January."
