        "text": "About Us\n\nWe provide children with all the skills needed for a fruitful life. Our students are spiritually strong, academically sound, and physically disciplined. The Master’s Christian Academy is molding “Champion Children” as “Kingdom Kids!”\n\nIn order for man to succeed in life, God provided him with two means, education and physical activity. Not separately, one for the soul and the other for the body, but for the two together.\n\nPlato\n\nOur journey began more than three decades ago when we established our inaugural martial arts academy. As an extension rooted in Biblical values, we later introduced The Master’s Christian Academy, a new and unique ministry model for Christian education. We integrated the principles of martial arts into our educational approach. With meticulous planning spanning several years and a timely response to the evolving challenges within the educational landscape, The Master’s was officially launched in the autumn of 2020. Proudly based in Cedar Park, Texas, our academy caters to all kids in the local community and its surrounding areas, with plans for expansion to additional locations.\n\nNumerous studies affirm the positive impact of martial arts on various aspects such as focus, acuity, self-esteem, confidence, and behavior. We have achieved undeniable success in transforming and shaping the lives of thousands of children by instilling the values of respect and discipline inherent in the martial arts culture. Recognizing the demand for a comprehensive academic environment with robust boundaries, our commitment to excellence remains unwavering as we navigate the multi-faceted landscape of Christian education.\n\nIn the autumn of 2020, amid the virtual landscape area of schools and the indefinite pause or alteration of extracurricular activities, we took a proactive step by establishing our own standards for a new type of Christian education. Recognizing a significant need to realign our children’s educational journey, we focused on enhancing physical activity, creating an academic culture that welcomed all children at every level of education, fostering behavioral accountability, honing critical thinking skills, and ensuring the teaching of accurate history.\n\nTrain up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.\n\nProverbs 22:6\n\nConfronted with a critical decision, we view it as a straightforward choice: either permit certain factions of society and government to redefine morality, or embark on an investment in a Christian legacy destined to endure for generations. This deliberate choice is a testament to our unwavering commitment to leave a lasting imprint on the educational journey of our children. Our dedication extends beyond the present, aiming to shape a future where Biblical values transcend the challenges inherent in the constantly evolving educational landscape.\n\nOur Educational Programs\n\nPre-K\n\n2-3 Days / Week\n\n4-5 Days / Week\n\nElementary School\n\nKinder – 5th Grade\n\nMiddle\n\nSchool\n\n6th – 8th Grade\n\nHigh\n\nSchool\n\n9th – 12th Grade\n\nOur Educational Priorities\n\n1. Salvation through Jesus\n\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)\n\n2. Christian Education\n\nDo not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. (Romans 12:2)\n\n3. Black Belt Excellence\n\nOr do you not know what your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body (1 Corinthians 6:19-20)\n\nCustom, Personalized Christian Curriculum\n\nThe Master’s Christian Academy offers a Pre-K through 12-grade private Christian education, which utilizes Christian Worldview infused with Martial Arts. We provide our students with confidence and work with the family to choose from one of our several distinctive graduation tracks – college prep, trades, general education, or business ownership.\n\nWe utilize the ACE (Accelerated Christian Education) curriculum for an individualized, self-directed, and self-paced Christian curriculum in a teacher-facilitated classroom. We also utilize a personalized teacher-led Christian curriculum for our students.\n\nWe are a proud member of ACSI, Association of Christian Schools International, the largest Christian accreditation organization in the world. Accreditation is a process involving stringent criteria and numerous site inspections. Once we satisfy the rigorous requirement and time needed to complete the process, accreditation will be conferred.\n\nSchool Scripture\n\nTherefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.\n\n(Ephesians 6:13-18)\n\nOur Core Values\n\nFAITH: Christian Warriors know that God’s plan for our lives, and circumstances, is always perfect. Therefore we will rejoice and pray for peace in all things.\n\nCOURAGE: Christian Warriors always stand up for God’s truth and Biblical principles, no matter the cost. We persevere, even in the face of a mighty “Goliath-sized” enemy.\n\nHONOR: Christian Warriors honor God, themselves, and others. Respect will always be at the center of our thoughts, prayers, words, and deeds.\n\nLOVE: Christian Warriors demonstrate sacrificial action which demands obedience to God’s will, intending the best for others.\n\nWISDOM: Christian Warriors are lifelong students, seeking constant and never-ending improvement in our faith walk, education, health, and safety.\n\nGENEROSITY: Christian Warriors provide for others out of the overflow of their time, talent, and treasure.\n\nDISCIPLESHIP: Christian Warriors disciple and influence others through Godly inspiration, motivation, and perspiration.\n\nStatement of Belief\n\nWe are Christians who unapologetically and courageously stand up for our faith.\n\nWe stand on Biblical values, morals, and principles.\n\nWe only kneel to God, but we proudly stand for our National anthem, the American flag, and the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nWe support and defend our Pastors, Churches, Military, Law Enforcement, and our First Responders.\n\nWe revere our Founding Fathers, the Constitution, and American Exceptionalism throughout history.\n\nWe will fight to the death for our God, our families, and our country, in that order.\n\nStatement of Faith\n\nThe Bible is the inspired, infallible, authoritative, inerrant Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21).\n\nThere is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit (Genesis 1:1; Matthew 28:19; John 10:30).\n\nThe deity of Christ (Matthew 3:17), His virgin birth (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23), His sinless life (Hebrews 4:15; 7:26), His miracles (John 2:11), His vicarious and atoning death (1 Corinthians 15:3; Ephesians 1:7), His bodily resurrection (John 11:25; 1 Corinthians 15:4), His ascension to the right hand of the Father (Mark 16:19), and His personal return in power and glory (Acts 1:11; Revelation 19:11).\n\nThe absolute necessity of regeneration by the Holy Spirit for salvation because of the exceeding sinfulness of human nature, and men are justified on the single ground of faith in the shed blood of Christ. Only by God’s grace and through faith alone we are saved (John 3:16-19; John 5:24; Romans 3:23, 5:8-9; Ephesians 2:8-10; Titus 3:5).\n\nThe resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved unto the resurrection of life, and they that are lost unto the resurrection of punishment (John 5:28-29).\n\nMan was created by a direct act of God in His image, not from previously-existing life (Genesis 1:1,22,27; 1 Corinthians 11:7; James 3:9).\n\nThe spiritual unity of believers in the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 12:12-13; Galatians 3:26-28).\n\nMarriage is between one man and one woman only (Matthew 19:4-6)\n\nThe present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life (Romans 8:13-14; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 1 Corinthians 6:19-20; Ephesians 4:30; 5:18).\n\nSchool Colors\n\nAt The Master’s Christian Academy, our school colors hold a special significance, representing our rich heritage and core values. The colors red, white, blue, silver, and black are beautifully incorporated into our school’s logos, capturing the essence of our community.\n\nThese colors – red, white, blue, silver, and black, intertwined within our school logos, reflect the essence of The Master’s Christian Academy. They remind us of our faith, commitment to righteousness, unity, and resilience. As we proudly display these colors, they serve as a visual representation of our mission to nurture young minds and hearts, guiding them toward a deeper understanding of God’s love and purpose in their lives.\n\nRed, a vibrant hue, symbolizes the passion and commitment we have for our faith. It represents the blood shed by Jesus Christ on the cross, reminding us of His ultimate sacrifice and the love He demonstrated for us. Red stands as a constant reminder to live our lives with purpose and devotion.\n\nWhite, the color of purity and innocence, reflects our desire to uphold moral values and strive for righteousness. It signifies the purity of heart we seek as we navigate through our educational journey, fostering an environment of integrity and truth.\n\nBlue, a color often associated with loyalty, represents our unwavering commitment to Christ and our dedication to one another as a community. It signifies our unity as we stand strong, supporting and encouraging one another in our Christian walk.\n\nBlack, the color of strength and resilience, embodies our determination to face challenges head-on and emerge stronger. It represents the power of faith to overcome obstacles and the unwavering hope we have in Christ. Black serves as a reminder that even in the midst of darkness, we can find the light of Christ shining brightly.\n\nSilver, God’s refining of the hearts of people is likened to the refining of silver (Psalm 66:10, Isaiah 48:10). The words of truth that come from the Eternal are said to be like this metal refined seven times (Psalm 12:6).\n\nAssociations\n\nSCL\n\nSociety For Classical Learning\n\nPrestigious Network: Aligned with top classical education institutions.\n\nRich Curriculum: Access to cutting-edge classical pedagogy.\n\nFuture Leaders: Equipping students with timeless virtues and modern skills.\n\nBCWI\n\nBest Christian Workplaces Institute\n\nCertified Excellence: Recognized for our outstanding Christian values and culture.\n\nEmpowering Workplace: Dedicated to personal and professional growth.\n\nValues-Driven: Committed to integrity, stewardship, and excellence.\n\nACSI\n\nAssociation Of Christian Schools International\n\nAccredited Excellence: Upholding the highest educational and spiritual standards.\n\nGlobal Community: Part of a worldwide network enhancing Christian education.\n\nHolistic Development: Focused on spiritual, intellectual, and personal growth."
