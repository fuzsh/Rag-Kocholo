That’s why Online Christian Colleges went on the hunt for the very best Christian schools in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. While some are larger universities, others are smaller colleges. While some are officially non-denominational, others are affiliated with a particular denomination. And yet, every school on our list can be considered one of the best Christian colleges and universities in the South.\n\nRanking Methodology\n\nTo come up with our ranking of the best Christian colleges and universities in the South, we began by making a list of more than 100 schools located in the aforementioned Southern states. To narrow down our list to the top 25, we used the following points system.\n\nAnnual Tuition (Estimate):\n\nUnder $70,000 — 1 point\n\nUnder $60,000 — 2 points\n\nUnder $50,000 — 3 points\n\nUnder $40,000 — 4 points\n\nUnder $30,000 — 5 points\n\nUnder $20,000 — 6 points\n\nUnder $10,000 — 7 points\n\nAnnual Percentage of 20-Year Net Return on Investment (ROI):\n\n0-2% — 1 point\n\n3-4% — 2 points\n\n5-6% — 3 points\n\n7-8% — 4 points\n\n9% and Above — 5 points\n\nStudent to Faculty Ratio:\n\n31: 1 or higher — 1 point\n\n30:1 – 25:1 — 2 points\n\n24:1 – 20:1 — 3 points\n\n19:1 — 15:1 — 4 points\n\n14:1 – 11:1 — 5 points\n\n10:1 or lower — 6 points\n\nFinally, we used a holistic approach to break ties in points and determine a final ranking.
