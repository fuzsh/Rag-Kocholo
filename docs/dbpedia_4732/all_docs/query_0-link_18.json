        "text": "In light of today's rapidly changing and declining societal downturn away from academic excellence - found on absolute Biblical truth, the Imago Dei Group imperatively urges that no Christian school ever compromise to wokeness. The Imago Dei Group exists to intertwine academic excellence with spiritual excellence. They are mutually dependent on each other! If one suffers, the other suffers. Thus, neither academic excellence or Christ's favor can truly exist on such a compromised school. Colossians 2:8 teaches us to: \"See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on Christ.\" The Imago Dei Group firmly believes that Christian schools that obey God's timeless ways and truths are those that will indeed be blessed and have qualitative as well as quantitative excellence for His glory! We welcome your inquiries to learn how we help Christian schools to grow comprehensively to thrive in excellence, whether they are established, new or just in the initial start up phases.\n\nExcerpts from “Education is Discipleship: So Who’s Really Discipling your Kids?” (2016) by Dr. Christy Anderson. “Not only are the offices and roles of the parents and the church being confused and usurped…a false distinction between the two (as if ‘education’ is neutral or unbiblical and discipleship is something one only does in a ‘religious’ setting). This causes most people who write about discipleship in the church to miss the greater issues and problem at hand in terms of education of each new generation” (p. 47). “Most people, including pastors, are in serious denial about the present situation” (p. 51). “The Reformation period was a major turning point in Christian history, and what is needed today is no less dramatic a revival and restoration” (p. 52). “Discipleship has a cost that most people are not willing to pay” (p. 53). “All talk of ‘discipleship’ occurring outside of the intimate, one-on-one type of context should be eliminated from Christian vocabulary” (p. 54). “The church service as it generally functions today engages people in weekly evangelism (throwing the seed wide and far) but not discipleship” (p. 54). “Most Christians in a majority of churches are not mature enough to begin discipling others” (p. 55). “For young people…biblical discipleship must be recognized as directly connected with a child’s overall education” (pp. 55-56).\n\nExcerpts from “Truth is fallen in the street: Examining the pedagogy of Christian teachers in public schools.” (2018) by Jay Jusino “Christian teachers within the public school system are unwittingly serving to spearhead the sacred/secular dichotomy within the youth of our culture” (p. 85). “Bringing someone into fellowship with Christ has, as a fundamental starting point these essentials: the Word of God and the name of Jesus Christ… It is important to note that especially these two components are eliminated in government schools” (p. 97). “They [teachers] give up the name of Christ, refusing to connect Him to the creation that they ardently teach about, in order to be ‘salt and light’ to their students. This is contradictory” (p. 100). “If students are aware of the Christian faith of their teachers, they learn that this faith is a faith that is to be kept quiet in the public sector” (p. 103). “Knowledge received without reference to God is not particularly valuable knowledge in the end” (p. 106). “If Christian teachers were to speak up, they would be fired en mass, the public school system would fail, finally, and the free market, through competition and freedom, would supply a much better product for the American people in the vacuum that would result” (p. 128).\n\nTo see true and lasting influence on the culture and world, there must be a significant investment in the development and growth of Christian schools, especially classical Christian schools. Historically, the propagation of schools has followed every work of spiritual renewal. For example, during the Reformation, hundreds of schools were started. James Kittleson said, “the Reformation itself may be rightly understood as a massive educational undertaking.” Philip Melanchthon was invited to assist in establishing more than 50 schools in the 1520’s alone. This work continued for centuries. In the 19th century, Lutheran's started a university in the U.S., on average, every three years. There are countless examples, but the development of schools was a primary and urgent plea coming from every reformer. Both Luther and Melanchthon called on pastors, families, patrons, and city officials to take seriously the education of ALL children. Why? Luther said it plainly, \"God has preserved the church through schools.\" If we want our children to be anchored in biblical truth and develop into godly leaders, we have to the see the work of Christian education as the work of the church, not a calling reserved for a small industry of \"experts\" called Christian educators. Both Melanchthon and Luther advocated for a Christian education in the liberal arts. Luther said, \"Your parents cannot prepare a more dependable treasure for your children than an education in the liberal arts.\" Melanchthon, the Teacher of Germany, was very clear: - \"True education must combine the wisdom of the ancients with the eternal truths of the Christian faith.\" - \"Let the foundation of every institution be laid with a sincere fear of God, so that both the learning and the virtue necessary for life and eternity may be imparted.\" - \"The liberal arts enrich the mind, strengthen moral character, and equip individuals for wise and virtuous leadership.\" - \"Through the study of languages, literature, history, and philosophy, students learn to think critically, act ethically, and appreciate the rich heritage of human thought.\" - \"The classics are a valuable tool for understanding the human condition and for learning how to express oneself with clarity and grace.\" - \"By studying the works of great thinkers like Plato and Aristotle alongside the Scriptures, students gain a fuller understanding of God's creation and human nature.\" It is time for churches to start schools, cast a clear vision for Christian formation, and take a leadership role in advancing classical Christian education. They need to utilize their infrastructure and resources (buildings, classrooms, etc.) to support the work of Christian education. Pastors need to encourage those who are able to direct their financial resources to this most worthy and urgent cause! I have seen some inspiring examples of this, but we need so many more.\n\nIn their book, “Christian Higher Education: An Empirical Guide,” Perry Glanzer, Theodore Cockle, and Jessica Martin examine the specific ways in which Christian colleges and universities “operationalize their Christian identity.” It is also a study of how the failure to do so has contributed to the progressive secularization of many institutions over time. Glanzer and his colleagues note the remarkable diversity of Christian institutions of higher education in the United States (and Canada), which represent “sixty-one different Christian traditions and denominations.” Using their definition and methodology, they identify 546 colleges and universities as Christian in some sense. At the heart of their book is what they call the Operationalizing Christian Identity Guide (OCIG), an eleven-criteria tool to measure and compare “how various Christian universities put their Christian identity into effect through concrete (i.e., observable) actions or policies.” The OCIG scores institutions based on: examinations of their mission statements; the home pages of their websites; their “About Us” pages; Christian identity requirements for students, faculty, staff, presidents, and board members; the presence of a vice president for mission or chaplain on the executive team; whether they have a specifically Christian academic department (rather than just Religious Studies); the number of required Christian/biblical/theology courses; explicitly Christian centers or institutes; required chapel/mass; if they have only Christian student groups; and code of conduct reasoning. The highest number of points an institution can score is 27. The remaining chapters of the study analyze various types of schools and how they score on the OCIG. For the rest of my reflection on the book, see my next post."
