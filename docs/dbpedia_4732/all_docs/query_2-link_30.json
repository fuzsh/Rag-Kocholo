        "text": "By Doug Harrell\n\nMitchell County\n\nHow do we as a people respond when we have a local business open up in the area and their leading purpose is to encourage our children to accept and adopt lifestyles that are opposed to Christian values that are not in keeping with solid mental health issues, that are opposed to all biological facts we are born with, and that are not in the best interest of our children? This my dear readers is something we are facing right here in the mountains of Western North Carolina, in the very heart of the Bible belt. In an area that you will see a church around almost every turn in the road!\n\nIt was brought to my attention within the past couple of months that this was amongst us in Mitchell County of all places. A liberal, supposed pastor, and I say pastor with tongue in cheek as the old saying goes because virtually every post on social media by this supposed pastor is mocking the very word of God on every hand. The name of this business is Willis Observatory located in the Ledger community between Bakersville and Spruce Pine North Carolina. This supposed pastor is Chris Ayers and I would recommend that you go to his social media page on Facebook and read some of his postings if you want to get a better idea of where he stands and the purpose of this so-called observatory. I am going to share a portion of his post on January 4, 2021, and you can see the very focus of what is going on.\n\n“Gotta Wear Your Crown! (The Prom, Movie/Musical) One of the most important things we will do at Willis Observatory is to encourage students (really everybody) to CELEBRATE THEMSELVES (in addition to encouraging them to love science). With that in mind, we have crowns (2 more ordered) to pass out to volunteers who want to dance to Wear Your Crown, a great song in The Prom. To have the greatest show in the universe, you gotta have great props, great music, and a great message. SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT WILLIS OBSERVATORY.”\n\nAs is stated here, the primary focus of Willis Observatory is to get into our school systems and promote bringing our children here in the pretense of science and encourage them to wear a crown of coming out as gay, lesbian, transgender, or whatever. We as a people need to be totally aware of what is taking place and the purpose of the observatory is to encourage this type of lifestyle. I, nor anyone else can tell you what to expose your children to, but I can assure you that if you value the child and their wellbeing you will not want them exposed to this encouragement of leading a lifestyle that is truly filled with all kinds of anguish and pain, much less is in total opposition to the very teachings of Christ. It is also in opposition to most other religions that I am aware of. I say this with the full disclosure that I am a Christian and do my best to follow the teaching of Christ and am thankful for His grace when I fall short, which I often do.\n\nI would ask that you familiarize yourself with what is going on and act accordingly, make sure your school boards and others in a position of authority are aware as well. We the people must stand up and say this is not welcome here. There comes a time that we must take a stand for what is right and oppose wickedness to its face. In all my writings over the years this is my first time really coming out in direct opposition to a local business directly and publicly, but I felt it was necessary to take a firm stand. It is also the first time that I have ever seen any business so openly taking this kind of stand. It is sad to say, but today this tends to be happening in many large corporations and it breaks my heart. I see people that are all the time talking about women’s rights, yet want to allow male participation in female sports, how crazy is that! Folks we need to wake up and come to our senses and stop burrowing our heads in the sand! Stand up and let your voices be heard.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDoug Harrell is a life-long resident of Mitchell County, Owner of Harrell Hill Farms, a member of Bear Creek Baptist Church, and former publisher of Blue Ridge Christian News.
