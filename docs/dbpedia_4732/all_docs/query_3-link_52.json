        "text": "The English education program at Bob Jones University has molded me into the student I am today. Its consideration of each student individually caught my attention immediately. Coming into a large school like BJU, I was concerned I might get lost academically, but from the start, my advisor knew my name and immediately started to build a relationship with me. There are numerous times I have gone to her about academic and personal questions because I know she cares about me as a sister in Christ.\n\nBesides preparing me to be a teacher, the program has equipped me to participate in extracurricular opportunities outside of the English realm. I was given the opportunity to travel on the Universityâ€™s Drama Ministry Team during one of my semesters of college in which I used skills from classes I had already taken within my major. This experience was life changing, and I would have never been able to participate without the encouragement and challenge of the English education department. In addition to encouraging me to travel, my advisor worked with me to ensure my education would not be hindered while I was away for a semester.\n\nI have also been involved in university choirs for three years now. Being able to extend myself outside of my major has been a huge outlet for me, but the English education department is never far away. The faculty can consistently be seen attending concerts and special programs in which English majors are a part. Seeing that support is priceless to me and really shows unity within all the departments on campus. I am excited to go into the world and begin teaching what I have learned and to use the loving spirit all of my teachers have instilled in me."
