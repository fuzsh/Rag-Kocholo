We have events year round that keep us grounded in who Ben Lippen is.\n\nOur Events\n\nWe offer signature programs curated specifically to provide more opportunities to hone in on areas that students might want to specialize in after Ben Lippen.\n\nSignature programs\n\nAs our students move from pre-school to grade 12, we have an end goal in mind: to fully prepare your student for college and beyond, ready to impact and influence the world according to his or her unique gifts. We do this through fully-engaged learning each step of the way.\n\nLearn More\n\nWe live out our Better Together philosophy by creating music, art, and theater for three reasons: For God– We reflect the Creator by creating high-quality work, For Others– We give away our work as a gift to our community, and For Fun– We prioritize relationships with our creative collaborators.\n\nLearn More\n\nStudent-athletes are encouraged to WIN on the scoreboard, WIN in life, and WIN for eternity. While we are building our athletic programs, we are also committed to honoring the Lord in a positive Christian atmosphere where our students work with qualified coaches who have an enthusiastic passion for striving to be the best!\n\nLearn More\n\nThe school provides an incredible platform to come alongside parents and the church in the discipleship process. We are humbled and grateful to partner with you in the greatest journey this life has to offer-following Jesus and helping others to do the same.\n\nLearn More"
