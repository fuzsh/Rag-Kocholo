        "text": "The uniform at Strong Rock Christian School is a symbol of excellence. The uniform is a symbol of unity. All students of Strong Rock Christian School wear the uniform, thus, emphasizing a community spirit. Attention to one’s personal appearance is a matter of self-discipline and is expected of all students. Uniforms reduce distractions, allowing students to focus on academics.\n\nFor the safety and security of the students, faculty, and staff, students must be in school uniform while on campus during school hours, and he/she must wear the school uniform properly and in its entirety. The Strong Rock Christian School administrators are the final judges of uniform, jewelry, and/or hair appropriateness or correctness. The decisions they make are final.\n\nBelts are required for students in 2nd through 12th grades. Boys’ shirttails must be tucked in, unless the shirt is the approved style to be worn out. Hats or other headwear may not be worn before or during the school day. Only solid white T-shirts should be worn under the uniform shirt. Undershirts must not be visible beneath the uniform shirt. All clothing should fit in a traditional manner, and appropriate undergarments must be worn. Neither excessively tight nor loose fitting attire will be accepted.\n\nAll uniform wear, especially jackets and coats, should be labeled with the student’s name as soon as the item is purchased. Additionally, all books, notebooks, and bags should be labeled.\n\nNew changes will be taking place with our dress code for the 2024-2025 school year. Our goal in making these changes is to simplify our dress code and bring unity back to Strong Rock uniforms. Changes will impact families minimally during the 2024-2025 school year, because all current uniforms will be grandfathered in for the 2024-2025 school year with only a few exceptions.\n\nThe following will be implemented for the 2024-2025 school year:\n\nWhite shirts will not be an option. In lieu of white shirts, students in PreK3 through 8th grades will be expected to wear blue polo shirts for chapel. High school students will need to purchase the new uniform shirts for chapel. Uniform fittings and ordering for the 2024-2025 school year will begin in May, 2024.\n\nAcademy students will no longer wear vests on chapel days.\n\nHigh school girls will no longer wear blazers, and academy/high school boys will no longer wear ties.\n\nThere will only be 4 approved outerwear items allowable during the week, which must be purchased from the school store. Please check the charts to see which outerwear items are permitted on each day.\n\nNavy ¼ zip with Mountain Logo\n\nNavy crew neck sweatshirts with Mountain Logo\n\nNavy full-zip jacket with Mountain Logo\n\nHigh School Strong Rock Letterman Jackets\n\nAll other outerwear items and player pack items may only be worn on Fridays with the purchase of a jeans pass.\n\nStudents in PE must adhere to the expectations listed in the course syllabus. Athletic shorts must be loose-fitting with at least a 5-inch inseam and may not be rolled.\n\nMoving forward, our school store (iROCK Café) will be the one stop shop for your uniform needs. Uniform fittings will be available to help make sure students are fitted correctly. If uniform items require alterations, there will not have a seamstress on campus, but there will be a list of seamstresses to contact, should the need arise.\n\nThe below links to the Picture Guides and charts provide an overview of the new plans for uniforms. Red Polos and jeans will continue to be the standard field trip attire. Parents will be updated with changes during this transition."
