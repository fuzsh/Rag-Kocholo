        "text": "5\n\nTeaching at Cornerstone does not feel like a job. It is a ministry, and I love it! Cornerstone is unique in the fact that a child`s heart and their relationship with God are of highest priority. Students are prayed over, shepherded, and guided more than just told to straighten up and follow the rules. I love the grace of God in the process. Because our focus is on each student`s relationship with God more than their grades it affects the atmosphere of the whole school. My favorite part of teaching at Cornerstone is the family atmosphere. Teachers, staff, parents, and students care about one another. This fosters a relaxed atmosphere of care rather than stress and competition. And learning takes place as well! The school is certified by ACSI. I have wanted to be a teacher since I was in grade school, and have always enjoyed working with young children. Watching the \"lightbulb\" moments and seeing their progress in all areas brings me great joy. The most important lesson that I want my students to take with them from their time with me is that everyone makes mistakes and that`s OK. We learn through making mistakes whether that`s in learning to write cursive or read or in our relationships with one another. We need to admit our mistakes, ask for forgiveness, give forgiveness, and move on. I make a point to point out my own mistakes as well!\n\n- Posted by Teacher - lorib\n\n5\n\nBoth of my children attended Cornerstone Christian School from Kindergarten thru 8th grade. When my oldest child graduated from CCS and transitioned into public high school, I became even more aware of how thankful I was to have had him at CCS! CCS prepared him to be able to think critically and Biblically when faced with the public school culture and not just accept everything that came his way. My youngest son just graduated from CCS, and he has also been well prepared for high school. CCS builds a strong foundation in its students, both Biblically and academically. It is a worthwhile investment in the lives of your children! I would highly recommend it!\n\n- Posted by Parent - jlsla"
