        "text": "Key Dates\n\nFall 2024 Empower Life Grant application window opens August 5\n\nWhere do I apply?\n\nWhether you've applied in the past or are applying now for the first time, the application is only available once you've completed the tutorial. Once you have completed the training, you will be able to click through to the full grant application for the current application window. The training is short, simple, and designed to help you show your organization in the best light possible for this grant (and hopefully others!). If you've applied before, pay close attention to recent clarifications as we continue to improve our process. Just remember to use the passcode from your email invitation!\n\nHow much time will I need to dedicate to this grant application?\n\nIn many ways, this depends on how easily you are able to pull stats for your center. It can take more or less time depending on whether you’ve done similar applications in the past or how you keep your budget and client information. Assuming your statistics are not too difficult to gather, we expect the entire process from the time you start the training to the time you submit an application to take about 90 minutes.\n\nTell me more about the training/tutorial.\n\nWe know that many pregnancy help centers have not had the opportunity to spend the time and energy to apply for a grant. Or perhaps you did once, but didn’t get the grant and haven’t tried again. That’s why we’ve made it as simple as we possibly can to represent your organization well for the Empower Life Grant in particular, and other donors or grantors in the future. The training is a brief walkthrough of how to put your best foot forward when applying for grants that specifically address categorizing expenses appropriately and arming yourself with powerful metrics. With these tools, you’re that much closer to winning any grant proposal - and it makes the Empower Life Grant application easy.\n\nWhere do I find my passcode?\n\nCheck your invitation email for your unique application passcode. You should be able to find your invitation by searching \"Empower Life Grant\" and looking for an email from our Vice President, Tracie Shellhouse. The passcode allows you to access your organization's personal application, which means you can start today, save your progress, and finish tomorrow if you need to.\n\nWhy doesn't my passcode work?\n\nFirst, confirm that the passcode you've entered matches the code provided in your invitation email. If you still receive a message that your passcode is invalid, confirm that the current application window is open for organizations in your state (see map below). If you still believe there is an error and your passcode is not allowing you to progress, contact This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. for assistance completing this application.\n\nI'm confused about program expenses. What are program expenses and what is overhead?\n\nHere's the short answer: program expenses are costs related to direct service of your clients, while overhead is not. There are easy expenses (like your curriculum, pregnancy tests, or ultrasound machine) that you know should go under program expenses, but don’t forget to include the salary of staff members providing client services or the cost of space where you provide services. For example, if your executive director works 25% of the time with clients and 75% of the time fundraising, put 25% of her salary under program expenses. You can also do this with your building. If 60% of your space is used directly in client services, you should allocate 60% of your rent or mortgage payment to program expenses. Insurance and membership dues are not program expenses since they do not directly serve clients. Have you read Jor-El's explanation of overhead and the reason major donors ask this question? Click here to read more!\n\nI'm getting an error in the At-Risk Client Intentions section. What am I doing wrong?\n\nThe client intentions you are reporting on should only be those that were at-risk, so the total number of life, abortion, and unknown/undecided intentions should total the number of at-risk clients in the above section. If these numbers do not match, you will get an error! (NOTE: The number will not match your reported number of pregnancy tests.)\n\nHow much am I likely to receive if I do get a grant?\n\nIf an organization receives the Empower Life Grant, the minimum amount they will receive is $2,500 in operational funds. Some organizations receive $5,000, $10,000 or even more at the donor’s discretion.\n\nby Beth Diemert, Director of Affiliate Services\n\nHeartbeat International\n\nAs Holy Week is here and Easter is fast approaching, it is a routine occurrence for me to anticipate an Easter celebration that is full of some of my favorite music. One of the songs that is always top of mind is Sandy Patty’s, Was It a Morning Like This? I know I am dating myself a bit, but it is a classic in my mind, as it depicts the scenes of resurrection morning and those who had a part in it. I love imagining those being played out and the raw emotion in it all.\n\n“Was it a morning like this when Mary walked down from Jerusalem? And two angels stood at the tomb. Bearers of news she would hear soon.”\n\nThose scenarios, of course, take a look back, to that glorious morning that changed everything. But this Easter season, my mind is drawn forward to the idea that all of those thousands of years ago, our heavenly Father knew what a “morning like this” would look like in 2023.\n\n“Did the grass sing? Did the earth rejoice to feel You again?\n\nAs those who work in pregnancy help, our mornings are currently laced with the reality of a post-Roe America. Chemical abortion, angry legislators, big Abortion, determined politicians, big Pharma, censorship, false rhetoric, big Tech, vandalism, and money that follows an agenda. A lot of money.\n\nAnd in the mix of all that, we as believers, called to a holy mission, consecrate ourselves, and work to be the gospel to those who are in need, in a valley of decision, desperate for truth, real help, and much love.\n\nSo…let’s start here. That gospel, originated in the Easter story, is as relevant on a morning in 2023 as it was that first morning in Jerusalem. To deliver the hope of the world, to the ones who think they have no hope. No choice. No future.\n\nOver and over like a trumpet underground did the earth seem to pound \"He is risen!\"\n\nJesus knew false accusations. Jesus knew persecution. Jesus knew violation and suffering. And yet, Jesus chose to lay down his life in the greatest sacrifice of all time to bring us everlasting life. Those of us in the life movement should be beholden this Easter season, to revisit the Easter story with intentionality, and glean its power and example, to empower us, in continuing to share, and be, the gospel, in everything we say and do.\n\nLuke 23 teaches us much to this end, but three things I want to specifically draw our attention toward:\n\nVerses 28-30 – “But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. For indeed the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, wombs that never bore, and breasts that never nursed!'”\n\nJesus was referring to what he knew was to come in the destruction they would see in Jerusalem, which would surely affect them and their next generation of children. But how interesting that Jesus would emphasize that weeping should not be for him, but for themselves, particularly using the issue of motherhood at this unprecedented time, speaking to what should be the greatest joy of motherhood becoming a great misery.\n\nFast forward to 2023, and where are we with this direction from Christ? Could we ever have imagined the calamity that would come upon motherhood and do we realize this is the issue that Christ called out on his way to the cross, telling the women not to weep not for him, but for themselves, his heart breaking in anticipation of future horrific tragedy?\n\nVerse 34 -The next words Jesus uttered were to ask the Father to forgive those who were mocking him, blaspheming him. “Father forgive them for they do not know what they do.” Jesus did not fight back, retaliate. His heart was for the forgiveness of those who were committing horrendous acts against Him. Their need, their deception. On a morning in 2023, do we do the same?\n\nVerse 43 -The last thing Christ said before he committed his spirit to the Father, was a promise of assurance that the thief hanging next to him, the one who realized truth and knew what Jesus was bringing, asked to be remembered in the kingdom, and Jesus replied, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.” No further requirements, no questions, no judgment. In 2023, do we freely extend the gospel in the same way?”\n\n“Over and over in a never-ending round \"He is risen!\"\n\nDaily in the morning, the Heartbeat team meets to pray as pregnancy help organizations are opening in times zones that span the world. We often pray that you all will experience mornings full of connection, empowerment, truth to be shared, and love to be lavished. We pray that your clients & residents will have a life-changing day.\n\nThis Easter week as we devote ourselves to prayer, we rejoice! For every morning (in 2023 and beyond) we have more than we need. “The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is on us, because the Lord has anointed us to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent us to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners…(Isaiah 61:1) The Spirit of the Living God lives with us.\n\nOn a morning like this…like a trumpet underground did the earth seem to pound \"He is risen!\" He is risen! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!\n\nFrom all of us at Heartbeat, Blessed Easter! He has risen, he has risen indeed!\n\nby Ellen Foell, International Program Specialist\n\nHeartbeat International\n\nIf there is one word to describe the world today it might be divided. Actually, we might even be divided about that! Some people might use the words fractured, broken, or disintegrating. The reality is, we see evidence of division all around us, politically, racially, nationally, even within individuals.\n\nNone of that sounds like good news.\n\nBut in the midst of the bad news, and the division, we see good news.\n\nThe night before Jesus was betrayed, he had a meal and a very long conversation with the disciples. The meal was familiar and traditional, a Passover meal. A meal that each of the disciples had eaten many times in their lives, filled with history, song, and prayer.\n\nBut the conversation was not so familiar. Jesus did things that disrupted the evening with hard sayings about leaving, about vines and branches, betrayal. He even said one of the friends sitting at the Passover meal would betray him. He washed everyone’s feet which shocked them and then said they would learn to wash one another’s feet as well.\n\nIn the middle of that last conversation and meal Jesus shared with his disciples, he stopped to enter into a conversation with the Father. He did not preface the interruption with “everyone please bow your heads.” No dramatic pause for effect. He simply started praying to the Father as if the Father was a participant in the rest of the conversation, had been there all along. And, of course, He was. But the prayer Jesus prayed was not the overthrow of the Roman oppressors, nor was it for the disciples’ prosperity, or for methods to spread the message.\n\nHis prayer was pointed and focused: the unity of the disciples, both the ones present in the room, and the ones who would one day also believe because of the message carried by the ones in the room. He asked the Father, in the presence of the disciples:\n\nMy prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one—I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me. (John 17:20-23)\n\nThis was the last major discourse with the disciples, and the last major prayer time between the Father and the Son to which they would be witnesses. Because, as we know, they slept through the next prayer time on the Mount of Olives. In this little passage, the disciples overheard Jesus talk to the Father about the who, what, how, and why of unity. We need to pay attention to the matters of unity because unity matters.\n\nThe Who\n\nWhen Jesus talked to the Father about unity for the disciples, he was inclusive. He prayed beyond the eleven disciples present in the room (Judas had already left). It was a prayer for those who would believe in Jesus through the testimony and witness of the ones in the room. And any single one of us reading this as well as the billions who follow Jesus around the world, are part of the “those who will believe in me through their message.” Jesus’ prayer to the Father reached down through generations and across the globe. He prayed across time and space.\n\nThe What\n\nJesus interceded to the Father that all of them, all of us may be one: “Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.” He wanted more than all of us being in the same room, more than gathering around the worldwide campfire and singing the same song. He prayed for oneness.\n\nOneness goes beyond togetherness, friendship, partnership, or collaboration. Oneness carries with it the same meaning as used in marriage-that the two become one. Total intimacy of two still distinct individuals. As the Father and the Son and Spirit are one, Jesus asked God to make us, as Jesus followers, one, in the same way that the Father and the Son are one. The concept is already beyond our human comprehension, so he gave us an example of oneness and intimacy in relationship: just as you are in me and I am in you.\n\nThe Father and Son are so united that Jesus told Philip, “if you have seen me, you have seen the Father.” Jesus wanted for us the unity the Son and the Father enjoy. That seems like an impossibility. How can we, as flawed human beings, from different races, ethnicities, geopolitical borders, with individual interests, needs, levels of income and desires enter into that kind of oneness?\n\nThe How\n\nHow on earth could Jesus pray for the impossible? As he said in another time to the disciples, with men and women, in the flesh, this is impossible, but all things are possible with God (MT 19:26). We cannot strive for unity as the world strives for it. Our unity is in the Father, Son and Spirit. Jesus asked the Father, “may they also be in us.” Our unity as Christians, and by extension, as the pregnancy help movement, must be found in, and founded in, the way of Jesus.\n\nThousands of years earlier, there was another great movement toward unity. It was a monumental effort of the entire world that was united by speech. In Genesis 11, people came together as one and determined to build a name for themselves by building a tower that reached to heaven. The effort failed because of pride and arrogance against God. But in that same passage we see that there is no limit to what could happen if people are united.\n\nThe problem was not that the people were united with one another. The problem was that the people were not united with God. Their unity was for the purpose of being like God (sounds like the Garden all over again).\n\nThe Why\n\nUnity is not the end goal. Unity with the triune God has a beauty, joy and wonder all its own. But unity also has a purpose. “Then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.” We work for unity so that the whole rest of the world will know that the Father sent the Son out of love. It is so that all those generations since the eleven in the room with Jesus would know the lifesaving truth that Christ came into the world for sinners, to restore relationship, and for unity with the Father, even as the Father and the Son are one.\n\nPsalm 131 says that where the brothers dwell together in unity, it is good and pleasant. Even more than that, God commands a blessing (Psalm 131:1-4). I have four children and honestly, when I see our children getting along, dwelling together in unity, I want to bless them because their unity blesses me. We want to bless our heavenly Father with our unity in the same way.\n\nThe pregnancy help movement is spread across the globe. Heartbeat International is currently serving affiliates in 90 nations. We do so in partnership and collaboration with nine different networks. Yet, approximately 30% of Heartbeat's international affiliates are not in networks. They labor sometimes as the only pregnancy help center in the nation. Some centers may be the only place for a woman in an unexpected pregnancy in a radius encompassing 2 or 3 or 4 million people.\n\nEach center looks different. The languages are different. Some centers are urban, some rural, some are Catholic, some evangelical, some Orthodox. Pregnancy help centers hold out the word of life in peace and in war, in famine and in feasting, in sickness, through the pandemic, and in health. We are united with one another, and with the triune God.\n\nUnity is hard. The culture of individualism and personal rights can stand against unity. Our “me” gets in the way of “we.” But if we can pray toward, work toward, and move toward unity, as the pregnancy help movement, the world will know, even as it sees us as a movement, that the Father sent the Son, that the Father loves them, even as He loves the Son. And then, the world might believe.\n\nSociety today places so much emphasis on scientific data as the only reliable source to any subject. Truth be told, when it comes to human sexuality, science speaks for itself. Dr. Joe Malone, Sexual Integrity Scientist, helps us understand why on Valentine’s (and every other) day!\n\nTRUE LOVE AND MARRIAGE\n\nSome in our 21st century Western culture are advocating many new relationship types. These include hookups, friends with benefits, throuples, cohabitation, polyamory, and more. They say that we need to be liberated from our sexually repressed lifestyles. The philosophy is that if it feels good, we should do it with as many different people as we choose. When it stops feeling good or gets old, we can switch to another or others. Being personally happy is the ultimate goal in life for each individual and the most important gifts are the ones we give to ourselves in the pursuit of pleasure, no matter how it affects the other people in our lives. Many of those we serve in the pregnancy help community have adopted this thinking. But we have a unique opportunity to share a vision of marriage, true love, and real sex with them. Consider this.\n\nA CHRISTIAN DISTINCTIVE\n\nAn outstanding hallmark of Christianity from the beginning has been monogamous marriage. Christians stood out within their communities because of it. Contrastingly to the above thinking and practice, think of Valentine’s Day and the giving and receiving of a gift with the one we love. We may not realize all the value of the gift, when the gift is sex in a loving monogamous relationship that we can share with the love of our life, our spouse. There are so many benefits to sex within monogamous marriage. Let’s take a look at some of them.\n\nBENEFITS ON MANY LEVELS\n\nSex within marriage leads to greater and greater levels of intimacy. You get to know each other better and better in a way that no one else on earth does. This helps develop a trust relationship that is sure and steady. In happy marriages this can have interesting physical benefits. Happily married couples blood pressures drop when they sleep together. Their heartbeats synchronize as well. Sex is a great releaser of stress!\n\nSex within marriage also doesn’t carry all of the negative baggage that sex previous to, or otherwise outside of marriage carries like guilty feelings, regret, worry about STIs or an unwanted pregnancy with someone who is not your spouse.\n\nThe physical contact involved in sex helps us to bond more strongly all of the time. There are endorphin receptors throughout the skin covering of the body and they react to intimate and loving touch, which generates endogenous (or internal) endorphins, a kind of super relaxant. Hugs contribute to this, and married couples are encouraged to hug each other at least eight times per day. Their hearts literally beat as one because of the assurance that they have that their spouse loves them absolutely and has their back at all times.\n\nLIFE LENGTHENING AND ENHANCING\n\nAnother great benefit of married sex is that it is antiaging! Cells in the body that are anti-inflammatory are released during sexual activity. This helps the body to be able to repair more effectively and seems to be a built-in way that the wellness and well-being of the married couple is enhanced.\n\nSex within marriage raises our immune system by causing the release of an antibody called immunoglobin A. This helps protect our bodies against invasive bacteria and viruses. A lifelong marriage is a very holistic stabilizing factor physiologically for a couple.\n\nSLEEP\n\nAn awesome married sex life helps us to sleep better because oxytocin is released substantially after sex. Cuddling afterwards and going to sleep is very natural and healthy. It helps us to have healthier looking skin as it promotes blood circulation, and it even helps women to have lighter periods. Sex within marriage raises our moods and gives us a more positive outlook on our spouse as we bond.\n\nGOD’S WAY IS ALWAYS THE BEST WAY\n\nIf we are reflective, we see that its benefits go far beyond immediate pleasure and even increased physical and mental health. When we look at the physical fruits of married sexual relationships - children - it is obvious that this is definitely one of God’s most important gifts to us. After all, his first words to humanity were to go forth and multiply.\n\nMarried sex is a wonderful example of men and women displaying consistency, intentionality, and most of all faithfulness. This is what God intended for humans and without a doubt, it is best for us.\n\nMarriage pays dividends multi-generationally to a family and then to all of the lives that a family influences in their lifetime. As we have seen before, it is always in our best interests to do things God’s way. Profound and magnificent blessings follow in that pathway. One path leads to death, the other path leads to life. Let’s help them choose life! Let’s give our clients a gift that keeps on giving, as we share the vision (and science!) of marriage, empowering them to experience one wonderful and memorable Valentine’s Day after another, year after year, and decade after decade."
