MCS is blessed by an amazing partnership with parents, grandparents, alumni, and friends who support our mission of “building a firm foundation through Christ-centered education” through Annual Fund donations.     Tuition covers 95% of an MCS student’s education, as we seek to keep MCS affordable for as many Orange",

        "text": "Recent examples of projects and initiatives funded by Annual Fund donations include:\n\nFinancial Aid/Scholarships to deserving families who desire a Christian education for their children and otherwise would not have the opportunity\n\nExpansion of STEM through the creation of a dynamic, K-8th grade Maker Education program\n\nNew flexible classroom seating to support individualized learning\n\nNew high-level Literacy initiative in K-8th grades\n\nFantastic professional development opportunities for teachers\n\nExpansion of iPad program to promote individual academic ownership\n\nTechnology infrastructure to support growing needs of our digital learners\n\nCampus upgrades to continue strengthening a 21st Century learning environment\n\nWe believe the Lord will move in the hearts of the MCS community and each will give as they are compelled by Him. What you give is entirely up to you, and we trust that you will make a gift that is meaningful to your family. Every gift, regardless of size, is important and appreciated and brings us closer to reaching our fundraising goal. Gifts of any size inspire more people to give; they are a vote of confidence in our school and our community. Last year, the average gift size was $1500, with gifts ranging from $25 to $50,000.\n\nMany companies will match charitable contributions by their employees. The company helps to support worthy causes and the employee can maximize the amount donated to the charity. Many MCS parents work for matching gift companies—please check with your human resources department or your employer to see if they will match your gift.\n\nThere is strength in numbers! Our goal for 100% family participation will help MCS accomplish strategic improvements for the benefit of students today and into the future. In addition, a strong participation rate demonstrates to the local community that our families are “100%” unified in mission and purpose. When foundation donors are considering their support of MCS, a key influencing factor is community participation.\n\nGenerally speaking, unrestricted donations are of the greatest value to MCS, as they provide the most flexibility within our budget. However, we understand that some donors have a passion for a particular program or initiative and prefer to designate their donation as such. This is completely acceptable, as long as the designation aligns with the mission and vision of MCS.\n\nThe Annual Fund helps keep tuition as low as possible. Like almost all independent schools, tuition does not cover the full cost of an MCS education. Funds raised through the Annual Fund bridge the 5% gap between tuition revenue and the cost of running the school.\n\nAlthough we hope that everyone will participate in other fundraising initiatives, if you have one gift to make, it should be to the Annual Fund. The need to bridge the gap between tuition and the actual cost of a student’s education is an ongoing yearly challenge and your donation ensures the sustainability of MCS."
