        "text": "Private school in Candler, North Carolina, United States\n\nMount Pisgah Academy is a four-year secondary education boarding and day school located in Candler, North Carolina, United States, near Asheville. The academy is named after the Mount Pisgah of biblical reference as well as its proximity to Mount Pisgah in the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n\nAffiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the campus lies on 230 acres (93 ha) of property.[2] It was founded in 1914[3] as a private academy, by E.C. Waller, William Steinman, and C.A. Graves with their families,[4] and originally called the Pisgah Industrial Institute.[5][6] In 1952, its ownership was transferred to the Carolina Conference of the Seventh-Day Adventist church, and it was given its present name.[7] It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.[8][9][10][11]\n\nThe current principal at the academy is Dewald Coetzer.[12][13]\n\nFor the 2023-2024 school year, it had an enrollment of 90 students.[14]\n\nAcademics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe required curriculum includes classes in the following subject areas: religion, English, social studies, mathematics, science, STEM, computer applications, physical education, health, fine arts, and electives.\n\nElectives\n\n[edit]\n\nMount Pisgah Academy offers several electives, or organizations. The students are encouraged to participate in at least one organization during their time at the academy. As of 2024, Mount Pisgah Academy offered the following organizations:\n\nAcrosports\n\nSan Cielo (a touring choir)\n\nDrama\n\nVarsity Sports\n\nYearbook[15]\n\nSpiritual aspects\n\n[edit]\n\nAll students take religion classes each year that they are enrolled. These classes cover topics in biblical history and Christian and denominational doctrines. Instructors in other disciplines also begin each class period with prayer or a short devotional thought, many which encourage student input. Weekly, the entire student body gathers together in the auditorium for an hour-long chapel service. Outside the classroom, there is year-round spiritually-oriented programming that relies on student involvement.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nChristianity portal\n\nSchools portal\n\nUnited States portal\n\nList of Seventh-day Adventist secondary schools\n\nSeventh-day Adventist education\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
