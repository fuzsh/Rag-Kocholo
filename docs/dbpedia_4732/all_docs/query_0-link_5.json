        "text": "Ben Lippen is not a person, but a way of life.\n\nIn 1940, Columbia Bible College (CBC) founded a conference center and boarding school in the mountains near Asheville, N.C. The college chose a Scottish phrase, “ben lippen,” meaning “Mountain of Trust” as the name of the site. Today, as we look back through Ben Lippen School’s history, it remains our desire to trust the Lord and to impart that trust to our students.\n\nRead more\n\nCarefully Planned Curriculum\n\nAs our students move from pre-school to grade 12, we have an end goal in mind: to fully prepare your student for college and beyond, ready to impact and influence the world according to his or her unique gifts.\n\nOur philosophy of learning includes well-designed curriculum (constructed with the end in mind); learner-centered instruction; proven, effective teaching methodologies and an attitude of life-long learning add up to authentic learning and a well-educated child.\n\nWe offer many opportunities to grow in leadership at Ben Lippen. Students have the opportunity to lead in theater productions, athletic teams, and student government. Prefects are also an opportunity to serve for the upperclassmen. Senior year of high school is often seen as a chance for leadership—a way students can give back to the community that has guided and shaped them for the last four or so years and ensuring their peers carry on a legacy in their wake. Such service is especially evident at Ben Lippen School, with the motto “Equipping Students and Establishing Leaders” seen most literally in the spiritual life prefects."
