Each component builds upon the other and is designed to impact the heart of the child so they can then turn and impact others.\n\nCornerstone Christian School values the importance of helping students find the area of talent in which God has gifted them! As students explore and find their giftings, they are able to grow in these areas as they move through elementary and into middle school."
