        "text": "We have had another great ministry year. Last year was my 8th year working with the littles at The Way and each year has had new blessings. For our Preschool and Kindergarten kiddos we have 8 every other week volunteers plus youth that step in to assist in guiding our littles. We have grown in numbers of children and consistency of attendance this last year. Our volunteers are so patient and loving to each child that comes into our group. We have welcomed many new families into our program this year and have enjoyed watching them grow. Seeing our kids that have been here welcome new families and invite them into their activities is so heartwarming.\n\nSummer Camp this year was great. We had 25 volunteers that came each night after work for a whole week to help share Jesus with kids from Kindergarten through 6th Grade. We learned that God is always with us, he will forgive us, he loves everyone and we can share his love with others. On Thursday we welcomed all the families and the kids were able to show their parents what they had learned all week. We had volunteers inviting families and kids inviting their friends to bring with them. It takes a lot to go into this week, we couldn’t do it without our volunteers. Seeing the kids go out and be disciples to others makes each moment worth it.\n\nWe do 4 family nights a year, each one is different. We welcome families to join us on a Friday night where we have a lesson from the Bible. Then we do something that relates the story to the family's life or that as a family they can do. We have done service projects, carved pumpkins, made prayer trees and put together kits to help overseas. This night is a great change that I enjoy giving families a way they can help teach their children about the Bible. We also send stuff home for families to expand on after the night is done. These nights were a way for us to help guide parents to be leaders for their kids at home to go beyond Sundays. Assisting families in fun new ways to teach and guide their children to Christ is the best blessing to see.\n\nEach Summer in July we have Little Sparks for kids 3-5 to prep and get them ready for Rush. Every Sunday in July during the 9 am service we have a Bible lesson, activity, snack and prayer time. Listening to the kids' prayers at this age is so entertaining we encourage them to talk to God about anything and that can get interesting. We have a lot of fun and everyone gets to meet the kids they will be with in Rush also.\n\nThis last year has been full of memories and moments that melt my heart. The little moments are what make it worth it like hearing a 4 year old pray for his entire group for the first time. Having a kiddo come one week and be nervous to leave his parents and then the next week hearing they woke up everyday asking when they can come back. Seeing families come because one of our kids invited a friend to join them. Having kids ask me to pray for them when something happens knowing that they are learning to turn to God with their struggles. Kids have no filter so everything they say is genuine and I get so much Joy from all our littles.\n\nAs I reflect on the 2023 ministry year, I am amazed how our team worships. It shows their love for Jesus and their understanding of worshipping Him. I am also amazed how easy it is to lead the people of The Way into God’s throne room. We clearly have a congregation that love to worship Jesus, just like our team. I am truly grateful for the time each team member spends preparing every week. They sacrificially give up their family time to prepare for Sunday and special services. This past year the team has lead worship every Sunday along with several special services which included, Thanksgiving Eve, Christmas Eve, Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, prayer services and Sending Network gatherings. I am also grateful for Scott and Amanda who have stepped up to be team leaders, and to Jenn and Lee for organizing our music. Our team wouldn’t be as successful without their efforts. This year the Lord brought us 2 new vocalists which have been great additions to the team. As we start 2024 we continue to pray for new musicians. We also continue to look for ways to pour into our team members to strengthen their Biblical and musical knowledge as worship leaders.\n\n-Al Law | Lead\n\nI give Jesus all the glory for the privilege of bringing Him praises in the congregation of believers every weekend, and then through the weeks between with my family in our hearts, home, cars and everywhere between. It is such a blessing to serve alongside others who want nothing more than to bring honor, glory and praise to triune God, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n\nThis has been a physically challenging year for me. Many noticed that I was seated most of the time during our worship times since before Christmas until Easter. This was due to a bulging lumbar disk causing spinal stenosis and pinching the nerves in that area, greatly restricting my range of motion and causing no small amount of pain and discomfort. I want to take this opportunity to thank so so many of you for all of the prayers that went up on my behalf. Through many chiropractic and physical therapy sessions, the situation is vastly improved, and I am grateful for the healing that has restored me to almost normal activity. This experience has been humbling, but has also made me more grateful for everyday things that are easy to take for granted.\n\nPraying for each of you in return, that our loving Lord will sustain the measure of faith He has given to you, and grow it from grace to grace. May his peace and assurance be yours always!\n\n-Scott Wilson | Worship Leader\n\nAs I reflect on this past year, I am filled with gratitude and awe at how God has moved within the worship ministry at The Way. It has been a year of growth, challenges, and abundant blessings! The Lord’s faithfulness and guidance has been evident in all of it. We have gained new vocalists, instrumentalists, and tech, which I am going to shout out a huge Thank You to the tech team, because a lot of times they are not seen, but they are a crucial piece in making services and events run smoothly! Everyone shows up and is ready to be a part of God’s story and plan with hearts of worship, reverence, and offering. I am so excited to see God’s growth continue through the seasons ahead and that the heart of discipleship will continue to unfold within the worship ministry. We are the body of Christ and we need each other. As part of the Sending Network, the church staff and leaders gather throughout the year, as a time to network and pray with others that serve within the same ministry. From my experience, sitting with other worship leaders in this space is profound and enriching. These gatherings are a powerful way to build community, share resources, and support one another in faith. The purpose is to honor and glorify God, by reflecting His heart for unity, worship and extending the reach of His love and message of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nAs we move into the coming year, it’s with a deep sense of anticipation and excitement for what lies ahead! Worship is not an act or a performance, but rather a Surrender, an Offering, and Regard with extravagant respect, honor, and devotion. My challenge this year is to be an “Extravagant Worshiper.” To be overgenerous in praise to God and move into deeper waters with Jesus our Lord and Savior!\n\n“Let everything that has breath praise the Lord! Praise the Lord”! Psalm 150:6\n\n-Amanda Van Zante | Worship Leader\n\nOne of my favorite things about discipleship is seeing people grow in their faith in Jesus and embrace the transformative power of the Holy Spirit. Over the last ministry year, there are so many ways that this is happening right here at The Way! People of all ages are drawing closer to Jesus, connecting with Christian community, and stepping out in faith and obedience. It’s been amazing to witness the ways God is at work in our community.\n\nHere are a few highlights from Adult Discipleship.\n\nBook Studies - The Power to Change by Craig Groeschel and Emotionally Healthy Spirituality by Peter Scazzero\n\nThis past ministry year, we offered two book studies. In the fall, we read The Power to Change by Craig Groeschel. Sometimes in our Christian walk, we can feel stuck. But we don’t have to feel this way! This study showed practical ways to seek transformation through the power of the Holy Spirit. Some important topics we covered include that who God is calling us to be is more important than what he is calling us to do, the small things matter greatly over time, and that transformation happens by God’s power, not by our willpower. This was a great study with practical tips for change.\n\nIn the spring, we offered Emotionally Healthy Spirituality by Peter Scazzero. The tagline reads, “It’s impossible to be spiritually mature while remaining emotionally immature” and this book helps develop awareness of areas where we need to grow or may have blind spots. We talked about breaking the power of the past, letting go of power and control, and knowing personal limits. We also talked about ways to move forward through focusing on Jesus and eternity, learning new skills to love well, and loving Christ above all else. This book encourages us into a deeper relationship with Jesus while becoming more self aware.\n\nZack and Elisha Biehn - Financial Peace University\n\nWe taught Financial Peace University for the 3rd time this last year. We enjoy teaching this class since it has changed so much for us. Going through each of the steps. During this process you learn to making a budget, save an emergency fund and paying off debt which are the first 3 and some of the hardest to get started. Being able to walk alongside those that took the class and help people in all different stages of their life to find freedom from their finances is amazing.\n\nDave Wagner – Divorce Care\n\nAs the leader of DivorceCare, I have seen over the past 11 years that God does amazing things in 13 weeks of the class. As a person that has been divorced and has gone through this exact program 2 and three times, I understand totally what each and everyone is feeling when they come through those doors. People come in hurting, discouraged, angry, depressed, lost, separated and have lost all hope and think that there isn't any way out. I can honestly say that every time I have held the DivorceCare class, God shows up and transforms lives. It doesn't solve all of their issues, but it does give them a sense of hope and understanding that this is just a moment in their life that God is with them. He will never ever leave them or forsake them during this time. He even says in his word, that he is with the brokenhearted. He shows up every time and I am so blessed to be God's servant that can pour out my love for all of these people. I am truly blessed to know each and every one of these people. -Dave Wagner\n\nMarcy Milburn – Nursing Home Ministries (Jeff Guthrie and Julie Jones)\n\nWe have had lots of opportunities to minister to people in nursing homes this year. Jeff Guthrie and Julie Jones lead worship services at Accura East once a month. Marcy and her team lead Bible studies every Tuesday at Traditions Memory Care in Newton. It has been a blessing to get to work with people who are not physically able to come to a church service and to share the gospel with them. A big Thank You to Betty Nikkel who plays the keyboard every Tuesday for the residents. Their memory connects through music and it’s a blessing to see how they remember the songs, hymns, scriptures, and the Lord’s prayer that they learned when they were younger. This also has been an opportunity to share the gospel with people who haven’t had a faith background, trusting that God will use these moments to open their hearts to Him. A huge thank you goes to everyone who helps with these services at the various nursing homes in Newton!\n\nRooted Groups - Marc & Amanda Headington and Nathan & Ashley Smith\n\nWe had two Rooted groups that launched this fall. The 7 rhythms of Rooted are daily devotions, prayer, repentance, sacrificial generosity, serving the community, sharing your story, and worship. Rooted helps develop these as regular rhythms in our lives and does so in the context of Christian community. God has used Rooted to make an impact in people’s lives. This year we had two Rooted groups that met on different days of the week. For many participants this year, this was one of the first classes they had ever attended and was a stretch out of their comfort zone. They shared testimonies about how God has worked in their lives and grew through this small group.\n\nJulie Jones – Spirit Led work ministry\n\nThe Spirit Led Work ministry is a group of individuals who share our struggles and blessings at work, and then look at what scripture says about how we are to be in the workplace. We consider how the Holy Spirit can lead us in our business decisions, and how we can share Jesus at work, either through our behavior or with our words. We currently meet monthly on Monday night, so we can review how we have started our work week, and then look at the rest of our week through the word of God and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. If you aren't seeing God's plan in your workplace, then join us, because He cares about all aspects of our lives.\n\nJulie Jones – Theology\n\nIn systematic theology we studied a whole range of doctrinal topics like end times, who God is, and the trinity to name a few. As a class we wrestled with understanding God's glory and providence and how that foundation helps us understand how we interpret scripture from the context of the entire Bible.\n\nBarb Wisgerhof – Griefshare\n\nGrief Share has given many people an opportunity to find hope and comfort through their personal journey. They are able to share how grief has affected their lives. Through the materials and discussion they see they aren't alone. We hope to see them go from mourning to joy. We're planning a fall session as well as a Holiday session. -Barb Wisgerhof\n\nKirk Douglas – Operation Finding Freedom\n\nOver the past year, Operation Finding Freedom has welcomed several new veterans to our gatherings. We have had folks from the Korean war years through the Global War on Terror.\n\nWe have been working through 1 Samual, highlighting how we can find Jesus in nearly every story. The bond often found in veteran groups has played a part in our discussions, as well as the friendly inter-service rivalries. We are nearly evenly divided between Army & Navy, but the Navy gets some help from the Marines from time to time.\n\nOperation Finding Freedom continues to meet over the Summer on the first Friday of the month and all veterans are welcome to join us for some Christian fellowship and veteran camaraderie.\n\nNow the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 2 Cor 3:17 –Kirk Douglas\n\nMike and Lisa Van Sant – Hope for Hurting Parents\n\nHope for Hurting Parents group continued to meet this session each month, ending in May and we finally finished our Hope for Hurting Parents Study Guide! A few new people joined us near the end of the ministry year so we feel there is still a need to continue this group and plan to offer it again in the fall. Due to the size of our group, we feel that it is possible to have a couple groups meeting in order to create a more intimate setting as we understand how difficult it can be to share and work through some hard discussions and share pain in larger groups. We decided to take a break for the summer and we pray God will continue to help us help other hurting parents on their journey with their family situations. We know there are plenty of parents out there that are hurting (prodigal children, adult children with mental challenges, drug/alcohol abuse, etc) and we want to give them an opportunity to learn, grieve and grow leaning on Christ as our main comfort. “But as for me, I will always have hope; I will praise you more and more. My mouth will tell of your righteousness, of your salvation all day long, though I know not its measure.” Psalm 71:14-15\n\nVivian Huisman - Quilting Ministry\n\nThe Quilting Ministry has given away 43 large quilts and 13 baby-youth quilts. We have about 20 more that are ready to have a home. We are so grateful to those that have taken kits home and helped us stay ahead of the game. There are about 6 quilts ready to be knotted and bound to start our fall season. There are kits available to women, men, and youth who want to work on a quilt this summer and we will continue to have them available this fall. The Way Quilters\n\nMarlys Popma - Christian Ethics\n\nWe finished up the full Christian Ethics class this year. It was an interesting 2 and one-half years to completion. On some issues we had total agreement, on others we had some rigorous discussions. This year's class had 17 people in attendance, many who had attended all of the sessions over the two plus years of the class. We enjoyed learning how to evaluate ethical decisions based on Biblical principles. Our positions were often confirmed and at times challenged. We were so thankful that God has given us a textbook (Bible) by which to evaluate life's challenging questions.\n\nTim & Kari Hemann - The Journey\n\nThe Journey - We were a small but mighty group who laughed and cried, teased and prayed together. We discovered much about God and ourselves throughout the year. Our class developed deep relationships as we studied scripture, reflected on our character and identity in Christ, and listened for the calling God has on our lives. We shared our individual stories with each other that included intentionally identifying the goodness and grace of God throughout our lives. Finally, we explored ways to share our talents and gifts with others. - Tim and Kari Hemann\n\nCJ & Pam Osborn - A Way of Life\n\nA Way of Life from VantagePoint3 – This class is a group program that helps adults deepen their relationship with God and structure their lives around a lifelong apprenticeship with Jesus. The well-established program involves weekly two-hour meetings, usually with 6–12 people. The meetings cover topics such as accountability, safe relationships, prayer, and honest conversation; participants are encouraged to meet with a spiritual mentor outside for additional perspective. The program also includes sub-groups for mutual mentoring for six to eight months, as well as regular Bible reading, supplemental reading, reflection, and prayer. CJ and Pam completed training to prepare for facilitating this class and the 2023/2024 class was the third class they have lead. This class is a great opportunity to use a well-structured plan to draw close to God and enjoy fellowship. - CJ and Pam Osborn\n\nPam Osborn – Many Hands Impact Trip\n\nMany Hands Impact Trip to Abaco:\n\nAn Impact Trip provides a chance to step away from the familiar and embrace the unknown, all while making a meaningful contribution to build and strengthen God's kingdom. There are several opportunities to connect with incredible people through meaningful experiences and shared stories. There is also time to reflect on our own journey and identify the passion that resides in each of us and look to the future with expectancy on how God wants us to live a more intentional life of impact.\n\nIn February, 2024 a group of 16 packed our bags and headed to Abaco, an island in the Bahamas, for a week of service to provide healing and restoration for the people of Marsh Harbour, Abaco. We were able to see first hand the destruction of Hurricane Dorian and work on projects that address the needs of the island which include gaps in fundamental education, food insecurity and reconstruction. The main activities of the week are listed below.\n\nWorshiped with Bahamians and Haitians at a local church\n\nPurchased food in a local grocery store and then later distributed food to those in need in the Marsh Harbour community\n\nPainted and hung drywall at a community center that is being rebuilt from Hurricane Dorian\n\nToured a hydroponic farm and then harvested produce and prepared it to be sold at the farmer's market\n\nInteracted with the schools by reading to children in the classroom and attending a boy's basketball game\n\nAttended youth group at a church and enjoyed a traditional Bahamian dinner of Souse and Johnny Cake prepared for us by church members\n\nIn the middle of the week, we took a break from projects to experience the unique Bahamian culture which included swimming in a blue hole, a tasty lunch of fresh seafood at a beach front restaurant and soaking up the beauty of the island on several beaches. Each evening we had time to unpack the experiences of the day and reflect on how God was using these experiences to inspire us towards growth.\n\nIn March, our team of 16 shared our Impact Trip experiences to over 50 people who gathered in The Way Cafe to learn about this incredible opportunity to witness God's global heart which was revealed to us in the midst of both the beauty and the tragedies of Abaco."
