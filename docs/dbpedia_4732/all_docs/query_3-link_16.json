They enjoyed a taste of our weekly chapel, an interactive time in the classroom, and a Chick-fil-A lunch. We love our RCS grandparents and love seeing our students value their time together.\n\nEncouragement and Prayer:\n\nToday’s culture thrives on division. When something happens, we are thrust into different camps, requiring us to declare which side we are on. Often, this process occurs along ideological or political lines. Our friends and loved ones can move from family to foe in an instant. This is not God’s plan for us.\n\nInstead of seeing people as potential enemies, the love of Christ should bond us together. The Apostle Paul addresses our relationships with one another in his letter to the church in Rome. Take a moment to read the following passage to see the stark contrast with how today’s culture would have us act:\n\n“Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. 10 Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. 11 Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. 12 Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. 13 Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality. 14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 15 Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. 16 Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited. 17 Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. 18 If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. 19 Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord. 20 On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.” 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” Romans 12:9-21.\n\nOur starting point should be love. Love should bind us together, not divide us. Love should focus our attention on the needs of others, not toward self. Love should guide us toward harmony and peace, not strife and division. As followers of Christ, let’s reflect the love described by the Apostle Paul and not the divisiveness of today’s culture.\n\nGod, bind us together in unity, despite our differences. Help us to enter each conversation with the foundation of Your love. Help us to find common ground and unite around Your redemptive mission. We pray for our divided culture and country. Bring healing and peace. Give us Your mercy and grace today. Amen.\n\nHave a great week!\n\nThanks,\n\nRandy McMillan\n\nRCS | Head of School\n\nRead More about Things to Know this Week (May 3rd)\n\nSchool News\n\nIt's that time of the year to show our best appreciation for our teachers and all the hard work they do for us!\n\nTake a look at the image below for ideas on how you can make your teacher feel extra special each day this week.\n\nRead More about Teacher Appreciation Week (May 6th-10th)\n\nKP – 1st Grade Easter Concert | March 28 | 8:45AM\n\nTomorrow, March 28th is our Kindergarten Prep – 1st grade Easter Concert. This will take place during their normal chapel time at 8:45am. Everyone is welcome to join us and celebrate the hope we have in our risen Savior! Our Spring Concert for 2nd – 4th grade will be on May 23rd. Our Spring Concert for 5th – 8th grade will be May 7th. Each of these concerts will be streamed at: https://rcs.online.church/. Details for our May concerts will be sent out in the coming weeks.\n\nPray for Middle School Mexico Missions Trip\n\nEvery year, a group of RCS middle school students, parents and staff go on a trip during Easter break. Every other year our trip goes on a missions trip to Mexico and the alternate year, we go to Washington DC & New York City. Please pray for our group heading to Mexico on April 1st. Pray for their protection, health, and serving opportunities as we build a home for a great family through YWAM (Youth With A Mission).\n\nRCS Mother Son Night Success\n\nOur first ever Mother Son event took place on March 14th! Over 600 moms and sons had an incredible time at DEFY, the indoor trampoline park in Tukwila. Family events like this help build relational bonds between parents, students, and families. We are committed to developing a strong community at RCS.\n\nSave the Date! | RCS Grandparents Day | April 26th | 11am – 2pm\n\nWe are excited to announce the return of Grandparent's Day on Friday, April 26th.

He is Risen!\n\nThanks,\n\nRandy McMillan\n\nRCS | Head of School\n\nRead More about Things to Know this Week (March 27)\n\nRCS Families,\n\nGod is at work at Renton Christian! This week at chapel, 32 students publicly declared their faith in Jesus Christ though water baptism. Spiritual formation is a foundational element of RCS. When a student begins or develops their faith in Christ, we celebrate! So far this school year, over 50 students decided to make Jesus Christ their Lord and Savior! When this decision happens, we encourage students to connect with a pastor at their church to make that decision public. Many churches use water baptism to outwardly declare this inward transformation. Each year, we provide an opportunity for RCS students to be baptized at one of our chapels. It was so moving to see 32 students publicly profess their faith in front of their peers at chapel this week! Please join me in praying for each of these students. Pray that the commitment they made will carry them to adulthood and ultimately to eternity.\n\nHere are a few of things to know this week:\n\nRCS Gala and Auction | 6:30pm, Friday, March 22nd | Main Auditorium\n\nIt’s not too late to join us at our Annual Gala and Auction on Friday, March 22nd.

Please contact Mai Bonilla at mbonilla@rentonchristian.org or (425) 226-0820 ext. 487\n\nSTEM Day Recap\n\nWednesday was STEM Day at RCS! Steamboat Studios spent the day with us. Each RCS student learned about different forms of forces and magnetism. They saw science demonstrations in an assembly and then performed hands-on experiments in the classroom with personalized science kits. It was a great day of inspiration and instilling scientific curiosity in each student.\n\nPrayer & Encouragement:\n\nThis year I am reading through the Bible from the beginning. Right now, I am reading through the book of Numbers. I love this book, not just because I am a numbers guy, but also because it demonstrates God’s intentionality and provision for His people. The book of Numbers records the journey of Moses and the Israelite people through the Desert of Sinai after they left Egypt and on their way to the promised land. This journey was full of frustration, complaints, and hardships. However, it was also full of God’s provision, presence, and protection. The humanity of the people of God was on full display. God’s presence was clear through a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. God’s provision was miraculous by providing manna each morning and water from rocks. God’s protection from their surrounding enemies was powerful. Despite all of this, several times, the Israelites, complained to Moses for bringing them out of the slavery of Egypt. Why? I believe they allowed the hardships of the moment to suppress the promise of their future. The unknowns of the Promised Land and the challenges of the journey created more discomfort than the known reality of their past. God has a purpose and a call for each of us to fulfill His mission going forward. This applies to us individually and together as a school. God gave us a dream to see 100 students graduate each year, rooted in Christ, and equipped to change the world. Let’s remain focused on where God is calling us rather than where we were or any momentary hardships. We serve a faithful God. My prayer is that God’s presence, provision, and protection will remain on each person at Renton Christian. Please join me in prayer for God's continued clarity, wisdom, and direction.\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nThanks,\n\nRandy McMillan\n\nRCS | Head of School\n\nRead More about Things to Know this Week (March 8)\n\nAs March welcomes the warmth of the sun and the blossoming of cherry blossom trees, it signifies the arrival of spring—a time of new beginnings and hope. It's a season that reminds us of the beauty of growth and the promise of brighter days ahead.\n\nAmidst the excitement of this season, I wanted to take a moment to encourage each of you. As a parent myself, I understand the challenges of balancing academics, activities, and the myriad of events that come with raising children. At RCS, we are here to partner with you on your parenting journey, supporting you every step of the way.\n\nWe believe that learning academic content is crucial for the future success of our students. However, we also emphasize the importance of instilling Christ-like behaviors within our community. In our Profile of a Student, you will find that love, character, and wisdom are the three core attributes we integrate into all lessons.\n\nI'd like to share a few ways you can help your child grow in these areas at home:\n\nWisdom: Encourage your child to be open-minded and teachable, fostering a spirit of discernment and self-discipline in their studies and activities.\n\nLove: Demonstrate love by serving others, honoring people even in disagreement, and offering encouragement to those around them.\n\nCharacter: Model integrity, humility, and resilience, teaching your child to do what is right even when no one is watching and to take responsibility for their actions.\n\nAs we journey through spring, my prayer for you is that God would fill your hearts with joy and that you would feel the support of our school community. Remember, it takes a village to raise a child, and here at RCS, we are committed to supporting and honoring your role as parents.\n\nThank you for entrusting us with your children's education and growth. Together, let's work as a team to guide them along the path that the Lord has prepared for their lives.\n\nAlways in your corner,\n\nLisa Hopp\n\nRead More about THE PRINCIPAL'S CORNER\n\nRCS Families,\n\nAs we head into mid-winter break, my prayer is that God would provide you rest and that you would create lasting memories with your family.

Give them your wisdom and insight. Protect them physically, spiritually, and emotionally. Bless their families and honor their significant investment in our students. May your peace, that passes all understanding, guard their hearts and minds in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:7).\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nThanks,\n\nRandy McMillan\n\nRCS | Head of School\n\nRead More about Things to Know this Week (Feb 2)\n\nI hope this finds you well and filled with the warmth of February, the month of love. At RCS, we are embracing love with a strong focus on the Profile of a Student domain of love this trimester. We are encouraging our students to express love through service, honoring one another, practicing forgiveness as Christ forgives, and uplifting and encouraging one another. As the fruits of the spirit include love, we aim to instill and inspire all our students to walk in love throughout this month.\n\nExciting events are on the horizon, with the highly anticipated Daddy Daughter dance just around the corner. This special occasion provides an opportunity for father figures to share quality time with their daughters, creating cherished memories that last a lifetime. It has become an annual tradition that I eagerly look forward to each year, celebrating the unique bond between fathers and daughters within our RCS community.\n\nI also want to take a moment to offer some encouragement on the best ways to continue partnering with RCS and supporting your child's learning at home:\n\nPartnership with Teachers: Foster open communication with your child's teachers. Your involvement and collaboration are crucial in supporting your child both at home and in school.\n\nLiteracy Integration: Incorporate literacy into daily activities. Whether it's reading recipes together, writing letters to family members, or having your child read aloud to you, these practices promote a love for learning and language.\n\nEstablishing a Predictable Routine: Maintaining a predictable routine not only encourages learning but also helps students strengthen their executive functioning skills, fostering organization and a sense of stability.\n\nActive Learning and Curiosity: Encourage your child to actively engage with their curiosity. When they have questions, turn it into a fun activity by researching together and finding more information. This approach promotes a love for discovery and lifelong learning.\n\nI want to express my heartfelt gratitude for each of you and the incredible partnership we share. It is both a joy and an honor to serve you and your children, and I look forward to the continued growth and success of our RCS community.\n\nWishing you a month filled with love and the joy of the Lord!\n\nAlways in your corner,\n\nPrincipal Hopp\n\nRead More about THE PRINCIPAL'S CORNER\n\nRCS Families,\n\nThank you for supporting the arts at Renton Christian! We had a packed house last night for the opening night of our musical theater performance of Wizard of Oz. Our students did so well! Their creativity and God-given gifts shown through so well. All remaining shows are sold out!

SLC will be open at normal hours. BASC will provide full-day care for those registered.\n\nLeak Update\n\nGod’s protection and provision continues to be evident in the 10 days since the broken fire sprinkler flooded our server room and computer lab. All affected areas have been fully and professionally dried out. All damaged sheetrock and flooring have been removed. All damaged equipment has been inventoried and removed. All critical systems have been restored with a temporary solution while the rooms are reconstructed. Replacement equipment and supplies have been reordered. We are working with the insurance company to approve the restoration scope. If everything continues to go well, we hope to have the bulk of the construction take place during mid-winter break and have everything restored (or near completion) when we return on February 26th.\n\nEncouragement and Prayer:\n\nThis month I have been reading Genesis and Exodus. It is amazing to see God’s intentionality through this narrative as He protected, provided, and redeemed His people. God’s presence guided the Israelites through the desert with a cloud by day and a pilar of fire by night. Despite God’s providence and presence, the Israelites succumbed to fear, selfishness, and sinful behavior. Regardless, God desired reconciliation and provided continuous opportunities for the Israelites to turn their hearts back to Him. Today, we are susceptible to pressures, temptations, and sinful tendencies that can separate us from God. We need to make daily decisions to grow our faith and draw closer to Him. Through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, we can be fully reconciled to God. Although we can accept the gift of salvation in a moment, our spiritual development is a continual process.\n\nI pray that God would draw you close to Him. I pray that you will commit again to live for God aligned with His nature and will. I pray that God will continue to protect and provide for your family and for Renton Christian.\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nThanks,\n\nRandy McMillan\n\nRCS | Head of School\n\nRead More about Things to Know this Week (Jan 26)\n\nRCS Families,\n\nThank you for your patience this week with the weather and water leak impacts. I am thankful for God’s protection and provision regarding the leak caused by a broken fire sprinkler head. The leak occurred without students on campus but while staff were on campus. No one was hurt and things can be replaced. The timing of the leak allowed our team to respond immediately and limit the impact. The damage to the server room and computer lab was extensive, however, our team and vendors restored critical systems within 36 hours to enable us to open with only one lost day! The mitigation & restoration company is still drying everything out, inventorying all damaged equipment, and will begin restoring spaces next week. We are actively working to replace and restore impacted areas as soon as possible and are working with our insurance company to minimize the financial impact. We expect the exterior door systems and interior flow to be restored early next week. Please pray that the restoration and insurance claim process continue to go efficiently and smoothly. During times like this, I am so proud of our incredible team! We rally, we are flexible, and we respond with a positive “we can make this happen” mentality.\n\nHere are a few of things to know this week:\n\n5 Ways to Build Resilience in Our Students | Parent Enrichment Night Video\n\nThe Chaplin of the UW Huskies and Seattle Seahawks, Jonathan Rainey, joined us for our Parent Enrichment Night last Tuesday.

We have added doors to secure classroom access. Once completed, during the school day, an individual will be remotely buzzed into the school office. After checking in, the office will remotely provide access to the necessary hallway.\n\nSecurity Film – We are adding clear security film to the first–floor windows. This film holds shattered glass in place to prevent unauthorized entry. This film was already added to all doors at the end of last school year.\n\nEncouragement and Prayer:\n\nAs we begin this year, I encourage you to self-assess your relationship with Christ. Do you feel full of hope & life or depleted & weak? There is a constant battle for our soul. Jesus came that we would have life and have it to the full. In contrast, the devil comes only to steal and kill and destroy (John 10:10). Jesus came to seek and save the lost (Luke 19:9-10). He demonstrated His extravagant love in our worst state (Romans 5:8). Jesus is also our source of nourishment and strength. He described himself as the vine and we are the branches. He promised if we remain in Him, He will remain in us, and we will be fruitful (John 15:5).\n\nIf you feel depleted and week, have you fully surrendered your life to Christ and received His salvation? If not, I encourage you to begin this year with this important step. If you want to do this, I would love to have a personal conversation to start this new faith journey. If you have already done this but still feel depleted and weak, how connected are you to the vine? What intentional practices do you have to spend time with your heavenly Father? Whenever I feel depleted, I assess my faith practices and usually realize I have become sloppy with them. I encourage you to dial in your faith practices as we start this year. For me, I read two chapters in the Bible each morning at 5am in the same chair in our living room. If you want to be more connected with Jesus, I encourage you to pick a place, pick a plan, and pick a time. With these things in place, you intentionally create space to commune with your Creator.\n\nMy prayer is that we would start this year working on growing closer with Christ. I pray that we would be an example for our students and experience the full life that God designed for us.\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nThanks,\n\nRandy McMillan\n\nRCS | Head of School\n\nRead More about Things to Know this Week (Jan 5)\n\nSchool News\n\nWe’re off to see the Wizard!\n\nCLICK HERE to purchase your tickets and join us in celebrating the gifts and talents of our wonderful Musical Theatre cast and team!\n\nShowtimes are as follows:\n\nOpening Night** Thursday, January 25th at 7pm\n\nFriday, January 26th at 7pm\n\nMatinee and Final Show** Saturday, January 27th at 2pm and 7pm\n\nWe can’t wait to see you there!\n\nRead More about Wizard of Oz Tickets On Sale Now!\n\nDear Renton Christian School Families,\n\nHappy New Year!

This is such a great time of the year celebrating the birth of our Savior at RCS.\n\nHere are a few of things to know this week:\n\nSupport our Financial Aid | RCS Legacy Fund\n\nWe need your help! 164 students currently receive financial assistance. We do not limit our financial aid budget. Due to this commitment, this year, our financial aid increased by over $150,000. Will you consider a gift to our Legacy Fund to enable our continued financial support with these students? We want to ensure they continue learning in a Christ-centered environment. Thank you for your generosity and investment into the lives of RCS students. CLICK HERE to give a one-time or reoccurring gift.\n\nRCS Christmas Concerts | Thursday, Dec 14th\n\nThis is the season to celebrate the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ. We will have three Christmas concerts this year. Our students have been preparing and practicing for this special concert and we cannot wait to see you there. Each concert will be in the Main Auditorium. Below are the three concert times. Each concert will also be live streamed at: https://rcs.online.church/.\n\nKprep-1st Grade: 8:45am\n\n2nd – 4th Grade: 10:00am\n\n5th – 8th Grade: 7:00pm\n\nSave the Date! | Parent Enrichment Night | 7pm, January 16th\n\nThe Chaplin of the UW Huskies and Seattle Seahawks, Jonathan Rainey, will join us for our Parent Enrichment Night at 7pm on Tuesday, January 16th. He will speak on developing resilience in our students. Jonathan Rainey is a gifted communicator and will help us grow as parents! You do not want to miss this night!\n\nReenrollment for 2024 – 2025 School Year | New Deadline, January 31st\n\nReenrollment for next school year will open for current families on Tuesday, January 2nd. Current families will have until January 31st to reenroll before we begin placing new families. Several grades will have a waitlist based anticipated new family interest. We will send you an email on January 2nd with a link to reenroll current students and priority enrollment for younger siblings. Thank you for your continued trust and partnership with Renton Christian.\n\nSpirit Day & Early Dismissal | Friday, December 15th\n\nWe will have a Christmas themed Spirit Day on Friday, December 15th. Students are encouraged to wear their favorite red, green, and Christmas attire. Also, we will dismiss at 11:30am on Friday, December 15th as we start Christmas Break.\n\nEncouragement and Prayer:\n\nThe book of Isaiah records a prophecy of the coming Messiah saying, “Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel,” Isaiah 7:14. Immanuel means “God with us”. This simple but profound truth speaks to God’s desire for redemption, reconciliation, and relationship. The creator of the universe loved you and me so much that even in our worst condition, He sent Jesus to us in the form of a baby to be the ultimate sacrifice for our sins (Romans 5:8). We do not serve a distant God who is uninterested in our lives or condition. We serve a God who is present. A God who desires full reconciliation from the separation our sin created (Romans 3:23-24). He loved us enough to provide the solution through His one and only son. That through our belief in Jesus, we can be redeemed and experience eternal life (John 3:16). All of this began with the humble birth we celebrate each December. Jesus was born as Immanuel, God with us.\n\nMy prayer for you is that you will fully experience Immanuel “God with us” this Christmas. I pray God’s presence would protect and provide for your family. I pray His presence would bring peace and reconciliation.\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nThanks,\n\nRandy McMillan\n\nRCS | Head of School\n\nRead More about Things to Know this Week (Dec 8)\n\nRCS Families,\n\nThis week we hosted a team of seven school professionals as part of our ACSI reaccreditation process. Their job this week was to conduct a 360-degree review of our school to determine areas of strength and opportunities for growth. They met with our school board, parents, staff, and students. They reviewed our practices for spiritual formation, academics, relationships, well-being of students & staff, operations & finances, etc. The process was very encouraging both in the reinforcement of our strengths and in identifying areas we should focus our energy on over the coming years. The good news is that the team is fully recommending our reaccreditation to the ACSI Accreditation Commission! We should receive their detailed report in February. This reaccreditation process and report will inform and strengthen our school’s strategic plan for the coming years. We will share more details when we receive their final report.\n\nHere are a few of things to know this week:\n\nAnnual Legacy Fund\n\nWe need your help! Tuition alone is not sufficient to fully fund Renton Christian. This year, our financial aid increased by over $150,000. 164 students currently receive financial assistance this year. Your gift to our Legacy Fund will enable our continued financial support with these students and ensure they continue learning in a Christ-centered environment. Will you give today to help these students? CLICK HERE to give a one-time or reoccurring gift. Thank you for your generosity and investment into the lives of RCS students!\n\nRCS Christmas Concerts | Thur, Dec 14\n\nThis is the season to celebrate the birth of our Savior Jesus Christ. We will have three Christmas concerts this year. Our students have been preparing and practicing for this special concert and we cannot wait to see you there. Each concert will be in the Main Auditorium. Below are the three concert times. Each concert will also be live streamed at: https://rcs.online.church/.\n\nKprep-1st Grade: 8:45am\n\n2nd – 4th Grade: 10:00am\n\n5th – 8th Grade: 7:00pm\n\nSpirit Day & Early Dismissal | Friday, December 15\n\nWe will have a Christmas themed Spirit Day on Friday, December 15th. Students are encouraged to wear their favorite red, green, and Christmas attire. Also, we will dismiss at 11:30am on Friday, December 15th as we start Christmas Break.\n\nReenrollment for 2024 – 2025 School Year\n\nReenrollment for next school year will open for current families January 2nd. New families will be able to apply beginning January 23rd. We have already given tours to prospective new families. We anticipate strong interest in new families desiring to join RCS next fall. We will send you an email on January 2nd with a link to reenroll. Thank you for your continued trust and partnership with Renton Christian.\n\nEncouragement and Prayer:\n\nEvery December, a passage from the book of Isaiah is an encouragement and anchor point for me. In this passage, the prophet Isaiah describes Jesus as the coming Messiah with four powerful characteristics. “For to us a child is born, to us a son is given…And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace” Isaiah 9:6. These four characteristics anchor me during the busyness and chaos of the Christmas season. God is our Wonderful Counselor. We serve a God who wants to hear from us. We can share our celebrations and our cares. He provides perfect counsel that is full of wonder. God is our Mighty God. We serve a God that is more powerful than anything we are or may face. He desires to meet our needs and always be our source of strength (John 15:7). God is our Everlasting Father. Human time does not constrain our God. He is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow (Hebrews 13:8). His infinite context should provide us comfort and perfect context. God is the Prince of Peace. God’s domain is peace. Peace is His territory to rule and to provide. When we need peace, He is faithful to provide it to us (Philippians 4:7).\n\nMy prayer for you is that these four characteristics will encourage and anchor you during this Christmas season. I pray that the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, would guard your heart and mind in Christ Jesus.\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nThanks,\n\nRandy McMillan\n\nRCS | Head of School\n\nRead More about Things to Know this Week (Dec 1)\n\nRCS Families,\n\nAs we embrace the exciting month of December, I am compelled to reflect upon the true meaning of Christmas, a celebration that extends far beyond the twinkling lights, glittering decorations, and the exchange of gifts. At the core of this joyful season lies the profound truth of the birth of Jesus—His birth speaks of hope, love, and the promise of salvation.\n\nI encourage each of our families to take a moment amidst the hustle and bustle of the holiday season to impart the invaluable lessons of the birth of Jesus to our children. Let us spend quality time together, sharing the significance of Jesus' birth and reflecting on the timeless values of compassion, kindness, and selflessness.\n\nIn the spirit of embracing the true meaning of Christmas, I invite you to incorporate meaningful traditions into your family celebrations. Open the Bible together, read and reflect upon passages that highlight the essence of this blessed season. One such verse is Isaiah 9:6: \"For to us, a child is born, to us, a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.\" Moreover, let us take joy in the simple moments of the season. Spend time as a family marveling at the beauty of Christmas lights, enjoy heartwarming Christmas movies, and create cherished memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nI am incredibly proud of the generosity our students displayed last month during our food drive for the Salvation Army and the enthusiasm they exhibited in preparing boxes for Operation Christmas Child. Their actions of serving others truly embody the spirit of giving and compassion, making a meaningful impact on those in need within our community and beyond.\n\nOur recent Christmas tree lighting ceremony was a testament to the strong sense of community that thrives within our school. It was heartening to witness families coming together to celebrate, share laughter, and create lasting connections. The warmth and camaraderie surrounding the event truly captured the essence of the holiday season.\n\nAs we approach the culmination of the year, let us remember that we are not just a school; we are a community, a family. May this Christmas season bring you moments of joy, love, and togetherness. Wishing each and every one of you a Merry Christmas filled with blessings and the boundless joy that comes from the true meaning of the season.\n\nAlways in your corner,\n\nMrs. Hopp\n\nRead More about THE PRINCIPAL'S CORNER\n\nPlease join us on December 14th for The Light of Christmas in the Main Auditorium.\n\nKprep - 1st Grade @ 8:45am\n\n2nd - 4th Grade @ 10am\n\n5th - 8th Grade@ 7pm\n\nRead More about RCS Christmas Concerts\n\nRCS Families,\n\nI began last week in Phoenix at a conference with over 400 Christian school leaders from across America. Mrs. Hopp, Mrs. Barnes and I went down a day early to tour three incredible Christian schools in the Phoenix area to inspire and inform our plans for the RCS High School. We learned a lot and were inspired by specific ideas and opportunities. I love learning from other schools. With that said, I am humbled by what God is doing through Renton Christian. We are experiencing something special. I would not trade our teachers or staff for those at other schools. We have an incredible partnership with parents. I would not trade our parents for those at other schools. I am so excited about the future of RCS and the doors God continues to open for us. Thank you for your encouragement and partnership to make RCS the school God desires it to be!\n\nHere are a few of things to know this week:\n\nRCS Cares | OCC and Food Drive Results\n\nThank you for partnering with us to instill a spirit of serving in our students! Over the past two weeks we have been overwhelmed by the generosity of our families. Here is what we were able to do together:\n\nOperation Christmas Child – we received 492 boxes for Operation Christmas Child. We will help 492 children around the world receive a Christmas gift and the message of Jesus on Christmas this year!\n\nFood Drive – We received 4,485 food items for the Renton Salvation Army Food Bank. This food was picked up today and will provide much needed shelf-stable food for families in need during this Thanksgiving and Christmas season. We loaded up all the food this morning in a truck from the food bank. The truck was packed! The food bank was overwhelmed with the generosity of our families. Thank you for helping us serve our neighbors across the street and around the world!\n\nFirst Annual RCS Christmas Tree Lighting Event | Mon, Nov 27th at 6:30pm\n\nTo start the Christmas season, RCS invites you to join us for a time of Christmas carols, Christmas cocoa and our first ever Christmas Tree Lighting. We are transforming an evergreen tree near the entrance into our Christmas tree! We can’t wait to see you on Monday, November 27th at 6:30pm for this 30–45-minute Christmas experience!\n\nACSI Accreditation Visit | Nov 26-29\n\nTo ensure RCS operates with best practices, we are accredited with the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI). Every 6 years, our school goes through a reaccreditation process involving an exhaustive self-study and a visit from a team of current school administrators to observe our school and confirm the findings of our internal study. Our team completed a self-study toward the end of last school year. The visiting ACSI team will be onsite on November 26th – 29th. This team will highlight areas of strength and collaboratively identify opportunities to strengthen our school. We are looking forward to this visit to help us strengthen our practices and become a better school. This reaccreditation process will inform and strengthen our school’s strategic plan for the coming years.\n\nNo School | November 20 – 24 | Teacher Professional Development and Thanksgiving Break\n\nThere will be no classes next week, November 20 – 24 for our Teacher Professional Development and Thanksgiving break. We pray for safe travel for those heading out of the area and for all to have an enjoyable time with family and friends. BASC and SLC will be open until 4pm on November 22nd and both will be closed November 23rd and 24th.\n\nEncouragement and Prayer:\n\nNext week is Thanksgiving. This is a natural opportunity for us to reflect on the people and provision we enjoy every day. However, thanksgiving is a Christian virtue that each of us need to exercise throughout the year. Here are a few versus that help illustrate the breadth of this virtue:\n\nWorship – We should come before God “with thanksgiving” (Psalm 95:2, Psalm 100:4) and our praise should be infused with thanksgiving (Psalm 69:30).\n\nSalvation – Thanksgiving is a natural outflow of the grace we receive through salvation in Christ (2 Corinthians 4:15).\n\nPrayer – Our posture when making requests from God should include thanksgiving (Philippians 4:6)\n\nFaith in Christ – thankfulness illustrates part of a fully devoted relationship with Jesus Christ (Colossians 2:6-7)\n\nResponse to God’s Love – we should express thankfulness to God for His goodness and enduring love (1 Chronicles 16:34, Psalm 106:1)\n\nProvisions – Jesus frequently expressed thanks for God-given provisions (Luke 9:16, Luke 22:19).\n\nAll Circumstances – The Apostle Paul instructed us to “give thanks in all circumstances” (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18).\n\nPeople – The Apostle Paul modeled this thankfulness for people by expressing his thanks to the people to who he wrote (Philippians 1:3-6).\n\nThanksgiving properly postures us before God and toward the people around us. Thanksgiving forces us to look outward rather than inward. Thanksgiving prompts us to pause and ponder. Thanksgiving is an antidote to pride, and it fosters humility. Every breath, every moment, every day is a gift from God. Let’s live in a constant posture of thankfulness.\n\nI am thankful for you and your partnership. I am thankful for the passionate and committed teachers and team at RCS. I am thankful for each student. I pray God bless you with moments of rest over Thanksgiving Break. I pray He would bring to mind the endless reasons to be thankful and help each of us exhibit thankfulness in every circumstance.\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nThanks,\n\nRandy McMillan\n\nRCS | Head of School\n\nRead More about Things to Know this Week (Nov 17)\n\nSchool News\n\nRCS Cares | 2 Weeks, 2 Ways\n\nNovember is a month we love to take the opportunity to give and put into practice our value of serving the community!

I see it in the stories of student’s committing their lives to Christ. I see it in the smiles on every student. I see it in the doors God is opening for RCS to expand our capacity. I see it through encouraging thoughts and emails from parents. Let’s not take for granted God provision, protection, and guidance. Thank you for partnering with us to develop the lives of every student in our care. I appreciate your trust, your prayers, and your encouragement.\n\nHere are a few of things to know this week:\n\nRCS Cares | November 6th – 17th\n\nOur prayer is that every student at RCS learns to be missionally minded, thinking beyond themselves. We want to cultivate compassionate students whose heart breaks for the things that break the heart of God. In November, we have two opportunities for the RCS community to serve:\n\nFood Drive: We will be receiving non-perishable food for the Renton Salvation Army Food Bank. There will be boxes outside each classroom to receive food beginning Monday, November 6th.\n\nOperation Christmas Child: We want to provide a Christmas gift to 500 children in need across the world. Special Operation Christmas Child boxes will be available in each class beginning Monday, November 6th.\n\nAdditional details for both opportunities was sent by Mrs. Turner in an email on Monday (Oct 30th).\n\nRCS Fall Book Fair | Next Week: Nov 6th – 9th | 8am – 5pm\n\nNext week is our fall book fair with I:55.

Stop by the RCS Library anytime between 8am to 5pm to pick up some great books. Each class will also have an opportunity to visit the book fair during the school day next week. The book fair will accept cash or cards.\n\nNo School | Friday, Nov 10 | Veterans Day Observed\n\nRCS, BASC and SLC will be closed on Friday, November 10 in observance of Veterans Day. We appreciate the service and sacrifice of veterans who protected the freedoms we enjoy each day.\n\nRCS Spirit Day | Apple Cup Attire | November 17\n\nSupport your favorite team in the Apple Cup on November 18th for spirit day! Students can wear University of Washington or Washington State University gear for our Apple Cup themed spirit day. Students not participating in spirit day should wear standard RCS uniform attire.\n\nEncouragement and Prayer:\n\nHow do you stay centered in the midst of uncertainty? You never know what you will see when you open social media or look at the news. For many, emotions of fear, anxiety, anger, or sadness can be invoked by each post or story. The flow of information that invokes these emotions is not new, however, the constant access to it is a modern feature of our always connected culture. It is all too easy to get sucked into the endless feed of the newest update, the latest crisis, or the next reason to be divided.\n\nWe were not designed to live in a constant state of mental stimulation. The Bible teaches several practices that will help us return to our God-given design:\n\nRemain in Christ – Jesus said, “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing” John 15:5. We are designed to be fruitful, not out of our own strength or abilities but because through the nourishment of being connected to Jesus.\n\nSeek Solitude - During a busy season of ministry, Jesus found a quite place. “Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed” Mark 1:35. When are you intentionally in a quiet place, without distraction, where you can seek and hear from God? For me, it is 5am before everyone in my house wakes up. I read two chapters in the Bible BEFORE I turn on my cellphone.\n\nTrust God to Provide – Jesus promised that as we seek God and His righteousness, God would provide our needs (Matthew 6:25-34). Sometimes we focus so much on our own self-reliance that we forget God is the true source of our provision.\n\nFind Rest in Jesus – Jesus said, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls,” Matthew 11:28-29. We can find rest, not through binge watching Netflix or an extra nap, instead, true soul level rest comes through Jesus.\n\nTrade Anxiety for Peace – “Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus,” Philippians 4:6-7. God can handle your questions and emotions. Give him your anxiety and He will trade it for an amazing peace the will protect your thoughts and emotions.\n\nMy prayer for you comes from the famous Serenity Prayer, “God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.” So many things are out of our control. However, we can find firm footing for our soul in the promises and practices of Christ. I pray that God would give you peace in the middle of uncertainty today!\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nThanks,\n\nRandy McMillan\n\nRCS | Head of School\n\nRead More about Things to Know this Week (Nov 3)\n\nAs we enter the beautiful month of November, we are reminded of the importance of gratitude and the numerous reasons we have to be thankful. The autumn leaves fall, and we gather together in our loving community to reflect on the blessings that God has bestowed upon us.\n\nThanksgiving: A Time for Reflection\n\nThis season, we encourage Renton Christian students, parents, and staff to take a moment to reflect on the many reasons we can be thankful. It's not only about the grand and extraordinary events but also the everyday blessings that often go unnoticed. Let's remember:\n\nGod's Grace: We are incredibly blessed to be part of the Renton Christian community that allows us to celebrate God's grace and love every day.\n\nRCS Students: Our students are at the heart of everything we do. Their growth, potential, and enthusiasm for learning remind us daily of God's wonderful creation.\n\nDedicated Staff: We are grateful for our dedicated RCS teachers, staff, and volunteers who work tirelessly to provide a nurturing and faith-filled educational environment.\n\nSupportive Parents: Our parents play a vital role in our school's success. Your involvement and partnership are invaluable.\n\nSafe Environment: We are fortunate to have a safe and nurturing school where students can grow academically, socially, and spiritually.\n\nCommunity: Our school community is a source of strength, support, and friendship. Together, we are a family that stands strong in faith.\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nWe have some exciting events lined up for the month of November, including:\n\n• Veterans Day Chapels: November 2, 2023\n\n• Book Fair: November 6-9, 2023\n\n• Veterans Day observed (no school) November 10, 2023\n\n• Spirit Day Apple Cup Wear: November 17, 2023\n\nPlease make sure to mark your calendars.\n\nGet Involved\n\nThis month let's make a collective effort to spread the spirit of gratitude. Encourage your children to express thankfulness in their daily lives, whether through prayers, acts of kindness, or gratitude journals. We are launching our RCS Cares campaign where students will be able to help those less fortunate in a tangible way.\n\nWe are also collecting non-perishable food items for the Salvation Army beginning November 6th in each classroom to support those in need this Thanksgiving. We are also partnering with Operation Christmas Child to gift 500 children in need across the world. Your contributions are greatly appreciated.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nAs we journey through November, let us be mindful of our blessings and give thanks for the many gifts we have received. Together, as a Christian community, we can make this world a brighter place through love, faith, and gratitude.\n\nMay God's grace continue to guide and bless us all.\n\nAlways in your corner,\n\nMrs. Hopp\n\nRead More about THE PRINCIPAL'S CORNER\n\nRCS Families,\n\nI am humbled by what God is doing in and through Renton Christian this year! Last week 150 of our 7th & 8th grade students, staff, and parents spent three days at Black Diamond Camp for their fall retreat. God moved powerfully in the hearts of our students. 29 students made Jesus their Lord and Savior! Another 13 students felt called to consider full-time ministry as their future career! These unhurried moments at the altar will be foundational in their spiritual formation. We pray the seed planted and watered in their lives will come to fruition and produce amazing fruit for the Mission of God.\n\nHere are a couple of things to know this week:\n\nMove-A-Thon & Color Run Update (Our new bus arrived today!)\n\nThank you for all your help and partnership with our fall fundraiser! Together, we raised over $170,000! This year we raised money for a second new school bus and some campus security projects. I’m excited to announce our second new school bus arrived today! This will help eliminate our need to rent school buses for most field trips and prepare us for transportation between campuses when we add our future high school location. The first campus security project will strengthen and improve the security at our school office entrance. This improvement should be complete during Christmas break or mid-winter break depending on supply availability.\n\nVeterans Day Chapel | Thursday, November 2\n\nNext week, we will have our annual Veterans Day Chapels. Every year we invite all veterans of RCS students to join us. We will honor and celebrate their meaningful service and sacrifice to protect the freedoms we enjoy every day. As always, all parents are welcome to come. Please take note of the chapel times for your student’s chapel: 4th – 8th grade @ 8:45am, Kprep – 3rd grade @ 10:30am. There will be a reception for all veterans at 9:30am between these two chapels. If you or a family member is unable to join us in person, we will live stream both chapels at: https://rcs.online.church/.\n\nRCS Cares | November 6th – 17th\n\nOur prayer is that every student at RCS learns to be missionally minded, thinking beyond themselves. We want to cultivate compassionate students whose heart breaks for the things that break the heart of God. In November, we have two opportunities for the RCS community to serve:\n\nFood Drive: We will be receiving non-perishable food for the Renton Salvation Army Food Bank.\n\nOperation Christmas Child: We want to provide a Christmas gift to 500 children in need across the world.\n\nDetails for both opportunities will be sent early next week. Thank you for helping us train a generation of students to tangibly express the love of Christ.\n\nRCS High School Update\n\nWe continue to conduct feasibility, design, and entitlement work on the RCS High School property. We are working diligently toward a pre-application meeting with the City of Covington in January or February 2024. This week an arborist is documenting and assessing each of the over 1,500 trees on the property to help us confirm the buildable area and inform the site design. We are making steady and diligent progress!

Thank you for partnering with us! We are still looking for several parents to serve in November for our Book Fair and Veterans Day Chapel, and upcoming Christmas concerts in December. Please look at our upcoming serving needs at: www.rentonchristian.org/serve.\n\nFollow RCS on Instagram\n\nThere are some great pictures and videos on our social media accounts of our Harvest Day today and students turning me into an ice cream sundae yesterday. The best way to stay up-to-date with Renton Christian is on Instagram @rentonchristian.

You can also join us on Facebook as well.\n\nEncouragement and Prayer:\n\nAs the leaves fall and temperature drops a sign of a new season is upon us. Each season has different rhythms, characteristics, and traditions. If you are like me, there are some seasons you prefer over others. There are some seasons you look forward to and others you endure. Like the seasons of nature, we experience different seasons as an individual, family, and organization. Some seasons are filled with joy and celebration, others with anxiety, loss, and pain. Regardless of how you would describe the season you are currently in, here are a few things to consider:\n\nWe Need Each Other – in the Bible we are called to carry each other’s burdens, to rejoice with those who rejoice and mourn with those who mourn, to encourage one another and build each other up. We need to be close enough with others to care for them and humble enough to receive care from them.\n\nEnjoy Every Day – each day is a gift from God and is not promised. James says our life is like a mist, here today and gone tomorrow. God’s compassions and mercies are new every morning. Be present and enjoy each moment.\n\nDon’t Worry – we are not designed to constantly live in stress or anxiety. Jesus cares for us and we need to cast all our anxiety on Him. Jesus taught us to not worry and to consider how much God provides for the birds in the air and how much more he cares about us. Instead, Jesus can be our source of a peace that will guard our hearts and minds.\n\nSeason’s Don’t Last – seasons come, and seasons go. King Solomon said there is a time for everything and every season. If the season you are in is the best ever, savor it. If the season is the worst ever, remember, it will not last forever. Better days are ahead.\n\nThink Correctly – we are flooded with information daily. Most of it stirs up uncertainty, division, or fear. Instead of staying connected to things that drain us, we should instead think about things that fuel us. The Apostle Paul gave us some thinking filters, teaching us to seek that which is noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, excellent, and praiseworthy. Let’s fill our minds with the right things.\n\nI pray that regardless the season you find yourself in you would find comfort and strength in Christ. I pray “The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make His face shine on you and be gracious to you; the Lord turn His face toward you and give you peace” Numbers 6:24-26.\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nThanks,\n\nRandy McMillan\n\nRCS | Head of School\n\nRead More about Things to Know this Week (Oct 27)\n\nRCS Student had an amazing time at our annual Harvest Day event!
