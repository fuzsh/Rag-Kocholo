        "text": "Cambridge Christian School was founded in 1964. For almost 60 years, the school’s mission is to provide excellence in academics, athletics and fine arts for the good of our students and the glory of God. We desire to reflect the excellence of Christ in all things. Our goal is to offer an education second to none, and to do it all through the lens of a Biblical worldview. Our curriculum and methods will be current, and students receive a 21st Century education that prepares them for a digital and global economy and directs them to pursue their God-ordained place in it.\n\nCCS is blessed with incredibly gifted and passionate teachers and administration who model a godly life for our students, love our students, and desire to know our students beyond the classroom. We value relationships. At CCS, you will encounter an environment where rigorous academics and high achievement are valued, but where a balance is created by intentional relationships between staff, parents and students.\n\nStaff & Students\n\nSchool Head\n\nAnthony Charles Baron\n\nJennifer Montgomery Elling\n\nSarah Angrisani\n\nShannon Fisher Schrope\n\nFull-time Faculty & Administration\n\n95\n\nPart-time Faculty & Administration\n\n16\n\nSupport Staff\n\n62\n\n782 90\n\nEnrollment\n\nFull-Day Early Childhood 21\n\nK3-K4 69\n\nK5 66\n\nGrades 1-5 281\n\nGrades 6-8 213\n\nGrades 9-12 222\n\nEnrollment totals include\n\nthese special programs:\n\nFla Corporate Tax Students 184\n\nChrist Church Academy currently serves students from age two through third grade. We are building a state-of-the-art elementary school that features a STEAM lab, a black box theater, a large indoor cafeteria, athletic field, and modern classrooms furnished with reading nooks. For extracurriculars, we plan to open a martial arts club, play soccer and flag football, have STEM clubs such as young engineers and coding, teach piano and guitar, and have school plays and musicals. We will be going up to Grade 8.\n\nMISSION STATEMENT\n\nChrist Church Academy seeks to educate students to become champions of truth living transformed lives.\n\nVISION STATEMENT\n\nAs a private, Christian lower elementary school, Christ Church Academy will enact and further the mission of Christ Church Vero Beach to make disciples who follow Jesus Christ and serve our community.\n\nCORE VALUES\n\n• Christ Church Academy recognizes the value and worth of each student as a child of God. We encourage our students to be mindful of God’s presence in their lives as they grow and become independent learners who develop a lifelong love of learning.\n\n• We teach each student how to integrate and apply Biblical values to all areas of study and life.\n\n• Rather than facilitate mere content transfer, we develop academic and social skills through exploration, problem solving, and creativity. Our curriculum is guided by the Florida State Standards, attends to the whole child, and includes spiritual development, social/emotional development, cognitive development, and physical development.\n\n• We are committed to providing a strong, comprehensive academic structure for reading, writing, mathematics, and science that incorporates creativity, critical thinking, technology, and community into the core of our lessons and activities.\n\n• We value the role of families in the education of the whole child and seek to foster ways to include and extend support to the parents and guardians as an extension of our CCA Family.\n\nStaff & Students\n\nSchool Head\n\nAnthony Charles Baron\n\nJennifer Montgomery Elling\n\nSarah Angrisani\n\nShannon Fisher Schrope\n\nFull-time Faculty & Administration\n\n11\n\nPart-time Faculty & Administration\n\n4\n\n19 79\n\nEnrollment\n\nPart-Day Early Childhood 47\n\nFull-Day Early Childhood 11\n\nK3-K4 21\n\nK5 4\n\nGrades 1-5 15\n\nDunnellon Christian Academy is a private, non-profit Christian school founded in 1983 as a ministry of First Baptist Church of Dunnellon. DCA is a rural school located in western Marion county surrounded by working farm communities and local rivers.\n\nThere are 173 students—infants through eighth grade. DCA desires every student to develop their spirit-led ability to think in a Christ-like manner and to demonstrate a lifestyle that is saturated with a biblical worldview. DCA’s goal is to encourage the students to be fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ. The curriculum provides a Christian education founded on the principles of Scripture.\n\nThese principles are integrated in each subject throughout every class and by all instructors. DCA has a weekly Chapel service for all students and structured Bible courses in all grade levels. In addition to core academic classes and daily physical education for all grades, DCA incorporates STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematic) and Fine Arts as important tools in our educational plan. Each classroom is equipped with up-to-date educational technology such as J-Touch Interactive boards; and students beginning in the 3rd grade are issued personal tablets for use in all classes. Biblically integrating technology into lessons allows our students to learn to use these tools responsibly.\n\nStudent Government and First Priority provide leadership training to our students that is based on the biblical concepts of stewardship and servant leadership and offer a wide range of opportunities for students to minister on campus or in the community. DCA offers an expanding sports program with soccer, flag football, volleyball, basketball and track for students in 4th through 8th grades. There are sports clubs for the younger grades. All programs, including fine arts and sports, are designed for students to have the opportunity to spread God’s Word.\n\nDCA has a positive working relationship with First Baptist Church Dunnellon. The Pastor, church staff and church body support the purpose, mission and vision of the Academy. Our overall goal is to never lose sight of our purpose for having our doors open; to teach every student about the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. Students are encouraged not to just conform but to transform.\n\nStaff & Students\n\nSchool Head\n\nAnthony Charles Baron\n\nJennifer Montgomery Elling\n\nSarah Angrisani\n\nShannon Fisher Schrope\n\nFull-time Faculty & Administration\n\n17\n\nPart-time Faculty & Administration\n\n4\n\nSupport Staff\n\n8\n\n182 28\n\nEnrollment\n\nPart-Day Early Childhood 6\n\nK3-K4 22\n\nK5 22\n\nGrades 1-5 104\n\nGrades 6-8 56\n\nEnrollment totals include\n\nthese special programs:\n\nVPK Students 18\n\nFla Corporate Tax Students 120\n\nGranada Day School is a Christ-centered school offering child care for infants through kindergarten since 1959. The center is opened from 7–6pm, Monday–Friday. Our curriculum focuses on age-appropriate goals and methods which best enhance your child’s physical, spiritual, emotional and intellectual growth. GDS offers music, art, computers and library, before- and after-school care. Our after-school program provides your child with activities to choose from such as ballet, piano, football, soccer, and languages.\n\nWe distinguish ourselves in creating a unique learning environment that caters to the multicultural families of our community here in South Florida. Our school is an extension of the students’ home, a place where students are provided a safe learning environment. It is important to us that the children cherish their school, that school be a familiar place, a home away from home, and that we be part of creating memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nOur highly certified staff views education as a partnership between parents and teachers. We believe it is essential to develop a good rapport with each child and parent based on open communication and mutual respect. We believe this is the foundation of a successful school experience.\n\nStaff & Students\n\nSchool Head\n\nAnthony Charles Baron\n\nJennifer Montgomery Elling\n\nSarah Angrisani\n\nShannon Fisher Schrope\n\nFull-time Faculty & Administration\n\n35\n\nPart-time Faculty & Administration\n\n4\n\nSupport Staff\n\n4\n\n6 171\n\nEnrollment\n\nPart-Day Early Childhood 45\n\nFull-Day Early Childhood 80\n\nK3-K4 46\n\nK5 6\n\nEnrollment totals include\n\nthese special programs:\n\nVPK Students 46\n\nWhile some may perceive that a private Christian school is a proverbial bubble isolating students from the “real world,” ICA takes seriously the biblical charge to “take captive every thought, to make it obedient to Christ,” and we share the philosophy with C.S. Lewis, that it is better to “irrigate the deserts” by training students to be discerning and shrewd in their dealings with the world. It is the same training method that Jesus used with His own disciples.\n\nJesus sent out His twelve into the world with this statement:\n\n“I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore, be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.”\n\n—Matthew 10:16\n\nThe Christian community has focused on the second part of that charge — teaching our students to be as innocent as doves — to avoid being stained by the world. In the past, the first part of this charge has been overlooked, much to the detriment of students. Study after study confirms that Christian students are walking away from their faith as they leave the comforts and confines of home, and enter into the “brave new world” on the college campus.\n\nAt least 75 percent (some say as high as 90 percent) of students are ill-equipped for the challenges to their faith they will encounter from friends, professors and the world at-large.\n\nLike the famous Dylan Thomas poem, we prepare students not to go gently into that good night — and to do that we have developed a myriad of opportunities that produce conflict, stimulate critical thinking, and equip students and their families to demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God (2 Cor. 10:5). As Isaac Ambrose once wrote, “… you have arduous work allotted to you, and you have neither time nor talent to throw away.”\n\nAt ICA, we take this charge seriously to prepare and equip our students for the challenges and opportunities that await them. This intentional effort is what makes Impact Christian Academy “DISTINCTIVE”.\n\nThroughout our website you will find information as to what really makes ICA “distinctive.” From our mission statement to ministry opportunities, we hope that you will spend some time and see that ICA is serious about being more than just a haven from a world system that stands in opposition to biblical truth — we are also a training facility, a springboard, and a resource to help raise up a new generation of godly young men and women, while strengthening families on their journey. In the classic C.S. Lewis tale, “The Last Battle,” Lord Digory responds to Lucy’s impression that everything seemed so “different” than before. His response was, “And of course it is different; as different as a real thing is from a shadow or as waking life is from a dream.”\n\nThe differences at ICA are intentional and profound — and we hope you find that they are exactly what you are looking for in an educational environment to help you train up your children in the way they should go!\n\nStaff & Students\n\nSchool Head\n\nAnthony Charles Baron\n\nJennifer Montgomery Elling\n\nSarah Angrisani\n\nShannon Fisher Schrope\n\nFull-time Faculty & Administration\n\n27\n\nPart-time Faculty & Administration\n\n3\n\nSupport Staff\n\n11\n\n303 21\n\nEnrollment\n\nPart-Day Early Childhood 12\n\nK3-K4 9\n\nK5 16\n\nGrades 1-5 71\n\nGrades 6-8 82\n\nGrades 9-12 134\n\nEnrollment totals include\n\nthese special programs:\n\nVPK Students 16\n\nFla Corporate Tax Students 116\n\nOrangewood Christian School is located in Maitland, Florida (just north of Orlando) and is a ministry of Orangewood Presbyterian Church (PCA) with nearly 900 students in grades K4–12.\n\nOCS is a Christian college preparatory school offering the highest level of academic achievement.

Serving together in partnership with our parents, we are committed to the education, care, and guidance of our students.

Students will be taught from a distinctively Christian perspective through individualized instruction and according to measurable learning outcomes.\n\nExperiences are provided that meet each child’s needs and stimulate learning in all developmental areas including physical, social, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual.\n\nEach child is viewed as a unique person with an individual pattern and timing of growth and development. Different levels of ability, development, and learning styles are expected, accepted, and used to design appropriate activities.\n\nInteractions and activities are designed to develop children’s positive feelings toward learning.\n\nChristian World-and-Life View\n\nEvery school is based upon a specifice system of beliefs, whether it is governed and guided by the government, a private board, or a church. Sunlight Christian Academy is no exception. Our basis is a distinctively Christian understanding of God and His world, which gives shape to the purpose of our school.\n\nA Comprehensive Learning Plan\n\nOur curriculum has been designed with our unique purpose as a Christian school in mind. It is a comprehensive learning plan with clearly stated learning outcomes and objectives in every academic area (Mathematics, Language Arts, Bible, Fine Arts, Technology, etc.). These clearly stated objectives equip our faculty to provide outstanding instruction and enable us to accurately measure student achievement throughout the school year.\n\nDriven by Learning Outcomes and Objectives\n\nIt is difficult to hit a target that is poorly defined. Because many schools have not developed clearly stated learning outcomes and objectives, they resort to instruction that amounts to marching through a textbook. When this happens, the educational result can only be as good as the textbook is good. At Sunlight Christian Academy, we care much more about whether our students have mastered the learning objectives and goals than whether we have been able to finish any particular textbook. Our teachers appeal creatively to many different learning styles in their instruction.\n\nIndividualized Instruction\n\nEvery child at Sunlight Christian Academy is a unique and important bearer of God’s image. For this reason, we refuse to allow even one to simply blend into the crowd. That is why we maintain an individual academic profile for every child that charts his/her learning in each area of our curriculum. Our flexible weekly schedule also reflects our commitment to individualized instruction.\n\nAccountability through Assessment\n\nAccountability is the buzzword in education today. We embrace this value in everything we do. The education of your child is important, and we want to make sure they are striving to meet our learning outcomes and objectives. With our system of assessment you will know for certain how well your child is meeting the learning objectives.\n\nExcellent Faculty\n\nOur classroom teachers are of an excellent caliber. They are well-trained educational professionals that are properly credentialed.\n\nCampuses\n\nSunlight St. Lucie West Campus, Lower School, PK-5th\n\n477 SW Cashmere Blvd, Port St. Lucie, FL 34986\n\nPhone: (772) 446-7363\n\nSunlight Lake Worth Campus, Preschool\n\n1325 N.

Think again! Let us show you how you can make the right choice for your student. Tampa Bay Christian Academy serves a diverse PK2 through 12th grade student population.\n\nHistory\n\nWe began as Spencer Memorial Baptist School, founded 1957 by a group of Spencer Memorial Baptist Church members interested in providing a Christian education for their children. The names of the church and school were changed in March 1985 to Tampa Baptist Church and Academy.\n\nThe high school was started in the fall of 1986 with a 10th grade, adding a class each year until the first official senior class of thirteen students was established in the 1988–1989 school year.\n\nOn June 1, 2007, the name of the school was changed to Tampa Bay Christian Academy to better communicate its mission and the diversity of its students. In May 2013, Tampa Bay Christian Academy of Florida, Inc. was incorporated with the state of Florida as an independent organization and we moved to our current location at the corner of N. Rome and Sligh in Tampa’s historic Seminole Heights neighborhood.\n\nPreschool, The Early Academy\n\nOur Preschool is designed to give your son or daughter a joyful introduction to attending school in a safe and caring environment. We utilize the Creative Curriculum for Preschool — a comprehensive, research-based curriculum that features hands-on, project-based investigations as a pathway to learning.\n\nWe hope to inspire in children a love of learning as you help them develop confidence, creativity, and critical-thinking skills — all while promoting positive outcomes.\n\nThe K–8 Academy\n\nWe desire to encourage your child to a lifelong love of learning. We’ve taken the elementary school concept and added an extra step, creating a Lower School that serves students from K–8th grade. We keep our middle school students in our Lower School to strengthen their academic, character, and spiritual values, while still allowing them to join, where appropriate, with our high school in athletics, more rigorous academics, and personal mentorship from caring young adult leaders.\n\nOur K–8 program covers all of the core subjects: English/language arts, math, science, and social studies. Students also participate in PE, the Arts, and Bible classes, while our middle school students will begin formal classes in logic to prepare them for high school. Class sizes are smaller than they would be at other schools, so your child need never worry about not receiving extra help.\n\nHigh School, The Leadership Academy\n\nThe Leadership Academy exists to prepare our high school students for their “next step” in life, be it college, the military, vocational training, or a career. This preparation takes the form of character development, discipline, and the ability to take responsibility. Our leadership focus empowers students to learn to lead themselves and others. They will learn critical thinking, communication, ethical decision-making, worldview-discernment, and personal and social responsibility, all of which give them the skills to lead themselves and prepare them to take on meaningful leadership in our community.\n\nIn addition to the core subjects, our high school classes involve the Bible, the arts, foreign language, and a number of electives. We offer everything students need to take their next step in life, whether that be to gain admission to college, find a vocational skill, join the military, or simply explore their interests. These are supplemented by a number of activities and organizations including athletics, various honor societies, student government, and extracurricular clubs.\n\nOur dual enrollment courses enable students and their parents to save money while getting a head start. These courses are held at or by USF and HCC, with some being held online and others at their respective campuses. Students earn college credit while still in high school without having to pay tuition. This means they have smaller course loads in college, leading to less stress and lower costs.\n\nEnrollment\n\nAs an I-20 school we are honored to serve international students from across the world who are looking for a Christian education in the USA. We also accept Step Up For Students and McKay Scholarships and provide numerous financial aid options.\n\nCampuses\n\nMain Campus\n\n6815 North Rome Avenue, Tampa, FL 33604\n\nPhone: (813) 343-0600\n\nSligh Campus\n\n1602 W.
