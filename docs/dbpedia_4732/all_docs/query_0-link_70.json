        "text": "Are you considering attending a missions college but don’t know where to start? Unlike many professions, the path to becoming a missionary is not a clear one. It can be difficult to discern your calling, know where to go, what to do, or where to get the training you need to be effective.\n\nThat’s why we wanted to document in this article the top missions schools you should consider and how to evaluate them to make it easier. But first…\n\nWhat is a missions college? A missions college is a higher education institution with a strong emphasis on Christian missions and a program(s) dedicated to training Christian missionaries.\n\nThere are quite a few of them to consider below, so we thought we would start with a list of how to evaluate them.\n\nWhat to Consider In a Missions College:\n\nHere’s a list of practical things to take into account for finding a missions school best suitable for you.\n\n1. Beliefs of the University\n\nDo all of the beliefs the university align with scripture? It’s important to take this into consideration because we must make sure the words we are taking to a cross-cultural context and sharing with people who don’t know the Bible actually align with its teachings. It’s important to look over the universities beliefs before applying—which are most times located under their “about” section on their website—and make sure they line up with scripture.\n\n2. Cost\n\nBecause missionaries tend to live on either relatively low income or income that is reliant on donations, it is important to go to the field with as little debt as possible to relieve financial burdens. Many missions agencies won’t even accept missionaries if they have too much debt, which is normally considered anything above $30,000. Financial burdens are one of the most detrimental burdens a missionary can face, so when researching potential missions colleges, it’s crucial to spend time researching the cost of the university and take into consideration the number of loans you will need to take out and make sure you will graduate as debt-free as possible.\n\n3. Amount of Discipleship\n\nMatthew 28:19 commands us to “Go and make disciples of all nations.” It is important to consider how much discipleship training the university offers because we must first know and understand what it means to be a disciple before we go and make disciples. Does the university offer opportunities for growth in discipleship such as Bible studies, life groups, outreaches, or classes which are crucial in the Christian life and can better equip you in discipleship? If not, it’s time to start looking at another university.\n\n4. Missions Experience of Faculty\n\nBeing taught about missions by an experienced missionary is a necessity. You wouldn’t want to learn how to perform heart surgery by a mailman, so why would you want to be taught missions by someone who hasn’t experienced life in a cross-cultural context first-hand? Experienced missionaries can better train, teach, and prepare those who are wanting to be a missionary themselves. They’ll have the best stories, advice, and wisdom when it comes to missions.\n\n5. Course Curriculum\n\nFor a student wanting effective training and knowledge in being a missionary, it is a necessity to be in a curriculum that will give you the most beneficial information for a successful life on the mission field. This may include classes such as spiritual warfare, cultural anthropology, worldviews, etc. Most universities list the course curriculum on their website under “academics.” It’s important to take some time and research their course curriculum and whether or not it would be beneficial to you as an aspiring missionary.\n\nNow that we’ve gone over what to consider while searching for the perfect missions university for you, here’s a list of the top 25 missions-minded colleges dedicated to equipping students to a lifetime of cross-cultural service and offer a B.A. or higher in a degree that would be beneficial for a career in missions.\n\nTop 25 Missions Colleges:\n\nThe following list is in alphabetical order.\n\n1. Appalachian Bible College\n\nAppalachian Bible College is located in Mount Hope, West Virginia.
