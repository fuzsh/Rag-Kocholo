        "text": "Class Title: How to use ChatGPT to Brainstorm and Outline your Book in About 10 Minutes\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II/III\n\nGood or bad, ChatGPT is all over the news and authors are wondering if they should use the tool and if so, how. In this workshop authors will learn how to use ChatGPT to brainstorm and outline a book in about 10 minutes using my template. I’ll teach the basics of prompt engineering and show how we can use ChatGPT to output a detailed outline for a genre specific book. Once we’ve seen how it works, we’ll go a bit deeper into prompt engineering (a technique for refining the output) so that authors can create their own templates. We’ll also discuss the ethics of using AI generated content as well as the pitfalls of using ChatGPT to construct your outline.\n\nClass Title: How to use ChatGPT to Develop your Characters\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II\n\nBeyond using ChatGPT for a book outline, I’ll teach how to create real characters with all the elements for Christian Fiction, including the wound, lie, dark moment, and spiritual arc using my template. I’ll teach the basics of character development and show how ChatGPT can output the character we imagined all along. Once we’ve seen how it works, we’ll go a bit deeper into prompt engineering (a technique for refining the output) so that authors can create their own character template and learn how to refine the output based on their own creative ideas. We’ll also discuss the ethics of using AI generated content as well as the pitfalls of using ChatGPT to construct your character.\n\nClass Title: Your Platform is Bigger Than You Think\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II\n\nDo your social media numbers cause angst? Do you feel you will never grow your platform? Cherrilynn understands and wants to help. Join Cherrilynn for tools and a brainstorming session to prove your platform is not just your Social Media numbers.\n\nWhere did you attend college?\n\nDo you belong to any organizations?\n\nWhat’s your church denomination?\n\nWho will endorse your book?\n\nDo you know anyone famous?\n\nDoes a family member or close friend have a large reach?\n\nAre you scheduled to speak?\n\nClass Title: Keep the ME in Memoir\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: Act I/II\n\nSo you want to write your story and don’t know how much to disclosure? Perhaps someone asked you to ghostwrite events from their life and you don’t know where to begin?\n\nCherrilynn will define the difference between a memoir and an autobiography.\n\nShe will explain the basics of crafting a memoir, as she helps you navigate the difficult terrain of exposing names, events, and details of the story. Come to the workshop with ideas and questions. There will be time for brainstorming.\n\nClass Title: Painting Poetry: Using Imagery and Senses to Bring Your Poetry to Life\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II\n\nPoetry should not only be ideas and words on a page. Poetry should use all of our senses to bring our words to life. Just as a painting can bring a tear or a smile, so should our poetry. Just as in writing a fiction novel we are to show, not tell; we should use the same method in writing poetry. Are you having difficulty bringing life to your poetry? Why not use a picture to create an idea. Or start with the five senses to write a simple poem which might trigger a memory or thought to push you through to that perfect poem. In this class we will experiment with both imagery and sensory poetry and try writing our own using these techniques.\n\nClass Title: Poetry Journaling: How using a Poetry Journal can Enhance Your Fiction Writing\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II\n\nAre you having trouble learning to show, not tell, in your fiction novels? Poetry could be just the ticket you need to succeed! You say you don’t write poetry? That’s okay. Poetry journaling is more of a concept than a construct. Write down your favorite poems or try writing your own. Fill your journal with pictures or write random words and see where they take you. In this class we will learn what poetry journaling is, experiment with journaling techniques, and write at least one poem together to get you started. Bring your own journal!\n\nClass Requirements:\n\nBring a journal\n\nClass Title: But I Don’t Write/Like/Read Poetry: How using poetry enhances your fiction writing\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II\n\nWhether you think you can write poetry or not, poetry is a great way to enhance your fiction writing. Because poetry must be condensed and concise with its own powerful imagery to bring it to life, poetry can help get us out of the rut when we’re stuck in a scene. In this class you will take a scene from your WIP and try writing it in the style of a poem. You might even realize you like poetry more than you think!\n\nClass Title: Maximizing Your Manuscript for Significant Impact\n\nClass Type: Workshop Practicum\n\nClass Description: ACT II/III\n\nDo you want to take your book to the next level? Learn how to maximize your manuscript by developing an innovative format that enhances the reader’s impact. Learn how to include meaningful questions, visuals/charts, creative writing prompts, and a leader guide for a book club or study that can help boost your book in multi-faceted ways. We will use a sample book and start with the TOC to create elements that best enhance your book to help the reader walk away with maximum impact.\n\nIn this practicum, you will leave with a template to take your book to the next level and help your book achieve the highest market influence.\n\nClass Title: Story Boarding Your Next Book: Creating a Writer’s Vision Board\n\nClass Type: Continuing Class Practicum\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II/III 2-day CCP\n\nIn this hands-on class, we will demonstrate multiple ways to outline your next project to have a clear vision for your book. Using everything from drawings to paper images, come prepared to create!\n\nIn the first session, we will discuss the importance of having a structure as you write, the key elements, and best practices to begin. The second session will be putting into action a creative project using various tools (i.e., colored pencils, pens, paper, images, etc.) In this practical class, you will walk away with a finished or nearly complete writer's vision board for your next project.\n\nClass Title: Twitter, (“X”) the Mars Hill of Today\n\nClass Type: Workshop Practicum\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II\n\nWould Jesus and the apostle Paul utilize Twitter (X) if they walked the earth today? The apostle Paul went to Mars Hill where the people gathered. He used their discussions to inform him and meet them where they were and present the gospel. Twitter (X) offers a glimpse into cultures’ concerns and needs, a chance to share your message, and build your platform. When we focus on building people, our platform grows. Jesus said to go into the highways and byways and compel them to come in. Let’s use this internet highway to spread the message God gave us. Though this workshop focuses on Twitter’s many features, some concepts apply to other social media platforms.\n\nInstruction includes:\n\n• Set up an effective Twitter (X) handle, display name, and bio that represents your brand\n\n• Some call it opposition; I call it inspiration\n\n• Twitter Chats (participating, leading, and the surprising benefits)\n\n• Hosting interviews on X\n\n• Spaces—X’s new live audio forum\n\n• Repurposing your Twitter (X) content\n\n• When to use Quote Tweet vs. the Reply features\n\n• Other Twitter (X) features, types of accounts, and more\n\nClass Title: Win the War to Write\n\nClass Type: Workshop Practicum\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II\n\nTo win the war to write, we must adapt to God’s way of thinking and combat the devil’s lies with the truth found in God’s word. Often, we view our obstacles as stop signs rather than detours.\n\nWe need to reframe “I can’t” into “how can I?” Sometimes what we see as our weakness holds strength.\n\nIn this class, we’ll go beyond writer’s doubt and its companions, and brainstorm potential solutions to help you write amid adversity and the seasons of life.\n\nClass Title: Writing for the Gift and Devotional Book Markets\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II\n\nHave you ever thought about writing a gift book or a devotional book? Then come to my class where we’ll talk about what you need to know from the time you come up with the idea until the day you see your masterpiece on bookstore shelves and bestseller lists. We’ll cover things like formatting and expanding your book project, finding a publisher, what to expect during the publishing process, and much more. I learned everything the hard way, but after attending my session, you won’t have to do that. (Pausing to adjust my halo.) Please join me so I won’t be sitting in my classroom like a big wallflower!\n\nClass Title: Think Like a Publisher: How To Deliver What They Look For\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: Act II/III\n\nDo I lead with this book or that one? Which one is right for which publisher? An agent’s job is often sorting through a writer’s mental exercise of how to present their best ideas to the publishers who are looking for specific genres and different types of writers. This workshop will help you gain a better understanding of what can help you make decisions about which books to keep in mind for which publishers and how to present, not just your idea but your connection to the book’s message.\n\nClass Title: Amazon Boot Camp\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II/III\n\nAmazon is where books are sold. Nearly 80% of all eBooks are sold on Amazon, and upwards of 40% of paperbacks are sold there as well. But if other online stores feel like barren deserts, sometimes Amazon can feel like attempting to sell in shark-infested waters. But there are tools and tricks available to all authors to improve their visibility on Amazon, and in this course we’ll be discussing some of the very best. We’ll go over the basics of metadata (keywords and categories), price points and price promotions, and the benefits of Amazon exclusivity. Whether you’re a bestseller or a first-time author, this course will give you additional tools to help your book become more discoverable on the world’s largest bookstore.\n\nClass Title: How To Make Money with Self-publishing\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II/III\n\nMost authors would write full time if they had the ability to do so, but few have that option. With bills to pay, mouths to feed, and lifestyles to maintain, most authors don’t have the luxury to leave their day jobs. On top of that, getting a book self-published can also be very expensive and the publishing arena is consistently competitive. So, is there any way to earn an income with your writing?\n\nIn this course, author Vincent Davis will help you develop the proper business practices and foster the correct mindset to begin earning consistent royalties on your books. It’s never easy, with dedication and hard work, you too can begin your path to becoming a full-time author.\n\nClass Title: How to Revive a Dead Book\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II/III\n\nYou published a book. Maybe the launch went well, and you sold a lot of copies. Maybe you even won awards of hit a best seller’s list. However, in the days, weeks, months, and even years since then, the book has fallen into obscurity. That’s what some Amazon experts call the “Amazon Blackhole” the commonplace phenomenon where books are only found by using the exact title or author name, rather than being discovered organically.\n\nBut there is a plethora of ways to give new life to an old book. No matter how long it’s been, or how slow sales are, a book can have new life. There is nothing more valuable to authors than their published titles, but many authors and publishers abandon books that haven’t sold well or have grown stale.\n\nNow, we no longer have too. With the strategies we’ll discuss in this class, you can make your book(s) relevant again, and achieve heights never considered possible previously.\n\nClass Title: Book Launch Myths, and What You Should Do Instead\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II/III\n\nThere are a few things we’re all told we need to do around a launch. Pre-orders, reviews, sales, and best seller’s lists, the list of tips are endless. But many of these common industry tropes are outdated or aren’t grounded in what works with Amazon’s algorithms in the first place.\n\nIn this class, you’ll learn what strategies and tips really work to make your launch as successful as possible and avoid actions that are unhelpful or downright hurtful to your book’s long-term sales success.\n\nClass Title: The 411 on Agents\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II\n\nHow do I know if I need an agent and am I ready to look for one?\n\nIf you're asking yourself these questions, Lynette's class will help you answer them. Join Lynette as she offers insight into what an agent is looking for in a client and how to know if you meet the criteria. There will be time for Q & A as well.\n\nClass Title: Magazine Writing: Breaking In and Staying In\n\nClass Type: Continuing Class\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II/III 3-day CC\n\nIs print dead? No way! But the industry is changing. This continuing class looks at reasons you may want to write for periodicals, which include the 3P’s: profit, platform and portfolio. It’s also a great way to express your passion. (Hey, that’s a fourth P!) We’ll talk about how to capture an editor’s attention, practice crafting an effective lead, learn about different types of periodicals and stories, and discover how good interviewing skills can open doors to big-time periodicals.

A Compilation is a definite way to have your work seen by editors, agents, and publishers while working on your book.\n\nThe industry of Christian writing is competitive. Learning teamwork is resourceful in navigating the publishing world. The experience of compilations is a door to group success that impacts you as an individual writer pursuing traditional authorship.\n\nThis workshop will revive hope in the call to write. As you build an author's resume, you will be empowered to sustain strength and grace on your journey, communicating the Word of God in various publications (devotionals, magazines, and books).\n\n“Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin,” Zec 4:10 NLT\n\nClass Title: Morning Glory\n\nClass Type: Continuing Class Practicum\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II 2-day CCP\n\nValuable tips for creativity and healthy personal well-being begin in the morning.

The writing industry professional consistently needs to expand their networking capabilities and have a way to be mentored strategically. The conference setting presents the perfect collaborative opportunities for writers to do both. The workshop will capitalize on this unique aspect.\n\nThe additional twist to this workshop is that writers will leave with an action plan they may begin using immediately after completing the workshop.\n\nThis action plan will provide the blueprint to find a mentor, improve communication, and expand their platform.\n\nClass Title: Poetry with a Punch\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II/III\n\nDid you know writing poetry improves nonfiction and fiction writing?

In this workshop, we will experience practical, hands-on methods to introduce writers to the basics of how to write poems.\n\nIn this workshop, attendees will learn that poetry is about paying close attention to the language itself and that poems arrive in the form of words, not just ideas.\n\nThe gift of poetry writing can lie dormant in a writer who hasn’t realized it’s there. This workshop will break down the barriers between a poet and a nonpoet and essentially work to become a consistent habit to improve overall writing.\n\nClass Title: Effective Article Writing That Will Get You Published\n\nClass Type: Workshop\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II\n\nIf you want to be taken seriously as a writer and make extra income on the side, then your writing must be excellent, and you MUST follow protocol.\n\nBeyond just understanding submission guidelines, writers must research the audience they plan to write to. They should also research the place or publisher they send a query letter. Last, writers should develop a finished product once an article is approved. People in the publishing industry get hundreds of submissions a day; if a piece isn’t polished, they will find one that is polished.\n\nOne of the hidden secrets of getting professionally published is through online venues and magazines, newspapers, and blogs.\n\nThis workshop will show attendees how to find places for their writing. They will also learn to professionally query, research, and follow through.\n\nClass Title: Interactive Fiction\n\nClass Type: Continuing Class Practicum\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II/III 3-day CCP\n\nDiscover interactive fiction, how to write and create interactive fiction, potential in the market for interactive fiction.\n\nI - What is Interactive Fiction?\n\nOverview – High-level, interactive fiction defined, formats (CYOA, gamebooks, computer-based, mobile, movies), and applications in society (entertainment, education, professional training) – this presentation will focus on DIGITAL interactive fiction.\n\nII - Creating Interactive Fiction\n\nThinking and planning a work of IF – generating ideas that work well for interactive fiction, planning the reader experience, plotting the work before beginning the build.\n\nIII - Publishing Interactive Fiction\n\nWhere and How to Publish IF – self-publish: own website or app, interactive fiction posting communities, Kickstarter - more traditional: approaching IF websites, apps, and games publishers.\n\nQuick Survey of Tools – Twine, Inform 7, ChoiceScript, inklewriter, Stornaway.io, Tales Creator – many others, but introduce the accessible, creator friendly, industry leading, forward-thinking software.\n\nClass Requirements:\n\nTwine Introduction and Basics – installed before presentation – introduce interactive fiction concepts, Twine 2 Editor environment tour, go over Twine 2 common terms.\n\nTwine is open-source\n\nVisit https://twinery.org\n\nTwine is available for free to download or use in a web browser.

How Do I Run My Launch Team?\n\nClass Type: Continuing Class Practicum\n\nClass Description: ACT I/II/III 2-day CCP\n\nYour book is set to publish and you have a date—now what? In this class, I’ll walk you through a timeline of a Launch Team Session. I’ll give you tips to organize the Launch Team to help you get the buzz started for your upcoming book release. I will share not only information on how to run a launch, but we’ll also work together to create some of the documents I use to create and manage a team. Bring your laptop and we’ll walk through setting those up so you’ll know where to find them.\n\nI’ve participated on Launch Teams since 2011 on over 300 teams.
