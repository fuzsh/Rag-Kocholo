Learning about languages and other cultures offers a new perspective, making us more intentional witnesses for Christ. In our department, we equip students to cultivate linguistic and cultural proficiency to appreciate and engage thoughtfully with diverse communities around the world.\n\nOn this page Overview Graduate Outcomes Programs / Features Faculty Contact\n\nProgram Overview\n\nThe world languages department offers majors and minors in French and Spanish. We also provide beginner and intermediate level courses in American Sign Language (ASL) and linguistics as well as Greek and Hebrew courses in collaboration with the biblical and theological studies department.\n\nWe adhere to a rigorous curriculum that fosters critical thinking, effective communication, and a deep understanding specifically of the Hispanic and Francophone worlds. Committed to a Reformed theology, we promote cultural humility and sensitivity by learning from service and authentic language and culture experiences.\n\nOur students are taught to explore with curiosity and generosity the complexity of the fallenness and beauty of different peoples, languages, and cultures. Each semester we offer cultural and linguistic opportunities for language students of all levels to engage with Hispanic and Francophone communities in Chattanooga. Through our program, we prepare our students to be lifelong learners and effective communicators in a diverse and interconnected world."
