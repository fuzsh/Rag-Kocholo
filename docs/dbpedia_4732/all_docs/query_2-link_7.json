It's Jesus.\n\n​\n\n​We want our children to continue their purpose-driven, Jesus-centered education at Blue Ridge Christian School because we believe we have something extra special going on inside these walls. We believe in what God is doing in this place. We see the profound impact it has had on our students. We are asking for you to support us in prayer, in labor, and in finance. We need all of these things, but funding is the thing we find we are lacking the most as we dream about God's plan for BRCS. This night is about having a great time while raising money for our beautiful school. So, let's raise some money, then maybe a roof, barn, hallelujah or something....\n\nSaturday, April 30th 6pm\n\nSingle: $38\n\nCouple: $75\n\nTable of Eight: $300\n\nTickets!Once you submit the RSVP form, you will be directed to the BRCS main site donate page, where you can buy the number of tickets you desire. Please follow the pricing guide provided.\n\n​Auction! There will be a live auction with wonderful items and services sure to please everyone in the family. Be sure to peruse the auction tables beforehand so you can nab the perfect something you have your eye on!\n\n​Sponsorship Opportunities! Do you want to give back? We have some great ways to do that! Visit the sponsor page for more information."
