        "text": "Ridgecrest Summer Camps\n\nLocated in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina\n\nBoys and girls of all ages are looking for two things. They’re looking for adventure. And they’re looking for someone to follow into that adventure. For over 90 summers, Ridgecrest Summer Camps have been a place where campers follow role models into the adventure of following Jesus and stepping outside of what is ordinary and familiar to grow in every way. Our mission of “impacting lives for God’s glory through discipleship and adventure” emphasizes our desire to meet campers where they are and show them what it looks like to follow Jesus through the highs and lows of life’s journey. Our goal is to create a safe environment that fosters friendship, encouragement and the adventure of a lifetime! Located just outside Asheville, North Carolina, our camps are designed for individual attention, maximum fun, and the safety of each child. We facilitate camper growth by offering an overnight Christian camp program that has been around for over 150 combined years. Camp Ridgecrest for Boys and Camp Crestridge for Girls offer numerous activities taught by Christian role models who are highly trained, committed believers with a heart for the Gospel of Jesus Christ and a heart for children."
