        "text": "About Pathways\n\nRocky Mountain College has undergone a transformation while remaining true to its heritage.\n\nOver the years, other Christian colleges have come and gone. Rocky Mountain College has adapted to the realities of a booming city and the presence of other institutions serving the Christian market. It has also recognized the potential for taking Christian education and Biblical training \"outside the box\" to extend the reach and impact of the College.\n\nIn 2010, the Board of Rocky Mountain College saw and pursued the opportunity to take Rocky Mountain College to a new place with a new model.\n\nThat new place and model is \"Pathways: Powered by Rocky Mountain College\" which was officially launched at the beginning of 2015. Based on a \"distributed learning model\", Pathways enables the College to provide academic courses and training online to students anywhere in the world.\n\nKerry Belt, President of RMC says, \"We started with a question,\n\n'what if we could take education to people where they are at, instead of expecting them to come to us?'\n\nRMC has always had discipleship and leadership as its genetics. Pathways is another step in pursuing that passion. We believe leaders are best developed as they practice leadership. Pathways takes that idea to a new level.\" Pathways' motto is, \"Anyone. Anywhere. Anytime.\"\n\nMulti-denominational and Partnerships\n\nBecause Rocky Mountain College is multi-denominational, we can serve the needs of a variety of churches and organizations. In addition to arrangements with churches, we also have partnership agreements with over 20 organizations, to assist missions’ agencies, church denominations, camps, and other Christian schools, with online courses.\n\nMissions’ organizations that send people to serve overseas are able to have their missionaries, and the lay leaders they serve alongside, take biblical and theological training through Pathways.\n\nThis training can provide a foundation for their ministry work in locations where there are no other options for biblical and theological courses.\n\nPathways continues to pursue multiple options both in Canada and internationally.\n\nWhereas the traditional Bible College model was based on a physical campus, Pathways sends the training to where our students are already in a ministry or vocational setting, and they are seeking to further their education. Pathways makes training possible for students who would otherwise be unable to take training, students who are already in ministry, who have families they cannot leave, or who live in remote areas.\n\nThe historic mandate of Rocky Mountain College has not changed. We continue to focus on delivering high quality Christian and biblical leadership training to equip students for professional or lay ministry. Pathways is enabling Rocky Mountain College to do that in a new way, to train many more leaders who are committed to building God's kingdom, wherever they serve. Pathways is about investing and making current leaders better."
