        "text": "Thank you for your interest in Cornerstone Christian Academy (CCA). We are excited about what God is doing for our students, families, and school. As you explore our website, we hope you get a sense of what a CCA education would be for your children.\n\nAt CCA, we partner with parents and provide an outstanding, Biblically grounded education as we equip students to fulfill their God-ordained destinies in Christ. CCA exists to bring glory to God and provide a dynamic and transformational educational experience for our students. At CCA, the name of Jesus is proclaimed often, with awe and reverence, as the Name that is above every name!\n\nWe believe each child is a treasure given to parents, having been fearfully and wonderfully made by God (Psalm 139:14). At CCA, we are committed to coming alongside families in helping our students explore and discover the unique gifts, passions, and dreams that God has placed deep within them. We also provide our students with the opportunity to pursue and experience their calling as part of their education at CCA. This is what we refer to as “Calling Prep.”\n\nBeing a ministry of Cornerstone Chapel, CCA educates our students with the same, unchanging Biblical truths upon which Cornerstone Chapel is built. If you love what Cornerstone Chapel stands for as a church, we are confident you will love what Cornerstone Christian Academy will be for your children!\n\nOn August 22, 2023, we opened our doors for the first time and welcomed our inaugural students and families to CCA. We truly believe the Christian leaders of tomorrow sit in CCA classrooms today!\n\nI look forward to linking arms with our parents in building well-equipped, whole-hearted, full throttle, disciples of Jesus Christ!"
