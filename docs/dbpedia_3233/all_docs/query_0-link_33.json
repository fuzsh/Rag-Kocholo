        "text": "Fall 2024\n\nENGL 1000.10 Dean’s Seminar. What’s New About New Plays?. TR 12:45-2:00PM. 3 Credits. Evelyn Schreiber.\n\nThis Dean’s seminar asks the question: What is new about new plays? Are contemporary playwrights reworking classical themes or are their works entirely new entities? What themes reappear and how are they presented? The course also considers how classical plays are re-imagined for modern audiences. For example, do modern directors stage Shakespearean works in different political or social milieus than the original production? Why would directors make these types of artistic decisions? What does it mean for plays to be culturally relevant? How do new plays address race, class and gender issues? Students will consider who attends the theater and who will be in the audience in the future. These questions form a large part of decisions about what plays are selected to be produced each year and the nature of those productions. The reading list includes classic plays and new plays. In particular, we will look at staged works by Eastern European writers/directors. Theaters around the world are suffering following the Covid-19 crisis. We plan to attend two plays in person. We also will view some filmed productions of new plays. Local artistic directors and actors will visit class.\n\nENGL 1000.11. Dean's Seminar. Literary Imaginaries of Human Rights: Caste, Race, and Gender. TR 9:35-10:50AM. 3 Credits. Leenu Sugathan.\n\nThis course offers an introduction to the field of Literature and Human Rights with a specific focus on the experiences of marginalized communities in relation to caste, race, and gender. Drawing from critical approaches in Postcolonial Studies, Critical Race and Caste theories, Black and Dalit Feminism, and Dalit Studies, the course examines how literature reflects and\n\nresponds to human rights issues and discourses.\n\nThrough a human rights lens, which is essentially interdisciplinary, students will analyze the role of literature and literary criticism in not only uncovering power dynamics, ideological underpinnings, and the perpetuation or challenging of systems of oppression, but also building networks of solidarity. The course will also delve into the historical, cultural, and geographical contexts to explore the complex dynamics between caste, race, and gender, providing a roadmap for a more global, inclusive and intersectional understanding of the struggles for dignity and justice. Students will engage with a range of literary forms, including novels, life narratives, and graphic narratives, to develop an understanding of the ongoing socio-political and cultural\n\nconversations about caste, race, gender, and human rights.\n\nENGL 1000.11.

Introduction to Asian American Studies through Literature. TR 3:45-5:00PM. 3 Credits. Patricia Chu.\n\nAre Asian Americans invisible, or hypervisible?\n\nHow do the stereotypes of the geisha, the nerd, the refugee, and the model minority translate into stereotypes of massage workers, kung fu masters, spies, terrorists, and disposable laborers? How do these stereotypes lead to cultural marginalization, political invisibility, and physical attacks? Conversely, how do Asian American scholars, writers, and critics reframe the discourses of America as a land of opportunity or of entrenched racism? Given a space of our own in history, literature, film, and theory, what stories will we tell? Key topics will include gender, sexuality, race, intersectionality, imperialism, migration, exclusion, internment, interracial triangulation, melancholy, and countermemory. Readings and viewings may include Frank Abe and Tamiko Nimura, Peter Bacho, Thi Bui, Cristina Garcia, Mohsin Hamid, Cathy Park Hong, David Henry Hwang, Maxine Hong Kingston, Nam Le, Mira Nair, Anna Deveare Smith, Jade Snow Wong, or others.\n\nWhen taken as ENGL 2100, this course fulfills a GPAC Humanities/Critical Thinking requirement and fulfills requirements in the English major and the Asian American Studies minor.\n\nFor additional information, contact Prof. Chu at [email protected]\n\nENGL 2210.10.

Allyson Stokes.\n\nThis course assumes that all plays are not finished works: they exist to be performed. Each play that we will study over the course of this semester is its own world, with its own unique rhythms and rules, therefore no single analytical strategy is particularly useful. An interpretation of each play demands imaginative flexibility and intellectual rigor – a variety of critical approaches to text. Including small in-class performances in addition to written analysis and discussion.\n\nENGL 2460.10. Fiction Writing. TR 12:45-2:00 PM. 3 Credits.

As such, we'll do plenty of reading as well as writing.\n\nIt’s recommended that students have taken at least one creative writing class (ideally a poetry writing class) and at least one literature class before enrolling in Intermediate Poetry.\n\nENGL 2610W.10. Introduction to Black Literature of America I. TR 3:45-5:00PM. 3 Credits. Jennifer James.\n\nThis introductory course surveys classic works of black American literature from the Age of the American Revolution to the turn of the twentieth century, including poetry, essays, fiction, and autobiography. The semester’s reading is designed to shed light on the lives of Africans brought to the “New World” as enslaved commodities and to illuminate how and why they turned to the written word as a tool of self-making, liberation and resistance. We will give particular attention to the slave narrative, one of the most influential genres of the 19th century. Writers might include Olaudah Equiano, Phillis Wheatley, David Walker, Maria Stewart, Sojourner Truth, Charles Chesnutt, Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. Du Bois.

MW 3:45-5:00PM. 3 Credits. David Mitchell.\n\nDisability (the existence of, or social belief in, an impaired bodymind that is stigmatized) exists at a paradoxical crossroads in film history. First, we tend to watch disabled characters in films all the time yet screen them out of our minds as a specific minority population. Second, many of the most innovative films are based on efforts to portray disabled lives in their gritty encounters with ableist worlds. We will examine this paradox in order to make ourselves more aware of the specific cultural situadedness of people with disabilities as well as to better attend to the ways in which disability fuels filmic creativity.\n\nENGL 3940.10. Black Women Writers 21st Century. TR 11:10AM-12:25PM. 3 Credits. Jennifer James.\n\nThis upper-division course will survey the landscape of celebrated and award-winning\n\ncontemporary Black writers to consider newer and rising voices across a range of genres.

Transnational Film Studies and LGBTQ Cultures. MW 12:45-2:00PM. 3 Credits. Professor Robert McRuer.\n\nThe interdisciplinary field that has come to be called “queer” studies over the past two decades has always concerned itself with questions of representation: how are, for instance, lesbians and gay men, or bisexual or transgender people, represented in film, in novels, in other forms of media? As the field has developed, these questions of representation have increasingly been linked to other complex questions, involving political economy, globalization, and transnationalism: in what ways have lgbt people been incorporated into contemporary nation-states? What identities and desires threaten “the nation” as it is currently (and variously) materialized in our world? How have identities such as “gay” and “lesbian” circulated globally? How have those recognizable minority identities come into contact and conflict with other ways of identifying around non-normative desires? Have those identities at times functioned imperialistically, especially as “gay tourism” has become a recognizable part of global capitalism? Conversely, what kinds of unexpected alliances have been shaped across borders as queer movements have globalized? How have these movements theorized race, gender, class, and ability; what connections have been made with other movements organized, however contentiously, around identity?\n\nThis film studies course will consider how questions of queer representation intersect with questions of queer globalization(s). Please note that, pending CCAS approval, this course will travel to Prague, Czech Republic for a week in November; there will be an additional layer of registration (CCAS Global) during the summer.\n\nENGL 4220.10.

Readings in Creative Writing: Poetics and Politics (Love, War, Refuge). MW 11:10AM-12:25PM. 3 Credits. Jonathan Hsy.\n\nHow is love poetry political? We will consider this question through “slow readings” of English poetry from the Middle Ages to the present. We’ll start with Geoffrey Chaucer’s narrative poem Troilus and Criseyde, a much-translated story of romance and betrayal set during the Trojan War, and we’ll end with the collaboratively authored collection The Refugee Tales. How do poets repurpose ancient stories for their own time and place? What insights can love poetry bring to our understandings of gender and sexuality, race and nation, disability, environment, violence, and social justice?\n\nWe will explore the “matter of Troy” (and its themes of love and migration) in the works of medieval poets as well as contemporary poets of color and refugee writers. Poetic forms include rhyme royale, sonnet, blank verse, free verse, and spoken-word performances.\n\nAssignments will include poetry annotations, close readings, and poetry translation exercises (from one English-language form into another).

Sex in the 18th Century. MW 12:45-2:00PM. 3 Credits. Rachel Canter.\n\nIn this course, we will read the concept of “sex” in 18th century media, attending to the ways that 18th century literature constructs “sex” as sexual acts, as “maleness” and “femaleness,” and in relation to gender and power. Through our examination of this topic, we will also chart “the rise of the novel” through discussing works by novelists including Aphra Behn, Eliza Haywood, Samuel Richardson, John Cleland, and Jane Austen, among other anonymous authors. To frame these 18th century readings, we will engage with fields including Black feminist and feminist of color theory, queer theory, and Black Sexuality Studies.\n\nENGL 3820.80. Slow Reading Virginia Wolf. MW 11:10AM-12:25PM. 3 Credits. Jennifer Green-Lewis.\n\nWe’ll read Virginia Woolf’s most demanding experimental novels in the context of her reflections on art and life, focusing on three areas:\n\nThe aesthetic context of Bloomsbury, and Woolf’s focus on the visual\n\nWoolf’s representation of time and memory\n\nWoolf’s conception of the self in relation to others\n\nIn addition to the novels, readings will include essays, diary entries, and biographical extracts.

Gender and Literature: Contemporary LGBT Writing. 3 Credits. Robert McRuer.\n\nThis section of Gender and Literature will focus on work by openly LGBT writers from Stonewall (1969) to the present. In the process, we will consider the lesbian and gay male 1970s, the coming out novel as it coalesces in the 1980s, the flourishing of trans and non-binary writing in this century. The course will include literature on the AIDS epidemic, on non-urban queer locations, and on the U.S.-Mexican borderlands. The syllabus will include novels, short stories, and nonfiction prose by June Arnold, Armistead Maupin, Audre Lorde, Torrey Peters, Sarah Schulman, Manuel Muñoz, Ocean Vuong, and others.\n\nENGL 3910.10.

Jennifer James.\n\nWhat can we learn from Black women who “lean into the light” during dark times? “Leaning into the light” evokes a multitude of meanings. It might mean art filled with laughter, joy, love, friendship, and overcoming. It might mean art unduly dismissed as “light” reading. Or, in Audre Lorde’s words, it can mean illumination: “The quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives has direct bearing upon the product which we live, and upon the changes which we hope to bring about through those lives. It is within this light that we form those ideas by which we pursue our magic and make it realized.”\n\nOur exploration of celebrated works of literature and art by Black women creators will make the case for the power of the “light.”\n\nFor example, what can “pop” fiction, such as thrillers, romances, and mysteries, tell us about society and ourselves? Can short stories and “book club” picks be as important as the so-called “Great American Novel”? How can humor and comedy point us toward serious matters? How might sci-fi or fantasy take us where might not otherwise go? How might the healing memoir illuminate and inspire? And finally, is there value in reading purely for pleasure? We will consider some of these questions and raise others.\n\nSome texts might include Zakiya Dalila Harris, The Other Black Girl; Stacey Abrams, While Justice Sleeps; Deeshaw Philyaw, The Secret Lives of Church Ladies; Nafissa Thompson-Spires, Heads of the Colored People, Jasmine Guillory, The Wedding Date; Talia Hibbert, Get a Life, Chloe Brown; Nnedi Okorafor, Binti; Morgan Parker, There are More Beautiful Things than Beyoncé; Mecca Jamilah Sullivan: Big Girl; Alexis Pauline Gumbs; Undrowned: Black Feminist Lessons from Marine Animals; Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver, Girls Trip. Will include feminist, queer, cishet, disability, critical race, diasporic and ecological perspectives.\n\nENGL 3960.10. Asian American Literature: Becoming Asian American. TR 11:10AM-12:25PM. 3 Credits. Patricia Chu.\n\nThis course presents Asian American literature as a diasporic, postcolonial literature of social protest and dissent. We’ll discuss Chinese Exclusion and the roots of anti-Asian hate; narratives and histories of the Japanese American internments; adoption and racial melancholia; coming of age and coming out; historical erasure and countermemory; mental health and disability; climate change; dissent and discipline. Prospective authors include Christina Garcia, the graffiti poets of Angel Island, George Takei, Deanne Borshay Liem, Min Jin Lee, Maxine Hong Kingston, Malinda Lo, Elaine Castillo, Jessica Hagedorn, Fiona Cheong, Anita Desai, Amitav Ghosh, Monique Truong, and Viet Thanh Nguyen; erin Khuê Ninh, David L.

Digital Storytelling and Social Justice. TR 11:10AM-12:25PM. 3 Credits. Emma Wu.\n\nIn this course, we will explore the ways in which multimedia narratives on digital platforms can broaden our perception of belonging, foster dialogue and connection, and advance social justice causes. How can we reconsider narrative conventions, multimodal dimensionality, and structural mechanics to craft compelling digital stories? We will spend about half of our time together in writing workshop, providing feedback to our peers’ digital stories, and half our time in CREATE Digital Studios, gaining practical competencies and considering the capacity of various digital platforms to tell stories that amplify diverse voices, challenge dominant narratives, and advocate for social change. No previous technical experience is necessary.\n\nThis course fulfills the GPAC Arts in Creative Thinking / Tier Two Requirement and the Civic Engagement / Tier Two Requirement as clarified through GPAC.\n\nENGL 4220.10.

Professor Evelyn Schreiber.\n\nThis Dean’s seminar takes advantage of the theater offerings in Washington and asks the question: What is new about new plays? Are contemporary playwrights reworking classical themes or are their works entirely new entities? What themes reappear and how are they presented? The course also considers how classical plays are re-imagined for modern audiences. For example, is a Shakespearean work staged in a different political or social milieu than the original production? Why would directors make these types of artistic decisions? What does it mean for plays to be culturally relevant? Students will consider who attends the theater and who will be in the audience in the future. These questions form a large part of decisions about what plays Artistic Directors select to be produced each year and the nature of those productions. We will read at least three classical plays and three new plays. Hopefully, theaters will once again be open for live, in-person performances and we will attend two plays. I have arranged with Artistic Directors in DC and elsewhere to have filmed performances of new plays streamed to us to provide additional new plays to view.\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: This course fulfills the critical thinking in humanities GPAC requirement; restricted to first year students only.\n\nENGL 1000.11.

As a class, we will determine what qualifies “good” or “bad” writing by reading a wide variety of published works, and by sharing and evaluating the original work of our classmates. We will explore lots of prompts that help us generate creative content, and will write (and revise!) several pieces of work. There is a workshop component to this class, meaning that each student will share their poem, short story, and personal essay with a peer group to discuss and critique. This may sound intimidating, but we as a class will establish ahead of time how to make feedback and criticism helpful and constructive.

Introduction to Creative Writing. MW 12:45-2:00PM. 3 Credits. Professor Aaron Hamburger.\n\nWhat do Shakespeare, J. K. Rowling, George Orwell, and Amanda Gorman all have in common? At some point during their celebrated careers as playwrights, novelists, essayists, and poets, they were beginners, stumbling in the dark, struggling to express themselves with language.\n\nSelf-expression through language is a lifelong challenge faced not just by budding authors but also all human beings, and the study of creative writing provides excellent training to meet that challenge. As author Ntozake Shange says: \"Language and how we use language determines how we act, and how we act then determines our lives and other people’s lives.”\n\nIn this course, we’ll experiment with three modes of creative expression using language: poetry, fiction, and creative non-fiction. We’ll begin by looking at examples from published authors to come up with strategies to communicate our visions clearly to readers. Also, we’ll do writing exercises to develop our own unique voices and what each of us values as a writer. From there, we'll build to create original works to share with classmates, giving and receiving supportive but rigorous feedback so we understand where we've been clear and where we're still fuzzy, both in our expressions and in our own minds. By the end of this course, you'll feel more confident and joyful as a writer, reader, and human being.\n\nENGL 1210.15. Introduction to Creative Writing. TR 11:10AM-12:25PM. 3 Credits.

Virginia Hartman.\n\nPlays, short stories, poems—what place do they have in our lives? How are they created? We’ll dip a toe into each genre, reading and practicing them for ourselves. Intro to Creative Writing is a sprint through three forms, so be prepared for a very full semester of reading and daily writing. By the end, you’ll be in touch with your own creative powers and—side benefit—you’ll be closer to knowing what you like about existing samples of each type of writing.\n\nENGL 1210.18.

Mary-Sherman Willis.\n\nA writer is a reader, responding.\n\nNo matter what your major is and what your other coursework, during this semester you will be functioning as a creative writer. Creative writers usually have some other occupation -- a job, for instance -- and must develop work habits to support their writing. Therefore, you will need to find a place and a method to do lots of writing, lots of reading. Creative writers are note-takers and revisers. They share their work with each other to get constructive feedback. In this class, so will you.\n\nCreative writing takes many forms, but we’ll concentrate on prose (that is, fiction and creative non-fiction or memoir) and poetry. The first part of this course will look at the basic craft issues of all three genres (image, voice, character, setting, story and revision). The second part will concern the specifics of each genre.\n\nThe classes will consist of discussion of assigned texts to explore issues of craft, short in-class writing exercises, and workshops. There will be assigned reading and writing homework to generate new work, which you’ll be taking from first draft through several revisions to a final polished poem or story.\n\nWe’ll be using one survey textbook:\n\nImaginative Writing: The Elements of Craft, 4th ed.

Jonathan Hsy.\n\nThis course takes the idea of “Britain” as our launching point for investigating myth-making and cultural identity, and the class is open to anyone who is interested in how to analyze texts, art, and media (including online and multimedia works). From medieval stories of London as “New Troy” (founded by refugees fleeing the Trojan War) to Arthurian legends of Stonehenge as matter magically transported from Africa by giants, longstanding foundation myths have always placed “Britain” at the nexus of global flows of culture: from Asia, Africa, the Mediterranean, and beyond.\n\nIn this age of post-Brexit politics and anti-immigrant xenophobia, this course invites us to consider the varied shapes that Britain’s founding myths can take across time. Some authors might nostalgically look back to the days of King Arthur and a glorious past to justify imperialism and colonial expansion, but some can find in Britain’s complex history an opportunity to challenge narrow ideas of “British” identity or white supremacy. What, then, does the idea of “Britain” actually mean for diverse people across the globe?\n\nBy exploring “Myths of Britain” from the Middle Ages to the present, we will attend to vital issues of race, gender, class, migration, decolonization, and environmentalism. We’ll examine multifaceted meanings of “Britain” (past and present) for contemporary artists, poets, and filmmakers. In our collective endeavor, will gain a fuller historical understanding of figures that loom large in anglophone literary history (such as Chaucer and Shakespeare); we will just as importantly appreciate how medieval and early modern forms of storytelling inspire Black British, Black Caribbean, Indigenous, and Jewish and Asian diaspora authors.\n\nNo prior experience with medieval or early modern literature is required! All readings will be available in modern English translation.\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: Fulfills GPAC Tier-2 (CCAS) Critical Thinking in the Humanities Requirement.

Professor Patricia Chu.\n\nHow do modern writers adapt the conventions of fantasy narration and the bildungsroman--the novel of education--to address questions of identity, class, gender, species, social dissent, and desire? We'll explore the connections between fantasy genres in the English literary canon (fairy tales, epic, myth, medieval romance), coming of age themes (in young adult fantasy, anime, magic realism), and speculative fiction.\n\nREADINGS: Tatar, The Classic Fairy Tales. Stone, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Renault, The King Must Die. Mitchell, Gilgamesh. Shelley, Frankenstein. Hartman, Seraphina. Butler, Kindred.

Patricia Chu.\n\nAre Asian Americans invisible, or hypervisible?\n\nHow do the stereotypes of the geisha, the nerd, the refugee, and the model minority translate into stereotypes of massage workers, kung fu masters, spies, terrorists, and disposable laborers? How do these stereotypes lead to cultural marginalization, political invisibility, and physical attacks? Conversely, how do Asian American scholars, writers, and critics reframe the discourses of America as a land of opportunity or of entrenched racism? Given a space of our own in history, literature, film, and theory, what stories will we tell? Key topics will include gender, sexuality, race, intersectionality, imperialism, migration, exclusion, internment, interracial triangulation, melancholy, and countermemory. Readings and viewings may include Frank Abe and Tamiko Nimura, Peter Bacho, Thi Bui, Cristina Garcia, Mohsin Hamid, Cathy Park Hong, David Henry Hwang, Maxine Hong Kingston, Nam Le, Mira Nair, Anna Deveare Smith, Jade Snow Wong, or others.\n\nWhen taken as ENGL 2100, this course fulfills a GPAC Humanities/Critical Thinking requirement and fulfills requirements in the English major and the Asian American Studies minor.\n\nFor additional information, contact Prof. Chu at [email protected]\n\nENGL 2210.10.

In Fiction Writing, we will struggle toward the why of our own stories, and employ the techniques that make our readers want to go along for the ride. I’ll assume you’ve taken Introduction to Creative Writing and are already familiar with the basics of fiction writing, as well as with the principles necessary to giving insightful critiques to your peers and incorporating helpful suggestions into your own stories. You’ll refine your ability to invite readers into the dreamtime of the story. We’ll read George Saunders, Alice McDermott and other masters in our quest for role models.\n\nENGL 2460.11.

Leenu Sugathan.\n\nThis course offers an introduction to Postcolonial Studies through the transmediatic, anti-racist representation of contemporary migration. We take as our focus, postcolonial comics. We will learn how to analyze comics, and we will explore how, following Art Spiegelman’s influential work Maus, we witness the flourishing historical energies and political edge of the growing global field of graphic narratives. We compare the graphic representation of world migration across different Anglophone cultures and societies from Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America, through an intersectional feminist lens. In the process, we will map how global graphic narratives document, witness, and illuminate displacement, survival, and belonging in a cross-cultural, comparative mode.\n\nENGL 2800.

Thea Brown.\n\nWhat makes a revolutionary poem? In this class we’ll dig into works by poets who are shaped by and responding to their contemporaneous cultural contexts, who strive for change through artistic expression. We’ll spend relevant time with 20th century writers like Audre Lorde, Anne Sexton, Gil Scott-Heron, Amiri Baraka, and Diane di Prima, as well as 21st century writers like Evie Shockley, Terrance Hayes, Cedar Sigo, and Solmaz Sharif. Students in this class will focus on poetic output (and will participate in poetry workshops) but will also spend time writing analytically and reflectively.\n\nIt’s recommended that students have taken at least two creative writing classes and at least two literature classes before enrolling in this course.\n\nENGL 3360.10.

TR 11:10AM-12:25PM. 3 Credits. Sam Ashworth.\n\nENGL 3390: The Working Writer is a class dedicated to teaching the skills that writers need to publish, promote, and get paid. Almost every week, the class will meet with experienced agents, editors, freelancers, journalists, ghostwriters, copywriters, and others; at the same time, students will spend the semester writing a long (50+ page) piece of original fiction or nonfiction, along with article pitches and queries. Students are strongly encouraged to begin the class with a sense of the project they want to work on. By the end, students will have a deepened sense of who they are as writers, as well as a knowledge of the industry that can take most writers years to develop, including:\n\n· The art of pitching articles to editors\n\n· What literary agents do and how to query them effectively\n\n· How to craft a book proposal\n\n· Conceiving and reporting out feature pieces\n\n· The book publication process\n\n· Negotiate contracts and invoice for payment\n\n· Ghostwriting\n\n· And much more!\n\nENGL 3390. 11. Poetry: Remix, Cover & Sample. MW 11:10AM-12:25PM. 3 Credits.

MW 2:20-3:35PM. 3 Credits. Jonathan Hsy.\n\nThis course examines how medieval authors represented their ever-shifting urban environments. Urban living means many things to many people, and we will encounter the city as a multiethnic melting pot, a site of crime and scandal, a space of refuge, and a venue for reinventing one’s self. Readings will include courtly romances, comic fabliaux, love lyrics, and forms of life writing such as autobiography and saints’ lives. Through a selection of diverse literary authors (Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower, Marie de France, Margery Kempe, and Teresa de Cartagena), we will approach the Middle Ages as a time of perpetual motion and change: a world where human identity is varied, adaptive, and open to new possibilities.\n\nOur readings will be put in conversation with contemporary critical theory, and we will explore the complexities of medieval notions of disability, race, gender, and sexuality. We will also consider how medieval storytelling inspires contemporary art such as fantasy film (The Green Knight) or spoken word poetry (The Refugee Tales). Assignments will include close readings and a comparative essay which you will write and revise in stages.\n\nNo prior experience with medieval literature is required! All readings will be available in modern English translation.\n\nENGL 3520.10. American Romanticism. MW 12:45-2:00PM. 3 Credits. Ormond Seavey.\n\nENGL 3650.10. The Short Story. TR 2:20-3:35PM. 3 Credits. Maria Frawley.\n\nVariety is the spice of life! In this class we’ll read a wide variety of short stories in order to gain a better understanding of the genre. To that end we’ll consider the social and historical contexts that inform the stories we read as well as the author’s approach to their craft, paying particular attention to narrative techniques, story structure, and temporal management. We will read stories now widely regarded as classics as well as very recent stories, some appearing in magazines during our semester together. We will consider theories of the genre, such as those influentially advanced by Edgar Allen Poe; particular sub-genres or modes, such as “Southern Gothic”; and related genres, such as the short story cycle. Authors will include Edgar Allen Poe, John Cheever, Flannery O’Connor, Joyce Carol Oates, James Joyce, William Trevor, Jhumpa Lahiri, David Foster Wallace, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Salmon Rushdie, Zadie Smith, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, among others. Class will be discussion based and students will have a variety of short writing assignments, including an option for creative writing at the end of the semester.\n\nENGL 3820W.10. Major Authors. Jane Austen: Literary Icon. TR 11:10AM-12:25PM. 3 Credits. Professor Maria Frawley.\n\nWhy does Jane Austen still matter? This course focuses on the novelist’s literary achievements, the vagaries of her reception over time, and on her continuing relevance to our own culture and historical moment. Our reading will include all of her novels, some unpublished early writing, and work unfinished at her death. Understanding the social and historical contexts that shaped Austen’s work will be a major preoccupation. Among our many topics for consideration will be the ways Austen both reflects and responds to social hierarchy and class relations in Regency England; the relationship between gender ideology, “conduct book culture,” and Austen’s representations of women’s lives; Austen and the histories and legacies of colonialism and slavery; Austen’s views of national identity in the era of the French Revolution; and her innovative narrative and linguistic techniques. Also, Austen and adaptation (esp. film, but also other media)! Students will expect to come away from this course with a solid grasp of the social, historical, and literary contexts of Austen’s fiction; with greater appreciation of the stylistic achievements of her fiction writing; and with the ability to critically assess how and why Austen’s works have been received and adapted over time. Writing assignments for this course will enable students to cultivate their analytic abilities and tap into their creativity, while also practicing writing for different audiences.\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: This course fulfills a WID requirement.\n\nENGL 3826.10. Morrison and Faulkner. TR 11:10AM-12:25PM. 3 Credits. Professor Evelyn Schreiber.\n\nToni Morrison and William Faulkner\n\n“Race, Memory, and Aesthetics”\n\nThis course links authors Toni Morrison and William Faulkner through the ways in which their fictional and discursive practices reflect on each other. Specifically, we will examine how the texts of both authors reenact and resist racism and patriarchal structures; how they explore the ways in which memory and the past construct identity; and how they experiment with style. We will consider the ways in which the texts illuminate a continuum in American literature through discussions of socially constructed identity and issues of race, class, and gender. In addition, the class utilizes cultural studies, trauma studies, and psychoanalytic critical approaches to the texts of these authors.\n\nTEXTS (subject to change):\n\nWilliam Faulkner: Light in August, The Sound and the Fury, Absalom, Absalom!\n\nToni Morrison: Song of Solomon, The Bluest Eye, Beloved, God Help the Child\n\nAdditional Materials posted on Blackboard\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: This course fulfills the Minority/Diversity requirement for English Majors.\n\nENGL 3980W.60H. Transnational Film Studies and LGBTQ Cultures. MW 12:45-2:00PM. 3 Credits. Professor Robert McRuer.\n\nEnglish 3980W: Transnational Film Studies and LGBTQ Cultures: The interdisciplinary field that has come to be called “queer” studies over the past two decades has always concerned itself with questions of representation: how are, for instance, lesbians and gay men, or bisexual or transgender people, represented in film, in novels, in other forms of media? As the field has developed, these questions of representation have increasingly been linked to other complex questions, involving political economy, globalization, and transnationalism: in what ways have lgbt people been incorporated into contemporary nation-states? What identities and desires threaten “the nation” as it is currently (and variously) materialized in our world? How have identities such as “gay” and “lesbian” circulated globally? How have those recognizable minority identities come into contact and conflict with other ways of identifying around non-normative desires? Have those identities at times functioned imperialistically, especially as “gay tourism” has become a recognizable part of global capitalism? Conversely, what kinds of unexpected alliances have been shaped across borders as queer movements have globalized? How have these movements theorized race, gender, class, and ability; what connections have been made with other movements organized, however contentiously, around identity?\n\nThis film studies course will consider how questions of queer representation intersect with questions of queer globalization(s).\n\nPlease note that, pending CCAS approval, this course will travel to Prague, Czech Republic for a week in November; there will be an additional layer of registration (CCAS Global) during the summer.\n\nENGL 4040.10.

M 5:10-7:00PM. 3 Credits. Professor Robert McRuer.\n\nEnglish 6100 will introduce and briefly overview some of the major movements in critical theory—such as poststructuralism, postmodernism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, feminism, African American and Latina/o cultural theory, postcolonial theory, queer theory, and disability studies—that have brought us to the contemporary moment in the study of culture and society. As this list should suggest, a large part of the course will consider the “cultural turn” that literary study has taken over the past few decades. Some of the questions the class will pose are: what do we mean when we talk about such vexed terms as culture, identity, language, interpretation, meaning, theory, criticism, cultural studies? What does critical theory offer us as readers and writers, as participants in various cultures, as citizens? What does knowledge in and as democracy look like? How have the new social movements transformed knowledge in and out of the academy? How does power circulate through the production, consumption, and interpretation of culture?\n\nENGL 6130.10. Minitorian Performance. W 5:00-7:00PM. 3 Credits. James McMaster.\n\nThis course provides a graduate-level survey of the interdisciplinary field of performance studies. Performance studies brings attention to embodiment, the live event, and lived social relations. Its practitioners may study theatre, dance, music, film, visual culture, and other art forms. They may also study the performance of everyday life, including the performances of race, class, gender, sexuality, disability, nation, indigeneity, and diaspora that constitute the social as such. This course’s adventure into performance studies will begin at the field’s founding and end at its current cutting edge. Theorists covered include Judith Butler, José Esteban Muñoz, Diana Taylor, Fred Moten, Karen Shimakawa, Richard Schechner, Alexandra T. Vazquez, and more.\n\nThroughout the semester students will be asked to engage with the vast cultural resources of Washington D.C., its theatres, museums, clubs, monuments, political events, festivals, and so forth. The course will train students in the reading and writing of minoritarian performance theory. It will also attend to the institutional and informal infrastructures that constitute the professionalized scene of performance studies (conferences, journals, departments, cohorts, etc.) while simultaneously providing students with experience in a variety of academic genres including the abstract, the review, the panel proposal, and the conference presentation. Ultimately, however, the primary objective of this course is simple: for all involved to imagine and enact new and better worlds for minoritarian flourishing.\n\nENGL 6510.80.

Professor Alexa Joubin.\n\nWhat is gender? How do ideologies make gender “perform”? Is visibility always empowering and desirable? Performance theories provide fertile soil for understanding gender practices, because gender is not a fixed identity but a set of social practices and interpersonal relationships. They evolve in the presence of other people, in social spaces, and over time.\n\nThrough the lens of social justice, this seminar examines cinematic representations of embodied identities from early modern to modern times. In particular, we will focus on gender and race, gender and sexuality, gender and disability, transfeminism, and intersectional identities in pop culture.\n\nThis course fulfills the pre-1800 requirement. In examining films about early modern and modern identities, we trace their common emotional burden. Benefit: Exploring cinematic representations of early modern ideas about gender can alleviate our contemporary biases against atypical bodies and experiences.\n\nWe will learn how to apply theoretical tools to global films in the interest of producing scholarship that instigates changes.\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: Course fulfills the pre-1800 requirement.\n\nENGL 6720.10.

Professor Antonio López.\n\nIntroduces first- and second-year students to college-level literary analysis, leading to more advanced work. We will study short stories, novels, poetry, and plays, paying attention to form, genre, and meaning. Never far from our concerns will be key questions: What's literature? What defines a poem, a short story, a play, and how are these things related to and different from one another? Finally, we’ll do varieties of critical reading: close, slow, and deep readings; distant, fast, and surface readings, focusing on how literary works stage narrators and speakers, metaphors and tone, and much more.\n\nENGL 1210. Introduction to Creative Writing. TR 2:20 - 3:35 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Thea Brown.\n\nThis course offers a hands-on investigation into the practice of creative writing through multiple genres, which can include poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, and playwriting. Students will explore their unique writerly voices by building and sharing original work, and they will examine the craft of published writers to bolster their own understanding.\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: Fulfills the GPAC requirement for creative or critical thinking in the arts.\n\nENGL 1210. Introduction to Creative Writing. MW 12:45 - 2:00 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Lisa Page.\n\nThis course introduces the study of three genres: fiction, creative nonfiction, and poetry, with a focus on literature from the inside out. It includes a writing workshop component and fulfills the GPAC Creative Thinking requirement.\n\nENGL 1330. Myths of Britain. TR 3:45 - 5:00 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Daniel DeWispelare\n\n“Myths of Britain” is an introductory course that invites all students who are interested in cultural artifacts—things like books, music, drama, song, photographs, film, painting, sculpture, and even social media. We will be reading and consuming works by a diverse array of individuals, past and present, who are associated with, informed by, and often critical of the idea of “Britain,” an idea that casts a long shadow over the present.\n\nTo ground our discussion about cultural change and exchange we will consider the idea of “Britain” as a starting point for more general discussions about myth and culture. Some of the myths that we will track during the semester include, but are not limited to: mythological myths, like those pertaining to Boudica and King Arthur; dramatic myths like those surrounding Shakespeare—“the Bard;” economic myths like those undergirding the work of Adam Smith and the other grandfathers of neoliberalism; ecological myths and imperial myths, which have long provided an alibi for British expansion; and even enduring romantic myths such as one finds in the work nineteenth-century writers, all of which are complicated by changing gender formations.\n\nThe year is 2023 and so our conversations about culture’s tentacles will be informed by ongoing discussions surrounding the long histories of Brexit, decolonialism, race, gender, class, environmentalism, the cultural now, and, of course, our cultural future. Politics itself being rooted in forms of mythology, the contemporary moment offers a unique opportunity to glimpse a long period of cultural history—it happens that we will be reading, viewing, and discussing works from roughly 50 BCE to the present, with a dense focus on the Middle Ages and Early Modern Period—while also attending to the specificities of our collective and global now.\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: Fulfills GPAC Tier-2 (CCAS) Critical Thinking in the Humanities Requirement.

Literature and the Environment. TR 12:45 - 2:00 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Maria Frawley.\n\nWhat do we mean when we refer to “the environment”? Do we mean “nature,” “wilderness,” “geography,” “ecology,” “the earth,” “the non-human world,” “the outdoors,” or something else? This course will explore the many ways that literary texts, art, and even social media respond to and shape our environmental understanding. We will read widely, starting with works of literature from writers first responding to the industrial revolution and developing an eco-consciousness and moving to more contemporary writers responding to the effects of settler colonialism on the living world, the perils of climate change, or the promises of sustainability. We will weave in chapters from Robin Wall Kimmerer’s Braiding Sweetgrass by way of exploring indigenous ways of understanding the environment. Throughout the semester we will be alert to the many ways that our contemporary culture both heightens and mutes our environmental awareness. Students will write two short papers, work either individually or in small groups on a presentation, and complete a final examination.\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: Fulfills GPAC Tier-2 (CCAS) Critical Thinking in the Humanities Requirement. Fulfills GPAC Tier-2 (CCAS) Oral Communication Requirement.\n\nENGL 2210. Techniques in Creative Writing. MW 2:20 - 3:35 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Lisa Page.\n\nNovelist John Gardner said, there are only two kinds of stories: A man goes on a journey or a stranger comes to town. This course is dedicated to the close study of literature utilizing the journey as narrative. Selections include the novel, the short story collection, the memoir, poetry, and narrative nonfiction. This course includes a writing workshop.\n\nENGL 2210. Techniques in Creative Writing. Around the World in 80 Poems. TR 11:10 AM - 12:25 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Thea Brown.\n\nEvery week we will be close-reading a variety of poems, and after analyzing how these poems work, you will write your own poem; and then, as a class, we’ll “workshop” your poem. I’ve designed this course as a reading and writing workshop. It is not a survey course. Over the semester, we will explore my own idiosyncratic world anthology of poems including those by Amorak (Inuit) and First Nation Swampy Cree, Haiku Masters, Neruda’s Odes Elementales, Cortazar’s “Instructions on How to Climb Stairs,” and Paul Celan’s “Death Fugue,” the most famous poem written about the Holocaust. Most poems are in translation; but some are by poets from the English-speaking world—Heaney, Boland, Walcott. On occasion, we’ll travel across centuries and cultures: Li Po (6 th- century China) and Wyatt (16 th -century English Metaphysical.) I have wanted for decades to make these amazing poets the centerpiece of their own course, in which we explore their eclectic cultures, poetic styles, and sensibilities. GW has a large multi- cultural and international student body, and surely there are other poets whose work you may already know and want to share.\n\nENGL 2411W. An Introduction to English Literature: Love and Death. MW 2:20 - 3:35 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Jennifer Green-Lewis.\n\nThis course offers an introduction to two major periods of British Literature from the late-eighteenth century to the early-twentieth, and it will balance close textual analysis with broad, historically-informed reflection. Focusing primarily on one author from each of the Romantic and Victorian periods, we will examine how love and death—the life of the emotions and the realities of the body—are represented in the works of each. Chosen authors for Spring 2023 are John Keats (poems and letters), and Charles Dickens (David Copperfield). We will end with a study of war poetry of the period, including poetry from the Great War (1914-18). This course fulfills the WID requirement. Written assignments will include close readings, research assignments, short essays, and revisions.\n\nENGL 2460. Fiction of Writing. TR 12:45 - 2:00 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Johannes Litchman.\n\nFiction workshop dedicated to writing, reading, and understanding fiction. Over the course of the semester, we will read published short stories to improve our understanding of craft, complete writing exercises to sharpen our storytelling tools, write our own short stories, and discuss our works-in-progress as a class.\n\nENGL 2470. Poetry Writing. MW 11:10 AM - 12:25 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Chet’la Sebree.\n\nStudents will be introduced to the foundational principles of reading and writing poetry through craft-related texts and contemporary poetry collections, while learning how to find inspiration through art, music, and the world around them, using the DC landscape as a creative playground. Students will also have the opportunity to revise their poems through workshops in which their classmates provide feedback on drafts of their poems.\n\nENGL 2560. Intermediate Fiction. TR 2:20 - 3:35 PM/ TR 11:10 - 12:25PM. 3 Credits. Professor Aaron Hamburger.\n\n\"Every time we sit down at the page, we’re beginners.\" Claire Vaye Watkins\n\nWhat do Virginia Woolf, J. K. Rowling, Toni Morrison, Jorge Luis Borges, and Stephen King all have in common? At some point during their celebrated careers as fiction writers, they were beginners, stumbling in the dark, trying to figure out how to tell a compelling story.\n\nNovelist E. M. Forster traces the storytelling impulse to the beginnings of human existence: “Neanderthal man listened to stories, if one may judge by the shape of his skull. The primitive audience gaped around the campfire, fatigued with contending against the mammoth or wooly-rhinoceros, and only kept awake by suspense. What would happen next? The novelist droned on, and as soon as the audience guessed what happened next, they either fell asleep or killed him.”\n\nWe’ll take a look at three modes of fiction writing: flash fiction, short stories, and novels. Along the way, we’ll analyze samples from published authors for strategies to keep our readers awake, not just with easy plot twists, but also with the more complex and rewarding suspense of dynamic characters, vivid settings, and surprising yet satisfying uses of language.\n\nENGL 2800. Introduction to Critical Theory. TR 11:10 AM - 12:25 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Daniel DeWispelare.\n\nThis survey course introduces students to argumentative writings that are commonly grouped under the hybrid heading “literary theory and cultural criticism.” On one level, this is a course in the history of ideas. One can even say that it is a course in the history of one very persistent and knotty philosophical problem: what, if any, is the nature of the relationship between cultural “representation” and empirical “reality?” Put another way, what if any amount of “truth” resides in the artistic, linguistic, and especially literary representations that we make of objects, individuals, communities, or the world? Some more specific versions of this question include: does language bear any relationship to the reality it purports to describe? Is there some “engine” or “spirit” at the heart of culture that generates art independent of any one artist’s intentions? What autonomous cultural work do representations of communities and individuals do? What is the relationship between aesthetics and politics? We will discuss these and other questions, and students will gain familiarity with trenchant answers as proposed by thinkers from Plato to the Postmodernists.\n\nOn another level, this is a course in specific methods that are often deployed in literary and cultural criticism. Students will gain fluency in the terminology and conceptual frameworks associated with aesthetics, idealism, materialism, psychoanalytic criticism, structuralism, post-structuralism, post-colonialism, new historicism, affect theory, ecocriticism, as well as critical race, gender, sex, and\n\ndisability studies. By mastering the basic contours of these diverse ways of interpreting artistic and cultural phenomena, students will be equipped to pursue more advanced courses in literature, philosophy, history, cultural studies, and even political theory. In terms of literature in particular, our readings will allow us to talk at length about the history of form, genre, language, and aesthetics.\n\nThis course asks that students engage with readings that are short but frequently quite difficult, both linguistically and conceptually. In addition to the texts on criticism, we will also be reading two works of fiction on which students will practice their new critical knowledge.\n\nENGL 2800W. Introduction to Critical Theory. TR 12:45 - 2:00 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Alexa Joubin.\n\nThrough the lens of social justice, this course examines cinematic representations of embodied identities. In particular, we will focus on racialized bodies, performance of sexuality, trans / feminist interventions, and intersectional identities in pop culture. We focus on theories that are most relevant to our contemporary political and cultural life. Students will gain fluency in the conceptual frameworks associated with feminism and critical race, and queer studies. More importantly, students will learn how to apply theoretical tools to global films in the interest of producing scholarship that instigates changes.\n\nHighlights: Theories and creative works by people of color, women, and disability / LGTBTQ-identified writers\n\nENGL 3210. Readings in Creative Writing: The Politics of Form (Translation and Betrayal). MW 11:10AM - 12:25 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Jonathan Hsy.\n\nHow is poetic form political? We will consider this question through “slow readings” of English poetry across time, from the Middle Ages to the present. Our focus will be Geoffrey Chaucer’s narrative poem Troilus and Criseyde, a much-translated story of love and betrayal set against the backdrop of the Trojan War. How do poets across time repurpose this ancient story for their own time and place? What insights do poet-translators bring our understandings of gender, race, disability, environment, the ethics of violence, and social justice? We will explore adaptions of the “matter of Troy” by medieval poets as well as contemporary feminists and poets of color. Poetic forms include rhyme royale, sonnet, blank verse, free verse, spoken-word performance, and musical genres. Assignments will include poetry annotations, close readings, and poetry translation exercises (from one English-language form into another). No knowledge of Middle English is required!\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: This course fulfills the “Readings” requirement of the Creative Writing major.\n\nENGL 3370. Advanced Poetry Workshop. MW 2:20 - 3:35PM. 3 Credits. Professor Chet’la Sebree.\n\nIn “What’s the Difference? Chapbooks vs. Full-Length Poetry Collections,” Lindsay Lubsy explains that “[i]f a full-length collection is a house, a chapbook wouldn’t be a Barbie Dreamhouse version. It would be a single room within the life-size house, maybe even the doll room—a small space where the walls are lined with a single obsession.” In this project-oriented advanced poetry workshop, students will work on their own chapbooks, which will feature a series of interrelated poems. Over the course of the semester, they will refine the skills necessary to develop these collections through close readings, workshops, and discussions of structure, order, and revision. In the class, students will balance developing and editing work-in-progress and discussion contemporary chapbooks, which will help inform and guide their own.\n\nNew accordion content\n\nENGL 3390. The Writing of Fiction. MW 2:20 - 3:35 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Edward Jones.\n\nThis is a fiction writing workshop, with class meeting twice a week. The 75 minutes of each class are devoted primarily to discussion of students’ work. Before class, in my office, I will meet individually with the one or two students whose work will be discussed during that day’s class. From time to time, our classes will discuss published stories, but our focus during the semester will be primarily on student stories.\n\nENGL 3395. Creative Nonfiction. TR 12:45 - 2:00PM. 3 Credits. Professor Annie Liontas.\n\nCreative Nonfiction workshop exploring memoir and other sub-genres of the form, including profiles, the essay, and cultural criticism.\n\nENGL 3400. Topics in Literature and Finance. MW 11:10 AM - 12:25PM. 3 Credits. Professor Holly Dugan.\n\nHow do we talk about money? Is there an art to it? And what do great artists have to say about this topic? In this course, we'll read a wide variety of literary texts (deemed by many to be canonical works of literature). Our goal will be to explore how money functions in these texts as an index of value, a measure of power, a part of our identity, and as a tool to create change. We'll then apply these insights and connect them to our own queries about art and economics, including our own personal and cultural investments in money. Students will practice analyzing, writing, and speaking about these topics at the very highest levels, honing their skills by working together to produce a podcast that explores literary and economic themes in these books.\n\nThe reading list includes: contemporary poetry, Chaucer's \"Pardoner's Tale,\" Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors, Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, Butler’s Parable of the Sower, Le Guin’s The Dispossessed, Ma’s Severance, Norris's McTeague, and Ellis's American Psycho.\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: Fulfills GPAC for Humanities & Oral Communication.\n\nENGL 3441W. Shakespeare, Race and Gender on Screen. TR 2:20 - 3:35 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Alexa Jubin.\n\nThrough the lenses of critical race and gender theories, this course examines cinematic representations of Shakespeare’s plays, with a focus on the themes of sexuality, class, and colonialism. In particular, we will focus on racialized bodies, performance of gender and sexuality, disability narratives, feminist interventions, religious fault lines, class struggle, and intersectional identities. Collectively we will reflect on our embodied vulnerability. Students will learn textual and film analytical skills and make evidence-based arguments.\n\nENGL 3650. The Short Story. TR 12:45 - 2:00 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Antonio López\n\nDesigned for upper-level students to study the genre, history, and key texts of the short story in different historical periods and national literary traditions. We'll read theories of narrative, fiction, and genre, and we'll enjoy a variety of examples of the short story, from the early tale and the novella to the micro form of flash fiction.\n\nENGL 3800. Hawaiian Literary Renaissance. T 2:20 - 3:35 PM. 3 Credits. Professor David Mitchell.\n\nIn many ways, 1898 competes with 1776 as a critical transition in U.S. History for it was in that year the U.S. set off on a frenzy of imperialism by annexing Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico. We will focus our primary attention on the revival of indigenous practices spawned by the “Hawaiian Literary Renaissance” during the 1970s and ‘80s. These writers’ experimental genres, oral storytelling, and archeological investigations formed a resistance literature on behalf of continuing struggles with corporate graft, tourism-based dispossessions, toxic pesticides, military weaponry, oceanic waste drift, volcanic eruptions, foreign diseases, anti-Asian movements, internal secession efforts, as well as the genocide of sea life and the death of coral reefs. Key works include: O.A. Bushnell’s Return of Lono (1956); Kazuo Miyamoto’s Hawaii: The End of the Rainbow (1964); Milton Murayama’s All I Asking For Is My Body (1975); Maxine Hong Kingston’s China Men (1980); Lois-Ann Yamanaka’s Blu’s Hanging (1997); Sarah Vowell’s Unfamiliar Fishes (2011).\n\nCourse Attributes: This course fulfills GenEd Critical Analysis Humanities; Oral Communication; Global Cross-Cultural; fulfills an elective in Micro-Minor in Asian American Studies.\n\nENGL 3810. Victorian Gothic. MW 12:45 - 2:00 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Rachael Lynch.\n\nThis seminar will examine classic gothic and horror figures such as the vampire, the mummy, the immortal being, and the doppelgänger in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature, including but not limited to Shelley’s Frankenstein, selected works of Brontë sisters, Le Fanu’s Carmilla, Stevenson’s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Stoker’s Dracula. Additionally, this course will interrogate how queerness, disability, colonization, xenophobia, and national identity inform the development of the gothic as a literary genre.\n\nENGL 3820. Slow Reading Virginia Woolf. MW 11:10 AM - 12:25PM. 3 Credits. Professor Jennifer Green-Lewis.\n\nIn this course we’ll slow-read three of Virginia Woolf’s extraordinary novels, as well as a number of her essays and other writings. We will discuss things both tiny (such as the comma) and vast (such as human consciousness). We will consider how Woolf draws on the visual arts, her preoccupation with beauty, and the relationship in her novels between memory and identity. Assignments may be creative as well as analytical. Books you will need to buy, all by Woolf: Mrs. Dalloway; To the Lighthouse; The Waves (all HBJ editions); Selected Essays (Oxford World’s Classics); Moments of Being (Harvest); A Writer’s Diary (Harvest). NB: This upper-level English course is cross-listed with Honors, and capped at 15 students. Please register early.\n\nENGL 3840W. Gender and Literature: Contemporary LGBT Writing. MW 12:45 - 2:00 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Robert McRuer.\n\nThis section of Gender and Literature will focus on work by openly LGBT writers from Stonewall (1969) to the present. In the process, we will consider the lesbian feminism and gay male music scene of the 1970s, the coming out novel as it coalesces in the 1980s, the emergence of trans and non-binary writing in the early 1990s into the present. The course will include literature on the AIDS epidemic, on non-urban queer locations, and on the U.S.-Mexican borderlands. The syllabus will include novels, short stories, and nonfiction prose by June Arnold, Andrew Holleran, Audre Lorde, John Fox, Torey Peters, Sarah Schulman, Manuel Muñoz, Jordy Rosenberg, and Garth Greenwell.\n\nENGL 3910. Intro to Disability Studies. R 12:45 - 3:15 PM. 3 Credits. Professor David Mitchell.\n\nSince disability cuts across all social categories of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, and age those who occupy “peripheral embodiments” are approached as products of globally systemic practices of exclusion rather than “faulty” bodies. Pursuing a more expansive range of disabled experiences (racialized, cognitively disabled, psychiatric survivors, queer/trans sexualities, mobility disability, as well as those with non-apparent disabilities) provides access to forms of interdependent living that do not register as viable or even as “life” on the radar of the normative world. In other words, we will collectively seek to understand the world from disability perspectives that experience, critique, and navigate the world as creative acts of non-normative knowledge.\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: Fulfills GenEd Critical Analysis Humanities; ESIA-Humanities; fulfills the mandatory requirement in the Disability Studies micro-minor.\n\nENGL 4220. Advanced Fiction: Screening the Novel. TR 11:10AM - 12:25 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Annie Liontas.\n\nIn this advanced hybrid workshop, students write towards their own novels, building on foundations of craft explored in Intermediate and Advanced Fiction. The class additionally examines exemplary novels and their adaptations in film and media.\n\nEnglish 6120. Advanced Literary Theory: Queer/Crip Wastelands. W 6:10 - 8:00 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Robert McRuer.\n\nQueer/Crip Wastelands is situated at the intersections of contemporary queer theory, disability studies, and ecotheory. Examining the ways in which waste, devastation, and destruction have emerged as the backdrop for our present, the course will begin with a consideration of queer theory’s contestatory relationship with futurity, spotlighting in particular cip/queer responses to the queer antisocial or antifutural thesis. From there, we will consider foundational work in environmental studies and ecotheory before moving to a thick consideration of how crip and queer theorists have intervened in those conversations. We’ll read a wide range of books and essays, including but not limited to work by Rob Nixon, Mark Fisher, Bruno Latour, Stacy Alaimo, Lee Edelman, José Muñoz, J. Jack Halberstam, Eli Clare, Alison Kafer, Anna Tsing, and Amitav Ghosh.\n\nENGL 6350. Nineteenth Century I: Slippery Metaphors and Novel Forms. R 6:10 - 8:00 PM. 3 Credits. Professor Daniel DeWispelare.\n\nThis course invites graduate and advanced undergraduate students who are interested in reading deeply in the global context of nineteenth century literature, a vast body of writing that has bequeathed to contemporary readers enduring innovations in form, metaphor, material culture, and crucially, storytelling. Made up of one part history from below (cf. Rediker), one part study of nineteenth-century publishing and translation history, and one part slow, attentive reading of diverse literary representations, this course will equip students with a wide knowledge of the primary and secondary sources that occupy the center of literary conversation about the period today.\n\nAs a way in, we will highlight formally cleft terms like “revolution” (a continuation of normal orbit, but also, a total remaking of the world), “riot” (a disturbance of the peace and a successful comedic performance), “asylum” (prison and sanctuary), “sensation” (popular hit, lurid trick), “law” (a force of order, the force of the state), “uncanny” (tantalizing, repellent), etc. Readings from Charlotte Smith, Helen Maria Williams, Germaine de Staël, De Quincey, Carlisle, the Brontës, Marx, Collins, Dickens, Darwin, Multatuli, George Elliot, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Lev Tolstoy and Émile Zola will be supplemented by secondary readings by scholars like E.P. Thompson, John Plotz, Sianne Ngai, Anna Kornbluh, Daniel Heller-Roazen, Eugenie Brinkema, and others.\n\nParticipants in this course will also master some of the genres of professional scholarly writing: constructing an abstract, crafting a book review, proffering editorial feedback, compiling varied paratexts, and drafting a scholarly, or public-facing argumentative article, depending on the student’s own interests and professional goals.\n\nENGL 6510. Writing, Race, and Nation: Life Writing and Disability Justice. 3 Credits. Professor Jonathan Hsy.\n\nDisability justice is an intersectional framework, created by queer disabled activists and disabled people of color, which centers communities who experience concurrent systems of oppression (such as racism, ableism, and queer phobia) with the aim of achieving collective liberation. This seminar focuses on contemporary life writing by disabled and/or queer people of color. We will consider how disabled people of color use literary forms and performance genres to challenge Eurocentric conventions of the “memoir” or Bildungsroman and thereby craft new ways of theorizing lived experience and social transformation. We will consider multiple intellectual lineages for disability justice, including intersectional feminism, crip theory, and even psychoanalysis (via queer theory and disidentification). The course focuses primarily on Asian American and Asian diaspora writing in the US, informed by scholarship in allied areas of Black Studies and Latinx Studies. Authors and theorists may include Anne Anlin Cheng (The Melancholy of Race), David L. Eng &amp; Shinhee Han (Racial Melancholia, Racial Disassociation), Cathy Park Hong (Minor Feelings), Shayda Kafai (Crip Kinship), erin Khuê Ninh (Passing for Perfect), James Kyun-Jin Lee (Pedagogies of Woundedness), José Esteban Muñoz (Disidentifications), Sami Schalk (Black Disability Politics), Esmé Weijun Wang (The Collected Schizophrenias), and Alice Wong (Year of the Tiger: An Activist’s Life).\n\nFall 2022\n\nENGL 1000-10. Dean’s Seminar. What’s New About New Play? TR 12:45PM - 02:00PM 3 Credits. Professor Evelyn Schreiber.\n\nThis Dean’s seminar takes advantage of the theater offerings in Washington and asks the question: What is new about new plays? Are contemporary playwrights reworking classical themes or are their works entirely new entities? What themes reappear and how are they presented? The course also considers how classical plays are re-imagined for modern audiences. For example, is a Shakespearean work staged in a different political or social milieu than the original production? Why would directors make these types of artistic decisions? What does it mean for plays to be culturally relevant? Students will consider who attends the theater and who will be in the audience in the future. These questions form a large part of decisions about what plays Artistic Directors select to be produced each year and the nature of those productions. We will read at least three classical plays and three new plays. Attending plays will depend on the status of social distancing in DC and MD. I have arranged with Artistic Directors in DC and elsewhere to have new play readings/rehearsals/performances streamed to us if live performances are not available. Hopefully, if we are all fully vaccinated and boosted, theaters will once again be open for live, in-person performances.\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: This course addresses the G-PAC requirement area of Critical Thinking in the Humanities.\n\nENGL 1000-11. Dean's Seminar: Century Shakespeare. 3 Credits. MW 02:20PM - 03:35PM. Instructor Emily MacLeod.\n\nBy looking at modern performances and adaptations of his plays and reading diverse perspectives on his work from theatre artists and scholars, we will investigate how Shakespeare has evolved as an icon in the four hundred years since his death and how his plays have been used in the past ten years to explore issues of politics (Julius Caesar), race (Othello), gender and sexuality (Twelfth Night), and the pandemic (Richard II).\n\nFulfills GPAC Requirement of Critical Thinking\n\nENGL 1210-13. Introduction to Creative Writing. 3 Credits. MW 09:35AM - 10:50AM. Professor Lisa Page.\n\nThis course is an overview of three genres: poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction. We will study the work of established writers and experiment with form through writing exercises and workshops where students will share original work.\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: This course addresses the G-PAC requirement area of Arts.\n\nENGL 1315: Literature and Financial Imagination. MW 11:10AM - 12:25PM. 3 Credits. Professor Holly Dugan.\n\nIs there a difference between art and economics, between writing well for its own reward and writing for monetary gain? And, if so, can you spot that difference in your own work and in others? In this course, we’ll begin to answer these questions by practicing our skill at observing great writing at its very highest level (deemed by many to be canonical works of literature). We’ll then work towards applying these observations in our own writing. Along the way, we’ll explore different and often competing systems of value, including aesthetic, cultural, political, psychological, and monetary. Some authors, for instance, seem to agree with Le Guin: not everything should be monetized. Others argue the reverse:\n\neverything has a price. Our goal will be to understand not only how these authors stylistically represent the relationship between art and economics but which ones we value the most and why.\n\nTexts include: Utopia, The Hunger Games, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, The Great Gatsby, 1984, How to Get Rich in Rising Asia, and The Wolf of Wall Street\n\nENGL 1320. Literature of the Americas. T 03:30PM - 06:00PM. 3 Credits. Professor David Mitchell\n\nAmerican literature considered in a global framework as writing that probes and spans the boundaries of the nation, connecting the United States to the rest of the Americas and to other parts of the globe.;\n\nENGL 1330. Myths of Britain. TR 09:35AM - 10:50AM. 3 Credits. Professor Daniel DeWispelare.\n\n“Myths of Britain” is an introductory course that invites all students who are interested in cultural artifacts—things like books, music, drama, song, photographs, film, painting, sculpture, and even social media. In particular, we will be reading and consuming works by a diverse array of individuals, past and present, who are associated with, informed by, and often critical of the idea of “Britain,” an idea that casts a long shadow over the present.\n\nIn order to ground our discussion about cultural change and exchange we will consider the idea of “Britain” as a starting point for more general discussions about myth and culture. Because the exportation of the English language has accompanied British and American imperial practice over the past five centuries, British myths and mythmaking have attended the story of anglophone globalization as well as global cultural history itself. Some of the myths that we will track during the semester include, but are not limited to: mythological myths, like those pertaining to Boudica and King Arthur; dramatic myths like those surrounding Shakespeare—“the Bard;” economic myths like those undergirding the work of Adam Smith and the other grandfathers of neoliberalism; ecological myths and imperial myths, which have long provided an alibi for British expansion; and even enduring romantic myths such as one finds in the work nineteenth-century writers, all of which are complicated by changing gender formations. The year is 2020 and so our conversations about culture’s tentacles will be informed by ongoing discussions surrounding the long histories of Brexit, decolonialism, race, gender, class, environmentalism, the cultural now, and, of course, our cultural future. Politics itself being rooted in forms of mythology, the contemporary moment offers a unique opportunity to glimpse a long period of cultural history—it happens that we will be reading, viewing, and discussing works from roughly 50 BCE to the present—while also attending to the specificities of our collective and global now.\n\nCOURSE ATTRIBUTES: This course addresses the G-PAC requirement areas of Humanities and Global or Cross Cultural.\n\nENGL 1360.80. Fantasy and Speculative Fiction: Other Worlds, Other Selves. TR 11:10AM - 12:25PM. 3 Credits. Professor Patricia Chu\n\nHow do modern writers adapt the conventions of fantasy narration and the bildungsroman--the novel of education--to address questions of identity, class, gender, species, social dissent, and desire? We'll explore the connections between f"
