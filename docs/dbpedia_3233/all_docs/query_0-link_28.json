        "text": "Combating an Epidemic, with Rabbi Joy Levitt, Susan Lechter, and Dana Wechsler Linden\n\nIt wasn't just a perceived need. It was a moral imperative. In looking at the JCC's burgeoning population of older adults, it became apparent that cards, trips, and discussion groups weren't just fun, enriching ways to spend time. They were a way station, a way of conquering one of the most insidious epidemics of our time: loneliness. Under the direction of Susan Lechter and thanks to the care and largesse of board member Dana Linden, The Wechsler Center for Modern Aging would come to represent something more than a place for excellent programs. It would be a lifeline, a chance to build connections and community among a group that is too often overlooked in society. In today's episode, joined by Susan and Dana, Rabbi Joy Levitt will discuss the impetus for launching the center — during a pandemic, no less — and how its many facets could change the way we think about getting older.\n\nClick here to learn more about The Wechsler Center for Modern Aging.\n\nAdaptations, with Rabbi Joy Levitt and Shirley Silver\n\nIt took a professionally upsetting and embarrassing incident for Rabbi Joy Levitt to realize how far the JCC, and indeed all Jewish communal agencies, had to go when it came to treating those in its neurodiverse community. But evolve the JCC did, thanks to the largesse and personal knowledge of people like Jack and Shirley Silver, whose Center for Special Needs at the JCC became the home of numerous groundbreaking programs. Among them was Adaptations, a supportive social community for adults in their 20s and 30s that offered individuals with a high level of independence a place to socialize, learn, grow, and deepen their connections to one another through structured social/recreational and employment programs. Thanks to an extraordinary lay-professional partnership, the seeds planted by the Silvers came to provide multiple pathways to fostering independence, finding passion, and experiencing the richness of community.\n\nClick here to learn more about Adaptations at the JCC.\n\nThe Women's Seder, with Rabbi Joy Levitt, Eve Landau, and Barbara Dobkin\n\nMa'yan: The Jewish Women's Project was founded by the JCC in 1993 to serve as a catalyst and a resource for women working for change within the Jewish community. During its existence, Ma'yan promoted Jewish ritual from a new perspective through programs such as its feminist Passover Seder and innovative women's Haggadah, while continuing to focus on advancing the status of womenstatus within the Jewish communal world. In today's episode of 76West, Ma'yan Director Eve Landau and Cofounder Barbara Dobkin join Rabbi Joy Levitt to discuss the origins of the first women's seder, and how the haggadah they developed is still influencing the way we think about the seder today.\n\nNote: this episode contains an excerpt from Debbie Friedman's “Miriam's Song” from her January 1996 performance at Carnegie Hall.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Joseph Stern Center for Social Responsibility at the JCC.\n\nClick here to order the Ma'yan Passover Haggadah.\n\nThe Literacy + Math Tutoring Program, with Rabbi Joy Levitt and Judy Gross\n\nOne of the JCC's original volunteer initiatives, the literacy and math tutoring program has only grown in size, scope, and value in the years since its founding. Under Program Director Judy Gross, it has expanded into more schools, added facets such as having students practice their skills by reading to therapy dogs, and even survived a pandemic. On today's episode of 76West, Gross and Rabbi Joy Levitt discuss the origins of this groundbreaking program and learn about some of the incredible volunteers whose generosity has given the program its heart and soul.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Literacy and Math Tutoring Program at the JCC.\n\nThe Magnificent Meyersons, with Rabbi Joy Levitt and Marti Meyerson\n\nFew families have had as profound an impact on the life of the JCC as the Meyerson-Hooper family. From their earliest days as board members to participants in a full range of family programs and activities to their 2018 decision to name the organization after Marti's mother Marlene, the Meyerson family bestowed an incredible personal and financial gift that will inspire donors and lay leaders for years to come. In today's episode, we learn about how Marti's personal journey brought her to the JCC, and how her family's deep love of the institution led to one of the most consequential moments in the history of the organization.\n\nMakom is a Place, with Rabbi Joy Levitt\n\nToday's episode of 76West begins with Rabbi Joy Levitt's life changing trip to teach Judaism to the Dalai Lama, followed by a silent meditation retreat six years later. As soon as Joy and colleagues had a chance to bring meditation to the Upper West Side, they did so in the form of Makom, a space within the JCC that has become a daily refuge for hundreds since the building opened in 2002.\n\nClick here to learn more about Makom at the JCC.\n\nCordoba House and the JCC, with Rabbi Joy Levitt and Daisy Khan\n\nIn 2009, plans were announced to convert a building in Lower Manhattan into a center for the Muslim community called Cordoba House. Among the leaders of the project were Daisy Khan and her husband Feisal Abdul Rauf, a sufi imam. Khan, a native of Jumma and Kashmir, was the leader of two non-profit organizations, Musilim Leaders of Tomorrow and the Women's Islamic Initiative in Spirituality and Equality. In planning the center, Khan reached out to Rabbi Joy Levitt, then the Executive Director of the JCC in Manhattan, for advice both large and small. What resulted was a friendship that sheltered both through the cultural storm that erupted around the community center, which became known for a brief time as the Ground Zero mosque, due to its overstated proximity to the 9/11 site. In today's episode, we'll hear Joy and Daisy recall that turbulent time, and how one project designed to benefit an entire population blew up as a result of the country's increasing polarization.\n\nClick here to watch Joy and Daisy on This Week with Chistiane Amanpour.\n\nTowels, with Rabbi Joy Levitt\n\nThis week, a story that perfectly encapsulates Rabbi Joy Levitt's tenure. In the first half, she recalls the opening of the JCC's building in January 2002, and a crucial element that was missing at the time. In the second part, she talks about how the young JCC positioned its health club to succeed in a market filled with top-notch competitors.\n\nClick here to learn more about the JCC Health Club.\n\nEmbarking on Jewish Journeys, with Rabbi Joy Levitt and Rabbi Lori Forman-Jacobi\n\nJewish Journeys (which began as the Jewish Journey Project) was designed to revolutionize Jewish education. The initiative has grown and morphed over the years, but its basic premise has remained the same: to ignite each child's spirit, engaging them in activities they love while connecting them with Jewish life and learning. Over the years, Jewish Journeys has brought children together to absorb the concepts, ideas, and traditions that are the building blocks of Jewish life. Under the leadership of Rabbi Lori Forman-Jacobi, it has added a revolutionary online Hebrew learning program and an off-the-bimah B'nai Mitzvah experience. In this episode of 76West, we'll hear Rabbi Joy Levitt discuss the beginnings of Jewish Journeys, and how a simple walk in the woods led to a whole new way of thinking about Jewish education.\n\nClick here to learn more about Jewish Journeys.\n\nThe Other Israel Film Festival, with Rabbi Joy Levitt and Carole Zabar\n\nIn this episode, Rabbi Joy Levitt discusses the birth of the JCC's Other Israel Film Festival with board member Carole Zabar, the namesake of The Carole Zabar Center for Film at the JCC. Founded in 2007, the Other Israel Film Festival presents cinema that inspires conversation, taking an in-depth look into Israeli and Palestinian societies and some of Israel's underrepresented populations. Creating such a festival is a powerful statement for any Jewish organization, but for this JCC, it made perfect sense.\n\nClick here to learn more about the festival.\n\nThe Parkinson's Wellness Program, with Rabbi Joy Levitt, Caroline Kohles, and Dr. Alessandro Di Rocco\n\nThe groundbreaking Edmond J. Safra Parkinson's Wellness Program was founded in 2007 to help improve the lives of those impacted by Parkinson's Disease. Through education, exercise, support groups, and other programs, and in collaboration with the medical and local communities, people impacted by Parkinson's remain active, connected, and empowered. Through a collaboration between the JCC and the Parkinson's Foundation, supported by Northwell Health, the program has grown into a hub for the New York Parkinson's community, and has been adapted nationally. In this episode, we'll hear Rabbi Joy Levitt discuss the founding of the program with two of the driving forces behind it: Caroline Kohles, the JCC's Senior Director of Health and Wellness, and Dr. Alessandro Di Rocco, neurologist and director of Northwell's Movement Disorders Program.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Parkinson's Wellness Program.\n\nShabbat Reimagined, with Rabbi Joy Levitt and Alice Gottesman\n\nAs Rabbi Joy Levitt looked out on the Upper West Side one weekend afternoon, she saw a familiar sight: people going about their lives, trying to fill their time by… spending money. Not everyone was Shabbat observant, but for those who were, or who wanted to be, the JCC devised R&R, a weekly opportunity to be together as a family and a community: an inclusive alternative to the typical New York Saturday. For Friday evenings, there was Shabbat Shabbang, an event designed to welcome the community into the building for a meal, new friends, and fascinating programs. Leading the charge alongside Rabbi Joy Levitt was board member Alice Gottesman, who drew on her own fond childhood memories in supporting both programs. In this conversation, you'll hear Joy and Alice discuss the founding of two programs that came to embody the Jewish values of the Marlene Meyerson JCC Manhattan.\n\nClick here to learn more about Shabbat programming at the JCC.\n\nLeaving the Congregation, with Rabbi Joy Levitt\n\nIn this episode, we'll go back to the beginning, when Rabbi Joy Levitt was a congregational rabbi in Plandome, New York, searching for something more. We'll hear about the forces that acted to bring her to the Upper West Side, before there was a building at 76th and Amsterdam. We'll hear about a restless spirit ready for a second act, ready to take the show on the road. To apply concepts she'd mastered to a hub for a community that was starved for new ideas, new programs, and Jewish life. The JCC of the Upper West Side, as it was known then, wasn't just going to be, in Joy's words, “a gym and a pool.” Joy, alongside the JCC's founders, had a much more expansive vision in mind.\n\nSaturday Morning Community Partners, with Rabbi Joy Levitt and Todd Elkins\n\nIn this episode, Rabbi Joy Levitt speaks with Todd Elkins, the JCC's longtime Chief Health + Wellness Officer, about a program near and dear to their hearts—Saturday Morning Community Partners. The program has served as a lifeline for disadvantaged children around the city, and as a cornerstone of the JCC's values-driven programming for the community.\n\nTo learn more about this program, click here.\n\nThe Photography Exhibit, with Rabbi Joy Levitt\n\nIf you're listening to this in the fall of 2021, and you're not aware, the JCC's Chief Executive Officer, Rabbi Joy Levitt, is retiring at the end of the year. This podcast is for you. If it's sometime past the fall, maybe the spring of 2022, or the winter of 2026, this podcast is for you, too. There's something about stories, and this particular storyteller, that's crucial to understanding what makes—and made—the country's premier JCC tick. What allowed it to go as fast as it did, to build success upon success upon success. Rabbi Joy Levitt isn't—wasn't—just a boss to some of us. She is, was, a spiritual adviser. A relentless “idea person.” A source of endless motivation. And whether you're listening to this before she leaves, or after, there are lessons you can take from it. You can listen to her voice and know there was a strong hand steering the ship at the JCC. There was joy, in Joy.\n\nWelcome to season 5 of 76West, recorded, appropriately, in an office at the corner of West 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. In past years you've heard conversations with some of the great thinkers of our time. This season you're going to hear the voice of one: Rabbi Joy Levitt. Sometimes she'll be by herself, sometimes accompanied by the amazing people who helped make the programs she shepherded a reality. That's by design. Joy works—worked— best in collaboration with others, people who pushed her, prodded, who inspired her as much as she inspired them. That's going to be—is—her legacy to the Marlene Meyerson JCC Manhattan: a spirit of positivity, of moving onward and upward. Taking a simple idea, a Jewish Community Center, and elevating it beyond what anyone would use as their definition.\n\nIn this episode, Rabbi Joy Levitt discusses an eye-opening moment in the JCC's Laurie M. Tisch Gallery, in which an exhibit of the work of photographer Caryl Englander brings about an epiphany for one young family and for Joy."
