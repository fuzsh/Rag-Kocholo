        "text": "My musical journey started back in '94 when my family decided that I needed something 'extra-curricular' in my life so that end up being less of a nerd. Little did they know that music was eventually going to consume my life.\n\nI started with drum set lessons at Chetana Music Academy, a local music school in Thrissur, also known as the 'cultural capital of Kerala'. After my move to Mumbai in 2003, I was involved in professional music as well as the college music scene playing in numerous rock bands.\n\nMight have been serendipity, around this time I discovered jazz and fusion music which was a game-changer and I made my move to Boston, to pursue a Professional Diploma in Music (with a focus on Classical Composition, Percussion Performance, and Electronic Music at Berklee College of Music). During my Berklee days, I had the opportunity to perform with numerous ensembles such as Yuhan Su Trio, Bleep Blop Ensemble, Cloud Ludum, Berklee Percussion Ensemble, and Berklee Indian Ensemble. As a composer, I primarily work in the contemporary classical idiom with a focus on small-form ensembles utilizing electronic as well as acoustic modalities. My compositions have been played by ensembles such as Triple Helix Trio, Zodiac Trio, and GTLork (Georgia Tech Laptop Orchestra).\n\nWith my partner, Ranjani Prabhakar, in 2020, I formed Lil Idli, an avant-pop outfit for which I am the primary music producer. Our first album, Mitochondria, is due for release in early 2022.\n\nYou can find my music on my Soundcloud page.\n\nCheck out videos of myself in performance below!"
