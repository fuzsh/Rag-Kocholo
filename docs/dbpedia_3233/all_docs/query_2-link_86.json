        "text": "TBC is excited to announce its Beginning Band tailored for elementary school students. The program's structure is to ensure maximum learning for beginners.\n\nOnce a week, students will attend sectionals, allowing them to interact with other kids and ask questions.\n\nStudents will also attend a full-ensemble rehearsal to prepare for our annual concerts.\n\nWe provide all students with MakeMusic access, video lessons, music theory quizzes, and playing tests.\n\nThis program is completely FREE for all, but donations are highly encouraged to help us keep this program available. Families who are unable to donate will be asked to volunteer their time instead to help support TBC activities and fundraisers.\n\nTrenton Kozel\n\nSouth Bay Director\n\nTrenton has been in marching bands and played the trumpet for over 10 years. Originally, Trenton is from Santa Maria, California where he was a part of the Orcutt Academy Spartan Marching Band, being appointed as drum major in his senior year. Currently, he studies music education at San Jose State, marches with the San Jose State Spartan Marching Band, coaches band, and gives private lessons throughout the South Bay area.\n\nAlejandro Gallo\n\nSouth Bay Instructor\n\nAlejandro Gallo is a current student of San Jose State University majoring in Music Education (instrumental emphasis) and now entering his fourth year. His journey started in high school where he first picked up the Tuba and fell in love with music. He has since had the great opportunity to explore his comfortability with other instruments and perform with groups such as S.F Nova Allianca (2016-2021) a local Portuguese band, and the Santa Clara Vanguard cadets (19' 20' 22') where he was taught to value self-discipline and hard work. He has also had the opportunity to tutor high school students and works very well with taking a relatable and understanding approach.\n\nSamyuktha Gopinath Lakshmi is a sophomore at Irvington High School. This is her second year in TBC and she plays percussion. Disneyland is her favorite place to visit because she is a huge fan of Disney and loves to go on rides. If she were a time of day she would be late night. This is the best time of day because she enjoys sleeping and relaxing in her comfy bed. If Samyuktha could be any animal, it would be a wolf. Wolves are playful, caring, and very energetic.\n\nArjun Murugappan is a sophomore at Irvington High School. This is his second year in TBC and he plays the tuba and sousaphone. His favorite place is not one, but many of the hiking trails in the Santa Cruz Mountains, because he loves hiking. He usually visits these trails when he is either backpacking with his Boy Scout troop or hiking with this family on the weekends. If he was a time of the day, then he would be early morning (5-7 am). it's the best part of the day because he is very calm during this time and isn't bothered by anyone. At this time, he usually goes out for a jog or catches up on schoolwork. If he could be any animal, he would be a cheetah. Cheetahs are the fastest land animals on Earth, and he wishes that he could be as fast as them\n\nSince 2000, local schools have lost more than 50% of elementary band sections which is now resulting in decreasing enrollment in music programs at the junior high and high schools. A big part of our mission is to build a pipeline for developing musical talent for local schools. We encourage all of our students to take band at their local school through a series of counseling workshops each year. We do our best to maintain the quality and standards our students have come to expect. Additionally, we are providing community service hours for high school students who need these hours to graduate.\n\nSince the beginning TBC has partnered with local music stores to provide instruments to students. We send out flyers on their behalf and encourage all of our students to rent their first instrument until they decide that they are ready to buy a quality instrument. At the moment, we only provide bagpipe chanters as these are not carried by local music shops. In the future, we hope to be able to provide a limited number of free instrument rentals to students from low-income families to allow more students to participate.\n\nWe are growing the number of kids involved in music throughout our community, which has in turn led to a larger number of students seeking professional music instruction. As our teaching program lasts approximately 2 years, we only provide the initial music instruction to get students started on their instruments. We encourage all of our students to seek professional music instruction once they are interested in continuing their instrument. We provide a free listing of local music teachers and send out messages on their behalf to our students. Additionally, we hire local music teachers when possible to provide instruction to our beginning students."
