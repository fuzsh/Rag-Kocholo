        "meta_description": "The South Indian lute, known as the Veena or Saraswati Veena is older than its North Indian cousin, the Sitar. It is an equally eloquent instrument. Two of its finest players (acclaimed as such by cognoscenti in India) live in Melbourne: the brothers Ramnath & Gopinath Iyer. \"Soulful Strings\" is the beautiful new album by the Iyer Brothers & Sridhar Chari, who plays the double-headed Carnatic hand drum, the Mridangam. Although entirely instrumental the music's lyrical, \"vocal\" quality is inescapable.",
