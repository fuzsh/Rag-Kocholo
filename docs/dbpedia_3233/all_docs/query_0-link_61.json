        "text": "LOOKING FOR MUSHROOMS (1959–1967) is a three-minute experimental film by San Francisco–based artist and filmmaker Bruce Conner.1 Conner shot the bulk of its 16mm color footage between 1961 and 1962 while living [End Page 183] in Mexico City, where he temporarily relocated in an effort to escape the persistent threat of nuclear war in the United States. The purported subject of the film is, as its title suggests, a “mushroom hunt,” in which Conner ventured to a rural village in Oaxaca, Mexico, in search of hallucinatory psilocybin mushrooms that Indigenous Mazatec people ingest during shamanistic rituals. Conner was accompanied on at least one of these mushroom-hunting excursions by Timothy Leary, the Harvard psychology professor who, by the mid-1960s, had emerged as the foremost public spokesperson for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Stylistically, the film’s montage is structured by jarringly quick cuts, palimpsest-like superimpositions, and playful graphic and rhythmic matches, which work together to generate visual patterns and a dynamic oscillation between recognition and disorientation. At various points in the film, there are fleeting cameos of a white man in a long trench coat, viewed from behind, which is very likely Leary himself (see Figure 1).2 A few years after his return to San Francisco, Conner completed editing the film in 1967, amid the legendary Summer of Love. He paired it with a soundtrack by the Beatles, “Tomorrow Never Knows” (1966), the lyrics of which were famously inspired by Leary’s writings on psychedelic experience. The final track on the band’s 1966 album Revolver, “Tomorrow Never Knows” employs tape loops and backmasking, disorienting recording techniques that complement and amplify the flickering, kaleidoscopic visual effects of Conner’s montage.\n\nLOOKING FOR MUSHROOMS is an exemplary instance of American underground cinema’s engagement—or more accurately, its direct intersection—with the psychedelic counterculture, but this connection should not be reduced to its more stereotypically psychedelic features, including its enthusiastic references to drug use, visually disorienting style, Beatles soundtrack, and cameos from Leary. This article will argue instead that Conner’s film registers its psychedelia precisely by layering and weaving these elements into first-person, typically ethnographic views of the Indigenous Mazatec inhabitants of its rural Oaxacan setting, which function not just as exotic backdrops to the cinematic trip, but rather as constitutive and defining features of the film’s articulation of an “altered state.” As mentioned, Conner’s journey to the region between 1961 and 1962 was motivated both by drug tourism and his broader investment in existential preservation, in which he relocated to Mexico for a year in an anguished attempt to evade the atomic threat. In this sense, the film’s remote, rural, cross-border setting takes on deeper geopolitical connotations and figures as a refuge from Cold War American ideology and violence. Within the prevailingly formalist discourse on both psychedelic experimental film and expanded cinema, a narrowed focus on stylistic, optical, and aesthetic concerns often risks coming at the expense of cinema’s social, geographic, and historical contexts—pushing to the margins such questions as where, when, and with whom a film was made. Departing from this formalist, apolitical [End Page 184] lens, I instead propose that LOOKING FOR MUSHROOMS’ psychedelic vision hinges on its specific conditions of production—that is, the geographic, historical, cultural, and unequivocally political conditions within and against which this vision was forged.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSitting on the generational precipice between the atomic and psychedelic eras, LOOKING FOR MUSHROOMS attests to both Leary’s and Conner’s investments in a Cold War–infused rhetoric of freedom and control through their common pursuit of a psychic relief from existential anxiety. The film conflates geographic, psychedelic, and artistic freedom, all while positioning Indigenous people and ritual as authenticators of countercultural liberation. The film’s articulation of an altered state also points to a multilayered and reflexive critique of Cold War culture—poised simultaneously against nuclear state power and Learian technocratic programming—but nevertheless founded upon a Cold War adaption of a settler colonial logic of unfettered expansion. Whether framed in terms of expanded consciousness, expanded frontiers, the expanded dome of radioactive fallout, or the emerging discourse of expanded cinema, LOOKING FOR MUSHROOMS points to an intrinsic colonialism embedded within psychedelia, in its casting of the filmmaker in the role of a pioneer—reverberations that only come into focus once we choose to look beyond the dazzling play of forms and recognize real people, places, and events on-screen.\n\nLOOKING FOR MUSHROOMS levies a critique against the Manichaean sensibility of a Cold War American worldview by undertaking multiple, layered border crossings, wherein the artist’s internal, perceptual expansion corresponds to his physical trespass across the southern boundary of the American frontier. This threshold crossing is intensified by the film’s historical coincidence with a uniquely dramatic moment in the theater of the Cold War nuclear crisis, when the bomb threatened to render the United States into a permanently and apocalyptically “altered state.” Viewed against this historical context, the underacknowledged role of alterity and specifically Indigeneity in LOOKING FOR MUSHROOMS lays bare the colonial projections embedded in psychedelia’s rhetoric of threshold crossing “expansion.” In tandem, the film offers a critical reminder that the state (i.e., settler colonial violence, racialized borders) must first be rendered visible before it can be altered—a principle that holds true whether discussing a temporary escape or change of state (i.e., the trip) or its total dismantling and destruction (apocalypse but also revolution). Neither straightforwardly utopian nor dystopian, yet insistently and radically materialist, Conner’s film holds these vying possibilities in tension, restlessly searching, seeking, looking. This sense of restlessness is where the film’s lasting significance as a defining work of auto-critical psychedelic art can be found. [End Page 208]"
