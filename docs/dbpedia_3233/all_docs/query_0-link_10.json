        "text": "The Canadian communications scholar Marshall McLuhan wrote in 1964 that because of media, “the globe is no more than a village.” He believed that the media were creating a worldwide sense of involvement in others’ lives, even over vast distances. Where people formerly might have associated only with people from their immediate communities, television brought into homes the images and voices of unfamiliar people, as well as their music and art. McLuhan called the media “extensions of man,” as if they wired our nervous systems to a network, making our eyes and ears reach further than they ever could before. Having to pay attention to all that input could overwhelm people, but it could also make them feel a new “interdependence with the rest of human society.” These extensions created an uncanny intimacy, even with faraway people: “Everybody in the world has to live in the utmost proximity created by our electric involvement in one another’s lives.” The “global village” is now a cliché, but McLuhan was one of the first to describe how communications media might be changing human social life.1\n\nWould that process of becoming connected “make of the entire globe, and of the human family, a single consciousness?” McLuhan expected that peoples would become more similar as a result of this connectedness and especially that the less powerful would feel pressure to conform. Part of his concern was that the media was already an industry: having rented out our nerve endings to corporations, we are now subject to the input those corporations choose.2 Even as McLuhan thought about profound changes in African and Asian lives, he also believed that global connectedness was “de-Westernizing” people in Europe and North America.\n\nThis intuition corresponds to some of what we already know about how music moves. As we saw in chapter 4, the nature of sound recording and the distribution of those recordings changed a great deal during the 20th century. The Cold War years saw the development of new kinds of media, and individuals and nation-states created new reasons to move music across borders, both Page 152 →personal and political. If we take McLuhan’s ideas seriously, we must consider the possibility that this transformation also made a change in people themselves: in how they think and behave and in their preferences and opinions.\n\nWriting in the 2000s, the anthropologist Thomas de Zengotita tested McLuhan’s theories by observing present-day behavior. De Zengotita’s theory of mediation suggests that people who live in a “mediated” way are indeed different from their “less mediated” forebears.3 Of course, experiences have been mediated by newspapers and books since the invention of printing with movable type (in China around the year 1040; in Europe in the 1420s). The history of mediation goes back much further if we count the circulation of ideas in oral or handwritten forms. Still, de Zengotita and McLuhan argue that with television and other 20th- and 21st-century mass media, we encounter a more complete transformation of what it means to be a person. Here are some of de Zengotita’s key ideas about how mediation affects our experiences.\n\nBeing the recipient of media changes people by sheer flattery. You are constantly addressed, your attention requested, your tastes complimented. Information you want is brought directly to you, hundreds or thousands of times a day, by advertising and other media. All this information seems to be addressed to you, personally. De Zengotita calls the result of this kind of mediation the flattered self. He claims that the flattered self has a kind of god’s-eye view—everything that person might wish is all available, all the time.4 When a person goes looking for some music (say, the examples of Chinese rock music discussed in this book) and for some reason cannot find that music quickly on the internet, it is easy to become annoyed and feel personally thwarted. We have developed expectations that we will be able to get whatever we’re looking for, with only modest effort. That effect is the god’s-eye view. Of course, not everything is equally accessible—it is the appearance and expectation of total accessibility that defines the worldview of the mediated person.\n\nThis appearance of accessibility is grounded in real experiences. We saw in chapter 4 that audio recordings helped make music more accessible: with the introduction of long-playing records in 1948 that trend continued to accelerate. Moreover, in the 1960s air travel became affordable for the first time. It became possible for ordinary people to go somewhere very far away just because it seemed interesting. This kind of travel differs radically from permanent, one-time migrations, in which people frequently have no choice about where to go or whom to interact with. Rather, with all this choice some individuals began to experience culture as a kind of buffet: a musician could sample the music of the world through recordings and travel, borrowing at will.\n\nPage 153 →Another part of being a flattered self is thinking that one’s own opinion should be heard by the world. This effect manifests itself in social media, where people broadcast their opinions and activities publicly, and on television shows in which many people, no matter how badly they sing, have a chance to be heard and judged by millions of listeners. The people who feel directly spoken to by media, and those who always feel free to offer their opinions or judgments in return, are flattered selves. As we will see, many musicians of the generation that came of age between the 1940s and the 1960s believed they had something urgent to communicate through their music: they aimed not merely to entertain or engage their listeners but also to use music as a particular kind of expression that was both personal and political.5\n\nAccording to de Zengotita, the fact that music or food can represent social class or ethnic origin is not unusual. The era of mediation brought a heightened awareness of that representation and frequent opportunities to represent themselves to the world in self-conscious and carefully chosen ways. Heritage, all that is passed down within a family or ethnic group through the generations, still plays a significant role for most people. But the mediated person need not continue in the musical tradition she has inherited. With the increased accessibility of music through a variety of media, and the dazzling array of options for representing oneself, the flattered self makes choices about how she wishes to make music and how she wants to be perceived.\n\nIn the discussion of African American traditions (chapter 3) we saw that some thinkers used the idea of authenticity to emphasize and reify heritage, drawing distinctions between groups of people. This concept of authenticity derived from the purposeful social distinction that separated “folk” from “modern” peoples and presumed a stable connection among people, their habits, and a particular place (“These are real Swedish meatballs”; “This is a genuine Appalachian folk song”). In the case of the African American concert spirituals in the Harlem Renaissance, intellectuals argued about whether concert spirituals were “authentic”—that is, whether a musical practice that showed signs of assimilation truly represented African American heritage or a watered-down, false version of that heritage. Once we are aware of choices and of mediation, the idea of authenticity may lose some of its force. Today, some people would take the perspective that both kinds of performance are valid options—that individuals may choose how to represent themselves through music. This is a highly mediated way of looking at the world. Others might defend the “realness” of boundaries and insist that we can tell true from false, authentic from inauthentic. I will return to these perspectives in my conclusion.6\n\nPage 154 →The identification of styles, habits, or artifacts with a particular ethnic origin, social class, or political issue continues to operate very strongly for mediated people, in that people who feel invested in a certain ethnic group or political issue choose certain styles of music that they think represent them and their cause. But again, this is a choice of representation. The link between the music and other aspects of social identity is not automatic or given at birth, nor does it appear to be limited by geography, nationality, or similar factors. Each mediated individual gets to choose for themselves out of a whole world of available possibilities. Choices about how to present oneself have existed for a very long time, but the vast array of choices and the sense that one is continuously broadcasting those choices seem characteristic of our historical moment.\n\nDe Zengotita points out that deciding whether mediation is good or bad is extremely difficult, because the exact same forces contribute to both the good and the bad aspects. The same global, multinational record companies that enable greater access to diverse cultures may also be accused of causing market pressures that crush the initiatives of small record labels in low-income countries. The borrowing of music may create a meaningful positive relationship, or feel like theft, or both at the same time.7\n\nDe Zengotita is well aware of the fundamental inequity in the world situation that allows some of us to be flattered, mediated selves, while some of us have little or no access to such options and choices. In his terms you have to live in the “real” world all the time if you have no access to the options and choices presented by the “mediated” world. Some people do not have financial resources that enable choice. Some people live under political or military duress and are forced to do things a certain way. Some people are just not tied into the global economy through media, and they might not have access to options. Because the rest of the situation of mediation is ethically murky—it is often hard to decide what is better or worse—the inequity of access seems to be the main aspect of mediation that can be criticized in ethical terms.8\n\nThe examples considered in this chapter connect de Zengotita’s and McLuhan’s theories of mediation with the politics of musical style established during the Cold War. The political pressures that people experienced during that period and the new availability of music through various media combined to shape musicians’ choices. Through recordings and travel US musicians working in the 1960s and thereafter had access to a wide variety of music (providing them with a god’s-eye view of world music). They could choose among a vast Page 155 →array of musical styles, and appropriate one or several of those styles. Crucially, they based their choices on social, political, and ethical considerations—some to assert a sense of connection, some to highlight their personal criticism of the world around them. In all these ways these musicians seem to be the first generation of music-makers to carry the new “mediated” attitude that de Zengotita describes. We will also encounter some US musicians—most of them younger—who, in their own ways, absorbed and extended the lessons of the “mediated generation.”9\n\nGlobalized Generations\n\nAs we saw in the early chapters of this book, musical borrowing, assimilation, or appropriation across lines of power have had stakes both political and personal. In cases where the socially empowered borrow music from the less powerful, appropriation has often felt like disrespect or theft. Those effects persist in the mediated era, yet the wholesale appropriation of styles has also become commonplace and a matter of individual choice. As a large and growing archive of recorded music is available for reuse, and travel and circulation of media have made it possible to know more kinds of music, composers have begun to treat it all as available for their use. Sometimes an element of exoticism plays a role in the selection of music to borrow, but often, as we have seen, the purposeful choice of a style has also served as a form of personal expression, a means of representing oneself and one’s allegiances in a particular way.\n\nIn chapter 8 we will return to the idea of appropriation for the purpose of making blended music. The Argentinian anthropologist Néstor García CancliniPage 179 → describes appropriation of this kind as a creative act of the individual, and he asks us to examine closely the strategic nature of appropriation. What is the borrower trying to accomplish through musical appropriation? Is the composer gaining entry to places or ideas that would otherwise be forbidden? Is the composer developing a personal identity that is meaningful and distinct from peers’ identities? Does the appropriation make this composer seem more modern or more traditional?\n\nWe know that musicians habitually pick up new and fascinating sounds, possess them, and sometimes weave them into their own music-making. For the first mediated generation described in this chapter, borrowing was often a refashioning of identity: rejecting some part of their prior education, composers appropriated music to flag their opinions and affiliations clearly. The next-generation composers discussed above proceeded in various ways. In the tradition of New Music, Benary’s appropriation was absorbed into an abstract musical process, losing its Indonesian associations. Srinivasan and Bryan, like Wilson before them, participate in more than one “home” tradition. Unlike Benary, Bryan and Srinivasan do not conceal their source music, but they do minimize the contrast between traditions, creating a thorough blend. As composers who move between New Music and other traditions, they might use this blending as a means for moving back and forth—or for resolutely standing in the doorway, giving up neither identity in favor of the other."
