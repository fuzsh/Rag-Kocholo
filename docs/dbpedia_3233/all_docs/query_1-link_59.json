However, the mechanisms responsible for such suppression remain poorly understood. Most individual, global suppressors result in small stability enhancements relative to wildtype, which can be combined to yield significant stability increments. We show here that thermodynamic stabilisation is neither necessary nor sufficient for suppressor action. Individual suppressors greatly enhance the foldability of folding defective, loss-of-function mutants, primarily through increase in refolding rate constants and burst phase amplitudes. Similar trends are observed in diverse proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including cytoplasmic and secreted proteins, confirming the generality of these results.",

        "text": "Results\n\nPhenotypic characterisation of putative second-site suppressor mutations in CcdB\n\nPrevious characterisation of a single site saturation mutagenesis (SSM) library of ~1600 CcdB mutants led to the identification of five partial (or) complete loss-of-function mutants, varying in their substitutional patterns of sizes and polarities, and were termed as parent inactive mutants (PIMs), (namely,V5F, V18W, V20F, L36A and L83S) [8,11,12]. Second-site saturation mutagenesis libraries, generated by individually incorporating each PIM into the SSM library, were exhaustively screened for suppressors by checking their GyrA14-binding abilities using the technique of yeast surface display (YSD) coupled to FACS [1]. PIMs bound GyrA14 poorly. Two residues, R10 and E11, located on an exposed loop region far from the site of PIMs, were identified as sites for distal suppressors (Fig 1A). The global suppressor R10G rescued GyrA14-binding defects at all five PIM positions, and increased the apparent Tm by 8°C, relative to WT CcdB but E11R was not characterized [1]. Subsequently, another putative global suppressor S12G was identified by analyzing saturation suppressor libraries using FACS coupled to deep sequencing [13]. S12, located beside R10 and E11 on the exposed loop, is involved in hydrogen bonding with the cognate antitoxin CcdA (Fig 1A). Phenotypes of the E11R and S12G CcdB mutants were studied here after cloning the mutants both individually and in combination with PIMs into the E. coli expression vector pBAD24, under the control of the PBAD promoter [14]. This allows for tuneable expression with glucose (repressor) and arabinose (inducer). The plasmids were individually transformed into the CcdB-sensitive E.coli Top10pJAT strain. The cells were grown at different concentrations of glucose and arabinose [8,12] to allow increasing levels of CcdB expression. Mutant phenotypes were studied as a function of varying repressor (glucose) and inducer (arabinose) concentrations. For WT and the fully active mutants E11R and S12G, the cells fail to grow even at the highest glucose (repressor) concentration (0.2% glucose), because even very low levels of active CcdB result in cell death. The inactive mutants grow even at higher concentrations of arabinose (7×10−5% arabinose). In the background of the E11R or S12G suppressor mutations, with the exception of V18W-S12G, the WT-like phenotype of the remaining (PIM, suppressor) pairs is restored at lower glucose concentrations (≤0.2%), leading to cell death (Fig 1B).\n\n(A) Experimentally obtained inactive mutants and distal suppressors mapped onto the crystal structure of dimeric CcdB (PDB ID 3VUB [71]). The distal suppressors at R10, E11and S12, are mapped on an exposed loop region while the PIMs at V5, V18, V20, L36 and L83 are present in the core of the protein. (B) In-vivo activity of the PIMs at 37°C in the background of the suppressors E11R and S12G. The condition where growth ceased was reported as the active condition. Four representative conditions are shown. G100T, an inactive CcdB mutant, and thioredoxin (TRX) are used as controls, which grow in all the repressor/inducer conditions. (C) Equilibrium GdnCl denaturation profiles using nanoDSF are shown. The experimental data are shown in symbols, while the fits are shown in solid lines. (D) The difference in thermal stability, ΔTm (in cyan), and thermodynamic stability assayed by chemical denaturation, ΔΔG° (in grey) of the different CcdB mutants. The error bars wherever shown represent the standard deviation from two independent experiments, each performed in duplicates. Numerical values are listed in S1 and S2 Tables.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010334.g001\n\nTo examine the relative in vivo solubility levels (proxy for folded functional forms of proteins), E. coli strain Top10GyrA was individually transformed with each mutant. The solubilities of the PIMs were significantly lower than that of WT CcdB and suppressors E11R and S12G (S1 Table). However, the solubilities of the inactive mutants in the background of the suppressors were significantly enhanced (S1A Fig). These results reveal that lowered activity and decrease in solubility of the inactive proteins are both improved in the background of the suppressors.\n\nEnhancement of thermal and chemical stability of multiple inactive mutants by global suppressors\n\nThe purified proteins (4 μM) were subjected to thermal denaturation using nanoDSF and the apparent Tm was calculated (Fig 1D). S12G had a 2°C higher Tm, indicating that the mutation is stabilising (S1 Table). Further the inactive mutant-suppressor pairs showed increased apparent thermal stabilities (~5–12°C) relative to the inactive mutants. The ability of the purified proteins to bind to CcdA peptide (8 μM) was also examined by monitoring thermal denaturation using binding of Sypro orange dye [15], both in the absence and presence of CcdA peptide (45–72). Relative to the free proteins, apparent Tm’s of the CcdA-bound complexes showed increments (S1B Fig) due to stability-enhancements of the proteins in the presence of peptide [1].\n\nEquilibrium unfolding experiments for the CcdB mutants were carried out by nanoDSF. The data were fitted to N2↔2D unfolding models for homo-dimeric CcdB as described [14,16]. The fraction unfolded of different CcdB mutants (200 mM HEPES, pH 8.4) in the presence of GdnCl is plotted as a function of denaturant concentration (Fig 1C). The midpoint of chemical denaturation (Cm), ΔG0 and m-values were measured for all the CcdB mutants (S2 Table). The suppressor S12G alone is 0.8 kcal/mol more stable than the WT, and the double mutants are apparently 2.5–5.0 kcal/mol more stable than the inactive mutants (Fig 1D). The significant difference in the apparent effect of the suppressor in the context of PIM relative to WT, is likely due to the high tendency of inactive mutants to aggregate over time thereby reducing the amount of functionally folded form. Surprisingly, E11R is 3.1 kcal/mol less stable than WT as assayed by chemical denaturation studies and has a Tm 2°C lower than WT but still acts as a global suppressor.\n\nSuppressor substitutions accelerate the refolding rate and reduce the unfolding rate of the WT and multiple inactive mutants\n\nRefolding and unfolding kinetics for CcdB mutants were also monitored by time-course fluorescence spectroscopy at 25°C using nanoDSF [16]. Refolding was performed at pH 8.4, at final GdnCl concentrations ranging from 0.5 M-1.5 M. During refolding, the two monomers rapidly associate in a diffusion limited process [17]. Refolding for the WT occurs with a fast and a slow phase as observed earlier [17]. The suppressors E11R and S12G refold at faster rates compared to the WT. Relative to the WT, the inactive mutants refold slowly, whereas their refolding rates were enhanced (both fast and slow phase) in the background of the suppressor (Fig 2A, S3 Table). The fast phase of refolding for L83S-E11R could not be captured owing to its fast refolding kinetics. The noise associated with refolding kinetics of L36A-S12G in the presence of 1 M GdnCl is due to the faster kinetics of refolding and high dead time of about ~15 seconds associated with the instrument.\n\n(A) CcdB proteins exhibit biphasic refolding kinetics with a fast and slow phase whereas (B) unfolding of CcdB proteins follows single exponential kinetics. The experimental kinetic traces obtained at different GdnCl concentrations are shown in black, while the fits are shown in red. (C) Interaction between native (black), native protein in GdnCl (grey) and refolded (white) CcdB mutant proteins and labeled GyrA14 analyzed by MST. (D) The difference in apparent thermal melting temperatures for native proteins in GdnCl (cyan), and refolded proteins (grey). The error bars wherever shown represent the standard deviation from two independent experiments, each performed in duplicates. (E) Binding of 500 nM WT and mutant CcdB to immobilised GyrA14 measured by passing the same concentrations of the analyte (CcdB proteins), after heat stress at two different temperature (40 and 80°C), followed by cooling back to 25°C. A room temperature control (25°C) was also used. The residual active fraction was calculated as described in the materials section. (F) The SEC profiles of a few of the CcdB mutants are shown. The PIM L36A shows aggregation as well as degradation as compared to the WT, and E11R and S12G suppressors. The L36A-S12G has a similar profile like the WT and S12G. Kinetic parameters from the fits are listed in S3 Table and values extrapolated to zero denaturant are listed in S4 Table.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010334.g002\n\nThe unfolding trace of WT CcdB when fitted to the three-parameter unfolding equation, gives a fitted unfolding rate of 0.05 s-1. S12G shows a much slower rate of unfolding. For all the PIMs, we observed very fast unfolding even at low GdnCl concentrations, whereas the mutant-suppressor pairs had slower unfolding rates relative to the individual PIMs, though typically faster than the rates for WT and the suppressors E11R and S12G (Fig 2B, S3 Table). Refolding and unfolding reactions were carried out at three different GdnCl concentrations and the observed rate constants and m values were plotted as a function of GdnCl concentration (S2 Fig, S4 Table). Using this, the refolding rate constants for both fast and slow phases, and unfolding rate constants were calculated at 0 M GdnCl as described previously [16] for relative comparison (S4 Table). These experiments correlate with other results and indicate that the suppressors E11R and S12G have lower to marginally higher thermal stabilities than WT and that all the mutant-suppressor pairs are both kinetically and thermodynamically more stable than the corresponding PIMs.\n\nRescue of activity and stability of refolded CcdB proteins by the global suppressors\n\nMicroscale thermophoresis (MST) was used to measure the binding affinities of fluorescently labeled GyrA14 (used at a fixed concentration of 70 nM) to unlabelled CcdB mutant proteins (native, native in GdnCl and refolded proteins). The obtained data indicates that WT CcdB, S12G and E11R bind GyrA14 with KD’s of about 2.2, 2.3 and 1.2 nM respectively which is consistent with the SPR binding studies (Figs 2C and S3A and S1 Table). Labeled GyrA14 also bound with similar affinity to the native and refolded proteins in 1.5 M GdnCl (Figs 2C and S3B–S3C and S1 Table), indicating that refolding was reversible. The Cm of GyrA14 was determined to be 4.48 M, confirming that it was folded at 1.5 M GdnCl used in the above refolding assay (S3D Fig).\n\nThe refolded CcdB proteins and the native proteins in the presence of 1.5 M GdnCl were also subjected to thermal denaturation, and the apparent Tm was calculated (Fig 2D, S2 Table). The near identicality of the Tm’s for native and refolded proteins, further confirms that the mutants refold reversibly. Except for the PIMs V18W and V20F, all the other mutants showed clear thermal transitions confirming that they were in a folded conformation in the presence of GdnCl. The suppressors improved the Tm of the refolded proteins, relative to the PIMs.\n\nEnhancement of thermal tolerance of the CcdB mutants by the global suppressors\n\nThe binding of purified CcdB mutants to their target GyrA14, was also probed using SPR. WT CcdB, S12G and E11R bind to GyrA14 with KD’s of about 1.4, 2.6 and 2.5 nM respectively (S4 Fig, S1 Table). An increased affinity for DNA Gyrase for the inactive mutant-suppressor pairs was observed in all the cases, consistent with functional rescue. The apparent low affinity of these inactive mutants may also arise due to the inability to correctly estimate the fraction of active protein for these purified mutants. The SEC profile of the PIM L36A, shows a significant amount of aggregation as well as degradation as compared to the WT, suppressor S12G and the double mutant L36A-S12G (Fig 2F). All the SEC experiments were carried out using 100 μg of protein at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. For the other mutants, due to poor yields and high tendency to aggregate, SEC was not performed. Thermal tolerance of E11R, S12G, L36A, L36A-E11R, L36A-S12G and WT CcdB, was also assessed by determining the binding of CcdB proteins to GyrA14 after prolonged heat stress followed by cooling to room temperature (Fig 2E, S2 Table). The S12G mutant retained 4% activity after incubation at 80°C for 1 hour, representing a five-fold improvement over WT, whereas the double mutants L36A-E11R and L36A-S12G showed three-fold and ten-fold improvement over WT respectively. Surprisingly, L36A-E11R had residual activity at 40°C, as compared to E11R alone which lost activity at this temperature.\n\nThermodynamic and kinetic stabilisation mediated by the M182T global suppressor substitution in extended spectrum TEM-1 β-lactamases conferring antibiotic resistance\n\nTEM-1 β-lactamase, a 263 residue monomeric enzyme confers resistance to β-lactam antibiotics [18]. There have been several studies on its stability and folding kinetics making it a suitable system to study the effect of global suppressor substitutions [19,20]. Located far from the active site, M182T, a drug-resistant clinically isolated mutation showing extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) activity, increases protein expression and restores stability defects caused by active-site substitutions [21]. M182T rescues a folding-defective M69I mutant thereby conferring resistance to inhibitors such as clavulanate (Inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases, IRTs), and a core engineered substitution L76N, where L76 has been shown to be sensitive to substitutions [6,22] with M182T being distant from the primary mutation (Fig 3A).\n\n(A) Inactive mutants and distal suppressor M182T mapped onto the crystal structure of TEM-1 (PDB ID 1XPB [76]). The TEM-1 protein is shown in ribbon with the distal suppressor M182T, mapped on an exposed region, while the inactive mutants L76N and M69I are present in the core of the protein.

The error bars wherever shown represent the standard deviation from two independent experiments, each performed in duplicates.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010334.g003\n\nIn the present study, we characterized the global suppressor M182T and observed its effect on stability and folding of known inactive mutants (Fig 3). We determined the MIC and IC90 of the TEM-1 WT, M182T, M69I, M69I-M182T, L76N and L76N-M182T for both ampicillin and cefotaxime, a third-generation cephalosporin (Fig 3B and 3C, S5 Table). In line with a previous study, we found that the M182T suppressor alone and the M69I-M182T double mutant have comparable values to that of the WT [23] and M69I respectively [24], however M182T rescues the activity of the inactive enzyme mutant L76N (Fig 3B and 3C, S5 Table) [22,25]. Further the activity of the purified mutants was monitored in vitro with nitrocefin (Fig 3D). The results obtained showed similar effects of the M182T substitution on WT or M69I or L76N background as observed in vivo (Figs 3D, S5C–S5E).\n\nThe M182T suppressor substitution enhanced both the thermal and chemical stability of the WT protein as well as the inactive mutants M69I and L76N (Fig 3E and 3F, S5 Table), in agreement with previously published results [26]. When compared with WT, M69I and L76N are less stable (Fig 3G). The suppressor alone is 6°C, 1.8 kcal/mol more stable than the WT, and M69I-M182T and L76N-M182T are 7°C, 2 kcal/mol and 8°C, 1.7 kcal/mol more stable than the inactive mutants M69I and L76N respectively (Fig 3G).\n\nRefolding (in 0.5 M GdnCl) and unfolding (in 2.5 M GdnCl) kinetics for all the mutants (5 μM) were also monitored using nanoDSF. M182T shows a slightly slower rate of unfolding whereas the inactive mutants M69I and L76N, had two and three fold faster unfolding rates respectively as compared to the WT. The mutant-suppressor pairs however had a slower rate of unfolding as compared to the individual inactive mutants (Figs 3H and S5B and S5 Table). The refolding rate constants for each of these mutants, were also calculated for both fast and slow phases. The M182T suppressor alone, refolds at a faster rate compared to the WT. The inactive mutants showed slower refolding kinetics than the WT. In the background of the suppressor, however the inactive mutants refold at a faster rate (both fast and slow phase) (Figs 3I and S5A and S5 Table).\n\nThe refolded TEM-1 proteins and the native proteins in the presence of 0.5 M GdnCl were also subjected to thermal denaturation, and the apparent Tm was calculated (Fig 3J and S5 Table) which was similar in both the cases. Except for the inactive mutant L76N, all the other mutants showed a proper transition indicating that they were in a folded conformation in the presence of GdnCl and the Tm of the refolded suppressors were also higher than the corresponding inactive mutants (Fig 3J). Further, lactamase activity of native and refolded proteins, both in 0.5 M GdnCl, monitored by nitrocefin hydrolysis yielded results consistent with the other studies (Figs 3D and S5C–S5E).\n\nThese experiments indicate that the M182T suppressor alone and in the mutant-suppressor pairs (M69I-M182T and L76N-M182T) rescues the folding defects of inactive mutants and confers higher thermodynamic and kinetic stability relative to the inactive mutants. This is in contrast to a previous study [6] which indicated that the L76N-M182T double mutant was destabilized relative to the L76N inactive mutant, despite the fact that the double mutant showed higher activity in vivo. We show that the major contribution to stability mediated by the M182T suppressor substitution is a high refolding rate which allows reversible refolding, even in the background of the inactive mutants.\n\nRescue of common oncogenic mutations by an N239Y global suppressor in p53-DBD\n\n~ 50% of human cancers are associated with structurally- or functionally–defective inactive mutations of p53, a transcription factor acting as tumor suppressor, owing to the thermodynamic instability of its core, the DNA Binding Domain (DBD) [27–30]. Previous studies have identified second-site suppressor mutations in the DBD which could restore the WT p53 functionality [31]. One such suppressor mutation, N239Y in the L3 loop of the DBD, could globally rescue multiple missense mutations located at varying regions of the protein by thermodynamic stabilisation of the inactivated core [29,32]. The activity of two of the destabilising oncogenic mutations, located in the core of the DBD, V143A and V157F, were restored by N239Y [27,29,32,33].\n\nIn the current study, we aimed to obtain mechanistic insight into the N239Y-mediated suppression of the inactivating p53 mutations, V143A and V157F (Fig 4A). The double mutants V143A-N239Y and V157F-N239Y showed enhanced expression in the soluble fraction in vivo in E. coli, relative to their corresponding inactive mutants. WT and N239Y single suppressor mutant showed comparable soluble expression levels and yield (Fig 4B). The inactive mutants, V143A and V157F, owing to their low expression levels and aggregation-prone natures, could not be purified or characterised. N239Y, in isolation and in conjunction with the inactive mutants, marginally enhanced the thermal and chemical stabilities of the WT p53 (Fig 4C and 4D, S6 Table). Relative to the WT protein, the suppressor N239Y alone, and the mutants, V143A-N239Y, V157F-N239Y enhance the apparent thermal stabilities by ~1.3°C, 1°C and 3°C respectively. The N239Y, V143A-N239Y and V157F-N239Y have marginal increments in their thermodynamic stabilities over the WT protein in the range of ~ 0.1–0.4 kcal/mol (Fig 4E).\n\n(A) Inactive mutants and distal suppressor N239Y mapped onto the crystal structure of p53-DBD (PDB ID 2OCJ [77]). The p53-DBD is shown in ribbon with the suppressor N239Y, mapped on an exposed region, while the inactive mutants V143A and V157F are present in the core of the protein.

The error bars wherever shown represent the standard deviation from two independent experiments, each performed in duplicates.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010334.g004\n\nRefolding (in 2 M urea) and unfolding (in 4.4 M urea) kinetics for the WT and mutants were monitored using nanoDSF at 15°C. The unfolding traces, yielded comparable slow-phase unfolding rates for the WT and N239Y proteins (0.003 s-1 and 0.0025 s-1 respectively), whereas the unfolding rates for the double mutants were slightly lower than that for the WT (0.0017 s-1 for V143A-N239Y and 0.0019 s-1 for V157F-N239Y) (Figs 4F and S5G and S6 Table). The fast-phase unfolding rates for the single and double mutants were marginally lower than that for the WT (S6 Table). The refolding traces, yielded slow-phase refolding rates which were remarkably increased by ~20 and ~10 fold for N239Y and V143A-N239Y respectively, relative to the WT. V157F N239Y refolded with a similar slow-phase rate constant, when compared with the WT. With respect to the fast phase, V157F-N239Y refolds faster than the WT by ~ 3.5 fold, whereas the N239Y and V143A-N239Y refold with similar or marginal increments when compared with the WT (Figs 4G and S5F and S6 Table).\n\nThermal denaturation of the refolded p53 proteins, along with the native proteins in 0.5 M urea as controls was carried out (Fig 4H). ~ 3°C increment was observed for the apparent Tm of refolded V157F-N239Y relative to that of the refolded WT, whereas the apparent Tm’s for the refolded proteins of N239Y and V143A-N239Y were similar to that for the refolded WT (Fig 4H, S6 Table).\n\nThus, the N239Y suppressor mutation likely rescues the inactivated destabilised p53 core by marginal enhancement of the thermodynamic and more importantly the kinetic stability of the proteins containing the suppressor, with the largest effect on the refolding rates.\n\nEffects of global suppressor substitutions in the WT background\n\nIn order to further, investigate the role of suppressors on protein stability in the WT background, we performed detailed thermodynamic and kinetic studies of the suppressors alone in CcdB and mRBD proteins (Fig 5). In a recent study employing the PIMs L36A, V18D, V18G and V20G (chosen to span a range of stabilities), several other CcdB suppressor substitutions were also identified using yeast surface display coupled to deep sequencing [13]. In the present study, we selected three such suppressor substitutions, Y8D, V46L and S60E with ΔTm˃3°C (Fig 5A). The purified proteins were subjected to chemical denaturation (Fig 5B). The suppressors Y8D, V46L and the suppressor S60E were ~3 kcal/mol and ~4 kcal/mol respectively more stable than the WT (Fig 5C, S7 Table). The suppressors were also subjected to unfolding (in 4.5 M GdnCl) and refolding (in 2 M GdnCl) kinetic studies. The unfolding rates of the suppressors were 2–2.5 times slower than the WT (Figs 5D and S6B and S8 Table), whereas the fast and slow phase refolding rates of the suppressors were 2–5 times and 9–14 times faster than the WT respectively (Figs 5E and S6A and S8 Table). Further, the proteins were refolded in 1, 2, 3 and 4 M GdnCl and subjected to thermal denaturation. Native protein at the same GdnCl concentrations was used as control (Figs 5F and S6E–S6H). The WT could refold back till 2 M GdnCl, whereas the suppressors Y8D, V46L and suppressor S60E could refold even at 3 and 4 M GdnCl respectively (S6E–S6H Fig). In all cases, the refolded proteins have a broader transition than the native proteins in GdnCl, likely due to the formation of aggregates during refolding.\n\n(A-F) CcdB: (A) The distal suppressors Y8D, V46L, S60E located on an exposed region mapped onto the crystal structure of CcdB (PDB ID 3VUB [71]).

The error bars wherever shown represent the standard deviation from two independent experiments, each performed in duplicates.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010334.g005\n\nNext, we investigated the role of the suppressor substitutions in the context of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 [34]. Using similar saturation suppressor methodology, we recently identified three suppressors of folding defective mutants in this protein [10]. These suppressors, D389E, L390M and P527I are located on the protein surface (Fig 5G). When individually introduced into WT mRBD, they show a ΔTm of ~3°C (Fig 5H) [10]. The suppressors were also subjected to unfolding (in 3 M GdnCl) and refolding (in 0.5 M GdnCl) kinetic studies. The unfolding rates of the suppressors were ~4 times slower than the WT for the fast phases and 2 times slower than the WT for slow phases (Figs 5I and S6D and S8 Table), whereas the refolding rates of the suppressors were 2.5–7 times faster than the WT (Figs 5J and S6C and S8 Table). Further, the proteins were refolded in 0.5, 1, and 2 M GdnCl and subjected to thermal denaturation with native proteins in the same GdnCl concentrations as control (Fig 5K). The WT could refold till 1 M GdnCl, whereas the suppressors D389E, L390M and P527I refolded back to the native state even at 2 M GdnCl (S6I–S6K Figs). The binding of the native proteins, native proteins in 0.5 M GdnCl and refolded proteins in 0.5 M GdnCl with ACE2-hFc neutralizing antibody were also measured using ProteOn (Fig 5L). All the refolded proteins showed binding to the ACE2-hFc, indicating that the proteins were properly refolded back to their functional conformation (S6L–S6O Fig) and that chemical denaturation of RBD was reversible.\n\nStructural insights into stabilization by CcdB suppressor mutants\n\nThe structures of the S12G, V46L and S60E mutants of CcdB were solved to resolutions of 1.63 Å, 1.35 Å and 1.93 Å respectively. (Fig 6).\n\n(A) Composite omit map at residue 12. (B) Structural superposition of WT (3VUB) and S12G monomers, regions displaying deviation are indicated by ⋆.

Regions with large variability are indicated by \"⋆\".\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010334.g006\n\nThe structures of S12G, V46L and S60E (Fig 6A, 6D and 6G) consist of a single chain in the asymmetric unit, with two chloride ions. One of the ions, which is also present in the WT structure 3VUB, interacts electrostatically with H85[Nε2], R86[NH1], H55[N] and is involved in a hydrogen bonding interaction with a symmetry equivalent T7[Oγ1]. The second Cl- ion in S12G interacts with S38[N], R15[NH2] and a water O[220]. Although there is a water molecule at this position in the WT structure (3VUB), addition of a water molecule in S12G results in an unusually low B-factor whereas a Cl- ion fits well without any negative density and a B-factor of 20 Å2. The density for the last residue I101 was not visible in the map for S12G. The electron density map in the region of residues 40–45 for S12G, 43–45 for V46L and 41–42 for S60E was very poor, as a result the side chains could not be fitted. One of the residues in S12G, R40 lies outside but close to the allowed region of the Ramachandran Plot. The mutant structures are very similar to the WT structure (3VUB) with an RMSD of 0.26, 0.39 and 0.39 Å for S12G (Fig 6B), V46L (Fig 6E) and S60E (Fig 6H) respectively.\n\nFor S12G, the variations are mainly in the loop regions between Y8-Y14 and A39-V46, indicated in Fig 6B by stars. There are two water molecules (254 and 228) in S12G in place of the two conformers of S12[OH] of 3VUB (Fig 6C). A cluster of water molecules at a hydrogen bonding distance from G12 stabilizes the loop and anchors it via interactions with the backbone atoms of neighbouring residues (Fig 6C) reducing the average B-factor in this region (Fig 6J). These two water molecules substitute for the hydroxyl group of both the conformers of serine in the WT structure. Since the S12G has an additional Cl- ion, an additional comparison was done with the structure 4VUB (WT CcdB) which has the second Cl- ion in the same position as found in S12G. It was found that although the absolute B-factor of S12G and 4VUB were similar in the 8–12 region and lower than that of 3VUB, it was lowest for S12G in the region 39–46 amongst the three structures. The relative B-factors are very similar in both 3VUB and 4VUB when normalized, so the 3VUB structure was used as a reference.\n\nFor V46L, the loop region A39-V46, exhibits a major deviation from WT CcdB, as indicated in Fig 6E by a star. L46 is involved in a hydrogen-bond interaction with R62 and hydrophobic interactions with M64 (Fig 6F). The hydrogen-bond interactions are formed between the main chain oxygen atom of L46 and side chain nitrogen atoms of R62 (NH1, NH2). The average B-factors of the V46L structure are lower than the WT with the most reductions in the loops 8–14 and 39–46 (Fig 6J).\n\nFor S60E also, the major deviation is in the starred loop region A39-V46 (Fig 6H). E60 is involved in a series of salt-bridge interactions with R48, H55 and R62 (Fig 6I). The salt bridge interactions are formed between the side chain oxygen atoms of E60 (OE1 and OE2) and side chain nitrogen atoms of R48 (NE, NH1), H55 (ND1, NE1) and R62 (NE). There is a change in the orientation of the mobile R48 side chain resulting in salt bridge interactions with E60 (Fig 6I). The S60E mutation has resulted in reduced B-factor differences between the side chain and main chain in many regions, including R48, resulting in overall stabilisation of the structure. The average B-factors of the S60E structure are also lower than the WT with the most reductions in the loops 8–14 and 39–46 (Fig 6J).\n\nEnhanced stability is neither necessary nor sufficient for a mutant to act as a global suppressor\n\nWhile most suppressor mutations described above confer enhanced stability in the WT background, it is not known if all stabilized mutants will act as suppressors. Two such CcdB mutants, L42E and S43T, that enhanced the thermodynamic stability and one mutant M32T that was less thermodynamically stable than WT, similar to E11R were characterised. From our previous studies that have characterised a large number of CcdB mutants by YSD, L42E and S43T were seen to exhibit higher binding than WT and were presumed to be more stable [35]. However, these mutants were not identified as suppressors using YSD [13]. In the same study, M32T was identified as a suppressor [13]. This was surprising as M32 is buried and substitution by a polar residue should be destabilizing. We confirmed this by DSF measurements on purified protein (Fig 7B). We therefore introduced the M32T, L42E and S43T mutations individually in the background of various parent inactive mutants, and the binding to GyrA14 was measured by FACS as described previously [13,35]. It was observed that L42E and S43T failed to enhance the binding to GyrA14 of any of the inactive mutants whereas M32T was able to rescue the folding defect of V20F and L36A inactive mutants (Fig 7A). Next, we characterised the thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the purified M32T, L42E and S43T proteins. We observed that though the thermal and chemical stabilities of L42E and S43T were higher than WT (Fig 7B–7D, S9 Table), the folding kinetic parameters were similar to WT (Fig 7E and 7F, S9 Table). Additionally, although M32T was thermodynamically less stable than WT, it showed faster refolding (Fig 7F, S9 Table), thus indicating that faster refolding rather than enhanced stability is sufficient to rescue folding defects of mutants (Fig 7B–7F). We also measured the thermal stability of the refolded proteins in 1.5 M GdnCl and subjected them to thermal denaturation (Fig 7E, S9 Table). The refolded L42E and S43T proteins had higher thermal stabilities while the refolded M32T had lower thermal stability than the refolded WT protein (Fig 7E, S9 Table). These observations demonstrate that enhanced thermal stability alone is insufficient to confer a global suppressor property to a mutant.\n\n(A) Analysis of yeast cell surface expression and GyrA14 binding of different CcdB mutants and WT.

Previous studies have shown physically interacting residues to coevolve [36] or mutate with substitutions bearing shape or charge complementarities for stability compensation [1]. The location of suppressor mutations may be either spatially proximal or distal from the site of the original mutation but are usually found on the surface [37]. Global suppressors are expected to have a WT like phenotype, when present as single mutants [1]. Some plausible mechanisms responsible for global suppression are: a) improving the foldability of the protein without impacting stability [6], b) increasing global thermodynamic stability [4,38,39] thereby compensating a folding defect caused by an initial destabilising albeit function altering mutation [7,25,40], c) improving the specific activity of the protein, for example through a mutation at a functionally important residue [5].\n\nIn previous studies, we identified several global suppressors of inactivating mutations of the bacterial toxin, CcdB [1,13]. In the present study, we characterised the mechanisms of suppression by the E11R and S12G global suppressors in considerable detail, and extended these studies to four other global suppressors, Y8D, V46L, S60E and M32T. Non active-site, buried mutations typically affect the levels of correctly folded protein [41]. The presence of low levels of active, folded CcdB protein is sufficient to kill the cells and rescue the inactive phenotype caused by the PIMs. This was confirmed in vivo by growth assays and estimation of solubility levels. Equilibrium thermal and chemical denaturation studies reveal a large enhancement in the apparent stability of PIM-suppressor proteins with respect to the PIMs in isolation. Surprisingly, the suppressor mutations E11R and M32T show decreased stability, relative to WT CcdB, and the remaining suppressors show marginal improvements in stability. There is however, a non-additivity of the apparent stabilising effect of E11R and S12G in the presence and absence of the PIM. This might be attributed to the fact that the stability of the PIMs are difficult to measure accurately because of their aggregation-prone nature.\n\nKinetic studies were used to further elucidate the mechanism of action of such distal global suppressors. Several studies have shown the importance of kinetic stability in the evolutionary optimization and regulation of protein function [8,42–44]. Kinetic destabilisation leads to diseases associated with protein misfolding [45,46]. Therefore, a mutation which enhances kinetic stability can be important in both physiological and biopharmaceutical contexts, for example increasing shelf life of monoclonal antibodies and enhancing vaccine immunogenicity [10,47].\n\nRelative to the WT protein, we observe that the increment in the folding rate parameters is typically larger than the decrement in the unfolding rate parameters. This suggests that additional favourable interactions resulting from the mutation are formed prior to the folding transition state, lowering its energy, relative to the unfolded state. In the case of the CcdB S12G, V46L and S60E; β-lactamase M182T and p53 N329Y mutants, for which crystal structures are available, additional non-covalent interactions present, relative to corresponding WT structure are seen. For these CcdB suppressors, the structural changes are complex and unlikely to be predicted from modelling studies.\n\nIn order to understand the role of thermodynamic versus kinetic stability as a criterion for global suppression, we investigated several other CcdB mutants based on their relative thermal stability and ability to act as a suppressor. Similar to E11R, the M32T mutant was also thermodynamically less stable as compared to the WT, but was still able to act as a suppressor (Fig 7). In contrast, L42E and S43T, though more stable than the WT, were unable to suppress the folding defects of the inactive mutants, suggesting that enhanced thermodynamic stability alone is not essential for suppression. Therefore, the findings collectively indicate the role of kinetic stability, in particular an increase in the refolding rate constant as being primarily responsible for the suppressor phenotype.\n\nFor all the mutant variants of all the proteins used in the study, we observe that the native state of a suppressor mutant is not destabilised relative to its wild type counterpart, except for the functionally active CcdB E11R, a charge reversal substitution, and M32T which is a polar substitution at a dimer interface, resulting in mild thermodynamic destabilisation relative to wild type (S1, S2 and S9 Tables). Previous studies have reported that the M182T suppressor mutant in TEM-1 β-lactamase stabilises the enzyme by recruiting newly formed hydrogen bonds mediated by threonine182 and adjacent water molecules [21]. Previous reports have also shown that core-engineered mutations like M69I and L76N destabilise the native state of the lactamase enzyme [6], similar to the low thermodynamic stabilities observed for these inactive mutants in our thermal and chemical denaturation assays (S5 Table). Addition of M182T suppressor mutation to these inactive mutants stabilises their folded states and restores their functional defects (S5 Table).\n\nSimilarly, for the DNA-binding domain of p53, V143A and V157F are core mutations that destabilise the native state of the protein and lead to low expression of soluble functional protein levels (S6 Table). V143A causes perturbations in almost all the residues of the β-sandwich and DNA-binding surface [48]. V157F, one of the strongest destabilising oncogenic mutant, causes side-chain rearrangements in the core of the protein [33]. N239Y, suppressor mutant, stabilises the native state of the protein by introducing new hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen-bonds with water molecules, which were absent in the wild type protein [33]. It can, therefore, be hypothesised that both the destabilised mutants, V143A and V157F, could be functionally rescued and stabilised by the suppressor by stabilisation of their folded states upon introduction of alternative favourable interactions by Y239 in the protein.\n\nOn similar lines, in this study, the crystal structures of CcdB mutants reveal that the suppressors S12G, V46L and S60E possess novel hydrogen-bonds with water molecules or adjacent residues, that were absent in the wild type protein and are likely responsible for stabilisation of the native state of the protein by these suppressors, as described above.\n\nNone of the CcdB suppressor mutations are seen in naturally occurring paralogs. The intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of the cognate antitoxin CcdA, facilitates the rejuvenation of the poisoned Gyrase-CcdB complex by forming a transient ternary complex prior to extracting CcdB from its complex with Gyrase. Most of the identified suppressors are present in the distal loops 8–15 and 39–52 which are directly involved in CcdA binding. The CcdB positions 10, 12 and 46 are involved in CcdA binding and mutations at these positions as well as the nearby E11 residue will affect CcdA interaction and conformation of the CcdA interacting loop from residues 8 to 15 (8YKRESRYR15) (S7 Fig). S60E, though not involved directly in CcdA interaction, alters the conformation and rigidity of the 39–46 loop that contacts CcdA and might therefore affect CcdB function (S7 Fig). V46L also similarly affects the rigidity of the 8–14 and 39–46 loops important for CcdA binding and GyrA14 rejuvenation [49,50]. In CcdB, the E11R and M32T suppressor mutations had lower stability than WT and conversely, the L42E mutant which is more stable than WT, failed to act as a suppressor. These data demonstrate that while most suppressor mutations show small stabilization effects in the WT background, increased stability is neither necessary nor sufficient for global suppressor mutations. In separate studies from our laboratory, it was observed that though the individual suppressor mutations do not greatly alter affinity towards CcdA, mutations at all these positions significantly affected the rejuvenation process [50]. The functional importance of these CcdB residues, explains why the experimentally identified global suppressor mutations are not found in naturally occurring ccdB genes. More detailed assessments of differences in hydrogen-bonding, possible intramolecular interactions between proximal loops and solvent accessibility are shown in S9 Fig and S13 and S14 Tables.\n\nThe suppressors are largely identified in distal loops, far from the inactive mutations which are present in the core. There are various possible explanations. Firstly, the core is well packed, and it may not be easy to find mutations that improve upon this in the context of the wild type protein. In the context of a core PIM, destabilizing effects can be alleviated by proximal suppressors which restore packing/H-bonding, however as discussed previously [1], these will be allele specific, not global suppressors. In contrast to the core, there are fewer constraints for surface residues, especially in flexible loops, hence stabilizing mutations are enriched in such sites. In the specific case of CcdB, the suppressor mutations result in new native-state interactions that stabilize the loop and/or surrounding loops as observed in the current study. This results in overall stabilisation of the protein. Previous studies have also demonstrated that the deletion of a 44–49 omega loop in both wildtype staphylococcal nuclease (E43SNase) and a mutant E43D nuclease (D43SNase), resulted in both increased activity and stability as compared to their respective parent enzymes [51,52].\n\nIn the present work, we focus on protein folding kinetics studied in vitro whereas in vivo, for several proteins, folding occurs co-translationally and/or is assisted by molecular chaperones [53]. How suppressor mutations affect the kinetics and yield of co-translational or chaperone mediated folding/unfolding is beyond the scope of the present work and it is likely that the different proteins studied make use of different chaperone systems and span both cytoplasmic and periplasmic folding compartments. Nevertheless, it is clear from the present studies that acceleration in folding kinetics in vitro is associated with enhanced yield of active protein in vivo whether in the context of E. coli or yeast [13,35]. A previous study from our laboratory, which looked at the effects of overexpression of a number of different chaperones on ccdB mutant phenotypes reported the rescue of inactive, folding defective CcdB mutants which occurred exclusively in the two E. coli strains overexpressing ATP-independent chaperones (SecB and Trigger factor), that act early in in vivo folding and not in the strains overexpressing ATP-dependent chaperones that act in the later stages of the folding pathway [8]. One of the important inferences from this study was that mutational effects on folding, rather than stability, influenced CcdB mutant activity in vivo, consistent with the present results. To date, there have been reports on the detailed investigation of the Hsp70 and Hsp90-mediated stability and activity of p53-DBD [54–56], the GroEL/ES chaperonin system making transient interactions and inhibiting the folding of β-lactamase precursor [57,58], and of a strongly bound complex of the GroEL chaperone with the receptor-binding domain of the SARS CoV2 spike protein [59]. Furthermore, the effect of overexpression of GroEL/ES chaperonin system and the deletion of Lon protease on the fitness of a stabilized mutant L28R in the background of WT and two destabilized mutants P21L, A26T was investigated for the trimethoprim (TMP) resistance of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), where it was observed that the levels of GroEL/ES chaperonins and Lon protease affect the intracellular steady-state concentration of DHFR in a mutation-specific manner and there are complex, epistatic interactions between the three mutations [60]. However, none of the above discuss the effects of suppressor mutations on chaperone mediated folding kinetics.\n\nWe have summarized the effect of the suppressor mutations characterized in the present study on various thermodynamic and kinetic parameters in the background of both WT and inactive mutants (Fig 8, S11 Table). For the PIM/Suppressor pair analysis, we excluded the p53-DBD double mutants since we did not have the corresponding inactive mutants for comparison. Relative to the WT, the individual suppressors have marginal enhancement in thermal stability (ΔTm) and significant changes in the chemical stability (ΔΔG°) (Fig 8A). However, in the background of the inactive mutants, the suppressors cause significant enhancement in both thermal (ΔTm) and chemical stabilities (ΔΔG°) (Fig 8B). One suppressor has a similar rate constant as the WT for the slow phase of refolding and one PIM-suppressor pair has a similar burst phase of refolding as that of the inactive mutant. However, all other suppressors or PIM-suppressor pairs have altered refolding and unfolding kinetics. To further delineate the parameters which are most effected by the suppressor mutations, we calculate the average fold change of each parameter by the suppressor mutations (S11 Table) as follows: 1 where Pavg is the average fold change of a parameter P,\n\nPi is the fold change of that parameter in the background of the suppressor which is or\n\nand n is the number of mutants. A non-parametric Mann Whitney test is performed to show that the mean of the distributions of each of these values of Pi is significantly higher (or lower) than 1 (Fig 8C and 8D, S11 Table) and confirm that enhancement of refolding kinetics by suppressor mutants is statistically significant in the background of both WT and inactive mutations. The data clearly demonstrate that apparent effects of the suppressor mutation are larger in the context of the PIM than in the WT protein. In addition, effects of the suppressor mutation on refolding rate parameters (both burst phase amplitude as well as refolding rate constants) are larger than corresponding changes in unfolding kinetic parameters. Thus, all aspects of refolding are affected, albeit to different extents in different proteins. Destabilizing mutations at buried sites typically slow down the folding process in vitro, we speculate that this also holds true in vivo. In the crowded environment of the cell, this might facilitate off-pathway aggregation. Suppressor mutations that accelerate refolding can counteract this, enhancing the yield of properly folded, functional protein in vivo.\n\n(A-B) Distribution of ΔTm (°C) and ΔΔG° (kcal/mol) (Mean±SEM) for the suppressor mutations in the background of WT (A) or inactive mutants (B). Mann Whitney non-parametric test was performed for each of these parameters to examine if they are significantly different from zero. (C-D) Log2 fold change of various kinetic parameters (Mean±SEM) for the suppressor mutations in the background of WT (C) or inactive mutant (D). Mann Whitney non-parametric test was performed for each of these parameters. The mean of the distributions of the values for each of the parameters are significantly higher than log2(2) for refolding, and lower than log2(2) for unfolding. *, ** and *** indicate values of P < 0.05, < 0.005 and < 0.0005 respectively. ΔΔG° and ΔTm represent the difference in Gibbs free energy and apparent melting temperature Tm for suppressor containing protein relative to the corresponding values for either WT (A) or Parent Inactive Mutant (B). a0, kf1, kf2, A0, ku1, ku2 are the burst phase amplitude for refolding, rate constant of fast phase of refolding, rate constant of slow phase of refolding, amplitude of burst phase of unfolding, rate constant of fast phase of unfolding, and the rate constant of slow phase of unfolding respectively.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010334.g008\n\nThe different parameters of the folding process were individually analysed for all the protein systems used in this study, except for p53 since only one suppressor substitution N239Y was used in the study, and the p53-DBD double mutants could not be used for analysis since we did not have the corresponding inactive mutants for comparison. Upon analysing the nature of refolding transitions, it is clear that proteins belonging to varied classes show different refolding kinetics, wherein mRBD (WT and mutants) shows monophasic refolding, whereas mutants and WT proteins of CcdB, DNA binding domain of p53 and TEM-1 β-lactamase show biphasic refolding. We find for CcdB suppressors, the slow phase of refolding has a significant contribution in rescuing the folding defect and increasing the stability whereas for TEM-1 β-lactamase and mRBD mutants, we find that the suppressors rescue the folding defect by increasing the refolding rate constant of the fast phase (S8 Fig, S12 Table).\n\nFor relatively stable proteins such as CcdB (Tm = 66°C) and mRBD (Tm = 50.4°C) which are not folding defective or aggregation prone, it is not easy to isolate mutants with improved stability, or to screen for suppressors. This can be overcome by first introducing a destabilizing mutation (Parent Inactive Mutation or PIM) into a saturation mutagenesis library, followed by screening for suppressors [1]. We have recently shown that such an approach [10,13] can robustly be used to identify multiple individual suppressor mutations. While each suppressor significantly improves the activity of the PIM, as seen in the present work, these typically have only a small stabilization effect when introduced in the WT background i.e. the apparent stabilization of PIM by suppressor is not quantitatively transferable to WT. Overall, the effects of suppressors on the refolding rate parameters were larger than on the unfolding rate parameters. This was observed across multiple suppressors in multiple proteins, suggesting this to be the primary mechanism through which such suppressors function.\n\nSupporting information\n\nS1 Fig. Enhancement of solubility and stability by the suppressors (related to Fig 1).\n\n(A-B) Solubility and thermal stabilities of CcdB mutants, in presence and absence of the suppressors.
