Unlike Islamic or Christian religions, Hindus do not have One Common Sacred ” GOD-BOOK”. That is because all the knowledge of Hindu religion can not be summed up in one book, however big it would be. Further Hindu religion is not rigid and gives freedom of worship to its followers as it suits them.\n\nIn fact, it is repeatedly said in the scriptures and Vedas that Hindu is not a religion having one God, but it is a way of living, having a liberty for everyone to have his own God. God is only a representation of the indescribable power that controls this universe. What is common in all forms of Gods is the Supreme Authority, as enunciated in the Dashavatara, Ramayan, Mahabharat and Geeta. Every sect can have its own God. You will find that almost every village has its own Gram Devta. Such a kind of liberty to see God in your own way is unique to Hindu Religion. There has never been a force to worship this God or that God. It is worth noting that each one of us has our own God form, different from others, because Hindu Dharma says worship any form, your prayer goes to the Supreme Authority !\n\nOut of the 10 avatars of Vishnu, the most favourite and popular are Shri Ram and Shri Krishna. Indian film makers have made films on these two deities in large numbers. Ramayan describes Shri Ram and Bhagwat Puran and Mahabharat describes Shri Krishna. Characters in Ramayana are less than in Mahabharat. Thus 26 films made on Ramayana are much less than films made on stories of various characters of Mahabharat. Events take place in limited places in Ramayana like Ayodhya, spots of Vanvas and Lanka, whereas Mahabharat events happen at innumerable places from the North to the West of India.\n\nDue to fewer stories in Ramayana there is a restriction on the contents of films made on Ramayana. Most films have similar contents. Prakash Pictures, once upon a time, was famous for making popular films on Ramayana like Bharat Milap-1942 and Ram Rajya-1943. The pair of Sri Ram and Seeta enacted by Prem Adeeb and Shobhana Samarth was so popular taht from 1944 ton 1954 the Calendars adorned these two as Shri Ram and Seeta. They got unprecedented fame all over India.\n\nWhen Prakash Pictures decided to make a last and final film on Ramayana with these two stars, they thought of making some changes in the story, by adding some events which were imaginary and not mentioned in Ramayana. When this film ” Raam Baan”-1948 released it became a resounding flop because the audience outrightly rejected meddling in the original Shri Ram story. It was a bitter lesson and Prakash then moved to making social and musical films to regain its lost prestige.\n\nToday’s film Shri Ram Avtar-1950 had the same problem of sharing the same story all over again. The story of this film was…..\n\nShri Ram Avtar is an Emotional-Religious-Devotional Musical Family Drama Film exceptionally crafted with excellence by W. Garcher. The Story revolves around the life of Lord Rama (the incarnation of Lord Vishnu)- a mighty and kind God born in Ayodhya and sets on the path to rescue Goddess Sita from the Evil Clutches of Ravana from Lanka along with help of his brother Lakshman and Mighty Hanuman- along with his Vanarsena. The Epic battle of Good over Evil is the story of Ramayana, leading to consequences.\n\nThis time the lead pair was Shau Modak ( famous for doing Lord Vishnu’s role in 29 films.) and Ratnamala. The film was directed by W. Garcher. I do not know who he was. He directed the film Ratna Lutari, a silent film in 1933 and then Talkie films like Kala Sawar-1935, Shri Ram Avtar-1950 and Draupadi Vastraharan-1952, besides a Gujarati film Ra Navghan-1948. He also did a small role in today’s film. The cast of the film was Shahu Modak, Ratnamala, Asha Rani, Leela Mishra, Amarnath, Omkar devaskar and many others. Music was by Indravadan Bhatt and songs written by Pt. Shivraj.\n\nOne name from the cast is Leela Mehta. Today’s song is also sung by her. As such she came to Hindi films for a short visit doing and singing for 7 films. She was a Gujarati but did more work in Marathi films. Daughter of Kanhaiyalal Mehta and Indumati, Leela was born on 10-12-1935 at Borivali in Bombay. She was the elder of the two sisters. Due to loss in business, her family shifted first to Ahmedabad and later to Baroda, where they settled. Leela studied in Marathi medium school- New Era Vidyalaya in Baroda. Leela participated in all functions of the school and acted in dramas, much to the annoyance of their social circle. She developed interest in singing after listening to songs by Khursheed and Kananbala. She started learning music despite the resistance from home and others in their society.\n\nV.M.Vyas, the famous Director and a family friend knew about her interest and offered her the main role in the film Ranak Devi-46. She was just 11 year old and did not suit the role, but she was given another role in it. Kokila Balsara aka Nirupa Roy too acted in it as a Debut film.\n\nDue to her father’s death, the family shifted to Bombay and Leela took the responsibility of being the bread earner by acting and singing in dramas and Radio plays. Meanwhile she learnt further music from Prof. Surendra Rao. She started acting and singing in Gujarati films. Ranjit Movietone offered her a big role in the film Gunsundari-48, but since the role needed her to put on a Sleeveless Blouse, she refused that role. Finally, it went to Dulari. She, however, sang songs in that film and they became quite popular in Gujarat.\n\nLeela Mehta had grown up in a Marathi atmosphere and also was educated in Marathi Medium, so her Marathi was very good. She was invited to work in Marathi dramas. She did roles in famous and popular Marathi dramas and also sang songs. From 1950 onwards, she started acting in Gujarati dramas. Meanwhile she used to sing in Hindi films occasionally. In the early 50s, she made very successful foreign trips with her troupe, to do Gujarati dramas and singing concerts.\n\nIn Spite of being successful and acting and singing in Marathi, Hindi and Gujarati films and dramas, her father did not see even one show of hers. This pained her till the end. Leela stayed in a Bungalow in Versova in Bombay. Once it was rumoured that there was a Ghost in it, she immediately left that house and shifted to Dadar. Inadvertently, she forgot to inform the industry about her change of address, and this diminished her demand drastically.\n\nHer mother died in 1972. In 1982, she toured the USA. In 1985, the Marathi Natya Parishad honoured her with a cash award. Till 1992, she acted in Marathi and Gujarati TV serials. In all, Leela acted in 300 Gujarati/Marathi dramas, films and serials.\n\nLeela was bedridden and unable to speak also. Her house was demolished. She was under the care of a close relative, Nitin Dahisariya. Finally, the news came that Leela Mehta expired in September 2019.\n\nLeela Mehta acted in only one Hindi film- Shri Ram Avatar-50. She sang 17 songs in 9 Hindi films, including 2 Unreleased films.\n\nHer Films are Nai Kahani-43 ( 2 songs), Gaurav-47 (1), Namak-47 (1), Pehli Pehchan-47 (2), Gunsundari-48(2), Satyawan Savitri-48..No information, Chocolate-50..No information, Shri Ram Avatar-50 (4) and Hanste Rehna-50 (1). Her unreleased films were, Apradh-48 (3) and Bidhata-48 (1).\n\n( My thanks to Harish Raghuvanshi ji for some information from his book, ‘ Inhe Na Bhulaana’.)\n\nLet us now enjoy the song by Leela Mehta and chorus….\n\nSong- Jhoolo Jhoolo mere laal (Shree Ram Avtaar)(1950) Singer-Leela Mehta, Lyrics-Pt Shivraj, MD-Indravadan Bhatt\n\nchorus\n\nLyrics\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo mere laal\n\ntumhen jhoolaa jhulaayen\n\ntumhen jhoolaa jhulaayen\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\njhoolo Kaushal Kumar\n\ntumhen sakhiyaan jhulaayen\n\ntumhen sakhiyaan jhulaayen\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\ntilak lagaayen kundal pahnaayen\n\ntilak lagaayen kundal pahnaayen\n\nphir se ?? raaja banaayen\n\nphir se ?? raaja banaayen\n\napnee ?? ke nazdeek jaayen\n\napnee ?? ke nazdeek jaayen\n\nmeree aasha ke phool\n\nmere jeewan ke phool\n\n?? bhare\n\n?? bhare\n\nhumko jaanaa na door\n\nhumko jaanaa na door\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo mere laal\n\ntumhen jhoolaa jhulaayen\n\ntumhen jhoolaa jhulaayen\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\njhoolo Kaushal Kumar\n\ntumhen sakhiyaan jhulaayen\n\ntumhen sakhiyaan jhulaayen\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\ndev lok mein ?? raaja\n\ndekh na aaye koi\n\ndev lok mein ?? raaja\n\ndekh na aaye koi\n\nnahin dikhlaaun apna raajaa\n\naa aa aa aa\n\nnahin dikhlaaun apna raajaa\n\nlaakh kare hathh koi\n\nlaakh kare hathh koi\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo mere laal\n\ntumhen jhoolaa jhulaayen\n\ntumhen jhoolaa jhulaayen\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\njhoolo Kaushal Kumar\n\ntumhen sakhiyaan jhulaayen\n\ntumhen sakhiyaan jhulaayen\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nJhoolo Jhoolo\n\nThis article is written by Arunkumar Deshmukh, a fellow enthusiast of Hindi movie music and a contributor to this blog.

The next came in 1957 and the third with the same title was in 1983. In between, another title called Bhakta Dhruv Kumar came in 1964. Going through the Film Title index, one finds that a total of 30 films with titles “Bhakta….” were made from 1934 to 1983. These were mostly different Bhakts like Kabir, Gopal Bhaiyya, Pooran, Soordas, Ramdas etc. Six films were made on Bhakta Prahlad.\n\nEven during the silent era, films on Bhakts were many. Some silent films were on most uncommon names like Laxmidas, Peepaji, Vatsala, Veer, Ramani etc. Maybe these were some specific Bhakts from some regions.\n\nThe point to be noted here is, since the days of stage dramas to Talkie films via silent films, there was a demand for such religious and Mythological films. If you see the pattern of films made from 1913 till today, you will find that in the initial years and till 1960, films on Mythological Stories and religious themes were made because there was a demand and acceptance by the audience.\n\nFrom the 50’s decade Musical films started being made by public demand and this lasted possibly till 1970 end. After that the pattern changed again and the story content became more important. What I see now is that films are having less and less songs and more of a story variety along with personalities and events as the central theme.\n\nThe tastes of the Indian audience changed as people who were initially content with their traditions, values and beliefs started getting exposure to the outside world and new goals, styles of living and ideas were getting imbibed. Comfortable living, independent thinking and less of responsibilities due to small families changed the people to being self centred and selfish. Money became the deciding factor in everything and all that mattered was “I” and ” Me”. Older generation is seeing all this but now they have no say in anything in this materialistic living pattern.\n\nThe film industry is a mirror of society and accordingly makes its presentations. The mythological and religious stories shifted from cinema halls to the Television in the 80’s and the 90’s, but disappeared from even there nowadays. All that now remains in the books alone.\n\nFilm Bhakta Dhruv-1947 was made by Prakash Pictures of the Bhutt family in the days of national turmoil caused by the partition, perhaps to give sentimental support to the believers. It was directed by Shanti Kumar and the music was by an old time expert musician Shankarrao Vyas. There was a time when his music was appreciated but now newer composers were presenting their new style of foot tapping and melodious songs. Vyas and his music could no more cope up with the tastes of the audience. He fell behind and got less and less films. His last film was Ganga maiya-1955.\n\nProf. Shankarrao Vyas (1898-1956) was born in Kolhapur on 23-1-1898. His father Ganeshpant was a well known Keertankar and Puranik! So, he was brought up in a religious and musical environment. Unfortunately, Ganeshpant died when Shankar was seven years old. His paternal uncle brought him up for a few years. His maternal uncle (Mama) noticed his inclination towards music and enrolled him in the ‘gurukul’ of Maharaj (Pandit) Vishnu Digambar Paluskar.\n\nIn those days, students had to sign a bond with the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya. Training period would last 8-10 years and the student would become an all-rounder in every field related to music. Thus, Shankar Rao spent nine years in this gurukul, earned ‘Sangeet Pravin’ degree and gold medal for overall development. With the suggestion of guruji, he worked in Lahore vidyalaya for a few years.\n\nIn 1931, he moved to Ahmedabad to establish a branch of Gandharva Mahavidyalaya. He was an expert not only in vocal music, but could play and repair many instruments including sitar, jaltarang and mendolin. He would conduct an orchestra consisting of Indian and western instruments. He was also a very good composer and wrote several bandishes. He was the key person in planning the music section of national (Rashtriya) schools: an idea originated by Gandhiji in Ahmedabad.\n\nIn 1935, he left Ahmadabad and settled in Bombay. He founded a school for music education at Dadar, just outside the western railway station. ‘Vyas Sangeet Vidyalaya’. It is still functioning at this place. His brother Narayanrao Vyas and brother-in-law Vasantrao Rajopadhye also joined him in this noble cause. Around 1930/31, HMV Company invited both Vyas brothers for recordings and they cut over 200 songs (100 discs) until about 1938. He also cut a few orchestral records under the ‘Vyas Brothers’ banner playing pure classical ragas. These records were best sellers and the company had printed their photographs on record catalogues.\n\nThis period was also the beginning of talkie films. Shankar Rao composed music for Hindi (35), Marathi (5), and Gujrathi (3) films from 1937-1955. His first film as a composer was ‘ His Highness’ -37 and the last was ‘ Baal Ramayan’ -released in 56. He also composed background music for fifteen films. Most of his films were based on religious or mythological themes. He also taught music to non-singing actors such as Sardar Akhtar and Shirin Bano. His most famous musical films were – Narsi Bhagat (1940), Bharat Bhet (1941), Ram Rajya (1943, in Hindi and Marathi). Saraswati Rane sang ‘Beena madhur madhur kachu bol’ in raga Bhimpalasi in Hindi film ‘Ram Rajya’ and this song became popular throughout India. This was the only Hindi film that Gandhiji watched and was very impressed with the music. Songs from Marathi version of ‘Ram Rajya’ viz. ‘Sujanho parisa ramkatha’ and ‘Ladkya raanila lagale dohale’ are shown on TV even today.\n\nAfter the success of films ‘ Narsi Bhagat-40’ and ‘ Bharata Milap-42’, Vyas rode on the Pinnacle of his career with the popularity of Ramrajya songs. Vyas was a very hard working person. Once while recording songs of the film ‘ Vikramaditya’-45, he needed the Echo effect in the song ‘ Om Jai Jai Shankar’. In those days, the recording studios were not equipped with such facilities. Vyas searched and found out a Temple having a big Dome in the obscure suburb Jogeshwari in Bombay and recorded this song in that Temple at 2 am in the midnight when it was very quiet !\n\nRamrajya-43 was the most successful musical film of that era. When Prakash Pictures planned to produce Ramrajya again in 1967, the MD was Vasant Desai. Before recording the film’s first song Desai garlanded the photo of Shankar Rao Vyas and then only started the work, seeking his Blessings. Ramrajya also had the distinction of being the only Hindi film in the world which Mahatma Gandhi saw in his life. It is said that he was pleased with its songs very much.\n\nHe was very busy in many fields as a composer, Principal of his music school, author of articles and bandishes, President of Gandharva Mahavidyalaya and founder editor of ‘Sangeet Kala Vihar’ magazine (founded in 1947) of Vidyalaya that is published even today. He passed away at Ahmedabad on 17-12- 1956. He has sung a couple of abhangs of Saint Tukaram. These are available on HMV records. Record P 13454 published in 1931 has a sweet abhang – ‘Roopi guntale lochan, charani sthiravale mana’.\n\nThe cast of the film Bhakta Dhruv-1947 was Shashi kapoor(sr.), Mrudula, Jeevan, ramesh Sinha,Leela Mishra and many others. Mrudula was a victim of bad luck and wrong contract. She had a 5 year contract with Bombay Talkies. She was the First heroine of Dilip Kumar in the film ” Jwar Bhata”-1944. After the death of Himanshu rai, Bombay talkies was in turmoil with confrontation between Devika Rani and the rebel group led by S. Mukherjee. In this melee, Mrudula was the loser as she had no work and could not work elsewhere due to her contract.Vijay Bhatt of Prakash pictures pleaded for her and Devika Rani allowed her to work in Bhakta Dhruv, as the mother of Balak Dhruv. At the age of just 23 years, she played a mother to 17 year old Shashi kapoor !. Due to this, she lost all chances of becoming a Heroine ever again.\n\nThe story of the film was…..\n\nKing Uttanpada (Ramesh Sinha) left his first wife Suniti ( Mridula ), because she had not given him a son. He married the beautiful Suruchi (Shanta Rin). By coincidence both queens delivered boys at a time. Suniti’s boy was named Dhruv (Shashi kapoor,Sr.) and Suruchi’s son was called Uttam (Master Laxman). Due to the machinations of Suruchi and her evil Dassi Kumati (Leela Mishra), the king drives Suniti and Dhruv from the palace. When Dhruv becomes 8 year old, he comes to know that the king is his father. He goes to the king and introduces himself. The king is happy and makes him sit on his lap. Suruchi sees this. Angrily she removes Dhruv from the lap and throws him out. Humiliated, he returns to his mother and asks who is bigger than the King ? She replies Narayan is bigger than the king. That night, Dhruv goes to the Jungle and starts his Tapasya. Narad muni meets him and guides him. Few years pass and Lord Vishnu appears before Dhruv to grant him his wish. But he does not ask anything, simply smiles with happiness of seeing God. Lord Vishnu grants him a permanent place in the Universe, surrounded by the Saptarshis (The 7 sages), in the sky. Today we call it Dhruv Tara or the North Pole.\n\nToday’s song is sung by Lalita Deulkar, Krishna Ganguly and Chorus. I do not know who Krishna Ganguly was. This is probably a song at the naming ceremony of Dhruv.\n\nSong- Jhoolna jhoolo more pyaare (Bhakt Dhruv)(1947) Singers- Lalita Deulkar, Krishna Ganguly, Lyricist- Pt.

That is such an age that your experience is less and opinions are firm. From the beginning, I liked songs by Shamshad Begum and Kishore kumar. As far as Shamshad was concerned her peak period of songs was 1947 to 1955. Maybe I heard her best songs and that too composed by the top class composers like C.Ramchandra and Naushad. Kishore kumar, of course, was shining from 1952 to 1960. I believe firmly that his best songs were in this period. Many people may not agree to this, but then age makes a lot of difference in likes and dislikes.\n\nI had a collection of songs of Shamshad and at the peak level, I must have had at least 500 to 700 songs. They were collected first on 78 RPM records, then on the tapes, 45 RPM, LPs, Video cassettes, CDs and DVDs.\n\nShamshad was not much educated, but she was the undisputed queen of film songs from the early 40s to the mid 50s. Her senior singers slowly faded out, but she continued first with C.Ramchandra, then Naushad and finally O.P.Nayyar. She started losing the grip from the onset of the 50’s decade. From 1949, C.Ramchandra was infatuated with Lata, Lata and only Lata. Naushad tenderly shifted to Lata, realising that the newer Heroines preferred Lata. Finally when O.P.Nayyar was attracted towards Asha, he started neglecting not only Shamshad but also Geeta Dutt. This was the ‘professional’ approach of of MDs in those days !\n\nCome to think of the reasons why Shamshad lost her ground, I found 2 reasons. One, in early years, the films had a very strong story line and besides lead pair, even other characters were also important. Naturally Shamshad sang for all characters, lead and other dancers, small part players etc. On an average if you see, you will find that about 70% songs were filmed on actors other than the lead pairs.\n\nSecondly, the rising newer Heroines realised that to garner more space and spotlight they must have more songs and not other characters. This resulted in reverse situation and 70 to 80 % songs went to lead Heroines. These heroines now preferred Lata. Lata also very cleverly sang only for heroines. Thus Shamshad lost her ground squarely.\n\nFrom the older lot only Shamshad and Geeta were the last lap runners. Geeta was attached to Guru Dutt films. Shamshad was not preferred now by her earlier supporters C.R., Naushad or Nayyar. She was so gentle, soft and meek that she accepted her defeat too soon. She could have got another 7-8 years, but she chose to lie low. The possessive and dominating attitude of Lata and Asha also hurt her career, but she never fought.\n\nWe all know that Shamshad became famous after she sang songs of Khazanchi-1941, made in Lahore. She came to Bombay when Mehboob khan met her father and she was allowed to come to Bombay to sing for the film Taqdeer-1943. This film was made to launch Jaddan Bai’s daughter Fatima aka Nargis. That time she was just about 14-15 year old. Having done some child roles earlier, she was to make her Debut as an adult Heroine. In one of her interviews, given to our Gajendra Khanna ji, Shamshad described how Mehboob Khan convinced her father….\n\n“It was all thanks to the insistence of Mehboob Khan. He was one of the biggest directors of the time. His films like Jagirdar(1937), Deccan Queen(1936) and Aurat(1940) (which was a milestone) were very popular and some people used to call him Father of Indian Cinema crediting him for his contributions to it. He had heard my songs in Khazanchi and was planning Taqdeer with Motilal and a debutant Nargis as the lead actress. He told his secretary to take my bookings. He told him, Saahab yeh artist book nahi hoti(This artist doesn’t take bookings). He asked him the reason for that. The secretary told him that the singer’s possessive father doesn’t reply and doesn’t let her leave Lahore. Mehboob sahab would not be deterred and he came all the way to Lahore to convince my father.\n\nIt was a really big thing that one of the biggest producer-directors ever came there to get a new singer to sing for his ambitious movie! He told my father, “Yeh abhi chhoti hai. Bologe baith jaao to baith jaayegi, jo kahoge maan legi. Aapne usse kuen ka mendhak banaya hua hai. Woh to samudra ki machchi hai. Samudra mein daaloge to wahaan bhi tairegi. Aap isse ijaazat nahi denge to jab yeh badi hogi to aapko apna career na aage badhne ke liye zimmedaar maanegi.”(She is young now and will do as you say. She is capable of making a mark in the ocean, why do you want to keep her in a well. If you don’t allow her to spread her wings now, she will blame you when she is older).\n\nMy father understood his point and gave permission. Mehboob sahab promised to arrange for a house, car and servant for me which he did. I was offered Rs 300 per song for the movie. I came to Bombay to sing for this movie. All the songs were sung by me and became very popular. I promptly ran away back to Lahore after singing the songs. “\n\nThe film was directed by Mehboob Khan and the music was by Rafiq Ghaznavi. After this film Ghaznavi did only 2 more films, one each in 1945 and 1946 and then he migrated to Pakistan. Shamshad Begum has sung about 1700 songs. The break up is- Hindi film songs-1330, NFS-30, Punjabi film songs- 139, NFS-36, Religious-48, Rajasthani-5,Bhojpuri-3,Tamil-8.\n\nHer maximum songs-154 were in 1949, 146 in 1950, 128 in 1948, 100 in 1946 and later just 19 songs in 1960.She sang her last song in 1981.\n\nShe sang maximum songs with Hansraj Behl-116, Ghulam Hyder-98, Pt.Govindram-86, Ghulam Mohd-82, Naushad-61 and O P Nayyar-38. She considered Naushad and Nayyar as her lucky composers.\n\nShe sang 131 duets with Rafi, 33 with Durrani, 23 with Kishore, 29 with Mukesh and 22 with Chitalkar. She sang 32 duets with Asha Bhosle, 23 with Lata, 11 with Zohrabai and 10 with Geeta Dutt.\n\nShamshad Begum’s songs are immortal, My personal favourite is from Patanga-49- “mere piya gaye Rangoon”, with Chitalkar.\n\nThe cast of the film was Chandramohan, Motilal, Nargis, Jilloobai, Kayam Ali, Ansari, Shirazi, Laddan etc. The Story was by Ghulam Mohd. and screenplay and dialogues were by Agha Jaani Kashmiri.\n\nIt was a lightweight comedy about Justice Gangaprasad (Chandramohan) and a Theatre owner Seth Badriprasad (NM Charlie),who lose their daughter and son in Kumbha Mela (This is where this trend started for future films, especially Manmohan Desai type films) respectively.\n\nThe children are found but exchanged and Gangaprasad brings up Babu (Motilal) as a rich playboy and Badriprasad raises Salma(Nargis) as a dancer in his Theatre. They fall in love, causing a problem of class Difference. This is revealed when their identities are revealed.\n\nFunny thing is Gangaprasad’s wife (Jilloo bai) raises Motilal thinking that he is a Girl. The scene when it is revealed that he is a Boy, is very hilarious.\n\nThere is a song in the film, ’Meri Mata Bharat Mata’, in which Nargis is shown holding a sickle and a cloth bundle, with waving Fields behind her. This reminds us of her role and posters of ‘Mother India’-1957(also a Mehboob Production.)\n\nToday’s song is a video song sung by Shamshad and shot on a very young Nargis. She looks immature, awkward and uncomfortable in doing the dance steps. She is not even lip synching the song properly. Enjoy this 80 year old video song….\n\nSong- Baabu Daroga jee (Taqdeer)(1943) Singer- Shamshad Begum, Lyricist- Anjum Pilibhiti, MD- Rafiq Ghaznavi\n\nLyrics\n\nbaabu daroga jee\n\nkaun kasoor pe dharle sainyya mor\n\nbaabu daroga jee\n\nho baabu daroga jee\n\nkaun kasoor pe dharle sainyya mor\n\nbaabu daroga jee\n\nna koi ka naukar\n\nna koi ka chaakar\n\nna koi ka naukar\n\nna koi ka chaakar\n\nna sainyya mora chor\n\nna sainyya mora chor\n\nmadira kamaata\n\nsadakiya pe suta\n\nsainyya ko dharle mor\n\nmadira kamaata\n\nsadakiya pe suta\n\nsainyya ko dharle mor\n\nbaabu daroga jee\n\nho baabu daroga jee\n\nkaun kasoor pe dharle sainyya mor\n\nbabu daroga jee\n\nbaali umariya beetat jaaye\n\nbaali umariya beetat jaaye\n\nnaahin padat mai ka chain\n\nnaahin padat mai ka chain\n\nchhatiyaan hoon dhhak dhhak bin baanke balma\n\nsainyya ko dai do mor\n\nchhatiya hoon dhhak dhhak bin baanke balma\n\nsainyya ko dai do mor\n\nbaabu daroga jee\n\nhoy baabu daroga jee\n\nkaun kasoor pe dharle sainyya mor\n\nbaabu daroga jee\n\npaanch rupaiyya daroga ko dai hoon\n\npaanch rupaiyya daroga ko dai hoon\n\ndas daihoon kotwaal\n\ndas daihoon kotwaal\n\nbaala jobanwa firangiya ko daihoon\n\nbaala jobanwa firangiya ko daihoon\n\nsainyya ko lai hoon chhudaay\n\nbaala jobanwa firangiya ko daihoon\n\nsainyya ko lai hoon chhudaay\n\nbaabu daroga jee\n\nhoy baabu daroga jee\n\nkaun kasoor pe dharle sainyya mor\n\nbaabu daroga jee\n\nhoy\n\nThis article is written by Arunkumar Deshmukh, a fellow enthusiast of Hindi movie music and a contributor to this blog.

This affected the film industry in India extensively as the majority of Muslim artistes from all the departments of film making lined up for migration. As soon as the final announcement of Partition was made and the date of Independence was announced, the film industry worked extra time to finish the projects on hand before the migration, causing damage to the quality of films made in 1947 in the latter half. Though this resulted in creating a record number of films made in 1947 (181 in Hindi and 100 in other languages), most films could get a release only in 1948.\n\nIt took almost 40 years to cross this record Hindi film number, when 187 films were made in 1985. Contrary to this, the films in other languages recovered almost immediately and more films were made in other languages in 1948 itself than in 1947. When 187 films were made in Hindi in 1985, the number of films in other language was way ahead of Hindi – with 718 films in 1985. This clearly shows that migration of Muslim artistes in Hindi film industry had hit it in a very bad way.\n\nHowever, since there was always a second line of reserves of talented artistes for almost all categories of film making, it did not take much time for the Indian Film Industry to cope up with the situation and continue its normal activities quickly. This was not so in Pakistan which had a borrowed imported talent and hence after the end of career of these artistes, for lack of basic second line back up, the Pakistan film industry never prospered fully.\n\nLuckily, major and big Muslim stars of Indian film industry in all departments had chosen to stay back, it helped the industry prosper together with their own prosperity. Thus the year 1948 saw a marginal drop and made 149 Hindi films of a variety of genres. However, it was noticed that now the stress was on making films underlining the importance of strengthening social traditions like joint family system, honoring old generation, maintaining values of social life, rising against anti social customs etc. A majority films were woven around these themes.\n\nToday’s film ‘Ghar Ki Izzat’ (1948) also stresses the importance and need of sustaining the joint family tradition. Films like ‘ Shaheed’ and ‘Majboor’ reflected the sacrifice of freedom fighters and exit of the British. Uday Shankar’s Ballet film ‘ Kalpana’ was a novelty. It ran for a Silver Jubilee in Bengal, but elsewhere it was a moderate success. Kedar Sharma’s film ‘Suhaag Raat’ promoted inter-caste love. Raj Kapoor started his RK Films, with film ‘Aag’ depicting the young hope of a brighter India. It’s songs became very popular.\n\nOther musical films were ‘Mela’, ‘Pyar Ki Jeet’, ‘Ziddi , ‘Chunariya’, ‘Anokhi Ada’, family drama ‘Grihasthi’, love story ‘Gopinath’, and comedy film ‘Pagdi’ were other successful films. Music Director Husnlal-Bhagatram and Mohd Rafi brought out a 4-part private song “Bapu Ki Amar Kahani“, after the death of Gandhi ji.\n\nThe cast of the film ‘Ghar Ki Izzat’ consisted of Mumtaz Shanti, Jeevan, Dilip Kumar, Manorama, Dixit, Suleiman, Gope, Gulab and others. The film was directed by Ram Daryani. Ram Kamlani, brother of actor Gope sang few songs in this film. The story of this film is….\n\nSeth Chunilal (Dixit) is a rich person. His daughter Radhika (Manorama) has married Chaman (Gope) who is their ‘ghar jamaai‘. He does not work anywhere. Radhika’s mother (Gulab) taunts him every now and then and one day, frustrated Radhika leaves the house along with Chaman. They start an insurance business and prosper in a village nearby. Chunilal’s son Chander (Dilip Kumar) becomes a lawyer. He visits his sister in the village. In same village, lives Roopa (Mumtaz Shanti) with her two brothers (Jeevan and Suleiman).\n\nChander gets introduced to this family, falls in love with Roopa and they get married. Upon coming to the city home, Chander’s mother starts taunting the new bahu on her poverty. Bahu, being adarsh bhartiya naari tolerates everything, but Chander gets frustrated and starts drinking. Sister Radhika and Chaman bring him to their house.\n\nChander’s mother and father start repenting and finally they go to Chander and Roopa, beg their pardon and bring them back with honor. They even call Chander and Radhika, but they refuse to come back, as they have prospered now.\n\nSo, all is well that ends well.\n\nIn the early era, most heroines were uneducated like Meena Shorey – who could not even sign her name. All were not beautiful. I sincerely feel, it is neither talent nor good looks, it is nothing but the ‘luck’ factor, which helps in making a career in films. This explains why good looking, educated 1 or 2 film’s heroes could not sustain themselves for long. Similarly, good looking girls like Vijayalaxmi, Bimla Kumari, Krishnakumari, Tabassum, Yashodhara Katju, Shubha Khote, Shashikala etc could not continue beyond 3-4 films as heroines.\n\nIn the 40s era, Manorama was one such actress. She had good education, beautiful Punjabi looks, fine acting, but she could not go beyond 3 films as heroine and had to contend with side and character roles in all her career. Manorama was born in Lahore on 16-8-1920, as Irene Issac Daniels, from Punjabi father and Irish mother. She took her good looks from her father. While a student, she did some child roles in films from 1926 to 1936 and as an adult, she debuted in Pancholi’s ‘Khazanchi’ (1941). She then acted in ‘Himmat’ (1941), ‘Khandan’ (1942), ‘Zamindar’ (1942), ‘Poonji’ (1943), ‘Panchhi’ (1944), and ‘Patwari’ (1945) in Lahore. Here only she did heroine’s roles in ‘Khamosh Nigahen’, ‘Rehana’ and ‘Shalimar’ – all in 1946. After partition, she migrated to India, but she got only side and character roles.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1947, she got married to Rajan Haksar. After coming to India, shortly, their marriage broke. She had one daughter, Roopa from this marriage. Roopa tried her luck in films in 1970, without much success. Then she got married and got settled.\n\nManorama grew in weight. Now she got comic or vamp roles. She did films like ‘Ghar Ki Izzat’, ‘Johari’, ‘Hanste Aansoo’, ‘Ek Phool Do Mali’, ‘Shor’, ‘Caravan’ etc. In all she acted in 161 films. Her last film was ‘Water’ in 2005. She died on 15-2-2008. She perhaps had one of the longest careers among actresses – from 1926 to 2005, that is a cool 80 years ! Manorama was a highly respected person in the industry. Neetu Singh, Madhuri Dixit, Ram Mohan, Ekta Kapoor and others were her fans. Her famous films were ‘Jhanak Jhanak Paayal Baaje’, ‘Half Ticket’, ‘Budtameez’, and ‘Seeta Aur Geeta’.\n\nFilm ‘Ghar Ki Izzat’ has 11 songs, as per HFGK. 9 songs are already covered. Today’s song is the 10th song. It is a video song, sung by Shamshad Begum and chorus.

Interestingly, there were 45 films having the word ‘ Pyas/Pyasa/Pyasi’ in its title as the first word. I always advocate that when a film is mentioned, for whatever reason, it is absolutely necessary that its year is also mentioned along with the title of the film. In Hindi films, it is a common phenomenon that many films with similar titles are produced in different years. I have quoted many times that a film titled ” Insaf” was produced 7 times in different years. Like the ‘ Same Name Confusion ‘ of film actors, a film itself can be a victim of ‘Same Title Confusion’ if the specific year is not mentioned.\n\nFilm Pyaas-1941 was made by Murli Movietone. Ram Daryani was the producer and the director of this film. In the film industry, Gujarati and Sindhi communities have been very active from the very beginning. This situation lasted till about 1950, after which their presence in the Hindi film industry reduced for many reasons. One reason was that the Gujarati film industry itself started flourishing and the other reason was, these communities entered many new business fields.\n\nRam Daryani ( Ram Kamlani was different, he was the brother of Gope). Ram Daryani was born on 6-12-1915, at Hyderabad, Sindh Province (now in Pakistan). His early education was done in Sindh and for college education he came to Karachi. Due to intense desire to be in the film world, he left studies and joined Eastern Art Production and assisted Moti Gidwani in direction of the film Insaan ya Shaitan-33. But due to family pressure he had to rejoin college. After some time he again left college for good and started working as assistant director for films Prem Pariksha-34 with G R Sethi, Bharat ki Beti-35 with Premankur Attorthy and Yasmin-35 with H K Shivdasani.\n\nHe got his first chance to independently direct the film Baal Hatya aka Khoon E Nahaq-35. In the year 1936, he floated his own company Daryani productions and directed films like Sangdil Samaj-36, Prem Murty-36 and Gentleman Daaku-37, for which his brother K S Daryani wrote the stories. In 1938, brother K S Daryani started Krishna Movietone. Ram Daryani closed his company Daryani productions and directed the film Zamana-38 for krishna Movietone. The film became a Hit and his name became famous.\n\nHe worked for Murli Movietone to direct films like Pyas-41, which celebrated Silver jubilee. His other films were Qurbani-43, Preet-45, Panna Dai-45 and Shravan kumar-46. In all, Ram Daryani directed 23 films. His last film was Chand mere aaja-60. After this he entered the Film Distribution business. Ram Daryani died on 7-9-1993. ( adapted from Filmdom-1946).\n\nThe cast of the film was Snehprabha Pradhan, Ishwar Lal, Nazir, Shameem, Eddie Bilimoria, Gope, Gulab, Shareefa, Majid, Tara bai (sister of Sitara devi and mother of dancer Gopi krishna) and others. The Hero Ishwarlal was also a good singer. ISHWARLAL was born on 9-10-1911 at Ghanghaniya,Kathewar,Gujarat, as Ishwarlal Hariprasad Doshi. He belonged to a Jain family. His father was in the Police department at Kathiawar Agency. His father died when Ishwarlal was just 3 year old and mother raised him. After Matriculation, he completed a Teaching Diploma at the age of 16, but did not get a job as he was underage.He came to Bombay, where his brother had some business, in 1927 to act in films. Ishwarlal was very handsome.\n\nHe got a job in Ranjit Studios.He started with silent films at a salary of Rs. 35 pm.His first Talkie film was Bhutiya Mahal-1932.Then came Char Chakram-32.He started acting and singing in films.Initially he sang only duets.Meanwhile,with Jwalamukhi-36,he became Hero.He sang many songs in Ranjit films,but the records are not available.Those days,not all songs of the film were recorded for commercial purpose.\n\nIn Billi-38,he sang a duet with Ila Devi and Sunita Devi and also in Aaj ka Hindustan.In Ummeed-41,he had a duet with Nurjahan. In Pyaas-41,he sang with S.Pradhan.\n\nIn 1942,for the first time he got solo songs to sing in Fariyaad. In Jabaan,under C.Ramchandra,he sang 7 songs.\n\nSome of his films were-\n\nDiwali,Dheeraj,Chandni,bhola shikar,nadira, sitamgar, Veer Babruvahan, Barrister’s wife, College kanya, Desh dasi, Keemti aansoo, Dil ka daku, Jwalamukhi, Sajni,Dil farosh,Adhuri kahani,Thokar,Holi, pyar,Bansari Lalkar,Chirag, Us paar.\n\nHe worked in Ranjit for 13 years. Then he worked with Prafull pictures, Sun art, Wadia, Hind pictures and Atre Pictures also.\n\nIn 1945, he was the hero of Nurjehan in Badi Maa,but he had no songs, infact his last songs were in Us Paar-1944. His singing stopped completely when Rafi gave him playback in the film Sharbati Aankhen-45.\n\nThen he did character roles in Subhadra,Mahasati tulsi vrinda,Sanskar,Naulakha haar,Khuda ka banda etc.\n\nHe acted in 86 films. He also directed 11 films. He sang 36 songs in 14 films. His last film released was “kahani kismat ki”-73.\n\nHe was married in 1931 to a loyal wife kamalabai. They had no issues. Due to excessive smoking he contracted lung diseases and died on 22-1-1969 in Bombay.\n\nActor Eddie Bilimoria was the brother of actor Dinshaw Bilimoria. Eddie was ‘an accidental actor’, as I call those who came into this line unplanned. Some other well known examples are Ashok Kumar ( he was forced by his brother in law to leave his Lab Technician’s job and become an actor to fill the vacancy created by the exit of a hero, in Bombay Talkies), Motilal (he was just a casual observer of a shooting in Sagar Movietone, when he was offered a role), Ranjan ( he was picked from a Bus queue in Madras, by a producer for doing a film role), Actress Neena (when her husband Mohsin abdulla became bankrupt and producer W.Z.Ahmed offered her a Heroine’s role), Nirupa Roy ( she had just accompanied her husband who was looking for actor’s job, but instead of him, she was offered a film role) and many others.\n\nHow Eddie was dragged into films is very interesting. E.(Eddie or Adi) Billimoria ( 1900-1981) came into film acting by accident. Eddie Billimoria was born in 1900 in Kirkee, a cantonment town near Poona, where his father worked in the ordinance factory. At 13 he ran away to join the railways as a fireman, hoping as many boys do to become an engine driver. Unfortunately, he fell ill and for a change of climate his parents took him to Bombay. There for the first time he saw a film – a silent American film. And it was then as he says, “that my troubles started.”\n\nIn Kirkee he couldn’t see any films as the only cinema hall was meant exclusively for British soldiers. Indians were not allowed. Eddie got around this by becoming a gate-keeper. During his spare time he hung around the projectionist cabin, and one day when the projectionist walked off in a drunken fit, Eddie got his job. Soon he decided to try his luck as a projectionist in Bombay. At nights he slept in the Azad Maidan and during the day he hung around the Excelsior and Empire cinemas hoping for a job. One night his hat, shoes and coat were stolen and Eddie felt the world had come to an end. Seeing the shoeless, coatless, hatless boy “from a good family” a kindly projection equipment dealer offered him a job. After this Eddie demonstrated and installed projection equipment in almost a thousand cinemas all over the country.\n\nOne day, he went to meet his younger brother D.Billimoria ( Dinshaw Billimoria), who had joined the film industry as an actor, in a studio. Both brothers, being Parsis, looked similar. The make-up man of that studio mistook E. for D. Billimoria, without caring about his protests,did his make-up. What’s more, the director immediately gave him a role in that silent movie,”Punjab Mail”-1929 too. Eddie enjoyed this confusion and did what was told. Thus he entered the cinema world. His first film as a Hero was Raj Ramani. He did 7 silent films with Imperial and 10 with Ranjit studios. At Imperial, he met a young man Prithviraj Kapoor, who worked as an extra there. After the arrival of Talkie films, Eddie was Hero in 32 Ranjit films. With actress Madhuri alone he did 15 films. He was called Dev Anand of Stunt films.He was the first Cowboy Hero of India.\n\nThen for some time he was with Paramount owned by Kikubhai Desai. Desai’s sudden death led to the end of Eddie’s career as a leading man. After this he started accepting character roles, but even these were few and far between. Finally, he had to resort to playing an extra in crowd scenes.\n\nAfter 1938, he did character roles and after 1953,as an extra in any film to survive. In old age he did service in a Fridge and A.C. shop. E.Billimoria died on 18-2-1981 in his own flat in Kemps corner, Bombay. He worked in 73 Talkie films, directed 1 film,-Sone ki chidiya-48. He even sang 4 songs in 4 films,as per HFGK. His first Talkie film was Radha Rani or Divine lady-1932 and the last film was Honeymoon-73.( Thanks for some information taken from Cineplot and from the book,”Inhe na bhulana” by Shri Harish Raghuwansh ji ).\n\nThe Music Director of this film was Khemchand Prakash and the songs were by D.N.Madhok. The story of the film Pyas-1941 was…..\n\nSethji’s (Nazir) wife is dying due to TB…according to the evil family doctor (E. Billimoria), who wants to marry his niece( Gulab) to Seth ji. He also tries to kill wife and her child. Sensing this, the wife, Menaka (Sharifa) runs away with the child. She hands over the child to a village mukhiya and dies. Seth ji married the niece of the doctor, who starts extracting money from her.\n\nThe child grows into a big man-Chiman (Ishwarlal) who loves village belle Radha.\n\nOnce Chiman goes to the city and gets to know Seth ji, who employs him. Seth ji’s niece Rupa starts loving him. Once by accident , Chiman comes to know that he is Seth ji’s son. Seth ji is happy and throws a party in which the engagement of Rupa (Shamim) is announced. Chiman is craving for Radha. Radha comes to know about these matters and comes to the city. Rupa realises their true love and sacrifices. Chiman and Radha unite.\n\nToday’s song is a duet of Ishwarlal and Snehprabha Pradhan.

Very surprisingly, it was made in both languages by Circo Production, a film company famous for making Hindi films. Usually, the bilingual-Marathi/Hindi films were made in Poona and Kolhapur by either Shantaram’s Prabhat Films or Master Vinayak’s Huns Pictures at Kolhapur. But then, the owner of the CIRCO (Cine Industries Recording COmpany), Chimanlal Trivedi was a person exclusive in the industry.He produced films taking the best from the industry- actors, directors or the music directors. He floated 5 successful film companies and one stage drama company. He had close relations with the top political leaders of India. After his death, his entire family settled in the USA. Normally, very few articles are written about exclusive producers (who are NOT usual directors). Here is more information on this unique personality.\n\nChimanlal Trivedi, was one of the major filmmakers of the 30s and the 40s decade. He was more a Producer businessman than a Director. While he directed hardly 7 films, he produced close to 50 films- all having A grade actors, directors and composers !\n\nBorn on 19-3-1909 at a village near Anand in Gujarat, he was from a Brahmin family. He did his schooling in Ahmedabad and technical graduation from Baroda. Being an expert in weaving, he took up a job as a weaving Master in Calcutta. Fond of writing, he started writing Dramas, which were staged in Bengal and Gujarat. He was attracted towards Cinema and tried some work in New Theatres. Knowing that the real playing field is Bombay he reached there. He wrote stories for the film Chevrolet-36 and Danger Signal-37 for Mohan pictures.\n\nHe established his own production company CIRCO (Cine Industries Recording COmpany) in 1937. By 1943, he had made 12 films. He preferred not to direct his films, but appointed directors like Mohan Sinha for Laxmi-40, Anuradha-40 and Vanmala-41, Balwant Bhatt for Suhag-40 and Madhusudan-41, A R Kardar for Swami-41 and Nai Duniya-42 and Debki Bose for Apna Ghar-42.\n\nHe had the art of getting the most popular stars for his films like, Prithviraj kapoor, Chandramohan, Durga Khote,Mazhar khan, Bibbo,Surendra, Jairaj, Sitara, Jeevan, Yaqub, Shobhana Samarth, Prem Adeeb, Vishnupant Pagnis,Leela Desai, Pahadi Sanyal, Shanta Apte and many others. Even big directors like Debki Bose,Nitin Bose, Kardar,Mohan Sinha, Sarvottam Badami, Nandlal Jaswantlal,Profull Roy, Sudhir Sen, R S Chaudhary, Phani mujumdar, Balwant Bhatt etc. worked for him. From Prabhat he brought Shanta Apte for Rs.1000 pm, and also Chandramohan, Pagnis and Mazhar khan. His friend Chandulal Shah followed his way and brought K L Saigal from New Theatres !\n\nC L Trivedi was an expert in gathering funds for his films. After CIRCO at Parel, he started Laxmi Productions at Andheri, in 1942. He made mera Gaon,Sharafat,Bhagya Laxmi,Kadambari,Tamanna,Inkaar,Mohabbat,Miss Devi etc. In 1951, it was Supreme Pictures, Trivedi Productions was in 1952, Kala Kendra in 1953 and with Chitra Bharati in 1954, he made 13 films upto 1961. Top Composers like Timir Baran,Ashok Ghosh,Rafiq Gaznavi,K C Dey,Saraswati Devi,Husnlal-Bhagatram and Naushad gave music to his films.\n\nIn the end, he turned to Stage and started Abhinay Bharati. He staged many dramas in Bombay and Gujarat. Chimanlal always went for big names. He had close relations with Nehru, Menon, Morarji Desai, and other National leaders. His wife Kantaben was a Leader herself. Chimanlal Trivedi died on 25-11-1973. His wife, 3 sons and a daughter settled in the USA.\n\nIt may be a coincidence, but Gujarati businessmen like Chimanlal Trivedi, Chimanlal Desai,Chimanlal Luhar, Chaturbhuj Doshi, Chimankant Desai, Chunibhai Desai and Chandulal Shah made sizable contribution to Hindi cinema in the first 20 years of the Talkie era. All names started with CH ! (Thanks to Harish Raghuwanshi ji for his book ” बॉलिवूडमा गुजरातीयो ” in Gujarati for some information and my notes.)\n\nIndian film industry has always been alive to the happenings in the country and reflects the national problems and important events in our films.1942 was a year when the II World War was on its peak and it had caused a severe food shortage in the world. Italy had made a silent film ‘Greed’ on this issue. Based on it.Mehboob Khan made a film , Roti’ in India. Mehboob was a socialist and a Nehruvian to the core and so his films like,Mother India or Son Of India were made on socialist principles. In 1942,Ramchandra Thakur also directed one such film,’Gareeb’.\n\nIn India, the Congress had started its Quit India movement, but in our Film Industry it was a Quit studio movement in 1942. Many well known film artistes, directors, composers and other related staff moved over to new pastures. 1942, in a sense, became an overhauling of the Film industry with so much movement of people. The following activities changed the scenario to a great extent.\n\n1. A group of disgruntled people in Bombay Talkies, comprising of Rai Bahadur Chunilal, Shashadhar Mukherjee, Ashok Kumar, Sawak Vachha and few of their followers left Bombay Talkies, after disagreements with Devika Rani and formed their own outfit – Filmistan.\n\n2. Mehboob Khan separated from National studios and established his own Mehboob Productions. This was also the time when Mehboob and Anil Biswas separated from each other due to some differences and misunderstandings.\n\n3. Abdul Rasheed Kardar established his own Kardar studios.\n\n4. V.Shantaram, along with his team left Prabhat- an institution which he established and made a famous one by his directorial contribution. He first joined Films division and then started his own Raj Kamal Kala Mandir.\n\n5. Wadia Movietone split and the brothers separated. While JBH Wadia, the elder brother, wanted that their company should start making only Social films now, the younger Homi Wadia wanted to continue with Stunt and Action films. He started his own Basant Pictures. Wadia’s star performer Fearless Nadia went with Homi Wadia, whom she married a few years later.\n\n6. Calcutta’s New Theatres started showing signs of disintegration and Debki Bose,P C Barua etc left the New Theatres. Debaki Bose made ‘ Apna Ghar’ in Bombay. K L Saigal left New Theatres to do films in Bombay . He did Ranjit’s’ Bhakta Surdas’ and ‘ Bhanwra’. He of course went back to Calcutta to do a few more films,before coming back to Bombay for Shahjehan and Pawana. He did not/could not go back to Calcutta,as he died after Parwana-47. Saigal, while recording the song ” Nainheen ko raah dikha” in Bhakta Surdas, did 14 retakes in recordings. His younger brother Mohan Saigal acted as Shri krishna in this film and he is heard saying” Surdas ji” in the song Nis Din barsat Nain hamare.\n\n7. Composer Vasant Desai did his first independent film ” Shobha” as a Music Director.\n\n8. C Ramchandra did his first Hindi film as a composer- Sukhi Jeevan.\n\n9. Ninu Mujumdar became MD with the film Black Out.\n\n10. Kamal Dasgupta started his Hindi career with the film Jawab.\n\n11. Lyricist Ramesh Gupta started with the film Awaz.\n\n12. Lyricist Qamar Jalalabadi started with Zamindar\n\n13. Suraiya entered the Playback with songs in Nai Duniya and Sharda.\n\n14. Hemant Kumar sang his first Hindi song in the film Meenakshi-42.\n\n15. Manna Dey first sang a Hindi song in the film Tamanna.\n\n16. Jagmohan Sursagar sang in the first Hindi film-Bhakta Kabir.\n\n17. Nurjahan sang her first Hindi film songs in film Khandan-42, in Lahore.\n\n18. Bharat Bhushan’s first film in a leading role was Bhakt Kabir\n\n19. Madhubala started as Baby Mumtaz in film Basant\n\nFrom Lahore Dalsukh Pancholi repeated his magic with ‘ Khandaan’-42. This time it was Noorjehan who shook the industry with her songs under Ghulam Haider. Films like Bhakt Kabir,Bhakta Surdas, and Bharat Milap kept the Mythology/religious films in limelight. New Theatres,Prabhat,Bombay Talkies etc all brought excellent films in 1942. Barring Bhakta Surdas,Roti and Khandan,there was not much competition to Naushad’s Station Master-42 ,in music. Its music became quite popular and the film celebrated the Silver Jubilee. Naushad tasted success for the first time in his career in 1942 and 2 of his 3 films in the year celebrated Silver Jubilees. The other film was Nai Duniya-42.\n\nLet us take a look at some important films of 1942….\n\nFilm Barat had music by Ratanlal-brother of Khemchand Prakash and himself as Khemraj.\n\nFilm Basant- though it has the name of Pannalal Ghosh as MD, as per HFGK, all the songs were composed by Anil Biswas (because he was still under contract with National Studios) and Ghosh had only done Orchestration and background music.\n\nBhakta Kabir had music by Himangshu Dutt- the first title holder of ” Sursagar”.\n\nBhakta Surdas- Gyan Dutt gave 15 hit songs of Saigal and Khursheed. In this film Khursheed sang equally well with Saigal.\n\nBharat Milap- First film in which Prem Adib and Shobhana Samarth did the roles of Shri Ram and Seeta, which made them famous all over India.\n\nChauranghee- the only Hindi film for which Kazi Nazrul Islam gave music and wrote songs too. It was his debut film. Also Debut for Hanuman prasad Sharma as MD and S.Fazli as Director.\n\nDus Baje- Debut of Baby Shakuntala.\n\nIqrar- Last film of actress Madhuri (Beryl Classen). Master Vithal-a professional singer from Sholapur sang his only song in a Hindi film.( not the actor)\n\nJawab- all songs popular, especially kanan devi’s ” Ye duniya Toofan mail”.\n\nKhandan- Entry of Nur jahan, from Lahore. All her songs were popular.\n\nMuqabala- First Talkie film with double role of Heroine- Nadia. Babubhai Mistry’s magic in trick scenes.\n\nNai Duniya- Suraiy’s first song in Hindi film.\n\nRoti- Begum Akhtar’s role and 6 songs.\n\nSavera- First film of Arun Ahuja and Nirmala Devi.\n\nSharada- Naushad gives good songs.\n\nStation Master- Hit film with songs.\n\nZamindar- Shanta Apte goes to Lahore all the way\n\nAll in all, the year 1942 was an eventful year for the industry. Indian audiences enjoyed a variety of Genres in film offerings and a feast of Naushad’s songs, Bhajans and New artistes.\n\nThe cast of the film Apna Ghar was Shanta Apte, Chandra Mohan, Jagdish Sethi, Maya Banerjee, Nimbalkar, Jeevan, Maruti etc. The Music Director was Harishchandra Bali. The film’s story, as adapted from the Film India Magazine, by our Sadanand Kamath ji, a few years ago, is….\n\nNarendra (Chandramohan) has turned recluse after the accidental death of his wife. With his self-imposed isolation from society, he develops individualism and loses sight of emotional values of life. Over a period of time, the inherent goodness in him gets lost and he becomes stubborn in his approach to life.\n\nOne day, Narendra, on one of his visits to the city, accidentally meets Meera (Shanta Apte), a social worker and the daughter of an old and infirm father. Some arguments ensue between them over the charges levelled against her father for committing some fraud in the company for which he works. Narendra happens to be one of the directors of that company. The father is asked to give up all his possessions to make good the fraud. The demand makes him sick and he is on his deathbed.\n\nRealising the sacrifices her father made in bringing her up and to help her father to die as a happy man, Meera agrees to marry Narendra. Since the marriage was more of a bargain than for love for each other, differences in views come to the fore. Meera is a strong willed girl having definite views on life. Narendra also has uncompromising views on life which he has developed after living in isolation. The married life of Narendra and Meera, therefore, becomes a clash of egos.\n\nAt this stage, Mami (Vimla Vashisht), Narendra’s maternal aunt joins the family and creates more problems for the couple. At the same time, on a social front, Meera is on a collision course with Narendra when she encourages the local villagers to resist Narendra’s autocratic orders instead of meekly following them. With strong arm tactics, Narendra crushes the villagers’ rebellion. Many such skirmishes take place between Meera and Narendra as clashes between social worker versus director of the company which create friction in their married life.\n\nMeera is expecting her first child and she is in a delicate condition. Narendra on the other hand has gone to the city for his medical check-up. Meera delivers a boy and the news makes Narendra leave his medical check halfway to be with Meera. But the circumstances make him unable to see his infant child. He suspects a conspiracy to keep him away from the new born son.\n\nMeera becomes a tool in the hands of Mami who creates an impression that the child should be kept away from the evil eyes of Narendra who is eager to see his infant child. One day, Narendra rushes to the house and demands for the child to be handed over to him at gunpoint. Being afraid that her child would be shot, Meera hands over the child to Narendra. Having lost respect for her husband, she runs out of the house leaving the child at the mercy of Narendra. While crossing the river, she accidentally falls in the river and is presumed dead. The fact is that she is saved by some fishermen and she is staying at a place some miles away from the house.\n\nThe child soon gets ill and Narendra, with his insensitivity embedded in his nature, is not able to judge the seriousness of the situation. The child is now seriously ill and on the last stage before death snatches him away. At this juncture, Narendra gets the news that Meera is alive and living a few miles away from his house. With news of the illness of the child reaching her, she rushes home only to get the news that her child is no more.\n\nMeera refuses to believe that her child is dead. She holds the child and walks in the room the entire night. When the doctor comes to the house in the morning to take the child away from her, he finds the child to be alive. A mother’s faith has created the miracle.\n\nHaving found the child hale and hearty, Meera prepares to leave the house. But the husband and wife have now found a common ground to live together – the well-being of their child and the work for the social upliftment of downtrodden and deprived people, some of whom had saved Meera from drowning.\n\nThe film’s Heroine, Shanta Apte was a firebrand woman. She not only staged a Dharna/ hunger strike at the gates of Prabhat film company, but also ensured enough publicity to her protest against the company’s injustice to its artistes through their contracts.\n\nShe was also the one who went to the Editor of the magazine Film India-Baburao Patel’s office and beat him with a cane for publishing a defamatory news article about her in his magazine. I remember, in earlier years another firebrand actress Miss Zohra Jaan, beat her director with Chappals, on the sets of shooting and in presence of other actors and staff, for his insulting remarks on her, during the shooting.\n\nShanta Apte was the first to sing all songs of this film. She had written her autobiography in Marathi titled ” जाऊ मी सिनेमात ?” ( Should I join films ?), in the late 40’s when she left films and started acting in stage dramas. Recently her daughter Nayna Apte got it reprinted and all 1000 copies were sold within 15 days. I somehow managed to get one copy for me. It is a prized possession for me now, just like the only English book ” Bombay- The birthplace of Indian Films” by Isaq Mujawar, who wrote 26 books in Marathi, on old films. I have one copy of this book too.\n\nToday’s song, needless to mention, is sung by Shanta Apte.\n\nSong- Wo nahin hai apna Ghar (Apna Ghar)(1942) Singer- Shanta Apte, Lyricist- Pt.
