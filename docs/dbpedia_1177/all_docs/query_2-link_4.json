        "text": "Judith Sheindlin (born October 21, 1942), better known as Judge Judy, is an American lawyer, judge, television personality and author. She passed the New York Bar examination in 1965 and became a prosecutor in the family court system. In 1976, Mayor Ed Koch appointed her a judge, first in criminal court and later, in 1980, as Manhattan's supervising family court judge. She was featured on CBS's 60 Minutes in the 1990s as a result of her reputation as a tough judge.\n\nSince retiring in 1996, Sheindlin has garnered much fame for presiding over her own syndicated courtroom show, Judge Judy. The show's ratings have consistently ranked among the top daytime television programs."
