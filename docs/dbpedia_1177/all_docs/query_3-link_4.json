Mark Raper SJ\n\nPresident\n\nJesuit Conference of Asia Pacific\n\nDespite vast differences between Christianity and Buddhism, and a variety of traditions within each, their points of similarity are fascinating and their study can be immensely fruitful, as this collection of studies reveals. For Christians (indeed for each of the religions in the Abrahamic tradition) a personal God who is engaged in mankind’s story is central. Belief in a personal God may not be central to the Buddha’s teachings. For Buddhists and Christians what is common is the human journey, and the desire to assist each person’s own path to inner conversion and spiritual maturity.\n\nThe essays in this anthology do not represent a comprehensive overview of either Buddhism or Christianity, but rather they are reflections personal to each author. They are the fruit of a group of Christian, for the most part Jesuit, scholars of Buddhism, who live in various parts of Asia and who meet each year to share their experiences of engaging in dialogue with Buddhists and with the way of the Buddha, as it is lived in contemporary Asia.\n\nIn order that this conversation may be shared and reach others, we offer these studies by way of invitation, in the spirit of hospitality, gratitude and joy, common to both the Buddhist and Christian traditions. The venerable Gautama bids everyone welcome. He is congenial, conciliatory, not supercilious, and accessible to all, while Christ himself has declared, “Come to me all you who labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you.”\n\nBoth the Buddha and Jesus outline a path of detachment from self, and encourage compassion towards others. In that way, instead of centering on self, they urge us to create energy through giving fully in mercy towards others. Both are concerned with how we can live our daily lives and deal with our desires and experiences of love and hate, fear and sorrow, pride and passion, struggle and defeat.\n\nWe respect how the lives and customs of millions of people, especially in Asia, are guided by the Buddha’s teachings. Through history, religion is at times exploited as a factor in conflicts. Asia is no stranger to this phenomenon. The names of the Buddha or Jesus can be exploited for political or material ends. This unacceptable reality only makes a deeper study of the true teaching more urgently needed.\n\nThich Nhat Han has written that whenever Buddhists and Christians who meditate and practice mindfulness come together, Jesus and the Buddha are in conversation. We hope that this collection of accounts will help to further this conversation at many levels.\n\nMark Raper SJ\n\nOctober 2015\n\n[Back to Table of Contents]\n\nEditor’s Note and Introduction\n\nBy\n\nCyril Veliath, SJ\n\nAlthough it was the Jesuit Conference of the Asia Pacific that sponsored the publication of this book, yet I must nonetheless insist that right from the very outset, the Jesuit Buddhist scholars of the Asia Pacific Conference have worked in collaboration with their counterparts of the South Asian Conference, and have in consequence grown deeply indebted to them in a multitude of ways. Here special mention should be made of Fr. Aloysius Pieris of Sri Lanka, Fr. Noel Sheth and Fr. Eucharist Lawrence Soosai of India, and Fr. Gregory Sharkey of the New England Jesuit Province, who is currently associated with the work of Buddhist Christian dialogue in Nepal.\n\nThis book is the outcome of decisions taken at a meeting of the Asia Pacific Conference which at the time was referred to as the Jesuit Conference of East Asia and Oceania) that was held in Manila in 2009. At that meeting the value of dialogue with Buddhism was underscored, and with a view to evoking a keener interest in Buddhism among our younger generation of Jesuits, a decision was taken to organize a workshop on Buddhist Christian dialogue in the city of Chiang Mai in Thailand. This workshop was subsequently conducted at the Seven Fountains Spirituality Center in Chiang Mai from April (23-24), 2010, and the participants who included Fr. Mark Raper were ten in number, including two from India.\n\nThe success of this workshop proved to be the start. In the ensuing years, similar workshops were conducted in Sri Lanka, Japan, Nepal, and China, and currently preparations are underway to hold the workshop for 2015 in Bodhgaya in India, the city where the Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment. In all these workshops the participants presented scholarly papers, engaged in fruitful discussions with Buddhist monks and believers, visited temples and other historical sites, and in general amplified greatly their horizons regarding inter-religious dialogue. The number of our participants too has since then witnessed a sharp increase. Currently a total of 56 individuals are recipients of our communications, and not all are Jesuits. They include a Korean Christian clergyman, namely, the Reverend Yong Un Choe, and a Buddhist Nun from China, the Venerable Cetana. It is my earnest hope that ever more of our younger people, both Jesuits and non-Jesuits, come to realize the significance and worth of the study of Buddhism, a religion that constitutes the principal faith of the vast majority of the inhabitants of East and Southeast Asia. While estimates may vary concerning the exact number of Buddhists in the world, they are in general believed to constitute 6% of the world’s population, thereby making Buddhism the world’s fourth largest religion in terms of numbers.\n\nThe authors of the ensuing articles hail from a wide diversity of nations and provinces, both Asian and non-Asian. They are individuals who have devoted their lives to imbibing the teachings of love and harmony of the Lord Buddha, teachings that more often than not are in perfect accord with those of our Lord Jesus Christ. I shall in the following paragraphs present a brief description of each of them, in conformity with the order in which their articles appear in this publication.\n\nFr. Jerry Cusumano obtained a doctorate in Counseling Psychology from Arizona State University in 1990, after which he taught counseling in the Department of Psychology of Sophia University until 2015. He also served as Director of the Student Counseling Center from 1991 to 2008. In Japan he is licensed as a Clinical Psychologist (Rinsho Shinri Shi) and Industrial Counselor (Sangyo Counselor). He has practiced Zen since 1977 under the direction of the Roshi (Yamada Koun, Kubota Ji’un, Yamada Ryoun) of the Sanbô Kyôdan (re-named Sanbo-Zen in 2015), and he has also been directing the Zen group of the Arirang Free Institute in Korea once a year since 1995.\n\nFr. Thierry Jean Robouam lectures on Philosophy and Comparative Religion at Sophia University (both in the undergraduate and graduate sections), and also teaches a course on: Religious Encounters: “A Buddhist perspective,” for the Graduate program at Koyasan University. He received his doctorate from the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley in the field of Experiential Theology on Buddhist and Christian dialogue, and recently translated a book of the Acharya Ryojun Shionuma, who is known in Japan due to his having completed during the past ten years two of the most difficult practices of the Shugendo tradition, namely the One-thousand Days Trekking Practice on Mt. Omine and the Four-fold Renouncing Practice. Fr. Robouam’s research focuses on the esoteric traditions of contemporary Japanese Buddhism and their responses to globalization, and he is especially keen on revealing alternate models to neo-liberal capitalism using Mahayana Buddhist pedagogy, in order to discover in entangled structures the silent potential for transformation and liberation. His research does not focus solely on elitist Buddhism as he pays much attention to the practices of lay Buddhists as well, and hence we have his presentation of Buddhist Shingon prayers in this publication.\n\nFr. Yuichi Tsunoda is a Japanese priest and member of the Japan Jesuit Province. He studied philosophy at Sophia University in Tokyo prior to entering the Society of Jesus, and his chief interest now lies in Shin-Buddhism, a Japanese form of Pure Land Buddhism. He entered the Society of Jesus in 2005, and in the course of his early Jesuit formation he acquired a keen interest in Christology, and particularly in the Hypostatic Union of Jesus Christ. He currently studies systematic theology in the STD program at the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley, USA, and in the course of his forthcoming doctoral research he hopes to elucidate new perspectives on the Hypostatic Union, that may emerge from dialogue with the Buddha Body theory of Shin Buddhism.\n\nFr. Joseph Ng Swee Chun is a Malaysian Jesuit whose faith conviction could be described as “being religious inter-religiously.” He completed a year’s research in the Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies at the University of Kelaniya in Sri Lanka, and his thesis for his Licentiate in Sacred Theology (STL) was entitled: “Aloysius Pieris’ Two-edged Liberative Theology of En-religionization: A Contribution to Asian Theology and a Mystico-Prophetic Theology Today.” Although his chief interest lies in the psycho-spiritual and mystico-prophetic dimensions of all religions, yet as a Chinese he sensed within himself a natural affinity for Zen Buddhism, and he hopes to see the creation of a Chinese-inculturated Spiritual Exercises, inspired by the gifts of the Spirit as witnessed in the depths of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. He earned a Postgraduate Diploma in Buddhist Studies in Sri Lanka (2009), a Master’s degree in Buddhism at the Centre of Buddhist Studies of the University of Hong Kong (2011), and currently pursues a Ph.D. in the same centre, with a focus on the concept of the Buddha-Nature: Contribution of Chinese Buddhism to Positive Anthropology, Universal Soteriology and Engaged Spirituality. The topic of his research is entitled: The Twofold “Surplus of Meaning” of the Polyvalent Concept of the Buddha-nature: Its Optimal Development in Chinese Buddhism and Its Ethico-Soteriological Efficacy in Contemporary Exigencies for a Transformative Spirituality.\n\nFr. Christian Cochini received his doctorate in theology Magna cum Laude from the Catholic Institute of Paris in 1969, before a jury presided over by the late Cardinal Jean Daniélou. He studied Chinese in Taiwan from 1961 to 1963, and taught French at the Guangdong Foreign Language Institute (now Guangdong University of Foreign Studies) during the years 1973-74 and 1986-90. From 1991 to 2001 he served as Director of the Jesuit China Center in Tokyo, a socio-pastoral institute that seeks to assist the Chinese people living in Japan. He was a member of the Macau Ricci Institute from 2002 to 2007, during which period he undertook a survey of the main Buddhist Temples in the People’s Republic of China. He currently lives in Hong Kong and China, and works for interreligious dialogue with Chinese Buddhist communities. The French edition of his “Guide des Temples Bouddhistes de Chine” was published in April 2008 by Les Indes Savantes in Paris, (704 pp.), followed by the English edition in 2009 by the Macau Ricci Institute. In March 2015 the Bayard Publishing House in Paris issued a French edition of his new book entitled, “50 grands maîtres du Bouddhisme chinois,” and the English edition of this book is due to appear next September, as a publication of the Macau Ricci Institute.\n\nFr. Thierry Meynard is currently a professor and doctoral director in the department of philosophy at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, China, where he teaches Western Philosophy and Latin Classics. He is also Vice-director of the Archives for the Introduction of Western Knowledge at Sun Yat-Sen University. During the years 2012 to 2014, he was director of the Beijing Center for Chinese Studies, a program established by the Jesuits in 1998, and he still supervises the research activities at the center. In 2003 he obtained his Ph.D. in Philosophy at Peking University, where he presented a thesis on Liang Shuming. From 2003 to 2006 he taught philosophy at Fordham University in New York, and since 2006 he has been a member of the Macau Ricci Institute. He has authored twenty academic articles and dozens of essays. He has also authored, The Jesuit Reading of Confucius (Brill, 201), The Religious Philosophy of Liang Shuming (Boston: Brill, 2011), Confucius Sinarum Philosophus (Rome: IHSI, 2011), Following the Footsteps of the Jesuits in Beijing (St Louis: Jesuit Sources, 2006), and he has co-authored with Sher-shiueh Li, Jesuit Chreia in Late Ming China (Bern: Peter Lang: 2014). He also edited, Matteo Ricci, Le sens réel de « Seigneur du Ciel » (Paris, Bibliothèque Chinoise, Belles Lettres, 2013), and Teilhard and the Future of Humanity (New York: Fordham University Press, 2006).\n\nFr. Bernard Senécal (Sŏ Myŏngwŏn 徐明源) is the Director of the Institute for the Study of Religion and Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at Sogang University in Korea. He received his Ph.D. from Paris VII University in 2004 with a dissertation on the Sŏn Master Sŏngch’ŏl (1912-1993), and he has been a qualified Sŏn 禪 instructor since 2007. His recent publications include A Critical Reflection of the Chogye Order’s Campaign for the Worldwide Propagation of Kanhwa Sŏn (2011), Sŏn Master T’oeong Sŏngchŏl’s Legacy: A Reflection on the Political Background of the Korean Sudden/Gradual Debate (2012), Qohéleth et le Sūtra du Diamant, sagesses biblique et bouddhique (Qoheleth and the Diamond Sūtra, Biblical and Buddhist Wisdoms) (2013), Buddhism in the Two Koreas: North-South Interactions (2013), and the book Kayasan ŭi ho’rang iŭi ch’ech’ui rŭl mat’atta, T’oeong Sŏngch’ŏl, I’mwŏkko? (2013). In his article, Fr. Senécal describes a community of lay Catholics in Korea, who are composed of Koreans and foreigners. They are people deeply attracted by the teachings of the Buddha and who desire to learn about those teachings in depth, while at the same time remaining Christians, that is, Christ-centered. This community began informally in January 2011 with four members including Fr. Bernard himself, but today it has ten core members, and over forty affiliated ones from five nations. Among their goals they seek to assist Buddhist-Christian couples who experience difficulty in staying together, due to religious differences. Since April 2015 the community has evolved into a federative nonprofit religious incorporated association, that is, an ecumenical,\n\ninter-religious and international body, having the name: Way’s End Stone Field\n\nCommunity (道全石田共同體).\n\nFr. Ingun Kang is a Korean Jesuit who has served in Cambodia since 1997. In the course of his academic career he earned a Licentiate in Sacred Theology (STL) in the field of Missiology in 2002 from the Jesuit School of Theology at Santa Clara University, Berkeley, an M.A. in Pali Buddhism from the University of Kelaniya in Sri Lanka in 2008, and a Ph.D. in Buddhist-Christian Relations in 2012 from Heythrop College, University of London. He has been actively engaged in Buddhist-Christian dialogue in the Theravada nations of Asia such as Cambodia, Thailand, and Sri Lanka. His inter-religious praxis is well grounded on academic depth and revealed in his two M.A. theses, one on Christian theology and the other on Buddhist philosophy, as well as in his doctoral thesis that deals with a comparative analysis of the radical orthopraxis of Bhikkhu Buddhadāsa and Aloysius Pieris. His insights on the Buddhist-Christian praxis of spiritual detachment and social engagement have inspired many people of goodwill to rethink the meaning and role of religion, in the face of the enormous challenges and crises of globalization. What Fr. Ingun Kang asks is: “How can a religious faith with its truth and vision serve as a source of hope to the contemporary world? And not divorced from but in collaboration with other religions?”\n\nDr. Yong Un Choe is a Korean Christian clergyman and close associate of the Jesuits of the Asia Pacific Conference. He initially studied Christianity at the Graduate School of Theology in Yonsei University in Korea, and then went on to conduct further research on Christianity, Buddhism and Confucianism, both at the Boston University School of Theology in the USA, and the Graduate School of Sogang University in Korea. Dr. Choe is a gentleman whom the Jesuit Buddhist scholars of the Asia Pacific Conference have been closely associated with for the past seven years. He was an active participant at several workshops organized by the conference in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Japan, where he impressed all and sundry with his erudition and open attitude, and besides he has been the recipient of numerous awards and honors.\n\nFr. Wajira Nampet is a Jesuit of the Japan Province who was originally raised as a Buddhist in Thailand. Born in a Buddhist family in 1955, he accepted Christianity in 1980, joined the Society of Jesus in 1984, and was ordained a priest in Owing to his having spent a large portion of his life as a Buddhist believer, he now occupies the rare position of being able to view both Christian and Buddhist societies as an ‘insider.’ Fr. Wajira earned doctoral degrees in statistics and psychology, and though he generally teaches and conducts research at Sophia and other universities of Japan, he nevertheless also lectures worldwide at institutes and universities such as Harvard. Yet with all this, he manages also to find time to pursue his study of Buddhism.\n\nFr. Noel Sheth is a Jesuit priest and former President (or Rector/Principal) of the Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth Pontifical Institute of Philosophy and Religion in the city of Pune, India, where he taught for over thirty-five years. He possesses a doctorate from Harvard University and is a reputed scholar both in Sanskrit and Pali, with his name appearing in the Who’s Who of Sanskrit Scholars of India. He was the convener of the History of Religion Section of the 14th World Sanskrit Conference that was held in Kyoto, Japan, and he has been the recipient of numerous scholarships and awards. A significant award that he received was the “Dr. Sam Higginbottom Award for the Best Principals [Presidents/Rectors] of India, 2004-2005.” Fr. Sheth has published widely in India and abroad on Sanskrit and Pali exegesis as well as comparative philosophy and theology, and has lectured on different Indian religions and philosophies in a variety of universities located in diverse parts of the world. Currently he is a member of several national and international learned groups and international administrative bodies, and he is also on the Board of Editors of various international journals. He serves as adviser to the Jesuit Superior General for issues related to interreligious dialogue with Hinduism, and is also a member of the international Secretariat for Ecumenical and Inter-religious Relations for the worldwide Society of Jesus.\n\nFr. Paulus Agung Wijayanto is an Indonesian Jesuit who studied under the guidance of Fr. Aloysius Pieris of Sri Lanka. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1983 and was ordained a priest in 1995, and for a time he even served as Socius to the Novice Director in the Maria Della Strada Jesuit Novitiate, situated in the city of Taunggyi in Myanmar. In 2005 he obtained a Master’s degree in Buddhism at the Center of Buddhist Studies of the University of Hong Kong, and from 2005 to 2007 he lectured on Eastern Religions in the Department of Religion and Culture at the University of Sanata Dharma in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. He was an energetic participant at the Buddhist Christian Workshops conducted by the Asia Pacific Jesuit Conference in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Japan, and in the course of his parish ministry he wrote several articles for “Kompas,” a national newspaper of Indonesia, and often gave talks on Chinese customs and religious practices. Thanks to his Chinese links, he is currently able to provide support to Chinese Catholics, and particularly those hailing from a Buddhist background, enabling them to integrate their earlier religious beliefs with Catholicism. Although assigned to parish work these days his interest in Buddhism endures, driven by his belief that present-day Indonesian culture is in many ways still deeply rooted in Hindu-Buddhist traditions. He publishes his findings on Buddhism as articles, mostly in Indonesian nationwide dailies and Journals on Philosophy and Theology, with a desire to arouse the appeal of the common people with regard to their local spiritual heritage and traditions.\n\nFr. Jojo M. Fung is a Jesuit hailing from the Malaysia-Singapore Region. He teaches Contextual Theology in the Asian Theological Program of the Loyola School of Theology located in Ateneo de Manila University of the Philippines, while in the East Asian Pastoral Institute located in the same campus he teaches Indigenous/Shamanic Leadership. His publications appear in several journals, his latest articles being: Living In Awe: A New Vision and Mission for Asia: Critical Orientations to Sustainability and Spirituality, in the Public Media Agency for GCSSFS, Kuala Lumpur; Indigenous Oral Lore and Digital Media, in Encyclopedia of Popular Culture in Asia and Oceania, edited by Jeremy Murray and Kathleen Nadeau; Voices of the Spirit, an adaptation from his own work entitled A Shamanic Theology of Sacred Sustainability: Church and Shamans in Dialogue for Liberative Struggle; and An Awe-Inspiring Contemplatio, in AMERICA THE NATIONAL CATHOLIC REVIEW (online). His upcoming book is entitled Spirit of The Earth: A Shamanic Pneumatology in a Mystical Age of Sacred Sustainability, to be issued by Jesuit Communications Foundations INC, Manila, 2015.\n\nFr. Soosai Lawrence was born in the city of Nagercoil in the Southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, and belongs to the Patna Jesuit Province. On concluding his high school education he entered Loyola College in the city of Chennai, India, and graduated with a degree in Zoology from Chennai University. He later went on to earn a Master’s degree in Anthropology from the University of Pune in India, another Master’s degree in Buddhism from the University of Kelaniya in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and a Ph.D. in Theravada Buddhist Psychology from the University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka. He began his Jesuit training in 1984, and was ordained a priest in 1998. From the earliest stages of his Jesuit career he has manifested a keen interest in non-Christian traditions, and has often sought to experience the spiritual depths of their adherents. To attain an experience of the Divine that was devoid of all cultural and religious bias has been his incessant and lifelong obsession. From 2003 onwards he began working in the Buddhist city of Bodhgaya, and four years of life and service in the Holy Land of the Buddhists drew him closer to the Spiritual Wisdom of the Buddha, and motivated him into delving ever deeper into Buddhist research. Currently his favorite ministry consists in integrating the Wisdom of Buddhist Psycho-Spirituality and the Grace of Biblical Spirituality in order to liberate mankind, while Inter-religious Integration and Promotion of World Peace and Human Progress have constituted his passionate and life-long mission. Besides this he has several articles to his credit, published in a variety of journals.\n\nFinally, I who have been endorsed with the task of editing this publication am an Indian Jesuit, the child of a Catholic father and Hindu mother, who has lived and served in Japan since 1974. After entering the Society of Jesus in 1968 I was ordained a priest in 1982, and on earning a Ph.D. in Hinduism under the direction of the late Fr. Richard De Smet, S. J. at the Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth Pontifical Institute of Philosophy and Religion in the city of Pune in India, I returned to Japan and entered the Faculty of Foreign Studies of Sophia University, Tokyo, as a tenured member of the teaching staff. Although most of my research has to date been on Hinduism, yet, since Buddhism is a religion born in South Asia, Fr. Adolfo Nicolas, SJ, the current Superior General of the Jesuits (who at the time was head of the Jesuit Conference of East Asia and Oceania), appointed me director of Buddhist Christian dialogue in the Jesuit Provinces of East and Southeast Asia, a post I occupied until recently. During the past 20 years I have been actively involved in inter-religious dialogue with members of the Nippon Vedanta Kyokai, a branch of the worldwide Ramakrishna Mission located in the city of Zushi in the Kanagawa Prefecture of Japan, and since 2010 I have been a member of the Committee for Inter-religious Dialogue of the Catholic Archdiocese of Tokyo, on the request of the Archbishop, Peter Okada Takeo. My principal publications are, The Mysticism of Ramanuja, published by Munshiram Manoharlal in 1993, The Love Song,\n\npublished by Minerva Press, 1998, and The Life and Work of Blessed Mother Teresa,\n\n(Co-authored with Hiromi Josepha Kudo), Sophia University Press, 2007.\n\nThe primary motive behind this publication was twofold, namely to reinforce bonds of camaraderie and teamwork that are present among our Buddhist and Christian scholars, and to inspire our Christian youth into evincing a keener interest in Buddhism. It is my hope that in years to come, more of our youngsters (both Jesuits and others) feel drawn into proffering gestures of amity and concern for their non-Christian brethren, and thereby disperse among them the precious gifts of the Spirit that they have blessed with. As the Lord Buddha himself is reported to have declared, “Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of that candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.”\n\nTo conclude, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to all who assisted us in\n\nthis venture, and in particular Mr. Robert Crusz of the Tulana Research Centre, located\n\nin Kelaniya in Sri Lanka.\n\n[Back to Table of Contents]\n\nReflections on Some Psychological Aspects of Zen\n\nBy\n\nJerry Cusumano, SJ\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this article I consider some psychological aspects of Zen from both a personal and professional point of view. Part One is a brief introduction about Zen, and Part Two is a recounting of some personal experiences. In Part Three I review briefly contemporary Zen writings on the concept of no self. In Part Four I look at implications Zen might have for psychology, especially therapy, both theory and practice. Finally, an appendix contains a selection of thought-provoking quotes from various Zen masters.\n\nPart One: Introduction\n\nZen as the Practice of Zen\n\nSince theoretical definitions of Zen differ greatly, a functional one, that is, how one does Zen, may be a more appropriate starting point. One does Zen in the following way (Enomiya-Lassalle, 1992). In a dimly lit room of moderate temperature one sits on the front third of a round, low pillow. One’s right foot is put over the left thigh and then the left over the right thigh. The right hand is placed in front of the stomach and rests against the heel of the foot. The left hand is put on top of the right with thumbs touching together and pointing toward the navel. The back is held straight, so that the tip of the nose is in line with the navel and the ears in line with the shoulders. The eyes are half-closed and looking, though not focusing clearly, at a low spot on the floor (or wall), about three feet away. The breathing is not controlled in any way, however a piece of paper should not quiver if directly placed in front of the nose. Interiorly, one counts breaths or merely observes them or sits alert with no object of thought or wrestles with a Koan (a riddle that cannot be solved by conceptual thinking, e.g. the sound of one hand clapping). What one does with the mind during Zen depends on the directives given by the Zen master. However, the rule for intruding or distracting thoughts remains the same for all: one neither welcomes them and gets involved in them nor opposes them and tries to get rid of them; their presence is simply observed, and one continues with the assigned practice given by the Zen master.\n\nUnlike other meditation systems the posture in Zen is greatly emphasized. The folded legs combined with the straightened back serve to increase one’s alertness by creating a tension in the hara (lower abdomen), such that while it becomes filled with vitality, the mind becomes more calm, (Sato, 1958). Sitting in this posture and focusing on one’s breathing will inevitably lower one’s respiration even though no conscious effort is made to do so (Malec, 1977). And eventually even the slower breath ceases to be an object of consciousness (Lesh, 1970). In the lotus position, because the feet are raised even with the pelvis, the blood circulation improves throughout the whole body. Combined with the vitality induced by the straight back and the calmness coming from reduced heart rate and respiration, this causes a general feeling of wellbeing. The emphasis on posture in Zen is because of its effects on behavior. By adjusting one’s posture and breathing one can have an effect on one’s temperament, (Sato, 1968).\n\nA well-known series of studies using the EEG to measure brain waves showed that those engaged in Zen meditation produced markedly more alpha waves (Kasamatsu & Hirai, 1969). Alpha waves signal a lowered cortical activity between sleep and the ordinary waking state, resulting in the unusual state of consciousness in which one is fully aware of both internal and external stimuli and yet is not bothered by them(Goleman, 1971). That this state can be positively induced by one’s doing Zen leads to a sense of control and self-regulation of one’s body (Shapiro 1976).\n\nIn Zen meditation one does not try to blot out external stimuli from consciousness but rather habituate to them, that is to say, to be aware of them without thinking about them. For example, when one hears a noise, it is admitted fully to consciousness but no effort is made to think about where it came from and so on. With the neutralizing of external stimuli however a new obstacle arises, namely the anxiety caused by one’s passing from the normal active mode of awareness to the passive-receptive mode, a passage often termed a regression in the service of the ego (Lesh 1970). Resistance arises as the mode of convergent thinking, that mode of thought associated with the left hemisphere and which structures the world into meanings, gives way to divergent thinking, a letting go and a non-doing mode associated with the right hemisphere, (Cusumano, 1980). The ego will resist any letting go that might open the way for inner conflicts to surface. By cutting off the ego’s usual method of control (through thoughts and expectations), the Zen meditator opens his/her consciousness to a realization of something beyond his own personal consciousness (Ornstein 1972).\n\nZen and Zen Buddhism\n\nThe origins of Zen are found in a personal experience of a young man, Shakyamuni Buddha, born over 2500 years ago in what is now Nepal. After pursuing yogic ascetical practices for six years he developed his own form of meditation, which culminated in a very strong experience of an unusual form of consciousness. He began to bring others to that same experience by teaching them his way of meditation. After his death a body of doctrine and an organization grew from that experience, which developed into what is now called Buddhism. In this paper I prescind from that subsequent doctrinal and organizational development; this paper deals with Zen as a psycho-spiritual discipline, with special emphasis on the experiential dimension, apart from Zen Buddhism as an organized religion. I begin with an account of my own personal experience.\n\nPart Two: Personal Experience\n\nIn this part I present reflections on some of my own “psychological experiences of doing Zen, especially working on the Koan Mu. I use the word “psychological” to differentiate these experiences from authentic Zen experiences.\n\nThe Koan Mu\n\nThis Koan is one of the oldest and most famous of the Zen Koans, although the “sound of one hand clapping” is probably known more popularly. It is quite simple. The 8th century Chinese Zen Master, whose Japanese name is Jôshû is asked by a monk whether or not a dog has the Buddha nature. He replies with one syllable, one ideograph, Mu (無), which can mean “nothing.”\n\n”A monk asked Jôshû in all earnestness, ‘Does a dog have Buddha nature or not?’ Jôshû said, ‘Mu!’” (Yamada, 1979, p.11)\n\nIn former times the beginner was taught how to sit and then pretty much left on his own with no explanation of how to deal with this Koan. The usual process for most would be first to try to deal with the meaning of Jôshû’s answer logically. “Buddha nature is so great it could not possibly be in a dog.” “Buddha nature is everywhere so it must also be in a dog.” “Jôshû is saying both yes and no to the question,” and so on and so on. Eventually, since the Roshi would not accept such answers, the practitioner would get frustrated and begin to just sit with Mu without any thinking at all. This is the correct direction for solving this Koan.\n\nHowever, as an adaptation to contemporary beginners, Zen Roshi nowadays often instruct their disciples to forego those “preliminaries” and simply absorb oneself in Mu from the beginning by repeating it quietly and internally with each exhalation. The aim of this practice has been expressed concisely by the 12th century Japanese Zen Master, Dôgen: the purpose of Zen is to find one’s true self; the way to this goal is to forget the self. This forgetting is accomplished by totally absorbing oneself in the practice of Mu without thinking.\n\nSome Psychological Aspects of Working on the Koan Mu\n\nAs I noted in the introduction, I use the word “psychological” to distinguish these experiences from authentic Zen experiences, which must be confirmed by the Roshi. The experiences I will touch upon might be characterized as some side effects of the practice of Zen.\n\nPosture: In the early stages of practice I had to work quite hard to achieve the proper position, the full lotus sitting position. It took me several years to be able to do this posture “comfortably.” I can remember the morning when I was finally able to do back-to-back sittings of an hour’s length each. Subsequently I was able to use the full lotus posture for an entire sesshin (five day intensive practice). The struggle with the posture and the subsequent satisfaction of achieving it were actually a distraction from\n\nthe work on Mu, since, far from forgetting the self, the self was in the forefront of this experience. From this experience it was easy to see how egoism can creep in and take over the simplest acts.\n\nRepressed Memory: My mother died when I was a second year novice. I had many feelings of guilt connected with this event. I was unable to cry at the time, partly because of a mistaken idea of how a religious should handle emotions. I had also reproached myself for not going to visit her more often. Shortly after my ordination, Fr. Tony de Mello, S.J., came to Japan, and I took part in one of his group therapy programs. He skillfully worked me through this problem, and I thought that it had been settled. However, several years after that, while working on the Koan Mu, a memory came back that had been repressed. It was from the time of my last visit. My mother was in much pain and before I left she asked me to kiss her. Although I did so, of course, my first spontaneous reaction was one of repugnance to do so. It had probably been this spontaneous reaction, later repressed, more than anything else that had been the source of my guilt. The focus of attention on Mu in a state of non-thinking weakened the defense mechanism of repression, and allowed this memory to come forward. It was a very helpful experience for me, but from the standpoint of Zen practice, not an authentic Zen experience.\n\nFrustration/Acceptance: I worked on the Koan Mu for a total of 14 years. At first the novelty kept my spirits up but eventually frustration began to grow at not being able to solve it to the satisfaction of the Roshi. This actually contributed to a mild depression, which I suffered one summer. However, with continued practice, even though still not being able to solve the Koan, psychologically I moved to a better space, one of acceptance and letting things be as they are. This was expressed in a natural change of practice from Mu to what is called in Japanese “shikantaza,” usually translated as “just sitting.” It means to sit without any desire of solving anything or achieving anything. Before continuing with other Koans after Mu, I did this “just sitting” for seven years. This whole experience, easily and usefully applied to everyday life, was once again a helpful psychological side effect of working on the Koan Mu. I had reached an experiential grasp of the second part of the Serenity Prayer, to accept what cannot be changed. A conceptual understanding of this second phrase of the Serenity Prayer can be helpful. However, an experiential grasp of it is deeper and more long lasting.\n\nNon-specific Factors:\n\nThe three experiences described above can be seen as a result of factors not specific to Zen or limited to working on the Koan Mu. Insight into one’s egoism recovery of repressed memories, and learning to accept things the way they are, could be the fruit of many different types of meditation or other psycho-spiritual disciplines. In that sense these experiences are not really sufficient motivation to continue with the practice of Mu. Likewise, Mu is quite similar to the AUM of Yoga, often used as a mantra for meditation. In fact, use of the so-called “liquid” consonants, of which “m” is one, is quite frequent in many forms of meditation.\n\nDeikman has delineated the non-specific factor in any kind of meditation most clearly by contrasting what he calls the action mode and automatization with the receptive mode and deautomatization (Deikman, 1963, 1966, 1976). I summarize his thought below.\n\nIn the usual waking state, the normal adult functions primarily through a mode of consciousness Deikman terms the “action mode. This mode is characterized by abstract thinking, sharp differentiation between the self and the environment, and an attitude of knowing and manipulating the environment to fulfill a person’s needs. Success in the action mode requires selective memory of the past as well as accurate predictions for the future. The action mode results from automatization, a learning process in which repetition of an act or percept eventually results in a mastered automatic act or percept. Automatization frees the attention from the intermediate steps that led to mastering the act or percept, with the result that these steps disappear from consciousness. With each automatization, especially those involved in the abstracting process for conceptual thinking, man becomes less and less conscious of his sensual being, increasingly differentiates his self from his environment, and finds it more difficult to live in the present moment. An inability to be fully present and at one with the world around him leads to confusion about the purpose of life.\n\nA sharper sensory perception accompanying the absence of analytic thought, a blurring of the distinction between self and environment, and an attitude of allowing the world as it is to enter oneself, characterize the receptive mode. Success in this mode depends upon the ability to live in the present. The receptive mode results from deautomatization, a relearning process basic to every form of mediation (as that term is used in contemporary psychology) by which one reinvests automatized percepts and acts with the energy usually saved by automatization. Deautomatization sharpens sensual perception at the expense of abstract differentiation, breaks down the usual subject/object boundaries customarily experienced as the ego and its environment, and provides satisfaction gained through a deeper experience of the present moment. By regressing to a preautomatized childlike state, the normal healthy adult can open himself gradually to a new experience of reality that will effect a reorganization of his personality, or in other words, a change of consciousness. Within the receptive mode of consciousness one may experience in the here-and-now an answer to the question about the purpose to human life that is more satisfying than any conceptual answer arrived at by reflection on the past or hopes for the future.\n\nThese are some of the non-specific factors involved in any form of meditation. So what is specific to the Zen practice of Mu?\n\nSpecific Factors\n\nApart from the above non-specific factors I think Zen is unique because of a combination of two factors. The first is the typical oriental method of training, described so well by Herrigel, (Herrigel, 1999). One does the same thing over and over, in his case traditional Japanese archery, with no thought to accomplishing a goal. Rather one puts his/her ego aside to follow intently the directives of the master. The second factor is the personal one-on-one direction from the Roshi who scolds, encourages, and makes sure one stays on the right path to solving the Koan Mu. The first factor is simplicity itself, simply repeating Mu with each breath. It is because of this simplicity that one can do it for hours, days, and years. There is nothing to be learned, mastered, or achieved, and so nothing to become tired of or confused about. The second factor is more complex because it is the peculiar relationship of each disciple with the Roshi. As all human relationships, this varies according to mood, situation, the passing of time, and so on. However, this direction is integral to the practice of Zen, and without it, it is no exaggeration to say, that there is no Zen. Practicing Mu on one’s own can be a helpful exercise in mental relaxation or concentration, but it is not Zen.\n\nPostscript: Integration of Zen with Christian Spirituality\n\nThis topic has been and will continue to be the subject of many articles and books. I am not an advocate of so-called Christian Zen (Kadowaki, 2002) or Zen Christianity (Sato, 2997). Here I only add a personal note from my own experience. In Christian spirituality we emphasize the Scripture as a way to know Christ and develop a personal relationship with him. We also emphasize that this process is carried on within the tradition of the Church. One element I find lacking here is “what I am experiencing right now”. It is this element, which I think that Zen in general, and the practice of Mu in particular as well as other Koans, can contribute to Christian spirituality. Too much emphasis on Scripture and the tradition of the Church can turn one’s attention too much to the past. Adding the element of “what I am experiencing right now” makes both come alive in the present.\n\nI have no major conclusion from this account of some of my personal experiences and reflections upon them. They stand on their own as unique since they are personal. I will try to balance them off, however in the next section, which deals with an important teaching for all who do Zen, that is to say, no-self.\n\nPart Three: No-self\n\nThe Teaching of No-self in Zen\n\nThe original experience of Zen precedes the doctrines that developed around it. That is to say, the primal experience that Shakyamuni had is the source from which later doctrines developed, and as such can be called the “normative” experience of Zen Buddhism. The claim of those who have had that experience is that it is non-conceptual and therefore beyond logic. Zen transcends logic, but is not illogical (Radcliff & Radcliff, 1993). Put another way, it transcends logic but is not unreasonable. This is seen most clearly in the explanation of no self (Harada, 1993; Harada, 1998).\n\nThe question of the self\n\nFrom the history of both philosophy and psychology we know that conceptualizing the self has proved to be elusive if not impossible (Suler, 1993). Since one can only infer the existence of a self, there can always remain a doubt about its substance. And so we see that the meaning of self has changed with each generation, and within each generation it has always had multiple meanings, (Harre, 1998; Watts, 2002). This is especially true in our times when the interest in spirituality has become very great, (Schermer, 2003; Tacey, 2004).\n\nAnd yet despite this ambiguity surrounding the notion of the self, philosophical and psychological systems are built around the presupposition of a self. What happens when no “self” is presupposed? I will try to answer this question after first looking at what contemporary Zen teachers mean when they speak of no self (Cusumano, 2004). There are four main approaches discernible in those writing on no self: 1) forgetting the self, 2) cessation from attachment, 3) giving up discriminating, and 4) the self as illusion.\n\nNo-self is forgetting the self\n\nIn answer to his own question of why one should do Zen, the 12th century Japanese Zen Master Dogen said that the purpose of Zen was to learn about the self, and that this is done by forgetting the self (Aoyama, 1990; Otani, 2001). Wright has re-worded Dogen’s famous statement in the following way: “What Dogen is saying is that in learning about jiko (=self) in the broadest sense, that is, as our universal identity, we have to forget or let go of all the narrow ideas we might have about who we are,” (Uchiyama, 2004, p. xxv).\n\nForgetting the self is precisely letting go of those ideas of self that we have. Why must these ideas be abandoned? It is because they are the object of our own thinking about ourselves. Thinking about the self can never lead to a true understanding of the self. That is to say, when one thinks about the self there is already another “self” in operation doing the thinking about the self, which is being thought about. Which is the real self? This question cannot be answered. And so many Zen teachers follow Dogen’s line in affirming that the self cannot be known by thinking about it, but rather by forgetting it.\n\nContemporary Zen teachers who follow this approach point out that the self cannot know itself, for then it would lose its subjectivity, and so it must transcend or negate itself by collapsing the structure of subject/object (Antinoff, 1990/1991; Kopf, 1996). This collapse is made possible by a shift from thinking to awareness. In this no-self state the operations of the intellect have ceased, and all that remains is pure awareness (Kamilar, 2002; Sargent, 2001). Thus even the objection that there is a self attempting to forget the self can be dealt with, by pointing out that awareness and thinking differ. When the self is forgotten, one achieves his/her own potential and unique creativity (Aitken, 1993; Kasulis, 1975; Pio, 1988). Creativity springs up from the spontaneity achieved when the fixed idea of the self is overcome. Even though the self is a commonly accepted belief, the self must nevertheless be negated, and this negation confirmed in a concrete way (Aitken, 1994: Sogen, 1996).\n\nNo-self is cessation from attachment\n\nA second school of thought recognizes the state of no-self as being a state in which the self has no attachments. It is common in the West to see attachment in a positive manner, for example one speaks of a child being attached to its mother. The Zen approach to attachment does not deny this aspect, but stresses that no attachment can be absolute and unlimited. Therefore, the attitude of non-attachment even toward normal and desirable attachments is preferred. Non-attachment parallels the position that all beings are in a state of change, and so no attachment can be lasting and unchanging. When likes and dislikes, attractions and aversions cease, the external world as an object-of-the-self is no longer posited, with the result of no-self (Merzel, 1991; Teshima, 1995). Detachment from attachment is the cure for possessiveness. When possessiveness by the self ceases, anxiety also ceases leaving pure spontaneity (Suler, 1993; Tanahashi & Schnider, 1994).\n\nNo-self as cessation from attachment can be expressed in many ways. “How I was, how I am, how I will be” cease to be concerns (Aitken, 1993, p. 15). Attachment ceases when one no longer sees the world from the limited perspective of an individual self. No-self means lack of self-centeredness (Suzuki, 2002). “The ego-self which is oriented by self-centeredness is an unreal entity and the root-source of human suffering,” (Abe, 1995, p. 65). What we think of as the self is the “self-regarding ‘me’”, (Graham, 1994, p. 44). The high price one pays in psychological health from attachment to material things is well documented (Kasser, 2002). However, the Zen teaching of no-self goes beyond these surface attachments to deal with the root of attachment.\n\nNo-self is giving up the discriminating self\n\nA third line of thought interprets no-self as giving up a certain type of self. Here the self is not negated but the act of discriminating self from other is given up (Karasu, 1999). One does not feel separate from the other but rather experiences oneself as being with the other (Beck, 1993). One no longer speaks of having an experience of something but rather becomes one’s experience and so identifies with the content of the experience (Ives, 1992). The attempt to keep the self separate from others comes to be seen as a defensive ploy, which brings on suffering (Chung, 1994; Gunn, 1996/1997). Thinking and thoughts are seen as the defenses put between self and reality as false determinants of reality (Knewitz, 1988/1989; Packer, 1990; Rudy, 1996). When the discriminating function (I-other) of the ego ceases, the true self appears.\n\nNo-self means the self is an illusion\n\nThis fourth position has various forms of expression. The movement of the mind, that is to say its various and incessant activities and functions, creates the illusion of a self (Loori, 1996). This is similar to the illusion of stability created by the speedy and continuous projection of still images in a film (Kamilar, 2002). The same idea can be expressed as “the Buddhist meaning of ego, a spiritually technical term for the delusive sense that oneself and the universe are fundamentally separate,” (Young-Eisendrath & Martin, 1997, p. 33). Uchiyama’s formulation of no-self as an illusion is: “Maybe it would be clearer to say that things have no substantial independent existence of their own,” (Uchiyama, 2004, p. 7). The strong consciousness of a self prevents one from seeing reality as it is (Kubota, 2002). The thought that there is a self is simply a “secretion” of the brain with no basis in reality (Uchiyama, 1990). The illusion of a self comes from identifying with the functions of consciousness and the psychological patterns that accompany them (Blackstone & Josipovic, 1995; Kamilar, 2002). In this approach self is perceived as ever-changing and transient (Harada, 1993; Nukariya, 1961). Abe describes the notion of no-self in this way: “Though we have self-identity in a relative sense we have no self-identity in any absolute and substantial sense,” (Abe, 1995, p. 66). Although the self is useful as a “reference for dealing with the world,” because it is impermanent and changing, it is restrictive (Scott & Doubleday, 1992, p.5).\n\nSummary\n\nThe positions outlined above can be briefly summarized as follows:\n\nThere is a self, but it must be transcended, negated, or forgotten. This is done by suspending the ordinary operations of the intellect and making impossible a subject-object relationship.\n\nThere is a self, but it is overcome by the giving up of attachments, self-centeredness, and possessiveness, that is, giving up a view of the world that sees all in relationship to the self.\n\nThere is a self, but its function of discriminating itself from “the other,” especially by making comparisons, must be given up.\n\nThe idea of the self itself is an illusion, the illusion that one is separate from “the other,” an illusion maintained by identifying with the functions of consciousness. The self is impermanent and changing and so cannot be the source of identity.\n\nContrast with Western Psychology\n\nAlthough the words used to describe the term, “no-self” are vague and lack the precision and clarity of psychological definitions, nevertheless, they clearly point to a reality which differs from that current in western psychology expressed by terms such as: self-actualization, self-analysis, self-efficacy, self-monitoring, self-reinforcement, self-psychology, and so on. Whereas the latter set of psychological terms not only presume a self but consider it as an entity to be strengthened, equipped with skills, and focused upon, the terms that describe the no-self of Zen either deny the self as such or point to a radical diminishment of the self even to the point of negation. In the next section we take a look at how Zen with its teaching of no-self has been applied to the area of psychotherapy in particular.\n\nPart Four: Zen in Psychology and Therapy\n\nZen in Psychotherapy\n\nIn the west Zen has been incorporated into clinical practice in various ways. Two therapies indigenous to Japan, Morita and Naikan, which stress a non-analytical approach, have incorporated Zen into their frameworks. In Morita therapy the patient is immersed in “inactivity” and must work his way through the boredom. In Naikan therapy one is led to re-discover feelings of gratitude to significant others through a carefully arranged system of meditations. Murase points out that the basic difference of these two with a western approach is that excessive analytical self-reflection as required by psychoanalytic work would be seen by these therapies as a form of sickness itself (Murase, 1975).\n\nZen has also been put to use in the training of counselors. Early on, Berger suggested that Zen would help the potential counselor from getting bogged down in abstractions (Berger 1962). Several studies attempted to show that Zen could foster empathy (Keefe, 1975; Lesh, 1971; Leung, 1973). While there is some support for the idea that training in Zen can help foster empathy, what seems to have been made more clear is that empathy is a component of the “meditative” type of person.\n\nZen and Psychoanalysis\n\nAlthough as noted above Zen and psychoanalysis appear to be at opposite ends of the spectrum with regard to the function of consciousness in psychotherapy, from the psychological standpoint many of the deeper insights into Zen have come from psychoanalysts.\n\nStunkard accurately conceptualized the task of the Zen practitioner as being one of eliminating the mediators between a person and his experience (Stunkard, 1951). Fromm compared Zen and psychoanalysis on the basis of the interplay between the conscious and the unconscious. By use of free association in psychoanalysis and Koans in Zen one is forced into a corner in which rationalizations are of no avail, and the only alternative is to face reality as it is by direct experience rather than through the filter of conceptual thinking (Fromm & Suzuki, 1960). Fromm concluded that Zen training could be very helpful for the psychoanalyst because of its radical approach to intellectualization and the delusions of the ego as well as its more positive emphasis on healthy wellbeing (Fromm 1959)\n\nDeikman, whose ideas on automatization have already been introduced above, notes that with Zen there is heightened attention to sensory pathways, an absence of analytic thought, and an attitude of receptivity to stimuli (Deikman 1966). The action mode of consciousness entails automatization, in which one selects from reality only what is economical and/or useful for manipulating the environment. By contrast de-automatization brings about a receptive mode, which frees abilities that usually cannot function in the action mode (Deikman, 1976). Thus one can potentially open the self up to every aspect of reality. However, the ego will resist the receptive mode because that mode threatens it with the unknown and even possible extinction, for to let go of oneself in the receptive mode is to blur the sharp distinction between the “I” and what is not “I” (Deikman, 1976a). The receptive mode exposes the self as an illusion. Observation of the never-ending flux of one’s inner state leads to the realization that the idea of a constant permanent self is in itself an illusion (Deikman, 1977).\n\nConclusions from Research on Zen\n\nPsychological research on Zen has verified the following points. During Zen meditation oxygen consumption, respiration rate, heart rate, muscle tension, and the secretion of lactate all decrease while blood circulation, the production of alpha waves, and activity of the right hemisphere all increase. These bodily changes have been correlated with the lessening of anxiety, increase of attention, awareness and alertness, and a release of repressed emotions. The Zen meditator learns to focus attention effortlessly and be attuned to reality, that is, the here-and-now as it is being experienced regardless of the thoughts that one observes crossing the mind. The ability to experience thoughts as thoughts and not identify with them becomes an attitude of life that transforms consciousness, so that one can better experience the world as it really is and not as it is filtered by conceptual thought.\n\nZen: Therapy for the Therapist\n\nThe “talking cure,” whether it be the free association of psychoanalysis or the empathic understanding of humanistic counseling, relies upon words for its effectiveness. For the counselor or therapist who has undergone training in the “talking cure” method and practices it, there may come a point where a new mode of therapy can be helpful for the therapist’s own personal growth. Zen meditation can be such a therapy for a therapist who has attained a certain degree of personal stability and has progressed sufficiently to no longer rely exclusively on words or conceptual thought for personal help. While the use of Zen with clients is not recommended, since Zen practice presumes a certain amount of emotional stability, the counselor or therapist who deals with clients may very well profit from this different mode of “self therapy.”\n\nWhat follows is an experiment done with students aspiring to be counselors to test this idea of Zen as a useful therapy for the therapist.\n\nPsychology experiment with Zen\n\nThe following experiment was used to introduce counseling students to an experience of Zen (Cusumano & Moridaira, 1993). Over a period of five weeks students received brief instructions in Zen and were given 30 minutes of practice sitting once a week. Before each session began the students filled out the Mood Checklist (see appendix). The Mood Checklist has 6 positive mood adjectives and 5 negative mood adjectives. At the end of the five week period students participated in an intensive 24-hour overnight experience of Zen at a Zen training center on the outskirts of Tokyo.\n\nBefore beginning, the students once again filled out the Mood Checklist. The intensive sitting followed the pattern of 30 minutes of sitting, then 10 minutes of kinhin (slow concentrated Zen walk). Suitable time was allowed for meals and seven hours for sleep. Once in the evening and once in the morning the students again filled out the Mood Checklist while actually doing Zen.\n\nAt the end of the experiment students were asked to write their impressions and calculate the data in the following way. Each observation of mood was reduced to one figure by subtracting all individual scores from 5, then adding the positive scores to a total and the negative scores to a total, then subtracting negative from positive. This single score for each measurement was then recorded. The average of the first six scores was calculated to yield the baseline of each individual’s mood. Likewise, the average of the two measurements during Zen was taken. Complete data was obtained for 31 subjects. The group mean for the baseline was 4.8 (SD 3.4), for the intervention 3.2 (SD 5.1).\n\nOn the surface most students registered a decrease in overall positive mood. However, their interpretation of this phenomenon was not that their mood got worse during Zen. Rather, many wrote in their experiences that the mood score was lowered because there was an absence of feeling, or no emotional movements, or no room to feel emotion (because of pain in legs), or because they were more mentally stable, or that feelings disappear, or that they were experiencing fewer things (and so time went faster).\n\nThis interpretation of the students was unexpected, as the experimenter had hypothesized that negative feelings would decrease leading to more positive scores on overall mood. However, the interpretation of the students may be more accurate in reflecting their experience and make better sense out of the data than the hypothesis of the experimenter.\n\nIn this research a qualitative analysis of the self-reports of the students was used to interpret the statistical results from the experiment. In research with human subjects, not subject to complete quantification, this may be the method of choice. Further research on the effects of Zen on human subjects should combine these two approaches.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper I have looked at the psychological aspects of Zen from various perspectives: personal experience, teaching of Zen masters, research by psychologists, and a psychological experiment. With regard to the central purpose of Zen, that is, discovery of the true self, these psychological aspects are peripheral. However, they can serve as an introduction to Zen to those who do not practice and as guide to those who do to help interpret what they experience in Zen.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAbe, M. (1995).

Although I was a student at the Buddhist University, his wife and child welcomed me into their home. Before breakfast on my first morning with them, my teacher’s wife opened a rice cooker and scooped out a small quantity of freshly cooked white rice into a porcelain bowl. She then placed the rice offering at the family altar, on the right side of the sutra stand below the three sacred paintings of Buddha manifestations. My teacher followed suit and brought a little cup of freshly brewed green tea for the left side of the sutra stand. With the candle lit and an incense stick burning, we prayed together for fifteen minutes before eating our morning meal.\n\nBased on this account, readers might conclude that all Japanese are devoted Buddhists belonging to one of the traditional Buddhist organizations, or that they practice daily meditation, ritual prayer, and visit temples regularly. In point of fact however, traditional Buddhist organizations do not enjoy a secure, comfortable social position in Japan today (McMahan, 2012: 50). Decades of persecution during the Meiji period (1868-1912), ambiguous attitudes towards militarism (1931-1945), and the land reform of post-war Japan (1946), have rendered traditional Buddhist organizations less relevant in modern Japan compared to the role they used to play during the Edo period (1615-1868). In contrast new forms of lay religious organizations (Buddhist and non-Buddhist alike) developed during the nineteenth-century, and some of those organizations flourished in post-war Japan. This movement caused the more traditional Buddhist organizations to renew their efforts to better serve their lay communities, and examples of such efforts include the books that ordained scholar Bhiksu (Bonzes) wrote to help lay devotees nurture a rich spiritual life, the techniques of meditation that have been made available to lay practitioners (which until World War II had been taught only to ordained members of the community), textbooks on daily prayers and rituals and popular commentaries on Mahāyāna sutras that are now available in most bookstores, and ordained female members of Buddhist organizations such as Setouchi Jakuchō (瀬戸内寂聴), who responded to the needs of the lay Buddhist female members of the community through conferences and publications. It is difficult to know how many Japanese pray every day, but one would be mistaken to think that Japanese families have massively abandoned Buddhist practices. Japanese families are very discrete about their spiritual lives, and it is only when invited into their homes that you realize that although the content of their prayers may vary from one tradition to another, the structure and result are very similar. Ritual prayers nourish their spiritual lives.\n\nI shall now endeavor to explain in more detail how lay Buddhist devotees of the Shingon Tradition pray everyday. This is done with the hope of encouraging research in the field of lay Buddhist spirituality, since to my knowledge there are very few scholarly works dealing with the prayer life of Buddhist devotees in contemporary Japan.\n\nAs one of the many holy Buddhist Mountains of Japan, the headquarters of the Shingon (真言 Performative Utterances) tradition were established twelve centuries ago on Mount Kōya. At the top of the mount lies a small plain in the form of a lotus flower, with a complex of temples, halls, and pagodas called the Danjo Garan (壇場伽藍). Nowadays the Danjo Garan is surrounded by a small city composed of more than fifty massive temples, and it is home to shops, ordinary houses, schools and a university. Welcomed as a pilgrim myself, I have been trained in the University of Kōyasan and in the Shinnoin [親王院 (Shinnō temple)], where I was able to be initiated not only to the more specialized teachings of scholar Bhiksus, but also to the teachings offered to lay practitioners. In the following lines I shall introduce the fourteen sections of the daily prayers of Shingon devotees, and provide some background explanations, in order to enable readers who are not familiar with Japanese Buddhism to understand better the content and aim of the ritual prayers.\n\nPrayer recitation is a prudently constructed tenet of Buddhism in Japan. Among the important elements are its location, performance and imagery. The location for prayer recitation must be chosen carefully. Manuals designed for devotees explain how important the environment is to support the ‘performative utterance and act,’ and it results in a meaningful affectation of the devotees’ social realities. Particularly in the context of esoteric traditions, prayer is part of what is referred to as gyō (行, Practice or Performance). While the majority of Japanese respond negatively to the aspects of religion referred to as Shukyō (宗教, Religious Organizations or Religion), most react positively with regard to Shugyō (修行, Purifying acts or Ascetic practices) aspects. This type of tension, which also arises in the West when authors compare religion and spirituality, results in the value of ritual prayers (referred to as ‘performances’). Thus, Japanese devotees ‘performing’ their daily prayers become a reflection or icon of the disentangling presence, despite the entangled reality of their daily lives.\n\nIn order to perform the prayer ritual in the best conditions, devotees are advised to pray around the family altar. There, in the upper part of the family altar, a triptych symbolizes the disentangling Buddha presence: the central image is the icon of Dainichinyorai [大日如来 (महावैरोचन Mahāvairocana)], the icon on the left is Fudomyōō [不動明王 (अचलनाथ Acalanātha)], and the icon on the right is Kōbōdaishi (弘法大師).\n\nIn order to avoid any misunderstanding, I would like to point out the fact that those icons are not three independent images of divinities to be worshiped by the devotees, but modes of the same liberating energy. The central Dainichinyorai is the most encompassing, and it expresses the unborn life-energy of the universe. The image on the left reflects a particular mode of unborn life-energy, as a very powerful diamond-like energy that can cut through the most stubborn delusions, and the image on the right is a Japanese mode of the unborn life-energy, as a protecting diamond-like radiance that permeates all aspects of life in Japan.\n\nThe place around the altar must be welcoming, pure, quiet, and use images that can be traced back to the time of the Buddha, and the place around the family altar must be refreshing, like an early morning rain, (a metaphor made clear to me by a trip to India, where a few minutes of rain refreshed the environment better than any air conditioning could). To that end, devotees are encouraged to keep the family altar clean, decorate it every day with fresh flowers, make daily offerings of cooked rice and tea, and purify the room with burning incense. Within this peaceful environment of the family altar, the daily prayer service of Shingon devotees is comprised of thirteen acts.\n\nI. Calming oneself: Prayer begins with gestures, rather than words. Devotees sit on the floor and breath slowly. In and out, they breathe deeply, staying still a little while to find peace and calm within. This might be punctuated by three bows, not unlike those in Muslim traditions. Once devotees are calm, they can recite the prayer, “I bow down at the feet of the all Buddha-presence,” three times.\n\nII. Penitential act: Devotees recite the following penitential prayer: “Long before I was born and until today, all my deeds, my words and my intentions have been rooted in greed (貪 ton), ill will (瞋 jin) and foolishness (痴 chi), making my presence in the world irresponsible and offensive. I acknowledge that before the ‘all Buddha-presence’ and respectfully implore forgiveness.” Confession in Buddhism is a voluntary act that requires honesty and concentration. If the devotees are not sincere when performing the penitential act, then the sympathetic response of the ‘all Buddha-presence’ will have no affect. The sympathetic response never takes the form of an absolution of bad deeds, but rather, the entangling energy generated by foolish and harmful deeds, can only be diminished through confession. Devotees in many Buddhist countries practice the rite of confession of transgressions, known in Sanskrit as pāpadeśanā. Based on the ritual of the uposatha, during which a Bhiksu (ordained Buddhist monk), confesses any violation of the disciplinary rules to another Bhiksu or to the whole community of Bhiksus (Sangha), the ritual of uposatha goes back to the time of the historical Buddha. Without a ritual to purify devotees of carnal desires, oral expressions, and behavioral intentions, the rest of the prayer becomes meaningless. The penitential act has the ability to transform devotees into portals that connect to Buddha energies.\n\nIII. Three Treasures: After the penitential act, the devotees perform one of the foundational ritual practices in Buddhism known as the ‘recitation of three shelters for Buddhist devotees,’ that is, “I go for refuge to the Buddha (all Buddha-presence); I go for refuge to the Dharma (Buddhist teachings); I go for refuge to the Sangha (Community).”\n\nIV. Three Vows: The devotees then express their faith in liberating powers that can be accumulated by those who have taken shelter in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. The devotees thus say, “I vow that I shall actualize my faith into the Buddha; I vow that I shall actualize my faith into the Dharma; I vow that I shall actualize my faith into the Sangha.”\n\nV. Ten Worthy Precepts: Now, able to actualize their faith in the three jewels (the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha), the devotees cement their practice by utilizing ten extremely efficient guiding precepts. Though the Buddhist traditions believe the following precepts are extremely helpful for devotees who struggle under the effects of entanglement, they are not ultimate divine commandments. Devotees freely decide to engage themselves in a way of life that is liberating, rather than take pride in suffering many privations. This choice testifies that the Buddha path is a worthy path to take. The first three precepts aim at purifying the way devotees deal with their bodily dimension, the next four precepts aim at educating the way devotees communicate, and the last three precepts purify the devotees’ intentions. The devotees recite the following words: “I refrain from irresponsible intentional killing, stealing, committing adultery, telling lies, licentious speech, abusive language, double-tongued speech, greed, anger and evil perspectives.”\n\nVI. Aspiring to Enlightenment (Bodhicitta): In order to live according to the precepts they have just vowed to cherish, the devotees seek help from inner energies so that they may cross over the sea of entanglement characterized by life and death, and reach the peaceful shore of enlightenment. This internal help comes from within, as they try to awaken within themselves dormant liberating energies by reciting this dhārāni three times: “Om bōji shitta boda hadayami” (Om, do arise awakening energies). The recitation of the dhārāni plays a central role in all esoteric retreats of the Shingon tradition. The word dhārāni can be traced to a Sanskrit root dhr, meaning to sustain or support (Basic Sanskrit-English-Japanese Dictionary, 165). The dhārāni is believed to energize the practitioners and protect them from distractions.\n\nVII. Samaya Vows: To awaken liberating energies is one thing, but to cultivate them and make good use of those energies requires a clear engagement to persevere on the path of liberation. That is why devotees use the Samaya (समय) vows for their spirit and the spirit of Buddha to be one. In Sanskrit the Samaya vows point at four important characteristics. The first underlines the fact that the Buddha and the practitioners are equal. It is also the vow taken by the all Buddha-presence to save sentient-beings from the effects of entanglement, and it expresses the fact that the thing, which is an obstacle to liberation, is taken away. It also assures those who have difficulty reaching the fullness of liberation that they will not be discouraged, but will always find renewed energies to train even harder. The devotees thus recite: “Om sanmaya satoban” (Om, I shall reside forever in Buddha’s peaceful land of bliss).\n\nVIII. The Study of Sūtras: “The meaning of the unsurpassed teachings of the Buddha is deep.” Devotees use this sentence to express their intention of taking refuge in the teachings of the Buddha, but even if the devotees study the sūtras for a hundred years, a thousand years, or for eternity, they will not be able to fully grasp the intricacies of the Buddha’s teachings. Today I am graced with the possibility to read, listen and make mine the teachings of the Buddha. I desire that the Buddha make even clearer for me the teachings of the sūtras.\n\nIX. Core Sūtra on Liberating Wisdom (Heart Sūtra): The next section of the prayer is dedicated to the recitation of one of the most popular sūtras in our part of Asia, namely the Core Sūtra on Liberating Wisdom (also known in English as the Heart Sūtra). This sūtra is well known in Japan, and devotees of most Japanese Buddhist traditions are invited to memorize it and recite it regularly. In the context of the esoteric traditions of Buddhism that sūtra is important, as it’s teaching culminates in the recitation of a mantra, “Gyate, gyate, hara-gyate, hara-sogyate, boji sowaka.” Mantra is notoriously difficult to define. In esoteric traditions, mantra is a special type of dhārāni in which all the phonetic elements of the mantra express the truth of Buddhist scriptures. The sūtra expresses in a limited number of words what happens during the millisecond when practitioners move from a state of consciousness rooted in entanglement to the peaceful state of enlightenment. The liberating experience does not make the practitioners leave the ordinary life of suffering and struggling, but it means that ordinary life does not affect the liberated ones in an entangling way. The practitioners who have reached this stage of liberating wisdom find perfect peace and freedom right in the midst of ordinary life. In the millisecond of the passage between two modes of awareness – like as in a near death experience – great fear permeates the conscious processes of the practitioners. It is a calling for the practitioner to stop clinging to the Buddhist teachings and practices, as they have now been rendered obsolete. The sutra is thus divided into two parts. The first part invites the practitioners to nullify all the Buddhist teachings they have valued and followed in order to attain liberation, while the second part invites the practitioners to let a new mode of consciousness affect all their acts, sayings, and intentions. The practitioners thus recite:\n\n“Bussestu Maka Hannya Haramita Shin Gyō. Kwanjizai bosa, gyō jin-hannya-haramita ji, shōken goun kai ku, do issai kuyaku. Sharishi, shiki fu I kū, kū fu is shiki, shiki soku ze kū, ku soku ze shiki, ju-sō-gyō-shiki yakubu nyoze. Sharishi, ze shohō kūsō fushō fu metsu, fuku fujō, fuzō fugen. Zeko kū chū mu shiki mu ju-sō-gyō-shiki, mu gen-ni-bi-zes-shin-ni, mu-shiki-shō-kō-mi-soku-hō, mu genkai naishi mu ishikikai, mu mumyō, yaku mu mumyō jin naishi mu rōshi, yaku mu rōshi jin, mu ku-jū-metsu-dō, mu chi yaku mu toku, imu shotokko. Bodaisatta e hannya-haramita ko, shin mu kege, mu kege ko, mu u kufu, onri issai tendō musō kugyō nehan. Sanze shobutsu e hannya-haramita ko, toku anokutara-sammyaku-sambodai. Kochi hannya-haramita, ze daijinshu, ze daimyōshu, ze mujōshu, ze mutōdōshu, nōjo issai ku, shinjitsu fu ko, ko setsu hannya-haramitashu, soku sesshu watsu: Gyate, gyate, hara-gyate, hara-sōgyate, boji sowaka. Hannya-shin-gyō.”\n\n“When the Bodhisattva Kwanjizai was practicing the profound method of meditation according to the Prajñā-Pāramitā tradition, the Bodhisattva realized and saw that the five components of our awareness are void of permanence, and thereby the Bodhisattva became free from all suffering. Śāriputra, form is none other than void and void is none other than form. Form – it is void and void – this is form. The same can be said of the other four components of awareness, that is, sensation, conception, predisposition and consciousness. Śāriputra, all aspects of what we are aware of are, in character, void. They are not characterized by birth and death, impurity or purity, increase or decrease. Therefore, in void, there is no absolute form, no absolute sensing, no absolute conceiving, no absolute predisposing and no absolute recognizing. There is no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body and no mind; there are no sights, no sounds, no smells, no tastes, no objects felt and no objects conceived. No field of vision, and thus none of the eighteen fields of awareness including the field of the mind. Do not cling to the teachings about the twelve-linked causes of suffering: there is no absolute ignorance and thus there is no absolute extinction of ignorance… There is no absolute decay or death, and there is no absolute extinction of decay and death. Do not cling to the teachings of the Four-fold Noble Truths about suffering, the origin of suffering, the ceasing of suffering and the path leading to the ceasing of suffering. There is no absolute liberation, because there is no absolute goal to achieve. Because the Bodhisattva relies on Liberating Wisdom, the Bodhisattva’s heart is free from obstacles. And because there are no obstacles, there is no fear. Released from all inverted thought and dreamlike delusion, the Bodhisattva enters into the ultimate Nirvana. All the Buddha-manifestations of the past, present and future, relying on the Liberating Wisdom are filled with the unsurpassable Universal Wisdom. One realizes the Liberating Wisdom is the great mantra, the great mantra of enlightenment, the peerless mantra, the mantra beyond compare which is capable of relieving all suffering and dissatisfaction. It is true, not mistaken. And so the Bodhisattva expounds the mantra of Liberating Wisdom. Thus, the Bodhisattva chants, Gate, gate, pāragate, parāsamgate bodhi svāhā.” Core Sūtra on liberating Wisdom.”\n\nAccording to the teachings of Kūkai in his Hannyashingyōhiken (般若心経秘鍵, Secret Key to the Core Sūtra), the sūtra can be divided into 14 lines (Hakeda 264), which can, in turn, be sub-divided into 5 parts. The introductory line describes the setting of the sūtra. In the larger version of the sūtra (25,000 lines), the location is the Vulture Peak at Rajagriha. In the Core Sūtra, the location is no longer an external place. The location is a pure moment of consciousness beyond the opposition of exterior-interior. That pure moment of consciousness allows a disentangled awareness of reality to be permeated by liberating sounds/rhythms. The fear that is generated when one must let go of attachment to any refuge is echoed by joyful and liberating sounds/rhythms. The first line describes the ideal locus for nurturing liberating energies, namely, the moment the Bodhisattva Kanjizai (観自在, Avalokiteśvara), as the Buddha manifestation of Prajna (wisdom), is aware that the components of reality are void of permanent substance. The devotee Śariputra (Sharishi) is now going through the same process accompanied by the soothing sounds/rhythms of the Bodhisattva. The second part invites Śāriputra to stop clinging to the main teachings of Mahāyāna Buddhism. The third part explains the benefits one receives from reciting the mantra found at the end of the sūtra. The fourth part is a dharani about the mantra and finally, the fifth part is the mantra itself. The newly liberated Bodhisattva is now permeated with the liberating sounds/rhythms of the sutra, which become the background for the Bodhisattva’s liberating activities. The sūtra is thus constantly repeated, allowing the Bodhisattva to generate a liberating effect on all what has affected the Bodhisattva.\n\nShingon devotees who repeat every day the Core Sūtra might not be able to explain its content, but they know that Prajña (wisdom) as repeated sounds/rhythms is more liberating than the accumulation of scholarly knowledge.\n\nX. Thirteen Mantras: The recitation of the Core Sūtra is followed by the recitation of 13 mantras. A mantra, in the context of Shingon prayers is a series of Sanskrit syllables adapted to Japanese phonetics, whose semantic meaning is of very little importance. The recitation of those thirteen mantras is thought to be efficacious in producing a disentangling effect, and serves two main purposes. The first purpose is the duty of the living to transfer some of their energies for the benefit of the departed who are still on their path toward full liberation. The living must accompany their departed during thirty-three years. Those thirty-three years are divided into 13 periods, during which a departed benefits from the liberating energies of a particular Buddha manifestation. In Buddhism, death – understood as physical death – is not an ultimate moment but a passage. In a world that is characterized by entanglement and thus frustration, the physical death of someone does not mean an automatic erasure of all the bad effects an entangled life has generated. Members of the family of the departed might have some good memories of the departed, but they have also been hurt and have suffered from the entangling actions the departed performed during his or her lifetime. The recitation of the mantras is a very efficient method of cleansing oneself from entangling memories. It is also a way to make sure those entangling memories will not affect the following generations in a negative way. The Shingon traditions believe that thirty-three years of practice is sufficiently powerful enough to nullify the entangling effects of a departed. The second purpose of the recitation corresponds to the major Buddha manifestations, on which Japanese Buddhist traditions focus. For example, the Pure Land traditions focus on Amida, and the Zen traditions focus on Śhakyamuni. The recitation of the thirteen mantras is a way to pay homage to all the Buddha energies at work on the Japanese islands and are recited as follows:\n\nAcala Vidyārāja (不動明王, Fudō Myōō): Nōmaku sanmanda bazaradan senda makaroshada sowataya un tarara kanman.\n\nSakyamuni Tathāgata (釈迦如来, Śaka Nyorai): Nōmaku sanmanda bodanan baku.\n\nMañjuśrī Bodhisattva (文殊菩薩, Monju Bosatsu): On a rahashano.\n\nSamantabhadra Bodhisattva (普賢菩薩, Fugen Bosatsu): On sanmaya satoban.\n\nKsitigarbha Bodhisattva (地蔵菩薩, Jizō Bosatsu): On kakaka bisanmaei sowaka.\n\nMaitreya Bodhisattva (弥勒菩薩, Miroku Bosatsu): On maitareiya sowaka.\n\nBhasajyaguru Tathāgata (薬師如来, Yakushi Nyorai): On koro koro sendari matōgi sowaka.\n\nAvalokiteśvara Bodhisattva (観世音菩薩, Kanzeon Bosatsu): On arorikya sowaka.\n\nMahāsthāmaprāpta Bodhisattva (大勢至菩薩, Daiseishi Bosatsu): On san zan zan saku sowaka.\n\nAmitābha Tathāgata (阿弥陀如来, Amida Nyorai): On amirita teizei kara un.\n\nAksobhya Tathāgata (阿閦如来, Ashuku Nyorai): On akishubiya un.\n\nMahāvairocana Tathāgata (大日如来, Dainichi Nyorai): On abiraunken bazaradato ban.\n\nĀkāśagarbha Bodhisattva (虚空蔵菩薩, Kokūzō Bosatsu): Nōbō akysha kyarabaya on arikya mari bori sowaka.\n\nXI. The Ray of Hope Mantra: The recitation of the thirteen mantras is followed by the recitation of yet another mantra, The Ray of Hope Mantra (Light Mantra). Before reciting this mantra, devotees bring back to mind the importance of the meaning. They confess the essence of the teachings of Dainichi Nyorai (大日如来) (the main Buddha manifestation in the Shingon tradition), which is contained in the 23 syllables of the mantra. The recitation of the mantra has the power to make the devotees egoless, lowering their guard to be fully affected by the ray of hope that is Dainichi Nyorai (大日如来). Their worries and fears are cleansed and they experience for an instant what liberation is about. The wisdom of Dainichi Nyorai is for them like the full moon shining into their darkness. This is w"
