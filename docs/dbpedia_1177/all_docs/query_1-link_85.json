        "text": "There are a lot of sugar cookie recipes out there, but I’m here to share ours.\n\nSugar cookies are such a fun thing to make and eat. There are so many occasions to make sugar cookies but I think we can all agree that Christmas tops the list. Our family does what we call a ‘Framily’ Christmas Party every year, and I always look forward to it. Everyone wears their Christmas jammies, we decorate cookies, and then we eat cookies. Pretty good party in my book.\n\nNow, there are a lot of techniques to sugar cookies, and the recipes vary in order to get those desired results. Here’s what I’m gonna say. These sugar cookies taste amazing. There are other recipes that hold their shape better than this one, but I honestly think taste is sacrificed to get there. That’s why I love these so much- a classic great tasting sugar cookie, topped with buttercream frosting (and don’t skimp here), and decorated to your hearts content.\n\nStep 1: Make the dough. Cream the first 4 ingredients, then blend in the rest.\n\nStep 2: Seperate the dough into portioned discs and refrigerate until you are ready to roll out. You can roll out the dough right away, or give them 30 minutes of chill time first. Doing these discs make it so easy once you are ready to start cutting shapes. Highly recommend.\n\nStep 3: Cut into desired shapes and bake for 7-8 minutes. Let your cookies cool before you frost them. You can also make them ahead of time and freeze until you are ready to frost and decorate.\n\nStep 4: Make your buttercream frosting. 1 batch of this recipe frosts 1 batch of sugar cookies.\n\nStep 5: Frost, Decorate, and Enjoy!\n\nLet me know when you make these, I hope you love them as much as our family does! Happy Baking!\n\nxo, Sarah\n\nNana’s Famous Sugar Cookies\n\n4.40 from 61 votes\n\nPrep Time 10 minutes mins\n\nCook Time 7 minutes mins\n\nTotal Time 17 minutes mins\n\nServings 3 dozen\n\nIngredients\n\n1 cup Butter, softened\n\n1 1/2 cups Powdered Sugar\n\n1 Egg\n\n1 1/2 tsp Vanilla\n\n2 1/2 cups Flour\n\n1 tsp Baking Soda\n\n1 tsp Cream of Tartar\n\nInstructions\n\nMix Butter, Powdered Sugar, Egg and Vanilla.\n\nBlend in Flour, Baking Soda and Cream of Tartar\n\nChill dough for 30 minutes.\n\nRoll out dough 1/4'' thick on lightly floured surface.\n\nHeat oven to 375 degrees.\n\nCut into desired shapes.\n\nBake for 7-8 minutes.\n\nNotes\n\nNote: You can chill the dough about 30 minutes before you cut out shapes. Or, start cutting out shapes with a portion of the dough and keep the rest in the fridge until you are ready to cut more. Note2: Serving size depends on the size of your cookie cutters. I always at least double the recipe.\n\nTried this recipe?Let us know how it was!\n\nVanilla Buttercream Frosting\n\nby Betty Crocker\n\n4.16 from 19 votes\n\nPrep Time 10 minutes mins\n\nTotal Time 10 minutes mins\n\nServings 12\n\nIngredients\n\n3 cups Powdered Sugar\n\n1/3 cup Butter, softened\n\n1 1/2 tsp Vanilla\n\n1-2 tbsp Milk\n\nInstructions\n\nIn a medium bowl, mix powdered sugar and butter with an electric mixer on low speed.\n\nStir in Vanilla and 1 tablespoon of Milk.\n\nGradually beat in just enough remaining milk to make frosting smooth and spreadable.
