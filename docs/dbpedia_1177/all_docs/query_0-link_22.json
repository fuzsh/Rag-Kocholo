        "text": "\"Safe and Sane\" fireworks are currently being sold in Dublin by local non-profit organizations through Thursday, July 4. The City of Dublin and its public safety departments urge extreme caution in their use while celebrating the Independence Day holiday. Those who purchase fireworks from local organizations should keep the following precautions in mind:\n\n* Always read and follow the safety instructions.\n\n* Never take fireworks apart to build your own fireworks.\n\n* Never allow children to use fireworks without adult supervision.\n\n* Only light one device at a time, and move to a safe distance after lighting the device.\n\n* Never try to re-light or handle \"dud\" fireworks (faulty and unexploded fireworks).\n\n* Fireworks should always be used in safe, open areas and away from buildings, combustibles, dry vegetation, and, especially, people and animals.\n\n* A connected garden hose should be nearby, and a pail of water kept handy for disposal of spent fireworks and \"duds.\"\n\n* Pet owners should keep pets indoors on July 4, as many animals become extremely agitated by the sights and sounds of fireworks. Some of these pets will even run into the streets or run away to avoid distressing situations.\n\nView a fireworks safety video.\n\nWhile Dublin homeowners may use their \"Safe and Sane\" fireworks at any time during the sales period, no fireworks of any type (including \"Safe and Sane\") are permitted at Dublin multi-housing units or at any undesignated park, other City facility, public school, or business parking lot. Residents should also check with their homeowners association (HOA), if applicable, for rules regarding the use of \"Safe and Sane\" fireworks. However, the City of Dublin has four parks where the use of \"Safe and Sane\" fireworks are permitted in the parking lot on the 4th of July, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m.:\n\nAlamo Creek Park (Dougherty Road and Willow Creek Drive)\n\nDublin Sports Grounds (Dublin Boulevard and Civic Plaza)\n\nEmerald Glen Park (Gleason Drive)\n\nShannon Park (Shannon Avenue and San Ramon Road)\n\nIllegal fireworks, which explode in the air or move along the ground, always pose a higher threat, as sparks from illegal fireworks may ignite a fire on dry vegetation or rooftops. Dublin will be increasing enforcement efforts with dedicated law enforcement and firefighters overseeing the parks, as well as other officers patrolling elsewhere throughout the city. Penalties for those caught selling or using these types of fireworks can include heavy fines and jail time.\n\nTo report the use of illegal fireworks, please call Dublin Police at 925-462-1212. You can report illegal activity anonymously.\n\nThe City of Dublin allows the sale of \"Safe and Sane\" fireworks to benefit local non-profit organizations. For more information, and to find the list of organizations and their booth locations, visit www.dublin.ca.gov/fireworks.\n\nAt its meeting held on Tuesday, June 4, the Dublin City Council voted to appoint Councilmember Michael McCorriston as Mayor, following the resignation of former Mayor Melissa Hernandez, who was appointed to serve on the BART Board of Directors. The affirming vote was 4-0. Following the vote, Mr. McCorriston was sworn into office and began serving immediately as Mayor. Mayor McCorriston will complete the rest of the mayoral term, which expires December 2024.\n\nWith the appointment of Michael McCorriston to the position of Mayor, the City Council was still left with a vacancy on the dais. An application, seeking candidates to fill the City Council vacancy, was issued. At its meeting held on Tuesday, June 25, the City Council considered all 17 applications received and interviewed six finalists. Following interviews and discussion, Janine Thalblum was appointed to complete the City Council term, expiring December 2024. The affirming vote was a 3-1 decision with Councilmember Kashef Qaadri dissenting. Following the vote, Ms. Thalblum was sworn into office. Councilmember Thalblum previously served on the Dublin City Council following the passing of Vice Mayor Don Biddle in 2018. She was recently serving on the Dublin Planning Commission.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has begun a \"One Pill Can Kill\" campaign to alert parents, educators, and community organizations to raise awareness about counterfeit prescription drugs. Never trust your own eyes to determine if a pill is legitimate. The only safe medications are those prescribed by a trusted medical professional and dispensed by a licensed pharmacist. Fake prescription pills, commonly laced with deadly fentanyl and methamphetamine, are often sold on social media, making them available to anyone with a smartphone. Just two milligrams, the amount on the tip of a pencil, can be enough to kill an average American.\n\nIn 2023, the DEA seized more than 80 million fentanyl-laced fake pills and nearly 12,000 pounds of fentanyl powder. The 2023 seizures are equivalent to more than 381 million lethal doses of fentanyl. The 2024 fentanyl seizures so far represent over 190 million deadly doses.\n\nIf you ever suspect that your medications are not safe, you can drop off any non-liquid medications at a medication drop-off box in the lobby at Dublin Police Services at 6361 Clark Avenue, Dublin."
