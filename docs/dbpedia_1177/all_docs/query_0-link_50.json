        "text": "Summary[]\n\nBen Lindbergh and Meg Rowley banter about Shohei Ohtani's latest exploits and career-best WAR pace, the Angels' playoff hopes, Corbin Carroll's physique, and Mickey Moniak's fluky-but-fun hot streak, then (20:55) answer listener emails about how big a scandal it would be if Ohtani turned out to be two twins, when managers would choose to take in-game mulligans, and which stat should replace errors in the traditional line score, followed by a Meet a Major Leaguer segment (54:00) featuring Keaton Winn and Ricky Karcher (as well as Joe Jacques and Stan Musial), Stat Blasts (1:18:45) about Zack Greinke and the widest pitch-speed spreads and Jo Adell and the players with the biggest career gaps between their Triple-A and MLB production, plus a Past Blast (1:39:30) from 2021.\n\nTopics[]\n\nWhat if it were revealed that Shohei Ohtani were really two twins pretending to be one person?\n\nIf managers had one chance per game to undo the last pitch, would they use it to save a player from embarrassment?\n\nWhich stat should replace errors in the traditional line score?\n\nMeet a Major Leaguer: Keaton Winn and Ricky Karcher\n\nPlayers with one batter faced who reached on error: Joe Jacques and Stan Musial\n\nLargest number of unique pitch speeds for a pitcher during a career\n\nPlayers with biggest difference in performance between AAA and the majors\n\nBanter[]\n\nShohei Ohtani is great again, far ahead of any other hitter\n\nAngels now at 39-32 \"which by Angels standards, that's pretty darn impressive\"\n\nBen's similarity to Corbin Carroll\n\nMickey Moniak's hot streak being \"a fun mirage\"\n\nFinal notes[]\n\nPlayers who hit the most home runs in the Prostate Cancer Foundation's Home Run Challenge\n\nPast Blast: Atlantic League tries moving the mound back\n\nEmail Questions[]\n\nMax: I have a lot of conversations with my roommate, Jordan, about baseball and most of them center around Shohei Ohtani, obviously. We're both baseball enjoyers, and she's become a pretty big Shohei fan. She doesn't listen to the podcast (for shame!), but does really enjoy the sport. The other day, we were enjoying a weed-fueled conversation about Shohei. She asked me what I would do if I found out that Shohei Ohtani was not one baseball boy, but two--one twin a pitcher, and the other a hitter. I think it would really ruin my ability to enjoy him, and Jordan disagreed. I'd be really interested to know what you would think of that situation. Would that be considered a bigger scandal than the Banging Scheme?\n\nJosh: I was thinking of this question after listening back to episode 1433 (the conversation with Rick Teasley and Yovan Gonzalez about playing through MLB's rule change experimentation, including stealing 1B) earlier this week, and your call for \"wacky hypotheticals\" at the end of the last episode inspired me to actually write you this message.\n\nIf MLB managers were given a one-pitch mulligan they could employ once/game in any non-run scoring situation, what do you think would be the most common scenario in which they would call for a do-over? And do you think this scenario would be strategically optimal?\n\nI'm thinking of the peer-pressure a manager might feel to call for a do-over on a play in which a fielder (or fielders) make an embarrassing error (e.g. Will Craig, RIP) or when the outcome of a play denies a player of achieving a milestone (imagine not ever having to read/think about the Mike Minor 200th strikeout debacle). Do you think managers would be more likely to wait to use their mulligan until the most pivotal point of the game, or would they cave to the emotions of the people they manage?\n\nObviously, I don't ever want this to happen (I'm enjoying the new pace of play), but perhaps it might be fun to consider.\n\nWilliam (Patreon): I can't believe this hasn't been discussed before (at least as an example of pedantry), but it seems to me that the box score is horribly outdated. Specifically, the summary of R/H/E. First of all, Errors have always been confusing in that chart as they're a bad thing, while the other 2 are good. Additionally, if the Visitor has an error that's going to correspond with a greater Runs scored, which is in the opposite corner! So, now that I'm done with the pedantic portion of my email...\n\nWhat would Errors be replaced by in a modern version of the mini box? I'm thinking Walks or even RBIs?\n\nNathan: I just finished reading this Greinke article published June 7th in The Athletic. Among the many nuggets that made me giggle or gasp was one about how \"it is entirely possible that Greinke has thrown a pitch at every mph from 50 to 100\". While I agree it's possible, is it true? How many unique speeds has Greinke thrown a pitch over the course of his career? How does that compare to the league average for starters, and who else might have a similar amount?\n\nStat Blast[]\n\nLargest number of unique pitch speeds for a pitcher during a career[]\n\nLucas Apostoleris from Baseball Prospectus helped Ben with this Stat Blast, using pitch data starting in 2008.\n\nZack Greinke's career began in 2004, so we don't have data on the start of his career.\n\nGreinke has thrown a pitch at every speed from 52 mph to 100 mph, except for 55, 56, and 57, for a total of 46 different speeds.\n\nGrienke is third all time in unique pitch speeds. The leader is Vincente Padilla, with 53 different speeds from 45 mph to 99 mph, missing only 46 and 47. This is particularly impressive because Padilla's career began in 1999, so many of his early seasons are not on record. \"He's the champion of really exploring the studio space.\"\n\nIn second place is Simon Alfredo with 47 unique speeds, ranging from 46 mph to 99 mph, missing 47, 48, 50, 51, 52, 55, and 60.\n\nFor active pitchers with at least 500 pitches on record, the average number of unique speeds is 23.6.\n\nSurprisingly, position player pitcher Christian Bethancourt is in 6th place overall for number of unique speeds.\n\nThe fewest number of unique speeds is 13, by Brandon Hughes and Penn Murphy.\n\nBiggest difference in performance between AAA and the majors[]\n\nIn Episode 1801, we looked a single-season AAA/MLB splits. This Stat Blast looks at career splits.\n\nThe data for this Stat Blast came from Kenny Jackelen of Baseball Reference, which has AAA data going back to 1946. Ben filtered to plays with at least 500 plate appearances or 180 innings pitched at both levels.\n\nElrod Hendricks has the highest OPS drop, losing .405 OPS from AAA (1.061) to MLB (.656).\n\nHitters typically lose around .100 OPS moving from AAA to the majors.\n\nThe player who improved the most in the majors is Aaron Judge, who gained .203 OPS from AAA (.781) to MLB (.983). He's still active, so the gap is likely to narrow as he ages.\n\nThe most improved retired player is Moises Alou, gaining .109 OPS from AAA (.963) to MLB (.884).\n\nFor pitchers, the typical ERA gain is around 0.4. Ben suspects that there is a narrower gap because AAA starters often end up as major league relievers.\n\nThe worst ERA gain is by Scott Klingenbeck, +3.3 ERA, from AAA (3.69) to MLB (6.99).\n\nThe most improved pitcher is Al Hrabosky (\"the Mad Hungarian\") -2.82 ERA from AAA (5.92) to MLB (3.10).\n\nNotes[]\n\nShohei Ohtani is on pace for 50 home runs, 9.6 fWAR, and 10.5 bWAR, all of which would be career highs.\n\nBen likes Corbin Carroll, not only because he picked him in the 26-under-25 draft, but also because \"he's like exactly my size\", with matching height and weight within a few pounds. Carroll is small by baseball standards but is impressive by normal human standards.\n\nBen notes that it is very unlikely that Shohei Ohtani is really two people. There are cameras trained on Ohtani continuously through the game. His interpreter and teammates would have to be in on it.\n\nMeg thinks an Ohtani-twin revelation it would be noteworthy even outside baseball circles, but not a huge scandal.\n\nBen and Meg agree that there's no real benefit to the deception of having a pair of twins play Ohtani. You may as well roster both of the twins. And the marketing opportunities would be fantastic.\n\nBen and Meg believe that managers would not reserve the \"mulligan\" for undoing an embarrassing play. Ben notes that the embarrassing play did occur: There's video of it that will be replayed over and over. Calling a mulligan won't change that.\n\nIncluding the number of errors on the traditional line score date back to the early days of baseball when errors were far more common, particularly since players didn't wear gloves.\n\nBen thinks \"total baserunners\" would be a good replacement for errors. Ben Clemens wrote an article in early 2022 on fixing the line score, and he suggested \"1-base events\" (reaching first base) and \"multi-base events\" (reaching second or further).\n\nBoth of the major leaguers we meet earned a save in their debut. This fun fact contributed to the episode title.\n\nMeg thinks \"Keaton Winn\" is a top-notch pitcher name.\n\nKeaton Winn is from a small town in Iowa, population 200. His major league debut was the first time he had seen a big league stadium.\n\nRicky Karcher has terrible control yet somehow gets outs, making him literally effectively wild. He let slip a swear (\"Holy sh*t!\") in the post-game interview, making him even more an embodiment of the podcast.\n\nOn June 12, Joe Jacques faced one batter who reached on error. This was possible despite the three-batter minimum because the play was immediately followed by an 89-minute rain delay, and he did not come back out when the game resumed.\n\nIn 1952, Stan Musial faced one batter as a position player pitcher. This was a publicity stunt in the last game of the season. In the first inning, Musial pitched to Frankie Baumholtz, his rival for the batting title, who needed to go 5 for 5 to overtake Musial. Out of sportsmanship, Baumholtz batted from the wrong side of the plate and hit a double play grounder but reached base on a bad throw. This was not a hit, so Musial clinched the batting title. (Musial would also get a hit later in the game, so the issue ended up moot.)\n\nYou can pledge to donate a certain amount of money for each home run hit during the Prostate Cancer Foundation's Home Run Challenge. The Challenge has raised over $70 million since its inception in 1996.\n\nThe Prostate Cancer Foundation's recordkeeping is incomplete, so it's not clear exactly which games have been part of the fundraiser. They do maintain an all-time leaderboard, which shows that Albert Pujols and Paul Goldschmidt are tied at the top with 26 home runs each. However, some factual inconsistencies suggest that their leaderboard may have inaccuracies.\n\n[]"
