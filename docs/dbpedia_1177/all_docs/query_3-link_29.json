        "text": "Abraham, Carolyn\n\nThe Juggler’s Children: A Journey into Family, Legend and the Genes that Bind Us. Carolyn Abraham. New York: Random House, 2013. 380 pp. $32.00.\n\nCarolyn Abraham has written a “stunner of a book about tracing her family’s history through DNA analysis. The Juggler’s Children is many things, each one spellbinding: a thrillerish quest for origins, a continent-spanning travelogue and an eye-opening foray into the annals and ethics of genetic science. . . . Abraham’s book is riveting not just because of its superb writing [End Page 423] and suspenseful storyline, but because, in the end, it’s not just about her, it’s about us.”\n\nEmily Donaldson. Globe and Mail, Apr. 20, 2013: R18.\n\nAdams, Clover\n\nClover Adams: A Gilded and Heartbreaking Life. Natalie Dykstra. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2012. 336 pp. $26.00.\n\nFetterley points out that this is a “meticulously researched” biography of Clover Adams that aims to “bring Adams back to life.” Adams was married to Henry Adams, and she suffered from depression as well as the oppressive patriarchal attitudes of her husband and nineteenth century ideology. Dykstra’s biography of Clover Adams is “immensely readable [and] written with grace and ease, compassion and enthusiasm,” according to Fetterley, who applauds “Dykstra’s devotion to her subject and the respect she has shown [Clover Adams] through the literary and scholarly quality of her biography.”\n\nJudith Fetterley. Women’s Review of Books 30.3 (2013): 19–20.\n\nAgassiz, Louis\n\nLouis Agassiz: Creator of American Science. Christoph Irmscher. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2012. 434 pp. $35.00.\n\nIrmscher “tries to salvage what he can of Agassiz’s reputation as a science popularizer, Ice Age theorist, and natural-history-museum founder. He concedes that Agassiz’s worst ideas are hopelessly discredited, but perhaps the more interesting question is why they’ve persisted. As Irmscher’s subtitle suggests, Agassiz may be a ‘creator of American science’—just not in a good way.”\n\nThe New Yorker, Mar. 11, 2013: 75.\n\n“‘Distinctly undelightful’ is how Irmscher describes Agassiz in this evocative new biography. But irreconcilable contradictions make for interesting biographies. And Irmscher doesn’t allow the ‘undelightful’ aspects to disappear in the service of myth making. Instead, he draws out the complexities of his subject and helps us to see them as part of the fabric of 19th-century science. There’s no airbrushing in ‘Louis Agassiz: Creator of American Science.’”\n\nRebecca Stott. NYTBR, Feb. 3, 2013: 13."
