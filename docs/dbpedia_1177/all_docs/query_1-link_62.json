        "text": "The Himalyan honeybee, Apis laboriosa, is sometimes considered to be a form of the rock honeybee, A. dorsata, rather than a separate species. Analyses of potential exocrine compounds produced by both forms revealed that the cephalic and abdominal natural products of these two honeybees shared no common denominators. The sting shaft of workers of A. dorsata is the source of a large series of esters dominated by 1-acetoxy-2-decene. Other major constituents include isopentyl acetate, accompanied by isopentyl propionate, farnesyl acetate, and several other esters. On the other hand, nothing but presumed structural lipids (e.g., ethyl palmitoleate) were identified from sting shafts of workers of A. laboriosa. By contrast, cephalic (including mandibular glands) extracts from workers of A. laboriosa contained Î³-octanoic lactone, whereas comparable extracts of A. dorsata workers contained only structural lipids. The major qualitative differences in the chemical characters between A. laboriosa and A. dorsata are consistent with the designation of these two forms as distinct species."
