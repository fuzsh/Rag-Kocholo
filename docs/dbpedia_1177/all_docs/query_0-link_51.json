        "text": "The “Best Startup” award from the 2024 Prix Galien USA Awards would look great in the glass case over at Micron Biomedical, Inc. — and the GRA-backed startup has a shot at winning it. Yesterday, The Galien Foundation announced that Micron was among the nominees for the award, which “connects startups with major players in the industry in the U.S. and Canada.” https://bit.ly/4coQpuH The Galien Foundation fosters, recognizes and rewards excellence in scientific innovation to improve the state of human health. We’ll know November 7 whether Micron was named the winner – but the nomination alone is quite an honor!\n\nImagine a world where women ALWAYS celebrated each other this boldly, unapologetically, and selflessly. Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles bowed down to Brazilian gymnast Rebeca Andrade on the podium as she claimed first place in the gymnastics floor final today. Apparently Simone said that Jordan asked her, \"Should we bow to her?\" And Simone replied, \"Absolutely.\" “It was just the right thing to do.” Can you imagine? Can you imagine if women didn’t feel threatened by each other’s successes? Can you imagine if women supported other women, simply because “it was just the right thing to do?” This. Is. Everything. The Olympics teach us about more than just sports. They teach us how to be better humans, through sportsmanship. That is, of course, if we allow them. #Olympics, #WomeninSports ———————————————————- 👋🏼 Hi, I’m Kathy! I’m a fractional CMO, helping multi-location businesses build scalable marketing solutions.
