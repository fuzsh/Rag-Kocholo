        "text": "I am currently the Lab chief for the ITM lab and a space physics researcher at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, working with the LAMP, petitSat, Artemis, and SPI missions. As an undergraduate at Augsburg College with Mark Engebretson, I started researching waves in Earth's magnetosphere using ground-based magnetometers in the Arctic and Antarctic. I moved away from waves to focus on geomagnetic storms and substorms during my masters at the University of Colorado Boulder with Dan Baker. Still, I returned to waves with my Ph.D. at the University of Newcastle NSW, Australia, working under Brian Fraser. My Ph.D. thesis was on Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves during the CRRES mission and their relationship to the plasmasphere and radiation belts. During my postdoc at Dartmouth College, I worked on the BARREL mission. I have moved down the field line (from a space perspective) and looked at the population of particles lost due to these interactions and their impact on the ionosphere and upper atmosphere.\n\nToday, I continue to bounce around the heliosphere and work to connect these regions, processes, and analysis techniques across boundaries. Much of my research is cross-disciplinary and focused on space weather - two of the Goddard vectors\n\nCommunity for the Unified Study of Interhemispheric Asymmetries\n\nEarth's Magnetosphere\n\nFrom the CUSIA Website https://cusia.uta.edu/about/:\n\n\"CUSIA is leading in the next generation of theory and models that account for asymmetries imposed onto the geospace system\n\nUnderstanding the effects of interhemispheric asymmetries is a grand challenge that crosses all boundaries in geospace. It is a critical area for understanding solar wind-magnetosphere coupling, magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, thermospheric dynamics, and outflow into the magnetosphere. It remains one of the most glaring deficiencies of our numerical modeling capabilities.\n\n\"At present, no global model or combination of coupled models incorporates all or even most of the existing asymmetries found in nature. This issue is compounded by the interconnected nature of these asymmetries: it is not sufficient to include one or some; all processes must be considered to understand how interhemispheric asymmetries change the fundamental nature of the M-I-T system. This capability void represents a significant impediment to modeling, understanding, and forecasting space and upper atmosphere environment.\n\nA large-scale center approach is necessary to bring together the scientists and resources to update and validate models and theory to properly account for interhemispheric asymmetries. \"\n\nMy service to the larger scientific community has come primarily in four parts:\n\n1) Service to mission coordination and mission leadership which include planing and coordinating projects with other agencies and scientists to conduct pioneering projects, developing experimental investigations, and planning the appropriate approach for data acquisition to ensure the right types of data where collected to help resolve outstanding critical scientific problems.\n\n2) Organizing conferences, workshops, sessions, and seminars for the dissemination of presentable results, and to encourage new collaborative research.\n\n3) Service on professional committees which have allowed me the opportunity to help guide the field through recommending future proposal calls, encourage engagement of the scientific community with their political representatives in the hopes of increased funding for the field, and through recognizing some of our outstanding scientific peers.\n\n4) Service to the science community at large and service to my current place of employment through serving as a reviewer for papers and reviewer and panelist for grant opportunities as well as an advocate for the wonderful science completed at my place of employment.\n\nService to Mission coordination and Mission leadership\n\nLed BARREL collaborations and contact to multiple missions (both US based and interna- tional) including NASA’s Van Allen Probes (US-NASA), Cluster (EU), LOMONOSOV (Russia), ABOVE2 (CA), Firebird (US-UNH and MSU ), AC6 (US-Aerospace Corporation), and CSSWE (US-LASP CU Boulder) as well as with the larger scientific community. I was the BARREL lead for the daily meetings between BARREL and the Van Allen Probe’s instru- ments teams to determine data collection and retrieval during the BARREL campaigns. Other satellite, ground, and CubeSat missions also attended these meetings to determine when they should collect and download data to ensure the correct data type for answering critical science questions for the 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and the August 2015 and 2016 campaigns.\n\nHelped organize and plan the EFW/BARREL workshop and follow up science meetings, 2013- 2014\n\nSuccessfully conceived, planed, and developed experimental investigations and proposed for EISCAT radar time with strong international collaborations for experimental investigations taking advantage of conjugate observations with FIREBIRD, Van Allen Probes, and BARREL for both the 2015 and 2016 campaigns. This work addressed and attempted to resolve scientific problems with identifying the in situ source and scale size of microbursts and other radiation belt electron precipitation events.\n\nAdvocated for the BARREL mission to the larger scientific community and public through near real time dissemination of BARREL progress, observations, and results through the BARREL blog (both one for the public and one for the scientific community), Facebook page, and twitter accounts.
