        "text": "Category 3: attitude\n\nIn the attitude category, that is, the behavior while facing a scenario, was underlined: the management of stress and fatigue through the awareness of one's self-limitations, acting according to an adequate workload, use of coping techniques, and requesting help when required14, 15, 16, 22; and infection control by hand hygiene, antiseptic techniques and proper use of personal protective equipment (gloves, mask and gown).14, 17, 24\n\nAdditionally, it is possible to point out the Six International Patient Safety Goals, advocated by the World Health Organization, whose objective is to achieve high standards of quality in care, with measures that help this development, such as behavioral changes and technological innovation in care1. Knowing and applying the assumptions emanating from them is vital so that the anesthesiology resident can provide a positive attitude towards patient safety.\n\nAll skills regarding patient safety, and even in other areas, can be developed, improved and evaluated through simulations, a matter explored in most of the articles selected in this systematic review. Fehr et al.,12 for example, submitted 35 residents and fellows to 10 scenarios using pediatric perioperative simulation, while Blum et al.15 submitted 30 residents and fellows to seven scenarios focusing on perioperative care pertaining to first-year residents, together with a behavioral scale.\n\nBoth concluded that this method was able to assess the actual level of the residents, since the performance of a scenario was related to overall performance. In the study by Fehr et al.,12 the lowest scores were achieved in the scenario of appendicitis with sepsis, and the highest in the scenario of bronchospasm.\n\nIn the study by Blum et al.,15 based on the average performance of participants, scenario 5 (management of anaphylaxis in a patient with transurethral resection of the prostate and bladder biopsy) was considered the most difficult, and scenario 6 (management of one patient presenting delayed awakening in the operating room after transurethral resection of the prostate) was considered the easiest. In this study, the authors report that 98% of the residents rated the simulations as more instructive than a day in the operating room, demonstrating the importance of such a teaching method for learning patient safety, especially regarding communication skills. Simulation in multiple scenarios helps to identify gaps in residents’ performance and enables adjusting teaching-learning programs.\n\nAdditional studies were carried out by other investigators, like Gauger et al.,2 who assessed 12 residents after being trained to perform needle cricothyroidotomy; Kumari et al.,24 in which 95 residents received suggestions on corrective measures during lectures and practical training sessions; and Blum et al.,22 who enrolled 67 residents to participate in seven simulation scenarios focusing on perioperative care. These three groups of investigators revealed that, after the administration of simulation scenarios and feedback, there is significant improvement in residents' skills in the three categories (knowledge, skills, and attitude). Moreover, in Blum's study, 98% of the residents indicated simulation scenarios as more educational than actual routine situations in the operating room.\n\nCorvetto et al.20 enrolled 30 residents to perform spinal anesthesia simulations and evaluated the number of movements made by trainees, and time for executing the procedure. The authors observed that the highest scores were obtained by third-year residents. According to the authors, the analysis was carried out with procedures in compliance to patient safety. Such teaching methodology demonstrates that there was improvement in the way procedural skills are taught when the authors state and acknowledge that the traditional method must be replaced by a structured method for acquiring technical skills.\n\nFehr et al.12 used 10 pediatric perioperative simulation scenarios for 35 residents and fellows and reported that higher scores were obtained by participants with more training and experience. They also identified that simulation, as a learning method, enables characterizing residents’ progress during the different years of residency. Thus, it is still possible to identify likely gaps while teaching residents and provide support to resolve these issues before residents are granted specialist status.\n\nFurthermore, Komasawa, Berg and Minami23 analyzed the skills of 35 residents before and after training and reported performance improvement for all scenarios, and Gauger et al.21 also stated that study methods such as Problem Based Learning (PBL) or other types of simulations can enhance a resident's self-confidence. This is a fundamental factor for residents to put into practice everything they have learned and to question the procedures performed by themselves and by others around them.\n\nArticles such as those by Riem et al.,13 in which improvement in technical and non-technical skills in 50 residents followed their exposure to a simulated scenario of intraoperative cardiac arrest secondary to a malignant arrhythmia; by Doyle et al.,17 in which medical students, 13 residents of anesthesiology and other areas answered a questionnaire on patient safety; and by Komasawa, Berg and Minami23 also reported a close correlation between technical (hand hygiene; infection control; safe medication practices) and non-technical (trust; decision making; teamwork) skills. Therefore, developing one of these domains automatically improves overall performance by residents. Despite this, in the survey by Doyle et al.,17 most residents claimed to have more confidence in learning technical patient safety skills and less confidence in learning patient sociocultural aspects.\n\nRegarding this matter, similarly, Iblher et al.18 asked 198 anesthesiology residents about what would be the fundamental factors for medical training. From the responses obtained, 10 categories were created. Among them appear learning methodology, with the benefits of simulations and active methodologies already evidenced here; patient safety; supervision; and personal safety.\n\nAs for supervision, the study done by Doyle et al.,17 enrolling medical students and residents, including 13 anesthesiology residents, indicated that the majority (78%) believed it was hard to question authority, and 39% agreed that there is consistency in how patient safety is dealt with by different tutors.\n\nBased on these data, the need to guarantee that the anesthesiologists trained before the curricular changes have access to patient safety knowledge is evident. In addition, as a professional requirement, these specialists must continue learning and improving themselves.\n\nPersonal safety is another category created in the study by Iblher et al.16 On this topic, Oliveira Junior et al.,14 administering a questionnaire to 1508 residents, concluded that 41% of the participants had a high risk of burnout and 22% had positive results for depression. Risk factors included excessive workload (> 70h per week); alcohol intake (> 5 drinks per week); tobacco use; and female gender. Among respondents, the authors identified a percentage of 33% at high risk of burnout and depression, who reported making medication errors, and concluded the study discussing the actual prevalence of depression and even suicidal ideation, relating such symptoms to patient safety or lack of safety.\n\nThese data underlined the significance of physical, but also mental care for residents. In this sense, it is possible to rely on the emotional support of colleagues and superiors and gain new insights from the experiences they have already undergone. It is also crucial that residents recognize their limits and seek professional help when needed. Finally, education and health institutions must maintain a firm inspection to ensure that residents do not exceed the maximum workload established – 60 hours per week.26\n\nOliveira Junior et al.14 state that residents with burnout or depression had worse practical performance, compromising quality of care and patient safety. Dalband, Mohseni and Rosani18 also corroborated this concept by reporting after questionnaire administration to 683 patients undergoing orotracheal intubation during general anesthesia, that 67% of tooth damages caused by residents were due to negligence during the procedure and lack of adequate training, and were considered as adverse events.\n\nCommunication with the team and with patients and their families is another fundamental factor ensuring patient safety and appropriate resident performance. Kumar et al.19 verified, in a questionnaire administered to 127 anesthesiology residents and professionals in the area, that anesthesiologists practicing in private settings are more communicative than those who are tutors at a teaching institution or residents; that there is greater interest in intraoperative communication than in relation to the anesthetic plan; and that the discussion with the surgeon on the postoperative pain control strategy is not prioritized, even in university centers. This lack of communication among team members reduces care efficiency and places patient safety at risk. Furthermore, it does not contribute to promoting a harmonious and less stressful work environment.\n\nDoyle et al.17 also stated that only 78% of respondents reported having enough opportunities to learn and interact with members of interdisciplinary groups. Thus, it is necessary that practicing good communication be fostered and developed.\n\nNone of the authors of the selected articles demonstrated improvement in health care quality associated with a Hospital Accreditation process. It is known that this procedure greatly assists in raising the quality of care, mainly by providing organized and strategic management. Health institutions that undergo accreditation advance in their daily reflection on work processes, and consequently, towards the promotion of a positive organizational culture."
