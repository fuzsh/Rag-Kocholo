        "text": "Was there really any doubt that AJ Preller would push some more chips in ahead of this year’s deadline? That’s all this dude has done the past few years, and here he goes again, following up the steep price paid for Rays righty reliever Jason Adam with another huge haul sent out to land Tanner Scott, arguably the best closer on the market, and Bryan Hoeing. Scott’s command has been notably worse than it was a year ago, but the swing-and-miss stuff from the left side is still very much intact, and he has been especially dominant in July.\n\nAlongside Adam, Scott now joins an already-loaded Padres bullpen that features All-Star Robert Suarez and flamethrower Jeremiah Estrada to make the ends of games for opponents an absolute nightmare. We’ll see if San Diego is able to bolster its rotation before 6 p.m. ET, but at the very least, the Padres have assembled a bullpen that should be able to shorten games for manager Mike Shildt and lessen the load on a thin rotation.\n\nOn the other side of this deal, the Marlins and GM Peter Bendix continue their dramatic rebuild and land an exciting quartet of young talent, especially for a pitcher in Scott slated to reach free agency at the end of the season. For just a few months of Scott, Miami was able to land two arms and two bats with six-plus years of team control and varying levels of ceiling. Not long after dealing Dylan Lesko, their first pick in the 2022 draft, to Tampa Bay for Adam, San Diego parted with their second and third picks from that year’s draft, Robby Snelling and Adam Mazur, to land Scott.\n\nLike Lesko, Snelling’s prospect stock, which was sky-high a year ago, has soured considerably this season as his command faltered at Double-A, but he’s still just 20 years old and projects as a mid-rotation lefty starter. Mazur has been pummeled by big-league bats in a small sample but has four pitches and the ingredients to be a back-end starter if the Marlins — a team that has gotten a lot out of its arms — can help him make the necessary adjustments. Graham Pauley and Jay Beshears look like useful, multi-position utility-type players, with Pauley likely to get a shot in Miami in the very near future and Beshears still a few years away."
