Bush, although the memorial was inspired decades earlier by veteran Roger Durbin. Durbin served under Gen. George S. Patton and in February 1987 he asked US Rep Marcy Kaptur why there was no memorial on the National Mall to honor World War II veterans. Kaptur then introduced legislation to build one, initiating the 17-year journey until it opened.\n\nThe World War II monument is my favorite memorial in Washington D.C. In high school, I spent part of one summer exploring Washington D.C. and taking a writing seminar. As part of the seminar, we had to choose a monument to visit, reflect on, and then write about. I have always taken an interest in World War II, in part due to my Jewish heritage and the atrocities my Great Aunt lived through as a young girl in Romania during the Holocaust. When it came time to choose a monument, I was immediately drawn to the World War II monument.\n\nWhat has always struck me about the World War II monument is all the symbolism and how each detail and piece represented something about the war and the many lives lost. From representing the war in Europe to the war in the Pacific to the hundreds of thousands of American lives lost, the monument produces a sobering effect. Read this article from the National Park Service talking about the various aspects of the monument to learn more.\n\nRead more about the monument’s opening from History.com.\n\nJenna Renaud is a graduate assistant in Falvey Memorial Library and a graduate student in the Communication Department.\n\nLike\n\n0\n\nBy Jenna Renaud\n\nWord of the Week: Type II Fun\n\nMaybe you’re thinking, “I know what fun is,” but did you know that there are different types of fun?\n\nType II fun usually feels terrible while you’re doing it, like climbing up a mountain in the freezing cold, running an ultra-marathon, or standing in line at Disney World in the blazing sun, but when it’s over, your memory erases the miserable parts, and you would do it again for fun.\n\nThis is all based on the “fun scale,” typically used by outdoor enthusiasts. You can read more about it in this article from REI. But in summary the other types of fun are:\n\nType I Fun – Enjoyable when it’s happening. Simply fun. Eating good food with good friends. Celebrating birthdays or holidays with family. Movie nights.\n\nType III Fun – Not actually fun at all. While you’re doing it or in retrospect. Maybe you’re waiting for the Type II fun effect to hit, but it never does.\n\nFor many people, Type II fun is the sweet spot. It’s challenging but isn’t actually putting your life at risk. With finals right around the corner, consider planning some Type II adventures for this summer.\n\nThis Week at Falvey\n\nNOW–Wednesday, Jun. 15th\n\n“That Fairyland of Ice”: Polar Exploration in Mind and Memory Exhibit | Falvey First Floor & Virtual | Free & Open to the Public\n\nTuesday, April 19th\n\nPolar Voyaging and the Humanities | 4–5 p.m. | Virtual | https://villanova.zoom.us/j/98337578849\n\nWednesday, April 20th\n\n2022 Falvey Forum Workshop Series: Capturing the Web – Introduction to Web Archiving | 12–1 p.m. | Virtual | Register Here\n\n“The Politics of the Irish Harp Symbol from Henry VIII to Brexit” Lecture & Harp Performance with Mary Louise O’Donnell | 4 p.m. | Speakers’ Corner | Learn More Here\n\nThursday, April 21st\n\n2022 Literary Festival: Tiphanie Yanique | 7–8:30 p.m. | Speakers’ Corner | Free & Open to the Public | Find more info here\n\nFriday, April 22nd\n\nVillanova Gaming Society Meeting | 2:30–4:30 p.m. | Speakers’ Corner | Free & Open to the Public\n\n2022 Falvey Scholars Virtual Research Presentation and Awards Ceremony | 10 a.m. | Virtual | Register Here\n\n2022 Concept Virtual Recognition Ceremony | 1–2 p.m. | Virtual | Register Here\n\nThis Week in History\n\nApril 22nd, 1970 – First Earth Day was celebrated\n\nEarth Day is an annual event used to demonstrate support for environmental protection and bring awareness to a wide range of environmental issues. 2022 marks the 52nd celebration of the holiday.\n\nEarth Day was started by Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, an environmentalist who wanted to increase awareness and provide unity to the environmental movement. “The objective was to get a nationwide demonstration of concern for the environment so large that it would shake the political establishment out of its lethargy,” Senator Nelson said, “and, finally, force this issue permanently onto the national political agenda.”\n\nEarth Day has contributed to the passage of the Clean Water and Endangered Species Act. Each year the holiday is recognized by 192 different countries.\n\nRead more from History.com.\n\nJenna Renaud is a graduate assistant in Falvey Memorial Library and a graduate student in the Communication Department.\n\nLike\n\n0\n\nBy Jenna Renaud\n\nWord of the Week: Abibliophobia\n\n(n) Someone who is afraid of running out of things to read\n\nI’ve definitely experienced this fear before, especially when getting ready to travel. I’ve always been anti-Kindle and pro-physical books, which has occasionally made it difficult to gauge how many books I need to bring with me when traveling, especially for long flights.\n\nThe good thing about being on campus though is that there’s never a shortage of books in the Falvey collection.

King, age 39, was in Memphis to support a sanitation workers’ strike and was on his way to dinner when he was shot. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital.\n\nThe day before, on April 3, King gave his last sermon in Memphis, saying, “We’ve got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn’t matter with me now, because I’ve been to the mountaintop … And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over, and I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the promised land.”\n\nToday, movements such as Black Lives Matter continue to highlight racism, discrimination, and inequality experienced by Black people.\n\nThe assassination was traced back to escaped convict James Earl Ray. Ray was arrested after being found in a London airport in early June. He was then sentenced to 99 years in prison.\n\nRead more from History.com.\n\nJenna Renaud is a graduate assistant in Falvey Memorial Library and a graduate student in the Communication Department.\n\nLike\n\n1\n\n1 People Like This Post\n\nBy Jenna Renaud\n\nWord of the Week: Offensive efficiency\n\nVillanova is in the Final Four, so we’re back with more basketball terminology this week. Offensive efficiency is the number of points scored per 100 offensive possessions. Currently, according to the popular KenPom Ratings, Villanova has a top-10 offense, despite relying heavily on defense in this past weekend’s win against Houston.\n\nFingers crossed for another big win this Saturday against the Kansas Jayhawks!

On March 31st, 1889, the Eiffel Tower is dedicated in Paris. Gustave Eiffel, the tower’s designer, French Prime Minister Pierre Tirard, various other dignitaries, and over 200 construction workers were in attendance.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower is 984 feet tall and boasts an iron framework supported on four masonry piers, from which rise four columns that unite to create a single vertical tower. There are observation decks on each of the three levels.\n\nDespite now being regarded as an architectural masterpiece, the project was originally met with some resistance, in part due to concerns it would be structurally unsound. At the time, it was the largest man-made structure in the world, a title it held until the New York Crysler building was completed in 1930.\n\nRead more from History.com.\n\nJenna Renaud is a Graduate Assistant in Falvey Memorial Library and a Graduate Student in the Communication Department.\n\nLike\n\n0\n\nWord of the Week: Vernal Equinox (also known as: Spring Equinox, March Equinox)\n\nYesterday marked the official first day of Spring! Each year spring is marked by the vernal equinox, which falls around March 20 or 21 and is when the Sun crosses the celestial equator going north.\n\nEquinoxes occur when the axis of rotation of the earth is exactly parallel to the direction of motion of the earth around the sun. Day and night are about the same length on this day, hence the name “equinox.” The name is derived from the Latin aequus (equal) and nox (night).\n\nNow that we’ve passed the vernal equinox, be prepared for earlier sunrises, later sunsets, softer winds, and sprouting plants—all signs that Spring is here.\n\nThis Week at Falvey\n\nNOW–Wednesday, June 15\n\n“That Fairyland of Ice”: Polar Exploration in Mind and Memory Exhibit | Falvey First Floor & Virtual | Free & Open to the Public\n\nMonday, March 21\n\nMindfulness Mondays | 1–1:30 p.m. | Virtual | https://villanova.zoom.us/j/98337578849\n\nMonday, March 21\n\nThe Interfaith Human Library: Where Books Talk and We All Learn About Life in a Multi-Faith World | 4:30–6 p.m. | Speakers’ Corner | Register Here\n\nTuesday, March 22\n\nScholarship@Villanova–Billie Murray, PhD, on Combating Hate: A Framework for Direct Action | 4–5:15 p.m. | Room 205 | Find more info here\n\nWednesday, March 23\n\n2022 Falvey Forum Workshop Series: Introduction to Digital Archives and Research | 12–1 p.m. | Virtual | Register Here\n\nThursday, March 24\n\nSpring 2022 Digital Seeds Lecture: Matthew Bui, PhD, on “Toward Urban Data Justice: Auditing the Racial Politics of Data” | 4 p.m. | Virtual | Register Here\n\nFriday, March 25\n\nVillanova Gaming Society Meeting | 2:30–4:30 p.m. | Speakers’ Corner | Free & Open to the Public\n\nThis Week in History\n\nMarch 23, 1839 – “OK” enters national vernacular\n\nOn March 23, 1839, the initials “O.K.” are first published in The Boston Morning Post, partially as a joke. It was meant as an abbreviation for “oll korrect,” a popular slang misspelling of “all correct.” However, “OK” then steadily made its way into the everyday speech of Americans.\n\nIn the late 1830s, many younger people would misspell words intentionally, then abbreviate them and use them as slang. Some examples include “KY” for “no use” (“know yuse”) and “OW” for all right (“oll wright”).\n\nOK rose above the rest and made its way into common vernacular even to this day in part thanks to the Boston Morning Post. From there, its popularity continued when it was picked up by politicians at the time.\n\nRead more from History.com.\n\nJenna Renaud is a Graduate Assistant in Falvey Memorial Library and a Graduate Student in the Communication Department.\n\nLike\n\n1\n\n1 People Like This Post\n\nBy Jenna Renaud\n\nWord of the Week: March Madness\n\nThis week instead of strictly defining a word, we’re talking about the origin of the phrase March Madness in honor of the tournament kicking off!\n\nMarch Madness originated from the phrase “mad as March here”; however, it did not come from the NCAA tournament, but rather Henry Porter, an Illinois high school athletics administrator in 1939. In the 1940s, March Madness was used for Illinois state basketball tournaments, before spreading elsewhere in the Midwest region.\n\n40 years later in the 1980s, March Madness came to be associated with the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament, an association many credit to commentator Brent Musburger.\n\nThis Week at Falvey\n\nNOW–Wednesday, Jun. 15th\n\n“That Fairyland of Ice”: Polar Exploration in Mind and Memory Exhibit | Falvey First Floor & Virtual | Free & Open to the Public\n\nMonday, March 14th\n\nMindfulness Mondays | 1–1:30 p.m. | Virtual | https://villanova.zoom.us/j/98337578849\n\nWednesday, March 16th\n\n2022 Falvey Forum Workshop Series: Mastering the Labyrinth: Newspaper–Magazine Archives | 12–1 p.m. | Virtual | https://villanova.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMsfuqsrTsvG9BvwhHkwcD9LIxFsFF0yACe\n\nFriday, March 18th\n\nVillanova Gaming Society Meeting | 2:30–4:30 p.m. | Speakers’ Corner | Free & Open to the Public\n\nThis Week in History\n\nFebruary 15th, 44 B.C. – Assassination of Julius Caesar\n\n“Beware of the ides of March”\n\n2,066 years ago on March 15th, Julius Caesar, dictator of Rome, is stabbed to death in the Roman Senate house by 60 conspirators led by Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus. This day then infamously came to be known as the “Ides of March.”\n\nDespite now being associated with a more ominous connotation, the ides of March has a tamer origin. Ides simply referred to the first new moon of a given month, with each month having its own ides, typically falling between the 13th and the 15th. The ides of March was the 74th day in the Roman calendar and traditionally associated with religious celebrations and at one point, the new year.\n\nJenna Renaud is a Graduate Assistant in Falvey Memorial Library and a Graduate Student in the Communication Department.\n\nLike\n\n0"
