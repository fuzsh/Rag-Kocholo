        "text": "3. Results and discussion\n\nFrom June 2006 to January 2008, a total of 78 dead cats (approximately 10% of the population in cattery A) were received for post-mortem examination in the KVI. Forty-nine cats showed signs of respiratory disease prior to death. Twenty-eight clinical specimens, including BAL, nasal and pharyngeal swabs from cats with clinical symptoms of respiratory disease were also received for bacteriological examination.\n\nClinical disease was characterized firstly by abundant purulent nasal discharge and cough, progressing then to sinusitis, dyspnea, symptoms of pneumonia and death.\n\nComplete pathological examination revealed different degrees of inflammation of the lower respiratory tract in 39 cats. The major gross pathology findings were severe, acute and diffuse bronchopneumonia or bronchioalveolar pneumonia, either suppurative or necrosuppurative. Interstitial multifocal pyogranulomatous pneumonia was present in a few cases. Pleuritis was found in four cases with pyothorax present in one of these cases. Pyogranulomatous meningoencephalitis was found in four cases, two of them showing necrotizing lesions. In one case, necrosuppurative peritonitis was observed. The most common histopathological changes observed were a diffuse mixed infiltrate of neutrophils and histiocytes, with lymphocytes to a lesser extent, thickening of the inter-alveolar septa and multifocal bacterial colonies with cocoid forms. Pathological results were strongly consistent with bacterial infections. In ten cats with clinically suspected respiratory disease, no gross pathology changes could be found.\n\nBacteriology results are summarized in . S. zooepidemicus was the main bacterium isolated from clinical specimens and from dead cats with signs of respiratory disease. From dead animals, S. zooepidemicus was isolated from the lungs in all the cases, and also from the sinuses in a few (data not shown). S. zooepidemicus was isolated from the pleura in two out of four cases of pleuritis, from the brain in three out of the four cases of meningoencephalitis and from the peritoneum in one case of peritonitis. S. zooepidemicus was mostly isolated alone and was mostly dominant in mixed cultures. Interestingly, one strain of S. zooepidemicus (Ct28/07), isolated from the brain in a case of meningoencephalitis, grew only in an anaerobic atmosphere at first, requiring a 5% CO2 atmosphere for growth thereafter. S. zooepidemicus was not isolated from any of the 29 dead cats that were received for post-mortem examination without clinical and pathological signs of respiratory disease, and only from two of ten cases in which respiratory disease was suspected prior to death, but no gross pathological signs were found in the post-mortem examination.\n\nFeline respiratory disease is multifactorial and the role of bacteria is usually regarded to be secondary to viral infection (Greene, 2006) or stressful conditions. Because the vaccination status in cattery A was unknown, the possibility of S. zooepidemicus infection being secondary to viral infections could not be ruled out. Lesions suggesting feline infectious peritonitis were found in a few cases during the pathological examination, but the presence of feline coronavirus was discarded by immunohistochemical stains (data not shown). Lesions resembling feline distemper were also observed in a few cats, but most of these were not included in this report due either to lack of respiratory symptoms or S. zooepidemicus isolation. The prevalence of FHV-1 and FCV was not assessed, but we assumed that these viruses were most probably present in the cattery, as suggested by typical clinical signs of infection with these viruses in some cats. Infections by FHV-1 and FCV are limited mostly to the upper respiratory tract and although they may predispose to secondary infections they do not directly cause pneumonia (Greene, 2006). Stress caused by the transfer and merging of different populations of cats in a single enclosure may have greatly predisposed to the respiratory infections reported here.\n\nAdequate hygienic conditions and ventilation were present in cattery A and the enclosures were apparently not over crowded. Clinically ill cats were treated with antibiotics, but not always fully separated from the other animals. In addition, S. zooepidemicus was isolated also from cats showing minor signs of respiratory disease (data not shown), which probably shed the organism long before being detected and treated. Thus, S. zooepidemicus may have become persistent in the cattery in spite of sufficient hygienic practices and treatment.\n\nTwenty-two isolates of S. zooepidemicus were subjected to molecular typing. Analysis of the V2 fragment of the 16S gene sequences and comparison to reference strains and published sequences revealed two genogroups described before (Baverud et al., 2007) ( ). Israeli cat isolates belonging to the same genogroup showed 100% homology. Cat isolates in genogroup II showed a two nucleotide difference compared to S. zooepidemicus strain no. 14, which was isolated from a case of metritis in a mare. S. zooepidemicus isolates belonging to genogroup I were closely related to Streptococcus equi subsp. equi reference strains EF 406086, similarly to previous work (Baverud et al., 2007). No correlation was found between genogroup and time of isolation during the outbreak. The earliest typed strains isolated Ct4/06 and Ct5/06 were clustered in genogroup II, but Ct6/06, which was isolated within 2 months from the above strains, was clustered in genogroup I. Since some strains isolated early in the outbreak were not typed, it is unknown which genogroup appeared first in the outbreak. In addition, no correlation between genogroup and virulence (as determined by source, dead cat or clinical specimen) could be found.\n\nOne strain of S. zooepidemicus (Ct29/07) included in the molecular analysis was isolated from a fibrin purulent infiltrate in the brainstem region of the skull of a dead cat that was raised close to the place where cattery B was located. The owner of this cat volunteered in cattery B, but it is unknown if this cat was previously raised in that cattery. Cattery B was closed due to poor conditions and all the animals were transferred to cattery A at the time of its establishment. This population constituted most of the cats in cattery A at that time. Close to the place where that cat was raised there was a petting farm, with goats, sheep and other farm animals. It is possible that S. zooepidemicus has been introduced to cattery A by the population of cats brought from cattery B and that those cats were somehow infected either by direct contact with animals in the petting farm or through stray cats in the same region. Strain Ct29/07 was included in genogroup I, whereas early strains in the outbreak were included in both genogroups. By the time this communication has been written, only one other case of S. zooepidemicus outside the aforementioned catteries A and B was found. In this case, S. zooepidemicus was isolated from a nasal swab from a house cat (Ct30/07) and it was apparently not linked to the outbreak described here."
