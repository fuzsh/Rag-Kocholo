        "text": "Unlocking the Future of Maternal Health Begins with Research\n\nApril 11, 2024\n\nProblem statement\n\nMaternal mortality is high in the U.S., and disparities persist. Non-Hispanic Black birthing persons are dying at nearly 3 times the rate of non-Hispanic White birthing persons. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) are uniquely positioned to address this public health crisis, building on historical commitment and demonstrated experience serving the local community, and educating underrepresented students. These students often come from underserved areas with poor maternal outcomes who want to return to their communities to work. MSIs have built trust with their communities and can offer valuable insights to guide research. However, MSIs have historically been underrepresented in federal research funding. In response, HRSA created the Maternal Health Research Collaborative for Minority-Serving Institutions (the MSI Collaborative) to establish a multi-institution research network focused on building the capacity of MSIs to conduct research that addresses disparities in maternal mortality, severe maternal morbidity, and maternal health outcomes.\n\nLearning objectives\n\nAt the end of this webinar, attendees will be able to:\n\nDescribe the maternal mortality crisis in the United States and the impact of racial disparities\n\nDescribe the unique role of HBCUs and other MSIs in understanding and addressing maternal health disparities\n\nDescribe the potential of the MSI Collaborative to contribute to a maternal health research workforce that is more diverse and inclusive\n\nDiscuss the MSI Collaborative’s community-engaged, community-informed, problem-solving research agenda\n\nPresenter\n\nYvonne Bronner, ScD, is professor and founding director of the MPH/DrPH Program at Morgan State University that received accreditation under her leadership. Dr. Bronner earned a BS from the University of Akron (Nutrition), MSPH from Case Western Reserve University, and ScD in Maternal and Child Health from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health (now Bloomberg School of Public Health). Dr. Bronner is the Principal Investigator of the newly HRSA-awarded Maternal Health Research Collaborative for Minority Serving Institutions, which will work collaboratively with 16 funded Research Centers to reduce disparities in maternal mortality and morbidity. Dr. Bronner was a member of the HHS Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality (SACIM), Institute of Medicine (IOM) Food and Nutrition Board for five years, director of the Complementary and Alternative Medicine Research Training Program, and a member of the PhenX national workgroup to develop consensus nutrition genetic research measures, Baltimore’s Babies Born Healthy Leadership in Action Program, the American Dietetic Association’s Board of Editors, FitPregnancy and Essence Magazine Advisory Boards. Dr. Bronner is a member of the American Dietetic Association and was a member of the 2005 U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.\n\nThe National Survey of Children's Health: New Data, Opportunities, and Directions\n\nDecember 5, 2023\n\nQ&A for National Survey of Children's Health webinar\n\nProblem statement\n\nMeasuring and tracking key indicators of health and well-being among children is critical to ensuring the nation is prepared to meet their health and developmental needs as well as to ensure the long-term health of the country. The National Survey of Children’s Health is the largest national survey of children in the US, providing point in time as well as trend estimates on a wide range of indicators related to health status and health services needs of US children, and the family and community factors that can impact those needs. In 2022, the National Survey of Children’s Health finalized content for \"Healthy and Ready to Learn\" -- the first standardized, multidimensional population level measure of school readiness among children ages 3-5 in the US. This measure, in concert with additional content newly added or under development and the implementation of state oversamples allows the NSCH to remain on the cutting edge of children’s health surveillance and research.\n\nLearning objectives\n\nUpon completing the webinar, participants should be able to:\n\nDescribe basic characteristics of the design and content of the National Survey of Children’s Health and how those characteristics impact the ability to address questions of interest related to children’s health and well-being.\n\nReport on 1-3 key estimates or findings from the National Survey of Children’s Health specifically related to the new measure for Healthy and Ready to Learn.\n\nDescribe, in basic terms, 1-2 innovations being implemented or tested for implementation as part of the National Survey of Children’s Health.\n\nPresenters\n\nDr. Reem M. Ghandour\n\nDr. Ashley H. Hirai\n\nDr. Jessica R. Jones\n\nMedicaid coverage of doula services: Understanding the perspectives of stakeholders to expand access and improve implementation\n\nApril 24, 2023\n\nProblem statement\n\nAcross the nation, states are considering, planning for, or implementing Medicaid doula service benefits to better support pregnant and birthing people. However, developing and implementing these benefits requires collaboration from various stakeholders, including doulas, pregnant and birthing people, government officials, payers, clinicians, and hospital administrators. Understanding the perspectives of stakeholders, doulas, and families may help to facilitate implementation efforts.\n\nLearning objectives\n\nAt the end of this webinar, attendees will be able to:\n\nDescribe the benefits of doula support as well as funding mechanisms to expand access to doula care, including Medicaid reimbursement\n\nCompare case studies on the perspectives of Medicaid payers and providers in two states\n\nApply the perspectives of doulas regarding Medicaid reimbursement to their work\n\nPresenters\n\nCassondra Marshall, DrPH, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in Residence in the Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health program at UC Berkeley School of Public Health. The goal of Dr. Marshall’s research portfolio is to promote reproductive and maternal health equity by developing and implementing patient-centered interventions and care delivery models that meet the needs of and improve the health of underserved populations.\n\nJulie Mottl-Santiago, DrPH, CNM, is an Assistant Professor at the Boston University School of Medicine and Certified Nurse Midwife practicing at Boston Medical Center, New England’s largest safety net hospital. Dr. Mottl-Santiago’s research focuses on maternity care innovations to promote equity in health and well-being for families, including Boston Medical Center’s Birth Sisters community doula program. She is currently involved in a state-level grant program for expanding access to community doulas for Black birthing people.\n\nSayida Peprah-Wilson, PsyD, is both a licensed clinical psychologist and doula with specialty in multicultural psychology, trauma, suicide prevention and maternal mental health. Dr. Sayida is the Founder and Executive Director of the nonprofit organization Diversity Uplifts, Inc., through which she regularly offers cultural competency, mental health and maternal mental health trainings and consultations throughout the U.S. Dr. Sayida’s work in maternal health include serving as a doula trainer/mentor, maternal mental health and cultural competency consultant for perinatal health programs in Southern California (Frontline Doulas & Sankofa Birthworkers Collective)."
