Geoff Love (4 September 1917 - 8 July 1991) was a prolific British arranger and composer of easy listening and pop versions of film themes. He became famous in the late 1950s, playing under the pseudonym of Manuel and his Music of the Mountains.

He's best know to us as the man behind the classic Close Encounters Of The Third Kind And Other Disco Galactic Themes which Daza had on cassette and listened to incesantly way back in the 80's. The album was memorable not only for the funky tunes but for its unusual case which had a cardboard outer cover, so it looked like a little hardback book.
