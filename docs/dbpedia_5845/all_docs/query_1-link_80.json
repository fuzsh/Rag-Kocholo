Geoff grew up in Tod and took his first musical steps there on the way to a career which saw him work with some of the world's top music stars and â selling millions of records - become a recording star and showbusiness personality in his own right.\n\nSmash hits\n\nThese included landmark hit recordings by artists such as Laurie London and Danny Williams, whose \"He's Got The Whole World In His Hands\" and \"Moon River\" respectively were UK hit parade smashes with the former a huge hit in America.\n\nManuel and The Music of the Mountains\n\nFrom the 1950s through to the 1980s, Love was everywhere, producing hundreds of top quality musical arrangements for a host of major artists and, under his own name or that of Manuel and The Music of the Mountains, selling millions of records across the world.\n\nShowbiz friends\n\nHe appeared regularly on British television, especially alongside his close friend Max Bygraves, and backed EMI artist Frank Ifield on stage in Las Vegas. While in New York, he and his wife Joy were given a personal guided tour of the city's musical landmarks by big band jazz legend and soon to be the world's most famous record producer, Quincy Jones.\n\nGeoff Love's story is a who's who of music at a worldwide boom time for the record industry â he was a key part of a truly golden era.\n\nLove's legacy\n\nLove never forgot his roots, regularly returning to Todmorden to play concerts with the town's brass band and left an ongoing legacy after establishing the Young Persons Concert Foundation, a showcase for the best young musical talent giving concerts and workshops free of charge with a driving principle that no child should be deprived of live music merely because they did not have access to it.\n\nOrder the book\n\nThe book can be pre-ordered via Todmorden Information Centre, 15 Burnley Road, Todmorden, West Yorkshire, OL14 7BU, telephone 01706 818181, email info@visittodmorden.co.uk and website.\n\nEvents\n\nBookings are now also being taken for the Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon celebration events (Calderdale Big Band on Saturday, September 2, evening at Todmorden Town Hall, £10, 7.30pm; and a celebration of Love's life including screenings of Geoff on TV - his 'This Is Your Life' and 'Brassbeat' with Roy Castle performances, plus a set by Todmorden Community Brass Band - at the town's Hippodrome Theatre in Halifax Road, Todmorden, on Sunday, September 3, 2pm, £5) via Todmorden Information Centre website, which has a special link.\n\nFree Saturday events include a Geoff Love's Todmorden guided walk meeting at Todmorden Town Hall at 11am and the book launch and photo exhibition at the town hall at 2pm.\n\nOn Sunday there will also be a free Geoff Love themed tour of Todmorden Town Hall at 11am."
