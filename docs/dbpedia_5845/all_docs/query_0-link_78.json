        "text": "Geoff Pearce\n\nGeoff Pearce is a Kiwi who has spent about half of his life in Australia in two different periods.\n\nBorn in Leeston, near Christchurch, New Zealand in December 1955, he spent most of his childhood around the Ashburton area, developing a lasting interest in classical music and meeting his first oboe teacher, Ian Harris, who then played cor anglais with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.\n\nAt eighteen, Geoff enrolled at Victoria University. He was taught by Ian Harris, Ron Webb and Luigi Ferletti, and completed a Bachelor of Music in 1977. He also taught oboe, worked as a freelance with the NZSO, Wellington Regional Orchestra and Scola Musica, and was a member of the Wellington Youth Orchestra and the National Youth Orchestra.\n\nIn 1978 and 1979 he played first oboe with the Dunedin Civic Orchestra, also continuing to teach, and then went first to Adelaide to study with Jiri Tancibudek and later to Sydney to play in the ABC Sinfonia and study with Guy Henderson and Josef Hanik.\n\nIn 1989 he returned to New Zealand, resuming freelance professional playing with the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra, and teaching oboe and playing chamber music in his spare time.\n\nIn 1997 he travelled again to Australia, working for a while in non-musical areas, but has now resumed oboe playing and teaching, and currently lives in Sydney. He loves teaching and has more than forty years of oboe teaching experience. To keep himself current, he has also resumed oboe lessons with Josef Hanik.\n\nMore information\n\nArticles by Geoff Pearce\n\nGeoff Pearce listens to orchestral music by Kauder, Apostel and
