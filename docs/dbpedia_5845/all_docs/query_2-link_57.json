        "text": "Easy listening acoustic songs have been around for many years, and have remained popular throughout the generations.\n\nFolk songs are a prime example of some of the easy listening acoustic songs that have remained timeless. Many popular artists that know how to play electric stringed instruments have made acoustic versions of their popular full electric rock band songs, for a different sound.\n\nThe term, “acoustic” didn’t become popular until after the invention of electric guitars, pianos and amplifiers, as a way to distinguish between those versions and styles of music. Now, many easy listening acoustic songs are primarily made with acoustic guitars, but can involve pianos, banjos, mandolins, and dulcimers, as well.\n\nYou can make a great playlist with acoustic music since there are thousands of songs available to choose from by different artists.\n\nGreat classic guitar players, like Gordan Lightfoot, Eric Clapton and Cat Stevens, for example, are what come to mind when you hear the term acoustic music, and “unplugged” concerts hit vogue in the 90’s, as a way to show that they had musical ability, without the aid of fancy electronic gadgetry.\n\nBoyce Avenue have recorded some amazing acoustic cover songs which are perfect to add to your playlist in the 2010’s\n\nThe Pure Form of Music\n\nAcoustic music is to stringed instruments the way “acapella” is to singers that sing music without background music. It is considered a pure form of music that is relaxing and easy to listen to.\n\nIt can come in all forms, such as jazz, blues, pop rock, country, blue grass and easy listening classics, but even fans of heavy metal and punk rock like some easy listening acoustic songs in their playlist, to add a different dimension.\n\nThere are many new bands that specialize in acoustic music, with classic musical training that have appeared in the concert circuits. While originally limited to some of the traditional styles of music like bluegrass, folk and country songs, there are now many types of music being played acoustically that have become popular.\n\nLatino and Spanish acoustic rock and pop top the charts in those cultures. There is New Wave acoustic and “emo” acoustic music that encompasses some of the youngest generation of uplifting and popular styles of music, besides the revival of country and pop rock acoustic music.\n\nIt is easy to find a wide variety of easy listening acoustic songs for your playlist, that are different styles of relaxing and soulful music, comprised of more than the classic country and folk rock songs of the past. Acoustic guitar and mandolin bands, for example are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThere are acoustic cello, violin, and bass bands that put out a unique acoustic easy rock sound, and have made orchestra acoustic pop rock not only interesting to listen to, but have packed concert halls.\n\nThere are many places on the Internet that you can find different styles and videos of today’s acoustic music revival and many of these groups have become popular overnight. You can easily make a playlist of easy listening acoustic songs as a variety to your normal playlist of other styles of rock, country and hip-hop.\n\nAcoustic songs have been popular throughout the generations, but they are a unique style of popular music, even with today’s younger generation.\n\nGoldbass DJ Entertainment"
