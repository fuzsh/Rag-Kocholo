Now the definition is quite simply music that doesn’t over-excite or generate any emotion other than relaxation and pleasure. It is music that is easy to listen to. However, that doesn’t mean it’s simplistic, many great easy listening songs have complex arrangements and while some are instrumentals many have vocal performances of the highest quality. Here is our list of 10 of the Best Easy Listening Songs including our number one that is possibly the best ever recorded.\n\nThe Best Easy Listening Love Songs\n\n10. They long to be (Close to You) by The Carpenters\n\nThis is a truly beautiful example of how an easy listening love song can keep your attention without raising your heart rate. Karen Carpenter’s pitch perfect vocals never rise above a soothing, gently comforting level and, beautifully coupled with the harmonies and piano supplied by her brother Richard, she carries us gently through her tale of love. While she outlines all of the reasons why she wants to be close to her lover the musical arrangement is never allowed to dominate. Strings and even a brass section start to build to a mini crescendo but Karen pulls it back with her laid back voice and the song fades with some of the most precise harmonies ever produced. Close to you\n\nListen To They long to be (Close to You) by The Carpenters On Repeat\n\n9. Killing Me Softly by Roberta Flack\n\nOne of the hardest things for an easy listening love song to do is to demonstrate emotion without raising the listener’s emotions. In this song Roberta Flack wraps her voice around the listener like a warm blanket as she describes how she falls in love with a singer who touches her very soul. The song doesn’t really start or end, it eases in and out and the melodic piano, bass line, Latin inspired percussion and backing harmonies all wash in and out, never taking the listener too high and always allowing Miss Flack’s voice to convey the feelings that she has for this “boy”. Her voice flows over the song, rising a little here and there for emphasis but always comes back to the gentle rhythmic and melodic love song that it is at heart. Killing me Softly\n\nListen To Killing Me Softly by Roberta Flack On Repeat\n\n8. Loving you by Minnie Ripperton\n\nThis song is another example of taking a basic melody and laying a perfect vocal over it. The acoustic guitar backs her perfectly while a gentle electric piano plays a descant melody that flutters over the top of the song. The gentle birdsong and instrumentation all combine to provide a solid base for Ripperton’s stunning vocal performance that convinces but never over-excites. Her vocal range is breathtaking and while the upper range could have been jarring it acts as a perfect counterpoint to the way that she uses her breathing to convey an emotional realism. Loving you is a beautiful example of taking a simple arrangement and weaving it around the perfect vocal performance to create a timeless piece of easy listening magic. Loving you\n\nListen To Loving you by Minnie Ripperton On Repeat\n\nThe Best Easy Listening Rock Songs\n\n7. Sailing by Christopher Cross\n\nWhen easy listening crossed over into rock Christopher Cross seized the opportunity to produce one of the most calming and tranquil songs ever recorded. Sailing opens with subdued and gentle strings that remind the listener of calm water and the guitar melody wanders in to create a mental image of a gentle sailing trip across a calm sea. Cross’ voice, with his signature alto pitch, describes how sailing takes him away from the world’s problems and carries him away to a calming paradise, a journey that he effortlessly takes the listeners on as well. The Grammy winning backing vocal arrangement accentuates the chorus without distracting from the voice and the instrumentation flows underneath, especially the strings which rise and fall like gentle waves and carries the song to its final chord. Sailing\n\nListen To Sailing by Christopher Cross On Repeat\n\n6. Wonderful tonight by Eric Clapton\n\nPutting aside his blues roots and hard rock pedigree Eric Clapton produced a classic of easy listening rock with Wonderful Tonight. His guitar glides across the melody in short but easy lines that flow through the song, while the laid back, almost tired, vocal performance wanders through an evening spent with his “wonderful lady”. This rock ballad sounds simpler than it is though, a careful listen will reveal a lot going on underneath but it is subtle and so beautifully engineered into the track that it allows the listener to be carried away by the sound. The intermittent, and unmistakably Clapton, signature guitar breaks come in and out of the song giving a comforting and familiar feel that simply lets you go with the song’s flow. Wonderful Tonight\n\nListen To Wonderful tonight by Eric Clapton On Repeat\n\n5. Make it With You by Bread\n\nBread’s David Gates penned a beautiful song that fit perfectly into the soft rock sound that emerged in the early 1970’s. Over 50 years later it still sounds fresh and is a wonderful example of easy listening rock as Gates’ voice perfectly flows over the basic accompaniment of gentle guitar held in time by an understated bass line and a gentle drum pattern. His voice is never dull or flat but it is melodic and soothing, gently lulling the listeners into a laid back feeling. Almost two thirds of the way through the song some well orchestrated strings come in that add some definition and fullness to the sound but they never take it over the top, and a minimalist guitar solo wanders in and out creating a relaxing and comforting atmosphere. Make it With You\n\nListen To Make it With You by Bread On Repeat\n\nThe Best Easy Listening Piano Songs\n\n4. All by Myself by Eric Carmen\n\nFrom the opening single chord introduction through the virtuoso solo at the song’s heart to the fade out at the end, Carmen’s song is a masterpiece of Easy Listening Piano music. Even though it builds towards the end he never lets it run away and the song remains true to it’s heart. The lyrics sweep and occasionally soar over the solid chord structure and there’s a brief appearance from a melodic guitar but when Carmen breaks into the incredible piano solo that winds its way around the central melody it washes the listener away on a sea of bliss. Skillfully building and relaxing instrumentation and vocals that wind around the melody in perfect accord with the piano make this a classic piece of easy listening craftsmanship. All by Myself\n\nListen To All by Myself by Eric Carmen On Repeat\n\n3. Ballade pour Adeline by Richard Clayderman\n\nThis too short, beautiful piece of piano mastery shows Clayderman at his very best. He works intricate keyboard runs around the ever present melody which he keeps interesting by dynamic pedal work. With the accompaniment deliberately kept underneath the piano the song is both fascinating yet easy to absorb. His piano work is a study in how to keep the listener’s rapt attention for the duration of an easy listening song. Ballade pour Adeline\n\nListen To Ballade pour Adeline by Richard Clayderman On Repeat\n\n2. Walk on By by Diana Krall\n\nThis interpretation of a Bacharach and David classic by pianist and vocalist Diana Krall shows exactly how to take an established song and turn it into an easy listening classic. Backed by a bossa nova orchestra who lay down subtle rhythms and gently sweeping instrumentals, Krall gives a stunning vocal performance but then tops it with an incredible piano performance. She immerses herself in the song and feels every note that she lays over the tight backing. The whole performance takes the listener to a special place of acceptance and peace demonstrating exactly why Diana Krall is regarded as one of the greatest jazz and easy listening pianists of our time. Walk on By\n\nListen To Walk on By by Diana Krall On Repeat\n\n1. I’m not in Love by 10CC\n\nI’m not in Love by 10CC: written by one half of the band and initially hated by the other half this song brought easy listening and rock music together in a perfect blend of technology and inspiration. With lyrics woven around a sense of confusion and desperation the song keeps everything pared back to rock basics with the band using only a handful of instruments including an electric piano, moog synthesizer and a gently rolling bass line, over a heartbeat drum beat. The thing that makes the song stand out though is the incredible use of layered harmonies that wash in and out of the song, bringing it up and rolling it back when necessary. The band spent over three weeks recording the “ahhh” sound sixteen times for every note of the chromatic scale effectively creating a 48 voice choir for every single note in the song. Looped through a tape recorder a solid bed of vocals makes up the main instrument in the whole song and the more traditional instrumentation supports it in a minimalistic way. The interjection of the whispered “Be Quiet, Big Boys Don’t Cry” on a single outward breath adds yet another mystique to a song that brings easy listening to a whole new level. I’m Not in Love\n\nListen To I’m not in Love by 10CC On Repeat\n\nFinal Words"
