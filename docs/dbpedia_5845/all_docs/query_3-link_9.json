Classic lounge crooners like Dean Martin or country-etched singers such as Glen Campbell offer easy listening pleasures for hard-living fans. Instrumental mavens such as Jackie Gleason, Ray Conniff, and Burt Bacharach lay out lush swing and pop-inflected moodscapes that can work as unobtrusive background music or blueprints for romantic conquest, or conjure up imaginary worlds filled with shining space crafts, densely foliated jungles or streamlined convertibles zipping along lightly populated freeways."
