        "text": "We’re Having a Party - The Geoff Love Singers & Orchestra\n\nSo, as many people are getting their glad rags on for the party season, I thought I’d give this old Music for Pleasure beauty a spin. Just look at that cover, those hips, those flicks. They look like they’re having a right good time and I want some of that action.\n\nThe back cover blurb begins like this: “Humans have been having parties ever since there have been human beings. One of the several good things about the human race is that it is basically fun-loving, hospitable and gregarious, and only too willing to take advantage of any pretext or excuse for a celebration in the form of a party.” Now, that introduction leaves me wanting to know what the remaining ‘several good things’ about the human race are. It goes on to speculate about how the first humans donned their best furs to get down in their caves, serving the dual purpose of having fun and not getting eaten by dinosaurs. But putting on your best furs sounds suspiciously 70s to me, and they hadn’t invented the cowbell yet.\n\nThis record is of the Stars on 45 era, boasting masterful medleys and smooth segues. Take a bunch of slightly posh sounding singers and get them to put their excellent pronunciation to good use on very clean cover versions of old favourites and current (in 1979) hits. Like the Top of The Pops albums of the time, these covers are initially intolerable and I found myself longing to listen to the real Boney M. But then I started to warm to it - there’s genuine inventiveness in those medleys and their construction, and a good segue goes a long way on the dance floor. The 'rock’ medley, featuring the Rolling Stones, really is bad, but so bad it’s good for a bit, and then it’s just rubbish. And the Grease medley truly is a bag of shit. Even 9 year old me would have said so, but without swears. Having said that, I feel tempted to invite my friends round for a party, just so I can test this record on them, but suspect I’ll have to get them very drunk first.\n\nGeoff Love grew up in Todmorden, how about that?! And his contribution to Cheesy Listening is considerable, having sold over 2.5 millions records. You can find most of them in your local charity shop.\n\nVital Statistics:\n\nReleased by EMI on Music for Pleasure in 1979\n\nSide One\n\n1.
