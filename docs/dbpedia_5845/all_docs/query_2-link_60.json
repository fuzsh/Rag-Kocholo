        "text": "It would be fantastic if you could put on a playlist or song that could help you knock out a problem set or memorize all those dates for your history final, wouldn’t it?\n\nUnfortunately, music isn’t quite that powerful. It mostly helps in indirect ways, but those benefits can still make a big difference.\n\nIt reduces stress and improves your mood\n\nMusic doesn’t just motivate you. It can also help reduce stress and promote a more positive mindset.\n\nIn a 2013 study, 60 female volunteers carried out a psychological stress test while listening to relaxing music, sounds of rippling water, or no particular sound. Results suggested that listening to relaxing music makes a physical difference to the way people respond psychologically and physically — in terms of hormone response — under stress. However, the picture is complex, and more studies are needed.\n\nIn a 2021 study, patients in ICU said they felt less pain and anxiety after listening to music for 30 minutes than before.\n\nResearch suggests that a good mood generally improves your learning outcomes. You’ll likely have more success with studying and learning new material when you’re feeling good.\n\nStudying can be stressful, especially when you don’t entirely understand the subject material. If you feel overwhelmed or upset, putting on some music can help you relax and work more effectively.\n\nIt can motivate you\n\nIf you’ve ever grappled with a long, exhausting night of homework, your resolve to keep studying may have started to flag long before you finished.\n\nPerhaps you promised yourself a reward in order to get through the study session, such as the latest episode of a show you like or your favorite takeout meal.\n\nResearch from 2019 suggests music can activate the same reward centers in your brain as other things you enjoy. Rewarding yourself with your favorite music can provide the motivation you need to learn new information.\n\nIf you prefer music that doesn’t work well for studying (more on that below), listening to your favorite songs during study breaks could motivate you to study harder.\n\nIt can increase focus\n\nAccording to a 2007 study, music — classical music, specifically — can help your brain absorb and interpret new information more easily.\n\nYour brain processes the abundance of information it receives from the world around you by separating it into smaller segments.\n\nThe researchers found evidence to suggest that music can engage your brain in such a way that it trains it to pay better attention to events and make predictions about what might happen.\n\nHow does this help you study? Well, if you struggle to make sense of new material, listening to music could make this process easier.\n\nYou can also link the ability to make better predictions about events to reasoning skills.\n\nImproved reasoning abilities won’t help you pull answers out of thin air come exam time. But you could notice a difference in your ability to reason your way to these answers based on the information you do have.\n\nOther research also supports music as a possible method of improving focus.\n\nIn a 2011 study of 41 boys diagnosed with ADHD, background music distracted some of the boys, but it appeared to lead to better performance in the classroom for others.\n\nIt could help you memorize new information\n\nAccording to a 2014 study, listening to classical music seemed to help older adults perform better on memory and processing tasks.\n\nThese findings suggest certain types of music can help boost memorization abilities and other cognitive functions.\n\nMusic helps stimulate your brain, similar to the way exercise helps stimulate your body.\n\nThe more you exercise your muscles, the stronger they become, right? Giving your brain a cognitive workout could help strengthen it in a similar fashion.\n\nNot everyone finds music helpful for tasks that require concentration.\n\nIt can distract you\n\nAn important part of music’s impact lies in its power to distract.\n\nWhen you feel sad or stressed, distracting yourself with your favorite tunes can help lift your spirits.\n\nBut distraction probably isn’t what you’re looking for when you need to hit the books.\n\nIf you’re trying to argue your position in a term paper or solve a difficult calculus equation, music that’s too loud or fast might just interrupt your thoughts and hinder your process.\n\nIt can have a negative impact on working memory\n\nWorking memory refers to the information you use for problem-solving, learning, and other cognitive tasks.\n\nYou use working memory when trying to remember:\n\nitems on a list\n\nsteps for solving a math problem\n\na sequence of events\n\nMost people can work with a few pieces of information at a time. A high working memory capacity means you can handle more material.\n\nResearch suggests, however, that listening to music can reduce working memory capacity.\n\nIf you already have a hard time manipulating multiple pieces of information, listening to music could make this process even more challenging.\n\nIt can lower reading comprehension\n\nCertain types of music — including music with lyrics and instrumental music that is fast and loud — can make it harder to understand and absorb reading material.\n\nWhether you’re looking at an evening of Victorian literature or some one-on-one time with your biology textbook, soft classical music with a slow tempo may be a better choice."
