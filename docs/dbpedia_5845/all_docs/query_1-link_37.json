        "text": "Big Rock Show Hits Tour\n\nMulti-platinum selling, Grammy nominated singer/songwriter Geoff Tate is best known for his 30-plus years as the creative and driving force behind the progressive metal band Queensryche. Since its inception with Geoff at the helm, Queensryche has sold over 20 million albums worldwide and has performed in upwards of fifty countries.\n\nGeoff is regarded as one of the most skilled vocalists in the genre with hundreds of modern, popular artists citing him and his former band as a major influence. Combining social consciousness and expertly crafted lyrics with high-energy, melodically complex music, Queensryche with Geoff Tate at the forefront became internationally recognized as the thinking man's rock band.\n\nAt the end of 2012, Geoff released his first solo album in over a decade titled, Kings & Thieves (InsideOut Music), that was quickly followed by the news of a 25th Anniversary Mindcrime Tour that would encompass the United States in 2013. Also that year, Geoff would release what would be his last album under the Queensryche name, Frequency Unknown (Cleopatra Records), an effort that would feature such guest musicians as Ty Tabor, K.K. Downing, Brad Gillis, Dave Meniketti and Chris Poland along with the members of his version of Queensryche at the time - Rudy Sarzo, Robert Sarzo, Simon Wright, Kelly Gray and Randy Gane.\n\nBeginning in June of 2018, Geoff and the current line-up of Operation: Mindcrime, hit the road to celebrate the 30th Anniversary of Operation: Mindcrime, performing the 1988 landmark concept album from beginning to end in its entirety... It's a show that Geoff loves to perform and fans love to see, only proving that good music never goes out of style.\n\nAs always, Geoff looks forward to the musical journey that lies ahead and canâ€™t wait to perform his next big rock show.\n\nThis show will be hosted in the new reimagined, reconfigured Showroom at Talking Stick Resort.\n\nThe new, more intimate space is not only state-of-the-art space, but is also the ultimate fusion of entertainment and technology. With its massive LED video walls and a crystal-clear L-Acoustics sound system, its features combine for an exceptional entertainment experience only available at Talking Stick Resort."
