        "text": "Photo by Andrea Piacquadio from Pexels\n\nWe all know that electrifying jolt of excitement and joy that rushes through us when we hear our favorite song. We just feel it. Music helps us feel connected to ourselves and to others. Listening to music is a great way to share time with the people we care about, especially our older friends and relatives.\n\nBenefits of Music for the Elderly\n\nNot only can music improve the quality of our lives by helping us connect to other people, inducing all the health boosts of social connection, it also has other positive effects on our health that are increasingly beneficial as we age (https://www.listenforlife.org). Here are a few of those benefits (https://www.webmd.com):\n\nReduce stress, anxiety, and depression\n\nUplift mood\n\nReduce chronic pain\n\nReduce confusion and memory loss\n\nStimulate mental activity\n\nStimulate social behavior\n\nImprove breathing\n\nStabilize heart rate\n\nReduce blood pressure\n\nMany studies show positive effects of music on older adults, particularly those living with Alzheimer’s or Dementia. Music can be used to bring ease and comfort, as well as help the brain access memories (https://www.webmd.com).\n\nHow do Seniors Listen to Music?\n\nPhoto by Anna Shvets on Pexels\n\nThere are many ways to listen to music these days.\n\nNostalgic Devices/Players\n\nSome older adults might find it nostalgic and comforting to listen to music the way they have in the past. This can be done on devices such as tape players, record players, CD players, or even the radio (though this last option can be a hit or miss depending on the availability of radio stations and the music they play). These players and discs/records also make great gifts for elderly relatives and friends.\n\nMP3 Players\n\nMp3 players are another great option that allows the listener more control over the content. There are models available that are specifically designed to be easy to use for older adults, featuring intuitive menus and large buttons (https://www.grayingwithgrace.com).\n\nStreaming App\n\nThe hands down easiest, or should we say, the hands off easiest, way to listen to music is to use a voice activated home speaker device, such as Alexa. With music streaming apps such as Apple, Itunes, Spotify, Pandora, and Youtube, there are so many ways to listen to the music we want to hear (https://www.thegardensatbarryroad.com). Learn more about these devices in our blog covering the top devices for seniors.\n\nLEARN MORE: Allergies & Aging – Can Seniors Develop New Allergies, or Outgrow Old Ones?\n\nSo, What Kind of Music do 80 Year Olds Like?\n\nTo maximize the positive effects of music for our friends and loved ones, it is important to pick music that will connect with them, and their memories, by picking music that they love and are familiar with, which will stimulate memory and awareness.
