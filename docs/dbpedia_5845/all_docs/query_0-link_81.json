        "text": "I have a soft spot in my musical heart for some good ole downhome Delta Blues. I love performers like Dr. John and Allen Toussaint. When I listen to singer-songwriter Jeff Tuohy, I’m immediately reminded of those two legends. There’s a sincerity in Tuohy’s music that is hard to find these days. When listening to him, it’s as if you’re being serenaded by a three-headed dragon that includes the aforementioned Dr. John and Toussaint, with Tom Waits completing the magical beast.\n\nMost likely know Tuohy from his hit song “Bourbon Street,” a love story to the famed New Orleans street.\n\nWith his new album, Hudson Delta, Tuohy just keeps getting better. His songwriting is top-notch, and his music just oozes personality and breathes life into the pictures he’s drawing with his words. At one time, you’ll hear some New Orleans jazz. Then, the kaleidoscope spins and you’re treated to dashes of sincere country tunes. One more spin, you’ve got the soulful grit of Cocker and Waits. Put it all together, and the listener is in for an absolute treat. Hudson Delta has soul and it deserves to be heard.\n\nBecause it’s always fun to learn more about people through their musical tastes, Jeff Tuohy decided to play along. After reading about his tastes, I highly recommend you take a listen to his latest album, Hudson Delta.\n\nFavorite Album\n\n“Many albums hold a place in my heart and psyche, so the answer can vary daily. What came to mind when asked was Closing Time by Tom Waits. It’s Americana at its finest: a lounge jazz trio playing country/folk with colors of muted trumpet and strings. The arrangements are rich and minimalistic, transporting listeners to last call in an empty, dusty saloon. The lyrics capture beauty in the mundane; simple poetry.\n\n“Ol’ 55” is one Hell of an opening anthem; “I Hope That I Don’t Fall In Love With You” reveals a relatable, vulnerable honesty; and “Grapefruit Moon” makes me cry every time I listen. The fact it’s a debut by an enigma adds to the gravity of its relevance.”\n\nOverrated Album\n\n“I don’t like Dubstep and Trap in general. The former sounds like malfunctioning computers in a domestic dispute. The latter- hollow and empty.”\n\nUnderrated Album\n\n“Boombox Eternal by Sam Sparro. The compositions have Prince (my favorite), Madonna, and Janet Jackson vibes with ’90s production in the vein of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. It’s a fresh throwback by a brilliant artist.\n\n“Save A Life” and “Eye 2 Eye” have been in my top ten listening tracks since the early 2020 release.”"
