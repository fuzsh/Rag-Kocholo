        "text": "It’s perhaps the coolest thing about the piano: there are SO many different styles of piano playing. From classical to pop, jazz to bossa nova, this instrument plays a central role in a wide and diverse variety of musical genres. If you want to master the piano in all its glory, it helps to know about all the styles of piano playing that are possible.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT OUR COURSES\n\nClassical Piano\n\nMany of piano’s most iconic melodies come from classical music. Composers like Chopin, Liszt, and Rachmaninoff created the classical piano “sound” nearly everyone has heard. Learning how to play classical music requires technical skill and sight-reading abilities, but it doesn’t have to be a stuffy or strict style of music! Classical pieces leave room for creative interpretation. And you can improvise in a classical style too!\n\nSubgenres\n\nTo be precise, “Classical” technically refers to the time period roughly 1750-1825—the reign of Mozart, Beethoven, Hadyn, and the sonata. Before that, in the Baroque period, preludes and fugues ruled keyboard music. Then, in the Romantic era, visionaries like Chopin and Liszt cemented the central role, image, and sound of the piano. Modern and contemporary classical music continues today through artists like Ludovico Einaudi and Yiruma.\n\nTake a listen…\n\nJazz Piano\n\nJazz is a uniquely American style of music. It arose from the oppression and tragedy of the slavery era and became a popular genre to dance to. But increased musical complexity in later decades made jazz the niche genre it is today. With roots in West African rhythms, call-and-response work songs, spirituals, and ragtime, jazz music is an eclectic mix of inspirations. In fact, what jazz is remains hotly debated. Still, many experts would agree that jazz’s main elements are blues harmony, improvisation, and swing rhythm.\n\nSubgenres\n\nRagtime is very piano-centric: you’re probably familiar with Scott Joplin classics like “The Entertainer” and “Maple Leaf Rag.” Along with blues, it was a precursor to jazz. Important subgenres that emerged in the twentieth century include bebop (a complex style that was meant to be listened to, not danced to), and free jazz (a subgenre that pushes the boundaries of harmonic rules). Meanwhile, cool jazz is a more relaxed style.\n\nKeep reading to learn about another major type of jazz: Latin jazz.\n\nTake a listen…\n\nPop Piano\n\nThe piano has been a pillar holding up popular music for decades. Play the opening notes to “Bohemian Rhapsody” and someone in the room will start belting out the hit. Learning how to play their favorite pop songs on the piano is also the piano entry point for many people. The incredible thing about pop piano is that, with the right tools and basic structure, you can create your own arrangement of a popular song with limitless possibilities.\n\nSubgenres\n\nKeyboard instruments have been featured in rock (cue the virtuosic runs of many Doors tracks), hip-hop (such as in Eminem’s “Lose Yourself”), and many singer-songwriter ballads (Adele and Lady Gaga love using piano). Keyboards were also popular in the 80s when the synth sound became pervasive. Finally, the piano adapts seamlessly to virtually any style of popular music, including EDM (check out this short “Titanium” tutorial) and even death metal!\n\nTake a listen…\n\nGospel Piano\n\nGospel is a beautiful style of music related to blues and jazz. Popular in churches, the gospel tradition is descended from spirituals, many of which the original composer(s) is uncertain. Enslaved people in America found the story of the Hebrews in Egypt relatable, and songs like “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” and “Go Down Moses (Let My People Go)” express hope for a better life. To create that signature gospel sound, it helps to know some key transitions and progressions.\n\nTake a listen…\n\nLatin Jazz\n\nLatin jazz is a unique flavor of jazz with its own sound and rhythm. The most defining character of Latin jazz is the rhythm—some musicians call it a “sway” to contrast with the “swing” style of mainstream jazz. For pianists, the most important concepts in Latin jazz are the montuno and the tumbao. A montuno is a sort of vamp that outlines chords—octaves and syncopation being very popular traits. The tumbao is an accompanying bass line that is played by the piano when there is no bass section. Learn how to play the most popular montuno and tumbao here.\n\nSubgenres\n\nThe two main branches of Latin jazz are Afro-Cuban Jazz and Afro-Brazilian Jazz. A popular subgenre of the latter is bossa nova, which means “new wave.” This relaxed, light style of music first rose to popularity in the 1950s, and it’s what gave us hits like “The Girl from Ipanema.”\n\nTake a listen…\n\nMix’n’Match Styles\n\nWhat’s better than playing a song in one style? Playing it in two—or more—styles!\n\nThe styles we’ve discussed on this page are just the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more out there to explore. And don’t be afraid to mix and match elements from different styles. You can take bits and pieces from your favorite inspirations and create a unique voice.\n\nIf you want to expand your piano vocabulary to include more styles, check out Sangah Noona’s course Expanding Your Musical Style, which is included in the Pianote Membership.
