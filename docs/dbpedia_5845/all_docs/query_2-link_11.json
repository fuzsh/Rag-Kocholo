        "text": "Just a thought but this is based on USA data: to me the states are increasingly like a strange cousin who has gone native, a country I have loved and still love in parts but also find increasingly incomprehensible.\n\nWhat pattern do you think a UK data set would show? Less Christian/ gospel, country and Latin I’d guess, maybe even less R&B/ hip hop. I’d expect more pop and maybe a higher % of rock but not sure what else. Be interesting to see.\n\nKevin\n\nHad no idea Jazz was THAT small..\n\nI subjectively perceived Jazz having some kind of hype lately, might be totally wrong, though.\n\nIt really surprised me, especially given jazz and classical buyers likely buy a heck of a lot more per person than pop buyers, e.g. I’ll regularly buy big expensive CD box sets etc. My Miles Davis collection would be far easier to measure by weight than CD numbers these days it is so huge! Classic 60s-70-s rock buyers will no doubt be similar as it is also an ageing and therefore wealthier demographic.\n\nMore EDM in the UK...if that's what they call House and Techno these days.\n\nOh, is that what it means? I thought it was a typo for ECM and assumed that was why the rest of jazz was so small.\n\nI’m into seasonal.\n\nThank goodness you are not a fan of the smallest category. I don’t think you would have got away with that post.\n\nInteresting to see the difference between the two charts in the original article (with and without streaming included). I suspect that now (two years on) the difference would be even greater.\n\nThis link to a more recent report by the same company states that Hip-hop/r&b has become the most popular US genre. The full report is available download if you're willing to give them all your details...\n\nhttp://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/reports/2018/2017-music-us-year-end-report.html\n\nHi,\n\nIt seems that Jazz had a 1.2% share in the UK during 2016. Classical had a 3.1%.\n\nThe list from 2016. These are the share of units sold.\n\nPop 34.9%\n\nRock 32.3%\n\nMOR/Easy listening 6.9%\n\nR&B 6.2%\n\nDance 5,9%\n\nClassical 3.1%\n\nHip Hop 2.7%\n\nCountry 2.5%\n\nReggae 1.4%\n\nJazz 1.2%\n\nBlues 1.2%\n\nFolk 1.1%\n\nWorld 0.2%\n\nChildren's 0.1%\n\nSpoken word 0.1%\n\nNew Age 0.1%\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics...ic-album-unit-sales-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/\n\nAll makes complete sense to me, Rock having the larger following is not a surprise, Classical & jazz are an acquired listen in the main, hip hop tend more towards the pop end of the market, Rock covers a much larger spectrum than any other genre here.\n\nI agree to a degree. The thing that surprises me is it is based on sales, not number of listeners. I’d have thought whilst small in numbers listeners of genres like jazz and classical were way more spendy. I must shift way, way over £1k a year on music for myself (i.e. not counting the pfm shop) and I can’t imagine that many R&B, dance or pop fans do that. Yes, I was expecting jazz and classical to be in the minority, but not right down at 2%!\n\nI agree to a degree. The thing that surprises me is it is based on sales, not number of listeners.

This forum seems to lean towards the classical/jazz end of the market & why you may think the sales should see a higher percentage?\n\nOf course you could be an oddity who spends WAY too much on music\n\nPop also covers a wide spectrum so will show a higher percentage, it's not called pop for nothing I suppose.\n\nI own very little blues & classical music but enjoy both genre's, I mainly grab it where I can on the internet & listen for free via my laptop streamed to my amp. Some of it sounds a little dodgy, i'm not too fussed, it sounds good enough to get involved & purchase what I enjoy the most, this cuts down on huge purchases as I imagine many pop fans in particular do."
