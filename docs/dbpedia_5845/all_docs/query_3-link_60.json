Just a broad concensus will suffice here, maybe with a few words of clarification. Like i said the list is far from exhaustive and would no doubt be better served with the allowance of more than one choice per member, If thats at all possible? However the choices above do cover a multitude of the major platforms...so feel free to add comments along with your preferred selection. Apologies for anyone not catered for in the list.\n\nTITANS of HOPE\n\nby account deleted by request » Mon Jun 25, 2007 7:49 pm\n\nWhich catagory does Bob Dylan go in (don't say the cr@p one) Sorry to be a pest.\n\nby Bad Bob » Mon Jun 25, 2007 7:56 pm\n\n\"Today's music ain'y got the same soul/I like that old time Rock n' Roll...\"\n\nby red37 » Mon Jun 25, 2007 9:05 pm\n\ns@int wrote:Which catagory does Bob Dylan go in (don't say the cr@p one) Sorry to be a pest.\n\nYou decide. Pretty much touched several genres at any given stage during his career. Anyway, the poll isn't about individual artistes/Bands. Its about the general musical 'field' that you like to listen to and derive most pleasure from.

Love Oasis ,and Travis aswell, but back in the day you coulnt beat the silky tunes of motown\n\nHE WHO BETRAYS WILL ALWAYS WALK ALONE\n\nby red37 » Mon Jun 25, 2007 9:28 pm\n\nGood stuff.\n\nI must be a rarity because i can pretty much find something i enjoy in each and everyone if not ALL the above types of music and many others besides...ones you wouldn't dream of confessing to.\n\n\"Some of the stuff churned out and 'mass-produced' blah blah blah! isn't like it used to be\" arguement just doesnt stand up in truth for me. There has ALWAYS been cr@p released and cottoned onto by a few alternatives who desire to be different all throughout the musical years. And that will forever continue to be the case.\n\nTrue musical genius will withstand the test of time, despite what its compared to. In any age.\n\nTITANS of HOPE\n\nby woof woof ! » Tue Jun 26, 2007 2:03 pm\n\nI listen to a bit of everything from Madame Butterfly through to Iron Butterfly . Guess my personal favourites however would fall under the Ethinic/World choice. Ska, African Township Jive, Chinese Erhu and Irish traditional (love the chieftans).\n\nby Sabre » Tue Jun 26, 2007 5:52 pm\n\nI reached option 2, Rock'n'Roll and I didn't read the others.\n\nSOS member #1499\n\nDrummerphil, never forgotten.\n\nby red37 » Tue Jun 26, 2007 7:30 pm\n\nwoof woof ! wrote:Guess my personal favourites however would fall under the Ethinic/World choice.\n\nMust admit to having a liking myself for all things Reggae especially anything from the 'Trojan' label.\n\nTITANS of HOPE\n\nby woof woof ! » Wed Jun 27, 2007 7:35 am\n\nred37 wrote:Must admit to having a liking myself for all things Reggae especially anything from the 'Trojan' label.\n\nThey put out some great stuff .
