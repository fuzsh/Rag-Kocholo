Her colorful parade of guests continues on AMAZING LOVE, which is dedicated to her late husband of 50+ years, Dr. Hal. This set finds her swaying and swinging through a batch of charming, romantically inclined pop/jazz tunes for different moods of a relationship. She enters into divine duet partnerships with violinist Peter Ferencz of The Peet Project, bassist Brendan Rothwell, saxophonist Ed Calle, and SmoothJazz.com founder, Sandy Shore delivers the “Shore Mix” of the title track. The lovefest extends to her trad jazz arrangement of the French version of the song better known as “Beyond The Sea.”\n\nMike Di Lorenzo\n\nDon't Let GoKeep The Groove\n\nAfter an early career performing at classic NYC venues (Carnegie Hall, Madison Square Garden, The Apollo), working with the likes of Cissy and Whitney Houston and touring with everyone from Gerald Alston to Bo Diddley, NY/NJ based keyboardist/composer Mike Di Lorenzo is quickly closing in on 20 years as an acclaimed instrumental artist. He drops an inspiring and exciting first single from his upcoming full-length, follow-up to his 2023 album PLAY IT COOL with his latest single “Don’t Let Go.” It’s a hip, edgy symphonic jazz romp blending his melodic and improvisational piano magic with soaring synth textures, the punchy emotional soloing of saxophonist Frank Elmo and subtle vocal embellishments by Sonna Rele, who will be prominently featured on the album!\n\nNathan and Noah East\n\nYesterdayEastern Star\n\nTen years after Noah East, bassist Nathan East’s son, made his recording debut in a duet of “Yesterday” with his legendary dad on Nathan’s Grammy nominated self-titled solo album, the duo returns with a completely re-imagined version of the Beatles classic. Since that time, Noah, now 24, has been following closely in the footsteps of Nathan, a longtime member of contemporary jazz supergroup Fourplay as well as Eric Clapton’s band, and has appeared on thousands of recordings. The younger East has established himself as an in-demand touring and session pianist and organist, with performances in Europe, Japan and the U.S. While their original take on “Yesterday” featured Noah’s exquisite piano work and Nathan’s breezy vocals, this new twist from the forthcoming FATHER SONG debut album, offers a slow-simmering, bluesy instrumental highlighting stellar organ mastery, with trademark Nathan East solo improvisation.\n\nVincent Ingala\n\nEscape With MeShanachie Entertainment\n\nSeems like not long ago, Vincent Ingala was Smooth Jazz’s upcoming teen sensation – and suddenly, he’s a 30something core genre artist with 15 #1 Billboard hits, including the 2023 Airplay Song of the Year. With the drop of his sultry and elegant yet often electrifying, ultra-eclectic 8th album ESCAPE WITH ME, the composer, saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist is gunning for a bunch more. Though his bright, infectious originals, including a seductive, keyboard ballad, are hard to top, it’s testament to the timelessness of his style – and love for jazz, pop, R&B and dance music – that the set includes re-imaginings of both a magnificent 60’s Delfonics ballad and a thumpin’ late 90s spin on an Ultra Nate #1 dance hit featuring the soaring guest vocals of Lindsey Webster.\n\nJarez\n\nComing Back AroundJ Star Entertainment LLC\n\nOnce best known for his tours with the late rapper Coolio and appearances on the popular web series “Cookin’ With Coolio,” multi-faceted saxophonist Jarez is now all about embodying his identity as a solo artist, Mayor of J Funk City. That’s also the name of his 2020 album that made him the first indie saxman to hit #1 on all SmoothJazz.com Charts simultaneously. He rules the town once again with his latest single “Coming Back Around,” a summery, high-octane party jam that marks his second off the chain collaboration with bassist Julian Vaughn. Building on their well-established chemistry, the two up their synergistic game with sass and fire, creating a powerful duality throughout while offering several dazzling solo spotlights by both.\n\nReza Khan\n\nMysticalPainted Media LLC\n\nOver the course of his multi-faceted 15-year recording career, Reza Khan has enjoyed several radio friendly Smooth Jazz hits, including one with Nils. Yet the Bangladesh-born, NYC based composer/guitarist’s unique, freewheeling stylistic fusion includes elements of pop, jazz, soul and global influences. His world jazz guitar vibe comes to full creative fruition on the perfectly titled MYSTICAL, which finds him and longtime co-writer, arranger and producer, saxophonist David Mann, imagining a magical album featuring infectious pieces written with specific contemporary jazz greats in mind. Khan’s incredible skills as a musician and magnetism as a studio visionary attracted a dream guest list that includes Bob James, Jimmy Haslip, Philippe Saisse, Mark Egan, Jeff Lorber and Keiko Matsui – who join with Khan to create special collaborations for the ages.\n\nJeff Logan\n\nIndigoFire & Ice Entertainment Network\n\nWhen keyboardist/composer Jeff Logan first reached out to Paul Brown, the Grammy-winning hitmaker was first intrigued by the decades Logan had toiled as a corrections officer while developing his craft. When Brown heard his graceful and infectious, radio friendly compositions and lively piano style, he signed on to produce one song, which quickly evolved into Logan’s new album INDIGO, a tour-de-force collaboration that strikes Smooth Jazz gold. While showcasing Logan’s fresh, ultra-melodic touch on the piano and exciting sense of improvisation, the 10 fanciful, romantically inclined tracks create a dazzling, lightly funky flow that puts a hip, modern twist on a classic contemporary jazz piano sound that may remind listeners of classic tracks by David Benoit, Brian Culbertson and Gregg Karukas.\n\nAl Nesbitt and The Alchemy\n\nA Million Shiny ThingsMad Hat Fat Lip\n\nSince opening 95 years ago, the legendary Chateau Marmont on Sunset Strip has been a beloved retreat for Hollywood creatives craving a temporary home away from the prying eyes of the public and press. With his new four-piece ensemble Al Nesbitt and the Alchemy, the multi-faceted, flamenco rock-driven, veteran acoustic guitarist – who recently scored a profile in Guitar World Magazine-Online – finds a fresh and exciting musical way to explore the rich history of the historic landmark. Fusing his snappy exotic style – influenced by everyone from John McLaughlin to Vicente Amigo – with his passions for film composers like Nicholas Hooper, Hanz Zimmer and Alexandre Desplat, Nesbitt creates an epic journey through time fueled by moody, film noir-inspired jazz and funky, symphonic rock jams.\n\nSteve Oliver\n\nA New LightWide Sky Records\n\nAfter releasing ILLUMINATE in 2018, Steve Oliver engaged in some cool side projects, including a popular duet album with Brian Simpson and a set of acoustic re-imaginings of his greatest hits. Now, the prolific Smooth Jazz hitmaker a journalist once called “musical Disneyland” (for his sunny personality and composing style) is back in snappy, melodic and sonically adventurous radio-friendly mode with A NEW LIGHT. Perfectly in line with his other instantly infectious albums with similarly light-bearing titles, the collection – co-produced by genre mega-hitmaker Michael Broening – offers a blend of funky-breezy drive time jams, gently caressing ballads (one featuring saxman Jeff Kashiwa) and exciting dashes of percussive exotica featuring the one-two punch of his dynamic strings and trademark dreamy wordless and percussive vocals.\n\nShawn Raiford\n\nThe Next StepShawn Raiford Sax Productions\n\nCalling to mind the title of sax man’s Shawn Raiford’s critically praised 2020 debut album, MAN WITH A HORN… While many may call themselves ‘men (or women) with horns, few know what to do with it to create the magic and make an emotional connection! Raiford, who’s been sharing his vibrant and adventurous horn-fire with fans in and around his home base in California for years, continues his breakthrough hot streak by following his recent, top-charting single, a sassy and brassy twist on Silk Sonic’s #1 multi-Grammy winning smash, “Leave the Door Open,” with his 3rd pre-release single, “Vallejo,” from his forthcoming album THE NEXT STEP. This jazzy nod to the original East San Francisco Bay Area hip hop scene sound, pioneered by Mac Dre and E-40 promises to propel Mr. Raiford further into Smooth Jazz star status! Becoming well-known for his live performances, the artist packs his rich, pure, dynamic tones into an entertaining, muscular delivery making for exciting concert productions featuring this supernova.\n\nRainforest Band\n\nGood MedicineSan Francisco Records\n\nWith the release of GOOD MEDICINE, an inviting mix of spirited contemporary jazz, robust funk and sensual balladry, six-piece Bay Area ensemble Rainforest Band confirms its status as one of Smooth Jazz’s most environmentally conscious artists. Launched in 2017 by R&B/Gospel soul veterans Tony Saunders (bass), Vernon “Ice” Black (guitar) and Sylvester Burks (keyboards), the group refashions the eco-minded aesthetic of BLUES FROM THE RAINFOREST – A MUSICAL SUITE, an early 90s “environmental earth music album” created by Saunders’ father, famed keyboardist Merl Saunders, and the legendary Jerry Garcia. While the soaring power and passion of saxophonist Dave Ellis ensures that this collection is more horn-centric than their debut, there’s also plenty of urban jazz and groovin’ soul from Saunders and tasty, melodic guitar magic from Black and Lorn Leber. GOOD MEDICINE will make you feel good!\n\nPaolo Rustichelli\n\nTempus FugitNext Age Music\n\nFollowing the tremendous success of 2023’s “Love Divine” featuring the iconic Miles Davis posthumously, the father of chillout music and Smooth Jazz pioneer Paolo Rustichelli returns with a sexy summer gem and a new guest, sax star Jessy J. The title track to his soon to be released album, “Tempus Fugit” literally translates to “Time Flies.” Yet, it also stands still and traverses back and forth in our minds and here we are, always in the present moment! The non-linear thinking musician delivers a song that borrows musical ideas from the past and present and all the while innovates the future. Press play, turn up “Tempus Fugit” and dance in the moment, reminisce about the past, or plan for the future… This song will allow you to experience all of the above at the same time!\n\nTony Saunders\n\nThe Romance ContinuesBaja/TSR Records\n\nTrue to the title of his 2011 debut album ROMANCING THE BASS, Tony Saunders once said, “I romance the bass like I romance life.” Over a decade later, the two-time Emmy winning Bay Area musician, composer, arranger and producer – who’s worked with everyone from Eric Clapton and David Crosby to Joe Sample and Chaka Khan - keeps the love for his instrument flowing and poppin’ with sensuality, funk and great adventure on THE ROMANCE CONTINUES. Co-produced by Grammy-winner Michael Mani, the effervescent bass melodies are at the forefront while complementing them with keys, sax and trumpet, as Saunders dives into the many musical loves of his life – jazz, gospel, R&B, rock and Latin music – while passionately covering Whitney Houston and paying homage to his late dad, renowned keyboardist and Jerry Garcia collaborator Merl Saunders.\n\nD.S. Wilson\n\nMetamorphosisBig Splash Music, LLC\n\nThough its release is scheduled for 2025, the title of Chicago-based saxophonist D.S. Wilson’s next album, METAMORPHOSIS perfectly captures the full circle evolution from his roots in jazz through decades of playing and recording rock, pop and blues before emerging as a bona fide Smooth Jazz artist in 2018. Testament to his extraordinary melodies and chart success - as well as spotlighted for being a finalist in the illustrious talent competition on board the Dave Koz Cruise - Wilson’s 2023 album SKYLINE was produced by Adam Hawley and METAMORPHOSIS is being helmed by Steve Oliver and Grammy nominee Jeff Carruthers. The sophomore single, \"Telegram\" is a feel-good, joyful jazz jam reminiscent of genre staples like Spyro Gyra and The Rippingtons.\n\nListening Loft : MUST HAVES\n\nDan Alan Levine\n\nOver The MoonDanAlanLevine.com\n\nAcclaimed TV arranger/orchestrator and Tony Award nominee for the score of the Broadway Musical \"Anna Karenina,\" multi-talented pianist/composer Dan Alan Levine says that “one of the nice things about Smooth Jazz is that it allows the spirit and soul to relax.” It’s joyfully ironic then, that the wondrously inviting, infectious tunes on his stylistically eclectic (and perfectly titled) debut album OVER THE MOON are peppy and optimistic. Advance singles are still receiving airplay around the world on Smooth Jazz radio and being featured on some of the most popular streaming Playlists. Mixed and mastered by chart-topping songsmith Peter Ferencz (Peet Project) and driven by light funk grooves that breeze along the pop, soul, jazz, tropical and Latin landscapes – with a dash of classical. Dan’s emotionally compelling melodies come to life with the support of two genre leading ladies, flutist Kim Scott and saxophonist Jeanette Harris. The latest single, \"Sky Skippin'\" (radio remix) is a burner with a freshly reimagined and remixed perspective from Hungarian Smooth Jazz producer and hitmaker Peet Ferencz with live drums, bass and guitar!\n\nArienne hearts Charlie\n\nBig LogWar and Spirit Records\n\nShowcasing a smooth and enticing duo dynamic with a vocalist female and instrumentalist male arrangement that brings to mind adult contemporary icons like Everything But The Girl and Swing Out Sister. Emerging duo Arienne Hearts Charlie celebrates the wonderful notion that collaborating married couples can still be crazy in love. One of a batch of singles that they have released in rapid succession this summer, is a beautiful take on Robert Plant's classic, “Big Log.\" Refashioned in a laid back, soulfully swaying manner featuring the sly, inviting blend of Charlie’s steel guitar (on both lead melody and solos) and Arienne’s dreamy caressing vocals. The artful 1983 song lyrically touches down on life's comings and goings... A song of restlessness and unrequited longing with reference to the open road and introspection. Get ready for lots more to come from this clever musical duo, \"Big Log\" is only the beginning!\n\nPatrick Bradley\n\nRoad Trippin'Patricks Song Factory\n\nJust in time for spring and summer travel plans, veteran pianist/composer Patrick Bradley creates the ultimate free-spirited, let’s forget about the winter, driving tune with his breezy, high-spirited single, “Road Trippin’,\" from his forthcoming album GRATITUDE. After years of brilliant hit-making with Jeff Lorber, this instantly engaging track – the follow-up to the post-pandemic EXHALE album – is Bradley’s latest collab with Smooth Jazz saxophonist and producer Darren Rahn, who co-wrote and produced this new tune, which features the unique touches of a Wurlitzer piano. Deeply rooted in the joy of their shared spirituality, the prolific Bradley-Rahn partnership has blessed us with positive, percussive and jazzy, solo-filled tunes that have the power to clear minds, uplift souls and get toes tapping!\n\nJill Butler\n\nJoyrideJill Butler\n\nIt’s listed as a “Fun Fact” on her bio, but when you listen to multi-talented, genre-busting (blues, jazz, pop soul) pianist, vocalist and composer/producer Jill Butler’s aptly titled, wildly and adventurous debut JOYRIDE, you’ll know it’s truly her ongoing mission – devoting 100% of her time to uplifting the soul and uniting hearts through music. She brings her fiery and frolicsome, homegrown Louisiana lightning to a slate featuring both shimmering, percussive piano driven originals (including tributes to her professional musician parents and regional legend Carol Fran) and fanciful twists on classics by Stevie Wonder, The Beatles, Charlie Chaplain and New Orleans great Allen Toussaint. While ensembling with a cadre of Louisiana Music Hall of Famers, Butler also spins fascinating flute, vibes and organ sounds on her synth.\n\nThe Allen Carman Project\n\nI've ArrivedAllen Carman Music\n\nFive years and six hit singles since releasing their critically acclaimed debut CARMANOLOGY, the title of The Allen Carman Project’s I’VE ARRIVED says it all about the vibrant full-length collection their fans have been longing for. Comprised of those memorable singles and two new freshly funked-out, horn-fired tracks, the set showcases the intricate sonic invention and ever-groovin’ camaraderie between Carman’s hoppin’ bass, Philippe Saisse’s keyboard wizardry and jazzy, high-energy solos and Gumbi Ortiz’s alternately wild and subtle percussive textures. The band’s expansive repertoire features songs for every mood, from laid back romance and breezy mid-tempo coolness to full on Latin party jams. The Project is booking festivals and events across the U.S. in 2024... Don't miss them!\n\nBob Coate\n\nLove Like Thatbobcoate.com\n\nThe first thing you'll see on the website of the keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist Bob Coate is the phrase “Smooth Jazz and Beyond.” More than just clever branding, the slogan captures the stylistically freewheeling artist’s ever-evolving vibe. Easing away from the laid back beachy cool of his earlier singles, his previous two were a festive Latin excursion and an in the pocket, light funk romp with producer Sonix. Continuing not only to move but obliterate the needle of previous expectations, Coate’s upbeat, frolicsome latest single “Love Like That,” finds him blending lighthearted, jazzy piano magic with bluesy organ harmonies over a contemporary, irrepressible groove. In addition to featuring the energetic warm tones of Hungarian saxophonist Peter Herold, the track was produced by Peet Ferencz (Peet Project) and Sandy Shore (SmoothJazz.com) – a remarkable duo that has also produced an ongoing series of star-studded SmoothJazz.com “Songles\" and is opening their studios to artist works!\n\nFahrenheit 702\n\nGettin' In The Game, Vol. 1Jaz-Zay Soul Recordings\n\nFahrenheit 702 brings a sultry, high energy and party vibe to their debut GETTING IN THE GAME, Vol. 1! Named for producer/bassist/group founder Greg Radford’s triumphant return to the music industry after a near-decade hiatus, the colorful Las Vegas centric themes and slick ensemble action make it the perfect soundtrack to a winning streak with a frolicsome night on The Strip. The core members of this Smooth Jazz collective include Radford, power vocalist Diane 'Dedae' Patrise' Spann and saxophonist Keith Marlo are complemented by Grammy & Emmy Award winning Singer/Trumpeter Skip Martin, keyboardist Mike Clark, bassist Walter Jones, guitarists Michael Henegan and James 'JD' Davis, plus Ronnie Foster (organ) and John Wedemeyer (guitar) infuse blues excitement into the delirious swirl of urban jazz, Prince-like funk and Brazilian coolness.\n\nLowell Hopper\n\nPrecious MomentsGet Jazzed Records\n\nDuring his 20-year service in the Air Force, multi-talented guitarist Lowell Hopper started to write and produce his own music while performing and recording with jazz artists in Germany, the Panama Canal and his adopted home state of Florida. One wonders if those lucky folks who heard and worked with him in those days had any inkling that he would one day be one of Smooth Jazz’s most prolific artists who would release 23 albums over 30 years. While Hopper’s 23rd album, PRECIOUS MOMENTS, is laced with funk and soulful fluidity on the his strings – for the most part however, this is an uber romantic mood record, filled with passionate, intimate slow burning and mid-tempo ballads that make a perfect soundtrack to those precious moments we share with loved ones.\n\nJames ‘PJ’ Spraggins\n\nMetamorphosisjamespjspraggins.com\n\nIn 2023, veteran drummer/producer James 'PJ' Spraggins re-emerged after an eight year hiatus with STICK IT OUT, an innovative funk and ballad filled album that was featured on SiriusXM’s Dave Koz Lounge. Now, true to its core, faith-based message of determination and confidence, the multi-faceted artist teams with longtime friend and Grammy winning producer/keyboardist Phil Davis for his latest single “Metamorphosis.” Featuring Davis’ gorgeous, easy flowing piano melody and load of fascinating synth sounds over Spraggins’ hypnotic drums and electronic percussion, it’s a meditative and atmospheric tune that seems expressly designed to help people “chillax” and contemplate the mysterious way life evolves as we live it. Even the extra stuff on this tune is alluring, including the song's pastel butterfly cover art and the Spotify Canvas video displaying the actual metamorphosis of a caterpillar becoming a butterfly.\n\nRon King\n\nMosaicKing Sounds Records\n\nAfter decades as a first call sideman for everyone from Marvin Gaye and Frank Sinatra to Jeff Lorber and David Benoit, Grammy nominated trumpeter/flugelhorn master Ron King knew the perfect guy to collaborate with when he turned his musical creativity towards Smooth Jazz... Guitarist/producer Paul Brown, who told Ron that he needed to write a hit. He’s been doing just that ever since, with numerous charting singles and albums, including his 2023 collection CASCADE, which made the SmoothJazz.com Top 100 Albums of the Year Chart. Laying an inspiring foundation for his upcoming album, King’s latest single “Mosaic” sets the perfect romantic mood, showcasing his supremely silky flugelhorn melody over an easy funk groove, hypnotic guitar and piano harmonies in a dreamy, seductive atmosphere.\n\nRei Narita\n\nZephyrStudio Luna Azul\n\nHaving released ten multi-faceted singles over the past year showcasing his infectious composing, artful improvisation and scintillating piano playing, Japan’s Smooth Jazz hero Rei Narita makes the experience even more joyful with his thought provoking themes and titles. His latest is an inspiring piece called “Zephyr,” referring to the winds of change guiding us into a new way of life for the times we're living in, known as the \"air era.\" The sweeping piano here is dreamy and graceful, and this new single includes a gently hypnotic, glissando passage in the middle, perhaps a nod to change. The title literally means “gentle breeze” or “west wind,” and while Narita’s musical journey is often upbeat, jazzy and grooving, \"Zephyr\" smoothly propels our thoughts forward towards a fresh new perspective.\n\nNils\n\nFeelin' GoodBaja/TSR Records\n\nIf any Smooth Jazz great should be FEELIN’ GOOD, it’s super guitarist, composer, and producer Nils, whose accolade-filled two decade run includes having his hit “Pacific Coast Highway” chosen Billboard’s Song of the Decade and Nils himself being named the #1 Smooth Jazz Airplay Artist for 2021 and 2023. FEELIN’ GOOD is the perfect title for an engaging, uplifting album infused with the prolific artist’s trademark sense of adventure, alternating between snappy, crunchy funk-filled jaunts and sly, moody seductions - all wrapped in the colorful, brass-tinged bow of the cool dynamite he brings to an Earth, Wind & Fire classic. Nils builds on the intricacy of his electric guitar with tasty sonic production details and killer performances from an ensemble featuring Mitch Forman (piano) and Johnny Britt (Rhodes, vocals, horns).\n\nNick Stefanacci\n\nSecretsSweet Lion Music\n\nNick Stefanacci’s rise in Smooth Jazz has been so quick and steep that it’s hard to believe he was a longtime pop fusion artist who started his career touring with artists like Derek Trucks, Ja Rule and DMC. Three years after dropping his picture-perfect collection, COVER TO COVER, rising Smooth Jazz star Nick Stefanacci launches his new EP SECRETS with a sizzling, high-octane tribute to one of the legends he covered, Michael Jackson, complete with a “Billie Jean”-like bass groove. In addition to two previously released singles (including a seductive holiday tune featuring vocalist Rich Aveo), the set features three mid-tempo jazz/funk ballads (one is also a playful romantic vocal) that showcase the power and soaring passion Stefanacci brings to his ever-evolving artistry.\n\nUltrablue\n\nNew York StoriesSRS Records\n\nJohn Smatla, leader of the cosmopolitan global fusion collective UltraBlue, has been on a roll, paying homage to jazz legends since successfully re-releasing the group’s self-titled 2006 release last year. He follows the Earl Klugh tribute “Maria in Blue” with a free-spirited, horn-fired tip of the cap to “Herbie” Hancock, the single’s inspiration. The song features Smatla’s absolutely dazzling melodic and improvisational piano excitement, but there’s an even deeper connection with the intense grooves of longtime Hancock drummer, Trevor Lawrence. Another key element is the lyrical playing and fiery solo by New York saxophonist Eric Knight. Smatla worried it wouldn’t live up to its namesake – but once he let go and chose to have fun, the inspiration led him to a burnin’ final product. The song will be included on Ultrablue’s upcoming album NEW YORK STORIES.\n\nJamie WilliamS.\n\nTongue TiedJamie WilliamS.\n\nA consummate, globally renowned entertainer, saxophonist Jamie WilliamS. has performed over the past quarter century in Europe, Central and South America and the Far East while also doing gigs with everyone from Gloria Estefan and Ricky Peterson to Jennifer Hudson, Justin Bieber and on the Smooth Jazz side, Kim Waters and Walter Beasley. Considering that Hudson sang a Stevie Wonder classic on his debut album AFTER HOURS, WilliamS. – also a Professor of Music Production at Full Sail University - had a tough act to follow in dropping his long awaited second collection TONGUE TIED. Yet he succeeds spectacularly and eclectically, finding his niche with an awesome array of mood swings, from fiery blues funk and silky cool romance to atmospheric chill and a smoky, emotional mid-tempo urban jazz flow.\n\nListening Loft : ESSENTIALS\n\nAmandus\n\nReady To MoveAmandus Records\n\nTo draw whimsical inspiration from his pre-music career, German composer/keyboardist Michael AMANDUS Quast has made a thrilling science out of creating his music career, from his tours with 80s icons (Paul Young, Nik Kershaw, Midge Ure) to these past few years as an ever-adventurous rising Smooth Jazz star. His recent chilled hit, “Earth\" has in fact been spinning and streaming on radio stations and playlists around the global! On this latest Amandus single, the engaging gem “Ready to Move,” the energetic groovster returns to his signature explosive fire of funk. This single offers an instantly hummable, emotionally charged hook with an inventive intertwining synth/piano and sizzling horn from guest German saxophonist (and amazing soloist) Arno Haas!
