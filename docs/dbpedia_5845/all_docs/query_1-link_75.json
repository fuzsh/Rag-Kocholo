        "text": "With the outbreak of the Second World War, Love was called up and joined the King's Royal Rifle Corps. Whilst in the armed forces, Love spent time learning orchestration by questioning musicians how best to write for their individual instruments.\n\nThe Loves Family travelled around Britain as entertainers, but, following the death of his father, the family returned to their grandmother's house in Todmorden.\n\nIn 1959 he and his orchestra recorded an album with British singer Shirley Bassey named The Fabulous Shirley Bassey. It was her first album for the Columbia label.\n\nIn the late 1950s, playing under the pseudonym of 'Manuel and his Music of the Mountains', Love's created his Theme from Honeymoon (1959) which proved popular in the UK.\n\nWhilst working at Columbia, he arranged Laurie London's gospel song \"He's Got the Whole World in His Hands\", a 1957 chart topper in the US.\n\nBy the mid-1950s Love was writing for several recording labels - moving from Philips to Polydor and PolyGram before finally settling at EMI. Whilst at the HMV label he arranged for Frankie Vaughan and Alma Cogan among others.\n\nIn 1964, \"Geoff Love's Music\" backed the British rock duo Peter and Gordon on their first two hit singles (both written by Paul McCartney), the UK and US No. 1 hit \"A World Without Love\" and the top 15 hit \"Nobody I Know\".\n\nHis attempt to keep his identity secret whilst playing as 'Manuel' was impossible due to success, especially in the US in 1959 and 1960.\n\nFollowing his release from the army, Love became a freelance trombonist and arranger, and also played with Stanley Black's BBC orchestra. He also developed his orchestration through the tutelage of the harpist Marie Goossens.\n\nIn the early 1950s, along with saxophonist Harry Gold, his brother Laurie Gold and pianist Norrie Paramor, Love was a member of the 'Pieces of Eight' playing Dixieland jazz.\n\nAlthough Love continued to play trombone at recording sessions (for example with bandleader Lew Stone), he was doing more and more orchestral arrangements. His arrangements were played by the Cliff Adams Singers, Ambrose and Ken Mackintosh dance bands, as well work for television and radio orchestras.\n\nAn extract of his recording, Tico's Tune, was used as the theme tune for the long-running Gay Byrne Show on Ireland's RTÃ‰ Radio 1 station.\n\nBig Bond Movie Themes (1975) featuring a selection of instrumental versions of music and songs from the James Bond film series from Dr. No up to The Man with the Golden Gun (including Burt Bacharach's Casino Royale from the 1967 spoof Bond film) has since become one of Love's most sought after MFP albums.\n\nDuring the 1960s and into the 1970s, Love recorded many albums for MFP, often featuring film or television themes such as: Big Western Movie Themes (1969), Big War Movie Themes (1971), Big Suspense Movie Themes (1972), Your Top TV Themes (1972), Big Terror Movie Themes (1976) and other instrumental and disco music. One of these MFP sets was called Glad with Love - which featured the pianist Mrs Mills and Geoff Love on a sing-along together - with studio audience participation.\n\nOne of Love's most recognised arrangements was \"Rodrigo's Guitar Concerto De Aranjuez (Theme From 2nd Movement)\" by Manuel and the Music of the Mountains, which reached No. 3 on the UK charts. This was announced as the number one single in the United Kingdom in February 1976 but the chart was withdrawn four hours later due to compilation errors, making it the shortest period that a song had been number one.\n\nHe was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1975 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.\n\nIn 1955 Geoff Love formed his own band for the television show On the Town, and went on to make numerous recordings.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Love was the co-founder (with Bill Starling) of the Young Person's Concert Foundation. He travelled the country with this charity promoting music to schools and other venues."
