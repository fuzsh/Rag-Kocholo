Does anyone know of a good source for a vinyl rip of this great album?\n\nThanks for any help you can offer\n\nYou'll need to hunt down an LP, and it may need to be bought from an overseas dealer. UK most likely.\n\nJust bumping this to see if anyone might have an idea where I can find a vinyl rip of this fantastic album.\n\nThanks"
