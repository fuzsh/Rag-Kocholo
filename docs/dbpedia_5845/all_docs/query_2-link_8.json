        "text": "There's a whole universe of classical music full of new instrumental music, there's an an entire universe of non-idiomatic free improvised music that specifically is conceived of not to be jazz even though it's improvised music, there's this whole work of new instrumental spa and relaxation and new age kind of music (some of it has electronic elements, some not), there are people still playing instrumental raga, etc. If you're only looking at the Anglo-American popular music of the day -- and popular music typically consists of dance music in the currently popular rhythms, sentimental ballads, and novelty songs -- you're going to encounter mostly vocal music, and the dance instrumental music you're going to encounter is going to be in the popular social dance styles of today's young people, so you're going to hear EDM, not the hustle or the fox trot. If you're asking why aren't there radio hits today that consist of instrumental music played with mechanical instruments but not in the popular dance style of today, well...do you really not know the answer to that question? Popular music styles change, and especially popular dance music, which is the social and courtship music of young people. The rhythms, the sounds, the forms. If you want to hear what kinds of different instrumental music outside of jazz and classical and world music and soundtrack music and free improv is being made today, maybe hit Spotify and search for like \"chill out instrumental\" playlists, or \"relaxation\" playlists or something like that.\n\nPersonally, I mostly listen to instrumental music and I hear tons of great and interesting new music every year. Most of it is nominally jazz, but a lot of that is so typically far afield of traditional jazz that some might say it's not jazz at all.\n\nI grew up the likes of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and The Incredible Jimmy Smith. To me, that's jazz music. Herb Alpert and Henri Mancini, whom I also grew up with, are easy listening.\n\nI like them too, but they are not real jazz. I remember when those two, and others, were heavily criticized for not being real jazz.\n\nWhat i'm trying to do is steer recommendations away from jazz. Some of the artists and music I like do have jazz elements, they are not properly jazz. Take MFSB: they combined elements of several genres.\n\nMaybe I should just stick to the old stuff."
