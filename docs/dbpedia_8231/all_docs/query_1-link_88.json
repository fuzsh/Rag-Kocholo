        "text": "Here is an article that I wrote about JEF United for the spring edition of the New Gateway:\n\nHome team JEF United Ichihara Chiba is kicking off its 16th season as a first-division club in the Japan league (J. League). The team holds the record for being the only team to maintain its first-division position. There is no doubt that 2008 will be a turning point. Croatian Josip Kuze, who has had experience as manager of Gamba Osaka, is set to take over as the new manager of the club. Though many key players left since the end of last season, younger players now have the opportunity to shine. Make sure to catch them on the pitch.\n\nFuku-ari’s Appeal"
