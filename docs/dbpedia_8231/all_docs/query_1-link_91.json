        "text": "Japanese Americans Who Served the Fatherland During World War II\n\nApproximately 20,000 second-generation Japanese (Nisei), born in the United States, spent World War II in Japan. There were at one time some 50,000 Nisei in Japan; see excerpts below. Even though they were American citizens, because of a special law the Japanese Government regarded them as citizens of Japan. Incidentally, many Nisei in the United States had dual citizenship; in the Territory of Hawaii alone, some 60% of the Nisei were also Japanese citizens (i.e. over one-third of Japanese in the territory were dual citizens). Per a US Navy Dept. intelligence report: \"Out of a total Japanese population of 320,000 in the United States and its possessions, it is estimated that more than 127,000 have dual citizenship. This estimate is based on the fact that more than 52% of American born Japanese fall into this category.\" Per Roehner's research (2014):\n\nFor the 158,000 residents of Japanese ancestry in the Territory of Hawaii, the figures (in 1940) were as follows:\n\nJapanese aliens: 38,000\n\nDual Japanese-US citizens: 55,000\n\nNon-dual US citizens: 65,000\n\nFor the 162,000 residents of Japanese ancestry in the continental United States, the figures (in 1940) were as follows:\n\nJapanese aliens: 38,000\n\nDual Japanese-US citizens: 62,000\n\nNon-dual US citizens: 62,000\n\nHundreds of Nisei in Japan worked for the Imperial Government as translators and interpreters, some as guards at POW camps, and some even fought in the Imperial Japan armed forces. Official Japanese figures state that 1,648 Nisei had joined the Imperial forces; other estimates are as high as 7,000, but the true figure would be much higher if one considered the many other areas of sub-contracted work that supported the military. After the war, only 10,000 Nisei were allowed to return to the United States; quite a number remained in Japan and worked for the Occupation Forces. The US Military Intelligence Division produced in Aug. 1945 a 430-page document (names A-J, K-O, S-Y) listing Japanese, including a number of American-born Nisei, who were \"reported to be loyal\" and \"expected to cooperate\" with the Occupation Forces (N.B. the Nisei were \"reported to be loyal,\" yet there is no record of their being interned in Japan).\n\nDuplicity was normal then and no one thought it strange -- but to most Americans suddenly confronted with an aggressive Japan, it was paramount to being a traitor. The trial of \"Tokyo Rose\" is well known, and there were several others who were tried for their anti-American actions. The whole subject seems to be somewhat a taboo topic -- to many, no doubt, it is embarassing to talk about their chameleon-like past. You will not find this data on any other website, and even Wikipedia's page on Japanese-Americans will not sanction such data to be disseminated.\n\nIt is, nevertheless, a historical fact. You will find here an assortment of news articles and archival material which reveals the other side of these Nisei who were in Japan during WWII (alphabetical index here). This list is only a fraction of the total. I have also included below some who were probably not directly connected with the Japanese military. Further research is being conducted by author and professor-emeritus Hawaii, John Stephan, who is hoping to publish his massive work on the Nisei, Call of Ancestry: American Nikkei in Imperial Japan, 1895-1945; when he does, it will be noted on this page as the go-to reference book on the Nisei in Japan.\n\nFor further info regarding the numbers of Nisei in Japan, here this from my page on Civilian Internment Camps in Japan:\n\nFigures do not include Japanese-Americans (Nisei), who, in accordance with wartime directives issued by Japan's Ministry of Home Affairs, were to be treated as Japanese nationals. As for the numbers of Nisei in Japan, \"Japanese figures show that in 1937 there were 50,000 American citizens of Japanese ancestry residing in Japan\" (Gentlemen of Japan by Haven, 1944) -- the Japan Foreign Office urged these kibei shimin (American returnee citizens) to return to the US. Approximately 20,000 Nisei were living in Japan in 1940 (Zaibei Nihonjinshi, 1940). According to an estimate by the U.S. Consulate in Yokohama, some 15,000 Nisei were residing in Japan at the end of the war, 10,000 of whom were eligible to return to the United States (Rafu Shimpo, March 22, 1947). See Were We The Enemy? by Rinjiro Sodei for further information. See here for number of resident aliens of Japanese descent as of June 1942. Forthcoming book by John J. Stephan will cover this subject in detail. For further info and extensive data on ethnic Japanese and Japanese Americans in the US prior to and during WWII, see my EO9066 website, The Preservation of a People, dealing with the evacuation and relocation of people of Japanese ancestry (assembly and relocation centers, internment camps, etc.).\n\nFrom Were we the enemy? American survivors of Hiroshima by Rinjiro Sodei (1998):\n\nThe Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimated that the number of Nisei from both the U.S. mainland and Hawaii who were living in Japan for family reasons or for education reached almost 30,000 as of January 1929. Of these, 4,805, or sixteen percent, were living in Hiroshima Prefecture. Their ages ranged from one to thirty, but 3,803, or some eighty percent, were attending elementary and middle schools. According to the same statistics, 11,312 Nisei in the United States, excluding Hawaii, had parents who came from Hiroshima, while Nisei residing in Hiroshima numbered 3,404. When 2,759 of the latter group were asked in 1929 whether they wanted to go back to the United States, only 755 answered yes, while 2,004 said no. In other words, seventy percent expressed no desire to return.\n\nAfter the 1924 revision of the Immigration Act prohibited Japanese from immigrating, only Nisei possessed the right to enter the country without restriction. A book published in 1929 about Hiroshima immigrants in the United States emphasized, \"From the viewpoint of the development of the Yamato race overseas ... some measures must be urgently taken to encourage the Nisei in Japan to come back to the U.S.\"\n\nThe foreign ministry survey was made that same year, twelve years before Pearl Harbor. In the intervening years, how many Nisei returned to the United States? A history of the Japanese in America, published in December 1940 by the Association of Japanese Americans in San Francisco, states: \"As a result of a nationwide movement that was started around 1935 to encourage Nisei educated in Japan to return to the United States as the only real successors to the Issei, it is estimated that about ten thousand Nisei have returned at the present time.\" This statement is qualified, however, by the observation that \"around twenty thousand Nisei are believed to still be in Japan.\"\n\nHow many of the latter were living in Hiroshima in 1940? No statistics are available, but if we assume that the sixteen percent of the total that prevailed in 1929 remained consistent, we get an estimate of around 3,200 for the number of Nisei in Hiroshima. Most of these would have been living in and near the city of Hiroshima itself.\n\nThe US Consulate estimated there were 15,000 Nisei residing in Japan at the end of the war, and 10,000 of those were eligible to return to the US. In May 1946, the GHQ ordered the J-Govt. to produce a list of all Nisei who lived in Japan during the war, including those who served in the J-military or in J-govt. Sodei says approx. 5,000 Nisei returned to the US after the war.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\nWhat made the difference between pro-Japan and pro-US Nisei? It could have been the home environment, where the parents were always talking about their motherland, reading news and literature from or about the motherland, with very little Americanism being absorbed in their lives, except perhaps through the American schooling their children were receiving. These Nisei children would then be receiving mostly news and views from a Japanese perspective via their parents as well as from the Japanese language schools (if they were attending) which were teaching not only the language but also the culture and ethics of Imperial Japan, all so that they would not forget their heritage. Compounding this with the fact that many of the Nisei had dual citizenship, it is no wonder, then, that there would be Nisei with a strong attachment to Japan, or at least ambivalence. This could be one of the reasons many in the US military were concerned about the Nisei's loyalties.\n\nFurther data:\n\nUp to 7,000 Nisei in Japanese military -- excerpts (PDF) from Michelle Malkin's book, In Defense of Internment.\n\n18,000 Nisei in Japan in 1933, per Horne book.\n\nFrom a very enlightening work, The Pacific Era Has Arrived: Transnational Education among Japanese Americans, 1932-1941 (PDF), by Eiichiro Azuma:\n\nThe precise number of Nisei students in Japan during the 1930s is difficult to estimate. According to some contemporary sources, there were 40,000 to 50,000 American-born Japanese in the island country in any given year during the decade. The vast majority of them, however, probably resided in Japan permanently with their parents, who had returned home for good. Only about 18,000 Nisei were considered \"Americans\" by the Japanese police, who had kept a close eye on any \"foreign\" elements. Still, most of them had spent a substantial amount of time in Japan, receiving much of their formal education there rather than in the United States. In 1940, a survey of Nisei students over eighteen estimated the presence of 1,500 in the Tokyo area. This is probably the most reliable ballpark figure for the Nisei youngsters who are the subjects of this study. See Nisei Survey Committee, The Nisei: A Survey of Their Educational, Vocational, and Social Problems (Tokyo: Keisen Girls' School, 1939), 2; and Yuji Ichioka, Beyond National Boundaries: The Complexity of Japanese-American History, Amerasia Joumal 23 (Winter 1998), viii.

Mention is made of 4,500 Nisei who were granted Japanese citizenship (possible correlation with number of renunciants at the relocation centers, viz. Tule Lake). Note also that Japanese nationality was NOT a pre-requisite; some even were advised not to acquire Japanese citizenship.\n\nFor more information on the Kibei, see this WRA article, Japanese Americans educated in Japan: The Kibei.\n\nTransnationalism in education: the backgrounds, motives, and experiences of Nisei students in Japan before World War 2 by Yuko Konno\n\nBeyond Two Homelands Migration and Transnationalism of Japanese Americans in the Pacific, 1930-1955 - Enlightening paper by Michael Jin (2013) on the \"50,000 American migrants of Japanese ancestry (Nisei) who traversed across national and colonial borders in the Pacific before, during, and after World War II.

After the death of his wife, Ichiro—father of the Akune boys—took his nine children to settle in his hometown in Kagoshima Prefecture. Later, before WW II, Harry and Ken were sent to California to work and send remittances to their family.\n\nFollowing Japan’s attack of Pearl Harbor, Harry and Ken Akune were among the 118,000 persons of Japanese ancestry who were placed in internment camps against their will. “Then, one day an Army recruiter came with news that the government now wanted young men from the internment camps to join the military. I didn't care what the government had done to us,\" Ken Akune said.\n\n\"When they came around, it was a chance for me to do what Americans were supposed to do, go out and serve their country. When they opened their door, for me, I felt like my rights were given back to me. I also thought about if I met my brother out in the field, what would I do?\" Ken Akune said. \"You don't want to kill him, but if he points his rifle at you, what can you do?\"\n\nKen and Harry graduated from the MIS Language School in 1942 and were deployed to the Asia Pacific war zone, Ken to Burma to work for the Office of War Information to conduct propaganda against Japan. Harry was sent to New Guinea and the Philippines to interrogate Japanese prisoners and to translate documents. Harry, who had not made a parachute jump before, joined his colleagues of the 503rd Paratroopers to jump onto Corregidor island. Their brothers in the Japanese Navy, Saburo was a spotter of American targets for the kamikaze pilots and Shiro, just 15, served in the training program for recruits at the Sasebo Naval Base.\n\nAfter the war, Harry and Ken, while serving in the demobilization of Japanese armed forces, visited their family in Kagoshima Prefecture. The four brothers, two on each side, got into a heated argument as to which side, Japan or America, was right. The confrontation was stopped by their father, who reminded them the war was over.\n\nSaburo and Shiro returned to live in America, where, ironically, Shiro was drafted and fought in the Korean War.\n\nKaji Domoto\n\nFrom Foo Fujita's book:\n\nFrom Kaji Domoto - Nisei at Omori camp - US News Hiroshima.html:\n\n\"The news came much quicker to Sgt. Frank Fujita, a Japanese-American held eight blocks from the Imperial Palace in Tokyo. Kaji Domoto, a U.S.-born Japanese who liked to serve up anti-American diatribes, told the assembled POWs that the \"murderers\" had destroyed an entire city with one bomb. The GIs scoffed. Domoto was notorious for fanciful tales, including one about a U.S. plane downed by a rice ball. He convinced them this time by producing Western dispatches on Truman's announcement.\"\n\nDomoto at Bunka camp with Cousens 1946-09-27.pdf - Sydney Morning Herald article: \"Cousens said Domoto had been instrumental in saving the lives of three officers.\"\n\nFujimoto\n\nSee Otten testimony, Nagoya POW Camp #10: \"Civilian Interpreter Fujimoto (Thug) strafed [punished] POW's, was American born and educated.\" He was at the Osaka Chikko POW Camp first, according to this site.\n\nMeiji Fujisawa\n\nOeyama POW camp interpreter (From Bamboo People by Chuman):\n\nLengthy chapter here about Kawakita (Chapter Four) in which Fujisawa (Fujizawa) is mentioned, Kawakita's childhood friend:\n\nAmerica's Geisha Ally by Naoko Shibusawa, 2006\n\nYasukuni \"Frank\" Fukami\n\nPer Statement of Sachio Egawa (from bottom of page 26) of Fukuoka POW Camp #18 (Sasebo):\n\n\"About March or April [1943]... a seamen name FUKAMI, Yasukuni came to our camp.

Harry Fukuhara left his native Seattle as a teen when his mother took him and his siblings to her hometown of Hiroshima following his father’s death in 1933. He returned to the United States for college; his three brothers remained in Japan. He served in the US Army; they served in the Japanese Army. His mother and oldest brother suffered radiation sickness, with his brother dying before the end of 1945. “‘Futatsu no sokoku’ hazama ni ikite” [Living Between ‘Two Fatherlands,’], Tokyo Shimbun, 11 June 1996, p. 28.\n\nFrom Nisei Linguists review:\n\nToshikawa Takao, “Nikkei nisei, Beigun joho shoko ga hajimete shogen shita: ‘Futatsu no sokoku’ rimenshi,” [“Nisei, U.S. Military Officer Testifies for First Time: The Inside Story of ‘Two Fatherlands’”], Shukan Posuto, 3 March 1995: 219. Many Japanese histories, memoirs, and media reports tell the stories of Nisei in service to one country or the other. One history of Japanese Americans is Kikuchi Yuki’s Hawai Nikkei nisei no Taieheiyo Senso [The Pacific War of Hawaiian Nisei] (Tokyo: Sanichi Shobo, 1995). A story of Japanese Americans on the other side is Tachibana Yuzuru’s Teikoku Kaigun shikan ni natta Nikkei Nisei [The Nisei Who Became an Officer of the Imperial Navy] (Tokyo: Tsukiji Shokan, 1994). As Nisei who were living in the United States at the start of the war joined the US military and intelligence organs, so many of those in Japan at that time served as linguists in the IJA and IJN, the Foreign Ministry, and the official Domei News Agency which, like the BBC, monitored foreign media broadcasts.\n\n--------------------\n\nU.S. Officer Feared Worst For Family Living in Japan / Brothers split by war and circumstance\n\nBy Tara Shioya, Chronicle Staff Writer\n\nIn the summer of 1945, U.S. Army Lieutenant Harry Fukuhara was assigned to the Philippine island of Luzon as a linguist with the 33rd Infantry Division. The end of the war was near, and Allied forces were preparing to invade Japan. Fukuhara's unit would head the invasion.\n\nAnd for the first time since he joined the Army, Fukuhara thought of what that could mean for his family in Japan.\n\nBefore the war, his mother and his three brothers had returned to Hiroshima from the United States, where Fukuhara was born. He had not heard from them in four years, since the war broke out. When the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, on August 6, Fukuhara assumed the worst. There were no survivors, he was told. In Hiroshima, nothing would live for the next 100 years. Still, he knew he had to go see for himself.\n\nHe was not expecting what he found.\n\n\"I thought I should go to Japan and at least see if I could find them,\" recalls Fukuhara, now 75, a retired Army colonel who lives in San Jose. \"But I figured there was no chance that they would have survived.\"\n\nHe arrived in Japan a month later, having been reassigned to the American occupation forces in Kobe. With the Army's permission, he and a driver set out for Hiroshima in a jeep one morning before dawn.\n\nThey drove all day and night, using train trestles to cross rivers where bridges had been destroyed. The next morning they reached Takasu-machi, the Hiroshima suburb where Fukuhara's family lived. The houses appeared to be intact, but on the streets there were no people. Through the neighborhood, the usual early- morning murmur of waking families, children's squeals, chickens in the back yard -- the sounds of life -- were not to be heard.\n\nThe Fukuhara home was among those standing. A row of shrubs had been charred, their silhouettes superimposed on the back wall of the house, which faced the center of the city. Inside the two-story house, daggers of glass jutted from the walls -- the windows and doors were gone. Fukuhara stood in the hallway and called out \"moshi moshi\" (\"hello, hello\"). But there was no reply.\n\nAs he surveyed the damage, his mother appeared.\n\n\"I was pretty surprised,\" remembers Fukuhara, a quiet man who seems to yield to his emotions only reluctantly. \"We just stood there looking at each other.\"\n\nHis mother and her sister had survived the bomb by hiding in an underground shelter. At the time of the blast, his mother was rinsing her feet outside the house. Her oldest son, Victor, 32, had been less fortunate. When the bomb hit, he was on his way to work at a factory in Hiroshima. The radiation had left him scarcely able to talk or eat. The day after the bomb, relatives had found him wandering through town, dazed and with his shirt burned to rags, and had brought him home.\n\nAt first, Fukuhara's mother did not recognize her American son. His complexion had turned sallow from medication he was taking for malaria. She had not seen him since 1938 and was confused by the U.S. Army uniform.\n\nAfter her husband's death in 1933, Kinu Fukuhara had left Washington state -- the family's home for more than 20 years -- and returned to her hometown of Hiroshima with four of her children. But Harry had come back to the United States soon after graduating from high school and had gone to California, following a sister. In the intervening years, the family wrote letters. But then, after Pearl Harbor, the letters stopped.\n\nNow, from his mother and aunt, he learned that his other two brothers had also survived. They had not been in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing but on the southern island of Kyushu, preparing for what was expected to be imminent invasion by American troops.\n\nFukuhara learned several months later that while he was studying aerial attack-plan photographs of the island, his youngest brother, Frank, was digging foxholes for the Japanese army in the Kyushu mountains in expectation of the U.S. landing.\n\n\"That was pretty ironic,\" said Frank Fukuhara, from his home in Komaki, Japan. \"We could have met up face to face, fighting against each other.\"\n\nNow 71, he laughs as he recalls his army training -- learning to crawl on his stomach with a dummy bomb strapped to his back, to slip beneath the American tanks.\n\nDuring most of the war, he says, he had avoided military service by enrolling in an engineering college. Eventually he was drafted, in April 1945, and was assigned to the Western Second Battalion Infantry and sent to Kyushu, like the fourth brother, Pierce.\n\nBy the time Harry returned to Japan, Frank and Pierce had gone back to Hiroshima to work as interpreters for U.S. forces just outside the city.\n\n\"When Harry showed up, I was really shocked,\" said Frank Fukuhara. \"I thought that he was a prisoner of war, and that he had been sent back to Japan.\"\n\nAfter several hours, he understood that his brother was in fact a U.S. Army officer and that the tall, blond soldier who accompanied them on the jeep ride home was not holding Harry prisoner.\n\nThe last Frank had heard, Harry was working as a houseboy in Glendale, Calif. He had heard nothing of the Japanese American evacuation and the internment camps. He had no idea that Harry and their sister, Mary, and her 2- year-old daughter were relocated to a camp at Gila River, Ariz., and that Harry had volunteered to join the Army -- or that circumstance had placed them on opposite sides of the war.\n\nFor Frank, who had always hoped to return to the United States, the choice between \"American\" and \"Japanese\" had been made for him when he was drafted into the Japanese Imperial Army. But for Harry, that decision was a conscious one.\n\n\"I felt I had to make up my mind to stay as an American,\" he says of his decision to volunteer. \"I had no feeling of loyalty to Japan.\"\n\nToday, Harry Fukuhara still spends considerable time thinking about the war, as president of the Northern California Military Intelligence Service (MIS) -- a 400-member association of Japanese Americans who served in the war in the Pacific.\n\nHe says he still believes that dropping the A-bomb shortened the war and ultimately saved lives, despite the price his family paid. His brother Victor died of radiation sickness in 1947. His mother died of similar causes in 1968.\n\nFrank Fukuhara is unable to say whether he believes that use of the bomb was justified, especially when he thinks of their 13-year-old cousin Kimiko. On Aug. 6, 1945, she had just finished her wartime work duties at school and was on the roof of the building when the bomb struck. Blinded by the flash and badly burned, she crawled half a mile to a temporary hospital. Minutes after her mother found her, she died.\n\n\"I thought the atomic bomb was really miserable,\" Frank Fukuhara says, his voice faltering for a moment. \"But it ended the war. It could have lasted much longer.\"\n\nBut the memory of Hiroshima is painful for both brothers.\n\nDespite Harry Fukuhara's apparent pragmatism about the bomb, it was not until 1989 that he returned again to Hiroshima.\n\n\"I guess I wanted to avoid going there,\" he says. \"I didn't even want to think about it. There was nothing positive about the time I was there in 1945.\"\n\nSee also this review of book on Fukuharas, \"Midnight in Broad Daylight,\" by Pamela Rotner Sakamoto. The Japan Times had this article, The unbelievable true story of a Japanese family that went to war with itself.\n\nFrom essay by Fukuhara, Military Occupation of Japan (WWW.NJAVC.ORG):\n\nAbout two weeks after arriving in Japan, I was able to get permission from my division commander to travel by Jeep to Hiroshima to look for my family. I arrived in early October and found my mother and brothers in our partially-damaged family home on the outskirts of Hiroshima City. My mother had survived the atomic bomb because she had been in a bomb shelter, but my older brother Victor had been injured by the bombing. He was to die a few months later from radiation poisoning. Many of my relatives had died or disappeared in the atomic blast.\n\nI was overjoyed to see my two younger brothers, Pierce and Frank. They had been drafted into the Japanese Army, and had returned home just a few days before I arrived in Hiroshima. Frank had been assigned to a suicide unit in Miyazaki Prefecture. He had been training to blow up a U.S. military vehicle by running up to it and detonating an explosive strapped to his back. I shuddered when I heard that he was supposed to guard the beaches of Miyazaki Prefecture on the island of Kyushu. That was where my division had been planning to land on November 1, 1945. I was glad that the atomic bomb had ended the war.\n\n.....When I was first assigned to the Toyama CIC office, in September 1947, I met a young Nisei girl who became my wife two years later. Terry Yamamoto had come to Japan as a teenager before the war. She was working as an interpreter at the Toyama Military Government Team.\n\nJapanese book:\n\n母国と 戦った日系二世\n\n門池啓史, 元就出版社, 発行年月： 2010年02月\n\nAmericans who became soldiers of Japanese military - Nisei who fought against their motherland\n\nFrom Chapter 2:\n\nFrank Fukuhara - brother in US Army 「二つの母国」 (Two Motherlands)\n\nToshiko Funatsu\n\nPer Stephan, possibly worked as a communications monitor for the Imperial Army or Navy.

Local Hawaiians took away the pilot's pistol and his papers, but Harada supplied him with other arms belonging to Harada's employer, after which, for six days, the pilot and Harada terrorized the entire island. Then a Hawaiian who had been shot by the pilot managed to kill him, after which Harada committed suicide. S.

This man had spent at least half of each year in the states for a long period as he was in the export business from Japan. Although being a Japanese subject, he was married to an American Japanese and had several children. Two of his daughters at that time were attending the University of Southern California. All of his family except himself were American citizens. He was one of the vilest, most vicious men in the whole place.

Quoted in this article as saying, \"It was dreadful. But I never felt a sense of anger at the U.S. that they used such a weapon to bring the war to an end. I think that was the right thing to do.\"\n\nNobuaki Warren Iwatake\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nNobuaki \"Warren\" Iwatake (1923-) was Radio Operator and communications intercepter and a veteran of the World War veteran of the World War 2 Imperial Japanese Army.\n\nFamily history\n\nHe was born in Kahului, Hawaii, USA. Warren was the eldest son of six children and was raised in Kahului. The father of Iwatake, a Kobayashi store employee, presumed drowned from a fishing trip at Peahi. With the loss of the family breadwinner, his mother, four brothers, and one sister moved to Hiroshima, Japan, to live with an uncle in November, 1940. Warren stayed on Maui to graduate with his Maui High School class of '41, and then left to rejoin his family in Hiroshima. The December 7, 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor would eventually have a profound effect on Iwatake's family, and lead to an unlikely association with George Herbert Walker Bush, the 41st President of the United States.\n\nService in Imperial Japanese Army\n\nIwatake was beaten and drafted against his will to the Imperial Japanese Army from a Japanese college in 1943. He was present when former United States President George H.W. Bush was shot down over the Pacific in his Avenger bomber, during September 1944, and was later rescued by a submarine. Two American crewman with Bush were killed. Iwatake had missed the battle of Iwo Jima due to an American submarine attack on his ship's convoy, and was then placed on Chichi-jima, 150 miles north of Iwo Jima. American forces bombed Chichi-jima to cut radio communications between islands. Former President George H.W. Bush's task was to bomb the island's communication towers, and possibly any Imperial Japanese forces. Due to the \"island hopping\" strategy by American forces, the island was spared an invasion attack.\n\nIwatake was present when Japanese Imperial forces captured an American pilot from Texas by the name of Warren Earl Vaughn. Mr. Iwatake was assigned to guard and work with Warren Earl Vaughn on Chichi Jima. He and Warren Earl spent many hours talking and developed a personal relationship. According to Iwatake, one evening after a bath, the two were walking back when Iwatake fell into a bomb pit. \"It was pitch black and I couldn't get out. He reached to me and said take his hand\" and Warren Earl pulled Iwatake out. Shortly after the fall of Iwo Jima in March 1945, the pilot was taken away by other Japanese Naval Officers and executed at the harbor by beheading. On that day Mr. Iwatake adopted and kept the name \"Warren\" in honor and remembrance of his American friend Warren Earl Vaughn. The story of Warren Earl Vaughn, Iwatake's observation of the rescue of George H.W. Bush, and the experiences of other American \"Flyboys\" is recounted in the book Flyboys: A True Story of Courage by James Bradley. Warren Iwatake and President George H.W. Bush met on Chichi Jima in 2002 in a symbolic reunion of veterans from both sides of the conflict.\n\nIwatake lost his youngest brother in the Hiroshima atomic bomb attack. The youngest brother was 500 yards from the epicenter attending a school. Reportedly, the only thing left was a US Army canteen, as the youngest brother was vaporized in the atomic attack. Iwatake's uncle, Dr. Hiroshi Iwatake, was badly burned in the atomic explosion, but regained his health and lived into the 1980s. Dr. Hiroshi Iwatake's true story is recounted in the 1966 (1969 Kodansha English translation by John Bester) historical novel \"Black Rain\" by Masuji Ibuse. This title is not to be confused with the 1989 Michael Douglas movie of the same name, also set in Japan. The Ibuse \"Black Rain\", though centered around fictional characters, is based on interviews with actual atom bomb survivors, including Hiroshi Iwatake. Graphic details in the novel, such as the maggots eating away at Hiroshi's earlobe, are true. The nephew in the novel is Warren Iwatake's youngest brother Takashi. The novel states that Takashi's metal ID tag was found. However, Warren's brother Masaru reported that all he could find when he searched for Takashi amongst the ruins of Hiroshima was Takashi's U.S. Army canteen.\n\nAfter the war, Iwatake served as a translator for the American Embassy in Tokyo for 35 years.\n\nAnd this article:\n\nChildress vet 'was a great man'\n\nBy CAPT. NEIL F. MURPHY\n\nMarine Corps Public Affairs Office\n\nCAMP S.D. BUTLER, Okinawa, Japan - On Feb. 23, 1945, on the tiny coral island of Chichi Shima, jutting out of the Bonin Islands east of Okinawa and north of Iwo Jima, anti-aircraft fire ripped through the sky.\n\nA Marine Corps F-4U Corsair fighter, on an air-raid mission from the USS Bennington, lumbered over the island and slammed into the ocean after being shredded by the wall of lead.\n\nSlowly descending in his parachute to the ocean, the pilot, 23-year-old Childress native 2nd Lt Warren Earl Vaughn, watched helplessly as his co-pilot sank silently into the ocean.\n\nHitting the water and swimming through shark-infested coral to the surf, Vaughn was snatched from the shore by defending Japanese soldiers and sailors and dragged into their camp.\n\nVaughn had not been the first to be shot down near this island. Five months before, future President George Bush, a naval aviator aboard the USS San Jacinto, also was shot down in his Avenger aircraft off this dreaded coastline. But Bush was rescued by the submarine USS Finback, narrowly avoiding the fate that awaited Vaughn.\n\nNow a prisoner of war on desolate Chichi Shima, Vaughn was forced to work in a sweltering communications hut high atop Mount Yoake, routinely monitoring his own forces' radio communications along with a young Japanese army private.\n\nPrivate Nobuaki Iwatake, now 76, also was stranded on the island after the freighter ship he and other Japanese soldiers were traveling on months before, the Nissho Maru, was torpedoed miles off the coast.\n\nIwatake, an unwilling Japanese conscript with dual U.S.-Japanese citizenship, was forced to join the Imperial Japanese Army because of his English skills.\n\nHaving attended Maui High School in Hawaii, he was a student at Mejii University in Tokyo when the war broke out. Two years after being drafted, Iwatake found himself on Chichi Shima monitoring U.S. radio transmissions and working with a fellow U.S. citizen who was labeled his enemy.\n\nMeanwhile, the battle for Iwo Jima raged on just south of the island. As Americans and Japanese bled and died at each others' hands on the hot, black sands, Vaughn and Iwatake began to share a friendship that has remained in Iwatake's mind and heart to this day.\n\n\"Warren was a great man,\" Iwatake said. \"Even as a prisoner, he had a sense of humor and often told us jokes and had a good, healthy spirit.\n\n\"I remember him being brought into our camp with his green flight suit on months after I had seen (George) Bush shot down and rescued by the U.S. Navy. Warren wasn't as lucky. Warren was tall and handsome and had a real Texas accent.\n\n\"I always wonder if he had been rescued, what would have become of him and what great things he would have done for his country, like Bush.\n\n\"One night, Warren was talking with some kamikaze pilots who had come into our hut, and they asked what he would do if they got on his tail. Warren stood up, towering over them and using his hands to depict flying aircraft, he explained how he would roll up and loop to get behind them and shoot them down. Impressed by his skill, they shook his hand and wished him luck as they departed.\"\n\nAnother time, while the two were in their hut working, their area was hit by bombs dropped by U.S. P-51 Mustangs that were attacking the island.\n\n\"They had no idea Warren was there, and he was very upset that they dropped bombs on him. He ran out and yelled at them as they flew past, shaking his hands and cursing,\" Iwatake said.\n\nLate one evening, Iwatake even smuggled Vaughn into a Japanese-style bathhouse on the island, so he could clean himself up. On the way to the facility, the nearsighted Iwatake fell into a bomb crater, which offered Vaughn a chance to escape. Instead, Vaughn reached down into the six-foot pit and helped his friend out to safety.\n\n\"That's the way he was,\" Iwatake said.\n\nWhile monitoring the nightly radio transmissions from Iwo Jima, Vaughn and Iwatake continued to trade stories of their lives and what they would do once the war ended. The two even had begun to plan an escape from the island, but as fate would have it, time ran out.\n\nOne morning in early March, Vaughn intercepted a message that stated, \"All organized Japanese resistance has ended. The U.S. Marines have taken Iwo Jima.\"\n\nHe hesitantly passed the transmission to Iwatake, who translated it and forwarded it to his chain of command.\n\nThe morning after learning of the fall of Iwo Jima and the impending Japanese defeat, an irate Japanese Imperial Navy officer-in-charge of the communications unit on Mount Yoake, Capt. Yoshii, came into the hut. He removed Vaughn from his work area and collected seven other prisoners of war who also were shot down over the island.\n\nIwatake said Vaughn looked at him and replied, ' \"They're taking me away. Goodbye and take care, my friend.' \"\n\nVaughn was led down the mountain.\n\n\"I will never forget that sad look on his face as he left,\" Iwatake said.\n\nThat afternoon, in a horrific display of inhumanity, Yoshii and some of his men bayoneted and beheaded the prisoners by the seashore.\n\nMonths later, according to \"The History of Marine Corps Aviation,\" Yoshii and many others were tried and hanged in Saipan for war crimes against Vaughn and the others.\n\n\"I found out the day after it happened. I was shocked, shaken and deeply saddened. They had killed my friend, Warren, and for what, I couldn't understand why,\" Iwatake said. \"I hated Yoshii for that.\"\n\nMore than half a century later, the friendship that ended in such dismay still lives today in the mind of that unwilling Japanese conscript. Iwatake is still searching for final closure to the events leading up to Vaughn's death.\n\nRecently, Iwatake expressed his desire to meet any of Vaughn's remaining family members to help heal the wounds and share the memories of his last days alive.\n\n\"Some of the men who witnessed the execution said he was very brave, and that was just like him. I want people to remember Warren,\" Iwatake said. \"After the war, I changed my given name (to Warren) in remembrance of my friend. He lives in my memory forever.\n\n\"I vowed that if I ever survived that war, Warren Iwatake would do something to contribute to U.S.-Japan relations in some way.\"\n\nIwatake recently retired after 25 years of working in the press section of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. While there, he often searched for Vaughn's family, and every time it produced nothing.\n\n\"Time is running out, and I want to see his family so bad,\" Iwatake said.\n\nVaughn is currently listed as a POW, killed in action, as of March 5, 1945, and his body never was recovered from the island.\n\nHis last known listed relative was his mother, Evia McDonald, from Childress.\n\nBorn in Childress on Sept. 20, 1922, Vaughn enlisted in the Marine Corps on Sept. 1, 1943, in Corpus Christi, said R.V. Aquilina, Headquarters Marine Corps History and Museums Division, who located some of Vaughn's information in Marine files.\n\n\"It's been a long time, but I remember Warren told me he was going back home to get married and teach. He had graduated from Southwest Texas Teachers College (now Southwest Texas University) and was looking forward to getting home,\" Iwatake said. \"I can still see his face when I close my eyes, and it seems like yesterday. I'll never forget Warren for as long as I live.\"\n\nAnother article:\n\nhttp://www.perkins-smart.com/burmacampaignsociety/archive/news_pdf/Newsletter%2014%20a.pdf\n\nThe Burma Campaign Society NEWSLETTER\n\nSeptember 2009\n\nWARREN IWATAKE’S WAR.\n\nGeorge Bush Sr. who later became US President made his first parachute jump on Chichi Jima during the Pacific\n\nWar when his plane was shot down. I saw his rescue and was happy to learn that he was picked up by the submarine\n\nFinback. I am also grateful to the captain of the US submarine that sank our troopship, because if we had not lost\n\nour artillery and ammunition, we would have gone on from Chichi Jima to Iwo Jima. Our anti-tank platoon, with\n\nwhich we had trained in Hiroshima, was one convoy ahead of us and reached Chichi Jima safely, where we met\n\nthem. But it was not so lucky. A week later, they were sent on to Iwo Jima, only a hundred and fifty miles away,\n\nand were all killed. Such is fate.\n\nI had had dual American and Japanese citizenship and had been told by my high school teacher never to join the\n\nJapanese Army or I would not be able to return to Hawaii. However, I was attending university in Tokyo in 1943\n\nwhen the military government ordered all university students to be drafted into the army. Although they were\n\nexempt from military service, the war was being lost and a hundred thousand students were drafted, and many\n\nnever returned.\n\nI myself did three months basic training in Hiroshima, and life in the Japanese Imperial Army was a nightmare.\n\nWe recruits were constantly reminded that we were fighting for the Emperor, who was at that time considered to\n\nbe a God, and the army tried to pound it into our heads that we should be willing to sacrifice our lives for him and\n\nfor the country. Life was really tough, as we were beaten by our superiors, and when we were liined up at night\n\nfor roll call and our kit was inspected, our faces would be violently slapped if there was one speck of dust on our\n\nboots.. The beatings were routine and since, in my case, my English was better than my Japanese, I was singled\n\nout several times because of my enemy background. Since we were in the artillery, we trained with cannons which\n\nwere hauled by manpower. However, things improved after basic training, as attention was then focused on the\n\nnext batch of recruits and we were no longer beaten. After the war some soldiers called their basic training hell.\n\nI took the name of Pilot Warren Vaughn to honour his memory, as I became friends with him until he was executed.\n\nDespite being a POW, he managed to smile and tell us jokes. I had been ordered to join a naval radio facility to\n\nmonitor enemy communications and Warren Vaughn was forced to work with us for a while, and it was he who\n\ncaught a message from US Army Headquarters announcing that “all organized resistance on Iwo Jima has ended.”\n\nOne day, a member of our army unit passed by and asked me how the war was going, and when I told him that\n\nI knew, because of the monitoring, that Japan was losing, he called me a traitor. The Japanese soldiers did not\n\nknow that it was being lost, because the High Command in Tokyo kept announcing victory after victory for the\n\nJapanese Imperial Army, and during the Battle of Midway, which turned the tide of the war, and in which Japan\n\nlost three of its top aircraft carriers, Japan announced that it had won a major victory, sinking several US carriers.\n\nAfter the war, when the President learned that I had taken Warren Vaughn’s first name, he called me “a true friend\n\nof America”, and when, in 2004, I was able to visit Childress. Vaughn’s home town in Texas, with a population\n\nof ten thousand, I received a warm welcome and was made an Honorary Citizen.\n\nAs to the war, my opinion is that wars may be necessary to protect the democratic way of life and get rid of\n\ndictators, but we must remember that war is a matter of kill or be killed. I lost my brother, who was only thirteen\n\nwhen he was killed in his classroom in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and as a result of my experience, I am\n\nopposed to war.\n\nWarren Iwatake\n\nEditor’s note\n\nThe above Article is drawn from two Emails which were sent to Akiko Macdonald.\n\nAnd another one:\n\n1 family's tradition: Tree that saw war, survived A-bomb goes up for 70th Christmas\n\nTOKYO: Warren Nobuaki Iwatake's family has seen more than its share of calamity.\n\nWhen he was still a child his father was lost at sea off Hawaii. With no breadwinner, his family was forced to move to Japan, where Iwatake was drafted during the war. He lost a brother when the bomb fell on Hiroshima.\n\nBut through it all one thing has remained constant.\n\nThe tree.\n\nHis parents bought it in 1937, and his family has brought it out every Christmas since, without fail, even when that meant risking arrest.\n\n\"This tree was a shining light, because it was a symbol of unity in my family,\" Iwatake said as he and his wife put the final touches on the frail, 1-meter-tall (3-foot-tall) heirloom that is, once again this year, the centerpiece of their small, neatly kept apartment in Tokyo.\n\n\"We have put this tree up every year for 70 years.\"\n\n___\n\nThough he considers himself Buddhist, Iwatake was raised in a Christian tradition. He still keeps a photo of the tiny wooden church on Maui where he and his five brothers went to services and Sunday school.\n\nChristmas was always a special time.\n\nHis father worked at a merchandise store, and Iwatake remembers the day he came home with a tree. It was nothing all that special, just metal-and-plastic, the kind of decoration that can easily be placed on a table, or in a corner somewhere. He got a string of lights, too, the kind with the big bulbs.\n\nSoon after, his father died in a fishing accident. His body was never found.\n\nIwatake's mother had relatives in Japan, and took Iwatake's younger brothers there. Iwatake stayed behind to graduate from high school, then, in 1941, six months before Pearl Harbor, he moved to Japan as well.\n\n\"Things were pretty bad,\" he said. \"There were war clouds hanging everywhere.\"\n\nThe United States and Britain were the enemy, and Japan clamped down on overt displays of anything Western, including Christianity. Though they had grown up speaking English, Iwatake and his brothers communicated solely in Japanese, and did their best to hide their past.\n\nBut their mother refused to give up on the tree.\n\n\"She was in charge and she wanted to put it up,\" Iwatake said. \"During the war years, we had to do that in secret because in wartime Japan it was not welcome. We could have been arrested.\"\n\nTo keep the neighbors from asking questions, his mother found a place for it in the back of their house, on the second floor, away from the windows.\n\n\"We were afraid they would report it to the police, or become suspicious about why we were harboring Western things,\" he said. \"But we were brought up in the American way of life. It is something that you cannot forget. It really is something from the heart.\"\n\nThe year after that first Christmas in Hiroshima, Iwatake went to Tokyo to study economics at university. At Christmas, he directed a school play, a nativity story, again keeping it secret so that the authorities wouldn't get involved.\n\nThen, in 1943, he was drafted and sent to Chichijima.\n\n___\n\nChichijima is a tiny island that virtually no one has heard of. To get there, you go out to the middle of nowhere, and turn south.\n\nIn 1944, Iwatake boarded a transport ship from Yokohama to assume his duties at a radio monitoring post on the remote crag. The ship was torpedoed and sunk by an American submarine, but he survived and was put on an oil tanker.\n\nOn the island, Iwatake's English skills were put to use listening in on U.S. military communications, and keeping watch over a handful of captured American pilots whose planes had been shot down on their way to and from bombing raids on Tokyo.\n\nOne day, he was in the hills digging bunkers when he heard that a plane had just been shot down. He saw a lone pilot on a bright yellow life raft paddling furiously away from the island. American planes provided cover, and the submarine USS Finback surfaced and collected him.\n\nThe aviator was 20-year-old George H. W. Bush, who would later become the American president. Iwatake met him years later and went back with him to the island. Signed photos of the two, smiling, are placed prominently about Iwatake's apartment.\n\nBut another American left a deeper impression on Iwatake's life.\n\nCaptured POWs were forced to monitor U.S. radio traffic. One of them was Warren Vaughn, a Texan.\n\n\"One night after a bath we were walking back and I fell into a bomb pit,\" Iwatake said. \"It was pitch black and I couldn't get out. He reached to me and said to take his hand. He pulled me out.\"\n\nVaughn was monitoring the day Iwo Jima fell. Japan's defeat was virtually assured. Soon after, several naval officers called Vaughn and took him to the beach. \"He turned before he left and gave me a sad look,\" Iwatake said.\n\nFor no apparent reason, Vaughn was beheaded, and his body dumped into the sea.\n\nThe atrocities committed against the POWs — which included acts of cannibalism — remained largely a secret for the next 50 years. But Iwatake said he did not want Vaughn's memory to die.\n\n\"I thought the best way of remembering him was to adopt his first name,\" Iwatake said.\n\n___\n\nJapan surrendered in August 1945, and Iwatake returned home in December.\n\n\"I used to think of those joyous days in Hawaii at Christmas, when we had food and treats,\" he said. \"On Chichijima, we were starving.\"\n\nBut Hiroshima was even worse.\n\n\"Everything was bad, nothing was left,\" he said. \"I couldn't even think of the joys of what I experienced in Hawaii.\"\n\nIwatake's younger brother Takashi had been in the center of the city attending school. His body, like their father's, was never found.\n\nThe Iwatake home was in the eastern part of the city, behind a small hill that provided a buffer from the blast. The front end was crushed and burned, but the back stood largely intact.\n\nAnd that was where the tree was.\n\n\"Japan had surrendered, there was no food, nothing to celebrate,\" he said. \"Everybody was in shock and a sad state, but we put it up. My mother put it up.\"\n\nAfter the war, Iwatake became an interpreter for the U.S. government. He moved to Tokyo, and from 1950 he took responsibility for the family tree.\n\nAt first, putting it up was more of a simple tradition than anything else.\n\nHis family was once again spreading out. At one stage, four brothers worked for the Occupation Forces as interpreters and translators, including Iwatake. He eventually went back to Tokyo, while his brothers returned to Hawaii. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, three brothers volunteered, and one served in Korea.\n\nThe Iwatake family remains scattered.\n\nOne brother lives in Chicago, another on Maui. Another died of cancer, possibly the result of radiation from the atomic bomb.\n\nBut each year, the tree has gone up. For those not in Tokyo to see it, including Vaughn's cousins in Childress, Texas, Iwatake, now 84, sends photos. And each year, it becomes more poignant.\n\n\"Gradually, Christmas has become more meaningful again,\" he said. \"Peace, good will toward your fellow man, you know? After the war, there was no such thing.\"\n\nFumitane Jibutsu\n\nMentioned by Patrick Aki (half Nisei, half Chinese-Hawaiian; interview):\n\nhttps://www.thegardenisland.com/2014/07/04/hawaii-news/love-thy-neighbor/\n\nAki and his brother befriended a boy from Japan, named Fumitani Jibutsu, who had just moved into their Kauai neighborhood, an immigrant child who was shunned by everybody else, except them. It was a welcoming gesture for Jibutsu, whose parents were Shinto priests and spoke no English. Jibutsu also struggled with the language, making finding friends almost impossible. “No one wanted to be his friend because he could not speak English, so my brother and I befriended him because we were taught to love thy neighbor,” Michelle wrote about Aki’s memories. Little did Uncle Pat know then, but Jibutsu would return to Japan and become a soldier for her army.\n\n.....\n\nWeeks later, the Japanese overtook Wake Island and Aki became a prisoner of war. Only 450 of the 550 laborers would be taken to POW camps in Japan, however. The Japanese soldiers executed the others, and Aki was singled out to be put to death. “They had us kneeling on the ground, with our heads hanging, each man would look up into the barrel of the gun to meet his fate as an officer would stand directly in front of him to help deliver his destiny,” Michelle wrote about Aki’s fate. “When it came to my turn, I raised my head so that I could see my executioner and to my amazement, the man that held the gun was Fumitani Jibutsu. He lowered the gun and just stared at me and before I knew it, I was taken to Japan as a prisoner.”\n\nPer John Stephan:\n\nJibutsu Fumitane was, contrary to Patrick Aki's testimony, born not in Japan but in Lihue, Island of Kauai on 15 Jan. 1922, was taken by his mother in 1923 to sojourn with his maternal grandfather in Kano-mura, Tsuno-gun, Yamaguchi-ken, returned to Hawaii in 1925, attended the Wailua School, where in 1929 he was elected \"junior cop.\" Upon the death of his father, Ginichi Jibutsu (both of his parents were Shinto priests, Ginichi doubled as a Buddhist priest), Fumitane departed with his widowed mother, Atsuko Miyamoto Jibutsu, for Japan on 24 July 1930 (in April, he and his mother were living in Wailua according to the 1930 US Census). He would have likely completed primary school, presumably in Kano-mura, Yamaguchi-ken, around 1937, possiblly entered Middle School, and was conscripted or volunteered for the IJA (or IJN) in 1941. I could find no record of either Atsuko Jibutsu or her son Fumitane returning to Hawaii after the war.\n\nMasaji Kameoka\n\nNisei? interpreter at POW camp, Nagoya #2 Narumi:\n\nHiroto Kanai\n\nInterpreter for the Kempeitai in Hiroshima; photo here.

Bruce, a survivor of Corregidor, the Bataan death march and three years in a Japanese prisoner of war camp, couldn't believe his eyes as he shopped with his bride one autumn day in 1946 at the Sears department store in Boyle Heights.\n\nStanding a few aisles away amid the crush of shoppers in that quintessentially American setting was the man responsible for brutalizing Bruce and scores of other GIs held captive in Japan's Oeyama prison camp on Honshu Island.\n\nTomoya Kawakita, who held dual citizenship in the U.S. and Japan, served as an interpreter and self-appointed taskmaster at the camp, earning the nickname \"Efficiency Expert\" for his methods of inflicting pain on inmates weakened by malnourishment and forced labor.\n\n\"I was so dumbfounded, I just halted in my tracks and stared at him as he hurried by,\" Bruce, then 24 and attending college under the GI Bill, said shortly after the encounter.\n\n\"It was a good thing, too,\" said the former artilleryman. \"If I'd reacted then, I'm not sure but that I might have taken the law into my own hands--and probably Kawakita's neck.\"\n\nInstead, Bruce followed him outside the store, jotted down the license plate number of his car and notified the FBI.\n\nKawakita, who had returned to the United States after the war and enrolled at USC, was tried and convicted of treason in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and sentenced to death.\n\nThe sentence was never carried out. In 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, responding to appeals from the Japanese government, commuted Kawakita's death sentence to life in prison. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy ordered him freed after 16 years behind bars on the condition that he be deported to Japan and never return.\n\nNow more than half a century since his trial, Kawakita holds the distinction of being the last person prosecuted for treason against the United States.\n\nHe was represented at his federal court trial by Morris Lavine, a colorful Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer, who was fond of describing himself as \"attorney for the damned.\" Lavine's clients ranged from the indigent, whom he represented at no charge, to the likes of mobsters Mickey Cohen and Johnny Roselli, and Teamsters boss James Hoffa.\n\nHeading the prosecution team was U.S. Atty. James M. Carter, who went on to become a federal appeals court judge.\n\nMore than a dozen former POWs testified against Kawakita. They described how he forced prisoners to beat one another, and then beat those he thought didn't hit the other prisoners hard enough. They accused him of forcing prisoners to run laps until they collapsed in exhaustion simply because they had finished their work assignments early.\n\nThe camp was set up next to a nickel ore mine and processing plant, where most of about 400 American POWs were forced to work. Kawakita was employed by the mining company.\n\nOnce, he forced a prisoner to carry a heavy log up an icy slope. The prisoner fell and suffered a serious spinal injury. Fellow POWs testified that Kawakita waited five hours before summoning help for the injured American.\n\nThey also recalled being taunted by Kawakita with comments such as: \"We will kill all you prisoners right here anyway, whether you win the war or lose it.\"\n\nAnd, \"You guys needn't be interested in when the war will be over, because you won't go back. You will stay here and work. I will go back to the States because I am an American citizen.\"\n\nKawakita's citizenship proved to be a crucial issue during the trial and subsequent court appeals.\n\nBy definition, treason can be committed only by someone owing allegiance to the United States.\n\nBorn in Calexico to Japanese parents, Kawakita held dual citizenship under U.S. and Japanese laws. In 1939, at the age of 18, he went to Japan to attend school. He remained there after the outbreak of war, graduating from Meiji University.\n\nAt the trial, Lavine advanced a novel argument. As a dual U.S. and Japanese citizen, he argued, his client owed exclusive allegiance to the country in which he resided. In this case, Japan. Lavine also contended that Kawakita had effectively renounced his U.S. citizenship by signing a family census register maintained by Japanese authorities.\n\nIn his instructions to jurors, U.S. District Judge William C. Mathes made it clear that if they found that Kawakita genuinely believed he was no longer an American citizen, then they must acquit him of the treason charges.\n\nSequestered during deliberations, the jury struggled mightily to resolve the question--declaring several times that they were hopelessly deadlocked. But ultimately they found Kawakita guilty on eight of 13 overt acts of treason charged by the prosecution.\n\nWhen he appeared for sentencing, Kawakita continued to insist he was innocent. \"As I have been found guilty by the jury, I ask your honor for mercy,\" he said.\n\nBy law, Mathes had leeway to impose a sentence ranging from a minimum of five years in prison to a maximum of death at Alcatraz.\n\nHe chose the latter, saying: \"Reflection leads to the conclusion that the only worthwhile use for the life of a traitor, such as this defendant has proved to be, is to serve as an example to those of weak moral fiber who may hereafter be tempted to commit treason against the United States.\"\n\nToday, most of those involved in the case are either dead or, if alive, could not be located. One exception is William J. Kelleher, then a federal prosecutor and now a senior U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough he did not take part in the trial, Kelleher was assigned to draft the government's response to Kawakita's appeal of his conviction. As a result, he immersed himself in every detail of the case.\n\nIn an interview last week , Kelleher recalled being visited at his office by Bruce and two other former POWs while he was working on his brief for the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n\"Me and the boys had a little meeting last night,\" he said Bruce told him. \"And we want you to know that if he ever gets out, we'll be waiting for him.\"\n\nFortunately, Kelleher said, the appeals court upheld Kawakita's conviction by a 3-0 vote.\n\nIt was a much closer call when the appeal went before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1952. The vote was 4 to 3 to uphold the conviction. Two of the court's nine justices disqualified themselves.\n\nAt the crux of the case was this question: Where does the allegiance of a dual citizen lie when two nations, each claiming his loyalty, go to war?\n\n\"Of course, a person caught in that predicament can resolve the conflict of duty by openly electing one nationality or the other,\" said Justice William O. Douglas, writing for the majority.\n\nKawakita, the court said, chose neither option, trying instead to hedge his bets on the war's outcome while freely performing acts of hostility against the U.S.\n\n\"One who wants that freedom can get it by renouncing his American citizenship,\" Douglas wrote. \"He can not turn it to a fair-weather citizenship, retaining it for possible contingent benefits but meanwhile playing the role of the traitor. An American citizen owes allegiance to the United States wherever he may reside.\"\n\nRelated treason case in the US regarding the three Shitara sisters can be found at: Prosecution of the Shitara Sisters.

Posted on Friday, September 11, 2009.\n\nPublished in the Nichi Bei Times Weekly Sept. 3-9, 2009.\n\nBy KOTA MORIKAWA\n\nNichi Bei Times\n\nJimmy Matsuda, an 82-year-old Japanese American gardener in Sunnyvale, Calif., had never talked about the experience he had as a kamikaze pilot during World War II, until a small plastic figure of a Japanese Zero plane caught his grandson Jonathan’s attention two years ago.\n\nThe then-11-year-old wondered what the item on his grandfather’s desk was. After Jonathan asked his father about the airplane, the elder Matsuda decided to talk about his wartime experience.\n\n“I believed I should talk about my life story,” he said. “Otherwise, our grandchildren will never know what happened.”\n\nBorn in Hood River, Ore., the Nisei (second-generation Japanese American) visited Japan for Christmas vacation in 1938 at the age of 11. While there, he got sick and missed the ship returning to the United States. His whole family decided to stay in Japan for good.\n\nIn April of 1943, after graduating from high school, Matsuda volunteered to enlist in the Imperial Japanese Navy. Back then, Navy pilots were already known to eventually become kamikaze pilots. Yet he had no fear of certain death.\n\n“The war atmosphere seemed overwhelming,” Matsuda said. “Everybody was chanting for the war.”\n\nKamikaze missions are believed to have started during the war in the Philippines in 1944. It was a suicide attack on one of the U.S. aircraft carriers in the Pacific. By the end of the war, more than 14,000 Japanese soldiers lost their lives in the suicide missions. Most of them were pilots, some were human torpedoes, and some were body attacks on tanks.\n\nMatsuda recalled his mother telling him before he left home for the war, “If you die, the skull would go to Yasukuni Shrine so don’t come back alive. Don’t even think about becoming a POW, so that you can survive.”\n\nMatsuda performed well in the training camp. His only obstacle was language. As English was his primary language, he had a hard time adjusting to various dialects that the other soldiers spoke. He was sometimes picked on as a result.\n\nIn August of 1945, the military headquarters ordered Matsuda’s unit to go to Okinawa, which the U.S. military had invaded.\n\n“It was a suicide mission by airplane or running into the tanks with bombs to kill as much as possible,” he recalled.\n\nHowever, Matsuda was ordered to stay at the city of Hakata in Fukuoka Prefecture to translate the U.S. military code. While working as a translator, the war ended. He still doesn’t know what happened to the rest of the Navy.\n\nAfter the war, Matsuda worked for the U.S. military as a translator. When the Korean War broke, he was ordered to go to Korea to fight. He rejected the order by writing to then-U.S. president Harry Truman, saying what he went through as a kamikaze pilot — that he had seen enough dead bodies, and did not want to kill anymore.\n\nDuring the early 1950s Matsuda came back to the United States, settled in California and married. He still works as a Japanese gardener. In the recent years, he has volunteered to talk about his war experience at the Santa Clara Valley Japanese Christian Church in Campbell, where he and his wife go every Sunday.\n\nImpressed by Matsuda’s story, one of his son’s friends decided to film the former kamikaze talking about his experience. It is still in production.\n\nphoto by Kota Morikawa/Nichi Bei Times\n\n*** Matsuda interview transcript to be posted\n\nMatsumotos\n\nTakeshi (Japanese Army), Noboru (Japanese Army), Harue, Kaoru, Shizue.

But both Jack, who’s in Louisiana, and I will try to wipe out that shame by our record in the army. We’re going to shove all that propaganda back down the throats of Tojo and the emperor and their militarists.”\n\nFrom Linda Holmes:\n\nI scanned the indexes of Unjust Enrichment and Guests of the Emperor, double-checking all Japanese names.

According to one local historian, this earthquake \"destroyed many buildings and severely damaged the downtown [Orange County] areas of Santa Ana, Garden Grove, and Anaheim, [and] twelve persons were killed.\" See Pamela Hallan-Gibson, The Golden Promise: An Illustrated History of Orange County (Northridge, Calif.: Windsor Publications, 1986), 205.\n\n2. The late Orange County historian Leo Friis, in Orange County Through Four Centuries (Santa Ana, Calif.: Pioneer Press, 1965), 155, provided a vivid discussion of this incident. Because Friis was Anaheim's city attorney during the World War II years and closely connected with Orange County's civil defense effort, his account of this alleged event merits repetition here.\n\nShortly after midnight on February 25, [1942], American radar posts \"reported an unidentified target about 120 miles west of the city of Los Angeles.\" At 2:27 A.M. it was tracked within three miles of the city and nine minutes later Orange County air raid sirens sounded. Simultaneously, anti-aircraft guns in the Los Angeles Harbor area commenced firing. Residents of much of Orange County could hear the explosion of bursting shells and see the vivid red-orange balls of fire popping from tracer bullets. On the following day Secretary of War [Henry] Stimson announced that \"as many as fifteen aircraft, probably commercial planes,\" caused the air raid alarm. He theorized that they were flown by enemy agents in an effort to discover the locations of anti-aircraft batteries and to demoralize the civilian population. On the other hand, Secretary of the Navy [Frank] Knox dubbed the whole affair \"a false alarm.\"... To this day the \"Battle of Los Angeles\" is a mystery. Supposedly all civilian planes had been grounded since December 7, [1941]. No bombs were dropped and no aircraft shot down although some 1430 shells were fired. It is probable that the range of the defending guns was inadequate.\n\n3. The Meiji era in Japan began on January 3, 1868, with the successful coup d'état against the Tokugawa Shogunate by anti-shogunate forces and the restoration of the emperor to the throne, and ended on July 12, 1912, with the death of the Meiji emperor, Mutsuhito. These years witnessed the transformation of Japan into a Western-style modern state and the emigration of large numbers of Japanese to the Territory of Hawaii and the United States. In the words of Stacey Hirose, in Brian Niiya, ed., Japanese American History: An A-to-Z Reference from 1868 to the Present (New York: Facts on File/Japanese American National Museum, 1993), 230, \"Because most of the issei [immigrant-generation Japanese Americans]... were raised during this period, they brought with them and passed on to their nisei children Meiji ideologies, values, manners and patterns of speech.\" The subsequent Taisho Era, reigned over by Emperor Yoshihito, extended from 1912 until December 25, 1926. During these years, Japan continued along the lines of modernization and Westernization begun in the Meiji period, and followed policies generally congenial to Western powers like the United States. Yoshihito was succeeded as emperor in 1926 by his oldest son Hirohito, who had been appointed prince regent in 1921 when Yoshihito became mentally ill; Hirohito's ascent to the throne officially launched the Showa Era.\n\n4. For the background on and larger context of the Panay Incident, see Michael Montgomery, Imperialist Japan: The Yen to Dominate (London: Christopher Helm, 1987), 394-96, 424, and Edward Behr, Hirohito: Behind the Myth (New York: Villard Books, 1989), 170-71, 244. This incident is covered in many other secondary sources, but the two accounts mentioned here are both recent and succinct.\n\n5. A terse but very useful social-economic-historical account of this island, located in San Pedro Bay some twenty-five miles south of downtown Los Angeles, replete with pertinent bibliographic references, can be found in Niiya, Japanese American History, 327.\n\n6. See ibid., 344, for an in-depth discussion, with suggested sources for further reading, on the three-week period of \"voluntary\" relocation or resettlement that transpired following the U.S. government's announcement on March 2, 1942, that Japanese Americans would be excluded from the West Coast.\n\n7. See ibid., 294-95, for a non-quantitative yet useful discussion (with references) to the resettlement pattern of Japanese Americans during World War II.\n\nOf the some 2,000 people who comprised the Japanese American community in Orange County at the outset of the Evacuation, about 1,500 left the county from Huntington Beach and Anaheim on May 15 and May 17, 1942, for the Poston War Relocation Center in Arizona. This number did not include those Japanese Americans in the San Juan Capistrano area of the county, about 40, who were evacuated from Oceanside in north San Diego County. Then, too, approximately 450 Japanese Americans left Orange County prior to April 30, 1942 (presumably, either as participants in the short-lived \"voluntary relocation\" (see note 6 above) or as part of the population evacuated to one of the nine War Relocation Authority centers established in addition to Poston. See the letter, dated 26 August 1942, from Roy E. Black, Deputy Agricultural Commissioner, Department of Agriculture, Orange County, to Dr. A. E. Leighton, Coordinator, Bureau of Sociological Research, Colorado River War Relocation Project, Poston, Arizona, Folder 52, Box 15, Collection 3830: Japanese-American Relocation Records [JARR], Department of Manuscripts and University Archives-Cornell University Libraries [DMUA-CUL]. This letter is contained in the joint files of Dr. Leighton and Dr. Morris Opler, who served as the community analyst for the War Relocation Authority at the Manzanar center, at Cornell University, where both of these distinguished social scientists taught during the post-World War II years. For an inventory of the holdings in this collection of Evacuation materials, see D. Gesensway, M. Roseman, and G. Solomon, Guide to the Japanese-American Relocation Centers Records, 1935-1953 (Ithaca, N. Y.: Department of Manuscripts and University Archives, Cornell University Libraries, 1981).\n\nThe letter from Black to Leighton cited above is also useful in that it provides statistics as to the total acreage farmed by Japanese Americans in Orange County prior to their evacuation (approximately 10,000-8,825 leased, 1,175 owned), including a crop-by-crop breakdown and quantitative information on poultry and hog breeding activity. The spirit of the time is powerfully conveyed in Black's concluding remark to Leighton: \"You will realize, of course, that considering the fact that the source of this information was largely Japanese, we can not guarantee its accuracy.\"\n\nThe Poston center, officially named the Colorado River Relocation Center, was located in Yuma County, Arizona; seventeen miles south of Yuma on the Colorado Indian Reservation, it consisted of three camps: Poston I, Poston II, and Poston III. Poston I, the largest and most studied of these camps (whose total peak population of 17,814 made it the most populous of the WRA's relocation centers), was opened on May 8, 1942, and closed on September 29, 1949. Poston was under the joint supervision of the Office of Indian Affairs, Department of the Interior, until January 1, 1944, when complete administration was assumed by the WRA. See, Niiya, Japanese American History, 285-86, for a profile of the Poston center and suggestions for further reading as to its history and demography.\n\nAlthough some of the interned population at Poston originating from Orange County lived in the smaller two camps, the overwhelming majority lived in the thirty-six blocks of barracks residences (each housing about 250-300 people) comprising Poston I. According to the late anthropologist Edward H. Spicer, who served as Alexander Leighton's assistant for the Bureau of Sociological Research at Poston before accepting the position of head of the WRA's Community Analysis Section, the ten contiguous Orange County-San Diego County blocks (5, 12, 21, 22, 27, 28, 37, 38, 43, 44) at Poston I should be \"classified together because of the similarity of economic, social, and cultural conditions under which they lived [during the prewar period].\" In addition, two other blocks (6 and 11) contained a substantial number of former Orange County residents. See Edward H. Spicer, \"Statistical Survey: Blocks,\" Folder 63, Box 7, Coll. 3830, DMUA-CUL.\n\nGeorge Fujii resided in Block 28 until spring 1943 when, following his marriage, he moved to Block 27. According to one source, the reason for this move was a lack of vacant living quarters for married couples in Block 28. See, \"Block #28,\" Folder 25, ibid. However, Fujii's change of residence is explained quite differently in another primary document:\n\nNakase revealed today the circumstances under which George Fujii, executive secretary of the Local Council, was kicked out of block 28 recently. It appeared that at the send-off party for the first contingent of volunteers for the combat unit someone who worked in the subsistence departments brought a hunk of meat to celebrate the occasion. Kinjo and two others after the party accused the kitchen of using food which rightfully belonged to block residents. The fellow who brought the meat denied it saying, \"It wasn't any of the stuff in the kitchen.\" They challenged him: \"Then where did you get it?\" He answered: \"That's none of your business.\" They retorted: \"Alright, we will report to Snelson.\" Kinjo and his gang persuaded George Fujii to report the affair to Snelson. When the kitchen crew heard of this they were indignant and called a strike. To settle the matter George Fujii was transferred to block 27.\n\nSee \"Block 28 Politics,\" 20 July 1943, Folder J?, Colorado River Relocation Center [CRRC], Japanese American Evacuation and Resettlement Study [JERS], Bancroft Library-University of California, Berkeley [BL-UCB].

Barnhart, comp., Japanese American Evacuation and Resettlement: Catalog of Material in the General Library (Berkeley, Calif.: University of California General Library Berkeley, 1958).\n\n10. This seven-day general strike in the Poston I camp, extending from November 18-24, 1942, was precipitated by the beating on November 14, 1942, of a Kibei inmate (Kay Nishimura, the former brother-in-law of George Fujii) widely suspected among camp inmates of being an administrative collaborator and FBI informer. It led to the arrest and jailing (without formal charges filed against them) of Fujii and Isamu Uchida, two popular interness. Ultimately, the strike—which never entailed the curtailment of essential services or encompassed the Poston II and Poston III camps—was terminated with key concessions to the strikers, particularly in the area of self-government and Issei political control, and the establishment of improved relations between the camp's administration and imprisoned population. For the most thorough account of the strike and the events leading up to it, see Alexander Leighton, The Governing of Men: General Principles and Recommendations Based on Experience at a Japanese Relocation Camp (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1945). The rich and varied primary materials upon which this study was based derived from the Leighton-headed Bureau of Sociological Research (BSR) at Poston. See fn. 8 above for the bibliographical data pertaining to this invaluable collection's finding aid at Cornell University. Many of these same documents are also available in the Poston materials archived in the Japanese American Evacuation and Resettlement collection at the Bancroft Library at the University of California Berkeley (as cited in fn. 9 above); see, in particular, Folders J 1.12, J 1.811, J 6.16C-D, J 6.18, and J 6.24 (which is a chronological account of the strike prepared by Tamie Tsuchiyama). An influential revisionist assessment of the Poston Strike is found in Gary Y. Okihiro, \"Japanese Resistance in America's Concentration Camps: A Re-evaluation,\" Amerasia Journal 2 (1973): 20-34. See also the trenchant entry on the Poston Strike in Niiya, Japanese American History, 286, and the relevant sections of the following three sources: Paul Bailey, City in the Sun: The Japanese Concentration Camp at Poston, Arizona (Los Angeles: Westernlore Press, 1971); Toshio Yatsushiro, Politics and Cultural Values: The World War II Japanese Relocation Centers and the United States Government (New York: Arno Press, 1978); and Rita Takahashi Cates, \"Comparative Administration and Management of Five War Relocation Authority Camps: America's Incarceration of Persons of Japanese Descent during World War II\" (Ph.D. diss., University of Pittsburgh, 1980).\n\n11. Kay Nishimura lived in the bachelor barracks of Block 14 in the Poston I camp, where he worked as a translator and interpreter for the Issei Information Bureau and served on the Temporary Community Council. Born in 1911 in Seattle, Washington, he lived in Japan for fifteen years, before returning to Seattle in 1927 to complete his high school education. After working as a business manager and interpreter/translator for two Japanese American vernacular newspapers in Seattle and Los Angeles, in 1940 Nishimura became a rice grower in California's Imperial County. In the period between the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Nishimura's evacuation to Poston in May 1942, he served as executive secretary for the Imperial County Citizens Welfare Committee and as an interpreter and translator for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Immigration and Naturalization Service, in El Centro, California. At 10:30 p.m., on November 14, 1942, Nishimura, while asleep in his Block 14 quarters, \"was assaulted by a gang of eight men dressed in Samurai hoods and armed with pieces of pipe.\" See \"Exhibit F: Personnel Record of Kay Nishimura,\" 23 November 1942, Folder?, JERS, BL-UCB. According to Alexander Leighton, Poston's reports officer, Norris James, said that Nishimura \"had been beaten and almost killed,...[had] twenty-six stitches in his head [and] had been semi-conscious all the next day.\" See \"Series #12: Employment,\" Folder 6, Box 10, Coll. 3830, DMUA-CUL. Isamu Uchida, like George Fujii, was a member of Poston I's Judo Club; a popular instructor, Uchida could boast of having some 100 dedicated students and loyal supporters. As with Fujii, also, Uchida resided in Block 28. This block was very homogeneous in that about 90 percent of its nearly 250 people came from the agricultural southern coastal region of California between Los Angeles and San Diego, while twice as many of the residents were Buddhists as against Christians. This block served as the camp's \"city center,\" in which were located the main canteen or stores as well as the police department and the city jail—the focal point for the Poston Strike (which was solidly supported by Block 28 residents). See \"Block #28,\" Folder 32, Box 7, ibid. For contemporary personality studies of Nishimura, Uchida, Fujii, see, respectively, Folders 57, 82, and 13, Box 12, ibid. In order for researchers to gain access to these studies, however, permission must be granted both by the individuals involved (or their heirs) and Alexander Leighton, the former head of Poston's Bureau of Sociological Research.\n\n12. See, for example, the watercolor \"Poston Strike Rally\" by Gene Sogioka depicting the Rising Sun-like flag employed during the November 1942 uprising by Block 35 residents. Because Sogioka was employed by Alexander Leighton's Bureau of Sociological Research, the original watercolor is included within the Poston materials archived at Cornell University, Mapcase drawers 1-7, ibid. A color copy of this painting can be found in Deborah Gesensway and Mindy Roseman, Beyond Words: Images from America's Concentration Camps (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press), 153, and a black-and-white version is reproduced in Arthur A. Hansen's review of the Gesensway and Roseman volume, \"Representations of an Imprisoned Poston Past,\" Journal of Orange County Studies 3/4 (Fall 1989/Spring 1990): 105.\n\n13. Kay Nishimura and George Fujii were both members of the Temporary Community Council (TCC), which was comprised (by WRA fiat) entirely of Nisei and Kibei-Nisei (i.e., American citizens). Issei mockingly designated it the \"Child's Council\" (the average age of its representatives was 31.2 years); for them, it symbolized the creation of an artificial Nisei leadership at the expense of their natural community and cultural predominance. While the abolition of this council and its replacement with one whose membership was open to citizens and non-citizens alike was certainly one of the objectives (and outcomes) of the Poston Strike, the roles played by Nishimura and Fujii on the TCC do not, in fact, seem to have been an \"important\" factor in the strike. See, Edward H. Spicer, \"Political Organization of Poston I\" (25 September 1942), 7-10.\n\nFujii, in point of fact, was released unconditionally on the afternoon of November 20, 1942, because of a lack of evidence. Isamu Uchida, on the other hand, was not set free at this time because the Poston administration felt that it had strong evidence of his guilt. Between Fujii's release and the termination of the strike on November 24, the striking population's chief bone of contention was that Uchida be tried in camp by his peers instead of being prosecuted for attempted murder in Yuma County, Arizona (i.e., outside the camp where, it was argued, no Japanese could get a fair trial). The ultimate disposition of the Uchida case is clarified in a 12 June 1943 teletype sent from Poston's director W. Wade Head to Dillon Myer, the WRA's national director:\n\nRE: ISAMU UCHIDA. HE WAS DELIVERED INTO THE CUSTODY OF THE U.S. MARSHAL IN YUMA BY ME PERSONALLY FOLLOWING THE STRIKE IN POSTON. A HEARING WAS HELD BEFORE THE COMMISSIONER AND UCHIDA WAS RELEASED FOR LACK OF SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. ON HIS RELEASE HE WAS RETURNED TO THIS PROJECT. LATER, HEARINGS WERE HELD HERE BY ME AND THE ENTIRE EVIDENCE ACCUMULATED AGAINST UCHIDA WAS GONE INTO AND FOUND IT WAS NOT SUBSTANTIAL NOR COMPLETE ENOUGH FOR CONVICTION.\n\nSee Folder J 1.14, CRRC, JERS, BL-UCB.\n\n15. In the words of Tamie Tsuchiyama, a University of California, Berkeley, doctoral candidate in Anthropology who served as a field researcher/participant-observer for Alexander Leighton's Bureau of Sociological Research and Dorothy Swaine Thomas's Evacuation and Resettlement Study, \"I signed the petition along with the rest of the people without full knowledge of the situation. In fact, I had to sign it, for fear that not doing so would class me as an undesirable pro-administration individual in the eyes of the block residents.\" See Tamie Tsuchiyama, \"Aftermath of the Strike,\" Folder J 6.18, ibid.\n\n16. That the arrest and jailing of Fujii and Uchida were but the visible outward manifestation of the underlying grievances and dissatisfactions of the Poston I population is a point that is made pervasively in the relevant primary documents on the Poston Strike. On the other hand, Fujii's intriguing explanation about the communication gap between Poston's administration and interned population that allegedly was created by Kibei translators and interpreters does not assume saliency in these same sources.\n\npage 103\n\n17. At the time of the Poston Strike, according to Alexander Leighton, in The Governing of Men, 164, Isamu Uchida, like George Fujii, was twenty-seven. Leighton, ibid, drew comparative portraits of the two suspects:\n\nHe [George Fujii] was a Buddhist, single, aged 27, and a Kibei, but he spoke English well and was popular with numerous Niseis, Isseis and members of the Administration as well as other Kibeis. He had completed high school in Japan and had then gone to the University of Southern California for two years to study foreign trade. His family were wealthy and operated a large restaurant in a town in California.\n\nIn appearance, he was small, well-built, and exceedingly neat in dress. His manner was quiet, unobtrusive and friendly and almost all who knew him agreed that he was a very likable person. He took his responsibilities to the community seriously and seemed cooperative and well disposed toward the Administration.\n\nOne of his sisters [Fumi] had been married to and then divorced from the victim of the beating [Kay Nishimura] and there was considerable hostile feeling between the two men.\n\nThe other man [Isamu Uchida] was also a Kibei, single and aged 27, but he spoke very little English and was unknown to the Administration. The son of a farmer in California, he had received in Japan a fourth-grade rating in judo which is considered extremely high. Prior to evacuation he had been a judo instructor and after arriving in Poston he had continued in that activity at the Judo Club under the auspices of the Department of Adult Education.\n\nHe was not widely known to the Poston residents but moved among close friends, neighbors, the Goh Club, and his associates in judo. Because of his high judo rating, he enjoyed a good deal of prestige and was the leader of a group of younger men who were principally his students. Although he had a brother in the American Army, his own attitude was one of dislike toward the United States.\n\nAs far as the attack [on Nishimura] was concerned, there was no evidence that he had had anything to do with it, but the"
