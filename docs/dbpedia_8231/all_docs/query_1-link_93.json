        "meta_description": "Jennison Machisti Myrie-Williams (born 17 May 1988) is an English footballer who plays as a winger for National League South club Chippenham Town. Myrie-Williams began his career at Bristol City, progressing through the club's youth system before making his first-team debut in May 2006. He played regularly for Bristol City during the 2006–07 season as the club were promoted to the Championship. During the 2007–08 season, Myrie-Williams was loaned out to Cheltenham Town and Tranmere Rovers respectively in order to gain more first-team experience. The following season, he was loaned out to Cheltenham Town again, before having further loan spells at Carlisle United and Hereford United. He was released by Bristol City in May 2009, and joined Scottish Premier League club Dundee United on a free transfer a month later. After a season at Dundee United, Myrie-Williams moved to St Johnstone on a free transfer, making five appearances, before leaving the club in January 2011. He joined League Two club Oxford United in the same month, but the deal collapsed due to the fact that the player had already played for two clubs during the 2010–11 campaign. In July 2011, Myrie-Williams signed for League One club Stevenage on a free transfer. Myrie-Williams joined Port Vale on a six-week loan spell in November 2011, and following his release by Stevenage in May 2012, signed for the club on a permanent basis two months later. He helped Port Vale to secure promotion out of League Two during the 2012–13 season, and was also voted onto the PFA Team of the Year. He signed with Scunthorpe United in June 2014, and had a second spell on loan at Tranmere Rovers in January 2015. He joined Irish club Sligo Rovers in August 2015, and then signed for Newport County in June 2016. He signed with National League club Torquay United in September 2017, and then moved on to Hereford five months later. He helped Hereford to win the Southern League Premier Division title at the end of the 2017–18 season. Myrie-Williams left Hereford in October 2018 and spent the remainder of the 2018–19 season at National League South club Weston-super-Mare, before joining Gloucester City in June 2019. He rejoined Weston-super-Mare in March 2020 and signed with Chippenham Town in August 2021.",
