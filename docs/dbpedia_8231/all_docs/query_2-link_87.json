In addition, no study has examined the rSO2 levels in children of a broad age range. In this study, we aimed to assess and compare rSO2 levels in pediatric patients of different age groups undergoing non-cardiac surgery. We used two oximeters, tNIRS-1, which uses time-resolved spectroscopy, and conventional INVOS 5100C. Seventy-eight children-26 infants, 26 toddlers, and 26 schoolchildren-undergoing non-cardiac surgery were included. We investigated the differences in the rSO2 levels among the age groups and the correlation between the models and physiological factors influencing the rSO2 values. rSO2 measured by INVOS 5100C was significantly lower in infants than those in other patients. rSO2 measured by tNIRS-1 was higher in the toddler group than those in the other groups. The rSO2 values of tNIRS-1 and INVOS 5100C were moderately correlated (r = 0.41); however, those of INVOS 5100C were approximately 20% higher, and a ceiling effect was observed. The values in INVOS 5100C and tNIRS-1 were affected by blood pressure and the minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane, respectively. In pediatric patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, rSO2 values differed across the three age groups, and the pattern of these differences varied between the two oximeters employing different algorithms. Further research must be conducted to clarify cerebral oxygenation in children.\n\nKentaro Nishioka, Takayuki Hashimoto, Takashi Mori, Yusuke Uchinami, Rumiko Kinoshita, Norio Katoh, Hiroshi Taguchi, Koichi Yasuda, Yoichi M Ito, Seishin Takao, Masaya Tamura, Taeko Matsuura, Shinichi Shimizu, Hiroki Shirato, Hidefumi Aoyama\n\nAdvances in radiation oncology 9 5 101464 - 101464 2024年05月\n\nPURPOSE: In real-time image-gated spot-scanning proton therapy (RGPT), the dose distribution is distorted by gold fiducial markers placed in the prostate. Distortion can be suppressed by using small markers and more than 2 fields, but additional fields may increase the dose to organs at risk. Therefore, we conducted a prospective study to evaluate the safety and short-term clinical outcome of RGPT for prostate cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Based on the previously reported frequency of early adverse events (AE) and the noninferiority margin of 10%, the required number of cases was calculated to be 43 using the one-sample binomial test by the Southwest Oncology Group statistical tools with the one-sided significance level of 2.5% and the power 80%. Patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled and 3 to 4 pure gold fiducial markers of 1.5-mm diameter were inserted in the prostate. The prescribed dose was 70 Gy(relative biologic effectiveness) in 30 fractions, and treatment was performed with 3 fields from the left, right, and the back, or 4 fields from either side of slightly anterior and posterior oblique fields. The primary endpoint was the frequency of early AE (≥grade 2) and the secondary endpoint was the biochemical relapse-free survival rate and the frequency of late AE. RESULTS: Forty-five cases were enrolled between 2015 and 2017, and all patients completed the treatment protocol. The median follow-up period was 63.0 months. The frequency of early AE (≥grade 2) was observed in 4 cases (8.9%), therefore the noninferiority was verified. The overall 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival rate was 88.9%. As late AE, grade 2 rectal bleeding was observed in 8 cases (17.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The RGPT for prostate cancer with 1.5-mm markers and 3- or 4- fields was as safe as conventional proton therapy in early AE, and its efficacy was comparable with previous studies.\n\nHiroyuki Natsui, Masaya Watanabe, Takashi Yokota, Satonori Tsuneta, Yoshizuki Fumoto, Haruka Handa, Matsushima Shouji, Jiro Koya, Kotaro Nishino, Daishiro Tatsuta, Takuya Koizumi, Takahide Kadosaka, Motoki Nakao, Taro Koya, Taro Temma, Yoichi M.

However, the role of EAT in the development of postoperative AF (POAF) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between EAT profile and POAF occurrence in patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery. We obtained EAT samples from 53 patients to evaluate gene expression, histological changes, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity in the EAT, and protein secretion in EAT‐conditioned medium. EAT volume was measured using computed tomography scan. Eighteen patients (34%) experienced POAF within 7 days after surgery. Although no significant difference was observed in EAT profile between patients with and without POAF, logistic regression analysis identified that the mRNA expression levels of tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α) were positively correlated and adipocyte size in the EAT was inversely correlated with onset of POAF, respectively. Mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity in the EAT was not associated with POAF occurrence; however, it showed an inverse correlation with adipocyte size and a positive correlation with adiponectin secretion. In conclusion, changes in the secretory profile and adipocyte morphology of the EAT, which represent qualitative aspects of the adipose tissue, were present before the onset of AF.\n\nTaku Murakami, Keita Minami, Toru Harabayashi, Satoru Maruyama, Norikata Takada, Akira Kashiwagi, Haruka Miyata, Yasuyuki Sato, Ryuji Matsumoto, Hiroshi Kikuchi, Takashige Abe, Yoichi M Ito, Sachiyo Murai, Nobuo Shinohara, Hiroshi Harada, Takahiro Osawa\n\nScientific reports 14 1 6801 - 6801 2024年03月21日\n\nWe designed this multi-center prospective study with the following objectives: (1) the cross-sectional validation of extracellular vesicles (EV) mRNA markers to detect urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) before transurethral resection of bladder cancer (TURBT), and (2) the longitudinal validation of EV mRNA markers to monitor non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) recurrence after TURBT. EV mRNA markers evaluated in this study were KRT17, GPRC5A, and SLC2A1 in addition to two additional markers from literatures, MDK and CXCR2, and measured by quantitative RT-PCR with normalization by a reference gene (ALDOB). Diagnostic performances of EV mRNA markers were compared to conventional markers. Regarding the first objective, we confirmed that EV mRNA biomarkers in urine were higher in UBC patients, particularly those with higher stage/grade tumors, than in those without UBC (n = 278 in total) and the diagnostic performance of EV mRNA MDK and KRT17 outperformed conventional biomarkers with AUC 0.760 and 0.730, respectively. Concerning the second objective, we prospectively analyzed the time courses of EV mRNA markers while NMIBC patients (n = 189) (median follow-up 19 months). The expression of EV mRNA KRT17 was significantly high in patients with recurrence, while it gradually decreased over time in those without recurrence (p < 0.01).\n\nMasahito Kawabori, Satoshi Kuroda, Hideo Shichinohe, Kaoru Kahata, Souichi Shiratori, Satoshi Ikeda, Taisuke Harada, Kenji Hirata, Khin Khin Tha, Masato Aragaki, Shunsuke Terasaka, Yoichi M Ito, Naoki Nishimoto, Shunsuke Ohnishi, Ichiro Yabe, Kohsuke Kudo, Kiyohiro Houkin, Miki Fujimura\n\nMed (New York, N.Y.) 2024年03月18日\n\nBACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and neurological disability worldwide, and stem cell therapy is highly expected to reverse the sequelae. This phase 1/2, first-in-human study evaluated the safety, feasibility, and monitoring of an intracerebral-transplanted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-trackable autologous bone marrow stromal cell (HUNS001-01) for patients with subacute ischemic stroke. METHODS: The study included adults with severe disability due to ischemic stroke. HUNS001-01 cultured with human platelet lysates and labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide was stereotactically transplanted into the peri-infarct area 47-64 days after ischemic stroke onset (dose: 2 or 5 × 107 cells). Neurological and radiographic evaluations were performed throughout 1 year after cell transplantation. The trial was registered at UMIN Clinical Trial Registry (number UMIN000026130). FINDINGS: All seven patients who met the inclusion criteria successfully achieved cell expansion, underwent intracerebral transplantation, and completed 1 year of follow-up. No product-related adverse events were observed. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin scale scores before transplantation were 13 and 4, which showed improvements of 1-8 and 0-2, respectively. Cell tracking proved that the engrafted cells migrated toward the infarction border area 1-6 months after transplantation, and the quantitative susceptibility mapping revealed that cell signals at the migrated area constantly increased throughout the follow-up period up to 34% of that of the initial transplanted site. CONCLUSIONS: Intracerebral transplantation of HUNS001-01 was safe and well tolerated. Cell tracking shed light on the therapeutic mechanisms of intracerebral transplantation.

Although the efficacy of docetaxel and other cytotoxic agents for advanced EMPD has been reported in small retrospective case studies, no treatment has been proven effective in prospective clinical trials. We established the world's first in vivo EMPD experimental model (a patient-derived xenograft model). In our treatment experiment, xenograft tumours showed a remarkable response to eribulin. This study evaluates the efficacy of eribulin for patients with advanced EMPD. In October 2022, we started a single-arm phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of eribulin as a treatment for adult patients with unresectable EMPD with measurable lesions. Enrolment in this clinical trial is open to patients with any prior treatment for EMPD. The primary endpoint is overall response rate; the secondary endpoints include disease control rate, overall survival, progression-free survival and adverse events. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hokkaido University and the other collaborating institutions. If the primary endpoint is met, it is our hope that eribulin will be regarded as a standard medication for patients with advanced EMPD.\n\nTakashi Miyakoshi, Shuhei Ishikawa, Ryo Okubo, Naoki Hashimoto, Norihiro Sato, Ichiro Kusumi, Yoichi M Ito\n\nJournal of psychiatric research 168 149 - 156 2023年10月27日\n\nAntipsychotic medications increase the risk of abnormal glucose metabolism. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to predict this risk because it is affected by medication-related and background factors. This study aimed to identify the risk factors for abnormal glucose metabolism during antipsychotic treatment. We conducted a multicenter, prospective, cohort study in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. Of these patients, those with prediabetes or possible diabetes were excluded. Finally, 706 patients were included in the analysis. The hazard ratio (HR) for each factor was calculated for events of progression to hyperglycemia using time-dependent Cox regression analysis stratified according to facility type and adjusted for available background and drug-related factors. Treatments with olanzapine (HR = 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-4.05), clozapine (HR = 4.25, 95% CI = 1.56-11.60), and chlorpromazine (HR = 4.48, 95% CI = 1.21-16.57), overweight and obesity (HR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.02-2.41), and hypertriglyceridemia (HR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.02-2.88) were associated with a significantly higher occurrence of hyperglycemic progression. The number and daily dose of antipsychotics were not associated with their occurrence. Our study demonstrated that more careful monitoring is necessary during olanzapine, clozapine, and chlorpromazine treatment because of the higher occurrence of abnormalities in glucose metabolism. Furthermore, patients with obesity or hypertriglyceridemia warrant monitoring for the occurrence of abnormal glucose metabolism, regardless of the type of antipsychotic medication.\n\nAika Miya, Akinobu Nakamura, Yuka Suzuki, Hiroshi Nomoto, Hiraku Kameda, Kyu Yong Cho, Yoichi M Ito, So Nagai, Hideaki Miyoshi, Tatsuya Atsumi\n\nDiabetes, obesity & metabolism 25 7 1883 - 1889 2023年07月\n\nAIM: To evaluate the contribution of body fat mass and serum adiponectin concentration to glucose variability (GV) stability in people with type 2 diabetes with impaired versus preserved endogenous insulin secretion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicentre prospective observational study included 193 people with type 2 diabetes who underwent ambulatory continuous glucose monitoring, abdominal computed tomography and fasting blood sampling. A fasting C-peptide (FCP) concentration >2 ng/mL was defined as preserved endogenous insulin secretion. The participants were divided into high (FCP > 2 ng/mL) and low FCP subgroups (FCP ≤ 2 ng/mL). Multivariate regression analysis was performed in each subgroup. RESULTS: In the high FCP subgroup, the coefficient of variation (CV) in GV was unrelated to abdominal fat area. In the low FCP subgroup, a high CV was significantly related to small abdominal visceral fat area (β = -0.11, standard error 0.03; P < 0.05) and to small subcutaneous fat area (β = -0.09, standard error 0.04; P < 0.05). No significant relationship between serum adiponectin concentration and continuous glucose monitoring-related variables was found. CONCLUSIONS: The contribution of body fat mass to GV depends on the endogenous insulin secretion residue. A small body fat area has independent adverse effects on GV in people with type 2 diabetes and impaired endogenous insulin secretion.\n\nSho Nakakubo, Naoki Kishida, Kenichi Okuda, Keisuke Kamada, Masami Iwama, Masaru Suzuki, Isao Yokota, Yoichi M Ito, Yasuyuki Nasuhara, Richard C Boucher, Satoshi Konno\n\nThe Lancet. Infectious diseases 2023年06月30日\n\nBACKGROUND: Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination, coupled with the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, have modified COVID-19 clinical manifestations. We aimed to characterise the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 individuals in omicron BA.2 and BA.5 Japanese pandemic periods to identify omicron and subvariant associations between symptoms, immune status, and clinical outcomes. METHODS: In this registry-based observational study, individuals registered in Sapporo's web-based COVID-19 information system entered 12 pre-selected symptoms, days since symptom onset, vaccination history, SARS-CoV-2 infection history, and background. Eligibility criteria included symptomatic individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (PCR or antigen test), and individuals who were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 but developed new symptoms after a household member tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Symptom prevalence, variables associated with symptoms, and symptoms associated with progression to severe disease were analysed. FINDINGS: Data were collected and analysed between April 25 and Sept 25, 2022. For 157 861 omicron-infected symptomatic individuals, cough was the most common symptom (99 032 [62·7%] patients), followed by sore throat (95 838 [60·7%] patients), nasal discharge (69 968 [44·3%] patients), and fever (61 218 [38·8%] patients). Omicron BA.5 infection was associated with a higher prevalence of systemic symptoms than BA.2 in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for fever: 2·18 [95% CI 2·12-2·25]). Omicron breakthrough-infected individuals with three or more vaccinations or previous infection were less likely to exhibit systemic symptoms (fever 0·50 [0·49-0·51]), but more likely to exhibit upper respiratory symptoms (sore throat 1·33 [1·29-1·36]; nasal discharge 1·84 [1·80-1·89]). Infected older individuals (≥65 years) had lower odds for all symptoms. However, when symptoms were manifest, systemic symptoms were associated with increased odds for severe disease (dyspnoea 3·01 [1·84-4·91]; fever 2·93 [1·89-4·52]), whereas upper respiratory symptoms were associated with decreased odds (sore throat 0·38 [0·24-0·63]; nasal discharge 0·48 [0·28-0·81]). INTERPRETATION: Host immunological status, omicron subvariant, and age were associated with a spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes. BA.5 produced a higher systemic symptom prevalence than BA.2. Vaccination and previous infection reduced systemic symptom prevalence and improved outcomes but increased upper respiratory tract symptom prevalence. Systemic, but not upper respiratory, symptoms in older people heralded severe disease. Our findings could serve as a practical guide to use COVID-19 symptoms to appropriately modify health-care strategies and predict clinical outcomes for older patients with omicron infections.

In this report, we aimed to clarify their 5-year risk of stroke and its predictors. METHODS: We are conducting a multicenter, prospective cohort study (Asymptomatic Moyamoya Registry) in Japan. Participants were eligible if they were 20 to 70 years, had bilateral or unilateral moyamoya disease, experienced no episodes suggestive of TIA and stroke; and were functionally independent (modified Rankin Scale score 0-1). Demographic and radiological information was collected at enrollment. In this study, they are still followed up for 10 years. In this interim analysis, we defined the primary end point as a stroke occurring during a 5-year follow-up period. Independent predictors for stroke were also determined, using a stratification analysis method. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2015, we enrolled 109 patients, of whom 103 patients with 182 involved hemispheres completed the 5-year follow-up. According to the findings on DSA and MRA, 143 hemispheres were judged as moyamoya disease and 39 hemispheres as questionable manifestations (isolated middle cerebral artery stenosis). The patients with questionable hemispheres were significantly older, more often male, and more frequently had hypertension than those with moyamoya hemisphere. Moyamoya hemispheres developed 7 strokes, including 6 hemorrhagic and 1 ischemic stroke, during the first 5 years. The annual risk of stroke was 1.4% per person, 0.8% per hemisphere, and 1.0% per moyamoya hemisphere. Independent predictor for stroke was Grade-2 choroidal anastomosis (hazard ratio, 5.05 [95% CI, 1.24-20.6]; P=0.023). Furthermore, microbleeds (hazard ratio, 4.89 [95% CI, 1.13-21.3]; P=0.0342) and Grade-2 choroidal anastomosis (hazard ratio, 7.05 [95% CI, 1.62-30.7]; P=0.0093) significantly predicted hemorrhagic stroke. No questionable hemispheres developed any stroke. CONCLUSIONS: The hemispheres with asymptomatic moyamoya disease may carry a 1.0% annual risk of stroke during the first 5 years, the majority of which are hemorrhagic stroke. Grade-2 choroidal anastomosis may predict stroke, and the microbleeds and Grade-2 choroidal anastomosis may carry the risk for hemorrhagic stroke. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.

The inclusion criteria were glioma patients registered in the Electronic Data Capture system, the Proton-net, between May 2016 and July 2019. Data on patient characteristics, treatments, late adverse events, survival status, recurrence and secondary tumors were extracted and statistically analyzed. The primary endpoint was the overall survival (OS) rate, and the secondary endpoints were the progression-free survival (PFS) rate and cumulative local recurrence rate (cLRR). Of the 65 primary brain tumor patients registered, 29 glioma patients from eight of 19 PBT facilities met the inclusion criteria. There were 19 glioblastoma patients, eight of other malignant gliomas, and two of low-grade gliomas. For glioblastomas, with a median follow-up period of 16 months, the median survival time was 21.2 months and the OS at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years were 77.4%, 44.9%, 23.9% and 23.9%, respectively. The median PFS period was 10.1 months, the 1, 2, 3 and 4-year PFS were 32.4%, 19.4%, 9.7% and 9.7%, respectively. The 1, 2, 3 and 4-year cLRR were 56.1%, 68.8%, 78.4 and 78.4%, respectively. Grade 3 brain necrosis was observed in two patients. No secondary tumor was observed. This is the first report on the current status of PBT for gliomas in Japan. For glioblastomas, the outcomes of PBT are estimated to be equivalent to historical data of photon therapy. The results of a prospective comparative evaluation of PBT and photon therapy are awaited.\n\nMai Yoshimura, Masumi Kawamura, Satoko Hasegawa, Yoichi M.

However, defects in the IVD after discectomy may lead to inadequate tissue healing and predispose patients to the development of IVD degeneration. Ultrapurified stem cells (rapidly expanding clones (RECs)), combined with an in situ-forming bioresorbable gel (dMD-001), have been developed to fill IVD defects and prevent IVD degeneration after discectomy. We aim to investigate the safety and efficacy of a new treatment method in which a combination of REC and dMD-001 is implanted into the IVD of patients with combined LSCS. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, prospective, double-blind randomised controlled trial. Forty-five participants aged 20-75 years diagnosed with combined LSCS will be assessed for eligibility. After performing laminoplasty and discectomy, participants will be randomised 1:1:1 into the combination of REC and dMD-001 (REC-dMD-001) group, the dMD-001 group or the laminoplasty and discectomy alone (control) group. The primary outcomes of the trial will be the safety and effectiveness of the procedure. The effectiveness will be assessed using visual analogue scale scores of back pain and leg pain as well as MRI-based estimations of morphological and compositional quality of the IVD tissue. Secondary outcomes will include self-assessed clinical scores and other MRI-based estimations of compositional quality of the IVD tissue. All evaluations will be performed at baseline and at 1, 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks after surgery. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the ethics committees of the institutions involved. We plan to conduct dissemination of the outcome data by presenting our data at national and international conferences, as well as through formal publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

We measured total cerebral hemoglobin concentrations, which reflect cerebral blood volume (CBV), and cerebral oxygen saturation, using time-domain near-infrared spectroscopy, which can measure the absolute values of cerebral hemoglobin concentrations. We also measured cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler as an indicator of cerebral blood flow (CBF). We did so to examine the effect of remimazolam on cerebral circulation in humans, as assessed CBV, CBF, and cerebral oxygen saturation. METHODS: This was a prospective, observational study. Fifteen patients without serious complications scheduled for general anesthesia were recruited. We measured total cerebral hemoglobin concentrations, CBFV, and cerebral oxygen saturation throughout the anesthetic induction course with remimazolam. RESULTS: Total cerebral hemoglobin concentrations did not change during the process (p = 0.51). In contrast, the mean CBFV was reduced by 11% (significant, p = 0.04). The drop in mean blood pressure following the induction of anesthesia was 17%; however, it was within the range of cerebrovascular autoregulation. Moreover, cerebral oxygen saturation increased by 4% (statistically significant, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found that anesthetic induction with remimazolam did not alter CBV and reduced CBF in uncomplicated patients.\n\nRumiko Kinoshita, Takashi Mitamura, Fumi Kato, Takahiro Hattori, Hajime Higaki, Shuhei Takahashi, Yoshihiro Fujita, Manami Otsuka, Fuki Koizumi, Yusuke Uchinami, Takashi Mori, Kentaro Nishioka, Takayuki Hashimoto, Yoichi M Ito, Hidemichi Watari, Hidefumi Aoyama\n\nJournal of radiation research 64 2 463 - 470 2023年01月03日\n\nMost oncogenic human papilloma virus (HPV) genotypes stratify into two species, α-7 HPV and α-9 HPV.

We conducted the study using the HPV test performed by cytology specimens which is less invasive and more useful in clinical settings. This study enrolled 46 patients who received HPV genotyping before the definitive radiotherapy. The results of the HPV genotyping were classified into HPVα-7, HPVα-9 and negatives. Of the 46 patients, 10 were positive for HPVα-7, 21 positive for HPVα-9 and 15 were negative. The median follow-up period was 38 months (range 4-142). The HPVα-7, HPVα-9 and negative groups showed the 3-year overall survival (OS; 59.3%, 80.4% and 72.2% [P = 0.25]); local control (LC; 67.5%, 81% and 80% [P = 0.78]); pelvic control (PC) (50%, 81% and 72.7% [P = 0.032]); pelvic lymph node (PLN) control (78.7%, 95% and 92.3% [P = 0.012]); distant metastasis free (DMF) survival (50%, 75.4% and 42.8% [P = 0.098]); and progression free survival (PFS) rate of patients (30%, 66.7% and 38.9% [P = 0.085]), respectively. Patients with HPVα-7 showed statistically significant poorer PC than the HPVα-9 group, in multivariate analysis. This result is consistent with previous studies for HPV positive patients. The HPV negativity rate was higher in this study than in other studies and further work on this may be needed for clinical use.\n\nKaoruko Shimizu, Hirokazu Kimura, Naoya Tanabe, Shotaro Chubachi, Susumu Sato, Masaru Suzuki, Kazuya Tanimura, Hiroaki Iijima, Akira Oguma, Yoichi M Ito, Nobuyasu Wakazono, Michiko Takimoto-Sato, Machiko Matsumoto-Sasaki, Yuki Abe, Nozomu Takei, Hironi Makita, Masaharu Nishimura, Satoshi Konno\n\nFrontiers in physiology 14 1137603 - 1137603 2023年\n\nBackground: The mechanism of high transfer coefficients of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Kco) in non-smokers with asthma is explained by the redistribution of blood flow to the area with preserved ventilation, to match the ventilation perfusion. Objectives: To examine whether ventilation heterogeneity, assessed by pulmonary function tests, is associated with computed tomography (CT)-based vascular indices and Kco in patients with asthma. Methods: Participants were enrolled from the Hokkaido-based Investigative Cohort Analysis for Refractory Asthma (Hi-CARAT) study that included a prospective asthmatic cohort. Pulmonary function tests including Kco, using single breath methods; total lung capacity (TLC), using multiple breath methods; and CT, were performed on the same day. The ratio of the lung volume assessed using single breath methods (alveolar volume; VA) to that using multiple breath methods (TLC) was calculated as an index of ventilation heterogeneity. The volume of the pulmonary small vessels <5 mm2 in the whole lung (BV5 volume), and number of BV5 at a theoretical surface area of the lungs from the plural surface (BV5 number) were evaluated using chest CT images. Results: The low VA/TLC group (the lowest quartile) had significantly lower BV5 number, BV5 volume, higher BV5 volume/BV5 number, and higher Kco compared to the high VA/TLC group (the highest quartile) in 117 non-smokers, but not in 67 smokers. Multivariable analysis showed that low VA/TLC was associated with low BV5 number, after adjusting for age, sex, weight, lung volume on CT, and CT emphysema index in non-smokers (not in smokers). Conclusion: Ventilation heterogeneity may be associated with low BV5 number and high Kco in non-smokers (not in smokers). Future studies need to determine the dynamic regional system in ventilation, perfusion, and diffusion in asthma.\n\nMiho Sato, Takahiro Osawa, Takashige Abe, Michitaka Honda, Madoka Higuchi, Shuhei Yamada, Jun Furumido, Hiroshi Kikuchi, Ryuji Matsumoto, Yasuyuki Sato, Yoshihiro Sasaki, Toru Harabayashi, Satoru Maruyama, Norikata Takada, Keita Minami, Hiroshi Tanaka, Ken Morita, Akira Kashiwagi, Sachiyo Murai, Yoichi M Ito, Katsuhiko Ogasawara, Nobuo Shinohara\n\nScientific reports 12 1 21544 - 21544 2022年12月13日\n\nThe Body Image Scale (BIS) is a 10-item tool that measures the body images of cancer patients. This study aims to validate the Japanese version of the BIS for bladder cancer patients. A multicenter cross-sectional survey was used to identify the participants, which included Japanese bladder cancer patients. The percentage of missing responses, internal consistency, and known-group validity were evaluated. The correlations between the BIS and two HRQOL instruments (the Bladder Cancer Index and the SF-12) were assessed to determine convergent validity. Among 397 patients, 221 patients were treated by transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) endoscopically, 49 patients underwent cystectomy with neobladder, and 127 patients underwent cystectomy involving stoma. The percentage of missing responses in the BIS ranged from 8.1 to 15.6%. Cronbach's α coefficient was 0.924. Higher BIS scores indicate negative body image, and the median BIS score for patients with native bladders after TURBT (0.5) was significantly lower than those of the patients with neobladder (4.0) and stoma formation (7.0), which indicated the discriminatory ability of the BIS. Each domain of the Bladder Cancer Index and the role summary score of the SF-12 correlated to the BIS scores, which confirmed the convergent validity. A range of BIS scores were identified among patients who reported similar physical summary scores and mental summary scores of the SF-12. This study confirmed the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the BIS for bladder cancer patients.\n\nYoshifumi Takeda, Masataka Yamamoto, Koji Hoshino, Yoichi M Ito, Nobuyasu Kato, Satoru Wakasa, Yuji Morimoto\n\nPediatric cardiology 2022年09月01日\n\nPalliative surgery is often performed in the treatment of congenital heart disease. Two representative palliative procedures are the systemic pulmonary shunt and pulmonary artery banding. Dramatic changes in cerebral hemodynamics may occur in these operations due to changes in the pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio and systemic oxygenation. However, there seem to be almost no studies evaluating them. Accordingly, we evaluated cerebral perfusion by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and cerebral oxygenation by near infrared spectroscopy during these procedures. In the post hoc analysis of a previous prospective observational study, cerebral blood flow velocities of the middle cerebral artery measured by transcranial Doppler were compared between the start and end of surgery as were the pulsatility index and resistance index. The cerebral oxygenation values were also compared between the start and end of surgery. Twenty-two infants with systemic pulmonary shunt and 20 infants with pulmonary artery banding were evaluated. There were no significant differences of the flow velocities between the start and end of surgery in either procedure. The pulsatility index significantly increased after pulmonary artery banding, which may compete with the increase in cerebral perfusion due to the increase in systemic blood flow. The cerebral oxygenation decreased in both procedures, possibly due to an increase in body temperature. Arterial oxygen saturation was almost the same before and after both procedures. Contrary to our expectation, the changes in cerebral hemodynamics in the palliative operations were small if the management of physiological indices such as arterial oxygen saturation was properly performed during the procedures.\n\nYasuyuki Kawamoto, Satoshi Yuki, Kentaro Sawada, Michio Nakamura, Osamu Muto, Susumu Sogabe, Yoshiaki Shindo, Atsushi Ishiguro, Atsushi Sato, Yasushi Tsuji, Masayoshi Dazai, Hiroyuki Okuda, Takashi Meguro, Kazuaki Harada, Mari Sekiguchi, Kazufumi Okada, Yoichi M Ito, Yuh Sakata, Naoya Sakamoto, Yoshito Komatsu\n\nThe oncologist 27 8 e642-e649 2022年08月05日\n\nBACKGROUND: Ramucirumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 antibody that inhibits tumor cell growth and affects the tumor cell microenvironment. We assessed the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab plus irinotecan combination therapy as second-line treatment in patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory or intolerant to primary chemotherapy were included. Ramucirumab 8 mg/kg plus irinotecan 150 mg/m2 combination therapy was administered every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months and secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, response rate, safety, and dose intensity for each drug. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were enrolled between January 2018 and September 2019. The progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 26.5% [95%CI, 13.2%-41.8%, P = .1353)]. Median progression-free and overall survivals were 4.2 months (95%CI, 2.5-5.4 months) and 9.6 months (95%CI, 6.4-16.6 months), respectively. The overall response rate was 25.9% (95%CI, 11.1-36.3%) and disease control rate was 85.2% (95%CI, 66.3-95.8%). Grade ≥3 adverse events that occurred in >10% of patients included neutropenia, leucopenia, anemia, anorexia, and febrile neutropenia. No death or new safety signals with a causal relation to the study treatment were observed. CONCLUSION: Although the primary endpoint was not achieved statistically, combination therapy of ramucirumab plus irinotecan showed anticancer activity and a manageable safety profile for second-line treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer.\n\nShinya Yamaguchi, Kazuhiro Watanabe, Naotaka Sugimura, Inaho Shishido, Issei Konya, Tomoko Fujita, Yuichi Yoshimitsu, Shintaro Kato, Yoichi M.

We explored the profiles of salivary biomarkers associated with nurses' chronic fatigue across several shifts. This longitudinal study involved 45 shiftwork nurses and collected their saliva samples before two night and two day shifts for a month. Chronic fatigue was measured using the Cumulative Fatigue Symptom Index before the first night shift. Biomarker profiles were analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis, and chronic fatigue levels were compared between the profiles. Cortisol profiles were classified into high- and low-level groups across two day shifts; the low-level group presented significantly higher irritability and unwillingness to work. Secretory immunoglobulin A (s-IgA) profiles across the four shifts were classified into high- and low-level groups; the high-level group had significantly higher depressive feelings, decreased vitality, irritability, and unwillingness to work. Cortisol (two day shifts) and s-IgA (four shifts) profiles were combined, and (i) cortisol low-level and s-IgA high-level and (ii) cortisol high-level and s-IgA low-level groups were identified. The former group had significantly higher chronic fatigue sign and irritability than the latter group.

Current treatments are limited but include continuous rehabilitation, especially for chronic brain injury. Recent studies have demonstrated that the intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has therapeutic efficacy for several neurological diseases, including stroke and spinal cord injury. Objective The objective of our investigator-initiated clinical trial is to assess the safety and potential efficacy of the intravenous infusion of autoserum-expanded autologous MSCs for patients with chronic brain injury. Methods The (phase 2) trial will be a single-arm, open-label trial with the primary objective of confirming the safety and efficacy of autoserum-expanded autologous MSCs (STR-01; produced under good manufacturing practices) when administered to patients with chronic brain injury. The estimated number of enrolled participants is 6 to 20 patients with a modified Rankin Scale grade of 3 to 5. The assessment of safety and the proportion of cases in which the modified Rankin Scale grade improves by 1 point or more at 180 days after the injection of STR-01 will be performed after MSC infusion. Results We received approval for our clinical trial from the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency on December 12, 2017. The trial will be completed on June 11, 2023. The registration term is 5 years. The recruitment of the patients for this trial started on April 20, 2018, at Sapporo Medical University Hospital in Japan. Conclusions Our phase 2 study will aim to address the safety and efficacy of the intravenous infusion of MSCs for patients with chronic brain injury. The use of STR-01 has been performed for patients with cerebral infarction and spinal cord injury, providing encouraging results. The potential therapeutic efficacy of the systemic administration of autoserum-expanded autologous MSCs for chronic brain injury should be evaluated, given its safety and promising results for stroke and spinal cord injury.

In this study, we examined whether obesity reduces airway/circulatory CC16 levels using experimental and epidemiological studies. Then, we explored the mediatory role of CC16 in the relationship of overweight/obesity with clinical asthma measures. METHODS: Circulating CC16 levels were assessed by ELISA in three independent human populations, including two groups of healthy and general populations and asthma patients. The percentage of cells expressing club markers in obese vs. non-obese mice and human airways was determined by immunohistochemistry. A causal mediation analysis was conducted to determine whether circulatory CC16 acted as a mediator between overweight/obesity and clinical asthma measures. RESULTS: BMI was significantly and monotonously associated with reduced circulating CC16 levels in all populations. The percentage of CC16-expressing cells was reduced in the small airways of both mice and humans with obesity. Finally, mediation analysis revealed significant contributions of circulatory CC16 in the association between BMI and clinical asthma measures; 21.8% of its total effect in BMI's association with airway hyperresponsiveness of healthy subjects (p = 0.09), 26.4% with asthma severity (p = 0.030), and 23% with the required dose of inhaled corticosteroid (p = 0.042). In logistic regression analysis, 1-SD decrease in serum CC16 levels of asthma patients was associated with 87% increased odds for high dose ICS requirement (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that airway/circulating CC16, which is inversely associated with BMI, may mediate development and severity in overweight/obese asthma.\n\nToru Nakamura, Tsuyoshi Hayashi, Yasutoshi Kimura, Hiroshi Kawakami, Kuniyuki Takahashi, Hirotoshi Ishiwatari, Takuma Goto, Masayo Motoya, Keisuke Yamakita, Yusuke Sakuhara, Michihiro Ono, Eiichi Tanaka, Makoto Omi, Katsuhiko Murakawa, Tomoya Iida, Tamaki Sakurai, Shin Haba, Takehiro Abiko, Yoichi M Ito, Hiroyuki Maguchi, Satoshi Hirano\n\nScientific reports 12 1 9966 - 9966 2022年06月15日\n\nAlthough neoadjuvant therapy (Nac) is recommended for high-risk resectable pancreatic cancer (R-PDAC), evidence regarding specific regimes is scarce. This report aimed to investigate the efficacy of S-1 Nac for R-PDAC. In a multicenter phase II trial, we investigated the efficacy of Nac S-1 (an oral fluoropyrimidine agent containing tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium) in R-PDAC patients. The protocol involved two cycles of preoperative S-1 chemotherapy, followed by surgery, and four cycles of postoperative S-1 chemotherapy. Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were the primary endpoint. Overall survival (OS) rates and median survival time (MST) were secondary endpoints. Forty-nine patients were eligible, and 31 patients underwent resection following Nac, as per protocol (31/49; 63.3%). Per-protocol analysis included data from 31 patients, yielding the 2-year PFS rate of 58.1%, and 2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates of 96.8%, 54.8%, and 44.0%, respectively. MST was 49.2 months. Intention-to-treat analysis involved 49 patients, yielding the 2-year PFS rate of 40.8%, and the 2-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates of 87.8%, 46.9%, and 33.9%, respectively. MST was 35.5 months. S-1 single regimen might be an option for Nac in R-PDAC; however, the high drop-out rate (36.7%) was a limitation of this study.\n\nSatoshi Yamaguchi, Keiko Yamada, Yoichi M Ito, Takeshi Fuji, Kimihito Sato, Takashi Ohe\n\nModern rheumatology 33 3 617 - 622 2022年06月11日\n\nOBJECTIVES: This study aimed to clarify the frequency-response relationship between exercise habits and locomotive syndrome in different age groups. METHODS: We analyzed 8,681 independent community dwellers who participated in a nationwide cross-sectional locomotive syndrome study. Participants were divided into young (20-39 years), middle (40-64 years), and old (≥ 65 years) groups. The presence of locomotive syndrome was evaluated using the locomotive syndrome risk tests. Exercise habits were assessed by exercise frequency (almost every day/sometimes/occasionally/never). The association between locomotive syndrome and exercise was assessed using the multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for participant characteristics for each age category. RESULTS: Overall, 3,528 (41%) participants had locomotive syndrome. In the old group, the risk of locomotive syndrome was lower with an increased exercise frequency. However, this dose-response relationship was not found in the young group. The proportion of locomotive syndrome was lower even in participants who occasionally exercised (1-3 days/month) than those who never exercise in the young and middle age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Regular exercise reduced the risk of locomotive syndrome not only in middle and older adults but also in young adults. Moreover, increasing exercise frequency may provide benefits for locomotive syndrome prevention, especially among older adults.\n\nHiroshi Asano, Katsutoshi Oda, Kosuke Yoshihara, Yoichi M Ito, Noriomi Matsumura, Muneaki Shimada, Hidemichi Watari, Takayuki Enomoto\n\nJournal of gynecologic oncology 33 4 e55 2022年05月03日\n\nBACKGROUND: Poly (adenosine diphosphate)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for tumors with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), including pathogenic mutations in BRCA1/2, have been developed. Genomic analysis revealed that about 20% of uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) have HRD, including 7.5%-10% of BRCA1/2 alterations and 4%-6% of carcinomas of the uterine corpus, and 2.5%-4% of the uterine cervix have alterations of BRCA1/2. Preclinical and clinical case reports suggest that PARP inhibitors may be effective against those targets. The Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (JGOG) is now planning to conduct a new investigator-initiated clinical trial, JGOG2052. METHODS: JGOG2052 is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of niraparib monotherapy for a recurrent or persistent rare fraction of gynecologic malignancies with BRCA1/2 mutations except for ovarian cancers. We will independently consider the effect of niraparib for uLMS or other gynecologic malignancies with BRCA1/2 mutations (cohort A, C) and HRD positive uLMS without BRCA1/2 mutations (cohort B). Participants must have 1-3 lines of previous chemotherapy and at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST (v.1.1). Niraparib will be orally administered once a day until lesion exacerbation or unacceptable adverse events occur. Efficacy will be evaluated by imaging through an additional computed tomography scan every 8 weeks. Safety will be measured weekly in cycle 1 and every 4 weeks after cycle 2 by blood tests and physical examinations. The sample size is 16-20 in each of cohort A and B, and 31 in cohort C. Primary endpoint is the objective response rate.

We retrospectively reviewed the prevalence of VTE in RA patients who visited Hokkaido University Hospital from 2010 to 2019 and had more than 2 years of follow-up. To explore the risk to develop VTE, we selected 260 RA patients without VTE (non-VTE) via density sampling and identified the risk factors for VTE by multivariate logistic regression analysis. Univariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed older age (p < 0.0001, Odds Ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.04-1.14), increase of the body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.001, OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.31), higher prevalence of RA-associated lung disease (p = 0.002, OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.33-3.30) and more frequent glucocorticoid usage (p = 0.001, OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.34-3.51) in RA patients was associated with the development of VTE significantly. Furthermore, patients with higher time-averaged disease activity score 28 (DAS28) CRP were at elevated risk (p < 0.0001, OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.94-6.12). In conditional multivariate logistic regression analysis, time averaged DAS28CRP was significantly associated with the development of VTE (p = 0.0001, adjusted OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.77-7.85). Disease activity was identified as a major risk factor of VTE in patients with RA, suggesting that sustained clinical remission could be beneficial for decrease the risk of VTE.\n\n佐々木 真知子, 清水 薫子, 鈴木 正宣, 鈴木 雅, 松本 宗大, 木村 孔一, 中丸 裕爾, 伊藤 陽一, 今野 哲\n\n日本呼吸器学会誌 11 増刊 143 - 143 (一社)日本呼吸器学会 2022年04月\n\nRyo Sawagashira, Ryodai Yamamura, Ryo Okubo, Naoki Hashimoto, Shuhei Ishikawa, Yoichi M.

METHODS: Twenty-three patients with prostate cancer were included. A treatment plan with 63 Gy (relative biological effectiveness (RBE)) in 21 fractions was generated using treatment planning computed tomography (CT) images assuming that all patients had high-risk prostate cancer for which the clinical target volume (CTV) needs to include prostate and the seminal vesicle (SV) in our treatment protocol. Twenty-one adaptive treatment plans for each patient (total 483 data sets) were generated using daily CT images, and dose distributions were calculated. Using a 3 mm set-up uncertainty in the robust optimization, the doses to the CTV, prostate, SV, rectum, and bladder were compared. RESULTS: Estimated accumulated doses of NART and DART in the 23 patients were 60.81 ± 3.47 Gy (RBE) and 63.24 ± 1.04 Gy (RBE) for CTV D99 (p < 0.01), 62.99 ± 1.28 Gy (RBE) and 63.43 ± 1.33 Gy (RBE) for the prostate D99 (p = 0.2529), and 59.07 ± 5.19 Gy (RBE) and 63.17 ± 1.04 Gy (RBE) for SV D99 (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between NART and DART in the estimated accumulated dose for the rectum and bladder. CONCLUSION: Compared with the NART, DART was shown to be a useful approach that can maintain the dose coverage to the target without increasing the dose to the organs at risk (OAR) using the 3 mm set-up uncertainty in the robust optimization in patients with high-risk prostate cancer.\n\nShinya Yamaguchi, Miho Sato, Naomi Sumi, Yoichi M Ito, Peter C Winwood, Rika Yano\n\nJournal of occupational health 64 1 e12325 2022年01月\n\nOBJECTIVES: Shift-work nurses are at a higher risk of inadequate recovery from fatigue and developing maladaptive fatigue with significant health consequences. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor fatigue and recovery levels with a reliable scale. We investigated psychometric properties of the Japanese version of the Occupational Fatigue Exhaustion Recovery scale (OFER-J) for shift-work nurses. METHODS: Japanese shift-work nurses responded to self-administered questionnaires at baseline (n = 942) and one month later (n = 334). The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were conducted to verify the structural validity and the correlation analysis and one-way analysis of variance were conducted to test the construct and discriminative validity. Cronbach's alpha coefficient, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), and smallest detectable change (SDC) were calculated to assess reliability. RESULTS: The CFA showed high correlations between the factors and whilst the goodness-of-fit of the three-factor model was suboptimal, it was in an acceptable range. Most modifications included the error covariance of the Acute Fatigue (AF) and Intershift Recovery (IR) items. The EFA showed that Chronic Fatigue (CF) and AF were not clearly separated, indicating that the two AF items dropped out. Construct and discriminative validity were also well indicated. Cronbach's alpha coefficients were 0.75-0.85. Only CF showed sufficient reproductivity (ICC = 0.74). The SDC for CF, AF, and IR was 14.0, 17.1, and 18.7, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The validity and reliability of the OFER-J were verified as acceptable for shift-work nurses. The OFER-J could contribute to a data-based approach to fatigue management in nursing management practice.\n\nMachiko Matsumoto-Sasaki, Kaoruko Simizu, Masanobu Suzuki, Masaru Suzuki, Hirokazu Kimura, Yuji Nakamaru, Yoichi M Ito, Akihiro Honma, Satoshi Konno\n\nJournal of asthma and allergy 15 187 - 195 2022年\n\nPurpose: Biologics have been used increasingly for the treatment of severe asthma. However, established guidelines for the selection, switching, or discontinuation of biologics do not exist. We aimed to identify the clinical characteristics of patients with asthma who required switching biologics and the factors associated with switching biologics. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective study of 42 patients with severe asthma treated with biologics at the Hokkaido University Hospital between 23rd June 2016 and 30th April 2021, when two biologics were available in Japan. We compared the characteristics of subjects who continued and switched biologics. The time to switch the biologics was assessed by type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, pulmonary function indices, and the presence of comorbidities, including the Japanese Epidemiological Survey of Refractory Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis (JESREC) score and aspirin exacerbated respiratory diseases (AERD), using the Kaplan-Meier method and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Eight and five patients were treated by mepolizumab and benralizumab at baseline, respectively among the 31% (13/42) who switched the biologics. Subjects who required switching biologics were characterized by high blood eosinophil counts, younger age, JESREC scores of 11 points or higher, and AERD. The time taken to switch biologics was significantly shorter in the subgroups with high JESREC scores (≥11) or AERD, compared with their counterparts with low JESREC scores or without AERD (both, P < 0.05). JESREC scores of ≥11, but not the presence of AERD, were associated with time to switch biologics. Conclusion: The presence of eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis based on JESREC scores of ≥11 and younger age were factors associated with switching biologics in asthma.\n\nKeiko Yamada, Satoshi Yamaguchi, Yoichi M Ito, Takashi Ohe\n\nBMC geriatrics 21 1 651 - 651 2021年11月19日\n\nBACKGROUND: Mobility decrease leading to disability can gradually develop during early life, however, its related factors are not well clarified. Therefore, we investigate the related factors of mobility decrease at various levels, using nationwide data in Japan. METHODS: In total, 8681 independent community dwellers aged 20-89 years were analysed (average age, 51.6 years; 58.5% women). Three stages of mobility decrease were based on the locomotive syndrome risk test: Stage 1, emerging; Stage 2, progressing; Stage 3, progressed to restrict social engagement. Age was analysed using a simple quadratic function model. RESULTS: The prevalence of Stages 1-3 was 31.6% (n = 2746), 5.8% (n = 504), and 3.2% (n = 278), respectively. On the multivariable logistic regression, increased age in participants aged ≥40 years (stage 1: odds ratio[OR] 1.05-1.20, stage 2: OR 1.04-1.22, stage 3: OR 1.05-1.22), female (stage 1: OR 2.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.99-2.61, stage 2: OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.77-3.25, stage 3: OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.19-2.72), overweight status (stage 1: OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.34-1.82, stage 2: OR 3.19, 95% CI 2.38-4.27, stage 3: OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.90-4.32), hypertension (stage 1: OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.41, stage 2: OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.49-2.64, stage 3: OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.44-3.05), and diabetes mellitus (stage 1: OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.17-2.24, stage 2: OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.93-2.66, stage 3: OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.13-3.90) were positively associated. The frequency of physical activity/sports, even a few per month, was inversely associated with all stages (stage 1: OR 0.59-0.72, stage 2: OR 0.50-0.67, stage 3: 0.36-0.53). A one-year increase in age had a stronger impact on mobility decrease in older adults than in younger ones. Increased age in participants aged < 40 years and smoking were associated with Stage 1, while intake of various foods was inversely associated with Stages 1 and 2. CONCLUSION: Increased age (< 40 years) was associated with emerging mobility decrease, while that (≥ 40 years) was associated with any levels of mobility decrease. Female, lifestyle habits, including physical activities and overweight status, were associated with mobility decrease at every level.\n\nTakayuki Hashimoto, Yusuke Demizu, Haruko Numajiri, Tomonori Isobe, Shigekazu Fukuda, Masaru Wakatsuki, Haruo Yamashita, Shigeyuki Murayama, Shigeyuki Takamatsu, Hiroyuki Katoh, Kazutoshi Murata, Ryosuke Kohno, Takeshi Arimura, Taeko Matsuura, Yoichi M Ito\n\nJapanese journal of radiology 40 5 525 - 533 2021年11月15日\n\nPURPOSE: To evaluate the outcomes of particle therapy in cancer patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 2001 to March 2013, 19,585 patients were treated with proton beam therapy (PBT) or carbon ion therapy (CIT) at 8 institutions. Of these, 69 patients (0.4%, PBT 46, CIT 22, and PBT + CIT 1) with CIEDs (64 pacemakers, 4 implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and 1 with a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator) were retrospectively reviewed. All the patients with CIEDs in this study were treated with the passive scattering type of particle beam therapy. RESULTS: Six (13%) of the 47 PBT patients, and none of the 23 CIT patients experienced CIED malfunctions (p = 0.105). Electrical resets (7) and over-sensing (3) occurred transiently in 6 patients. The distance between the edge of the irradiation field and the CIED was not associated with the incidence of malfunctions in 20 patients with lung cancer. A larger field size had a higher event rate but the test to evaluate trends as not statistically significant (p = 0.196). CONCLUSION: Differences in the frequency of occurrence of device malfunctions for patients treated with PBT and patients treated with CIT did not reach statistical significance. The present study can be regarded as a benchmark study about the incidence of malfunctioning of CIED in passive scattering particle beam therapy and can be used as a reference for active scanning particle beam therapy.\n\nYuko Uchiyama, Kenji Hirata, Shiro Watanabe, Shozo Okamoto, Tohru Shiga, Kazufumi Okada, Yoichi M Ito, Kohsuke Kudo\n\nAnnals of nuclear medicine 35 11 1223 - 1231 2021年11月\n\nBACKGROUND: Although patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) generally have a good prognosis, patients with a large metabolic tumor volume (MTV) on FDG-PET may experience poor clinical courses. We measured organ-based MTVs and tested its prognostic performance in comparison to conventional MTV (cMTV). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the cases of 280 patients who received their first I-131 therapy in 2003-2014 at our hospital and showed an FDG-avid metastatic lesion. We randomly divided the patients into training (n = 190) and validation (n = 90) datasets. We classified the MTVs as MTVneck-node, MTVdistant-node, MTVlung, MTVbone, and MTVother-organs and tested with/without dichotomization vis-à-vis overall survival (OS). Based on the estimated weighting coefficients of the organ-based MTVs, we propose a new index: the adjusted whole-body MTV (aMTV). Using the validation dataset, we compared the aMTV with cMTV for predicting OS. RESULTS: In a univariate analysis, MTVdistant-node and MTVother-organs were more strongly correlated with the OS than the dichotomized forms, whereas the dichotomized forms of MTVneck-node, MTVlung, and MTVbone were more strongly correlated with OS than the continuous variables. The aMTV was thus expressed as 0.69 × dic(MTVneck-node) + 0.02 × MTVdistant-node + 1.05 × dic(MTVlung) + 1.58 × dic(MTVbone) + 0.01 × MTVother-organs, where dic(x) represents 0 or 1 based on the optimized cut-off. In the model evaluation using the validation group, aMTV was a significant predictor of OS with a higher c-index (0.7676) than cMTV (0.7218). CONCLUSION: In DTC patients with FDG-avid metastasis before I-131 therapy, all organ-based MTVs were significant predictors of prognosis. As the aMTV outperformed the cMTV for predicting prognoses, we recommend measuring the MTV on an organ basis.\n\nがん治療医・緩和ケアスタッフを対象としたターミナルケア態度尺度を用いた意識調査\n\n熊井 正貴, 加藤 信太郎, 小柳 遼, 敦賀 健吉, 伊藤 陽一, 山田 武宏, 川本 泰之, 武隈 洋, 菅原 満, 小松 嘉人\n\nPalliative Care Research 16 Suppl._Hokkaido S492 - S492 (NPO)日本緩和医療学会 2021年10月\n\nShigeru Yamaguchi, Kenji Hirata, Michinari Okamoto, Eku Shimosegawa, Jun Hatazawa, Ryuichi Hirayama, Naoki Kagawa, Haruhiko Kishima, Noboru Oriuchi, Masazumi Fujii, Kentaro Kobayashi, Hiroyuki Kobayashi, Shunsuke Terasaka, Ken-Ichi Nishijima, Yuji Kuge, Yoichi M Ito, Hiroshi Nishihara, Nagara Tamaki, Tohru Shiga\n\nCancer science 112 10 4246 - 4256 2021年10月\n\nWe conducted a prospective multicenter trial to compare the usefulness of 11 C-methionine (MET) and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) for identifying tumor recurrence. Patients with clinically suspected tumor recurrence after radiotherapy underwent both 11 C-MET and 18 F-FDG PET. When a lesion showed a visually detected uptake of either tracer, it was surgically resected for histopathological analysis. Patients with a lesion negative to both tracers were revaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 months after the PET studies. The primary outcome measure was the sensitivity of each tracer in cases with histopathologically confirmed recurrence, as determined by the McNemar test. Sixty-one cases were enrolled, and 56 cases could be evaluated. The 38 cases where the lesions showed uptake of either 11 C-MET or 18 F-FDG underwent surgery; 32 of these cases were confirmed to be subject to recurrence. Eighteen cases where the lesions showed uptake of neither tracer received follow-up MRI; the lesion size increased in one of these cases. Among the cases with histologically confirmed recurrence, the sensitivities of 11 C-MET PET and 18 F-FDG PET were 0.97 (32/33, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-0.99) and 0.48 (16/33, 95% CI: 0.33-0.65), respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P < .0001). The diagnostic accuracy of 11 C-MET PET was significantly better than that of 18 F-FDG PET (87.5% vs. 69.6%, P = .033). No examination-related adverse events were observed. The results of the study demonstrated that 11 C-MET PET was superior to 18 F-FDG PET for discriminating between tumor recurrence and radiation-induced necrosis.\n\nKikuko Taketomi, Yoichi M Ito, Eriko Tokunaga, Yuko O Hirano, Yuriko Fujino, Akiko Chishaki\n\nIndustrial health 59 6 371 - 382 2021年09月28日\n\nThis study aimed to develop a questionnaire on the quality of working life among female medical and healthcare professionals and examine its validity and reliability. The questionnaire was developed from an item pool drawing on the literature. The four trait scales included 40 items, covering female-specific stress in continuing a career, stress of lifestyle in maintaining personal values, job satisfaction and social support network. The questionnaire's validity and reliability were assessed using data from 1,784 female doctors, dentists, and nurses. Validity was examined using exploratory factor analysis on each trait for construct validity, and multitrait scaling analysis for convergent and discriminant validity. Reliability was tested using Cronbach's alpha for trait subscales and scales. Exploratory factor analysis on each trait was convergent. One trait derived three subscales, and another two. The remaining two traits were convergent for one factor. Multitrait scaling analysis showed that all scales and subscales were independent. The questionnaire was therefore internally consistent and had construct validity. Cronbach's alpha was 0.85 for the total and between 0.72 and 0.83 for the subscales. These results validate the four-trait combination questionnaire and suggest that it would be suitable for use in future research, perhaps in combination with other existing scales.\n\nHaruhiko Shiiya, Hideki Ujiie, Yasuhiro Hida, Tatsuya Kato, Kichizo Kaga, Satoru Wakasa, Eiki Kikuchi, Naofumi Shinagawa, Kazufumi Okada, Yoichi M Ito, Yoshihiro Matsuno\n\nThoracic cancer 12 21 2933 - 2942 2021年09月27日\n\nBACKGROUND: No useful tumor markers have been identified for the diagnosis of thymic carcinomas. Serum cytokeratin 19 fragment, measured using the CYFRA 21-1 immunoassay, is used as a tumor marker for squamous cell carcinomas in various malignant tumors. Here, we evaluated the value of CYFRA 21-1 in diagnosing thymic carcinoma. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 94 patients with pathological diagnoses of thymic carcinoma or thymoma (32 and 62 patients, respectively) who were referred to our departments between January 2000 and March 2019. Primary outcomes included tumor marker levels and their diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Patients with thymic carcinoma were significantly more likely to be male (thymic carcinoma, 68.8%; thymoma, 40.3%; p = 0.02), have an advanced TNM stage (p < 0.01), and a significantly higher CYFRA 21-1 level than those with thymoma (thymic carcinoma: median = 4.2 ng/ml; interquartile range [IQR] = 2.1-6.1 ng/ml vs. thymoma: median = 1.2 ng/ml; IQR = 0.9-1.7 ng/ml; p < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrated that the area under the curve for CYFRA 21-1 to distinguish thymic carcinoma from thymoma was 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.93; cutoff = 2.7 ng/ml; sensitivity = 68.8%; specificity = 95.2%). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that CYFRA 21-1 (odds ratio = 25.6; 95% CI: 4.6-141.6; p < 0.01) was an independent predictor for thymic carcinoma after adjusting for TNM stage.

METHODS: We retrospectively investigated differences in patient background data, laboratory data at the time of admission, and surgery-related data of 317 patients who underwent cervical laminoplasty and were divided into SBL (estimated blood loss [EBL] + drainage [D] ≥500 g) and non-SBL (EBL + D < 500 g) groups. To evaluate liver status, we used the fibrous 4 index and considered fibrous 4 index ≥1.85 as a representative phenotype for NAFLD with liver fibrosis. In addition, the risk factor for perioperative SBL was investigated using multiple logistic regression analysis, and the cutoff value was calculated. RESULTS: Incidence of perioperative SBL in cervical laminoplasty was 7.3% (23/317). Compared with the non-SBL group, the SBL group demonstrated significantly lower platelet count (PLT), lower aspartate aminotransferase, longer operation time, and greater number of opened laminae. According to multivariate analysis, lower PLT and a greater number of opened laminae were identified as significant risk factors for perioperative SBL. The cutoff value of PLT for predicting SBL was determined to be 16.7 × 104/μL using a receiver operating characteristic curve. The liver fibrosis group revealed significantly lower PLT and greater EBL + D than the non-liver fibrosis group. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytopenia is an independent predictor of perioperative SBL in cervical laminoplasty. Thus, patients with mild thrombocytopenia that may be associated with NAFLD must be carefully monitored to avoid perioperative SBL.\n\nYasuko Ogata, Kana Sato, Yoshimi Kodama, Noriko Morioka, Kikuko Taketomi, Yuki Yonekura, Kimiko Katsuyama, Sachiko Tanaka, Midori Nagano, Yoichi M Ito, Katsuya Kanda\n\nNursing open 8 5 2470 - 2487 2021年09月\n\nAIM: To investigate nurses' perceptions of their work environment and to investigate the relationships between variables measuring the work environment (WE) and nursing outcomes (NOs ).

However, intervertebral disc (IVD) defects may remain after discectomy, leading to inadequate tissue healing and predisposing patients to IVD degeneration. An acellular, bioresorbable, ultra-purified alginate (UPAL) gel (dMD-001) implantation system can be used to fill any IVD defects in order to prevent IVD degeneration after discectomy. This first-in-human pilot study aims to determine the feasibility, safety, and perceived patient response to a combined treatment involving discectomy and UPAL gel implantation for herniated NP. We designed a one-arm, double-centre, open-label, pilot trial. The study started in November 2018 and will run until a sample of 40 suitable participants is established. Patients aged 20-49 years, diagnosed with isolated lumbar IVD herniation and scheduled for discectomy represent suitable candidates. All eligible participants who provide informed consent undergo standard discectomy followed by UPAL gel implantation. The primary outcomes of the trial will be the feasibility and safety of the procedure. Secondary outcomes will include self-assessed clinical scores and magnetic resonance imaging-based measures of morphological and compositional quality of the IVD tissue.

Obesity has been suggested as a potential risk factor for the severity of OPLL. We aimed to investigate whether non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with OPLL severity. We assessed the severity of NAFLD by a liver-to-spleen (L/S) ratio on computed tomography (CT) scans of 85 symptomatic OPLL patients at a single institution in Japan. We also assessed the severity of OPLL by CT reconstruction sagittal and axial images. The prevalence of NAFLD in middle-aged patients (age < 70 years, n = 50) was 80.3%, which was 2.5-8 times higher than that in the general Japanese population (9-30%). The ossification index of the spinal ligaments increased in proportion to the severity of fatty liver. The L/S ratio was revealed as a significant risk factor associated with the total ossification index (standardized β: -0.40, 95% confidence interval - 54.34 to - 4.22). This study suggests the potential contribution of NAFLD to the progression of OPLL. The close association between NAFLD and OPLL demonstrated in this study warrants further study to elucidate the causal nature of this relationship.\n\nNobuhisa Ishiguro, Yoichi M Ito, Sumio Iwasaki, Miki Nagao, Hideki Kawamura, Shinichiro Kanai, Yoko Nukui, Koichi Tokuda, Takayuki Miyara, Hidetoshi Igari, Koichi Yamada, Hiroki Chikumi, Chiaki Sano, Ryuji Koike, Tetsuya Yagi, Nobuo Murakami\n\nBMC infectious diseases 21 1 887 - 887 2021年08月30日\n\nBACKGROUND: In a previous retrospective observational study, a 3-day regimen of oseltamivir as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for preventing transmission of influenza in wards was shown to be comparable to 7- to 10-day regimens provided index cases were immediately separated from close contacts. In order to confirm the efficacy of a 3-day regimen, we started to conduct a prospective, multi-center, single-arm trial. METHODS: This study is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study designed by the Sectional Meeting of Clinical Study, Japan Infection Prevention and Control Conference for National and Public University Hospitals. Index patients with influenza are prescribed a neuraminidase inhibitor and are discharged immediately or transferred to isolation rooms. The close contacts are given oseltamivir as 75 mg capsules once daily for adults or 2 mg/kg (maximum of 75 mg) once daily for children for 3 days as PEP. All close contacts are monitored for development of influenza for 7 days after starting PEP. DISCUSSION: A 3-day regimen of oseltamivir as PEP has advantages over 7- to 10-day regimens in terms of costs, medication adherence and adverse effects.

Both the mean NTCP and difference in the mean NTCP (ΔNTCP) between two treatment plans of different radiotherapy modalities were further evaluated and their CIs were assessed. Clinical data were retrospectively reviewed in 322 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 215) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n = 107) treated with photon therapy. Dose-volume histograms of normal liver were reduced to mean liver dose (MLD) based on the fraction size-adjusted equivalent uniform dose. The most predictive variables were used to build the model based on multivariable logistic regression analysis with bootstrapping. Internal validation was performed using the cross-validation leave-one-out method. Both the mean NTCP and the mean ΔNTCP with 95% CIs were calculated from computationally generated multivariate random sets of NTCP model parameters using variance-covariance matrix information. RILD occurred in 108/322 patients (33.5%). The NTCP model with three clinical and one dosimetric parameter (tumor type, Child-Pugh class, hepatitis infection status and MLD) was most predictive, with an area under the receiver operative characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.84). In eight clinical subgroups based on the three clinical parameters, both the mean NTCP and the mean ΔNTCP with 95% CIs were able to be estimated computationally. The multivariable NTCP model with the assessment of 95% CIs has potential to improve the reliability of the NTCP model-based approach to select the appropriate radiotherapy modality for each patient.\n\nAkiho Igarashi, Shono Ogasawara, Ryo Takagi, Kazufumi Okada, Yoichi M Ito, Hiroshi Hara, Tohru Hira\n\nThe Journal of nutrition 151 5 1320 - 1328 2021年05月11日\n\nBACKGROUND: Dietary calcium has been proposed to reduce appetite in human studies. Postprandial satiety is mainly controlled by gut hormones. However, the effect of calcium on appetite and the role of gut hormones remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether oral administration of calcium reduces food intake in rats and investigated the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats (8-12 wk old) were used after an overnight fastifffng. In a series of 2 trials with 1-wk interval between challenges, food intake was measured 0.5-24 h after oral gavage of a vehicle (saline containing 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose) as the control treatment, or the vehicle containing various calcium compounds [calcium chloride (CaCl2), calcium carbonate, calcium lactate, in a random order] at 150 mg calcium/kg dose. A conditional taste aversion test was conducted. In separate experiments, plasma calcium and gut hormone concentrations were measured 15 or 30 min after oral administration of the calcium compounds. In anesthetized rats, portal peptide-YY (PYY) concentrations were measured after intraluminal administration of a liquid meal with or without additional calcium. RESULTS: Oral CaCl2 reduced food intake acutely (30 min, ∼20%, P < 0.05) compared with control rats, without taste aversion. Plasma PYY concentration was higher (100%, P < 0.05) in CaCl2-preloaded rats than in control rats, 15 min after administration. In anesthetized rats, luminal meal + CaCl2 induced a 4-fold higher increase in plasma PYY than the control treatment did. Oral administration of a calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) agonist suppressed food intake (∼30%, P < 0.05), but CaCl2 and CaSR agonist did not suppress food intake under treatment with a PYY receptor antagonist. Furthermore, the CaSR antagonist attenuated the effect of CaCl2 on food intake. CONCLUSIONS: CaCl2 suppresses food intake partly by increasing CaSR-mediated PYY secretion in rats. Our findings could at least partially explain the satiating effect of calcium.\n\nKeiichiro Yoshinaga, Takashige Abe, Shozo Okamoto, Yuko Uchiyama, Osamu Manabe, Yoichi M Ito, Naomi Tamura, Natsue Ito, Naho Yoshioka, Komei Washino, Nobuo Shinohara, Nagara Tamaki, Tohru Shiga\n\nJournal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine 62 5 685 - 694 2021年05月10日\n\n131I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) radiotherapy has shown some survival benefits in metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). European Association of Nuclear Medicine clinical guidelines for 131I-MIBG radiotherapy suggest a repeated treatment protocol, although none currently exists. The existing single-high-dose 131I-MIBG radiotherapy (444 MBq/kg) has been shown to have some benefits for patients with metastatic NETs. However, this protocol increases adverse effects and requires alternative therapeutic approaches. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of repeated 131I-MIBG therapy on tumor size and tumor metabolic response in patients with metastatic NETs. Methods: Eleven patients with metastatic NETs (aged 49.2 ± 16.3 y) prospectively received repeated 5,550-MBq doses of 131I-MIBG therapy at 6-mo intervals. In total, 31 treatments were performed. The mean number of treatments was 2.8 ± 0.4, and the cumulative 131I-MIBG dose was 15,640.9 ± 2,245.1 MBq (286.01 MBq/kg). Tumor response was observed by CT and 18F-FDG PET or by 18F-FDG PET/CT before and 3-6 mo after the final 131I-MIBG treatment. Results: On the basis of the CT findings with RECIST, 3 patients showed a partial response and 6 patients showed stable disease. The remaining 2 patients showed progressive disease. Although there were 2 progressive-disease patients, analysis of all patients showed no increase in summed length diameter (median, 228.7 mm [interquartile range (IQR), 37.0-336.0 mm] to 171.0 mm [IQR, 38.0-270.0 mm]; P = 0.563). In tumor region-based analysis with partial-response and stable-disease patients (n = 9), 131I-MIBG therapy significantly reduced tumor diameter (79 lesions; median, 16 mm [IQR, 12-22 mm] to 11 mm [IQR, 6-16 mm]; P < 0.001). Among 5 patients with hypertension, there was a strong trend toward systolic blood pressure reduction (P = 0.058), and diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced (P = 0.006). Conclusion: Eighty-two percent of metastatic NET patients effectively achieved inhibition of disease progression, with reduced tumor size and reduced metabolic activity, through repeated 131I-MIBG therapy. Therefore, this relatively short-term repeated 131I-MIBG treatment may have potential as one option in the therapeutic protocol for metastatic NETs. Larger prospective studies with control groups are warranted.\n\nAika Miya, Akinobu Nakamura, Takahisa Handa, Hiroshi Nomoto, Hiraku Kameda, Kyu Yong Cho, So Nagai, Yoichi M Ito, Hideaki Miyoshi, Tatsuya Atsumi\n\nScientific reports 11 1 9057 - 9057 2021年04月27日\n\nThe contribution of endogenous insulin secretion to glycemic variability (GV) may differ between patients with impaired insulin secretion and those with preserved secretion. Our objective was to determine the linearity of the relationship between fasting C-peptide (CPR) as a marker of endogenous insulin secretion and GV in type 2 diabetes (T2DM), regardless of the type of antidiabetic treatment. We conducted a prospective observational study using continuous glucose monitoring obtained from 284 Japanese outpatients with T2DM with various HbA1c values and antidiabetic treatment. We constructed a prediction curve of base-line CPR versus coefficient of variation (CV) and identified the clinical factors associated with CV using multiple regression analysis. Fasting CPR showed a significant negative log-linear relationship with CV (P < 0.0001), and the latter being strikingly high in the low-CPR group. The multiple regression analysis showed that low CPR was an independent predictor of high CV (P < 0.0001). The significant correlations were sustained in both patients with/without insulin treatment. The contribution of endogenous insulin secretion to GV depends on the extent of insulin secretion impairment. Fasting CPR may represent a useful indicator of GV instability in T2DM.\n\nNaomi Tamura, Tomoyuki Hanaoka, Kumiko Ito, Atsuko Araki, Chihiro Miyashita, Sachiko Ito, Sumitaka Kobayashi, Yoichi Ito, Hisanori Minakami, Kazutoshi Cho, Toshiaki Endo, Tsuyoshi Baba, Kazuo Sengoku, Toshinobu Miyamoto, Katsuhiko Ogasawara, Reiko Kishi\n\nMaternal and Child Health Journal 25 4 645 - 655 2021年04月\n\nOsamu Honmou, Toshihiko Yamashita, Tomonori Morita, Tsutomu Oshigiri, Ryosuke Hirota, Satoshi Iyama, Junji Kato, Yuichi Sasaki, Sumio Ishiai, Yoichi M Ito, Ai Namioka, Takahiro Namioka, Masahito Nakazaki, Yuko Kataoka-Sasaki, Rie Onodera, Shinichi Oka, Masanori Sasaki, Stephen G Waxman, Jeffery D Kocsis\n\nClinical neurology and neurosurgery 203 106565 - 106565 2021年04月\n\nBACKGROUND: Although spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major cause of disability, current therapeutic options remain limited. Recent progress in cellular therapy with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has provided improved function in animal models of SCI. We investigated the safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of MSCs for SCI patients and assessed functional status after MSC infusion. METHODS: In this phase 2 study of intravenous infusion of autologous MSCs cultured in auto-serum, a single infusion of MSCs under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) production was delivered in 13 SCI patients. In addition to assessing feasibility and safety, neurological function was assessed using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (ASIA), International Standards for Neurological and Functional Classification of Spinal Cord (ISCSCI-92). Ability of daily living was assessed using Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM-III). The study protocol was based on advice provided by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan. The trial was registered with the Japan Medical Association (JMA-IIA00154). RESULTS: No serious adverse events were associated with MSC injection. There was neurologic improvement based on ASIA grade in 12 of the 13 patients at six months post-MSC infusion. Five of six patients classified as ASIA A prior to MSC infusion improved to ASIA B (3/6) or ASIA C (2/6), two ASIA B patients improved to ASIA C (1/2) or ASIA D (1/2), five ASIA C patients improved and reached a functional status of ASIA D (5/5). Notably, improvement from ASIA C to ASIA D was observed one day following MSC infusion for all five patients. Assessment of both ISCSCI-92, SCIM-III also demonstrated functional improvements at six months after MSC infusion, compared to the scores prior to MSC infusion in all patients. CONCLUSION: While we emphasize that this study was unblinded, and does not exclude placebo effects or a contribution of endogenous recovery or observer bias, our observations provide evidence supporting the feasibility, safety and functional improvements of infused MSCs into patients with SCI.\n\n大澤 崇宏, 安部 崇重, 松本 隆児, 菊地 央, 山田 修平, 古御堂 純, 宮田 遥, 村井 祥代, 伊藤 陽一, 篠原 信雄\n\n泌尿器外科 34 3 321 - 321 医学図書出版(株) 2021年03月\n\nTakahiro Osawa, John T.

HRQOL of the four groups of patients (native bladder without intravesical therapy, native bladder with intravesical therapy, cystectomy with ileal conduit, and cystectomy with neobladder) were assessed. Secondly, we compared the Japanese with the American cohort (n = 315) from the original BCI paper. After adjusting for age and gender, the differences in each BCI subdomain score was analyzed.RESULTS: Among Japanese patients, the urinary domain function score was significantly lower among the cystectomy with neobladder group, compared to the cystectomy with ileal conduit group (p < 0. 01). Despite this, the urinary bother was comparable between the two groups. Although there were apparent differences between Japanese and American patients, there were few differences in Urinary and Bowel HRQOL. In three of the four treatment groups (other than native bladder with intravesical therapy), Japanese patients were more likely than Americans to report poor sexual function (p < 0.05). However, Japanese patients were less likely than Americans to be bothered by their lower sexual function, regardless of treatment (p <0.05).CONCLUSIONS: HRQOL outcomes following treatment of bladder cancer in Japan are comparable to those in the USA, except for sexual functioning and sexual bother. The BCI can be used for cross-cultural assessments of HRQOL in bladder cancer patients.\n\nTakahiro Osawa, John T Wei, Takashige Abe, Michitaka Honda, Shuhei Yamada, Jun Furumido, Hiroshi Kikuchi, Ryuji Matsumoto, Kazushi Hirakawa, Yasuyuki Sato, Yoshihiro Sasaki, Toru Harabayashi, Norikata Takada, Keita Minami, Hiroshi Tanaka, Ken Morita, Akira Kashiwagi, Naoto Miyajima, Tomoshige Akino, Sachiyo Murai, Yoichi M Ito, Shunichi Fukuhara, Katsuhiko Ogasawara, Nobuo Shinohara\n\nInternational journal of clinical oncology 25 12 2090 - 2098 2020年12月\n\nINTRODUCTION: We validated a Japanese version of the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI) as a tool for measuring health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in bladder cancer patients treated with various surgical procedures. METHODS: The reliability and validity of the Japanese BCI were examined in 397 Japanese patients with bladder cancer via cross-sectional analysis. The patients simultaneously completed the Short Form (SF)-12, EQ-5D, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General and Bladder (FACT-G and FACT-BL). The differences in BCI subscales among various treatment groups were analyzed. RESULTS: This study involved 397 patients (301 males and 96 females), with a mean age of 70 years and a median disease duration of 29 months (IQR: 12-66 months). Of these patients, 221 underwent transurethral resection of a bladder tumor, and 176 patients underwent radical cystectomy (ileal conduit: 101 patients, ileal neobladder: 49, and ureterostomy: 26). Cronbach's alpha coefficient was ≥ 0.78 for all subscales, except the bowel bother subscale. Despite moderate correlations being detected between the function and bother score in urinary and bowel domains, the sexual function score was inversely correlated with the sexual bother score (r = - 0.19). A missing value percentage of > 15% was associated with old age (p < 0.05). The mean domain scores differed significantly among distinct clinically relevant treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although revisions are needed to make it easier for elderly patients to comprehend, we confirmed the reliability and validity of the Japanese BCI. The Japanese BCI could be used for cross-cultural assessments of HRQOL in bladder cancer patients.\n\nTakaaki Yoshimura, Shinichi Shimizu, Takayuki Hashimoto, Kentaro Nishioka, Norio Katoh, Hiroshi Taguchi, Koichi Yasuda, Taeko Matsuura, Seishin Takao, Masaya Tamura, Sodai Tanaka, Yoichi M Ito, Yuto Matsuo, Hiroshi Tamura, Kenji Horita, Kikuo Umegaki, Hiroki Shirato\n\nJournal of applied clinical medical physics 21 12 10 - 19 2020年12月\n\nA synchrotron-based real-time image gated spot-scanning proton beam therapy (RGPT) system with inserted fiducial markers can irradiate a moving tumor with high accuracy. As gated treatments increase the beam delivery time, this study aimed to investigate the frequency of intra-field adjustments corresponding to the baseline shift or drift and the beam delivery efficiency of a synchrotron-based RGPT system. Data from 118 patients corresponding to 127 treatment plans and 2810 sessions between October 2016 and March 2019 were collected. We quantitatively analyzed the proton beam delivery time, the difference between the ideal beam delivery time based on a simulated synchrotron magnetic excitation pattern and the actual treatment beam delivery time, frequency corresponding to the baseline shift or drift, and the gating efficiency of the synchrotron-based RGPT system according to the proton beam delivery machine log data. The mean actual beam delivery time was 7.1 min, and the simulated beam delivery time in an ideal environment with the same treatment plan was 2.9 min. The average difference between the actual and simulated beam delivery time per session was 4.3 min. The average frequency of intra-field adjustments corresponding to baseline shift or drift and beam delivery efficiency were 21.7% and 61.8%, respectively. Based on our clinical experience with a synchrotron-based RGPT system, we determined the frequency corresponding to baseline shift or drift and the beam delivery efficiency using the beam delivery machine log data. To maintain treatment accuracy within ± 2.0 mm, intra-field adjustments corresponding to baseline shift or drift were required in approximately 20% of cases. Further improvements in beam delivery efficiency may be realized by shortening the beam delivery time.\n\nKentaro Kawamura, Shinobu Fukumura, Koki Nikaido, Nobutada Tachi, Naoki Kozuka, Tsugumi Seino, Kingya Hatakeyama, Mitsuru Mori, Yoichi M Ito, Akiyoshi Takami, Shiro Hinotsu, Atsushi Kuno, Yukihiko Kaw"
