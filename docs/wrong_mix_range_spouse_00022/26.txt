Singer-actress Charlene Choi, also known as 'Ah Sa' from Hong Kong pop duo "Twins", appeared on Sunday, Dec. 14, on Shanghai-based Dragon TV's "Wu Lin Da Hui", a popular weekend entertaining ballroom dance competition program that hooks huge nationwide audience.

Other stars taking part were veteran actor Eric Tsang Chi-Wai, actress Carmen Lee Ruo Tong and singer Landy Wen Lan. Ah Sa performed an Indian style dance against the music "Can't Take My Eyes off You".

Asked how things were going with her partner Gillian Chung, who hid from the public after the nude photo scandal earlier this year, Ah Sa smiled. She commented that Gillian is resting and the feelings of pressure have subsided.

Ah Sa confirmed her close friendship with Gillian Chung but did not disclose when their group will re-appear again.

Rumours say Twins will disband as a result of the scandal, but Ah Sa emphasized Gillian's resilience. She said 'Twins' still has its original spirit, and the band is unsinkable.
