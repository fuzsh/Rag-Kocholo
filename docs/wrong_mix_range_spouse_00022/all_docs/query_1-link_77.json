Shu Qi and Charlene Choi wouldn't be bad, either. However, five years ago I would have immediately chosen Charlie Young for the role. And thanks to everyone who voted for my sister. top Poll #13: Which young actress will have the longest career? - Posted November 22nd, 2002\n\nTotal votes: 209\n\nKarena Lam (July Rhapsody) (53) 25%\n\nAngelica Lee (The Eye) (34) 16%\n\nCharlene Choi (Twin #1) (17) 8%\n\nJoey Yung (Feel 100% 2) (16) 8%\n\nMy Sister (16) 8%\n\nGillian Chung (Twin #2) (14) 7%\n\nCandy Lo (Time and Tide) (14) 7%\n\nWinona Ryder (Court TV) (11) 5%\n\nCherrie Ying (Fat Choi Spirit) (10) 5%\n\nZeny Kwok (Glass Tears) (7) 3%\n\nNiki Chow (Feel 100% 2) (6) 3%\n\nLee San-San (The Stewardess) (4) 2%\n\nJo Koo (Visible Secret 2) (3) 1%\n\nRain Li (If U Care...)

I would rank Karena Lam, Charlene Choi, Candy Lo and Jo Koo right below her. Still, it's amazing that so many people chose Karena Lam; I expected this poll to have a much more evenly distributed turnout. However, Cathy Tsui getting only one vote is fine by me.\n\ntop Poll #12: What should Hong Kong do to improve their films? - Posted November 15th, 2002\n\nTotal votes: 195\n\nSend young filmmakers to school in other countries. (11) 6%\n\nImport talent from other countries. (7) 4%\n\nHave Johnnie To direct everything. (10) 5%\n\nStart a serious film school program in Hong Kong. (37) 19%\n\nHave filmmakers apprentice in countries with thriving film industries, like the United States, Korea or India. (8) 4%\n\nEducate the average filmgoer to appreciate and support film as a medium. (15) 8%\n\nMake scriptwriting a required course for gradeschoolers. (11) 6%\n\nBan the following people: Wong Jing, Michael Wong and Ekin Cheng. (17) 9%\n\nAll of the above. (31) 16%\n\nThere's nothing wrong with Hong Kong film. (48) 25%\n\nCommentary: A quarter of the people who voted suggested that there was nothing wrong with Hong Kong film. While I would like to agree, I simply can't. This year has been the weakest Hong Kong Cinema year in a while, and last year was pretty bad. The top films were probably A Chinese Odyssey 2002, The Eye, and Three: Going Home, and after that there's a substantial drop-off in quality. Granted, I have yet to see Hero, Infernal Affairs, Just One Look or Hollywood Hong Kong, but a Top 10 list this year would still likely include My Left Eye Sees Ghosts and Love Undercover, which wouldn't crack the Top 20 in other years. Hopefully something can be done, and banning Wong Jing, Michael Wong and Ekin Cheng is really not the solution.\n\ntop Poll #11: Who is your favorite action director? - Posted November 4th, 2002\n\nTotal votes: 206\n\nJackie Chan (44) 21%\n\nYuen Woo-Ping (42) 20%\n\nEkin Cheng (35) 17%\n\nSammo Hung Kam-Bo (29) 14%\n\nChing Siu-Tung (21) 10%\n\nDonnie Yen Ji-Dan (14) 7%\n\nCorey Yuen Kwai (12) 6%\n\nPhillip Kwok (4) 2%\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme (3) 1%\n\nStephen Tung Wai (2) 1%\n\nMa Yuk-Sing (0) 0%\n\nCommentary: Nobody voted for Ma Yuk-Sing; poor guy. Not surprisingly, Jackie Chan took first, though I fully expected Yuen Woo-Ping to win thanks to The Matrix. EKIN CHENG IN THIRD PLACE??? What is this world coming to? Ekin Cheng is not an action director. It's even debatable whether or not he's an actor. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but how can he be a better action director than Sammo Hung? On another note, I assume the three people who voted for Jean-Claude Van Damme have already reserved their spots in Hell.\n\ntop\n\nPoll #10: What is your favorite Milky Way production? - Posted November 4th, 2002 Total votes: 214\n\nRunning Out of Time (50) 23%\n\nNeeding You (32) 15%\n\nFulltime Killer (21) 10%\n\nThe Mission (20) 9%\n\nFat Choi Spirit (12) 6%\n\nThe Longest Nite (12) 6%\n\nLove on a Diet (11) 5%\n\nMy Left Eye Sees Ghosts (10) 5%\n\nA Hero Never Dies (8) 4%\n\nExpect the Unexpected (7) 3%\n\nRunning Out of Time 2 (7) 3%\n\nToo Many Ways to be No. 1 (6) 3%\n\nWu Yen (5) 2%\n\nHelp!!!

Should each review have a rating/grade? - Posted July 1st, 2002\n\nTotal votes: 110\n\nYes, a rating or grade would be good. (59) 54%\n\nNo. The \"skinny\" on each review is enough. (37) 34%\n\nWho cares? I only look at the pictures. (9) 8%\n\nYes, but I prefer the Roger Ebert \"thumb\" method. (3) 3%\n\nI only like text reviews. Get rid of everything else. (2) 2%\n\nCommentary: This poll wasn't much of a mystery. As expected, the whole ratings thing won out, and my response to that can be found in this edition of Life with Kozo. However, I would like to thank all those who voted for the \"skinny\" on each review is enough (37 votes). I assume this means that literacy is not an antiquated concept.\n\ntop\n\nPoll #5: Why the heck do you keep watching Hong Kong movies? - Posted June 24th, 2002\n\nTotal votes: 449\n\nHong Kong movies rock! (61) 14%\n\nI love action! (52) 12%\n\nThe girls are hot! (52) 12%\n\nWhile HK films are not as good as they used to be,\n\nI will support them in the hope that they will improve.

(27) 6%\n\nTwo words: Ekin Cheng. (23) 5%\n\nWong Jing's comedy stylings are quite beguiling. (22) 5%\n\nThe wondrous existentialism. (19) 4%\n\nI have no other choice. (5) 1%\n\nNone of the above. (4) 1%\n\nMy roommate only rents HK flicks and I'm too cheap to rent my own movies. (2) 0%\n\nCommentary: If anything can be learned from this wacky reader poll, it's this: more men read this site than women. 52 votes state that the women are hot, whereas 30 claim the guys are hot. That's assuming that all voters are heterosexual, which would be bad form. In that case this poll teaches us nothing, except that Sammi Cheng and Miriam Yeung rule the roost, and Ekin Cheng is the midst of a serious career backslide. Also, action is still tops though very few action films are made anymore. And are there really two people out there who are too cheap to rent their own movies, and only watch HK flicks because their roomates do? My condolences.\n\ntop\n\nPoll #4: What would you like to see on LoveHKFilm.com? - Posted June 17th, 2002\n\nTotal votes: 182\n\nSome more reviews would be nice...

So...More Reviews (19%) came in first. Yay. Despite that winning, I (and my fellow reviewers) can only write so much. Who cares as long as it's free (14%): an unsurprisingly popular choice. Rest assured, that is the current plan. A Forum (14%): easily the most desirable choice for the Webmaster. And one that will definitely happen - should this site hang around. More Screen Captures (13%): when there's more web space. More pictures of the Twins (10%): here and done! Online chat with Ekin Cheng (9%): uh...love to, but I don't know him. And besides, he'd probably want to beat me up. More Jokes (9%): even if this choice had received zero votes, more snarky stuff would still be in the offing. Know this: LoveHKFilm.com = jokes. And Hong Kong Cinema. An online store (6%): in all likelihood, no. That is, unless someone tenders an offer I simply cannot refuse. Giveaways (5%): A surprisingly low turnout, which is great because I don't have the necessary support. Yet. Less Jokes (0%): I will readily bow to the popular demand of the readers.\n\ntop\n\nPoll #3.1: Where do you hail from? - Posted June 10th, 2002\n\nTotal votes: 96\n\nThe United States (42) 44%\n\nOther North America (15) 16%\n\nEurope (14) 15%\n\nAsia (7) 7%\n\nAustralia (7) 7%\n\nA galaxy far, far away...

Of course, the biggest revelation in this poll is the number of votes. Ninety-six? Apparently nobody visits this site, which would make it more successful than my former job's web site.\n\ntop\n\nPoll #3: How do you watch Hong Kong movies? - Posted June 10th, 2002\n\nTotal Votes: 113\n\nDVDs - I buy them. (49) 43%\n\nVCDs - I buy them. (20) 18%\n\nBootleg VCDs - I'm a criminal. (18) 16%\n\nTapes - I rent them. (11) 10%\n\nDVDs/VCDs - I rent them. (10) 9%\n\nI only watch them in the theater. (3) 3%\n\nI catch them at a friend's house. (2) 2%\n\nI only watch Miramax releases. (0) 0%\n\nCommentary: As expected, DVDs won big time. What's surprising is that Bootleg VCDs came in third. Was everyone who voted for that option joking? If not, I have this to say: what are you people thinking? If Hong Kong films continue to be watched through only pirated means, then sooner or later the only bootleg VCDs you'll be able to get will be for Star Wars Episode 2. And who the hell wants to watch that movie? Thankfully, nobody said that they only watched Miramax releases.\n\ntop\n\nPoll #2: What type of Hong Kong movies do you like best? - Posted June 3rd, 2002\n\nTotal votes: 281\n\nCrazy Hong Kong comedies (54) 19%\n\nThree words: Martial arts movies (52) 19%\n\nUrban romantic comedies (47) 17%\n\nCrime action dramas (34) 12%\n\nI like everything! (30) 11%\n\nAnything with Ekin Cheng (19) 7%\n\nExistential art films (15) 5%\n\nCategory III schlock (14) 5%\n\nHorror films (14) 5%\n\nI prefer the fine work of Jerry Bruckheimer (2) 1%\n\nAnalysis: Martial Arts (19%) was predictably in the Top 2, with Hong Kong's current fave - Urban Romantic Comedies (17%) - ending up at the Number 3 slot. Which leaves this question: how did Crazy Hong Kong Comedies (19%, 2 more votes than Martial Arts) end up in Number One? Either Wong Jing has lots of fans, or Crazy Comedy has tickled everyone out there at one time or another. What's disappointing is the poor showing for Existential Art Films (7%), which bodes ill for Wong Kar-Wai. Jerry Bruckheimer is right where he belongs, but how did two people vote for him? I take it those two people were waiting in line for Bad Company this past weekend.\n\ntop\n\nPoll #1: How many Hong Kong movies have you watched? - Posted May 27th, 2002\n\nTotal votes: 145\n\nMore than 100 (39 votes) 27%\n\nI lost count many moons ago (38 votes) 26%\n\nMore than 10 (29 votes) 20%\n\nMore than 500 (14 votes) 10%\n\nMore than 300 (12 votes) 8%\n\nMore than 1000 (9 votes) 6%\n\nLess than 10 (2 votes) 1%\n\nZero.
