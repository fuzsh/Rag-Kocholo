        "text": "15 Aug â€“ Charlene Choi has recently confirmed rumours that she and long-time boyfriend Anthony Shi have called it quits on their relationship.\n\nAs reported on Mingpao, the singer shared as much with the media recently, after rumours circulated that the businessman had been cheating on her with a \"Miss C\", whom many believed to be the third runner-up of Miss Hong Kong 2022, Joey Leung.\n\n\"We have been separated for some time now,\" said Charlene when asked about it. \"There was no third-party involvement. The breakup was mutual.\"\n\nThe singer admitted that there were some issues that led to the breakup, but that she found no reason to share it with the public.\n\nCharlene started dating Anthony, known to many as \"the mahjong prince\", in 2017. It is one of her longest relationships after William Chan, of whom she was with for five years before they broke up."
