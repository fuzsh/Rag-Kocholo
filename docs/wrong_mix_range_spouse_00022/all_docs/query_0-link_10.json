The film is a sequel to The Twins Effect (2003), but has a completely different story from the first film. It starred Charlene Choi and Gillian Chung of Cantopop duo Twins in the leading roles. Co-stars include Donnie Yen, Daniel Wu, Edison Chen, Wilson Chen, Tony Leung Ka-fai, Qu Ying, Fan Bingbing and Jim Chim. Jackie Chan also makes a cameo appearance, along with his son Jaycee Chan in his acting debut. The film's original English working title was The Huadu Chronicles: Blade of the Rose and its US DVD release title is Blade of Kings.\n\nThe film is set in Flower Capital, a land ruled by an evil queen (Qu Ying) who started hating men after her lover, High Priest Wei Liao (Daniel Wu), betrayed her. All men in the kingdom are slaves to women. However, a prophecy foretells that one day, the Star of Rex will find and wield a mythic sword, rise to power, overthrow the queen, and restore the balance of the two sexes.\n\nAt the start of the movie, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (Donnie Yen), a master swordsman who has made it his quest to overthrow the queen's regime, has commissioned Peachy (Edison Chen) to steal for him a certain engraved stone from the queen's palace. Peachy is successful, but the queen's soldiers and spies pursue him. Before the stone can be recaptured, it comes into the possession of Peachy's two friends Charcoal Head (Jaycee Chan) and Blockhead (Bolin Chen), who like Peachy earn a humble living by street-performing in a troupe led by their adoptive father, Blackwood.\n\nThe two set out to deliver the stone to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, along the way discovering the stone is actually a map, which they assume will lead them to riches. Before they can meet Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, they are intercepted by two lovely, but lethal, female warriors, Spring (Charlene Choi) and Blue Bird (Gillian Chung), each of whom is pursuing the pair for different reasons. The four agree to follow the map together, eventually learning that the map leads to the mythic sword and that either Charcoal Head or Blockhead is the Star of Rex. The journey takes them through dangerous terrain, culminating in an encounter with the Lord of Armour (Jackie Chan), who guards the way to the sword.\n\nEven as the four make their way toward the sword, the queen is preparing for their destruction, using her army and her powerful magic. A final battle will decide the fate of the land.\n\nDonnie Yen as General Lone\n\nJaycee Chan as Charcoal Head / Star of Rex\n\nCharlene Choi as Spring / 13th Master\n\nGillian Chung as Blue Bird\n\nBolin Chen as Blockhead\n\nTony Leung Ka-fai as Master Blackwood\n\nQu Ying as the Evil Queen\n\nFan Bingbing as Red Vulture\n\nJackie Chan as General Wai Shing / Lord of Armour (cameo appearance)\n\nDaniel Wu as High Priest Wei Liao (special appearance)\n\nEdison Chen as Peachy (guest appearance)\n\nJim Chim as Palupa\n\nXie Jingjing as Marshall Edo Bowman\n\nSteven Cheung as a slave\n\nKenny Kwan as a slave\n\nSam Chan as a slave\n\nKam Siu-wai as a slave\n\nMou Kit as a slave\n\nLeung Yuet-wan as a slave buyer\n\nLee Nga as the palace guard commander"
