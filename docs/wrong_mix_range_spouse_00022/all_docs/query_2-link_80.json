In Part Five her co-star was Vincent Chiu, who replaced Jet Li as Wong Fei Hung.\n\nRosamund Kwan - also known as Kwan Chi-lam - was born in Hong Kong to parents who were both in the acting industry. Rosamund's first movie debut was in the 1982 \"The Head Hunter\", and she has appeared in over 50 movies. Fans of Jackie Chan may have seen her in \"Armour of God\" and \"Project A Part 2\". In 2007 she announced her retirement from the acting industry.\n\n2. Who plays Jet Li's love interest in \"Fong Sai Yuk\" (\"The Legend\")?\n\nAnswer: Michelle Reis\n\nMichelle Reis - otherwise known as Lee Ka-yan - was born on 20 June, 1970 to a Portuguese father and a Chinese mother. Michelle grew up in Hong Kong, and in 1988 won the Miss Hong Kong beauty pageant, which propelled her to stardom. She has appeared in over 30 movies since debuting in the 1990 movie \"A Chinese Ghost Story 2\".\n\nMichelle Reis also starred in \"Swordsman 2\" with Jet Li.\n\nShe is also known to be one of Hong Kong's most beautiful actresses.\n\n3. Which actress did NOT appear in Jet Li's \"The Evil Cult\"? This movie was based on Jin Yong's \"The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber\" novel.\n\nAnswer: Michelle Yeoh\n\n\"The Evil Cult\" ended on a cliffhanger, and there was supposed to be a sequel in the planning, but due to poor box office returns it was canned.\n\nMichelle Yeoh was also in Jet Li's \"Tai Chi Master\" (\"The Twin Warriors\"), and had a brief cameo in \"Fearless\".\n\nShe is probably most famous for her roles in the James bond movie \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" with Pierce Brosnan, and with Chow Yun-Fat in \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\".\n\n4. Which actress plays the \"Invincible East\", aka Asia the Invincible, aka Dong Fong Bu Bai, in \"The Swordsman 2\" (\"Legend of the Swordsman\")?\n\nAnswer: Brigitte Lin\n\nBrigitte Lin is a Taiwanese actress famous for her roles in \"Chungking Express\", \"Ashes of Time\", and \"Police Story\". She reprises her role as Invincible East in \"Swordsman 3: The East is Red\".\n\nBoth \"Swordsman 1\" and \"Swordsman 2\" were based on a novel called \"The Smiling, Proud Wanderer\" by renowned Chinese author Jin Yong.\n\n5. In \"Fong Sai Yuk 2\" (\"The Legend 2\"), Jet Li meets a female admirer who wishes to be his second wife. Which Hong Kong actress plays this love interest? (Hint - she married Hong Kong actor Sean Lau Ching Wan in 1998).\n\nAnswer: Amy Kwok\n\nAmy Kwok Oi-Ming won the 1991 Miss Hong Kong pageant contest and subsequently appeared in many TVB television dramas during the 1990s. She married Hong Kong actor Sean Lau Ching-Wan in 1998. Allegedly they fell in love when filming the 1992 TV drama \"The Greed of Man\", which also starred Hong Kong veteran actor Adam Cheng, and singer/actress Vivian Chow.\n\n6. \"Dr Wai in The Scriptures with No Words\" had two versions - the normal Hong Kong edit, and the international edit which cut out the modern scenes in the movie. A Hong Kong actress featured prominently in the Hong Kong edit - who is she?\n\nAnswer: Charlie Young\n\nWestern distributors thought the Hong Kong edit of the movie was too confusing, so they cut out the modern scenes in the movie, which was a disastrous move because it made the movie even more confusing. The modern scenes dictated the period scenes because it was a story within a story. Without the modern scenes explaining what was going on, all you had was a jumbled mess of a plot. No wonder it was poorly received in the West.\n\nCatch the Hong Kong version and you'll find a better movie.\n\nCharlie Young - aka Charlie Yeung Choi-ne - began her career in the entertainment business in 1992 when she was signed by a record company. With her gorgeous looks, she was destined to be one of Hong Kong's greatest actresses/singers, but her pop career floundered. However, she appeared in some of the best Hong Kong movies such as \"The Lovers\", \"Ashes of Time\", and \"Fallen Angels\".\n\nIn 1997 she announced she was retiring from the industry, but made a comeback in 2004 alongside Jackie Chan in \"The New Police Story\".\n\n7. \"Hitman\" (\"Contract Killer\") is one of Jet Li's lesser known Hong Kong movies, starring Simon Yam, Eric Tsang and which other famous Hong Kong actress/singer?\n\nAnswer: Gigi Leung\n\n\"Hitman\" was a very underrated movie, and it deserves a lot of praise. In my opinion it is a much better movie than some of Jet Li's other works. There's humour, action, and some good acting. Whatever you do, watch it in its native Cantonese soundtrack with English subs.\n\nGigi Leung Wing-kei is one of Hong Kong's most famous celebrities with careers in both the acting and singing industries. She has appeared in over 40 movies since her debut in 1995's \"Mack the Knife\". Some of her best movies are \"Feel 100%\", \"A True Mob Story\", \"La Brassiere\", \"Driving Miss Wealthy\" and \"Tempting Heart\".\n\nShe married her Spanish boyfriend Sergios Crespo Gutes in 2011.\n\n8. \"Flying Swords of Dragon Gate\" is a sequel to the classic movie \"Dragon Inn\". Which Mainland China actress plays Jet Li's love interest?\n\nAnswer: Zhou Xun\n\n\"Flying Swords of Dragon Gate\" was the first martial arts movie to be shot entirely in 3-D by veteran director Tsui Hark. The lead role was originally given to Donnie Yen, who turned down the role, and it was then offered to Jet Li, who had collaborated with Tsui Hark on many movies.\n\nZhou Xun is a Chinese actress with over 30 movie appearances since her debut in the 1991 movie \"Old Grave\". She was born in Zhejiang, China on 18 October 1974.\n\nIn the West, she is probably most recognizable for her appearance in the Wachowski's \"Cloud Atlas\".\n\nShe has won many film awards and is known to be one of the \"Four Dan Actresses\" in China. This is a term given by the Chinese media to the four most bankable mainland actresses in the early 2000s. The other three actresses are Zhao Wei, Zhang Ziyi and Xu Jinglei.\n\n9.

It broke box office records in Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nIn the 2014 \"Romance of the Condor Heroes\" television drama series, she played the famous character Xiaolongnu (Little Dragon Girl), but her portrayal of the beloved character was met with extreme criticism from fans worldwide.\n\n10.
