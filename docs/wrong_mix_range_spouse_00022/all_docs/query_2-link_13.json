        "text": "Taiwan actress\n\nCharlie Yeung Choi-Nei (born 23 May 1974), is a Hong Kong actress. She was first noticed after appearing in a commercial with Aaron Kwok. Since then she has participated in the music videos of artists such as Hacken Lee, Jacky Cheung and made a number of films, most famously with Tsui Hark (The Lovers, Love in the Time of Twilight, Seven Swords) and Wong Kar-wai. She retired her career in 1997, but has since returned in 2004 in New Police Story.\n\nIn 1992, she signed on as a singer with EMI (Hong Kong). After releasing a couple of albums with some success (she won the TVB Jade Solid Gold (1993)'s Gold Award of \"The Best New Female Singer\"), she made her feature-film debut in Wong Kar-wai’s arthouse martial arts film Ashes of Time alongside superstars such as Leslie Cheung, Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Brigitte Lin.\n\nIn 1994, she made her first collaboration with director Tsui Hark in the film The Lovers (梁祝). Yeung was cast as the female lead, Zhu Yingtai opposite Nicky Wu's Liang Shanbo. Her performance received widespread critical acclaim, rising Yeung to stardom. The film today has been hailed as Yeung's most representative work to date.\n\nHowever, in 1997 she retired from the industry to start an image consultant business with her Singaporean lawyer-boyfriend in Malaysia.\n\nIn 2004, she made her comeback as the lead actress in Jackie Chan's New Police Story. Following that, she collaborated once again with Tsui Hark in the martial arts movie Seven Swords and starred alongside Andy Lau in the love movie All About Love. She later co-starred in the film After This Our Exile opposite Aaron Kwok. She has made plans to appear in a sequel to Seven Swords.\n\nYeung met her long-time boyfriend, a Singaporean lawyer Khoo Shao Tze in 1993, but split up in 2004 for a period of time. They reportedly got back together in 2011. Yeung and Khoo were married on 2 November 2013.[1] In early January 2017, she and Khoo announced that they are expecting. On 27 April 2017, Charlie gave birth to twin boys, Ignatius and Aloysius.[2]\n\nHello Tapir (2019)\n\nLittle Q (2019)\n\nCold War 2 (2016)\n\nKung Fu Jungle (2014)\n\nChristmas Rose (2013 - directorial debut)\n\nCatching Monkey (2012)\n\nCold War (2012)\n\nFloating City (2012)\n\nSleepwalker (2011)\n\nWind Blast (2010)\n\n37 (2010)\n\nBangkok Dangerous (2008)\n\nAfter This Our Exile (父子) (2006)\n\nAll About Love (再説一次我愛你) (2005)\n\nSeven Swords (七劍) (2005)\n\nNew Police Story (新警察故事) (2004)\n\nTarzan (1999) [voice, Cantonese dub]\n\nTask Force (熱血最強) (1997)\n\nThe Intimates (自梳女) (1997)\n\nDowntown Torpedoes (神偷諜影) (1997)\n\nA Chinese Ghost Story: The Tsui Hark Animation (小倩) (1997) [voice]\n\nThe Wedding Days (完全結婚手冊) (1997)\n\nDr. Wai in \"The Scripture with No Words\" (冒險王) (1996)\n\nYoung Policemen in Love (逃學戰警) (1995)\n\nFallen Angels (墮落天使) (1995)\n\nHigh Risk aka Meltdown (鼠膽龍威) (1995)\n\nLove in the Time of Twilight (花月佳期) (1995)\n\nHow Deep Is Your Love (霓虹光管高高掛之女子公寓) (1994)\n\nAshes of Time (東邪西毒) (1994)\n\nThe Lovers (梁祝) (1994)\n\nWhat Price Survival (94獨臂刀之情) (1994)\n\nFuture Cops (超級學校霸王) (1993)\n\n.[3][4]\n\nFeeling of Love (1993)\n\nFirst Love (1994)\n\nForget Me Not (1994)\n\nSmiling with Tears (1995)\n\nMythology (1995)\n\nDo Whatever you Want (1996)"
