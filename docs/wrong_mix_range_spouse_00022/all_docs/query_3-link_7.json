They find themselves in a race against time to find out the truth and the mastermind behind these murders.\n\nOriginally announced in 2018, the film marks Wai's return to direct since the 2009 film Written By, and a reunion with frequent collaborator Sean Lau.

The Sleuths believed that they are killing the real murderers who were either not caught, police caught the wrong culprit and led to the death of the innocents, or not prosecuted by the law for medical reasons.\n\nLee hallucinates talking to victims and future victims of the murder cases by the Sleuths and figures out the Sleuths' next victims and locations of the crime scene, often a step ahead of the OCTB, leading to the OCTB suspecting that Lee is a member of the Sleuths. Chan, a senior inspector of the OCTB, who also the only survivor in the Butcher case 17 years ago, believes Lee is the only hope to crack the Sleuths, requests his help. The deeper they investigate of the Sleuths' motive of crime, they discover the secrets of the past cases beyond their imagination.\n\nSean Lau as Jun Lee, a former police chief inspector and detective in the OCTB who was expelled after experiencing hallucinations.[2]\n\nCharlene Choi as Yee Chan, a senior inspector who is also the only survivor in the Butcher case and later got promoted to chief inspector of the OCTB.[2]\n\nRaymond Lam as Fong Lai-shun, a chief inspector in OCTB.[3]\n\nCarman Lee as Yan Wong, Jun Lee's old colleague, chief superintendent of the OCTB, the superior of Yee Chan, Fong Lai-shun and Au Yeung Kim.\n\nTan Kai as Au Yeung Kim, a superintendent of the OCTB.\n\nCarlos Chan as Tsai Ka-chu, an OCTB senior inspector.
