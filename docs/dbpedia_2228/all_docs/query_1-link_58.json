        "text": "Montgomery Blair Sibley, the former lawyer of DC Madam has started releasing the names of government agencies and companies that allegedly called her escort service, Pamela Martin & Associates, between 2000 and 2006. Lawyer Sibley has listed nearly 174 companies, groups and government agencies –from FBI to the US Army Training and Doctrine Command – that dialed in the late Deborah Jeane Palfrey's service.\n\n\"I am not releasing any individual names ... yet,\" said the DC Madam's lawyer, Sibley, reported The Daily Beast. When asked when the names would be released Sibley said: \"Not sure.\" Other entities in the court filing included the State Department, Department of Commerce, Department of Health and Human Services, IRS, and the US Coast Guard.\n\nThe former lawyer has been trying to void a 2007 restraining order since February 2016 that makes it illegal for Sibley to release the confidential escort service records that Palfrey shared with him. The controversial news has been making rounds in local media after allegations that US presidential candidate, Ted Cruz, might be a client of the service. Meanwhile, Cruz has denied all allegations that he cheated on his wife Heidi and had an association with a Washington DC madam. According to a National Enquirer report, Palfrey allegedly left a \"black book\" implicating Cruz when she mysteriously died.\n\nSo far, Republican senator David Vitter has been found to be a client after he admitted to using the service in 2007. According to Sibley, the information that he is failing to disclose is \"relevant to the upcoming presidential election.\" Nearly 1,500 clients are believed to have been named in the book and each client paid an estimated $300 (£210) an hour to request time with one of the madam's women."
