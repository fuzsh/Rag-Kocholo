        "text": "Deborah Palfrey, who has died aged 52, was known as \"the DC madam\"; for more than a decade she ran a call-girl ring in Washington DC which was alleged to attract clients from the heart of the American establishment.\n\nThe girls she employed at \"Pamela Martin & Associates\" were required to be university-educated, well-mannered and capable of holding an intelligent conversation about current affairs.\n\nAccording to Deborah Palfrey - who operated under the nom de guerre \"Ms Julia\" â€“ she ran \"a high-end adult fantasy firm which offered legal sexual and erotic services across the spectrum of adult sexual behaviour\"; the girls indulged merely in \"quasi-sexual\" game-playing (for up to $300 an hour), and she had been unaware that they had actually been engaging in sex.\n\nThis proposition failed to convince a jury, which last month found her guilty on multiple counts of racketeering and money laundering. She was on bail pending sentencing on July 24.\n\nDeborah Palfrey first came to public attention early last year, when it emerged that she had an exhaustive list of names and telephone numbers of the men who had sought her services.\n\nIn April 2007 Randall Tobias, a 65-year-old deputy secretary of state in charge of American foreign aid programmes, and a former chairman of the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical company, suddenly resigned \"for personal reasons\".\n\nWithin hours it became clear that his name was about to be linked with a high-class prostitution business in Washington DC, run by a woman based in California.\n\nIn October 2006 the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had frozen her assets and life savings, and there was speculation that she would offer for sale a list of 10,000 clients, said to include some of the most influential figures in Washington.\n\nIn the event, she abandoned this idea, ostensibly because the list \"might end up in the possession of an unscrupulous person or persons\", but not least because a court intervened to prevent her doing so. Instead she handed over - for nothing - an enormous quantity of documents to ABC News.\n\nAfter examining these, ABC announced that it would not reveal the identities of her clients since they were not \"newsworthy\". The network had identified senior businessmen, Nasa officials and at least five officers serving with the military; among the girls working for Deborah Palfrey were an instructor at the US Naval Academy and a legal secretary at a prominent law firm.\n\nOn July 9 2007 Deborah Palfrey released what was supposedly her entire list of telephone records on the internet; a few days earlier her lawyer, the flamboyant Montgomery Blair Sibley, had sent the same information on CD-ROMs to 54 individuals, including journalists.\n\nDavid Vitter, a Republican senator for Lousiana, was forced to acknowledge publicly that he had been one of her clients.\n\nThe daughter of a grocer, Deborah Jeane Palfrey was born on March 18 1956 at Charleroi, Pennsylvania. She was a majorette at Charleroi Area High School, took a degree in Law at Rollins College, Florida, and also studied at Thomas Jefferson School of Law and the University of San Diego.\n\nHaving started running only a small handful of girls, by 1990 she was earning some $100,000 a year. That year she was arrested, and two years later sentenced to 18 months' jail in California, emerging with the declared ambition to \"export Western and Indian art to Britain\".\n\nIn fact she resumed her escort business, setting up Pamela Martin & Associates in 1993 and advertising it as \"undoubtedly the best adult agency around\". It is believed that between 1993 and 2006 she made around $2 million.\n\nShe was eventually rumbled not by the police but by the tax authorities. Her girls would keep half their fees and send the other half to Deborah Palfrey by money order; it was this transaction that caught the attention of the IRS.\n\nIn October 2006 it raided her house in California, seizing $1 million worth of property and $500,000 in cash and stocks."
