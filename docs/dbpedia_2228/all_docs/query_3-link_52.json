        "text": "So U.S. Sen. David Vitter dodged the bullet, this time.\n\nNow that the accused D.C. Madam, who had threatened to call him as a witness, has rested her case without him, Vitter might be able to relax for a while.\n\nMaybe it will muffle the chatter over the \"very serious sin\" he cryptically admitted, after his cell phone number was discovered in Deborah Jeane Palfrey's records.\n\nAnd perhaps there won't be another scandal to drag his name back into the headlines. No more Larry Craigs. No more Eliot Spitzers.\n\nIt's perfectly possible that Vitter can go about his business in the Senate, and try to put the whole sordid mess behind him.\n\nThe problem for Vitter, even now, is that he can't. There will always be more bullets to dodge.\n\nIn fact, if Vitter wants to keep his job beyond 2010, when his current six year term ends, he can look forward to a campaign full of them.\n\nSure, things would have been worse had Vitter been forced to comply with Palfrey's subpoena and shown up in court, only to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. But the fact that his lawyer said he planned to take the fifth is damaging enough.\n\nPotential opponents -- Democrats, surely, but also perhaps untainted Republicans who might fare better against a strong opponent of the other party -- still have plenty of ammunition with which to attack.\n\nThey could ask, for example, just what Vitter was so intent on hiding, invoke some of the lurid details from those who testified that Palfrey sold sex, not fantasy, and quote prosecutor Daniel Butler summarizing what all the fuss is about:\n\n\"There is no question that in this case, prostitution was involved,\" Butler said in his closing. \"Men do not pay $250 for an hour or 90 minutes for casual conversation.\"\n\nAnd they could contrast his demand for privacy with the humiliation suffered by those less fortunate prosecution witnesses who were given immunity and forced to testify. They include another federal employee, Navy commander Rebecca Dickinson, who said in court that she worked for Palfrey on the side because she needed the money -- and who is now expected to be discharged from the military.\n\nEven worse: Vitter will have to face all this without being able to rely on his own A Game.\n\nThe senator is known for running clever, imaginative campaigns, but his family has always been an integral part of the package.\n\nIn 2004, when he won an outright primary victory over three Democratic opponents, his breakthrough ads included a tongue-in-cheek commercial-within-a-commercial featuring his young daughter as director; an ad in which Vitter promised change, ending with his wife Wendy handing him their baby son and saying he can start by changing the child's diaper; and a heartrending health care spot focusing on his prematurely born twins' difficult early days.\n\nBack then, the family focus softened his image. It made him seem funnier, less robotic and less mean.\n\nBut if he tried all that now, he'd just come across as calculating and coarse. Nobody wants to see this onetime family values crusader use his kids or his famously wronged wife as shields.\n\nVitter's other historic strength as a campaigner is that he attacks opponents with ease and enthusiasm. But it's tough to be aggressive when you're ducking questions, or attempting to change the subject by, say, claiming that those who compare him to Spitzer \"are people who've never agreed with me on important issues like immigration and other things.\"\n\nVitter is one politician who's great on offense, but shaky on defense.\n\nYet that's where he's bound to stay, as long as his opponents remain armed with the bullets he so thoughtfully provided them."
