        "text": "From Alan Bock\n\nThere’s a certain pleasure in seeing a possible sex scandal in Washington. Deborah Jeane Palfrey, also known as “Miz Julia,” ran something called Pamela Martin Associates, supposedly a high-toned escort service and not a prostitution ring at all. But apparently some of the girls delivered the goods, which was supposedly against company policy. Randall Tobias, a deputy secretary of state responsible for HIV/AIDS battles in Africa, noted for demanding that countries certify that they are fighting prositution in return for receiving U.S. aid, has already resigned when it was revealed that he was a customer.\n\nTobias (65, married with three children) told ABC News he contacted the service “to have gals come over to the condo to give me a massage” and there was “no sex.” Gals? Who says that? Supposedly 20/20 will do a show Friday during which other high-level customers will be revealed. Palfrey is fighting back after a federal indictment for pandering and in IRS investigation.\n\nAside from the fact that I think the country would be better off if prostitution were legal and above-boards rather than underground, there’s irony in a prositution ring in Babylon-on-the-Potomac. Whether it was an escort service or a prostitution ring, people paid for the service voluntarily and actual services were delivered. In government, however, money is taken by force and most of the time services of value are not delivered — or programs sold as trying to deliver some benign result end up doing just the opposite.\n\nSo who is more morally reprehensible?"
