        "text": "MUSICAL CHAIRS\n\nThe Democratic leadership clocked a lot of\n\novertime before adjourning for August recess, including a 90th birthday bash/fundraiser forThe Texas Observer in honor of Bernard “B” Rapoport at the home of Sen. Jay Rockefeller and Sharon Rockefeller. As Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi noticed, there were more congressional members at the party than on the floor, including Tom Harkin, Joe Lieberman, Rep. Chet Edwards and\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nKeeping the evening light, Sen. Ted Kennedy quipped: “The only thing I can’t stand about Rockefeller are\n\npeople that get ahead because of their famous name.” While the Dems lost the vote that night during a session coinciding with the party, guests were reminded of a Rapoport childhood saying referring to having it all: “If I won all the marbles, I had no one to play with.”\n\nBAD YEAR, GOOD DAY\n\nThe launch of Robert Novak’s memoir The\n\nPrince of Darkness was celebrated at the\n\nArmy Navy Club on July 19 by a conservative crowd. “I want to thank everyone for coming tonight,” said Novak. “I particularly want to thank Vice President Dick Cheney. Somebody said they saw us\n\nstanding together and dubbed us the prince of darkness and Darth Vader.”\n\nTo call Novak the prince of darkness is an understatement, even by his own\n\nadmission. A week later when Newt Gingrich spoke at a luncheon he\n\nreferred to Novak as someone who was once a good reporter but now\n\njust a personality – a thought which Novak admitted to finding amusing\n\nsince it was the first time anyone thought he had a personality. Guests\n\nincluded Arnaud de Borchgrave,Lynne Cheney, Josh Bolton, Chris\n\nWallace and Al Hunt.\n\nSECONDS ANYONE?\n\nSen. Joe Biden announced his second presidential bid in January.\n\nIs it better the second time around? If you attended his book launch for\n\nPromises to Keep, you would think so. “In the 11 years I have been in\n\nthe senate, I have not met anyone who has enriched me as much –\n\npersonally and professionally – as Joe Biden,” claimed republican Sen. Chuck Hagel., adding, “I don’t know what the hell party I belong to\n\nanymore.” Biden snapped back, suggesting that he would have chosen Hagel to be his vice president – until he realized that may not be the best thing to do to a friend. Flanked by his family, Biden recalled his bout with brain aneurisms, during which time he told his children what he wanted on his tombstone. “Son, brother, husband, father and ... athlete.” To which he imagined his brothers responding: “Delusional to the end.”\n\nTime will tell."
