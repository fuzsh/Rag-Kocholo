A proud Vietnam Veteran, he served his country in the United States Air Force for twenty years. Jay loved to travel; he traveled the entire United States and had been on seventy-two cruises during his lifetime. As much as he enjoyed traveling, his greatest joy came from time spent with his beloved family.\n\nAlong with his parents, his son, Gary W. Palfrey, preceded him in death.\n\nHis memory will forever be treasured by his loving wife of 52 years, Shirley Merrick of Kathleen; sons, Richard C. Palfrey (Darlene) of Bonaire, Phillip L. Palfrey (Exie) of Acworth; grandchildren, Jason Palfrey, Niki Palfrey, Ann Marie Mays, Matthew Palfrey, Kelley Anne Palfrey; great-grandchildren, Taylor Palfrey, Tyler Palfrey, Kaylee Tucker, Landon Tucker, Jordyn Bostian, Holden Mays, Jasper Mays, Bryson Tompkins, Westin Tompkins, and sister, Janet Ruth Clark of New York.\n\nVisitation will be Tuesday, August 15, 2017 from 10:00 a.m. until 11:00 a.m. at McCullough Funeral Home. A funeral service will immediately follow at 11:00 a.m. in the Chapel of McCullough. After the service, Jay will be laid to rest in Parkway Memorial Gardens with full military honors.\n\nTo order memorial trees or send flowers to the family in memory of Tsgt.
