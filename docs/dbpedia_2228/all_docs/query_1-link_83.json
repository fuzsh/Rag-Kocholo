        "text": "Palfrey History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nThe history of the name Palfrey dates back to the ancient Anglo-Saxon culture of Britain. It is derived from a member of the family who worked as a person who worked as the palfreyman, who was in charge of the palfreys or colts. 1 This occupational surname was first derived from the Old French word parfrement which referred to the individual who saddled horses for women. 2 The term palfrey usually referred to the most expensive and highly-bred types of riding horse during the Middle Ages. 3\n\nOne source presumes the family came from Normandy as Richard, Roger Palfrei or Palefridus were listed in Normandy (1180-1195.) 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Palfrey family\n\nThe surname Palfrey was first found in Hampshire where Hunfridus Palefrei was listed at Winton in 1148. Later Ralph Palefray was listed at Boldon in 1183. 3\n\nProving the widespread use of this occupational name, the Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 included: Thomas Palfrei, Lincolnshire; Richard Palefray, Salop (Shropshire); Gilbert Palfrey, Norfolk; and John Palefrey, Norfolk. 2\n\nChaucer in his Knight's Tale notes \"And to the paleis rode titer many a route Of lordes, upon stedes and palfreis.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Palfrey family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Palfrey research.

More information about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nPalfrey migration to the United States +\n\nTo escape the unstable social climate in England of this time, many families boarded ships for the New World with the hope of finding land, opportunity, and greater religious and political freedom. Although the voyages were expensive, crowded, and difficult, those families that arrived often found greater opportunities and freedoms than they could have experienced at home. Many of those families went on to make significant contributions to the rapidly developing colonies in which they settled. Early North American records indicate many people bearing the name Palfrey were among those contributors:\n\nPalfrey Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nPeter Palfrey, from Somerset, who arrived in Massachusetts in 1624 aboard the ship \"Zouch Phoenix\"\n\nPeter Palfrey, who landed in Salem, Massachusetts in 1626 5\n\nJohn Palfrey, who arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1658\n\nPalfrey Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nAlexander Palfrey, who settled in Santa Clara Co. CA in 1850\n\nWilliam Palfrey, who arrived in Allegany (Allegheny) County, Pennsylvania in 1866 5\n\nPalfrey migration to Australia +\n\nEmigration to Australia followed the First Fleets of convicts, tradespeople and early settlers.

By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life.

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 11\n\nPalfrey Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nJonathan Palfrey, a bonded passenger, who arrived in Barbados in 1698\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Palfrey (post 1700) +\n\nYolande Palfrey (1957-2011), English actress, best remembered for her BBC work \"Pennies from Heaven\"\n\nQuentin Palfrey (b. 1974), American lawyer, policymaker, and political candidate, Deputy General Counsel at the United States Department of Commerce\n\nLisa Palfrey (b. 1967), Welsh actress, best known for her roles as Gwenny in House of America (1997), Mrs Nice in Guest House Paradiso (1999), Maureen in Pride (2014), Mrs Dai Bread 1 in Under Milk Wood (2015)\n\nDeborah Jeane Palfrey (1956-2008), owner of Pamela Martin and Associates\n\nJohn Palfrey (b. 1972), Executive Director of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School\n\nWilliam Palfrey, Chief Constable of Lancashire\n\nStephen Palfrey Webb (1804-1879), American politician, Mayor of Salem, Massachusetts; Mayor of San Francisco, California, 1854-55 12\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nCitations +\n\nLower, Mark Anthony, Patronymica Britannica, A Dictionary of Family Names of the United Kingdom.
