This episode will also be available for free to public radio stations.\n\nEpisode two is about the special challenges facing Spanish-speaking families whose children are learning to read English at school.

PAUL, Sept. 7, 2023- Glen Nelson Center at American Public Media Group (APMG) is proud to announce it is joining a coalition of 22 funders across the United States to launch Press Forward, a groundbreaking national initiative aimed at revitalizing and empowering local journalism. As part of this strategic alliance, Glen Nelson Center is committing $5 million in new investments in media companies with a focus on local journalism over the next five years.\n\nPress Forward will enhance local journalism at an unprecedented level to re-center local news as a force for community cohesion; support new models and solutions that are ready to scale; and close longstanding inequities in journalism coverage and practice. The coalition of funders has committed more than a half-billion dollars to the initiative over five years.\n\n\"At American Public Media Group, we are dedicated to the transformative potential of local journalism and the absolute necessity of strong local news organization as a force for community strength and connection,\" said Jean Taylor, CEO of APMG. \"Our commitment to Press Forward is one of the ways APMG is investing in media innovation and the future of public media.\"\n\nLaunched in 2018, Glen Nelson Center invests in promising media startups, leading to powerful learning and business development opportunities for APMG while delivering a financial return. To date, Glen Nelson Center has supported the work of 600+ ventures through investments, competitions and incubator/accelerator programs including the Next Challenge for Media & Journalism, the largest media startup competition in the U.S.\n\n\"We are at a crossroads for local journalism in the United States,” said Jeff Freeland Nelson, Executive Director of the Glen Nelson Center. \"Either we accept the slow decline of local news and collapse of long-standing media business models or champion innovation and foster resilience through investments in new models for providing the high-quality local news our communities need.”\n\nSince 2005, approximately 2,200 local newspapers have closed, resulting in 20 percent of Americans living in “news deserts” with little to no reliable coverage of important local events. Press Forward seeks to reverse the dramatic decline in local news that has coincided with an increasingly divided America and weakening trust in institutions.\n\n“We have a moment to support the reimagination, revitalization, and rapid development of local news. We are prepared to support the strongest ideas and seed new ones; build powerful networks; and invest in people, organizations, and networks with substantial resources,” said John Palfrey, President of the MacArthur Foundation and a leader of the Press Forward initiative. “The philanthropic sector recognizes the need to strengthen American democracy and is beginning to see that progress on every other issue, from education and healthcare to criminal justice reform and climate change, is dependent on the public’s understanding of the facts.”\n\nInitial Press Forward partners are The Archewell Foundation, Carnegie Corporation of New York, Community Foundation for the Land of Lincoln, Democracy Fund, Ford Foundation, Mary W.

PAUL, Minn., January 10, 2023 – APM Studios and the Poetry Foundation today announced that award-winning poet and writer Major Jackson has been selected as the new host of the celebrated poetry podcast, The Slowdown. Starting January 23, Jackson will carry on the tradition of sharing a selected poem and thoughtful reflection every weekday, offering listeners a daily opportunity to find connection and calm through poetry.\n\nJackson is the author of six books of poetry, including Razzle Dazzle: New & Selected Poems (2023), The Absurd Man (2020), Roll Deep (2015), Holding Company (2010), Hoops (2006), and Leaving Saturn (2002), which won a Cave Canem Poetry Prize for a first book of poems. His edited volumes include: Best American Poetry 2019, Renga for Obama, and Library of America’s Countee Cullen: Collected Poems. He is also the author of A Beat Beyond: The Selected Prose of Major Jackson edited by Amor Kohli.\n\nRemarked Jackson: “Since its first episode, each morning I listened to The Slowdown, a ritual in my day as essential as taking a walk or brushing my teeth. Through the open-ended splendor of a poem, the podcast’s hosts encouraged me to find possibility and power in the small moments and sacred mysteries. Even before walking out the door, I felt energized, occasionally provoked, by poetry’s wisdom and the daily wonders occasioned by the simple act of listening. I felt prepared to enter the thick of my workday with just a little more understanding and curiosity. Poetry allows us to collect the rich chorus, that is our tender humanity, within us. I am excited to continue the amazing privilege of daily presenting a poem knowing some listener will feel renewed, maybe even seen, and even better, transformed by the grace of insightful language.”\n\nJackson takes over hosting duties from Ada Limón, who is departing to become the 24th Poet Laureate of the United States. Limón remarked: “Major and I have known each other for over twenty years and I was delighted to hear that he was selected to take over the show. I know The Slowdown will benefit from his insight, humor, and wisdom, and that he will be helming the ship with both grace and warmth.”\n\nJackson is a recipient of fellowships from the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, Guggenheim Foundation, National Endowment for the Arts, and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. He has been awarded a Pushcart Prize, a Whiting Writers’ Award, and has been honored by the Pew Fellowship in the Arts and the Witter Bynner Foundation in conjunction with the Library of Congress. Jackson’s poems and essays have been published in American Poetry Review, The New Yorker, Orion Magazine, Paris Review, Ploughshares, Poetry London and many distinguished journals. He currently lives in Nashville, Tennessee where he is the Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Chair in the Humanities at Vanderbilt University. He also serves as the Poetry Editor of The Harvard Review.\n\nNew episodes of The Slowdown are available every weekday on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and all other podcast platforms.

PAUL, Minn., March 30, 2022 – YourClassical’s Performance Today, from American Public Media, has named acclaimed pianist, producer, curator, storyteller, cultural visionary and arts advocate Lara Downes as the 2022 Classical Woman of the Year. This annual award, from Performance Today, recognizes women who have made significant contributions to the classical music art form and have inspired our listeners.\n\nWith her wide-ranging talent, and her open spirit of musical connection and collaboration, Downes is at home on major global stages like Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, and the Kennedy Center. She has played in intimate and non-traditional classical music venues such as clubs, galleries, universities, schools, public spaces and anywhere people gather to share the arts.\n\nAs she says, her goal is not just to create and perform music, but to “tell stories, open hearts, and share beauty.”\n\nDownes’ comprehensive exploration of American music has led to a series of more than 20 acclaimed recordings, including her most recent release Reflections, Scott Joplin Reconsidered, which debuted at the top of the Billboard chart. Her recent recordings elevate the works of groundbreaking African American composer Florence Price, 19th century master Clara Schumann, and celebrate freedom songs and spirituals.\n\nShe is the creator and curator of Rising Sun Music, a recording series focusing on music and stories of Black composers of the past two centuries. Downs is also the creator and host of AMPLIFY with Lara Downes, a series of video conversations for NPR Music. She’s Resident Artist for Classical KDFC in San Francisco and Classical KUSC in Los Angeles. She is the recipient of numerous prestigious awards, fellowships, and grants from major arts institutions around the world.\n\n“I’m over the moon that Lara Downes is our 2022 Classical Woman of the Year,” said Fred Child, host and senior editor of Performance Today. “She is a true artist among pianists, with a keen ear for curating fascinating concert programs. She brings her vision and passion to a vast range of activities that touch the lives and cultural conversations of music-lovers everywhere. Her steadfast commitment to broadening our understanding and appreciation for composers from all walks of life creates a world in which our art form and our communities are richer, more creative, and in the end both more human and humane. It’s with great pleasure that we recognize Lara with this well-deserved award.”\n\nDownes was selected by the staff of Performance Today based on listener nominations, submitted through the month of March. Praise for Downes in these nominations include:\n\n“A superb pianist, she promotes marginalized classical voices. Downes envisions an artistically vibrant world where classical music is egalitarian and accessible to all. Her artistry and that bold vision are why she deserves this title.” Michael, Denton TX.\n\n“In addition to her excellence as a musician, she has a gift for teaching.” Carol, Eugene OR.\n\n“From even her earliest recordings, Lara has consistently sought music of under-represented composers to share with her audience. In recent years Lara has been in the forefront in raising awareness and appreciation of the music and music-making of Black Americans. She has been a true leader in this.” James, Spokane WA.\n\n“(I’m touched by) her piano artistry, her ‘at home’ concerts during the Covid shut-down, and her national and local classical music broadcasts!” Marty, San Diego CA.\n\n“Lara's efforts to promote, support, and encourage young Black performers and composers, as well as her dedication to performing the work of forgotten composers are important contributions to the music scene. She should be recognized for her determination, virtuosity, and verve!” Nancy, Windham VT.\n\nDownes will be recognized on the March 30 episode of Performance Today, including a conversation with Child about her extensive career and accomplishments.\n\n###\n\nAbout YourClassical\n\nYourClassical® is a collection of curated classical music listening experiences and information produced by Minnesota Public Radio and American Public Media®.

Kimberly’s depth of knowledge spanning politics, technology and the economy gives her a great perspective to be tackling these complicated issues alongside Kai.”\n\n“I’ve had a great time filling in with Kai on Make Me Smart, and I’m thrilled to be stepping into this role full-time,” said Adams. “With so much going on in the economy and the world, Make Me Smart is a great platform to have thoughtful conversations about serious topics, and a bit of fun as well.
