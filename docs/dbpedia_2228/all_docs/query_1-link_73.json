        "text": "A major leak affecting the United States currently was the recent release of the names of companies, government agencies and organizations that had called D.C. Madame’s escort service between 2000 and 2006. Deborah Jeane Palfrey, also referred to as D.C. Madame, is accused by federal prosecutors of running a prostitution ring earning more than $2 million over thirteen years. Palfrey’s business began in 1993 and she contends that her escort service was legitimate.…\n\nThe government says we can’t get our natural or unalienable rights taken away. They have basically lied to us the WHOLE ENTIRE TIME. In Document A talks about the Espionage Act. The Espionage Act was past in 1917 when people were calling our government bad because the government had no power and the people of the UNITED STATES of AMERICA had the freedom of speech. The Sedition Act was past in 1918 when the Espionage Act wasn’t working out , so they had to make another law that was more strict.…\n\nBoth Oscar Wilde and Christina Rossetti present the attractiveness of wrongdoing and fear of its consequences in both similar and different ways within An Ideal Husband and Rossetti’s Selected Poems. Rossetti and Wilde consider the attractiveness of wrongdoing under different themes. Wilde looks more at a political side of wrongdoing, whereas Rossetti considers wrongdoing in a religious sense. Mrs. Cheveley is a character that is very attracted to wrongdoing; this is evident in An Ideal Husband when she tries to blackmail Sir Robert Chiltern with the letter he wrote to Baron Arheim (who Robert Chiltern was an apprentice to) ‘insert quote.’…\n\nIn 1940, Lord Philip Kerr Lothian of England, ambassador to the United States, and Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War under President William Howard Taft, agreed to “exchange full information on German, Italian, and Japanese code and cryptographic information” and “a continuous exchange of important information in connection with the above.” (Lothian 1, NSA document) This agreement, known as the UKUSA Treaty, (afterward involving the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) of Canada, the Australian Defense Security Directorate (DSD), and the General Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) of New Zealand in 1948), would later become the ECHELON system, managed by the National Security Agency (NSA). This ECHELON system placed “intercept stations…\n\nPart 13: In 1901 the rebellion continued, and strict fighting took place near Colon in Panama. Fighting went on with great wildness with the government troops generally winning the battles. On several occasions foreign troops had to be settled to protect foreign concerns, as was the case at Colon and Panama, to protect the operations of the Panama Railroad. On the final conquer of the revolutionists; the country was in a horrifying condition.…\n\nFor almost a decade, Manuel Noriega was the face of the corrupt Panama government. He was first an ally to the United States, working for the CIA. He then became the country’s enemy as the United States drove him out of his control over Panama’s puppet government in 1990. Even though he was born to a poor family in Panama City, Manuel Antonio Noriega received a privileged level of education. He was educated at the National Institute, one of Panama’s leading high school, to train him in the field of medicine.…\n\nThe public’s response to the Pentagon Papers phenomenal, they were featured on nightly newscasts and in newspapers from all over the country. As a result there was a change in the public’s attitude, “Unfamiliar and painful as it was, no one really challenged it; the documentation was irrefutable. That was a change in American consciousness, reinforced two years later by the Watergate revelations…” (Secrets, 413). Not only does Ellsberg impact the public, he also impacts the Nixon Administration, “The leak of the Pentagon Papers was the catalyst behind the Nixon administration’s amplified willingness to break the law in pursuit of its own agenda.…\n\nReleasing this information is illegal, due to the fact that it violates the contract he signed upon working for the government. Because he released these documents, Snowden could have been jailed, exiled, or killed/executed. “I didn't want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself,” he says to an interviewer. Snowden…\n\nThe Iran-Contra Affair, of 1986, quickly made the headlines in newspapers worldwide. The sale of arms to Iran that were to improve U.S. influence in Middle Eastern countries would become more than just that. The Iran-Contra Affair portrays how President Reagan and other politicians had broken their oath by giving into negotiation with terrorists and breaking other laws. There were many nations involved in this affair. The main ones were the United States, Iran, and Nicaragua (Weiss et al.1).…\n\nInformation that has been leaked has been very, very small bits of information that could not be traced back to one person easily or not even at all. The cases that have been without court oversight are cases that have been on the spot…\n\n“There can be no faith in government if our highest offices are excused from scrutiny – they should be setting the example of transparency” (Snowden, qtd in Pope). Edward Snowden made this statement following his leak of thousands of classified documents to the press. The contents of these documents shed light on the National Security Agency’s massive surveillance system. However, this system was not only being used against the United States’s enemies – U.S. citizens themselves were being monitored. This practice, a gross violation of the fourth amendment, was ruled unconstitutional.…\n\nRachel Lowry writes in her essay “Straddling Online and Offline Profiles, Millennials Search for Identity” that according to a recent online study, one out of four Millennials say they can only be their true self when alone (p. 500). But in this modern age of social media and smartphones, are we ever truly alone? Everyone can be connected with people all over the world in a second, and everyone can easily find out information about whoever they want with a simple Google search. Consequently, even if someone shuts off their computer and phone, any personal information they've posted about themselves is still out there for anyone to find. In addition to people constantly sharing aspects of their daily lives on social media, monitoring apps and…\n\nI am glad to communicate with you and other classmates in the following classes in every interesting topics. You indeed got my idea and I agree with that one person could do whatever he or she likes to with his or her money once it is legal and has no harm to others.\" As different countries have various policies about the offshore account and I am not familiar with this kind of legislation, I prefer to regard the Panama Issue as an ethical issue more than a legal matter. Actually, most of the international companies like Apple and Uber now are all involving in the overseas tax shelters. I think If we consider an country as a huge organization, to some extent, how the government leaders and the law deal with such kind of issue shows its culture…\n\nSnowden looked at and studied every document before deciding on what to release. Unlike past leaks, he did not put it onto Wiki Leaks or upload them to the Internet. The U.S. government collected information on millions of Americans that were not linked to terrorism in any way. The U.S. also collects information on other countries, even allies (New Yorker). Since 9/11 there has been an increase in spying with the agencies and committees that are meant to be monitoring the activities of the spying agencies who are not enforcing anything; so, the NSA was…"
