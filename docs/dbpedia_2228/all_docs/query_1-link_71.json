        "text": "Dick Morris, now a Republican, was political consultant for 20 years to Democratic President Bill Clinton. Morris, who resigned his position in 1996 due to allegations that he had engaged the services of a prostitute, was again the subject of similar circumstances in April 2007.\n\nTobacco issues\n\nAccording to a PBS Frontline interview, Dick Morris worked with Dick Scruggs on asbestos litigation. When Scruggs told Morris about his intent to sue the major tobacco companies, Morris surveyed Mississippians to gauge public reaction to such a suit. The interview also claims that Morris had personal reasons for wanting to sue the tobacco companies: he was born premature, weighing only 2 pounds 11 ounces, as a result of this mother's chainsmoking during her pregnancy. Morris also lost his mother, a lifelong smokers, to cancer.\n\nMorris helped convince President Bill Clinton to bring a federal lawsuit against the major American tobacco companies.[1]\n\nSex Scandals\n\nOn August 29, 1996, Morris announced his resignation \"hours before President Clinton delivered his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention after The New York Post and the Star[2], \"a supermarket tabloid, published allegations\" by \"suddenly famous Virginia call girl\" Sherry Rowland, a $200-an-hour prostitute, who said \"that she had a long-running relationship with Morris.\" Rowland said that \"Republicans had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"As for Morris's downfall, Rowlands said: 'Someone as intelligent as he is should have kept his lip buttoned when he unzipped his pants. I mean, how can you maneuver worlds, and he can't even control what he's doing in his own room with a paid lady?'\" At the time, Morris \"declined to address the allegations\". [3]\n\nIn April 2007, Deborah Jeane Palfrey, known as the D.C. Madam, named Randall L. Tobias, \"the top foreign aid adviser in the State Department\", who \"became the most prominent person on the list to be publicly identified when he resigned after acknowledging to ABC News that he was among Ms. Palfrey’s clients,\" Eric Lipton reported April 27, 2007, in the New York Times.\n\nPalfrey \"included in a court filing and posted on her Web site the man's photo and tax records. Dick Morris, the television commentator and former adviser to President Bill Clinton, who resigned in 1996 after reports that he was seeing a prostitute, was also a customer, Ms. Palfrey’s lawyer has said in court. Mr. Morris has denied the accusation,\" Lipton wrote.\n\nAdditionally, on April 27, 2007, Palfrey's attorney, Montgomery Blair Sibley, said that he \"filed notice that he intends to depose political consultant Dick Morris in a separate civil proceeding. Morris would not comment.\" [4]\n\nMorris on Hillary Clinton\n\nMorris has \"spent much of the past decade writing and speaking out against\" Democratic 2008 presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.). [5]\n\n\"Morris managed Bill Clinton's successful 1996 reelection campaign until he was embroiled in a toe-sucking sex scandal with a prostitute. Since then, he has broken ties with the Clintons, and created a cottage industry out of critiquing them in his column in the New York Post and on Fox News. His Hillary hating has even included writing a book-length rebuttal of her memoir Living History, as well as another book imagining a presidential election matchup between her and Condoleezza Rice,\" Katharine Mieszkowski wrote for the December 19, 2006, issue of Salon's War Room.\n\nAccording to Morris, \"'Hillary will be the next president, and she’ll be the worst president we’ve ever seen.' No matter what happens, the situation in Iraq will 'assure that the GOP gets massacred in 2008 congressional elections.' In 2010, the Republicans will take back the Congress — 'Hillary will give Republicans the same gift she gave them in 1994' — and they’ll win the presidency in 2012, but thanks to demographic shifts favoring Democrats (namely the rising Hispanic and African-American populations), 'that will be the last Republican president we'll ever see.'\" [6]\n\nAlso see The Presidential Coalition.\n\nArticles by Dick Morris\n\nMorris's articles are published online on his websites DickMorris.com and VOTE.com, as well as by Fox News (link); FrontPageMag.com (link); Jewish World Review (link); NewsMax (link); RealClearPolitics.com; The New York Post; and The Hill News.com.\n\nAdditionally, Morris's articles can be found at:\n\n\"Hillary’s Fable.
