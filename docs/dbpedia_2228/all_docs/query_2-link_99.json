        "text": "Wow. How do I even begin to write an obituary for my partner of 31 years?\n\nOn January 22, 2021 Joe Riche was taken away from us in an instant. Since that day, I have received hundreds of messages of how Joe touched the lives of so many people. From his childhood friends, to his 80’s band mates. From his life-long buddies, to his current football mates. From his fellow adventure-seeking friends from all over the world, to his car and bike-loving crew. From his clients who considered Joe a close personal friend to fellow entrepreneurs and the business community.\n\nJoe touched the lives of so many people in his 56 years that it is incredible to me! I’ve thought a lot about this and it’s because he “practiced passion” in absolutely everything he did. He was curious and genuinely interested in absolutely everything and everyone around him.\n\nWho was Joe Riche? He was an excellent father to our beautiful daughter Jessie. He was a dog walker to our three dogs. He was a man of strong integrity. A true gentleman. Financial advisor extraordinaire. He worked hard, but played harder. World traveller. Mountain Climber. Coach. Raiders fan. Habs fan. Musician. Animal lover. Collector of all things. Voracious reader. Harley rider. Muscle car driver. Trivia champion. Prankster. He was a tremendous partner who loved me dearly.\n\nHe is a man we are all so proud to have had in our family.\n\nJoe leaves behind our sweet, beautiful daughter Jessie, who he loved with all his heart, his mother Hilda Pollard (St. John’s), his father Fred Riche and wife Rose Mangone (Oakville, Ontario), and me, Kim Spearns, his partner, and best friend of 31 years, who was lucky enough to be along for the wild ride through it all!\n\nFollowing his wishes, cremation has taken place and a celebration of life will be held at a later date. Donations in Joe’s memory may be made to the SPCA.\n\nRest in Peace Darlin’. As you always said, you really were “living the dream”!\n\nI’m so proud of you and I love you. XOXO"
