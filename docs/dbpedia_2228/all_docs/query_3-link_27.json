        "text": "The 'DC Madam's' former lawyer wants to release her black book of clients - and claims it could have an impact on the Presidential race.\n\nMontgomery Blair Sibley represented Deborah Jeane Palfrey in 2008 when she was convicted of federal racketeering and various prostitution charges.\n\nThe scandal of her arrest rocked the nation's capital as some of the city's biggest power players, including father-of-four Senator David Vitter, were outed.\n\nPalfrey hanged herself in 2008 before she was set to be sentenced for her crimes and left the book containing details of her 815 clients behind.\n\nThe information inside the book was sealed by a judge, but Sibley has filed a motion in a bid to have it released.\n\nHe's filed a judicial conduct complaint to lift his gag order so he can release the names from Palfrey's records.\n\nSibley says those records 'may contain information relevant to the upcoming presidential election', FOX 5 reported.\n\nHe told Daily Mail Online he could not comment on the contents of the book because of the court order.\n\nThe attorney has hit headlines in the past. He filed a failed lawsuit claiming Barack Obama isn't a natural-born citizen and also ran for president in 2012 as a write-in candidate\n\nNews of Palfrey's death in 2008 followed reports she handed a list of telephone numbers of 15,000 clients to a U.S. television network\n\nShe had vowed to identify as many well-known figures as possible to subpoena them as defense witnesses.\n\nPalfrey had insisted her company, Pamela Martin and Associates, was a legal enterprise that provided 'high-end' clients with nude dancing and massage, but not sex and initially considered selling her phone records in order to raise money for her defense.\n\nWhen she later released her phone records for free, they ended up shedding little further light on her clientele.\n\nIn what could be the biggest sex scandal in the U.S. capital for more than a decade, Ms Palfrey caused the resignation of married 65-year-old Randall Tobias, a deputy to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\n\nThe list also thrust another official, Pentagon adviser Harlan Ullman, into the heart of the scandal.\n\nHowever Senator David Vitter was one of the biggest victims. He admitted to being on Palfrey's 'list' and was forced into a grovelling apology.\n\nHe suffered months of attack ads and recently addressed the scandal in a campaign video.\n\nThe 30-second commercial released in November shows Vitter sitting at a kitchen table as he talks to the camera, saying: 'Fifteen years ago, I failed my family but found forgiveness and love.'\n\n'I learned that our falls aren't what define us but rather how we get up, accept responsibility and earn redemption,' Vitter says, as the ad next shows him eating dinner with his family."
