        "text": "Deborah Jeane Palfrey first knew something was wrong on a trip to Germany.\n\nShe suddenly found her bank card was not working any more. Then, back in her hotel room, a journalist from a gossip website called her.\n\nHe had been leaked a court document detailing Palfrey's alleged sex empire in Washington DC, serving the rich and powerful with a ring of beautiful, university-educated call girls. Her assets had been seized by the Government.\n\nAs Palfrey struggled to understand what was happening, the journalist wanted to know if she was ashamed of herself.\n\nThe \"DC Madam\" scandal had just been born. It is a story that has gripped Washington's usually staid political classes.\n\nPalfrey stands accused of running a prostitution ring for more than 13 years. It is a charge she denies, maintaining her girls dealt out only massages and erotic role-play. She made them all sign agreements not to engage in illegal behaviour.\n\nPalfrey has vowed to identify the men who used her services to prove her story, and she has years of phone records to help her. All across the Washington area there are now thousands of nervous, powerful - often married - men.\n\nBut the DC Madam story is much more than a titillating guessing game.\n\nThe scale of her operation exposed a dark underside of Washington life.\n\nOften decried as a dull government town, it has shown how sex and prostitution are key to how Washington works. From Nasa to the Pentagon to the State Department, officials of all levels were using Palfrey's girls.\n\nThe saga has also revealed a deep hypocrisy, showing how powerful men talk publicly of their family values and then have escorts visit them in hotel rooms.\n\nIt is not a scandal that will go away. Last Sunday, as President George W. Bush sat in St John's Church in Lafayette Square for the morning service, the Rev Luis Leon remarked on Palfrey's case in his sermon. \"Here in Washington DC a lot of people get in trouble on this one,\" Leon said.\n\nWhen the President's priest is talking about a sex scandal, you know trouble is brewing in Washington.\n\nPalfrey's clients came from all walks of life. There is a Bush Administration economist, a prominent company chief executive, Nasa officials, men who work at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, lobbyists for Republicans and Democrats, the commander of an Air Force squadron and at least five other military officers.\n\nSo far the identities - of perhaps up to 10,000 men - have remained secret. Only two have been exposed. One was Harlan Ullman, a military expert and the author of the \"shock and awe\" strategy used in Iraq. The other was State Department official Randall Tobias, who is a leading advocate of fighting prostitution abroad. He has resigned.\n\nThe one thing all the men have in common was that they once rang Pamela Martin and Associates, the cover name for Palfrey's operation, which advertised, like hundreds of other \"massage\" services in Washington, online or in local newspapers.\n\nCalls were rerouted to Palfrey's home in California - specifically to a phone in her laundry room, where she sometimes battled the sound of her washing machine as she took down details of her client's desires.\n\nShe ran a network of about 130 girls. One was a legal secretary, another a University of Maryland academic and another an instructor at a naval academy. They charged $300 an hour.\n\nIt was lucrative, but not a goldmine. Over 13 years she earned US$2 million.\n\nThat's enough to get very comfortable with, but hardly a fortune. The surprising truth of the DC Madam is how ordinary her operation was.\n\nCompared with the high-octane glamour of Hollywood's famous madam Heidi Fleiss, or New York's blueblood procuress Sydney Biddle Barrows, Palfrey was very Washington: subdued, respectable and modest.\n\nThat modesty is displayed during her court appearances, where she has eschewed fashionable clothes, wearing navy blue outfits and subdued makeup.\n\n\"She looks like she should be wearing little white gloves. She's a soft-spoken woman. I curse more than her,\" said Lee Mirabel, a radio host who acts as her spokeswoman.\n\nPalfrey would send out weekly messages to her girls, offering advice like a corporate newsletter.\n\n\"Nail colour is to match lipstick colour,\" she suggested. She also said girls should use \"fat cream for the thighs\". But the missives also acknowledged the legally shaky side of the business. She warned of an investigation by a Virginia vice squad officer, advising girls to burn or shred evidence of their client meetings within 24 hours.\n\n\"Destroy the data immediately!!!!!!!\" she demanded.\n\nPalfrey had good reason to be worried. She had been caught before. She was arrested in California in 1990 for running a smaller escort service.\n\nShe ended up disappearing during her trial, leaving a long note with her lawyer saying the idea of prison was \"an absurd and unthinkable horror\".\n\nBut she was caught on the Canadian border the next year and served 18 months in jail. Not that it deterred her. She started Pamela Martin and Associates - where she was known as \"Miz Julia\" - in 1993, shortly after she was released.\n\nHer luck held out longer the second time around. She ran her business without incident until 2004, when - unknown to her - a tip-off to the tax authorities alerted them to her activities. It is believed to have come from someone angered by discovering his girlfriend was one of Palfrey's escorts.\n\nFor two years detectives investigated the business, finally descending on it in October last year.\n\nBut investigators combing through her home did not notice a huge pile of phone records. In total they weighed 21kg and recorded more than a quarter of a million phone calls dating from the Clinton years through to the current Bush Administration.\n\nThe records were in Palfrey's hands - the police had been looking for \"a little black book\", unaware that Palfrey did not have one.\n\nNow she is using those lists to show the DC establishment who used her service that she will not go quietly.\n\nFor the truth exposed by the DC Madam - and largely ignored by the American press so far - has been how ingrained the sex industry is in Washington.\n\nEscort services operate openly. In the metro area of the city an online search reveals more than 8000 adverts for escort services. \"That's more escort services than there are McDonald's,\" says Mirabel.\n\nIn many ways Washington represents a perfect market for a booming sex industry. Being a government-dominated town, it is heavily male - many rich, powerful and middle-aged.\n\nIt is home to international organisations, such as the World Bank, that are full of well-paid workers away from their home countries, where prostitution might be more socially acceptable. Or, like many visiting diplomats or businessmen, they might simply be lonely.\n\nPalfrey's attempts to publicise those who used her services have led many to accuse her of blackmail.\n\nBut the real story of victimhood is not the men who may be exposed or already have been. The real victim here is Brandy Britton, one of Palfrey's girls who was arrested by local police just as the investigation reached full swing.\n\nBritton, a former lecturer in sociology and biology, was also a call girl, entertaining clients in her home.\n\nHer arrest threw her into the full glare of the media. She could not take the exposure and the mother-of-two hanged herself in January. \"The press ruined her,\" says Bill Keisling, a crime writer and friend of Palfrey.\n\nPalfrey has been selling interviews on eBay. She has also handed over a whole new section of her list to a group of Washington investigative writers and there is the coming court case in which she will be defended by Preston Burton, the lawyer who once represented Monica Lewinsky.\n\nThe story of the DC Madam may have only just begun.\n\n-OBSERVER"
