        "text": "Deborah Jeane Palfrey operated an escort agency in Washington D.C. called Pamela Martin and Associates for 13 years. In 2006, she was investigated and convicted of racketeering, money laundering, and using the mail for illegal purposes related to her escort business. Shortly after her conviction, facing years in prison, Palfrey was found dead by suicide. Her death was concluded to be a suicide by autopsy and police investigation."
