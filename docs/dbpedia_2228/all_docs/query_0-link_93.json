        "text": "I’ve spent the last few days working through R.F. Delderfield’s autobiography For My Own Amusement, a suitably obscure volume by an author who, after some popularity, appears to have been entirely forgotten by the reading public. But not by me. How could I forget him when I’m named after one of his heroines?\n\nIt’s always interesting to learn about the evolution of your favourite books. I found out that when he started to write A Horseman Riding By Delderfield had no intention of the character of Claire Derwent playing such a large part. But, as so often seems to happen to even the most determined authors, Grace, Claire’s rival for the hero’s affections, grew restless with married life and, in defiance of the happy life her creator had intended for her, left her husband and ran off to join the suffragettes, to the ultimate benefit of all involved.\n\nIt is entirely possible for an author to fall hopelessly in love with his heroines. It had happened to me before, of course, but never quite like this for there was something about Claire Derwent that combined all the physical and spiritual assets I most admire in women. She was pretty, buxom, possessed any amount of commonsense, was impulsively generous, she loved the Valley and shared Paul’s hatred of cities, and she was gloriously uninhibited whilst remaining feminine. I reveled in her. (p. 239)\n\nHow nice to be named after such a well-loved character (even if “at least ninety-five per cent of readers who have communicated their preferences to me are pro-Grace, thinking of poor Claire as a genial, complaisant cow!”)."
