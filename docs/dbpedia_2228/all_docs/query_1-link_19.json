        "text": "Deborah Jeane Palfrey (March 18, 1956 â€“ May 1, 2008)[1] (dubbed the D.C. Madam by the news media) operated Pamela Martin and Associates, an escort agency in Washington, D.C. Although she argued that the company's services were legal, she was convicted on April 15, 2008 of racketeering, using the mail for illegal purposes,[1][2] and money laundering.[2] Slightly over two weeks later, facing a prison sentence of five or six years, she was found hanged. Autopsy results and the final police investigative report concluded that her death was a suicide.[1][3][4][5]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n\n2 D.C. Madam scandal\n\n3 Death\n\n3.1 Suicide notes\n\n3.2 Speculation surrounding her death\n\n4 References\n\n5 External links\n\nEarly life\n\nPalfrey was born in the Pittsburgh suburb of Charleroi, Pennsylvania, but grew up in her teens in Orlando, Florida. Her father was a grocer. She graduated from Rollins College with a degree in criminal justice, and attended Thomas Jefferson School of Law, but did not graduate.[6] Working as a paralegal in San Diego, California, and later as a cocktail waitress,[7] she became involved in the escort business. Dismayed at how most services were run, including widespread drug abuse, she started her own company recruiting mostly women over 25.[6] In 1990 she was arrested on charges of pimping, pandering and extortion; after fleeing to Montana she was captured while trying to cross the Canadian border and brought back for trial. Following her conviction in 1992 she spent 18 months in jail.[6][8] After her release, she founded Pamela Martin and Associates.[9]\n\nD.C. Madam scandal\n\nIn October 2006, United States Postal Inspection Service agents posed as a couple who were interested in buying Palfrey's home as a means of accessing her property without a warrant.[7][10] Agents froze bank accounts worth over US$500,000, seizing papers relating to money laundering and prostitution charges.[10]\n\nAccording to the government's criminal charges, Palfrey's service recruited escorts using The Diamondback, an independent University of Maryland student newspaper, and the Washington City Paper. Her escorts charged as much as $300 per hour. Many have had professional careers. Palfrey continued to reside in California, and cleared some US$2 million over 13 years in operation.[6] Palfrey appeared on ABC's 20/20 as part of an investigative report on 4 May 2007.[11] In combination with Palfrey's statement that she had 10,000 to 15,000 phone numbers of clients, this caused several clients' lawyers to contact Palfrey to see whether accommodations could be made to keep their identities private.[12] Ultimately, ABC News, after going through what was described as \"46 lb\" [21 kg] of phone records, decided that none of the potential clients[13] was sufficiently \"newsworthy\" to bother mentioning.[14]\n\nThe scandal led to the resignation of Ambassador Randall L. Tobias from his State Department position and as the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Also named as a regular client was columnist and military strategist Harlan Ullman, creator of the concept of \"shock and awe\", of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Washington Times. Neither testified at Palfrey's trial.[15][16]\n\nOn July 9, 2007, Palfrey released the supposed entirety of her phone records for public viewing and downloading on the Internet in TIFF format, though days prior to this, her civil attorney Montgomery Blair Sibley had dispatched 54 CD-ROM copies to researchers, activists, and journalists. Senator David Vitter (R-LA) acknowledged on the night of July 9 that he had been a customer of her escort service.\n\nIn early 2007, Palfrey reacted to the suicide by hanging of Brandy Britton, one of her former escort service employees, by saying, \"I guess I'm made of something that Brandy Britton wasn't made of.\"[17]\n\nThirteen former escorts and three former clients testified at her trial.[18][19][20] The witnesses were compelled to testify, after being granted immunity from prosecution.\n\nOn April 15, 2008, a jury found Palfrey guilty of money laundering, using the mail for illegal purposes and racketeering.[1][2] Palfrey believed that contrary to the U.S. Attorney's Office lower estimate, she might spend six or seven years behind bars.[21] She faced a maximum of 55 years in prison.[22] Palfrey's death resulted in her conviction being vacated.[23]\n\nDeath\n\nOn May 1, 2008, Palfrey was found hanging in a storage shed outside her mother's mobile home in Tarpon Springs, Florida. Officials determined her death to be a suicide.[3] Police found handwritten suicide notes in the bedroom where she was staying, dated a week before her death. The autopsy and the final police investigation concluded her death was a suicide.[3][5][24]\n\nSuicide notes\n\nPalfrey's two handwritten notes were released to the public. In one of them, she wrote to her sister, \"You must comprehend there was no way out, I.E. 'exit strategy,' for me other than the one I have chosen here.\" In another, she described her predicament as a \"modern-day lynching\". She said she feared that, at the end of serving her sentence, she would be \"in my late 50s a broken, penniless and very much alone woman\".[24][25]\n\nSpeculation surrounding her death\n\nThe New York Times's Patrick J. Lyons wrote on the Times' blog, The Lede, that some on the Internet were skeptical that her death was a suicide.[26] News accounts at the time reported that her mother said she had \"no indication\" that Palfrey was planning to commit suicide,[21][27] though she later stated, \"I was afraid constantly [for her]. I watched her like a hawk.\"[28] Palfrey had stated in an interview on the Alex Jones show that she was not thinking of suicide and was motivated to present her case at trial. After investigating the crime scene, police found \"no new evidence [that] would indicate anything other than suicide by hanging\" nor did the final police investigative report released six months later.[3][5] The police stated that Palfrey's family believed the notes were written by Palfrey.[29][30] Palfrey sought to put her affairs in order before her death as she turned over the ownership of her high school alumni web site to a classmate,[31][32] had moved her possessions to her mother's home, whom she was staying with at the time,[21][33] and had transferred money from her accounts to her mother's.[5] The day before, she reviewed her pre-incarceration papers and watched videos of her deceased father.[3]\n\nJournalist Dan Moldea, who was working with Palfrey on a book, recalled that in a 2007 conversation, Palfrey told him, \"I am not going back to prison. I will commit suicide first.\"[21] He said her previous prison experience had traumatized her and she felt she couldn't do it again.[1][17]\n\nReferences\n\nD.C.
