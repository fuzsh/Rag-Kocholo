        "text": "Montgomery Blair Sibley is an American lawyer.[1][2] He is said to come from prominent Washington families on both his mother and father's side. His mother's family were the last owners of Blair House, a large townhouse across Pennsylvania Avenue from The White House, that now serves as a temporary residence to visiting diplomats and politicians.\n\nHe is known for defending Deborah Palfrey, the \"DC Madam\", in 2007-2008.[1] Blair wrote a book about Palfrey, and his defense of her, entitled \"Why Just Her: The Judicial Lynching of the D.C. Madam, Deborah Jeane Palfrey\".[2] Henry Vinson, author of Confessions of a D.C. Madam, wrote that Sibley \"had to contend with the feds judicial chicanery and sleight of hand.\".[3]\n\nIn May 2008 the Florida Bar Association suspended Sibley's right to practice law, in Florida, for three years.[4]\n\nHe is known for suing United States President, Barack Obama, asking him to show he was born an American - a requirement for being a US President.[5][6]\n\nSibley attempted to have Palfrey's list of clients unsealed, claiming the information it contained would be highly relevant to voters in the upcoming Presidential elections.[5][6][7][8] Radar Online reported that Sibley's efforts had triggered Presidential candidate Ted Cruz to explicitly deny he had been unfaithful to his wife.\n\nOn February 23, 2016, Sibley sued Richard W. Roberts, and his clerk, for failing to file his motion to have his gag order lifted.[9][10]\n\nGawker reported Sibley has asked permission to release some of Palfrey's phone records which were relevant to the upcoming 2016 election.[11]\n\nReferences"
