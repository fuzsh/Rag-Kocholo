David Vitter of Louisiana, who apologized in 2007 as his wife stood by his side.\n\nRead: Read: Bernie Sanders Surprises Stephen Colbert, Launches T-Shirts Out of a Cannon\n\nHer attorney was given a restraining order preventing him from releasing her phone records.\n\n“Time is of the essence -- given the significance of the upcoming political primaries and caucuses,” he wrote.\n\nWatch: United Airlines Pilot Arrested for Running Massive Prostitution Ring: Cops\n\nRelated Articles:"
