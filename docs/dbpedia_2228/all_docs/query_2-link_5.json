        "text": "ESCONDIDO – Deborah Jeane Palfrey, the woman recently accused byfederal prosecutors of running a Washington, D.C., prostitutionbusiness by phone from California, owns a house in Escondido, buther neighbors said last week that it provided her a quiet refuge,rather than a remote command post.\n\nPalfrey, also dubbed the “D.C. Madam,” revealed some of herclients’ identities on a much-hyped 20/20 show on ABC on Fridaynight.\n\nPalfrey’s next-door neighbor at her house, north of theEscondido Country Club, Lea Beaver, estimated that Palfrey visitedher Escondido house only a few days each month. Beaver said shedidn’t notice an unusual amount of traffic.\n\nPalfrey once invited Beaver over when Palfrey’s mother, Blanche,was visiting, she said.\n\n“She said she was an interior designer,” said Beaver, addingthat the idea made sense to her because each room inside Palfrey’shouse was painted a different pastel color.\n\nA federal grand jury indicted Palfrey in March onmoney-laundering charges connected with her alleged escort service.She previously pleaded guilty to pimping charges in the early 1990sin San Diego.\n\nCourt documents support neighbors’ views that Palfrey did notuse the Escondido house, which is now for sale, as part of herbusiness, called Pamela Martin and Associates. The business isdescribed on Palfrey’s Web site as a “high-end adult fantasy firm”that operated in the Washington, D.C., area for 13 years.\n\nCourt documents show that federal agents hauled stacks offinancial records and a computer from Palfrey’s primary residencein Vallejo after obtaining search warrants in October.\n\nBut they did not obtain search warrants for her home on the 1400block of Vaquero Glen.\n\nHer indictment says she had checks or money orders mailed to herat a post office box in Benicia, and had calls forwarded to hercell phone.\n\nHer attorney, Montgomery Sibley, did not return calls from theNorth County Times.\n\nRaccoons\n\nDeputy Secretary of State Randall Tobias resigned in April whenABC News, to whom Palfrey has given her phone records, asked himwhether he was a client.\n\nWhile other past clients in Washington may fear more revelationsfrom Palfrey, several of her Escondido neighbors had a more mundaneconcern last week: Raccoons have dug a hole in her shingleroof.\n\n“We covered it today with plastic,” Beaver said.\n\nThe neighborhood around Vaquero Glen seemed idyllic last week,with a few children riding their bicycles and skateboards in thestreet.\n\nPalfrey’s house has a “For Sale” sign in front, but all of thereal estate agent’s brochures are gone. The driveway, which iscovered with brown fluff from a nearby tree, makes it clear thatnobody has swept it for weeks.\n\nAs part of her indictment in March, federal authorities frozethe Vaquero Glen house along with Palfrey’s Vallejo home, bankaccounts and gold coins. The move requires court approval for asale and prevents the sale of the Escondido house from benefitingPalfrey while she is under indictment.\n\nEven so, Beaver said a real estate agent has been showing thehouse to possible buyers and one in particular seemsinterested.\n\nVaquero Glen residents said they learned of Palfrey’s legaltroubles when a property forfeiture notice was posted on her doorin October.\n\n“It was a pretty big surprise,” said Ann Boozer, who lives nextdoor to her on the other side.\n\nBut she said she had a clue something was happening in Septemberwhen she called Palfrey about a gardening issue and Palfrey toldher that her real estate agent would handle it, because she wasmoving to Germany.\n\nPalfrey made a brief visit to the Escondido house a few monthsago with a tow truck, Boozer said.\n\nPalfrey’s lawyers, in federal court filings, say that she hasleft the United States twice since October.\n\nSeveral neighbors said they had been interviewed by TV reporterson their front lawns and were tired of the attention.\n\nPalfrey bought the Escondido house in 2000. It still has amortgage and its most recent property tax bill has not been paid,according to county records.\n\nPalfrey grew up in Pennsylvania, attended college in Florida andmoved to San Diego in the 1980s, according to The AssociatedPress.\n\nShe previously owned a condominium on Mount Alifan Drive nearGenesee Avenue in San Diego, according to county records.\n\nShe was arrested by San Diego police in 1990 on charges ofpimping, pandering and extortion. She did not appear at trial butfled to the Canadian border before pleading guilty to pimpingcharges in 1992 in San Diego Superior Court and serving 18 monthsin prison, according to The Associated Press."
