        "text": "TOPICAL PAMPHLET COLLECTION, <1741>-<1996>\n\nVault B20, Unit 1\n\nEXTENT: <883> items (in <47> containers).\n\nORGANIZATION AND ARRANGEMENT: Organized into four series: Series I. Historical Topics; Series II. Individuals (As Author or Subject); Series III. Massachusetts Towns—History, Anniversaries, Description, etc.; and Series IV. Pamphlet Materials on Multiple Topics, Organized by Form. The four series are further divided into forty-seven subseries (see Series/Subseries Listing, below). Within each subseries, material in bound volumes is listed in the order in which bound. Loose items are arranged alphabetically by author or subject (as appropriate) and listed following the bound materials.\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT: A long-established, artificial, still-growing collection consisting largely of printed pamphlets, with articles, reprints, some ephemera, typescripts, photocopied manuscript material, and one set of slides (to accompany a typescript item) also included. Some of the items within were bound during the 19th century, some are loose. Covering a broad range of topics relating to American (and particularly New England) history, life, and thought, the Topical Pamphlet Collection provides background and context for the more specifically Concord-related materials in the Concord Free Public Library William Munroe Special Collections. The collection—not to be confused with the Concord Pamphlet Collection—includes <883> items, dating from <1741> to <1996>. Series I (Historical Topics) includes <352> items dating between <1741> and <1996>, Series II (Individuals, As Author or Subject) <300> items between <1761> and <1963>, Series III (Massachusetts Towns—History, Anniversaries, Description, etc.) <127> items between <1748> and <1991>, and Series IV (Pamphlet Materials on Multiple Topics, Organized by Form) <104> items between <1752> and <1940>. Some of the bound volumes include the occasional out-of-scope pamphlet. Moreover, there is some topical overlap of material in different subseries. Those researching a particular subject may consequently wish to consult multiple subseries in the item listing (see Series/Subseries Listing for a complete outline). Researchers interested in determining whether the collection holds specific pamphlet titles should search using keywords in the search box on the Selected Finding Aids page.\n\nSOURCES OF ACQUISITION: Multiple. Known sources of acquisition for particular items and copy-specific information suggesting previous ownership and sources of acquisition are noted in the item listing. Some bound volumes came from the collection of the Concord Town Library (predecessor of the Concord Free Public Library). A significant number of the pamphlets in other bound volumes were given by Edward Jarvis. More recently, loose items from the Concord Antiquarian Society gift and from the purchased Winnifred L. Sturdy Collection have been added.\n\nRESTRICTION ON PHOTOCOPY: Because of the fragile condition of much of the collection, photocopy is not permitted from most items in it. No photocopy is allowed from any of the bound volumes, or from any loose items in delicate or brittle condition. Some loose items in good condition and at no risk of damage may be photocopied (all photocopy of pre-20th century material to be done by staff). Consult Special Collections staff for additional information.\n\nNOTES/COMMENTS: The Topical Pamphlet Collection represents an enhanced, reorganized version of the former Basement Pamphlet Collection, in some areas streamlined and in others augmented by the addition of new materials. Former Basement Pamphlet numbers no longer apply.\n\nPROCESSED BY: LPW; finding aid completed 05/29/04.\n\nSERIES/SUBSERIES LISTING:\n\nTO VIEW THE ITEMIZED CONTENTS OF A SERIES OR SUBSERIES, CLICK ON THE LINE IN WHICH IT IS LISTED.\n\nSERIES I.
