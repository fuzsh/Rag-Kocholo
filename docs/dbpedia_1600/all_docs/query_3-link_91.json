        "text": "The China-Thailand railway project marks the construction of Thailand’s first standard-gauge double-track railway line, expected to be 873km-long. Work started the new railway project was broken on 19 December 2015 at Chiang Rak Noi Station in central Thailand’s Ayutthaya province signalling the official launch of the project.\n\nThe THB500bn ($12bn) project is being developed as part of a bilateral agreement between China and Thailand after a memorandum of understanding on railway co-operation was signed between the countries in December 2014.\n\nConstruction on the line is expected to start in May 2016 with completion planned within three years. Once complete, the line will connect with the China-Laos railway, linking China, Laos and Thailand.\n\nBoth passenger and freight trains will run on the line. The project will use a standard gauge (1,435m) with trains operating at speeds of up to 180kmph.\n\nChina-Thailand railway line route\n\nThe new railway line will span across Thailand and connect Vientiane in Laos and Kunming in China. It is also planned to reach Malaysia and Singapore in future.\n\nIt will be divided into four sections, in Bangkok-Kaeng Khoi, Kaeng Khoi-Map Ta Phut, Kaeng Khoi-Nakhon Ratchasima, and Nakhon Ratchasima-Nong Khai.\n\nThe first section will be a 133km line from Bangkok to Kaeng Khoi, the second section from Kaeng Khoi to Map Ta Phut over 246.5km, the third section from Kaeng Khoi to Nakhon Ratchasima will be a 138.5km line and the fourth section from Nakhon Ratchasima to Nong Khai will be connected by a 355km-long line.\n\nIt will run through ten provinces in Thailand, while the depot and operation control centre will be located in Chiangrak Noi district.\n\nPartnership between Thailand and China\n\nProject activities are divided between the two participating nations with Thailand acquiring land, completing environmental impact assessment and providing civil, mechanical and electrical (M&E) works for building services. Thailand will also supply concrete sleepers for track works and perform other ancillary works.\n\nChina conducted a feasibility study and detailed designing for the project. It will provide M&E works, including signalling and telecommunication systems, power supply, train control and track work. Tunnelling and construction of a long span bridge, establishing a new maintenance and training centre, and procuring rolling stock will also be China’s responsibility.\n\nChinese technology will be used in the project and 800 staff will be trained by the country.\n\nBenefits of the China-Thailand railway link\n\n\"It will reduce the cost of logistics and promote trade between China and ASEAN countries.\"\n\nThe project will ensure development of a railway network between China and ASEAN nations. It aims at extending cooperation in trade, investment, logistics, tourism, science and technology, culture and other aspects among ASEAN countries.\n\nIt will reduce the cost of logistics and promote trade between China and ASEAN countries. Thailand will also achieve the status of ASEAN’s transportation hub.\n\nThe railway line forms an integral part of the middle route of the Trans-Asia Railway network.\n\nKey players involved\n\nGlobal construction and mining equipment manufacturer, XCMG will provide machinery and equipment to assist with construction of the railway project."
