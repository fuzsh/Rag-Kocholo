        "text": "Chongqing - On the early morning of June 28th, the continuous beam of Huafute Bridge on the Chongqing-Yibin section of the Chongqing-Kunming high-speed railway was successfully rotated by 82.8 degrees and connected after a process lasting 90 minutes. This accomplishment marks the successful rotation of the final continuous beam on the Chongqing-Kunming section, laying a crucial foundation for the timely opening of the entire railway.\n\nHuafute Bridge, an integral part of the Chongqing-Kunming high-speed railway, spans 1,209.09 meters. As a dual-track super bridge, it is a key project on the Chongqing-Kunming section. China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group Co Ltd (CREEGC) designed it, and China Railway 11 Bureau Group Co Ltd (CR11) constructed it. The bridge stands out due to its complex structure.\n\n\"The rotation involved pier No. 3 of the Huafute Bridge. The continuous beam that was rotated measures 118 meters in length, 12.6 meters in width, and weighs approximately 8,000 tons,\" said the person in charge of Section One of the Chongqing-Kunming section at CR11.\n\nFacing numerous challenges like complex structures, difficult construction conditions, and tight schedules, the CR11 team adopted symmetrical pouring and casting along the existing railway to form the T-shaped structure, which was then rotated clockwise.\n\n\"The Chongqing-Kunming high-speed railway has four rotating bridges, including two on the Chongqing-Kunming section. Huafute Bridge is the last rotating bridge on this section, spanning the existing Xingluo Railway. The rotation during construction reduced the impact on the existing railway and minimized construction risks,\" explained LÃ¼ Xiangming, the head of the bridge department at the Chongqing Project Office of CREEGC.\n\nThe Chongqing-Kunming high-speed railway begins from Chongqing West Station and traverses Chongqing Municipality, Sichuan Province, Guizhou Province, and Yunnan Province before connecting to Kunming South Station."
