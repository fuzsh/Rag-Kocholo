        "text": "By plane\n\n[edit]\n\nThe new Changshui Airport is about 25 km north-east of the city area, and the old Wujiaba airport is no longer in use. Immigration can sometimes be congested. A taxi ride to the city centre will take approximately 30â€“40 minutes, at peak times you can expect to double this, as Kunming suffers major traffic congestion.\n\nThe airport is served by metro Line 6, which goes to the East Bus Station, where you can transfer to line 3, and go on to Tangzixiang, the interchange station for Line 2 in downtown. The hours of operation for line 6 are from 06:20-23:00 daily. Trains are 10 minutes apart. A ride to the central train station costs Â¥6 as of June 2018. If taking the metro to the airport, make sure to get off at Airport Center/Kunming Airport station, not Airport Front.\n\nAnother transport option are shuttle buses named Airport Express. There are six lines with different operation times (~08:00-00:00 for most popular lines), single ride costs Â¥25.\n\nYou can book air tickets from the Air China Office, Wallton Building, 448 Baoshan Jie (0871)3159171, from any number of travel agents in the King World Hotel a few blocks north of the train station on Beijing Lu, or from other agents around town. Tickets to Beijing are usually about Â¥1600 to 2000, to Hong Kong about Â¥1200 to 1500, with closer destinations getting ever cheaper as China's domestic carriers jostle for market share.\n\nBy train\n\n[edit]\n\nsouth of downtown serves destinations throughout China including Hekou, Nanning, Guilin, Chengdu (Sichuan), Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, and Xi'an.\n\nThree High Speed Rail lines come to the which is 20 km southeast of downtown, in one of the city's newly developed areas, and is connected with the city center by a subway line. The main high-speed lines connect Kunming to Guangzhou (9 hr) via Nanning, and to Shanghai (11Â½-12 hr, as compared to around 40 hr on a \"conventional\" train) via Guiyang, Changsha, Nanchang, and Hangzhou. High speed China-Laos Railway train to Vientiane and other cities in Laos also depart from here. Some trains continue directly to other major destinations on China's high-speed rail network, including Beijing (12 hr), Wuhan, Nanjing, Fuzhou and Xiamen.\n\nThe train service to destinations inside of Yunnan is still fairly limited, but growing fast. From Kunming Station, there is an overnight sleeper train to Xiaguan (Dali New Town) and Lijiang. Two more lines run via Jianshui and Mengzi to Hekou (on the Vietnamese border, where one can cross the border and take a Vietnamese narrow-gauge train to Hanoi) Another line runs via Jinghong and Pu'er to Mohan on the Laotian border and then crosses the border on its way to Vientiane. From the new Kunming South Station, you can go to cities along the Kunming-Nanning and Kunming-Guiyang high-speed lines, or take a non-stop \"commuter\" train to Yuxi.\n\nKunming's third rail terminal, , the main hub of Yunnan's formerly grand narrow-gauge network, is mostly of interests to rail fans. As of 2016, most of its building has been converted to a railway museum (see below), while the working passenger station occupies one of the rooms of the building. From there, 3 trains a day run to destinations within Kunming's metropolitan area, thus offering you an inexpensive way to ride a meter-gauge train.\n\nAll three stations are accessible by metro. If taking the metro to Kunming Railway Station, take Exit A from the metro station and follow the blue signs for \"è´­ç¥¨ä¹˜è½¦\" to get to the railway station.\n\nThe Chinese government has plans to turn Kunming into a hub for trains into Southeast Asia. A railway to Vientiane, Laos was completed in December 2021, with an extension of that line to Bangkok, Thailand under construction and scheduled to be completed in 2028. Cross-border passenger trains began operating between Kunming and Vientiane in April 2023. Lines to Mandalay and Yangon in Myanmar, as well as to Hanoi and Haiphong in Vietnam have been proposed, but construction has not started yet.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nKunming has moved its bus stations to the edge of the city in a bid to decrease traffic congestion. There are four bus stations for each of the cardinal directions (N,S,E,W). The general rule of thumb is you should go to the bus station in the direction you want to travel (e.g. if you are headed to Dali or Lijiang you will need to use the West Bus Station (Xibu Keyun Zhan); or if you are headed to Jinghong or Jianshui or Vientiane (Laos) you will need the South Bus Station).\n\nThe bus stations next to the train station are no longer long-distance bus stations.\n\nThe long-distance buses are excellent - cheap, reliable, comfortable, however, overnight sleepers can be cold, bumpy and dirty, check out the bus before you buy the tickets. People smoke in the bus in China, which is a big problem if the weather is cold and all bus windows are closed.\n\nThere are international departures to Laos and Vietnam, though these services are not always running. The bus to Laos goes all the way from Kunming to Vientiane, and cost approximately 550,000 kip or US$80 and last 38 hours if you go all the way. You can get off at stops in between like Luang Prabang or Udomxai (Oudomxai), and the cost of the ticket is comparative. From Vientiene to Luang Prabang, there are also VIP night buses with reclining seats as well as several daily local buses. There is a better chance of getting the slightly more expensive sleeper if you book the day ahead. The buses will make rest stops at local restaurants with standard Lao squat toilets. From Vientiane to Luang Prabang is about 12 hours, from Luang Prabang to Udomsai is about 5 hours, and climbs up a mountain road with severe potholes and many scenic villages clinging to the side of the road. From Udomxai to Kunming, is claimed to be about 19 hours but leaves at 12:30 and arrives about 09:30 the next morning. The road on the China side of the border is several lanes wide with many tunnels and smooth pavement. There are many freelance money changers on the China side of the border; there is no bank or currency exchange at Kunming's South Bus Station.\n\nThe journey to Vietnam is less arduous. Buses to Hekou, the border city on the Chinese side, leave regularly. There were night buses which allow you to leave Kunming at 20:00 and arrive at Hekou in time to cross the border as soon as it opens, but the bus only needs 7 hours now so times might have changed. The bus station in Hekou is about 3 km from the border crossing, and public buses go there. From there, you can take one of the many buses to Sapa, bus or train to Hanoi, or elsewhere. To reach the Eastern bus station from the railway station, you can take bus 60 (Â¥2, ~30 min).\n\nNote: Beware of con men who may help you to board the bus and then ask for a \"luggage fee\" or \"Chinese gasoline fee\". There is no such fee, the ticket price is all inclusive. They may present fake bus company ID cards or threaten to call the police if you express suspicion. Stay firm and refuse to pay and they will eventually leave.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nCity buses[dead link] costs Â¥1-2 per trip and cover most of the city. They operate from about 06:00 until late evening 21:30/22:00! (from first stop, which means, if you go from last stop, you can get bus also at 23:00 going back to first stop). They stop at every stop along their assigned route, but not all bus routes stop at all physical bus stops! Don't be surprised to see a bus driving right past a stop, as it may not be on their route. Stops are usually 500 m to 1 km apart. Bus drivers are lead footed, and often race each other, especially on the ring roads. They tend to stop suddenly too, so get a good hand hold. Some of the bus stops are at the sides of the road but some bus stops are in the middle of the road and appear to have been designed to provide maximum inconvenience and danger for passengers. There have been reports of pickpockets on crowded buses, especially just before \"Spring Festival\", when people need extra cash. It is possible to get a bus card, which reduces the cost per trip to Â¥0.90. The card itself costs Â¥20 and is bought at bus stations. Bus Nos. 52 and 67 run to the airport and may cost Â¥2 depending on the bus and hour. Also some other buses cost Â¥2. These usually go longer distances such as to \"villages\" around Kunming. Bus routes are marked on some local maps (purchased from street vendors or kiosks) but are not always accurate. You can check the following Chinese only website (bus 10) but at least there is a map with the bus stop and you can quickly change bus number in the URL (this only works for regular bus, not c62 and the like).\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nTaxis start at Â¥8. Make sure the driver uses the meter to avoid being scammed. Sometimes, taxi drivers will ask for a flat fee, but you should avoid this, because usually such flat fees are much more expensive than using the meter for rides within the city. As usual, care should be taken when traveling at night or long distances. Larger taxis cost more than smaller taxis. Also be aware that taxis are zoned and cannot access all areas. Don't be surprised if a taxi driver cannot take you to your destination as it may be outside their zone. Only certain taxis are allowed into the central areas at certain times. This is to allow all taxis a chance at the lucrative business areas. It is especially difficult to get a taxi around 18:30, when taxi shifts switch and drivers need to return their cars. A fuel tax of Â¥3 has been added to fares and is explained on a small sign on the dashboards of all taxis. Thus for each ride you'll have to add Â¥3 to the meter reading to calculate your actual fare."
