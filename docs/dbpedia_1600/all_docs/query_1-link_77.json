The two sides have yet to reach an agreement, with the government now looking at exploring other financing options. The Finance Ministry is in charge of the matter.\n\nState Railway of Thailand (SRT) governor Wutthichart Kalayanamitr said Thailand will be responsible for civil work and electricity supply, while China will deal with tunnel digging, rail bridge construction and track laying on hill slopes.\n\nThe governor said the eight-car CRH2G passenger trains will run on the line with a maximum speed of 250 km/h. A train can accommodate 613 people. HXD3B and HXD3C electric locomotives will be used to carry cargo trains at 120 km/h.\n\nAccording to the source, the trains could run from Bangkok to Nong Khai in 229.5 minutes at a speed of 180 km/h.\n\nIf the speed is geared up to 250 km/h, the trains could complete the route in 179.4 minutes.\n\nThe routes will extend from Nong Khai to Tha Na Laeng in Laos, the starting point of a 418km rail link between Laos and China. The railway goes from Tha Na Laeng through Vientiane and Luang Prabang and ends at Boten, the town bordering China.\n\nA Sino-Laos joint venture will build this Lao rail route, set for a late 2020 launch.\n\nThe lines will extend to China at Mohan in Yunnan province, the starting point of a 553km route leading to Kunming.\n\nOf the route, a 49.3km section will stretch from Kunming to Yuxi, for which construction is projected to wrap up this month. Another 504km section will run from Yuxi to Mohan.\n\nWork on this section started in August this year and will take six years.\n\nThe 4,500km central route stretching from Kunming to Singapore is only one of the three China rail plans under the Pan-Asia Railway Network.\n\nAnother is on the western front. This line will run trains from Kunming to Singapore through Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia with a total distance of 4,760km.\n\nThe final one is on the eastern side, running from Kunming, through Yuxi, Mengzi and leaving China at Hekou town bordering Vietnam.\n\nThey then pass through Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and end at Singapore with 5,500km in total distance.\n\nThe central route is the shortest and would handle cargo transport from Yunnan to Thailand, according to officials. The route is expected to spur trade between Thailand and China.\n\nThe eastern route, meanwhile, takes advantage of the existing railways in Vietnam.\n\nWhen the rail line between Yuxi and Mengzi is completed, the Sino-Vietnamese rail link will be established. This will be the the first part of the Pan-Asia Railway Network route to get off ground.\n\nThe western line offers access to the Dawei deep-sea port and industrial estate in Myanmar. In the future, Dawei will serve as a commercial hub linking the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.\n\nThe Pan-Asia Railway Network is likely to spur trade, cultural exchanges and economic development between China and the Indochinese region, the ministry source said.\n\nUnder the network, where three rail routes pass through Bangkok, the Thai capital will become the key strategic location in the region.\n\nChinese cargo can be loaded onto ships in the Gulf of Thailand at ports in Bangkok and Cambodia when the network is completed."
