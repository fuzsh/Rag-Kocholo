        "text": "The China-Laos Railway has handled 25,000 cross-border passenger trips since the launch of its passenger services on April 13, according to the Mohan entry-exit border checkpoint.\n\nDuring the period, the Chinese border town of Mohan in the country's southwestern Yunnan Province logged 14,156 inbound passenger trips and 11,752 outbound trips.\n\n\"We are very happy to travel on the international passenger train operated by the China-Laos Railway, which is comfortable and convenient,\" said Michael and Alysha Dragoo, a couple from the United States. \"We can take the train to many places in Yunnan and to Laos as well. It's really great.\"\n\n\"After the China-Laos Railway launched the international passenger train service, many Lao enterprises are willing to do business in China. My friends and I are going to China this time to check out the longan market,\" said Phoumy Sisaivong, a tourist from Laos.\n\nHistorical milestone\n\nThe China-Laos Railway, a landmark project of the Belt and Road Initiative, began operations in December 2021. The 1,035-km railway connects China's Kunming with Vientiane in Laos.\n\n\"The launch of the cross-border passenger service will be a historic milestone in the cooperation between Laos and China,\" said Vanxay Tavinyan, deputy chief of the Propaganda and Training Board of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee.\n\n\"The cross-border passenger train will make travel between Laos and China more convenient and boost cultural exchanges between the two countries. It will also facilitate foreign visitors' travel to and from China.\"\n\nEconomic boom\n\nAs the China-Laos railway becomes a crucial factor in facilitating travel, the Lao tourism authorities anticipate that around 368,000 Chinese travelers will visit Laos in 2023, up 21 percent from 2022.\n\nThe Lao government hopes to attract 1.4 million visitors in 2023, which is expected to generate over $340 million in revenue.\n\nThe tourism sector, a main source of foreign exchange reserves, is viewed as a key to bolster the Lao economy, Deputy Head of the Prime Minister's Office Thipphakone Chanthavongsa said at a meeting recently.\n\nRead More: China-Laos Railway starts cross-border passenger services\n\n(With input from Xinhua)"
