China, long before the Belt and Road Initiative was announced, formed a strategic plan for the construction of international railways. After the Chinese government formally proposed a strategy for Chinese high-speed rail to enter the overseas high-speed rail market in 2009, the activity of Chinese railway construction continues to grow. The PRC has accelerated the modernization of its internal railways and has created the world's most advanced high-speed rail system. The unification and standardization of the construction process of high-speed railways, rolling stock, infrastructure facilities and new technologies within the framework of the «Made in China» program has made it possible to create a unique world-class product - high-speed railways of the Chinese standard and enter the international market with it. The Belt and Road Initiative not only provided additional acceleration, but also created a theoretical basis for the «prestige» of participation in the initiative. As part of the Belt and Road Initiative, the internationalization of China's railway standards has yielded positive results. Many BRI rail projects have been completed and operational. As a rule, not only Chinese technical standards are used in construction, but also basic engineering materials, rolling stock, engineering and construction equipment, Chinese builders and maintenance personnel. But the PRC's energetic actions in promoting the Belt and Road Initiative cannot be called unimpeded. Many projects with Chinese participation remain until the time in the form of agreements or for various reasons, financial, domestic political, technical and reasons of \"lack of a common vision\" are postponed or suspended. The article examines the major rail construction projects with Chinese participation, completed and under construction, in Eurasia, Africa and South America.

Китай, задолго до объявления инициативы «Один пояс, один путь», сформировал стратегический план строительства международных железных дорог. С тех пор, как в 2009 г. китайское правительство официально предложило стратегию выхода китайских высокоскоростных железных дорог на зарубежный рынок высокоскоростных железных дорог, активность китайского железнодорожного строительства продолжает расти.

Унификация и стандартизация процесса строительства высокоскоростных железных дорог, подвижного состава, объектов инфраструктуры и новых технологий в рамках программы «Сделано в Китае» позволили создать уникальный продукт мирового уровня - высокоскоростные железные дороги китайского стандарта и выйти с ним на международный рынок.\n\nИнициатива «Один пояс, один путь» не только обеспечила дополнительное ускорение, но и создала теоретическую основу «престижности» участия в инициативе. В рамках инициативы «Один пояс, один путь» (BRI) интернационализация китайских железнодорожных стандартов дала положительные результаты. Многие железнодорожные проекты BRI были завершены и введены в эксплуатацию. Как правило, в строительстве используются не только китайские технические стандарты, но и основные инженерные материалы, подвижной состав, инженерное и строительное оборудование, строители и обслуживающий персонал из Китая. Но энергичные действия КНР по продвижению инициативы «Один пояс, один путь» нельзя назвать беспрепятственными. Многие проекты с китайским участием остаются, до поры до времени, в виде договоренностей или, по разным причинам, финансовым, внутриполитическим, техническим, а также по причинам «отсутствия общего видения» откладываются или приостанавливаются. В статье рассматриваются крупные проекты железнодорожного строительства с участием Китая, реализованные и строящиеся в Евразии, Африке и Южной Америке.

Unification and standardization of the process of construction of high-speed railways, rolling stock, infrastructure facilities and new technologies within the framework of the \"created in China\" program made it possible to create a unique world-class product - high-speed railways of the Chinese standard and enter the international market with it.\n\nChina, long before the announcement of the Belt and Road initiative, formed a strategic plan for the construction of international railways. The first foreign economic project of the PRC in the railway sector was the Tanzania-Zambia railway project, implemented in 1970-1976 by three participants: China, Tanzania and Zambia. The Tanzania-Zambia Railway (Tanzam) (Fig. 1) is the main transport route that passes through East Africa, Central and South Africa and is one of the largest foreign aid projects of China.\n\nThe railway starts from Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania in the east, and ends in the west at New Kapiri Mposhi in Zambia, has a length of 1860,5 km1. The cost of construction amounted to 406 million US dollars (the equivalent of 2,56 bil-\n\n1 Zhongguo Yuan Jian Tan Zan Telu (ФШШШМ-Ш'&.Ш) [China promoted the construction of the Tanzania-Zambia railway (in Chinese)].

The railway is the only way of mass transportation of copper ore from Zambia to the coast.\n\nLater, in 2014, Chinese funding made it possible to revive the idea of building a transcontinental railway in Africa, connecting the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, passing through the territories of Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia, reaching the hub port under construction in Tanzania (Fig. 1). The state company China Railway Construction (CRCC)2 completed repair and restoration work on the 1344-kilometer railway The railway Caminho de Ferro de Ben-guela (CFB)-running from Lobito via Benguela to Luau on the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Chinese company replaced the 1067 km narrow gauge track laid down in 1929 by Portugal, the highest colonial rulers of Angola, with a Chinese standard 1435 mm railroad3.\n\nFigure 1. Tanzania-Zambia railway (Раке 1) will be part Transcontinental railway in Africa (РаА: 2) Source: URL: [https://www.chronicle.co.zw/chinas-first-african-silk-road/, https://asia.nikkei.com]\n\nAnother Chinese railway construction project was carried out in 1990 - the railway connected Urumqi (PRC) with the border city of Aktogay in Kazakhstan, which was a prelude to the establishment of a railway connection between China and the countries of Central Asia (Fig. 2).\n\nBack in 1990, the railway connected Urumqi (PRC) with the border town of Aktogay in Kazakhstan, which became a prelude to the establishment of railway communication between China and the countries of Central Asia. A few years later, the railway began to run south and west along the branch of the western line of the Tarim Basin, and in 1999 the railway officially arrived in Kashgar (PRC)4.\n\n2 China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC).

If the strategy can be completed, the Eurasian continent and the entire African continent, where the super-economies of China, the European Union, Russia and India are located, will form a huge regional market community with the help of high-speed railways.\n\nThe China-Europe Trans-Eurasian Express (Chongqing-Duisburg) was successfully launched on March 19, 2011. The China-Europe train departs from Tuan-jetsun Station in Chongqing and leaves Alashankou in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, passing through Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland and the station Duisburg in Germany (Fig. 3).\n\nThe total distance is about 11 thousand km, and the travel time is about 15 days. Since then, Chengdu, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Suzhou, Guangzhou and other cities have sequentially opened container routes to Europe (Fig. 3). According to national customs statistics, as of May 18, 2021, the total number of China-Europe freight trains reached 38,000, carrying 3,4 million TEU of goods, to 151 cities in 22 European countries, and the logistics and distribution network covers the whole of Europe5.\n\n5 Zhongou Ban Le Jianjie Ji Fazhan Licheng (^^S^JM^&SMMS) [Introduction and development history of China-Europe Express (in Chinese)].

Chinese technical standards were used in the construction, basic engineering materials, rolling stock, engineering equipment and construction equipment are imported from China, and the total contract value of the project is $7,5 billion. In 2016, due to lack of funds and the crisis in Venezuela, construction was suspended6.\n\nIn 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed a basic strategic concept for the joint construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. The Belt and Road Initiative aims to connect Central Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia and even parts of Europe. It covers the Asia-Pacific region to the east and the European economic circle to the west, with almost 4,4 billion people in 64 countries with a combined economic value of about $21 trillion. 28 March 2015. The Chinese government has published a Vision and Action to Promote the Joint Construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road7, which comprehensively explains the vision, goals, objectives, mechanisms and actions of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Nine key Belt and Road transport projects planned by the Chinese Ministry of Communications: China - Laos - Thailand, China - Mongolia, China - Russia, China - Pakistan, China - Kyrgyzstan - Ukraine, China - Kazakhstan, China - Thailand - Afghanistan - Iraq, China - India, ChinaVietnam, basically built the Silk Road corridor, which connects transport channels within the country with the outside world.\n\nThe China-Mongolia-Russia economic corridor9 is divided into two routes: North China from Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei to Hohhot and then to Mongolia and Russia; Northeastern China from Dalian, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin to Manchuria and Chita in Russia. The construction of the SREB in China is associated with the transformation of the Trans-Siberian Railway of Russia and Mongolia's Steppe Route initiative [Hua Qian, 2015: 51-65], which contributes to strengthening rail and road communications, facilitating customs clearance and facilitating transportation, as well as developing cooperation in the field of transit traffic.\n\nCurrently, within the framework of the China-Mongolia-Russia economic corridor, international freight trains of the China-Russia-Europe railways have opened, such as Jin-Man-Europe, Su-Man-Europe, Yue-Man-Europe and Shen-Man-Europe (Fig. 4).\n\nThe New Eurasian Continental Bridge10 is an international rail transport route from the eastern coastal ports of China to the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. In the past, the domestic railway consisted of the Longhai and Lanxin Railways.

The new Eurasian continental bridge runs across the north-central part of the PRC from east to west, passing through 8 provinces and regions of Shandong, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang to Alashankou on the border between China and Kazakhstan on the Sino-Russian border. Three routes are planned from China to the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Currently, the new Eurasian Continental Bridge has become the main logistics link between China and Europe.\n\nFigure 4.

The Hungary-Serbia railway runs from Budapest, the capital of Hungary, to Belgrade, the capital of Serbia (Fig. 5), with a total length of 350 km, including 166 km in Hungary and 184 km in Serbia. The project is an electrified passenger-freight high-speed mixed line. The total length of the freight-passenger railway is 350 km, the design speed is 200 km/h. In 2020, two sections of the Hungary-Serbia railway were opened to traffic11. Once completed and opened for traffic, travel time will be reduced from the current 8 hours up to less than 3 hours. The next stage is Nis-Skopje. The Greek part of the railway covers two port centers: Thessaloniki and Athens.\n\nThe economic corridor China-Central Asia-West Asia - from Xinjiang, to the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean coast and the Arabian Peninsula, mainly involving the five Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan), Iran, Turkey and other countries.

A section of the railway connecting Thailand and the Chinese province of Yunnan is already close to commissioning. The total cost of the project is approximately 741,4 billion baht (approximately 143 billion yuan, 23,3 billion US dollars), two high-speed railways are planned to be built by 2021, which will be connected to the railways of China: Nong Khai-Mata (total length 737 km, planned investments 392,5 billion baht); Chang Hong Paci (total length 655 km, planned investment 348,8 billion baht)19.\n\nThe Sino-Thai High Speed Railway20 starts from Bangkok, Thailand in the south, and connects with the China-Laos Railway in the north to the Thailand-Laos border, forming a direct route to Kunming.

The southern part of the first phase runs from the capital of Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima, a large city in the northeast, with a total length of about 250 kilometers.\n\nThe Sino-Lao Railway21 (Fig. 8), is an important part of the middle corridor of the Trans-Asian Railway and runs from Mohan / Bodin on the China-Laos border in the north to Vientiane, the capital of Laos in the south, and passes through major cities such as Moon Sai, Luang Prabang and Vang Vieng in the south of Laos. The total length is 418 km, of which more than 60% are bridges and tunnels. The construction standard is the national railroad class I (PRC), single-track structure, electric traction, mixed passenger and freight transport, and a speed of 160 km/h. The total investment in the China-Laos railway project is about 37,4 billion yuan.\n\nOn May 15, 2018, the main construction began officially on the joint project promoted by China and Indonesia under the Belt and Road Initiative - Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail in Indonesia22 (Fig. 9).\n\n19 Fan Ya Telu, Gaote Weijiao Yu Quanqu Hua 4.0 4.0) [Trans-Asian\n\nRailway, High-speed Railway Diplomacy and Globalization 4.0 (in Chinese)].

Investments in construction amounted to $4.5 billion. The Chinese side owns 40% of the shares, while the Indonesian side owns 60% of the shares.\n\nIn 2020, the Indonesian government announced the expansion of its planned Java Hi-Speed Rail project, which has stalled due to political, financial and coro-navirus concerns. The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail project will be extended to Surabaya in the eastern part of Java (Fig. 9). The government also decided to include Japan in the project 25.With goals to drive the economic growth on the surrounding areas of the railway lines, government expects the construction of this fast train line to be completed between Jakarta and Bandung in 2021 and to Surabaya by 2022, and is expected to require a total investment of US $6,07 billion.\n\nWith goals to drive the economic growth on the surrounding areas of the railway lines, government expects the construction of this fast train line to be completed between Jakarta and Bandung in 2021 and to Surabaya by 2022, and is expected to require a total investment of US $6,07 billion.\n\nThe Middle East direction is also being developed by Chinese railway companies.

It is built using Chinese standards and Chinese hardware. Its total length is 751,7 km, the design speed is 120 km/h, the travel time from Djibouti to Addis Ababa has been reduced from 7 days for road transport to 10 hours, and the total investment is about 4 billion30 doll. It is the first overseas Chinese railway project to combine design standards, investment and financing, equipment and materials, construction, supervision and management of the entire production chain, and is a landmark achievement for the Belt and Road.\n\nThe strategic importance of the Yaji railway is very great, it is not only a transport line, but also an economic corridor that opened a large railway canal to the sea for Ethiopia, which effectively contributed to industrialization and urbanization along the railways.\n\nThe Mombasa-Nairobi Railway (Fig. 12) plays a leading role in the East African railway network.\n\nBack in May 2014, an agreement was signed to finance the Mombasa-Nairobi railway in the presence of leaders from East Africa, including the presidents of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan, as well as representatives from Tanzania, Burundi and the African Development Bank. In 2017, the Mombasa-Nairobi railway was commissioned with a standard (Chinese) gauge, 480 km long, worth about $3.8 billion and meeting Chinese standards31.

The events in neighboring Afghanistan in the summer of 2021 will probably also not contribute to the implementation of the Sino-Pakistani projects. The Venezuelan high-speed rail project, funded and technologically provided by China, was to be the first high-speed rail in South America. However, in the midst of a deep crisis in the Venezuelan economy, the project turned into a huge unfinished project45. The planned Malaysia-Singapore high-speed rail project has been suspended46.\n\nAs part of the Belt and Road Initiative, the internationalization of China's railway standards has yielded positive results. Many BRI rail projects have been completed and operational. China-made railway machinery and equipment are exported to more than 100 countries and regions of the world. The rapid development of China-Europe Express trains exceeded 30,000 trains by the end of September 202047, a remarkable achievement in the construction of the Belt and Track. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, China-Europe Express has been instrumental in helping restart operations and production and stabilize the international supply chain.\n\nЛитература / References\n\n1.
