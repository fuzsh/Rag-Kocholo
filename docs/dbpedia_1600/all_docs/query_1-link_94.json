        "text": "Synopsis\n\nChinese Premier Li Qiang, who is on a three-day visit to Malaysia, said Wednesday the plan would make the central line of a proposed Pan-Asia Railway, running from Kunming in China to Singapore, a reality. \"This will better promote the construction of new international land and sea trade corridors, enhance regional connectivity, and deepen the building of the ASEAN community,\" Li said.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Beijing said it was willing to study a plan to connect Malaysia's $10-billion East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) to other China-backed railway projects in Laos and Thailand, potentially expanding Beijing's Belt and Road initiative across Southeast Asia.\n\nChinese Premier Li Qiang, who is on a three-day visit to Malaysia, said Wednesday the plan would make the central line of a proposed Pan-Asia Railway, running from Kunming in China to Singapore, a reality. \"This will better promote the construction of new international land and sea trade corridors, enhance regional connectivity, and deepen the building of the ASEAN community,\" Li said.\n\nLi was speaking during a ground-breaking ceremony at a construction site for the ECRL - a 665-km (413-mile) railway that will link peninsular Malaysia's east and west coasts by the end of 2026.\n\nMalaysia's government said in March it would consider extending the China-backed project to its border with Thailand. Li is on the third leg of a trip that has included New Zealand and Australia, as China looks to expand influence and investments in the Asia-Pacific region amid an ongoing rivalry with the United States.\n\nHe met Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in the administrative capital of Putrajaya, following his arrival in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday for a visit to mark 50 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries.\n\nAfter Wednesday's closed-door meeting, Li and Anwar witnessed the signing of more than a dozen pacts, including renewing a five-year programme to collaborate in areas such as trade and investment, agriculture, manufacturing, infrastructure and financial services, a statement after the meeting showed. The programme, which will expire in 2028, was first introduced in 2013.\n\nFRESH DURIAN IMPORTS\n\nChina also agreed to allow imports of fresh durian from Malaysia after it meets sanitary requirements, the statement added. Malaysia, one of the world's biggest producers of the fruit, was earlier allowed to ship only the whole frozen fruit and its products to China, with exports valued at 1.19 billion ringgit ($253 million) in 2023.\n\nThe two nations also vowed to review visa-free travel arrangements set to expire in coming months. China has been Malaysia's largest trading partner since 2009, and the foreign ministry said total trade was valued at $98.9 billion in 2023.\n\nAnwar has pledged to remain neutral on China's geopolitical rivalry with the United States.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nAfter a long stretch of slump, whatâ€™ll set the course for the hero of 100 cc bikes\n\nThe many gaps in conflict of interest allegations against Sebi chief, other Indian regulators\n\nFour ingredients that helped Mahindra Thar leave Maruti Jimny and Jeep Wrangler behind\n\n10 financial stocks that are trending in anticipation of rate cuts\n\nIndian investors are diverging from those in advanced markets.
