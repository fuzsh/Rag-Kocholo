        "text": "Michael Chang received his PhD degree at the University of Toronto in 2005, under the supervision of Dr. Grant W. Brown, studying DNA damage response pathways using high-throughput functional genomics. As a postdoctoral fellow, first in the lab of Dr. Joachim Lingner at the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) in Lausanne, then in the lab of Dr. Rodney Rothstein at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York, his focus shifted to the maintenance of telomeres by telomerase and homologous recombination. He joined ERIBA as an group leader in 2012 and was awarded a Vidi grant from the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research in 2013. His laboratory is focused on dissecting the cellular mechanisms that maintain genome integrity and telomere function."
