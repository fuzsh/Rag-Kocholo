        "text": "Michael Chang played professional tennis from 1988-2003 and, in 1989 at the age of 17, he became the youngest male player in tennis history to win a Grand Slam event as he emerged victorious in that year’s French Open. His win also made him the first American male to win the French Open since 1955 when Toby Trabert captured the title. In total for his career, Chang won 34 singles events and climbed to #2 in the world rankings in 1996. In 2008, Chang became a member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 1989 French Open proved to be Chang’s only Grand Slam title but he came significantly close at the 1995 French Open, 1996 Australian Open and 1996 U.S. Open when he finished runner-up in each competition. Among Chang’s other wins came at the 1990 Canadian Open and 1993 and 1994 Cincinnati Masters. He also won the Indian Wells Masters in 1992, 1996 and 1997.\n\nChang also represented the United States in international play. He was an integral part of the team that won the 1990 Davis Cup and 1993 World Team Cup. He additionally competed in the 1992 and 2000 Olympics. After his playing career ended, Chang turned to coaching and has notably coached Japanese star Kei Nishikori. Chang was born on February 22, 1972 in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nSports Speakers 360 has been the industry leader in booking athletes and sports speakers for over 20 years.
