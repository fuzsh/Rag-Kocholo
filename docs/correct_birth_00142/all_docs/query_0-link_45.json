        "text": "\"This mural is big – not because of its four-story size – but because we did it together with teamwork and a common goal.\"\n\nHOBOKEN, NJ — An effort to finance the arts in Hoboken recently got its first shot in the arm with the creation of a mural featuring tennis icon Michael Chang.\n\nHoboken and Hudson County officials unveiled the hand-cut and stencil-spray painted artwork earlier this month, which graces a wall above the Columbus Park tennis courts. The mural, produced by local artist Ricardo Roig, depicts the Hoboken-born winner of the 1989 French Open in an action-packed pose.\n\nAccording to Hoboken officials, the mural is the first piece of public art to be funded under an executive order from Mayor Ravi Bhalla last year. That order declares that all city bond ordinances shall be drafted to include a provision dedicating one percent towards public art installations.\n\nDuring the May 10 unveiling, Bhalla also announced the launch of an advisory arts commission made up of residents and local artists that will help choose public art projects to be created through the new fund.\n\nAny resident or artists interested in serving on the committee are encouraged to apply by emailing a resume and letter of intent to Geri Fallo at gfallo@hobokennj.gov, city officials stated.\n\n“Michael Chang exemplifies Hoboken the spirit of firsts, as the first Asian-American to win a Grand Slam tournament,” Bhalla said. “His grit and determination on the tennis court is artfully depicted by Ricardo, whose work is a source of pride and inspiration for our city. I thank Ricardo for initiating this mural, and his contributions which reflect the diversity of our community.”\n\nAccording to the mural’s creator, the artform is “larger than life.”\n\n“This mural is big – not because of its four-story size – but because we did it together with teamwork and a common goal of sharing color, wonder and Hoboken's history,” Roig said.\n\nDon’t forget to visit the Patch Hoboken Facebook page here.
