        "text": "Interested in hot food takeaways, spatial planning and health? üçî üçü üçï ü•ì üìÉ This health issue and policy intervention has increased attention over the last few months. A workshop is taking place on Monday 16th September at The Moller Institute, Cambridge. The University of Cambridge MRC Epidemiology Unit has led a consortium of researchers from University of Exeter, University of Oxford, University of Hertfordshire and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, U. of London over the last 3 years to evaluate the effectiveness of planning policy to regulate takeaway food outlets for improved health in England. Funded by the NIHR (National Institute for Health and Care Research), there is very interesting findings relating to health and economic impact, public acceptability and retailer responses to local plan policies. Attend this final dissemination workshop to discuss the results of the evaluation of the impact of takeaway management zones (or ‚Äòexclusion zones‚Äô), and for the launch of the implementation-support toolkit. I will be giving an opening strategic overview on the issue, its policy relevance over the years, and progress of national/ local planning interventions. It should be interesting and relevant for those in local planning and health systems. So register your attendance here - https://lnkd.in/ezkYGR6i #healthyplanning #foodenvironment #hotfoodtakeaways #publichealth #spatialplanning https://lnkd.in/et57k-eh\n\nThere is a lot to take in from the Chancellor's speech earlier (https://lnkd.in/eaH54wcn). It is all about leveraging the power of the planning system to deliver housing, infrastructure, jobs and grow the economy. There is a lot of expert commentaries already and sector reactions so definitely read them first (see Nicola Gooch Zack Simons Simon Ricketts Royal Town Planning Institute et al) Here is my contribution from the public health lens to ensure we don't forget about planning for a purpose: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Reform the national planning policy framework: We have expected a focused update pre-GE and the work is accelerated post-GE. So in a way we have been/ haven‚Äôt been prepared for it. There may be opportunities to include some immediate high priority issues on health in this immediate or future update. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Wider planning reform to deliver infrastructure and attract: Make the case that healthy population and places are key to delivering good growth. Opportunities to set out clear and consistent health considerations, so this is where the local plans come in. Private sector like certainty, clarity and consistency and a level playing field. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Restoring housing targets: Councils will be expected to find (more) land for housing, including through greenbelt reviews. There is a pro-development position being taken. Opportunities for health to be more involved in the site allocation processes. Good housing in the right location is needed than good housing in the wrong location. Bad housing in bad location is just.. bad.. 4Ô∏è‚É£ 1.5 million new homes: The private sector will continue to build most of our housing, with housing associations and LAs lagging a lot behind. So this is why developers should be considered an important partner and commercial determinant of health and work to address this. Opportunities here to do more on health-focused local design codes and guides. 5Ô∏è‚É£ New Towns programme: There are opportunities for a Health (in) New Towns (Mark II) to build on the national lesson from the NHS England HNT programme (https://lnkd.in/ePHkeiCm). TCPA doing some great work in this area. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Finally but not least, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner will write to local planning authorities to expect universal coverage of local plans. There has already been ongoing reforms to make local plans simpler and quicker. Opportunities for public health teams to add value to support quicker preparation and getting health across all policies but also explicit health objective/ policy in each local plan. The current baseline is not great (See my research https://lnkd.in/gu252hnT). This will be a chance to really improve upon the baseline #healthyplanning #healthyplaces https://lnkd.in/eaH54wcn\n\nAnother (further) review of the planning system in progress? As part of my work and PhD I am working on a systematic literature review of publications (academic and non-academic) that sought to identify the barriers, challenges and opportunities of the English planning system. Many that many of you will be familiar with already. My starting point was: has anyone actually systemically reviewed all the reviews over the last 10 years or so that have influenced planning reform in England? My hypothesis is/ was: probably not. Just look at publications from parliamentary select committees, government and non-government supported commissions, consultancy reports and academic research. The aim is to find common themes from these publications that can help frame any public health contribution to planning without contrasting too much with these themes. In another words, advocating planning for health interventions in the context of planning reform/ deregulation. I will report back in due course. But in the meantime, working off the Guardian article, let‚Äôs not forget planning for quality not just quantity, planning for a reason not just any reason, and planning for the long term net gain. https://lnkd.in/eztr2eSz\n\nThe summer forum of the planning healthy places workforce took place on Thursday 4 July. Following from a workshop back in March, this time we brought together a wider cohort of participants from local authorities, private sector and academia from, as expected, different professional backgrounds. A couple of photos to share and love the vibe and chemistry among the whole group. üëã So thank you everyone. A shout-out to great representation from PUBLIC PRACTICE Associates (unintentionally) as well! Planning, designing and maintaining housing and healthy places is everyone's business. Let's remember that when we embark on the new Govt's agenda. Key points were made that we know what we need to do, we have been here before so we need to really make it stick this time round. But there still isn't the inter/ trans-disciplinary step-change needed. That's why I am keen to focus on the workforce, on the professionals, on those in the educational pipeline on the skills/ competencies, and even personality traits that may be necessary to carry the agenda forward. But I won't over-complicate and over-professionalise the agenda. I end by just stating the obvious: let's keep this conversation going and continue mapping progress a small step at a time. #healthyplanning #healthyplaces #workforcematters #spatialplanning #publichealth\n\nNew developments are usually connected to a community heating scheme, like mine. We have no choice on providers or selecting the best tariff. Unit charge and heating service charge will increase in the next year without explanation. This is the issue of many new developments with communal amenities such as heating schemes, public and resident-only open spaces, play spaces, resident-only gyms, concierge services and so on (often they are not opt-out options) that are paid for through service charges. Service charges can affect affordability. Service charges are paid for usually in a lump sum than monthly direct debit and can be a hefty sum. So for those planning, designing, building and managing developments, always be mindful of who pays, who benefits over the long term. Nothing is free and someone has to pay and it‚Äôs often the homebuyer, leaseholder, landlord or tenant.\n\nOver the last few months, I have been doing a collab with geospatial guru Dr. Matthew Hobbs from University of Canterbury (NZ). ü§ù Matt is now co-director of UC's Geohealth Lab and I first met him, before he went down-under, while doing my MRes at Leeds Beckett back in 2017/18-ish. The starting point was the results of my #PhD health census of local plans in England published earlier in the year (see https://lnkd.in/gu252hnT). We prepped the results for mapping across most of the health census parameters. It's interesting how perspectives change from when looking at numbers to maps! As a teaser see the screenshot. We then prepped the results more and did some geospatial analyses against some key indicators (well Matt did!). We are now taking the collab outcome to publication so will share the link as and when it is accepted and published! I am grateful for Matt's time, expertise and patience as I am not familiar with geospatial methods and tools at all. It has certainly benefitted me and my PhD journey. The outcomes show the power of collaboration even on a small scale. But also they will have important research, policy and practice implications as we grapple with the geography of planning for health. The methods are vastly transferrable across nations and planning systems. There is significant potential to upscale what we started through further resources, funding and support. Finally, for those interested in geospatial mapping and health, University of Canterbury (NZ) has an online course developed by its GeoHealth Lab (See https://lnkd.in/g86rsWEk). #healthyplanning #spatialplanning #publichealth\n\nCongratulations to London Borough of Hounslow as the winner of TheMJ 2024 Awards for a Whole Council Approach to Tackling Health inequalities supported by the The Health Foundation. It was an honour to be on the judging panel and to know all the impactful work councils are doing up and down the country. Also congratulations to the two Highly Commended - Durham County Council and West Northamptonshire Council. They along with the Finalists and other entries demonstrate the art and science of the possible and cross council working when it comes to tackling local health issues, and making an impact. Not to mention the well known host Anita Rani who did a fantastic job sharing her first- hand experiences with local government, entertaining and introducing the Finalists and Winners."
