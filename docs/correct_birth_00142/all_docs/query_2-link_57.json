        "text": "Workers Compensation Paralegal\n\nMichael studied Political Science with a track in Paralegal studies at the University of Louisville. When offered an intern position with the Karl Truman Law Office in June of 2013, he was hired full time shortly afterward as a legal assistant and was promoted to paralegal in the litigation department. Michael plans to go to law school. With his prior experience in the technology field, Michael has had the opportunity to assist the youth and elderly in Louisville communities with the growing advances in technology. This would include volunteering at an assisted living facility to help patients connect with family and friends through social media and help the younger generation with the growing hardware advances in technology. As Louisville, Kentucky resident, he enjoys spending time with his family, cycling, and photography. His favorite quote comes from Amelia Earhart: “The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity.”\n\nDisclaimer: Kentucky does not certify specialties in legal fields.
