        "text": "I had spinal stenosis surgery back in 2008 that lasted until this year 2015 when my back was always in extreme pain. I got by increasing my Celebrex dosage to two a day that worked but I know it was getting worse. I went in search of a new doctor since I wasn't to happy with the last place I went to. I would have a 1:00 pm appt. and if I was lucky I would get in by 2:30. I had the same experience trying to get refills on my prescriptions. I couldn't be happier when the angels of the internet sent me to Dr. Michael Chang. He looked at my MRI and told me that it looked like a jig saw puzzle with pieces missing. He ran every kind of pre-surgical testing and set up the surgery for July 28, 2015. I went to Scottsdale Healthcare on Shea at 5:30 am. He was right that I wouldn't like him after the surgery. The surgery in 2008 I was pretty much running around after 4 weeks but this one was so much more involved. My itemized bill from the hospital told me that they used 120 parts in my surgery, I have a feeling the airline security is not going to like me anymore. Well here I am 1 month plus 3 days out, I still have quite a bit of pain but working with my therapist its coming around. He thinks I will be getting rid of the walker in the next week. I see Dr. Chang on Sept. 9 which is my first visit since the surgery. I'm hoping that I can walk in without the walker. I'm hoping that I will soon be back on the floor playing with my dog and grandchildren. They told me 3 months with a lot of restrictions then they will begin to lighten, I will listen to them and follow the rules because I don't want to see pain ever come back. Thank you Dr. Chang and your wonderful staff.\n\nI currently work for the Fire Department and my quality of life before my injury was very active. I hiked, biked, fished, went to the gym, golfed, and spent many days with my kids teaching softball, volleyball, and raising animals. I injured my lower back leaving me with severe nerve tension and electric pain down my left leg. I could barely stand, walk, or even sit for a long period. My life was miserable and depression started to kick in. I was consuming over the counter pain relief medications just to get through each day and remained on our couch for several months. My position of comfort was legs lifted on the arm rest of our couch and my back on the seat cushion. Ice packs and heat treatments seemed to make some of the pain go away.\n\nDuring this miserable experience, I encountered 3 epidurals and probably consumed 2 prescriptions of ibuprophen without any relief. Now you can predict what changes my health was making…. YES, 20 pounds heavier from the steroid injections and not being active at all!\n\nDr. Chang and his staff at SONORAN SPINE completely gave me and my family back my lifestyle. I had a microdiscectomy L4,L5 with amazing results! The procedure was unbelievable! I was walking the same day and woke up the next morning without any pain. Some soreness from my small ¾ inch incision, but other than that, I was pain free. Skeptical at first, but realized that the daily pain I was in, something had to be done. My recovery was fast and I was recently medically cleared by Dr. Chang to resume my regular lifestyle and I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it. Since the surgery I’ve enjoyed vacation with my family, fished with my father and brother, renewed my gym membership, active in my kids life, and more importantly, my wife has her loving happy husband back! PAIN FREE!!!\n\nThank you Dr. Chang for making this a great experience for me and my family.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDear Dr. Chang,\n\nMy wife, Anne suffered for a number of years with continuous back pain. She could not walk any distance without using walking sticks or holding on to me. On the recommendation of friends and chiropractor, we visited two surgeons. One was in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and the other one was in Phoenix, Arizona. Both had specialists that performed back surgery. One surgeon felt that Anne's condition was beyond his specialty. The other surgeon, Dr. Justin Field, very well-known in the Phoenix area, reviewed the x-rays and concluded with regrets that he could not do the surgery. He then referred us to Dr. Chang at the Sonoran Spine Center as he felt confident that Dr. Chang could do the surgery because this type of a back condition was his specialty.\n\nOn May 7, 2014, we visited with Dr. Chang. He took a number of x-rays and after examining them told us that he can do the surgery and assured us that when done, Anne will be walking straight. We were elated with the good news. He spent almost an hour discussing the surgery which impressed us as not all doctors take enough time with patients.\n\nOn January 6, 2015, Anne underwent surgery at the outstanding Scottsdale Shea Medical Center. The surgery lasted eight hours. Our son and I were given a progress report every two hours by Dr. Chang's Assistant, Mara. This was so nice and unique to be given these updates as it was nerve wracking as it was to be sitting in the waiting room for 8-10 hours but to know how she was progressing was most assuring.\n\nThe next morning after surgery on January 7, 2015 at 6:30 a.m., we found Anne sitting in the chair and ready to go for her first walk. We were amazed how straight her back was. It seemed that she grew in height as prior to the surgery she could only walk bent forward. After four days, Anne was transferred to the amazing facility of Scottsdale Rehab Hospital to undergo rehab. She ended up spending only 12 days there.\n\nOn February 16, 2015, Anne had her first visit since her surgery with Dr. Chang. She walked on her own into the Sonoran Spine office with no walker or walking sticks. Today three months since her surgery, she walks daily up to two miles, washes laundry, cooks, and cleans with no problem.\n\nMay God Bless Dr. Chang, his assistant Pierre, Mara and all of the friendly and professional staff. You have given Anne a new lease on life as every day Anne is better and better.\n\nWe have already recommended Dr. Chang to our friends in Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio, and Arizona.\n\nDr. Chang, you are the Best!\n\nI don't know if this is the proper venue on your website to express my thanks to Dr. Chang and his staff for the excellent care and consideration I have received, and continue to receive, following my lumbar spine fusion on February 5th.\n\nEveryone I came into contact with at Sonoran Spine in Mesa before, during and after my surgery have been wonderful people to work with.\n\nThe professionalism and courtesy with which everyone from the front office through to Dr. Chang, have been first class.\n\nI would like to especially thank Pierre, Dr. Chang's Medical Assistant, who has been, and continues to be, extremely responsive to my various post-surgical inquiries and requests.\n\nI will without a doubt recommend Sonoran Spine to any of my friends or family who may need spinal surgery in the future.\n\nThanks again to all of your staff.\n\nI wanted to send this in pertaining to some of your staff that were involved in my scheduling, assistance, and Dr. Chang that performed the surgery on my lower back.\n\nNow that I'm back to normal, and have returned to work, I first wanted to thank Lori Lobell, for her support, always returning my calls, usually before the end of that day, and for rescheduling me for surgery after I suffered a blood clot which kind of postponed my first surgery for 3 months. She was awesome to deal with, as busy as she always sounded, she deserves a big shout, Thank you Lori !!\n\nNext the Doctors assistant, Pierre, great guy to have to deal with, dealing with him, I felt he was generally concerned for my well-being, Thank you Pierre.\n\nNot to leave the main man last, but Dr. Chang, a true professional at his craft, from my first consultation, to finally the BIG day for me, and then he stopped by the morning after prior to my discharge to check on me, I thought was just incredible, and very thoughtful of him to do that.\n\nThank you Dr. Chang !!\n\nI look forward to my year end appointment with the Doctor.\n\nI want to thank Dr. Michael Chang and his P.A Mara Immediato. Dr. Chang did a Lumbar spine fusion and laminectomy revision on me August 7th. I was suffering debilitating chronic pain for 8 years. I had been in pain management for over 5 years. I had been to 5 surgeons and they all said not to do the fusion surgery as it wouldn't help me. The pain management I was with did every procedure they could do to try relieve my pain, all failed.\n\nI'm so grateful to Dr. Chang for believing that the fusion would help me, he even told me he was 80% sure he could get me to 50% pain relief, and he was right! I feel so much better! I'm 6 weeks post op and I feel better than I have in 8 years. Thank you Dr. Chang and Mara for changing my life for the better! I highly recommend Sonoran Spine!"
