nice pottery i didn’t know you meant boys\n\ni did not talk to boys who looked like you that just wasn’t a thing\n\neli manning v. unknown named agents\n\nschoolhouse karaoke\n\nIf you want proof that this country is going to shit, look no further than Twitter, where teachers beg. I never did that. I mean, we weren’t flush, but we weren’t scrounging for crayons and paper clips. I taught in the days when overcrowding and underfunding were less extreme. I remember neat rows of desks, checkered floors, tiles haphazard as if laid in a hurry. My colleagues cynical and jaded, but they never stopped caring about the kids.\n\n//\n\nIt comes back to me in snippets.\n\nPlumes of pot smoke rolling across the room.\n\nRed Solo cups strewn about.\n\nYour obsession with Point Break, quoting it all the time.\n\nYou said: If you want the ultimate, you’ve got to be willing to pay the ultimate price. It’s not tragic to die doing what you love.\n\nI looked back at you, thinking how adult you sounded, how mature you appeared, until I remembered.\n\nI quoted the movie back to you: You know nothing. In fact, you know less than nothing. If you knew that you knew nothing, then that would be something, but you don’t.\n\nI turned away.\n\n//\n\nI called you Encyclopedia Brown, because you were so smart.\n\nYour mom told me to take care of you.\n\nIn broken English, she said: no other teacher has cared this much.\n\nI looked down, afraid.\n\nI remember your blue oxford shirt, the one with the pony. You saved up for it.\n\nThe first time you wore it, I thought, no shirt has ever looked this good.\n\nThat Christmas I bought you a plaid pajama set.\n\nYou told me you were too afraid to wear it, didn’t want to mess it up.\n\nThat time you made me a fried sandwich.\n\n1 small ripe banana\n\n2 slices white bread\n\n2 scant tablespoons smooth peanut butter\n\n2 tablespoons butter\n\nElvis ate this, you said.\n\nYou are my king, you said.\n\nI swear the peanut butter still lingers in my mouth.\n\nYou had a swallow tattoo on your leg, would joke about seamen.\n\nYou held me and told me you knew, but didn’t care.\n\nYou kissed me gently.\n\nWe breathed in and out together.\n\nOne day you asked: why is it so hard to find something I’m good at.\n\nYou tried the sports thing. You were okay, you thought, but not good enough to keep playing.\n\nI bought you your first guitar, signed you up for lessons. You took to it like a fish to water.\n\nI saw a future for you in music. Your writing got better and better, and you had incredible lyrical ability, words leaping off the page.\n\nYou channeled your anxieties and hopes and dreams into your music. I was so proud of you.\n\n//\n\nYou stayed behind after the bell rang, feet shuffling like some exotic dance.\n\nYour expression searching and uncertain.\n\nFinally you said: don’t you think there is this tension between us?\n\nTension?\n\nYeah.\n\nIs that a bad thing?\n\nI guess tension has such a negative connotation.\n\nIf it matters that much to you, I said, I love your hair. It’s beautiful.\n\nFace beaming, you turned to leave, almost skipping.\n\n//\n\nAt some point I decided that things had gone too far.\n\nI figured you would be fine without me telling you that you were talented, that you would go places so long as you kept working.\n\nI thought, even without me egging you on, you would never give up.\n\nThis was before I learned that men are just walking sacks of insecurities.\n\nWhen I told you I was leaving the district, you reacted poorly.\n\nYou started pacing listlessly, deflated.\n\nI watched your Adam’s apple bob up and down.\n\nI wanted to kiss it so badly.\n\nYou took your shirt off, softly, shyly, insisted I would miss you.\n\nYour body lithe, steely like cables bound together.\n\nI soaked up every tender molecule, thinking: I can’t take my eyes off you. I can’t take my eyes off you.\n\nYou asked: How do I make you care. How do I make you care.\n\nThe last thing you ever said to me was: what if I never see you again.\n\n//\n\nI thought you were lost, gone forever.\n\nI pushed you out of my mind.\n\nThen one day you reappeared.\n\nWhat I saw first: the solitary guitar pick, gleaming, mother-of-pearl.\n\nThen the words:\n\nU changed my life\n\nU really did\n\nThank u\n\nThank u\n\nThank u\n\nI miss u\n\nI miss u\n\nI miss u\n\nMichael Chang hopes to win the New Jersey Blueberry Princess pageant one day.
