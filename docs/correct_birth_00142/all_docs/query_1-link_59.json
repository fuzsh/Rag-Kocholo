        "text": "Michael Te-Pei Chang (born February 22, 1972) is an American retired professional tennis player. He is the youngest male player in history to win a Grand Slam, winning the 1989 French Open at 17 years and 95 days old. Chang won a total of 34 top-level professional singles titles, was a three-time Grand Slam runner-up, and reached a career-best ranking of world No. 2 in 1996. Since he was shorter than virtually all of his opponents, he played a dogged defensive style utilizing his quickness and speed.In 2008, Chang was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. He has coached Kei Nishikori since 2014.\n\nBio from Wikipedia - See more on en.wikipedia.org Text under CC-BY-SA license"
