        "text": "The newest Chinese television star wrapped up filming a few weeks ago, flew back to Southern California and fed his tropical fish.\n\nHe went house hunting with his new bride, headed to his office in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif., to oversee his family's foundation that runs Christian-based sports programs, and spent a few hours training for his next stop on the Champions Tour.\n\nTwenty years ago today, Michael Chang jolted the tennis world with a miracle French Open victory that sparked one of the most improbable Grand Slam title runs in history. The New Jersey-born Chang's stunning fourth-round, five-set win over top-ranked Ivan Lendl became his defining moment and helped changed the culture of American men's tennis.\n\n\"It's tough to explain,\" the now-37-year-old Chang said of the upset. \"I've gone back in the past to look at the videotape. I still can't tell you how I won that match.\"\n\nOn a spring afternoon in front of a late-arriving crowd, Chang's innovative and unorthodox tactics in the face of severe cramps stymied Lendl and became the stuff of legend. Whether it was serving underhand or moving up to the service line, the images from that 4-hour, 37-minute marathon resonated.\n\n\"There is no bitterness,\" Lendl said. \"And there never was.\"\n\nFor Chang -- fresh off his first (and not necessarily last) acting gig on the \"'Prince of Tennis,\" a prime-time TV drama series in China -- the memories from the moment that defined his toughness remain fresh.\n\nAt 17 years, 3 months old, Chang became the youngest male Grand Slam champion in history by outlasting Stefan Edberg in another five-set thriller a week later. He also snapped a 34-year-old drought by American men on the red clay of Roland Garros.\n\nAnd the improbable comeback by Chang, born in Hoboken before his family migrated to the West Coast, paved the way for a decade-long American resurgence on the red clay. The Americans won four French Open titles -- and had four runner-up finishes -- over the next 10 years.\n\n\"We recognized very quickly after Michael won that it was not an insurmountable task,\" said Jim Courier, who won the French in 1991 and '92. \"Something that seemed so far away was right in front of you at that point.\"\n\nChang never thought about making history on June 5, 1989. He was more worried about the pain he began to feel in his legs.\n\nTHE CRAMPS\n\nJoe Chang had seen enough.\n\nHis son had displayed speed and athleticism through the first three rounds at Roland Garros, ousting friend and fellow American teen Pete Sampras along the way. Lendl, the three-time French Open champion and undisputed No. 1 player in the world, awaited in the Round of 16.\n\nJoe Chang knew it was time to go home. So, the chemical engineer boarded a plane back to California.\n\n\"I get a chance to play the No. 1 player in the world and you're going to go home now?\" Michael asked.\n\n\"Well, I got to go back and make a living,\" his father said.\n\n\"His mentality was basically, 'I don't think you're going to win anyway so ... you know ... I got to go home,\" Chang remembered with a laugh.\n\nLendl won the first two sets, 6-4, 6-4. The 15th-seeded Chang, a year after turning pro, clawed back to win the third set, 6-3, and was rolling in the fourth set.\n\nThen, the cramps.\n\nSubtle pains became sharp. Chang felt it in his left calf, then his right. The cramps slowly spread through both legs. Soon, the pain was unbearable. Chang drank water and ate bananas as often as possible.\n\n\"Once you're dehydrated, it's hard to catch up,\" Chang said. \"You can drink, drink, drink, drink, drink. ... Your body can only absorb those fluids so quickly before the cramps dissipate.\"\n\nHe stood during changeovers, fearful he might suffer another cramp if he lowered himself on the chair. He grimaced and shouted in pain on nearly every swing. Reaching high for serves was excruciating.\n\nWhen Chang's sneakers slid across the soft clay, his calves cramped and stuck for minutes. He hobbled back for the next point, having been robbed of his greatest asset.\n\nHe somehow won the fourth set, 6-3, and took an early 2-1 lead in the fifth.\n\nThen, he nearly made the biggest mistake of his career.\n\nNEVER GIVE UP\n\nChang's mind wandered as he walked toward chair umpire Richard Ings.\n\nThe pain had beaten him. He could no longer track down shots. He was stuck in red quicksand. So the 5-9, 135-pound teenager was ready to default the rest of the match.\n\n\"I started thinking about how great it would be to have people pat me on the back in the locker room and say, 'Hey, great effort. Bad luck in the last set,'\" Chang said. \"I thought to myself, 'That's not so bad.'\"\n\nBut before he opened his mouth, he had an epiphany.\n\n\"It started to dawn on me that if I quit right then and there,\" Chang remembered, \"every other time that I have difficulties on or off the court, I'm going to quit again. If you quit the first time, the second, third and fourth times are that much easier to do the same thing.\"\n\nChang kept playing through the pain, bent on finishing. He resorted to unusual tactics. Unable to adequately cover the court, Chang hit \"moon balls,\" lob shots that frustrated Lendl. The pressure mounted for the man across the net.\n\n\"All the pressure was really on him in the fifth set,\" Chang said. \"It became a little bit of a mental battle for him that he was not familiar with. He probably should have tried to make me move a little bit more, hit a few drop shots rather than wait for me to keel over and just call it a day.\"\n\nUnable to generate any power on his serve, Chang stunned Lendl - and everyone else - with a quick underhand serve with a 4-3 lead. Moments after Chang won the point, the crowd exploded. Lendl tapped his left finger on his temple.\n\n\"You could really tell that he was starting to unravel mentally,\" Chang said.\n\nThe typically unflappable Lendl never figured it out. On match point, Chang tried one final wacky move by moving up to the service line to frustrate Lendl, who double-faulted to end the match.\n\nChang's comeback was complete -- 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3.\n\n\"Americans had been buried in the dirt in Paris for so many years,\" Chang said. \"The question was constantly, 'Where's the future for American tennis?' With (Jim) Courier, (Pete) Sampras, (Andre) Agassi and me, it was hard not to jump on the bandwagon and say we got some opportunities here. Maybe something special might happen in Paris.\"\n\nThanks to a performance for the ages, it did."
