        "text": "Bio Former American tennis player. As a member of the “Greatest Generation” of American players that included Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Jim Courier, Chang was the first of that illustrious group to record a victory at a Grand Slam event.\n\nHe became the youngest male player to win a Grand Slam singles title when he won the French Open in 1989 at the age of 17 years and 4 months.\n\nIndustrious, ambitious, unwavering and purposeful, Chang went on to reach the finals of the Australian Open and U.S. Open, as well as reaching the title round once more at Roland Garros. No one is his era had a larger heart.\n\nHe won the USTA Boys 18s Hardcourts and the Boys 18s Nationals in 1987. At age 12, won the USTA Junior Hard Court singles, and the Fiesta Bowl 16s at age 13. Named ATP Newcomer of the Year in 1988.\n\nKnown for his on-court speed and fighting spirit, Chang is considered by many observers to have been one of the best defensive baseliners of all time. He also introduced the jumping two-handed backhand. He remained in the top 10 of the ATP world rankings for several years in the 1990s, peaking at World No. 2 in September 1996.\n\nChang was born in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1972 to Joe and Betty (née Tung). Betty and Joe moved from Taiwan to the US in 1959 and 1966 respectively. The parents met in the United States after being introduced by a mutual friend.\n\nBetty was born in Delhi, India as the daughter of Michael Tung, then serving as diplomat of The Republic of China to India. Michael then served in the Legislative Yuan and was an Ambassador to Cambodia and Dominic Republic/Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, among other diplomatic posts in 1960s to 1980s.\n\nJoe was born in Chaozhou, China, and moved to Taiwan at age seven. Michael's Chinese name was chosen by Joe, and his English name by Betty (who named him after her father).\n\nAfter moving from Hoboken, New Jersey, to St. Paul, Minnesota, where Michael learned tennis, the Changs moved to first Placentia, California, and then Encinitas, California, to increase the tennis opportunities for Michael and his older brother, Carl. After rising to #163 in the world as a 15-year-old amateur, Chang dropped out of tenth grade at San Dieguito High School in Encinitas after passing his GED in February 1988 in order to pursue a professional tennis career.\n\nChang also attended the master's in ministry program at Biola University in La Mirada, California, for a year and half. He serves on Biola's Board of Trustees.\n\nA devout Christian, Chang first spotlit his faith upon winning the 1989 French Open, declaring \"I thank the Lord Jesus Christ, because without Him, I am nothing.\n\nIn 1999 Chang and his family established the Chang Family Foundation, dedicated to integrating tennis, family, and Christian faith. The Foundation is now based in Rancho Santa Margarita, California.\n\nChang lives in Orange County, California. He is an avid fisherman who often takes fishing trips while traveling. He also has a passion for breeding African cichlids in several large freshwater aquariums at his home.\n\nOn October 18, 2008, Chang married Amber Liu, also a professional tennis player, who is 12 years younger than him. They have one daughter, Lani (born December 9, 2010).\n\nOne of his passions is to breed African cichilds in several fresh-water aquariums he has set up in his home in Mercer Island, Wash. His largest aquarium is 240 gallons, eight-feet long by two-feet high.\n\nSupports grassroots tennis development in Asia through his Stars of the Future program in Hong Kong and the Reebok Challenge across all of Asia. Michael is a national spokesperson for the National Fish & Wildlife Federation. One of five athletes named in the second annual Most Caring Athlete by USA TODAY Weekend in 1995. Earned one of seven Asian American leadership awards in May 1997 by A. Magazine for status as a role model for Asian American youth.\n\nOn May 3, 2009, Chang was honored by the Los Angeles Chinese Historical Society of Southern California in \"Celebrating Taiwanese Americans in Sports\".\n\nReleased a book about his career in summer 2002, \"Holding Serve: Persevering On and Off the Court\";\n\nCoached by older brother, Carl (born Feb. 13, 1969), who began working with Michael in late July 1991 (the two have played doubles together in 17 ATP stops since 1990).\n\nChang was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nHe is currently coaching Kei Nishikori, the No.1 Japanese player."
