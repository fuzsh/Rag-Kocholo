He became the youngest male player to win a Grand Slam singles title when he won the French Open in 1989 at the age of 17 years and 4 months.Known for his on-court speed and fighting spirit, Chang is considered by many observers to have been one of the best defensive baseliners of all time. He also introduced the jumping two-handed backhand. He remained in the top 10 of the ATP world rankings for several years in the 1990s, peaking at World No. 2 in September 1996.Chang was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2008.As of January 2014, Chang is coaching Kei Nishikori."
