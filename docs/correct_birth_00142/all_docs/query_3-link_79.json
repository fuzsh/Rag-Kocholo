        "text": "As Michael Chang neared the end of his professional tennis career, his older brother Carl introduced him to golf. The idea was to soften the landing onto the runway of retirement, to fill the hours and days now that he wouldn’t be jetting across the globe in pursuit of a fuzzy yellow tennis ball.\n\nAnd Chang genuinely took to golf.\n\n“That lasted all of two or three weeks,” Carl says, “before he got bored and said, ‘I’ve got to find something more to do.’ ”\n\nMichael doesn’t think it took that long.\n\n“About five days,” he says. “I felt bored and unproductive.”\n\nThis is a guy who won the San Diego Section singles title as an eighth-grader at Oak Crest Middle School in Encinitas, who turned pro a year later and at 17 was the youngest man to win a Grand Slam title. Who won 662 pro matches, won 34 ATP tournaments, a Davis Cup and $19,145,632 in prize money. Who squeezed 16 years on tour out of a 5-foot-9, 160-pound frame.\n\nYou do your time. You retire. You count your money and your blessings . . . from the deck of your yacht bobbing in a harbor on the French Riviera.\n\nNot Chang.\n\nNot the kid who beat No. 1-ranked Ivan Lendl on the red clay of Roland Garros 20 years ago this week despite dropping the first two sets and then having debilitating leg cramps set in. The lessons, the morals, the parables were the same then as they are now. The epic fourth-round match at the 1989 French Open and the subsequent title, would define his tennis career. Two decades later, it still defines his life.\n\n“I started to walk up to the chair (umpire),” says Chang, 37, who was weaned on the hard courts of Carlsbad and had little experience on clay. “I was going to quit. I wasn’t expected to win. If I call it a day, I’ll get people to pat me on the back and say, ‘Job well done even though you lost.’ You start to think that’s not a bad way to go out.\n\n“I got to the service line and I had this incredible conviction of heart, that it would be a cop-out.”\n\nAnd then he adds this: “If I had gone and quit in that fifth set, I think my career, my life, would have taken a different turn.”\n\nA 300-gallon aquarium is nearly 10 feet long and weighs about 2,500 pounds filled. Chang estimates that he has 12, maybe 15 of them.\n\nHe breeds African cichlids from Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi in southern Africa. They are colorful, delicate, majestic fish, but what intrigues Chang is how the mothers incubate the eggs in their mouths – ovophile mouthbrooding, it’s called. They often keep fry inside for several weeks after hatching, allowing them to swim freely in their new world and then returning to the mouth’s safety at any sign of danger.\n\nChang considers it a hobby. But it also, in a sense, fits a mission.\n\n“I want to touch lives,” he says.\n\nHis parents grew up in Taiwan and he wanted to improve his Mandarin, so after retiring from the pro tour in 2003 he moved to Beijing for five weeks and attended an intensive language program. There were four hours of classroom work each day, and four or five more hours of homework.\n\nHe wanted to deepen his understanding of the Christian faith, so he enrolled in theology courses at BIOLA (the Bible Institute of Los Angeles) for several semesters and had the unusual distinction of being a student while also serving on the board of trustees.\n\nHe threw himself and his dollars – federal tax returns show he contributed $249,039 in 2007 – into the Chang Family Foundation, which promotes Christian values and runs youth sports leagues in Seattle and Orange County.\n\nHe coached Chinese player Peng Shuai on the women’s pro tour. He was a goodwill ambassador for the 2008 Olympics. He plays in charity exhibitions and conducts youth clinics here and abroad. He is scheduled to play in the World TeamTennis league this summer and make appearances on tennis’ senior tour.\n\nHe has become more and more active in the real estate company he owns with his brother.\n\nHe recently married Amber Liu, a Francis Parker High alum who won two NCAA singles titles at Stanford.\n\n“He enjoys his quiet moments, mostly in the mornings,” says Caroline Wong Nakata, the executive director of the Chang Family Foundation. “That’s when he reflects and prays and reads the Bible. After that, he’s either training or he’s coaching or he’s giving tips to people running clinics or he’s in meetings or he’s got a speaking engagement or he’s doing stuff with his brother Carl on the real estate side.\n\n“He keeps busy.”\n\nThe money? It’s invested, or donated to the foundation or other charities, or quietly collecting interest in a bank.\n\n“Michael lives a relatively modest life from an expenditure standpoint,” says Carl, who lives a few miles from his brother in Orange County. “I mean, he does enjoy some of the finer things in life sometimes. But he doesn’t drive the nicest car. He drives an Acura. He doesn’t have the largest home on the block. He lives in my condo.”\n\nHe still finds time to fish, or tend to his tropical fish, and he makes his way out to the golf course, where he reputedly carries a 2 handicap despite playing only occasionally.\n\n“You have what everybody else wants, what people define as success,” Chang says. “You’ve made a lot of money, you have fame, you’ve done all these different things that we define as success. But to me, I don’t define success that way. I don’t define a meaningful life as, ‘I put in my work and now I can enjoy the rest of my life doing the things only I want to do.’\n\n“For me, to some degree that’s an easy way out. I feel like I’m wasting this platform I’ve been given through tennis if I play golf every day or go fishing every day. I don’t think that’s a productive life and I don’t want to be remembered that way. If I’m not going out there and making my life count, so to speak, then I don’t think you’re living life the way it should be lived.”\n\nIt makes perfect sense now, 20 years later, watching the footage of that day on the red clay of Roland Garros. Walking toward the chair umpire to forfeit. Stopping at the service line.\n\nChang began lobbing moon balls to Lendl, a desperate act to buy time while the pain from the cramps coursed through his legs and to frustrate the indomitable Czech. He hit an underhanded serve, and Lendl’s expletives echoed across the fabled center court.\n\nAt match point, as Lendl prepared to deliver a second serve, Chang audaciously took several steps inside the baseline, practically to the service line. Lendl double faulted, giving Chang a 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 victory in the 4-hour, 39-minute match that ranks among the most memorable in history.\n\nA week later, Chang beat Sweden’s Stefan Edberg to become the youngest male champion in a Grand Slam at 17 years, 3 months, a record that still stands. He also became the first American man to win the French Open in 34 years.\n\nChang would reach the finals of three more Grand Slam tournaments, but he would never win another. The way he sees it, he didn’t need to.\n\n“I definitely learned a lot about myself that day, about faith and God,” he says two decades later, “and a lot about life.”"
