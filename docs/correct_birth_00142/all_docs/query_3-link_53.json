        "text": "While oral steroids have been shown to be effective in the management of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps, its role in treating chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps (CRSsNP) is ambiguous. Despite a lack of strong clinical evidence to suggest a benefit in this disease state, steroids are often prescribed as a component of post-operative care after sinus surgery for patients without polyps. Oral steroids carry with them significant adverse effects, and should be prescribed thoughtfully. The aims of this study are to determine if oral steroids in the peri-operative period improves patient outcomes in CRS without polyps.\n\nStanford is currently not accepting patients for this trial. For more information, please contact Peter H Hwang, M.D., 650-725-6500.\n\nView full details\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough oral corticosteroids are commonly prescribed following endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyposis, there are little data to suggest that this is a beneficial practice.To assess the efficacy of oral corticosteroids following ESS in CRS without polyps.This prospective double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized noninferiority clinical trial conducted in a single academic tertiary rhinology practice included adults with CRS without polyps undergoing ESS. Of 81 patients recruited, 72 completed the study.Patients were randomized into 2 treatment groups: a 12-day postoperative taper of oral prednisone vs matched placebo tablets. All study patients also received a uniform 2-week postoperative regimen of oral antibiotics, fluticasone nasal spray, and saline rinses.The primary outcome measures were Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) scores and Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scores, collected preoperatively and postoperatively at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Scores were compared between treatment groups at each time point using longitudinal difference between treatment groups and analyzed using 2-way, repeated measures analysis of variance. Secondary outcome measures included treatment-related adverse effects.Overall, 72 patients (mean [SD] age, 49.4 [14.9] years; 36 men, 36 women) completed the study, with 33 in the prednisone arm and 39 in the placebo arm. When comparing longitudinal differences between treatment groups, there was no clinically meaningful difference observed in SNOT-22 total (F[4254] = 1.71, η2 = 0.01 [95% CI, 0.00-0.05]) or Lund-Kennedy scores (F[4247] = 1.23, η2 = 0.02 [95% CI, 0.00-0.50]). In SNOT-22 subdomain analyses, there was no clinically meaningful difference between treatment groups for rhinologic, extranasal rhinologic, ear/facial, or sleep subdomains. However, the prednisone group had worse longitudinal scores for psychological dysfunction compared with the placebo group (F[4254] = 3.18, η2 = 0.05 [95% CI, 0.02-0.09]). Reported adverse effects were similar between the 2 treatment groups.In this randomized clinical trial of patients with CRS without polyps, oral prednisone following ESS conferred no additional benefit over placebo in terms of SNOT-22 total scores, SNOT-22 rhinologic subscores, or Lund-Kennedy endoscopy scores up to 6 months after surgery. Patients receiving prednisone, however, did demonstrate worse SNOT-22 psychologic subdomain scores. These results suggest that the risks of oral corticosteroids may outweigh the benefits; thus use of oral corticosteroids after ESS for CRS without polyps should be carefully considered.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02748070.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamaoto.2021.0011\n\nView details for PubMedID 33662124\n\nAbstract\n\nThe objective of this study is to characterize changes in hemodynamics, pain, and anxiety during office-based endoscopic sinus procedures performed under local anesthesia.We conducted a prospective study of adults undergoing in-office endoscopic sinus procedures under local anesthesia. Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification System class 1 or 2 were included. Anesthesia was administered by topical 4% lidocaine/oxymetazoline and submucosal injection of 1% lidocaine/1:200,000 epinephrine. Vital signs and pain were measured at baseline, postinjection, and 5-minute intervals throughout the procedure. Anxiety levels were scored using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify factors significantly associated with changes in each hemodynamic metric.Twenty-five patients were studied. This cohort was 52% male, mean age of 57.8 ± 14.4 years, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) median of 2. Mean procedure duration was 25.0 ± 10.3 minutes. Mean maximal increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 24.6 ± 17.8 mmHg from baseline. Mean maximal heart rate increase was 22.8 ± 10.8 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline. In multivariate regression analysis, when accounting for patient age, cardiac comorbidity, CCI, and ASA, older age was significantly associated with an increase of >20 mmHg in SBP (p = 0.043). Mean pain score during procedures was 1.5 ± 1.3 with a mean maximum of 4.0 ± 2.6. STAI anxiety scores did not change significantly from preprocedure to postprocedure (32.8 ± 11.6 to 31.0 ± 12.6, p = 0.46). No medical complications occurred.Although patients appear to tolerate office procedures well, providers should recognize the potential for significant fluctuations in blood pressure during the procedure, especially in older patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/alr.22460\n\nView details for PubMedID 31899857\n\nAbstract\n\nWe assessed how eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) changed with endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and identified factors associated with improvement.Retrospective chart review.Academic center.Patients undergoing ESS for chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyposis (CRSwNP, CRSsNP) or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) completed the Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire 7 (ETDQ-7) preoperatively and postoperatively at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Included in analyses were demographics, comorbidities, Sinonasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22), radiographic score, endoscopy score, procedure, and medication use. Regression analysis identified factors associated with improvement, defined as ΔETDQ-7 >3.5.In total, 302 patients were studied. ETD prevalence was 68% in CRSsNP, 48% in CRSwNP, and 88% in RARS. Patients with ETD had a mean baseline ETDQ-7 of 25.8 ± 8.0 and improved postoperatively at 2 weeks (19.9 ± 8.1, P < .001), 6 weeks (17.8 ± 9.3, P < .001), 3 months (16.8 ± 8.5, P < .001), and 6 months (16.4 ± 7.9, P < .001). At 6 months, ETD improved in 89% of patients with CRSsNP, 68% with CRSwNP, and 78% with RARS. On multivariate analysis, ETD improvement was associated with higher preoperative ETDQ-7 score (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.22; P = .030), higher preoperative SNOT-22 score (aOR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08; P = .001), higher preoperative SNOT-22 ear subscore (aOR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02-1.65; P = .034), posterior ethmoidectomy (aOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.22-4.92; P = .025), and postoperative corticosteroid spray use (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.17-1.66; P = .008).ETD symptoms often improve following ESS. Factors associated with improvement include higher preoperative disease burden, posterior ethmoidectomy, and postoperative corticosteroid spray.4.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/0194599820917396\n\nView details for PubMedID 32343633\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the existing body of literature regarding long-term outcomes of various treatments for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in the cystic fibrosis population.RECENT FINDINGS: The management of CRS in cystic fibrosis involves a multitude of medical and surgical therapies. Despite their high usage amongst clinicians, corticosteroids and antibiotics currently have little outcome data supporting their use. There is emerging evidence demonstrating beneficial outcomes for DNAse mucolytics and molecular modulators of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor regulator (CFTR). Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) improves sinonasal outcomes in cystic fibrosis CRS; however, the benefit on pulmonary outcomes remains unclear.SUMMARY: Successful management of CRS in cystic fibrosis requires multimodal and multidisciplinary care. The long-term outcome data is variable for different treatment modalities. There is recent evidence supporting the role of DNAse mucolytics, CFTR-targeting therapies, and ESS in management of cystic fibrosis CRS.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/MOO.0000000000000596\n\nView details for PubMedID 31815863\n\nAbstract\n\nTo assess the efficacy and safety of cryoablation of the posterior nasal nerve (PNN) for treatment of chronic rhinitis.This was a prospective single-arm trial of 98 adult patients at six U.S. centers with chronic allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. PNN cryoablation was performed in-office under local anesthesia using a handheld device. Patients discontinued use of intranasal ipratropium 3 days prior to treatment and throughout the study period. Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) was measured at pretreatment baseline and posttreatment at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. The Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) was completed at pretreatment and 3 months posttreatment. Adverse effects and postprocedure medication usage were recorded.Ninety-eight procedures (100%) were successfully completed. rTNSS significantly improved over pretreatment baseline (6.1 ± 1.9) at 1 month (2.9 ± 1.9, P < 0.001), 3 months (3.0 ± 2.3, P < 0.001), 6 months (3.0 ± 2.1, P < 0.001), and 9 months (3.0 ± 2.4, P < 0.001) postprocedure. Nasal congestion and rhinorrhea subscores improved significantly at all time points (P < 0.001). Both allergic and nonallergic rhinitis subcohorts showed improvement (P < 0.001), with a comparable degree of improvement between groups. RQLQ significantly improved over pretreatment baseline (3.0 ± 1.0) at 3 months (1.5 ± 1.0, P < 0.001), and all RQLQ subdomains demonstrated improvement. Of 54 patients using intranasal medication at baseline, 19 (35.2%) were able to discontinue use. Twenty-nine adverse effects were reported, including headache, epistaxis, and sinusitis.Cryoablation of the PNN for chronic rhinitis is safe and can result in relief of nasal symptoms and improvements in quality of life.4 Laryngoscope, 2019.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/lary.28301\n\nView details for PubMedID 31566744\n\nAbstract\n\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea (leakage of brain fluid from the nose) can be difficult to identify and currently requires invasive procedures, such as intrathecal fluorescein, which requires a lumbar drain placement. Fluorescein is also known to have rare but significant side effects including seizures and death. As the number of endonasal skull base cases increases, the number of CSF leaks has also increased for which an alternative diagnostic method would be highly advantageous to patients.We aim to develop an instrument to identify CSF leaks based on water absorption in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) without the need of intrathecal contrast agents. This device needed to be adapted to the anatomy of the human nasal cavity while maintaining low weight and ergonomic characteristics of current surgical instruments.Absorption spectra of CSF and artificial CSF were obtained to characterize the absorption peaks that could be targeted with SWIR light. Different illumination systems were tested and refined prior to adapting them into a portable endoscope for testing in 3D-printed models and cadavers for feasibility.We identified CSF to have an identical absorption profile as water. In our testing, a narrowband laser source at 1480 nm proved superior to using a broad 1450 nm LED. Using a SWIR enabling endoscope set up, we tested the ability to detect artificial CSF in a cadaver model.An endoscopic system based on SWIR narrowband imaging can provide an alternative in the future to invasive methods of CSF leak detection.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1117/1.JBO.28.9.094803\n\nView details for PubMedID 37188003\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC10181794\n\nAbstract\n\nPrior studies have provided variable results regarding environmental risk factors for epistaxis. These studies were conducted in varying climate zones, which may explain discrepancies in results. The objective of this study is to investigate correlations between season, temperature, and humidity on frequency of pediatric epistaxis across climate zones.Children seen in the outpatient setting for epistaxis were identified from the 2007-2010 IBM MarketScan database. Climate zones were assigned according to International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) classification, where temperature zones in the United States and territories were assigned on an ordinal scale from 1 (tropical) to 8 (subarctic), and humidity zones were categorized as moist, dry, or marine. The control population was a sample of all well-child visits matched by age and county.We identified 184,846 unique children seen for epistaxis and 1,897,012 matched controls. Moderate temperature zones were associated with lower odds of epistaxis compared with the hottest and coldest zones. Humidity was associated inversely with epistaxis rates in moderate temperature zones but was not a significant predictor of epistaxis in climates with extreme heat. Additionally, summer was associated with lower odds of epistaxis compared to winter. Interestingly, however, there were significantly higher rates of cautery procedures during summer months, driven largely by increased procedures performed in clinic, as opposed to the operating room or emergency room.Environmental risk factors for epistaxis vary by climate zone. The model presented reconciles prior reports and may allow for more personalized clinical management based on regional climate.Level 3 Laryngoscope, 2023.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/lary.30961\n\nView details for PubMedID 37589269\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Social media (SM) is an increasingly popular medium for the medical community to engage with patients, trainees, and colleagues. This review aimed to identify reported uses of SM in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS), assess the quality of evidence supporting these uses, and identify gaps in the literature. With the relative lack of regulatory guidelines for the development of SM content, we hypothesized that the quality of content available on SM would be highly variable.DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: A scoping review was performed of English-language peer-reviewed studies published to date discussing SM use in any form within OHNS. Three reviewers independently screened all abstracts. Two reviewers independently extracted data of interest from the full text of articles identified from the preliminary abstract screen.RESULTS: 171 studies were included, with 94 (54.9%) studies published between 2020 and 2022. 104 (60.8%) studies were conducted in the US. 135 (78.9%) used cross-sectional or survey-based methodology; only 7 (4.1%) were controlled studies. SM was most commonly employed for professional networking (n=37 [21%]), and within subspecialties of otology (n=38 [22%]) and rhinology/allergy (n=25 [15%]). Facebook was most frequently used for study recruitment (n=23 [13.5%]), YouTube for patient education (n=15 [14.6%]), and Twitter for professional networking (n=16 [9.4%]).CONCLUSION: SM use within OHNS is increasing rapidly, with applications including patient education, professional networking, and study recruitment. Despite myriad articles, there remains a paucity of well-controlled studies. As SM becomes integrated into healthcare, particularly for applications directly impacting patient care, higher levels of evidence are needed to understand its true impact.

There is also an active investigation into treatments that harness the neuroregenerative properties of the olfactory epithelium, such as platelet-rich plasma and stem cell transplantation.Successful management of OD is multimodal and tailored to the underlying etiology. As the findings of further investigations accrue, the management of OD will undoubtedly continue to be advanced and refined, and likely harness the intrinsic neuroregenerative properties of the olfactory system.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s40136-022-00436-z\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000870932400001\n\nView details for PubMedID 36312744\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC9589531\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of implementing a standardized multimodal perioperative pain management protocol in reducing opioid prescriptions following otolaryngologic surgery.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.SETTING: County hospital otolaryngology practice.METHODS: A perioperative pain management protocol was implemented in adults undergoing otolaryngologic surgery. This protocol included preoperative patient education and a postoperative multimodal pain regimen stratified by pain level: mild, intermediate, and high. Opioid prescriptions were compared between patient cohorts before and after protocol implementation. Patients in the pain protocol were surveyed regarding pain levels and opioid use.RESULTS: We analyzed 210 patients (105 preprotocol and 105 postprotocol). Mean ± SD morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) prescribed decreased from 132.5 ± 117.8 to 53.6 ± 63.9 (P < .05) following protocol implementation. Mean MMEs prescribed significantly decreased (P < .05) for each procedure pain tier: mild (107.4 to 40.5), intermediate (112.8 to 48.1), and high (240.4 to 105.0). Mean MMEs prescribed significantly decreased (P < .05) for each procedure type: endocrine (105.6 to 44.4), facial plastics (225.0 to 50.0), general (160.9 to 105.7), head and neck oncology (138.6 to 77.1), laryngology (53.8 to 12.5), otology (77.5 to 42.9), rhinology (142.2 to 44.4), and trauma (288.0 to 24.5). Protocol patients reported a mean 1-week postoperative pain score of 3.4, used opioids for a mean 3.1 days, and used only 39% of their prescribed opioids.CONCLUSION: Preoperative counseling and standardization of a multimodal perioperative pain regimen for otolaryngology procedures can effectively lower amount of opioid prescriptions while maintaining low levels of postoperative pain.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/01945998211071116\n\nView details for PubMedID 35015583\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a potentially fatal perioperative complication. The objective of this study was to assess the rate and risk factors for VTE in endoscopic skull base surgery (ESBS).METHODS: This was a retrospective review of adults undergoing ESBS at a tertiary academic center. Incidence of VTE in the 30-day postoperative period was recorded. Logistic regression analyses identified factors associated with VTE.RESULTS: 1122 ESBS cases between 2009 and 2019 were studied. Almost no cases (96.1%) employed perioperative VTE chemoprophylaxis. The overall incidence of VTE was 2.3% (26/1122). Malignant pathologies had a higher rate of VTE compared to nonmalignant pathologies (4.5% vs 2.0%, OR 2.85, 95%CI 1.22-6.66). Factors associated with an increased risk of VTE included a Caprini score greater than 5 (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.28-1.83); multiple preoperative endocrinopathies such as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) (OR 22.48, 95% CI 3.93-128.70), adrenal insufficiency (OR 5.24, 95% CI 1.82-15.03), hypercortisolism (OR 4.46, 95% CI 1.47-13.56), and hypothyroidism (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.66-8.20), each 10-hour increment of lumbar drain duration (OR 1.16, 95%CI 1.08-1.25), and each 10-hour increment for duration of hospitalization (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.06).CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VTE following ESBS is relatively low. Factors with a higher association with VTE include malignancy, preoperative endocrinopathies, higher Caprini score, prolonged lumbar drain duration, and prolonged hospitalization. Further study is needed to validate these findings and to refine clinical decision making around perioperative VTE prophylaxis. This article is protected by copyright.

Diagnosis of ENS was based on the following criteria: 1) reported discomfort with nasal breathing and/or paradoxical nasal obstruction after inferior turbinate reduction, 2) a positive ENS6Q score of at least 11, and 3) a positive cotton test. Questionnaire responses were recorded prior to surgery as well as 1, 3, 6, and 12months postoperatively.RESULTS: Seventeen eligible patients were included. Mean ENS6Q scores were significantly reduced at all postoperative time points (p<.0001, p<.0001, p<.0001, p=.0003). Of the six ENS6Q subdomains, five (suffocation, dryness, sense of diminished airflow, nasal crusting, and nasal burning) were significantly reduced 1-year postoperatively (p<.0001, p=.0004, p=.0136, p=.0114, p=.0080, respectively). SNOT-22 scores were significantly reduced at all time points (p=.0021, p=.0227, p=.0004, and p=.0025). Of the SNOT-22 subdomains, the sleep subdomain was significantly reduced 1-year postoperatively (p=.0432). Low baseline GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores were recorded at 7 and 9.4, respectively, and although scores at all postoperative time points were reduced, there was no statistical significance.CONCLUSION: IMAP via implant of cadaveric rib cartilage provides significant, long-term improvements in ENS-specific and general sinonasal symptoms.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV Laryngoscope, 2021.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/lary.29593\n\nView details for PubMedID 33991117\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: The 5 years since the publication of the first International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Rhinosinusitis (ICAR-RS) has witnessed foundational progress in our understanding and treatment of rhinologic disease.

Parotidectomy was performed for several indications, including benign tumors, malignant tumors, and chronic sialadenitis. Mean age of patients was 78.0 ± 7.9 years, and all had an American Society of Anesthesia score ≥ 2 and Charlson comorbidity index ≥4. Mean operative time was 102.8 ± 38.3 min, comparable to that of parotidectomy under general anesthesia. No major complications occurred. Minor complications included three cases of temporary postoperative facial nerve weakness limited to 1-2 lower division branches. At most recent follow up (10 to 48 months), all patients were medically stable and disease free.CONCLUSION: In carefully selected patients, parotidectomy under local anesthesia is a viable treatment alternative that can be offered to patients. Successful outcomes require preoperative counseling, meticulous technique, and close collaboration with anesthesia colleagues.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30691973\n\nAbstract\n\nBibliometric analysis is a common method to determine the most influential articles in medical specialties, as it is an objective measure of peer recognition of scientific work. This study is the first bibliometric analysis of the literature in facial plastic surgery, to determine the most cited papers in the field. Bibliometric analysis was performed using the Science Citation Index from the Institute for Scientific Information, accessed through the Web of Science™. Filter terms relevant to the field of facial plastic surgery were used to identify the 50 most cited journal articles between 1900 and 2016. The median number of citations was 150 (range 116-1091). The articles spanned a wide range of topics in the field, with the most common topics being free flap reconstruction (n = 10), nasal surgery (n = 9), and rhytidectomy (n = 6). The majority of these articles (n = 29) presented findings supported by level IV or V evidence. This analysis provides an overview of the most cited articles in facial plastic surgery, many of which introduced some of the most fundamental principles and techniques in the field. These landmark articles represent important educational points that should be reviewed by all clinicians and trainees in this field.

A lack of understanding of molecular etiology and absence of targetable drivers has limited therapy for patients with ACC to surgery and radiation. Currently, no curative treatments are available for patients with metastatic disease, which highlights the need for effective new therapies. Research in this area has been inhibited by the lack of validated cell lines and a paucity of clinically useful markers. The ACC research environment has recently improved, thanks to the introduction of novel tools, technologies, approaches, and models. Improved understanding of ACC suggests that neural crest-like stemness is a major target in this rare tumor. New cell culture techniques and patient-derived xenografts provide tools for preclinical testing.Preclinical research has not identified effective targets in ACC, as confirmed by the large number of failed clinical trials. New molecular data suggest that drivers of neural crest-like stemness may be required for maintenance of ACC; as such, CSCs are a target for therapy of ACC.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/lio2.22\n\nView details for PubMedID 28894804\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5510248\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough the existence of cancer stem cells (CSC) in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) has been proposed, lack of assays for their propagation and uncertainty about molecular markers prevented their characterization. Our objective was to isolate CSC from ACC and provide insight into signaling pathways that support their propagation.To isolate CSC from ACC and characterize them, we used ROCK inhibitor-supplemented cell culture, immunomagnetic cell sorting, andin vitro/in vivoassays for CSC viability and tumorigenicity.We identified in ACC CD133-positive CSC that expressed NOTCH1 and SOX10, formed spheroids, and initiated tumors in nude mice. CD133(+)ACC cells produced activated NOTCH1 (N1ICD) and generated CD133(-)cells that expressed JAG1 as well as neural differentiation factors NR2F1, NR2F2, and p27Kip1. Knockdowns ofNOTCH1, SOX10, and their common effectorFABP7had negative effects on each other, inhibited spheroidogenesis, and induced cell death pointing at their essential roles in CSC maintenance. Downstream effects ofFABP7knockdown included suppression of a broad spectrum of genes involved in proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, and metabolism. Among proliferation-linked NOTCH1/FABP7 targets, we identified SKP2 and its substrate p27Kip1. A γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, selectively depleted CD133(+)cells, suppressed N1ICD and SKP2, induced p27Kip1, inhibited ACC growthin vivo, and sensitized CD133(+)cells to radiation.These results establish in the majority of ACC the presence of a previously uncharacterized population of CD133(+)cells with neural stem properties, which are driven by SOX10, NOTCH1, and FABP7. Sensitivity of these cells to Notch inhibition and their dependence on SKP2 offer new opportunities for targeted ACC therapies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-15-2208\n\nView details for PubMedID 27084744\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4834904\n\nAbstract\n\nSignal transducer and activator 1 (STAT-1) mutations are rare and have been implicated in combined immunodeficiency, enhanced tumorigenesis, and vascular defects.A 60-year-old woman with a novel STAT-1 mutation and resulting immunodeficiency, squamous cell carcinoma, and vascular disease presented with profuse epistaxis secondary to rupture of an aberrant artery that she developed in part because of this mutation. After unsuccessful posterior packing, embolization was initiated but subsequently aborted because of a bovine origin carotid artery and a history of multiple carotid dissections.After repeat posterior packing, hemostasis was achieved. No additional episodes of epistaxis occurred in the subsequent 13 months.Vascular anomalies can present challenges in epistaxis management. In patients with conditions known to cause vascular anomalies, it is critical to obtain vascular imaging before intervention.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/hed.24165\n\nView details for PubMedID 26445901\n\nAbstract\n\nPresentation of three cases of metastatic carcinoma to the internal auditory canal bilaterally, as well as a systematic review of the literature regarding the characteristics of these lesions.Using a MEDLINE Ovid search (1946-2015), we identified and reviewed 102 cases of metastatic carcinoma to the internal auditory canal. Metrics recorded include: patient age, sex, tumor type, laterality, past oncologic history, co-occurring metastatic sites, clinical findings, radiographic findings, therapy received, and outcome. Cases of unilateral versus bilateral IAC were compared.Remarkably, 52.9% reported cases of internal auditory canal metastases have bilateral occurrence. The most common primary tumor sites for internal auditory canal metastases were lung (21.2%), skin (18.6%), and breast (16.7%), with lung and skin cancers having the highest rates of bilateral metastasis. Meningeal metastasis occurred at a much higher rate in bilateral cases (47.2%) versus unilateral cases (8.5%). Brain parenchymal metastasis also occurred at a higher rate in bilateral cases (38.2%) versus unilateral cases (19.2%). Outcomes for cases of internal auditory canal metastases are generally poor, with 56.3% of unilateral cases and 86.1% of bilateral cases reporting patient death within 5 years from diagnosis.In cases of internal auditory canal metastasis, clinicians should carefully assess for not only contralateral disease but also additional metastatic disease of the central nervous system. Rapid-onset hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, or facial palsy should raise suspicion for internal auditory canal metastasis, particularly in patients with a known oncologic history.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.amjoto.2015.06.002\n\nView details for PubMedID 26545474\n\nAbstract\n\nAssessments of infectious disease spread in hospitals seldom account for interfacility patient sharing. This is particularly important for pathogens with prolonged incubation periods or carrier states.We quantified patient sharing among all 32 hospitals in Orange County (OC), California, using hospital discharge data. Same-day transfers between hospitals were considered \"direct\" transfers, and events in which patients were shared between hospitals after an intervening stay at home or elsewhere were considered \"indirect\" patient-sharing events. We assessed the frequency of readmissions to another OC hospital within various time points from discharge and examined interhospital sharing of patients with Clostridium difficile infection.In 2005, OC hospitals had 319,918 admissions. Twenty-nine percent of patients were admitted at least twice, with a median interval between discharge and readmission of 53 days. Of the patients with 2 or more admissions, 75% were admitted to more than 1 hospital. Ninety-four percent of interhospital patient sharing occurred indirectly. When we used 10 shared patients as a measure of potential interhospital exposure, 6 (19%) of 32 hospitals \"exposed\" more than 50% of all OC hospitals within 6 months, and 17 (53%) exposed more than 50% within 12 months. Hospitals shared 1 or more patient with a median of 28 other hospitals. When we evaluated patients with C. difficile infection, 25% were readmitted within 12 weeks; 41% were readmitted to different hospitals, and less than 30% of these readmissions were direct transfers.In a large metropolitan county, interhospital patient sharing was a potential avenue for transmission of infectious agents. Indirect sharing with an intervening stay at home or elsewhere composed the bulk of potential exposures and occurred unbeknownst to hospitals.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1086/656747\n\nView details for PubMedID 20874503\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC3064463"
