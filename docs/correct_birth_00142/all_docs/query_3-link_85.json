        "text": "The mind of a poet is usually a secret place. How a writer receives stimuli and turns it into art is typically a meticulous and personal process, informed by one’s own identity, experiences, and environment. In Michael Chang’s chapbook Drakkar Noir, Chang lets us into their interior world. The reader is brought into a collection where Zayn and Alice Notley are in dialogue, sex and art history are explored from one line to the next, and a sincere heart speaks in punchlines and fierce, albeit brilliant, shade.\n\nFrom the very first page, Chang’s words present a challenge to the reader. Essentially, how can the language of our cultures, whether learned or inherited, become tools to better understand our purpose in this life? What language do we use to make sense of our relationship to others? How useful is language as a tool in a country whose values undermine our existence? Through formal experimentation, balancing a sense of order and play, these poems don’t settle for easy answers, will not end unsatisfied, until they “uncover some grand truth.” In this way, Chang is defiant, “picking things apart, searching for a solution”. Language is revered and scrutinized at the same time, both sacred and plaything.\n\nIn Drakkar Noir, words moves like the mind moves, fast and fluid. The poems have personality. The language is spontaneous, effortlessly switching codes and vernacular from one instance to the next. Several poems incorporate Chinese in either the title or body of the text. Thoughts flip on a dime, the tone shifts according to circumstance. The mind behind these poems are thirsty, in search of something without a name. Desire is seen from the inside out, brimming with color, from a clever and sharp tongue.\n\nThis mind processes anger and sadness with style, snaps back, is witty as hell in its delivery. These poems don’t hold their tongue, rather, everything is worth trying to express. Chang’s use of pop culture in their poems turns specific references and figures into effective loaded symbols able to withstand the depth of the collection. A kind of cultural equity happens when everything is weighed and considered equally. A poem leads with an epigraph from Cornel West, another poem starts with Drake. Everything is capable of holding space, has value, and is accounted for.\n\nWhile the material of the poems are dense with meaning, Chang’s voice is cool, the poems thoughtfully crafted. Chang’s great sensitivity and empathy toward their subjects is evident, allowing them to be both biting and loving. Here is where Drakkar Noir shows the great versatility of language, how much fun it can be, its inherently flawed nature, and ultimately, its value as we make efforts to define ourselves and our story in this world.\n\nMOOSE KNUCKLES\n\nYou have your speed-dial pussies, pregnant as possum\n\nSplit second, black palms, an instant\n\nAren’t you trying to support me, husband me up\n\nSo I can be a trophy\n\nI am my own trophy\n\n& didn’t yo mama say that need & want are different things?\n\nNikki says most rabbis Jewish\n\nYou claim to hate it here but I don’t like it anywhere\n\nI call you Adam, take your light-skinned\n\nwhite-passing bush leagues\n\nyour gratuitous apple-bobbing\n\ninsane clown posse\n\nyour pale here’s-a-suggestion narcissism\n\nsweet meaning screwed up\n\nbreath spooky on my earlobes\n\ntongue swimming between my cheeks\n\nyour howling cosmology\n\npug nose closer than it appears\n\nYour second & third waves\n\nMy.
