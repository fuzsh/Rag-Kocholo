        "text": "Thirty years after his major title in Paris, Michael Chang's French Open title has received a new recognition.\n\nVisual artist Ricardo Roig created a mural on a shabby-chic facade in Hoboken, New Jersey commemorating the local's historic victory. The piece, titledÂ Michael Chang: Hoboken Hero, blessed by the City of Hoboken, is situated in Hoboken's Columbus Park area. Get aÂ glance at the piece's day two of three in the making, with the full piece viewable hereÂ and below.\n\n\"The reason to me why murals are so BIG is not their size, its in their spirit,\" the artist said in a statement accompanying the Roig Collection's Facebook post. \"Murals are larger than us- larger than life. They transcend time and help to tell the stories of those passing through and those in our communities. They inspire our daily life, and grow with time in these lives. As a solo artist who is normally working alone in a studio, murals help me to stretch out and work with others- wonderful individuals like yourself who offer their time and talent to the greater good energy and nourishment we need as humans from the power of Art! This mural is BIG- not because of its 4 story size, but because WE DID IT TOGETHER with TEAMWORK and a common goal of sharing COLOR, wonder & Hoboken's History : )\"\n\nSomewhere, Michael Chang is beaming."
