        "text": "Michael Chang, CFPÂ®\n\nSenior Analyst\n\nMy Professional Background\n\nI have been in the financial planning industry since 2016. Most recently I spent four years at a smaller RIA firm where I was able to build up a strong client service team and an efficient operations/technology network. My work helped create a thriving environment for advisors to focus on business development and servicing their clients. In 2021 I joined Highland to focus in on financial planning and client service.\n\nMy Wealth Management âWhyâ\n\nI want clients to feel successful in their financial lives. Many people work hard and make a lot of personal sacrifices in building their wealth and I want to make sure clients can get the most out of what theyâve worked so hard to accumulate. This often means simplifying complex financial concepts to provide greater clarity, which I am passionate about.\n\nMy Personal âLiving Fullyâ\n\nOn most nights you can find me practicing my calligraphy or reading books. I also enjoy spending time on mountain trails on sunny weekends; itâs a great way to hang out with friends. Tiger mountain has been one of my favorite local hikes as of late!\n\nMy Heart for Impact\n\nMy local church community is my greatest passion in life. I love people and I enjoy helping people connect with each other. I like having a positive impact in their lives through volunteer work and serving those in need."
