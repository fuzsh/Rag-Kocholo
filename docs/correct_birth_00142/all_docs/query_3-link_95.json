        "text": "Michael Chang looked back to his career and his triumph at Roland Garros in 1989 at the age of 17 in an interview to tennis website Behind the Raquet. The US player of Taiwanese origin became the youngest player in history to win a Grand Slam title.\n\nChang won a total of 34 ATP titles and was a three-time Grand Slam finalist. He reached a career-high of world number 2 in 1996. He won the Davis Cup title in 1990 with the US team and reached the quarter finals at Wimbledon in 1994, the ATP Finals title match in 1995 and two Grand Finals at the Australian Open and at the US Open in 1996.\n\nChang played his most famous match in the quarter final of the 1989 French Open where he came back from two sets down to beat Ivan Lendl 4-6 4-6 6-3 6-3 6-3. The US teenager was playing in his second French Open and his fifth Grand Slam singles event. Lendl was the world number 1 at that time and won three of the previous five editions of the French Open.\n\nChang suffered cramps and adopted some unusual tactics in an attempt to overcome the physical problem and shocked Lendl with an underarm serve. Chang continued to suffer from cramps, but he was able to take a 5-3 lead in the fifth set earning two match points on Lendl’s serve. Chang stood behind the service line while he was waiting to receive Lendl’s second serve. The tactic worked, as Lendl made a double fault to give Chang the win.\n\nDuring his interview to Behind the Raquet Chang admitted that he could have enjoyed his career a little bit more.\n\n“I think that there is probably one thing I would change about my time on tour, my mentality. When you are on tour, you have invincibility, to some degree. You don’t realize how quickly the time goes by. I think sometimes you are out there playing and you are thinking. Okay I am done with this year. I have next year on the tour. I turned pro slightly before my 16th birthday. I retired before my 32nd birthday. Those years just went by in a blink of an eye. Looking back, I could have enjoyed some moments, such as tournament victories. I think sometimes you win a tournament and if it’s a smaller tournament and if it’s a smaller tournament, you don’t really think twice about it. You just say: ‘Okay, It was a great tournament. I won it’.\n\n“I probably would have taken more time to enjoy being world number two in the world. I might have changed my mentality in certain aspects of training. Had I known that I was going to play professionally for over fifteen years. I probably would have approached training differently. Today, players on tour have great longevity thanks to how they take care of their bodies. This process is much more advanced now and is very beneficial to a lot of the older players. Many guys in the top 10 can now play through their mid-to-late 30s. You surely didn’t see in my generation”.\n\nChang has coached Kei Nishikori since 2014 and led the Japanese player to the US Open final.\n\n“For me, whether I am out helping Kei, my daughter, or a club player, it’s just a matter of enjoying it and helping players improve. It is rewarding to see the satisfaction on their faces when they say: ‘I understand that, I got it and that works’. For Kei, the rewards were the results that happened on tour. They came pretty quickly, which was a good thing. Kei is one of those players that picks up things incredibly fast. In so many ways he is a joy to watch”\n\nChang talked about the technology that changed tennis completely and the difference between the playing styles in his era and the current period. . “Tennis has changed as the raquet technology has evolved. If you look at my generation of players, you had a pretty good mix of baseliners, serve and volleyers, all-court players, and chip and chargers. You had a lot of different styles to play against. Nowadays, you don’t see that much variety. Current players can generate more power and spin. They grew up playing with the new technology and they know how to utilize it to the best of their ability. None of the guys that played in my generation still use their older raquets and strings, because the new technology allows to do much more with less effort”, said Chang.\n\nLaura Samson has become the first player born in 2008 to reach the quarter-finals of a WTA event after producing a surprise win on Tuesday.\n\nThe 16-year-old wildcard stunned second seed Katerina Siniakova 1-6, 7-5, 6-3, in the second round at the Prague Open. Her triumph occurred a day after she dropped just two games against Tara Wurth in her opening match. This week is Samson’s Tour debut after playing 10 events on the lower-level ITF circuit.\n\n“I’m extremely surprised,” she said during her on-court interview after beating Siniakova. “I didn’t go into it as favorite. I’m so proud of myself and I hope I will continue to play like this. As I was going into the second set I thought, ‘I have nothing to lose, I didn’t play good in the first set.’ I’m not really sure when [I thought I could win], I just believed myself in the third set.”\n\nSamson is the latest Czech player to break through following a sucessful junior career. Last year she won the Wimbledon girls’ doubles title and was runner-up in the French Open singles tournament in June. She is currently No.3 in the ITF junior rankings but has been ranked as high as No.1.\n\nEarlier this year, Samson decided to change her name on the Tour by dropping the last three letters (ova). The reason why she did so was to avoid getting confused with another player.\n\n“I first noticed it last year, there was a problem that I was getting strings (the) of Lyudmila Samsonova,” she told tenisovysvet.cz.\n\n“I also talked about it with her and, for example, according to the schedule, she also sometimes thought she was playing, but it was me,”\n\n“I would have liked the ending -ová, but unfortunately it turned out like this.”\n\nThe teenager will next take on world No.248 Oksana Selekhmeteva with the winner of that match progressing to their first WTA semi-final. 21-year-old Selekhmeteva is a former top 10 junior player who came through two rounds of qualifying to reach the main draw. She is a two-time junior Grand Slam champion in doubles.\n\nThere are five seeds remaining in the tournament, including top seed Linda Nosková who will play Germany’s Ella Seidel in her next match.\n\nAlex de Minaur says it is a ‘dream come true’ for him to represent Australia in the Olympic Games after missing the event three years ago.\n\nThe world No.6 had been in a race against time to be fit for the Olympic tennis event after suffering an agonising injury setback at Wimbledon earlier this month. At the All England Club de Minaur reached the quarter-final stage for the first time and was set to take on Novak Djokovic. However, he was forced to withdraw from the match after tearing the fibre cartilage in his hip region after suffering a ‘freak’ injury. At the time of the announcement, it was estimated that he would be sidelined from the Tour for three to six weeks.\n\nHowever, the 25-year-old appears to have recovered fairly quickly in time for Paris with the tennis tournament starting on Saturday. It will be de Minaur’s debut in the Olympics after he was forced to pull out of the Tokyo Games due to a positive COVID-19 test.\n\n“To finally be able to represent Australia in the Olympics is a dream come true,” he wrote on Instagram on Tuesday morning.\n\n“I’m very passionate when I play for my country and wear the green and gold, so this is another one of those moments.\n\n“I’m extremely excited to lace up for Paris 2024.”\n\nDe Minaur is bidding to become the first male player from his country to win an Olympic medal in the singles event. He has already won two ATP titles this year in Alcapulco and s-Hertogenbosch. Since the start of January, he has won five out of 11 meetings against top 10 players.\n\n“It’s really great news – we’re actually expecting Alex to arrive in the village ahead of the official draw (on Thursday) and we know he’s been working with his rehab team quite extensively since the conclusion of Wimbledon,” Australian chef de mission Anna Meares told the Australian Associated Press (AAP).\n\n“He’s hungry to be here, he wants to be a part of this team and we will offer as much support as we can in that process.\n\n“He’s coming – we will wait to see that process. He still has time … injury can be a really stressful thing for an athlete and the more you rush it, the more problems you can potentially cause.\n\n“We’re leaving it in the hands of Alex and his rehabilitation team … it will be a decision purely by them.”\n\nDe Minaur is one of five Australian men playing in the Paris Olympics. The others are Alexei Popyrin, Matthew Ebden, John Peers and Rinky Hijikata.\n\nHolger Rune will have a second medical opinion on Monday before deciding if he is fit enough to play at the Olympic Games, according to his team.\n\nThe Danish world No.17 recently retired from his quarter-final match at the Hamburg Open due to a knee injury. The hope at the time was that his withdrawal would be just a precautionary measure ahead of the Olympics. However, he is also dealing with a second issue that appears to be more serious.\n\nAccording to TV 2 Sport, Rune has been struggling with a wrist issue and underwent a scan on Sunday which his mother Aneke says ‘doesn’t look promising.’ Aneke is also the manager of her son’s career. Rune’s Olympic dreams now rest on the outcome of a second medical expert that he will visit tomorrow who has a better understanding of the sport.\n\n“Unfortunately, it does not look promising after the first medical opinion after the review of the scan of the wrist,” Aneke Rune told TV 2 Sport.\n\n“We are waiting for two tennis-specific doctors who will give a second opinion tomorrow (Monday). Tennis wrists look different from regular wrists, so we’ll hold out hope for one more day.”\n\nRune is one of three Danish players entered into the Olympic tennis event along with Caroline Wozniacki and Clara Tauson. The country has only won one medal in tennis before which was at the 1912 Games when Sofie Castenschiold won silver in the women’s indoor singles event.\n\nSo far this season, the 21-year-old has won 27 matches on the Tour but is yet to claim a title. He reached the final of the Brisbane International and then the semi-finals of three more events. In the Grand Slams, he made it to the fourth round of the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nIt is not known when a final decision regarding Rune’s participation in Paris will be made."
