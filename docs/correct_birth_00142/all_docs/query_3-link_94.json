[China Foto Press]\n\nThe tennis genius, who was acquainted with Chinese when he was called Zhang Depei, came as the guest sportscaster at the Shanghai Sports Channel for the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup slated for September 12-19.\n\n\"I wish I could have the chance to coach tennis in China,\" said 34-year-old Chang, who triumphed in the French Open in 1989 when he was just 17 years and three months old.\n\n\"I want to have my future career as coach in China, but right now I have no specific plan for that,\" said Chang, adding he had¡¡talks with the Chinese Tennis Association about the coaching job.\n\n\"Chinese female players such as Li Na and Peng Shuai will boast a good future in the world.\n\n\"I saw Li play against Sharapova at the US Open this year. She is physically strong and has a feeling for tennis, but she should play more tactically and technically,\" said Chang in struggling Chinese, yet making no comments on whether he would come to coach the Chinese female players.\n\n\"I won't say good bye to tennis. God gives what it takes to me and I will make good use of the talents,\" added Chang, who has been learning Chinese in Beijing for five weeks.\n\nHe was remembered as his thrilling five-set win for the 1989 French Open title over Stefan Edberg and his round of 16 win over former world number one Ivan Lendl, in which he served underhanded at one point after cramping but won 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 in a four-hour 37-minute match."
