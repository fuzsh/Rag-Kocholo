        "text": "Michael Chang grew up in the Northwest city of Seattle, USA, where he studied classical violin from the age of five. While at university, he took an interest in traditional Irish music and performed for several years in Irish pubs along the West Coast of the United States.\n\nIn 1999, Michael traveled to Ireland to immerse himself in traditional music and settled down in Galway, where he has remained ever since. He has become a regular fixture in the cityâ€™s music scene, anchoring several trad sessions per week in various pubs around the city, as well as playing in several different bands in a variety of genres and musical styles. He is often called upon as a studio session musician, and has been recorded playing on over 20 Irish albums from various artists over the years."
