He is the Section Chief for gastroenterology and hepatology at the VA Portland Health Care System, Associate Professor of Medicine at OHSU and the Program Director for the Transplant Hepatology Fellowship program. Dr. Chang's areas of clinical interest include quality initiatives in Advanced Liver Disease, non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis, and the use of ECHO to improve specialty care access. Dr Chang is a co-investigator on an NIH funded study looking at symptom burden in patient-caregiver dyads with end stage liver disease to better understand the trajectory of symptoms and how best to support this challenging population.\n\nBefore scheduling your appointment, we recommend you contact your insurance company to verify that the OHSU Health location or provider you plan to visit is included in your network. Your insurance company will also be able to inform you of any copayments, co–insurance, or deductibles that will be your responsibility. If you proceed in scheduling an appointment and your health insurance benefits do not participate with OHSU providers, your out of pocket liability may be higher. Visit the billing and insurance section of our site for more information."
