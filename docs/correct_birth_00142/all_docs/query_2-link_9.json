        "text": "(born 1972). The youngest male tennis player ever to win a Grand Slam singles tournament was American Michael Chang, who won the French Open in 1989 at the age of 17 years, 3 1/2 months. His victory also made him the first American male to win the French Open since Tony Trabert in 1955.\n\nChang was born on February 22, 1972, in Hoboken, New Jersey. His parents had emigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan. He first picked up a racket at the age of six after watching his father play in local tournaments. Chang’s obvious competitiveness and talent eventually led the family to move to San Diego, California, where the weather was more favorable to year-round outdoor play. Among Chang’s many amateur titles was the 1987 United States Tennis Association junior championship.\n\nStanding 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 meters) and weighing only 160 pounds (72.6 kilograms), Chang depended greatly on his speed, quick reflexes, and conditioning to help him defeat larger, more powerful opponents. Turning professional in 1988, he quickly rose in the world rankings. He won his first pro singles title that season and was named Newcomer of the Year by the Association of Tennis Professionals.\n\nChang had moved up to 19th in the world by the time of the 1989 French Open, but few would have predicted the teenager’s triumph at the tournament. In the semifinals, he faced Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia—the world’s top-ranked player at the time. In one of the greatest comebacks in the history of the French Open, Chang, though hampered by severe leg cramps, rallied from two sets down to defeat Llendl 4–6, 4–6, 6–3, 6–3, 6–3 and advance to the finals against Stefan Edberg of Sweden. Chang claimed the French Open title by again earning a come-from-behind victory, defeating Edberg 6–1, 3–6, 4–6, 6–4, 6–2 in another thrilling match.\n\nChang continued to play in major tennis competitions throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century. Highlights included reaching the finals of the 1995 French Open, the 1996 U.S. Open, and the 1996 Australian Open. Chang attained a career-high singles rank of second in the world on September 9, 1996.\n\nAt the time of his retirement from the professional tour in 2003, Chang had 662 career victories and had earned more than $19 million in prize money. Off the court, he was active in the Chang Family Foundation—an organization his family established in 1999 to promote Christianity through youth programs."
