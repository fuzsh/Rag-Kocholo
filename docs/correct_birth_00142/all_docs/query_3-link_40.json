        "text": "TENNIS\n\nIt is a shame that a player as talented as Michael Chang managed to win only one Grand Slam title in what was an otherwise illustrious career. Despite playing in as many as four Grand Slam finals between 1989 and 1996, the only one that the American managed to win happened to be his first attempt, courtesy of a five-set win over Stefan Edberg.\n\nHis success at the 1989 French Open is etched in the annals of tennis history for posterity. En route to this historic success, Chang not only came from two sets down to beat Ivan Lendl, the top-ranked player at the time but also a three-time champion at Roland Garros, but also, at the age of 17 years, 3 months, and 20 days, became the youngest-ever men’s singles champion in a Grand Slam competition. Chang retains the distinction.\n\nDespite his underwhelming follow-up to his success in Paris, the American player managed significant results elsewhere. He won a total of seven Masters 1000 tournaments, and achieved a career-best ranking of No. 2 in 1996. Besides, the player won 34 of the 58 ATP Tour finals he played in. That being said, there is a somewhat strange pattern to these successes."
