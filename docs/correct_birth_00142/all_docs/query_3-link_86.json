        "text": "Michael Chang was not everyone’s favorite player when he stunned the world at the 1989 French Open, becoming the youngest Grand Slam champion in men’s tennis history at age 17.\n\nHis on-court spirit captured the hearts of many Americans, but Chang’s outspoken Christian faith also created plenty of detractors. He was outspoken about his faith after each of his thrilling victories during that French Open championship run, including after his final win over heavily favored Stefan Edberg.\n\nLove him or hate him, Chang has accomplished a lot to help improve the world, and not just on the tennis court, where he was known for his speed and defensive baseline play. A top-10 player for several years in the 1990s, Chang – who also pioneered the jumping two-handed backhand – reached No. 2 in the world in 1996. But his greatest legacy will be his charities: the Prince of Peace Children’s Home in Tianjin, China, and the Chang Family Foundation.\n\nOn par with Chang’s heart for helping people, the Michael Chang Tennis Classic held at the Newport Beach Tennis Club from July 26-28 will help high school students who are not among the elite in their age group.\n\n“Because there are so many USTA sanctioned junior tournaments, we changed up our high school division just to give high school players who maybe don’t play in as many tournaments the opportunity to play in a competitive tournament environment,” Chang said. “We’re trying to introduce them to tournament play and at the same time develop a lot more camaraderie.”\n\nThe Chang Family Foundation is operating the tournament and Chang’s parents, Joe and Betty, are Newport Beach Tennis Club members. Irvine Valley College will host singles and doubles matches in the high school division, in which the winners will receive a scholarship in their name directed to their high school tennis program.\n\nThe adult tournament will consist of players of various skill levels, ranging from a 3.5 rating to an Open Division. It will be a USTA-sanctioned event in which players have the option of competing in men’s and women’s singles, doubles and mixed doubles. The Open Division tends to be very competitive as college players and young professionals come out to compete. Prize money is awarded to division winners.\n\nThe high school tournament is unique compared to other junior tournaments because it is not a sanctioned event and only for players ranked outside of the top 75 in Southern California.\n\nIn the adult tournament, Newport Beach Tennis Club pros Rick Leach and Scott Davis are expected to compete in the men’s open singles and doubles divisions. There are also divisions for women’s open singles and mixed open doubles.\n\nChang launched his foundation more than a decade ago to help people get involved in sports and “introduce people to Christ by using sports as an avenue through which individuals can see, hear, and experience the Christian faith,” according to the Chang Family Foundation website.\n\nChang originally started a tennis league through his foundation that held matches once a week. When the league became successful, he held a one-day tournament in Seattle that was such a hit that he decided to bring a tournament to Southern California.\n\nThis year, the tournament is expected to be even larger than it was in its first two years. According to Chang, 450 players competed last year and registrations are on pace to exceed that number this year.\n\n“I’ve been so blessed through the sport of tennis and it’s been incredible to play professionally for so long,” Chang said. “Now I have the opportunity to give back to the community and put on an event that gets people excited. It’s just exciting to bring all these tennis players together. That’s really what sports are all about, bringing people together.”\n\nContact the writer: dunnwriter@yahoo.com"
