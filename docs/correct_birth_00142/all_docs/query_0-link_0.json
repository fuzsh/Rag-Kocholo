        "text": "Turning pro at just 15 years of age, Michael Chang set numerous “youngest player records.” In 1987, he was the youngest player to win a main draw match at the U.S. Open and the youngest to reach a Tour semifinal. Becoming the youngest French Open / Grand Slam Champion ever in 1989, he then became the youngest to rank in the Top 5. Chang ended an American drought at the French Open, when he became the first American male to win the tournament since 1955. In 1991 he reached the quarterfinals or better in 13 tournaments. On the court, Michael’s real strength is his return game. Chang was considered one of the fastest players on the circuit, possessing an all-court game.\n\nFavorite color: Blue\n\nFavorite food: Chinese – of course!\n\nFavorite book(s): Bible, Christian books that tell of life experiences or stories\n\nFavorite sport (after tennis): Golf and fishing\n\nFavorite tournament: I have too many favorites…all for different reasons\n\nMost memorable tournament/match: Round of 16 with Ivan Lendl at the 1989 French Open, and the night match with John McEnroe at the US Open that didn’t finish until around 1:30am\n\nQ) You have often been compared to David, from the Bible. Is it true that he is your favorite character from the Bible?\n\nA) I can’t say that I really have a favorite Bible character, but I do enjoy learning from and reading about so many of them. Depending on where I am in life, I can always find a character to relate to since the Bible covers every aspect of life. And because the Bible is God’s blueprint for how we are to live, I know that I can trust it with complete confidence.\n\nQ) What do you with your time, now that you are retired?\n\nA) Besides being a husband and full time dad to 3 young children, since 2014 I have been coaching Kei Nishikori on the ATP Tour. The Chang Family Foundation also continues to occupy a fair amount of time especially with our Christian Sports League (CSL) ministry and the annual Michael Chang Tennis Classic. The Michael Chang Tennis Classic is a USTA sanctioned charity tennis tournament benefitting CFF and local charitable organizations."
