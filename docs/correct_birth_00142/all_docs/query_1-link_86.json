        "text": "Following the NBA lockout, Lin was cut twice and then sent to the NBA Development League, making his sophomore breakout even more unexpected than Chang's run at the 1989 French Open.\n\nIn his second year as a pro, a 17-year-old Chang entered Roland Garros as the 19th-ranked player in the world. In the Round of 16 he beat top-ranked Ivan Lendl in an epic match, then came back from down two sets to one to beat third-ranked Stefan Edberg in the final.\n\nThe win inspired many Asian Americans to pick up tennis. They wanted to be like Mike.\n\nChang feels many more will now head to the basketball court.\n\n\"In the tennis world, there weren't a whole lot of Asians playing. You see it a little bit more now. The same can really be said for basketball,\" Chang said. \"There were only a couple of Asian guys before Jeremy [in the NBA] -- Yao Ming being the most prominent. I feel people can relate to Jeremy a little bit easier. He's 6-3, not a huge guy. People could never say: 'I want to be like Yao Ming.'\""
