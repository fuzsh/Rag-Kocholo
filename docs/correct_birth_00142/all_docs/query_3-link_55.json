        "text": "\"JD degree required. California State Bar or license to practice in California. Minimum of 10 years of relevant legal experience at a top-tier law firm or in-house. Experience in licensing preferred. Must have strong contract drafting and negotiating skills. Knowledge of legal matters relating to merchandising, licensing, promotions, trademark and copyright laws (international and domestic) preferred. Must be fluent in English and Chinese (Cantonese and Mandarin). Additionally, fluency in Japanese and/or Korean a strong plus.\" This was the posted description for the job that I currently hold, and have held, in various iterations, for the past 15 years. You will notice that nowhere on the description is \"being a good people manager\" listed as a required skill set. Yet, that skill set has become indispensable to my continued development as a legal executive at Warner Bros. Studios. It is a skill that demands continuous learning. \"Treat employees like they make a difference, and they will.\" #WBLife #WBDLife #dundermifflin\n\nIt was right around this time when I was a junior associate at a Century City law firm that I remember seeing Keanu Reeves in Warner Bros.' The Matrix and thinking.. do I need to take the red pill to learn a potentially life-changing truth? From there, I took a risk, and my path diverged from that of the “typical” associate. I not only went in-house at a relatively early stage of my career, but I moved to a rural area in a country relatively foreign to me. I was going after my dream: to do something that didn't come naturally, and to become knowledgeable in a long-held passion: Japanese culture. I did learn as much as I could about my chosen field — the consumer electronics and consumer products business in Asia — by working closely with and absorbing knowledge from world-class managers and engineers who spent their professional lives honing their craft. At first, not speaking the language — yet physically resembling a Japanese national — I was teased about my “foreignness.” This brought back memories of grade school. As bad as the experience seemed at the time, however, being immersed in the Japanese culture turned out to be fortuitous. At some point during my seven-plus year stay in Japan, I realized that I had achieved a fairly high level of fluency in three languages: Mandarin Chinese, English and Japanese. I also found that that being multilingual gives a lawyer, particularly an in-house lawyer who is part of a global team of professionals, a competitive advantage. Thirty years later, I feel at home in any negotiating environment, in Asia and the U.S. I regularly review, in multiple languages, Batman branding style guides, Tom and Jerry trademark filings, Harry Potter marketing materials and websites, and Looney Tunes licensing contracts — providing significant cost-savings to my employer. Looking back, and now being part of an organization that's a 100 year-old brand that reaches a global audience, my \"foreign\" background not only became a career advantage, but it also enriched my life. https://lnkd.in/gFqYKAh8 #inhousecounsel #workingabroad #accsocal #INTA2023 #INTA2024"
