        "text": "It may have taken a little bit longer than some had hoped, but the Mile Square City once again has a dedicated pool hall that features ping pong tables and will be getting golf simulators soon.\n\nEver since the Willow Billiard Lounge closed several years ago, Hoboken’s pool scene has been limited to select bars around the city. But last summer, we broke the news that an industrial property at 1012 Grand Street was being revamped into a new recreational facility by Ian Rintel, who ran Hoboken Golf at 125 Grand Street for almost 15 years before the property was torn down for redevelopment.\n\nOn appeal, Hoboken’s zoning board granted Rintel a D-1 use variance to allow the project to move forward. The newly soft-opened space, now dubbed Hoboken Billiards and designed by OLMK Architects, spans 15,000 square feet along the building’s entire third floor and features eleven-foot ceilings with an industrial look. A dozen brand new tables, including nine-foot Brunswick Gold Crown IV’s and seven-foot Valley Bar Boxes, are featured at the property, as are eight ping pong tables.\n\nHoboken Billiards doesn’t have a liquor license but does provide complimentary bottled water, iced tea, lemonade, and popcorn for patrons. In addition, menus from local restaurants are provided for customers to order food for delivery. Rates during the launch for either billiards or ping pong are set at $10/hour per person during the day, $15/hour per person during evenings, or $25/person for an all-day pass. Those interested in playing billiards and table tennis can pay a bit more for both.\n\nThe soft opening of Hoboken Billiards is well timed, as the building recently saw local artist Ricardo Roig complete a mural depicting Hoboken-born tennis great Michael Chang on the south side of the property. The new business is located on the third floor and is open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. Those who wish to call ahead can reach them at (201) 876-9666, Ext. 1.\n\nRelated:"
