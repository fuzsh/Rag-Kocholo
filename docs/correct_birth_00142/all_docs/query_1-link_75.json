        "text": "MICHAEL CHING (b.1958) is an American composer, conductor, and music administrator. He is best known nationally as the composer of innovative operas, including his a cappella adaptation of Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” (2011). His other major operas include “Buoso’s Ghost” (1996), “Corps of Discovery” (2003), “Slaying the Dragon” (2012), “Speed Dating Tonight!” (2013), and “Alice Ryley” (2015). He wrote the librettos of many of his own operas.\n\nChing was born in 1958 in Honolulu, Hawaii. Before he was one year old, his family left Honolulu, and he grew up in New Orleans and Saint Paul, Minnesota.\n\nChing started piano at the age of six and was quite skilled at it, at one point considering a career as a concert pianist. In addition, he studied flute, violin, and oboe, mostly for the sake of composition. He started composing as a child, and by the time he reached high school he had studied composition at Interlochen.\n\nHe attended Duke University on a composition scholarship, studying with Robert Ward and Iain Hamilton. He graduated in 1980, and his senior project was a one-act opera retelling a vampire story set in New Orleans.\n\nChing began his career as a National Opera Institute apprentice 1980–1981 at the Houston Grand Opera Studio, where he was involved in the company’s productions and continued his composition studies with composer Carlisle Floyd. From 1981 to 1985 he held increasingly responsible positions at the Greater Miami Opera/Florida Grand Opera. He subsequently held conductor and executive director positions at venues including Texas Opera Theatre, Chautauqua Opera, and Triangle Music Theater.\n\nIn 1989 he was appointed Assistant to the General Director of Virginia Opera. He was subsequently the company’s Associate Artistic Director from 1991 through mid 1992.\n\nIn 1992 Ching joined Opera Memphis as Artistic Director, a position he held through 2010. He was the opera’s General Director for most of those years as well.\n\nHe left Opera Memphis for Iowa in the spring of 2010 when his wife Barbara, a university professor and a native Iowan, was named chair of the English department at Iowa State University.\n\nIn addition to being a freelance composer and conductor, Ching is also Chairman of the Douglas Moore Fund for American Opera, which supports emerging opera creators. He was Music Director of Nickel City Opera in Buffalo, New York, from 2012 to 2017, and he has been Music Director of Amarillo Opera in Amarillo, Texas, since September 2016.\n\nIn 2019 he was elected to the board of directors of the National Opera Association.\n\nSelected works\n\nLeo: Opera in One Cat (1985)\n\nCue 67 (1992)\n\nKing of the Clouds (1993)\n\nBuoso’s Ghost (1996)\n\nOut of the Rain (1998)\n\nFaith (1999)\n\nCorps of Discovery (2003)\n\nThree Pigs Remix (2006)\n\nA Midsummer Night’s Dream (2011)\n\nSlaying the Dragon (2012)\n\nSpeed Dating Tonight!
