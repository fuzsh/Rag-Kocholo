        "text": "Michael Chang Chun-wai is no stranger to flying close to the sun when it comes to the Jockey Club’s trainers’ benchmark, but with a string of in-form gallopers at his disposal the veteran handler is “confident” this won’t be his last season in the job.\n\nWhile Chang took until July to avoid a third strike and the likely end of his career last season, the 62-year-old is eager to take the pressure off as quickly as possible this time around.\n\nAfter two winners from the past three meetings to go with a further five placings, Chang heads to Sha Tin on Sunday with a handful of chances as he looks to bank the three wins in Class Four or above he requires to meet the benchmark of 16 victories for single-site handlers.\n\nOnly two victories in Class Five count for benchmark purposes and Chang has used his quota.\n\nChing played a big role in Chang’s survival last term, delivering the handler four of his 19 successes, and the five-year-old looks well placed stepping up to a mile in his second run back from a bleed.\n\nA fast-finishing third over seven furlongs earlier this month, Ching returns to the course and distance of all four of his career wins for the Class Three Members Cup.\n\n“He came back really well and this time I’ve got Hugh Bowman on him. The mile is better than 1,400m for him and he’s a chance,” Chang said.\n\nWhile Bowman replaces Lyle Hewitson aboard Ching, Karis Teetan retains the ride on last-start runner-up Lady’s Choice for the Class Three Levade Handicap (1,200m).\n\nWinless so far this season, Lady’s Choice is looking to salute for the first time since producing the victory that saved Chang’s career last July.\n\n“He’s been knocking on the door a few times and he’s been so unlucky. He’s very consistent, his condition is stable and I expect him to run another good race. He’s always unlucky – second beaten by a super horse, the wrong ground or a bad gate,” Chang said of Lady’s Choice, who jumps from gate six.\n\nCommanding Missile in the Class Five Ownership Pride Handicap (1,200m) and Lost Child in the Class Three Beijing Clubhouse Handicap (1,400m) are the other last-start placegetters Chang will wheel out this weekend.\n\nAfter suffering a heart irregularity in March, Lost Child returned with a close third on April 28 and Chang’s prayers for a good gate have been rewarded, with the four-year-old to jump from gate three under Ben Thompson.\n\n“He had a little heart problem but he seems OK now. Last time he ran well and I pray for the good gate for this horse and he should improve,” Chang said.\n\nWhile Chang was left smiling after Ellis Wong Chi-wang speared Big Red to victory at Happy Valley on Wednesday night, the apprentice jockey’s night turned sour five races later when he was hit with a three-meeting ban for careless riding aboard Gallant Crown.\n\nWhile initially agreeing to serve his suspension between May 29 and June 6, Wong requested his ban be moved forward so he can ride at Happy Valley on June 5. He will now miss the meetings on May 26, May 29 and June 2.\n\nMeanwhile, Voyage Bubble tuned up for his showdown with Romantic Warrior in next month’s Group One Yasuda Kinen (1,600m) with a comfortable trial victory on the Sha Tin turf on Thursday morning.\n\nVoyage Bubble and Romantic Warrior will travel to Japan on May 21 and while both have also been entered for the Group One Takarazuka Kinen (2,200m) on June 23, it is at this stage considered unlikely they will run."
