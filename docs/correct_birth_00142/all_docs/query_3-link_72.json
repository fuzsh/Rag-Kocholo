        "text": "Publisher: Really Serious Literature\n\nRelease Date: September 9, 2021\n\nIn the battle of style versus substance, great writers seek the détente. If their substance is the ammunition, the bomb they are dropping, the style comes in like a spy, whispering into the eager ears of the reader, preparing, making the argument, for there is always an argument, palatable and charming. As Victor Hugo states, “Style is the substance of the subject called unceasingly to the surface.”\n\nIf poetic style is seduction and substance is the penetration, the poet Michael Chang offers both in 男友•视角BOYFRIEND PERSPECTIVE (Really Serious Literature, Fall 2021). As they say in the poem STRANGER DANGER, “A lot of ppl write pretty words but don’t say shit.” Michael Chang has the polish and the perspective to say so much in a way you won’t forget, and this full length is the rare book that will both teach you things and make you laugh.\n\nI have to confess Michael Chang is one of my very favorite poets. I was honored to publish “Area Code 604,” in my anthology Pinkprint and nominate it for Best of the Net. This poem introduced me to Chang’s charmingly potent perspective. The poem seamlessly alternates between the personal, the sexual, the political from the Stanford Prison Experiment, Chinese Exclusion to sexual domination. It was love at first read to me, and I’ve been a big fan ever since.\n\nI felt honored to get a sneak peek at 男友•视角BOYFRIEND PERSPECTIVE in order to write this review. Per usual with Chang’s poetry, it is full of:\n\nwisdom – “everyone carries with them the capacity to wound, to disappoint; the sooner you realize that, the better off you’ll be,” ADMISSION\n\nwriting advice – “you can lie in poems,” PRAIRIE OYSTER\n\nliterary criticism – “good art is always smarter than the person who made it,” PINK STEGOSAURUS\n\nphilosophy – “Lately I have been so delighted by movies about shoplifters & scam artists & ppl really sticking it to the Man, stealing, but I find myself rooting for the underdog, revenge of the nerds & some such, you’re programmed in this country to want the underdog to win,” SEAN​ ★​L​ENNON\n\nsurvival tips – “When approached by law enforcement: avoid unprovoked / flight, do not call them pigs, do not be black, know your / rights (you have none), regret your existence, get a lawyer (if / still alive),” RULES FOR AMERICAN LIFE\n\npolitical commentary – “we need a government where we don’t have to / depend on the mercy of bureaucrats or the kindness of / strangers,” 零 (ZERO)\n\nqueerness – “in China, ‘bitten peach’ is code for queerness,” UGLYCUTE\n\nboys - “a boy, to put it plainly, is a loathsome thing,” ROSEBUD\n\nfilm commentary – “I want to have never seen Jurassic Park / I want to be / unburdened by the knowledge of Jeff Goldblum as sex / symbol,” HIGH DRAMA PANDA FURY\n\nracism – “we order duck confit & baked alaska / not knowing what to / expect / they say what a pretty family / too bad they are chinks,” FIELD NOTES ON THE PRODIGAL SON\n\npop culture – “is Ryan Murphy killing off the cast of Glee,” BRIGHT WHITE NOISE 天使脸 • 恶魔心\n\nI could pull lines from this manuscript for pages that delight, enlighten, infuriate and encourage me. It’s the style of the poet to interpose the trivia of modern life with substantive universal truths about racism, homophobia, xenophobia and the judicial system. They do this uniquely well in a way that solidifies why Michael Chang is a poet’s poet – someone so many writers I know respect fiercely and admire.\n\nIn a poem like 零 (ZERO), Congressional testimony by the Director of Central Intelligence Roscoe Hillenkoetter on the subject of homosexuals being unfit to hold public office is dissected by Chang and annotated with personal commentary. It is a powerful juxtaposition of a broader policy that I myself, a bisexual person, was, naively, unaware of -- more aware of the modern and equally hate-filled debate about military service for the openly homosexual. Chang includes excerpts of the testimony like “homosexuals have ‘psychopathic tendencies which affect the soundness of their judgment, physical cowardice, susceptibility to pressure and general instability, thus making a pervert vulnerable in many ways.” While I’m sadly not completely shocked at this outrageous hate speech, it was very powerful to see the efforts to codify such beliefs and prohibit any kind of general public service.\n\n零 (ZERO) is a poem that reflects a way of thinking that still exists in puritanical, conservative subcultures today. In the Deep South, where I’m from, it represents a lot of my fears of being discovered to be bisexual – an essential component of myself; my puritanically, abusive family still does not know. Chang educates, offers a substantive cultural commentary of the history of this prejudice. That they can do this while interspersing facts with chuckles about Snoopy and Dairy Queen is what eliminates the potential pedantry of such a discourse. Chang couches this horrible history between giggles and the personal.\n\nThey are the ultimate cool teacher who knows how to speak a startling intelligence in the language of the student. Their pithy, pop cultural references invite a reader, first, to relate, then to commiserate with the difficulties of their perspective and ultimately to celebrate -- for Chang’s is a voice that deserves to be celebrated. It imbues, ultimately, a joy in the details of the collective human experience. But what makes Chang inspirational and exceptional is their ability to hold one’s perspective in life inside the frame of a poem and write from it with utter confidence and authority. This full length is full of pretty words and says a lot of shit we all need to hear about hate and love in all its forms.\n\nPublisher: Vegetarian Alcoholic Press (2020)\n\nISBN: 978-1-952055-00-3\n\nLike the author's first chapbook, For Boys Who Went, the significant theme in this book is of a country scarred by ineptitude and episodes of terrorist attacks – leaving a number of families broken, forever; whose major actors are corrupt leaders and the Boko Haram insurgent groups. But unlike the first chapbook, it explores the theme of Identity.\n\nNaturally put, following the arrival of rain, man generally expects flowers to bloom and fruits to grow or ripen; in its metaphoric application and especially in this collection, this implies peace, freedom, birth and can even be the pleasure derived while worshipping the goddess of eros; as expressly enunciated by the poet in \"two weeks before my birthday;\"\n\n\"i am cumming ade / i am still waiting for the arrival of rain\"\n\nWhile exploring the governmental ineptitude amidst myriad challenges bedeviling the growth of Nigeria, Agarau recreates the various events that led to this sorry state in gory images. In \"the origin of loss (pg. 33)\" we read of a mother who lost her son to gunshot in an insurgent attack:\n\n“there is nothing as lucid as a dead boy / & his mother kneeling beside the halved moon leaking out of his body / a shadow sinking into the ground / a fainting of bird songs;”\n\nHe lucidly narrates the ambush further towards the end of the poem: \"...synagogue stacked with dead choirs / the mother of the boy sits beside her son and cries / there is nothing said that will take that loss away\"\n\nAnd in \"a small dialogue about running (pg. 36),\" he writes:\n\n“in kubwa, this is how women match / the night with grief: / they go back into the village whose walls / opened for staccato of bullets / one goes into her house to find her husband's head split into a blend”\n\nAmidst the insecurity staccato is the fear of been killed or detained to not be found again by the security operatives, is the issue of unemployment which has resulted to a number of graduates leaving the country for greener pasture elsewhere, is also those who have no where to go. The poet thus in “what it means to be freed by your country (pg. 25)” tells us what to expect from the citizens – especially the youth, in reaction to the failing country;\n\n\"the boy will someday rise into a / revolution, men revolting against a country that asks for heads / instead of thumbs, blood instead of nods...\"\n\nThese lines for me validate the notion that poets are prophets (or gods) as what he referred to as \"someday\" happened following the publication of the book. After the Nigeria’s 60th Independence Day celebration on October 1st, 2020, Nigerian Youth expressed further their dissatisfaction over bad governance. They started with a protest calling for the ban of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigerian Police Force who have killed a number of young Nigerians extrajudicially. Represented by the #EndSARS hashtag with placards reading “Looking Good Is Not A Crime,” “Stop Killing the Leaders of Tomorrow,” among others, it began in Lagos, then Abuja until it became a nationwide demonstration and got international recognition. For days, #EndSARS was the leading trend on Twitter so much that Jack, CEO of Twitter, endorsed it by posting same and created an emoticon of a 'held up fist' in solidarity. Nigerians in diaspora also staged protest in their various places such as London, Toronto, Chicago, Dubai, Dublin and elsewhere with placards reading, among others, \"We Don't Go Home Because of SARS.\" Police brutality is not the only pandemic eating up Nigerians, but tackling it was a first step to tackling bad governance amidst the insecurity issues.\n\nIn furtherance of this big theme, the poet explores “Identity;” and to analyze identity is to dissect how a man is seen, how he sees himself and how he wants to be seen."
