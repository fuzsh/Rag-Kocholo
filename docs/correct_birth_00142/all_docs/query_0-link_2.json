        "text": "Michael Chang\n\nTennis Player\n\nMichael Chang was born in Hoboken, New Jersey (1972). He grew up watching his father play tennis and started playing at age six. When Chang was 15 years old, he rose to rank 163 in the world, and dropped out of 10th grade after passing his GED in order to pursue a professional tennis career. At age 17, he became the youngest male player to win the Grand Slam singles at the 1989 French Open. Chang represented the United States in the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics and participated in the 2000 Summer Sydney Olympics. Chang was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\n(Portrait by Michelle Yuan, SFSU 2016)"
