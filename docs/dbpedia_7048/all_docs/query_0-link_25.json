Amazon and Polygon Pictures' Lost in Oz: Extended Adventure special won three of the five awards for which it was nominated.\n\nThe special won awards in the \"Outstanding Children's Animated Program,\" \"Outstanding Sound Mixing – Animation,\" and \"Outstanding Sound Editing – Animation\" categories. The special was also nominated in the \"Outstanding Casting for an Animated Series or Special\" and \"Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program\" categories.\n\nNetflix, DreamWorks Animation, and Guillermo del Toro's Trollhunters series won the Outstanding Casting for an Animated Series or Special and Outstanding Writing in an Animated Program categories, as well as four other categories.\n\nLost in Oz is a 3D CG animated project, based on L. Frank Baum's Oz series of books. Polygon Pictures (Knights of Sidonia, Ajin, Sanzoku no Musume Ronja) animated the series, and originally released a pilot version of the feature on Amazon Prime in June 2015. Amazon began streaming the extended version of the feature with 40 minutes of new content on December 2, 2016. Prime Video will air a full season of the show in 2017.\n\nAmazon describes the action adventure comedy story aimed at children:\n\nWhen 12-year-old Dorothy Gale discovers her mother's mysterious journal in her Kansas home, she and her dog, Toto, are transported into a bustling, modern Emerald City. Disoriented and determined to get home, Dorothy embarks on an epic journey with West, a young witch, and Ojo, a giant Munchkin, to seek the magic she needs - as Oz faces its greatest magic crisis.\n\nBureau of Magic, a company established in 2014, produced the project. Flaunt Productions (Project Spark, Under Siege) is credited for design. Adam Berry (The Penguins of Madagascar) composed the music, while Mark Mothersbaugh (The LEGO Movie) composed the theme music.\n\nThanks to Daniel Zelter for the news tip."
