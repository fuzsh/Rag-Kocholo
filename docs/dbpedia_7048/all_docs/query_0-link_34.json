        "text": "Amazon announced Monday that it has ordered six new children’s shows to pilot.\n\nIn addition to the live-action “A History of Radness,” which TheWrap learned exclusively was headed to the streaming service, Amazon has ordered pilots for another live-action show and four animated shows. All six pilot episodes will debut this summer on Amazon Instant Video.\n\nRead the descriptions for all six shows below.\n\nLive-Action\n\n“A History of Radness”\n\nThe show follows siblings Jack and Tessie from their middle school beginnings at Pleasant Meadows Middle School to the start of their music careers as they put together a band of like-minded musicians, considered outsiders by fellow classmates. The series is written and executive produced by Andrew Green (“Hannah Montana”),\n\nThe project is also executive produced by Skot Bright (“Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: Running Down a Dream”) and will feature original music written by Hutch Harris of the post-pop-punk trio The Thermals with original score by James Iha (The Smashing Pumpkins, A Perfect Circle). Henry Rollins (“Sons of Anarchy,” “Black Flag”) guest stars as Coach Carlucci and Imagine Dragons’ Dan Reynolds and Best Coast’s Bethany Cosentino lend narration.\n\n“The Kicks”\n\nDevin Burke was the star player on her soccer team back home until her family moved to California midway through the school year. Now, Devin has to rise to the challenge after discovering that her new school team has been on a losing streak over the last few months and is badly in need of a leader to rally the team together.\n\nBased on a book series by US Olympic Gold Medalist and current US Women’s National Team soccer player Alex Morgan and adapted by David Babcock (“Brothers & Sisters,” “Gilmore Girls”), the project is executive produced by Todd Cohen (“Kath & Kim”) and novelist James Frey and his company Full Fathom Five and directed by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum (“Ramona & Beezus,” “Aquamarine”).\n\nAnimated\n\n“The Adventures of Knickerbock Teetertop”\n\nKnickerbock Teetertop, the smallest kid on the enchanted Wonderpine Mountain, wants to be a big adventurer just like his grandpa. Joined by friends on his magical Wonderboggan, Knickerbock, Holly, and Otto have adventures discovering new places and creatures. Knickerbock bounces along rugged terrain, pushes against the elements, and challenges himself to overcome obstacles. As he encounters problems Knickerbock uses perseverance, grit, and some encouragement from Grandpa to “adventure on, adventure through.”\n\nCreated by brother-sister team Adam Wilson and Melanie Wilson LaBracio (Marvel Universe Live, “Evergone”), with character design by Rhode Montijo (“Melvin Beederman: Super Hero,” “The Halloween Kid”), the show is animated by the award-winning Karrot Animation (“Sarah & Duck”).\n\n“Lost in Oz”\n\nThe show is an animated, action-adventure comedy set in a modern, metropolitan Emerald City. Stranded in this spectacular world, 12-year-old Dorothy Gale befriends West, a young, street-smart witch grappling with dark temptations, and Ojo, a giant munchkin. With Dorothy’s dog Toto, this unlikely crew embarks on an journey, seeking out the magic Dorothy needs to get back to Kansas.\n\nDeveloped and produced by Bureau of Magic’s Darin Mark, Jared Mark, Abram Makowka, and Mark Warshaw (“East Los High,” “Smallville”), this contemporary re-imagining of L. Frank Baum’s universe is designed by Flaunt Productions (“Under Siege,” “Project Spark”), animated by Arc Productions (“9,” “Gnomeo & Juliet”), scored by Adam Berry (“The Penguins of Madagascar”) with theme music by Mark Mothersbaugh (“The Lego Movie”).\n\n“Lily the Unicorn”\n\nLily is not only a remarkable, colorful, and comical gal–she is truly one-in-a-million. Her unique perspective and independent spirit can brighten up any situation and often leads her and her loyal friends into unexpected shenanigans.\n\nLily the Unicorn is based on the hit children’s book by Dallas Clayton (“An Awesome Book”) and produced by The Jim Henson Company (“Dinosaur Train,” “Fraggle Rock”).\n\n“Bear in Underwear”\n\nWelcome to Shady Glade Woods where Eddie Behr, an eternally optimistic, high energy bear, and his quirky group of animal friends and family reside. Eddie aspires to be a forest legend just like his dad, who discovered underwearat an abandoned campsite.\n\n“Bear in Underwear” is based on the bestselling books by Todd Goldman and written by Goldman and Dave Schiff (“That 70s Show,” “Robot and Monster”)."
