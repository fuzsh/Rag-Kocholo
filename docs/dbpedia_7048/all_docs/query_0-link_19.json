        "text": "Adam Berry has recently scored two NBC comedy pilots. First up is Susan 313 created by Sarah Silverman who stars in the show as a woman readjusting to the single life after a decade-long live-in relationship. The comedy is loosely based on Silverman’s life and co-stars Jeff Goldblum, Tig Notaro, Ken Leung, Harris Wittels and June Raphael. Ken Kwapis (He’s Just Not That Into You) has directed the pilot and is also executive producing the project with Silverman, Dan Sterling, as well as Ron Howard, Brian Grazer and Francie Calfo for Imagine Entertainment (24, Parenthood, Friday Night Lights). Silverman has also co-written the script with Sterling and Jon Schroeder. The composer has previously scored the comedian’s Comedy Central series The Sarah Silverman Project.\n\nBerry has also taken over scoring duties on the NBC comedy pilot Happy Valley. The show produced by Sony Picture Television is created by Hilary Winston (Happy Endings) and stars Sarah Wright, Freddie Prinze Jr., Mena Suvari, Aubrey Dollar, Kyle Howard and Joanna Kerns. Adam Shankman (Hairspray) has directed the pilot, which follows a shy woman who leans on her co-workers in a bid to come out of her shell and plot her revenge after being dumped by her fiancé. Winston is executive producing with Jamie Tarses (Happy Endings) and Julia Franz. Composer Aaron Zigman has previously been attached to the project as reported earlier this year."
