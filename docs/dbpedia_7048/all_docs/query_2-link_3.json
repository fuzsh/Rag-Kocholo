Sign here!\n\nPenguins of Madagascar or more properly known as Penguins of Madagascar: The MOVIE is a 2014 computer-animated adventure spy comedy film, produced by DreamWorks Animation. It stars Tom McGrath as Skipper, Chris Miller as Kowalski, Conrad Vernon as Rico, Christopher Knights as Private, Benedict Cumberbatch as Agent 'Classified', and John Malkovich as Dave.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe prologue is a flashback set in Southern Antarctica, many years before the events of the first film. Multiple Ad√©lie penguins are walking somewhere. A youthful Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico ask where they are even going, but the other penguins are unconcerned. When an egg rolls by, they comment that they lose a few eggs, and it's nature. Skipper decides to go against nature, and chases the egg, which lands safely on a shipwreck infested with seals. Rico devours the egg and they fool the seals into releasing the harpoon, which sends them on a drifting iceberg. Rico then regurgitates the egg, which hatches into a baby penguin. The baby penguin asks if the trio are his family. Kowalski informs him that he doesn't have a family and they will die. Skipper slaps Kowalski for terrorizing the penguin and informs him they are his family, while naming him \"Private\". As the four soar away, the events of earlier films were set into motion.\n\nThe movie time-skips to the future where Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted left off after defeating Chantel DuBois and her henchmen to send them back to Madagascar in exile. The penguins (except for Private) have grown annoyed and tired of Marty's Afro Circus song along with King Julien's song I Like to Move It, Move It (song Played is Afro Circus-Move It) and plan to take a break from Circus Zaragoza by breaking into the United States gold depository to celebrate Private's 10th birthday. After they infiltrate the building, Skipper asks Private what he would like most in the world. Private responds by saying he would like to be a meaningful and valued member of the team, though Skipper declines and offers him Cheezy Dibbles, a snack. When Private tries to get a bag the vending machine pulls him in. The penguins try to get him out but it grabs them all, bursts out of the building and is carried from a helicopter to a submarine.\n\nAfter eating all of the Cheezy Dibbles, the penguins are released from the vending machine, and escape a cage using Rico's paperclip, though Private unintentionally devours the paper clip in the process. Skipper calls Rico a meaningful and valued member of the team. On the control console, Private starts pressing buttons, which takes them to a mysterious human scientist who strangely knows their names. He introduces himself as Doctor Octavius Brine, before revealing his true identity - David \"Dave\" the Octopus, of which none of the team remembers. So, let's get ready shake up some memories of New York City before the birth of the Penguins' friends. Dave explains that he used to be a star attraction at Central Park Zoo until the penguins arrived. Since then, he was moved from zoo to zoo, always being upstaged by penguins. This contributed to his significant animosity against them. He revealed the Medusa-Serum, a chemical that would mutate any organism into hideous monsters, and orders his octopi henchmen to attack the penguins. The penguins manage to steal a canister and escape into the canals of the Italian city of Venice, going on a canoe chase to escape.\n\nAs they were cornered, a jet appears. A wolf tells them they are now under the protection of the North Wind intelligence agency. Skipper demands answers and he tells them that the North Wind is an elite undercover force devoted to helping animals who can't help themselves, consisting of himself, Eva, Short Fuse, and Corporal. Skipper proudly introduces his own team, although the North Wind is not interested and brings them to their headquarters.\n\nSkipper is impressed with their technology. Classified wants the penguins to tell him everything they know about Dave. Skipper tells him that Dave is an octopus, and that they managed to steal the Medusa Serum, but then Dave calls the North Wind. Classified mocks Dave for the loss of his serum, but Dave reveals that he has a huge tank of it and reveals his plan to use it on all penguins everywhere. The Penguins prepare to fight Dave, but Classified is still convinced that they are useless, and has them tranquillized and sent to Madagascar.\n\nThe penguins wake up in a cargo plane to Madagascar. Skipper and Kowalski realize what's happening and escape the plane with Rico and Private. After crashing to the sands below they begin to wonder where Dave will strike next. Meanwhile, Dave kidnaps more penguins. While Corporal begins to stress eat again, Eva picks up that the penguins never reached Madagascar, much to the former's panic.\n\nThe penguins arrive in Shanghai (which they initially mistake for Dublin) and thanks to Rico coughing up Dave's snow globe collection, realize that Dave is going to strike there. In the aquarium, Skipper has Private create the diversion, dressed as a mermaid. Dave arrives, but is captured by the Penguins even as the North Wind arrive. Dave escapes into the pipes, and captures the mermaid penguins as well as Private. He escapes to his submarine, and the Penguins hijack the North Wind's jet, while the North Wind tries to catch them. Ultimately the jet crashes, with Dave getting away. The Penguins are tied adrift from the North Wind's life-boat. It turns out the North Wind has been tracking Private from his dart and found Dave's island base.\n\nOn the island hundreds of penguins are being held captive, and watch Dave's demonstration of the Medusa serum to turn them into hideous monsters. Private accidentally blows his cover, prompting Dave to use him as his first test penguin subject. Outside, the penguins and North Wind debate whose plan to use. After Classified reminds Skipper that it's his fault Private was captured, he agrees to the wolf's plan, while the Penguins cause a diversion. However, Dave was prepared for their arrival and captures them all.\n\nDave uses Private as his first Test subject. The rest of the team attempts to save him, but they cannot find the paper clip, and Private is presumably killed, devastating them. Unbeknownst to all others, Private has escaped with minor scalding moments before he can be struck, able to regurgitate the paper clip and free himself in time. He then rescues the North Wind from Dave's complicated death device. Private wants to go save the other penguins, but Classified opts to return with additional equipment. Private ends up alone and heads off to his friends.\n\nDave mutates all the Penguins and the submarine surfaces in Manhattan were the Sub turns into a gigantic robot octopus machine, where Dave unleashes the penguins on Manhattan. The exterminators arrive en masse, using utility vehicles to remove them from the scene while Private manages to find a mutated Skipper and restores his sanity. They also retrieve Kowalski and Rico and plan on reversing the serum's effects.\n\nKowalski proposes that they need to replace the ray with something extremely cute, which they are in lack of. Private volunteers, and with no alternative, the rest of the team complies. Meanwhile, Dave realized that his revenge hasn't made him feel any better, so he decides to start mutating everything that's cute. After seeing the penguins with his ray he has his octopi capture them, while Penguins steal Dave's snow globes to amplify the laser. They attempt to trigger the laser remotely, but the RC terminal is not powered, and the battle resumes.\n\nRico is sent to go find batteries while they take on the Octopi. He does so, but is distracted by Cheezy Dibbles. The North Wind show up in an explosive Ice Cream van and it destroys the submarine, though they were unintentionally captured by the exterminators' vehicles. Dave fires himself at the cannon and throws Kowalski into one of the vehicles. Dave attacks Skipper and Rico, throwing them into the vehicles too, though not before Skipper loads the batteries and fires a dibble at the button. Private attacks Dave with his mutated hand, stalling him long enough before the laser fires, reverting all the other penguins back to normal.\n\nPrivate is overwhelmed by a blast and mutates rapidly before a chrysalis forms around him. Corporal breaks him out of the weapon, and it hatches, revealing Private alive and well, though he has gained a magenta purple hue, as well as spots and antlers. The group shares a hug. Impressed by his actions, Skipper tells Private that he learned a lesson that he is a meaningful and valued member of the team, and everybody cheers for him. Dave appears again, but the laser blast has shrunken him significantly and he is trapped inside a N.Y. themed snow globe. The penguins give the item to a little girl, and Dave is left at the mercy of the child's violent shaking, never to be seen again.\n\nShocked by the incredible feat, Classified apologizes for his attitude towards the penguins and wants to compensate them. After a romantic moment between Kowalski and Eva, Private suggest jetpacks which everyone agrees on. The penguins are then seen flying back to the circus on them.\n\nIn the epilogue, Private asks Skipper if he will turn him normal, who agrees, first thing Monday. On Thursday afternoon, they return to the circus, using Mort as their new power source. King Julien kept trying to press the button, but Kowalski kept slapping him. Eventually, he distracted the penguins, and pressed the button. Private returned to normal, and Mort appears to be normal. King Julien expressed his disappointment, expecting more ‚Äúpizazzz‚Äù, when Mort devours King Julien in one gulp.\n\nCast[]\n\nTom McGrath as Skipper\n\nChris Miller as Kowalski\n\nChristopher Knights as Private\n\nConrad Vernon as Rico\n\nJohn Malkovich as Dave\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch as Agent Classified\n\nKen Jeong as Short Fuse\n\nAnnet Mahendru as Eva\n\nPeter Stormare as Corporal\n\nAndy Richter as Mort\n\nDanny Jacobs as King Julien\n\nAdditionally, Werner Herzog has a cameo of himself as a Documentary Filmmaker.\n\nProduction[]\n\nProduction for a spin-off films starring the NYC Adelie penguin spies originally began in 2005, shortly after the release of the first Madagascar film. it was to be called The Penguins Of Madagascar, and be released in 2009 as a TV special, until it was officially announced in 2011 as a theatrical feature film to be entitled Penguins of Madagascar.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A-.\n\nMichael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, saying \"While there are plenty of madcap antics to fill a feature, all that manic energy ultimately proves to be more exhausting than exhilarating.\" Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film three out of five stars, saying \"Granted, it's no classic, but a sassy script and good-natured voice work from Benedict Cumberbatch and John Malkovich should keep kids and grownups entertained over the holidays.\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club gave the film a B, saying \"Frenetic and frequently funny, Penguins Of Madagascar represents the DreamWorks Animation franchise style‚Äîwhich boils down to self-aware, but na√Øve, talking animals who learn kid-friendly life lessons‚Äîat its most palatable.\" Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying \"The lack of originality is offset by sheer silliness, including Classified and Skipper's Abbott and Costello-style argument over whether there's a long I in 'diversion.' The word fits the movie.\"\n\nBill Zwecker of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Once again the Madagascar team have come up with a winner ‚Äì a nice way to kick off the Thanksgiving and holiday filmgoing experience for the whole family.\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film one out of four stars, saying \"Penguins of Madagascar is a lazy, noisy ADHD-addled collection of animated clich√©s guaranteed to give anyone older than 5 a headache, even if you don't see it in optional 3-D.\" Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C-, saying \"Penguins of Madagascar aims primarily for the kiddies, racing from one frenetic action sequence to another like some haywire Walter Lantz cartoon.\"\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThis could be a spin-off to the Nickelodeon series.\n\nAlex, Marty, Melman and Gloria appear in the beginning (their silhouettes visible only).\n\nAngie Wu (the voice actress of the snow-globe girl) is also known for her roll as Hoho from Ni Hao Kai lan."
