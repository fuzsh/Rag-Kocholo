The series will feature 16 new prehistoric creatures, an adopted baby dino and, for the first time, two sisters. After a chance encounter with Trek and his Dino Field Guide, Dana, a \"paleontologist in training,\" and her teenage sister Emily, begin to see dinosaurs all around them, leading to plenty of action and adventure.

With Dorothy's dog Toto, this unlikely crew embarks on an epic journey, seeking out the magic Dorothy needs to get back to Kansas. The challenge for Dorothy, and everyone else in this world, is that Oz is facing the greatest magic crisis in eons. Developed and produced by Bureau of Magic's Mark Warshaw, Darin Mark, Jared Mark, and Abram Makowka (East Los High, Smallville), this contemporary re-imagining of L. Frank Baum's extraordinary universe is designed by Flaunt Productions (Under Siege, Project Spark), music by Adam Berry (The Penguins of Madagascar) with theme music by Mark Mothersbaugh (The Lego Movie).\n\nIn Shaun the Sheep: The Farmer's Llamas, the Farmer and Bitzer go to a Country Fair and Shaun accompanies them intent on causing mischief. Shaun spies an auction of three exotic and very crafty Llamas and cleverly gets the unwitting Farmer to buy them. At first everything's great fun, but soon their new Llama roommates get a bit too comfortable in their new home. When things spiral out of control, Shaun is forced to take action to oust the intruders and save the farm. The Aardman Animations special is written by Lee Pressman (Peter Rabbit), Richard Starzak (Shaun the Sheep movie) and Nick Vincent Murphy (Moone Boy), directed by Jay Grace (Shaun the Sheep, Creature Comforts) and produced by Paul Kewley & John Woolley (Shaun the Sheep).\n\nAmazon Original Series are available for Prime members to stream and enjoy through the Amazon Video app for TVs, connected devices and mobile devices, or online at Amazon.com/originals, at no additional cost to their membership.
