        "text": "The Adventures of Knickerbock Teetertop: For preschool-aged kids, the show — created by brother-sister team Adam Wilson and Melanie Wilson LaBracio (Marvel Universe Live, Evergone) — is about the smallest kid on the enchanted Wonderpine Mountain who wants to be a big adventurer just like his grandpa. Show’s character design is by Rhode Montijo (Melvin Beederman: Super Hero, The Halloween Kid) and animated by Karrot Animation (Sarah & Duck).\n\nLost in Oz: For children 6-11, animated show is set in a modern, metropolitan Emerald City in which 12-year-old Dorothy Gale befriends West, a young, street-smart witch grappling with dark temptations, and Ojo, a giant munchkin. Developed and produced by Bureau of Magic’s Darin Mark, Jared Mark, Abram Makowka, and Mark Warshaw (East Los High, Smallville); designed by Flaunt Productions (Under Siege, Project Spark); animated by Arc Productions (formerly Starz Animation which produced 9 and Gnomeo & Juliet); and scored by Adam Berry (The Penguins of Madagascar), with theme music by Devo’s Mark Mothersbaugh.\n\nLily the Unicorn: Aimed at kids 6-11, animated show revolves around Lily, a colorful and comical unicorn who leads her friends on fantastic adventures. Anything is possible in Lily’s world: a simple song she hums can go viral and top the musics charts, or a quiet surprise picnic for her pal Roger can lead to a search for falafel waffles. Based on the children’s book by Dallas Clayton and produced by the Jim Henson Company."
