Respectively, they are: The Adventures Of Knickerbock Teetertop, Lost In Oz, Lily The Unicorn, Bear In Underwear, A History Of Radness and The Kicks. Streaming is slated to begin this summer on Amazon Instant Video. The shows boast5 a range of creative talent that includes David Babcock (Brothers & Sisters); Andrew Green (Hannah Montana); Adam Wilson and Melanie Wilson LaBracio (Marvel Universe Live); The Jim Henson Company; and Bureau of Magic (Smallville).\n\nFrom Adam Wilson and Melanie Wilson LaBracio, The Adventures Of Knickerbock Teetertop is designed for preschool-age children and animated by Karrot Animation (Sarah & Duck). Knickerbock Teetertop is the smallest kid on the enchanted Wonderpine Mountain, but wants to be a big adventurer just like his grandpa. Joined by friends on his magical Wonderboggan, Knickerbock, Holly, and Otto have wondrous, challenging adventures discovering new places and creatures. Knickerbock bounces along rugged terrain, pushes against the elements, and challenges himself to overcome obstacles. As he encounters problems Knickerbock uses perseverance, grit, and some encouragement from Grandpa to “adventure on, adventure through.”\n\nFor kids 6-11, Lost In Oz is an animated action-adventure comedy set in a modern, metropolitan Emerald City. Stranded in this spectacular world, 12-year-old Dorothy Gale befriends West, a young, street-smart witch grappling with dark temptations, and Ojo, a giant munchkin. With Dorothy’s dog Toto, the unlikely crew embarks on an epic journey, seeking out the magic Dorothy needs to get back to Kansas. But Oz is facing the greatest magic crisis in eons. Developed and produced by Bureau of Magic’s Darin Mark, Jared Mark, Abram Makowka, and Mark Warshaw, the reimagining is designed by Flaunt Productions (Under Siege), animated by Arc Productions (Gnomeo & Juliet), scored by Adam Berry (The Penguins Of Madagascar) and has theme music by Mark Mothersbaugh (The Lego Movie).\n\nLily The Unicorn, for the 6-11 crowd, has a “remarkable, colorful and comical gal” at its center. Her unique perspective and independent spirit can brighten up any situation and often lead her and her loyal friends into unexpected shenanigans. In Lily’s world, anything is possible: A simple song she hums can go viral and top the charts, It’s based on the hit children’s book by Dallas Clayton and produced by The Jim Henson Company.\n\nBear In Underwear, also for 6-11s, is set in Shady Glade Woods where Eddie Behr, an eternally optimistic, high energy ursine, and his quirky group of animal friends and family reside. Eddie aspires to be a forest legend just like his dad, who discovered “pants” at an abandoned campsite (what he really discovered were tighty whities… but no one knows the difference). But Eddie soon realizes that success may not be all that it’s cracked up to be. Hijinks ensue in a world full of forest animals who look at everything from a slightly skewed point of view. Based on the bestselling books by Todd Goldman and written by Goldman and Dave Schiff (That 70s Show).\n\nA History Of Radness (6-11) is written and executive produced by Andrew Green and follows siblings Jack and Tessie from their less-than-cool middle school beginnings to the start of their music careers as they put together a band of like-minded musicians, considered outsiders by fellow classmates. The project is also executive produced by Skot Bright (Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers: Running Down A Dream) and will feature original music written by Hutch Harris of The Thermals with original score by James Iha (The Smashing Pumpkins). Musician Henry Rollins (Sons Of Anarchy) guest stars as Coach Carlucci and Imagine Dragons’ Dan Reynolds and Best Coast’s Bethany Cosentino lend narration.\n\nThe Kicks (6-11) follows Devin Burke, the star player on her soccer team back home until her family moved to California midway through the school year. Now, she has to rise to the challenge after discovering that her new school team has been on a losing streak over the last few months and is badly in need of a leader to rally them. Based on a book series by Olympic Gold Medalist and current U.S. Women’s National Team soccer player Alex Morgan and adapted by David Babcock, the project is executive produced by Todd Cohen (Kath & Kim) and novelist James Frey and his company Full Fathom Five and directed by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum (Ramona & Beezus).\n\nRelated stories\n\nAmazon Developing Drama Based On 'Boy In The Suitcase' Mystery Books\n\nAmazon Books 'Natchez Burning' Drama From Tobey Maguire, David Hudgins & Sony TV\n\nAmazon Renews 'Bosch' For Second Season"
