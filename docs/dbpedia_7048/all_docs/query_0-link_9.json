        "text": "This animation represents the culmination of two years of CG development to find the optimum balance of entertaining storytelling, high-quality aesthetics, and technical innovation. This combination allows Nickelodeon to produce an 11-minute episode each week at a near-feature-level quality on a television timeline and budget.\n\nOver the last two years, we have developed asset-building scripts, lighting tools, and a workflow pipeline that allows us to automate much of the CG animation process. This has enabled us to streamline and quickly produce high-quality solutions for many of the technical challenges that usually plague CG production, such as fur and large poly-counts in modeling. With these technical innovations, we create efficient and consistent assets that we pass onto our vendor studios, allowing them to concentrate most of their resources on high-quality animation and avoid dedicating large resources to solving technical problems. As we continue to expand and refine our Maya tools and interfaces, we believe this will continue to allow our artists to further push what can be created in CG for the small screen."
