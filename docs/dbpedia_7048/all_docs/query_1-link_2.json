        "text": "\"I Like To Move It\" is a 1994 song originally performed by Reel 2 Real (Erick Morillo), featuring The Mad Stuntman.\n\nThe Madagascar Franchise prominently features the song in many ways, a cover is performed by Sacha Baron Cohen for the soundtrack of the first Madagascar film. Will.i.am performs a cover for the soundtrack of the second film with lyrics different to that the original version, In the third film, the song is mashed with \"Afro Circus\" during the finale and credits, Afro Circus/I Like To Move It features Danny Jacobs singing the \"I Like to Move It\" part on the soundtrack, while Sacha Baron Cohen sings it in the film and on the film's score. Afro Circus/I Like to Move It also can be heard in The Penguins of Madagascar Film at the beginning of the film, to express how annoyed the penguins are at being in the circus while they make an escape plan to honor Private's birthday. The original Reel 2 Real version can be heard in the first and final episode of All Hail King Julien.\n\nLyrics (Sacha Baron Cohen - Soundtrack Version)[]\n\nI like to move it, move it\n\nI like to move it, move it\n\nI like to move it, move it\n\nYa like to...
