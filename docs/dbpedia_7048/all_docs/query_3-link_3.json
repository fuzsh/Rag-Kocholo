        "text": "List of fictional characters\n\nThis is a list of characters from the DreamWorks Animation franchise of Madagascar films and TV shows.\n\nTom McGrath explained in an interview that the intention of Madagascar was not to take a political stance on whether \"zoos are bad and the wild is better, or that the wild is bad,\" but to show \"the most extreme 'fish out of water' story that (they) could do\".[1] McGrath stated \"the basic irony to the story is that, you think animals do belong in the wild, but if they're so accustomed to civility, they wouldn't know where food even came from,\" and the animals were meant to \"love the zoo and to love where they are because they've got\" 5,000 square feet (460 m2) \"right off Fifth Avenue\".[1]\n\nMcGrath also described, during the research of Madagascar, they \"found these crazy, weird animals that were already cartoons in their own right.\"[1]\n\nFictional character\n\nAlexMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar (2005)Created byMark Burton\n\nBilly Frolick\n\nEric Darnell\n\nTom McGrathVoiced byBen Stiller (films and TV specials)\n\nWally Wingert (first video game, spin-offs, Ride Attractions)\n\nQuinn Dempsey Stiller (cub)\n\nDeclan Swift (cub)\n\nCrispin Freeman (second and third video games, All Hail King Julien, DreamWorksTV Animations, Ride Attractions, Commercials)\n\nTucker Chandler (cub; A Little Wild)In-universe informationSpeciesAfrican lion\n\nAlex (born Alakay) is a male African lion. He's happy, go-lucky and is best friends with Marty (voiced by Chris Rock). He's the star attraction at zoo but learns to adapt to the wild. He is a dancer by nature, often impressing others with his aerobatic feats. He does tend to be a little self-absorbed, often not seeing the problems of others above his own.\n\nAlex enjoys his life at the zoo and has plenty of friends and is surprised when hearing Marty's wish to leave and live in the wild (or run free in Connecticut as stated in the movie).[2] As a cub, Alex was born on an African wildlife reserve, and was named Alakay. He was the only son of the alpha lion, Zuba (voiced by Bernie Mac), and was constantly given lessons on hunting, though he displayed no interest in the activity. During one of the sessions, Alex was captured by poachers, but the crate he was contained in fell into a river and eventually floated to New York. He is found by humans who renamed him Alex and took him to the Central Park Zoo. In Madagascar, after Marty, Alex's best friend, leaves in an effort to take a train to the wild, Alex, Gloria the Hippopotamus (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (voiced by David Schwimmer) pursue him and are shot with tranquilizer darts by humans. The animal-rights activists pressure the zoo into releasing them back into the wild, but on the ship to the preserve, Alex and his friends fall into the ocean. They wash ashore on Madagascar, and, while Marty is excited to be free, Alex wishes to go home. He grows very hungry after days of being unable to eat, not realizing that steak is animal flesh. Hunger drives Alex into a crazed state, and after almost killing Marty in hunger, in a moment of lucidity, he goes into self-imposed exile, barricading himself in fossa territory. Marty pursues him, unwilling to leave his friend, but is attacked by the fossa, the native predators of Madagascar. Alex works to defend Marty and is later given sushi by the penguins to satiate his hunger.\n\nIn Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, Alex encounters his parents, Zuba and Florrie (Sherri Shepherd), who are overjoyed to see their son and he becomes co-alpha lion alongside his father.\n\nZuba assumes Alex is strong after hearing he is the \"King\" of New York and arranges a rite of passage into the pride. Makunga (Alec Baldwin), Zuba's rival, persuades Alex to challenge Teetsi during the Alex's rite of passage. Teetsi was revealed to be a bulky, strong lion and Alex is quickly defeated by him. To keep from banishing Alex, Zuba transfers his control to Makunga, and in turn, he, Florrie, and Alex are banished. Zuba soon grows unaccepting of Alex after realizing he is not a fierce warrior. The next day, the watering hole is shown to be dried up and Alex leaves with Marty to find out the cause. They leave the safety of the reserve, prompting Zuba to follow Alex and bring him back. Alex discovers that the stranded New Yorkers had created a dam, and through the use of dancing, he is recognized by the attacking New Yorkers. With the help of others, the dam is destroyed and they return to the preserve. His father learns to respect his habits, and they remain in Africa instead of flying home with the penguins. In The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper, a stuffed animal Alex is seen briefly and its head is quickly dismembered by Nana's toy poodle, Mr. Chew. Alex has small cameos with his friends celebrating Christmas and singing an alternate version of \"Jingle Bells\".\n\nThe fact that Alex loses the challenge to Teetsi and is spanked by Nana in Madagascar gives him the impression he is a horrible fighter, but this is not true, because (in the Nana case), she only gets Alex by surprise, but was more visible when in Madagascar 2, he has a short fight against Nana. Alex is shown to have a superhuman level of physical strength, seeing that he broke the zoo's public telephone, and lifts Melman, Marty and Gloria with relative ease.\n\nAlex made another appearance in \"The Return of the Revenge of Dr. Blowhole.\" Wally Wingert reprises his role from the first video game. In the show, he appeared as a hallucination \"spirit guide\" to help Skipper, whose memories had been stolen by the evil dolphin known as Dr. Blowhole. At first, Skipper thought he was very talkative and annoying, but soon he accepted his guidance, especially when he had to face Blowhole when he got back to New York City. A running gag in the episode is that Skipper's friends are confused and convinced he's crazy when they see him talk to Alex, since only Skipper can see him. After Dr. Blowhole was defeated, Alex's spirit guide form disappeared.\n\nIn Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, it opens on Alex's birthday and after a present from his friends of a mud New York he is determined to get the penguins from Monte Carlo. Alex creates four phases and after a fight with his friends they are exposed and are pursued by Captain Chantel DuBois.\n\nAfter cutting DuBois' snare, they fly back to New York until they crash in a train yard. Alex is determined to get back home and tries to fix the plane but fails. Then he persuades Gia (Jessica Chastain), a jaguar to let them on the train, with whom he falls in love in first sight. After being let on the train Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria realized that this was a ticket home.\n\nAfter a performance in Rome, he gives a pep talk and has the circus spiced up to get the circus promoter for a tour in America. Stefano told Alex why Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) the Siberian tiger was grouchy. Alex teaches Gia trapeze, and they begin to fall deeply in love. The London performance was better and they go to America. DuBois came to \"take home\" Alex but gets shot out of a cannon. Alex tells them why they had to join the circus.\n\nAlex convinces his friends and Julien that they were wrong and they decide to go back until DuBois comes. Awakening, Alex realizes they are back in the zoo with iron cage links between them. Luckily the circus came and rescued him. But DuBois is still determined to get Alex's head and is taking Stefano. But Alex saves the day (with Gia's help) by saving Stefano (Martin Short), a sea lion, and defeating DuBois.\n\nThe character also appears in a silhouette at the beginning of the film Penguins of Madagascar, and has no dialogues.\n\nFictional character\n\nMartyMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar (2005)Created byMark Burton\n\nBilly Frolick\n\nEric Darnell\n\nTom McGrathVoiced byChris Rock (films and TV specials)\n\nPhil LaMarr (video games)\n\nThomas Stanley (foal)\n\nAmir O'Neil (foal; A Little Wild)In-universe informationSpeciesPlains zebra\n\nMarty is a male plains zebra who used to live at the Central Park Zoo, and is a good friend of Alex. He once had an iPod before Alex accidentally broke it. Marty likes seaweed on a stick.\n\nMarty is a hopeless optimist; he usually sees the brighter side of many things, taking every situation in stride. He strives to be unique, which proves difficult when he meets his own kind in Africa, who look and act almost exactly the same. Marty is best friends with Alex and the two are rarely at odds. His carefree lifestyle tends to get on the nerves of his friends, but mostly serves to impress them; he is the one who helps hold the group together when things seem to get down.\n\nMarty lived a life of comfort in the zoo. After his tenth birthday had come and gone, meaning that his life was already half over, Marty decided that never having seen the wild, he must travel to the wild, for at least a short time.\n\nIn the movie, Alex says he's black with white stripes, as he has 30 black, and only 29 white, but this was partly because Alex had to give an explanation as to why he was licking Marty, as he thought he was the steak in his dream.\n\nThe film begins on Marty's 10th birthday (middle-aged for a zebra). His friends try to give him a great birthday, but somehow, Marty wants more. He escapes the Central Park Zoo, where he had lived for the past ten years, and makes a dash for the wild. His friends, Alex, Melman, and Gloria, flag him down, but as they are about to take him back to the zoo, police officers and animal control officers appear in all directions, tranquilize the animals, and send them on a ship to a wildlife preserve in Kenya. The penguins take over the ship and the four friends are washed up on the shores of Madagascar.\n\nOnce on the island, Marty had his dream fulfilled. Marty sets up a \"bar\" on the island, known as \"Casa del Wild\" (English: Home of the Wild). Alex gets mad at Marty for getting them shipped to the wild, but he later apologizes to Marty and actually begins to enjoy himself on the island. Unfortunately, his enjoyment brings on his killer instincts, causing him to attack the resident lemurs and his friends, including Marty. Alex does not \"go savage\" for long, and after regaining his senses, he runs away from his friends out of regret. Soon after that, Marty learns the hard way that the wild is not what it seems to be, and how hard it really is for many animals to live there with so many predators and other dangers. Realizing the consequences brought upon by his impulsive actions, such as sacrificing his and the other's lives at the Zoo (the one safe place they called home) and the misfortune he caused his best friend, Marty comes to truly regret his birthday wish. However, after learning of the penguins having hijacked a boat and are offering the zoo animals a trip back home, Marty immediately runs after Alex in hopes to save his friend. Alex is later able to rejoin his friends as they attempt to head back to the zoo, but the boat the penguins used was 'out of gas'.\n\nMarty, along with his friends, has only a few small cameos in The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper. He, Alex, and Gloria are seen at the beginning decorating Melman's neck with Christmas lights. At the end, he, his friends, and almost all the other zoo animals are seen singing their own version of \"Jingle Bells\".\n\nIn Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, Marty (along with Alex, Melman, Gloria, the lemurs, and the penguins) finds himself stranded in Africa after a failed attempt at flying to New York. There, he joins a herd of zebra that all look and sound exactly like him. While he enjoys this new lifestyle at first, he quickly becomes depressed when it becomes evident he has no individuality in a herd. Marty also becomes upset when Alex is unable to tell him apart from the other zebras. Ultimately, Alex is able to make amends by picking Marty out of the herd (later revealed to be due to the bite mark left on his backside from the previous film, and the fact that he is black with white stripes, while the other zebras are all white with black stripes.) Marty accompanies his friend to unblock a dam set by stranded New Yorkers in the jungle (which causes the watering hole to dry up). When Alex is caught, Marty gets the other animals to help rescue him.\n\nIn Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, Marty joins the circus along with the others. His circus act is cannon along with Stefano the Sea Lion. In the middle of the film, Marty loves his afro. At the end of the film, it is shown that Marty is dancing in his afro (along with the others) to the tune \"Afro Circus / I like to Move it\".\n\nThe character also appears in a silhouette at the beginning of the film Penguins of Madagascar, and has no dialogues.\n\nFictional character\n\nMelmanMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar (2005)Created byMark Burton\n\nBilly Frolick\n\nEric Darnell\n\nTom McGrathVoiced byDavid Schwimmer (films and TV specials)\n\nStephen Stanton (video games)\n\nZachary Gordon (calf)\n\nLuke Lowe (calf; A Little Wild)In-universe informationSpeciesReticulated giraffe\n\nMelman Mankiewicz is a male reticulated giraffe. He sometimes pretends to be hypochondriac, having doses of medicine for meals and doctor's appointments frequently. He dreams of being a doctor.\n\nHe is skittish most of the time, but often has moments of profound clarity. His experience being medicated has given him insight regarding how to treat sick or injured animals who might otherwise give up hope and dig a hole, waiting to die in it. His love for Gloria is deep, and is always a gentleman to her; to Marty and Alex, he's just another one of the \"awkward\" guys.\n\nMelman had a residence at the Central Park Zoo, where he received constant medical treatment for problems that were all psychosomatic. He would undergo MRIs, CAT scans, injections, flu shots, and be put into braces and crutches for no particular purpose at all. In the Central Park Zoo, Melman was used to his cushy life taking pills and undergoing treatments. One night, Marty the Zebra escaped and Melman immediately informed Alex of this.\n\nIn a flashback in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, there is a hint that he had a crush on Gloria as a child (as he felt jealous when she comments that Alex is cute). When the animals nearly die trying to fly back to New York in a salvaged airplane, he screams he is in love with Gloria; but she is asleep and does not hear him. In Africa, Melman is horrified to learn that once a giraffe becomes sick, it has no way to survive and therefore must simply wait in a hole to die. He takes the position of Witch Doctor to cure sick animals, introducing them to Western medicine and giving them longer and better lives.\n\nWhile he proves to be a very good witch doctor, he is informed by another giraffe that Melman has a brown spot on his shoulder, one which the previous Witch Doctor seemed to have gotten and \"was gone\" two days later. Thinking he only has two days to live, Melman initially waits in a hole, but then takes King Julien's advice and goes to declare his love to Gloria. He finds her on a date with Moto Moto and simply tells him that he had romantic feelings for Gloria is and to treat her right. When the watering hole dries up and King Julien decides to sacrifice an animal for the water gods, Melman offers himself. He is saved at the last moment, when Gloria tells him that she loves him back, and the two become a couple; it becomes apparent the \"brown spot\" was not fatal (the previous Witch Doctor is found alive and well, the brown spot in fact being a natural giraffe spot); however, there is not a scene where Melman is told of this. It is assumed that he figured it out when his \"time\" came and went and he was fine. He was last seen dancing off into the sunset with Gloria, Alex and Marty.\n\nIn Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, Melman and Gloria are still together. They and the other animals go to Monte Carlo to find the penguins. Once inside the hotel, Melman, Alex and Marty argue over who should be the leader of the group. They are crushed by Gloria's weight and they fall into the casino. Whilst escaping the hotel with the other animals, they are pursued by DuBois. On the way they lose DuBois and manage to reach the Hotel Ambassador. While boarding the plane, Melman is grabbed by the neck when DuBois appears. Alex with a little help from Mort, cuts the rope and saves Melman.\n\nAbove the skies of France, the plane's engine fails and it crash lands into a suburban rail yard. Whilst running from the authorities who are closing in on them, Melman gives Alex the idea of boarding the train containing the circus. Upon arrival in Rome, Melman and the group realize how terrible the circus was. En route to London, Melman and the others are discussing how terrible the circus was before Alex tells them about his newfound inspiration.\n\nMelman and Gloria create a dancing tightrope act that is performed in London. When Melman and his friends are pursued by DuBois, the circus discover their true identities.\n\nThe character also appears in a silhouette at the beginning of the film Penguins of Madagascar, and has no dialogues.\n\nFictional character\n\nGloriaMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar (2005)Created byMark Burton\n\nBilly Frolick\n\nEric Darnell\n\nTom McGrathVoiced byJada Pinkett Smith (films and TV specials)\n\nBettina Bush (video games)\n\nWillow Smith (calf)\n\nShaylin Becton (calf; A Little Wild)In-universe informationSpeciesCommon hippopotamus\n\nGloria is a female hippopotamus who resided in the Central Park Zoo as an attraction, all the while being good friends with Alex, Marty, Melman, and becoming the latter's girlfriend as of Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. Gloria comically serves as the height and weight of the gang, both intentionally and in situations she accidentally falls into. She is often serious with what she is talking about and the guys are careful not to get on her nerves.\n\nAs a hippopotamus, Gloria is another animal in the Central Park Zoo and was one of the many attractions, drawing crowds that enjoyed seeing her swim about in her water tank. She would also receive the star treatment as one of the zoo's main attractions and attend Marty's birthday party. At this party, Marty announced his wish upon blowing out the candles on his cake: to go to the wild. Gloria, Alex and Melman tried to have Marty come to his senses by telling him life out in the wilds was savage and difficult, whereas life in the zoos was adequate. Marty was unhappy at hearing this, and Gloria told Alex to go to console Marty. Later that night, Marty acted out his wish and headed straight for the Grand Central Terminal station to take a Metro North train and go to Connecticut, where Marty heard wide open spaces were found. Gloria urged both Alex and Melman to come with her to find Marty and bring him back before any people would notice. They were found, regardless, along with Mason and Phil, the two chimps, and a troupe of secretive penguins, all ending up tranquilized with darts.\n\nWhen they all came to, they found themselves in crates bound for Africa. When the penguins hijack the ship, the crates fall into the ocean and wash up on the island of Madagascar. After some confusion, they start to set up their own society and attract the attention of a lemur colony.\n\nIn Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, Gloria expresses a desire to join in the zoo breeding program, in the hopes of getting a mate. When the animals crash land in Africa, she attracts the attention of a hippo named Moto Moto. Though she thinks he is the ideal boyfriend at first, she realizes that he only loves her for her enormous stomach, whereas Melman loves her for who she is. Realizing that she loves Melman back, she stops him from sacrificing himself into the volcano, even saying \"It's crazy to think that I had to go halfway around the world to find out that the perfect guy for me lived right next door...\" and then joins the other animals in rescuing Alex from Nana.\n\nGloria returns in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted with Melman, the couple finds their way as they contribute to the circus' success with a spectacular tightrope act.\n\nThe character also appears in a silhouette at the beginning of the film Penguins of Madagascar, and has no dialogues.\n\nThe Penguins are a group of NYC adélie penguin spies. Skipper is a major character in the first film, but Kowalski, Rico, and Private are supporting characters and don't talk much until The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper. All four penguins have major roles in the first sequel and supporting roles in the second sequel.\n\nFictional character\n\nSkipperMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar (2005)Created byMark Burton\n\nBilly Frolick\n\nEric Darnell\n\nTom McGrathVoiced byTom McGrathIn-universe informationSpeciesAdélie penguin\n\nSkipper is the leader of the adélie penguins (despite their color-schemes not matching the real species) and is the main character in the TV show. His head is flatter than those of the other three penguins. Like the rest of the penguins, he has no idea what is expected of the penguin species, other than to \"smile and wave.\" At one point, Private used a bird biology book to tell the other penguins how to act, but since the penguins usually need the chimpanzees Phil and Mason to translate for them, it was unclear how either he or Private were able to read the biology book, which is presumably written in English. His sidekicks, Kowalski, Rico, and Private don't talk much until The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper.\n\nIn the first Madagascar movie, Skipper is the handsome mastermind with an attractive voice, and the brains behind the plot to escape the confines of the zoo and leave for Antarctica. Kowalski, Rico, and Private are his accomplices in this plot. They dig under their enclosure until they reach Marty the zebra, thinking it to be the South Pole. Skipper explains to Marty that they are attempting to escape the zoo because penguins do not belong there in captivity. He then orders his accomplices to continue tunneling. Late that night, Skipper and the other penguins are caught by a SWAT team, as are six other animals found outside the zoo. The penguins are tranquilized and put into a crate to be transferred.\n\nWhen they awake, Skipper is confused at the lettering on the crate where they are being held and orders Mason to read it; Mason's companion Phil reads it. According to the box, they are all bound for a wildlife preserve in Africa, despite the cold climate penguins need. Skipper orders Rico to pick the lock on the crate where they are held, whereupon the four penguins knock out the crew and take command of the ship, commandeering it to reach Antarctica. Skipper and his mates finally reach Antarctica and are sorely disappointed by the barren, desolate terrain. Skipper has the ship return quickly from the South Pole, where it crashes into the beaches of Madagascar and a much warmer climate. Upon arriving, he and the other three encounter Gloria and Melman, and see that Alex and Marty are gone. Skipper decides to help rescue Marty from the grim fate of being eaten by the native fossa (possibly as gratitude for Marty's silence regarding the escape). It is Skipper who helps to distract the fossa while Marty is recovered, and also helps fight off a number of them.\n\nSkipper notices later on that Alex is still hungry, not having been able to eat steak, and has Rico prepare sushi for Alex. Skipper then relinquishes control of the ship to Alex, as he no longer needs it, and proceeds to sunbathe on the tropical beaches in comfort. Skipper is asked by Private if they should tell Alex and his friends that the ship is out of gas. Skipper declines, telling his troupe to \"Just smile and wave, boys. Smile and wave.\"\n\nIn Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, Skipper and the penguins salvage a crashed airplane to fly back to New York. They fix the plane when it crashes in Africa with the help of \"more thumbs\" (Mason and Phil). At the end of the movie, he marries a bobblehead doll. In The Penguins of Madagascar, the bobblehead is nowhere to be seen.\n\nIn Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, it is revealed that Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private, along with Mason and Phil, have been in Monte Carlo. With Phil dressed as the \"King of Versailles,\" they are able to amass a fortune of jewels, diamonds and gold and plan to buy an aircraft to pick up the \"hippies\" (Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman) in Africa and return to New York. Things change when Alex and the others rush to Monte Casino, believing that the penguins have abandoned them. Skipper later uses the fortune to help the gang become part of a traveling circus.\n\nSkipper is one of the four main characters of The Penguins of Madagascar. In the show, many things are revealed about him and it expands on his character from the movies. In multiple episodes it is shown that Skipper knows karate and is an exceptionally capable fighter. He's also very strong, as seen in \"Launchtime.\" In \"Crown Fools,\" he states that he had taken down an angry walrus with \"a wing and a prayer and another wing\". However, in \"Needle Point\", it is revealed that he has a fear of needles, so in later episodes if he's injured he's treated with medical cream or the like. Generally, he is a straight man, displaying a very stereotypical general personality when not in battle: he's been shown waking his men up early in the morning for training, has given them trials on being able to work without him a number of times, and has been shown to being very hard-boiled. He is, though, soft on his men at times, properly rewarding them and even showing fear and worry when he knows they're in danger. He becomes especially upset when he believes one of them to be dead. He often tries to hide this part, as he once told Private that he (Private) is always bait because he \"is gullible and expendable,\" but later becomes upset when Private is eaten.\n\nAlthough Skipper's plans and theories often serve as jokes, his most unorthodox theories are sometimes proven true; the Blowhole existence is the most extreme example of this. Doctor Blowhole is first mentioned in \"Eclipsed\", when Skipper brings up his plan to extinguish the sun; this is because the sun was covered by a solar eclipse and, before Mason, Phil, and Kowalski mentioned it, Skipper believed he finally succeeded. Skipper being paranoid often comes up due to his theories, and whether or not he's right depends on the episode. Often, those around him refuse to follow along, mostly Marlene because she believes Skipper overreacts. He often comes up with theories without basis on new arrivals, usually flying piranha or being a spy for Doctor Blowhole. According to him, there are actually 8 continents, since he counts Atlantis (and appears to believe it is off the coast of Brazil). He once tells Maurice that if he had Skipper's security clearance, he would believe it too. Skipper indicates that he believes that some new arrivals to the zoo could be flying piranha. In the episode \"Launchtime,\" when he asks Kowalski to search for a place where nearly no lemurs can be found, he states that he cannot set foot in Denmark; when Private questions him on this, he replies by saying \"Well, that's private, Private, between me and the Danes.\" It is later revealed that the incident in question was caused by Hans the Puffin, revolving around a fish fight and top secret documents that made them both public enemy number one.\n\nSkipper has mentioned that there used to be two more penguins (Manfredi and Johnson, named for two ill-fated characters in the World War II prisoner-of-war saga Stalag 17) in addition to himself and the other three; and these claims have never been adequately explained. When they're brought up, it's usually as a warning or an aside remark, as they died in the past during a mission. In \"The Hidden\", he mentions that they died during a mission when they were attacked by \"flying piranhas\" and that they had to \"bury what was left of them with a teaspoon\". In \"A Kipper for Skipper,\" when Skipper states that \"relatively few penguins get left behind\", as the others point out that Manfredi, Johnson, and another penguin were. In \"Roger Dodger,\" he tells Rico that he would take him out if he had to and tells him \"just ask Manfredi and Johnson.\" In \"An Elephant Never Forgets,\" he tells them that while he was training Private that Manfredi and Johnson \"fell for the exploding elephant foot.\" They are also mentioned by Private, who claims that they mistook the hind end of a beluga whale for an escape tunnel. In \"Maurice at Peace,\" it is implied that they were accidentally smothered by the others due to a misinterpretation of a message which actually said to smother them with affection. In \"Smotherly Love,\" it is mentioned that they died a very relaxing death in a day spa. It is found out in \"The Penguin Who Loved Me\" that they are actually alive and living in Seaville. They see Skipper and the crew, and try to call out to them, but the four agree to never come back to Seaville and swim away, not noticing.\n\nIn The Penguins of Madagascar, he uses some Italian words such as \"Sempre all'erta\" (in \"Haunted Habitat\"), \"Bravissimo\" (in \"The Hidden\"), \"Attenzione\" (in \"Crown Fools\"), \"Eccellente\" (in \"Kingdom Come\"), \"Finito!\" (in \"Popcorn Panic\") and \"Perfetto\" (in \"An Elephant Never Forgets\"). His Italian pronunciation is not perfect. In \"The Falcon and the Snow Job,\" Skipper falls for a female Peregrine falcon named Kitka and they date for a while. Skipper breaks up with her after it is revealed that she had swallowed Fred the squirrel, and in subsequent episodes, she wasn't heard from or mentioned.\n\nSkipper shares a very strong friendship with Marlene, a female Asian Otter who lives across from the penguins and is a main character in the series. Despite their conflicting differences and clashes of personality, the two still remain very close and are able to keep their bond of friendship strong. Marlene is also considered \"privileged\" by Skipper, due to the fact that he thinks of her as smart, which is rather unusual, considering his otherwise generally scornful opinion of mammals. He sometimes allows her to tag along on missions.\n\nAs the series The Penguins of Madagascar continues, Skipper starts to realize that Private is following in his footsteps in \"Private and the Winky-Factory\". Skipper also becomes less sensitive to his enemies Dr. Blowhole and Hans the Puffin. Over the course of the series, he likes and trusts them less and less. In the Dr. Blowhole Special \"Blowhole Strikes Back\", Hans and Skipper are referred to as \"frenemies\". At the beginning of the episode, Hans surprises Skipper by meeting him in China and refers to him as such.\n\nFictional character\n\nKowalskiMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar (2005)Created byMark Burton\n\nBilly Frolick\n\nEric Darnell\n\nTom McGrathVoiced byChris Miller (films and other media)\n\nJeff Bennett (The Penguins of Madagascar)In-universe informationSpeciesAdélie penguin\n\nKowalski is second-in-command and the tallest of the penguins, forming plans for the group and usually taking notes for Skipper. When Skipper is absent, he takes charge and his rank is First lieutenant. He tends to overanalyze situations.\n\nOften formulating plans for the group, Kowalski is a loyal supporter of his leader, Skipper. Kowalski had escaped the zoo with the other penguins but was promptly captured and put into a crate for transfer with his comrades. The crates were all placed on a ship bound for Africa, where all the creatures from the zoo would be kept in a wildlife preserve. While in the crate, Kowalski confessed that he could not read and asked another transferee, a chimpanzee named Phil, to read the words on the crate. As soon as this was done, the four penguins headed to the ship's bridge, knocked out the crew and captain, bound them up, and Kowalski plotted the ship's course to Antarctica.\n\nHe is the technician of the group and always has his notepad (and, every now and then, an abacus). While being able to formulate plans and invent things (such as a rocket ship out of a trashcan and fireworks, a futuristic rotary saw blade made of energy and multiple random objects, or an intelligence manipulator from just a cardboard box and a magnet and a vacuum; in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, an invention of his called a \"nucular\" reactor [sic] is used.), he is shown to have a bit of difficulty deducing simpler machines. At the end of \"Needle Point\", it is revealed that he has a fear of zoological oral checks. He seems to also spout nearly or completely nonsensical words, such as, \"The moo cow may have a chocolate marshmallow\", or \"I'll be a bicycle cream cone\", whenever either hit incredibly hard or shocked severely. He screamed \"Galileo Galilei\" when he got his injection during \"Needle Point\". He also loves candy.\n\nIn the series he is shown to be intelligent but it is not as apparent in the films, which reveal that he does not know how to read. He does most of his calculations on an abacus, although he was briefly in possession of a calculator that was destroyed. He is in love with a dolphin called Doris and recorded a poem for her on DVD which highlighted her apparent non-interest in him in the \"Hot Ice\" episode.\n\nIt has been noted that his inventions have a habit of horribly backfiring regardless of his best intentions or their successes. Some of his most significant blunders include: a time machine (or 'Chronotron') that triggered a temporal rift that nearly destroyed reality despite remaining functional enough for Kowalski to time travel, resulting in three of him at once (noticeably, his first arrival saw him wanting to stop the ray and his second one saw him wanting it to keep working); a youth ray that turned Skipper into a chick; a mind-switching machine (which backfired in its first use because he forgot to take the warm-blooded/cold-blooded conflict into account when switching Rico with Roger); a time-stopping device called the \"Chronocurbulator\" that left time seemingly permanently frozen when it broke down; a helmet that granted the user the power of telekinesis; an invisibility ray (or 'Transparent Matter-Maker', called 'Transmatterer' for short due to copyright issues) that turned itself invisible before being set to randomly fire; a mind-reading machine that quickly burnt out due to lack of processing power; a cloning machine that relied on the Higgs Boson particle for power; nanites that could reprogram other machines (these were programmed to not harm a penguin, but this backfired when they locked the penguins in their habitat to 'protect' them); and the artificially engineered life-form 'Jiggles', who consumed the zoo's fruit and nearly destroyed the zoo when it grew to monstrous size. As a result of his inventions, he comes off as unhinged, especially when he becomes overly defensive about what he does. Outright called a mad scientist by Skipper, Kowalski often creates things in order to \"show them\" and has, on few occasions, hidden his devices. In \"I Know Why The Caged Bird Goes Insane\", he becomes increasingly derailed as the episode goes on after being temporarily confined to a wheelchair, mostly because the nursery he was being held in was right next door to the Science Expo, and he makes a few attempts to break out.\n\nKowalski can play a banjo and sing as seen in the episode \"Concrete Jungle Survival\".\n\nKowalski is a hopless romantic, as seen in the episode \"The Penguin Who Loved Me\", Kowalski falls in love with a female bottlenose dolphin named Doris, who is the sister of Dr. Blowhole. Whereas in the spinoff film Penguins of Madagascar, he falls in love with a snowy owl named Eva.\n\nFictional character\n\nRicoMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar (2005)Created byMark Burton\n\nBilly Frolick\n\nEric Darnell\n\nTom McGrathVoiced byJeffrey Katzenberg (Madagascar)\n\nFred Tatasciore (second video game)\n\nJohn DiMaggio (The Penguins of Madagasar series)\n\nConrad Vernon (Penguins of Madagascar film)In-universe informationSpeciesAdélie penguin\n\nRico is third-in-command of the penguins. He's a mute penguin, usually communicating by making unintelligible vocals. He is similar in physical features to the other penguins in the movies, but he has a tuft of feathers shaped like a mohawk and a scar of unknown origin on his left cheek in the television series, which makes him easier to distinguish, particularly from Skipper. Rico is the greediest and fattest of the penguins - he will eat almost anything, and thinks constantly of food. Skipper describes him as \"clearly a world-class psychopath\". Rico appears to be not merely particularly psychotic, but to some degree mentally deficient. In \"Friend in a Box\" Kowalski points a mind-reading device at him which, despite seeming to function perfectly for the other three penguins, picks up only the word 'Fish' being thought by Rico. According to Skipper, it was a mystery how Rico passed the psych test. On the other hand, in \"Cat's Cradle\" Skipper tells Rico to demonstrate shutting off all unnecessary brain functions to conserve oxygen, and Rico seems to 'deactivate' by deflating his entire body.\n\nIn the first and second film, what little speech Rico used suggested that his native language is Japanese, and his sushi-preparation skills added to this idea. However, in the TV series, he communicated with excitable garbled grunts, but could still manage short sentences in English, and his language further improved by the second season.\n\nHe's the team's weapons expert and his main function is to regurgitate any necessary tools that Skipper may need for a mission. His stomach operates as a hammer space, containing items as large or larger than himself, or that weigh much more than common sense would allow, with no ill effect on himself. He can swallow and regurgitate almost anything from paperclips and explosives, all the way to a running chainsaw and ground-to-air missile. As the show went on, characters could actually reach inside him and pull things out. His stomach even contains a spiral staircase and elevator, and he can swallow other characters and regurgitate them safely, as he has swallowed both Mort and Kowalski. He's very fond of explosives, and his answer to problems would always be \"Kaboom!\", if Skipper did not keep him in line.\n\nRico has little tolerance for \"mushy\" stuff, and often becomes nauseous when Private gets overly emotional and \"lovey-dovey\" about something. On the other hand he seems to be the second most emotional penguin next to Private and is deeply in love with a plastic doll called Ms. Perky. Another characteristic of Rico is that he might be incredibly superstitious, as, after receiving a rather dismal sounding fortune in a fortune cookie, Rico was a victim of pranks by King Julien who was trying to prove it was right. Even after revealing that Julien was behind the accidents, Rico still needed to have him \"take away the curse.\" He is also insanely skilled with knives and bladed objects, able to make sashimi or carve a Christmas tree from ice in a matter of seconds and destroy bowling pin dummies with a chainsaw while blindfolded.\n\nRico appears to have an outstanding opera voice when excited (as seen in episodes \"Go Fish\", \"Herring Impaired\", \"High Moltage\", \"Hair Apparent\", etc.).\n\nIn the episode \"Herring Impaired\", Rico shows that he can be responsible when his friends need help, and because the other penguins had \"Pisces Dementia\", Rico had to keep watch over his friends to make sure they don't have another fish for 24 hours. During the episode, Maurice asked that \"Since when did we get four Ricos?\" showing that Rico is actually known for his appetite for fish and insanity among the other animals.\n\nFictional character\n\nPrivateMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar (2005)Created byMark Burton\n\nBilly Frolick\n\nEric Darnell\n\nTom McGrathVoiced byChristopher Knights (films and video games)\n\nJames Patrick Stuart (The Penguins of Madagascar)In-universe informationSpeciesAdélie penguin\n\nPrivate is the youngest and shortest of the penguins. He has light blue eyes and speaks with a British accent (though the other penguins think his accent is fake).[3] Private has been known to be a rather curious penguin and is much nicer and down-to-earth than the others. In a way, he's much more childish, enjoying \"Lunacorns\" (pony dolls based on a show that teaches good morals and friendship) and often suggesting much nicer plans (such as asking for something instead of breaking into a habitat or simply telling the truth to others.) He is often called inexperienced by the others. He has an addiction to Peanut Butter Winkies, first displayed in \"Skorka\" and further elaborated on in later episodes.\n\nHe was overprotective of the egg in the episode \"Paternal Egg-Stinct\", though given how his team mates were treating it (Skipper put it through a dangerous obstacle course, Kowalski tried shock treatments to increase its intelligence, and Rico was flying it with a hang glider), this was rational. Private is very good at deciphering code, communications and peace treaties, and in some degrees, common sense.\n\nPrivate has been known to give life lessons (in \"Mort Unbound\" he tells Mort, \"There is a natural order of things\" and in \"Two Feet High and Rising\" he tells Mort that Julien's feet \"are just feet; not love\"). Private is emotionally sensitive, and is often portrayed as more observant or down to earth than the others (noticing when Skipper's ankle tag had not been taken off, indicating that he did not get a shot or suggesting that Maurice had stumbled back because of being blinded by a camera flash, which Skipper quickly labeled as preposterous though he nevertheless told Kowalski to run a scenario) but also has fighting skills on a par with or only slightly below those of Rico and Skipper (in \"The Hidden\" he is able to block rapid strikes from Skipper and disarm him with his feet while spinning on his head, all while blindfolded). On the wall of the Penguins' HQ is a stuffed fish with a sign \"Private's First Prize\"; hiding behind it (as well as a bunch of electronic precautions) is his most prized possession: a butterscotch lollipop. Like Kowalski, he loves candy, but eating too much of it causes him to hallucinate. He has an abnormal fear of badgers and cockroaches, as shown in the \"Badger Pride\" and \"Stop Bugging Me\" episodes respectively. When Private is the last available penguin to fix a situation (such as when it's revealed that the penguins had spied on the rest of the zoo occupants or during 'Untouchable'), he is able to rise to the occasion and execute a solution that benefits everyone.\n\nIn the episode \"Cute-Astrophe\", Private ended up developing a \"hyper-cute\" ability, wherein he achieves a state of over 132% adorability, that will make everyone around him pass out as they cannot cope with how absolutely cute he is. At first, Skipper abused the hyper-cute, using it on everyone around them, so Private swore to never use it again after the misuse of the hyper-cute caused chaos around the zoo and nearly got them sent away. Despite his vow, the hyper-cute made appearances in other episodes. This ability was attempted in one episode when Private was molting, but instead of knocking an observer out with adorability, it frightened and panicked anybody seeing him use the ability.\n\nIn the \"Concrete Jungle Survival\" episode, Private received the rank of Private First Class after successfully passing a test in the city. He had been just a Private beforehand.\n\nIn the Christmas special \"Merry Madagascar\" Private finds himself falling in love with Cupid, one of Santa's reindeer. The relationship is short-lived, as Cupid must return and work with Santa. Private reminded her that they would \"Always have Madagascar!\" as she flew off.\n\nPrivate is the only penguin with known relatives, he has an uncle named Nigel (though they may not be related), and in \"Operation Penguin,\" he mentions his father is named Sam Fishy, though Sam Fishy has yet to be shown onscreen. However, in Penguins of Madagascar, he appeared to have been abandoned as an egg, leading to the possibility that he is an orphan.\n\nFictional character\n\nKing Julien XIIIMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar (2005)Created byMark Burton\n\nBilly Frolick\n\nEric Darnell\n\nTom McGrathVoiced bySacha Baron Cohen (mainline films)\n\nDanny Jacobs (TV series and specials, video games, Madagascar 3 soundtrack singing voice, Penguins of Madagascar; 2008–present)\n\nKeith Ferguson (first video game)In-universe informationSpeciesRing-tailed lemur\n\nAs great king of the lemurs, Julien ruled over a great colony of lemurs in Madagascar using mostly his charisma and delegating, i.e. telling other animals what they should do since he certainly had very little ability to lead. Nevertheless, he shows more intelligence and calmness compared to the other lemurs (aside from Maurice), which is shown when the very word \"Fossa\" drives all of them, except himself and Maurice, into a state of panic.\n\nHe had parties for his subjects on Madagascar with much frequency, the likes of which were interrupted constantly by the fossa, which trespassed onto the lemur territory, devouring all that they could catch.\n\nIn Julien's early life as seen in All Hail King Julien, he was depicted as the nephew of King Julien XII, who banned all noisy things to keep the fossa from attacking. After Julien XII abdicated to evade a prophecy from being eaten by the Fossa, Julien XIII became the new King of the Lemurs and did things that were opposite his uncle's rules. He saves his subjects from the Fossa until he got bitten on the rear by a Fossa, but he survived. When he learns that his nephew is still alive and is still king, his devious uncle tries to get rid of him and reclaim the throne. When he returned, Julien XII tricks Julien XIII into going into the Fossa territory to find out what they're planning with Maurice joining him. In the end, Julien discovered his uncle's plot, glad that Clover chose him over his uncle, and gives his uncle a second chance, by putting him in the Fossa disguise, that is being cuddled by a Fossa girl, much to his uncle's dismay.\n\nThe day Alex and his friends came to Madagascar, King Julien and his subjects were enjoying one of their parties when it was invaded by the fossa. When the fossa were scared off by Alex, Julien and his people were hiding in the trees and saw this scene, thinking Alex and his friends were giants from some faraway land, with Julien coming forward and presenting himself as the king of the lemurs — once he had ascertained they were not dangerous by tempting them with Mort.\n\nWhen asked where the people were, Julien pointed to a skeleton of a man caught in a parachute hanging from a tree. Later that night, Julien had a meeting of the lemurs and other creatures of the jungle in the plane. Julien insisted that if they could make friends with Alex and his friends, the fossa would be scared away for good. Maurice was skeptical about this plan, but Julien insisted that, being king, his ideas were the best. Julien's plan failed when Alex started attacking the lemurs and his friends. Although Alex then turned back to normal and the fossa were scared away with only the actions of the four main characters and the penguins, Julien took the credits for its success. However, when it went wrong, he did not foist the idea back onto Maurice.\n\nWhen Alex and his friends were ready to go back to New York, Julien gave them his crown; he had already made himself a bigger, better one using a leaf-tailed gecko named Stevie.\n\nIn Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, Julien, along with Maurice and Mort, accompany Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman to New York on the plane built by the penguins while leaving Stevie in charge until the day he returns. He is in the first class, ordering constant refreshments, and amusing himself with old plane crash films. As the plane crashes down to Africa after running out of fuel and momentum, Julien takes utter pleasure in the feeling of weightlessness caused by the high-speed descent. By being in first class, he escapes the crash with a parachute but loses his crown.\n\nUpon arriving in Africa, Julien at first believes they are in New York and makes himself a new crown. He manages to gain some power while in Africa, although very few characters actually pay attention to him, getting to ride a flock of flamingos with Maurice, then moving on to riding ostriches and finally an elephant. Later, when the reserve's watering hole dries up, Julien suggests to the animals that they make a sacrifice to \"his good friends, the water gods\" at the volcano to replenish the water. To convince the masses, King Julien enacts his casual conversation with the Water Gods. Later, Julien persuades Melman to volunteer for the sacrifice, who believed he was going to die soon anyway. But when Melman realized he was going to live, he gave up on being a sacrifice, leaving Julien disappointed at his plan's failure. Mort arrives soon after, followed by a persistent shark that had been attempting to eat him. This shark then falls into the volcano, thus completing the sacrifice, and as Julien comes out of the volcano, he sees the water coming back to the reserve (due, in fact, to a dam constructed by Nana being destroyed by Alex and Zuba), and is convinced of his plan's success. From this King Julien concludes that the Water Gods like seafood more.\n\nJulien appears in The Penguins of Madagascar regularly, often noisily and unintentionally annoying Skipper and pretty much everyone. He is the self-proclaimed \"King of the Zoo\" no doubt due to his former king status on Madagascar. Only Maurice and Mort truly believe and respect him as their king, the rest just show up to his \"proclamation of royal decrees\" due to bribes by Maurice. Julien is proven to be a worthy ally in most episodes, since it is him who sometimes saves the day for the penguins (like in \"Dr. Blowhole's Revenge\"). Julien hates having anyone touch his feet, such as passing a royal decree that anyone who touches his feet would be banished from his kingdom (the habitat) in the episode \"Two Feet High and Rising\". When the sewer rats went to the zoo and tricked the Penguins out of their home, Julien decided to play for the Penguins in a game of Hockey to try and win their home back. They were losing until one of the rats touched his feet, after that he lost it and beat all of them on his own.\n\nIn the episode \"Crown Fools\", Julien panics when he loses his crown and obsessively longs for it until it is revealed that he had a spare crown all along (prompting Marlene, who was trying to make him new crowns all day, to furiously chase him with a crowbar). Despite his desire for everyone to listen and do what he wants, he often shows contempt for Mort, his most loyal follower, who treats him like a god. Mort responds to everything Julien tells him to do as \"I like...\" followed by whatever Julien said. In the episode \"The Walk Talk\" he mentioned that he had a dream that he was \"The last mammal on Earth\". Mort was just happy to be in the dream despite that he was \"road kill\" in it. The episode \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel\" reveals his greatest desire is living with Maurice and Mort, which he already has, thus making him immune to the mind control of the Golden Squirrel Amulet. This is elaborated on in the earlier episode \"All King, No Kingdom\", where Julien is shown to miss Maurice and Mort after banishing them from their habitat for wrecking his throne before they return to him at the end of the episode.\n\nA recurring gag in the show is that Julien believes in supernatural beings, which sometimes annoys the other animals. In the episode Misfortune Cookie, Rico gets a fortune cookie that reads \"You will soon meet a fowl end.\" The penguins deny that fortune cookies have any power, despite receiving three accurate fortunes, and dismiss it as superstition. Julien exclaims \"these stitions are super,\" and tries to get the penguins to believe in the supernatural. King Julien actively plots to make a \"foul end\" fortune come true - by his own doing. It is also known that his believing in spirits can be used against him, seeing that Mason and Phil trick Julien into believing that the \"sky spirits\" are angry with the Julien self-centrism, changing his personality to a kind lemur. But when Skipper notices that kind Julien is more annoying than the narcissist Julien, Skipper makes him come back to his original self. It is also shown that Julien gains a super-lemur level of strength if he gets mad. Visible when in \"Miracle on Ice\", Julien spanks and humiliates the Rat King, after one of his henchmen touches Julien's feet. In \"Happy King Julien Day\", Maurice claims that Julien used a cane to violently spank everyone who forgot his self-proclaimed holiday.\n\nIn Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, he has a bigger role and falls in love with Sonya the Bear. Also, he saved the day by managing to get back to the circus.\n\nBaron Cohen has stated he based the voice of King Julien from his Sri Lankan attorney.[4]\n\nFictional character\n\nMauriceMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar (2005)Created byMark Burton\n\nBilly Frolick\n\nEric Darnell\n\nTom McGrathVoiced byCedric the Entertainer (films and TV specials)\n\nJohn Cothran, Jr. (first video game)\n\nFred Tatasciore (second and third video games)\n\nKevin Michael Richardson (television)In-universe informationSpeciesAye-aye\n\nMaurice, birth name Bricky, is an overweight aye-aye, despite being an aye-aye, he lacks the distinctive middle finger.\n\nMaurice is King Julien's advisor - although Julien seldom listens to him - and often shows skepticism of his ruler's mad plans. He has a long squirrel-like bushy tail. He lived in a tribe of other lemurs and witnessed newcomers to their home: a quartet of zoo animals. Maurice was suspicious of Alex, a lion, thinking him to be potentially dangerous. Maurice expressed this concern during a meeting of the lemurs and jungle animals, but was ignored by Julien. The next day, Maurice took part in the festival honoring the newcomers. During the festival, his suspicions about Alex become confirmed as Alex starts to give into his natural predatory instincts, and shortly after explained the trouble with having a lion around. He knew that Alex would need to eat meat, and felt that Alex should leave and go to the carnivore side of the island. He later stopped Alex from eating Marty by dropping a coconut on his head, earning praise from his king.\n\nShortly after, Maurice witnessed Gloria, Melman, and Marty working with a group of penguins to fight off the fossa that were attacking the lemur tribe. Maurice had to admit that King Julien's plan had worked and that fossa would no longer be of any worry. Maurice saw the newcomers out when they decided to leave and was obligated to wave King Julien's arm for him, as the king was tired of waving it.\n\nIn the sequel Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, Maurice does not have a prominent role, basically agreeing to whatever King Julien says.\n\nMaurice, alongside King Julien and Mort, appears often in The Penguins of Madagascar. In the show, he's much kinder to the duo and often acts like a big brother to Mort, and knows him so well that in the episode \"The Penguin Stays in the Picture\", he is shocked to find that Mort only ate half of his popsicle, prompting Skipper to go find him because he suspected Mort went missing, which was correct. He often tries to dissuade Julien from his antics if they go too far, but otherwise is totally okay and goes along with Julien's plans. He is shown to have many hidden talents in several episodes such as painting, speaking chameleon in \"The Hidden\", and using a yo-yo in \"Friend-in-a-Box.\" In the pilot episode, \"Gone in a Flash\", he's legitimately terrified of being in the middle of the penguins' operations and can barely keep up with them. Later episodes would portray him as very competent and not only completely calm when he has to help the Penguins but often delighted to have a chance to participate in their missions. In \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel,\" his desire to have an army of Julien man-servants is revealed. Despite being overweight, he was still able to hold his own when he got into a physical fight with Kowalski and Rico in the same episode. He has shown attraction to Darla the Baboon.\n\nMaurice returns with a much smaller role in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted, where he and the other two lemurs join the zoosters in catching up with the penguins and chimps. After joining the circus, the lemurs fall into a crate holding Sonya the bear. Julien falls in love with Sonya, weirding-out Maurice and Mort. The two don't show up again until the end of the movie where they gun Dubois with a tranquilizer dart and rejoin the circus.\n\nHe also appears throughout All Hail King Julien, where he is shown treat both Julien and Mort as younger brothers.\n\nFictional character\n\nMortMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar (2005)Created byMark Burton\n\nBilly Frolick\n\nEric Darnell\n\nTom McGrathVoiced byAndy Richter (most media)\n\nDee Bradley Baker (first video game)\n\nMatt Nolan (second and third video games)In-universe informationSpeciesGoodman's mouse lemur\n\nMort (full name Mortdecai) is a Goodman's mouse lemur (who is also part bear, starfish, sand, pot belly pig, cactus, spool of copper wire, wood chips and possibly part spider and fish) who is a resident of King Julien's kingdom and later a traveling companion of the zoo animals. Julien finds Mort incredibly annoying, and does not hesitate in proclaiming so. Despite this, Mort does not show any lasting unhappiness, and his expression changes within the same scene.[citation needed] A running gag is that Mort commonly pukes. Mort has a fanatic obsession with King Julien's feet that began in the pilot episode of All Hail King Julian \"King Me\", where Julien saves Mort from a band of fossa trying to eat him by kicking them with his feet. Mort also has very good money skills as shown in the episode \"Gimme Gimme Gimme: The Game\" where he cleverly becomes the richest lemur in Madagascar (all the other lemurs became broke, including Julien, after having all their money and possessions taken by Mort, who gives it all back after Julien, defeated, says that he had won, showing that he believed that it was all a game). In the episode \"Oh Captain, Muy Captain (Part 2)\", it is revealed that Mort was a fearsome pirate named Dread Pirate Mort at some point. In every episode, Mort was able to develop different personalities such as Smart Mort and his Evil Grammy which resulted in his personality disorder. During the events of \"Exiled\", it is revealed that Mort is an immortal transdimensional being and all of his alternate personalities are dimensional counterparts who he defeated and absorbed their life essence. By the end of the season, he marries the mountain lemur Zora but they later break up in Season 5.\n\nMort makes his first appearance in Madagascar, where he doesn't have that big of a role. He lives among the other native lemurs under King Julien. Julien uses him as a test to see if Alex and the others eat lemurs, and Mort quickly decides that he likes them, as he is later shown to have a tendency to like everything. Later, Julien notes that if Alex does not like fish and still hungers for steak, Mort is \"Plan B\". Mort is last seen in the film with the other lemurs wishing the zoo animals farewell, and Julien uses him as a makeshift foot-rest.\n\nIn Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, Mort plays a much larger role. He attempts to follow Julien and Maurice on the penguins' plane, but Julien goes to extremes to keep him out of the plane, declaring that Mort was \"carrying scissors and hand cream\" (he did in fact, have a pair of scissors, however, strangely enough, he lacked any hand cream on the journey.) causing the security guards to brutality assault him.[citation needed] Mort succeeds in attaching himself to the outside of the plane, where he is seen by Alex (parodying a scene of The Twilight Zone's episode Nightmare at 20,000 feet), before falling into the ocean shortly before it crashed. After reaching a shore at Africa, Mort is pursued by a persistent shark, which follows him onto the African preserve. Mort (still followed by the shark) finds Julien at a volcano where Melman had just decided that he would not sacrifice himself to return the preserve's water. The shark accidentally falls into the volcano just as Alex and Zuba destroy the dam blocking the river, thus leading Julien to think that his plan for sacrifice was correct.\n\nMort makes appearances through The Penguins of Madagascar, along with Julien and Maurice. Jokes and dialogue throughout the show indicates that he has an obsession with King Julien's feet, to the point where he clings onto the feet whenever he gets the chance, much to Julien's anger. In the episode \"Operation: Plush and Cover\", stuffed \"Mort\" dolls become very popular among the zoo tourists because they're cute, and out of jealousy, Julien throws them into the skunk habitat.[5] Mort is accidentally shipped back to the factory with the dolls to be recalled, and must be rescued. In the same episode, King Julien also reveals that the only reason he allows Mort to stay with him and Maurice is so he can express his dislike for Mort in front of him, and keep himself entertained.[6] In the episode \"Mort Unbound\", Mort grows in size and muscle mass due to accidentally falling into one of Kowalski's inventions. Julien uses Mort's new size to his advantage and has Mort get food for him by beating up various other animals in the zoo. When he is denied a single banana, Mort turns on Julien and takes the feet by force. After being turned back into his regular self by the penguins, Mort, while sad at first, expresses that he is happy with who he is.[7] In the episode \"Sting Operation\", when the penguins turn into idiots, they had the same obsession for feet just like him, which Julien despises. In his anger, Julien once banished Mort from their habitat at the zoo in the episode \"Two Feet High and Rising\", forcing Mort to seek a \"cure\" from the Penguins.[6] Despite the fact that Mort is often treated poorly by King Julien, the other characters show concern for him as Maurice tries (if with limited success) to save Mort when he may be in danger, and Skipper, who refers to Mort as \"sad-eyes\", dived in the way of the mutant rat overlord to save Mort. In the episode \"Otter Woman\", all the boys are attracted to Marlene because her fur turned white. Mort tries the same thing in the end of the episode, without success.\n\nMort returned in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. In this film Mort does a few things including vomiting on Alex's birthday cake, helping Alex defeat Dubois early on in the film, being part of the Afro Circus with the other lemurs, and tranquilizing Dubois with knockout darts.\n\nThroughout All Hail King Julien (2014-2017), his obsession with King Julien's feet is even larger, having erected a shrine to worship them, and collects foot-themed souvenirs including keychains and toenails. There are also many jokes about Mort being a soul-sucking multiversal conqueror and heavily implies that Mort has a dissociative identity disorder by showing intense arguments between multiple versions of himself inside his head. These include a logical Mort, a wild-eyed, murderous Mort, a politician Mort, and a feminine Mort with a southern accent. A spotlight shines on the personality speaking, and once the dissociative episode is over, Mort appears confused and disoriented. Other lemurs, including Julien and Maurice, appear shocked and fearful when Mort publicly plunges into one of his dissociative episodes, often staring silently at him after he regains his identity.\n\nIn All Hail King Julien: Exiled, he remains loyal to Julien even after the kingdom is enslaved and Julien disappears. While enslaved in Exiled before Julien returns, Mort takes comfort in what appears to be a pastel drawing of King Julien's foot, which he keeps above his bed before it is confiscated by guards.\n\nFictional character\n\nMason and PhilMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar (2005)Created byMark Burton\n\nBilly Frolick\n\nEric Darnell\n\nTom McGrathVoiced byConrad Vernon (Mason)\n\nPhil is an unvoiced characterIn-universe informationSpeciesCommon chimpanzees\n\nMason and Phil are two sophisticated common chimpanzees at the Central Park Zoo, who prefer to drink cups of coffee and \"read\" the newspaper in the morning. Mason speaks with a stereotypical British accent; Phil, by contrast, doesn't speak at all and communicates entirely through American Sign Language, though he clearly isn't deaf. While Mason is unable to read, Phil can and is used to decipher writing while Mason translates the ASL. Both escape the zoo after Gloria breaks through its outer wall; Mason mentions Tom Wolfe giving a lecture, and they plan to attend to \"throw poo at him.\"[8] Along with the zoosters, Phil and Mason are captured and sent to a wildlife reserve.[citation needed] However, their crates are not thrown off the boat, and they are not seen until a final scene, in which they are still in crates waving farewell to the Madagascar natives.[citation needed]\n\nIn Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, the chimps call upon others of their kind living in Africa to help rebuild the wrecked plane that was supposed to fly them back to New York.[citation needed] They later go on strike, asking for maternity leaves and breaks (Skipper argues that they are all males); eventually, they blackmail Skipper into agreeing.[citation needed]\n\nIn The Penguins of Madagascar, Mason and Phil are supporting characters in the series, and are shown to be annoyed by Julien's partying. They attempt to rid him of his ways by tricking Julien into thinking a solar eclipse was a sign that the \"sky spirits\" disapproved of his behavior.[9] They also frequently mention throwing poo and are used to read the English language. Phil may be the most temperamental or \"potty mouthed\" of the two, as after being told there is no checkmate in checkers, he makes several signs which Mason responds with \"You groom your mother with those hands?!\" Phil and Mason may also sometimes lose things in the translation of what they are made to read. An instance of this is when the zoo occupants were ordered to make a cake for King Julien, and Mason mistakes \"booger\" for \"sugar\". This does not mean that Phil is unable to communicate well, even though he is unable to truly speak, he was still able to win over the heart of Lulu, a female chimp visiting from the Hoboken Zoo in New Jersey for a weekend, While Lulu did appear in a later episode where the penguins ended up accidentally finding themselves in the Hoboken Zoo, it is unknown if she keeps in touch with Phil.\n\nMcGrath explained that originally their \"first scene was just deciphering the code on the shipping label\".[1] The crew \"got this girl who knew American Sign Language\" to give them hand gestures. They wanted gestures to be \"really frenetic\", and \"she signed out, 'Tell the tiny pea-brained birds that the sign reads: Ship to...'\".[1] Afterward, the crew returned to the scene where Mason notes Tom Wolfe's lecture, and she signed \"Can we throw our poo at his stupid white suit?\"[1] Mason is named after legendary British actor James Mason, whose urbane, sophisticated vocal styling is mimicked by Vernon.\n\nIn Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted Mason and Phil have smaller roles and are mostly seen posing as the King of Versailles.\n\nThey make a cameo appearance on a newspaper in Turbo.\n\nThe animals of Circus Zaragoza are trained circus performers that Alex's group had met while on the run from Chantel DuBois. Among the animals of Circus Zaragoza are:\n\nFictional character\n\nVitalyMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012)Voiced byBryan CranstonIn-universe informationSpeciesSiberian tiger\n\nVitaly is a muscular Siberian tiger with a Russian accent, former leader and retired circus-performer in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted.\n\nThe tough Vitaly once jumped through flaming rings of fire to excite crowds (similar to how Alex shows the audience with his dance moves), constantly pushing himself to the limit by jumping through smaller and smaller rings that seemed impossible for his size while lubricating himself with olive oil. After failing to jump in the tiny flaming hoop, he lost his confidence and popularity, even the loss of his mate. When Alex and his friends plead with the circus to let them escape on their train, Vitaly is the most resistant, only to be overruled by Gia. When the zoo animals purchase the circus, Vitaly remains the most hostile to their changes to the business, even as the rest of the crew becomes inspired. He's especially antagonistic to Alex, showing jealousy for his backstory on how popular he was back in New York.\n\nIn London, Vitaly decides to give up and prepares to leave just before the circus' critical performance. Alex confronts Vitaly and reminds the tiger of his love of performing and while suggesting he uses hair conditioner as a safer lubricant before regaining his courage to jump through the tiny flaming hoop. As a result, Vitaly's stunt is performed perfectly to open the successful show. With that, he befriends Alex for helping him feel confident. Even after the zoo animals are exposed and estranged from the circus, Vitaly is the first to support Gia's proposal to rescue their new friends from the zoo and plays a key role in that operation.\n\nThe character later appears in Penguins of Madagascar as a photograph.\n\nFictional character\n\nGiaMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012)Voiced byJessica ChastainIn-universe informationNationalityItalianSpeciesJaguar\n\nGia is a Jaguar with an Italian accent who is part of the traveling circus in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. She is Alex's love interest who is always on the lookout to discover something new and gets her chance when she convinces a reluctant Alex to teach her the trapeze – \"Circus Americano\" style- and the two soon becomes romantically involved. Her only role in the circus before Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria came around was doing normal cat tricks (sitting, standing, rolling over) but when Alex teaches her the trapeze, she performs with him and they move closer. Later on, she and the other circus animals save Alex and the gang from Dubois. They soon become a item.\n\nFictional character\n\nStefanoMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012)Voiced byMartin Short (film); Danny Jacobs (video game)In-universe informationNationalityItalianSpeciesSea lion\n\nStefano is a sea lion with an Italian accent. He is part of the traveling circus in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted and is a happy go-lucky, fun-loving Italian sea lion who always looks on the brighter side of things. A true entertainer at heart, he is up for any challenge to save the circus, even convincing Alex that the show must go on.\n\nFictional character\n\nSonyaMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012)Voiced byFrank WelkerIn-universe informationSpeciesEurasian brown bear\n\nSonya is the traveling circus' most ferocious, yet playful Eurasian brown bear who appears in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. Her tricycle riding act is only topped by her ridiculous tutu. But her biggest trick of all will be casting a spell on King Julien, who develops romantic feelings for her. Unlike most of the animals in the film series, she's mute, but Julien understands her vocals.\n\nWhile they are in Rome, she and Julien travel to Vatican City where they steal the Pope's ring after Julien pretends to kiss it and uses it to buy her a Ducati motorbike (after they fall down a set of stairs and destroy her tricycle), which she uses in her performance in London.\n\nFictional character\n\nThe Andalusian Triplets\n\nEsperanza, Esmeralda and ErnestinaMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012)Voiced byPaz VegaIn-universe informationSpeciesAndalusian horses\n\nEsperanza, Esmeralda, and Ernestina (voiced by Paz Vega) are three of the new characters in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. They are white Andalusian Mares with Spanish accents who like Marty and are part of the circus. All of their names start with \"E\" and end with \"A\". When Alex's group improved the Circus Zaragoza, the Andalusian Triplets bounced on the trampolines during their act while wearing butterfly wings on their outfits.\n\nThey were listed as \"Horses\" in the credits.\n\nFictional character\n\nThe Dancing Dogs\n\nFrankie, Freddie, Jonesy and ShakeyMadagascar characterFirst appearanceMadagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012)Voiced byNick Fletcher (Frankie)\n\nVinnie Jones (Freddie)\n\nSteve Jones (Jonesy)\n\nAdam Buxton (Shakey)\n\nThe Dancing Dogs are a group of six performing dogs with British Cockney accents as members of the circus in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted. They tend to fight and argue with each other and they hate being called cute and cuddly. The Dancing Dogs consist of Frankie (voiced by Nick Fletcher), Freddie (voiced by Vinnie Jones), Jonesy (voiced by Steve Jones), Shakey (voiced by Adam Buxton), Bobby, and Sammy. Only the first three are credited.\n\nManu and Maya are two performing Indian elephants as members of Circus Zaragoza in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted.\n\nTheir names are revealed in the DVD commentary as well as the fact that they are German. According to Tom McGrath, they are very nice and great to work with. They remain silent in the film due to the fact that their possible dialogue was cut from the film.\n\nFor an all-animal circus, these elephants do an aerial silk act with flaming trunks.\n\nTed (voiced by Bill Fagerbakke) is a polar bear who lives in the Central Park Zoo. He first appeared in The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper where he was depressed due to being alone on Christmas. This caused Private to want to give him a present. When Skipper denied his request, Private snuck into the city to find Ted a gift only to be kidnapped by Nana. After getting Private back, the other penguins decided to invite Ted to their Christmas party where the polar bear had invited the rest of the Zoo as the animals present sing their rendition of \"Jingle Bells\". He made a brief background cameo in the first movie. In the series, he mainly appears as a background zoo animal. He did play a small role in the episode \"P.E.L.T.\" when Skipper had to provoke and evade a polar predator.\n\nZuba (voiced by Bernie Mac in the film and Dan White in the video game) is a lion who is Alex's father, Florrie's husband, and the alpha lion of the pride in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. He was first seen as the Alpha Lion of a pride in the reserve where Alex was born. At first, he thinks that Alex has returned to take over, but his wife notices that they both have the same birthmark and realizes that Alex is their son. Zuba is a proud father, but he is somewhat confused as to why his son is interested in dancing. After many events in the movie including Alex failing the rite of passage and shaming his family, Zuba finally accepts Alex. The film was dedicated to Mac's memory as it was one of his final roles before his death.\n\nFlorrie (voiced by Sherri Shepherd) is Alex's mother, Zuba's wife, and the alpha lioness of the pride in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. Florrie, unlike Zuba, accepts Alex for what he is. She is not disturbed at all by the fact that Alex prefers to dance instead of fight. Due to this, she acts as the voice of reason and tries to encourage Zuba that it is better that Alex came back to them, dancer or not, as a king. Florrie is never addressed by her name in the film and in the movie's end credits, she is credited as \"Mom\". It's in the novelization that her name is revealed.\n\nMoto Moto (voiced by will.i.am in the film and Greg Eagles in the video game) is a big, strong and muscular hippopotamus with a deep masculine voice, who is very attracted to 'big and chunky' female hippopotamuses. In Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, he falls in love with Gloria up until Melman shows up and tells him that he had romantic feelings for her. This causes Gloria to break up with Moto Moto, and his last appearance is when he's looking for water during a severe drought only to find a bunch of jewels. His theme song has become an internet meme[citation needed] during 2019.\n\nAn unnamed female Okapi (voiced by Taraji P. Henson) appears in Madly Madagascar, whom Marty finds himself in love with. She is not interested until he uses a love potion on himself, causing her and all the other female animals to begin pampering him. She and the other animals lose interest in him after he jumps into a lake to hide from them (due to becoming overwhelmed by the pampering), causing the potion to wash off.\n\nNorth Wind is an Arctic elite undercover interspecies task force that helps in protecting animals. They're the equivalent of the Penguins, who help them stop Dave from wiping out their species. Among the members of North Wind are:\n\nClassified (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) is a courageous yet slightly arrogant British wolf and the team leader of North Wind.[10] He is at loggerheads with Skipper. Skipper calls him Classified, who states his name isn't really \"Classified\". His name is classified (as in \"top secret\") because he is the leader of the team. He is the North Wind's counterpart of Skipper.\n\nShort Fuse (voiced by Ken Jeong) is a Bulgarian harp seal. He is the North Wind's explosive and demolitions expert. He is the North Wind's counterpart of Rico.\n\nEva (voiced by Annet Mahendru) is a Russian snowy owl and North Wind's intelligence analyst whom Kowalski falls in love with. Coincidentally, she is the North Wind's counterpart of Kowalski.\n\nCorporal (voiced by Peter Stormare) is a Norwegian polar bear and the muscle of the North Wind team. He seems to like penguins and he freaks out when other penguins are taken. He is the North Wind's counterpart of Private (loosely, as he's also able to fight well, but shows affection at a great level, like Private.)\n\nNana (voiced by Elisa Gabrielli in the films and Marion Ross in the second video game) is an elderly lady with a Yiddish accent and the archenemy of Alex. Nana's personality changes over her appearances. Initially, she appears as a very aggressive old lady with incredible martial arts skills. In The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper, she is shown to be aggressive with anyone, no matter how courteous people are with her. But in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, she appears to be kinder than before, even leading the New Yorkers when she notices that they are in panic, only being aggressive with wild animals; which she sees as no different from domestic animals. She is also shown to be a soft and grandmother figure to the New Yorkers. For example, when a man helps her find her handbag, she says, \"Such a good boy. Nana can't survive without it.\" Nana seems to be incredibly resistant to injury, as she was able to have another fight with Alex right after being tugged out of the back of a speeding tour Jeep as well as being thrown through the windshield a second time by the penguins, who reversed over her in the jeep after noticing that she did not die. Despite her martial arts skills, she is still portrayed as a \"little old lady\"; she has a waddling gait, wears dentures, and is knocked onto her back when firing a gun. In the first movie, Nana crosses paths with Alex in Grand Central Station, then brutally assaults him. Throughout the series, she refers to Alex as \"the bad kitty.\" She also hits Melman with her hand bag, causing his head to get stuck in the Grand Central Station Clock. When the animals are surrounded by police, she somehow gets past and kicks Alex in \"the batteries\" (or his groin). She was quickly taken away by police. As shown in the sequel, she was not arrested, she was interviewed as a witness, and states what she thought of Alex: \"He was a very bad kitty.\" Nana is featured in The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper, where she proves that there are times when she is shown to be not only aggressive with animals, but with also people, like when she destroys random merchandise at a kiosk while shopping for her dog, then demands to purchase Private in a very rude tone, when she refuses to pay the taxi driver her fare, when she tells her doorman to \"buzz off\" and then punches him in the face for no reason, and even when she does not hold the elevator for Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico. Nana returns in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. She also becomes the leader of an army of tourists left stranded by the penguins' schemes. She again crosses paths with Alex, then fights him, and wins again, although Alex puts up much more of a fight this time (although Alex confesses to his friends that he actually only did it to distract her to get her bag, making Nana's victory unofficial). She often hits Alex and loves her handbag. At the end of the film, Alex gives Makunga Nana's handbag. When she sees Makunga holding it, she kicks him in the groin, steps on his foot, whacks his hand with a ruler, digs her hand into his ear, arm-burns him, and spanks him before dragging him off the reserve by his ear. According to the DVD commentary, she took Makunga back to New York with her in a kitty cage. Nana's assault on Alex at Grand Central Station is mentioned by a taxi driver in The Penguins of Madagascar episode \"Zoo Tube\".\n\nMr. Chew is a small, white poodle, fond of chewing and tearing various items apart (as demonstrated on an Alex plush toy). Chew is owned by Nana, and lives in her apartment on the top floor in an apartment complex. Nana purchased Private, mistaking him for a squeaky toy, while he was attempting to find a gift for Ted, and reveals him to be a Christmas present for Mr. Chew. After that, Private gets stuffed in a Christmas stocking, whilst he gets nearly mauled by Chew. Nana was watching a football game on her TV and was too busy to realize that Chew was trying to kill Private. After that, Chew was defeated by Skipper, Kowalski and Rico, who had set out to rescue Private. Nana does not hear the fight, but after she sees the damage (following hearing Rico's dynamite stick going off), she blames Mr. Chew for destroying her apartment and puts him on a big \"time out\". Mr. Chew had a cameo appearance in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted when an identical poodle was seen as a head trophy owned by Captain Chantel DuBois.\n\nThe fossa (voiced by Tom McGrath and Eric Darnell in the film and various voices in All Hail King Julien) appear as medium-sized weasel-like creatures, closely related to mongoose, and rarely speak, instead usually growling and yelping.[citation needed] Throughout Madagascar, they are shown to terrorize the lemurs and attempt to eat them. According to Julien, \"They're always annoying us [the lemurs] by trespassing, interrupting our parties, and ripping our limbs off.\"[11] The fossa are fearful of Alex, and run away when they suspect an attack from him, as well as allow him to take their prey. The fossa are defeated by Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, and the penguins and driven into their territory. In a The Penguins of Madagascar episode, \"The Terror of Madagascar\", a baby Fossa (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker) was shipped to the Central Park Zoo as part of a zoo-to-zoo tour. Throughout the episode, the baby fossa kept biting King Julien. Because of this, he thought that the fossa was trying to eat him. Kowalski told him that this was the fossa's way of showing love towards Julien, since he thought of him as his father. But, Julien realized in horror this too late, because in order to get rid of the fossa, he shipped in an evil Spanish boa constrictor named Savio to devour him. In order to keep the fossa safe, Julien wanted Savio to eat him instead, but the fossa attacked Savio to protect Julien, much to the penguins' disappointment. The Fossa are recurring characters in All Hail King Julien. During his reign, King Julien's uncle King Julien XII had kept the lemur kingdom quiet in order to keep the Fossa from attacking them. His uncle gives Julien the crown after learning that the king of the lemurs will be eaten by the Fossa. But Julien got bitten on the butt, while saving the lemurs and his scream sent boulders falling down and the Fossa run away. Throughout the first movie and the two TV series, there have been male Fossa. In the fifth episode of All Hail King Julien there is a Fossa girl who flirts with Julien and Maurice in a Fossa suit. She is seen in the end cuddling the suit with Julien's uncle in it who is being punished and sparred by Julien, for sending his nephew to the territory and trying to reclaim the throne. Julien is, at one point, able to tame a Fossa girl named Mary Anne who later becomes a partial leader of the Fossa.\n\nMakunga (voiced by Alec Baldwin in the film and John Cygan in the video game) is a male lion with a large black mane styled in a pompadour and has green eyes. He is Zuba's rival and wants to take his place as alpha lion. When asked why he wants to become alpha lion, he replies \"I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart, and I want everyone else to do what I say\". Makunga usually acts like he thinks he is smart and has good leadership, but he only is trying to become alpha lion because he wants to be in charge. Makunga often looks at other characters while making an evil unnoticed face where he crosses his arms in front of his chest and makes a big smirk, usually when he is planning to do something that is not good. Makunga often challenged Zuba to fights over the alpha lion position, but was easily beaten. One of those fights led to Zuba being distracted while Alex was captured by poachers. Years later, Makunga used Alex in a bid to finally reach the rank of alpha lion where he tricked Alex into challenging his henchman Teetsi. When Alex was defeated, Zuba reluctantly had to give up his alpha lion status and go into exile with his family. Makunga is not a very good leader saying the only solution to the fact that the local water hole was nearly dry was that they would all have to fight for it. This causes doubt about his role as alpha lion and almost every animal on the reserve wants Zuba back. After the water was restored, he still refused to allow Zuba and Alex to return from banishment. Makunga eventually meets his downfall when being tricked into angering Nana, who attacks Makunga and drags him off the reserve by his ear. The DVD commentary reveals that \"Nana brought Makunga to New York in a kitty cage\". Due to his goals and design, fans view him as a comedic parody of Scar from The Lion King.\n\nTeetsi (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) is Makunga's henchman and the strongest lion in his group who hides his true nature in a laid back appearance. Makunga tricked Alex by suggesting that he goes up against Teetsi. Alex ended up defeated by Teetsi who then proceeded to place the Hat of Shame on him on Makunga's orders.\n\nCaptain Chantel DuBois (voiced by Frances McDormand) is a Monacan animal control officer. She is the best animal control officer in Monte Carlo with a perfect success record. She is a big-game hunter and has extraordinary tracking skills, as well as superhuman strength and a habit of mounting the heads of every animal she has caught on her wall. Like Nana, she is incredibly resistant to injury. Throughout the third film, she pursues the Four in hopes of having Alex's head as a trophy. The obstacles DuBois avoid during her and her team's chase behind the animals' SUV in Monte Carlo are sliding past some omega-3 fish being spilled on the road while carrying her scooter up high, driving from one building to the other in slow motion after jumping off her scooter (where the animals are preparing to get on the plane), and doing some stunts in an office building. She finally captured Alex and the other animals at New York City, and the zoo staff thank her incorrectly believing that she tried to return Alex. She rips up the check they give her where she says that \"It wasn't about the money. It was about the lion.\" Alex is caged and DuBois hides a poison filled dart in a foam finger and shoots it at him, but the circus animals, being alerted by King Julien, arrive and rescue him. After a long fight between the animals and DuBois and her henchmen, DuBois is tranquilized by Mort and her men are knocked out. She and her men are last seen shipped to Madagascar with her henchmen (similar to the first movie) thanks to the Penguins.\n\nDuBois' Men are four men of Captain DuBois' animal control officers. They are prone to getting hurt, unlike their boss. However, even when they do get hurt, DuBois can heal them instantly simply by singing \"Non, je ne regrette rien,\" thereby appealing to their patriotism. One is short, one is tall and skinny with a mustache (on an extra released on the DVD reveals his name is Gerard), one is overweight with a goatee and sideburns, and one is also overweight and has a mustache.\n\nDave (voiced by John Malkovich) is a purple Giant Pacific octopus who appears in Penguins of Madagascar as the main antagonist. He disguises himself as a human professor under the alias of Dr. Octavius Brine. Dave used to be one of the top attractions at the Central Park Zoo, in which time he entertained children with his clever and funny tricks. However, when Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private arrived, they unknowingly stole all his glory due to their cuteness and he was forcibly removed from his home. Afterwards, Dave was shipped to every major Zoo in the world, but the same thing happened again and again and again: penguins getting all the attention while Dave was shunned, ignored and neglected. Embittered, Dave now seeks revenge on the penguin species, becoming a mad scientist in the process. Inside his submarine lair, Dave creates the Medusa serum, a green substance that when fired in a ray will transform its target into a physically and mentally disfigured monster. He plans to use it on all the penguins that stole his fame and then unleash the now monstrous penguins on New York city, so that the humans will despise them instead of love them. However, a group of Arctic animals called the \"North Wind\" attempt to foil his plans. At the end of the film, Dave's plan for revenge is foiled and the vengeful octopus is shrunk by his own ray (the effects having been reversed by Private) and gets trapped in a snow globe, where he is admired by a little girl.\n\nDave's Henchmen are octopuses. They are evil minions who work for Dave and assist him in his plans to rid of all penguins. They don't speak, but they make a bubbling \"octopus\" sound that Dave understands. Each henchman share the first names of famous celebrities. Whenever Dave ordered them to do something, he would say the actor's first name and an action word that spells out the actors' full names (Ex. \"Nicolas, cage them.\" \"Elijah, would you please take them away?\" \"Halle, bury them.\" \"Hugh, Jack, man the battle stations.\" \"Charlize, they're on the ray\". \"Helen, hunt them down\". \" William, hurt them\". Robin, write this down\". \"Kevin, bake on, we're still gonna need that victory cake\". \"Drew, Barry, more power.\"). About nine of these underlings are named after the actors.\n\nMarlene (voiced by Nicole Sullivan in normal form and Dee Bradley Baker in wild form) is the Central Park Zoo's only resident oriental small-clawed otter with primarily brown fur, with a white chest, face, and right foot. Marlene is shown to be both playful[12] and kind towards others, which often conflicts with Skipper's serious and safety-cautious attitude.[13] Though this is true, the two still share a very strong friendship with one another and still have the ability to keep that certain bond exceedingly strong, making it rather difficult to break. She attempts to find and bring out the best in others through kindness, though is not immune to feeling anger towards Rhonda, a rude walrus apathetic to others, and works to have her transferred (she regrets the decision after learning Rhonda would be sent to a polar bear reserve, and works doggedly to send her elsewhere).[14] Despite having doubts on the penguins' ways of dealing with issues, Marlene still believes that they can accomplish very difficult tasks.[6] Marlene is known to snore very loudly while asleep, which invokes fear in an alligator named Roger residing in the sewer system beneath her enclosure.[15] Like other residents at the zoo, Marlene is shown to love both popcorn[14] and candy. In order to get candy, she is bribed by Maurice to celebrate King Julien Day and participate in several tasks to keep Julien content.[16] Marlene has also revealed that she won the Internet popularity contest at her past zoo three years in a row (though was unable to compete at the Central Park Zoo due to a scandal)[17] and that she considers Christmas in July \"the biggest holiday of the year\".[16] In \"Otter Gone Wild\", it is revealed that she was born in captivity. When she sets foot in the outside world, she becomes wild. In her primal state, she briefly becomes infatuated with King Julien, and is capable of posing a significant threat even to the equally-psychotic Rico in a fight, later successfully defeating two enraged badgers who had just given the entire penguin team significant trouble. In \"Otter Things Have Happened\", the penguins invented a machine that is able to locate anyone's ideal match at a moment's notice; the birds misread the signal her saliva sample gave and present her with Fred the Squirrel, upsetting Julien who kidnaps the little guy (who Marlene has actually started to like). When she realizes Fred is not good for her, she dumps Fred and goes back to her single lifestyle. Kowalski, upset that his invention is faulty, throws it out. In the trash the machine begins to show the results of Marlene's test again; we see Fred in the area it was picking up, but then are treated to the introduction of a brand new character, Antonio or the \"Otter Bachelor of Central Park\", a buff, Latino male otter who has a fancy to frequently playing his Spanish guitar. It is not finalized, but it seems that Antonio was the individual who Marlene's test picked up, not Fred. It is not known yet if the penguins know of Antonio's existence or if Marlene will get to meet him in future episodes but in \"The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel\" it is shown that Marlene dreams of being in a spacious room surrounded by many otters very similar (if not exactly like) Antonio all playing Spanish Guitars. In \"Dr. Blowhole's Revenge\", it is shown that she believes Dr. Blowhole is not real. In \"The Return of the Revenge of Dr. Blowhole,\" she saw that he was real, though made no comment concerning any prior disbelief. During \"The Otter Woman\", an over-chlorinated pool resulted in Marlene's fur being bleached white, causing her to be mistaken for an arctic mink called \"Arlene,\" resulting in Skipper and Julien becoming infatuated with her before Skipper became convinced that \"Arlene\" had done something horrible to the seemingly missing Marlene. Later, Marlene's fur was dyed back to its original color by Alice when she noticed what happened to Marlene. In \"Littlefoot,\" Marlene was separated from her feral self thanks to Kowalski's latest invention, but the separation resulted in her monstrous alter-ego going on the rampage while 'regular' Marlene was now excessively paranoid and afraid of everything around her. Despite Officer X capturing Marlene's feral self and taking her to animal control after feral Marlene went on a rampage that destroyed most of New York- earning the name 'Littlefoot' in the process-, the penguins managed to recombine Marlene's two selves, making Officer X lose his job again, and the experience of confronting her other self allowing Marlene to gain greater control over her feral side. In \"Badger Pride\", Marlene had to put up with the attacks from Becky and Stacy Badger (who are prone to having to put up with badger stereotypes) and her wild side comes in handy when it came to subduing them.\n\nAlice (voiced by Mary Scheer) is a zookeeper exclusive to The Penguins of Madagascar. She seems to dislike aspects of her job, and is happy to have a voice-automated robot guide give directions so she can avoid \"annoying tour group questions\".[18] She also does not understand what people enjoy about watching animals on their computer, saying that they do not do anything interesting.[17] Alice is involved in several aspects of the animal's well-being. It's hinted that deep down Alice cares for the zoo animals and only wants what's best for them as she hates it when people feed the animals popcorn, and posts several signs throughout the zoo after catching a child feeding Marlene a kernel. Though this could just be herself keeping her job safe.[14] Alice is also in charge of gathering the penguins for visits to the veterinarian, and later remarks that they have a dentist appointment (Private then confusedly states that they do not have teeth).[19] Alice and the penguins have a mutual dislike for each other,[citation needed] and she believes that they are scheming (though she is actually correct in this assumption).[14] Though another zookeeper can be heard over her walkie-talkie, voiced by John DiMaggio, Alice is usually the only one ever seen on-screen but occasionally an unnamed zoo worker appears sporadically, though his face is always hidden.[17] Unintentionally, Alice won the zoo's internet popularity contest when a camera documenting the animals was accidentally pushed toward her dancing and slapping her butt in the kitchen.[17] In \"Miss Understanding\", she remarked to a know-it-all kid that the zoo had three male penguins and one female, which turned out to be false (not that she knew or cared, either of which could be true).\n\nPervis McSlade (voiced by Gary Cole) is the zoo commissioner of the Central Park Zoo. He is the commissioner for the Central Park Zoo. He was making an appearance to announce the opening of the Children's Zoo. Skipper saved him from being hit by a pigeon named Frankie. He later appears in \"The Hoboken Surprise\" to make Frances Alberta the new zookeeper of Central Park. When he finds out Frances was building bio mechanical androids to replace the animals with, he fired her.\n\nThis unnamed doctor (voiced by Brian George) works as a veterinarian with an Asian-Indian accent at the Central Park Zoo. He works in the \"animal care\" building. Unlike Alice, he seems to be quite fond of animals. He is bald and wears a white lab coat.
