        "text": "Not to be confused with Princess Maria Amalia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1818–1857).\n\nMaria Amalia of Naples and Sicily, sometimes known as Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies (Maria Amalia Teresa; 26 April 1782 – 24 March 1866) was a Princess of Naples and Sicily[1] and later the Queen of the French from 1830–1848, consort to Louis Philippe I.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 Early years\n\n2 Tenure as Queen\n\n3 Exile and death\n\n3.1 Issue\n\n4 Ancestry\n\n5 Titles, styles, honours and arms\n\n5.1 Titles and styles\n\n6 Further reading\n\n7 References\n\n8 Bibliography\n\n9 External links\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\n\nPrincess Maria Amalia was born on 26 April 1782 at the Caserta Palace outside Naples, Italy. Her parents were the King of Naples and Sicily, Ferdinand IV, and his wife, the Austrian daughter of Empress Maria Theresa, Maria Carolina.\n\nHer mother’s sister, Marie Antoinette, was queen of France at the time of Maria Amalia’s birth.\n\nHis brothers included Prince Carlo, Duke of Calabria, who died of smallpox[2] in 1778; the future King Francis and Prince Leopold, Prince of Salerno.\n\nHer older sisters included the future Holy Roman Empress, Grand Duchess of Tuscany, Princess Maria Cristina, was the wife of the future Charles Felix of Sardinia and Queen of Sardinia; Maria Cristina's twin Princess Maria Cristina Amelia died in 1783 of smallpox. The last surviving daughter was the future Princess of Asturias.\n\nHis cousin's included the Duke of Parma, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Holy Roman Emperor, Queen of Portugal, King of Spain and a Duchess of Calabria, the first wife of his brother Francis.[3]\n\nAs a young Italian princess, she was educated in the Catholic tradition which she appears to have taken to heart. Her mother, Maria Carolina, like her famous mother before her,[2] Empress Maria Theresa, made an effort to be a part of her daughter’s life, though she was cared for daily by her governess, Donna Vicenza Rizzi.[4] As a child, Maria Amalia’s mother and her aunt, Marie Antoinette, arranged for her to be engaged to Marie Antoinette’s son, the future king of France, due to which, her mother encouraged her to remember that she would someday be his queen.[5] Tragically, her young fiance died in 1789.[6]\n\nMaria Amelia faced chaos and upheaval from a young age. The death of her aunt Marie Antoinette during the French Revolution and her mother’s subsequent dramatic actions emblazoned the event in the young girl’s memory.[7]\n\nOn the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 the Neapolitan court was not hostile to the movement. When the French monarchy was abolished and her aunt and uncle were executed, her parents joined the First Coalition against France in 1793.\n\nAlthough peace was made with France in 1796, by 1798 conflict was again fierce. It was decided that the royal family flee to the Kingdom of Sicily. The family left Naples on 21 December 1798 on board the HMS Vanguard, a British Royal navy vessel which was in turn protected by two Neapolitan warships.\n\nIt was on board the warship that her younger brother Alberto died of exhaustion on Christmas Day aged 6, 1798.[2] He was buried in Palermo soon after the family arrived there; his funeral was the first official engagement his family attended in Sicliy.[2]\n\nShe was forced to leave her home at the age of 18 and spent the next few years jumping from various royal dwellings to escape turbulent times in Italy.\n\nWhile in flight, she encountered her future husband, Louis Philippe d'Orléans, also forced from his home in France due to political complications of the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon. Louis-Philippe's father, the previous Duke of Orléans, had been guillotined during the French Revolution, though he had advocated it in the early years.[8]\n\nThe two were married in 1809, three years after they met in Italy whereupon Marie-Amelie became the Duchess of Orléans. Unfortunately for Marlie-Amelie, she went to France with her new husband in 1814, where she attempted to make a home with her growing family, but with Napoleon’s brief return, she was forced to flee yet again. Prior to her husband’s rise to power, Maria Amalia and her husband had to cope with a persistent money problem due to the fact that they had no income aside from that which they were given by the English crown.[9] This must have been particularly difficult for Maria Amalia given her ideas about the superiority of royals and the ways in which they were to conduct themselves.\n\nDuring the d’Orléans’ time in France prior to Louis-Philippe’s coronation, the family lived in the Palais-Royal which had been the home of Louis Philippe’s father, the previous Duke of Orléans. Despite the monetary worries of the family, in total, the house was returned to its original splendor at cost to the couple of eleven million francs.[10]\n\nTenure as Queen\n\nIn 1830, following what is known as the July Revolution, Louis-Philippe became king of France, with Maria Amalia as his consort and queen of the July Monarchy. Maria Amalia did not play an active role in politics and in fact made a concerted effort to remove herself from it.[11] This seems to have been the result of her personality, training, and conception of the role of monarchy. She may also have been aware of the backlash in France against women asserting power over politics where, it was thought, they had undue influence. This became painfully clear with the example of her late aunt, Marie Antoinette. Though she was not a political woman, as a queen known to be a staunch supporter of monarchy in its traditional conception, Maria Amalia was able to escape the suspicion of many of the French who worried that her husband’s ideology was not monarchical enough and tended toward middle class, bourgeois, values at the expense of the proper treatment and conduct of royalty.\n\nExile and death\n\nAfter her husband was forced from kingship in the extremely turbulent events of the Revolution of 1848, the royal family fled to England. Louis-Philippe died two years later. After the death of her husband, Maria Amalia continued to live in England where she attended daily Mass and was well known to Queen Victoria.[12] Queen Maria Amalia died on 24 March 1866.[13] After her death, the dress she had kept since 1848 when her husband had left France was put on her, according to her last wishes.[14]\n\nIssue\n\nName Picture Birth Death Notes Prince Ferdinand d'Orléans 3 September 1810 13 July 1842 Married Duchess Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, had issue.
