        "text": "Friedrich Wilhelm I (August 14, 1688 – May 31, 1740), known as the “Soldier King,” was King in Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg from 1713 until his death in 1740, as well as Prince of Neuchâtel.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm was born in Berlin to King Friedrich I in Prussia and Princess Sophia Charlotte of Hanover, the only daughter of Elector Ernst August of Hanover and his wife Sophia of the Palatinate. Her eldest brother, Prince Georg Ludwig succeeded to the British throne in 1714 as King George I of Great Britain.\n\nDuring his first years, Friedrich Wilhelm was raised by the Huguenot governess Marthe de Roucoulle. When the Great Northern War plague outbreak devastated Prussia, the inefficiency and corruption of the king’s favorite ministers and senior officials were highlighted.\n\nLeading minister Johann Kasimir Kolbe von Wartenberg and his cronies were found being corrupt following an official investigation that exposed Wartenberg’s huge-scale misappropriation and embezzlement. His close associate August David zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein was imprisoned at Spandau Citadel, fined 70,000 thalers and banished subsequently.\n\nThe incident exerted great influence on Friedrich Wilhelm, making him resent corruption, wastage and inefficiency and realize the necessity of institutional reform. It also became the first time he actively participated in politics. From then on, King Friedrich I began to let his son take more power.\n\nReign\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm’s father had successfully acquired the title of King in Prussia for the Margraves of Brandenburg.\n\nFriedrich I crowned himself on January 18, 1701 in Königsberg. Although he did so with the consent Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, he also had the formal acknowledgement from Augustus II the Strong, Elector of Saxony, who held the title of King of Poland. However, the Polish-Lithuanian Diet (Sejm) raised objections, and viewed the coronation as illegal.\n\nIn fact, according to the terms of the Treaty of Wehlau and Bromberg, the House of Hohenzollern’s sovereignty over the Duchy of Prussia was not absolute but contingent on the continuation of the male line (in the absence of which the duchy would revert to the Polish crown). Therefore, out of deference to the region’s historic ties to the Polish crown, Friedrich I made the symbolic concession of calling himself “King in Prussia” instead of “King of Prussia”.\n\nKing Friedrich I died in Berlin February 25, 1713 and is entombed in the Berliner Dom.\n\nOn ascending the throne on that date in 1713, King Friedrich Wilhelm I did much to improve Prussia economically and militarily. He replaced mandatory military service among the middle class with an annual tax, and he established schools and hospitals.\n\nThe king encouraged farming, reclaimed marshes, stored grain in good times and sold it in bad times. He dictated the manual of Regulations for State Officials, containing 35 chapters and 297 paragraphs in which every public servant in Prussia could find his duties precisely set out: a minister or councillor failing to attend a committee meeting, for example, would lose six months’ pay; if he absented himself a second time, he would be discharged from the royal service.\n\nIn short, King Friedrich Wilhelm I concerned himself with every aspect of his relatively small country, ruling an absolute monarchy with great energy and skill.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm’s I intervened briefly in the Great Northern War, allied with Peter the Great of Russia, in order to gain a small portion of Swedish Pomerania; this gave Prussia new ports on the Baltic Sea coast. More significantly, aided by his close friend Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau, the “Soldier-King” made considerable reforms to the Prussian army’s training, tactics and conscription program—introducing the canton system, and greatly increasing the Prussian infantry’s rate of fire through the introduction of the iron ramrod.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm I’s reforms left his son Crown Prince Friedrich with the most formidable army in Europe, which Friedrich used to increase Prussia’s power.\n\nFriedrich III (January 17, 1463 – May 5, 1525), also known as Friedrich the Wise, was Elector of Saxony from 1486 to 1525, who is mostly remembered for the worldly protection of his subject Martin Luther.\n\nBorn in Torgau, Friedrichbwas the son of Ernst, Elector of Saxony and his wife Elisabeth of Bavaria, daughter of Albrecht III, Duke of Bavaria and his wife Anna of Brunswick-Grubenhagen-Einbeck, who was herself a daughter of Duke Eric I of Brunswick-Grubenhagen and his wife, Elisabeth of Brunswick-Göttingen.\n\nFriedrich succeeded his father as elector in 1486; in 1502, he founded the University of Wittenberg, where Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon taught.\n\nFriedrich was among the princes who pressed the need of reform upon Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, and in 1500, he became president of the newly formed council of regency (Reichsregiment).\n\nFriedrich III was Pope Leo X’s candidate for Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 after the death of Emperor Maximilian I. The Pope had awarded him the Golden Rose of virtue on September 3, 1518 in an effort to persuade him to accept the throne. However, Friedrich III helped secure the election of Maximilian’s grandson Charles of Austria, who was also King Carlos I of Spain, Friedrich agreed to support Charles and to convince his fellow electors to do the same if Charles repaid an outstanding debt to the Saxons dating to 1497.\n\nFriedrich collected many relics in his castle church; his inventory of 1518 listed 17,443 items, including a thumb from St. Anne, a twig from Moses’ burning bush, hay of the holy manger, and milk from the Virgin Mary.\n\nMoney was paid in order to venerate these relics and thus escape years in purgatory. A diligent and pious person who rendered appropriate devotion to each of these relics could merit 1,902,202 years worth of penance (an earthly equivalent of time otherwise spent in Purgatory, removed by indulgences). Two years later, the collection exceeded 19,000 pieces.\n\nFriedrich is most known for ensuring that Martin Luther would be heard before the Diet of Worms in 1521 and secured an exemption from the Edict of Worms for Saxony. He further protected Luther from the Pope’s enforcement of the edict by faking a highway attack on Luther’s way back to Wittenberg, abducting and then hiding him at Wartburg Castle after the Diet of Worms.\n\nFriedrich died unmarried at Lochau, a hunting castle near Annaburg (30 km southeast of Wittenberg), in 1525 and was buried in the Schlosskirche at Wittenberg with a grave by Peter Vischer the Younger. He was succeeded by his brother Duke Johann the Steadfast as Elector of Saxony.\n\nIssue of conversion in 1525\n\nFriedrich III was a lifelong Roman Catholic, but he might have converted to Lutheranism on his deathbed in 1525 depending on how his receiving of a Protestant communion is viewed. He leaned heavily towards Lutheranism throughout his later years, as demonstrated by his guaranteeing the safety for his subject and Protestant reformer Martin Luther when he was tried for heresy and excommunicated by the Pope.\n\nFriedrich III took communion as outlined in Lutheranism on his deathbed. That can be seen as a conversion to Lutheranism, although he never officially or clearly indicated that he converted. By the time of his death, he was proclaimed to have “converted to the evangelical faith” and Saxony was now “evangelical”. His protection of Martin Luther and allowed Lutheranism to flourish in his realm, protecting him from the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nHis successor, Johann, Elector of Saxony, had been Lutheran even before he became Elector. Johann made the Lutheran church the official state church in Saxony in 1527.\n\nAnna of Denmark (November 22, 1532 – October 1, 1585) was a Danish princess from the House of Oldenburg. Through her marriage with Augustus of Saxony she became Electress of Saxony. She was renowned for her knowledge of plants and her skill in the preparation of herbal remedies, and contributed to the development of farming and horticulture in Saxony. She was a major influence in the introduction of orthodox Lutheranism and played a role in the decision to persecute Calvinists.\n\nChildhood\n\nAnna of Denmark was a daughter of king Christian III of Denmark and Norway and his wife Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg, who was the daughter of Magnus I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg and Catherine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and sister of Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg, the first queen of King Gustaf I of Sweden.\n\nHer mother taught her the basic principles of gathering medicinal plants and preparing herbal remedies. After the introduction of Protestantism in Denmark in 1537, she was raised as a strict orthodox Lutheran.\n\nIn March 1548 she became betrothed to Augustus of Saxony, the younger brother and possible heir of Elector Maurice of Saxony. This marriage supported the Danish ambition to have closer ties to Germany. The Elector on his part wanted to achieve better relations with the Lutheran factions. The wedding took place in Torgau in October 1548. It was the first major festivity in the reign of Elector Maurice and the first opportunity for the Albertinian line of the House of Wettin to present themselves as Electors of Saxony, a title they had obtained in 1547.\n\nElectress\n\nAnna and Augustus initially lived in Weißenfels. When Augustus became Elector in 1553 following the death of his brother Maurice, they lived mainly in Dresden. They had fifteen children, four of whom reached adulthood. Their marriage was considered to be harmonious.\n\nAnna of Denmark was a great writer of letters and kept a good archive of her correspondence. Her letters provide detailed insight into her daily life and her involvement in the political and religious affairs of her time. In Saxony, and throughout Europe, she was considered to be a person of considerable influence.\n\nShe was a very active advocate of Lutheranism and played a role in the suppression of crypto-Calvinism in Saxony between 1574 and 1577. It is unclear to what extent she was involved in the harsh persecution of Calvinists which included torture and long periodes of incarceration. She had good relations with other royal and princely houses and was frequently asked to act as an intermediary, in conflicts as well as in marriage negotiations.\n\nAgriculture and pharmacy\n\nDuring her lifetime, Anna of Denmark was known for her skill in managing gardens and farmland. In 1578, her husband entrusted her with the management of all his estates. She contributed to the development of agriculture in Saxony by introducing new crops and new species of livestock, and promoted the introduction of horticulture as practiced in the Low Countries and Denmark.\n\nThis had a positive effect on the economy of Saxony, which became one of the most prosperous parts of Germany. She was an acknowledged expert in herbal lore and personally prepared herbal remedies; she is now considered to have been the first female pharmacist in Germany. She was however not professionally active, in contrast to her contemporaries Helena Magenbuch and Maria Andreae. In castle Annaburg, which was named after her, she had her own large laboratory and library.\n\nDeath\n\nAnna of Denmark died on October 1, 1585 after a long period of ill health. She remains one of the best known Electresses of Saxony, partly because of biographies written about her in the 19th century which emphasise her traditional role as ‘mother of the nation.’\n\nJohann-Georg II (May 31, 1613 – August 22, 1680) was the Elector of Saxony from 1656 to 1680. He belonged to the Albertine line of the House of Wettin.\n\nJohann-Georg II, Elector of Saxony\n\nHe was the third but eldest surviving son of the Elector Johann-Georg I of Saxony (1585-1656) and Magdalene-Sybille of Prussia (1586-1659) his second spouse, the daughter of Albrecht-Friedrich, Duke of Prussia (1553-1618) and Marie-Eleonore of Cleves (1550–1608).\n\nJohann-Georg succeeded his father as Elector of Saxony when Johann-Georg I died on October 8, 1656. In 1657 Johann-Georg II made an arrangement with his three brothers with the object of preventing disputes over their separate territories, and in 1664 he entered into friendly relations with King Louis XIV of France and Navarre. He received money from the French king, but the existence of a strong anti-French party in Saxony induced him occasionally to respond to the overtures of the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I.\n\nJohann-Georg I, Elector of Saxony (Father)\n\nThe Elector’s primary interests were not in politics, but in music and art. He adorned Dresden, which under him became the musical centre of Germany; welcoming foreign musicians and others he gathered around him a large and splendid court, and his capital was the constant scene of musical and other festivals. He commissioned the building of the first opera house, the Opernhaus am Taschenberg.\n\nMagdalene-Sybille of Prussia (Mother)\n\nIn 1658 Johann-Georg II was accepted into the Fruitbearing Society, through the patronage of Duke Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar.\n\nHis enormous expenditure on the arts compelled Johann-Georg II in 1661 to grant greater control over monetary matters to the estates, a step which laid the foundation of the later system of finance in Saxony. Also, his government was less effective in establishing absolutist rule and a standing army than were Bohemia or Prussia.\n\nJohann-Georg II’s reign saw the slow economic reconstruction of Saxony after the Thirty Years’ War. New trades and manufactures developed, such as textiles, hard coal and glass. Locally mined silver filled the Electorate’s empty treasury, and the Leipzig Trade Fair and the Bohemian Exulanten of 1654 also stimulated economic activity.\n\nElector Johann-Georg II of Saxony died in Freiberg on 22 August 22, 1680, aged 67.\n\nFamily\n\nIn Dresden on November 13, 1638 Johann-Georg II married his first cousin Magdalene-Sibylle of Brandenburg-Bayreuth (1612-1687) daughter of Christian, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, and Marie of Prussia, she was by birth a Markgräfin, or Margravine, and a member of the Brandenburg-Bayreuth branch of the House of Hohenzollern. Her maternal grandparents were Albrecht-Friedrich, Duke of Prussia (1553-1618) and Marie-Eleonore of Cleves (1550–1608). Johann-Georg II’s mother and the mother of his spouse, Magdalene-Sibylle, were sisters.\n\nThey had three children:\n\n1. Sibylle-Marie (September 16, 1642 – February 27, 1643)\n\n2. Erdmuthe-Sophie (February 25, 1644 – June 22, 1670), married on 29 October 1662 to Christian Ernst, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth\n\n3. Johann-Georg III (June 20, 1647 – September 12, 1691), his successor as Elector.\n\nFriedrich-August II (May 18, 1797 in Dresden – August 1854 in Brennbüchel, Karrösten, Tyrol) was King of Saxony and a member of the House of Wettin.\n\nFriedrich-August II, King of Saxony.\n\nFamily\n\nHe was the son of Hereditary Prince Maximilian of Saxony (1759-1838) was a German prince and a member of the House of Wettin. He was the sixth but third and youngest surviving son of Friedrich-Christian, Elector of Saxony (1722-1763)and the composer Princess Maria-Antonia of Bavaria (1724-1780)\n\nFriedrich-August II’s paternal grandmother was Princess Maria-Antonia of Bavaria who was born at Nymphenburg Palace in Munich to Elector Charles-Albert of Bavaria, later Emperor Charles VII, (1697-1745) and Archduchess Maria-Amalia of Austria (1701-1756). Throughout her life she received an outstanding education, particularly in the arts (including painting, writing poetry, as well as music).\n\nMaximilian, Hereditary Prince of Saxony\n\nThe mother of Friedrich-August II was Princess Carolina of Bourbon-Parma (1770-1804) the eldest of nine children born to Ferdinand, Duke of Parma (1751-1802) by his wife Archduchess Maria-Amalia of Austria (1746-1804).\n\nPrincess Carolina of Bourbon-Parma Parma\n\nPrincess Carolina of Bourbon-Parma’s full baptismal name was Carolina Maria Teresa Giuseppa. She was named after her godparents, her paternal great-uncle King Carlos III of Spain and her maternal grandmother Empress Maria-Theresa.\n\nFriedrich-August’s maternal grandmother was Archduchess Maria-Amalia of Austria was a daughter of Empress Maria-Theresa and Emperor Franz I. She was thus younger sister to Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor and older sister to Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, Maria-Carolina, Queen of Naples and Marie-Antoinette, Queen of France.\n\nArchduchess Maria-Amalia of Austria\n\nOne of the siblings of Friedrich-August II was Maria-Josepha- Amalia of Saxony, Queen Consort of Spain. She died May 18, 1829 and her life will be reviewed next.\n\nMarch to the Throne\n\nFrom his birth, it was clear that one day Friedrich-August would become the ruler of Saxony. His father was the only son of the Elector Friedrich-Christian of Saxony who left surviving male issue. His uncle was King Friedrich-August I of Saxony (1750-1827) who reigned also reigned as Elector Friedrich-August III of Saxony from 1763 to 1806 and as King of Saxony from 1806 to 1827. He also served as Duke of Warsaw from 1807 to 1813.\n\nElector Friedrich-Christian of Saxony\n\nBefore 1806, Saxony was an Electorate as part of the Holy Roman Empire, a thousand-year-old entity that had become highly decentralised over the centuries. The rulers of the Electorate of Saxony of the House of Wettin had held the title of elector for several centuries. When the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in August 1806 following the defeat of Emperor FranzII by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz, the electorate was raised to the status of an independent kingdom with the support of the First French Empire, then the dominant power in Central Europe. The last elector of Saxony became King Friedrich-August I.\n\nKing Friedrich-August I-III, Elector and King of Saxony\n\nKing Friedrich-August I of Saxony married the Countess Palatine Amalie of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld, the daughter of Count Palatine Frederick Michael of Palatinate-Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld-Bischweiler and his wife, Countess Palatine Maria Francisca of Palatinate-Sulzbach and sister of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria.\n\nDuring their marriage, Amalia gave birth to four children, but only one daughter survived to adulthood: Princess Maria-Augusta of Saxony (1782-1863. Though she never married Her family had a claim to the throne of Poland (Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) and the Constitution of May 3, 1791 named her as a potential successor to the Polish throne if the male line of the Wettin family were to end.\n\nKing Friedrich-August I died in 1827 and his brother Anton succeeded him as King. Friedrich-August then became second in line to the throne, preceded only by his father Maximilian.\n\nFriedrich-August was an officer in the War of the Sixth Coalition. However, he had little interest in military affairs.\n\nMarriages\n\nIn Vienna on September 26, 1819 (by proxy) and again in Dresden on October 7, 1819 (in person), Friedrich-August married firstly the Archduchess Maria-Caroline of Austria (1801-1832), a daughter of Franz II, Holy Roman Emperor, later Emperor Franz I of Austria after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and Maria-Teresa of the Two Sicilies, and was named after an elder sister who had died in infancy. She belonged to the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. She was educated strictly, standing out in drawing, as proven by several sketches and crayons preserved in Austria.\n\nArchduchess Maria-Caroline of Austria\n\nThe marriage was childless and unhappy. Marie-Caroline was sweet and pleasant, but she suffered from epilepsy and her attacks were so frequent that she was barely able to fulfill her duties as Crown Princess; they also seriously affected her marital relationship. Friedrich-August was unfaithful on several occasions. From one of these affairs he had an illegitimate son, the musician Theodor Uhlig (1822–1853). The long-suffering Maria Carolina died from an epileptic attack on May 22, 1832 at Pillnitz Castle near Dresden.\n\nIn Dresden on April 24, 1833 Friedrich-August married secondly Princess Maria-Anna of Bavaria (1805–1877), daughter of the King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, and his second wife Caroline of Baden. There were no children from the marriage.\n\nPrincess Maria-Anna of Bavaria\n\nPrincess Sophie of Bavaria, Princess Maria-Anna‘s twin sister.\n\nPrincess Maria-Anna She the identical twin sister of Princess Sophie of Bavaria, mother of Emperor Franz-Joseph I of Austria and Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his wife had two sets of twins.\n\nFriedrich-August’s brother, Prince Johann of Saxony, was married to Princess Maria-Anna of Bavaria’s sister, Princess Amalie-Auguste of Bavaria (1801-1877).\n\nPrincess Amalie-Auguste of Bavaria\n\nCo-Regent of the Kingdom of Saxony\n\nThe July Revolution of 1830 in France marked the beginning of disturbances in Saxony that autumn. The people claimed a change in the constitution and demanded a young regent of the kingdom to share the government with the King Anton. On September 1, Hereditary Prince Maximilian renounced his rights of succession in favor of his son Friedrich-August, who was proclaimed Prince Co-Regent of Saxony. On February 2, 1832 Friedrich-August brought Free Autonomy to the cities. Also, by an edict of March of 17, that year, the farmers were freed from the corvée and hereditary submission.\n\nKing of Saxony\n\nOn June 6, 1836, King Anton died and Friedrich-August succeeded him. As an intelligent man, he was quickly popular with the people as he had been since the time of his regency. The new king solved political questions only from a pure sense of duty. Mostly he preferred to leave these things on the hands of his ministers.\n\nA standardized jurisdiction for Saxony created the Criminal Code of 1836. During the Revolutionary disturbances of 1848 (March Revolution), he appointed liberal ministers in the government, lifted censorship, and remitted a liberal electoral law. Later his attitude changed. On April 28, Friedrich-August II dissolved the Parliament. In 1849, King Friedrich-August II was forced to flee to the Königstein Fortress during the May Uprising which was crushed by Saxon and Prussian troops and Friedrich-August II was able to return after only a few days.\n\nJourney through England and Scotland\n\nIn 1844 Friedrich-August II accompanied by his personal physician Carl-Gustaf Carus, made an informal (incognito) visit to England and Scotland. Among places they visited were Lyme Regis where he purchased from the local fossil collector and dealer, Mary Anning, an ichthyosaur skeleton for his own extensive natural history collection. It was not a state visit, but the King was the guest of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Windsor Castle, visited many of the sights in London and in the university cities of Oxford and Cambridge, and toured widely in England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nQueen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\n\nAccidental Death\n\nDuring a journey in Tyrol, he had an accident in Brennbüchel in which he fell in front of a horse that stepped on his head. On August 8, 1854, he died in the Gasthof Neuner. He was buried on August 16, in the Katholische Hofkirche of Dresden. In his memory, the Dowager Queen Maria arranged to establish the Königskapelle (King’s Chapel) at the accident place, which was consecrated one year later, some of the last members of the Saxon royal family, including Maria-Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen (1926-2012) who was the head of the Royal House of Saxony are buried beside the chapel.\n\nWithout legitimate issue, after his death Friedrich-August II was succeeded by his younger brother, Johann.\n\nFriedrich III (January 17, 1463 – May 5, 1525), also known as Friedrich the Wise, was Elector of Saxony and Landgrave of Thuringia (as Friedrich VI) from 1486 to 1525, who is mostly remembered for the worldly protection of his subject Martin Luther.\n\nFriedrich was born in Torgau the son of Ernst, Elector of Saxony and his wife Elisabeth, daughter of Albrecht III, Duke of Bavaria (1401–1460) from his marriage to Anna of Brunswick-Grubenhagen-Einbeck (1420–1474), herself the daughter of the Duke Eric I of Brunswick-Grubenhagen and Elisabeth of Brunswick-Göttingen.\n\nFriedrich III-VI, Elector of Saxony and Landgrave of Thuringia.\n\nFriedrich succeeded his father as elector in 1486; and in 1502, he founded the University of Wittenberg, where Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon taught.\n\nFriedrich III was among the princes who pressed for the need of reform to Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, and in 1500 he became president of the newly formed council of regency (Reichsregiment).\n\nIn 1501, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I fell from his horse and badly injured his leg, causing him pain for the rest of his life. Eighteen years later Maximilian died in Wels, Upper Austria on January 12, 1519. The throne of the Holy Roman Empire was elective officially but in practice it was semi-heredity. The process of an election of an Emperor often meant that the prime candidate had to make concessions, by which the voters were kept on the side, which was known as Wahlkapitulationen (electoral capitulation).\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Maximilian, Friedrich III was Pope Leo X’s candidate for Holy Roman Emperor. The Pope had awarded him the Golden Rose of virtue on September 3, 1518 in an effort to persuade him to accept the throne.\n\nHowever, and despite the Pope Leo X’s support of Friedrich III’s as candidate for the imperial throne, Friedrich himself, in his role as an Elector, helped secure the election of Maximilian’s grandson, Charles (whom at this time was King of Spain as Carlos I). By agreeing to support Charles and to convince his fellow electors to do the same, Friedrich III provided that Charles repay an outstanding debt to the Saxons dating to 1497.\n\nCharles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain\n\nFriedrich III was not the only candidate for the imperial throne. The two other candidates were, besides King Carlos I of Spain, were King François I of France and King Henry VIII of England. After having paid huge bribes to the electors, they awarded Carlos I of Spain the imperial the crown on June 28, 1519. On October 26, 1520 the new Emperor Charles V was crowned in Germany and some ten years later, on February 22, 1530, he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Clement VII in Bologna, the last emperor to receive a papal coronation.\n\nSupport of Luther\n\nIn 1516, Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences, was sent to the Holy Roman Empire by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money in order to rebuild St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome.\n\nMartin Luther, Saxon priest, monk and theologian, seminal figure in Protestant Reformation\n\nIn 1516, Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar and papal commissioner for indulgences, was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money in order to rebuild St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Tetzel’s experiences as a preacher of indulgences, especially between 1503 and 1510, led to his appointment as general commissioner by Albrecht von Brandenburg, Archbishop of Mainz, who, deeply in debt to pay for a large accumulation of benefices, had to contribute a considerable sum toward the rebuilding of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Albrecht obtained permission from Pope Leo X to conduct the sale of a special plenary indulgence (i.e., remission of the temporal punishment of sin), half of the proceeds of which Albrecht was to claim to pay the fees of his benefices.\n\nPope Leo X, Bishop of Rome\n\nOn October 31, 1517, Luther wrote to his bishop, Albrecht von Brandenburg, protesting against the sale of indulgences. He enclosed in his letter a copy of his “Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences”, which came to be known as the Ninety-five Theses. Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church, but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices, and the tone of the writing is accordingly “searching, rather than doctrinaire.”\n\nArchbishop Albrecht of Mainz and Magdeburg did not reply to Luther’s letter containing the Ninety-five Theses. He had the theses checked for heresy and in December 1517 forwarded them to Rome. Albrecht was Elector of Brandenburg of the Hohenzollern Dynasty and Archbishop of Mainz from 1514 to 1545, and Archbishop of Magdeburg from 1513 to 1545. Albrecht was the younger son of Johann-Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg and of Margaret of Thuringia.\n\nPope Leo X was used to reformers and heretics, and he responded slowly, “with great care as is proper.” Over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against Luther, which served only to harden the reformer’s anti-papal theology.\n\nOn June 15, 1520, the Pope warned Luther with the papal bull (edict) Exsurge Domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings, including the Ninety-five Theses, within 60 days.\n\nThere was a ban on Luther’s Ninety-five Theses and the enforcement of the ban on the Ninety-five Theses fell to the secular authorities. Along with the Papal ban on the Ninety-five Theses, that same June Pope Leo X issued the Papal bull Exsurge Domine (“Arise, O Lord”), outlining forty-one purported errors found in Martin Luther’s Ninety-five Theses and other writings related to or written by him. Luther was summoned by the emperor.\n\nDiet of Worms\n\nTherefore on April 18, 1521, Luther appeared as ordered before the Diet of Worms. This was a general assembly of the estates of the Holy Roman Empire that took place in Worms, a town on the Rhine. It was conducted from January 28 to 25 May 1521, with Emperor Charles V presiding.\n\nFriedrich obtained a safe conduct for Luther to and from the meeting and ensured Luther would be heard before the Diet of Worms and subsequently secured an exemption from the Edict of Worms for Saxony. The Edict of Worms was a decree issued on May 25, 1521 by Emperor Charles V, declaring:\n\nFor this reason we forbid anyone from this time forward to dare, either by words or by deeds, to receive, defend, sustain, or favour the said Martin Luther. On the contrary, we want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic, as he deserves, to be brought personally before us, or to be securely guarded until those who have captured him inform us, whereupon we will order the appropriate manner of proceeding against the said Luther. Those who will help in his capture will be rewarded generously for their good work.\n\nFriedrich protected Martin Luther from the Pope’s enforcement of the edict by faking a highway attack on Luther’s way back to Wittenberg, abducting and then hiding Luther at Wartburg Castle following the Diet of Worms.\n\nPope Leo X died fairly suddenly of pneumonia at the age of 46 on December 1, 1521 and was buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. His death came just 10 months after he had excommunicated Martin Luther, the seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation, who was accused of 41 errors in his teachings.\n\nPope Adrian VI, Bishop of Rome\n\nIn the conclave after the death of the Medici Pope Leo X, Leo’s cousin, Cardinal Giulio de’ Medici, was the leading candidate. With Spanish and French cardinals in a deadlock, Adrian Florensz Boeyens was proposed as a compromise and on January 9, 1522 he was elected by an almost unanimous vote. Emperor Charles V was delighted upon hearing that his tutor had been elected to the papacy but soon realised that Adrian VI was determined to reign impartially. Adrian VI and his eventual successor Marcellus II are the only popes of the modern era to retain their baptismal names after their election.\n\nIn his reaction to the early stages of the Lutheran revolt, Adrian VI did not completely understand the gravity of the situation. At the Diet of Nuremberg, which opened in December 1522, he was represented by Francesco Chieregati, whose private instructions contain the frank admission that the disorder of the Church was perhaps the fault of the Roman Curia itself, and that it should be reformed. However, the former professor and Inquisitor General was strongly opposed to any change in doctrine and demanded that Martin Luther be punished for teaching heresy.\n\nFriedrich III died unmarried at Lochau, a hunting castle near Annaburg (30 km southeast of Wittenberg), in 1525 and was buried in the Schlosskirche at Wittenberg with a grave by Peter Vischer the Younger. He was succeeded by his brother Duke Johann the Steadfast as Elector of Saxony.\n\nThe issue of conversion in 1525\n\nFriedrich III was a lifelong Roman Catholic, but he may have converted to Lutheranism on his deathbed in 1525 depending on how his receiving of a Protestant communion is viewed. He leaned heavily towards Lutheranism throughout his later years.\n\nFriedrich III took communion as outlined in Lutheranism on his death bed. This can be seen as a conversion to Lutheranism, although he never officially or clearly indicated that he converted. By the time of his death it was proclaimed that he “converted to the evangelical faith” and that Saxony was now “evangelical”. As Friedrich continually protected Martin Luther this allowed Lutheranism to flourish in his realm, protecting him from the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nJohann the Steadfast, Elector of Saxony\n\nBut it was his successor, Johann the Steadfast, Elector of Saxony, who had been Lutheran even before he became elector, the Lutheran church the official state church in Saxony in 1527.\n\nOn this date in History: Final abdication of King Stanislaus I of Poland, January 27, 1736.\n\nStanislaus I (October 20,1677 – February 23, 1766) was King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Duke of Lorraine and a count of the Holy Roman Empire. Reigned as King of Poland.\n\nStanislaus was born, Stanislaus Leszczyński, into a powerful magnate family of Greater Poland. Because of his family’s great wealth this gave him the opportunity to travel to western Europe in his youth. In 1702 King Carl XII of Sweden invaded Poland as part of a continuing series of conflicts between the powers of northern Europe. Carl XII forced the Polish nobility to depose Poland’s king, Augustus II the Strong, and then placed Stanisław on the throne on October 4, 1704.\n\nIn 1709 Carl XII was defeated by the Russians, under Czar Peter I the Great, at the Battle of Poltava and returned to Sweden. In the absence of Swedish support, former king Augustus II returned to Poland and regained the Polish throne. Stanislaus left the country to settle in the French province of Alsace. In 1725 Stanisław’s daughter Marie Leszczyńska married King Louis XV of France.\n\nWhen Augustus II died in 1733, Stanisłaus sought to regain the Polish throne with the help of French support for his candidacy. Stanislaus’ son-in-law Louis XV supported his claims to the Polish throne which led to the War of the Polish Succession.\n\nIn September 1733, Stanislaus himself arrived at Warsaw, having traveled night and day through central Europe disguised as a coachman. On the following day, despite many protests, Stanislaus was duly elected King of Poland for the second time. However, Russia was opposed to any nominee of France and Sweden. Russia protested against his election at once, in favor of the new Elector of Saxony, Friedrich-August II, (son of Augustus II of Poland) as being the legitimate candidate of her Austrian ally.\n\nAfter Friedrich-August II of Saxony was proclaimed King August III of Poland at Warsaw, a Russian army of 20,000 under Peter Lacy, proceeded to besiege Stanislaus at Danzig where he was entrenched with his partisans (including the Primate and the French and Swedish ministers) to await the relief that had been promised by France.\n\nOn May 20, 1735 the long-expected French fleet appeared and disembarked 2,400 men on Westerplatte. A week later, this little army bravely tried to force the Russian entrenchments, but was finally compelled to surrender. This was the first time that France and Russia had met as foes in the field. On 30 June 1735, Danzig capitulated unconditionally, after sustaining a siege of 135 days which cost the Russians 8,000 men.\n\nDisguised as a peasant, Stanisłaus fled Poland and reappeared at Königsberg where he briefly met the future King Friedrich II the Great of Prussia. While at Königsberg he issued a manifesto to his partisans which resulted in the formation of a confederation on his behalf. A Polish envoy was sent to Paris to urge France to invade Saxony with at least 40,000 men. In Ukraine too, Count Nicholas Potocki kept on foot to support Stanislaus a motley host of 50,000 men, which was ultimately scattered by the Russians.\n\nOn January 27, 1736, Stanisław again abdicated the throne, but received in compensation the Duchy of Lorraine and of Bar for life, which was to revert to France on his death. In 1738, he sold his estates of Rydzyna and Leszno to Count (later Prince) Alexander Joseph Sułkowski. He settled at Lunéville, founded there in 1750 both the Académie de Stanislas and Bibliothèque municipale de Nancy, and devoted himself for the rest of his life to science and philanthropy, engaging most notably in controversy with Rousseau. He also published Głos wolny wolność ubezpieczający, one of the most important political treatises of the Polish Enlightenment.\n\nStanisłaus was still alive when his great-great-granddaughter, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, was born in 1762. She was the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II and his wife Princess Isabella de Bourbon-Parma (herself the daughter of Princess Louise Élisabeth of France who, in turn, was the granddaughter of King Stanislaus). In his last years, his close friend, the Hungarian-born Marshal of France Ladislas Ignace de Berchenylived on his estate to provide company.\n\nStanislaus Leszczyński died in 1766, aged 88 as a result of serious burns – his silk attire caught fire from a spark while the King was snoozing near the fireplace in his palace in Lunéville. He was medically treated for several days but died of wounds on 23 February. He was the longest living Polish king.\n\nOriginally buried in the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours, Nancy, following the French Revolution his remains were brought back to Polandand buried in the royal tomb of the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków."
