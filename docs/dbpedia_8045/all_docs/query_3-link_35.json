        "text": "Philippa of Saxony (Barzuna: Filipa na Saksonia; 27 May 1582- 4 April 1608), was Queen of Brunant post-humous by marriage to King Adrian I of Brunant, who was coronated after her death. She was the the daughter of Prince-Elector Albercht Moritz of Saxony (1545-1619) by his spouse Countess Palatinate Christine of Zweibrücken (1546–1619). Princess Philippa participated significantly in church affairs during her married life.\n\nLife[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nPhilippa was born to Prince-Elector Albercht Moritz and Countess-Palatinate Christine, at Freudenstien Castle, Freiburg, Saxony. Her parents were maternal cousins.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nPrince Albercht decided that an alliance with Catholic states would be essential for his own claims on Saxon throne. However, most neighbors were themselves Protestant. King Willem I was seen as a strong ally, despite his minute influence in Continental Europe.\n\nAlbercht sent his wife along with a delegation to the royal family of Brunant. The aim was to inspect the Brunanter prince. The delegation reported in positive of Adrian.\n\nPrince Albercht then conveyed his intention to King Willem I, who agreed to it for a large dowry.\n\nPhilippa left from Freiburg Castle in 12 November 1607 with an entourage of male and female Saxon nobles and arrived in Tarragon, Spanish Empire on 5 December 1607. She sailed to Brunant, which she reached on 1st January 1608, where she was greeted by Princess Amalia and Queen Maria Cristina.\n\nThe wedding between Philippa and Adrian took place on 2 January 1608 in Grijzestad Cathedral. Philippa was the first documented princess in history to wear a black wedding dress during a royal wedding ceremony: she wore a tunic with a cloak in black silk bordered with rubies.\n\nThe marriage was purely political. According to Adrian's initial thoughts of her, she was \"rather ugly, tall and broad\" and \"not nimble enough for love but hardy for child-bearing\". She too devoted her time to church service and telling stories of Saints to her children.\n\nIssue[]\n\nWith Philippa, Adrian would have four children:\n\nMaria Anna (1601-1633)\n\nChristian (1603-1616)\n\nMaria Alexandria (1606-1608)\n\nElisabetha (1608-1699)\n\nDeath[]\n\nShe died of childbirth, while giving birth to Princess Elisabetha. She was buried in the Grijzestad Cathedral.\n\nLegacy[]\n\nAncestry[]\n\nAncestors of Philippa of Saxony\n\n16.Duke Albert\n\nof Saxony\n\n(1443-1500) 8. Duke Henry\n\nof Saxony\n\n(1473-1541) 17.
