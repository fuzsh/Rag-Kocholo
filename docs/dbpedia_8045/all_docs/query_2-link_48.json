        "text": "Acquisition of Bohemia\n\nThe year 1526 saw the defeat and death of the Jagiellon king of Hungary and Bohemia, Louis II, who fell in the Battle of Mohács against the Turks. In view of the treaties of 1491 and 1515, Ferdinand I and the Vienna court envisaged Hungary and Bohemia and the adjoining countries falling to the Habsburgs. Thus, the union of Austria, Bohemia, and Hungary became the leading concept of Habsburg politics. After clever diplomatic overtures, Ferdinand was elected king of Bohemia (October 23, 1526). In Hungary, however, there was a split election; John (János Zápolya), voivode (governor) of Transylvania, was chosen by an opposition party, whereupon war broke out between the two candidates.\n\nFerdinand’s troops in Hungary would have been in a stronger position had John not been assisted by the Turks under Süleyman I, sultan of the Ottoman Empire. In 1529 the Turks advanced as far as Vienna, which they besieged in vain. Another Turkish offensive came to a halt at Güns in western Hungary in 1532. Ferdinand, on the other hand, failed in his attempt to take Ofen (Hungarian: Buda), where the Turks had entrenched themselves. By about the middle of the century, the frontiers had become fixed. Hungary happened to be divided into three parts: the west and the north remained with the Habsburgs, the central part came under Turkish rule, and Transylvania and its adjoining territory were kept by John and his successors. This situation was anticipated in the truce of 1547 and became formalized in the Peace of Constantinople (1562).\n\nDuring a short truce in the fighting against John and the Turks, Ferdinand started to reorganize Austrian administration. In 1527 he created new central organs: the Privy Council (Geheimer Rat), for foreign affairs and dynastic matters; the Court Council (Hofrat), as the supreme legal authority; the Court Chancery (Hofkanzlei), which served as the central office and only later dealt with internal affairs; and the Court Treasury (Hofkammer), for finance and budgeting. As the Court Treasury proved inefficient in the financing of the Turkish war, the Court Council of War (Hofkriegsrat) was established in 1556 to take care of the pay, equipment, and supplies of the troops, acquiring some influence on military operations as well.\n\nAdvance of Protestantism\n\nThe Protestant movement gained ground rapidly in Austria. The nobility in particular turned toward the Lutheran creed. For generations eminent families provided the protagonists of Protestantism in the Lower and Inner Austrian territories. The sons of the nobility were often sent to North German universities to expose them more fully to Protestant influence. From 1521 Protestant pamphlets were produced by Austrian printers. Bans on them, issued from 1523 onward, remained ineffective.\n\nAmong the peasant population, the Anabaptists had a stronger appeal than the Lutherans. However, as they had no support from the estates and because of their radicalism, the Anabaptists were persecuted from the start. In 1528 Balthasar Hubmaier, their leader in the Danube countries and in southern Moravia, was burned at the stake in Vienna. In 1536 another Anabaptist, the Tirolean Jakob Hutter, was burned at the stake in Innsbruck after he had led many of his followers into Moravia. Ferdinand, for his part, advocated religious reconciliation and looked for means to achieve it, but the dogmatic viewpoints proved irreconcilable. The Peace of Augsburg (1555) finally brought some respite in the religious struggles.\n\nCharles V abdicated in 1556, and in 1558 Ferdinand I became Holy Roman emperor; thus, the leadership of the empire was taken over by the Austrian (German) line of the Habsburgs. Maximilian II, the eldest son, followed his father in Bohemia, Hungary, and the Austrian Danube territories (1564). The next son, Ferdinand, was endowed with Tirol and the Vorlande; Charles, the youngest of the brothers, received the Inner Austrian lands and took up residence in Graz. Maximilian was known for his Protestant leanings but was bound by a promise he had given his father to remain true to the Roman Catholic religion. The Protestants were therefore granted fewer concessions from him than they might have expected.\n\nMeanwhile, Roman Catholic counteractivity began, with the Jesuits particularly prominent in Vienna, Graz, and Innsbruck. A new generation of energetic bishops proved a great asset to the cause. It was also of some importance that the monasteries, though they had been deserted by many of their members and were struggling for existence, had not been secularized. On the Protestant side, it proved impossible to reconcile the various reforming movements. Social differences between them, especially between the nobility and the peasants, also stood in the way of a united Protestant front. The Counter-Reformation scored its first successes in Gorizia and Carniola, where Protestantism had remained insignificant. And, in other parts, official religious commissions started to replace the Protestant preachers with Roman Catholic clergymen.\n\nRudolf II and Matthias\n\nMaximilian’s successor as Holy Roman emperor and as archduke of Austria, his son Rudolf II (reigned 1576–1612), had been educated in Spain strictly in the Roman Catholic faith. He had all Protestants dismissed from court service. The conversion of the cities and market centres of Lower Austria to Roman Catholicism was conducted by Melchior Klesl, at that time administrator of the Vienna see but later to become bishop and cardinal. In Upper Austria, where the Protestants had their strongest hold, the situation remained undecided, with the Roman Catholic governor Hans Jakob Löbl of Greinburg and the Calvinist Georg Erasmus of Tschernembl leading the opposing religious parties. When the future emperor Ferdinand II (the son of Charles, the ruler of Inner Austria) took over in Steiermark, he proved to be the most resolute advocate of the Counter-Reformation. It was he who eventually succeeded in uprooting Protestantism, first in Inner Austria and then in the other Habsburg countries, with the exception of Hungary and Silesia.\n\nFrom local skirmishes along the frontier, a long drawn-out war with the Turks developed (1592–1606). In 1598 Raab (now Győr, Hungary), which served as a bastion of Vienna, was temporarily lost; Gran, Veszprém (now in Hungary), and Stuhlweissenburg (now Székesfehérvár, Hungary) passed several times from one side to the other. The introduction of the Counter-Reformation in Hungary, moreover, resulted in a rising of Protestant elements under István Bocskay. But in 1606 at Vienna, a peace was concluded between Austria and the Hungarian estates. At Zsitvatorok another peace was negotiated with the Turks, who for the first time recognized Austria and the emperor as an equal partner.\n\nPolitical disagreements between Emperor Rudolf, who, to an increasing degree, showed signs of mental derangement, and the rest of the family led to the so-called Habsburg Brothers Conflict. Cardinal Klesl in 1607 brought about an agreement between the younger relatives of the emperor to recognize his brother Matthias as the head of the family. As the conflicts with Rudolf persisted, Matthias strove to come to an understanding with the estates, which were mainly Protestant. The formation of opposing religious leagues in Germany, the Protestant Union and the Catholic League, added to the general confusion.\n\nMatthias advanced into Bohemia, and, in the Treaty of Lieben (1608), Rudolf conceded to him the rule of Hungary, the Austrian Danube countries, and Moravia, while Matthias had to give up the Tirol and the Vorlande to the emperor. In 1609 the estates received a confirmation of the concessions that Maximilian II had made to them. The cities were guaranteed only in general terms that their old privileges should not be interfered with. At the same time, Rudolf II was forced to grant to Bohemia the so-called Letter of Majesty, which contained far-reaching concessions to the Protestants. After a final defeat of Rudolf in Bohemia in 1611, Matthias was crowned king of Bohemia. Rudolf’s death in 1612 finally ended the conflict.\n\nAfter Matthias had been elected emperor, his principal councillor, Cardinal Klesl, tried in vain to arrange an agreement with the Protestants in Germany. The ensuing years were filled with wars in Transylvania, where Gábor Bethlen came to power. In the Peace of Tyrnau (1615) the emperor had to recognize Bethlen as prince of Transylvania, and, in the same year, he extended the truce with the Turks for another 25 years. In the meantime, war had broken out with Venice (1615–17) because of the pirating activities of Serb refugees (Uskoken) established on the Croatian coast. A settlement was reached in the Peace of Madrid. The situation in Bohemia then reached a critical point, the religious tensions in the country finding a vent in the Defenestration of Prague (May 23, 1618), in which two of the emperor’s regents were thrown from the windows of the Hradčany Palace.\n\nThe Bohemian rising and the victory of the Counter-Reformation\n\nWar became inevitable when Emperor Matthias died in 1619. Not that he had been master of the situation, but his death brought Ferdinand II, the most uncompromising Counter-Reformer, to the head of the house of Habsburg. Ferdinand was hard-pressed at first, as Bohemian and Moravian troops invaded Austria. A deputation of the estates of Lower Austria tried to make him renounce Bohemia in a peace treaty and demanded religious concessions for themselves, unsuccessfully. The Bohemians were forced to retreat, and imperial troops advanced into their country. The Bohemians deposed Ferdinand from the throne of Bohemia and elected Count Palatine Frederick V in his stead; two days later, however, Ferdinand II was elected Holy Roman emperor at Frankfurt (August 28, 1619).\n\nWar was the only means of resolving the issue. The conflict for the Bohemian crown developed into a European war—the so-called Thirty Years’ War—when Spain, the Bavarian duke Maximilian I, and the Protestant elector of Saxony entered the struggle on the side of the emperor. The Upper Austrian estates rashly joined Frederick V, with the result that their country was occupied by the army of the Catholic League and afterward pledged to Bavaria. At the Battle of the White Mountain, Ferdinand II became master of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, while Lusatia was pledged to Saxony. King Frederick fled to the Netherlands. The leaders of the Bohemian rising were executed, and other nobles who had compromised themselves lost their property. Many Protestants left the country. In the new constitution of 1627, Bohemia and its associated lands became a hereditary kingdom. The diets were not dissolved entirely, as the government wanted to make use of their administration, but their influence was restricted to financial matters.\n\nAfter the death of Matthias, Ferdinand had also inherited the Danubian territories. Tirol, however, retained a special status under a new Habsburg secundogeniture (inheritance by a second branch of the house). Upper Austria, pledged to Bavaria, was disturbed by a great peasant rising. The Protestant peasants were defeated after heavy fighting, and in 1628 the country passed into the hands of the emperor again.\n\nThe Counter-Reformation was vigorously enforced in the Austrian domains. This led to the mass emigration of Protestants, including many members of the nobility. Most went to the Protestant states and to the imperial cities of southern Germany. After the Bohemian victory the war went favourably for the emperor, and the Peace of Lübeck (1629) seemed to secure the hegemony in Germany for the Habsburgs. But in 1629 Ferdinand’s attempt in the Edict of Restitution (Restitutionsedikt) to establish religious unity by force throughout the empire provoked the violent opposition of the Protestants.\n\nStruggle with Sweden and France\n\nJuly 1630 saw intervention in Germany’s religious strife from a different quarter—Sweden. In that month the Protestant Swedish king, Gustav II Adolf, landed on the Baltic coast of Pomerania. His purpose was to defend the Protestants against further oppression, to restore the dukes of Mecklenburg, his relatives, who had been driven from their lands by Ferdinand’s forces, and perhaps to strengthen Sweden’s strategic position in the Baltic. In the ensuing conflict, the German city of Magdeburg was destroyed by fire after it had been taken by the emperor’s troops under General Johann Tserclaes, Graf (count) von Tilly (1631). The North German Protestants, who had so far remained undecided, consequently went over to the Swedes. After victories in the Battle of Breitenfeld and on the Lech River, the Swedish troops entered Bavaria.\n\nDuring the subsequent period of the Thirty Years’ War, Ferdinand adopted a rigorous and often unrelenting attitude, though he yielded a little when the Peace of Prague was being negotiated (1635). His successor, Ferdinand III (1637–57), was as loyal to Roman Catholicism as his father had been but showed himself more of a realist. He was not able, however, to prevent the war from again dragging into Habsburg territory, so in 1645 even Vienna was threatened. The extremist party that had rejected all concessions lost its influence at the Vienna court, and two able diplomats, Maximilian, Graf von Trauttmansdorff, and Isaac Volmar, were entrusted with the representation of a weakened Austria at the German cities of Münster and Osnabrück, where extended negotiations were conducted until acceptable terms could be settled for Austria. In the Peace of Westphalia (1648), Austria lost its possessions in Alsace, and Lusatia had to be ceded for good to Saxony.\n\nThe peace in many respects marked the beginning of a new epoch. The Holy Roman Empire from then on was reduced to a loose union of otherwise independent states, and Habsburg politics shifted its emphasis, falling back entirely on the political, military, and financial resources of the hereditary Habsburg lands, now including Bohemia. The new central organs and the administrative bodies of the territories took on much greater importance than the remaining institutions of the Holy Roman Empire. The emperor came to rely on a standing army rather than on troops provided by the German princes.\n\nThe heavy drain the religious wars had made on the population of the Austrian territories was compensated for by immigrants from the Roman Catholic parts of the empire and Croatian refugees from the southeast. The economic position of the peasants on the whole deteriorated. Many members of the nobility, as well as the church, acquired new property. In mining, boom and depression followed quickly upon each other. The loss of many experienced miners during the Counter-Reformation resulted in difficulties, but the government took several steps toward improving and extending the salt mines. In 1625 it founded the Innerberg Union, under which Steiermark’s iron industry was reorganized. The emperor also tried to interfere with the trade organizations of the towns, though without much success. Trade and finance in the Austrian territories were dominated by foreign capital.\n\nThe cultural life of the period was also dominated by the religious struggle. In the field of education the schools of the denominational parties rivaled each other. In 1585 a Jesuit university was founded at Graz, while at Salzburg a Benedictine university was established (1623). Austrian humanists produced some outstanding works of poetry and historical writings, and the sovereigns were great patrons of the arts, but on the whole this was an epoch dominated by Italian and Western influences.\n\nAustria as a great power\n\nAfter the Thirty Years’ War, Austrian rulers were understandably reluctant to enter into another military conflict. In 1654 Ferdinand IV, the eldest son of the emperor, died. His brother, the future emperor Leopold I, who had been destined for a church career, was then considered as heir to the throne and was recognized as such by Austria, Bohemia, and Hungary. In Germany, however, difficulties arose when France declared itself against Leopold. Nevertheless, following the death of Emperor Ferdinand, Leopold was finally elected (1658) after having conceded constitutional limitations that restricted his liberty of action in foreign politics. West German princes under Johann Philipp von Schönborn, archbishop of Mainz, formed the French-oriented League of the Rhine. At the same time, Austria was engaged in the northeast when it intervened in the war between Sweden and Poland (1658) in order to prevent the collapse of Poland. There were some military successes, but the Treaty of Oliva (1660) brought no territorial gains for Austria, though it stopped the advance of the Swedes in Germany.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years’ War the Turkish front had been quiet, but in the 1660s a new war broke out with the Turks (1663–64) because of a conflict over Transylvania, where a successor had to be appointed for György II Rákóczi, who had been killed fighting against the Turks. The Turks conquered the fortress of Neuhäusel in Slovakia, but the imperial troops succeeded in throwing them back. The Austrian military success was not, however, reflected in the terms of the Treaty of Vasvár: Transylvania was given to Mihály Apafi, a ruler of pro-Turkish sympathies. A minor territorial concession was also made to the Turks. The year after the Turkish peace, Tirol and the Vorlande reverted to Leopold I (1665), and the second period of the Habsburg partition (1564–1665) came to an end.\n\nIn Hungary dissatisfaction with the results of the Turkish war spread. Not only the Protestants, who were threatened by the Counter-Reformation, but also many Roman Catholic nobles were alarmed by Habsburg absolutism. A group of Hungarian nobles and Steiermark’s Count Hans Erasmus of Tattenbach entered into a conspiracy. The Austrian government, informed of their activities, had four of the ringleaders executed—an action that led to a rising by rebels known as Kuruzen (Crusaders).\n\nIn the meantime, the position of the Habsburgs in the west had again deteriorated. At first, Leopold I’s leading statesmen, Johann Weikhart, Fürst (prince) von Auersperg (dismissed in 1669), and the president of the Court Council of War, Wenzel Eusebius, Fürst von Lobkowitz, remained rather passive in view of the expansionist policies of Louis XIV of France. They also stayed outside the Triple Alliance of Holland, England, and Sweden that was concluded in order to ward off the attacks of Louis against the Spanish Netherlands. When Louis actually invaded Holland, the emperor finally entered the war, but, in the ensuing Treaties of Nijmegen (1679), he had to cede Freiburg im Breisgau to France.\n\nAnother and still more menacing danger appeared in the southeast. After some deliberation the leader of the Hungarian rebels, Imre Thököli, had asked the Turks for help, whereupon the grand vizier Kara Mustafa Pasa organized a large Turkish army and marched it toward Vienna. Habsburg diplomats succeeded in concluding an alliance between Austria and Poland. Meanwhile, imperial troops under Charles IV (or V) Leopold, duke of Lorraine and Bar, tried to hold back the Turks but had to retreat. From July 17 to September 12, 1683, Vienna was besieged by the Turks. Deciding against a direct assault, the Turks had begun to drill tunnels underneath the bastions of the city when relief columns arrived from Bavaria, Saxony, Franconia, and Poland. King John III Sobieski of Poland took over the command of the relieving army, which descended upon the Turks and dispersed them. The emperor concluded a pact with Poland and the Venetian republic known as the Holy League. In 1685 Neuhäusel was won back, and in September 1686 Ofen (Buda) was captured despite fierce Turkish resistance.\n\nIn 1687 the Hungarian diet recognized the hereditary rights of the male line of the Habsburgs to the Hungarian throne. In 1688 Belgrade, Serbia, was conquered, and Transylvania was secured by imperial troops. Meanwhile, Louis XIV had begun an offensive against the German Palatinate that grew into the War of the Grand Alliance. This war meant that no further troops could be spared for the Turkish war, and in 1690 all recent conquests in the south, including Belgrade, were lost again. A victory of the imperial and the allied German troops under Margrave Louis William I of Baden-Baden near Slankamen, Serbia, (1691) prevented the Turks from advancing farther, but then the margrave was ordered to the Rhine front. Eventually Prince Eugene of Savoy took over the command and gained a decisive victory over the Turks in the Battle of Zenta (1697). After another offensive against Bosnia, the Turks finally decided to negotiate a peace. In the Treaty of Carlowitz (1699) Hungary, Transylvania, and large parts of Slavonia (now in Croatia) fell to the Habsburg emperor. Meanwhile, the war in the west, overshadowed already by the question of the Spanish succession, had come to an end with the Treaty of Rijswijk (1697).\n\nWar of the Spanish Succession\n\nFrom 1701 to 1714 Austria was involved in hostilities with France—the War of the Spanish Succession—over the heir to the Spanish throne. The childless king Charles II of Spain, a Habsburg, had willed all his possessions to a Bourbon prince—a grandson of Louis XIV of France. All those who disliked the idea of a French hegemony in Europe consequently united against the French. The emperor declared war (1701) and was immediately supported by Brandenburg-Prussia and Hanover. In the spring of 1702, England and Holland entered the war in the Grand Alliance against France. Louis XIV was able to win the electoral princes of Bavaria and Cologne as his allies. At this critical juncture another Hungarian rising, led by Ferenc II Rákóczi, occurred. The rebels were prepared to join forces with the enemies of Austria and for years engaged Austrian troops. The rebels even threatened Vienna, whose suburbs had to be fortified. In the war with France, imperial troops fought on four fronts: in Italy, on the Rhine, in the Spanish Netherlands, and in Spain. Much larger forces were mobilized than had been customary during the 17th century, and the financial drain on the imperial treasury was so heavy that the emperor had to resort to Dutch and English loans. When Bavaria entered the war on the side of the French, Austria was in further danger, until the Battle of Blenheim (1704), in which an English and Austrian army under the duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy defeated the French and Bavarian forces.\n\nAfter a reign of 48 years filled with almost endless troubles, Emperor Leopold died in 1705. He was succeeded by his son, Joseph I (reigned 1705–11). In the religious quarrels the new emperor, an ally of Protestant states, showed great restraint and allowed himself to be guided mainly by political motives.\n\nIn 1703 Victor Amadeus II, duke of Savoy, who had left the French to go over to the Habsburgs, found himself in a critical situation; his capital, Turin, had come under French siege. An imperial army under Prince Eugene and reinforced by a Prussian contingent was sent to his aid and succeeded in uniting with the Savoyan forces and relieving Turin after a victorious battle (1706). At the beginning of the next year, an agreement was reached under which the French evacuated northern Italy. The same year, a smaller imperial army under Wirich, Graf (count) von Daun, conquered Spanish-ruled southern Italy, but an invasion of southern France, which the sea powers had instigated, failed. A quick success, however, fell to the Austrians in a campaign against the Vatican state over a conflict between the emperor and the Roman Curia concerning mutual feudal rights and caused by Pope Clement XI’s rather pro-French leanings.\n\nThe allies were victorious in the Netherlands, winning the Battle of Oudenaarde and conquering Lille (1708). Paris seemed within easy reach. The Battle of Malplaquet (1709) was another victory for the allies, but they had to pay dearly for it. In the meantime, peace negotiations had foundered. After reverses in Spain and a political change in England, the alliance itself was in danger of falling apart. The situation was further aggravated by the death in 1711 of Emperor Joseph I, who left only daughters.\n\nAt this juncture, liquidation of the Hungarian rising became possible. Rákóczi, who in 1707 had declared the deposition of the Habsburgs, began to meet with growing opposition among his followers. Imperial troops forced Rákóczi to flee to Poland, and the rebels, who had been promised an amnesty and who were guaranteed religious liberty, made their peace in 1711. From then on the Vienna government tried to be more considerate of Hungary and its aristocracy.\n\nThe election of Charles VI as emperor was effected without any difficulties. The English left the coalition, and after a military reverse most of the Habsburgs’ allies joined the treaties of Utrecht (1713–14). In the peace negotiations between Austria and France that were begun at Rastatt, Germany, Prince Eugene showed himself an unyielding and successful agent of Habsburg interests. Austria gained the Spanish Netherlands (henceforth known as the Austrian Netherlands), a territory corresponding approximately to modern Belgium and Luxembourg. These gains were somewhat impaired, however, by the Dutch privilege of stationing garrisons in a number of fortresses. In Italy, Austria received Milan, Mantua, Mirandola, the continental part of the Kingdom of Naples, and the isle of Sardinia. The Wittelsbachs of Bavaria regained their country, but the treaty contained an appendix that provided for the eventuality of Bavaria’s being exchanged for the Netherlands. Of its gains, the northern Italian territories were of the greatest value to Austria; the possession of Naples and the Netherlands, on the other hand, posed considerable military and political risks.\n\nProblem of the Austrian succession\n\nThe extinction of the Spanish line of the Habsburgs and the fact that the emperor Charles VI was the last male member of that house posed serious problems for the Habsburg territories, which, at the beginning of the 18th century, were held together mainly by the person of the sovereign, notwithstanding the fact that there were some institutions of central administration. A settlement was made in the form of a family ordinance. On April 19, 1713, Charles VI issued a decree, according to which the Habsburg lands should remain an integral, undivided whole. In the event of the Habsburgs’ becoming extinct in the male line, the daughters of Charles or their descendants or, in default of any descendants of Charles, the daughters of Joseph I and their descendants and, after them, all other female members of the house, should be eligible for the succession. As the son that was born to the emperor in 1716 died after a few months and only daughters were born to him after that (Maria Theresa, 1717; Maria Anna, 1718; Maria Amalia, 1724), this Pragmatic Sanction (a term used to characterize a pronouncement by a sovereign on a matter of prime importance) became of great significance. Austrian diplomacy in the last decades of Charles’s reign was directed toward securing acceptance of the Pragmatic Sanction from all the European powers. It was published in 1720 and by 1722 had been recognized by the estates of all the Habsburg countries. Even the unanimous consent of the Hungarian diet was eventually obtained.\n\nNew conflicts with the Turks and the Bourbons\n\nDuring the War of the Spanish Succession, the Ottoman Empire had remained neutral toward Austria. But the Turks had attacked the possessions of the Venetians on the Peloponnese and on the Ionian Islands. Austria tried to intervene and finally declared war. Prince Eugene defeated the Turks near the fortress of Peterwardein (Petrovaradin, now part of Novi Sad, Serbia) and conquered the strong bastion of Temesvár (now Timișoara, Romania) in 1716. In the summer campaign of 1717, Belgrade again came into the hands of the imperial troops after a battle was won against a Turkish relief army. In the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), a frontier line was agreed upon that corresponded to the de facto situation. The Turks had to cede to the Austrians the Banat region, the Turkish part of Syrmia (Srem, now part of Vojvodina, Serbia), Walachia Minor as far as the Olt (Aluta) River, northern Serbia, Belgrade, and a strip of land along the frontier in northern Bosnia. A favourable trade agreement was also concluded.\n\nDuring the Turkish war another crisis emerged. The Spanish minister Giulio Alberoni tried to initiate a policy of expansion in Italy. When Spanish troops landed in Sardinia and Sicily, the emperor formed an alliance with Great Britain and France, later joined by the Dutch Republic (the Quadruple Alliance). After the English defeated the Spanish fleet, Madrid recalled its troops from the disputed territories. Austria received the more prosperous Sicily in exchange for Sardinia, which fell to Savoy. Charles then agreed to recognize the Spanish Bourbons. The gains from the Quadruple Alliance plus those of the Treaty of Passarowitz gave the Habsburgs the largest territory they were ever to rule. Their domains were far from unified, however, with the individual provinces showing a wide national, economic, cultural, and constitutional diversity.\n\nTrading interests soon interfered with the empire’s alliance with the maritime powers of Britain and the Dutch Republic. At first the attempts of the Ostend Company, which was backed by Charles VI, to enter into trade with India were quite successful. Because of the antipathy of the maritime powers, however, it seemed advisable to find an alternative to trade with Dutch and British colonial markets in the vast transatlantic empire of Spain. In 1725 Charles entered into an alliance with Spain, whereupon France, Great Britain, and Prussia formed a rival alliance. But soon after Russia was won over to the Habsburg cause, Prussia changed sides. As the outbreak of a European war seemed imminent, attempts were made at the Congress of Soissons to relax political tensions. Spain abruptly changed its alliances and concluded a treaty (1729) with England and France, the Dutch Republic joining later. When Russia also began to waver, Prince Eugene tried to fall back on the traditional alliance with the maritime powers. After prolonged and difficult negotiations, Britain in 1731 accepted the Pragmatic Sanction, the emperor in return giving a promise not to marry his daughter Maria Theresa, the Habsburg heiress, to a prince who was himself heir to important domains. Austria finally dissolved the Ostend Company, having already suspended its charter in 1727. Charles VI then invested a great deal of energy in his endeavours to secure the recognition and the guarantee of the Pragmatic Sanction in the German diet. In this he was opposed by Bavaria and the elector of Saxony, but Austria finally obtained the guarantee of the Pragmatic Sanction at the Regensburg Diet (1732).\n\nThe question of the Polish succession led to a revival of the Austrian conflict with the Bourbon countries. Austria, with Prussia and Russia, favoured Augustus III of Saxony, the son of the deceased king, whereas France backed Stanisław I (Stanisław Leszczyński). On the military intervention of Russia in Poland, the Bourbons attacked Austria. The issue came to be mixed up with the problem of Lorraine; France dreaded that, on the impending marriage of Maria Theresa to Francis Stephen, duke of Lorraine, the latter’s domains would be united with Austria’s, and French plans for the acquisition of Lorraine would be thwarted. France, Sardinia, and Spain simultaneously opened the war against Austria in 1733. Prince Eugene, who was now aged, was able only to prevent a major success of the enemy on the Rhine. On the Italian front the Habsburgs fared even worse. The Battle of Parma ended undecided, but the Austrians were finally beaten near Guastalla in northern Italy. The small Austrian force that was stationed in southern Italy was unable to resist the Spanish attack, and Sicily and Naples were occupied by the Spaniards. In 1735 a Russian relieving corps reinforced the Habsburg front on the Rhine, and in northern Italy there were also a few successful operations of some local importance.\n\nDirect contacts between Austria and France eventually led to the preliminary Peace of Vienna (October 3, 1735). Austria lost Naples and Sicily, which fell to a secondary branch of the Bourbons, and had to cede a tract of territory in Lombardy to Sardinia. As some compensation, Austria received Parma and Piacenza. Francis Stephen of Lorraine was promised Tuscany but had to renounce his hereditary duchy. On these conditions, France agreed to recognize the Pragmatic Sanction. The final peace was then concluded at Vienna in 1738.\n\nPrince Eugene had died during the War of the Polish Succession. It soon proved disastrous that a successor of similar capacity was not found. During the second Turkish war of Charles VI (1737–39), Austria joined in the Turkish-Russian conflict but without coordination of military operations. The Austrians, furthermore, underrated the Turkish forces and were themselves reduced by epidemics. The fortress of Niš, Serbia, was taken but was lost again soon afterward. Peace negotiations conducted at Nemirov, Ukraine, were broken off, and the war went on. The Austrians lost another battle at Grocka, Serbia. Again peace negotiations were launched, in the course of which the larger part of the gains of the Peace of Passarowitz were lost. More disquieting even than the territorial losses was the loss in prestige. The epoch that had seen the rise of Austria to a great power thus ended with reverses.\n\nSocial, economic, and cultural trends in the Baroque period\n\nThe Thirty Years’ War and the Turkish wars had resulted in the devastation of large parts of the country and in great losses among the population, which suffered further reduction during the plague years of 1679 and 1713. The territories that had been wrested from the Turks had to be resettled systematically by German and other immigrants. The initiative for resettlement projects came from the official bureaucracy, the settlements being concentrated mainly in the south of Hungary. During the period of religious conflicts, many Protestants had been exiled, but, in the 18th century, Protestants often were transported to the various underpopulated parts of the empire.\n\nIn the industrial and commercial fields, mercantilist ideas, encouraged by the government, were prominent from the 1660s. The situation of the peasantry was thoroughly unfavourable. Tentative measures in the reigns of Leopold I and Charles VI to protect the peasants had little effect. Certain “model industries” (mostly textile factories) were established but were only partly successful. The economic policy of the absolutist state also resulted in strong interference with trade organizations. The guilds were suppressed or at least debarred from the new manufactures.\n\nTrade was encouraged but yielded only small gains for the state. Industrial and commercial undertakings were managed in part directly by the state but largely through privileged corporations or private persons. Of some importance were the first (1667) and the second (1719) Oriental trading companies and the Ostend Company (1722). Trade in the Mediterranean was also intensified. Promising colonial ventures in India were discontinued for political reasons, however, in the middle of the 18th century. Under Charles VI new roads came to be planned and built on a large scale.\n\nThe state was in permanent want of money. This was a period of perpetual war as well as great economic investments, both entailing excessive strain on state finances. At first the government resorted to rich bankers such as Samuel Oppenheimer and his successor Samson Wertheimer for funds. Soon, however, it attempted to establish state-controlled banking firms. The Banco del Giro, founded in Vienna in 1703, quickly failed, but the Vienna Stadtbanco of 1705 managed to survive; the Universalbancalität of 1715 was liquidated after a short period of operation.\n\nAfter the victory of the Counter-Reformation, education was almost exclusively in the hands of the Roman Catholic Church. The grammar schools of the religious orders, especially of the Jesuits and the Benedictines, set a very high standard for the most part. In 1677 another university was established at Innsbruck, the theological school of which was to acquire some fame. Historical writing flourished, the most outstanding works being those of two Benedictine brothers, Bernard and Hieronymus Pez; Gottfried Bessel, abbot of Göttweig; and Leopold I’s official historiographer, the Jesuit Franz Wagner. The Austrian Jesuits were famous for their scientific and geographic researches, most notably the exploration of China.\n\nAmong the achievements of Baroque poetry, mention should be made of Wolf Helmhart of Hohberg, whose works offer interesting insights into the life of the nobility, and of Katharina of Greiffenberg, a Protestant whose intensely spiritual poems reflected the pressures of the Counter-Reformation. The theatre of the Baroque was remarkable for the splendour of its decorations and the ingenuity of its stage machinery. The plays produced ranged from the elaborate Italian opera to the blunt humour of the popular play. Music attained an especially high standard, encouraged by three emperors who were themselves composers (Ferdinand III, Leopold I, and Joseph I). Charles VI was also a skillful musician, and he engaged the services of Johann Joseph Fux, who came from eastern Steiermark and developed into an important composer and teacher.\n\nAustrian Baroque culture is most clearly revealed by the splendours of its architecture. At first the field was dominated by the Italians, but soon native architects stepped forth. Preeminent among them was Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach (whose works included the first plan of the Schloss Schönbrunn in Vienna, Karls Church in Vienna, and Kollegien Church in Salzburg) and his son Josef Emanuel Fischer von Erlach (who designed the Hof Library in Vienna). They were rivaled by Jakob Prandtauer (whose works included monasteries in Herzogenburg and Melk) and especially by Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt (who designed the Schwarzenberg and Belvedere palaces in Vienna, Peters Church in Vienna, and the monastery of Göttweig). Among native sculptors, Georg Raphael Donner was the first in rank and quality of work. Fresco painting was best represented by Johann Michael Rottmayr from Salzburg, Daniel Gran from Vienna, and Paul Troger from the Tirolean Pustertal valley.\n\nErich Zöllner Reinhold F. Wagnleitner"
