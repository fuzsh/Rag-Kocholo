        "text": "Elizabeth of the Palatinate (November 16, 1483 – June 24, 1522) was a member of the House of Wittelsbach and a Countess Palatine of Simmern and by marriage, successively Landgravine of Hesse-Marburg and Margravine of Baden.\n\nLife\n\nElizabeth was a daughter of Prince-Elector Philipp of the Palatinate (1448–1508) from his marriage to Margaret of Bavaria (1456–1501), daughter of Duke Ludwig IX of Bavaria-Landshut from his marriage to Amalia of Saxony (1436–1501), daughter of Prince-Elector Elector Friedrich II of Saxony and his wife Duchess Margaret of Austria (a sister of Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich III).\n\nPrince-Elector Philipp of the Palatinate was the only son of Count Ludwig IV of the Palatine of the Rhine and his wife Margaret of Savoy.\n\nElizabeth of the Palatinate first married on February 12, 1496, in Heidelberg with Landgrave Wilhelm III the Younger of Hesse-Marburg [Upper Hesse] (1471–1500). The marriage tied Wilhelm III closer to the Palatinate House of Wittlesbach while his cousins in Cassel were considered to be partisans of the Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nIn the event he would die without an heir, Wilhelm III had promised Elizabeth almost the entire county of Katzenelnbogen as wittum. The term wittum referred initially to steps taken by a husband to provide for his wife if she became a widow. Originally the wittum consisted only of movable property. Later it became real property, which was designated by a certificate.\n\nThe wittum became more and more similar to the dower, or replaced dower, until finally Wittum and dower were no longer clearly separated.\n\nThe wittum provided a pension for widows because it was in their possession for their entire life. In old German law, the wittum was a purchase price to be paid by the groom to the head of the bride’s family in order to receive guardianship authority over the bride.\n\nHowever, when Landgrave Wilhelm III died, his whole territory, including Katzenelnbogen, was inherited by his cousin Landgrave Wilhelm II of Hesse-Cassel.\n\nLandgrave Wilhelm II (1469 – 1509) was Landgrave of Lower Hesse from 1493 and Landgrave of Upper Hesse after the death of his cousin, Landgrave Wilhelm III of Upper Hesse in 1500.\n\nLandgrave Wilhelm II of Hesse-Cassel is also called “Wilhelm the Middle” to distinguish him from his elder brother “Wilhelm I the Elder”, and his cousin “Wilhelm III, the Younger”.\n\nLandgrave Wilhelm II of Hesse-Cassel parents were Landgrave Ludwig II of Lower Hesse (1438–1471) and Mechthild of the Palatinate, daughter of Prince-Elector Ludwig III Lower Hesse and his wife Matilda of Savoy.\n\nThe Palatinate party then proposed that Elisabeth should marry Landgrave Wilhelm II of Hesse-Cassel. Wilhelm II declined, and married Princess Anna of Mecklenburg-Schwerin a daughter of Duke Magnus II of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1441–1503), and Sophie of Pomerania-Stettin (ca.1460 – 1504). She was a member of the 13th Generation of the Princely House of Mecklenburg.\n\nLandgrave Wilhelm II also participated in the imperial ban against Elisabeth’s father (Prince-Elector Philipp of the Palatinate) and brother,(Ruprecht, Count Palatine of the Rhine) because of the dispute over Elisabeth’s wittum.\n\nThree years after the death of her first husband Elisabeth married on January 3, 1503, in Heidelberg with Margrave Philipp I of Baden-Sponheim (1479–1533). In a contract concluded in 1508 with respect to Elizabeth’s dowry, it was stipulated that the part of Sponheim that Baden had ceded to the Palatinate in 1463, was to be returned to Baden.\n\nMargrave Philipp I of Baden-Sponheimthe fifth son of the Margrave Christopher I of Baden and Ottilie of Katzenelnbogen.\n\nFrom her second marriage to Margrave Philipp I of Baden Elisabeth had the following children:\n\nMarie Jakobäa (1507–1580)\n\nmarried in 1522 Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria (1493–1550)\n\nPhilipp (1508–1509)\n\nPhilipp Jakob (died 1511)\n\nEva Marie (died 1513)\n\nJohann Adam (died 1516)\n\nMax Kaspar (died 1519)\n\nMargrave Philipp I of Baden died in 1533 without male heirs. Of his six children only his daughter Maria Jakobäa (1507–1580) survived him. In 1522, she married Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria.\n\nHis two brothers, Margrave Ernst I of Baden-Durlach and Margrave Bernhard III of Baden-Baden divided his estate among themselves — the resulting margraviates of Baden-Durlach and Baden-Baden were reunified in 1771."
