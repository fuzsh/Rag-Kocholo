Kings of Thuringia in the 5th century are named by Gregory of Tours, who also records that the Merovingian kings Theoderic I and Clotaire I invaded and conquered the territory in 531. The chronicle known as Fredegar records that King Dagobert I installed Radulf as duke to rule Thuringia and that by the mid-7th century he had rebelled and reasserted the territory's independence. After King Sigebert defeated duke Radulf, Thuringia was governed by dukes from Würzburg .\n\nThere follows a gap in our knowledge of the history of Thuringia until the mid-8th century, although onomastics suggest a family connection between the dukes at that time and the earlier rulers. In the late 9th century, Poppo from the family of the Franconian \"alten\" Babenberger was installed briefly as duke in Thuringia by Emperor Arnulf. His successors were driven from Thuringia in 913, and another long gap in our detailed knowledge of the territory's history and rulers follows. Presumably Thuringia was at the time under the influence of Bavaria to the south, but this is not certain. In any case, the absence of information in contemporary chronicles suggests that little attention was paid to the area over the next couple of centuries.\n\nThe recorded history of Thuringia resumes in the early 11th century. Reconstruction of the family of the early counts and Landgrafen of Thuringia is heavily dependent on records written in the mid-13th century at the monastery of Reinhardsbrunn, which was founded by Graf Ludwig \"der Springer\" in the late 11th century. The early parts of the Cronica Reinhardsbrunnensis must be considered suspect as the chronicle includes the alleged confirmation by Emperor Konrad II of the privileges of Graf Ludwig \"Cum-barba\" as count in Thuringia, a document which is purportedly dated 1039 but which was a later 12th century forgery . According to the shorter Historia Brevis Principum Thuringiæ, which is presumably based on the Cronica and may have been written by the same author, Ludwig \"Cum-barba\" was \"de Karoli et Ludewici regum Francorum stirpe oriundus\" . The same source states that Gisela, wife of Emperor Konrad II was \"consanguineam\" of this first Ludwig. This statement is repeated in more detail in the Cronica. Empress Gisela was the daughter of Hermann II Duke of Swabia, from the Konradiner family of Franconia. Her known descent from the Carolingian French kings was through her maternal grandmother, Mathilde daughter of Louis IV \"d'Outremer\" King of the West Franks, who was the second wife of Conrad I King of Burgundy. The Cronica also records the origin of Graf Ludwig as \"ex Francia oriundi Cis Renum\", presumably indicating that he was from the left bank of the Rhine either in Lotharingia or further west in France itself. It also states that he and his brother arrived in Thuringia in 1034. The statements in these sources are unverifiable as no other source so far identified gives any further information about Ludwig's origin or the circumstances of his arrival in Thuringia. A further line of enquiry is, however, suggested by Graf Ludwig naming one of his sons Berengar, a name occurring in northern Lotharingia in the 9th and 10th centuries, although any conclusions based solely on onomastics would be speculative.\n\nIt is likely that Ludwig \"Cum-barba\" did have an aristocratic background. His burial at Mainz St Alban, the burial place of numerous German nobles, suggests that his family was well connected. In addition, the family quickly rose to prominence in Thuringia, his grandson being appointed Landgraf in 1131. This rise to power is difficult to understand unless the family had influential relatives.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss the Cronica as a late invention by a monk who wished to glorify the ancestry of the founder of his monastery. However, the author does not hold his punches elsewhere in the text. He is hardly complementary about the family when he records that the son of Graf Ludwig \"Cum-barba\" murdered his wife's first husband so that he could marry her. In addition, many of the more precise genealogical details in the Cronica and the Historia are corroborated by earlier sources, as will be seen in this document. It is therefore not impossible that the Reinhardsbrunn monks had at their disposal earlier texts which have since disappeared.\n\nThe last Landgraf of Thuringia died in 1247, after which a bitter dispute broke out over the inheritance between his niece Sophie, second wife of Henri II Duke of Brabant, and Heinrich \"der Erlauchte\" Markgraf von Meissen . The former claimed the territories of Hessen in Franconia, which had been brought into the family by the marriage of Hedwig von Gudensberg and Ludwig I Landgraf of Thuringia. However, Heinrich Markgraf von Meissen was enfeoffed by Willem II Count of Holland, anti-king of Germany, with the imperial territories previously held by the last Landgraf of Thuringia in return for recognising him as king . The claim of Heinrich, son of Sophie of Brabant, to the Hessian lands was recognised in 1264 and he was confirmed as Landgrafen in Hessen by imperial order dated 1292. Markgraf Heinrich's successor succeeded as Landgrafen of Thuringia, the territory eventually forming part of the reconstructed electorate of Saxony which was formed in the early 15th century.\n\nChapter 1. EARLY DUKES (KINGS) of THURINGIA\n\n1. BASINUS, son of --- (-after 464) . King of Thuringia. Gregory of Tours specifies that Childerich King of the Franks found refuge with Basinus King of Thuringia after being deposed , dated to [456/57]. m as her first husband, BASINA, daughter of ---. Gregory of Tours names Basina as wife of Basinus King of Thuringia, specifying that she deserted her first husband to join Childerich after he was restored as king in Gaul . Assuming that Basina existed, it is unlikely that her first name is correct considering that it is the feminine form of her first husband's name. She married secondly ([464]) Childerich I King of the Franks. The marriage date is estimated on the basis of how long Childerich was allegedly in exile, assuming that the date of his deposition is accurate, and is appears to be consistent with the estimated dates of birth of the couple's descendants.\n\n1. FISUD [Pisen] . King of Thuringia. m ---. The name of Fisud's wife is not known. Fisud & his wife had one child:\n\na) RANIGUNDA [Raicunda] . The Origo Gentis Langobardorum names \"Raicundam filia Fisud regis Turingorum\" as King Wacho's first wife . The Historia Langobardorum names \"Ranigunda filia Pisen regi Turingorum\" as Wacho's first wife . Paulus Diaconus names the three wives of Wacho \"primam Ranicundam, filiam Regis Turingorum Austrigosam, filiam regis Gepidorum tertiam Herulorum regis filiam Salingam\" . m as his first wife, WACHO King of the Lombards in Pannonia, son of ZUCHILO [Unichis] of the Lombards (-540).\n\nThree brothers, parents unknown. The Vitæ Sanctæ Radegundis names \"Radegundis natione barbare de regione Thoringa\" and her \"avo rege Bessino, patruo Hermenfredo, patre rege Bertechario\" . However, it seems chronologically unlikely that Baderic and his brothers were sons of King Basinus, assuming that the dates shown for this family grouping are correct.\n\n1. BADERIC . Gregory of Tours names Baderic, Hermanfrid and Berthar as three brothers ruling over the Thuringians, specifying that he was killed in battle by his brother Hermanfred allied with Theoderic King of the Franks . The Liber Historiæ Francorum names \"Ermenfredi duo fratres Baldericus et Bertecharius\" .\n\n2. HERMANFRED (-Zülpich 534) . Gregory of Tours names Baderic, Hermanfrid and Berthar as three brothers ruling over the Thuringians . King of the Thuringians. The Liber Historiæ Francorum records that \"Theudericus et Theudobertus filius eius et Chlotharius rex\" invaded Thuringia and attacked \"Ermenfredum regem Toringorum\", a marginal addition recording that \"Teodericus filius Clodovei ex concubina\" threw \"Ermenfridum regem\" from a wall and killed his two sons . Gregory of Tours records that Theoderic King of the Franks and his half-brother King Clotaire I invaded Thuringia in 531, deposed King Hermanfred and annexed the kingdom, specifying in a later passage that Hermanfred was later accidentally pushed from the top of the city walls of Zülpich while talking to Theoderic . m ([510]) AMALABERGA, daughter of [HUGA rex Francorum] & his wife Amalafrida the Ostrogoth . Iordanes names \"Amalabergam\" as the daughter of \"Amalfridam germanam suam [Theoderici]\" and records her marriage to \"Thuringorum regi Herminefredo\" . Procopius records that Hermenefrido Thoringorum regi married \"Theoderici Amelobergam, Amalafridæ sororis suæ filiam\" . Theodericus rex wrote to Herminafrido Regi Thuringorum granting him neptis in marriage . The Widukindi Res Gestæ Saxonicæ names \"Huga rex Francorum unicam filiam Amalbergam\" who married \"Irminfredo regi Thuringorum\" . Gregory of Tours calls Amalaberg, wife of Hermanfrid, a \"wicked and cruel woman\" who sowed the seeds of civil war between her husband and his brother Baderic . She escaped to Ravenna with her children after the Franks attacked Thuringia and killed her husband . King Hermanfred & his wife had four children:\n\na) two sons . The Liber Historiæ Francorum records that \"Theudericus et Theudobertus filius eius et Chlotharius rex\" invaded Thuringia and attacked \"Ermenfredum regem Toringorum\", a marginal addition recording that \"Teodericus filius Clodovei ex concubina\" threw \"Ermenfridum regem\" from a wall and killed his two sons .\n\nb) AMALAFRIDAS . Procopius records that \"Amalafridus, vir Gotthus, ex filia nepos Amalafridæ sororis Theoderici Gotthorum regis et filius Hermenefridi regis Thoringorum was deported to Byzantium with Vitigis King of Italy by Belisarius (in 540) .\n\nc) daughter . Procopius records that \"Amalafridus, vir Gotthus, ex filia nepos Amalafridæ sororis Theoderici Gotthorum regis et filius Hermenefridi regis Thoringorum sororem eius married \"Anduino Langobardorum regi\" . The Codex Theodosianus records that the daughter of Amalaberga became the second wife of King Audoin . m as his second wife, AUDOIN King of the Lombards, son of ---.\n\n3. BERTHAR . Gregory of Tours names Baderic, Hermanfrid and Berthar as three brothers ruling over the Thuringians, specifying that Hermanfrid defeated and killed his brother Berthar in battle . The Liber Historiæ Francorum names \"Ermenfredi duo fratres Baldericus et Bertecharius\" . m ---. The name of Berthar's wife is not known. Berthar & his wife had [four or more] children:\n\na) sons . Gregory of Tours refers to the unnamed sons of Berthar .\n\nb) RADEGUND (Erfurt 518-Poitiers 587, bur Poitiers, basilique Sainte-Marie-hors-les-Murs) . Gregory of Tours names Radegund as the orphaned daughter of Berthar . The Vitæ Sanctæ Radegundis names \"Radegundis natione barbare de regione Thoringa\" and her \"avo rege Bessino, patruo Hermenfredo, patre rege Bertechario\" . In a later passage, Gregory records that, after the Frankish invasion of Thuringia, Radegund formed part of the booty taken home by Clotaire I King of the Franks, who later married her . The testament of Radegundis dated to [584/87] survives . Gregory of Tours records the death of St Radegund on 13 Aug . She was canonised, her feast day is 13 Aug . m (531, repudiated) as his second wife, CLOTAIRE I [Chlothachar/Lothar] King of the Franks, son of CLOVIS I [Chlodovech] King of the Franks & his second wife Chrotechildis [Clotilde] of Burgundy ([501/02]-Soissons [30 Nov/31 Dec] 561, bur Soissons, basilique Saint-Médard).\n\nc) [AGNES (-after 587). Radegundis names \"sororem meam Agnetem\" several times in her testament dated to [584/87] . It is possible that the reference is to her \"sister\" in the religious sense.]\n\nCHAMAR, son of ---. m ---. The name of Chamar's wife is not known. Chamar & his wife had one child:\n\n1. RADULF (-after [632/33]). Fredegar records that Dagobert I King of the Franks installed \"Radulfus dux filius Chamaro\" as duke in Thuringia, in an undated passage but following one which deals with events in the 12th year of the king's reign [632/633], specifying that he won many victories against the Wends but revolted against King Sigebert . Fredegar records that he defeated King Sigebert's army, and called himself king of Thuringia .\n\n1. RADULF (-after 28 Jul 775). It is not known whether Radulf was related to the earlier Radulf King of Thuringia but this is certainly suggested by the name. \"Carolus rex Francorum et Langobardorum\" granted the monastery of Plaisir to Folrad abbot of Saint-Denis by charter dated 28 Jul 775 which name \"fidelibus Ghaerardo, Bernardo, Radulfo, Hilderado, Ermenaldo, Hebroino, Theudbaldo, Agneone comitibus, Haltberto, Laumberto, Haererico et Anselmo comite palatio nostro\" . m ---. The name of Radulf's wife is not known. Radulf & his wife had one child:\n\na) FASTRADA (-Frankfurt-am-Main 10 Oct 794, bur Mainz, St Alban ) . The Annales Laurissenses record the marriage in 783 at Worms of King Charles and \"domne Fastradæ regina\" . Einhard's Annals record the king's marriage in 783 to \"filiam Radolfi comitis natione Francam, nomine Fastradam\" . Fastrada, wife of King Charles, is referred to as \"de Orientalium Francorum, Germanorum videlicet\" by Einhard . Her cruelty triggered the revolt of her husband's illegitimate son Pépin \"le Bossu\" in 792 . The Annales Xantenses record the death in Frankfurt in 794 of \"Fastrada regina\" . Einhard records the death in 794 of \"Fastrada regina\" at Frankfurt and her burial \"Mogontiaci apud sanctum Albanum\" . Theodulf wrote the epitaph of \"Fastradæ reginæ\" . m (Worms Oct 783 ) as his third wife, CHARLES I King of the Franks, son of PEPIN \"le Bref\" King of the Franks & his wife Bertrada [Berta] \"au Grand Pied\" ([near Aix-la-Chapelle] 2 Apr [747/48]-Aix-la-Chapelle 28 Jan 814, bur Aix-la-Chapelle, Chapelle Sainte-Marie). He was crowned CHARLES I Charlemagne Emperor of the Romans in 800.\n\n1. THANKULF . m ---. The name of Thankulf's wife is not known. Thankulf & his wife had one child:\n\na) HADULF . Hadulf son of Thankulf is recorded in the 820s .\n\n1. THAKULF (-1 Aug or end Aug 873). Jackman suggests that Thakulf was the grandson of Thankulf . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Barbari\" sent legates to \"Thaculfum\" in 849 , although it is unclear from the context to which \"Barbarians\" this refers. The Gesta Francorum records that \"Thaculfum\" led troops against the Slavs \"in Sorabos\" in 858 . The Annales Fuldenses record the death of \"Thaculfus comes et dux Sorabici limitis\" in Aug 873 . The Gesta Francorum is more specific, recording the death of \"Thachulfus comes et dux Sorabici\" at the end of Aug 873 . However, the necrology of Fulda records the death in \"873 Kal Aug\" of \"Thacholf com\" . Duke in Thuringia.\n\n2. RADULF (-[874/80]). The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Sorabi et Siusli\" attacked in 874 after the death of \"Thachulfo\" and that \"Liutbertus archiepiscopus et Ratolfus Thaculfi successor\" crossed \"Salam fluvium\" in Jan 874 and suppressed the revolt \"sin bello\" . Jackman speculates that Radulf was the son of Duke Thakulf . Duke in Thuringia 874. Graf der Sorbenmark 874. The Gesta Francorum also names \"Ratolfus\" as successor of Thakulf in 874 . Radulf presumably died before 880 when the Annales Fuldenses record that \"Sclavi Dalmatii et Behemi atque Sorabi\" invaded Thuringia in 880 and devastated the land around \"Salam fluvium\", in which battle \"Poppo comes et dux Sorabici limitis\" fought .\n\n3. [daughter . Jackman speculates that Poppo owed his dukedom in Thuringia to having married the daughter of Duke Thakulf, sister of Duke Radulf . m POPPO [II], son of --- (-906 or after). Dux. Markgraf der Sorbenmark 892.]\n\nPOPPO [II], son of --- (-906 or after) . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Sclavi Dalmatii et Behemi atque Sorabi\" invaded Thuringia in 880 and devastated the land around \"Salam fluvium\", in which battle \"Poppo comes et dux Sorabici limitis\" fought , and in a later passage more specifically names \"Poppone fratre Heinrico et Eginone comitibus\", recording that he conquered \"Thuringis inferior\" . \"Arnolfus rex\" donated property \"in pago Uuormazfelda in comitatu Megingaudi in villa Dechidestein\" to Kloster Fulda on the proposal of \"Pobbonis et Deotpoldi [comitum]\" by charter dated 21 Jul 889 . Marchio. Markgraf der Sorbenmark 892. \"Arnolfus rex\" gave property \"nuncupante Hruodeshof in pago Folchfelda in comitatu Ebonis\" to \"nostræ Fridarun\" on the intervention of \"Popbonis marchionis nostri\" by charter dated 12 Jan 891 . The Annales Fuldenses record that \"Poppo dux Thuringorum\" was deprived of his honours in 891 . Dux. Regino records that \"Popponis Thuringorum ducis\" persuaded \"Arat Wirziburgensis episcopus\" to campaign against the Slavs, during the course of which the bishop was killed in 892 . Regino specifies that his dukedom was given to \"Chuonrado\" and soon after to \"Burchardo comitis\" . Graf in der bayerischen Nordgau 903. Graf im Volkfeld 906. \"Hludouuicus rex\" confirmed a donation of property \"in pago Folcfelda in comitatu Popponis\" to Kloster Fulda by charter dated [29 Jun 906] .\n\n- FRANCONIAN NOBILITY.\n\nKONRAD, son of [UDO Graf im Lahngau [Konradiner] & his wife Judith [Welf] im Linzgau] ([845/60]-killed in battle near Fritzlar 27 Feb 906, bur Weilburg Martinskirche) . Regino names \"Chuonradus senior [et] frater eius Gebehardus\", specifying that Konrad resided in Hessen at Friedeslar . His birth date range estimated from other estimated birth date ranges of members of the family and the known dates of Konrad's own career. Regino specifies that the dukedom of \"Boppo dux Thuringorum\" was given to \"Chuonrado\" in 892 and soon after to \"Burchardo comitis\" .\n\nThe parentage of Burkhard has not been confirmed. Posse suggests that his presence in Grabfeld (see the 9 Jul 908 charter cited below) suggests a connection with an earlier Graf Burkhard who was recorded in two Fulda charters dated 27 Jun 857 and 23 Feb 866 , who appears to have been the brother of Christian [I] Graf in Grabfeld (see the document FRANCONIA, Family of Graf Christian).\n\n1. BURKHARD (-killed in battle Thuringia 3 Aug 908). Duke of Thuringia: Regino specifies that the dukedom of \"Boppo dux Thuringorum\" was given to \"Chuonrado\" in 892 and soon after to \"Burchardo comitis\" . Posse links Burkhards 892 appointment to die Sorbische Mark . \"Hludowicus rex\" confirmed privileges to Kloster St Gallen by charter dated 24 Jun 903 in which among \"fidelium nostrum\" was listed \"Purchart marchio Thuringionum\" . [The connection with Egino, with whom he was later killed (see below), suggests that Burkhard may have been comitum...Burchardi in the following document: \"Hludowicus rex\" donated property \"in pago Palanichoge in comitatu Egenonis in loco Ingilinstat\" to Hatto Archbishop of Mainz after consulting \"fidelium nostrorum comitum vero Burchardi, Egenonis et Ysaac\" by charter dated 8 Jun 908 .] Posse indicates that the following document relates to this Burkhard : King Ludwig IV granted possessions in pago Grabfelda, in comitatu sui senioris...in loco Vualahramesuuinda to Purchardi...comitis...Egregii (ducis) capellano Martinus by charter dated 9 Jul 908 . Duke of Thuringia: the Annales Alammanici record that \"Burchardus dux Turingorum et Rudolfus episcopus Eginoque\" were killed by the Hungarians in Saxony in 908 . m ---. The name of Burkhard's wife is not known. Burkhard & his wife had two children (Wenck discussed their parentage ):\n\na) BURKHARD . Widukind names \"Burghardum quoque et Bardonem, quorum alter gener regis erat\", when recording the efforts of Henrici [the future Heinrich I King of Germany?] to expel them from Saxonia vel Thuringorum terra [dated to [913]?] . Burchardus comes donated property to Bonn St Cassius, for the souls of meæ...parentumque meorum atque...fratris mei Kunradi Francorum...regis, at the request of Waldolfi prepositi, by charter dated to [911/18] . m ---[in der Wetterau], daughter of KONRAD Graf in der Wetterau [Konradiner] & his wife Glismod ---. Her family connection and marriage are indicated by Widukind, as indicated above. It is also indicated by her husbands [911/18] donation cited above. Posse indicates that Burkhard was the father of Dedi (-14 Mar 957) .\n\nb) BARDO . Widukind names \"Burghardum quoque et Bardonem, quorum alter gener regis erat\", when recording the efforts of Henrici [the future Heinrich I King of Germany?] to expel them from Saxonia vel Thuringorum terra [dated to [913]?] .\n\nChapter 2. LANDGRAFEN of THURINGIA [1123]-1247\n\nA. ORIGINS\n\n1. HAMZO . The Annalista Saxo names \"in Halberstad vero Hamezonem eiusdem eclesie canonicum, avunculum Lodowici comitis de Thuringia\" . If avunculus is used in its strict meaning in this text, this indicates that Ludwig was the son of Hamzo's sister. Canon in Halberstadt.\n\n2. [sister . m ---.] Two children:\n\na) LUDWIG \"Cum-barba\" (-[1080], bur Mainz St Alban) . The Cronica Reinhardsbrunnensis names \"Hugonem comitem et Ludwicum dictum Cum-barba fratrem suum\" as \"duos consanguineos\" of Gisela, wife of Emperor Konrad II, specifying that they were \"ex Francia oriundi Cis Renum de stirpe regum Francorum Karoli et Ludewici\" . The precise nature of these relationships, assuming that the Cronica (not generally reliable) is accurate in its statements, is not known. Jean-Noël Mathieu suggests that the relationship was through the family of the kings of Burgundy, descended from Willa, wife of King Rudolf I, although he does not propose a precise connection . There appear to be too many unknown factors in positing the Carolingian ancestry of the Burgundian kings to be able to consider that such a possibility is other than highly speculative. Graf in Thuringia.\n\n- see below.\n\nb) HUGO . The Historia Brevis Principum Thuringiæ names \"Hugo comes\" as brother of \"Ludewicus Cum-barba\" . m ---. The name of Hugo's wife is not known. The charter dated 10 Aug 1109 under which Reinhard Bishop of Halberstadt and \"dominus Milo comes\" donated property to Kloster Hillersleben which names as present \"Wichmannus comes de Thuringia nepos meus\" shows that she was presumably the sister of Bishop Reinhard. Hugo & his wife had one child:\n\ni) WICHMANN . The Historia Brevis Principum Thuringiæ names \"Wicmannus\" as son of \"Hugo comes\", specifying that when he died his uncle \"Ludewicus Cum-barba\" was his heir . Reinhard Bishop of Halberstadt and \"dominus Milo comes\" donated property to Kloster Hillersleben by charter dated 10 Aug 1109 with the consent of \"uxoris sue Ludburga\", named as present \"Wichmannus comes de Thuringia nepos meus\" .\n\nLUDWIG \"Cum-barba\", son of --- (-[1080], bur Mainz St Alban) . Graf in Thuringia. The Cronica Reinhardsbrunnensis records that \"Ludwicum dictum Cum-barba\" came to Thuringia in 1034 and settled \"in confinio silve que Loybe dicitur inter montem Katherberg et Aldinberg et Corneberg\" . The Cronica Reinhardsbrunnensis also quotes in full an alleged grant by \"Chuonradus Romanorum imperator augustus\" to \"Lodewico comiti consanguineus nostris\" dated 27 Apr 1039 which is headed \"Privilegium comitis Thuringie\" . In the Monumenta Germaniæ Historica compilation of imperial diplomas, this deed is classified as forged, the introduction stating that it was one of the Reinhardsbrunn forgeries of the second half of the 12th century . The Historia Brevis Principum Thuringiæ records that \"Ludewicus Cum-barba\" was buried \"Maguntie apud Sanctum Albanum\" .\n\nm CÄCILIE von Sangerhausen, daughter of ---. The Historia Brevis Principum Thuringiæ names \"Ceciliam de Sangirhusen\" as the wife of \"Ludewicus Cum-barba\" .\n\nGraf Ludwig & his wife had five children:\n\n1. LUDWIG \"der Salier/der Springer\" (-Reinhardsbrunn 1123) . The Historia Brevis Principum Thuringiæ names \"Ludewicum et Berengerum\" as the two sons of \"Ludewicus Cum-barba\" & his wife, specifying that Ludwig founded Reinhardsbrunn . The Cronica Reinhardsbrunnensis records that \"Ludevico comitis\" was detained in Gebechenstein in 1074, it appearing from the context that this refers to the son of Ludwig \"Cum-barba\" . Graf in Thuringia. The Cronica Reinhardsbrunnensis records that \"Ludevico comitis\" founded Reinhardsbrunn in 1085 . Two charters, dated 11 Apr [1102/04] and [1104/09], under which Pope Paschal II confirmed the privileges of Kloster Reinhardsbrunn state that the monastery was built by \"Liudowicus comes\" . A charter dated 10 Apr 1139 under which Pope Innocent II confirmed the privileges of Kloster Reinhardsbrunn also states that the monastery had been built by \"Ludewico comite\" . Comes Ludowicus cum nepote suo Conrado comitis...Berngeri filio...cum uxore eiusdem domini Ludowici Adilheida ac filiis eorundem Hermanno, Ludowico, Heinrico, Conrado, dominaque Berchtrada comitis Conradi matre donated ecclesiam...Sangershusen to Reinhardsbrunn by charter dated 25 Jul 1110 . \"Ludowicus de Turingia comes, Arnoldus urbis comes, Sigehardus comes, Bertolfus comes, Ludewicus comes, Gozwinus comes \" witnessed the charter dated 20 Jun 1118 under which Adalbert Archbishop of Mainz donated property \"in placito Ludwici comitis\" to Kloster St Johannes auf dem Bischofsberge, after the death of \"Hildrudis vidue Wulferici ministerialis nostri\" . The Chronicon Gozecense records the death of \"senior Ludewicus apud Reinheresbrunnen\" and his burial \"in basilica beatæ Dei genetricis\" . [m firstly (repudiated) --- of Saxony, daughter of UDALRICH ---. The Cronica Reinhardsbrunnensis records the first marriage of Ludwig and \"filiam ducis Saxonie Udalrici\" whom he repudiated . It is possible that this results from confusion with the marriage of Ludwig's eldest daughter with Marchese Ulrich from the family of the Grafen von Weimar (see below). However, the 1087 date of Ludwig's known marriage to Adelheid von Stade appears late considering the dates attributed to the career of Ludwig's father which would suggest that Ludwig may have been born in the range [1045/55]. It is not impossible therefore that there was an earlier marriage. It is unlikely, however, that Ludwig's first father-in-law was named \"Udalrich\" or \"Ulrich\" if the proposed Saxon origin is correct. There are no known cases of the use of this name among the Saxon nobility before Ulrich [I] Graf von Weimar, Marchese of Carniola. The origin of his name cannot be traced, presumably having been introduced into his family either through his paternal grandmother or his great grandmother, neither of whom have been identified with certainty. The name is more common among the earlier Bavarian and Swabian nobility.] m [secondly] (1087) as her second husband, ADELHEID von Stade, widow of FRIEDRICH [III] von Goseck, daughter of LOTHAR UDO II Graf von Stade Markgraf der Nordmark & his wife Oda von Werl (-8 Oct or 14 Nov 1110, bur Reinhardsbrunn).

The earlier Bishop Udo was the brother of Ludwig I Landgraf of Thuringia. Their fathers marriage is dated to 1087 (see above).

She embraced a regime of extreme fasting, dressed in a grey penitential tunic supposedly sent to her by St Francis of Assisi. Konrad von Marburg built a finger-shaped church around her grave in her hospital chapel.

Spalatinus ([1510]) records the birth 1468 Misenæ...proximo die post Petri et Pauli of his father and the birth on the same day in 1503 of filius eius Johannes Fridericus Dux ex priori conjuge Sophia Megapolitana...Torgaviæ . An early supporter of the Reformation, he negotiated with the Emperor and other German states as his father's representative. He succeeded his father in 1532 as JOHANN FRIEDRICH I \"der Grossmütige\" Elector of Saxony, and joint Herzog von Sachsen, jointly with his brother (until 1542 when he ceded Coburg to his brother). He continued in his father's footsteps in imposing the Reformation, carrying out the Second Visitation 1533/35, and organising the disbanding and sale of the monasteries. He founded an academic institution, specialising in theology, at Jena, raised to the status of university by Emperor Ferdinand III in 1557. He imposed his religious beliefs with stubbornness, contrasting with his own passion for eating, drinking and hunting. Military conflict with the Emperor was inevitable with Johann Friedrich's increasing use of the \"Schmalkaldischen Bundes\" to consolidate Protestantism in Saxony and Hessen. He was defeated at Mühlberg 24 Apr 1547 and imprisoned. Under the Capitulation of Wittenberg 19 May 1547, the Emperor deprived him of the electorate of Saxony which he awarded to his cousin Moritz along with two thirds of the territories of the Ernestine branch. Johann Friedrich was freed 19 May 1552, but still refused to give up the electoral title and arms, seeing himself as a Protestant martyr.
