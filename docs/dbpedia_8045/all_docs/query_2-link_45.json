        "text": "The 1600s proved to be a century of political upheaval and change in England  change from autocratic to parliamentary monarchy. As the century opened Britain was ruled by a highly autocratic monarch who would have nothing to do with the young and aspiring parliament. The showdown came with the trial by parliament and subsequent execution of King Charles I in 1649. This was followed by an attempt at a republic under Cromwell  which proved to be chaotic and disastrous. The restored monarchs  Charles II and James II  were still somewhat reluctant to accept the supremacy of parliament, until parliament itself called upon James's daughter Mary and her Dutch husband William of Orange to rescue the country from its political instability. This they did in 1689, reigning jointly thereafter as William III and Mary. This brief history will explain why, after the cultural vacuum and chaos of the revolution, the republic and its ensuing years, music would once again flourish as the century drew to a close.\n\nHenry Purcell was born in 1659, and though he was to live a very short life (he died in 1695) he was able to enjoy and make full use of the renewed flowering of music.\n\nHe devoted much his talent to writing operas, or rather musical dramas, and incidental stage music; but he would also write chamber music in the form of harpsichord suites and trio sonatas, and became involved with the growing London public concert scene.\n\nFor a young London Musical Society he produced Odes to celebrate Saint Cecilia's day (the Patron Saint of Music)  which any musiclover so desirous may celebrate on November 22nd.\n\nAs the son of a musician at court, a chorister at the Chapel Royal, and the holder of continuing royal appointments until his death, Purcell worked exclusively in Westminster for three different Kings over twentyfive years, and facts about Purcell's activities at court are fairly well documented.\n\nAmong other works written for the Court, he produced Odes for royal birthdays, among which is the lively and tuneful \"Come ye Sons of Art\".\n\nThe death of Queen Mary was a devastating blow which deeply affected the country. Mary had been a muchloved monarch and the public demanded a funeral which reflected its devotion.\n\nNo expense was spared. Sir Christopher Wren had ensured that the route to Westminster was lined with black railings. Three hundred somber women led the entourage dressed in black capes with boys carrying their trains.\n\nPurcell was also called upon to provide an ode for the death of his (and the country's) beloved Queen Mary. How perfectly the occasion leant itself to Purcell's evocative and bittersweet music.\n\nIn November of that same year Westminster Abbey would also be the setting for Purcell's own funeral, at which the combined choirs of the Abbey and the Chapel Royal would commemorate the premature passing of 'the English Orpheus'.\n\nDuring the last decades of the 1600s England had learned much about Italian and French musical styles from Purcell and would enter the new century warmly receptive to continental fashions.\n\nEnglish musical life during the first half of the 1700s was dominated by the giant figure of Handel, who had settled in London in 1712; here once again, royalty had played its influential part.\n\nFollowing his early studies in Germany, Handel went to Italy where he spent more than three years, in Florence, Rome, Naples and Venice. In Rome he studied with Corelli, and may also have met Vivaldi in Venice on his return.\n\nHandel left Italy early in 1710 and went to Hanover, where he was appointed Capellmeister to the Elector, George Louis. The Royal Houses of Britain and Europe had always been closely interrelated, and the Act of Settlement of 1701 which secured the Protestant succession to the Crown, made George's mother heiresspresumptive to the throne of Great Britain. In 1705 George had already been naturalized by Act of Parliament, and in August 1714 the death of Queen Anne made him King. Handel, who had already visited London and apparently found it to his liking, was to follow the Elector in adopting British nationality, and indeed part of Handel's success in London was due to the royal patronage of the Elector of Hanover, now King George I.\n\nHandel's influence both upon the cultural milieu of his day and upon his younger English contemporaries can hardly be overstated. It was the beginning of the age of the \"Grand Tour,\" when educated and wealthy citizens embarked on the \"Grand Tour' to Italy, France, Germany and The Netherlands. As often as not they returned home full of enthusiasm for the academies, theatres, opera houses and concert life which they had encountered in Europe. England, in short, became a welcoming host to foreign virtuosos, impresarios, singers and composers. As the Hamburg theorist, critic and composer Johann Mattheson noted in 1713 (Das NeuEröffnete Orchester): \"He who in the present time wants to make a profit out of music betakes himself to England.\"\n\nIn England, as to begin with in Germany, the chief model for instrumental music was Corelli, whose compositions first became known in London towards the end of the seventeenth century. In 1715 John Walsh senior  he and his son were soon to become Handel's publishers  issued Corelli's 12 Concerti Grossi Op. 6, from which time they were performed, adapted, and from all accounts, universally loved. The English music historian Sir John Hawkins mentions an occasion in 1724 when an enthusiastic group of amateurs, having just acquired Corelli's Op. 6 from a bookseller, \"played the whole 12 concertos through, without rising from their seats\" (History of the Science and Practice of Music, 1776). Concertos by Corelli's contemporary, Torelli, and the uptodate fashionable Venetian concertos by Vivaldi were also published and became popular in England.\n\nAmong the very first composers to have concertos printed in England was Francesco Geminiani. Geminiani was born in Lucca and studied the violin under Corelli in Rome. It is also possible that he studied composition with Alessandro Scarlatti in Naples. In 1707 Geminiani returned to his native town of Lucca, where he played in the town orchestra for three years before taking up a position in Naples in 1711 as leader of the opera orchestra. In 1714 he came to England where his playing quickly gained him the support of leading figures at court and among the aristocracy.\n\nBecause Dublin was a capital city, a state orchestra was maintained, based in Dublin Castle. It provided music for state occasions and the musicians would find employment in the various concert halls and theatres and sometimes the churches and cathedrals in the city.\n\nHandel visited Dublin and spent time there in 1741/42, a visit which culminated in the first performance of Messiah on 13 April 1742.\n\nGeminiani left London for Dublin in 1733 where he built up a fine reputation as a teacher, performer, concert promoter and theorist. In that year he opened a Concert Room in Dublin, apparently using the upstairs premises for music and the rooms below for trading in pictures."
