        "text": "The banking sector has played a crucial role in Kenya's economic development. Banking institutions have been fundamental in shaping Kenya’s economy and improving the well-being of millions of Kenyans since before the country’s independence on December 12, 1963. Let us take a deep dive into the evolution of banking in Kenya.\n\nEast Africa Protectorate\n\nIt starts in the late 19th century with European trade on the East African coast.\n\nIn 1887, Sir William Mackinnon established the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC), which captured the interest of the National Bank of India (NBI). NBI entered an agreement with Smith, Mackenzie & Co. to act as its banking agent on the East African coast.\n\nIn 1890, Britain declared a protectorate over Zanzibar, and in 1893, NBI set up an office in Zanzibar, marking its foray into East Africa. Initially, NBI's fortunes were tied to IBEAC, which had its own flag, currency, and even a private army.\n\nIBEAC attempted to build a railway from Mombasa to Lake Victoria but ran out of money and labor, leading to its dissolution in 1895. It was replaced by the East Africa Protectorate (EAP), which was more controlled by the British. In 1896, NBI established its first branch in Mombasa, coinciding with the construction of the Mombasa-Kisumu railway. The National Bank of India was appointed the official banker for the venture, marking the beginning of the bank’s long and profitable relationship with what later became the colonial government of Kenya.\n\nPre-independence & Africanization\n\nThe roots of banking in Kenya stretch back to the late 19th century, intertwined with the expansion of European trade along the East African coast, particularly in Zanzibar. In 1887, Sir William Mackinnon founded the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEAC) with backing from the British Foreign Office. This pivotal move established a formal commercial presence in the region, setting the stage for the introduction of structured banking services.\n\nThe establishment of IBEAC quickly drew the attention of the National Bank of India (NBI), which entered into an agreement with Smith, Mackenzie & Co., the East African representatives of the merchant company. This partnership enabled NBI to serve as the banking agent on the East African coast, marking the beginning of organized banking in the region. As trade flourished, the need for reliable financial services became increasingly apparent. The strategic alliance between NBI and Smith, Mackenzie & Co. facilitated the provision of banking services essential for managing the flow of goods and capital. This early collaboration laid the groundwork for the development of a more formalized banking system that would evolve significantly in the years leading up to Kenya's independence.\n\nInitially, banking services were a preserve of Europeans and Asians, with Africans having limited access. This began to change in 1910 when the Post Office Savings Bank was established, offering services to Africans, though primarily in urban areas where colonial postal officials were stationed. By March 1911, the bank had 1,231 accounts, with 684 belonging to Africans, indicating a slow but significant start in financial inclusion.\n\nDespite these early steps, it took decades to significantly Africanize the banking industry. The turning point came in June 1963, just months before Kenya's independence, when Peter Nyakiamo became the first African manager of a bank branch at Barclays after 15 years of service. This milestone marked the beginning of greater African involvement in banking.\n\nBefore these developments, trade in East Africa relied on barter and traditional currency systems like cowrie shells and beads. The introduction of formal currency began with the Maria Theresa Thaler (MTT) in the early 19th century, followed by the Indian rupee with the rise of British trade. In 1920, the East African Currency Board introduced the florin, which was replaced by the East African shilling in 1922, becoming the standard currency by the time of Kenya's independence.\n\nThe pre-independence era established foundational financial services that facilitated trade and economic growth. The early involvement of the National Bank of India and the strategic partnerships formed during this period were instrumental in shaping the trajectory of Kenya's banking sector, leading to the robust and diverse industry that exists today. This transition to formal banking and currency systems was crucial in setting the stage for an inclusive and modern banking sector in Kenya.\n\nExpansion\n\nThe early 20th century marked a significant period of expansion for Kenya's banking sector.\n\nIn 1900, the National Bank of India (NBI) secured land in Treasury Square, Mombasa, to construct its building, signaling its growing business. The arrival of the railway in Kisumu in 1901 further spurred economic activities, particularly in Nairobi, which was established in 1899 as a railway camp.\n\nBy 1904, NBI opened its first inland branch in Nairobi. The burgeoning economy attracted more banks, prompting the government to enact the first Banking Ordinance in 1910 for regulatory oversight. Notably, the Standard Bank of South Africa opened branches in Mombasa and Nairobi in 1911, followed by the National Bank of South Africa in 1916.\n\nKenya’s change in status to a British colony in 1920 further accelerated bank growth, with Barclays Bank DCO emerging from a merger in 1925. Despite World War II and the Mau Mau uprising, the banking sector flourished, with Barclays Bank staff increasing substantially from 283 in 1945 to 1,163 in 1960. This era also saw the entry of several new banks, including the Algemene Bank Nederland in 1951, Bank of Baroda in 1953, Habib Bank in 1956, and both Ottoman Bank and Commercial Bank of Africa in 1958. The National Bank of India evolved into National and Grindlays Bank in 1958, expanding its footprint across key Kenyan towns. By 1951, these banks had an extensive branch network, solidifying their presence in the region.\n\nThis period of growth established the groundwork for Kenya's contemporary banking industry, promoting financial inclusion and aiding the nation's economic progress.\n\nRegulation\n\nThe establishment of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) in 1966 marked a significant milestone in the regulation and stabilization of the country's financial sector. Shortly after Kenya gained independence, the CBK began issuing the first Kenyan currency notes and coins, which started circulating in 1966 and 1967, respectively. These initial coins were in denominations of 1 and 2 shillings and 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents. The introduction of a centralized monetary authority was critical for creating a cohesive banking system in Kenya.\n\nThe first governor of the CBK, Dr. Leon Baranski (who was seconded by the IMF) was instrumental in setting up the regulatory framework for the country's banking operations. He was succeeded in 1967 by Duncan Ndegwa, a significant figure in Kenya's public service, who took CBK through its early challenges.\n\nOne of the first major hurdles came when Tanzania nationalized all commercial banks and imposed exchange control restrictions, disrupting the remittance of funds and financial transactions between Kenya and Tanzania. The CBK responded by establishing emergency measures to facilitate these transactions.\n\nAnother challenge emerged in 1968 during an international gold crisis, which led to the devaluation of the British sterling pound, thus affecting the Kenya shilling. The CBK had to temporarily suspend foreign exchange dealings to stabilize the currency. These early regulatory efforts by the CBK were crucial in maintaining financial stability and fostering trust in Kenya's nascent banking system. This is what laid the foundation for future growth and development in the sector.\n\nIndigenous Banks\n\nThe story of Kenya's indigenous banks begins with a resolve to reduce dependency on foreign-owned banks and promote local ownership in the banking sector which was a vision driven by the new government of an independent Kenya.\n\nThis vision materialized on June 19, 1965, when the Co-operative Bank of Kenya was registered as a co-operative society, initially aimed at serving the growing farming community. Official operations as a bank began on January 10, 1968, with a modest start-up capital of KShs 255,000, supplemented by an interest-free loan of KShs 214,000 from the government, repayable over ten years.\n\nCo-op Bank’s first board of directors included notable figures such as B. Kathanga (chairman), Charles Rubia (vice-chairman), and others, all of whom played pivotal roles in steering the bank's initial direction.\n\nIn its early years, Co-op Bank exclusively served farmers through the co-operative movement, restricting individual accounts, and lacked its own nationwide branch network. Instead, it relied on major commercial banks as agents across the country.\n\nFast forward to today, Co-operative Bank of Kenya 's evolution to one of the largest and leading banks is nothing short of remarkable. From its humble beginnings, it has grown to become the fourth-largest co-operative bank in the world, trailing only behind Rabobank in the Netherlands, Co-operative Bank in Britain, and Credit Agricole in France.\n\nGovernment-owned Banks\n\nThe journey of government-owned banks in Kenya began with the establishment of the National Bank of Kenya (NBK) on June 19, 1968. John Michuki, then Treasury permanent secretary, was appointed as the chairman of its board of directors, joined by Eliud Matu Wamae, Patrick Mwangola, and Kipkurui Cherono. NBK’s establishment was a significant milestone, marking the government's commitment to creating a robust banking sector to support national development. Two years later, Michuki transitioned to become the executive chairman of the newly formed Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), with Stanley Githunguri taking over at NBK.\n\nThe history of KCB dates back to 1896 when it was founded as the National Bank of India (NBI) in Mombasa. In 1958, NBI merged with Grindlays Bank to form the National and Grindlays Bank. Following Kenya's independence, the government sought to increase local participation in the banking sector. This led to the acquisition of a majority stake in the National and Grindlays Bank, which was then renamed Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) in 1970. The rebranding marked the beginning of KCB’s journey as a significant player in Kenya's banking sector, expanding its operations and services to cater to the needs of a growing economy.\n\nKCB Bank Group was created after the government acquired a 60% stake in the National and Grindlays Bank, subsequently splitting it into two entities: Kenya Commercial Bank and Grindlays Bank International (Kenya). KCB quickly expanded, taking over all but two of the branches previously operated by National and Grindlays Bank. The bank's rapid growth was driven by its increased capital and broader branch network, enabling it to outpace both NBK and Co-operative Bank (Co-op Bank).\n\nOn August 25, 1971, KCB incorporated a subsidiary titled Kenya Commercial Finance Company, and the following year acquired Savings and Loan (S&L) Ltd. These acquisitions allowed KCB to offer services such as mortgage finance, which were not permitted for commercial banks at the time. Other banks soon followed KCB’s example, establishing subsidiaries to expand their range of financial services.\n\nIn November 1976, the government took full ownership of KCB by purchasing the remaining 40% stake from Grindlays Bank of London. This move solidified KCB’s position as a cornerstone of Kenya’s banking sector, offering affordable banking services to a broader population. The establishment and expansion of government-owned banks had a profound impact, which in return compelled foreign-owned banks to innovate and remain competitive in the Kenyan market.\n\nThrough fostering economic growth and inclusivity, the formation of these banks accelerated the provision of financial services to the general population. The strategic establishment of government-owned banks like NBK and KCB laid the foundation for a more accessible and diversified banking sector, integral to Kenya’s economic development.\n\nTechnology\n\nIn the early days, the National Bank of India relied on rudimentary manual weighing scales shipped from London and enormous volumes of books for keeping accounts and legal documents. Transactions were meticulously recorded in passbooks by clerks, and large cash withdrawals required advance notice, sometimes up to three weeks. Cheques, mainly used by companies and wealthy individuals, took over a month to clear in the 1950s. Although this improved to 21 days by the 1980s, it now takes just two days to clear.\n\nThe real technological transformation began in the late 1960s when major banks started investing in computers. National and Grindlays Bank led the charge in 1968 with a 16K 1901 ICL mainframe computer, later supplemented by another in 1971. By 1972, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) had established its own systems division and adopted the Key-Edit computer system in 1975. Barclays Bank of Kenya became the first fully computerized bank in 1982, significantly improving efficiency and service delivery.\n\nIn 1989, Standard Chartered introduced debit cards and ATMs. Soon, other banks like Barclays, KCB, and Co-op followed suit. By the early 2000s, customers could access services from any branch of their bank, and ATMs offered a range of services beyond cash withdrawal. The PesaPoint network allowed inter-bank ATM transactions, expanding customer convenience.\n\nAn important landmark was achieved when Co-op Bank introduced mobile banking in 2004, initially for balance checking and statement requests. This was further revolutionized by Safaricom's launch of M-Pesa in 2007, which transformed money transfer and financial inclusion. M-Pesa's success has been profound, especially after being integrated with banks for seamless mobile banking services.\n\nInternet banking further enhanced accessibility, allowing customers to manage accounts from their homes or offices. This has been facilitated by partnerships with local tech firms specializing in e-payments. By 2012, internet banking had significantly boosted remittances from Kenyans abroad, averaging $100 million monthly.\n\nThroughout this journey, technology has been a crucial enabler for the banking sector, driving efficiency and broadening access. However, its true impact depends on well-trained staff who understand both the technology and the nuances of the banking industry, ensuring that innovations translate into tangible benefits for customers.\n\nInterest Controls\n\nIn August 2016, Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta signed the Banking (Amendment) Bill 2015 into law, a move initiated by Kiambu Member of Parliament, Hon. Jude Njomo. This legislation, known as the Banking (Amendment) Act 2016, capped interest rates at a maximum of 4 percent above the Central Bank’s Base Rate (CBR) for any credit facility in Kenya. Additionally, it set a ceiling of 70 percent on the interest paid on deposits in interest-earning accounts, relative to the base rate. The enactment of this bill was driven by widespread concerns over sky-high interest rates charged by banks, which were seen as stifling economic growth and burdening borrowers.\n\nDespite the good intentions, the law faced significant opposition from key financial stakeholders, including the Kenya Bankers Association, the Central Bank, and international bodies like the International Monetary Fund. Critics argued that capping interest rates would hinder risk-based pricing, leading to reduced access to credit, particularly for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), and potentially giving rise to unregulated and exploitative lending practices. These concerns were not new; similar efforts had been made in the past, notably by Hon. Joe Donde in the mid-1990s and through the in-duplum rule introduced by Finance Minister David Mwiraria in 2004.\n\nAs the economic challenges resulting from the legislation became apparent, in 2019, President Kenyatta recommended its repeal. He declined to assent to the Finance Bill 2019 and sent it back to Parliament with a memorandum detailing his objections to the interest rate caps. On November 5, 2019, the Parliament failed to secure the two-thirds majority needed to override the President's veto, which led to the repeal of the interest rate controls when President Kenyatta signed the bill on November 8, 2019.\n\nFollowing the repeal, Kenya’s banking industry pivoted towards developing innovative solutions to enhance credit access for MSMEs. One notable initiative was the Inuka Enterprise Capacity Building Program launched by the Kenya Bankers Association in 2018. This program aimed to de-risk businesses and make them more bankable. By the end of 2020, Inuka Enterprise had reached over 10,000 SMEs, demonstrating a commitment to supporting small businesses and fostering economic growth despite the challenges posed by interest rate capping.\n\nThe journey of interest rate controls in Kenya highlights the complexities of balancing consumer protection with economic stability. While the caps were initially intended to shield borrowers from high interest rates, their unintended consequences led to a significant policy shift, underscoring the importance of a flexible and adaptive regulatory framework in the financial sector.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nIn December 2019, the world received reports of a mysterious disease spreading in Wuhan, China. By February 2020, COVID-19 had traversed borders, reaching various countries worldwide. Kenya confirmed its first case on March 12, 2020, leading the government to implement stringent containment measures, including lockdowns and travel restrictions, to curb the virus's spread. This unprecedented situation ushered the banking industry, along with all other economic sectors, into a new and challenging business environment.\n\nBefore the pandemic's onset, Kenya's banking sector was optimistic following the repeal of interest rate capping in November 2019, which promised increased lending to previously under-served sectors. The initial months of 2020 saw the economy growing robustly at over 5 percent. Banks were poised to implement innovative strategies to support business recovery, particularly among SMEs. However, the advent of COVID-19 in March shifted the focus towards sustaining livelihoods and ensuring business continuity amidst a global health crisis.\n\nAs the pandemic evolved, it became clear that even resilient sectors like tourism, hospitality, and education needed support. The banking industry quickly adapted the use of digital banking platforms to minimize physical interactions. The government established the National COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund, raising Ksh 1.7 billion from the banking sector by the end of 2020, which provided critical support to hospitals and healthcare workers.\n\nThe Central Bank of Kenya played a pivotal role in introducing fiscal interventions to cushion the economic blow. Key measures included reducing the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) from 5.25 percent to 4.25 percent, freeing up liquidity. Bank employees were front-line heroes through renegotiating loan contracts and helping businesses navigate the financial storm. Despite rising non-performing loans, banks restructured loans worth Ksh 1.63 trillion, or 54.2 percent of total loan portfolios, demonstrating their commitment to customers.\n\nThe pandemic underscored the banking sector's vital role in bridging policy and regulation with the needs of the public. Banks collaborated with regulators to zero-rate several charges, promoting digital transactions, and aiding struggling businesses.\n\nAlthough profitability decreased with pre-tax profits of sampled banks dropping by 30 percent in 2020, the sector remained resilient.\n\nPost-COVID-19, the banking industry continues to adapt, supporting affected customers and developing innovative solutions like blended finance and the moveable assets registry to improve credit access.\n\nStakeholders are also working to operationalize risk-based pricing, further promoting credit access and ensuring the sector's stability. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical role of banks in sustaining economic stability and supporting recovery efforts, showcasing their resilience and adaptability in the face of unprecedented challenges.\n\nCapacity Building\n\nIn the pre-independence era, the banking sector in Kenya was dominated by European and Asian staff, with Africans relegated to low and junior positions.\n\nBarclays DCO took a pioneering step in the early 1950s by establishing the first local training school in Nairobi, aimed at building a competent local workforce to support its expanding operations. This initiative led to rapid growth, including the opening of Barclays’ 100th branch in Mandera in 1968. Other banks followed suit, with Standard Bank of South Africa opening a training college in 1958 and Bank of India and Bank of Baroda establishing a joint training school in 1969. Co-op Bank and KCB also set up their training institutions.\n\nThe establishment of the Kenya College of Accountancy in 1989 further supplemented banking education, contributing significantly to the industry by producing well-trained professionals. Despite these efforts, training enough Africans, and especially women, to take over the banking industry was a gradual process. It wasn’t until after independence that African women began to take on roles within the banks, primarily in junior positions initially.\n\nThe 1994 establishment of the Kenya School of Monetary Studies improved cooperation between the Central Bank and commercial banks by helping train personnel and equipping them with better skills and capabilities within the sector.\n\nDiversity\n\nDr. Mary Okelo became the first African woman bank branch manager at Barclays Bank in 1977. This promotion opened doors for more women to rise to management positions. She later became the director of the African Development Bank and senior advisor to the bank’s president in 1987. Barclays continued to promote a significant number of women as staff members. Mrs. Agatha Obare became the first female employee of a Kenyan bank to attain the position of supervisor in 1972.\n\nToday, some notable women who have risen to high positions in banking include:\n\n1. Nasim Devji , the Chief Executive Officer of the Diamond Trust Bank group, and the first woman appointed CEO of a bank in Kenya.\n\n2. Anne Mutahi, chairperson of Standard Chartered Bank (Kenya).\n\n3. Nyambura Koigi, Managing Director of Postbank.\n\n4. Vindhya Vittal Ramesh, CEO of Bank of Baroda (Kenya).\n\n5. Jacinta Mwatela, a former deputy governor of the Central Bank.\n\n6. Rose Detho, Director of the Central Bank’s Deposit Protection Fund.\n\n7. Nuru Mugambi, Director of Kenya Bankers Association.\n\n8. Sheila M’Mbijjiwe, a former director at StanChart and a member of the Central Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee.\n\nGender equality has not only been confined to employment policies but has also influenced services in several banks. For instance, the Bank of Baroda recently opened an all-women’s branch in Nyali, Mombasa, where the staff are primarily women, and the products are tailored to their women customers. Other banks that offer accounts designed for women include the now-defunct Chase Bank, Fina Bank, I&M, and Standard Chartered.\n\nToday, more women hold significant positions in the banking industry, contributing to its growth and development.\n\nTurbulent Growth\n\nThe growth of Kenya's banking sector from the late 1960s was characterized by notable changes and obstacles. In 1969, Standard Bank of South Africa merged with the Chartered Bank of India and China to form Standard Chartered Bank (StanChart), while Barclays rebranded to Barclays Bank International. Barclays was later locally incorporated as Barclays Bank of Kenya (BBK), becoming the first Kenyan bank to go public in 1986 with a positive response.\n\nFollowing President Kenyatta’s death in 1978 and President Moi’s succession, more African-owned banks emerged, including Ecobank and United Bank of Africa.\n\nHowever, political interference and under-capitalization led to the collapse of several banks between 1984 and 1989, prompting the government to pass the Banking Act of 1989. This Act tightened licensing requirements and established the Deposit Protection Fund Board to protect depositors. Despite a second and third wave of bank failures in the 1990s, indigenous banks like Equity Bank, Jamii Bora Bank, First Community Bank, and Gulf African Bank carved out niches by targeting lower-income and special customer segments, eventually achieving noteworthy success and market leadership.\n\nThis diversification of the banking landscape reflects the dynamic nature of the Kenyan economy and the growing sophistication of its financial sector.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe history of banks and banking in Kenya is a legacy of transformation and a testament to the country's resilience, adaptability, and forward-thinking spirit. From the colonial era's exclusive banking services for the European and Indian elite to the technology-driven financial ecosystem of today, Kenya's banking sector has undergone a remarkable evolution.\n\nAs the banking sector evolves, it remains pivotal to Kenya's economic growth, providing a variety of services to cater to the diverse needs of its people. The history of Kenya's banking industry is more than just financial transactions; it is a narrative of empowerment, innovation, and advancement, solidifying its role as a fundamental pillar of the nation's financial framework.\n\nToday, Kenya is on the brink of becoming a cashless society, with digital payments and mobile banking platforms like M-Pesa revolutionizing how financial transactions are conducted. This shift towards a cashless economy is expected to be fully realized by 2033, enhancing efficiency and security in financial dealings.\n\nMoreover, Kenyan banks are expanding their footprint beyond national borders, with significant investments in neighboring countries. Equity Bank's success in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) exemplifies this trend, contributing substantially to the bank's overall profitability and demonstrating the potential for regional growth.\n\nDiaspora remittances also play a vital role in Kenya's economic development. Inflows from Kenyans living abroad have become the largest source of foreign exchange, surpassing traditional sectors like tourism and agriculture. These remittances support household incomes, education, healthcare, and investment in local businesses, driving economic growth and financial inclusion."
