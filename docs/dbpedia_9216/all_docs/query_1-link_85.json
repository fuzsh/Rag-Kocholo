        "text": "Discover Tanzania’s official currency\n\nWhat’s the currency in Tanzania?\n\nThe official currency of Tanzania is the Tanzanian shilling.

Adopted as the official currency of the United Republic of Tanzania in 1966, it marked a new era in the nation’s economic journey. This transition from the East African shilling symbolised Tanzania’s move towards greater economic independence and self-identity.\n\nThe introduction of the Tanzanian shilling was not just a change in currency; it represented a profound shift in Tanzania’s economic policies and national identity. This change came at a crucial time, just a few years after Tanzania gained its independence in 1961. Establishing its own currency was a bold statement of sovereignty and a step away from its colonial past.\n\nBefore the Tanzanian shilling, the East African shilling circulated in the region, serving as the common currency for British East Africa. This included not just Tanzania, but also Kenya and Uganda. The East African Currency Board issued these shillings, which were a relic of British colonial rule. The move to the Tanzanian shilling thus severed the last economic ties to the colonial era.\n\nThe switch to the Tanzanian shilling in 1966 was more than a symbolic act. It allowed Tanzania to assert control over its monetary policy, crucial for shaping its economic future. The ability to manage its currency brought with it the power to influence inflation, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates—key levers in a growing economy.\n\nTanzanian banknotes and coins\n\nTanzanian banknotes and coins, issued by the Bank of Tanzania, reflect the nation’s culture and history. Current banknotes include denominations like 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 shillings, each depicting Tanzania’s landmarks and important figures.\n\nCoins in circulation include 50, 100, 200, and 500 Tanzanian shilling coins, each with unique designs featuring Tanzania’s wildlife and cultural symbols.\n\nUsing Tanzanian currency abroad\n\nThe Tanzanian shilling is primarily used within Tanzania and is not widely accepted elsewhere.\n\nOther Accepted Currencies in Tanzania\n\nWhile Tanzanian shillings are preferred, some places accept other currencies, especially in tourist areas and for large transactions.\n\nAccepted currencies include:\n\nUS dollars: Widely accepted in hotels and national parks. Ensure the notes are new and undamaged.\n\nBritish pounds (GBP): Accepted in major hotels and city banks, though less common than US Dollars.\n\nEuros: Similar to GBP, euros are accepted in larger hotels and banks.\n\nKenyan shillings: Useful near the Kenya-Tanzania border due to cross-border trade.\n\nCurrency in Tanzania: 5 Intriguing Facts\n\nRich imagery: Tanzanian banknotes feature diverse images showcasing the country’s heritage, including wildlife and landmarks.\n\nDual-language coins: Coins have inscriptions in both English and Swahili, one of Tanzania’s major languages.\n\nRebirth in 1987: The Tanzanian shilling was re-introduced in 1987 following economic reforms, replacing the old currency at a rate of 100 to 1.\n\nCurrency symbol: Represented by “TZS”, this symbol is used in international transactions.\n\nBank of Tanzania: Established in 1966, it’s responsible for issuing the Tanzanian shilling and maintaining its stability and value.\n\nTanzanian shilling Value\n\nThe Tanzanian shilling’s value can vary but is generally lower than the British pound. For the latest rates, check Manor FX.\n\nTanzanian Currency Symbol\n\nThe Tanzanian shilling’s symbol is “TZS”, commonly used in global financial transactions.\n\nFAQs"
