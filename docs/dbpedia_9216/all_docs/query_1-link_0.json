It is also the proposed name for a common currency that the East African Community plans to introduce.\n\nThe shilling was divided into 100 cents, and twenty shillings were 1 pound.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFirst East African shilling\n\n[edit]\n\nUnlike elsewhere in the possessions of the British Empire that used the sterling, in British East Africa the shilling instead of the pound was the primary unit of account, with the pound being a superunit mainly used for recording government and business transactions whose totals would be needlessly large if quoted solely in shillings.\n\nThis anomalous state of affairs arose because the first currency used by the British colonial authorities in British East Africa was the rupee, not sterling. The East African shilling was introduced to Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda in 1921, replacing the short-lived East African florin at a rate of 2 shillings to 1 florin. The florin had been introduced because of increasing silver prices after World War I. At that time, the Indian rupee was the currency of the British East African states. The rupee, being a silver coin, rose in value against sterling. When it reached the value of two shillings, the authorities decided to replace it with the florin. From the florin thence came the East African shilling. The currency remained pegged to one shilling sterling and was subdivided into 100 cents.[3][4][5] In 1936, Zanzibar joined the currency board, and the Zanzibari rupee was replaced at a rate of 1/50 to 1 Zanzibari rupee.[4] It was replaced by local currencies (Kenyan shilling, Ugandan shilling, and Tanzanian shilling) following the territories' independence.[3][4][5]\n\nIn 1951, the East African shilling replaced the Indian rupee in the Aden colony and protectorate, which became the South Arabian Federation in 1963. In 1965, the East African Currency Board was breaking up, and the South Arabian dinar replaced the shilling in the South Arabian Federation at a rate of 20 shillings to 1 dinar.[2][6]\n\nThe shilling was also used in parts of what is now Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea when they were under British control. Before 1941, these areas, then known as Italian East Africa, used the Italian East African lira. In 1941, as a result of World War II, Britain regained control and introduced the shilling, at a rate of 1 shilling to 24 Lire. Italian Somaliland was returned to Italy in 1949 as a UN Trusteeship and soon switched to the somalo, which was at par with the shilling. British Somaliland gained independence in 1960, and joined what had been Italian Somaliland to create Somalia. In that year, Somalia began using the Somali shilling (replacing the Somali somalo) at par with the East African shilling.[7]\n\nEthiopia regained independence in 1941, with British support, and began using the East African shilling. Maria Theresa thalers, Indian rupees, and Egyptian pounds were also legal tender at the beginning of this time, and it is unclear exactly when this status ended. Full sovereignty was restored in late 1944, and the Ethiopian dollar was reintroduced in 1945 at a rate of $1 = 2 shillings.[8] Eritrea was captured from the Italians in 1941, and began using the East African shilling, as well as the Egyptian pound. The lira was demonetised in 1942. When Eritrea formed a federation with Ethiopia in 1952, the dollar, which was already in use in Ethiopia, was also adopted in Eritrea.[9]\n\nSecond East African shilling\n\n[edit]\n\nIt has been rumoured that the East African Shilling will be revived by the East African Community, which consists of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Somalia, as part of the community's monetary union.[citation needed] The monetary union's target date has been set to 2031 following delays caused in part due to the Covid-19 Pandemic and the admission of new member states, including the DRC and Somalia.[10]\n\nCoins\n\n[edit]\n\nIssued during the reign of George V\n\n[edit]\n\nIssued during the reign of George V Image Value Catalogue number Technical parameters Description Dates Remarks Mass Composition Obverse Reverse [1] 1 cent KM 22 Bronze \"GEORGIVS V\", \"REX ET IND:IMP:\", crown, value \"EAST AFRICA\", value, date 1922-1935 central hole 5 cents KM 18 1921-1936 10 cents KM 19 [2] 50 cents\n\n1⁄2 shilling KM 20 3.8879g 25% silver \"GEORGIVS V\", \"REX ET IND:IMP:\", bust of George V Dual value, \"EAST AFRICA\", lion in front of mountain, date 1921-1924 [3] 1 shilling KM 21 7.7759g Value, \"EAST AFRICA\", lion in front of mountain, date 1921-1925 For table standards, see the coin specification table.\n\nIssued during the reign of Edward VIII\n\n[edit]\n\nIssued during the reign of Edward VIII Image Value Catalogue number Composition Description Dates Remarks Obverse Reverse [4] 5 cents KM 23 Bronze \"EDWARDVS VIII\", \"REX ET IND:IMP:\", crown, value \"EAST AFRICA\", value, date 1936 Central hole 10 cents KM 24 For table standards, see the coin specification table.\n\nIssued during the reign of George VI\n\n[edit]\n\nAs GEORGIVS VI\n\n[edit]\n\nIssued during the reign of George VI as GEORGIVS VI Image Value Catalogue number Technical parameters Description Dates Remarks Mass Composition Obverse Reverse 1 cent KM 29 Bronze \"GEORGIVS VI\", \"REX ET IND:IMP:\", crown, value \"EAST AFRICA\", value, date 1942 central hole 5 cents KM 25 1936 central hole KM 25.1 1937-1941 central hole, thick flan [5] KM 25.2 1941-1943 central hole, thin flan KM 25.3 1942 NO central hole, thin flan 10 cents KM 26.1 1937-1941 some with central hole, some without, thick flan KM 26.2 1942-1945 central hole, thin flan 50 cents\n\n1⁄2 shilling KM 27 3.8879g 25% silver \"GEORGIVS VI\", \"REX ET INDIÆ IMPERATOR\", bust of George VI Dual value, \"EAST AFRICA\", lion in front of mountain, date 1937-1944 1 shilling KM 28.1 7.7759g Value, \"EAST AFRICA\", lion in front of mountain, date 1937-1944 edge reeding spaced out KM 28.2 1941 rare, thicker rim, larger milling, minor design differences KM 28.3 1942-1943 retouched central image on reverse KM 28.4 1944-1946 same as KM 28.1 with edge reeding close For table standards, see the coin specification table.\n\nAs GEORGIVS SEXTVS\n\n[edit]\n\nIssued during the reign of George VI as GEORGIVS SEXTVS Image Value Catalogue number Composition Description Dates Remarks Obverse Reverse [6] 1 cent KM 32 Bronze \"GEORGIVS SEXTVS REX\", crown, value \"EAST AFRICA\", value, date 1949-1952 central hole [7] 5 cents KM 33 1949-1952 10 cents KM 34 1949-1952 [8] 50 cents\n\n1⁄2 shilling KM 30 Cupronickel \"GEORGIVS SEXTVS REX\", bust of George VI Dual value, \"EAST AFRICA\", lion in front of mountain, date 1948-1952 [9] 1 shilling KM 31 Value, \"EAST AFRICA\", lion in front of mountain, date 1948-1952 For table standards, see the coin specification table.\n\nIssued during the reign of Elizabeth II\n\n[edit]\n\nIssued during the reign of Elizabeth II Image Value Catalogue number Composition Description Dates Remarks Obverse Reverse [10] 1 cent KM 35 Bronze \"QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SECOND\", crown, value \"EAST AFRICA\", value, date 1954-1962 central hole [11] 5 cents KM 37 1955-1963 10 cents KM 38 1956-1964 [12] 50 cents\n\n1⁄2 shilling KM 36 Cupronickel \"QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SECOND\", bust of Elizabeth II Dual value, \"EAST AFRICA\", lion in front of mountain, year of minting 1954-1963 For table standards, see the coin specification table.\n\nIssued after independence\n\n[edit]\n\nIssued after independence Image Value Catalogue number Composition Description Dates Remarks Obverse Reverse [13] 5 cents KM 39 Bronze \"SENTI TANO\", 5, \"FIVE CENTS\", \"EAST AFRICA\" \"EAST AFRICA\", \"5\", date 1964 central hole [14][15] 10 cents KM 40 \"SENTI KUMI\", 10, \"TEN CENTS\", \"EAST AFRICA\" \"EAST AFRICA\", \"10\", date 1964 For table standards, see the coin specification table.\n\nBanknotes\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1921, notes were issued by the East African Currency Board in denominations of 5/-, 10/-, 20/-, 100/-, 200/-, 1,000/- and 10,000/-, with the notes of 20 shillings and above having their denominations expressed also in pounds (£1, £5, £10, £50 and £500).
