        "text": "The country has made significant political and economic reforms that have contributed to sustained economic growth, social development, and political stability gains over the past decade. However, its key development challenges still include poverty, inequality, youth unemployment, transparency and accountability, climate change, continued weak private sector investment, and the vulnerability of the economy to internal and external shocks. Furthermore, Kenya’s robust growth before the COVID-19 pandemic was largely driven by the public sector, resulting in debt vulnerabilities which have exacerbated amid tightening global financing conditions.\n\nKenya’s growth performance over the past two decades has been strong. The economy achieved broad-based growth, averaging 4.8% per year between 2015 and 2019, similar to the Lower Middle-Income Country average of 4.8 and above the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 2.4%.\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic shock hit the economy hard, disrupting international trade and transport, tourism, and urban services activity. Fortunately, the agricultural sector, a cornerstone of the economy, remained resilient, helping to limit the contraction in GDP to only 0.3%. The pandemic also reversed Kenya’s hard-earned gains in poverty reduction. In 2021, the economy staged a strong recovery, growing at 7.5%, although some sectors, such as tourism, remained under pressure.\n\nKenya’s economy continues to show considerable resilience in the face of recent shocks, including the lasting economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global impacts of the war in Ukraine, two consecutive years of droughts, tight monetary policy, and depreciation of the currency. Kenya’s real GDP expanded at an estimated 5.4% in 2023 from 4.8 % in 2022. The agricultural sector experienced a stronger than expected rebound after two years of drought. The onset of the rains led to improved crop yields and livestock health, which supported the resumption of a downward trajectory for poverty rates. The poverty rate ($2.15 international poverty rate) is projected to have declined from 35.8% in 2022 to 35.1% in 2023.\n\nKenya’s growth is projected to reach 5.2% on average during 2024-2026, mainly driven by the private sector as business confidence strengthens and the public sector continues to scale back. Kenya’s growth is also expected to benefit from the implementation of the recently signed trade agreements under the European Union Economic Partnership Agreement, African Continental Free Trade Area.\n\nAlthough the economic outlook is broadly positive, it is subject to elevated uncertainty. The failure to achieve fiscal consolidation targets could exacerbate Kenya’s debt vulnerabilities, especially due to the high-debt service repayments. Climate hazards could resume inflationary pressures and food insecurity, affecting growth. Lower than anticipated growth in developed countries could undercut ongoing recovery in tourism, exports, and remittances. Elevated commodity prices would further tighten financial conditions, weaken external balances, and impact inflation.\n\nWorld Bank support to Kenya includes budget support to help close the fiscal financing gap while supporting reforms that help advance the government’s inclusive growth agenda.\n\nIn addition to aligning the country’s long-term development agenda to Kenya’s Vision 2030−which aims to transform Kenya into a competitive and prosperous country with a high quality of life−the government’s bottom-up economic model prioritizes agriculture, healthcare, affordable housing, micro and small enterprises, and the digital and creative economy.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 08, 2024\n\nThe FY23-FY28 Country Partnership Framework (CPF), endorsed by the World Bank Group (WBG) Board of Executive Directors in November 2022, set out the strategy to support Kenya’s transformation into a middle-income economy that achieves inclusivity and resilience and builds on the WBG’s comparative advantages in Kenya. The CPF drew from the WBG’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY14-FY20 for Kenya, lessons from the CPS Completion and Learning Review (FY22), the FY20 Systematic Country Diagnostic, a Country Private Sector Diagnostic (FY19), over 34 stakeholder consultations, and is aligned to the Kenya Vision 2030. It also aligns directly with the World Bank’s Africa Strategy, focused on jobs and economic transformation, digital economy, human capital, universal access to electricity, climate change mitigation and adaptation, addressing fragility, conflict, and violence, and achieving gender equality.\n\nThe International Development Association (IDA) and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) portfolio stands at $7.81 billion in 38 projects: 27 national and 11 regional projects.\n\nTransport takes the largest share of investments at 16%, followed by water at 14%, Finance, Competitiveness & Innovation at 10%, while agriculture and energy and extractives are both at 9% each. Other investments are in education, environment, digital development, governance, health, nutrition and population, poverty and equity, social protection, social sustainability, and inclusion, and in urban.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) investment portfolio in Kenya totaled $1.16 billion across a number of key sectors, including manufacturing, agribusiness, financial services, infrastructure, and technology. IFC also has an advisory portfolio of $58 million. The advisory program complements IFC’s investments and is growing in key strategic areas such as healthcare, affordable housing, and financial inclusion. Support to small businesses is key to IFC’s work in Kenya and IFC has also been working with financial institutions to increase lending to small businesses and those focused on addressing climate change.\n\nAs of February 29, 2024, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) is actively engaged in Kenya with a total gross exposure of $417 million across the energy, financial, fintech, transport, and tourism/hospitality sectors. The seven existing projects include two legacy thermal power projects, two projects in the roads sector, capital optimization for a financial institution, a fintech mobile money project across 12 countries, including Kenya, and a hotel acquisition project. MIGA has also supported the regional development bank, Trade and Development Bank (TDB), of which Kenya is a member. MIGA’s support mobilized $747 million of commercial financing for TDB to expand its trade finance activities with clients in member countries, including support of COVID-19-related trade finance transactions.\n\nRecently approved projects\n\nThe Building Resilient and Responsive Health Systems Project ($200M), approved on March 13, 2024, aims to improve use and quality of primary healthcare services, and strengthen institutional capacity for service delivery.\n\nThe Kenya Green and Resilient Expansion of Energy (GREEN) Program Phase 2 Project ($202M), approved on December 26, 2023, will facilitate increased import of renewable energy and increased capacity of Kenya's system to absorb intermittent renewable energy.\n\nThe Kenya Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Program ($400M), approved on December 20, 2023, seeks to increase access to water and sanitation services, eliminate open defecation, and improve the financial performance of water services providers in selected counties.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 08, 2024"
