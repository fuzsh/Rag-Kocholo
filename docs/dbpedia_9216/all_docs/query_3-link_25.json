        "text": "The Central Bank of Kenya was established by an Act of Parliament of March 24, 1966 and opened its doors to the public on September 14, 1966. The Bank is now anchored in the Constitution under Article 231. The mandate of the Bank is to formulate and implement monetary policy that promotes price stability, fosters liquidity, solvency and stability of the banking sector, issue currency notes and coins, and provide banking services to the Government, commercial banks and other financial institutions.\n\nPrior to establishment of Kenya’s central bank, the East African Currency Board (EACB) undertook the role of currency issuance in the entire East African region throughout the colonial period to independence. Prior to Kenya’s independence in 1963, the East African Currency Board (EACB) published a report advising the three countries of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika to establish an East African Central Bank to act as the banker to governments — the bank was to provide banking services for the commercial banks, to smoothen financial fluctuations, and to function as an instrument of official monetary policy.\n\nAt independence, the EACB started performing some central banking functions in the absence of one. They provided credit to the government and were authorised to lend to commercial banks for crop financing. However, the board’s functions could not match those of a central bank. The concept of a single central bank began being mooted though it did not succeed. This then led to the establishment of the three East African country central banks of Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya.\n\n1896 First bank ever established in Kenya – the National Bank of India\n\n1905 Establishment of Mombasa Currency Board\n\n1910 Standard Bank of South Africa established\n\n1911 Standard Chartered Bank founded in Kenya\n\n1916 Barclays Bank established in Kenya.\n\n1919 Mombasa Currency Board replaced with a London based East African Currency Board\n\n1921 Cessation of the Indian Rupee as a legal tender\n\n1922 East African shilling replaces the Rupee exchanging at Sh2 a rupee\n\n1951 General Bank of Netherlands, later known as ABN Amro, set up\n\n1953 Bank of India and Bank of Baroda set up\n\n1956 Habib Bank (overseas) Ltd set up\n\n1957 Kisumu Currency Centre established under East African Currency Board (EACB)\n\n1960 The headquarters of the EACB moved from London to Nairobi\n\n1962 Commercial Bank of Africa, which was registered in Tanzania, opens a branch in Kenya.\n\n1965 The first locally owned commercial bank, the Co-operative Bank of Kenya, registered under the Co-operative Societies Act\n\n1966 March – enactment of Central Bank of Kenya Act.

CBK in collaboration with the National Museum of Kenya opens a Numismatic Gallery\n\nThe expansion of the banking networks grew from one branch in the town of Mombasa in 1896 to eight branches in five towns before the First World War having added Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu and Eldoret. The National Bank of South Africa, which was to become Barclays Bank DCO in 1926, arrived in Mombasa in 1916. During the Great Depression from 1929 to 1939, there was a gold rush to Kakamega and in 1934 there were two bank branches opened in the town to service the prospectors. These branches did not survive and were closed during the Second World War. By 1948, banks were to be found in 10 towns having expanded to Nyeri, Nanyuki, Kitale, Kericho and Thompson’s Falls (Nyahururu) with 18 branches as Mombasa, Nairobi, Nakuru and Kisumu all got representation from the three banks.\n\nAs time progressed, the changing landscape of banking began to note the entrance of fully indigenous banks. Kenya’s first fully locally owned commercial bank was the Co-operative Bank of Kenya, which was initially a co-operative society. It served the needs of growing farming communities and started operations in 1968. In the same year, the National Bank of Kenya became the first fully-owned government bank. In 1971, the Kenya Commercial Bank was formed following the merger of the National and Grindlays Bank, with the government owning a 60-per cent majority stake. It took poll position as the largest of the country’s commercial banks in terms of deposits and number of branches.\n\nAfter independence, the banking sector in Kenya has continued to grow, reflecting the country’s growth towards economic prosperity."
