        "text": "Kenya’s shilling has staged a comeback that’s vaulted it from one of the worst to the best in the world in less than three months.\n\nAs recently as January 26, the shilling was the third worst performer globally, plumbing a record low versus the dollar. Since then, it has rebounded more than 20%, aided by a mix of factors, including a new eurobond issue. Its year-to-date gain puts it far ahead of the world’s second-best performer — the Sri Lankan rupee — which has strengthened 6.1%."
