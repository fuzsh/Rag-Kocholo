        "text": "Data from SWIFT shows that FIN traffic growth in East Africa has outperformed the total growth of SWIFT globally. In the year to date, total message traffic volumes grew by 20.1% versus 8.2% growth for SWIFT worldwide. This clearly illustrates the increasingly important role that East Africa plays in SWIFT’s global business. Figures released at SWIFT’s Business Forum East Africa also show intra-regional traffic has increased 19.8%. Data also shows that intra-regional FIN payments traffic is up 19.8% from 2015, and now accounts for 69% of FIN payments traffic in the region. The average daily number of messages has almost double since 2013, from 15,234 to 27,907 in 2016. This growth in intra-regional FIN payments could be a reflection of the success of the East African Payment System, which was established by the East African Community in 2013. The multi-currency system, operating on SWIFT, links the domestic payments systems in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Rwanda. It makes cross-border fund transfers much easier within the Community, supporting the free movement of goods, labour and services. The system aims to reduce transaction time and lower the cost of doing business in the region. SWIFT traffic growth in the East African Community is significantly higher than the rest of the continent, which also saw major growth. Total message traffic volumes in Africa have increased by 15.4% this year. This is still greater than in EMEA overall at 9.4%, the Americas at 7.8% and Asia Pacific at 5.4%. The growth in East Africa is...\n\nThe Minister of Energy and Mineral Development Irene Muloni has said that fuel supply to Uganda has remained stable in the medium term and is able to support the growing demand of 7% per annum for Petroleum Products. “Rt. Hon. Speaker and Hon. Members of Parliament, the supply of Petroleum Products into the country, has been stable. Loading out of Kenya terminals of Eldoret, Kisumu, Nakuru, Konza and Mombasa together with Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is normal without interruptions,” Muloni said while presenting a report on the status of petroleum product supply in the country. She said the import into the country for mid-September 2017 was 85,048,119 liters comprised of 34,699,986 liters of Petrol, 42,694,601 liters of Diesel, 2,653,532 liters of Kerosene and 5,000,070 liters of Jet A-1. Muloni said tendering for supply of Products continues to take place monthly in Nairobi Kenya and that a tender meeting was held two weeks ago for the supply for November 2017. she said the cargoes received through Mombasa port contributes 92% of the country's monthly requirements while the reminder (8%) comes through the Dar es Salaam Port. She said for stocks, the country has a combined total cover of 14 days' supply. Of these, twelve (12) days are provided by the private OMCs and two (2) days by Government storage facilities at Jinja. Therefore, in view of the above, Muloni said: “we are prepared and will continue to do everything possible to ensure a steady supply of petroleum products to the...\n\nMinisters from Eastern and Central African blocs meet today in Republic of Congo capital Brazzaville to chart a common position on the COP 23 in November in Bonn, Germany. COP 23 is the latest of the series of meetings of Conference of Parties that are signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty through which that member states commit to reduce greenhouse gas emission. The ministers expected to meet today in the Republic of Congo capital of Brazzaville are from the East African Community (EAC) and the Economic Community for Central African States (ECCAS). Rwanda subscribes to both blocs. The central focus of the meet is the acceleration of the operationalisation of the climate commission for the Congo Basin. Also on agenda is developing a strategy on how to speed up the operationalisation of the Congo Basin Commission of which the Blue Fund of the Congo Basin, the Green Business Fund and other initiatives created to ensure economic development within the region do not compromise environment conservation. The Blue Fund for the Congo Basin was ratified by 12 countries, including Rwanda, that heads the Commission of Central African Forests. Finding common ground The ministerial meeting was preceded yesterday by one for experts from the two blocs. Rwanda is represented by Dr Jean Baptiste Habyalimana, the ambassador to the Republic of Congo. The EAC Principal Environment and Natural Resource Officer, Eng. Ladislaus K. Leonidas, said that the conference is an opportunity for the two blocs to share experience. \"ECCAS and EAC...\n\nReading the history of Africa, you can never miss the scramble for its acreage and the resources, leading to the illogical, politically instigated birth of countries as defined by the borders we now know. Communities and commerce were disrupted as traditional trade routes and peoples’ movements were choked. The rise of additional barriers to trade can be traced to this. Fast forward to present times; technology is getting deployed to address some of our most pressing needs as caused or exacerbated by colonial actions. Earlier this year we saw the fintech space grab headlines with an influx of venture funding. This did not come as a surprise, as in retrospect the movement of funds had been curtailed by the scramble for Africa, which in essence is one part of what underpins commerce. Money is now able to traverse the continent in a split second applied towards the exchange of value. The battle for that turf remains; whoever can move the bits and bytes faster and cheaper will win. The second part of the commerce equation is commodities. The medium of exchange can cross borders fluidly but the product side doesn’t enjoy such benefits, at least not yet. To move products, one requires infrastructure and inventory; both of which are a hodge podge of varied grade deployments in Africa. Infrastructure covers roads, railways, airports, ports, warehouses, holding docks among others. Inventory covers trucks, airplanes, wagons, and various motorised plus non-motorised transports with carriage capacity; all available in plenty but lacking a...\n\nAfrica’s leaders, along with everyone else interested in US-Africa relations, have waited eight months for US President Donald Trump’s administration to explain its Africa policy. We aren’t there yet. But in recent weeks Trump has indicated the level and extent of his interest. And, senior African affairs officials at the State and Defence Departments are at last attempting publicly to outline US goals and objectives toward Africa. This, apparently without much guidance from their president. Trump’s inaugural address to the UN General Assembly said little about Africa – barely one paragraph towards the end. One sentence praised African Union and UN-led peacekeeping missions for “invaluable contributions in stabilising conflicts in Africa.” A second praised America, which continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia and northern Nigeria and Yemen. The next day Trump hosted a luncheon for leaders of nine African countries –Cote d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, and South Africa. Only his welcoming remarks have been published but they are nearly devoid of policy content or guidance. His opening gambit reminded me of a 19th century colonialist hoping to become rich, as he proclaimed: Africa has tremendous business potential, I have so many friends going to your countries trying to get rich. I congratulate you, they’re spending a lot of money….It’s really become a place they have to go, that they want to go. Trump called on African companies to invest in the US. Then, shifting to security cooperation,...\n\nOctober 3, 2017 (KAMPALA) – The South Sudanese President Salva Kiir has commended his Ugandan counterpart, Yoweri Museveni for the continued support and solidarity with his government. Kiir’s message, State House said, was delivered to Museveni by the South Sudanese army chief of general staff, General James Ajonga Mawut. At the meeting, which was held in Mbale town on Tuesday, Museveni and Ajonga reportedly discussed cooperation and training of the Ugandan army (UPDF) and the South Sudanese military (SPLA). Details of Tuesday’s discussions were, however, not divulged to the press. Uganda and South Sudan have long standing economic and security interests. Currently, Uganda is also hosting more than one million refugees fleeing from the violent conflict in South Sudan. The East African nation was one of the first countries that recognised South Sudan’s independence from Sudan in July 2011. Source: Sudan Tribune\n\n52 skilled youths graduated from an expanded East African SAP Skills for Africa program this week in Kenya. The graduation ceremony took place at the Kenya School of Government in Nairobi. All 52 graduates have already been placed at partner and customer organisations in the region. Head of SAP Skills for Africa, Meena Confait, said, “This year marked our first expanded East Africa program, with candidates from Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia completing their training in key SAP solutions. In line with our commitment to diversity, we are also proud to announce that 40% of graduates are female. We wish all graduates well as they enter the regional workforce and apply their hard-earned digital expertise.” SAP Skills for Africa is a skills development initiative between SAP Africa, its customers, and various public and private sector partners, and focuses on training and certifying graduates in a broad spectrum of SAP software and business solutions. Since its inception in 2012, it has provided training and industry job placement opportunities for more than 400 consultants, with more than a third of them assimilated through the partnership with the ICT Authority. Valuable partner and customer ecosystem Considering the importance of SMEs in driving job creation and economic growth on the African continent, this year also saw the introduction of SAP Business One to the curriculum, which already supports more than 55 000 SMEs globally. “By focusing on developing practical digital skills related to actual market needs, SAP Skills for Africa graduates are able to...\n\nBusiness Reporter Infrastructure experts from the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa Member States are meeting in Zambia to review the status of domestication and implementation of programmes in transport and communications, energy and information technology in the region. Among the key programmes in focus are; the establishment of a navigational route between Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea known as VICMED, the regional power interconnectors and the proposed establishment of cybercrime capacity building centre. This is the 10th meeting of the Comesa committee of infrastructure experts representing the 19 Member States. Noting that the estimated financing requirement to close Africa’s infrastructure deficit amounts to $93 billion annually until 2020, Assistant Secretary General for Comesa, Dr Kipyego Cheluget said the implementation of Africa’s Vision of an integrated continent free of poverty is inextricably linked to the existence of infrastructure. “The emphasis at regional and continental levels is on innovation and creativity, thinking outside the box to come up with feasible instruments to speed up the development of physical infrastructure,” he said, adding that the Comesa EAC-Sadc tripartite region requires US$50 billion,” said Dr Cheluget. During the session, a progress report on the implementation of Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya (ZTK) Power Interconnector was presented. The project is currently under implementation to interconnect the three countries thus creating a link between the Southern African Power Pool and the East African Power Pool. This will make it possible for transmission of power from Cape to Cairo. According to a market study conducted on the...\n\nAlso the regional local units were backed by agro-inflows and central banks’ monetary actions. Tanzania shilling Tanzanian shilling, the second biggest economy in the region, traded flat with modest demand from corporates. “We saw moderate demand from corporates on today’s trading session due to month end obligations,” NMB Bank said in a statement yesterday. The commercial banks quoted the shilling at 2230/2270 against the green back. Another bank, CRDB said the market experienced matching supply and demand for the pair but some pressure was still faced on the right hand side. “We expect this pressure to ease up due to central bank intervention and as well as the incoming cashew-nut season,” CRDB said. Ugandan shilling Ugandan shilling has inched up on flows from charities and helped by some typical end of month hard currency inflows from non-governmental organisations and coffee exporters. Last Friday, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 3,597/3,607, compared with Thursday’s close of 3,600/3,610. Kenyan shilling Kenyan shilling eased against the dollar last Friday due to dollar from some multinational companies, traders quoted saying. The shilling of the largest economy in the bloc was quoted by commercial banks at103.15/35 per dollar, compared with 103.20/40 at Thursday’s close. It was reported also that traders were assessing the level of hard currency demand from importers to figure out its potential direction. Rwandese franc The Rwandan franc relatively remained unchanged at 846.18 yesterday compared to a last Monday 845.45. The stability was attributed to Rwanda’s foreign exchange reserves that kept the...\n\nThe United Nations migration agency said on Tuesday that it has concluded a training program aimed at assisting East African states to strengthen migration governance and migrant protection capacities. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said that in cooperation from the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD), it organized the two-week program that covered topics such as labor migration and border management, international migration law, and migration and development. In a statement issued in Nairobi, the IOM said the training aimed to enhance migration governance and migrant protection in the IGAD region, which comprises Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda. \"The training provided us with an opportunity to learn about current developments in the IGAD region, and I believe that we gained very relevant knowledge especially now that IGAD member states are in the process of developing national policies on migration and border management,\" said Mary Mideva Kezzah, from Kenya's Ministry of the East Africa Community, Labor and Social Protection. Thirty-four attendees were selected from institutions belonging to the National Coordination Mechanisms. They include interior, foreign affairs, and labor ministry officials, lawmakers, and officers of immigration and police services from IGAD member states. The training sessions resulted in a set of recommendations including the development of a training roadmap to be developed by the African Capacity Building Center (ACBC). The first draft of the document will be launched at the next training for IGAD participants from Oct. 30 to Nov. 3 in Tanzania. IOM Tanzania Chief of Mission..."
