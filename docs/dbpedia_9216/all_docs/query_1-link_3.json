        "text": "The shilling has a rich history, both as a historical coin and as a current monetary unit in various countries. Historically, the shilling was a currency unit in Australia, Austria, New Zealand, and Ireland, but it was phased out during the 1960s and 1970s. However, it remains in circulation in five East African countries.\n\nIn Kenya, the Kenyan shilling (KES) serves as the national currency. It ranks as the 25th most-used currency globally and is considered the most stable unit in East Africa, issued by the Central Bank of Kenya. The Somali shilling (SOS), introduced in 1921, is the official currency of Somalia, divided into 100 senti (cents) with banknotes ranging from five to 1,000 shillings.\n\nTanzania uses the Tanzanian shilling (TZS) as its official currency, issued by the Bank of Tanzania since 1966. Uganda's currency, the Ugandan shilling (UGX), has been in use since 1966. It underwent a revaluation in 1987, transitioning from the old to the new shilling at a rate of 100 to 1, and is available in both banknotes and coins.\n\nThe Somaliland shilling was introduced on October 18, 1994, replacing the Somali shilling at a rate of 100 to 1 due to the impact of the civil war and political unrest in Somalia.\n\nIn Australia, the shilling was first issued in 1910, valued at one-twentieth of a pound, and remained in use until 1990. Now considered historical coins, the most valuable is the 1915L Australian shilling, valued at $3,250 in almost uncirculated (aUNC) condition.\n\nAustria's currency, the Austrian Schilling (German: Schilling), was in circulation from 1925 to 1938 and again from 1945 to 1999, remaining in use until 2002. In Ireland, the Irish shilling ceased to be the official currency on December 31, 1971, replaced by the Irish Five Pence. New Zealand used the New Zealand pound from 1840 until 1967. This transition of the shilling across different regions and times illustrates its historical significance and evolving role in global economies."
