        "text": "What Is the UGX (Ugandan Shilling)?\n\nUGX is the currency code for the Ugandan shilling, which is the national currency of the Republic of Uganda. UGX is used in the foreign exchange market to identify the country's currency and to facilitate trading. The Ugandan shilling is administered by the country's central bank, the Bank of Uganda (BoU). The bank has the sole authority to print and mint banknotes and coins. It is also responsible for the country's monetary policy and fiscal stability.\n\nUnderstanding the UGX (Ugandan Shilling)\n\nAs noted above, the BoU is the only entity with the right to mint, distribute, or destroy currency in Uganda. Coins have denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 shillings, while banknotes have denominations of 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, and 50,000 shillings.\n\nThe Ugandan shilling was divisible into 100 cents. After 2013, the shilling became the smallest unit of currency used and cents were abandoned.\n\nIn 2010, the Bank of Uganda circulated an issue of shilling banknotes with enhanced security features and images depicting the nation's history and culture. Although the Ugandan shilling is a stable currency and is used in most financial transactions in Uganda, it isn't uncommon for people in the country to use the U.S. dollar (USD), Great Britain pound (GBP), and the euro (EUR).\n\nUGX (Ugandan Shilling) in Forex Trading\n\nAccording to XE, the UGX is most commonly paired with the USD. To find out how many US dollars a single shilling will buy, divide one by the USD/UGX rate. As of December 2023, $1 is equal to around 3,781 UGX.\n\nAssume that the USD/UGX rate is 3,671. This means it costs 3,671 Ugandan shillings to buy one USD. If the rate increased to 3,900, that would mean the UGX lost value relative to the USD. That's because it requires more UGX to buy one USD. If the rate were to drop to 3,500, it would take fewer shillings to buy a USD, so the UGX would increase in value.\n\nIf the EUR/UGX rate is 4,008, that means it costs USh4,008 to buy one euro.\n\nHistory of the UGX (Ugandan Shilling)\n\nThe East African Currency Board handled monetary policy for Uganda before 1966. At the time, Uganda and several neighboring countries used the common East African shilling as their currency. When the Bank of Uganda was established in 1966, financial decisions were transferred to the new central bank, and the nation introduced the country’s first official currency.\n\nThe first issue Ugandan shilling was introduced in 1966 and replaced the East African shilling at par. In 1987, the government issued a new shilling which received the currency symbol of UGX. The new shilling was valued at 100 old shillings. The Ugandan shilling is floating against other currencies, which means it isn't pegged to any other currency.\n\nThe Ugandan Economy\n\nAgriculture is the most significant economic earner for Uganda, with coffee being one of the primary crops. Most of the population are subsistence farmers. The country has oil and gas resources, but they contribute little to the economy. The people of Uganda are one of the poorest in the world, which has led to under-education.\n\nAccording to World Bank data, Uganda is a heavily indebted country. The country experienced 8% annual inflation in 2022. Uganda's gross domestic product (GDP) was $45.57 billion in 2022. The country's GDP growth rate was 4.6% in 2022.\n\nHistory of Uganda\n\nUganda is a landlocked nation in East Africa in a region known as the African Great Lakes region. The country has a highly diverse population consisting of different individual ethnic groups. It boasts fertile land which is rich in natural resources. Winston Churchill called Uganda “the pearl of Africa” after he visited the region while the country was under British rule. The nation’s economy is primarily based on agriculture.\n\nThe area was a British protectorate between 1894 and 1962 when it gained independence. Uganda went through several conflicts including a six-year guerrilla war. A disagreement between tribal groups within the government and the Buganda kingdom marred the early years of independence. Government instability led to a military coup in 1971 led by Major General Idi Amin. His dictatorship carried out mass murders and many fled the country.\n\nThe restoration of legal rule came in 1979 when neighboring Tanzania assisted exiles in overthrowing the dictator. Ongoing party disputes within the nation's governmental structure and corruption have continued to handcuff the country's growth.\n\nIn 2012, the European Union (EU), Germany, the United Kingdom, and other countries removed aid to Uganda after the embezzlement of $13 million in donated funds that were meant to help the nation's most impoverished region. Uganda is criticized by other countries because of its poor record on human rights, torture, and child labor practices.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nUganda's national currency is the shilling. It is represented by the currency code UGX in the forex market. The shilling was adopted as the official currency after it replaced the East African shilling used in Uganda and several neighboring countries. Although it is free-floating (which means it isn't pegged to any other currency), it is most commonly paired with the U.S. dollar in foreign exchange trading."
