C. 70, INVOLVING A PERIOD OF EIGHTEEN CENTURIES, AND INCLUDING FIFTY-FIVE GENERATIONS, DOWN TO GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON, FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ■ BY ALBERT WELLES, President of the American College for Genealogical Registry and Heraldry* NEW-YORK : • [) SOCIETY LIBRARY. T879. BOSTON PUBLIC LIBRARY, CS1/ 3 O cl 5 \"3> I •.'$£? Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1879, bv ALBERT WELLES, In the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. PREFACE. MY position as President of the \"American College for Genealogical Registry and Heraldry \" enables rae'to obtain correct pedigrees and history of For- eign Families, and as the English history of the Washing- ton Family, by several authors, has been confessedly suppos- ititious, it is deemed important that a correct and authentic volume should be written that would become the standard for reference on the subject. My correspondent in London, from whom I have ob- tained the material for the Washington Pedigree in Eng- land, is a lineal descendant of the progenitor in England, and has been engaged over thirty years in gathering evi- dence. He thus writes : \" If I had not taken upon myself the great labor of examining those inestimable Records, the * Common Pleas Rolls,' the truth of that great man's lineage would not have been revealed. They are of im- mense value, and I hope you will make them known to your countrymen by the publication of the Washington History. The pedigree I now send I can establish by legal evidence. The uncertainty hitherto existing in regard to the English progenitors of the Washington Family, which has led to the numberless and fruitless controversies among the Genealogists, will be entirely removed and cleared up by this volume. Beginning: with Odin, the Founder of Scan dinavia, b. c. 70, the history is followed down through the fiiil iv PREFACE. Royal line of Denmark in the thirty-two generations to \" Thorfin the Dane/' nat. circa a. d. iooo, whose ances- tors were of Schleswig, Denmark. He settled in York- shire, England, prior to the • Norman Conquest. The descent is traced in Denmark and England, from father to son, down through the centuries, including branches in different shires, to John Washington, the great-grand- father of General George Washington, in twenty genera- tions from Thorfin ; with interesting personal matter regarding nearly 500 members of the Family -and their alliances in England and America. The Family of Washington derives its name from the Village of Wassington, juxta Raven sworth (now called Wharleton), in the Parish of Kirkby-Ravensworth, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Originally Evervicscire — the Eboricure of the Romans, or Evereux, — afterwards Ebor, at the time of the Conquest, and lastly Yorkshire. The people of this part of the country were all of Scan- dinavian descent, and spoke the same language with the Normans themselves, which was the language of the Ancient Angles. The Saxons never settled here, and were of a different race. The City of York having been long before that time especially a Danish City, and the Chief City in all England. With respect to the ^/^/^-Saxons, there were no Saxons in these parts, which was settled by the Angles, who spoke the same language as is spoken this day in these parts of Yorkshire ; and all those Saxon inscriptions, about which so many wonders are made, is simply plain Yorkshire. The Angles were a branch of the Danes, who lived in Schleswig (a seaport town of Denmark), and came over to England, men, women, children, beasts, &c, and left that country desolate for 300 years, as is confirmed by the Saxon chron- icles. The 174 manors given to Earl Alan by the Conqueror, were only so many shadows. There were only about six PREFACE. v manors really attached to the Earldom of Richmondshire ; of all the others he was merely nominally the Chief Lord ; and each was held by an owner whose ancestors held for many generations before the Conquest. There was never in Richmondshire above six families descended from Norman Ancestors ; and they acquired their lands by marrying heiresses. The growing importance and value of such a work as this, is illustrated by the increasing interest in everything pertaining to General Washington, and it is, in fact, the only genealogy and Family History of national importance in this country. The Bible, is a History of the earliest races of Mankind ; and a Record of the Jewish Lineage — Religion, the Science of Immortality — Genealogy cognate with both, inasmuch as it is a study embracing the present life, combined with departed generations, giving results of vast import in the future, and may therefore be considered next only in im- portance to Religion and Bible History. The Songs with which the Northern Bards regaled the Heroes at their \" Feasts of Shells \" were but versified chronicles of each Ancestral line, symphonied by their stirring deeds. Through the oak fire's uncertain flame, the Chieftain saw descend the shadowy forms of his Fathers ; they came from the Halls of Odin, as the harper swept the strings, and deployed before their descendant, rejoicing in the sound of their praise. No parchment told his Lineage to the Warrior of those days, but the Heroic Names were branded each night upon his swelling heart by the burning numbers of the Bards. Thus did the Northman chronicle his Ancestry in those unlettered times. Afterward, when the oak fire was extin- guished, the shell thrown by, and the night came no more with songs ; when we reach the age of Records we find this love of Lineage availing itself of the new meth -d of com- vi PREFACE. memoration. This strong Ancestral spirit of the Northman may traced, partly to the profound sentiment of perpetuity which formed the principal and noblest element of his character, and partly to the nature of the property to which he was linked by immemorial customs of the race. The Family History, or Record, of the Sovereigns of the World before Christ, furnish almost the only Histories of the Countries over which they reigned, as Egypt, Chaldea, Babylonia, Greece, &c. The Chinese annals, the most ancient known, were written with the most perfect exact- ness, and preserved with the greatest care ; composed originally by order of the Emperors— each of whom on his accession to the throne, commanded the acts of his predeces- sors to be written by some learned philosopher — so that the whole form one uniform continued series of the History of the Ancient Chinese Empire, from the beginning of the mon- archy (Fo Hi b. c. 2538), for some thousands of years. And thus was the history of China obtained and preserved more correctly, and for a longer period than that of any other nation in the world. Had not the Hebrew race cherished this love of Kindred and Lineage we should not have any Bible to-day, and to this feeling we owe our knowledge of the History of the most ancient Kingdoms of the World and most of our Modern History. The English Registers have, for upwards of a thousand years, been the protection and authority of many families ; and the means of preserving large property interests. A.

Putnam's Sons for similar favors ; and to John C. Buttre, Esq., Steel-plate engraver. Also to James Phillippe, Esq., of London, for the English Pedigree.

An attempt was made some years ago to publish some of these Record- „ but the parties employed to transcribe them could not read the originals cor- rectly and left out much of the most important information. With respect to the \"Domesday Book,\" it is simply a schedule of the lands belonging to the King's Geld, and does not include any of the inde- pendent freeholders of the period, and is therefore; not of that importance, ignorantly attributed to it. William the Conqueror, although he confis- cated some of the great fiefs of the Anglo-Saxon nobles, yet he did not touch the lands belonging to any of the tenants holding feudally under them. It embraces the whole of Yorkshire, with which is included part of Lancashire and Westmoreland. YORKSHIRE. The County of York gave William the Conqueror more trouble than any other of the shires. The eminent General Herreward le Wake, who re- sisted the Norman invasion more successfully than even Harold, was a na- tive of what was then the North Riding. The Eboricans, after the country was subdued, allied themselves with the Angles, and were in constant re- volt. The original Anglo-Saxon families disgusted with Norman severities, retired into Scotland, and it is from the \"Ragged Roll\" that the investiga- tor can find trace of these families, after their removal. In view of this, there is good ground for the statement made by several writers, that there was actually no Survey made in the County of York at the period of the 11. INTRODUCTION. Conquest. The '\" Ragged Roll,\" copied by Nesbit, was returned to Scotland by Edward III. The Saxons settled in the middle and southern portions of England, and were of a different race, the city of York having been long before that time especially a Danish city, and the chief city in all England. The uncertainty hitherto existing in regard to the early progenitors of the Washington Family in England, which has led to the numberless and endless controversies among the English and American genealogists, will be entirely removed and cleared up by this History, which is based upon and compiled mainly from the \" Common Pleas Rolls \" of England. These Rolls run over 2,000 skins of parchment for every year, and are closely written on both sides in abbreviated Latin. They contain every- thing relating to law, both civil and criminal, in all parts of England, with the Coronors' Rolls, &c. They form an extensive and valuable historical depository, and have been the means of clearing up and correcting a vast amount of the early history of the country at the time of, and subsequent to the Norman Conquest. This Washington Family History therefore being authentic, must be- come important and valuable in England and America. The above Rolls having been inaccessible because inscrutable, have never been used by other Genealogists who have attempted to compile a \" Washington Pedigree,\" and their disputes and controversies have been bitter and fruitless. General Washington's ancestors for many generations before they emigrated to America were agriculturists, and the reason that the names of the two brothers, Laurence and John, who came in 1659, do not appear in the pub- lished lists, was because they were not \" subsidy jnen,\" but farmers of good estate, and this accounts also for the fact that the Genealogists were unable to trace the pedigree of the Washington Family in England, as it could not be found in any of the Public Records, except the \"Common Pleas Rolls,\" all of which may be plainly seen in this History of the Family. Washington Irving states that the progenitor of the Washington Family in England, from whom was derived George Washington, first President of the United States, was William de Hertburn, of Durham, 1 1 83 who ex- changed his village of Hertburn for the manor and village of Wessyng'on, in Durham, and changed his name with the estate to de Wessyngton, and cites the \" Bolden Book\" to prove him the ancestor of the Washington Fam- INTRODUCTION. lli. ly, which the said book fails to do, but only recites that de Hertburn made ;he exchange. As Irving does not give account of the descendants of above William, he fails to prove him the ancestor of the American Washingtons. He mentions next a William de Wessyngton who was at the battle of Lewes in 1264, inferentially son or grandson of said William de Hertburn, which he was not, as he was son of Walter fil Bondo de Wessington of Rav- ensworth, Yorkshire. He next mentions Sir Stephen de Wessyngton, of Dur- ham, 1334, but does not state who he was. And next in 1350 a *William de Wessyngton, manifestly also descended from above William de Hertburn — as being lord of the manor of Wessyngton in Durham, and died 1367, whose son William succeeded to the estate, and as he left no male heir, the name and line died out, being merged into the Tempest (not Temple) family by marriage of his daughter with Sir William Tempest, of Studley in York- shire, who gave up the manor, and it passed to the family of Blackstone. Thus it is seen by Irving's own showing that William de Hertburn could not have been the ancestor of the American Washingtons. He next refers to a John de Wessyngton, Prior of the Benedictine Con- vent in Durham, 141 5. He does not state who he was, but that he died in 1446. Having abandoned the de Hertburn founders, he next takes up for an- cestor the Hon Laurence Washington, Mayor of Northampton, and states that he was son of John Washington, of Warton, Co. Lancaster. The above Laurence was son of John Washington, of Tuwhitfield, Co. Lancaster, who was derived from Robert de Washington, of Milleburn, Westmoreland, but General Washington was not derived from said Laurence. He next states that \"John and Andrew Washington were great grandsons of above Laurence, and emigrated to Virginia in 1657.\" The two brothers Laurence and John, who emigrated in 1659, were sons of Leonard Washington, of Warton, Co. Lancaster, who died at Warton in 1657. His father and grand- father were named Laurence, born and died at Warton, Co. Lancaster. Irving winds up the English pedigree thus : \" We have entered with some minuteness into this genealogical detail, tracing the family step by step through the pages of historical documents, for upwards of six centuries.\" * Above William, who died in 1367 was descended from William de Washington, son of Walter fil Bondo, of Wessington, juxta Ravensworth, Yorkshire. As there were several villages in different parts of England named Wessyngton, either might have served for ancestors. IV. INTROD \"CTION. Those who will read the first chapter of his book may see the length of the steps, and the genealogical detail. I have taken Irving as a type of the class. Many others have made similiar derivations. If any of these gentlemen had traced the lineage of the Washington Family from William de Hertburn, down through the genera- tions from father to son, they might have named him as the progenitor in England, but as they have all failed in this, it is simply absurd to have adopted him. Furthermore the family was founded in England nearly two centuries prior to the time of said William de Hertburn. WASHINGTON. Of all the noble families of England, that of Washington is the most ancient and one of the most illustrious. Tracing back through the Royal line of Denmark to that gi^eat hero King Odin, the Founder of Scandinavia B. C. 70, whose life and character were so great and glorious that his people deified himself and family, and thus established a Scandinavian mythology of equal magnitude and grandeur with that of ancient Greece and Egypt, and of such minuteness in detail as to have confused some historians who were unable to separate the real from the mythological history. The remarkable resemblance of character between Odin and his de- scendant Washington, separated by a period of eighteen centuries, is so great as to excite the profound and devout astonishment of the genealogical student — one the Founder of the most eminent race of Kings and Conquerors,, and the other of the Grand Republic of America. SCANDINAVIA. There is a nation, even now extant, possessing a history as brave as that of the Romans, as poetic as that of the Greeks — a nation that has con- trolled the world's history in many things and at many times, and whose achievements in war and in letters, are worthy the most heroic age of Rome and the most finished period of Greece ; a nation whose philosophy outran their age and anticipated results that have been slowly occurring ever since. This reference can be true of but one people, the Norsemen, the dwellers in Scandinavia, who lived as heroes, lords and conquerors ; who, sailing out of the ice and desolation in which they were born and nur- tured, conquered England, Scotland and Ireland, ravaged Brittany and INTRODUCTION. V, Normandy, discovered and colonized Iceland and Greenland, and crossed the Atlantic in their crazy barks and discovered this very continent long before Columbus; anchored in Vineland Sound, and left a monument behind them ; and wheresoever they went they were lords and rulers. And then their religion — what a wild, massive, manly mythology 1: With nothing of the soft sentimentalities of more southern people, but con- tinent of much that revelation has assured us to be true in doctrine — present- ing ever the necessity of right and doing right — of manliness, honesty and responsibility ; rewards and punishments. All the ancient traditions of the North agree in describing the first in- habitants of Scandinavia as men of colossal stature and incredible strength. These giants (or trolls as they were called by the Eddas) were alleged to> have* been a remnant of the Canaanitish Anakim (descendants of Anek, de- rived from Canaan, the son of Ham, the son of Noah), whom Caleb and. Joshua, by Divine command, drove out of Palestine, and who ultimately settled in Scandia after fighting many battles with the Scythian emigrants. from Asia. 1. ODTN. The most important epoch in the historical antiquities of the North, and the most memorable from the extraordinary revolutions it accomplished, is. the arrival of Odin, the Mars as well as the Mohammed of Scandinavia, the founder of those religious and political institutions which universally pre- vailed there until the introduction of Christianity.* The account of the historical Odin, as narrated by Snorre in the Yng- lina Saga, states that he came from Asaland or Asaheim, a district east- ward of the river Tanais, the capital of which was called Asgard, and the people Asen or Aesir. By his superior military talents Odin had endeared himself to his Asiatic subjects. He was successful in every combat, whence his warriors believed that victory hung on his arm. When he sent foi th his soldiers to any expedition he laid his hands upon them and blessed them ; they then * It was in the reign of Emund Biorn, King of Sweden — 820 to 859 — that the light of the gospel first dawned in the north, although it did not become the established religion until the accession of Olaf Skotkanung, a.d. iooi, who, with his whole family, was baptized in 1001. The surname of Skotkanung or Tribute King, was given to Olaf on ac- count of a yearly tax he paid to the Pope to carry on the war against the Infidels. Olaf was baptized by Sigefroy, an English monk whom King Ethelrcd of England had sent tc»> Sweden. Vlll. INTRODUCTION. exploits he is said to have conquered the Saxons and subjected them to the payment of an annual tribute. The son and successor of Skiold was : 3 FRIDLEIF THE FIRST, who was called the First King of Denmark of the Skioldungers, or descendants of Skiold, the son of Odin. He suc- ceeded to Skiold b. c. 40, and died B. c. 23. His sons were : 4 Frode Fredigod. 4 Fridlief. 4 Havar. 4 \"FRODE FREDIGOD (Pacific) was King of Denmark at the time of Christ.\" He succeeded King Fridleif in year B. c. 23 and died a. d. 35. Frode I. enjoyed the reputation of unrivalled prowess as a warrior, having carried his victorious arms into Sweden, Germany, Hungary, Eng- land and Ireland. So strict was the administration of justice in his own dominions, that, if we may credit the Northern legends, bags of gold might have been safely exposed on the highways. It is alleged that he compiled a civil and military code, which Saxo Grammaticus states to have been extant in his time. He was succeeded by his brother Fridleif. His son was : 5 Frode, born at Ledra about A. D. 1. 4 Fridleif the Second became King of Denmark in a. d. 35, and died A. d. 47. He was succeeded by his brother 4 Havah, who became King of Denmark A. D. 47, and died A. D. 59. He was succeeded by his nephew 5 FRODE THE SECOND, son of Frode Fredigod above, who became King of Denmark a. d. 59, and died A. D. 87. His successor was his son 6 VERMUND THE SAGrE, who became King of Denmark A. D. 87, and died a. D. 140. His successor was his son 7 QLAF THE MILD, who became King of Denmark and Zealand A. D 140, and died a. d. 190. His daughter married Dan Mykillati, who was his successor. 8 DAN MYKILLATI (the Splendid), became King of Denmark in A. D. 190. He died A. d. 270, after having reigned eighty years, with the greatest justice and reputation. Almost all historians agree that he was the founder of the kingdom of Denmark. The first that united the Danish provinces (except Jutland, which formed a separate monarchy) under one government was Dan Mykillati (the Magnanimous), King of Scania, a descendant of Heimdal, and married to a INTRODUCTION. ix. daughter of Olaf the Mild, Sovereign of Zealand and Denmark, and sixth in descent from Skiold. He reduced the whole country, with the smaller islands, to subjection, and is alleged to have given his name to the new kingdom of which he was the founder. The union of his sister with Dyggve of Sweden, is reckoned the earliest matrimonial alliance that was formed between the two Crowns. The son and successor of Dan Mykillati was : 9 FR0D3 THE THIRD, who became King of Denmark a. d. 270, and died A. d. 310. The son and successor of Frode the Third was: 10 HALFDAN THE FIRST, who became King of Denmark a. d. 310, and died A. D. 324. He subdued Sweden, defeated Aun in many battles and having driven him from the throne, he fixed his residence in Up- sala, where he died A. D. 324. The son and successor of Halfdan was : 11 FRIDLEIF THE THIRD, who became King of Denmark A. D. 324, and died A. D. 348. His son and successor was : 12 FRODE THE FOURTH, who became King of Denmark A. D. 348, and died A. D . 407. The three sons of Frode the Fourth were : 13 INGILD, who succeeded to his father as King of Denmark A. D. 407, and died A. D. 436. Another 13 HALFDAN THE SECOND, who succeeded to his brother Ingild as King of Denmark a. d. 456, and died A. d. 457 ; and 13 FRODE the Fifth, who succeeded to his brother Halfdan A. D. 457, and died A. D. 460. He was succeeded by Roe and Helge. The dominions of Halfdan II. (above) were inherited by his sons, 14 ROE and) who reigned from 460 to 494. They agreed to divide the 14 Helge, > sovereignty between them. The former is said to have built the city of Roskilde, but he exchanged his patrimony in the North for the Danish possessions in Northumberland, Eng. , where he fixed his residence and conquered several provinces from the Anglo Saxons. His brother Helge invaded the Swedish territory, defeated King Adils plundered the palace at Upsala and carried off the Queen, a Saxon princess named Yrsa. The lady from being his prisoner became his wife, and the mother of the celebrated hero (15) Rolf Krake, one of the brightest ornaments of the throne. His stature was gigantic and his strength extraordinary. Having perished ignobly by the treachery of a nobleman on whom he had bestowed his daughter in marriage, the crown became the prize of contending factions until the kingdom was X. INTROD CTION. again united under the sceptre of Ivar Vidfadme, who transmitted it to his grandson, Harald Hildetand. In the middle of the seventh century the brothers Rerik and Helge reigned jointly in Leire (Lethra) Zealand, and Ivar Vidfadme, King of Denmark, made himself ruler over a great part of the North, To obtain Sjelland (Zealand) he gave his daughter Audur in marriage to Rerik, al- though she preferred Helge. Afterward he kindled variance between the brothers so that Rerik in a fit of jealousy killed his brother Helge. Where- after Ivar succeeded in conquering Rerik and acquired Zealand. He lost his life on an expedition to Russia (Garderige) A. D. 647. About this time Hamlet (son of Horvendill, hereditary prince of Jutland) was killed in a battle as he was endeavoring by force to succeed to the Crown of Denmark, :<j which he was entitled, as having married Gerutha, daughter of Rerik. Harald Hildetand, a son of Rerik (and Audur), at the death of Ivar brought under subjection all the countries his grandfather Ivar had ruled, and became a mighty and sovereign King, but in 735, after a peaceful reign, his nephew Sigurd Hring, Viceroy in Sweden, raised an insurrection against him. The battle was fought at Bravallahede, Sweden, and Harald was killed. 15 FRODE THE SIXTH, son of Roe above, succeeded to Roe and Helge, and became King of Denmark a. d. 494. He died A. D. 510. His successor was his cousin, Rolf Krake, son of Helge above. 15 Rolf Krake became King of Denmark A. D. 510. He was of im- mense size ; his enormous stature and strength were so extraordinary that he was surnamed Krake. He kept 12 giants at his court. He was killed by his own sister, Skulda (married to Hjartvar, Rolf's Vice- roy in Skane), in A. D. 522. He died childless. The successor of Rolf Krake was Frode VII., son of his cousin Frode 16 FRODE THE SEVENTH, or Olaf the Sharp Eyed, became King of Denmark a. d. 522, and died a. D. 548. His two sons were : 17 Halfdan III., or Snaile, King of Denmark. 17 Rorik Slyngeband, also King of Denmark. 17 Ingiald Illrada, King of Sweden. The successor of Frode VII. was his son 17 HALFDAN THE THIRD, or Snaile I., became King of Denmark A. D. 548, and died a. d. 580. He was succeeded by his brother INTRODUCTION. XU 17 RORIK Slyngeband, who became King of Denmark A. d. 580, and died A. D. 588. He was succeeded by his nephew 18 IVAR VIDFADME, son of Halfdan III., who became King of Denmark. A. D. 588, and of Sweden A. D. 630, and died a. d. 647. Historians rank him among the most distinguished warriors of anti- quity. He raised Denmark to an unprecedented height of power. He con- quered all Sweden (allt Sviaveldi) and united it with all Denmark (allt Danaveldi) and a great part of Saxland, the whole of Estland and a fifth part of England. From him henceforth descend the supreme Kings of the Danes and the Swedes. The throne and extensive dominions of Ivar were inherited by his grandson, Harald Hildetand ; from him they descended to- Sigurd Ring and Ragnar Lodbrok, all of whom swayed the Danish sceptre in the eighth century. Ivar married Gothilda, by whom he had a daughter 19 AUDA DIUPHAUDZA, who became the wife of 19 Rekfk, or Robert, King of Holmgard, whose son was : 20 HARALD HILDETAND, or HlLLDiTUlt (Golden Tooth), who succeeded to Ivar Vidfadme as King of Denmark A. D. 647, and died A. D. 735,, when he was succeeded by his nephew, Sigurd Ring. Harald Hildetand, grandson of Ivar Vidfadme, raised Denmark to an?. illustrious height of grandeur. Not content with chastising the neighbor- ing States, he made frequent incursions into Germany, took the Vandals under his protection, reduced several nations on the Rhine, invaded the coasts of France and overran part of Britain, which, according to Saxo, had withdrawn its allegiance from the Danish Kings since the death of Frode III., A. D. 310. His fleets are described as covering the Sound, and like those of Xerxes bridging over the Northern Hellespont from shore to shore - but his life and reign terminated at the fatal battle of Bravala, fought on. the coast of Scania in 735, against his nephew, Sigurd Ring, in consequence of his attempt to expel him from the throne. The son of Harald Hildetand was (21) Throud. 21 SlGURD Hring, (son of the King Randver, who married Hildetand's sister Asa), became King of Sweden and Denmark A. D. 735. The Danish throne fell to the possession of Sigurd in 735, who, like other Danish Kings of his time, embarked in sea-roving expeditions to keep alive the military enthusiasm of his people. He recovered the English province of Northumberland, conquered by Ivar Vidfadme, which had as.- Xll. INTRODUCTION. serted its independence, and at his death, A. D. 750, he left the crown to his son, the famous Ragnar Lodbrok. He married Queen Alfhilda. His children were : 22 Ragnar Lodbrok, or Lodbrok the Elder (Hairy Breeches), and a 22 Daughter, who was married A. D. 750, to Fronde or Throud, or Hoerk, King of Frondheim, son of Harald Hildetand above. 22 Ragnar Lodbrok, son of Sigurd Hring, became King of Denmark A. D. 75O. This monarch while ruling his dominions in peace, his jealousy was excited by rumors of the daring achievements of his sons in various regions of Europe, and in A. D. 794 he determined to undertake an expedition that should rival their fame. Two vessels were built of immense size, such as had never before been seen in the North. \" The arrow,\" the signal of war, was sent through all his kingdom to summon his champions to arms. With this apparently inadequate force he set sail, contrary to the advice of his Queen, Aslanga, who presented him with a magical garment to ward off danger. After suffering from storms and shipwreck he landed on the coast of Northumberland, Eng. Ella, the Saxon King of that country, collected his forces to repel the invader. A battle ensued, wherein the valiant Dane, clothed in his enchanted robe and wielding the huge spear with which he had slain the guardian serpent of the Princess Thora, four times pierced the enemy's ranks, dealing death on every side, whilst his own person was in- vulnerable. But the contest was unequal, his warriors fell one by one around him until he was at last taken prisoner, stripped of his miraculous vest and thrown alive, by order of Ella, into a dungeon full of serpents, in the midst of which he expired with a laugh of defiance, chanting the famous death- song called the Lodbrokar-quida, or Biai-ka-mal, which he is alleged to have composed in that horrible prison. \" The surname of Lodbrok or Llairy Breeches he acquired from the rough garment, daubed with sand and pitch, that he wore when he slew the serpent and gained the hand ot Thora, his first Queen.\" — Torfaeus Hist. Nor. torn, I. lib. X. c. 29. \" Ragnar Lodbrok was remarkable for his exploits and enterprises of hazard. Perpetually roving in defiance and war, partly on the southern and eastern coasts of the Baltic, partly in Flanders, Scotland, Ireland and Eng- land, and being lord and ruler wherever he went, he was at last captured by King Ella, of Northumberland, who threw him bound into a dungeon INTRODUCTION. xiii. «of vipers. His four sons, avenging his death, divided the widespread realms which Ivar Vidfadme, Harald Hildetand and Sigurd Ring had gathered together.\" The first wife of Ragnar Lodbrok was Thora, who bore no children. His second was Asloga, daughter of Sigurd and Byrnhilda. She was the mother of : 23 Biorn Jarnaside, who became King of Sweden a. d. 794 23 Gudrod, or Godefred Hvidsaerk, who became King of Jutland and Wendon, and died a. d. 810. 23 Ivar Beentoris, who became King of Northumberland. 23 Siguard Snogoje, who became King of Denmark. After the death of Ragnar Lodbrok, A. d. 794, his son '23 SlGURD SNOGOJE (Snake Eye) inherited the Danish Crown, but was slain in battle with the Franks A. D. 803, after extending his sway over all Jutland, Scania, Holland and part of Norway. His son was : 24 Horda Knut or Harde-Canute, born about A. D. 790. The historian Meursius speaks in high terms of Sigurd Snake Eye : \"*' God enabled him to complete a reign as pregnant with real felicity as any which the annals of Denmark can show.\" At the death of Sigurd Snogoje, a. D. 803, he was succeeded by his son : ,24: HoRDA KNUT, or HARDE CANUTE, who being young at the time of his father's death, was left to the guardianship of his uncle Gudrod, Re- gent of the Kingdom. During the Prince's minority Jutland threw off its allegiance and the :sovereignty was fiercely contested between the sons of Gudrod and Harald Xlak, a petty King of Schloswig, and father of Rurik, who had taken violent possession of Frisia. He was repeatedly driven from his dominions and liis flight became remarkable as the means of shedding the first rays of Christianity over the Pagan darkness of the North. The achievement of this desirable object was reserved for Louis le Debonnaire, son of Charle- magne, whose Court at Ingleheim on the Rhine, was visited (a. d. 826) by the exiled Prince of Jutland, accompanied with his Queen, his sons and numerous retinue, in a fleet of a hundred galleys. Here the solicitations of the Emperor and his prelates induced Harald to renounce the errors of Paganism. His wife and children and many of his followers were bap- tized. Harde-Canute died A. D. 850. His son was: XIV.

His father Erik is said to have carried his zeal for Christianity so far as to cause the magntficent heathen temple at Upsala, with its idols and images, to be destroyed, and the ancient sacrifices to be interdicted, under the severest corporeal inflictions, but this imprudent mandate cost, him his life, as he was murdered in a tumult of the people enraged at the demolition of their Pagan worship. Olaf. — He made a temporary conquest of Norway, and having an- nexed Gothland inalienably to his own dominions, he assumed the title of King of Sweden, his predecessors being merely styled Fovereigns of Up- sala. His son Edmund Jacob contributed so much to the progress of Divine truth among his subjects as to obtain the designation of \" Most Christian. Majesty.\" A severe law which procured him the name of Kolbrenner (ihe coal-burner) enacted that if any man injured his neighbor, his effects to the same value, should be consumed with fire. His successor became involved, in a dispute with the Danes about adjusting the frontiers of the two king- doms, and fell at the head of an army which he had levied for recovering the ceded province of Scania. Indignant at the surrender of that valuable district, the Swedes raised Steukill to the throne, who founded a new dynasty to the exclusion of the race of Lodbrok. The Goths, who likewise- claimed the right of election, chose Hakon the Red as their King ; but the- rival monarchs came to an amicable arrangement by stipulating that the latter should enjoy the regal dignity for life, on condition that, at his. demise, Gothland should' revert inseparably to Sweden. 25 GORM, the son of Horda Knut, surnamed the Old from the length of his reign, fifty-eight years. He became King of Denmark a. D. 883,, and died a. D. 941. Profiting by the absence of many of the jarls and chiefs in distant predatory expeditions, he subdued Jutland. Other conquests followed until he succeeded in uniting into one State the territories which now con- INTRODUCTION.

He had espoused the beautiful Thyra Dannebod (ornament of Denmark), daughter of Harald Klak, who had been baptized when a child in France, and through her influence he was induced to tolerate the preaching of the missionaries, although he still continued to worship the idols of his ancestors. His sons were : Canute and Harald. The son of Harald Hildetand (No. 20) above was : 21 THROUD or FRONDS, King of Frondheim, who married a daughter of Sigurd Ring, a. D. 750, and was father of 22 EISTEN, King of Frondheim, who married A. D. 780, and was father of 23 HALFDAN, King of Frondheim, married A.

The Bertrand family were derived from Drogo. Drogo married Ermina. His son was : 29 Hrolf, or Robert Turstain. He was living in 920. This Robert Turstain was the potent baron \" Vir nobilis et prsepotens Torstingus \" that in A. D. 960 gave certain lands to the Abbey of St. Wand- rille (or Fontanelle), which Duke Richard I. san ctioned and confirmed By Gerlotte, his wife, daughter of Theobald, Count of Blois and Chartrcs, Robert Turstain was the father of three distinguished sons : 30 Anslech, Baron of Briquebec, 30 Onfroi, or Aunsfred, surnamed the Dane in memory of his northern origin, the sire of Turstain-Goz, and ancestor of Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, and 30 William, ancestor of the Lords of Bee Crespin, all of whose sig- natures appear on a charter A. D. 990, to the Abbey of Mount St. Michel. 80 Anslech Turstain, the first son of Robert Turstain, was Baron of Briquebec in 943, and his grandson William, Baron of Briquebec, was the first to take the name of Bertrand, from whom descended the Rus- sell family of England, Dukes of Bedford. In the rebellion of Rioulf of St, Savour against Duke William Long- sword, in A. D. 933, Anslech, Baron of Briquebec, is mentioned by Wace as one of the three barons who alone remained faithful to the Duke, by rendering him military service at the siege of Rouen ; and on the assassina- tion of that Prince he was appointed by the barons of Normandy and Bre- tagne one of the three guardians to his son. the young Duke Robert, at a crisis which required a rare union of courage, firmness and discretion, and fulfilled his trust during that long and troublous minority with infinite reputation to himself and advantage to his country. It was in the time of Anslech that the Castle of Briquebec was first erected, now one of the most beautiful and picturesque ruins in La Manche. Anslech lived to witness the accession of Duke Richard II. At his death he left two sons : 31 Turstain, Baron of Briquebec and Lord of Bastenbourg. 31 Richard, or Turstain Haralduc or Halduc ; and a daughter 31 Ertemburga, who was married in A. D. 950, to Torf de Harcourt, son of Bernard the Dane, and who became the ancestress of the Harcourt family in England. INTRODUCTION. XVlL 31 TURSTAIN DE BASTENBOURG, Baron of Briquebec, first son of Anslech Turstain, (No. 30 above), was born in La Manche, Normandy. He left at his death two sons and a daughter, viz. : 32 William Bertrand, Baron of Briquebec. 32 Hugh Cum Barba, (so denominated from wearing his beard un- shorn, which was not the regular habit of the Normans), and 32 Gisela. During the Government of Duke Richard II. she en- gaged the affections of Geroye, Lord of Montreuil and Echauffour, and became the mother of seven sons and four daughters, whence issued, says Ordenius, a race of hardy knights who were the terror of the barbarians in Apulia, Syria and Thrace. 32 WlLLIAM Bertrand, Baron of Briquebec, first son of Turstain de Bastenbourg, and first to take the name of Bertrand, was born at Bri- quebec, in La Manche, Normandy. His name occurs on a charter in 1023, of Duke Richard II., confirm- ing to the Abbey of Mount St. Michel, all the deeds and privileges granted by his predecessors, and especially those of the Duchess Gunnora, his mother, wife of Duke Richard I. In this document he is styled \"William the son of Turstain, and his name is followed by that of \" Hugh, his brother,\" and their kinsman ''Richard\" (the Viscount d'Avranches), as witnesses. William Bertrand had issue three sons : 33 Robert, surnamed Le Tort, who succeeded to the barony of Briquebec. Wife Susanna. 33 Hugh de Rozel, born about 1020, was invested with the Cast.e of Rozel about 1045. Had possessions in the isles of Guernsey and Jersey. 33 William, the third son, and a daughter 33 Emma, who married Rabel Count de Montchenseye. 32 Hugh Turstain, the Bearded, brother of William Bertrand, about 1030 obtained, by marriage of Lady Barbe de Montfort, the town and territory of Montfort, in Upper Normandy. 30 Onproi or AuNSFRED, Viscount d'Exmes, second son of Robert Tur- stain, (No. 29 above) was born at Briquebec, in La Manche, Normandy. In 1016 Richard II., Duke of Normandy, gave the county of Exmes to Aunsfred, the Dane, brother of Anslech, Baron of Briquebec. His son was : 31 TURSTAIN Goz, Viscount d'Exmes and Argentan, who was born at Exmes, in Normandy. He married Judith de Monteroliers. xviii. INTRODUCTION. Turstain Goz, succeeded to Exmes, in which he was, confirmed by the Barons during William's minority, who also made him Viscount of Argentan and Governor of the Castle of Falaise.

He was Earl of Chester, and with Hugh de Montgomerie, Earl of Shrewsbury, united his forces in resisting the inroads of the Welsh into England. The daughter of Anslech Turstain (No. 30 above) was : 31 Ertemburga, who was married A. D. 950, to 31 Tokf or ToKFlN, Seigneur de Torraille, surnamed Le Riche, who was boiTi at Schloswig, in Denmark, about A.D. 920. He wandered to the country of Greenland. \" In 1,007 a rich Greenlander, Torfin, determined to emigrate to Vin- land, (now New England.) His followers numbered 60, and he was ac- companied by his wife Gudrida, the widow of a previous explorer. Five other women were on board, and the ships were freighted with all kinds of domestic animals, tools and provisions for a permanent col- ony. Gudrida had been the first female to see the new world, having accompanied her former husband during the previous year. The ex- pedition of Thorfin prospered. The natives came in great numbers and trafficked in furs and produce. Gudrida bore a son, Snorro, the first birth of European parentage in America, who is said to have been an ancestor of the sculptor Thorwaldsen. The family remained three years in the colony, but ultimately returned, and Thorfin settled and died in Iceland. The widow made a pilgrimage to Rome in her bereavement, and died in a cloister founded by her son in Iceland. Other chiefs went to Vinland, but their history thi-ows no further light upon the colony. They, however; dis- covered land extending far away to the south-west and inhabited by natives of different caste, of darker color and more vigorous frame. The colony perished at last, destroyed probably like that of Greenland. Traces of it were found by Jesuit missionaries among the Indians Gaspe at the mouth of the St. Lawrence, a tribe which revered the symbol of the cross before the arrival of the missionaries. Physical constitution and peculiarities of man- ners and customs are also cited in confirmation of European descent. Father Charlevoix adds that ' many marks distinguishing them from other Ameri- INTRODUCTION.

She was sister of Osberne de Crepon, High Steward of Normandy, who married Avelina, and was the fa- ther of Walter Giffard, Earl of Buckingham, Eng., and daughter of Herfault, the brother of Tourode, and they were grandsons of \" Bernard the Dane.\" Osberne was assassinated at Vandreuil when sleeping in the chamber of Duke William, who was then a child. Crepon was an estate near Bayeux, Nor imandy. Of the six children of Tourode the eldest was : 33 Onproy or HuMPHROl DE Velutis, Count of Pont Audemer.

Hastings,, at the head of a band of Northmen, sacked Bordeaux, Lisbon and Seville •; defeated the Moorish conquerors of Spain at Cordova ; crossed the Straits. into Morocco ; repassed them ; overran Tuscany ; returned to France, where other chieftains had had various success against Charles the Bald, and em- braced Christianity. (See Hastings.) His name, the most dreaded of all the Vikings, was adopted by many successors. With safe winter quarters, in Spain, they extended their ravages to Naples, Sicily and the coasts of the Greek Empire. Anarchy, meanwhile, prevailing in France, in the autumn of 885 they laid siege to Paris. After a year the siege was converted into a blockade, but at last King Charles the Fat, bought off the Northmen with 700 pounds of silver and a free passage to the Upper Seine and Burgundy. The most redoubtable of the Northmen afterward was Hrolf, better known as Rollo, chieftain, of Norwegian parentage, first Duke of Normandy, and direct ancestor, in the sixth generation, of William the Conqueror. In the words of Snorro Sturleson : \"He was so mighty of stature that there was no horse of strength and size to bear him. He was therefore always on foot, and was called the Marcher/' He ravaged Friesland and the countries, watered by the Schieldt, and took Rouen, St. Le Bayeux and Evreux_ From Charles the Simple he accepted the hand of a daughter, together with a tract of Neustrian territory north of the Seine, from Andalye to the sea (modern Normandy), in exchange for Christian baptism and an oath of fealty (912). Thus was arrested the Scandinavian flood which had devastated France for more than a century. Rollo distributed among his followers the XX11. INTRODUCTION. lands of Neustria, to be held of him as Duke of Normandy. Thus were laid the foundations of the feudal system which William (7th Duke) trans- planted into England (1066-87). Few external traces of the Scandinavians are to be found in modern Normandy. Yet for a time the Scandinavian gods divided with the Saviour the religious reverence of the people of that country. Monasteries and cathedrals were built, however, with what extent and magnificence their splendid remains attest. The Normans adopted the language of the vanquished province, but greatly modified it. It was the langue d'oni (the langue d'oc being south of the Loire), which became under Norman inspiration the peculiar medium of romantic poetry. 32 THORFIN, The Dane, or Torkill of Richmondshire Baron, Lord of Tanfield, founder of the WASHINGTON FAMILY in England, fourth son of Sigurd, (No. 31 above), Earl of the Orkney Isles, was born about A. D. 1000. He was Jarl or Earl of the Island of Orkney, that was held as a feif, under the Kings of Denmark. These Earls were Sigurd, son of Eisten Glumru; Einar, son of Rogvald, Jarl or Earl of Moere ; Torfidur, son of above Einar ; Lodver, son of Torfi- dur ;• Sigurd, son of Lodver ; and Einar and Thorfin, sons of Sigurd. They were called Lords OF THE ISLES. The present Duke of Argyle is descended from them.

That, Columbus did not discover America, everybody who believes in the traditions of the Indians, that go to show an Asiatic descent of the gentle savage, is compelled to own. But who discovered these descend- ants of the East, after their wanderings, is a question that promises to prove far more agitating than the vital one of what constitutes the \"American drama.\" Assuming that the original inhabitants of the American continent forced their way from the East through the icy regions of the North, and by way of Behring's Straits (as all scientific men assume, they being agreed that man sprung up in the East and found his way to the West), the question now is, who discovered their progeny on this continent? Until a very few years ago the people of the temperate and torrid zones were quite agreed that one Christopher Columbus, a Genoese voyager, was that person. These people took no heed of the Phoenician, Greek, Welsh, and Irish claims, and as they knew little and cared less for the Scandinavian literature, did not apprehend the cropping up of an- other and more formidable claimant than had yet appeared, from the icy North. It will be seen, therefore, that from such a diversity of demands, nearly all of which seem genuine, it will be rather difficult to select the XXiv. INTRODUCTION. justest, and settle the matler in an agreeable manner to all concerned. In the first place, it is maintained that the Greek philosopher Pythias tra- versed the Atlantic Ocean 340 B. C, and discovered the different length of days in different climates. It is also well known that the Phoenicians colonized the Canary Isles, and, it is said, these bold sailors pushed their way to the West and found this continent ages ago. The Welsh declare that one of their ancestors, named Madoc, settled here in 1322, one hun- dred and seventy years before Columbus landed. Ninety-one years before this, a Norseman was driven on the coast, and found people who appeared to him to speak Irish, although he did not understand that language. The Norsemen themselves, whose claims we are about to examine, insist that America was accidentally discovered in the year 986 by Bjarne Her- julfson, who did not land, although he came near the land three times, first, where the present Nantucket stands, second, at Nova Scotia, and the third time at Newfoundland. When Bjarne went home to Norway two or three years later, and recounted his strange adventures, he was censured by his chief for not banding and exploring the strange land. Still, what he had done was sufficient to arouse Leif Erikson, son of the Jarl, and he determined to find what kind of regions these were that were so much talked about. He bought Bjarne's ship, selected a crew, and found the land just as had been described. They landed at Newfound- land and Nova Scotia, then sailed South, and entered the bay now known as Mount Hope Bay. Here they resolved to spend the winter, and built a large house. There was a captive German in the party named Tryker, who had become a great favorite with Leif Erikson. One day he was missing, and great was Leif s sorrow, for he feared some disaster had be- fallen his friend ; but the German was descried toward evening coming home in a most excited state, singing and shouting, and bearing in his hands bunches of grapes. On his arrival, he continued shouting and singing in German, which greatly increased the wonder of his auditors, who did not understand that language. At length he explained to them that he found grapes growing even as they grew in Germany, upon which information Leif promptly christened the place Vinland. This was that part of the country now known as Massachusetts, the year was 1000, and the Sagas insist that Leif Erikson was the first pale-faced man who plant- ed his feet on this continent. These Sagas of the Norsemen, the contents INTRODUCTION. XXV. of which are now becoming gradually known to reading men, promise to revolutionize many of the old theories the world has held to. In the spring Leif returned to Greenland, and there found his brother Thorwald, who declared, after listening to his story, that the land had not been half explored. So he started out in 1002 and remained in Vinland three years. At the end of that time he was killed by a Skraslling (Indian), and buried there. He was the first Christian and first white man that died and was buried in America, and it is now declared that the skeleton in armor found in Fall River, Mass., in 1831, and made famous in Longfellow's poem, was no other than the bold explorer, Thorwald Erikson, who was killed by Indians A. D. 1005. When the Norsemen had buried their chief they at once returned to Greenland. The same year, the Sagas tell us, Thorstein, youngest brother to Leif and Thorwald, fitted out a vessel, manned it with twenty-five men, selected for their strength and stature, and accompanied by his wife Gudrid, a most remarkable woman, set out for the new land ; but they met with tempestuous weather, and during all the summer were tossed about on the deep, and driven they knew not where. At length they made Lysefjord, on the coast of Greenland. Here Thorstein and several of his men died, and Gudrid returned home. The next year Gudrid married Thorfinn Karlsefne, a wealthy and influen- tial person, who, through her persuasions, was induced to fit out an ex- pedition for Vinland. This party consisted of one hundred and fifty-one men and seven women, and, unlike prior excursions, started fully equipped, and resolved on colonization. It was provided with cattle and sheep, and arrived safely. Here the party remained for three years, until hostilities with the Skrsellings compelled them to give up the colony. The Sagas give full accounts of Thcrfinn's enterprises in Vinland, about the traffic with the Skrsellings ; and about the development of the colony. They also record the interesting fact, that a son was born to Thorfinn and Gudrid, a year after the colony was settled, who was named Snorre Thorfinnson. He was born in the present State of Massachusetts, in the year 1008, and was the first man of European blood of whose birth in America we have any record. From him the famous sculptor Albert Thorwaldsen is lineally descended, beside a long train of learned and distinguished men, who have flourished during the last eight centuries in Iceland and Denmark. The author of \" America not discovered by XXVI. INTRODUCTION. Columbus \" calls attention to the Dighton Writing Rock Inscription in the Taunton River (which has been translated, \" Thorfinn, with one hun- dred and fifty-one Norse sea-faring men took possession of this land \"), and says, that this inscription removes all doubt of the presence of Thor- finn and the Norsemen in the Taunton River in the beginning of the eleventh century. The Sagas give elaborate accounts of other expeditions that took place in ion and in 1121, when Bishop Erik Upsi went as a mis- sionary to Vinland. There were other expeditions that went as far south as Florida. The last expedition made by them was in the year 1347, the 3rear the Black Plague started in Europe. This Plague spread over Europe, and at length reached Vinland, and cut off communication be- tween the two countries. It reduced the population of Norway from 2,000,000 to 300,000. and left no surplus for expeditions. Thus the New World remained until Columbus visited it in 1492. It is believed that Columbus knew of these voyages of the Norsemen. Fifteen years before he sailed for America, lie was in Iceland, and undoubtedly was made familiar with the Norsemen's expedition, and the reason why he should know of them, was the visit of Gudrid to Rome,* after the death of her husband. Rome at that time took great interest in geographical discov- eries, and took pains to collect all charts and reports that were brought in. The Romans might have heard of Vinland before, but Gudrid brought them personal evidence. That Vinland was known to the Vati- can, is proved by the fact that Pope Pasch?.! II., in the year 1112, sent Erik Upsi, as Bishop, to Iceland, Greenland, and Vinland. Recent de- velopments also prove that Columbus had the opportunity to see the map of Vinland in the Vatican, and it would appear, indeed, strange that with his nautical knowledge, he would not, in the age of discovery and literary activity in which he lived, have heard as much as he did. Beside all this, there is another fact which goes to shew that Columbus knew of this con- tinent. Adam, of Bremen, a canon and historian of high authority, visited and described the North of Europe, and Iceland and Greenland. Having given an account of these countries, he says, \"beside these there is an- other region which has been visited by man)', lying in that ocean (the Atlantic), which is called Vinland, where vines grow spontaneously, and where corn springs up without being sown. This we know, not by fabu- lous conjecture, but from positive statements of the Danes.\" This book * See page xviii. INTRODUCTION. XXvii. was printed in 1073, and, as it was read by all educated men, must have been read in time by Columbus. He says himself that he based his conviction that there was land in the West on the authority of learned writers. Another evidence that he was certain of finding land, after he had \" sailed seven hundred leagues,\" was his promise given to his mutinous crew when they insisted upon turning back, that if land did not appear in three days he would do as they desired. The land appeared, and here is a subject quite as interesting as the question, \"Who wrote Shakespeare?\" It can be decided by anybody who will read up in Scandinavian litera- ture. It is certain that the Iceland rovers who settled in Greenland explored the coast of New England down to Rhode Island. In their intercourse with the Skrcellinger (Esquimaux) these Danes learned that \"farther southward, beyond Chesapeake Ba)7, there dwelt white men, who clothed themselves in long white garments, carried before them poles to which cloths were attached, and called with a loud voice.\" In the Sagas, the history of Thorhnn Karlsefne, and the famous chronicle, the Landnama- bok, this country is styled the \" Land of the White Men \" (Hvitramanna- land). The Landnama Book says : \" To the south of inhabited Greenland are wild and desert tracts and ice-covered mountains ; then comes the land of the Skneliings (Esquimaux), beyond this Markland (Nova Scotia),. and then Vinland the Good (Massachusetts and southwards). Next to this, and somewhat behind it, lies Albania, that is to say, Hvitramanna- land, whit he?' vessels formerly sailed from Ireland. It was there that several Irishmen and Icelanders recognized Ari, the son of Mar and Katla of Reykjanes, whom they had not for a long time had any tidings of, and whom the natives of the country had made their chief.\" The Landnama- bok also states that Ari Marsson was driven by a tempest to Hvitraman- naland, and detained and baptized there. The Northmen are reputed to have received their account of Hvitramannaland, which was also called Irland it Mikla (Ireland the great) from Limerick traders, vessels from that port having sailed thither before the Icelandic discover)'- of Vinland. (Compare Rafu, Antiquit. A??ier., 203, 206, 211, 446, 451 ; and Wilhelmi, Ueber Island, &c, &c, s. 75, 81.) This Ari Marsson, referred to above, was of t'ac race of Ulf the Squint-eyed, a heathen family of great influence in Iceland. It is the opinion of some, indeed, that the earliest settle- XXV111. INTRODUCTION. ments of Iceland were made from Irland it Mikla, the first chronicles and Sagas speaking of \"west men who had come across the sea.\" In Sir Richard Grenville's voyage to Roanoke he found natives, who, as he claimed, saluted him in the purest Erse or Gaelic, calling out to him hao, hui, iach. Owen Chapelain, who in 1669 was captured by the Tuscaroras, saved himself when they were about to scalp him by address- ing them in Gaelic. They did not understand his words, but were familiar with the sounds of his language. Gallatin says that the language of these Tuscaroras is a branch of the Iroquois dialect. But this singular tribe of Indians, all of whom are white, and many of them blue-eyed, •could scarcely be akin to the dark Iroquois. Catlin is strongly inclined to think them a mixed race, and believes them to be the descendants of the Welsh prince Madoc, son of Owen Gwinneth, who voyaged westward in 1170. Humboldt is quite inclined to think with Catlin. He says in a note to Cosmos: \"Although no connection of language has yet been proved, I by no means wish to deny that the Basques and the people of Celtic origin inhabiting Ireland and Wales, who were early engaged in fisheries on the most remote coasts, may have been the constant rivals of the Scandinavians in the northern parts of the Atlantic, and even that the Irish preceded the Scandinavians in the Faroe Islands and in Iceland. It is much to be desired that in our days, when a sound and severe spirit of criticism, devoid of a character of contempt, prevails, the old investi- gations of Powell and Richard Hacklu)rt ( Voyages and Navigations, vol. iii., p. 4) might be resumed in England and Ireland.\" This Thorfinn Karlsefne was Torf or Torfinn, Seigneur de Torraille, surnamed \" Le Riche,\" (see page xviii.,) born about A. D. 920, whose father was \" Bernard the Dane,\" Governor and Regent in Normandy, (see page xix.) under Rollo, with whom he received baptism at Rouen, A. D. ■912. The first wife of Thorfinn Karlsefne was Ertemburga, (married A. D. 950,) daughter of Anslich Turstin, Baron of Briquebec, son of Hrolf or Robert Turstin, Baron, whose father was Hrollagur, or Drogo, the son of Rogvald, Jarl or Earl Moere, A. D. 885, and he was the father of .another son, Einar, Jarl or Earl of the Orkneys, whose son, Torfidui, Earl of the Orkneys, A. D. 942, was father of Lodvar, Earl of the Ork- neys, whose son, Sigurd, also Earl of the Orkneys, was the father of Thorfin, ancestor of the Washington Family in England. td^ -p t-T s ? td tu- ts, w CD 51 -P b H ^ W Crt 2 H w > 0 1— 1 a 2 * 1-1 w H ■3 » o 2> cd ^ ^§§ cd D<| 1-1 £ <j ••a S> 3 cd 2. td ^ 3 ►a' p II 2 o H C M p 1-1. £ o- J* & c £5. b P • » \" o W *> H W g W w > vO en O £3 o G -• W i_3- O 2. 2 ^> CD ►-< P ss O P .

It has been annunciated by authors and others that the great-grand- father of George Washington was John Washington of Bridge's Creek, West- moreland Co., Va., who emigrated to America about 1657, and that the great-grandfather of said John was Lawrence Washington, sometime Mayor of Northampton, and the first lay proprietor of the Manor of Sulgrave, in Northamptonshire, which was granted to him in 1538. Also that Lawrence, brother of John above, had studied at Oxford, and John had resided on an estate at South Cave, in Yorkshire, a circumstance that gave rise to the erroneous tradition that the family sprang from that region. The above, partly suppositious, has been copied over and over again by writers, and being without dates, seems to defy contradiction. The lack of dates has occasioned all the inferences, which are errors. The following is the correct pedigree or line of descent from father to son, from 32.— 1 \" THORFIN THE DANE,\" thirty-second generation from Odin, who had two sons : 2 BODIN, born at Ravenswath, York, about A.

T HE Family of Washington was founded in England by I THORFIN THE DANE, whose ancestors came from Schleswig, in Denmark, and settled in ancient Ebor or Yorkshire, prior to the Norman conquest. The name of \" Washington \" was derived from a village juxta Ravenswarth, called originally, \" Wessyngton.\" The name is of Saxon origin, and it existed in England prior to the Norman conquest. The village \" Wassyng- ton \" is mentioned in a Saxon charter, as granted by King Edgar in 973, to Thornby Abbey. — Collectanea Typograph- ical vol. 4, p. 55. This village is now called \" Wharlton,\" and is in the parish of Kirk by Ravensworth, in the North Riding of Yorkshire. This Torfin was a great man, of Danish-Scandinavian descent, as were all of the great men of these parts. FROM THE DOMESDAY SURVEY, 1070-1080. \" In Bcnningham, Torfin had a hall and 2 carucates of land of the Geld, and 2 ploughs, held by Enisan of the 2 WASHINGTON. Earl.' The whole 2 leagues in length, and 1 in breadth ; and underwood, 1 league in length, and a half in breadth.\" \" In Laton, Torfin had 3 carucates of the Geld, with sack and soke, and there were 3 ploughs, held by Bodin his son, of the Earl. In the time of King Edward the Confessor, it was 1 league in length, and 1 in breadth.\" \" In Stannigges, Torfin had 3 carucates of land, with sack and soke, and 3 ploughs, now Enisan holds of the Earl in demesne, 1 carucate and 3 villains, with 2 ploughs. In the time of King Edward, the whole was half a league in length, and a half in breadth.\" \" In Ravenswarth of the Geld are 12 carucates of land and 8 ploughs. There Torfin had one manor. Now Bodin holds there, half a carucate, and 16 villains, and 4 borders, with 8 ploughs. There is a church there, and a priest, and 4 acres of meadow. The whole was 1 league in length, and a half broad, temp. Edward the Confessor.\" The above is from \" Domesday Book,\" and is a transla- tion of that portion respecting the North Riding in York- shire, including the district of Wharleton alias Washington, about 1070 to 1080. Two sons of Torfin were : 2 Bodin, born in Ravensworth, Yorkshire, about 1040. 2 BARDOLF, \" \" \" \" 1045. \" In Malsonby and Diddaston bailiwick of the Geld, 11 carucates and 10 ploughs.

Manor of Aske. Bodin and Bardolf have been mentioned as the sons of Eudo de Bayeux, Earl of Britanny, and therefore derived from the ancestor of the Earls of Richmond, England. This error arose from the supposition, that William the Con- queror confiscated all of the lands of the Englishmen, and gave them to his followers. This is not true, as he confis- cated only the lands of a few rebels, which he divided into Baronies, and gave them to his leaders. Being too vast for occupation by single persons, they were sub-let to Knights and Vassals, and oftentimes to the previous tenants. The Saxon Earl, Edwin of Mercia, after he had revolted \" over and over again,\" when he died without issue, the Conqueror was much grieved at the loss of so great a lord, and it was only because the Earl Edwin died without issue, that William the Conqueror gave his lands to Alan, first Earl of Richmond, who was second cousin to William I. The 174 manors given to Earl Alan by the Conqueror — one of which was the manor of Ravensworth, held by Tor- fin and his son Bodin, — were only so many shadows in the hands of the Earl. There were only about 6 manors really attached to the Earldom of Richmond. Of all the others, lie was merely nominally chief lord, and each was held by 4 WASHINGTON. an owner whose ancestors held for many generations before the Conquest. There was never in Richmondshire, above six families descended from Norman ancestors, and these ac- quired their lands by marrying heiresses. 2 Bodin, \" the Monk of Richmondshire,\" was born at Ra- vensworth, Yorkshire, Eng., about 1040. He was son of \"Torfin the Dane.\" Bodin had issue, a son : 3 Alet fil Bodin, born in Richmondshire about year 1070. Bodin, Lord of Ravensworth, at the time of the compi- lation of the survey of the lands belonging to the King's Geld, called \"Domesday Book,\" held Ravensworth, York- shire, of Alan Rufus, first Earl of Richmond, who held of the king. This Bodin gave all his estate to his brother Bardolf, and retired to the monastery of York, where he assumed the religious habit. 2 BARDOLF, \" Lord and Monk of Ravensworth,\" was born about 1045. He was second son of Torfin the Dane. Bardolf possessed Ravensworth with divers other fair lordships in Richmondshire, in the time of King William the Conqueror, but, desiring in his age, to end his days in the devout service of God, forsook the world, and, with his brother Bodin, took upon him the habit of a monk of the Abbey of St. Marie's at York. Whereunto, at the especial instance of Bodin, he gave the churches of Patrick-Brompton and Ravensworth, in pure Almes. To this Bardolf succeeded his son and heir : 3 AKARIS, Lord of Ravensworth, born at Ravens- worth, about year 1080. He had another son : 3 Henry, Lord of Ravensworth, born at Ravensworth, about year 1090. \" The manor of Eggington, Derbyshire, was held at Doomsday Survey, by Azelm, under Geffrey de Alselyn, or Aseline. Bardolf married the heiress of Hanselyn, of WASHINGTON. 5 this baronial family, and she carried the manor to the Bar- dolfs.\" — Valor Ecclesciasticus. 3 Alet fil Bodin, son of Bodin, son of Torfin the Dane, was born in Richmondshire, England, about 1070. Alet, son of Bodin, held 3 carucates of land at Bradwell in Essex. — Testa de Neville, p. 268. He had issue : 4 Walter Bardolf, born in Richmondshire, about 1130, and William de Bradwell, •about 1135. Walter Bardolf, son of Alet, dropped out of the Pedi- gree by Dugdale, was born about 1130. He is referred to in the Abbre Plact, 88th page. At the assize Hugo, his son, claimed Manton Priory, that had been given to the priors. He is styled as of the county of York. 3 Henry fil Bardolf, second son of Bardolf, second son of \" Torfin the Dane,\" was born at Ravensworth, county York, about 1090. 3 AKARIS or Akar, or Akary, called also Akary fil Bar- dolf, or Fitz Bardolph, Lord of Ravensworth, born about 1080, first son of Bardolf, Lord and Monk of Ravensworth, in Richmondshire, second son of \"Torfin the Dane.\" \" And Bardolf, whose son Akar was the pious founder of 'Jourvaulx,' a famous Abbey of the Cisterian order in the Northern Tract.\" \" To this Bardolf succeeded Akaris, his son and heir, who in 5 Stephen, 1139, founded an Abbey at Fors, in Wens- lay-dale in Com. Ebor, then called the ' Abbey of Charity/ He departed this life in Ann. 1161, 7 Henry II.\" Dugdale'' s Baronage., vol. 1, p. 403. He gave 3 carucates of land in Wharton, and 1 carucate and a half in Fors, to the abbey, where he was buried, leaving nine sons, of whom only five are mentioned : 4 Hervey Fitz Akaris, born at Kirkby Ravensworth, about 1 1 20. 4 Walter fil Akaris, born at Kirkby Ravensworth, about 1 122. 6 WASHINGTON. 4 Robert fil Akery de Ashton, born at Kirkby Ra- vensworth, about 1125. 4 Heresculfus fil Akery, born at Kirkby Ravens- worth, about 1 127. 4 Bondo Fitz Akaris, born at Kirkby Ravensworth, about 1 130. \" Akaris was one of the great Vassals of Stephen, Earl of Richmond, and, as such, appears upon the great Pipe Rolls in 1st Henry 2 (1154). He was the father of Hervey fil Akary, who was Lord of Ravensworth, and ancestor of the Lords Fitz Hugh of that place, and of Bondo, Lord Si Oual- sington, juxta Ravensworth, which was given to him by his father, temp. King Stephen.\" HISTORY OF JOREVAULX ABBEY. \" In the time of King Stephen (1134 to n 54) Akeris son of Bardolph, and Nephew of Boden, (says Dugdale, in the Monasticon), was Lord of many possessions in Yorkshire. Having given to Peter de Quinciano one Carucate and a half of Land in Waunleysdale at Fors, called Dela- grange, and three Carucates in Warton, where the said Peter and his -Companions began to found an Abbey, and to erect simple edifices for their habitations, in a. d. 1145. This was afterward made subject to the Abbey of Byland, from which— A. D. 1150, an Abbot and twelve Monks were sent, who, a. d. 1166, on account of the poorness of the land and bad air were removed with consent of Hervius (or Hervey) son of Akaris, their original founder, to a pleasant valley upon the river Eure in East Witton, given to them by Conan, Duke of Brittany and Earl of Rich- mond, taking the bones of their founder, Akeris, and his wife, along with them. Their first Abbot John De Kingston, then began to build a church {dedicated to St. Mary) and called it Jourvaix.\" — Dugdale 's Monasticon, vol. 5, p. 569. CHARTER.
