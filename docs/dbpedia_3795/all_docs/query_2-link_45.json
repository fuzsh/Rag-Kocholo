        "text": "Brittany Vessely\n\nExecutive Director\n\nBrittany Vessely is executive director of the Colorado Catholic Conference (CCC) and the Catholic representative board member for Pro-Life Colorado, the nonprofit coalition of over 50 pro-life organizations in Colorado seeking to build a culture of life and defeat abortion initiatives. Brittany also serves on the American Enterprise Institute’s Initiative on Faith and Public Life Council in Washington, D.C., is a member of the National Association of State Catholic Conference Directors (NASCCD) and is a member of the Philadelphia Society.\n\nPrior to joining the CCC, Brittany was founding executive director of Catholic Education Partners, a national Catholic education and school choice policy nonprofit launched by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) in 2016. Brittany also previously served as director of state policy for the Friedman Foundation for Education Choice (EdChoice) in Indianapolis, IN and conducted domestic policy research at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., focusing on education, welfare, religious liberty, and family policy.\n\nShe is an alumna of The John Jay Institute fellowship, Claremont Institute Publius fellowship, The Heritage Foundation graduate fellowship in Welfare Studies, and participated in Liberty Fund colloquia on John Dewey’s education philosophy and on the Federalist and Anti-Federalist. Brittany is a graduate of Colorado Christian University, with Bachelor of Arts in both Politics and Social Science with emphases in Psychology and Biblical Studies, and is completing her Master of Arts in Philosophy with a concentration in Ethics at Holy Apostles College and Seminary in Cromwell, CT.\n\nBrittany resides in Denver with her husband and three children.\n\nWilliam Waters\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nThe child in the womb is a human being created in the image of God. Abortion is the premeditated murder of a child. There is no proof of the non-humanity of the baby in the womb. Why should Colorado Law provide incentives to murder children? Pro-choice people have to deny all good common sense to reason that a child is not human in the womb.\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nGod created marriage between a man and woman.\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\nThis idea is a direct attack to our freedom under the First Amendment. If we allow this to become law, then all of our freedoms will be gone forever. We would be living under tyrannical government.\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nWe must not empower the professional or generational or lifetime welfare recipient. There should be a way out of welfare system that allows people to save up monies to improve their circumstances, to find housing, and to save for the major needs of life, not lock people into a system of dependency on government handouts. The welfare system punishes the very people it is to help by regulations that stops any self-improvement. I will work to make pathways off of welfare and to a prosperous life.\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nWe must put people first. Patient or Provider, they are individuals’ who have value and propose in-and-of themselves. Government must not use the health-care system to infringe on the rights or privacy of people.\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nNo. Under current law, Legal immigrants are required to show that they can support themselves before they enter the United States. If the legislators put this into law, it would draw illegal immigrants and drain the resources for our schools and hospitals as it has already done in communities across the nation. The State of Colorado does not have endless tax dollars. Colorado legislators should uphold current immigration laws, not undermine them. There is a legal pathway to all who lawfully into this nation. As a legislator I will work to improve immigration laws and I will support immigrants who come here legally.\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nI would support families in using their 529 savings to educate their children and their choice of which schools to attend.\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nWhile this idea may sound good and noble, it ignores human nature of the heart. This idea is already in practice across the nation, with very little success, recidivism rates are 80% or higher. I was twenty-five years in the Denver Sheriff and this topic was the goal of many various community programs. But rehabilitation is an individual heart issue, a person must want and seek diligently rehabilitation with their whole heart. As your legislator I will support incarcerated people who want real help in rehabilitating themselves, and I will support private organizations and charities who work with people that want to re-enter society. But government programs have failed repeatedly in rehabilitation because the program is a one size fits all, and never looks at the spiritual issues a person is struggling with.\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nI will support legislation that promotes private investment and competition in the energy sector of Colorado. I am for protecting our environment from the drilling site to the gas pumps, to our homes for lights, heat and air-conditioning and to the many businesses and manufactures in our State of Colorado with the lowest possible price. I oppose the polices of shutting down our energy sector for the pollical agenda of the radial environmental advocates who has created policies that in-turn created the so-called energy crises. If the current administration would allow our oil and gas production, we would not have an energy crisis. The Idea of environmentally friendly policy is not the goal of these radicals. Their goal is to destroy the domestic energy industry. These radicals want control above all else. Destroying the energy industry helps them achieve such control.\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nPornography harms everyone it touches, and it dehumanizes women and children.\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\nMy goals are to protect the innocence of our children. Radical members of our communities are looking to corrupt our most vulnerable. They seek to murder our children in the womb or corrupt them with sexual promiscuity. In the legislature I will fight to protect our children from the exploitation of radical sex and gender indoctrination. I will fight to empower parents, not teachers to make decisions on their children’s mental, physical, and spiritual well-being and hold those that circumvent a parent’s rights are punished to the full extent of the law. I will fight to ensure that schools are completely transparent with the parents of the students. Our state needs men of God to stand against the invasion of worldly evils praying on our children. I believe that God has called me to be one of these men. I hope to have your support on November 8th.\n\nTim Walsh\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nAny changes should be by the vote of the people. I think everyone can agree that late term abortions should only be allowed if the life of the mother is in question.\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nShouldn’t marriage be done at the local level and in churches if they are religious? Therefore I don’t think we need a state law.\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\n​​These individual rights are protected by the 1st Amendment. The role of government is to support and defend our individual rights, especially 1st Amendment rights.\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nI believe that free enterprise is the best solution for developing innovations. Incentives distorts the markets and picks winners and losers. Private enterprise has always developed better solutions versus government meddling. Affordable, clean, and abundant energy enables everything in modern life and has lifted billions out of poverty. Transitioning rapidly to “clean” renewable energy will lead to scarcity, hardship and poverty. It will also hurt our most vulnerable population the most.\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nAs immoral as pornography is, it is not the proper role of government to restrict pornography. Free people need a moral compass only derived from a foundation in a faith. God gave people free will to test their faith. It would be difficult to create legislation against every sin.\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\nI deeply love our country and Colorado. I have served my country in combat and have seen the evil that tyrannical and Godless governments have imposed on their people. Our greatness comes from recognizing that God, not government or rulers, gave us our rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Along with this and the self-evident understanding that we are all created equal has unleashed human potential. I will be a servant leader who will bring principled and common-sense solutions to the State Capitol so that people and businesses can thrive and become the best version of themselves. There are many challenges that I am ready to take on to improve public safety, tackle homelessness, mental health and alcohol/drug addiction (working with faith based org), and reduce the cost of housing, healthcare, and energy.\n\nStephanie Vigil\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nI believe RHEA was for the best, given that the Dobbs decision sent the decision on reproductive choice back to the states. Coloradans don’t believe in the government policing our bodies or bedrooms. There are in fact several types of healthcare providers for whom we are short-staffed in Colorado, to include psychiatrists and therapists, dentists and oral surgeons, and even primary care providers in rural parts of the state. If this also becomes the case for reproductive health providers, whether they prescribe/perform abortion services or not, I would be open to attracting providers the same as we would to fill any other need.\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nYes, I believe in marriage equality. Love and devotion make a family.\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\nThis is difficult to accurately answer without a little unpacking. I believe you’re asking if the government should restrict the freedom to worship and live according to one’s conscience, and no, I don’t believe it should. Actions by institutions get a little more complicated, depending on whether we’re talking about private, public, non-profit, or for-profit entities. “Think, speak, work, and act” also covers a wide range of possible experiences and activities. I would never advocate for anyone’s beliefs or personal expression to be infringed – religious, spiritual, or otherwise. At some point though, there are reasonable contraints on how we treat each other in a pluralist and diverse society, and when the issue arises, I cannot support using personal belief as a justification for cruel or discriminatory behavior towards others.\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nI believe wholeheartedly in harm reduction, housing first, and prioritizing caring support over punitive action. As far as encouraging work, I can’t imagine any facet of American society not doing just that. For good or for ill, the expectation to work is a pretty deep-seated value in our culture. Ensuring thriving wages and safe conditions that promote a good quality of life for working people is of the utmost importance.\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nPatient centered care is absolutely crucial. Healthcare is a basic and non-negotiable human need, and should be protected as a right. Protecting the conscience rights of medical providers is a bit more of a gray area to me. Certainly no one should be forced to perform procedures they’re opposed to, but neither should patients go into a medical situation expecting a certain type of care and finding out too late that they won’t be accommodated. There should always be options for patients to receive the care they believe is right for themselves, regardless of their insurance carrier or who’s in-network.\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nDefinitely, and I’m proud to be endorsed by the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition for my positions on immigration justice. We live on the ancestral homelands of the Ute, Arapahoe, and Cheyenne peoples, and have been populated over the years by migration both from all over this country, and from outside of it. This diversity is an asset and a blessing, and should not be suppressed by draconian immigration laws.\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nI’m inclined to say no, but I’m open to some kind of path to accommodate financing options for families who value a religious education for their own children. My primary concern is that accounts of this kind are tax-advantaged, and we already have a growing problem with public funds being diverted to religious education, and I greatly value protecting separation of church and state – to safeguard everyone’s religious freedom.\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nA thousand times over, yes. The threat of punishment does not influence human behavior the way that our system claims it does. A more human-centered and evidence-based approach will serve us better, promoting both public safety and the protection of offenders’ and suspects’ right to due process. Law enforcement officers who abuse their power or mistreat ordinary citizens should be held accountable.\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nDefinitely, and nearly every venue by which we can decarbonize and get to a regenerative energy economy, we should take. I would love to see residents and builders in El Paso County make more use of C-PACE now that our county has opted in, and I will ensure that our state leverages available federal funds to continue leading the nation on meeting climate goals.\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nNo. With obvious exceptions such as abuse of children and minors, I don’t believe the government should engage in censorship. It’s a personal choice whether or not to view sexually explicit material.\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\nI’d like to thank you for your thoughtful questions. While I am non-religious myself, I’ve found that I share significant overlap in humanist values with people of several faith traditions: welcoming the stranger, supporting the poor, and sharing resources equitably to make our society more just. Unfortunately there are some authoritarian figures among us who wield their religious convictions in a way that threatens the freedoms of others, and it is only when these threats arise that I find myself at odds with those of religious faith. I can confidently promise your members that I cherish your right to worship every bit as much as my own right to refrain, and that we will find plenty of worthy goals to work toward cooperatively.\n\nRob Stutz\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nMy person feeling aside, I do not believe it is the responsibility of a free government to impose any law in which its dominant guidance comes from ones personal religious teachings. Although OI believe it is the independent right of any pregnant woman to choose her path, I do not believe it is responsible for the government of all people to motivate actions one way or another.\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nAs much as I would like to leave the personal lives of individual citizens to themselves, it has become evident that many groups cannot refrain from forcing their sediments on other and there for a persons freedom to choose must be protected.\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\nI believe to truly respect the freedom of speech, one must respect the freedom of all speech. Even that speech which may make your blood boil.\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nWelfare should provide a net to catch someone and help them stand up, but should not be a life long income system that promotes stagnation.\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nBut in doing so, the medical providers should severe all ties and benefits form governmental programs that are paid into by all citizens. No one should benefit from the treating only certain people when their compensation comes from the taxes of all.\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nI believe that the government should not prevent willing people from working and should provide a clear pathway to citizenship. However, I do not believe it is the responsibility of the government to provide any mnore basic needs than we provide our own citizens.\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nThe funding systems for public education needs work. Less than 40% of the money gathered by taxes for education actually reach the children. The administrative mis-management would never be allowed in a true business environment so yes, parents should not have to spent taxed money to make up the difference.\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nUntil greater attention is truly given to determining why people are committing crimes, then the focus of rehabilitation is moot.\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nIf the foundation for the development and use of more environmentally friendly sources cannot be articulated on their own merits, why should it be seen as just to have the state financially motivate people to do so?\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nIt is not the responsibility of the government to set moral boundaries. these are personal issues between private citizens.\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\nI believe that I am a responsible choice to represent all of the constituents in my district, not just those of a particular faith. I believe it is my responsibility to listen to as many voters s reach out to me and follow that guidance. In the absence of such direction, I should support the individual rights. I imagine that many catholics may choose not to vote for me on the grounds that my primary moral guidance is the constitution rather than the Bible and I will support that choice. But if a catholic believes that ones religious positions should not be involved in ones political involvement, please consider me.\n\nLe Sellers\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nWe must ask whether the life of a child is as important as his mother’s convenience. Unless her pregnancy is a direct and imminent threat to her life, he should not be in any danger of losing his own.\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\nWith ever-increasing numbers of laws and regulations, are we more or less free today, free to express the thoughts that make us human beings, agents to act, rather than being things to be acted upon? The difference between animals and human beings, aside from our being God’s children, is that we can think and make conscious decisions. To hinder in any way one’s ability to express those opinions and choices is to deny our humanity.\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nWhy does government arrogate unto itself the power to take whatever it deems necessary from the people who create wealth to give it to others who do little to make others better off? The truly needy, those who face serious challenges, need our help, but using the power of the government to make this happen does not put the needy in a better position; few rise from poverty because of welfare. The vast majority of our safety net is and must be charity, not welfare. Both giver and recipient benefit from charity; only bureaucrats and politicians benefit from welfare. Charity ennobles the human spirit in myriad ways; welfare weakens and destroys mankind in each of those ways. Charity is better in all ways, and it works better, as well.\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nI worry about turning over control of health care to any government. Bureaucrats and politicians have no vested interest in health outcomes. Blindly applying a “rule book” to cases always results in health care failures. Patients and their health care providers should be free of any bureaucratic constraints when determining how to approach that patient’s care.\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nI am greatly concerned about the dangers faced by illegal immigrants who travel the thousands of miles from their homes to come to an uncertain future in America. Immigration, per se, is a federal issue. Colorado has the responsibility to protect her citizens first, last, and always. Guests who enter by the door have a legitimate expectation of compassion, but those who break in though a window should be politely shown that door and told to follow the law and common courtesy by requesting permission to enter.\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nEducational freedom for the children’s benefit is their parents’ right, and parents, as the primary responsible parties for their children’s education, must have the ultimate control over when, where, how, what, and by whom those children are taught. Who controls the purse strings controls the outcome; 539 programs return that control to parents. In addition, however, parents must be equal partners in defining the curriculum used in the classroom.\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nThe working class and the poor cannot hope to prosper when energy is priced beyond their reach. Higher energy costs are the direct result of over-bearing regulation and taxation. We all want a clean environment. We must work to use the resources God has given us in a way that will protect the earth, but the prosperity of God’s children is also a high concern. We are smart enough to do both, and with His help we can. The state must work towards a win-win-win solution that takes all sides into account.\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nWe wonder who will be making the decisions about what is restricted. Adults can choose on their own. Children, by definition, are not able to make those choices without parents to help them weigh the costs. With carefully crafted legislation, we can protect our children while allowing for adults to make those choices for themselves.\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\nI worry that our freedoms, especially those named in the federal Bill of Rights, including the freedom to practice our religion as we choose, freedom of speech, and freedom to peaceably assemble, are being eroded, and that parents are losing their fundamental responsibility to raise their children as they see fit. We are facing a horrendous assault on the Family — we face equally horrid attacks on individual responsibility and the right to maintain our blood-bought heritage of religious and other defining liberties. I firmly believe in and will fight to protect the rights of the people to determine their own futures as long as those choices do not interfere with the rights of others. I spent 22 years in the US Army dedicated to protecting those rights from foreign foes. I will not stand by while domestic opponents weaken and takes them from us.\n\nKen DeGraaf\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nAbortion is a natural occurrence at the end of a non-viable pregnancy, while Feticide is the intentional ending of the life of a pre-born human. RHEA promotes and protects Feticide. The purpose of government is to secure our Creator endowed Rights, among which are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. The Right to Life is premised on being created, not on a heartbeat or some conception of personhood, and can only be conferred from a higher power. Thus to claim Rights for myself, I can only accept them as conferred from God and must extend that status to others. I can only deny those Rights to others by denying their status as Creator endowed, which precariously denies them to myself as well. The codification of RHEA effectively ends any Right to Life. Modern medicine was built on the Hippocratic oath, which has the first principle of “do no harm” directly links the dangers of both feticide and euthanasia–“Nor shall any man’s entreaty prevail upon me to administer poison to anyone; neither will I counsel any man to do so. Moreover, I will give no sort of medicine to any pregnant woman, with a view to destroy the child.” In conjunction with securing the Right to Life of the pre(& post)-born human, the government has an obligation to the mother in ensuring appropriate obligations are held against the father, and severe deterrent punishments against those committing rape or incest. No. Feticide is a violation of Human Rights, not something to pursue as a growth industry.\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\nNo, nor should they restrict the same for ill-founded, or lightly-founded beliefs to the extent they do not infringe on the Rights of others’ “Life, Liberty or Pursuit of Happiness” for which the government is purposed with making secure. Ultimately speech is the foundation of thought, and free speech is the basis for addressing and solving problems, which by their very nature involve an offense of some sort. Civil discourse should be encouraged so that differences can be resolved in the marketplace of ideas, not through the coercion of State.\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nNo. Unfortunately it has proven beyond the capacity for government to effectively and compassionately care for those needing a helping hand since Government programs are incentivized to create government dependence. Charity cannot be coerced, but that is the only means by which the government can obtain money to perpetuate a poor imitation of the Christian charity it intends to supplant. Per the Colorado Constitution Article V, section 34, “no appropriation shall be made for charitable, industrial, educational or benevolent purposes to any person, corporation or community not under the ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF THE STATE”. Thus, before asking the State for money, we should ask over what or whom we would like the State to have absolute control. This is a better role for charity, with taxes reduced accordingly, which will foster economic growth and create jobs.\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nYes. Forcing providers to act outside of their conscience will result in fewer medical providers, and those remaining providers being those willing to act without conscience. What is actually needed is to prevent legislation requiring the violation of conscience, instead of a specific governmental permission to adhere to it.\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nOur Declaration of Independence recognizes that all of humanity is endowed with the Rights of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness, but does not ensure anyone “has” or is provided anything, regardless of immigration status. Immigrants must be here legally, otherwise they are subject to trafficking and exploitation in the underground economies. Government can only ensure provision for “basic human needs” if those resources are first coerced from another, which is theft regardless of intentions. Medical care could be more effectively obtained if self-pay was allowed at Medicare rates which are typically 20-25% of billed amounts. Minimum wage laws serve to keep low-skilled workers out of the economy and drive up inflation.\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nYes. Educational expenses should also be counted as tax credits through 85% of the per-pupil State expenditure. This would encourage the formation of alternate educational enterprises which could encourage revitalization of housing areas currently avoided due to inadequate schools, and reduce commuting distances to work.\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nYes. The first way to reduce crime is to allow the growth of actual opportunities to succeed outside of criminal activity by reducing the government’s taxation chokehold on the economy to pay for frivolous and unconstitutional laws and spending. Opportunities for legal & productive work can only occur in areas where law is followed and crime is prevented. “Repaying a debt to society” cannot be just a matter of having been sequestered with other criminals if a functional return to society is expected. This is another area where minimum wage laws prevent those trying to return with the ability to access the first rung of the ladder to success.\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nno, government incentives are simply political favors paid by taxpayers. “Environmentally friendly” must be extracted from “ideologically constrained.” The best way to lower the cost of energy is to stop preventing the extraction of natural gas and declassify CO2 as a pollutant, since it is literally the building block of plant growth. CO2 produced by human activity is only about 1% of that produced naturally, and the US contribution merely about 15% of that 1%. While CO2 does respond to low-energy longwave infrared radiation, its effect on climate is minor to inconsequential compared to that of water (https://youtu.be/XIBsjBvRTew). The foundational models for CO2 require an adjustment exceeding 15%, rendering them useless for predicting the variations of less than 1% that will supposedly send the climate careening into catastrophe. There are numerous cycles that reinforce and cancel to create variations in climate, chief among them is the sun which has increased in output since pre-industrial revolution by what equates to over seven times the global energy output, or the equivalent of 21,000 barrels of oil per second. Minor variations in cloud cover dwarf any effect of CO2. “Green energy” is not “green,” except in funneling cash primarily to China which, in accordance to the Paris Accords, burns as much dirty coal as it wants to produce our solar panels and windmills, which will likely never offset the power used in their production. In the meantime, these costly programs increase joblessness and homelessness.\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nYes. pornography is exploitive, damaging and addictive (enslaving); it is also associated with abuse, extortion and human trafficking, undermining the Rights of all participants.\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\nI hold it to be self-evident that mankind is created in the image of God, and that my role in government will be to secure their Creator-endowed Rights with only those just powers derived from the consent of the governed who remain sovereign to the government itself. I recognize that history has shown that governments who exceed the role of securing our Rights in the pursuit of some humanist utopia have always descended into tyranny. I know that the best place for tax dollars is for them to remain in the hands of citizens, and that there is no problem the government cannot make worse with a solution. We’ve created an insatiable beast in government, and the sooner we address that reality the better.\n\nJeff Ravage\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nI believe it is the right of the pregnant person, in consultation with their health provider, to make any decisions about carrying to term or ending their pregnancy. You may be trivializing the agony of some of these decisions by pointing out only that this Act allows for elective abortion for every week of pregnancy. No one flippantly has an abortion late in their pregnancy unless there is some horrible circumstance: Life threatening to mother, child or both. Life is both joy and pain and you cannot relieve another of either of them by forcing your beliefs upon them.\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nI have no opinion one way or the other. I think that more providers may come to Colorado if only because of the new rules of some surrounding states.\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\nI have no opinion one way or the other. I think that more providers may come to Colorado if only because of the new rules of some surrounding states.\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nIt should be patient, and science centered. If a physician finds themselves in a practice where best treatments offends their “deeply held beliefs” perhaps they should find a new profession. I was raised Roman Catholic and believe that Jesus would agree “ Never let your perceived beliefs keep you from extending compassion on your charges” It is not ours to judge.\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nThe erosion of education by both government and private interest is showing itself to be the greatest danger that America, and democracy have yet faced. Enough of this shifting public education funds to private schools who may not have their charges best interests in mind. Or to religious schools that may teach actual fallacy (yes, evolution is real) placing their graduates at a disadvantage when released into a world of reality.\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nRight now, the environment is our greatest challenge. Our abuse of the world that gives us life has led to a situation where human life may become untenable in only a few decades if we don’t change our ways. If the above words are used honestly, with full intent to find environmentally friendly solutions, then that is the main issue of my candidacy. But if it is a veiled green-wash intended to allow subsides of fossil fuels in the: “Encouragement of private investment and competition within our energy sector” as has happened over and over again- then no I won’t let profit motive and business as usual to exterminate the human race. I will fight against that with my last breath.\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nSince the biggest porno free-for-all is the internet. I would go farther and suggest we ratchet down access to much internet content for children under 18. I believe studies will show that social media may be worse for a child’s wellbeing and self-esteem than graphic pornography. And that’s saying something. So perhaps there could be strict limits on internet use for those who brains should be developing with one to one personal contact, fresh air and playgrounds.\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\nI will fight for your rights equally with everyone else. I do believe in the first amendment and the freedom of religion. But that must include the freedom from religion. When I was raised Roman Catholic, I was taught that Catholics follow their tenets, but never force them on others. Jesus said this, and never mentioned abortions or homosexuality. We should strive to lead with compassion and help those who we find need it most. I believe in science and find no conflict between it and religion. Science is the best tool we have found to discover facts, and religion, at its best, is the tool that helps us use that knowledge with integrity and justice for all.\n\nDee Dee Vicino\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nI do not believe the government should be involved in marriage at all. Marriage should be determined by the church.\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nAs long as it is temporary. We should have strong incentives t believe charitable organizations are better suited to provide services than the government. encourage people to enter the workforce,\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nOnly if they enter the country legally.\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nAs long as those who engage in criminal activity receive appropriate consequences for their illegal actions. We cannot and should not put the safety of law-abiding citizens at risk. Criminals should be held accountable for their actions, and prevention and rehabilitation should be part of the equation.\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nThis is a first amendment issue. However, pornography sites are notorious for human trafficking, pedophilia, etc. A focused effort on cracking down on trafficking (locating and prosecuting traffickers) and anyone involved in child pornography should be a priority in Colorado. We need to fund these efforts.\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\nAs a lay pastor, a mother of a blended family, a female small business owner, an educator, and a policy analyst, I bring a unique, individual perspective to the table, one that represents average middle-class citizens of Colorado. I believe that representation has been missing for a long time, and I’d like to bring it back. We need measured legislators in office, people who will consider all sides of the issues and make policy decisions that take into account unintended consequences. That is lacking in Denver right now. Colorado has the highest inflation rate in the country, the 5th highest crime rate, and the second highest rate of drug-overdose deaths. These policy decisions are crushing our quality of life and literally killing our kids. I’ve written policy for the education industry and developing countries, and I understand the consequences of enacting BAD policy. We MUST do better.\n\nDamon Davis\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nWhile I personally disagree with the RHEA, the act is consistent with what the majority of Coloradans have voted for on citizen initiatives.\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nI support this in case Obergefell is overturned. Same-sex marriage has been embedded in society with divorces, inheritances, lawsuits, common law marriages all based on same-sex marriage, and it would be incredibly difficult to undo that, and incredibly unfair to say no same-sex marriage after this date.\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nOnly the federal government can create a path to citizenship or right to work, but Colorado can and should protect the rights of immigrants who do find work, regardless of they are documented or not.\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nI believe strongly in prison education to ensure prisoners have something to turn to when they get out, allowing them to become productive members of society while also saving money by keeping them out of prison in the future.\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nI believe this is a First Amendment issue.\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\nI am the candidate who is standing up for ordinary working people. I am fighting for affordable housing and more affordable higher education so that working families have a better chance to find prosperity. I want to protect the rights of all workers, including immigrants. I believe in alternate sentencing and prison education in order to give criminals a second chance at life, while also reducing crime. I want to take reasonable steps to protect the environment, which is important to our Colorado way of life, but also to our tourism and agriculture economy. But I also believe, the Earth is a gift to us from God and should be treated with respect. And I believe the words of Matthew 25:40 do not just apply to personal decision, but also to decision made in the capacity of a public official.\n\nCourtney Potter\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nThis law goes much farther than most Coloradoans believe it should. No, we should not incentivize any medical treatments.\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\nNo, all individuals should have their well-founded beliefs protected.\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nYes, the safety net should help people get back on their feet.\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nYes, legislation should be patient-centered and protect the rights of medical providers.\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nYes, legislation should be patient-centered and protect the rights of medical providers.\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nYes, this money belongs to the families and should be able to be spent by families to invest in the best education for their children.\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nYes, both preventing crime and rehabilitating offenders should be goals of the criminal justice system.\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nColorado energy policy should encourage private investment and competition but shouldn’t provide governemtn incentives.\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nAccess to pornography should be restricted for minors in Colorado.\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\nThose of us who lead our lives according to our faith, need to step into the realm of public policy to ensure our rights are protected. Some say faith should be kept out of the public square, but we know this Country was founded on principles for faithful people. When we aren’t engaged, we leave the law and policy making to others who don’t make the same faith-based decisions we would. In Colorado we have seen government try to criminalize businesses owners for their deeply held religious beliefs, and close churches to try to protect community health. We have also seen attempts to force medical procedures against people’s religious beliefs. In most cases our courts have overturned these attempts, but this battle must end. I will fight to protect our religious liberties and ensure we are able to live our faith.\n\nCory Parella\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nRepeal and revision for reconsideration. I plan to pitch an artificial uterus: https://youtu.be/3bP64x6ivkI\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nI was raised Catholic. I now claim born again Christianity. I believe civil union life insurance payouts should be enforced. This law could otherwise be edited many ways.\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\nEnforcing this would require regulating web-based social sharing publication sources like Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, etc. to observe truth-in-advertising and libel laws.\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nI use medicaid myself. Until the insurance industry is compelled into a free market, our stalemate remains. Obamacare wasn’t enough.\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nHumana once sold me a policy with no doctors in it.\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nI Do believe all immigrants should select at Border entry which US State they will pay taxes in to work here legally – not necessarily where they will be working.\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nSince a massive override of the public school system is emerging, I’ll say Yes, As-Is.\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nMy Plan involves such. Expand and strengthen the Mercy seat, enforce and increase sentencing. Add 2 strikes to the 3 strikes felony rule.\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nGas, electric, emerging energy sources side by side at a repower hub.\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nReligious evangelism would be limited by the same laws. Let people choose. If we restrict any content, we take steps into Nazism.\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\nMy dad went Home to Jesus Christ in 1991 – as a self-confessed Catholic. He knew Jesus as his lord and savior. years later, I switched to protestantism after abuses by my home-parish drove me to find another place to worship. Colorado Catholics can count on me to be their Voice in terms to fairness, accuracy and contextual awareness. I know my Bible and the Law and I know how to navigate one with the other. As much as I believe in the Separation of Church and State to prevent religious dictatorships, my fellow Believers in the Resurrection should know that with me in the Seat of HD42, I am a man of God prays before, during and after every Session. John 18:21 And if that ruffles non-Believers, I don’t give a sh*t. :)\n\nCarol Riggenbach\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\n“I believe in good ol’ fashioned values that honor God and our families. Families need legislatures to stand up and defend their rights as parents. I believe that most Coloradans and Americans want this country to honor God. We have not been represented at the capital when it comes to our Christian values. I stand for my Father in Heaven and the mercy He has bestowed on our State. I honor Him in all that I do. He asked “Whom should I send?” I answered, “Send me.” I will wholeheartedly represent the people of House District 62 and respect them. I go to make a difference, not just be a voice, but make a difference. We need God fearing legislatures creating and defending legislation that upholds our values. God Bless you all for what you do to help. We are all standing up and fighting together.”\n\nAlexander Mugatu\n\nLife – Should the Reproductive Health Equity Act (RHEA), which allows for elective abortion during all 40-weeks of pregnancy, be overturned? Should Colorado law provide incentives for abortion providers to move to Colorado to meet abortion demand from out-of-state pregnant women?\n\nThe Corado General Assembly significantly overreached with such a heinous and barbaric policy. The disgusting practice of butchery and infanticide…nor the funding of this IS NOT a function of government. I WILL ABSOLUTELY sponsor and vote to repeal this disgusting act. Again, this should not under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE be considered a function of government!\n\nFamily – Should the Colorado legislature codify same-sex marriage in law?\n\nThe Legislature: Absolutely Not — However, I believe that social issues need to be decided by the society or community(s) in which we live. A vote of the people should be required.\n\nReligious Liberty – Should the Colorado legislature restrict the freedom of individuals and institutions to think, speak, work, and act according to their well-founded beliefs?\n\nAbsolutely not and would be a severe violation of both the U.S. and State Constitutions.\n\nEconomic Justice – Should welfare policy provide a safety-net to improve the immediate well-being of the poor and encourage work?\n\nThis is a tough question: Welfare bu definition is a “safety-net” that is consistently abused by both recipient(s) and politicians who use the corrupted systems to garner votes. I FULLY AGREE that work should be encouraged and would draft legislation requiring the searching and attaining of a full-time job. I would cap welfRe benefits (to the able-bodied) to a five year maximum within a 15 year period. Meaning should an able-bodied recipient max out the full 5 years, they must work or wait an additional 10 years to be eligible to recieve again. The “hand up” has been allowed to become the hand-out. This is no longer Acceptable practice.\n\nHealth Care – Should health-care legislation be patient-centered and protect the conscience rights of medical providers?\n\nBut only when said legislation pertains to affordable and transparent care between provider and patient. I believe that insurance coverage should be regulated toward fulfilling the obligations of their policyholders. I believe that all the gimmicky policies insurers issue should be heavily scrutinized by the state insurance commissioner to either allow or deny the sale of a policy offering.\n\nImmigration – Should Colorado law ensure all immigrants have basic human needs, enable work, and encourage pathways to citizenship?\n\nAside from public health and safety, “basic human needs” are not a function of government. An efficient pathway to citizenship is paramount. As State Senator, I will work with our congressional delegation to do just that for those waiting in the queue. I will also work with the delegation, our chambers of commerce, and agricultural agencies to urge the state department to increase the number of temporary guest worker visas during the farm and agricultural seasons.\n\nEducation – Should Colorado law allow families to utilize their own 529 savings account funds for their children’s K-12 education (this has been permitted by the IRS since 2018 but states must opt-in)?\n\nI also believe that school choice is a fundamental parental right where education funding should follow the child regardless of system. Public, private, charter, parochial, etc. Funding is per pupil and should follow each pupil! Education reform and funding is on my target list to tackle in my first term when elected.\n\nRestorative Justice – Should Colorado’s criminal justice reform focus on both preventing crime and offering those who commit the crime an opportunity to rehabilitate and effectively return to society?\n\nAgree, but NOT in the manner in which this radical state legislature went about doing it. SB19-143 mandated the early release of prisoners through the parole process, SB 21-271 was the so-called misdemeanor reform act that essentially took the handcuffs off of the criminals and shackled law enforcement…this bill also placed the minimum bounty on colorado families by allowing for a victimization of $2000 before an arrest can be made. Garbage legislation like this MUST BE REPEALED! Prison reform is also required to effectively rehabilitate rathher than simply “warehouse” convicted inmates.\n\nEnergy & Environment – Should the Colorado’s energy policy encourage private investment and competition in our energy sector through incentives that are focused on environmentally friendly solutions to our energy crisis?\n\nAbsolutely! Free market enterprise is desperately needed to replace the “regulated monopoly” system Colorado currently uses to effectively pick “winners and losers.” The Public Utilities Commission must also heavily scrutinized by the legislative oversight committee’s of jurisdiction. The bureaucracy of the PUC is out of control. As Senator, I will ensure these unelected political bullies are held to account with the highest degree of transparency.\n\nTechnology – Should the Colorado legislature pass policy that restricts pornography access?\n\nAlthough I detest the ease of accessibility of such smut — I do not believe censorship of any kind of content despite appropriateness should be an actionable policy of any government. I believe an action such as this should be better-handled in the free market/private sector.\n\nWhy should Colorado Catholics vote for you to represent them in the state legislature?\n\nAs a born and raised Catholic myself, I believe that God will guide my every action and allow me the free will to efficiently serve the people of our great state, along with the strength to stand above the polarization of partisan politics. With the issues facing us today, the polarization of our politics — we have now gone far beyond the pettiness of partisanship. The 2 party system has given us the Colorado we have today; and families are scared! I believe our friends and neighbors are in a desparate search for guidance and leadership based in viable solution to legitimate problems and not the typical “political rhetoric” we’ve grown accustomed to. I too am now skeptical of both Democrats and Democrats pretending to be Republican/Conservative (as in our case here in Pueblo/SD3) WE ALL deserve to be represented, they can have their parties — our faith will guide me to be the voice for the rest of us! Many Blessings! In the end, my friends in faith are also blessed with the same free will that I have. Although I stand as a candidate, the aided Write-in vote for Alexander Mugatu will be a vote in aid of us all! This is why I ask for your faith and support as we endeavor in our pursuit of the greatest Colorado yet… Pray for Pueblo, Pray for Colorado — and may God continue his many blessings of our great nation! 🙏 🤲 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸\n\nMost Reverend Stephen Berg is a native of Miles City, Montana.
