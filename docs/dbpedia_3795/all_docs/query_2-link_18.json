        "text": "by Rev. Philip Slaughter, D.D.\n\nEdited\n\nWith Notes and Addenda\n\nby Rev. Edward L. Goodwin\n\nHistoriographer of the Diocese of Virginia\n\nPublished by George W. Jacobs & Company, Publishers, Philadelphia, 1907\n\nThis text is offered on Jeffrey’s Store on Lulu. Jeff’s Store has some of the texts offered on this website, and several other historic texts, not on the website. They are offered as reprints.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nWhen the English Colonists made their first permanent settlement on the shores of Virginia they came to establish themselves as an English people in America. They did not emigrate for purposes of robbery, nor yet to escape conditions which were not to their liking at home, but they brought with them all they could of the old England, including, as a matter of course, the English Church and English law, ecclesiastical and civil. They brought,, too, as the event was to prove, the English genius for adapting old forms of government to new conditions of life. Thus in process of time the Parish and the Vestry in Virginia became quite different from the same institutions in the old country, though still based upon the broad sanctions of the ecclesiastical law of England. The Parish was established and its bounds were fixed not by tradition, but by statute, and the Vestry, from an annual meeting of all the ratepayers to choose Church wardens and discuss parochial affairs, became practically a close corporation of twelve of “The most able and discreet persons” in the Parish. These divided with the County Court the responsibility of local government, having as their especial charge the maintenance of religion and the oversight of all things pertaining thereto in the domain of charity and morals. These Ves- trymen were described by Jefferson as being “Usually the most discreet farmers, so distributed through their Parish that every part of it may be under the eye of some one of them. They are well acquainted with the details and economy of private life, and they find sufficient inducements to execute their charge well in their philanthropy, in the approbation of their neighbors, and the distinction which that gives them.”\n\nNo Parish in the Colony had a Vestry more distinguished in its personnel, or more fully qualified for their positions, than the Parish of Truro. Of its earlier members indeed little has come down to us but their names inscribed on almost every page of the scant records remaining to tell of the settlement of these upper reaches of the “Northern Neck,” and the establishment of religion and civilization in what was then but a wilderness. But later her Vestrymen are found ranking among the first gentlemen of Virginia in position and influence. Eleven of them sat at various times in the House of Burgesses. Two of them, the Fairfaxes, were members of “His Majesty’s Council for Virginia.” Another of her Vestrymen was George Mason, one of the first among the founders of the State and the great political thinkers of his age; while still another was declared to be the “Greatest man of any age,” the imperial George Washington.\n\nThese men, however exalted their native genius, had and needed to have their period of training, that their characters might be matured on lines of piety and righteousness, their opinions formed in full view of the needs and capacities of their people, and their abilities ripened in the fields of practical experience. They received this training in part as Parish Vestrymen. It was no mean school in which to learn the rudiments of popular government, the foundations @of human rights, or the reconciliation of diverse policies.\n\nThe Vestry Records of Truro Parish have therefore a value quite unique as the sole and absolutely authentic record of the parochial administration and government of these great men. The affairs which occupied their attention seem small indeed as compared with those which afterward demanded the consecration of their powers, but they brought to them the same practical wisdom, scrupulous justice and exact attention to detail which characterized them later as master workmen in making the history and building the liberties of a nation.\n\nFor the recovery and preservation of these records we are indebted to the late Reverend Doctor Philip Slaughter, Clergyman, Genealogist, Antiquarian and Historian, whose name will long be held in affectionate remembrance in Virginia. .He was the author of no large work, but his histories of St. George’s, Bristol, and St. Mark’s Parishes, and very many pamphlets, articles and published addresses, combine to form a great contribution to the historical collections of his native State, and an enduring monument to his memory. A few years before his death lie was so fortunate as to discover the whereabouts of the old Vestry Book of Truro Parish which had been lost to sight for three- quarters of a century, and did not rest until it came into his possession. He afterwards committed it to the Vestry of Pohick Church, accepting only the small sum in return which it had cost him to acquire it, but not before he had compiled from its time-worn pages the History of Truro Parish which is here presented to the reader. It was almost his last literary labor, and indeed the infirmities of age forbade his giving the work of his amanuenses his final revision and corrections. The incomplete manuscript was entrusted to the Rev. Dr. Samuel A. Wallis, then Rector of Pohick, to be published when the means for doing so should be forthcoming.\n\nAt the request of Dr. Wallis I have prepared the history for publication. The manuscript has been wholly re-written; more copious extracts from the records of the Vestry have been incorporated, so that it now includes all that is of general value in the Vestry-Book, the language and spelling of which have been preserved; a few errors and oversights have been found and corrected; and in one place, for reasons noted in the text, a number of pages of my own have been inserted in lieu of the author’s. With these exceptions the continuous narrative is as nearly as possible as Dr. Slaughter wrote it. My own additions otherwise appear in the form of foot-notes and addenda.\n\nEDWARD L. GOODWIN.\n\nThe Rectory,\n\nFairfax, Virginia.\n\nTHE GENESIS OF TRURO PARISH\n\nAmong the prominent features in the physiognomy of Eastern Virginia are the great rivers which run from the blue mountains and pour their streams into the bosom of the “Mother of Waters,” as the Indians called the Chesapeake Bay. Along these rivers, which were then the only roads, the first settlers penetrated the wilderness. This explains the seeming anomaly, that the first Parishes and counties often included both sides of broad rivers, it being easier to go to Court and to Church by water, than through forests by what were called in those days “bridle paths.” Hence Parishes were often sixty or more miles long and of little breadth. The space between the rivers was called “Necks.” Among the most historic of these was the Northern Neck, which included all the land between the Potomac and the Rappahannock rivers from their head springs to the Chesapeake Bay. This was the princely plantation of Lord Fairfax. Within this territory were the seats of the Fairfaxcs, Washingtons, Masons, McCartys, Fitzhughs, Brents, Alexanders, Lewises, Mercers, Daniels, Carters, Dades, Stuarts, Corbins, Tayloes, Steptoes, Newtons, Browns, Lees, Thorntons, Balls, Smiths, and other leading families too many to mention, who dispensed an elegant hospitality at Northumberland House, Nomini, Stratford, Chantilly, Mount Airy, Sabine Hall, Bedford, Albion, Cedar Grove, Boscobel, Richland, Marleborough, Woodstock, Gunston, Belvoir, Woodlawn, Mount Vernon, etc. Beginning at Lancaster, county was taken from county, Parish from Parish, as the population of each passed the frontiers, until in 1730 Prince William was taken from Stafford and King George Counties, above Cbappawansick Creek and Deep Run, and along the Potomac, to the “Great Mountains.” This became also Hamilton Parish; which Parish, by an Act of the General Assembly passed at the Session of May, I 732, to take effect the first of the following November, was divided into two Parisbes “By the river Ockoquan, and the Bull Run, (a branch thereof,) and a course from thence to the Indian Thoroughfare of the Blue Ridge of Mountains,” (Ashby’s Gap.) All that part of Prince William lying below the said bounds was to retain the name of Hamilton, “And all that other part of the said countv, which lies above those bounds, shall hereafter be called and known by the name of Truro.” The Parish was named after the Parish in Cornwall, in England, which is now the Diocese of Truro.\n\nSuch is the genesis of the Parish of Truro, which extended along the Potomac from the mouth of the Occoquan tot he Blue Ridge, including what are now the parishes of Truro, Cameron, Fairfax and Shelburne [These are Colonial Parishes. Those of more recent foundation in the same territory are Johns, Upper Truro, McGill and a part of Meade.] Within this territory there were three churches, Occoquan, William Gunnells, and a chapel “above Goose Creek.”\n\nThe present writer has been so fortunate as to find the old Vestry Book of Truro Parish; so long lost to the public eye that even Bishop Meade said he could “hear no tidings” of it and was constrained to construct his sketch of the Parish from such facts and traditions as he could gather from other sources and from his own rich personal knowledge. It is now possible for the first time to authenticate its history by its records which are continuous from 1732 to 1785, when the civil functions of the Vestries were devolved by law on the Overseers of the Poor. This book also contained a record of the proceedings of the Overseers of the Poor from 1787 to 1802, thus handing down the names of persons, many of whom had been Vestrymen of the Church.\n\nThe Vestry Book opens with a recitation of the Act of the General Assembly instituting the Parish, the election of the Vestry and the proceedings of their first meeting. The Act of Assembly prescribed that the Sheriff of the County should summon the freeholders and housekeepers to meet and elect so many of the “most able and discreet persons in the said Parish as shall make up the number of Vestrymen in the said Parish twelve and no more.” Which order being complied with, “Five of the Vestrymen elected, to witt, Charles Broadwater, Richard Osborn, John Lewis, Gabriel Adanis, and Edward Emms, together with Denis Mc.Carty, John Heryford, and Edward Barry, having taken the oaths appointed by law, and Subscribed to be conformable to the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England, took their places in the Vestry accordingly.” The first Vestry met on November 7th, I732, with the above gentlemen present. Edward Barry was nominated for Clerk, and “the question was put whether the said Barry should enjoy the place or not, which was carried in the said Barry’s favour. And he was thereupon sworn, and took his place accordingly.” I-Te was ordered to “provide paper & books for the minutes and orders of this Vestry, and that he be paid for the same at the laying of the next parish levy.” John Heryford and Edward Emms were chosen Churchwardens for that year, and “were sworn accordingly.” At the next meeting- of the Vestry, held March 26, 1733, John Sturman and Giles Tillett were added to the Vestry, and there were present also Francis Aubrey and William Godfrey, not previously mentioned. It was “Ordered, that the Churchwardens give publick notice to workmen to appear at the next Vestry to be held for this parish to agree for the building of a Church at the cross roads near Michael Reagans in this parish.” At the meeting on April 16, I733, Michael Ashford took the oaths and subscribed the test as a Vestryman. An agreement was made with the Rev. Lawrence De Butts to preach three times a month for one year, “at Occoquan Church, the new Church, or William Gunnell’s, and at the Chappell above Goose Creek,[1] for the sum of eight thousand pounds of tobacco clear of the Warehouse charges and abatements,—And the said De Butts doth further agree to and with the Vestry aforesaid, that in case he fails, or is by the weather prevented to preach at any of the places aforesaid, any of the times aforesaid, tobacco shall only be levied for him in proportion to his service.” Mr. De Butts seems to have been a bird of passage. From 1721 to about 1728 he was Minister of Washington Parish in Westmoreland County, where he had two churches, and also officiated during the week in the neighboring Parishes of St. Stephen’s, Northumberland; Farnham, Richmond County; and Cople, Westmoreland, when they were vacant. In 173i he was employed in St. Mark’s Parish, Culpepper County, at 500 pounds of tobacco a sermon, and now is in Truro for one year.[2] At the expiration of this engagement he seems to have preached eight sermons in the Parish, for which he received 245 pounds of tobacco per sermon, and then he disappears from the record, having, we believe, gone to Maryland.\n\n1733, June 9th, Mr. Richard Blackburn agreed with the Vestry to build a Church at the Cross Roads near Michael Reagan’s, “Forty feet in length, two and twenty feet wide, and thirteen feet pitch, to be weather boarded, covered, and all the inside work perform’d and done after the same manner the work upon Pohick Church is done, for the sum of thirty-three thousand five hundred pounds of tobacco.” William Godfrey and Michael Ashford were “to take care that the work upon the Church be well and sufficiently done and performed.”[3] 12th. October: Jeremiah Bronaugh, William Peake, John Farguson and Thomas Lewis were chosen Vestrymen in the room of several deceased members, and qualified and took their places accordiliglv. Joseph Johnson was chosen “Reader at the new Church and the Chapell above Goose Creek,” to receive 1300 pounds of tobacco provided he does his duty in his office.” In the Parish Levy for this year provision is made for 2500 pounds of tobacco to Capt. Francis Aubrey towards building the chapel above Goose Creek, and the next year the same amount, and in 1735, 4000 Pounds for finishing said chapel.\n\n1734 11th. May; James Baxter was chosen a Vestryman and qualified. Ordered that Edward Emms, the tipper Churchwarden, give notice to Capt. John Colvill to appear at a Vestry to be held it Poliick Church on the 4th. of June next, to take the oath of a Vestryman, if he shall think fit to accept of the office.” Jeremiah Bronaugh, John Fargusoni and James Baxter were appointed to view the land offered for a Glebe by William Godfrey, French Mason, William Hall, George Harrison, and Burr Harrison, and any other land that shall be offered by any other person, and to report to the Vestry. On the 4th. of June John Colvill Gent. was sworn and took his seat as a Vestryman. There is a note on the margin here signed “C. G.” (Rev. Charles Green,) in these words: “Capt. Colvill appears to have been a i3th Vestryman. This is noted because when a Burgess for this County he promoted ye dissolution of the Vestry as illegal,- himself the only illegal Vestryman.” John Heryford offered to sell 300 acres of land, “Scituate, Lying and being upon Accotink, and near the plantation of David Jones,” for a Glebe, for 12000 pounds of tobacco. It was ordered that the land be laid off at the cost of said Heryford, and that John Sturman provide Deeds of Lease al-id Release for conveying the land sold to this parish for a Glebe. The Churchwardens were ordered to receive of Wm. Godfrey 5000 pounds of tobacco he had assumed to pay to this parish for the parish of Hamilton. “At a Vestry held for Truro Parish on the 23d. day of 7ber, 1734,-Whereas John Colvill Gent. one of the members of this Vestry, is in a short time bound for Great Brittain, and hath promised us that he will use his interest to procure a discreet and Godly Minister of the Church of England, to come over and settle in our said parish. And further that he will accommodate any such person with a free passage hither, on board any of his ships, if he is ready to come in any of them ‘, and will accept of the same. We do therefore hereby impower and desire the said John Colvill to negotiate the said affair in our behalf, either by making application to his Grace the Lord Bishop of London, or by treating with any gentleman qualified as aforesaid in his private capacity, who shall be willing to come over and settle here. And we do agree to accept of, and provide for him, in as full and ample manner as the law of this Colony directs.” Signed by the Churchwardens and the five additional Vestrymen present.[4]\n\n1734. Oct. 11th. After the expiration of the year for which the Rev. Mr. De Butts had been employed he seems to have preached occasionally in the Parish, for at a Vestry of this date provision was made for paying him 1970 pounds of tobacco “for preaching eight sermons.” Payment was also ordered for Mr. Catesby Cocke for “Clerks Fees,” to John Trammell for “grubing a place for the Church,” to John Massey for “keeping a house for the minister to preach in,” and to the Churchwardens “to buy tarr for the Churches.” The salary of “each Reader in this parish” was fixed for the next year at 1000 pounds of tobacco.\n\n1735. Nov. 18th. “Augustine Washington gent. being this day sworn one of the members of this Vestry, took his place therein accordingly.” “C. G.” interlines this note: “A. W. a fourteenth Vestryman, father to L. W. the other Burgess when Truro Vestry was dissolved.”[5]\n\nPayment was ordered to Catesby Cocke, for recording deeds and copies of the lists of tithables in the Parish,[6] 168 pounds of tobacco; to Edward Barry, Clerk of the Church, (Pohick,) and Vestry, 1,500 pounds; to Samuel Hull, Clerk of the Chapel above Goose Creek, and Joseph Johnson, Clerk of the new Church, 1000 pounds each, and to Oliver Roe, Sexton at Pohick, 300 pounds.\n\n“At a Vestry held for Truro Parish the 19th day of August, 1736. Mr. Charles Green, being recommended to this Vestry by Capt. Augustine Washington as a person qualified to officiate as a Minister of this Parish, as soon as he shall receive orders from his Grace the Bishop of London to qualify himself for the same. It is therefore ordered by this Vestry, that as soon as the said Green has qualified himself as aforesaid, he be received and entertained as Minister of the said Parish. And the said Vestry do humbly recommend the said Charles Green to the Right Honorable Thomas Lord Fairfax for his Letters of recommendation and Presentation to his Grace the said Lord Bishop of London to qualify him as aforesaid.\n\nJeremiah Bronaugh, Church Warden. Denis McCarty Willm. Godfrey August. Washington James Baxter Richd. Osborn Edward Barry John Sturman Thos. Lewis”\n\nOctober 11th. The Vestry met and made the usual appropriations for the officers of the Church and for the support of the poor. They also made a bargain with the Rev. John Holmes to officiate in the Parish, in these words: “Ordered that the Revd. -Mr. John Holmes be received and entertained in this Parish, as Minister thereof; and that he be provided for as the Law directs.” Further, it was “Ordered that the Reverend Mr. John Holmes minister of this Parish preach six times in each year- at the Chappell above Goose Creek-, and it is also ordered, that the Sundays he preaches at the said Chappell the sermon shall be taken from the new Church.” At the bottom of the page is the following note, signed Cha. Green;-“The Levity of the Members of the Vestry is worth notice, They applyed to Collo. Colvill & entered an order 23d. Sept. 1734 for him to procure them a Clergyman from England. By the order on the other page they gave Cha. Green a title to the Parish when ordained and he had scarcely left the country when they received Mr. John Holmes into the parish as appears by the above order. N. B. Mr. Holmes was an Itinerant Preacher without any orders, & reed. contrary to Law.”\n\nThis note was made after Mr. Green became Rector of the Parish. The foregoing entries are the only evidence of the connection of Messrs. De Butts and Holmes with the Parish. These facts were unknown to Bishop Meade, who never saw this record. This book also reveals the fact that the Rev. James Keith, of Hamilton Parish, the Grandfather of Chief justice Marshall, also officiated in this Parish, when it was without a minister. At this very Vestry an order was entered to pay the Rev. Mr. James Keith 10,544 pounds of tobacco for services rendered.\n\nOn the 12th of April, 1737, a long contract with minute specifications is recorded with William Berkeley for building a “Mansion house” on the Glebe, with kitchen, barn, dairy, meat house, and all other appurtenances to a well furnished country residence. The specifications as to the quality of the timber, the style of the work, etc., would be a suggestive and profitable study for modern Vestrymen. The cost of the buildings was to be 36,500 pounds of tobacco. Berkeley’s bond, to Jeremiah Bronaugh and Thomas Lewis, Church Wardens, with Lewis Ellzey, Hugh West, George Harrison, and John Minor as bondsmen, and Val. Peyton, Abraham Saintclare and Joseph Cash as witnesses, is also recorded in the Vestry Book. At the same time an agreement was made with John Summers to “pale in the yard about the new Church after the same manner the yard about the Church at Pohick is paled in, (only the pails to be sawed,) to make good and sufficient shutters for the windows of the said Church, and to make and erect two good and substantial horse blocks,” for 3000 pounds of tobacco.\n\nTHE REV. CHARLES GREEN, M. D.,\n\nTHE FIRST REGULAR RECTOR OF TRURO PARISH.\n\nThe Vestry which met on the 13th of August, I737, was the first, which was held under the auspices of a regular Rector, and the following proceedings were entered on the minutes: “Whereas at a Vestry held for this Parish on the nineteenth day of August one thousand seven hundred and thirty six, the now Reverend Mr. Charles Green was recommended to the Right Honorable Thomas Lord Fairfax, for his presentation of the said Green to the Lord Bishop of London for his ordination. And it now appearing to this Vestry, as well by the letter of the Honorable William Gooch Esqr. Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, as the letter of the Reverend Mr. James Blair Commissary, that the said Green is regularly and legally ordained. It is therefore ordered by this Vestry, that the said Green be received into, and entertained as Minister of, this parish; and that lie be provided for, as the laws of this Colony direct.”[7]\n\nThis being passed there is noted as “Present, the reverend Mr. Charles Green Minister.” “Ordered, that the Church Wardens place the people that are not already placed, in Pohick and the new Churches, in pews, according to their several ranks and degrees.” “Ordered, that the sum of two thousand five hundred pounds of tobacco be yearly levied for the Reverend Mr. Charles Green, until the buildings that are to be erected upon the Glebe be cornpleated according to agreement made with the undertaker.”\n\n“Ordered, that the Reverend Mr. Charles Green preach four times in a year only, at the Chappell above Goose Crek. And that the Sunday he preaches at the said Chappell, the sermon shall be taken from the new Church.”\n\nAt a Vestry on the third day of October, 1737, the usual appropriations for the salaries of the minister and other officers of the Church, and for the poor and other current expenses of the Parish, were made, amounting to 38,383 pounds of tobacco. The Parish Levy was at the rate Of 42,1/2 pounds per Poll. The next Year it was 45 pounds. Among the appropriations made were;\n\nTo the Rev. Charles Green, Minister, salary,[8] 16729 lbs. tobacco To Mr. Joseph Blumfield,[9] to be paid Rev. Chas. Green. 1597 To Edward Washington, Sub Sheriff, per account. – 300 To Francis Aubrey gent. for finding books for the Chappell 200 To buy ornaments for the Churches and books for the Chappell, and Plate for Communion 8000 To Mr. Richard Osborn for taring the Churches, &c 1100 To Edward Emms for salivating- James Boilstone 1000\n\nThe Readers at the churches received their usual 1ooo pounds, and the Sexton’s 500. A commission of 6 per cent. was paid for collecting the levy.\n\n“Whereas the Rev. Charles Green hath this day agreed with the Vestry to take the tobacco levied to purchase books for the Chappell above Goose Creek and ornaments for the Churches, at the rate of eleven shillings current money per hundred. He by the said agreement obliging himself to find and provide the said books and ornaments, being allowed fifty per cent. upon the first cost in accounting with the Church Wardens. It is ordered that the collector pay to the said Green the sum of 8ooo pounds of tobacco, it being the quantity this day levied for the purpose aforesaid.” Mr. Green also contracted to build the addition to the Glebe house for the sum appropriated.\n\nAmong the offices of the Church Wardens was the duty of binding orphan and other indigent children as Apprentices; and ten pages of the Vestry Book at this period are filled with Indentures. Their specifications in regard to the duties and morals of those apprenticed, their being taught to read English and the “Art and mystery” of shoemaking, or of a Carpenter, or Cooper, etc., are curious illustrations of the times.\n\nAt a Vestry held 6th. of October, 1740, a petition was presented from William Fairfax Esqr. Catesby Cocke, Gent. and Charles Green, Doctor of Physick, “setting forth that the Church at Pohick is too small to admit of a commodious reception for the parishioners who resort to divine services at the said Church, and praying that they may be admitted to build a Gallery at the West end of the said Church for the reception and more easie accommodation of themselves and their families, and that the same may be erected at their own proper cost. It is ordered that they may, have liberty to erect the same, so that it does discommode the lights of the Church, or interfere with any other conveniency thereto belonging.” “Col. John Colvill is appointed and chosen Church Warden in the room of Thomas Lewis.”\n\nIn 1741 nothing appears on the record but the ordinary routine of laying levies, and making- annual appropriations for the poor, and the other current expenses of the Parish.\n\nINSTITUTION OF FAIRFAX COUNTY\n\nIn 1742 Fairfax County was taken from Prince William, and the boundary lines of Truro Parish and of the new county coincided.*[10] Among the duties of the Vestries was the appointment every four years of reputable Free- holders to “perambulate” the Parish, going around the plantations and renewing the land- marks. This was called “Processioning.”[11] To this end the Parish was divided into precincts, like our modern Townships. These are reproduced because they throw light upon the geography and population of the precincts at the time of the several processionings, and also because the Processioners named owned land within their several precincts at that date, and their names and localities ire thus prescribed. At a Vestry held the 8th of August, 1743, for appointing Processioners, etc. “Pursuant to an order of Fairfax County Court the Vestry proceeded and laid off the said Parish into precincts and appointed Processioners in manner following,” Ordered, that Richard Simpson and Thos. Ford procession all the pattented lands that lye THE HISTORY OF TRURO PARISH between Occoquan and Pohick oil the upper side of the Ox road, and between that and Occoquan is far up as Popes head. and that they perform the same sometime in the month of October or November next, and report their proceedings according to Law.” In like manner it was ordered, that William Champlieys and Francis Cofer procession between Occoquan and Pohick, and on the lower side of the Ox road, as far up as the head branches of Popes head; that John Manlev and John Brown procession between Pohick and Doegs Creek, from the head brandies of Pohick by Col. Fitzhugh’s Rolling road, to the head of Does Run; that Zephaniah Wade and Sampson Darrell procession between Doegs Run ind Great Hunting Creek; that Daniel French Senior and John Gladdin procession between Great Hunting Creek and Pimmetts Run; that James Robertson and Guy Broadwater procession between Pimmetts Run and Difficult Run; that John Trammell and John Harle procession between Difficult Run and Broad Run; that Anthony Hampton and William Moore procession between Broad Run and the south side of Goose Creek as far as the fork of Little River; that Philip Noland and John Lasswell procession between Goose Creek and Limestone Run as far as the fork of Little River; that Amos Janney and William Halling procession between Limestone Run and the south branch of Kitoctan; “Between the south fork of Kitoctan and Williams Gap, no freeholder in this precinct.

The Vestry was dissolved by all Act of Assembly, and the Sheriff of the County was ordered to call a meeting of the freeholders and housekeepers to choose a new Vestry of the “most able and discreet persons in the Parish.” In obedience to this order the following persons were chosen to compose the new Vestry, viz:\n\nCapt. John West Capt. Richard Osborn Capt. Lewis Ellzey Mr. Daniel French Mr. John Sturman Mr. Edward Emms Capt. John Minor Mr. Robert Boggess Mr. Hugh West Colo. John Colvill Mr. Andrew Hutchinson Mr. Charles Broadwater\n\nThese persons, having taken the oaths required by law to be taken, subscribed the test, and to be conformable to Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of En-land were sworn Vestrymen of the Parish of Truro.[12]\n\nBishop Meade expresses surprise at this dissolution in view of the number of intelligent men in the Parish, and supposes that it must have taken place elsewhere. But the Rev. Charles Green made a note in the Vestry Book which explains the proceeding. He says that “One of the causes assigned for the dissolution of the Vestry was that several of them were illiterate. There was but one of them illiterate, namely Edward Emms, who was reelected.” The truth seems to be that the Delegates to the Assembly and other leading men often had Vestries dissolved when they displeased them.[13]\n\nJohn West and Lewis Ellzey were sworn as Church Wardens, and William Henry Terrett was elected Clerk of the Vestry.\n\n1745, April 15th. Messrs. John West, Hugh West, Hutchinson, French, Boggess and Broadwater were appointed to “view the most convenient place between Sailsbury plain, Little river and Potomac river for a Chappel of Ease to be built, and to treat with the’workmen about the building thereof,” and report to the Vestry.[14] Also ordered that Messrs. John West, Ellzey and French view what necessary repairs are wanting at Goose Creek Chapel and agree with workmen therefor; that a gallery be built in the west end of the upper Church and the Church Wardens agree with workmen for the same; and that the Minister niake choice of proper persons to officiate as Readers at each Church. May 2Ist it was ordered that a Church be built at or near the spring nigh Mr. Hutchinsons and the Mountain road,” 40 feet long, 22 feet wide and 13 feet pitch, weatherboarded, shingled, and “ceiled with quartered plank beaded and plained,-with pulpit, desk, Communion Table, pews, doors, windows and seats after the manner of the upper Church.” The Clerk was instructed to prepare deeds for Mr. Hutchinson’s conveyance of two acres of land for the Church and churchyard, -and articles of agreement and bond for Hugh Thomas, who undertakes to build the Church for 24,500 pounds of tobacco, to be finished by the end of October 1746. On October I4th, I746, John Summers, William Harle and Thomas Darns were appointed “to view the new Church, and to report on oath the state and condition of the work, whether there is an deficiency or not.” Also it was “Ordered, that the Minister preach eight times in the year at the New Church, and that he do proportion the times equally from each Church.”[15]\n\nThe following items from the accounts current show the payments to the officers of the Churches, etc. :\n\nRev. Charles Green, Salary and cask 16,640 lbs. of tobacco Clerks at Pohick, Upper Church, New Church, and Goose Creek, each. 1200 Clerk of the Vestry 500 Mary Bennit, Sexton at the Upper Church. 400 Do for washing the surplice 125 Philip Howel, Sexton at Pohick and washing surplice twice 550 Hugh West, for account book 110 Do for bringing said book from Williamsburg 50 Dr. Robinson, physick and attendance on poor 1200 Dr. Daniel Hart, per account, for poor 3880 Various items, relief of the poor, one year 4630\n\nA MANDAMUS\n\nIn the proceedings of the Vestry for June, 1747, it is said that a Mandamus was presented to the Vestry in behalf of William Grove; who being examined denied that he knew anything of its being prosecuted, and also quit all claim to the Clerk’s place. This is the first instance of a Mandamus being served on a Vestry that I have met with. It is explained by a note on the margin by the Minister, thus: “William Grove was recommended to me by Capt. Newton as a person capable to be Clerk Etc. but on trial was found not capable. Also he came into the County convicted, though probably he might have behaved well afterward. For these reasons I appointed Wm. Champneys Clerk, which occasioned the Mandamus.”\n\nWilliam Grove was made Sexton at the new Church.\n\nIn 1748, in addition to the usual items, payments were made to John Graham, Valentine Wade, Mary Willis, Baldwin Dade, John Carlyle, and William Moore for levies overcharged, and to Dr. John Hunter for services to the poor.\n\nFIRST DIVISION OF TRURO PARISH\n\nBy an act of the Assembly of October, I748, it was enacted that from and after the eleventh day of June then next Truro Parish should be divided, “by Difficult Run and its meanders from the mouth to the head thereof, thence by a line to the head of Popes head run, and down the said run to the month thereof.” All on the lower side of said runs and line to retain the name of Truro, and all on the tipper side to be “one other distinct Parish and called by the name of Cameron.”[16]\n\nTruro was now limited to the foregoing metes and bounds; and Cameron Parish had jurisdiction above the said line, with its own Minister and Vestry. The division transferred 707 tithables to Cameron, leaving 1240 in Truro. Several of the old Vestrymen also lived in Cameron. The new Vestry of Truro consisted of,-\n\nHugh West, Abraham Barnes George Mason, Thomas Wren James Hamilton, Robert Boggess Charles Broadwater, John Turley Daniel McCarty, William Peake William Payne, Jeremiah Bronaugh\n\nThis is the first appearance of the great Author of the Bill of Rights in the Vestry Book. Mr. Bronaugh died within a few months, and was succeeded as Church Warden by Mr. Mason and as Vestryman by John West.[17]\n\nFebruary 19, 1749-50, the Vestry agree with Charles Broadwater Gent. to make an addition to the Upper Church, according to plans produced, for 12,000 pounds of tobacco. It was also ordered that the sills and sleepers of Pohick Church be repaired, the north side of the Church newly shingled with poplar or chestnut shingles, that windows be made in the “Justices Pew” and in the “Womens Pew,” that the Church be raised and new blocked, and that a Vestry House be built, sixteen feet square, framed and clapboarded, to have “an inside wooden chimney and to be lofted with clapboards.” Capt. Daniel McCarty undertakes this work for 5,500 pounds of tobacco, he having also the material in the old Vestry House to make what use of he can in building the new. Afterward this work was ordered to be deferred, and two years later the contract, with the addition of a window by the pulpit and making good the pews and floor,, was given to Mr. Daniel French for sixty-three pounds current money.\n\nOn the 20th of May, 1751, it was ordered, “That the Clerk of the Vestry present unto the next Court of Claims and Propositions a petition in the name of the Minister, Churchwardens and Vestrv of this Parish to Honour’l. House of Burgesses setting forth the insufficiency and inconveniency of the Glebe land of said Parish in order that an Act of Assembly be obtained for the Vestry to sell the same and buy land more convenient for the same uses, and also to pay the upper Parish of this County their proportion of what the said land may sell for.”[18] In 1752 an Act of Assembly granted the petition.\n\nThe time for processioning the lands having come a-ain, and the division of the Parish having changed its geography, etc. It was ordered that James Donaldson and John Jenkins procession between Difficult and Pimmetts run, Guy Broadwater and James Robertson between Pimmetts run and Four Mile run, Edward Masterson and William Gleading between Four Mile run and Hunting Creek, Sampson Darrell and John Posey between Hunting Creek and Dogue run, Edward Violet and William Ashford between Dogue run and Accotink, Abraham Barnes and Robert Boggess between Accotink and Pohick, William Reardon and John Hereford between Poliick and Occoqtian to Sandy run, Thomas Ford and Richard Simpson from Sandy run. to Popes Head and the branches of Difficult.\n\n1752. The Glebe’ was sold at auction and bought by Mr. William Ramsay for fifty pounds current money; and 176 acres of land adjoining the old Glebe was bought of Rev. Charles Green for 13,500 pounds of tobacco. Proposals were invited for buildings on the Glebe according to law, the dwelling house to be of brick, to contain in the clear about 1200 feet, of one story and a cellar and convenient rooms and closets; to be advertised in the Gazette and at the several Churches and the Courthouse. In October Mr. Thomas Waite contracted for the dwelling house and other houses on the Glebe for 425 pounds current money, and Rev. Charles Green undertook to do the rest of the building necessary, apparently without compensation.\n\nThe Clerk of the Upper Church was directed to read prayers every intervening Sunday,” and was allowed 1200 pounds of tobacco for his salary.\n\nALEXANDRIA\n\n1753, June 4th. “On the petition of Capt. John West ordered that the Rev. Mr. Charles Green do preach every third Sunday at the Town of Alexandria.” This is the first time Alexandria is men- tioned in this record, and this is probably the date of the first Church services there. Hitherto it has not been supposed that there had been Church service at Alexandria before 1762. It is not generally known that the site of Alexandria was included in a grant of land, (6,000 acres,) extending from Hunting Creek to the Little Falls, from Sir William Berkeley to Robert Howson. In October, 1669, Howson, for six hogsheads of tobacco, conveyed these lands to John Alexander, who, with his brothers Robert and Gerard, had emigrated from Scotland. (See Dinwiddie Papers, Vol. 1, p. 89.) There had been for some years warehouses at Pohick, Hunting Creek, and at Thomas Lee’s land at the Falls, when, in 1748, a town named Alexandria was established by Act of Assembly at Hunting Creek Warehouse, sometimes called Belle-Haven.\n\nIn 1754 there is mention of the payment of 100 pounds of tobacco to Capt. John West for “part of building the desk at Alexandria.” And in 1756 the Churchwardens are ordered “to have seats made for the Church at Alexandria.”*[19]\n\nCOLCHESTER\n\nAs Colchester was a conspicuous feature of Truro Parish it may be well to record here that it was established as a Town by Act of Assembly in 1753-4 on 25 acres of land belonging to Peter Wagener as being “very convenient for trade, and ,greatly to the ease of frontier inhabitants.” The Trustees and Directors were Peter Wagener, Daniel McCarty, John Barry, William Ellzey, and Edward Washington, all Vestrymen of Truro Parish.\n\n1754. Messrs. George Mason, Daniel McCarty, and Hugh West, who had been appointed to view the buildings on the Glebe as they progressed, made a report, showing the manliness of the times, which some modern Vestries would do well to imitate. They say the bricks are not fit to be used, and that the following notice should be given to Mr. Waite, the undertaker, and his securities:”Mr. Waite: The Vestry are of opinion that none of the bricks of the two first kilns are fit to be put into the walls of the Glebe House, but that what is done be pulled down and done with good bricks and that the cellar windows be done with good ring oak or locust; and that in case you begin anew that they will allow you six months further than the time mentioned in voter bond to compleat it.”\n\n“Ordered, that the King’s Attorney do prosecute for this Parish.”\n\nThe Hon. William Fairfax was appointed Vestryman in the room of Hugh West, deceased. The Church wardens were directed to give notice for the impotent people of the Parish to appear before the Vestry the following May, and also any person who will undertake to board them.\n\nSeptember, 1755. The time for processioning land recurs, and some of the details are given because they throw light on the history of the Parish. David Piper, John Hereford, and Marielles Littlejohn are to procession the several tracts of land that have their beginning, between Occoquan, Potomac river, Accotink run and the road that leads from Hunting Creek through the Glebe land to Occoquan. John Peak, Daniel French, John Posey, and Abednego Adams, between Accotink, Potomac river. Hunting Creek and the road that leads from Hunting Creek through the Glebe land. John Dalton, Thomas Harrison, John Hunter, and Nathaniel Smith, between Hunting Creek, Potomac river, and the road that leads from Awbreys ferrv to the upper Church and the road that leads from Cameron to the said Church. Guy Broadwater, James Robertson and James Donaldson, between the road that leads from Awbreys ferry to the upper Church and the road from upper Church to Difficult run, and then down the run to Potomac river, and then down the river to Awbreys ferry. Lewis Ellzey, James Hawley, William Adams, and John Ratcliff, between the road that leads from Cameron to Difficult run, and up the run and Parish line till the line comes to the road that leads from Cameron by Capt. Lewis Ellzeys, and so down the said road to Cameron. Thomas Shaw, Presley Cox, James Jugo Dozier, Joseph Stephens, Sampson Demevill, and John Hampton between the road that leads from Cameron by Capt. Lewis Ellzeys to the Parish line, and so down the Parish line to Occoquan ferry, and then up the road by the Glebe to Hunting Creek.\n\nMrs. Sybil West is paid 1800 pounds of tobacco for elements for the Churches. Wm. Payne and Henry Gunnell chosen Vestrymen in 1756.\n\n1757. Geo. Wm. Fairfax chosen Vestryman ill the room of his father, Hoii. William Fairfax, deceased.[20] Several parties were paid for attendance its witnesses in Churchwardens suit against Cole.\n\n1758. John West jun. becomes Clerk of the Vestry. George Mason, John West and Daniel McCarty to examine the Parish papers and report to the next Vestry.\n\n1759. Mr. Waite, “tho’ often admonished,” having failed in doing his work at the Glebe buildings according to agreement, the Vestry take steps to annul his contract. William Bucklands finally completes the work and is paid the balance due Waite. Processioners were again appointed, being generally those who had served before.\n\n1760 and 1761. We have only the usual routine Parish items and appropriations for salaries, maintenance of the poor, Physicians and Lawyers fees, etc. Mrs. Sybil West’s account for elements for the Holy Communion is about 1100 pounds of tobacco annually.\n\nGEORGE WASHINGTON, VESTRYMAN\n\n1762. October 25th “Ordered, that George Washington Esqr. be chosen and appointed one of the Vestrymen of this Parish in the room of William Peake Gent. deceased.”[21]\n\nTHE FALLS CHURCH\n\n“At a Vestry held at the Falls Church March 28th, 1763- Present, Henry Gunnell, William Payne jun. Church Wardens, John West, William Payne (sen.) Chas. Broadwater, Thos. Wren, Abra. Barnes, Danl. McCarty, Robt. Boggess, and Geo. Washington, Vestrymen, Who being there met to examine into the state of the said Church, greatly in decay and want of repairs, and likewise whether the same should be repaired or a new one built, and whether at the same place or removed to a more convenient one; Resolved it is the opinion of this Vestry that the old Church is rotten and unfit for repair, but that a new Church be built at the same place. Ordered that the Clerk of the Vestry advertise in the Virginia and Maryland Gazettes for workmen to meet at the said Church on the 29th day of August next, if fair, if not the first fair day, to undertake the build- ing a Brick, Church to contain 1600 feet on the floor, with a suitable gallery, and bring a plan for the Church and price according to the same.”\n\nThere is no record of a meeting in August. Probably no contractors appeared.\n\nOctober 3rd. 1763. “Ordered, that George William Fairfax and George Washington Esq’s. be appointed Church Wardens for the ensuing year.\n\n“Ordered, that the Vestry meet at Alexandria on the third Tuesday in March next in order to agree with workmen to undertake the building of a Church at or near the old Falls Church, and that the Church Wardens advertise the same in the Virginia and Maryland Gazettes to be continued six weeks; and that it will be then expected of each workmen to produce a plan and estimate of the expense.” The .Parish Levy called for 30,000 pounds of tobacco” towards building the Falls Church to be sold for call by the Church Wardens for the highest price they ran get.” Again there is no record of the meeting appointed for March (1764) being held[22] But in the annual Levy in October of that year an additional 20,000 pounds of tobacco is levied “for building Churches the Parish,” and ordered to he solo as before. John Larry become; Clerk of the Vestry.\n\nSecond Division of Truro and Formation of Fairfax Parish\n\n[Note by the Editor. — The facts in regard to the division of Truro, and the formation of Fairfax Parish. are not recorded in the Vestry The HISTORY Oh TRURO PARISH Book, and were but imperfectly known to Dr. Slaughter. He was not acquainted with the final Act of Assembly dividing the Parishes, nor had he ever seen the original and complete paper by Gen. Washington giving the result of the various elections of Vestrymen held at this time, which explains, and explains away, the seeming fact that Washington was chosen, contrary to all precedent, if not law, to serve simultaneously on the Vestries of two distinct Parishes. For these reasons Dr. Slaughter’s History is, of necessity, at this point, radically imperfect; and the Editor feels that he will but carry out what would be the Author’s wish, if it could be expressed, in departing from the manuscript for a few pages, and rewriting this portion of the Parish annals.]\n\nAs early as 1761 a petition was presented to the County Court, and ordered certified to the General Assembly, praying’ for a division of Truro Parish. The population of the County was increasing rapidly, there was an evident demand for more Churches and more services, while the health of the Rev. Mr. Green was failing. A division was the natural remedy. No action seems to have been taken furthers however until the year, 1764. In the Journal of the House of Burgesses we read that on November 1st of that year “. A petition from sundry inhabitants of; the Parish of Truro, in the County of Fairfax praying that the said Parish be divided into two distinct Parishes, was presented to the House and read.” It was referred to Messrs. George Johnston and John `Vest, the two Burgesses from Fairfax, to prepare and bring in a Bill agreeable to the prayer of the petitioner. November 3rd. Mr. Johnston presented the Bill for dividing the Parish of Truro, and it was passed on the 6th and agreed to by the Council on the 26th. The Act provided that the division should take place from February 1st, 1765, the line being -“by Doeg creek from the mouth thereof to Mr. George Washington’s mill, and from thence, by a straight line, to the plantation, of John Munroe, and the same course continued to the line that divides the counties of Fairfax and Loudoun.” All between this line and the Potomac was to be the new Parish of Fairfax. Each Parish was to elect its Vestry, at a time and place appointed by the Sheriff, before the second of, the following April. (See Hening, VIII. q.3.) The elections were held in Truro on March 25th and in Fairfax on March 28th.\n\nThis division was exceedingly favorable to the new Parish, but naturally it met with small favor in Truro. Not only was she shorn . of much more than half her strength, but the congregation of Pohick, her one remaining Church, was divided, and Mount Vernon, with several other plantations which naturally belonged to this Church both from proximity and association, was now in Fairfax Parish. Accordingly when the House of Burgesses after a recess of several months, met again in May, we find, under date of May 14 1765, that “a petition of sundry inhabitants of the Parish of Truro, praying a more, equal division of the said Parish, also several petitions in opposition thereto, were presented to the House and read.” These were referred to the Committee of Propositions and Grivances, “to examine into, the allegations thereof, and report the same with their opinion to the House.” Of this Committee Mr. Johnston was a member, as was also George Washington, who at that .time represented the County of Frederick, where he was also a large freeholder. On the 15th the Committee reported two resolutions. First, that the petition from Truro, complaining of the inequality in the late division, and praying that a new division be made, by a line to begin at Clifton’s or Johnson’s ferry on the Potomac and to run from thence to the ford over Dogue run, and on by the line that was afterward adopted, was “reasonable.” Second, that so much of the petition from Fairfax Parish in opposition thereto as prays that if the Parishes, be divided it be by other lines as therein set forth was “also reasonable.” The first proposition was rejected, and the Committee ordered to bring in a Bill in accordance with the second resolution. The new Act was presented the same day and recommitted, reported with amendments on the 22d, passed the aid, agreed to by the Council, and was signed by the Governor on June 1st, so becoming a law on that date.\n\nThe preamble of this Act states that “Whereas it is represented to this present General Assembly that the lines and boundaries whereby the Parish of Truro, in the County of Fairfax, was divided into two distinct Parishes, pursuant to an Act passed for that purpose in the former part of this present session ,of Assembly, have made a very unequal division of the said Parish, by leaving nearly double the number of tithables in the new Parish of Fairfax than there are in Truro Parish, (sic) Be it therefore enacted &c. That the said Act be, and is hereby repealed, and declared null and void. Arid be it further enacted, That from and after the ninth day of June next the said Parish of Truro shall be divided into two distinct Parishes, in the following manner, that is to say; From the mouth of Little Hunting creek, tip the same to the forks thereof; thence up the meanders of the south branch thereof, to the Gum Spring thereon; from thence by a straight line to the ford of Dogue run, where the back road from Colchester to Alexandria crosses the said run; and from thence by a straight line to the forks of Difficult.” All above said lines to be Fairfax Parish, and all below to retain the name of Truro. New Vestries were to be elected in each Parish before the first of August following. Henry Lee, John Baylis. Foushee Tebbs, Allan Macrae, and William Car, gentlemen, were appointed commissioners to adjust and divide the cost of the Glebe and improvements thereon, and of the Church plate, and the 50,000 pounds of tobacco levied for building Churches and not yet expended, between the two Parishes according to the number of tithables in each at the time of the first division. (See Hening VIII. P 57.) A plot and description of the above line, made by the County Surveyor, June 15, 1765, is on record in the Clerk’s office of Fairfax County. It is evident that Washington himself, and his immense estate at Mount Vernon, was the principal bone of contention between the mother and daughter Parishes. The lines proposed ran, the one on the south, the other on the north, of the estate. The one finally adopted divided it, leaving far the larger part, however, with the mansion house, in Truro. That he would take an active interest in the settlement of the question was inevitable, and doubtless his direct agency is to be seen in the compromise petition which found favor with the House of Burgesses and was the basis of their legislation. The Act which was passed may well have been drawn by his own pen. In contrast with the previous Act it is unusually specific in its details, and would seem to indicate the hand of the Surveyor, in its clearly described lines, and of the Church Warden in its accurate enumeration of the property and assets of the Parish.\n\nBut there is another silent witness to Washington’s concern in this division. In the Library of Congress there is preserved, among his journals and some other manuscript papers, a single sheet of foolscap written on both sides in his most formal hand, and giving the result, first of the elections of Vestries for the two Parishes held in March, 1761, under the first Act of Assembly, and then of those held in July of the same year under the provisions of the second Act. The first page shows a large preponderance of , voters in Fairfax Parish at the first elections, bearing out the assertion that the first division was very unequal. The second page, with the simple calculation at the bottom, shows the number of voters in the two Parishes at the second election to have been nearly the same; 334 in Fairfax and 313 in Truro. Later the Vestry Book records that the new division gave to Fairfax Parish 1013 tithables, leaving 962 in Truro.\n\nThis paper shows that at the first election, in 1765, Col. Washington was elected a Vestryman of the first Fairfax Parish, he being, for the moment, a resident therein. The life of this Parish was exactly four months, and of this Vestry elect two months and three days, even if its members ever qualified or met for organization, of which there is no evidence. In July, Mount Vernon having, in the meantime, been restored to Truro, Col. Washington was again elected a Vestryman of Truro Parish, and was not eligible in any other.\n\nAn accurate copy of this interesting paper, as written by Washington, will be found on the following pages, being here published in complete form, it is believed, for the first time.\n\nCopy of Paper in Washington’s Handwriting, Now in the Library of Congress\n\n(First Page) Vestry Chosen for Truro Parish\n\n25th March 1765 Vestry Chosen for Fairfax Parish\n\n28th March, 1765 With the Number of Votes to Each With the Number of Votes to each Mr. Edward Payne 234 Colo.

He thus gave rise to the groundless tradition, which has been so generally adopted and perpetuated by succeeding writers, that Washington served as a Vestryman in both of these Parishes, and presumably at the same time, though Sparks is careful not to assert this. But had he published the whole paper the error would not have arisen.\n\nBishop Meade says he had seen a printed list of these Vestries which was supposed to have come from “A leaf of the old Pohick Vestry Book which had by some means gotten into the Historical Society of New York.” Dr. Slaughter, at, this place, gives this list as “Verified by Mrs. Burton Harrison, who kindly inspected the missing leaf in the New York Historical Society rooms and sent me a copy of it.” This list agrees substantially with that given by Sparks, as do they both, as far as they go, with the original list written by Washington, though both omit the titles before the different names which Washington, with old-fashioned punctiliousness, was so careful to give. The New York list, however, whatever its source, is not from a leaf of the Vestry Book as Bishop Meade understood.\n\nOne frequently, find, the assertion made by careless writers that Washington was a Vestryman of Pohick, or some other, Church. Such at statement is, of course, inaccurate, and Washington himself would hardly have understood what was meant by it. In his day Vestries in Virginia were confined to Parishes, usually containing two or three Churches. Pohick is the only Church remaining which stood in, Washington’s time in the Parish of which he was a Vestryman. The present Falls Church and Christ Church, Alexandria, were built in Fairfax Parish soon after its separation from Truro.\n\nThe Vestry chosen for Truro at the March elections held but one meeting. This was on April 26, 1765, at the house of Samuel Littlejohn.\n\n[We now resume the thread of the History as written by Dr. Slaughter.]\n\nDuring the current year the Minister of the Parish, the Rev. Charles Green, departed this life. There is no formal notice of his decease in the Vestry Book. It was not the custom of the times to pass resolutions on such occasions. It is only referred to in the business items, four months’ salary due being ordered paid to his executor. Falls Church and Alexandria were no longer in Truro, so it became possible to have another place of worship. Accordingly the Vestry rented from Samuel Littlejohn the tobacco house on his plantation, for one thousand pounds of tobacco a year, until a Church could be built in the upper part of the present Parish, he agreeing to keep it clean and provide water for the congregation. An agreement was made with John Robertson to fit up this house with six benches the length of the house and two at the ends; a reading desk and Communion table, with a small window on each side of the desk; to lay plank on the joists the width of eight feet, with a rail in front, and two broad, step ladders, and to stop the eaves; all to be done in tile plainest manner, within six months, for 1400 pounds of tobacco. When the house was given tip the plank used was to remain for the use of the Parish.\n\nThe Rev. James Scott, of Dettingen Parish, the grandfather of the late judge Scott, of Fauquier, often officiated in Truro in the interval between the Rev. Mr. Green and his successor, Mr. Massey. He received payment altogether for forty sermons, at 332 pounds of tobacco each. The Rev. John Andrews, of Cameron Parish, also preached twice, at the same rate.\n\nThe Vestry, (that elected in July,) had a protracted meeting on the 28th, 29th and 30th of November, 1765, when the accounts between the two Parishes were settled as far as could be done at that time. The settlement is spread upon the minutes in full, but is uninteresting.[23]\n\nIt was ordered, That the agreement made with Samuel Littlejohn by the former Vestry be continued; That Elijah Williams be appointed Reader at Littlejohn’s, and that he attend there to read Divine Service every Sunday, and that he be paid at the rate of 1000 pounds of tobacco a year; That Mr. George Johnston be appointed to act as Attorney for the Parish, and that he return a list of all the judgments obtained by him to the Church Wardens by the first of November annually; and That the Vestry meet at Mr. William Gardner’s on first Monday in February next to agree with workmen to undertake the building of a brick Church to contain 16oo superficial feet; the Church Wardens to advertise the same in as public a manner as may be, and each workman to bring a plan and estimate of expense. George Mason and Edward Payne were continued as Church Wardens for the next year, and the latter was appointed Collector of the Parish Levy, giving bond and security as was the custom.[24] John Barry was continued as Clerk of the Vestry; and the third Friday in November annually was appointed as a day for meeting.\n\nPAYNE’S CHURCH\n\n“At a Vestry held for Truro Parish at William Gardner’s on the 3rd and 4th days of February, 1766—Present, Mr. Edwd.

Church Warden Edward Payne, who had been previously directed to enquire into certain deficiencies in the work ordered done on the Fall Church in 1763, reported that he had applied to the persons formerly appointed to view this work and they had denied having had any orders to view the same and refused to concern themselves. Whereupon it was ordered that Thomas Price view the work and report what deficiencies appear therein, that Mr. Payne attend as representative of this Vestry and request the Fairfax Vestry to appoint a workman and one of their members to attend the view on behalf of their Parish. Tobacco on hand was ordered to be sold at July and August Courts.\n\nAt the regular meeting in November the Parish Levy was laid, amounting to 55,860 pounds of tobacco; of which 35,000 was for “building Churches.” Col. George Washington and Mr. William Gardner were appointed Church Wardens for the ensuing year, and were ordered to receive the money due from George `Washington, Geo. Wm. Fairfax, Capt.

Also to advertise the same with a proper description of land and improvements, and the Church plate, in the Virginia and Maryland Gazettes.\n\n“The Rev.

The Church Wardens were ordered to “apply to Maj. Charles Broadwater (the Undertaker of the said work) for the said sum and account with the Vestry of Fairfax Parish for their proportion of the same when it is received.”\n\n“Ordered that a Vestry House be built at the new Church of the dimensions and in manner following Vizt. of Brick, twenty by sixteen feet, with a large inside chimney, nine feet pitch from the Foundation, with Brick or Tile floor, covered with Cypress Shingles, Ceiling and Walls Plaistered and whitewashed, one pannell Door in the broad side, with a Sash Window with twelve Lights and pannel Shutters opposite.

The minutes recite several former orders for the sale of tobacco and payments to be made by the Collector, none of whcih had been complied with except one sale of 15,000 pounds to Mr. Hector Ross, for which his note was now given to the Church Wardens; it was ordered that Mr. Ross pay Mr. Payne what was due him on the second payment for the Church and for the Vestry House when. it should be received by the viewers. And the Collector was to account with the Vestry at its next meeting for the tobacco remaining in his hands.\n\nTHE NEW POHICK CHURCH\n\n1767. The annual meeting for laying the Parish Levy was held November 20th Present, the entire Vestry.\n\n“Resolved, that a Church be built at or as near the Cross Road leading from Hollis’s to Pohic Warehouse as water can be had, which resolution was carried by a majority of seven to five.”\n\nBishop Meade has handed down a tradition as to the part which Washington took in the location of this Church. Although no allusion is made to it in the Vestry Book it is good enough to be true and therefore we reproduce it, as follows: “”The Old Pohick Church was a frame building. and occupied a site on the south side of Pohick run, and about two miles from the present site which is on the north side of the run. When it was no longer fit for use, it is said the parishioners were called together to determine on the locality of the new Church, when George Mason, the compatriot of Washington, advocated the old site, pleading that ti was the house in which their father’s worshipped, and that the graves of many were around it, while Washington and others advocated a more central and convenient one. The question was left unsettled, and another meeting for its decision appointed. Meanwhile Washington surveyed the neighborhood, and marked the houses and distances on a well-drawn map, and when the day of decision arrived, met all the arguments of his opponent by presenting this paper, and thus carried his point.” It was the Vestry, however, and not the parishioners, who fixed on the site. The old site was nearer to Gunston and the new one nearer Mount Vernon.[26]\n\nTo return to this vestry meeting: It was “ordered that Mr. William Grayson be appointed Attorney for this Parish, and that he be paid fees only upon such suits as he obtains judgments for.”\n\nThe Collector being still not ready to settle his accounts a special Vestry was appointed to meet in March following to receive from him the tobacco due, and the Clerk was ordered to give his securities notice thereof.\n\nThe Parish accounts, to meet which the annual Levy was laid, are given in full for this year, Washington having been Church Warden and principal administrator of Parish affairs.\n\nTobacco £. s. d.

Mr. Gardner to have the privilege of exchanging four hogsheads of his own crop for transfer tobacco, and to redeem the money with 2,101 lbs. of transfer tobacco.\n\n“Ordered, that Hector Ross pay out of the money in his hands to George William Fairfax Esqr. the sum of sixteen pounds, seventeen shillings current money, agreeable to the account lodged for surplices and books imported by him for the use of the Parish.”\n\nAt a Vestry held at the new Church, (Payne’s,) September 9th, 1768,[27] to view and examine the work, they found it to be completed according to agreement except the brick pediments over the doors, “And being of opinion that the house can receive no damage from the weather for want of the pediments, and understanding that it is the general desire of the people in this part of the Parish to have the Church received, on account of the great inconvenience they at present suffer for want of it, we do accordingly receive the said Church for the use of the Parish, except the pediments, which the said Edward Payne is still liable for and obliged to finish according to the Articles of Agreement.” Col. George Mason was ordered to make to Mr. Payne the last payment on the Church, and also to pay an account for “making horse-blocks and benches, clearing the Churchyard, and for some additional work done to the Church over and above his agreement, which we think of service and ornament to the’ building.” Messrs.

William Weston’s offer to cover the Vestry House at Pohick, the Vestry finding the nails, and to keep it always clean and in good order for the purposes of the Vestry, for permission to make use of the said house, was accepted. Edward Payne was authorized to open a window in the west end of the upper Church to give light and air to the gallery, and bring in his account. It was Ordered that the Church to be built be of brick, and contain three thousand square feet from outside to outside; and that the Church Wardens give notice in the Virginia and Maryland Gazettes for workmen to attend at Pohick on the first Friday in March with plans and estimates.\n\nAt a Vestry held March 3d. 1769,\n\nPresent, the Rev.

Alexander Henderson and Thomas Ford appointed Church Wardens.\n\n“Alexander Henderson, Gent. one of the Church Wardens for the ensuing year, and Augusus Darrell, having applied for the Collection of the Parish Levy, the said Augustus Darrell is appointed Collector, the Vestry being of opinion that it is improper for any member of the Vestry to be Collector of the Parish Levy. And it is ordered that the same be entered on the Records of this Parish; it having been heretofore customary that the Church Wardens should have a preference of the collection to any other person.”\n\nPeirce Bayly’s account as Collector and Sheriff was approved. It was “Ordered, that William Grayson Esqr. who has heretofore been appointed to prosecute suits for this Parish, be now appointed Attorney in fact for the Parish, and that he receive all Moneys and Tobacco arising from Fines and judgments,, and account with the Vestry annually for the same, at the laying of the Parish Levy.”[31] 1770.

It was ordered to be sold in five lots, and the sale to be advertised in George Town, Alexandria, Dumfries and Colchester. 6 Pounds, 18s. and 8d. were allowed the Collector for prizing the tobacco.\n\n“Whereas it appears that the dimensions of the Altarpiece mentioned in the Articles with the Undertaker for building the new Church, are not according to the proportions of Architecture,, the Undertaker is authorized and desired to make the same according to the true proportions of the Ionic Order notwithstanding. And the Vestry being of the opinion that the stone coins are coarse grained and rather too soft they desire the same may be painted with white lead and oyle, which they think will make them sufficient. The Vestry are also of opinion that the rub’d bricks at the return of all the windows ought to be painted as near as possible the same colour with the arches, and the Undertaker is desired to do the same accordingly.” November 29th. The Levy is laid as usual, and the Collectors and Church Wardens accounts exhibited and approved.

And at the same time that the other six pews opposite them, on the other sides of the long Isles, be also sold to the highest bidder in like manner, or so many of "
