        "text": "MOBILE.\n\nThe rise of the work in the Southern section of Alabama appears in the following, copied from Brother Holcombe's work, and originally written for the Christian Index, March 10, 1836:\n\n\"About 120 years ago a few Frenchmen came here and made the first little opening in the pine forest. Previously to 1817 it was occupied principally as a place of deposit and trade with the Indians. Now its population is not far from 10,000. Eighteen years ago a single steamboat found her way to this port, now forty-five are employed in the Mobile trade. The Baptist church was constituted March, 1835, by J. G. Collins, R. L. Barnes and P. Stout with ten members. Rev.\n\nPage 22\n\nG. F. Heard was called to begin the pastorate February 14, 1836.\n\n\"At that time they had no house of worship, but met in the court house, and for a time they met in the house belonging to the African Baptist Church. The African Church is in a prosperous condition; their number is about 90.\"\n\nIn this city and county the colored people had more liberty and better treatment than in any other section of the State. The free people and those who hired their time often supported schools for the education of their children. Revs. Wm. Dossey, P. Stout, A. Travis, J. H. Schroebel, Mr. Hawthorne and Mr. Spence (all white) are mentioned as pioneers and fathers of the work at this point. Near this old French town, June 13, 1845, the writer was born, and in this county and city he spent the first fourteen years of his life, and many years since. For some years prior to the late civil war, the Stone Street and St. Louis Street churches (colored) were both noted for their numbers and their financial strength.\n\nSTONE STREET CHURCH.\n\nThis is the \"mother church.\" The father of the Rev. J. B. Hawthorne, in the early part of their history, served them as pastor, receiving a regular salary of them. At the close of the war, Mr. Spence was their pastor, since which time they have been under the leadership of the Rev. B. J. Burke, a man who in many regards is as strong as he is peculiar. This church, however. has not done much in the way of missions, and not a great deal for education. One of the peculiar customs of the pastor is to \"bless children.\" Standing in the pulpit, he holds the child up in his arms while he prays God's blessings upon it.\n\nA case of discipline which came up, in this church many years ago, led to the formation of the St. Louis Street Church, and I am sorry to say gave birth to a very bitter sectional\n\nPage 23\n\nfeeling between the two bodies, which feeling has long been a blight to the Baptist cause in South Alabama.\n\nThis church is stubbornly set against all secret societies, so that no secret society people are allowed in its membership. The pastor is elected for life. For the support of its poor it has a fund which is called the \"Church Treasury.\"\n\nST. LOUIS STREET CHURCH.\n\nThis church was for many years especially noted for its missionary enterprise. To this church Alabama owes many of her pioneer preachers. The late Rev. Charles Leavens, who was pastor just after the close of the war, sought to send a pioneer, an organizer, into every section of the State. Their house of worship cost, I am told, about $24,000, and is a two-story brick structure. Since the war their pastors have been: Revs. Charles Leavens, I. Grant, A. Butler, C. C. Richardson, and the present occupant, Rev. Mr. Frazier. This church seems now in full sympathy with its past missionary record, over which no one rejoices more than the writer, since it is from this church that he, under God, received his commission to preach the gospel of the Son of Righteousness.\n\nST. ANTHONY STREET CHURCH--NOW FRANKLYN STREET.\n\nThis church deserves honorable mention. Rev. A. F. Owens led to the purchase of the property on St. Anthony street, and served as pastor for several years--1878 to 1889. Rev. A. N. McEwen, the present pastor, advised the church to sell and purchase at a more desirable point. They are now buying a building on Franklyn street, This church has had an earnest class of workers, who have made great and painful sacrifices for the cause.\n\nPage 24\n\nUNION CHURCH.\n\nThis church is another secession from Stone Street. It, too, has some strong people in it. Rev. A. F. Owens is pastor.\n\nThere are other churches around worthy of mention. So much is said only to show the rise and progress of the Baptist cause in this section of Alabama. The great need here is more brotherly love, instead of the bitter prejudice which withers every hope of united effort. Of course, many of the good people are already free from its fearful influence, but far too many are still slaves to it.\n\nAmong the founders, or ante-bellum members of the colored Baptist work in Mobile, we find the names of Rev. Charles Leavens and wife, James Somerville, Judge Europe, Thomas Sawyer, Rev. B. J. Burke, and Crawley Johnson.\n\nHUNTSVILLE, MADISON COUNTY.\n\nHere is where our Statehood was born, the Constitution being formed here in 1819. Huntsville is our State's first capital. Taking Mr. Hosea Holcombe as authority, the first Baptist church organized in Alabama was constituted within a few miles of Huntsville, in 1808. Their constitutional membership was eleven, and Rev. John Nicholson was their first pastor. The first negro Baptist church constituted in this section of the State was the African Baptist Church of Huntsville, organized about the year 1820. I say 1820, for the reason that in 1821 they are recorded as entering into the Flint River Association, with seventy-six members. Rev. William Harris, \"a free colored man,\" is mentioned as their first pastor. It seems that Brother Harris soon fell under the influence of a white preacher, William Crutcher, and became established in the faith of the Primitive Baptists. Over\n\nPage 25\n\nseventy years have passed away, and still Rev. Bartlett Harris, a grandson of Rev. William Harris, is preaching the \"election of grace.\" Instead of seventy-six Missionary members, there are now about two thousand Primitives. The Rev. W. H. Gaston is the leading educator among them. He is a man of quiet and humble spirit, and is now trying to establish a school at Huntsville. How we Missionaries need a school in Madison county! Our little Missionary church seems bound hand and foot. At this writing, Rev. Oscar Gray is pastor, and he seems to do as well as circumstances allow.\n\nPerhaps I cannot close this notice of Madison County more profitably than by directing the attention of the reader to the vast consequences, in the form of false views and false practices, which came of one man's decisions. Rev. William Harris decided to follow Mr. Crutcher, and now thousands of people walk in his track as anti-Missionaries.\n\nPERRY AND HALE COUNTIES.\n\nAt Salem Church, near Greensboro, the Alabama State Convention (white) was organized October, 1823, not quite forty-five years before the organization of the Colored Baptist Convention in 1868, and its first anniversary was held at Marion, in Perry County.\n\nReference is made to these facts in order to introduce other facts bearing a closer relation to ourselves. Within a circle of twenty-five miles of Marion--and Greensboro, is near this point--some of the mightiest influences in support of Baptist views have risen up and gone forth upon the colored Baptists of Alabama. The colored people of Marion, and throughout the country around, are hardly less noted for their refinement than they are for their Baptistic opinions. In this section arose those colored men of power and of pioneer\n\nPage 26\n\nMrs. A. A. Bowie, Instructress in Dressmaking, Selma University.\n\nPage 27\n\nfame--Revs. James Childs, the first pastor of the Marion Church (colored); Henry Stevens, first pastor of the Greensboro Church, and John Dosier, so long pastor of the church in Uniontown. This point, till right recently, has been the educational center of our white brethren, and here in Marion, the first colored State Normal school began, as the result of the influence of the late Hon. A. H. Curtis, of Baptist fame.\n\nMONTGOMERY CITY AND COUNTY.\n\nBaptist principles manifested themselves in this part of Alabama about 1818-19 in the constitution of the Elim Church, near the city of Montgomery, and Messrs. J. McLemore, S. Ray, and W. J. Larkin, are mentioned as pioneers.\n\nA STRAW WHICH SHOWS WHICH WAY THE WIND BLOWS.\n\nIn Dr. Riley's \"History of Alabama Baptists,\" we have the following: \"A negro slave, named Cæsar, a bright, smart, robust fellow * * * was ordained to preach. His ability was so marked, and the confidence which he enjoyed was so profound, that Rev. James McLemore would frequently have Cæsar attend him upon his preaching tours. He was sometimes taken by Mr. McLemore into the pulpit, and never failed of commanding the most rapt and respectful attention.\"\n\nTo the credit of the Alabama Association, it is written that they bought this man and gave him his liberty that he might preach among them the gospel of Christ; and it is said, that though he was as black as a crow, he traveled alone and unharmed on the mission of life. Thus the negro appears in the foundation of gospel operations in Central Alabama. Here also appear the victories of the gospel leaven, the triumphs of the love of God over those hearts wherein Christ was king.\n\nThe price paid for Brother Cæsar Blackwell is given as\n\nPage 28\n\n$625. Catching inspiration from the encouragement before them in the form of their brother Cæsar Blackwell's success, and the good will of the Christian white people to whose fellowship they belonged, Nathan Ashby and Jacob Belser (colored) soon became active workers.\n\nTUSCALOOSA AND JEFFERSON COUNTIES.\n\nPerhaps the first church (white) organized in Jefferson county was organized about the year 1818. Dr. Holcombe's history tells us that in 1823 the \"Rock Creek Church,\" in Tuscaloosa county, received into its membership from South Carolina an African preacher, Job Davis. Mr. Holcombe says of him: \"He was an acceptable preacher, a man of deep thought, sound judgment, and was well skilled in the Scriptures of Divine Truth.\"\n\nThe venerable Mr. A. J. Waldrop, of Birmingham, informed the writer that when a little boy he heard Job preach in a camp meeting. He said: \"The meeting had been in progress a week or so, and mother and father went to the camp on Sunday morning. The meeting was very cold. Brother Holcombe was wondering who would be the fit preacher to open the day's services, as Job, now free from his daily toil, walked into camp. As Brother Holcombe saw him, he remarked: 'There is our man.' Job was led up to the stand and invited to go up and take a seat. Job replied: 'No, I'll stand down here in front of it.' Job then reached back to the top of the stand and took off the Bible and opened it. I can never forget the deep thrill of devotion which Job's person and manner turned in upon the audience that day; something of the feeling is with me yet. He had hardly parted his lips before men and women began to sob. When he was through with his sermon, it was plain to all that the meeting was no longer a dead meeting. This was the beginning\n\nPage 29\n\nof a revival which affected much of Tuscaloosa county.\"\n\nMr. Holcombe says of Job, in another place in his book: \"Job was brought from Africa to Charleston, S. C., in 1806; professed religion in 1812; soon learned to read and write; taught Sunday school for two summers in Abbeville district, S. C.; licensed to preach in 1818; came to Alabama in 1822; died November 17, 1835, in Pickens county. He lived the Christian, he died a saint.\"\n\nFurther, Mr. Holcombe says: \"In those days we had but few better preachers than Job.\"\n\nThus it appears that not only in wars for independence, but in gospel labors as well, the negro is in the foundations of this country.\n\nRev. Prince Murrell, who had bought himself some time before the days of the Emancipation, opened the work at Tuscaloosa on the dawn of freedom. Rev. Messrs. M. Tyler and M. D. Alexander came into the van at Lowndesboro.\n\nLEE, MACON, BULLOCK AND BARBOUR COUNTIES.\n\nAt Tuskegee, in Macon, was the Rev. Doc. Phillips (a blacksmith), a man who, it seems, refused to accept his freedom at the hands of his white brethren in order that his preaching might be more acceptable to his people in slavery.\n\nAt Auburn, in Lee, was the Rev. Thomas Glenn, a man respected and trusted no less by his white neighbors than by his own people for his genuine piety and honorable life.\n\nIn Barbour and Bullock, Revs. Jerry Shorter, M. Coleman, William McCoo and Deacon J. E. Timothy possessed the spirit of leadership, and moved forward in the work of organization upon the appearance of liberty. Rev. E. Thornton soon appears.\n\nPage 30\n\nGREENVILLE, BUTLER COUNTY.\n\nIn this town and county the Rev. Stewart Adams is the pioneer. In 1872 or 1873, he was appointed missionary under the American Baptist Home Mission Society, and was thus enabled to extend his operations, which resulted in the organization of one of the first associations (Union).\n\nSELMA.\n\nSomewhere between 1840-45, a colored church was organized in Selma, the first colored leader of which was a Mr. Samuel Phillips, a man who obtained his liberty (so the late Mr. A. Goldsby reported) by some service he rendered the country in the Mexican war. A. Goldsby and Charles White (late treasurer of our Convention) were principal persons in the organization.\n\nSo much has been said to show the ante-liberty growths. It seems fitting to close this chapter with the appearance of freedom as the writer saw it.\n\nFrom the days of my earliest recollection, freedom's shadowy forms moved before the eyes of the Southern slave. He felt or thought that he felt--he saw or thought he saw--the touch and visage of approaching liberty. In subdued tones it was whispered upon ears that could be trusted, that slavery, with all its accompanying horrors, was soon to be a thing of the past. Praying bands were organized and met in distant groves to pray for liberty. Gathered beneath the sighing trees and nightly skies, they whispered their agonies upon the ears of the Almighty--whispered lowly, lest the passing winds should bear their petitions to the ears of the overseer or master. And often--as with Daniel and, his companions in Babylon--the God who reveals secrets to them that love him, uncovered\n\nPage 31\n\nbefore our minds coming events, which caused us to laugh and cry. But we kept these things in our hearts, and it was a wonder to all around that the slave could sing in his furnace of hot afflictions. God, in unfolding hope, was with us in the fire, and so we were sustained.\n\nDREAM TELLING.\n\nThey fall to dreaming: Contending armies are seen in battle, and the one favorable to the liberty of the slave is seen to prevail. Old trees appear to wither and disappear before trees of new sort.\n\nThe war cloud bursts and the slave mingles his prayers with the roar of the booming cannon, tarrying on his knees while the American soldiery contend in mortal strife. It was understood to mean liberty. At last the deadly struggle ceased, and emancipation was declared. It was only the dawning, and therefore the light was dim.\n\nTHE BITTER BUD.\n\nOne of the saddest mistakes of the slave was, that he thought so muchof the pleasures of freedom and so little of its weighty obligations. To him, freedom meant mansions, lands, teams, money, position, educated sons and refined daughters, with the liberty to go and to act as he pleased. If he might have burdened his mind with thoughts of his sore destitution of heart, of intellect, of purse; if he might have thought of his poverty as to skill in the arts, sciences and professions of life, as to social status, as to domestic relations, as to opportunities to succeed in a wrestle for life by the side of the victorious white man--if he might have seen that to make himself a strong manhood was his first and his most important duty--if his mind might have been full of these thoughts, it had\n\nPage 32\n\nbeen a thousand fold better for him. But, as his mind was on pleasures, he was disappointed when they proved only phantoms, and hence the bud of liberty was bitter.\n\nIndeed, to those who had the ability to discern, the first view of liberty was frightful in proportion as it was seriously considered. Naturally, as the shackles suddenly fell off, there was such a forcible rebounding of life, as in many cases made liberty mean license to live idle and lewd.\n\nI can never forget my first impressions at the full view of freedom. O, what helplessness appeared in our condition!\n\nEvery day, for weeks, shoeless and hatless men and women, with half naked, hungry children, passed through the little town where I lived, not knowing whither they went, what were their names, nor what they sought. A certain man, when I first met him, was introduced to me as Mr. M--. A little after this, I was surprised to find that he was not Mr. M--, but was Mr. R--. And my ability to be surprised was considerably lessened when I finally learned that Mr. R-- was now Mr. H--.\n\nLong and anxiously I waited for the appearance of some great colored men to assume leadership in matters of religion and education, but I waited in vain. My heart ached as though it would break, and was at last only partially relieved of its weight when my brother (Rev. J. Gomez) and I had built an humble house in which to worship God and teach the children. Into this we, boys though we were, called the people to meet to hear the reading of the Scriptures and to pray.\n\nORGANIZATION IN ALABAMA.\n\nIn 1864 there were four Colored Missionary Baptist Churches in Alabama, owning property worth about $10,000. Two of these were located in Mobile city--the Stone and the\n\nPage 33\n\nRev. L. S. Steinback in the Act of Baptism.\n\nPage 34\n\nSt. Louis Street Churches. Another was located in Selma, and is now known as the First Colored Baptist Church.\n\nOf course there was no association, no convention, no graded school of learning. The colored people of Mobile enjoyed superior advantages over those of other sections of the State and hence many of them had made fair attainments in letters. But in all the State there was but one Baptist preacher, to the writer's knowledge, in April, 1865, who could, with any degree of honesty, claim to be an educated Baptist negro preacher. This was one Rev. Moses B. Avery. I think he is now in Mississippi. Anyhow I know that soon after the close of the war he joined the Methodist brethren and left the State. It will be seen, therefore, that he was no help to the Colored Baptists of Alabama.\n\nThe change which the war had wrought as to the civil status of the black man, changing him from slave to freedman, affected his church standing, so that ex-master and ex-slave did not quite fit each other in the old \"meeting house,\" as they had done in days of yore. There was restlessness on one side, and suspicion on the other. The black man wanted to go out and set up housekeeping for himself, while the white man in most cases feared and hesitated to lay on the hands of ordination. We did not know each other. The \"negro preacher\" on one side of the river had but little opportunity to know his brother on the other side. Truly our beginning was dark and chaotic.\n\nIt is said that necessity is the mother of invention. In all ages of the world, and with all peoples, want--a sense of need--has gone before human creations. The black man of the South was like, in this, the balance of human kind. When set at liberty, he was for some time lost in looking upon the wonderful changes that had passed over him. But when he came to himself he began slowly to realize his needs. He\n\nPage 35\n\nbegan, for example, to feel the need of church and of school, and out of this feeling of want on these lines there arose thought, discussion, plan, action. Those who were of like faith and gospel practice began to meet for prayer and for conference, and at last to unite in church covenant, forming churches. Then churches, under the leadership of progressive men, were joined in associational compacts. They met first only to sing and pray, and listen to talks from white brethren. Want increased; burdens increased; the horizon of duty and possibility widened. Under a sense of duty and repeated exercise, mind and heart developed into greater strength and into greater capacity for thought, plan, speech, and execution. Kindred spirits sought each other's fellowship and counsel, and talked about the work which might be done. Soon it was felt by some that a general State Convention was both necessary and possible. The desire, plan and call for such an organization ripened among the brethren at and around the Capital City. Perhaps Montgomery was foremost, for the reason that here was the legislature, and here the colored people saw most of deliberative bodies, and heard most about their needs and opportunities.\n\nPage 36\n\nMrs. Dinah Smith Jordan, Birmingham, Ala.\n\nPage 37\n\nII. THE STATE CONVENTIONS\n\nFIRST SESSION.\n\nThe Colored Baptist Convention of Alabama was Constituted December 17, 1868, in the Columbus Street Baptist Church, in the city of Montgomery.\n\nThe officers elected were: Rev. Nathan Ashby, president; Rev. J. W. Stevens, of Montgomery, vice-president, and Bro. H. Thompson, secretary.\n\nThe following appear in the roll of this session: Revs. N. Ashby, J. W.

Talliaferro (white), agent for the American Baptist Home Missionary Society; Lewis Brown, of Sumter county; A. Cunningham, of Conecuh county, and James Caldwell, of Marengo county, appear in the roll of this session. Fifty or sixty churches were represented; several hundred dollars were raised; the missionary was short in his collections; Home Mission Society was endorsed.\n\nTHIRD SESSION.\n\nThis session was also held in Montgomery on October 5, 1870. As Rev. N. Ashby was sick, Rev. W. Stevens, the Missionary, was elected president, and Rev. M. Tyler vice- president. Rev. Charles Leavens, of Mobile, and Senator A. H. Curtis were enrolled.

Alexander, B. Bibb, J. Caldwell and J. Belser have passed away.\n\nPage 39\n\nAbout $300 sent in by the churches: twenty-eight churches report Sunday Schools; three Associations appear by their messengers.\n\nFIFTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Selma, November,Tuscaloosa, November, 1873. 1872. Officers of previous year re-elected. A committee is appointed to confer with the white Convention in session in Eufaula. Two more Associations are enrolled. $300 or $400 collected.\n\nSIXTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Tuscaloosa, November, 1873. The officers elected were: Rev. J. A. Foster, Montgomery, president; Rev. M. Tyler, Lowndesboro, vice-president; Rev. P. Murrell, treasurer; and Bro. H. J. Europe, of Mobile, clerk. Three other Associations reported. Rev. A. Butler, Mobile, joined at this session. Rev. W. H. McAlpine introduced the following, which was adopted:\n\n\"Resolved, That we plant in the State of Alabama a theological. school to educate our young men.\"\n\nThis threw life and aim into the Convention and the signs of activity immediately appeared. Four other Associations entered. Lively discussions ensued. The white Baptist Convention assembled in the same city at the same time advised against the educational scheme. The question whether God needed help in preparing his ministry-- the question which fifty years before had agitated the white Convention of Alabama-- was now stirring the souls of black men. Sunday Schools were allowed representation in the body.\n\nSEVENTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Mobile, in the St. Louis Street Church, November, 1874. Officers of previous year were re-elected. Brother\n\nPage 40\n\nMcAlpine's school resolution was endorsed and ordered on the minutes. On motion of Brother McAlpine the following persons were appointed a committee to manage the school project: Revs. A. Butler, W. H. McAlpine, H. J. Europe, H. Thompson and the writer. Brother McAlpine was authorized and requested to spend six months as missionary and agent of the Convention. Much praying.\n\nEIGHTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Mobile, November, 1875. The officers elected were as follows: Rev. J. A. Foster, president; Rev. M. Tyler, vice-president; Rev. J. W. Stevens, corresponding secretary; Rev. Thomas Smith, treasurer, and Rev. C. O. Boothe, clerk. Ten Associations were enrolled this year. Brother McAlpine reported $90 in favor of the Convention as the result of six months' work. The body was never so much aroused as during this session. Some trouble arose over contentions among the churches in Mobile. Rev. W. H. McAlpine was appointed missionary and agent of the Convention for the ensuing conventional year. Rev. C. O. Boothe was appointed, with Brother McAlpine, to aid in searching for a suitable location for the proposed school, and was authorized to call the attention of our Northern brethren to our needs and operations regarding educational facilities in Alabama. Never did any set of men appear to be more earnest and enthusiastic. Every eye was on McAlpine as the leader.\n\nNINTH SESSION.\n\nHeld with the Mount Canaan Church, Talladega, November 16-20, 1876. Officers: Rev. M. Tyler, president; Rev. B. J. Burke, vice president; Rev. I. Smith, treasurer; Rev. G. C. Casby, Montgomery, corresponding secretary, and Rev.\n\nPage 41\n\nC. O. Boothe, at this time pastor in Talladega, was continued as clerk.\n\nThis session of the body may be denominated \"The Eventful Session.\" Here the sainted Woodsmall was met for the first time, and bore the Convention the following:\n\n\"INDIANAPOLIS, IND., November 11, 1876.\n\n\"Dear Brethren of the Convention:\n\nOn behalf of the Indiana Baptist State Convention, I greet you with this epistle, bearing their congratulations and sympathy. We are engaged in a common cause with you--the cause of our blessed Lord and Master. * * * So we strike glad hands with you for a renewal and continuance of the gospel warfare till Jesus comes.\"\n\nThis bore the signature of Dr. Wyeth, editor of the Journal and Messenger, and the Secretary of the Indiana Convention. This was good tidings, and the information that Brother Woodsmall had come to hold Ministers' Institutes among us was still better tidings. Thenceforward we were to drink from a very high type of manhood.\n\nRevs. W. J. White, F. Quarles, and Bryan, of Georgia, came with propositions from the Georgia Convention that Alabama should give up her school project and join Georgia in building a school at Atlanta.\n\nA letter received from, Dr. S. S., Cutting, corresponding secretary of the Home Mission Society, to the clerk, informed the Convention that his board had no help for our school enterprise in Alabama, and favored our union with Georgia. A communication from the white Baptist Convention containing the following, was read before the body:\n\n\"Resolved, That we deem this a suitable occasion to express to our colored brethren an abiding interest in their welfare, both temporal and spiritual.\n\n\"JOHN HARALSON, President.\"\n\nPage 42\n\nBrother McAlpine turned over $1,000, which he had raised for the proposed school, and again took the field\n\nThe clerk, as committee on location of the proposed school, reported that if the school should be located at Marion, Ala., our students could obtain scientific and literary training in the State school at that point, in which case, the Convention would only be obliged to furnish theological instruction. The Convention did not decide as to the course it would be best to pursue. Brothers Pettiford and Barton joined the work in this session, and the former took a prominent position at once.\n\nTENTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Eufaula, November, 1877. The officers of the last convention were re-elected. The school project was turned into the hands of the Board of Trustees elected at the session of 1875. The report of the Board of Trustees recommended that the school be located at Montgomery. When a motion by Hon. A. H. Curtis to substitute Marion had been lost, Rev. E. K. Love, of Georgia, moved to substitute Selma, which was carried by a majority of three. The Board was authorized and instructed to begin operations. Revs. W. H. McAlpine and W. J. Stevens were put out as missionaries. Before leaving Eufaula, the Board appointed a committee to act on their behalf with regard to the management of the school. At a meeting of the Board held in Selma, December 20, the committee reported : \"Your committee has been unable to find a suitable house for rent in which to commence school for less than $27 per month. There are one or more buildings here that may be purchased at quite a reasonable figure. W. H. McAlpine, J. Blevins, H. Stevens, committee.\"\n\nAt this meeting there were present the following trustees, besides those above mentioned: M. Tyler, C. Blunt., J. W.\n\nPage 43\n\nStevens, J. Dosier and A. H. Curtis. Revs. W. H. McAlpine and J. Blevins, with Bro. A. H. Curtis, were empowered to act as Executive Committee of the Board. After some discussion as to whether to rent or purchase, it was voted to rent, and not to pay over $15 per month. The Committee was so instructed, and was further instructed not to assume over $50 per month for teaching force. The Committee elected Mr. H. Woodsmall, of Indiana, and he at once opened the school in the St. Phillip Street Baptist Church.\n\nOn May 30, 1878, the Board held another meeting in Selma. Present: Revs. M. Tyler, J. Blevins, G. C. Casby, Thomas Smith, J. Dosier, H. Stevens, W. H. McAlpine and C. O. Boothe. At this meeting the Committee were authorized to purchase the \"Old Fair Grounds\" for $3,000. The Baptist Pioneer was started, with W. H. McAlpine, editor; J. Dosier and C. O. Boothe as assistants. The Committee, to the great satisfaction of the Board, reported that the St. Phillips Street Church had donated to the school the use of their audience room, the oil for lights, and fuel, and also that the services of Bro. W. R. Pettiford had been secured at a cost of $20 per month, allowing him time to take lessons in theology.\n\nThe following financial report was submitted:\n\nRECEIPTS.\n\nUniontown Association . . . . . $150 00\n\nAlabama District Association . . . . . 40 00\n\nRev. A. Cunningham, Conecuh County . . . . . 30 00\n\nDeacon A. Scott, Montevallo . . . . . 15 65\n\nRev. Thomas Smith, Treasurer Convention . . . . . 100 00\n\nMr. H. Woodsmall, for tuition . . . . . 82 10\n\nRev. W. H. McAlpine . . . . . 20 00\n\nDonations from the North were also reported.\n\nPage 44\n\nELEVENTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Marion, November. 1878. The officers of the previous year were re-elected, with the exception of Rev. Boothe, who had been appointed Sunday school missionary for the State, under the American Baptist Publishing Society. Bro. N. R. Nickerson was elected clerk.\n\nThe Trustees reported that the Old Fair Grounds had been secured, and that the school was in operation. One thousand dollars had been paid on the grounds; $545 had come from the North. Three teachers were supported without charge to the State--Misses Emma Jordan and Emma Heustis, and Mr. M. W. Alston.\n\nThus the school began. About $2,000 reported.\n\nTWELFTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Opelika, November 12-15, 1879. In this session Rev. A. F. Owens joined, and Revs. A. Butler and B. Burke forsook the Convention. Rev. D. M. Phillips, of Tuskegee, had left the cross for the crown.\n\nThe second $1,000 had been paid on our campus, and $700 worth of improvements had been added to the buildings. A missionary society organized by President Woodsmall and operating in the St. Philip Street Church, is reported as giving partial support to Profs. Alston and Pettiford, and to students D. T. Gulley and J. C. Curry.\n\nTHIRTEENTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Marion, November 17-20, 1880. The officers elected were: M. Tyler, president; J. A. Foster, vice-president; N. R. Nickerson, clerk; G. C. Casby, corresponding\n\nShiloh Baptist Church, Birmingham, Ala., Rev. T. W. Walker, Pastor.\n\nPage 45\n\nsecretary, and C. White, treasurer. Except a small balance due Brother Woodsmall the school was now free from debt, besides owning thirty-six acres of land and temporary buildings.\n\nRev. S. Adams had gone to the other world.\n\nAided by the Selma Missionary Society, Bros. K W. Alston, L. Ellington, D. T. Gulley, D. L. Prentice, C. Travis, C. R. Rodgers, L J. Green and J. C. Curry had done effective missionary work.\n\nBrother Woodsmall reported that the Baptist Pioneeris free of debt and has $321.03 in cash. He had received $2,399--$899 had come from Alabama in tuition and donations, and $1,500 from the North.\n\nThe American Baptist Home Mission Society at this time adopted the school and engaged to give it $2,000 during its session of 1880-81. About $400 were spent on improvements of school grounds. Rev. Wm. A. Burch, late of Philadelphia, now pastor of the First Baptist Church in Selma, and Rev. W. W. Cully, a returned African Missionary, were members of this Convention. Brother McAlpine had raised from all sources 61,976.85. Before the next session Brother McAlpine at Brother Woodsinall's request, became president of the school.\n\nFOURTEENTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Mobile, November, 1881. The officers of the previous year were re-elected. Revs. A. Cunningham, Belleville, J. Blevins, Selma, and J. Cole, Montgomery, are no longer on earth.\n\nThe Home Mission Society gave $3,000 to the present school session. Dr. M. Stone, of Ohio, taught in the school without cost to the board of trustees.\n\nBefore the next session Rev. H. N. Bouey, from South Carolina, became State Sunday School Missionary.\n\nPage 46\n\nFIFTEENTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Tuscaloosa, November, 1882. Former officers re-elected, except that Rev. J. Dosier was made vice-president.\n\nThis year, the same as last, Brother McAlpine was retained president of the school.\n\nTotal receipts from Alabama, including tuition fees were $2,588. Donation from Home Mission Society $3,350. The last session made Brother Pettiford financial agent, and the present session was greatly encouraged in view of his excellent success.\n\nSIXTEENTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Selma, November, 1883, in the First Colored Baptist Church, of which the writer was pastor. Rev. E. M. Brawley, late of South Carolina, was made president of our school, Rev. W. H. McAlpine having resigned in his favor.\n\nAlabama paid $2,511 towards our educational work. Bro. Woodsmall was not present. Rev. A. N. McEwen, late of Tennessee, now pastor of Dexter Avenue Church, Montgomery, was present this session. Rev. H. N. Bouey was made financial agent.\n\nSEVENTEENTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Mobile, November, 1884. Officers of 1882 and 1883 were re-elected; $3,224 reported as coming from the State.\n\nBefore the next session \"The Minister's Union\" was organized in Talladega, with Rev. C. O. Boothe as secretary, and W. H. McAlpine, president.\n\nEIGHTEENTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in the Sixteenth Street Church, Birmingham, November, 1885. Officers of previous session re-elected. On the 10th of November, one day prior to the sitting of the Convention,\n\nPage 47\n\nthe Ministers' Union met and appointed a committee on the character of the author of this pamphlet, and which reported the following:\n\n\"We, your committee appointed on Bro. C. O. Boothe, beg leave to submit the following: On account of the complications of his marriage relations, his oppositions to the State work, and on account of his want of loyalty to truth, we recommend that we withdraw from him the hand of fellowship as a minister. C. S. Dinkins, J. Q. A. Wilhite, J. Dosier, committee.\"\n\nThe brother, who was excluded (?) by the adoption of this report, asked and was allowed to put in the minutes of the Convention the following:\n\n\"To all who may read the resolution passed by the Alabama Baptist Ministers' Union bearing upon me, I affirm my innocence of each and all the charges therein presented, and appeal to the King of Kings, whose just judgment I patiently await.\n\nC. O. BOOTHE.\"\n\nDark times follow upon the work and upon many individuals. The total receipts for this year, as reported by Bro. Bouey, were $2,200. Rev. J. P. Barton was made State missionary, and Rev. J. Q. A. Wilhite was made financial agent of the school.\n\nThe school was getting into debt, and serious losses threatened. The founders of the work were not sufficiently willing to confer with each other.\n\nNINETEENTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Opelika, November, 1886. The same officers were re-elected, except Rev. J. A. Foster replaced Rev. John Dosier as vice-president. Rev. C. L. Purce was made president of the school, Dr. Brawley having resigned. The school was $6,000 or $7,000 in debt. A resolution looking toward moving the University from Selma was adopted. Marion was proposed instead of Selma, and the larger cash donation was\n\nPage 48\n\nto fix the location. The contest was heated, and here and there rather ugly. The Baptist Leader favored Marion. Finances were rather short. Revs. G. W. Berry, from South Carolina, and E. J. Fisher, of Georgia, were present at this session.\n\nTWENTIETH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Montgomery, in the Columbus Street Church, July, 1887. The Ministers' Union rescinded their vote passed in Birmingham in 1885, bearing upon the character of Rev. C. O. Boothe. Rev. W. R. Pettiford, of Birmingham, was elected president, and Rev. R. T. Pollard, clerk. Rev. William J. Simmons, of Louisville, district secretary of the American Baptist Home Mission Society, and Bro. Woodsmall, were present. Mrs. M. A. Boothe, president of the State W. C. T. U., addressed the Convention. Mrs. C. Thompson, agent in Alabama for the Women's Home Missionary Society of Chicago, also spoke. Stormy time, and no small amount of bitter feeling. The financial vote sustained Selma, and the University remained at the home of her childhood.\n\nDebts were threatening our property. Mr. Purce endeavored to prevent any increase of debts.\n\nTWENTY-FIRST SESSION.\n\nHeld in Tuscaloosa, July, 1888. Officers of previous year were re elected. About $4,000 was raised this year. Dr. W. J. Simmons, district secretary of the Home Mission Society, was present with plans for missionary co-operation with our State, which were endorsed. Some of the school grounds had been sold to meet debts, six acres having gone to meet the $7,000.\n\nRev. W. R. Forbes, of Virginia, pastor at Eufaula, was\n\nPage 49\n\npresent. The board recommended Rev. W. H. McAlpine as State Missionary under the joint plan with the Home Mission Society.\n\nTWENTY-SECOND SESSION.\n\nHeld in Selma, July, 1889. Officers of previous session were re-elected. Rev. C. S. Dinkins, having severed his connection with the faculty of the University, was successfully operating an academy at Marion in connection with his pastorate. This project the Convention, on motion of Rev. A. N. McEwen, endorsed. Rev. C. O. Boothe was appointed General Missionary of Alabama on the joint plan with the Home Mission Society. This year our women, under the leadership of Miss S. A. Stone, gloriously rallied to the support of the University. About $5,700 was raised in the State. Rev. Washington Stevens, Montgomery, and Deacon D. Lane, Greensboro, had passed away. Time of session was again changed to November. Brethren R. T. Pollard and D. T. Gulley made Sunday Missionaries under the Publication Society on the joint plan. During this year, in May, a jubilee meeting was held in Selma and over $2,000 was raised. In this jubilee meeting we met Rev. H. Stevens the last time on earth.\n\nTWENTY-THIRD SESSION.\n\nHeld in Sixth Avenue Church, Birmingham, November, 1890. The officers of the previous session and all the missionaries were re-elected. The Home Mission Society gave about $6,000 to Alabama, including $2,600 given for University buildings. The financial agent, President Purce, and the missionaries all made very encouraging financial reports--thousands of dollars having been collected ($5,400). Dr. W. J. Simmons and Rev. Henry Stevens crossed the dark river this year. Drs. Clanton and Brawley were present. This was\n\nPage 50\n\na good session--debts fast disappearing under the industrious and wise financiering of President Purce and Agent Wilhite. The missionaries were continued.\n\nThe Baptist Leader (once The Baptist Pioneer), which for several years had been successfully run by Editor McEwen, was continued under its old management.\n\nThis year, in July, a Baptist Congress was held in Montgomery in the Dexter Avenue Church. It was entertaining and instructive. Also in August a State Sunday School Convention was organized in Union Springs, with Rev. S. Jones as president, and is still doing a grand work, Brother Wells being still presiding officer.\n\nTWENTY-FOURTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Peace Baptist Church, Talladega, November, 1891. The same officers were re-elected, and also the same missionaries, except that Rev. C. R. Rodgers was chosen to fill the place made vacant by Bro. Pollard's resignation. A grand session--never before in our history had our business seemed to be so much in the hands and hearts of wise, cultivated men and women. The Rev. Mr. Parks and Hon. James White, of Chattanooga, were with us. The mayor of Talladega, pastors of white churches, and everybody else, gave us a word of encouragement and expressed themselves as pleased and profited by our presence. Prof. Peterson, a recent member Of the faculty of Selma University, was introduced to Alabama Baptists. One hundred and fifty churches and forty associations, besides Sunday school conventions and Sunday schools, were represented by two hundred messengers. The year's income from all sources was reported by financial agents as footing up to $12,440. Statistical secretary reported as follows: \"Seven hundred and eighteen churches and fifty-eight associations.\n\nPage 51\n\nTwenty-eight of the associations give an aggregate membership of 83,000. Thirty associations have failed to report their numbers.\"\n\nDr. C. S. Dinkins had been operating an academy at Marion, for the use of which he had paid $1,000. Our school property increased in value from $3,000 to $30,000. The president of our Convention, W. R. Pettiford, was at this time president of a successful banking enterprise. Last, and perhaps least, one of our number had made an humble contribution to the literature of the denomination in the form of a little book entitled \"Plain Theology for Plain People.\" Thus had we grown in twenty-four years.\n\nBefore the next session Dr. McAlpine was made teacher of institutes, under the Southern Board.\n\nTWENTY-FIFTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Franklyn Street Church, Mobile, November, 1892. Dr. Dinkins was elected president, and Rev. J. P. Barton, vice-president. With these exceptions, the old officers, as well as missionaries, were continued. Editor W. H. Stewart, of Kentucky; Dr. Clanton, of Louisiana; the Rev. Mr. Luke, field secretary of the Foreign Mission Convention; Revs. T. L. Jordan and C. L. Fisher, of Mississippi, were present. For the most part, this was a good session. However, there were signs of a rising stormcloud, which, it was feared, foretold approaching evil; and perhaps a clogging of our educational and missionary operations would then soon come. A good money showing was made, and new financial plans were adopted. Dr. Pettiford was appointed financial agent and secretary. It was decided to attempt to establish two academies--one in Mobile and the other somewhere in Northern Alabama. Before the next session of the Convention, Rev. C.\n\nPage 52\n\nO. Boothe resigned his position as general missionary of the State and pastor at Meridian, Miss. Dr. Purce severed his connection with the University, and Dr. C. S Dinkins was elected president in his stead. A division of the denomination was threatened in consequence of the presidential changes.\n\nAgain our debts were beginning to be a menace.\n\nTWENTY-SIXTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Eufaula, November, 1893. Rev. J. P. Barton of Talladega, was elected president, and Rev. R. T. Pollard, secretary. Hon. Ad. Wimbs, of Greensboro, was a member of this Convention. Drs. Morehouse and McVicar, of New York, were with us; also Dr. Crumpton, who represented the Southern Baptists. Many changes were made upon the Board of Trustees. A committee was appointed to plan a change in our school charter. The session was stormy and far from pleasant. Dr. Pettiford made a good financial report. Rev. S. L. Ross was Sunday school missionary. Dr. Dinkins made a good beginning as president of Selma University. Rev. Lewis Brown was elected treasurer.\n\nTWENTY-SEVENTH SESSION.\n\nHeld in Mt. Zion Church, Anniston, Ala., November, 1894. Rev. J. P. Barton was again elected president, and Rev. R. T. Pollard continued as secretary. Times peculiar and money scarce. President Dinkins had prevented any increase of the debt of the University, and continued to grow in favor with all sections. The session, however, was not so orderly as it might have been, if there had been less personal feeling and ambition, and more real humility and consecration.\n\nPage 53\n\nCOMPARISONS.\n\nTrue, our white brethren were hindered by the wild forests, which were pathless and bridgeless, fieldless and cribless, and by the savage beasts and friendless red men, as well as by the slowness of travel, but after all, we may be permitted to compare our progress with our white brethrens' struggles on educational and missionary lines; and I think the foe will feel more hopeful of us, while the friend will see reason for encouragement and pleasure. The white Convention organized in Salem Church, near Greensboro, in October, 1823, but they did not begin a school till 1834--eleven years. We organized in 1868 and started a school in 1878--ten years. Their school continued only about five years, when their property was sold to pay their school debts. Our school still continues at this writing--1895. In 1839, they passed a resolution to encourage young men to study for the ministry under capable pastors, and the money of the Convention was ordered to be paid out in support of operations on this line.\n\nThey now owe on Howard College, so I am informed, some $30,000 or $40,000 in the form of a bonded debt, the interest on which they find it hard to pay. Indeed, I very much regret to hear that they are thinking of making an assignment in the interest of their creditors. On careful examination of the records of the Convention, we come upon the following important facts and lessons:\n\n1. The blindness of the leadership as to the work to be done.\n\nIn the jubilee meeting, Rev. H. Stevens, said: \"When I resolved in 1868 to meet the call of the Montgomery Church for a Convention of delegates, I didn't see what we could do. I went only out of some sort of curiosity to meet other brethren, and to look on. I got a little light before I reached Montgomery, as I listened to some things Brother McAlpine had to\n\nPage 54\n\nsay along the way. And I was not much better off when the Convention closed. I did not know what they were talking about one-half the time.\" But few saw one inch ahead. The horizon increased only as we advanced. We grew up with the growth of the work.\n\n2. The power of faith to give form and fixedness to ponderous enterprises.\n\nWe vacillated till Brother Woodsmall appeared, so far at least as our school project was concerned. As the queen bee draws together her wandering swarm and fixes them in settled habitation and orderly toil, so did this saintly man do for the colored Baptists of Alabama. And his spirit is still among us.\n\n3. Progress is born of progress.\n\nBecause we gained one step, we gained another step. Because we made it to the top of one mountain, we could therefore make it to the top of another.\n\nPage 55\n\nIII. ASSOCIATIONS,\n\n[Under this head appear many points and facts of local interest.]\n\nALABAMA DISTRICT.\n\nThis District was organized in 1869 by Revs. N. Ashby, M. Tyler, W. Stevens, J. A. Foster, Wm. Jenkins and other leading men of Montgomery and Lowndes counties. From their birth to this time, as an Association, they have been leaders in missionary and educational operations.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nAmong the leading men of this body we may mention: Rev. M. Tyler, Lowndesboro; Revs. R. T. Pollard, M. D. Brooks, E. W. Picket, A. Moore, G. McKinney, A. Campbell, and D. Ware, Montgomery; Revs. M. C. Merrell, James Davis, and A. J. Knight, Fort Deposit; Revs. P. Gilchrist and B. Moss, Hayneville; Revs. C. H. Payne, S. M. Reeves, and C. P. Cain, Letohatchie; Revs. J. H. Smith and E. Elias, Tallassee; Revs. E. W. Jones, M. Snowdon, L. Barnett, A. Dansey, M. C. Williams, L. Calvary, D. Hall, J. Morris, H. W. Tarrant, W. Harris, D. S. Adams, M. E. Pleasant, post office unknown.\n\nThey report about 12,000 members. Their annual donation for general purposes averages $300 or $400. This body contributed largely toward the purchase of our school property, and now liberally supports the school. Rev. S. Jones, Mt. Meigs, is a strong man in this Association, and no man in Alabama has done more for the education of his parishioners than he. Rev. J. C. Curry, also of Mt. Meigs, is one of their\n\nPage 56\n\nRev. F. R. Kennedy, Pastor Galilee Baptist Church, Anniston, Ala.\n\nPage 57\n\nmost scholarly men and most able preachers. They talk of dividing into two bodies, hoping thereby to accomplish more for the furtherance of the gospel.\n\nALABAMA MIDLAND ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1889, is a small body operating chiefly in Montgomery county. They report six churches. Could not ascertain the membership.\n\nRevs. B. Bible, B. Coles, W. Harrison and T. L. Lewis lead them. I submit the following as good supplementary matter to what has been said of the above Associations:\n\nMONTGOMERY.\n\nTHE FIRST COLORED BAPTIST CHURCH\n\nWas organized in the basement of the white Baptist Church (First Baptist Church) just after the close of the war. The corner stone of their present building on Columbus street was laid in 1867. Their first pastor was the late Rev. Nathan Ashby, who, prior to the war, had preached to the colored membership on Sundays in the afternoon, in the basement of the white church. Mr. Ashby being stricken down by paralysis, closed his pastorate in 1870. Under his pastorate this church issued the call for the first session of the State Convention in 1868; hence this church is the source--the mother--of our Convention.\n\nFor a few months the Rev. J. W. Stevens supplied the pulpit.\n\nIn 1871 the late Rev. James H. Foster was called to the pastoral office, which he served for the space of twenty years, leaving it only to answer the summons of his Master to appear in purer and higher spheres. Under his administration the church increased its membership from a few hundred to\n\nPage 58\n\nseveral thousand. He expended some $10,000 or $12,000 on the present edifice. Under his pastorate the Foreign Mission Convention was organized in 1880.\n\nAfter Mr. Foster's death, December 1, 1891, Rev. A. J. Stokes, then pastor at Fernandina, Fla., was called to their pulpit, and now serves with great success, having added within the last two months about 500 by baptism. So far, his success is a wonder to the people of Montgomery. The special item under his administration is the organization of the young people for training and work.\n\nOld Brother Boykin (about 85 years old) in speaking of the work about Montgomery, said: \"The first colored preacher I saw after coming from Charleston, was Bro. Cyrus Hale. He came from South Carolina. He was an old man when I first met him. He was well read, was a good preacher, and the white people 'lowed him to go anywhere there was a call for him. He was the father of the work in this section. Following him, was Bro. Jacob Belser, and then came Bro. Nathan Ashby. Brother Hale must have been ordained, for he used to baptize in slavery time.\n\nWhile we were worshiping in the white church, we had some 'sistant deacons--Bros. Fayette Vandeville, Jerry Fye, Peter Miles and Abe Blackshear.\"\n\nRev. William Jenkins relates the following: \"I was born in Montgomery in 1836, and have been here every since. I began to speak in public in 1852, and continued to speak in the city and on neighboring plantations all the while. I was allowed to read the Bible, but I had rather been caught with a hog than with a newspaper; because, for the hog, I was likely to get a whipping; but for the newspaper I might get a hanging. And there was some faith them times. On a plantation out here where I used to preach, there was a balloon coming down one day. The overseer and the people saw it, and\n\nPage 59\n\nas that was a new thing with them, it frightened them, and everybody fled except one brother, who, on seeing the man in the balloon, and believing that it was the Lord, ran towards the descending balloon, exclaiming as he looked up: 'Lord, I's been looking for you for so long a time, and now you's come at last!' The balloon man said: 'Go away, boy; I'm nothing but a man.'\"\n\nMontgomery is no longer what it was when, thirty years ago, Bro. Ashby spoke in the afternoon in the basement of the white church. Six colored Baptist churches now worship within the city and suburbs of Montgomery. The edifice of Dexter Avenue Church, standing near the first capital of the ex-Confederacy, is one of the most substantial and neat brick structures hi the city, and the congregation which worships therein are people of money and refinement. Messrs. H. A. Loveless, the coal dealer, William Watkins, the contractor, and Charles Steers, the upholsterer, are owners and managers of large affairs, involving thousands of dollars.\n\nThe colored people of this city own many hundred thousand dollars in real estate. Mr. Billingslea, the barber, is said to own $300,000. Dr. Dorsett runs a successful drug business in one of the lower departments of a two-story brick building owned by himself. The widow or the late Hon. James Hale was built and is maintaining an infirmary for the sick poor people of her race.\n\nContrast this state of things with thirty years ago, when the colored people, like \"dumb driven cattle\" before hound and lash, wended their way in the \"death march\" of slavery, and ask if the negro of to-day is the negro of thirty years ago. There is on Dexter avenue, in the city of Montgomery, an old brick building wherein the trader used to pen his slaves to await his purchasers. Herein the\n\nPage 60\n\nwriter organized the Dexter Avenue Church. Compare the occupants of the slave pen with the audience in Dexter Avenue Church.\n\nDEXTER AVENUE CHURCH.\n\nThis church is a secession from the Columbus Street Church, occurring in the latter part of the year 1877. Its first meeting, with a view to organization, took place in the parlor of Mr. Samuel Phillips. The chief persons in the constitutional membership were Messrs. Samuel Phillips, John Phillips, Alfred Thomas (the father of Mrs. S. H. Wright), C. Sterrs, William Watkins and H. A. Loveless. The meeting for the recognition of the church was held in a hall on Dexter avenue, January, 1878, which in former days had been used as a slave trader's pen. Dr. J. B. Hawthorne, pastor of the First Church (White), with his deacons, represented the white brethren, and Rev. J. A. Foster, pastor of the Columbus Street Church, represented his church.\n\nThe writer was the first pastor, but owing to embarrassments which soon followed, he did not remain long in charge of the work. Revs. J. W. Stevens, F. McDonald, J. C. Curry, A. F. Owens, T. Fryerson, A. N. McEwen, Dr. Langridge and others followed in the pastoral charge. The progress of the church was rather slow till the time of Mr. McEwen, under whom their present beautiful building was erected. The present pastor, Rev. R. T. Pollard, seems to be appointed the task of leading not so much on lines of material development as in lines of spiritual growth. Many other good and pious persons have been added to their number, so that no church in the State can now boast of a people more thrifty, aspiring and refined.\n\nAUBURN ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1870 by Revs. T. Glenn, A Phillips, I. M. Pollard and others. This body operates chiefly in Lee, Macon\n\nSelma University, Selma, Ala.\n\nPage 61\n\nand Tallapoosa counties. In the beginning of Selma University they contributed largely toward its establishment, and have since given it liberal support. Lately, however, they are struggling, under the leadership of Mr. and Mrs. Wells, to plant a school in Opelika. They number about 8,000 members.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nRevs. Glenn and Phillips have left the cross for the crown. Among the present leadership we have the names of Revs. J. R. Howard, M. M. Archer, A. Walton, K. T. Young, T. N. Huguely, J. Wood, G. Germany, H. Clark, A. M. McArthur, G. Moore, J. Jones, J. Thomas, J. T. Torbert, E. L. Goer, M. M. Ross, E. White, E. L. Simms, F. T. Holmes, D. Upshaw, C. Young, E. Cain, R. Burton, J. David, P. Davis. Rev. I. T. Simpson, one of the strongest men in the State, is now in this body as pastor of Opelika.\n\nThe school project in Opelika speaks well of its supporters and deserves to succeed. May God bring them in the path of success. The writer regrets to record that he saw something at one session of this body that was by no means creditable to it. It was this selling business. The grounds about the church were almost covered with cake stands, etc., and the sermons could scarcely be heard for the noise made by the salesmen. Associations ought not to meet with any church which does not pledge itself to keep such off the grounds. The Associations of our white brethren are not troubled with such ugly conduct. The communities in which religious bodies convene should do all in their power to bring about the devotional spirit, the spirit of sincere worship.\n\nPage 62\n\nAUTAUGA COUNTY ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1882, reports about 2,000 members.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nJones Switch Post Office--Rev. M. Clark.\n\nMilton--M. Underwood, J. C. Parker, D. Love, H. Taylor.\n\nIndependence--William Mims.\n\nPrattville--William McLinn.\n\nVerbena--C. Price, P. Dejarnet, D. Gresham.\n\nBirmingham--E. Goodson.\n\nDeatville--A. C. Roundtree, A. J. Jones.\n\nAtaugaville--E. Nun.\n\nBozeman--J. H. Brumby.\n\nMessrs. J. Coles, W. Cooper and J. W. Carroll have served as clerks. They, too, are recorded as contributing for educational purposes.\n\nBETHLEHEM ASSOCIATION.\n\nThis association was organized in 1868, and has given more students to Selma University than any other association in the State, nor has any other been more liberal in its gifts of money. A calculation would, perhaps, show that they had not paid so much as the Alabama District and the Uniontown, but it will be remembered that those are the giant associations, having 10,000 or 12,000 members, while this body has not more than 6,000. Rev. C. Roberts, one of the founders of this body, in his opening speech before the session of 1892 said: \"When we began, not one among us could write. We organized in Tuscaloosa, and when the work was done, it seemed so insignificant an idea that we had attempted to constitute and operate an association that it took us two days to accept and recognize what we had done. But see what we are now, and what we have done! Of our own sons and daughters, we have with us to-day teachers of the State schools,\n\nPage 63\n\nteachers in universities, teachers of music, persons of character and of learning. I never in my life, thought I would see so much education in black people.\" The \"Jones Creek Church,\" the church with which the association had convened in the above named session, was the name borne by the white church organized about 1830, which long ago had become extinct. Rev. L. Brown, who now owns a good part of his old master's plantation, presided at this session, and Rev. I. Dawson was clerk.\n\nTheir minutes give the following churches and ministers:\n\nSherman Post Office--Galilee, Antioch, Little Zion, Mount Tabor.\n\nWarsaw--Mount Pleasant, Union Grove.\n\nCataba--Christian Valley, Friendship, Mt. Tabor, Mt. Pleasant.\n\nWhitfield--Ebenezer.\n\nBoligee--Mt. Zion, Bethlehem, St. Paul, St. James, Mt.

Common.\n\nPage 64\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nRevs. G. Young, T. Grant, G. Lowe, J. S. Boatright, I. Dawson, L. Brown, C. Roberts, E. Grant.\n\nThere are other strong men among them whose names I could not obtain.\n\nRev. Daniel Griffin, pastor at Gainsville, has especially commended himself for his studiousness, spotless name, and earnest work. Many of our best young men, teachers and preachers, come of this association.\n\nBIBB COUNTY ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1885, report a membership of about 8,000. The post offices of their several churches are given as follows: Calera, Jemison, Strasburg, Lomax, Clayton, Shiloh, Randolph, Traveler's Rest, Maplesville, Briarfield, and Ashley.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nThe list which the writer found was not full, but we have the following: Revs. H. Zimmerman, Clanton; H. E. Make and A. Thomas, Calera; C. Gentry, Randolph. I am informed that Revs. J. R. Scott, J. S. Printice, J. W. Witherspoon and W. T. Goodson are also members of this body.\n\nBLADEN SPRINGS ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1876, reports about 2,000 members.\n\nPOST OFFICES OF CHURCHES.\n\nBladen Springs, Cunningham, West Bend, Rescueville, Coffeeville, Dead Level, Mt. Sterling, Frankville, Ararat, Campbell, St. Stevens.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nRevs. C. Long, of Bladen Springs, P. D. Alford, of Cunningham; R. Lewis, F. White, R. Whitley, O. S. Yorke, J.\n\nPage 65\n\nWhigman, B. White, E. A. Reed, B. Woodson, A. S. Cessions, C. L, Davis, and L. W. Morris. The writer baptized Rev. P. D. Alford about twenty-five years ago, while doing mission work in Mississippi.\n\nRev. Charles Long was one of the first colored men to begin teaching and preaching after the war. He stands as an honest businessman, as well as preacher of the gospel.\n\nBROWNVILLE ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1883, is a small body composed of about twenty churches, which have the following post offices: Phenix City, Gerard, Motts, Columbus, Ga., Hatchechubbee, Ladonia, Crawford, Uchee.\n\nOFFICERS LAST REPORTED.\n\nModerator--Rev. L. D. Harris, Gerard.\n\nClerk--Rev. J. F. Torbert, Hatchechubbee.\n\nTreasurer--Bro. H. Dixon, Phenix City.\n\nThey number about 2,000 members.\n\nCANAAN (PICKENSVILLE) ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1876, is operating chiefly in Fayette county. The writer cannot give their membership, but they report eighteen or twenty churches.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nRevs. G. H. Prewett, W. Bozelle, J. P. Neal, J. M. Maddox, S. Clements, G. W. Brent, A. G. Johnson, J. H. Evey, I. Bizzell, L. W. Bridges, R. L. Gorden, L. Neal, A. B. Richardson.\n\nRevs. J. M. Maddox and J. W. Glasscox seem to be at least the peers of any in their ranks.\n\nPage 66\n\nMrs. M. D. Duncan, Principal Female Academy, Demopolis, Ala.\n\nPage 67\n\nTHE COLORED BETHLEHEM ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1871, reports about 3,500 members. This is the body so long guided by the late Rev. Armstead Cunningham, Bellville. This aided in the purchase of our property at Selma.\n\nPOST OFFICES OF CHURCHES.\n\nEustis, Grove Hill, Dixon's Mill, Whatley, Thomasville, Glover, Atkerson, Choctaw Corner, Myrtlewood, Putman, Clifton, Octagon.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nRevs. C. L. Robertson, H. W. Mitchell, C. L. Davis, E. P. Yow, W. Thomas, P. Kimbrough, J. Williams, M. Dosey, J. M. Houston, R. F. Forman, F. Johnson, A. L. Cleveland, A. Charles, W. M. Kimbrough.\n\nDALLAS COUNTY ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized 1872, is a large body, operating in the \"Black Belt.\" They have about 4,000 members. Support educational enterprises.\n\nPOST OFFICES OF THEIR CHURCHES.\n\nCrumpton, Gee's Bend, Lasso, Linden, Cylonia, Orrville, Portland, Cahaba, Lower Peach Tree, Selma, Brown's Station, Gaston, Rehoboth, Hazen, Uniontown, Martin Station, Boguechitto, Hamburg.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nD.

Waller, J. Watts, N. Jones, R. Murry, L. Bryant.\n\nRev. D. M. Coleman deserves praise for his persistent\n\nPage 68\n\nstruggles after education. In spite of every hindrance he, at rather a late point in his young manhood, started and completed a course in Selma University.\n\nEAST PERRY COUNTY ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1885, is a small body, and the Writer has learned but little of them.\n\nLEADING MEN\n\nRevs. J. A. Jemison, C. Casby, G. S. Bolling, F. Chandler, S. Morse, C. McCord.\n\nEVERGREEN ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized 1878, reports about 3,500 members. They liberally support educational and missionary enterprises.\n\nPOST OFFICES OF THEIR CHURCHES.\n\nEvergreen, Dunham, Joyville, Fairfield, Red Level, Mason, Brooklyn, Grovella, Garland, Andalusia, Castleberry, Brewton, Williams' Station, Pollard.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nRevs. L. and N. Hawthorne, G. Donald, J. Wallace, P. Monroe, A. Clairborne, S. Union, J. McCrery, S. I. Shannon, Z. Michael, J. Salter, R. McCrery, D. May, R. Ingraham, D. Shepard, C. C. Lucious, and C. Jackson. They want to establish a high school at Evergreen, where Rev. L. Hawthorne is now engaged in teaching and preaching.\n\nTHE EUFAULA ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1867, is perhaps the oldest Colored Association in Alabama. Its chief founders were: Revs. William McCoo and Jerry Shorter, and Deacons J. E. Timothy, of\n\nPage 69\n\nEufaula, and Byrd Day, of Glennville. This body is peculiarly organized on some lines. For example: Their Sunday School work is divided into districts, which districts, under their several leaders, bold so many meetings a year at different centers of the population. A carefully prepared program is carried out, led on by certain persons who have been previously named and informed. And they have a preachers' association.\n\nPOST OFFICES OF CHURCHES.\n\nEufaula, Clayton, Glenville, Hurtsboro, Lofton, Pittsboro, Midway, Hatchechubbee, Seale, Jerigan, Cowikee, Oatston, Oswichee, Coal Ridge, Louisville, Hawkinsville, Guerryton, Abbeville, Three-Notch, Enon, Cochran, Batesville, Eufaula is the leading point in the district.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nRevs. G. W. Webb, J. D. Maddox, Wm. Williams, James Peterson, L. F. O'Bryant, I. Bostic, N. Bostic, Eufaula.\n\nRevs. W. R. Forbes, E. A. McCall, Columbus, Ga.\n\nRevs. Wm. Pattrick, E. P. Pattrick, Wm. Blakely, Clayton.\n\nRev. J. Q. A. Wilhite, Selma.\n\nRevs. J. H. Upshaw, T. H. Mitchell, Hatchechubbee.\n\nRevs. A. A. Rivers, J. J. Young, Midway.\n\nThe author has been unable to obtain the post office address of the following names: Revs. S. Allen, R. H. Wright, T. Thomas, C. H. Ammons, P. Shorter, J. Torbert, M. Davis, P. Battle, G. W. Moore, L. B. Mitchell, R. Turpin, P. Johnson, E. R. Joseph, E. Crawford. For several years Rev. L. P. Foster has been the missionary for this body.\n\nBro. Byrd Day, a pioneer in this part of the State, relates the following interesting story: \"As I could read in the days of slavery, and as the people on the place wanted to know the sayings of God, as they called the Bible, they bought me a\n\nPage 70\n\nBible and got we to read for them. We slaves were allowed night farms in those days. An acre or so of land was given to each person wanting to work at night. Well, in order that I might study the Bible, the other slaves on the place worked my patch for me. So I studied the book and read it to them.\"\n\nThe writer once spent a month in Eufaula giving Bible instruction to ministers, and was paid by the \"Ministers' Association.\"\n\nFLINT RIVER ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1884, is a small body of less than 1,000 members, and is the result of a secession from the Muscle Shoals Association. Rev. F. A. Chapman is its principal founder and perhaps is their strongest man.\n\nMINISTERS.\n\nRevs. F. A. Chapman, C. M. Davis, C. C. Matthews, Flint Station; G. W. Garth, Crowton; R. Wilhoit, Cedar Plains ; B. M. Key, D. Ward, S. M. Robinson, Somerville; A. Brown, S. Gains, A. It. Eason, Huntsville; C. Davis, Whitesburg; W. T. Connor, Madison; E. Powell, Hillsboro.\n\nThe writer has greatly enjoyed their quiet spirit and earnest labors. However, he saw at their last session (1894) a rather ludicrous point or gesture in the pulpit exercises. A brother, who is known to be an upright man, as well as a very earnest and industrious man, was making some remarks on the closing sermon of the session, when, becoming very happy, he made a leap upward, which caused his brethren to fear lest there would be a bruise, either in the ceiling, or on top of the minister's head. I would have, if I could have done so with propriety, urged the brother to remember that \"bodily exercise profits little, while godliness is profitable unto all things,\" and that \"the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet,\"\n\nPage 71\n\nand \"let all things be done decently and in order.\" However, I remember the day when most of the white preachers in Alabama had in their sermons what some people are disposed to call \"the holy tone,\" which was often accompanied by quite a lot of physical exercise. This has become a thing of the past with them in proposition, as they by culture, have been raised to see that Christianity is Christly believing and Christly living. By the same process, the same conditions will come upon us. So, we will still labor and still wait.\n\nFRIENDSHIP WESTERN UNION ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1891, is a small body operating in a section lying South of Anniston and Oxford.\n\nPOST OFFICES OF THEIR CHURCHES,\n\nWedowee, Lineville, Rockdale, Graham, Beason's Mill, Heflin, Louina, Micaville, Lamar, Edwardsville, Truet, Gay.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nRev.

Culbertson, are mentioned among the principal pastors.\n\nGOOD SAMARITAN ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized 1881, has some eighteen or twenty churches. The copy of the minutes in the hand of the writer fails to give the membership of the churches.\n\nPOST OFFICES OF CHURCHES.\n\nFarmersville, Gordonville, Selma, Bragg's, Furman, Montery, Haynesville.\n\nPage 72\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nRevs. Wm.

Archibald, Bridgeville; D. C. Salmon, Bridgeville; R. Richey, Pickensville; J. Goodwin, Raleigh; J. T., Atty, Memphis, Ala.; J. G. Johnson, Carrollton; J. Clark, Ehren; James Howard, Pickensville. Brother Archibald is liberally educated, teaches school, and is a progressive man on all lines.\n\nLILY STAR ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1885, contains only about 1,000 members.\n\nPOST OFFICES OF CHURCHES.\n\nTrio, Brierfield, Centerville, Harrisburgh, Scottsville, Green Pond, Blocton, Vance.\n\nPage 73\n\nPASTORS.\n\nRevs. T. M, Parker, W. A. Parker, John Bolden, J. A. Foster, S. Page, H. S. Thompson, G. W. Glenn, G. Calhoun.\n\nMOBILE SUNLIGHT ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1887, operates chiefly in Mobile, Baldwin and Washington counties.

Agee, James Brock.\n\nPage 74\n\nMORNING STAR ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1874, is operating in Coosa and Elmore counties. Their membership is about 2,000. They have been rather separated from the general work, but perhaps, it is owing to the fact that their location has made it rather difficult for those who have represented the enterprises of the denomination to reach them.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nRevs. L. W. Whitaker, Rockford; M. C. Crosby, A. L. Swindall, A. M. Snowdon, A. Jones, J. A. Baker, E. D. Howell, L. W. McNeely, R. T. Lewis, J. H.

Peele, S. D. Sanders, William Walker, E. E. Perryman, R. H. Vogle, M. C. Adams, J. P. O'Riley, A. A. Scott, L. V. Ellison, J. E. A. Wilson, V. Huntington, F. M. Miller, B. P. Palmo, H. Neally, F. C. Chandler, S. M. Hall, H. Zimmerman, S. L. Belser, W. E. Craddock, J. B. Gardner, S. A. Latham, Van B. James, P. Woollen, L. J. Green, R. Johnson, L. W. Wells, J. M. Anthony, L. C. Jones.\n\nAs educators, they have Messrs. T. H. Posey, J. C. Barker, F. P. McAlpine, and A. J. Edwards. Rev. L. D. James is missionary of their district. Their membership is about 6,000, and their church property is worth not less than $50,000.\n\nPage 77\n\nBIRMINGHAM CHURCHES.\n\nThe oldest church in the city is the Spring Street Church, Rev. L. J. Green's church, but the Sixteenth Street, Sixth Avenue, and Shiloh Churches are the most influential churches. The Sixteenth Street Church was organized in 1873, it appears, and her pastors appear in the following order: Revs. J. Readon, W. Reed, A. C. Jackson, W. R. Pettiford, and T. L. Jordan. In a property point of view they owe much to Rev. A. C. Jackson, under whom they obtained the present church lot, three other lots, and a small frame building, say about $5,000. This $4,000 or $5,000 went toward the erection of their brick edifice, erected under the pastorate of Rev. W. R. Pettiford. They owe about $3,000 on their building, the payment of which has been much hindered by the scarcity of money. In all the most progressive plans of gospel work in this section, this church has led the way; and their advance on these lines is chiefly due to the presence of Dr. Pettiford and the missionary ladies. The Sixth Avenue Church is the next to appear. Its pastors have been: Revs. Silas Jones, T. W. Walker, J. W. White. They have recently offered the pastoral charge to Rev. J. Q. A. Wilhite, who is expected to assume management this month (May, 1895). They are in debt also.\n\nThe church that is the marvel of the city is the Shiloh, under Rev. T. W. Walker. This church was organized May 3, 1891, as the result of preaching service supported by a society known as the \"Christian Relief Association.\" They now have the smallest debt, the largest house and the largest congregation in the city. Often when 1,200 or 1,500 people are in the house, a good part of the street is full of persons who are anxious to approach near enough to hear. Of course the pastor is the source and center of this successful church, but\n\nPage 78\n\nhe has been fortunate in drawing about him some very business-like as well as very agreeable people. The following anniversary program, etc., will give in idea of the church's operations and system. (This program, with facts like it, is given for its suggestiveness):\n\nMAY 3, 1891 MAY 3, 1895\n\nFOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF SHILOH BAPTIST CHURCH, OF BIRMINGHAM, ALA.\n\nThe anniversary of the above named church will be held on Friday, the above date, at the church on Avenue G, between Eighteenth and Nineteenth streets.\n\nAll churches in the city and vicinity are cordially invited to be present and take a part in the exercises, as those present will have the privilege to speak on the subjects after they have been submitted to the assembly. The following will be the programme for the day.\n\n9:30 to 10 A. M.--Opening.\n\nDevotional exercises and responsive Scripture reading.--Psalm 24.\n\n10 to 10:30--\"The Work of the School,\" by Mrs. Laura Emmons. Discussed by Rev. J. A. Peel, of North Birmingham.\n\n10:30 to 11--\"The Work of the B. Y. P. U.,\" by Miss Georgia Battles. Discussed by Rev. J. E. A.

How different things are now from what they were in 1835, when Job Davis, the African preacher, toiled by the side of his fellow slaves all day and dreamed at night of his far off home over the great sea! Now in the valley where his famous camp-meeting sermon melted the heart of the white people into a condition of submission to Jesus and into hope of the coming world--where the black man knew only spade, plow and hoe--we have the Negro M. D., Negro druggist, Negro dentist, Negro banker, Negro author, Negro merchant, Negroes worshiping in brick churches, Negro scientists, and white people using Negro inventions. Here are Banker B. H. Hudson, Druggist I. B. Kigh, Drs. Goin, Brown, and U. G. Mason, Inventor Andrew Beard, with orators and educators many. \"What shall the harvest be?\"\n\nPage 82\n\nMiss Hardie Martin, Teacher in Public School, Montgomery, Ala.\n\nPage 83\n\nTHE MULBERRY ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1882, is composed of only a few churches, chief among which we may mention: Mt. Zion, Mt. Pleasant and Spring Hill, Elba post office; Mt. Calvary, Damascus and Antioch, Rose Hill post office; Friendship and Pleasant Ridge, Henderson post office, Mt. Olive and St. John, Luverne post office. They have between 1,200 and 1,500 members.\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nRevs. G. Stringer, M. H. Henderson, G. B. Gibson, C. P. Larkin, D. F. White and J. S. Lee.\n\nMUD CREEK ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1873, is a small body of very poor churches, located in Jackson county. There were a few rich slaveholders in said county, among whom was the Rev. Charles Roach, Sr. On his plantation there were three preachers, one Methodist and two Baptist. The Baptist preachers were Thomas and Perkins. Like many other ex-slaves, they retained the name of their master, and became known as Revs. Thomas and Perkins Roach. Rev. Robert Caver, at an early date after the close of the war, came into the county a Baptist preacher. These men became the organizers of the work in this county. The county is no longer so full of colored people as once it was, and hence the churches are very small and can't support their pastors. Revs.James Larkin, Lewis Roach, T. J. Roach, Lewis Henshaw, F. Cobb, C. L. Lovelady, J. W. Robinson are doing what they can to keep up the work but they labor under great difficulties. It is the purpose of some to attempt to establish a school at Hollywood. If this project should mature there is a prophecy of better conditions in time to come.\n\nPage 84\n\nMUSCLE SHOALS ASSOCIATION\n\nIs among the largest and oldest Associations in the State, having been organized in 1869 by Revs. Henry Bynum, Wm. Coleman and W. E. Northcross, aided by Dr. Joseph Shackelford (white), of Trinity. I was with them as they met in the session of 1893 in the Courtland Church. In 1827, a Mr. D. P. Bestor, a white minister, preached in this section and began the work of organizing among the whites. I was told that the white church, constituted in Courtland in 1827, had long passed away and that of their building \"one stone was not left upon another.\" Only the vacant church lot remained to tell of what had been. The white people were gone we knew not how nor whither, but that the gospel which they had preached was blooming like a green bay tree in the hearts of their ex- slaves, this large Association was tangible evidence. The Rev. John Belle reminded his brethren that the time had been when he was the only man in the body who could write and when committees went out to consult and agree, and then returned to submit verbal reports, which he as clerk was expected to formulate. He compared this state of things with the present condition, wherein the writer was the rule and the non-writer the exception.\n\nThis body is noted for church building. The people in Huntsville and Sheffield owe their buildings to the plan and liberality of this Association. The Rev. Paul Jones, for many years their moderator, was full of missionary zeal and wise plans, and pushed things in all directions. His death caused them a great loss.\n\nTheir minutes give the following churches and pastors: Tuscumbia church, Rev. W. E. Northcross; Courtland and Sheffield, Rev. G. B. Johnson, of Courtland; Red Bank and Iuka, Rev. John Belle, of Courtland; Pleasant Grove, Mt. Zion and Little\n\nPage 85\n\nZion, Rev. E. M. James, of Courtland; Russellville and Florence churches, Rev. E. C. White, of Tuscumbia; Mount Olive, Rev. L. Warren, of Leighton; Palmetto, Rev. M. Jones, of Russellville; Galilee and Mount Pleasant, Rev. B. King, of Leighton; Town Creek and Moulton, Rev. A. J. Owens, of Moulton; Mount Moriah, Rev. H. R. Baker, of Tuscumbia; Macedonia, Rev. A. Troupe, of Town Creek; Elm Grove, Rev. William Weaver, of Oakland; Mount New Home, Rev. William Morris, of Leighton; Huntsville Church, Rev. O. Gray, of Huntsville; Cave Springs, Zion and Bethel, Rev. James Hampton, of Leighton; Zion No. 2., Rev. J. H. Betts, of Florence; Cater's Branch, Rev. A. Davis; St. Peter's, Rev. H. L. Ellis, of Flint; Jerusalem and Salem, Rev. D. Jackson, of Tuscumbia; Mt. Olive, Rev. G. S. Ricks, of Leighton; Decatur Church, Rev. M. J. Hooks; Hillsboro, Rev. B. Swoope; Baptist Chapel, Rev. James Young, of Florence; St. Paul and Hopewell, Rev. S. Wadkins, Tuscumbia.\n\nThey report church property worth about $25,000. Their principal work has been in the way of starting missions and building churches. They have 6,000 members, and an excellent territory, but they greatly need a school. Professors H. H. Stewart, of Courtland, and J. P. Gettis, of Decatur, and Dr. Sterrs, of the same place, are the most advanced men of their fellowship. Dr. Sterrs is a successful young physician as well as preacher.\n\nNEW PINE GROVE ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1878 and is a secession from the old Pine Grove. They have, perhaps, about 2,000 members in the following churches: At Troy--Pine Grove, Holly Springs, High Ridge, Mt. Olive; Union Springs--Sardis, Low's Field, Lime Creek; Brundidge--Post Oak, New Hope, Mt. Pilgrim.\n\nPage 86\n\nLEADING MEN.\n\nRev. A. Martin, Union Springs; Wm. Mullen and M. Flournoy, Troy: W. H. Copeland and E. Mayer, Brundidge.\n\nNEW CAHABA ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1871, has about 2,000 members, and are generous supporters of Missionary and educational enterprises. Their work is managed by such men as Revs. P. S. L. Hutchins, B. N. Tubbs, R. E. Brown, L. Abercrombie, T. Chandler and A. L. Huggins.\n\nThey have churches at or near Marion, Hamburg and Selma. The copy of their minutes which came to the writer's hand is not sufficiently full to make a good record, as is the case with regard to other minutes in hand.\n\nOLD PINE GROVE ASSOCIATION.\n\nWith headquarters at Union Springs, Bullock county, was organized in 1870. No section of Alabama affords better talent than is found within the territory of this Association. The people of Union Springs are noted for their ability and skill in business affairs--merchandise, etc.\n\nThe brick church edifice recently erected by Rev. W. C. Bradford and his church in Union Springs, as well as the large and successfully operated stores, is testimony on this line.\n\nThe officers of this body are: Rev. E. Thornton, Union Springs, moderator; Prof. F. L. Todd, Union. Springs, clerk; Rev. W. C. Crawford, treasurer.\n\nThey have about 2,000 members and the following churches:\n\nAberfoil--Elizabeth.\n\nPage 87\n\nUnion Springs--First Baptist, Mt. Pleasant, St. John, and Mt. Hilliard.\n\nCotton Valley--Elizabeth.\n\nThompson Station--Mt. Pleasant and Second Baptist,\n\nFitzpatrick Station--Greenwood.\n\nMcLemore--Mt. Common.\n\nBug Hall--Bethlehem and Mt. Carmel.\n\nIndian Creek--Mt. Calvary.\n\nGoshen Hill--Mt. Zion.\n\nChina Grove--Mt. Zion.\n\nLinwood--Mt. Pleasant.\n\nFlora--Mt. Sinai.\n\nSuspension--Mt. Canaan.\n\nOrion--Bethlehem.\n\nThey have the following pastors:\n\nUnion Springs--Revs. W. C. Bradford, E. Thornton, L. Lawson, and E. Moore.\n\nAberfoil--Revs. C. H. Thornton and J. C. Jett.\n\nFlora--Rev. R. Allen.\n\nFitzpatrick--Rev. William Thompkins.\n\nCotton Valley--Revs. M. Ellington and W. Crawford.\n\nFor general purposes the Association raises from $50 to $100 a year.\n\nPost Offices Unknown--Revs. T. Hendrix, G.Youngblood, P. Johnson, S. M. Dawson, J. M. Faison, R. Jole, S. Barnes.\n\nRev. J. W. Jett, a man of Virginia birth, is the oldest member of the body; he was associated with those pioneers of this section, Revs. Peter Johnson and William Townsend. Mr. Jett is still strong and active, and is ready for any good work. Rev. E. Thornton leads this body, and it could not be otherwise, as no man among them is a mightier and more conspicuous individuality.\n\nPage 88\n\nPEROTE ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1880, is not so well known as some other bodies. From the minutes of 1888 I glean the following: They have a church at Perote, one at Mt. Andrew, one at Fresco, two at Victoria, one at Midway, and one at Pine Grove. Their membership at this time was small, and the names of some of their chief men appear as follows; Rev. J. H. Burks, W. B. Grubbs, C. G. Wheeler, R. Allen, and R. Dix.\n\nPIKE COUNTY ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1887, rose, it seems, in Pike County.\n\nPASTORS.\n\nRevs. J. S. Adair, T. Diggs, G. Whaley, W. S. Pollard, H. Broxton, M. Stinson, W. F. Williams, J. O. Davis, and others.\n\nCHURCHES.\n\nTroy Post Office--Troy Church.\n\nClayton--Mt. Moriah.\n\nBurk's--Antioch.\n\nBuck Horn--Mt. Olive.\n\nElba--Friendship and Harmony.\n\nLinwood--Benevolent.\n\nThey endorse educational enterprises.\n\nRUSHING SPRINGS ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1870. Revs. Henry Woods, W. H. McAlpine, and Isham Robinson were the chief founders of this body. Talladega county is their main territory, though they have churches in Coosa, St. Clair and Calhoun counties.\n\nRev. E. C. Rivers has been for years their efficient moderator,\n\nPage 89\n\nand Rev. A. A. Battle is clerk. They report their churches and ministers as follows :\n\nJenifer Post Office--Shady Grove and Shiloh.\n\nRenfroe--New Salem, Antioch and Bethel.\n\nTalladega--Pleasant Grove, Mt. Pilgrim, Mt. Cleveland, Rocky Mount, Sycamore, Mt. Canaan, Mt. Moriah, Mt. Zion.\n\nEureka--Pleasant Hill, Rushing Springs.\n\nKilnulga--Mt. Carmel.\n\nGoodwater--Marietta.\n\nKelley's Creek--Mt. Zion.\n\nSylacauga--Harper Springs, New Hope, Rising Star.\n\nSilver Run--Sweet Home.\n\nCropwell--Cropwell.\n\nRegan--Macedonia.\n\nSycamore--Mt. Olive, Pleasant Hill, Salem.\n\nSedan--Blooming Light.\n\nBirney's--African Church.\n\nLincoln--Pine Grove.\n\nMt. Olive--New Shiloh.\n\nAlpine--New Maryland, Kingston.\n\nRendalia--Zion Hill.\n\nOxford--Rocky Mount.\n\nEastaboga--Salem.\n\nAnniston--Mt. Zion.\n\nIronaton--Ironaton.\n\nStewardsville--Union.\n\nMiles--Lebanon.\n\nMINISTERS.\n\nD. Savage, of Mumford; A. Z. Wilson, N. Jemison, B. Jackson, A. Bibb, S. Rivers, P. Jordan, C. C. Curry, R. Garrett, A. J. Vincent, A. O'Neal, A. G. Walker, James Headen, M. H. Cunningham, H. Wood, J. Chapman, A. A. Battle, S. Burt, R.\n\nPage 90\n\nB. McClellen, J. L. Looney, A. Bryant, A. Davis, S. Marbry, J. P. Barton, M. C. B. Oden.\n\nThis body is led chiefly by men who have attended Talladega College, some of whom are not only graduates and scholars, but are strong preachers of the plain old gospel story.\n\nThey number about 6,500 members. Talladega and Anniston are their chief points. Talladega is the \"Old Indian battle ground,\" and here the white Baptists formed a church in 1885. Sister Cain, a member of the Mount Canaan Church, Talladega, said to the writer: \"There was no town here when I came. The Indians lived here and it was all nothing but wild woods.\" As she was talking, the Talladega College bell loudly rang out some orders or notice upon the ears of Negro students. I mused: \"How the world changes! About the years 1820-1830, negro slavery is established in Talladega county. In 1835 a white church rises up and, unknowingly, begins to prepare to give birth to a Negro church, which will give birth to a Negro Association. In 1865 the slave is free, and in 1870 the white church constitutes the Mt. Canaan Church (colored), out of which comes the Rushing Springs Association. And Negro men and Negro women are carrying diplomas from buildings erected by white Baptists for the education of white people. All this in less than fifty years.\"\n\nTHE AFRICAN BAPTIST CHURCH,\n\nIn Talladega county, has a rather peculiar history. The lot was donated in 1849, it appears, by a Mr. William Jenkins, a wealthy slave owner, who lived about eight miles south of the town of Talladega. It is said that in addition to the gift of land and building, he paid a man to teach the catechism to the colored children, and paid annually $150 toward the salary of a minister for the colored people who worshiped with this\n\nPage 91\n\nRev. W. R. Pettiford, D. D., President Penny Savings and Loan Co., President Alabama Publishing. Co., Birmingham, Ala.\n\nPage 92\n\nchurch. Samuel Jenkins, a slave from South Carolina, was one of their first deacons.\n\nPastors.--It appears that the following brethren served the church at different times in the capacity of pastor: Revs. D. Reynolds, S. Boils, D. Peeples, W. H. McAlpine, Phil. Davis, A. Lawler, and Jordan Chapman.\n\nThe origin of this church is full of suggestion. It shows that in spite of the brutalizing influences of the horrible institution of slavery, humanity and Christianity in the master often triumphed in deeds of love and mercy in behalf of the helpless slave. The memory of such men as Mr. Jenkins inscribed upon such times will be fragrant forever. The plantation to which the above named lot belonged has changed hands several times, but this lot is fixed on the records as the property of the African Church.\n\nHonorable mention is made of Rev. Chesley Johnson and Joe Walker. The latter, it is said, was allowed to give Bible lessons on his master's plantation. The manliness which characterizes Mr. Henry Barclay (Mr. Walker's son) and other decendants, marks Mr. Walker's rare talent.\n\nSANDY RIDGE ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1887, is composed of the following churches:\n\nBurnesville Post Office--Lily Zion and Lily Grove.\n\nSelma--St. James, New, Liberty, Cahaba, and Elyton.\n\nFine Hill--Pleasant Grove and Mt. Pilgrim.\n\nStateville--New Mt. Moriah, Autaugaville, New Hope, Pleasant Valley, and St. Paul.\n\nJones' Switch--New Providence.\n\nAugustine--Oak Grove.\n\nRevs. A. Clay, J. and E. Mixom, M. Bishop, H. W. Peeples, and E. W. Deampart are mentioned among their leading men. Their church property is reported at $8,000.\n\nPage 93\n\nSALEM ASSOCIATION.\n\nOrganized in 1871, is a small body in southeast Alabama. I have been unable to obtain data from this body. I learn that they have churches at the following points: Brundidge, Clintonville, Enterprise, and Cox Mills.\n\nSHELBY SPRINGS ASSOCIATION.\n\nWas organized in 1869. Rev, Berry Ware, it seems, was one of its leading founders. They have a membership of about 3,000. They have some excellent men, among whom may be mentioned: Revs. B. M. Mallory, F. Youngblood, H. D. Leathers, of Childersburg; Rev. D. L. Prentice, Aldrich; Rev. J. P. Barton, Talladega; Rev. E. E. Perryman, Helena; Revs. G. R. Nash, F. R. Kenedy, B. F. Singleton, and P. Caddell, Columbiana; Rev. F. Cahill, Harpersville; Revs. J. L. Looney and P. Fancher, Fayetteville; Revs. W. C. Owens and J. H. Moseley, Calera.\n\nThe minutes of 1890 give the following post offices and churches:\n\nChildersburg--Enon.\n\nKymulga--Mt. Olive.\n\nAldrich--Hepzibah.\n\nBlocton--Liberty.\n\nTalladega--Peace Baptist.\n\nWilsonville--Bethlehem, Scott Grove, Mt. Grove, and Dry Branch.\n\nHarpersville--Mt. Olive.\n\nHelena--Mt. Pleasant.\n\nFayetteville--Shady Grove, Friendship.\n\nColumbiana--Zion, Friendship, and Macedonia.\n\nMt. Pinson--Mt. Bradford. Page 94\n\nSiluria--Union Hill, Liberty No. 1.\n\nShelby--Providence.\n\nLong View--Galilee.\n\nCalera--Moseley Chapel, New Mt. Moriah, Bethel.\n\nRev. D. L. Prentice, Aldrich, is doing a very effective work in the school room, and the people of his town bear the marks of his pedagogic labors. Their meetings, I mean associational meetings, are enjoyable and they give evidence of piety, promise and power.\n\nThis body liberally aided in the purchase of Selma University, and has ever been ready for any and every good work.\n\nSOUTHEAST ALABAMA ASSOCIATION.\n\nThis Association operates in the extreme southeast portion of the State. I have not been able to secure a full statistical table from them.\n\nThey report thirty churches, with a membership of about 2,000. From a mutilated copy of their minutes for 1892 the following names are given as the ordained ministers of the body: J. Craddock, G. Christinar, J. Stith, Thomas Slaughter, M. Spencer, E. P. Langston, J. Cotton, E. Alford, T. Rollins, A. L. Koonce, J. C. Green, Wm. Carter, A. Powell, J. Foston, J. Sampson, James Humphrey, G. R. Hall, R. C. Liferedge, and A. Turner.\n\nPart of the statistical table is torn away, but the following appears as the list of their post offices: Cowarts, Otho, Crosby, Balkum, Headland, Gordon, Shorterville, Halesburg, Zornville, Hardwicksburg, Brackins, Choctawhatchie, Columbia, Lawrenceville, Abbevil"
