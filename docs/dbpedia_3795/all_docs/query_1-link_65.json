Richmond, Va. 1937 COPYRIGHT, 1937, BY BROOKE PAYNE 1.' RECOMMENDATION While it is not asserted that the following pages are free from errors other than typographical, it is urged that no changes be made in the given dates without first consulting me as to my authority for them. In several cases these dates were chosen from a group of conflicting ones. Brooke Payne Box 1582 University, Virginia. 1937 PREFACE Any extended exploration through the silent, mouldy catacombs of a forgotten past wherein lie buried the records of our ancestors re¬ veals very luminously our kinship with the world of strangers among whom we now live — the homogeneity of our race. This is the truth that lies at the bottom of the ancestral well. Such a search cannot fail to evoke within us a greater sympathy and humanity; a greater sense of close relationship to those whose offspring we are; a greater feeling of responsibility to those who follow us. The recognition of this responsibility to posterity imposes upon posterity an inalienable interest in and dependence upon us. This idea, applied to the whole human experience, constitutes the justification of the veneration of one’s ancestors which is a national trait in China and Japan, the oldest extant civilizations on Earth. In proportion as we venerate our ancestors do we promote our sense of duty to those with us and to those who follow us. The Command¬ ment “Honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee” now acquires a new meaning. That brilliant cosmopolitan Lafcadio Hearn, a naturalized Japa¬ nese, of Irish-Greek parentage, born in the Ionian Islands, expresses so well the thought which I have in mind. “E^ch one of us is many, yet all of us are still one with each other; we must know all past humanity not only in ourselves, but likewise in the preciousness and beauty of every fellow life. The world of the living is directly gov¬ erned by the world of the dead. The dead are not less real than the living. Unless we deny psychological heredity we cannot honestly deny that our impulses and feelings, and the higher capacities evolved through the feelings, have literally been shaped by the dead ; and even that the general direction of our activities has been determined by the power of the special tendencies bequeathed to us. Scientifically we know that in one tiny cell may be stored up the whole life of a race — the sum of all the past sensation of millions of years. Our best faculties are certainly bequests from the best of our ancestors ; our evil qualities are inherited from natures in which evil, or that which we now call evil, once predominated. Of past humanity as unity — of the millions long buried as real kindred — we either think not at all, or think with the same sort of curiosity that we give to the subject of extinct races”. [vii] Vlll Preface Any desire to differentiate ourselves from and above our neighbors by the development of a distinguished ancestral lineage is born in ignorance or false pride. A critical and thorough search through all the paths that lead back from ourselves as a focus inevitably exposes within a few generations relationships that prove us kin to many to whom we may have thought ourselves genetically superior. On the other hand, such a search made in the spirit of reverence for all those countless buried millions who contributed towards making us what we are will inevitably develop in us a sense of our kinship with all mankind, a sense of wholesome and becoming humility, and a broad tolerance. Again quoting Hearn : “We find interest in the records of great captains, statesmen, discoverers, reformers, because the magnitude of that which they accomplished appeals to our ambitions ; the name¬ less dead to whom we owe most we do not trouble ourselves about — we feel no gratitude, no love to them.” Beginning with one’s self as an origin and tracing one’s finger back¬ ward through all the names of one’s forebears and kindred as set forth in these pages, walking — as it were — meditatively, sympatheti¬ cally, reverently, and fancifully through the old family burying- grounds, reading the unfamiliar names on the old lichen-covered, tottering, grave-stones, noting how long ago they died, reconstruct¬ ing something of their lives, their bright youth, the serious business of their maturity, their sweet or bitter senility, all their passions, hopes, beliefs, fears, the strength or frailty of their character, their physical vigor or weakness, realizing how much of all this they have bequeathed to us; how can we fail to feel gratitude to them? how can we fail to love them ? how can we fail to understand what is meant by the “communion of the saints”, concerning which Dr. Pusey, the noted English divine, wrote — “Unless there were in the word of God an absolute prohibition of prayer for the departed, how should we go on praying for those whom we love until they were out of sight, and then cease on the instant as if ‘out of sight, out of mind’ were a Christian duty?” It is ignorant and absurd for a man to say — “I am not interested in my ancestors”. It would be less absurd to say — “I am not interested in my children”. Study what Daniel Webster meant when he wrote — “Those who do not look upon themselves as a link connecting the past with the future do not perform their duty to the world”. Or ponder over the picturesque metaphor of Oliver Wen¬ dell Holmes — ^“Every man is an omnibus in which his ancestors ride.” Just to what extent we can disentangle ourselves from this coil Preface IX which our forefathers unto the third and fourth generation, even unto the fortieth generation, have cast about us, or escape its implications, is not such a serious metaphysical problem if we admit the freedom of our will acting in conjunction with a heavenly grace. The way out, it seems to me, is to follow a good leader, the classic example. In the annals of this Payne clan are abundant testimonials of lives nobly spent, in service and faith and courage. '‘Whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are pure” in these records we may be justly proud of, and in emulating them find our way out of the labyrinth. Finally, it is a matter of easy observation that isolation, poverty, misfortune, and ill-chosen marriages imposed on a family-group for two or more generations produce a type that does not appear to re¬ semble in the degree of refinement or culture the ancestors from which it sprung. This need not be a matter for discouragement or dismay ; the will to survive, especially if stimulated by a proper pride in one’s good name, will boost these same people back on top again : and so the wheel goes round. Many a battle has been won by a slogan. MALO MORI GUAM FOEDARI.

To attain these objectives, the following means were employed: (a) By searching the Court records; (b) By private correspondence and interviews; (c) By reference to public libraries. In these several enterprises I have met with results varying from complete failure to fairly good success. Taken as a whole, my achieve¬ ments in the direction of the two first objectives have been disappoint¬ ing to me. THE PAYNES OF VIRGINIA 1 n.r' $ ■■■■■ \\ ■*> ‘itA'v'/'' , A IV, ( ; )'>i i 7 1 o ? -I. y. Y /. H A L-I 'I • ii THE PAYNE GROUPS IN V In the Rappahannock country of early colonial dlrs there were five fairly well defined groups of Paynes, among wh(» there does not appear to be any convincing evidence of consanguiiVity ; three on the East side of the River, and two on the West side. Along the James the evidence of integrated groups is so scant as to make it impossible to generalize about them ; but there were probably two distinct families on the North, and at least one on the South. While I do not presume to say that these eight or more groups were in no degree genealogically related, it can be said with confidence that the Court records do not reveal any unmistakable and convincing proof of relationship, such as is manifested by the exchange of deeds, by mutual service as witnesses, attorneys, parties to suits, by common mention in the will or deed of some parent or relative, or in the vari¬ ous other ways in which kinship is ordinarily revealed n a documen-_ tary way. The five groups in the Rappahannock country wer/e — ( 1 ) A Northumberland group, headed by Williaifn Payne who d. 1 726, leaving a will naming w. Anne, son Samu^ dau. Grace, and grand-son Elisha Payne. He had a son John vAxo m. Grace Millian, and who died before his father. Samuel does jvot appear to have mar¬ ried. Elisha was b. 1724 and d. 1755. lTi(<Delieved that Elisha had . John who m. 1742 widow of John Hill. Elisha had a sister who m. David Hammontree. Grace Millian was b. 1706, dau. of John Millian and w. Anne Waddington, dau. of Ralph Wadding- ton. She m. John Payne 1723. (2) A Westmoreland group, headed by John Payne whose will was written 1668 and named wife Milicent, and children John, James, and Elizabeth. It is believed that he had also a son William. John left a will dated 1697 ( 1697/8) naming w. Elizabeth, and sons John and William. She was Elizabeth Murphy, dau. of Cornelius. She m( 1 1 ) John Atwell, who d. 1713, and who had m(i) Winifred Youell. James d. 1702 leaving w. Anne. William, Sr., m. Elizabeth Harniss (or Harris, or perhaps Harnish). The above-named John, the third, m. Elizabeth, widow of William Lewis, and d. @ 1729. His brother William, the second, m. Elizabeth, and in 1725 had moved to Han¬ over Co. Another William Payne of this group had m. Rebecca Rice by 1722 ; and Mary Payne had m. William Rice by 1739. [3] 4 HE Paynes of Virginia (3) ^ headed by John Payne, born about 1615, and expandec^^^® body of this book. (4) An E'^^^oup, headed by Robert Payne, whose will is dated .24 Mch 1671 ^^PNov 1675) and names wife Elizabeth and son Robert. The sc^jRobert married Catherine Thompson about 1688, and left a will Mated 24 May 1695 Nov 1701) naming wife Catherine, sonsjLawson and Robert, and daughter Elizabeth. No trace of Lawsori Payne has been found subsequent to this will. The younger Robert rr.arried Monica Shippey, and left a will dated 29 Dec 1724 (21 Sept 1725) naming wife Monica, son Lawson, and daugh¬ ter Elizabeth. The younger Lawson likewise seems to have disap¬ peared from the records. The last-named Elizabeth married Thomas Waring about 1738; he was born 1719 and died 1761 ; they had a son Robert Payne Waring. ( 5 ) A Rappahannock group, headed by Thomas Payne and Ralph Payne. Apparently these men were brothers ; the former being con¬ sistently referred to as Mr. Thomas Payne, to whom a patent of land on the S.S.RR. about opposite Leedstown was granted in 1650 for ImpoHihg li^ersons. Two years later grants of land were made to both Thomas aijid Ralph for importing additional immigrants, among whom was Pens^'lope, the wife of Thomas. These men were neighbors of Robert Payne, and of Lieut. Colonel Tobias Smith, who — it ap¬ pears — married Rl^ebe Fauntleroy. In 1659 Thomas and Ralph assisted in the apprai^ment of Rockingham”, the estate of Colonel Smith. In 1663 Thoma^^ayne and John Chaney were granted 2100 acres on N.S.R.R. for importmg^ 41 persons; and, on the 3100 acres on S.S.R.R. By that year Thomas P4_yiie had married Elizabeth. He died 1664, his widow promptly marrying Roger Over- ton, who a few years later returned to England and resided at Shad- well, Stepney Parish, London. The records bear testimony to the fact that Thomas Payne had two children — Nicholas Payne of Lon¬ don, who married Mabel Hackney 1687 (See M.P.R.) ; and Pene¬ lope, who married ( i ) Thomas Warwick, and ( 1 1 ) William Chaney, both of Mi. Co. Nicholas, who lived in the upper part of Middlesex, left a will dated 1693 (1694). He had three daughters, Elizabeth (b. 1688), Ann (B. 1692), and Mary. Penelope, who — according to a record in Lc. Co. — was born by 1656, left a will in Mi. Co. dated 1719/20 ( 1 720) . Ralph Payne had a son Thomas who inherited 300 acres from his father. The said Thomas was of Mi. Co., and lived in that part of it which became Essex. He m(i) Mary Montague 1682, and (ii) Elizabeth Elliott by 1694/5. His first wife was The Payne Groups in Virginia buried 17 Feb 1686/7. (See M.P.R.) He had at least three children — Thomas, Francis, and John Elliott Payne. The last-named Thomas m(i) Catherine Lydford 1715, and (ii) Jane Bush. His will, re¬ corded in Es. Co. and dated 1758 ( 1761 ), names five sons and four daughters. His descendants migrated to certain Virginia counties along the North Carolina border. Considerations, mainly relating to space, make it necessary to con¬ fine this volume to the development of group (3) only, and for that reason the body of this book is dedicated exclusively to members of my own branch of the family. The proximity in which the three above-named Northern Neck groups were forced to live by reason of the restricted area of the peninsula and the dense forests in the interior cannot be taken as evidence of kinship; England was full of unrelated Paynes at this time, and many of them migrated to Virginia. After an exhaustive study of these five groups I arrive at the convicition, as said before, that groups ( i ) and ( 2 ) were not related to each other, nor to any of the other groups; but as to the three remaining groups, while fail¬ ing to find any such proof of family connection as would satisfy a court of chancery, it is my impression that the heads of these groups were consciously related to one another. To exploit all the reasons why I favor these conclusions would consume more space than would be justified by the results, and would still be considerably short of legal proof. Eurthermore, since these conclusions are only my own impressions, they cannot possibly satisfy the needs of the family his¬ torian for any of the four groups not expanded in this book; he must make his own investigation. Briefly stated, the outstanding reasons for associating groups (3), (4), and (5) are that John Payne of the third group witnessed the will of Richard Lawson, whose niece mar¬ ried Robert Payne of the fourth group ; that Ralph Payne of the fifth group owned land adjacent to John Payne of the third group, and that they sold this land to the same party ; and that all three groups associated in one way or another with the same set of people. This last argument is of no great value by itself. It is hoped that the writer will be able to expand these remaining four groups in some future volume. Passing to the consideration of the James River groups, there is only 'One of them concerning which enough is known to form the basis for an argument ; and that is the one headed by George Payne of Goochland, whose will is dated 1744 (1745/6). This group is the largest of all, consisting of 837 members so far isolated. The size 6 The Paynes of Virginia and importance of this latter family necessitates a separate volume. It must be said here, however, that there has been discovered no con¬ nection whatever, of a genealogical nature, allying it with any of the other six or seven groups. It has been suggested in V.M. 6/313 that George Payne was the brother of Richard Payne whose will is recorded in Lancaster, dated 1709 (1709) and naming brother George; but the error of this assumption is easily demonstrated. George Payne of Lc. Co. was the youngest of four sons of William Payne of Lc. (A-III-i), whose will specifies that in 1696 the eldest of these four sons is under sixteen; this oldest son was bom 1685, and hence the youngest was born not earlier than 1689. Since George Payne of Goochland was married by 1704, he could have been at most only fifteen in 1704 if it be assumed that he was the George of Lancaster. Furthermore, the marriage of the latter to Frances Ed¬ monds in 1729 is well established by the records of Lancaster. V.M. 6/313 also points to the significance of the frequent intermarriage of the Goochland family with families in Lancaster. Attention is called to the fact that this intermarriage did not begin until 1757, and arose, beyond doubt, from contacts made at Williamsburg, where the contracting families met during the sessions of the House of Burgesses, among whom these families had representatives. I am aware that Bishop Payne in his letter to Bishop Meade announces a relationship to this Goochland family, of which “Dolly Madison” is the outstanding member ; but no private correspondence between the families confirms this relationship, and it should be remembered that the tendency to “claim kin” under certain favorable circumstances while staunchly denying it under circumstances that are considered objectionable is very human, and that often “the wish was father to that thought”. GENESIS OF THE VIRGINIA FAMILIES Particularly and very naturally are we interested in the story of the origin of our family in this country. There is not only a charm¬ ing picturesqueness and romance attaching to the pioneer life of our ancestors along the James and Rappahannock Rivers, but we desire to get at the truth about them, to know them intimately — stripped of such misrepresentations as grow up about them through the inventive genius of family bards. Let us, therefore, have at once a “round¬ table” on the miscellaneous accounts of the origin of the Paynes in Virginia, which are to be found in accessible print. It is necessary to deal with these various accounts in order not only to dispose perma¬ nently of a mass of contradictory and anomalous statements, but also to submit to the selective judgment of my readers what thereafter remains of this testimony. As. far as I know, this syllabus represents the full extent of the entertaining variety of these miscellaneous accounts. Version i. The Louisville Courier Journal, 25 June 1883, J.J.W. Payne (A-VIII-35). Three Payne brothers came to Jamestown in 1620. Sir Robert returned to England; William went up the James River; the oldest brother John settled in the Northern Neck. “Their names are given as immigrants of that date by Smith in his early history of Virginia.” Version 2. “Old Churches and Families of Virginia”, Bishop Meade. There were three Payne brothers. Sir William never came to America ; Richard or Thomas settled near Lynchburg ; John settled in the Northern Neck. (This is a brief of what Bishop Payne wrote to Bishop Meade as the substance of the former’s recollection of what his great-uncle William told him in 1833.) See John Payne (A- VIII-5). Version 3. “Some Old Colonial Families of Virginia”, Mrs. Cyn¬ thia Martin Polk. The tradition has always been that William Payne was the brother of Sir Robert. William had two sons, John and William. In this book it is also stated that the first immigrants were Sir Robert, John, and William Payne, who came to Virginia in 1620. William settled near Lynchburg. Version 4. “Virginia Genealogies”, Hayden. Sir Robert, John, and William were brothers. William settled near Lynchburg; John, in the Northern Neck. / [7] 8 The Paynes of Virginia Version 5. William and Mary Quarterly, Vol.IIjp.Sy. Sir Robert Payne and his brothers William and John came to Virginia in 1620. Robert returned to England; William settled at Lynchburg; and John, at Leedstown. Version 6. “Lodge of Washington”, Brockett. John, William, and Sir Robert Payne came to Virginia from Yorkshire, England, in 1619. One settled in what is now Lancaster ; another, near James¬ town ; the third, near Alexandria. Version 7. Richmond Times Dispatch, 9 Feb 1908. Three Payne brothers lived in Bedfordshire, England, in 1737. Sir William of Tompsford, the eldest, was knighted that year by George II. The other brothers, George and Robert, came to America; Robert, the youngest, to Fauquier ; George, to Goochland. Version 8. “American Ancestry”, Munsell. There were three Payne brothers, John, William and Sir Robert. John and William came to Virginia in 1620. John settled in the Northern Neck. Version 9. “Eminent and Representative Men of Virginia”, A. R. Spofford. Capt. William Payne (A-VI-4) was fourth in descent from John Payne, the immigrant, who with his brother William came to Virginia in 1620. A third brother Robert, member of the London Company, remained in England. Version 10. A private account signed by Daniel Payne (A-VII- 13), purporting to be based on what his father related to him. This account is dated 4 July 1856. Daniel’s father was born 1755. Three brothers, John, William, and Sir Robert Payne came to Virginia on 18 Apl 1619 from Yorkshire, England. One settled in what is now Lancaster; another, near Jamestown; the third, near Alexandria. Version ii, “The Payne Family”, Payne and Viley, privately published. Three brothers. Sir Robert, John, and William Payne came to Virginia in 1620; Sir Robert returned to England; John settled in the Northern Neck. (The booklet here quotes Capt. John Smith’s History of Virginia). It is also stated in this booklet that John and William were knighted before leaving England. The Paynes were a powerful tribe in Wales. King James I, to conciliate them, gave them a grant of twelve miles square (144 square miles, 92160 a., one- third the area of Fairfax County) near Alexandria, called Payne Manor, where Sir John settled. Sir William settled in Maryland, near Leonardtown, and never married. Version 12. The Baltimore Sun, 4 Oct 1908. Three brothers. Sir Robert, William, and John Payne came to Virginia in the Civil Wars. (Note; the Civil Wars, or the Great Rebellion, began in 1642 with Genesis of the Virginia Families 9 the Battle of Edgehill.) They were in Virginia in 1620. William settled near Lynchburg in 1630; John, near Leedstown. Sir Robert, presumably, returned to England. Version 13. Richmond News Leader, 19 Jany 1932. The family was first represented in America by William Payne, who arrived in Virginia in 1619. He was a Burgess, and commanded troops during the Revolution. (Note: the Revolution began 157 years later.) Version 14. Register of Ky. State. Hist. Society, May 1904. John and William, sons of Sir Robert Payne, came to America in 1694. James I especially mentioned them in his Virginia Charter. (Note: James I had been dead 69 years in 1694.) Version 15. Richmond Times Dispatch, 18 Aug 1907. The first Payne names found in Virginia were Sir Robert, William, and John. Whether William and John were sons of Sir Robert is open to con¬ jecture. William located near Lynchburg in 1630. John settled at the same time at Leedstown. Version 16. “Paine Genealogy”, Dr. H. D. Paine. Early in the 1 8th century William Payne, the ancestor of the Fairfax Co., Va., line, came to Virginia from England. Version 17. From letters and memoranda written by Wm. Win¬ ter Payne (A-IX-32). Three brothers, John, William, and Sir Robert Payne, came to Virginia in 1620 in Governor George Yeard- ley’s second supply. John settled in the Northern Neck; William, at Lynchburg; Sir Robert returned to England. Sir Robert purchased his baronetcy in 1615 from James I; it became extinct in 1804; the title was “Baronet of Evering”. In addition to the above-mentioned versions, there are a few others that might be quoted that are mere combinations or variations of the foregoing without being essentially different. The quickest method of disposing of these miscellaneous accounts is to eliminate the pal¬ pable errors, and then to examine the residue. Consider first Capt. John Smith’s “General Historie of Virginia”, published by him in final form in 1624. This work is available at any large library. Nowhere in this book is it specifically stated that any one by the name of Payne came at any time into Virginia. The arrival of Sir George Yeardley on 18 Apl 1619 is mentioned, as well as that of a number of ships and supplies during the same year, but the names of the passengers on these ships are nowhere listed in this book. A careful survey of this work of 984 pages discloses the name Payne (or any of its variant forms) in only two places. The first is in a list of “The Names of the Adventurers for Virginia, Alphabetically 10 The Paynes of Virginia set downe, according to a printed Booke, set out by the Treasurer and Councell in this present yeere, 1620.” A misconstruction of this rec¬ ord has led to numerous fanciful presentments of the so-called tradi¬ tion of our origin in this country. At the date of this record, the Treasurer and Council of the Virginia Company resided in London. The above list was made in their office. It is nothing more than a statement, alphabetically arranged, of all the stock-holders of the Company, and includes the Earl of Bedford, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Earl of Dorset, the Earl of Exeter, Lady Elizabeth Gray, the Earl of Huntington, the Earl of Leicester, Lord Bishop of Lincoln, Lord North, the Company of Barbers-Surgeons, the Company of Bakers, the City of Chichester, the Executors of Randall Carter, the Town of Dover, the Company of Ironmongers, the Bailiffs of Ipswich, and numerous other noble¬ men of high degree, guilds, towns, companies, etc., numbering over 900, none of whom — with a few exceptions — had ever seen Virginia, or probably had any intention of doing so. In this list are the names of Sir Robert Payne, William Payne, and John Payne. There is as much justification in the inference from this record of stock-holders that the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bailiffs of Ipswich had settled down on the James River as to conclude therefrom, without further evidence, that Sir Robert Payne and the other two Paynes of unknown connection had come over to make a home in the wilderness. The second place in which our name is found in Smith’s History is in a similar list of share-holders in the Somers Islands (the Bermu¬ das). Here Master William Paine is shown to have owned 6 shares in this off-shoot of the Virginia Company. The misconception referred to has arisen from placing a wrong definition on the word ''adventurers” here used. These lists were de¬ cidedly not a record of those who had set out for Virginia, either on a sight-seeing expedition or to make a permanent home there ; they were such lists as might repose to-day in an office in New York show¬ ing the numerous stock-owners in a Mexican Copper Company. If, three hundred years from now, such an imaginary list were to be found among the ruins of some old sky-scraper in New York, bearing my reader’s name therein, your descendants would not be justified in jumping to the conclusion that you had once lived in Mexico. I think we may say with safety and propriety, therefore, that Sir Robert, William, and John Payne are not named as immigrants to Virginia, in Smith’s History, but that they are merely named as Stock-holders in the Virginia Company. Whether any or all of them ever came to Virginia, it has been impossible to affirm with authority. Genesis of the Virginia Families 11 Consider next the identity of Sir Robert Payne listed in Smith’s History of Virginia as a stock-holder in 1620. From correspondence by the writer with Major Algar Howard, Esq., M.C., Norroy King of Arms and Registrar of the College of Arms in London, the fol¬ lowing information on this point was supplied at the cost of ten guineas. The payment of this fee is mentioned in order to convey to the reader the idea that the writer was a client of the Registrar and not merely a pestiferous searcher asking something for nothing. Before payment was made, nine questions were submitted to Major Howard with request that he submit an estimate of what it would cost to answer them positively. These questions were based on the genealogical chart of Robert Payne of St. Neots, Huntingdonshire, compiled from the records of Herald’s visitations on file in the Col¬ lege of Arms. This chart had previously been prepared by the Regis¬ trar at considerable cost to one of our cousins in Salt Lake City, who sent it to the writer. It shows that the said Robert had a great-grand¬ son Robert Payne, soldier of Medloe, Hunts., who married Elizabeth daughter of George Rotherham of Somerys, Bedfordshire, and had seven children — Robert (aged nine in 1613), Gervase, George, Mary, Jane, Anne and Elizabeth. This Robert, the soldier of Medloe, was knighted 22 May 1605. The chart does not show that he had any brothers. There are twenty-eight Paynes on the chart, but none by the name of John. The arms accompanying this chart, and assigned to Sir Robert Payne in 1605, are blazoned : azure a bend roguly between six estoiles or ; crest, on a wreath of the colours in grass vert an otter passant or, in the mouth a fish argent. The summary of the Regis¬ trar’s answers to the nine questions is as follows: the above-men¬ tioned Sir Robert Payne, being the only knight of the name in Eng¬ land in 1605, was identical with the Sir Robert Payne, member of the London Company for colonizing Virginia in 1609 and 1612 ; he was also identical with the Sir Robert Payne who was Member of Parlia¬ ment for Huntingdonshire 1614 and thereafter; there is no evidence on the official record which he made in 1605 that he had any brothers ; lie was not created baronet; his immediate ancestors did not bear arms ; there are no genealogical grounds for associating him with Sir Charles Payne of St. Christopher’s, created Baronet 1737 with the arms in common use to-day by the Paynes of Virginia; there was another Sir Robert Payne of Barton Stacy, Hamps., knighted in 1632. Erom Culleton’s Heraldic Office in London comes the infor¬ mation that this Sir Robert Payne of Medloe, knighted 1605, was a London merchant. From the foregoing observations, it may be reasonably concluded 12 The Paynes of Virginia that our ancestor was not a brother or nephew of Sir Robert Payne, member of the Virginia Company, “adventurer for Virginia in 1620”, and that if our ancestor had been such a brother or nephew, then the family arms, if any, would be “azure a bend roguly”, and not the familiar “lions passant argent” in common use by the Paynes of Virginia. Consider thirdly the title “Evering”. The records of the Herald’s office indicate that there never existed such a Baronetcy. The title of Lord Lavington was conferred on Ralph Payne (1739-1807), the only surviving son of Ralph Payne of St. Kitt’s, West Indies, and became extinct upon his death. His arms, given in Burke’s “General Armory”, were the well known “gules a fess between two lions passant argent”, the device which our family has pretty generally adopted. I am of the opinion that one will look in vain among the Court records and old grave-stones of Virginia for heraldic proof of our right to bear these arms. Crozier’s “General Armory” assigns to William Payne of Lynchburg, circa 1630, and to John Payne of Leedstown, circa 1630, the traditional “lions passant”, and specifies that “the descriptions of the arms and the data, carefully collated and verified, have been inserted only when actual examination of the nec¬ essary records has shown the family to be entitled to the distinction”. It can only be concluded that Mr. Crozier had access to records which no longer exist. Nevertheless, the persistency with which these arms are used by all the Paynes of Virginia, and by all their descendants however scattered, and the tenacity with which they defend (without demonstrating) their title to display them, undoubtedly creates a pre¬ sumption in their favor, resembling the old English right of “imme¬ morial prescription”. Members of the family have exhibited seals and door-knockers, said to have been handed down to them from Paynes of the Revolutionary period, and bearing the familiar arms in ques¬ tion. All of this combined is not, however, legal proof of armigerous title; and it is hoped that some future benefactor may endow the enterprise of establishing such a title. \" It cannot fail to be of interest to my readers to glance at the geneal¬ ogy of the Payne family of which Lord Lavington was a member. Bethane’s “English Baronetage” states that the family probably came from Normandy; that Abraham Payne of Devon was educated for a churchman but engaged himself in the service of Charles I in the Civil Wars of England; that upon the execution of King Charles in 1649, Abraham fled to the West Indies where he married and had (i) Abraham, grandfather of Lord Lavington in Ireland; (2) Sir Genesis of the Virginia Families 13 Charles; (3) Nathaniel; and two daughters. From this and other sources we find that the son Abraham married Anne Willett and had Ralph, who married Alice Carlisle and had Ralph, Lord Lavington (1739-1807). The second son, Charles of St. Christopher’s (St. Kitt’s), married Jeannette, daughter of John McArthur of Aberdeen, an officer in the army of the 9th Earl of Argyle (Archibald Camp¬ bell). After the execution of the Earl in 1686, Charles Payne re¬ treated to St. Kitt’s, where he obtained a patent from King William, and became Major General of the Leeward Islands. In 1737 he was created Baronet. He died in 1744, leaving eleven children, one of whom was his eldest son and successor Sir Gillies Payne of Temps- ford Hall, Bedfordshire. He was born 1720; married Maria Keeling 1761 ; died 1801. He had eight children, of whom the second son Sir Peter Payne of Blunham House, Beds., (1763-1843) married Eliza¬ beth Sarah Steward of Stourton Castle, Staffordshire. One of Sir ■ Peter’s sisters was Susan, who married Hugh Perry Keane of Lon¬ don and had Hugh Payne Keane, who married Jeanne Naret and had Virginia Keane, who married Dr. Clarence A. Bryce and had Jean¬ nette Bryce of Richmond, Va., to whom the writer is indebted for valuable information and the pleasure of inspecting the portraits of Sir Gillies Payne and his grand-children. To the late Charles Robert Salusbury Payne of Blunham House, Sandy, Bedfordshire, Lieu¬ tenant Royal Navy, retired, the writer owes the information that his ancestor Sir Charles Payne was the grandson of Stephen Payne, who during the Civil Wars took up arms for King Charles I, and was present at the battle of Worcester 1651 with his son Abraham Payne. Mr. Payne also stated that his own arms, crest and motto are the same as those adopted by the Paynes of Virginia. From Burke’s “General Armory” we learn that Stephen Payne, being an ardent royalist, mi¬ grated from Jersey to Devon at the period of the Great Rebellion and founded families still existing in England. The arms of this ancient family is given as argent, three trefoils sable. It is not pretended that the foregoing observations on the English families of Paynes represents more than a partial and imperfect in¬ vestigation within the narrow limits imposed upon the writer by cir¬ cumstances of time and means, but it serves to dispel some of the fictions that have grown up about our ancestry, even though it falls far short of solving the problem of our genesis in England. It can only be said that, assuming that our family has laid hold on the familiar coat-of-arms by a correct tradition, we will have to abandon the story of our kinship with Sir Robert Payne of the London Com- 14 The Paynes of Virginia pany and search for our ancestor among the Paynes of Jersey and Devonshire origin. There is a natural but thoughtless tendency to see our ancestor in every John, William, or Robert Payne that bobs up in the records of the early 17th century, either in Virginia or England, forgetting that the name is and was very common in England, even at that period. In '‘The Paynes of Hamilton”, by Augusta Francelia Payne White, we read : \"During the Norman dynasty, Payne was one of the most usual names in England, and on this account is now very widely found in all counties. Of the thirty-four coats-of-arms ascribed to the name in Burke’s Armory, almost all are entirely unlike. * * * Examination of the records of visitation reveals a multitudinous collection of Paynes in England. The size of the Payne family, of which over 450 wills were examined, shows how impossible it is to find the ancestry of any early immigrant of that name in this country.” In this connection, your attention is invited to Hayden’s “Virginia Genealogies”, wherein it is stated that in the Downman family a coat-of-arms is preserved, viz. — “vert on a bend engrailed three roses or; crest, a peacock, for Pa^e.” This blazonry, though technically incorrect in wording, is essentially that of the arms of Payne of Wallingford, Berkshire, confirmed 1 586. The arms here referred to by Hayden were found in conjunction with those of the Wilmot family, and were presumably vouched for by our cousin Captain William Payne of London (D-V-2), whose daughter married Joseph Ball Downman. Inasmuch as Captain William Payne resided for many years and died in England, it seems fair to conclude that he would not have preserved these arms without checking his title to them. With that thought in mind, I had Mr. Reginald M. Glencross of London examine all the early 17th century Payne wills of Berk¬ shire with the hope of discovering some Virginia connection. Among the seventy-four Christian names mentioned in these wills, copies of which were mailed to me, there are several Johns, Williams, Richards, and Georges, any one of which might have been our ancestor, so far as mere chronology is concerned; but nothing was found in these wills that could possibly be taken as proof of our ancestry. It is with disappointment and regret that I am forced to leave this problem unsolved ; but I feel that enough has been presented here to inspire some other enthusiast to carry on the work to a successful conclusion. Let us consider next the tradition of a settlement by William Payne near Lynchburg, and by John Payne in the Northern Neck, in 1630. Genesis of the Virginia Families 15 I take the liberty of quoting from a letter to me in 1922 written by the late Mr. William G. Stanard, whose eminence as an authority on such subjects gives to his statements the quality of finality. “Of course,” says he, “the statement about a settlement on the upper James River in 1630 is absurd. At that time the settlers, driven away by the massacre in 1622, had not gotten as far back as the present site of Richmond”, one hundred and twenty-five miles East of Lynchburg, founded in 1786. Bulletin No. 9 of the Virginia State Library, writ¬ ten by Mr. Morgan P. Robinson, State Archivist, shows that the head of settlements on the James in 1632 was in the vicinity of Henrico, while there were no settlements in the Rappahannock by that date. By 1652 the settlements on the Potomac and Rappahannock extended only as far North as Mattox Creek, now in Westmoreland. As to the grant of 144 square miles near Alexandria by James I to Sir John Payne, it is evident that the statement must fall before the same argument. Furthermore, in 1620 grants were not being made by the Crown but by the London Company, to whom a charter was granted in 1609 “to deduce a colony and to make habitation and plantation in Virginia”, which included, even after it was clearly de¬ fined, what is now W. V\"a., part of Pa., Ky., Ohio, Ind., Mich., Ill., Wis., and part of Minn. Grants of land were based on the number of shares of stock owned by subscribers. John Payne owned one, or 100 acres. In 1624/5 the Company was dissolved and the colony reverted to the Crown. In conclusion of this discussion of the various published accounts of our origin in Virginia, it is necessary to refer briefly to the earliest appearance of our name in the annals of the colony. From Brock’s “Miscellaneous Papers” and Brown’s “Genesis” we learn that Sir Robert Payne and William Payne, Esq., were incorporators of the charter of 1609; the former subscribed £ 25; the latter £ 37— los. William Payne, according to Brown, was probably the William Payne, Esq., of Highgate who died 1628. John Payne, Gent, be¬ came “interested in the American enterprise” at a later date. In 1619 Dr. Theodore Gulston, a celebrated London physician, bought ten shares in the London Virginia Company, one of which was from John Payne, who had paid £ 12— los for the same, and who was doubtless in London at the time. From the list of living and dead in Virginia made 16 Feb 1623, in which 1277 living are named, the only Payne named is John, who was living “in ye neck of land”, identified as the peninsula opposite Henrico and known as Farrar’s Island, or else the mainland just North of Jamestown. The list of 16 The Paynes of Virginia “dead since last April”, prepared on the same date as above, shows no Paynes (or Paines) ; this list numbered 366. This last list did not include those massacred by the Indians on 22 Mch 1622, totalling 347, among whom was Thomas Paine killed at Westover, about one mile from Berkeley Hundred, at the home of Mr. Richard Owen. Hening’s Statutes show William Paine as one of the Burgesses as¬ sembled on 5 Mch 1623/4; the settlements represented by these men are not recorded. Whether the latter John Payne and William Payne were identical with the stock-holders; whether they were related to each other ; or whether either was our ancestor are questions that, so far as I know, remain unanswered. It is quite certain, however, that the John Payne, born about 1615, the subject of the first paragraph in the body of this book, could not have been the John Payne, Gent., listed as a stock-holder in the Virginia Company in 1619, nor the John Payne living “in ye neck of land” in 1623. The following Payne emigrants to Virginia are taken from the list compiled by J. C. Hotten. 1635 Thomas Payne (23) and Elizabeth Payne (21). In addition, there are about twenty other Paynes listed as bound for New England, St. Christopher’s, and Barbados up to 1637. Some of them may have been diverted by storm or hostile ships. In Greer’s “Early Virginia Immigrants” we find a list of about twenty Paynes quoted as head-rights in the patents of land granted for their trans¬ portation to Virginia, the earliest being Richard Payne in 1635. Then follow in order George, Florentine, John, William, Thomas, Edward, Margaret, Henry, wSarah, Robert, Samuel, Mary, and Eliza¬ beth; and finally in 1656 Margaret Payne and John Payne, Jr., im¬ ported by Mr. John Payne, our ancestor. It does not necessarily fol¬ low that the immigrant settled in that county in which land was granted to the patentee, nor that he landed in Virginia on the date of the patent. With a few exceptions, the identification of these immi¬ grants is practically impossible. What now remains of the multitudinous versions of our origin in Virginia, following my friendly criticism of them, does not, I admit, furnish much with which to construct a bridge across the Atlantic. Nevertheless, I earnestly desire and believe that I may have thereby cleared away much rubbish and left bare something solid on which to build. And lest it be charged by my kinsmen that, in the preparation of this solid foundation, all material for going ahead with the building has been swept away, may I offer this suggested frame-work for a new construction?: accepting the reasonable hypothesis that John Genesis of the Virginia Families 17 Payne of Lancaster was related to Thomas and Ralph of Rappa¬ hannock, and that they fled to Virginia after Worcester (1651) and that Ralph returned to England after the restoration (1660), pro¬ ceed to search in the annals of the Paynes of Jersey and Devon for the origin of our branch of the family, and for our title to the arms which we have assumed. In this undertaking it will be necessary to abandon, as an axiom, the time-honored tradition that our immigrant ancestor arrived in Virginia with Governor Yeardley. Contrary to expectation, the more I delved into this matter of our title to the arms in common use in our family, the more uncertainty arose ; but since some pronouncement on the subject may be desired of me by those who have so valuably assisted and upheld me in this under¬ taking, I will say, in conclusion, that it is my belief that we use the correct arms but give the wrong explanation of their derivation. ORIGIN OF THE NAME PAYNE In discussing this matter I do not pretend to have made any re¬ search therein for periods prior to those of colonial Virginia. My authority for what follows, so far as it relates to these earlier times, are : Illustrated Baronetage (Debrett). Paine Family Records (Dr. T. O. Paine). The Paynes of Hamilton (Augusta F. P. White). Patronymica Brittanica. These writers seem to agree that the name originated from the Latin word ‘‘paganus’^ meaning either a pagan, or a countryman, or both. The French equivalent is ‘‘paien’\\ The Paynes of England are said to be of Norman origin, and are believed to be descended from men who, at the time that Rollo be¬ came a Christian (912 A.D.), refused to be baptized, and hence were distinguished by the name ‘^paganus”, or ‘'le payen”. The name was thus applied as a soubriquet and does not connote consanguinity. There were men in England prior to the Norman conquest (1066) who bore this surname. During the Norman dynasty in England, Paganus or Payne was one of the most usual names in that country, and is now very widely found in all its counties. It is highly prob¬ able that the families in England bearing the name, or one of its numerous variants, are not from one parent stock, but that they are descended from unrelated progenitors, each of whom was called Paganus, either because he was a countryman or else because he was not a Christian. The tendency to synonymy between the descriptions ‘‘countryman^’ and “pagan” is evident from the reflection that Christianity spread most easily in the cities or other densely in¬ habited regions of Western Europe. The works quoted above furnish very interesting reading for those who are not satisfied with this statement of the matter. The old Court records of Virginia give the name indifferently as Payne, Paine, Payn, etc., with the form Payne attaching to all groups of the family in the Northern Neck around and since the Revolution. Indeed, it is safe to say that in the few cases in Virginia where in the present day the name is spelled Paine the holders have immigrated to Virginia in comparatively modern times. While it may be admitted that families who to-day spell this name differently [18] Origin of the Name Payne 19 are genealogically distinct, it would be wrong to make any such claim concerning the early colonial families of this category, since one need not go far in the records, for instance, of old Rappahan¬ nock County to find Mr. John Payne’s name spelled two different ways in the same document. One can even see a man signing his name Payne, while his father’s will was signed Paine. If my im¬ pressions on this point may be accepted as reliable, I would say that the amanuenses of the early colonial days preferred Paine to Payne; and I am certain that you can find a deed signed Paine which the Clerk of the Court has indexed Payne. THE NORTHERN NECK INCLUDING THE FORMATION OF ITS COUNTIES AND PARISHES If this family history is to be anything more than a telephone directory, wherein the reader simply looks up his ancestor and gets his number, he should have at least an idea as to how the Northern Neck, its counties and parishes, were formed. Excellent books and articles covering these points have been written, and are referred to in this Introduction under the heading ‘^Authorities”. Their perusal is highly recommended. But perhaps the average reader has neither the time, inclination, nor facilities for such reading; hence a rather elementary synopsis of the matter is here presented for his accommo¬ dation, with the hope that he will not judge it, in advance, as hav¬ ing little bearing on the purposes of this book. Indeed, some knowl¬ edge of this matter is indispensable to a full understanding of many of the statements in the body of this volume. On the other hand, I am aware that many of my readers know already vastly more on this subject than I do. The James, the York, the Rappahannock, and the Potomac Rivers, cutting in a Northwesterly direction into the Eastern bound¬ ary of Virginia, form three necks of land, the uppermost of which is known as the Northern Neck. In colonial days tenure of land in the Northern Neck differed from that in other parts of the colony in that the former was held under a royal patent to the Proprietor, Lord Culpeper, under regulations pre¬ scribed by him ; whereas the latter was a freehold in which the tenant held under the King, under regulations prescribed by the colonial government. Grants subject to inheritance and alienation were made in the Northern Neck upon the down-payment of a certain considera¬ tion, and thereafter an annual rent payable to the Proprietor on Michaelmas. In addition, certain large tracts called manors were laid out and subdivided into lots, which were leased for the life- period of the tenant and two of his dependents on the annual pay¬ ment at Christmas of a stipulated fee. The largest of these manors was the Manor of Leeds, which lay North of Carter’s Run in Fauquier and contained also parts of Loudoun and Frederick (now Warren). The War of the Revolution abrogated all these feudal tenures throughout the State and substituted absolute ownership. [20] The Northern Neck 21 Through the marriage of Catherine, daughter and sole heir of Lord Culpeper of Leeds Castle, to Thomas 5th Baron Fairfax of Cameron, their oldest son Thomas, 6th Lord Fairfax, eventually be¬ came Proprietor of the Northern Neck and came to Virginia and lived at “Greenway Court”, near Winchester, where he died 1781. His remains lie under the Episcopal Church at Winchester, in the vestibule of which there is a marble tablet bearing his arms and motto “Je le feray durant ma vie”. The ancient name of Virginia appears to have been Wingandacoa. To our early settlers the Rappahannock was at first thought of as a remote, unsettled, and unknown Indian country called Chickacoan. In 1648 it became Northumberland county. Settlements had begun, and at the same time Charles II paid one of his political debts by granting this vast territory to the first Proprietors of the Northern Neck. In 1651 Lancaster was formed, straddling the Rappahan¬ nock. Two years later Westmoreland was created. In 1656 old Rappahannock was sliced from Lancaster and also lay astride the River. Each one of these counties, as it came into existence, ex¬ tended indefinitely up the Neck. In 1664 Stafford sprang from Westmoreland. In 1692 old Rappahnnock became Richmond and Essex. In 1720 King George was cut from Richmond. Then came Prince William in 1731, Fairfax in 1742, Loudoun in 1757, Fau¬ quier in 1759. The vast estate held by the Proprietor of the North¬ ern Neck contained 5,282,000 acres and included the present counties of Northumberland, Lancaster, Westmoreland, Richmond, King George, Stafford, Fauquier, Prince William, Fairfax, Loudoun, Cul¬ peper, Madison (new) Rappahannock, Page, Warren, Clarke, Shen¬ andoah, Frederick, Hardy, Hampshire, Morgan, Berkeley, and Jef¬ ferson — the five last being now in West Virginia. The formation of the parishes in Virginia was not always coin¬ cident, either in time or in boundary, with that of the counties. In some cases the ecclesiastical organization of territory preceded the civil. For this reason it is impossible to identify permanently an early parish with its containing county. For illustration. Sitting- bourne Parish at one time straddled the Rappahannock ; then it con¬ tracted so as to lie on the North side only, in Richmond county; then it lay for a few years in both Richmond and King George ; then it disappeared altogether. Nevertheless, certain parishes in the Northern Neck may be historically associated with certain counties, and for all the purposes of this family history the following table of counties and their parishes is adequate. 22 The Paynes of Virginia Northumberland: — Chickacoan, Wicocomoco (Wicomico), Fair- field, Lee, Boutracy, and St. Stephens. By 1^76 only Wicomico and St. Stephens remained. Lancaster : — Christ Church and St. Mary’s, later united as Christ Church. Westmoreland: — Cople on the South, and Washington on the North. Stafford: — Overwharton and St. Paul. The latter fell later in King George. Rappahannock: — Farnham, Sittingboume, and St. Mary’s. Richmond : — North Farnham, Sittingboume, and Lunenburg. King George: — Sittingboume, St. Mary’s, Hanover, Brunswick, Hamilton, and St. Paul’s. Sittingboume and St. Mary’s disappeared, and Hamilton was taken up by Prince William and Fauquier. Bruns¬ wick is now in Stafford. Prince William: — First Hamilton, and in 1745 Dettingen. Fairfax: — Truro, Cameron, and Fairfax. Cameron was absorbed by Loudoun. Loudoun : — Cameron, Shelburne. Fauquier : — Hamilton, Leeds. Culpeper: — St. Mark’s. Quoting from “Fauquier During the Proprietorship”, by Mr. H. C. Groome, to whom much is due for what little is said in this sketch : “The vestry of a parish consisted of twelve men, usually influential landholders, who were elected by the freeholders for an indefinite term. It was the only representative body in the parish, or in the county indeed, and on it fell the important duty of laying the parish levy, out of which poor relief was provided for; the salaries of the minister, clerk and sexton, paid ; glebe lands purchased and buildings erected; churches and chapels built and repaired, and other parochial expenses defrayed. In addition to choosing a min¬ ister, its other duties included judicial inquiry into and presentation for immoral practices, the apprenticing of bastards, and the disci¬ pline of vagrants. The vestry was also made responsible for * * * processioning the boundaries of every freeholder’s property. Each parish was required by law to lay off a glebe for its minister, and to erect a parsonage. Buildings for tenants and livestock completed the equipment; and when thus improved and ably managed, the glebe added materially to the clergyman’s income.” The Dictionary de¬ fines a glebe as “a portion of land attached to an ecclesiastical bene¬ fice”. It was an addition to the stipend, and its alienation by the The Northern Neck 23 incumbent was forbidden by law. The word seems now to be used indifferently and loosely as meaning either the land or the residence on it. Reverting to the geographical extent of the Northern Neck, it should be said that the name has come to mean in the present day only that portion of the proprietary South of Fredericksburg — by far the smaller part of the original territory. CHANGES IN THE CALENDAR Divested of its historical antecedents and its complex astronomical explanations, this matter may be stated briefly as follows. The early Romans divided the year into ten months. From the inaccuracy of their method of reckoning time, it appears that by Cicero’s day the Roman calendar had brought the vernal equinox almost two months later than it ought to be. To check this irregu¬ larity Julius Caesar introduced that method of reckoning which, in honor of him, has since been called the Julian calendar, the chief improvement being to restore the equinox into its proper place in March by the insertion of two new months. This calendar contin¬ ued in use throughout Christendom until 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII introduced a modified reckoning, since known as the Gregorian calendar. This latter change was made necessary in order to cor¬ rect a residual inaccuracy in the Julian method, which had resulted, by the i6th century, in a second tabular displacement of the equinox amounting to ten days. This second correction was accomplished by suppressing the 10 days from Oct 5 to Oct 14 inclusive, and gave rise to the expression ‘^new style” as applied to the Gregorian cal¬ endar, as distinguished from the “old Style” of the Julian calendar. This change in style met with considerable opposition, particularly in England, where the Gregorian calendar was not adopted until 1752, when — in order to get in step with the “new style” — the period from Sept 3 to Sept 13 was suppressed; in other words. Sept 3 was called Sept 14. This alteration in the English calendar embraced another point. The popular beginning of the year in that country was on Jany i, but the legal and ecclesiastical year began on Mch 25. Hence we see in the early colonial deeds and wills of Virginia, between 1607 1752, the double date affixed to documents written between Jany i and Mch 25. For example, the deed of John and Margaret Payne to their daughter-in-law was dated 23 Mch 1669/1670, which was actually 23 Mch 1670 of the calendar year, but 23 Mch 1669 of the legal year. This duplexity was done away with, and the year began, for all purposes, on Jany i. By way of a conspicuous illustration, this brief sketch of the changes in the calendar also explains what was meant by the in¬ scription on the stone erected at “Wakefield” in June 1813 by George [24] Changes in the Calendar 25 Washington Parke Custis, reading “Here the i ith of February 1732, Washington was born”. The date was ii Feb (O.S.) or 22 Feb (N.S.). In other words, any one making a contemporaneous Bible record of George Washington’s birth might have entered it correctly as “born ii February 173/4”. On the Continent at that date, the day was being called 22 February 1732, and the twenty-first exact anniversary of that day was likewise so called in England in 1753- » \\ HOMES Only those homes that I have had an opportunity of identifying and visiting are described in this chapter, and even these are very briefly covered. They are alphabetically arranged. BELLEVUE Bellevue was purchased by Captain William Payne (A-VI-4) for his daughter Marion about the time of her marriage to Dr. Clarkson, and was occupied by them until their departure for Missouri in 1841. In 1847 it became the home of Colonel Winter Payne (A-VIII-12). It is West of Clifton, across Great Run and less than a mile distant. There are no Payne or Clarkson graves there. Bellevue is owned at present by Mr. Clark Baldwin of Boston, who has renovated and to some extent altered the house, and made those changes which money and the cultivated tastes that go with it always impose upon old houses rescued from fast approaching decay. It is doubtless much more charming a home than it was immediately prior to its rehabili¬ tation, though how it compares in this respect with its ancient state no one can tell. But I remember distinctly the old house as it stood fifty years ago, when it lacked nothing in dignity, comfort, and capacity. There is no finer view in the county than that to be had from its Western front. Underneath all its improvements one can see in this fine old brick house evidences of its former substantial qualities. The best approach to Bellevue is by way of the old Warrenton- Waterloo highway, turning off to the right at Ade Forks and passing * ‘Granville.’’ BLEAK HALL Daniel Payne (A-VII-io) was the first Payne owner of Bleak Hall, on the South side of Mattox Creek, We. Co., and containing 1000 a. He bought it in 1820 from Robert S. Hipkins. It was formerly the home of Lawrence Butler, whose widow’s grave in the woods on the property is marked by a slab bearing the inscription — “Here lyeth interred the body of Mrs. Mary Butler, wife of Law¬ rence Butler, daughter of Mr. Marmaduke Beckwith, Baronet, de¬ parted this life the 3rd day of Dec. 1753, in the 27th year of her age. She left three children, viz. Beckwith, Peggy, and Lawrence Butler. She was the most affectionate wife, the tenderest mother, [26] Homes 27 and the best of mistresses, whose death was much lamented by her neighbors and all those who had the pleasure of her acquaintance.” The house at Bleak Hall was built of brick. It was bombarded dur¬ ing the War of 1812 and the Civil War. Nothing remains of it but the foundations, near which there is now a little frame dwelling. It stood on a point projecting into Mattox Creek about a mile from its mouth. The site is best reached via Laurel Grove. Wakefield lies just to the S.E. of Bleak Hall. Bleak Hall was the residence of the late Daniel Payne Wirt, buried at Red House. BLEAK HILL This home, still standing in good condition and occupied by the great-grandchildren of Richard Payne (A-VI-7), was built by him immediately after his marriage in 1795 to Mary Major, on land that belonged to her. It is, therefore, about 140 years old and owes its good state of preservation to the fact that it has been continuously occupied by the family. It is situated on a hill-top commanding a wide view towards the Blue Ridge mountains, and — facing North without neighboring trees in any number — deserves its name. It is a story and a half high frame building with a small porch in front and irregular small wings on the rear flanks. There are two mas¬ sive stone chimneys at the East end and one at the West. It is seven miles from Culpeper via the Catalpa-Rixeyville highway. The pres¬ ent occupants are Marvin C. Payne (A-IX-i 23) and his sister Mrs. Kulm and her husband. About 150 yards S.E. of the dwelling is the family burying-grourid, which is in good condition and contains 13 marked graves. CAVALLA In going South along the King’s Highway the first house on the left after entering Westmoreland county is Cavalla, three miles West of Oak Grove and approximately 100 yards from the road. It is a two-story frame house with a gable in the centre of the front roof, and a long front porch. It is not an old house nor is it prepossessing in appearance, having been built in that period when few if any contributions were made to the architectural beauty of country homes. It is probable that Bishop John Payne (A-VIII-5) built it, and it is certain that he died there. It has been recently renovated. CHESTNUT LAWN This old residence is three miles S.E. of Remington, Fq. Co., and on the road to Fredericksburg via Summerduck and Goldvein. It is 28 The Paynes of Virginia now occupied by Seymour B. Payne (A-IX-85). The estate borders on Marsh Run and lies on the E. side of the above road. The house is a large stone structure, with walls 4 feet thick and a massive chim¬ ney at each end, being two stories high above a semi-basement. Originally it was roofed with slate, and the front door was ap¬ proached by 6 or 8 broad stone steps without a porch. About two generations ago a porch was built in front of the house and a frame wing added on the South side. The family burying-ground, sur¬ rounded by a comparatively recent iron fence, lies back of the house and contains many marked graves. Formerly a large number of handsome chestnut trees surrounded the lawn and grave-yard, but due to a wide-spread blight these trees have died out completely and their gaunt skeletons give the place a dismal aspect. It is said that the house was built by Capt. James Payne, who bought land here shortly after his marriage in 1815. See (A-VII-18). During an in¬ spection of the exterior of the dwelling one’s attention is struck by the fact that its two back-doors open on an 8-foot drop to the ground, without any evidence of a former back-porch. Also one sees loop-holes in the walls. According to reliable tradition, the construc¬ tion of the house took place at a time when residents of this section were annoyed by wandering Indians, and hence, for defensive pur¬ poses, Chestnut Lawn was built with these inaccessible doors, from which portable steps could be lowered from the interior in the day¬ time and drawn up at night after the manner of a draw-bridge. During the Civil War Chestnut Lawn was raided by “the Yankees”, who collected all available forage and rations and threatened to burn the house. Old Captain James Payne went out and made himself known to the officer as a Mason, whereupon guards were posted around the house and the provisions returned. CHURCH POINT John Payne (A-VI-2) bought this land in 1811 from the Over¬ seers of the Poor, the successors to the Vestry of Washington Par¬ ish. It was a glebe land (see Introduction for definition), located on South side of the mouth of Mattox Creek and bequeathed to the Parish by Gilbert Hubard in his will dated 1688, at which time the Parish was called Appomattox. It was referred to as The Glebe in the records of the period when John Payne bought it. The name Church Point is found on present-day maps of the U.S. Geological Survey. It was the site of the Lower Church of Washington Parish, where George Washington was baptized 16 Apl 1732. The Upper Homes 29 Church was at Round Hill, about 6 Miles N.W. of Colonial Beach. By a change of county lines in Revolutionary times Round Hill fell in King George county, and Church Point remained in Westmore¬ land. Church Point was inherited by John Payne’s grand-daughter Mrs. William Wirt, who sold it. No Paynes ever lived there. CLIFTON The name of Clifton was probably derived from the fact that Burdett Clifton of St. Paul’s Parish, St. Co., owned a portion of it by purchase in 1740 as recorded in the Land Books of Fq. Co. It was in K.G. Co. in 1727; in Hamilton Parish, P.W. Co., in 1741 ; and passed into Fq. Co. in 1759. Clifton, as it is now identified, was patented 1724 by Lord Fairfax, Proprietor of the Northern Neck, to John Blowers, who sold it 1736 to William Payne (A-V-i). Wil¬ liam dying without issue, it passed to his father and then to his brother Richard, who also died single. By entail it then fell to the brother George Payne, “contrary to Richard’s known and professed intentions”. It appears that Richard desired his brother Daniel to have this land, and that, out of respect for his deceased brother’s wishes, George deeded it in 1779 to Daniel the day before George’s son William married Susannah Richards. Eleven days before Dan¬ iel died he gave Clifton to his nephew, the last-named William Payne, “in consideration of the love and affection which he had for the said William”. Clifton is on Great Run and five miles by road N.W. of Warrenton. The original grant to Blowers was for 453 a., but on a re-survey in 1781, was found to contain 1045 The last Payne owner was Arthur A. M. Payne (A-VII-16), who sold it in 1856 and moved to Missouri, reserving the grave-yard. It was pur¬ chased in 1879 for $18,000 by Major Robert P. Barry, who brought his family here from the North'and remained there till his death. The writer spent a year at Clifton in 1884-5 a guest of this charm¬ ing and cultured family. Major Barry’s daughter Margaret married Mr. Julien Keith; they are the present occupants of the place, whose name they have changed to Dunnottar. The house at Clifton was built of stone in 1799. An inscription on one of its chimneys bore the date 2 June 1799. At about 9 P.M. T Jany 1899, with the temperature at 8 degrees and all outside water plugs frozen, the house caught fire and burned to the ground. Major Barry then built a dwelling a few hundred yards distant. Several years later the Keiths built a new stone house on the site of the old residence, but differing greatly from it in design. The old 30 The Paynes of Virginia house had three stories and a large cellar. The kitchen was detached. The ceilings were fairly high. A wide hall occupied the full length of the N.E. side of the house. As I recall, there were two large ex¬ terior chimneys on the side of the house opposite the hall. A small porch stood at each end of this hall. A steep, narrow, and enclosed stairway stood at the back end of the hall. At the time of its de¬ struction by fire Major Barry was contemplating a Payne family reunion to celebrate the centennial of the building of the old house, which was as sound — to all appearances — as the year it was built. The family burying-ground, devoid of all identifying marks save a few rough stones set on edge and a row of depressions in the ground, stands 400 yards S.W. of the dwelling. Here Captain Wil¬ liam Payne (A-VI-4) and six other members of his household were buried. On 22 Oct 1932 about one hundred of Captain William Payne’s descendants assembled at this grave-yard to dedicate a stone wall, nine by twelve feet, that they had erected as a memorial rather than as an enclosure. A bronze tablet set in the back wall thereof gives the names of the seven persons here buried. Also set in this wall are two other bronze tablets, or markers, presented by the Vir¬ ginia Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution and by the Daughters of the Revolution. Visible from Clifton are the nearby homes of Bellevue and Granville. EDGLEY The present substantial and pleasingly designed frame house at Edgley is two and a half miles North of Lancaster Court House on the road to Heathsville, and stands about 150 yards from this road, on the East side thereof. At the time Richard Payne (D- VI-25) bought it, the farm was known as the Tannery, or Tan Yard. The present dwelling is a two-storied, gable-roofed house, with a porch running practically across the entire front. Over the middle third of the porch is a gable-end providing an extra room. There are attic rooms and small wings in rear of the building. After the death of Mrs. Richard Payne in 1843, the farm was sold to her son-in-law Colonel Samuel Downing, who built the present dwelling-house. In the North end of the garden, a few yards from the house, are ■eleven marked graves bearing the names Downing, Payne, and Broun. ELTHAM Quoting from a correspondent — ‘‘This Ditty homestead was a beautiful old place and the scene of lavish hospitality. It burned Homes 31 down before my day, but the lovely terrace and the stately wide- based chimneys showed how the home must have looked on its com¬ manding eminence.” The demesne contained 1400 a. and was pur¬ chased in 1830 by John P. Davis of Henry T. Garnett and wife Elizabeth S. In 1835 Mr. Davis, who later married Elizabeth Payne (A-VII-ii), sold it to George T. Ditty of Maryland and Thomas R. Ditty (A-VHI-2) of We. Co., Va. It lay on the East side of the Oak Grove-Colonial Beach road, bordered on the North side of Mat¬ tox Creek, and adjoined the land of Jesse Monroe. Across the road was Spring Grove, for a time the home of George W. Payne (A-VHI-8). GRANVILLE This was the home of Daniel Payne (A-VII-13). It was evi¬ dently a part of the Clifton estate at the time he occupied it. The building is standing but has suffered from age, being of frame and over 100 years old. The present occupants are Mr. and Mrs. Ray¬ mond Brown. It stands about one mile and a half S.W. of Clifton, and is best reached by the old Waterloo road out of Warrenton, leav¬ ing the same at a place called Ade Forks and proceeding Northward for about a mile ; Granville is then on the right of the road. About 100 yards S.W. of the house is the family burying-ground, where were buried Daniel Payne and ten other members of his family, all of whose graves are marked by cut stones. John Scott Payne ( A-VHI-16) is also buried there, but his grave is not marked. Daniel Payne’s will provided for the upkeep of this burying-ground, which, when last seen, was in excellent condition. GREEN HILL This was the home of George Payne (A-V-4). He died here but was probably buried at Red House. His land, consisting of about 600 a., lay for the most part on the North side of the King’s High¬ way — the main highway down the axis of the Northern Neck — and bordered thereon from Baynesville to the present Pope’s Creek church. It did not extend to the Potomac. Between it and Pope’s Creek lay the estate of Daniel McCarty, concerning which Mr. David W. Eaton of Oak Grove, We. Co., wrote me — “The home of Daniel McCarty must have been an outstanding brick house of the period, with brick enclosures and two sunken gardens which were probably the most extensive gardens of this type in Westmoreland county as the gardens at Stratford were not sunken in a true sense. McCarty’s gardens were ten feet below the surrounding surface. 32 The Paynes of Virginia brick walled, with a surrounding drainage ditch, and each about 1 50 feet square, one garden being ten feet lower than the other.” Cap¬ tain Daniel McCarty, here mentioned, married Winifred Thornton; he was grandson of Daniel McCarty who married Mrs. William Payne (B-II-3). East of Green Hill dwelt the Bayne family and the Lees at Stratford. Just beyond Pope’s Creek lay Wakefield, the home of the Washingtons. Across the highway to the South lived the Quesenberrys and Neales. Old Pope’s Creek Church, erected 1745, stood on the South side of the highway and opposite the en¬ trance to the McCarty estate. It is possible that Green Hill was not so called by George Payne, but it was certainly known as such by the descendants of Lawrence Pope, who bought it from Richard Payne in 1802. The house no longer remains, but the spot whereon it stood was pointed out to me by the present owner of the farm, Mr. Frank Washington, who demolished the house in order to utilize the ground. It was very antique and occupied the summit of a knoll one half-mile from the highway and well in rear of the pres¬ ent dwelling. It was a frame building, one and a half stories high, the stone chimney being on the N.W. side. The space between the studs was filled in with brick. Traces of the road to the house are visible. From its N.W. window beside the chimney, through an open glade through the surrounding woods, there could be seen boats sailing on Pope’s Creek. Nearby on the S.W. slope of the knoll lay the Pope family burying-ground, no traces of which remain, and from which — I understand — some of the bodies have been removed. HARD BARGAIN This very old house, still in existence though in alien hands, is a small frame building and possibly is not the original. Nevertheless, it is considered to be the original. It was the home of the late John C. Harding. The land attached to the dwelling lay partly in Lc. Co. but mostly in Nb. Co. It is East of Rehobeth church, which is about four miles N. of Kilmarnock and on the boundary between the two counties. The entrance to the farm is about one and a half miles E. of the church and on the road to Shiloh school. In a deed dated 1838 it is described as bounded on the North by China Grove and the main road leading from Doggett’s road to Ball’s Neck; on the East by Dividing Creek; on the South by William E. and Thomas Hugh- lett; and on the West by John George and John L. Lee. Richard Payne (D- VI-25) bought a part of Hard Bargain in 1816 from Benjamin Waddy, his wife’s brother. The remaining part was his Homes 33 wife’s maiden land, which she had inherited from her father James Waddy. She and her husband were first-cousins “once removed”. There was at one time a family burying-ground at Hard Bargain, but its outline has been effaced and its surface ploughed under. THE HOLLOW The Hollow, or Sleepy Hollow, was so named by the present gen¬ eration. James V. Brooke bought it shortly after the death of his son-in-law Charles E. F. Payne (A-VIII-25). It is a frame build¬ ing, having two and a half stories and a basement, and a portico of Greek design covering the front door. It is on Waterloo Street, Warrenton, two blocks from the Court House, and in my mother’s life-time was a very attractive home, well groomed in every sense. It is now in a state of dilapidation. No one of my family was born or died there except my grandfather James V. Brooke, who died there in 1898. My three sisters were married while living there. During the Civil War it was the home of Judge William H. Gaines. It was also the home of General Eppa Hunton, Mr. Alexander Hunter and his sisters, and Mrs. Jolliffe. Across the street is the handsome brick house built by Thaddeus Norris for his daughter Mary Elizabeth, who married Mr. Brooke; at the same time he built two other houses of the same design for two other daughters, both houses on Culpeper Street; one of these, now owned by Mrs. Belt, adjoined St. James Episcopal Church; the other adjoined the old Methodist Church next door to the Warren Green Hotel. At the Norris home on Waterloo Street James V. Brooke lived and his children were born. His wife and daughter Nannie and my father Charles E. F. Payne died there. It had four stories, spacious rooms, a wide front porch, and a large yard filled in my childhood days with fine-bearing apple and cherry trees in addition to the usual shrubs and flowers. The attached land occupied the whole square. The garden and orchard were filled with what now appears to me an amazing variety of fruits and vegetables — pears, apples, cherries, peaches, quinces, raspberries, grapes, currants, gooseberries, egg¬ plant, celery, asparagus, cauliflower, and all the more common va¬ rieties of vegetables. I do not recall that my father ever sprayed any his fruit trees, which bore abundant and excellent growth. After his death I used to peddle these varied products around town, transporting them in a two-wheeled cart drawn by a donkey named Peter, who, while leaving home, always proceeded at a very slow walk even under the heavy blows of a stick, but who invariably ran 34 The Paynes of Virginia uncontrollably when headed the other way, not infrequently upset¬ ting the cart and spilling its contents and the driver as he dashed into the lane by the house. My father gave this place the name Foxhall, but it did not stick. It was sold to Albert Fletcher. Before the social revolution marked by the advent of the automobile this neighborhood, off the principal streets out of the village, was a sweet and placid quarter whose tran¬ quility was never disturbed except when once a month on Court Day wagons loaded with farm produce and accompanied by outriders came lumbering down over the rough and dusty roads from the “Free State” and Rappahannock county, drawn by horses with high arches of noisy bells fastened over their necks. These arches, or yokes, of bells were always decorated in red and were designed by their clangor to give warning to approaching teams on the narrow and tortuous mountain roads. When these wagons returned home in the evening, empty and the riders and drivers more or less hilari¬ ous, all going at full speed, it was well for children along Waterloo Street to keep under cover. LAUREL GROVE This farm lay between Bleak Hall and Church Point. Next to Church Point on the South came Haywood, then Blenheim, then Wakefield — the three last being Washington estates. Daniel Payne (A-VII-io) purchased Laurel Grove in i8i8 from Alexander Mor- son, brother of Mrs. William Payne (A-VI-4), who bought it from Bushrod Washington of Mt. Vernon, who had it from Bushrod Washington of Zephyr. Daniel Payne’s daughter Mrs. Wirt in¬ herited it. According to Mr. H. R. Eubank, it was the home of the colonial pedagogue Henry Williams, who conducted here the best school of his day in this section, which was attended by George Washington 1743-7. LOCUST HILL White Oak Swamp, the first home of John Payne (A-VII-9) is a group of houses about half-way between Monroe and Mattox Creeks, and about a mile from each. It is also about one mile South of the birthplace of President James Monroe. All of this land is just West of Colonial Beach. In 1813 John Payne moved from White Oak Swamp to an old glebe, now called Locust Hill, For the defini¬ tion of a glebe, see the paragraph on the Northern Neck in the In¬ troduction. Locust Hill is three quarters of a mile North of Index (called Parker’s Store on U.S. Geological Survey maps and for- HoM ES 35 merly known as Johnsville), a cross-roads in K.G. Co. on the King’s Highway a mile or more from the We. Co. line. The house is sit¬ uated on a breezy hill- top from which a long stretch of the Potomac is visible to the East, contrasting strongly with the flat lands around White Oak Swamp. It is on the West side of the country road from Index to Pomona. The latter road runs into the stretch known as the Parson’s Road, described by Bishop John Payne (A-VIII-5) in his family letter to Bishop Meade. This glebe was once the residence of Rev. Archibald Campbell, who died 1774. After the Revolution these glebes, being no longer administered by Vestries of the Church of England, were taken over by the Overseers of the Poor. John Payne (A-VII-9) bought it from Mrs. Mary (Monroe) Thomas for $1000, at which time it contained 300 a. It was for long the home of the Dishman family. It is now owned by Mr. Augustine B. Broach. The brick foundations of the old house occupied by John Payne are faintly visible about 100 feet East of the present dwelling. PAYNE’S POINT 1135589 Payne’s Point and Church Point face each other across the mouth of Mattox Creek, the former on the North. John Payne (A-VI-2) bought it in 1803 and placed on it his son George until the latter’s death. John Payne then left it in his will to George’s son James Harvey Payne, by whom it was known as Point Pleasant. Geological Survey maps of today call it Payne’s Point. It adjoined the estates of the Monroe family on the North. During the first year of the Civil War it was sacked by Union troops, who left it an utter wreck and carried off a valuable law library and the family Bible. In recent years it was occupied as a hunting-lodge by a Wash¬ ington gun-club. RED HOUSE I am under the impression that Red House (now called Cedar Hill) stands on the grant of 298 a. to John Payne (A-I-i) in 1662, and described as beginning one mile from Rappahannock River on West side of Pepetick Creek adjacent to Thomas Hawkins, granted in 1657 to Thomas Wright. The earliest grant to John Payne in this vicinity was in 1653 on the lower side of Pepetick Creek, on a part of which John Payne lived in 1655. This earlier home I have been unable to locate. Cedar Hill is four miles by road from Oak Grove, We. Co., and is now owned by Mr. Harry W. Coates. It stands on the watershed between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers ; the water falling on the front roof of an out-building finds its way to the 36 The Paynes of Virginia Rappahannock, while that falling on the rear roof reaches the Po¬ tomac. In an airline Cedar Hill is two miles N.E. of Leedstown. It is 350 yards in rear of Bunker Hill, the old Taylor home; and 900 yards East of Twiford, the old Hungerford home. I have no in¬ formation as to the date of erection of Red House, nor who first lived there, but it is probable that John Payne’s son Richard was the first occupant, and it is certain that the latter’s grandson John Payne and his wife Jane Monroe lived there. There is no doubt that the elder John Payne and his immediate family were buried there, as indicated by the inscription on the oldest gravestone. The first house may have received its name from the fact that it was made of brick ; it is highly improbable that it was a frame house painted red, as paint was a scarce commodity in those days and the practice of leav¬ ing houses unpainted was in general use. Many of the oldest houses in New England today have not suffered from the lack of paint. The dwelling burned down during the residence of the Mastins, the last Payne occupants. They changed the name to Cedar Hill. The pres¬ ent frame residence was built on the original site. Dr. and Mrs. William Wirt, the last Payne owners, sold the farm in i860, reserv¬ ing the grave-yard about 100 yards South of the dwelling, and the right-of-way thereto. On II May 1935, in the presence of about 150 members of the family, a concrete wall around the 15 remaining gravestones was dedicated. This wall was built from the contributions of 118 de¬ scendants of the original Payne owner of this estate. In addition, there are several ancient unmarked graves in the unwalled portion of this reservation, where doubtless lie the remains of all those early members of the family who resided in the neighborhood. It was not until 1753 that any member of this Payne colony bought land out of sight of Red House, and even that was only four miles distant. The original burying-ground was 80 feet by 130 feet. The present wall occupies the exact N.W. corner of the original ground, the major axis of which ran about North and South. The names of those whose grave-stones are now in place in this burying-ground are — Dr. William Wirt, his wife Bettie Selena Wirt (A-VHI-ii), and their children Willie and Catherine Randall Wirt ; Daniel Payne (A-VII-io) and his wife Selina Coates Payne; John Payne (A- VII-9) and his wife Frances P. Payne; John Payne (A-VI-2) ; Dr. Thomas R. Ditty, his wife Eliza A. Ditty (A-VIII-2), and their daughter Sarah Payne Ditty; James H. Payne (A-VHI-i); Mrs. Elizabeth N. Payne (wife of A-VIII-3); and Daniel Payne (A-V-5). In the Northwest corner of the enclosure is the grave of Homes 37 Dr. William Wirt’s son Daniel P. M. Wirt, marked at present with a wooden cross only. WIRTLAND This was the residence of Dr. William Wirt and his wife Betty Payne (A-VIII-ii), who began the building of it several years be¬ fore the Civil War, It was named after his home in Baltimore, where he lived following his graduation in medicine and which has been torn down. With the idea of escaping the mosquitoes in the Potomac Flats, in which Bleak Hall stood, Dr. Wirt bought from Charles Jett land ‘^in the forest of Westmoreland county” and on the watershed between the two rivers, and there built the new Wirtland, which was seven years under construction, owing principally to the interruption of the Civil War. During its construction the Wirts lived in various nearby homes — the Rectory, Audley, Mt. Rose, Cedar Hill, etc. Though not completed according to original plans, Wirtland is described in Mr. Eubank’s “Guidebook of the Northern Neck” as “a handsome brick dwelling, set among terraced grounds, adorned by handsome trees.” I visited Wirtland and was surprised and delighted by the artistic design of the details of architecture, seen in the beautiful moulded plaster patterns in cornices and ceil¬ ings, in the balustrades, doors, windows, hall-ways, etc. As I en¬ tered the building my eyes were greeted by the statue of a cupid or satyr occupying the centre of a sort of vestibule formed by a trans¬ verse corridor down the hall-way. Mr. William Dabney Wirt and his family resided at Wirtland when I was there. Their niece Mrs. Nalle and her husband were the last occupants of Wirtland. WOODLAWN After having been told that here Richard H. F. Payne (D-VII-21 ) dispensed outstanding hospitality, I was not prepared for the de¬ pression caused by observing Woodlawn’s dismal aspect. There is nothing so pathetic as an old house falling into isolation and decay. Woodlawn is 100 years old. It is the familiar type of frame house, two stories with five windows upstairs in front, and a small portico over the door beneath the middle window. The rear slope of its gable roof is carried back to accommodate additional rooms opening on a back porch. A small office stands close by its right side. Wood¬ lawn is situated in Nb. Co. on Wicomico River near Brown’s Store, about half-way between Heathsville and Wicomico church. After the Civil War Mr. Payne sold it to Mr. Bowker of Maine. AUTHORITIES CONSULTED It was inevitable in the preparation of this book that publications and letters and conversations of every description were relied on as authority for the statements herein contained; and it follows, as a corrolary, that the account is no more accurate than its vouchers; adding, of course, that obvious errors have been eliminated and an attempt made to check all vital statistics. While I do not claim that every pertinent source of information has been exhausted, assurance is given that I have drained all those that I ever heard of. Realizing that there still remain many unavoidable errors and omissions in the book, there have been inserted in the back a number of blank pages on which such defects may be recorded by my readers.

Acknowledgment is here made of the incalculably valuable help and encouragement given by a small but enthusiastic group of cousins, principally women, who have sub¬ mitted with great patience to my oft-repeated, hammering calls for more accuracy and more detail. NOTATION, SYMBOLS, AND ABBREVIATIONS Each of certain branches of our family was associated for many generations with a particular county, or part of the county, and did not regard itself as recognizably related to the others. Insurmount¬ able traffic barriers separated these branches, and the children of one group grew up as strangers to the children of another. To assist the reader in the identification of any individual and to simplify the system of numbering individuals, these branches have been arranged in four Sections. Section A includes the immigrant ancestor and the branch identi¬ fied with Culpeper County, King George County, and Warrenton, Fauquier County. Section B includes the branch that flourished in Fairfax County in the latter half of the i8th century and then moved to Kentucky. Section C includes the branch identified with the upper part of Fauquier County, around Orlean, and with Orange and Bath Counties. Section D includes the branch which for a century was prominent in Lancaster and Northumberland Counties and had an off-shoot in Warrenton. See the double-page Diagram facing page xii. In each Section individuals are segregated by generation ; genera¬ tions are numbered in Roman notation, beginning with the immi¬ grant ancestor. In each generation these individuals are given a number in Arabic notation. Thus Richard (A-V-3) is the third per¬ son listed in the fifth generation in Section A. His name is there followed by the symbol (s. 5), which means that he is the son of number five in the preceding (or fourth) generation, who was John. John’s number is, therefore, (A-IV-5). To find Richard’s nephews and nieces, it is obvious that they will appear in the sixth generation. In referring to persons in the same Section, the capital letter has generally been omitted in order to save space; and, for the same reason, persons in the same generation as the individual under discussion have generally been designated by their serial num¬ ber only. The Roman numeral has also occasionally been omitted where the context shows the genealogical relation between the parties.
