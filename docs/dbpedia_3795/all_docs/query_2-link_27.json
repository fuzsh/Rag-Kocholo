He prayed for Providence to \"interpose\" itself in battles, marches, and other his­ torical events in favor of the cause of liberty-and urged public Thanksgiving to God when it did. It was Washington's strong faith in divine Providence that gave meaning and force to his mon­ umental life. Narrowly escaping a British trap during the Battle of Brooklyn, Washington didn't credit his survival to courage or tactical expertise; he blamed himself for his inexperience, which led him to march his men into harm's way, and for years after thanked the Providence that delivered them. Throughout his career, Washington held fast to the conviction that America's liberty is dependent on our faithfulness to God's will and our trust in Providence.\n\nvVashington's God shows Washington not only as a man of resource, steadiness in defense, and unusual courage in battle, but also as a man of a basic but underrated, tough-minded Anglican faith. Drawing upon new sources and Washington's own words, the Novaks reveal that the first president was indeed deeply spiritual though also deeply pri­ vate about his personal religious convictions and practices.

The pillars of the portico were illuminated by candles on the laden table. Next to me, speaking in eighteenth-century turns of phrase, was a tall white-haired actor, the spitting image of a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington. He was, as Washington is re­ puted to have been, an amiable, reserved, and kindly man, slow and sober and yet quite warm in his responses to my questions. Across the table, at its head, sat James Rees, the careful, scholarly, yet bold leader of Mount Vernon. He had said earlier he had a question for me at the end of our elegant dinner, which was attended by just over a dozen· guests. Meanwhile, the conversation was lively, the Virginia wine light and tasty, and the October air balmy, fresh, and exceed­ ingly soft upon our faces. One felt a little of the thankfulness George Washington must have felt as he sat on this very patio with his friends, two hundred years before, a glass of port in his hand. Inside, each of the brilliantly painted walls of the mansion had been meticulously matched with the colors found on bits of ancient paint carefully uncovered during the recent restoration. As we walked through, admiringly, the question Mr. Rees at last put to me was this: He had been looking for an author to write a book on the IX\n\nx\n\n-\n\nPREFACE\n\nreligious life of George Washington, and having read On Two Wings: Humble Faith and Common Sense at the American Found­ ing (Encounter Books, 2002 ), he wondered if I might do it. He pointed out the resources that Mount Vernon offered and asked me to contact Mary Thompson, a researcher in the archives there, who was assiduously digging into the background of this very subject. I promised Mr. Rees to think the project over but told him I was already committed to several years of work on other books; so the answer would probably be no, but I would consider it. Nearly a week later, I felt differently. My daughter Jana promised to help me with the research and writing. If I could postpone the project for two years or so, enough to assign summer interns and my regular assistant, in his free time, to begin gathering materials, maybe it could be done. The more I thought about the debt my family and I owed to George Washington for the freedoms we enjoy, and the high national standard he set for us, the more the task seemed like an obligation, not simply a pleasure. So Jana and I began the buy­ ing of books and the building of files, based upon our systematic reading plan. And I telephoned in our willingness. Mr. Rees told me that Mount Vernon receives more than a mil­ lion visitors a year and, with its new Visitors Center already under construction, was making ready for many more. One of the most frequent requests he received frorn visitors, he said, was for a book on George Washington's religion. The subject is a delicate one, for there has been a great deal of controversy about that subject, much of it quite passionate. Some claim that Washington asked for, and received, baptism by immersion in the Delaware River at the hands of a Baptist preacher; a few even claim improbably that, due to his closeness to the Catholic Carroll family of Maryland, Washington came to admire Catholicism and asked to be baptized by a priest from Georgetown in his last days. There are untrustworthy stories about Washington in prayer at Valley Forge, as well as one about his leaving behind hand-written copies of prayers for each day of\n\nPREFACE\n\n-\n\nx1\n\nthe week, taken from an official-sounding Christian prayer book. Meanwhile, as a whole, most historians of the twentieth century ap­ peared to be rather uninterested in religion and had more-or-less ex­ hausted the subject by putting Washington down as a deist, at best a tepid Anglican, and little more than a practical eighteenth-century rationalist. In fact, those who were most insistent on this last interpreta­ tion-and it was the preponderant view-maintained three distinct theses: 1. Washington was a deist. 2. In a lukewarm fashion, he kept up the appearances of being a Christian, more for public consumption than out of convic­ tion. Essentially, he was not a Christian, or was only barely so. 3. Although he spoke often of \"Providence,\" he meant something more like fate or destiny-an impersonal force-than like the biblical God of the Hebrews and Christians, whose Providence might act in history both in ordinary and in miraculous ways. In short, they posited, Washington was more like a modern secu­ lar believer than like an authentic Christian. In this book, my daughter Jana and I try to take Washington's words about God seriously. We try to understand just who Wash­ ington's God is. Our findings on all three points, we will admit, are almost the reverse of the conventional wisdom. Washington cannot be said to be a deist. He was a serious Christian, perceived to be so by many quite close to him, less clearly so in the documentary record. And as he explained to the Hebrew Congregation in Savan­ nah after he became president, his idea of Providence was the God Jehovah, who had so often guided and blessed Israel of old. We have written this book for the average visitor to Mount Vernon, vvho comes physically by the million or so every year, to enjoy the beautiful home and grounds left to posterity. (Nowadays, we must add, under the protection of the incredibly dynamic and visionary\n\nxii\n\n- PREFACE\n\nMount Vernon Ladies Association-which was founded in 1853 by a woman distraught over the condition of the mansion, and which originally saved the crumbling estate by purchasing it in 1858Mount Vernon has been wonderfully restored to its original appear­ ance, and its amenities are being constantly improved. ) But we write also for those who can journey only in thought, to learn more about the man who more than any other won the independence of the United States and taught the American people by his example and leadership how one lives, if one would contribute to the vitality of a free republic. We write for ordinary people rather than for scholars, although we admit that the subject matter requires us occasionally to haul in some twenty-five-cent theological terms, such as natural theology and theodicy and secondary causes-but we promise to explain these quickly, in ordinary language. For exarnple, theodicy is a name for the college course whose subject is God's actions in human his­ tory, particularly as regards evil in the world. The term secondary causes points to all those causes that are not divine (since God is the First Cause, who brings the secondary causes into being), such as the actions of human beings and other created things, including the weather, climate, hurricanes, diseases, and so on. We are very fortunate to have, in the late stages of our own writ­ ing, the profoundly helpful new manuscript by Mary Thompson, \"In the Hands of a Good Providence\" (publication forthcoming). Ms. Thompson has been exceedingly kind and helpful to us from the beginning of our work. The tremendous detail she has un­ earthed has changed Washington scholarship on these matters for generations to come. We are lucky to be the first to have her text at hand as we conclude our own work. We consider, not in as much detail as Ms. Thompson, the faith of Washington's parents and ancestors, as well as the faith of his step­ grandchildren, nieces and nephews, and their families (it was an abiding sorrow of his that he was unable to have children of his own). He was not alone in his faith; he was part of a great chain of\n\nPREFACE\n\n-\n\nx111\n\ntradition. We look, too, at his personal correspondence and such witnesses of his personal life as history has allowed to come down to us. One thing we discovered-a matter of great importance-is that his private life and public life were all of a piece, seamlessly con­ nected. What he said in public about religion he also said in private about his own life. Sadly, after his death his wife, Martha, his clos­ est confidante on matters of religion as on all else, destroyed all the many letters they had exchanged over the years. Since the two were known to be extremely close to one another-Martha followed him despite the rigors of military life to such camp sites as she could dur­ ing the War of Independence-we might have expected from that correspondence a luminous revelation of their inner life, such as one finds in the letters of Abigail and John Adams. Reserved and private to the end, clearly the Washingtons did not wish that to happen. This reticence was of a piece with the General's earlier care to be known for his public, not his private, life. He wished the focus to be on the future republic for which he had risked his life, his for­ tune, and his sacred honor. (How the British would have loved to hang him, the leading traitor in the insurrection. ) We attend especially, then, to Washington's public declarations, orders, and messages. We do so because these are still of most weight to the public life of the United States. They set an official precedent for all commanders of the armed forces and all presidents to follow. They themselves constitute part of the official record of the basic religious expressions, rituals, and collective religious ac­ tions of the United States, particularly in its most formative stage. Many of Washington's actions established precedents to which Washington had given deliberate and careful forethought, since in most cases the Constitution and the laws allowed the discretion to him. He cared mightily that the sacrifices from which his men had suffered so much not be wasted by inattention or carelessness. As Thomas Jefferson testified, Washington was sometimes slow to decide, but unusually thorough and attentive to alternative chains\n\nxiv\n\n-\n\nPREFACE\n\nof future consequences before deciding. Had Washington wished to set forth a purely secular, Enlightenment vision of public life, for ex­ ample, he could have done so. Instead, he mixed the secular and the Judea-Christian style, in an almost perfect balance. A NOTE ON METHOD\n\nWriting this book was like writing a detective story. We began with certain facts that had caught our eye-for example, the warm and convincing prayers embodied in several of Washington's public doc­ uments as general and as president. Against these facts, we knew well the existing theory of the case: that Washington did not intend those prayers in the way a truly believing Christian might, since he was actually a deist, not really a Christian at all. The existing theory of the case also admits that Washington paid homage many times to the \"interpositions\" of \"Providence\" into the course of the American War of Independence. But conventional wisdom devalues these prayers because it posits that Washington really meant by Providence nothing more than what the Greeks meant by fate, fortune, or des­ tiny. We suspected that the existing theory is forcing the facts, like a blanket on a boy's bed unsuccessfully hiding his favorite things. When a detective begins to disbelieve the existing theory of the case, common practice is to go back again to the facts, as Sherlock Holmes often advises his sidekick, Dr. Watson, to do. \"The facts,\" Holmes will insist. \"First the facts.\" And then, \"Logic, Dr. Watson. Logic.\" This insistence by Holmes on \"logic\" has often puzzled readers of Conan Doyle. For Sherlock Holmes does not exactly em­ ploy deductive logic-trying to reason from a general principle to a fact. On the contrary, he begins with facts. But he isn't really using inductive logic, either-building up from a series of facts to a gen­ eral principle. Holmes often discovers a single slender clue, over­ looked by everybody else-and then what? He employs a logic peculiar to detectives. It is a type of logic that until a hundred years ago or so did not even have a name.\n\nPREFACE\n\n-\n\nxv\n\nThe great American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce of Har­ vard was the first logician to invent for this unique logic a special name: abductive logic. It is the logic of working from often quite tiny concrete facts, overlooked by other investigators, until a bril­ liant sleuth can imagine a narrative that conclusively accounts for all of these facts. It is the sort of logic relied upon by detectives, in­ vestigators into art frauds, and wilderness guides. For example, in James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking tales, one of the Deerslayer's Mohican companions comes upon the clear imprint of a forest animal at the edge of a lake. From trained observation, he \"reads\" many features of the \"story\" that lies behind the making of that footprint. He can tell how long ago the print was made, by which sort of animal, of which particular weight and height, at what time of day, and in which probable cir­ cumstances. From his general knowledge of forest life, his imagi­ nation is fertile in conjuring up possibilities and eliminating all but a very few. Something like this happens in solving historical riddles, too. Mason Locke \"Parson\" \\Veems tells the story of General Washing­ ton slipping away into the trees for a silent prayer at Valley Forge. Weems cites as evidence for this tale the witness of a Quaker resi­ dent from nearby, a pacifist at first opposed to the war. So moved is the Quaker from watching the piety of the general at prayer, ac­ cording to Weems, that he changes his mind and contemplates en­ listing in the army. This is the \"story\" that Weems presents, and it lies behind one of the most popularly displayed of Washington portraits (see the first page of the photo insert). The story is so vivid that it at first persuades us that the story is founded upon the account of an actual eyewitness. Later historians, however, such as Frank Grizzard, have looked into the records of the Quaker mentioned by Weems and found that he did, indeed, exist at the required time, but that he did not just then live in the nearby cottage in which Weems places him, in the year of Washington's prayer. 1 'This discovery does not completely\n\nxvi\n\n-\n\nPREFACE\n\ndisprove the Weems story, but it does cast considerable doubt upon it, at least as Weems tells it. Since no further corroborating witness of this story is found, historians are inclined to set the whole story aside as unfounded. A number of other witnesses during the war years, however, did testify that Washington set aside a number of hours each week (varying as to the time of day) for private time. Part of this time, some added, was for private prayer. That testimony may tend to corroborate the plausibility of the Weems tale, if not its story about the Quaker witness. There is a second consideration to address. If Washington did not in fact pray in private, he was a hypocrite. For he urged his officers and his men to beseech Providence in prayer, that the cause of freedom might be furthered by the \".A.lmighty dis­ poser of all human events.\" If he himself did not lead the way by his own personal prayers, he would have shown a grave lack of in­ tegrity. In brief, it is by attention to such small details that an authentic narrative is arrived at, that is, a narrative that makes sense of all the known facts about a man. It is important for such a narrative to display the man's character and habits as witnesses showed them to have been. The new solution must also avoid the anom­ alies occasioned by the inadequate narratives it replaces. In other words, the special logic of detectives begins with the close obser­ vation of certain facts, especially facts that others have so far missed. Next, it draws upon its large experience of the world to come up with a human narrative that makes sense of these facts. It is a movement from the keen observation of known facts to an ex­ planatory narrative. That new narrative must simultaneously sat­ isfy all that one knows about the character and actions of the subject of investigation and also expose the inadequacies of rival narratives, point by point. That is what one means by the special logic of detectives (and certain other kinds of investigators into concrete matters). It is not necessary to remember the technical name abductive logic in order to appreciate it as a type of logic as\n\nPREFACE\n\n-\n\nxvn\n\nimportant and useful in its way as deductive and inductive logic in philosophy and the sciences. There is one further and related point about our method that may help some readers to see what we are doing, although perhaps not all readers. An artist and historian of art well known to the authors (mother of one, wife of the other) has pointed out to them how the fourteenth­ century painter Giotto discovered the role of perspective in painting: He rendered objects farther away in the painting smaller, just as they appear to the eye. Because of Giotto's discoveries in technique, painting ceased being \"flat\" (like ancient icons) and acquired \"depth.\" In this and other ways, Giotto changed the course of West­ ern painting forever; and yet, Giotto's own discovery was only par­ tial. In one painting, for example, the perspective he used to paint a bed runs in one direction, but the perspective he used in painting the walls of the surrounding room runs in another, and the perspectives used in painting the exterior gardens and the far-off orchards on the hills are different yet again. Only a while later did painters come to recognize the importance of the single-point reference that is natural to the human eye. In a painting itself, this single point is invisible, in the sense that nothing in particular may mark it. But by studying the way all the lines of the painting point, as well as the depths of per­ spective within it, one may imagine that point lying in space some­ where \"behind\" the entire painting. It is the point from which every line in the painting receives its orientation. If it is missing, the eye is puzzled and restless, for something in the painting is really amiss. Now there is something like this \"single-point perspective\" in a bi­ ographical study, too. If the interpretation is true, everything must point in the same direction. For most historians in recent generations, it appears, the organiz­ ing point of reference for George Washington has been that he was not a Christian, except perhaps in some perfunctory sense, but a vague sort of \"deist.\" He is said to have been a believer in a god who does not act in history, a god that does not favor one side in\n\nxviii\n\n-\n\nPREFACE\n\nhuman affairs over another, a god that does not perform \"mira­ cles,\" or even great and wondrous deeds, a god that is indifferent to human events. Unlike the atheist, the deist does believe in some great and \"di­ vine\" force of life or energy, driving through all things. But the deist holds that the divine force in things is impersonal and, on the whole, indifferent to human life. To such a god, who is rather like nature itself, there is really no point in praying, or making sacrifice, or performing fasts and other acts of humiliation and petition. To a deist, such acts seem irrational and unworthy of persons of com­ mon sense. Yet these are exactly the sorts of acts in which George Washington did participate, at Anglican services throughout his whole life, and in the most solemn way with his troops during the war, and with his fellow citizens on many formal occasions during his presidency. The conventional point of reference for Washington's life, therefore, seems to leave out important facts, and to falsify important aspects of his behavior. By contrast, our own single point of reference, giving perspective to every point of our narrative, is that George Washington was a man of integrity, who meant what he said, and did what he asked others to do, and acted seamlessly between his private life and his public life. We do not believe that he was a hypocrite. We do not ex­ pect that he commended religion to the public only in the service of a \"political religion\" or \"civil religion,\" in which he was for his own part too sophisticated to believe. This is, at least, our hypothe­ sis, the point of departure at which we begin, the point of view we adopt provisionally. A historian might well begin a study of Thomas Jefferson from the opposite point of reference, since Jefferson gave many fairly visible signs of his disbelief in orthodox Christianity, at the same time as he very publicly, marching down Pennsylvania Avenue with his red prayer book under his arm, took part in Christian services at the Capitol building in Washington. 2 (He even ordered\n\nPREFACE\n\n-\n\nxix\n\nthe Marine Band to provide the music, at government expense. Where was the ACLU when we needed it, right at the beginning? ) These services in the Capitol building were, during the Jefferson administration, the largest Christian services in the nation, and Jefferson quite prominently took part in them. Nonetheless, Jef­ ferson practically admitted that he took part from a sense of duty, not from faith. One cannot, we think, begin with the assumption that Jefferson's double vision about religion (public versus private) was also operative in George Washington. Our method, at least, was to begin with trust in Washington's integrity. All the facts fall far better into place if we expect to find integrity of public and private in Washington's views and actions regarding Providence and Christian faith. Washington's virtually universal reputation for integrity among those who knew him seems to confirm what we found. CONCLUSION\n\nIn short, the adventure of writing this book was intensely fascinat­ ing. The research was extraordinarily absorbing. It might seem im­ possible to come away from a study of the details of his life with an even higher estimation of Washington than when we began, since the mythic dimensions of his public image already seem too good to be believed. The truth is that the more one meets him as a human being like oneself, the closer one comes to being stunned by his sheer achievement, and not just in the public sphere, but just as much in the private sphere. How, for example, can one not admire his lifelong battle to master his own violent temper, and to lighten around the dinner table his own reserved and serious nature? From both his father and his mother, not to mention the older brother he idolized, he learned always to want to be better. As a boy, he even wrote out in his own hand 110 maxims by which he could measure his own self-improvements, if he so chose. And so, it seems, he did choose.\n\nxx\n\n- PREFACE\n\nWashington did not lose himself in public life. He did not fly from his own interior struggles.

It would be unsatisfying to pronounce on whether he was a deist or anything more than a weak and watery Christian without seeing the totality of his personality and his life. THE MAN\n\nThe women of his generation were invariably excited to meet General George Washington in person. He was tall--some accounts say six feet four. His demeanor was grave but extremely courteous, and with the ladies, gallant. His blue-gray eyes seemed to gaze deeply into the eyes of those he met, and he took women seriously. With his men, Washington stood like a Roman warrior in his dignity, serenity, and sense of purpose. His build was tall and strong, as well a warrior's might be; his arms ,,rere long, and his grip was forceful. He was re­ puted to be one of the best horsemen in Virginia, and his movements 3\n\n4\n\n-\n\nWAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nstruck witnesses as unusually lithe and graceful. Those who in various cities along the route from Virginia to Philadelphia, New York, and Boston saw him ride into town, usually on a white stallion, behind a troop of honor guards understood what the saying meant, \"A man born to the saddle.\" The general was plainly also a man born to lead other men, a man intended by Providence to lead men into battle and out again, a man intended to be honored, admired, trusted, followed. Such was the effect George Washington had upon his contempo­ raries. There was never any dispute about it, even among the very smart and ambitious men who chose him as their leader. In his favorite blue coat, white waistcoat, and buff trousers, the tall horseman among them, or the suave, usually silent, mild conversationalist, George Washington knew he was a man to be reckoned with. But he was also without pretense. Although he was a complicated man, of many tur­ bulent passions (nearly always kept under control), and of a much­ remarked reserve and sense of privacy, what you saw, for the most part, was what you got. To those he addressed, he seemed fully present, and his manner was unfeigned. Most who met him found him quite impressive, even moving, and therefore to become a loyal follower of Washington-and to want to be his friend-seemed not at all difficult. Captain George Mercer, an aide to Colonel Washington in the Virginia militia, wrote of him in 1760 (when Washington was not yet thirty): \"In conversation he looks you full in the face, is deliber­ ate, deferential, and engaging. His demeanor at all times composed and even dignified. \" 2 Just months before Washington's death in 1799, while her husband John \\Vas serving as the nation's second president, Abigail Adams-who could be quite critical of other males around her, especially Thomas Jefferson, to whom at times she was particularly hostile-wrote in a private letter to her sister what she had come to think of Wa�hington, now that she had come to know him so closely, and after so long a period of time: No n1an ever lived, n1ore deservedly beloved and Respected. The praise and I may say adulation which followed his administration\n\nGeorge Wash ington, The Man\n\n-\n\n5\n\nfor several years, never made him forget that he was a Man, subj ect to the weakness and frailty attached to human Nature. He never grew giddy, but ever maintained a modest diffidence of his own tal­ ents, and if that was an error, it was of the amiable and engaging kind, tho it might lead sometimes to want of some decisions in some great Emergencys. Possesst of power, possesst of an extensive influence, he never used it but for the benefit of his Country. Wit­ ness his retirement to private Life when Peace closed the scenes of War; when call' d by the unanimous suffrages of the People to the chief Majestracy of the Nation, he acquitted himself to the satisfac­ tion and applause of all Good Men . When assailed by faction, when reviled by Party, he suffered with dignity, and Retired from his exalted station with a Character which malice would not wound, nor envy tarnish. If we look through the whole tenor of his Life, History will not produce to us a Parallel. 3\n\nThese words seem all the more significant in that, early in their careers, John Adams had openly announced in the Continental Con­ gress that he considered himself Washington's superior. Adams had even said (outrageously, and over the top): \"That Washington was not a scholar is certain. That he was too illiterate, unlearned and unread for his station and reputation, is equally beyond dispute.\" Adams had even once stooped to such pettiness as this: \"Would Washington ever have been Commander of the Revolutionary Army or President of the United States if he had not married the rich widow of Mr. Custis?\" 4 Before Washington had married, of course, he was actually far wealthier in land than John Adams. On the other hand, Adams had earlier praised Washington very highly to Abigail, as far back as 1774, before Abigail had ever met the Vir­ ginian, when Washington and Adams both attended the First Conti­ nental Congress in Philadelphia. And his praise of Washington, in the name of the Senate, when Washington accepted the presidency, was of a very high order. 5 Both John and Abigail could be wither­ ingly frank in their assessments of others, especially of rivals of John\n\n6\n\n-\n\nWAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nfor international fame, and as a consequence their praise, being rarer, has higher value than most. But it is not only his countrymen who admired Washington. King George III himself, on hearing that Washington laid down his sword after the British armies at last left the United States, and re­ tired to private life on his farm, said with some wonderment that this act \"placed him in a light the most distinguished of any man living. . . . The greatest character of the age. \" 6 Some years later, in 1794, the English statesman Charles James Fox wrote of Washington: \"It must, indeed, create astonishment, that placed in circumstances so critical, and filling for a series of years a station so conspicuous, his character should never once have been called in question, that he should in no one instance have been accused either of improper insolence, or of mean submission, in his transactions with foreign nations. For him, it has been reserved to run the race of glory, with­ out experiencing the smallest interruption to the brilliancy of his career. \" 7 Rarely in the annals of history have as many diverse persons tes­ tified so freely to a leader's merit and praised his steady display of virtue. What was the source of his steadfastness under most bitter adversity-military reversal after military reversal, illness sweeping his troops, lack of promised funds to pay them, dejection, and low morale? What was the source of his ability to resist temptations of power and might that have turned the heads of nearly every suc­ cessful savior/general in history? What kept his keel so even? These are questions we must often come back to in this study. They are the questions that logically flow out of the years of historians dismiss­ ing Washington as a deist and proclaiming him not a Christian, or at least not a strong Christian. For where did Washington himself pinpoint the source of his strength? Whom did he thank? Of course, many were the words of criticism launched at Wash­ ington during his lifetime. He was forced to be quite self-conscious about his lack of learning. While he had attended some years of schooling as a boy, he did not receive the normal full complement.\n\nGeorge Washington, The Man\n\n-\n\n7\n\nLater, his \"university\" training-unlike that of John Adams at Har­ vard, James Madison at Princeton, and Alexander Hamilton at Co­ lumbia-consisted of four rugged expeditions into the backwoods of the Monongahela, seeking out representatives of the French and Indians, once for peace and the other times in war, when he was in his early twenties. So his only higher education consisted of the lessons he took in surveying, which was considered a prestigious ca­ reer at the time, and so he was able to satisfy his own ambition and put in his possession a useful trade. On the other hand, during his lifetime he accumulated, mostly by deliberate purchase, a library of more than seven hundred books, a great many of which he perused or even studied closely. He was no dummy, and his extemporaneous writing style, although simple and direct by the standards of the time (but complex by today's standards), is often quite moving. Well before he married Martha Custis, Washington was engaged in as much buying of land as he could afford-fifteen hundred acres in one great transaction-and he surveyed many of his new pur­ chases himself. He earned hundreds of acres through his surveying and sorne timely purchases that it led to, and he received thousands of other acres from his multiple services at Monongahela. In the end, added to what he inherited of his own near Mount Vernon (some twenty-two hundred acres), his holdings, some ten thousand acres even before he married Mrs. Custis, were quite large. Although many good historians don't seem much to admire Washington's en­ terprise or his agricultural and commercial skills, these deserve de­ tailed attention. Washington was one of the great business leaders in Virginia. His land holdings were vast, and his whiskey still at Mount Vernon was the largest for several states around (he produced eleven thousand gallons of alcohol in 1798). 8 Without any doubt, his skills in enterprise exceeded those of Jefferson, Madison, Adams, and most of the other famous men of his generation. His achievements in busi­ ness would have made him notable even apart from his military and political exploits. He loved to discover the practical secrets of these domestic crafts and studied them assiduously.\n\n8\n\n- WAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nHIS MOR AL E DUC ATION\n\nWashington had been born into a Virginia family of moderate wealth (roughly the equivalent of today's upper middle class) and the traditional faith of the Church of England. In England, George's great-great-grandfather had been an Anglican pastor. The family, although not overly devout or outwardly demonstra­ tive, was faithful: lessons in religion, regular prayers, reverence for the Almighty, observant attendance at Sunday services at least once a month. The branch of the church they belonged to was lat­ itudinarian-rather than strictly biblical. George was a third son, and even though his father died when he was only eleven, his fa­ ther paid shrewd attention to him, ensuring that he would grow up into a good, smart, and honest man. Indeed, this was the point of the famous (apocryphal) story about the young boy cutting down the cherry tree. As told by the colorful hagiographer Parson Weems, whose poetic/mythical biography of Washington sold out edition after edition, the nub of the story was that a son's truth telling is a treasure for a father's heart much more valuable than a cherry tree. 9 As a young man, George copied out in his own handwriting 110 maxims of the moral life codified by sixteenth-century Jesuits for the worldly guidance of French aristocrats. As he had a lifelong love of maxims (and often coined his own, later in life), this task must have pricked his mind. The last of these maxims read as follows: #110 Labour to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial fire called conscience.\n\nWashington's family believed in the idea that all were constantly under God's watchful, benevolent eye. This divine attention-at times harsh, probing, and testing, and sometimes benevolent-he was taught to call Providence. He referred to himself, a recent study suggests, as \"in the hands of a good Providence.\" 1 0\n\nG eorge Wash ington, The Man\n\n-\n\n9\n\nThat hand became almost physically visible in his life when, at the age of twenty-two, he escaped from a very hot battle near what is today Pittsburgh, with four bullet holes in his coat, two horses shot out from under him, and men falling to his right and left; yet he had emerged intact, without a scratch. Even into old age, George Washington recalled those events and thanked Providence. Similar events befell him all through the War of Independence, much to the wonderment, fear, and delight of his fiercely devoted soldiers . Wash­ ington's early trust in a kind Providence was never to fail him, no matter how tested he was by hardship . There is another apocryphal story about a lesson Augustine Wash­ ington taught his son. The father planted cabbage seeds in a plot near their house, in a pattern spelling out G-E-0-R-G-E. He had George water the plot, all unknowing, and much enj oyed the boy's delight when at last the pattern became visible. \"How did that happen ? \" the boy wondered. \"Do you think it was by chance ? \" the father asked him, leaving the boy to muse. This is a great thing, the father concluded, \"which I want you to understand. I want, my son, to introduce you to your true father. \" In Weems's telling, it is the father who is the center of the story, instructing his son's head and heart at the same time. 1 1 When he became a man, Washington's morals seemed visible to others in his countenance and in his bearing. For those who gazed into Washington's face, the grown man's clear eyes flashed with can­ dor and good grace. His nose was long, in an almost straight line from his \"forehead, like the countenance of a Roman Caesar or of Cincinnatus abandoning his plow. The skin of his face was faintly marked by youthful smallpox, as though to add to his face mascu­ line toughness. His natural hair-he did not wear a powdered wig­ betrayed a slight reddishness ( it was sometimes brown, sometimes reddish-brown ) , although in his later years it turned prematurely white. That white hair added dignity and wisdom to his appearance. It also gave substance to the admiring words of his officers, that he had grown gray in the defense of the republic. Here is how Captain Mercer described his young commander:\n\n10\n\n- WAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nA large and straight rather than prominent nose; blue gray pene­ trating eyes which are widely separated and overhung by a heavy brow. His fac e is long rather than broad, with high round cheek bones, and terminates in a good firm chin. He has clear though rather colorless pale skin which burns with the sun. A pleasing and benevolent though commanding countenance, dark brown hair whic h he wears in a cue . . . . His features are regular and placid with all the musc les of his fac e under perfect control, though flexible and expressive of d eep feeling when moved by emotions. 1 2\n\nWashington spoke gravely, others also testify, a little slowly, but with warmth and wit. He treasured parlor conversation as well as dinner conversation and treated them as arts a gentleman ought to enjoy-and help his fellow travelers to enjoy along with him. He had made it one of his rules ever since his teens to try to say no un­ kind or distressing word at mealtime, but only graceful and cheerful things-banter, really, especially with the ladies: #62 Speak not of doleful things in a time of mirth or at the table; speak not of melancholy things as death and wounds, and if others mention them, c hange if you can the discourse . Tell not your dreams, but to your intimate friend.\n\nHe was, by all reports, a considerate host, friend, and compan­ ion. A man's man-and also a lady's man, at the proper time. Ever since he had been a boy, he had tried to show respect to all with whom he engaged in conversation: #1 Every action done in company ought to be done with some sign of respect to those that are present.\n\nAs for his outward bearing, Captain Mercer's eyewitness account describes him as \" straight as an Indian, measuring six feet two\n\nGeorge Wash ington� The Man\n\n-\n\n11\n\ninches in his stockings and weighing 175 pounds.\" At his death, Washington was measured at six feet three and one-half inches, and of course in boots he would have seemed even taller. Since in those days, most men were about five feet six inches or so, and women rather shorter, Washington was easy to pick out in most drawing rooms or even meeting halls. Mercer went on: \" His frame is padded with well-developed muscles, indicating great strength. His bones and joints are large, as are his hands and feet. He is wide shouldered but has not a deep or round chest; is neat waisted, but is broad across the hips and has rather long legs and arms. \" 1 3 The painter Charles Willson Peale left us a story about Washing­ ton's legendary arm strength, based on observing him in the throw­ ing of a long heavy bar, in a game Peale was engaged in at Mount Vernon while waiting to paint Washington's portrait. This was be­ fore the War of Independence: One afternoon, several young gentle men, visitors at Mount Ver­ non, and myself were engaged in pitching the bar, one of the ath­ letic sports common in those times, when suddenly the Colonel appeared among us. He requested to be shown the pegs that marked the bounds of our effort; then, smiling, and without putting off his coat, held out his hand for the missile. No sooner did the heavy iron bar feel the grasp of his mighty hand than it lost the power of gravitation, and whizzed through the air, striking the ground far, very far, beyond our utmost limits. We were indeed amazed, as we stood around all stripped to the buff, with shirt sleeves rolled up, and having thought ourselves very clever fellows, while the Colonel, on retiring, pleasantly observed, \"When you beat my pitch, young gentlemen, I' ll try again. \" 1 4\n\nTHE INNER MAN\n\nOn the inward side, another characteristic of the man was a prudent reserve about his private opinions, personal judgments, and deepest\n\n12\n\n-\n\nWAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nconvictions. He was especially, but for an Anglican not untypically, silent about his religious convictions. Yet, as with most people, this does not imply he did not have any. Like many Anglicans of his class and time, George Washington believed strongly in the sanctity of private opinions and felt it to be rude of one person to inflict his personal views upon others, since strongly held opinions, especially in matters of politics and religion, can swiftly disrupt otherwise am­ icable discussions, at dinner, in the parlor, and at peaceable meetings set aside for business, civic, or purely social matters. With respect to religion, however, there was for Washington even more to his reserve than custom and class. His excellent re­ cent biographer, Joseph Ellis, quipped that Washington was a \"lukewarm Episcopalian and a quasi-deist.\" 1 5 Yet in this context, \"lukewarm\" is not so fatal an epithet; 1 6 for an eighteenth-century Virginia Anglican (and perhaps even today) it is almost redundant. The Anglican \"way\" requires eschewing \"enthusiasm\" and avoid­ ing outward displays of piety in favor of understatement and even taciturnity. Anglican manners recommend the \"middle way,\" that is, a relatively cool, commonsensical, practical way of putting things and, moreover, a way that is not divisive but ain1s for a maximal degree of common ground. One overriding purpose is not to give offense. Another is to keep the peace. A third is to pre­ serve maximal space for shared sentiments. In a gentleman, \"de­ voutness\" would seem showy, even boastful; the truly devout man ought to hide his devotion. In this framework, a gentleman tells his deepest convictions only to the closest and most intimate of friends. Indeed, even with friends-even one's spouse-a gentleman might maintain sober re­ serve, preferring judicious circumlocution and allusion. Washington knew that he would have to proceed carefully step by step, taking care not to narrow his appeal in a time of contro­ versy. He also knew well that religious passions were just then rising along the Virginia frontier (not at all far from Mount Vernon), since by 1750 more and more Baptist and Methodist itinerant preachers\n\nGeorge Wash ington, Th e Man\n\n-\n\n13\n\nwere lighting the fires of evangelicalism in central, southern, and western Virginia. Washington, ever the quiet observer, noted how broad a range of religious passions and convictions were active in American life. Unitarians were regarded by Baptists as hardly Christian at all, be­ cause they did not accept the divinity of Jesus Christ. Presbyterians seemed to Anglicans a bit severe, whereas to Presbyterians Angli­ cans seemed lax, broad-minded, weather-vane-driven. The grave and prosperous Quaker pacifists of Philadelphia-opposed to war and, for that reason, to declaring independence-were not deeply admired by those ardent patrons of independence who were ready for war, such as John Adams and General Washington. In such an environment, Unitarians hardly respected Trinitarians, and evan­ gelical Christians were almost as despairing of Anglicans as of Roman Catholics. There were good reasons why Washington thought it more prudent to avoid a confessional way of speaking of God. A work of art that helped Washington to do that was one of his favorites, Joseph Addison's Cato, a play that Washington not only · frequented many times during his life, but even had performed for his troops at Valley Forge. Addison's text of Cato bore the follow­ ing inscription (from Seneca) as its frontispiece. This text from a Roman pagan philosopher helps us to understand how easily Wash­ ington could put together the ancient Stoic idea of God with his Christian way of thinking: But lo ! here is a spectacle worthy of the regard of God as he con­ templates his works; lo ! here is a contest worthy of God,-a brave man matched against ill-fortune, and doubly so if his also was the challenge. I do not know, I say, what nobler sight the Lord of Heaven could find on earth, should he wish to turn his attention there, than the spectacle of Cato, after his cause had already been shattered more than once, nevertheless standing erect amid the ruins of the commonwealth. 1 7\n\n14\n\n- WAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nGeorge Washington, like other leaders of the country's founding, understood that the new republic faced a critical problem regarding an inherently proper and yet widely acceptable religious language for public use. They remembered one political touchstone of the New Testament, \"Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's\" (Mark 12: 17). From this text, they learned that many matters of government-the whole U.S. Constitution, for instance, setting forth the three branches of government-can be couched in the language of Caesar. There is no need to clothe such matters in religious language. Not at all shirking those duties that individuals (and even na­ tions) owe to God, nonetheless, Washington, like the other Founders, insisted on speaking openly of God. They kept the func­ tions of state and church independent of each other, but they an­ nounced clearly that republics are not likely to survive without lively and healthy religions to invigorate the mores and customs of the people. This sharp difference between the institutional issue (church and state) and the issue of moral ecology (religion and pub­ lic life) confronted them with a novel problem. George Washington was the first to face it, in 1775, as general of the Continental Army. When duties of gratitude and petition require men to speak of God, the problem is how to speak of God in a way that unites-rather than divides-a religiously pluralistic people. Some individual states, which had their own established churches, did not have to confront this problem with the same urgency that the whole new nation did, and Washington first of all. Washington's solution lay in developing a special kind of philo­ sophical language, which used terms derived both from the philoso­ phers and also from the biblical story of creation and the biblical conception of God-a God who is Spirit, and who wishes to be worshiped in spirit and in truth (more on this in Chapter 6 ). Indeed, Washington preferred philosophical words impregnated with bibli­ cal (usually Hebrew) content.\n\nGeorge Wash ington, The Man\n\n-\n\n15\n\nBefore the War of Independence, he had purchased from London a beautifully printed thin Book of Psalms to carry in his coat pocket, and many of its descriptions of the Creator and Divine Architect seeped into his imagery. The psalms of David describe a God who acts in history. Washington and his men publicly prayed that God would act on their behalf, as he had done on behalf of the first Is­ rael. Puritan preachers sometimes referred to America as \"God's second Israel.\" In brief, Washington's writings, as his remarks to the Hebrew Congregation of Savannah illustrate (see the epigraph to this book), show that his vision of God was in good measure that of the He­ brew prophets and the psalmist. There are many direct allusions in George Washington's writings to the Book of Amos, to Proverbs, to Ecclesiastes, and to the Psalms. 1 8 His was a richly informed biblical mind--informed, perhaps, by the Anglican Book of Common Prayer (which is itself saturated with biblical references), which he knew from childhood on. We have already seen that, as he was concerning many other in­ timate matters, George Washington was quite taciturn about his personal religion, even in his private correspondence. In public, he spoke very often and emphatically about religion, referring to it as \"an indispensable support\" for republican government, a \"vital\" support for his armies in the field, and a primary \"duty\" of indi­ viduals and nations alike. He helped to create a public philosophy of American religion, a public language that on the surface com­ bined the strengths of Cicero, Seneca, Aristotle, and other sources of public law with the vigorous manliness of the Hebrew prophets and the psalmist. HOW H E A P P E A R E D TO OT H E R S\n\nAfter first meeting him in 1774, John Adams praised Washington more than once in letters to Abigail, yet not excessively. She was in\n\n16\n\n-\n\nWAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nany case primed to have a good impression of him but did not fi­ nally meet him until 1775, when John was in Philadelphia. Abigail, much to her own surprise, was blown away. She wrote to John: \"You had prepared me to entertain a favorable opinion of him, but I thought the one half was not told me!\" She broke out into lines from John Dryden: Mark his Majestick fabrick! He's a temple Sacred by birth, and built by hands divine. His souls the deity that lodges there. Nor is the pile unworthy of the God. 1 9\n\nTaking into account how acerbic Abigail's pen could be, this swoon quite stands out in her accounts of the men of her time. Moreover, she was not alone in seeing the virtual nimbus that seemed to move with George Washington. Here is his aide George Mercer again, describing the same sorts of features that Abigail dis­ cerned on her first meeting: \"His demeanor [is] at all times com­ posed and dignified. His movements and gestures are graceful, his walk majestic, and he is a splendid horseman. \" 20 And Mrs. Horace Bland, wife of a colonel who was serving with Washington, wrote to a friend of hers: \"Now let me speak of our noble and agreeable commander, for he commands both sexes, one by his excellent skill in military matters, the other by his ability, politeness, and attention.\" Washington was generally busy in the forenoon, but \"from dinner till night he is free for all company. His worthy lady seems to be in perfect felicity when she is by the side of her Old Man as she calls hin1. We often make parties on horseback.\" Then \"General Washington throws off the hero and takes on the chatty, agreeable companion. He can be downright impudent sometimes-such impudence, Fanny, as you and I like.\" 2 1 Despite all this praise, it is well to recall that for nearly a decade of Washington's life the nation was in a life-and-death battle to vvin\n\nGeorge Washington, The Man\n\n-\n\n17\n\nits independence. Its adversary commanded the largest naval power in the world, and its army may also have been the most powerful. By comparison, the Continental Army was puny, ill equipped, virtu­ ally without uniforms, short on boots, and most often hungry, un­ paid, and in large proportions too sick to march or fight. The representatives of Great Britain entertained for many years a quite low opinion of the American foe, and even of their commander. The British diplomat Edward Thornton wrote back to an undersecretary of the British Foreign Office this \"description of the President of the United States\" : His person is tall and sufficiently graceful, his face well-formed, his complexion rather pale, with a mild and philosophic gravity in the expression of it. In his air and manner he displays much natural dignity, in his address he is cold, reserved and even phlegmatic, though without the least appearance of haughtiness and ill nature; it is the effect I imagine of constitutional diffidence.\n\nHazarding this hypothesis, the diplomat gathers his thoughts, then resumes: That caution and circumspection which form so striking and well­ known a feature in his military and indeed in his political character, is [sic] very strongly marked in his countenance: for his eyes retire inward (do you understand me? ) and have nothing of fire, of ani­ mation or openness in their expression. If this circumspection is ac­ companied by discernment and penetration, as I am informed it is, and as I should be inclined to believe from the judicious choice he has generally made of persons to fill public stations, he possesses the two great requisites of a statesman, the faculty of concealing his own sentiments, and of discovering those of other men.\n\nBut now he seems to be praising Washington too much and draws back a little:\n\n18\n\n- WAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nA certain degree of indecision however, a want of vigour and energy may be observed in some of his actions, and are indeed the obvious result of too refined caution. He is a man of great but secret ambi­ tion, and has sometimes, I think condescended to use little arts, and those too very shallow ones, to secure the object of that ambition.\n\nA little more balance now! He is, I am told, indefatigable in business and extremely clear and systematic in the arrangement of it; his time is regularly divided into certain portions, and the business allotted to any one portion rigidly attended to.\n\nBefore settling in for his summation, the diplomat recalls for him­ self the person he is writing to and what he will want to hear-and need to hear. Then he sails in for his summation: Of his private character, I can say very little positive; I have never heard of any truly noble, generous or disinterested action of his; he has very few, who are on intimate and unreserved friendship; and what is worse, he is less beloved in his own state (Virginia) than in any part of the United States. After all, he is a great man; circum­ stances have made him so; but I cannot help thinking that the mis­ conduct of our commanders has given him a principal part of that greatness. It does not resemble (to conclude this description with a simile) that of the mid-day sun, of which we form a magnificent idea from its own irresistible brightness and invigorating heat; but it is that of a setting sun, whose magnitude is increased from the confused and misty atmosphere that surrounds it. 22\n\nWashington did not lack for critics. Yet it is astonishing how many virtues and claims to greatness his critics conceded to the man. The low-level diplomat Edward Thornton, just quoted, no doubt contributed to His Majesty's government's consistent under-\n\nGeorge Washington, The Man\n\n-\n\n19\n\nestimating of their American challenger. Yet even he paid many compliments: \"natural dignity,\" \"caution and circumspection\" (the opposite of \"hothead\" and \"reckless\" ), \"discernment and penetra­ tion,\" \"indefatigible in business and extremely clever and systematic in his arrangement of it,\" and \"after all, a great man.\" Thomas Jef­ ferson, an ideological rival of Washington and a rival for interna­ tional acclaim, nonetheless had wise praise for Washington, even while taking care to point out his lesser educational attainments: His mind was great and powerful, without being of the very first order; his penetration strong, though not as acute as that of a New­ ton, Bacon or Locke; and as far as he saw, no judgment was ever sounder. It was slow in operation, being little aided by invention or imagination, but sure in conclusion . . . . He was incapable of fear, meeting personal dangers with the calmest unconcern. His integrity was most pure, his justice the most inflexible I have ever known . . . . He was indeed, in every sense of the words, a wise, a good, and a great man. 23\n\nIN T H E T H E AT E R OF POW E R\n\nProfessor Edmund S. Morgan has written in The Genius of George Washington that few if any statesmen in all of American history had as deep an understanding as Washington of political power, its mul­ tiple shapes, and its uses. 24 Washington quietly and astutely studied public sentiment, the ways of Congress, the thinking of British gen­ erals and European monarchs, the manners of Indian chiefs and of brave and wise men, and the habits of fur trappers of the frontier and farmers and merchants, and of course the inner passions of his own fighting men. He learned how all such persons think, and what they take to be real, and what they fear, and what attracts them most and moves them to action. He was very near a genius in get­ ting the best out of his own hotly rivalrous cabinet. He had enor­ mous comrnon sense and a wordless instinct for how things actually\n\n20\n\n-\n\nWAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nwork in the real world. He understood the dramatics of gesture, rai­ ment, and dress and paid precise attention to timing and symbolic surroundings. He understood the role of imagination as well as rea­ son in politics, of passion as well as logic. Washington took the whole public for his audience and proved himself an astute and self-effacing teacher of the habits of republi­ can citizenship-at a time when no one had ever experienced a re­ public such as the one Providence had called upon him to lead. In politics as in battle, not without much hesitation, even indecision (which some saw as his chief fault as a commander), he knew-with one or two exceptions-when to advance and when to withdra¥1. Once he had made up his mind on timing and method, he was ir­ revocably decisive. All the while, Washington knew well that the tasks he undertook were too big for him, that he was too unlearned, that he lacked some of the necessary gifts, that the odds were far too steep, that he might embarrass all who depended on his success. He truly, gen­ uinely, feared failure. He came very close to getting his fill of excruciating failure. He could taste the fear of it, it came so close-at Monongahela, on Long Island, at Valley Forge, on the icy Delaware, at the Newburgh meeting. His was not a fake humility. He knew he had many limita­ tions. He knew the task was too immense for him. He trusted in \"a kind Providence.\" If there is one thing faith teaches, it is that every day has trouble sufficient to the day; one need not now fear tomor­ row (Matthew 6: 34 ). Nor need one worry about the harvest, only about the sowing and the tending; the increase depends upon the Lord. That is not so far from being \"in the hands of a good Provi­ dence\" that Washington wrote about. Washington had an ally to whom he often, publicly and privately, gave thanks.\n\nH I S L I F E I N O U T I\"' I N E\n\nB orn to high destinies, he was fash ioned for them by th e hand of nature . . . . His form was noble . . . . On h is front were enthroned the virtues wh ich exalt, and th ose which adorn the human character. So dignified his deportment, no man could approach him but with respect-none was great in his presence. His judgment was always clear, because his r11ind was pure. And seldom, if ever, will a sound under­ standing be met in the company of a corrupt heart. . . . In him were the courage of a soldier, the intrepidity of a chief, the fortitude of a hero. -Gouverneur Morris, December 3 1, 1799 1 _,\n\nA TRAD ITIONAL ANGLICAN FAMILY LIFE\n\nGeorge Washington was born on February 11, 1732 (which, with a change in the calendar during his lifetime, became February 22) . He was born to a moderately wealthy family, landowners in the top tenth of Virginia's families, but far below the prominence and wealth of the elite. 2 His father, Augustine, came from English stock, of a family of Anglican churchmen, military men, and farm­ ers. W hen Augustine's first wife died, and with three children eventually surviving from that marriage (the y oungest and only girl, Jane, died when George ,vas three), he married the \"self­ willed\" young orphan Mary Ball and by her had six children, of 21\n\n22\n\n- WAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nwhom five survived. George was the eldest child of that second marriage. George grew up on the Rappahannock River, across from Freder­ icksburg, in Virginia. A port town that catered to transatlantic ship­ ping, Fredericksburg was a relatively bustling area, so that George was by no means sheltered from the outside world during his youth, that is, except in one regard: He did not get the chance to travel abroad, except for one trip to Barbados to accompany his half brother Lawrence, who was seeking a cure for his virulent tubercu­ losis. Lawrence, fourteen years older, had watched over young George like a second father. The devastating experience of a trip on which he had to watch his revered older brother suffer had hidden within it one great future benefit, of which George was to learn only years later. While in Barbados, George also became ill with small­ pox, and that brief affliction later made him immune from the sin­ gle greatest killer of the War of Independence. (At times, more than half the men in his army lay stricken with it. ) All in all, the trip was an unhappy memory. Not too long after Washington returned on his own, Lawrence was to come home, uncured, to die. It had been intended that George would attend school in En­ gland, following in the footsteps of his father and two half brothers, but to his lifelong regret, his father died when George was only eleven, and it was not to be. Instead, the older boys received their portion of the estate, and Mary Ball Washington was obliged to struggle with what was left while caring for five small children. Young George was now the titular head of the household-and under the watchful, domineering, and possessive eye of his mother. Mary Ball Washington was a strong-vvilled and independent ,voman who quickly focused all her attentions-positive and negative-on her eldest son: Throughout his life, he could never please her or suc­ ceed in her eyes. In fact, as biographer James Thomas Flexner noted, \"Even when he was Commander in Chief, even when he was President, she objected to his occupations, complaining violently that he was ungratefully neglecting his duties to her.\" 3\n\nHis Life in O utline\n\n-\n\n23\n\nPerhaps the fact that she had earlier been an orphan, and was now a widow, left her feeling vulnerable. One of her daily rituals was to find a secluded spot a short way from the house, to which she took a book of religious readings and spent time in reflection. We have no records from George about such moments, but two from her grandchildren, whom she often took with her to her fa­ vorite rock. 4 As the oldest son, George was the one most to bear the expression of her fears and concerns for the future, and to receive her recitation of chores to be done. George had earlier found relief from this constant presence through his half brother Lawrence. Lawrence had been his protec­ tor, teacher, and role model. In fact, it was Lawrence's enrollment as captain in an American regiment, attached to the British regular army, that first got George interested in military matters. And it was due to Lawrence's foray to Cartagena, Colombia, with the British army that Mount Vernon acquired its name-for when Lawrence inherited the property, he christened it Mount Vernon in honor of Admiral Edward Vernon, who had commanded the doomed Carta­ gena expedition. (Admiral Vernon, outfitted with a splendid fleet, had been so certain of victory that he sent home a packet ship with the news in order to have a commemorative medal struck in ad­ vance, but in the jungles surrounding the huge fortress city, carved out of a rock mountain and known as \"Unconquerable Cartagena,\" whole units of his army came down with malaria, and he had to re­ treat, without his much-desired triumph. ) Lawrence's tales of the British army's treatment of the colonials was to stay with George throughout his own interactions with the British. George first intended to join the British navy, but thanks to his mother's complaints, he early turned to surveying instead. Bitterly upset throughout her life that her son, in her opinion, was con­ stantly deserting her and neglecting her, Mary did what she could to keep him closely under her control. But George was able to elude her grasp at times: When he was sixteen, he accompanied a group that was surveying land on the frontier for Lawrence's\n\n24\n\n-\n\nWAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nwealthy neighbor, Lord Fairfax, and from that moment on, the frontier became a huge part of his heart and life. It also became his means of income as a youth, for at seventeen, he became a profes­ sional surveyor of the lands on the other side of the Blue Ridge Mountains. He used what he could save to buy land, both in the wilderness near his lands in Virginia and near the Ohio Valley once he got the chance. It was during this time that George made his aforementioned trip to Barbados to accompany his dying brother, Lawrence. This event, though he was never again to mention it, was the first turning point in his young life. For his brother's death opened up for him a career in the military. Lawrence had been slated to be named Adjutant General of Virginia, the officer who served as a leader and instruc­ tor of Virginia's voluntary militia. Lawrence's death created an opening for which young George decided to fight-and with all the weapons a gentleman could summon. Even though he had no mili­ tary training, only the skills of a true horseman and a knowledge of backwoods life on the frontier-whereas the main role was to train the militiamen in military skills-he called upon influential members of the House of Burgesses, some of whom he knew from his parish and its surroundings, to secure the position for him. .A.lthough Vir­ ginia ended up being divided into four military districts, Washington was still successful and was appointed adjutant of one of the dis­ tricts (the smallest). He thus found himself, at the age of twenty, a major in the Virginia militia. T H E YOUNG M AJOR IN T H E VIR GINIA MILITIA\n\nHaving tested his political muscle for the first time, young George now found himself chosen to become the British envoy to the French army then operating in the areas to the west of Virginia. The so-called Ohio Company had laid claim to half a million acres in this territory, and its officers (his half brother Lawrence had been president before his death) were horrified to learn that the\n\nHis Life in O u tline\n\n- 25\n\nFrench were trying to seize this very land for themselves. Lieu­ tenant Governor Robert Dinwiddie, a member of the Ohio Com­ pany, as well as the highest crown official in Virginia, quickly complained to King George II, who ordered a fort to be built, once an envoy had been sent out to discover the French position. With his wilderness experience surveying in the Shenandoah Valley, as well as his connection with Lord Fairfax, Washington was an ide­ ally situated candidate. This trip in October 1753 and his several return trips, in April 1754, April 1755, and fall 1758, to the wilderness of the Ohio Val­ ley were to have a profound impact on his life and were to become the stuff of legend. Through his experiences on the Monongahela, about which we will go into greater detail in the next chapter, Wash­ ington learned an incalculable-and invaluable-amount about the military, the Indians, the British, and, most important, about the character of men and of Providence. This experience was to shape his beliefs-proving to him without a doubt that an intervening force was at work rather than a simple predestined fate, knowledge that was to sustain him through the rest of his life. Finally, after the last foray into the wilderness, when the British finally succeeded in forcing the French to abandon the land and the fort they had built, Washington again resigned from the army to re­ turn to his life as a gentleman farmer. He was again roundly praised by his fellow men and the legislature; his reputation, both nationally and internationally, certainly well known. Rewarded for his military service with large tracts of land in the Ohio Territory (most of which he simply held for investment purposes) he retired to his Vir­ ginia farm, cultivating the land, purchasing additional property nearby every chance he got (although still in his twenties, he had be­ come a significant landowner, with nearly ten thousand acres of his own), and mentally distilling his experiences in the military. On January 6, 1759, Washington married Martha Dandridge Custis, a wido,v with two small children and a large estate, embrac­ ing some thirty-five thousand acres, lots of slaves, and, unusual for\n\n26\n\n-\n\nWAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nthat time, a great deal of sterling silver. According to James Thomas Flexner: The future Mrs. Washington, being about five feet tall, came up only to her suitor's chest. She was plump, with small hands and feet. Her large eyes, wide brows, and strong, curved nose would have created bold beauty had not timidity imposed a gentle charm. Despite her grand first marriage, her own family background had been modest; she preserved simple manners, uninsistent dignity. She was not given to startling ideas or brilliant talk; her intelligence and imagination ran to relations with other people. Down the long years, when her husband was so often embattled, no man or woman ever wrote of her with enmity. She proffered appreciative friendship to all. Washington was to find her such a companion as he had dreamed of when a boy under the whiplash of his termagant mother: \" A quiet wife, a quiet soul. \" 5\n\nWashington gladly took on the responsibility of stepfather to Martha's two small children: John Parke Custis, known as Jackie, and Martha Parke Custis, known as Patsy. They were only four and two, respectively, when Washington married their mother. Unfortunately, Patsy was found to be epileptic at twelve, dying after a seizure at age seventeen, in 1773. Both children had already been surrounded with great affection by their mother, and now Martha became even more possessive of Jackie, spoiling him even more than before. As for George, he loved having Martha at his side, and they shared every as­ pect of each other's lives. In later years, he often called her to join him for the long months at his military headquarters during the War of In­ dependence. They were soul mates. Abigail Adams once wrote, while serving with them as the vice president's wife during Washington's presidency, that their affability, dignity, and ease together and with others touched her in human terms far more than she had ever felt with the royal family in Britain, when John had been ambassador to London.\n\nHis Life in O utline\n\n- 27\n\nTHE FAR MER AND THE CONG RESSMAN\n\nMeanwhile, for sixteen years, Washington kept himself busy as a planter and businessman. He was an active and involved farmer, overseeing his land in Virginia regularly, reading agricultural manu­ als, experimenting with planting and fertilizing, trying his hand at tending grapes for wine, even inventing a plow that automatically dropped the seeds into the furrows. He loved learning about the land and about the implements of everyday work. He loved the sci­ ence and the art of it. Eventually, he decided that tobacco was a poor crop and a worse business proposition, and by 1766, he was concentrating solely on wheat and corn, which could be sold locally. This choice allowed him to end his dependence on England, as he no longer had to rely on selling his tobacco crop abroad, and he turned his interests inward, to American goods. Most wealthy Americans made large household purchases from England, particu­ larly the tobacco farmers, who often ended up in deep debt to their British dealers. Soon, his main business in England was simply to pay off his debt, and only sometimes to order household goods he · could not yet obtain in America. Eventually, Washington also built the large whiskey still men­ tioned in Chapter 1 and was quite pleased with the blends he devel­ oped and the profits obtained. His mind was always restless for new arts to learn and new businesses to create. During-this time, Washington was also a member of the House of Burgesses and a vestryman of Truro Parish, among other neighbor­ hood offices. He was elected vestryman in 17 62, his active service continuing basically until 1775. He did not officially resign, though, until February 1784. His duties as vestryn1an could be quite heavy; he and his colleagues were responsible for repairs to the church, ob­ taining the salary for the preacher, instructing the youth, and caring for the poor. There were at times many details to take care of. In the mid-1760s, the colonists and the British crown began to quarrel openly over taxation: England tried to levy one tax after\n\n28\n\n-\n\nWAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nanother, in part to pay the costs of sending troops to protect the colonies from the French, but the colonists replied that was unfair and illegal without their having representation in Parliament. Washington was no firebrand, but he did follow closely the ban on importing British goods (which he judged was good policy for the Americans and for the local economy). As early as April 1769, he began to consider the eventual necessity of armed rebellion. He was reticent on this subject, but his general sobriety and good sense made him attractive to the property owners of Virginia, who kept electing him to the House of Burgesses. That House in turn, when it elected seven delegates to the First Continental Congress, scheduled to meet in Philadelphia in the fall of 1774, gave Washington the third highest vote. The purpose of the convention was to demon­ strate to the king that all the colonists were united in a desire for peace; they swore their loyalty to him as the source of colonial power, as distinct from the Parliament, which had nothing to do with the legal status of the colonies. The convention's aim was to avert war. During the official sessions in Philadelphia in September and Oc­ tober, Washington largely remained silent, allowing the others present to make the arguments and debates. He was a focal point of much interest in the populace and the other delegates, nonetheless, since his military reputation had preceded him, and most delegates were already fearful about the possibility of war. COMMAND ER IN CHIEF\n\nThen, during the Second Continental Congress in May 1775, after the opening Battles of Lexington and Concord and the taking of the British fort at Ticonderoga on May 10, Washington chose to wear his military uniform. Yet, when rumors began to fly that he might be appointed not just commander in chief of the Virginia forces, but actually commander in chief of a continental army, he was horrified. He had never been in charge of large armies in the field. He was un-\n\nHis Life in O utline\n\n-\n\n29\n\ncertain about how to command large maneuvers and give appropri­ ate orders. He urged some of his friends to stan1p out the movement to draft him. Despite his best efforts, he was elected unanimously. He accepted on June 16, 1775, declaring himself unequal to the command. After refusing to take a salary, he promised to keep \"an exact account\" of the expenses for which he could be reimbursed. At this time, Washington was the only one on the continent with sword in hand since no \"Continental Army\" yet existed-and to British eyes clearly stamped \"traitor\" and violator of his oaths to the king. For the colonists, independence now rested on his shoul­ ders. Thus, on June 23, 1775, Washington set out to join the forces in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they were already encircling Britain's army in Boston. Since the two opposing forces were at a standstill, basically locked into a long-term siege, his first battle (see Chapter 4) did not come until 1nuch later, on March 5, 1776. During the previous night, he had built fortifications on Dorchester Neck, a hill above Boston, and pulled many cannons into place. A fierce storm that day prevented both Britain's massive attack on Washington's position and Washing­ ton's planned counterattack on Boston, which was perhaps providen­ tial, for the colonial army discovered later that it could never have breached Boston's impressive fortifications. Days later, the British de­ cided it was foolish to remain in range of the newly positioned colo­ nial artillery and decided to abandon Boston. By March 17, they were completely gone. Washington had scored an early victory. Unfortunately, the rest of the war did not prove to be so easy, nor the British so quick to run. The long war ended up being fought as a campaign of retreats by the Continental Army-basically, a defen­ sive war, in which Washington mostly focused on escaping from the British maneuvers and only occasionally made his own attacks. One of the most difficult maneuvers in warfare is to keep up the morale of young men during retreat after retreat, not to n1ention humiliat­ ing losses. So Washington's campaign required patience, steadiness, determination-and a firm belief that the fledgling nation was \"in\n\n30\n\n- WAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nthe hands of a good Providence.\" Proportionately, the Americans lost more lives per population than in any war the nation was later to fight. The decisive battle, that of Yorktown, did not conclude with General Cornwallis's surrender until October 19, 178 1. The \"interim\" peace treaty itself (and even then the actual terms of peace were not yet agreed upon) was finally signed on November 30, 1782-the official text of this pact did not even reach the Sec­ ond Continental Congress until the next year, on March 12, 1783. During this time, Washington offered much evidence of his beliefs in religion and its importance, by taking very seriously his duties as leader and role model, even teacher and, in the idiom of the day, \"nursing father.\" (The last was a biblical phrase, used of magistrates who nourished their people; it appeared often in tributes to Wash­ ington after his death. )6 As he had as leader of the Virginia forces earlier in life, he requested and put in position chaplains throughout his army and had the government pay their salaries-eventually one chaplain per regiment, paid a monthly salary of forty dollars. In ad­ dition, he issued many orders commanding (\"enjoining\" ) his troops to pray; to attend divine services; to observe days of thanksgiving; to spend days in fasting, humiliation, and prayer; and to respect the free exercise of religion and conscience among the citizens of the land. Despite urgings from the Congress to live off the land, using force where necessary, to save expenses for the Congress, he ordered his troops to go hungry rather than force citizens to part with vict­ uals at bayonet point. As John Adams explained, Washington pre­ ferred his troops to suffer a little but win the loyalty of their fellow citizens, while allowing the British and the Hessians to reap hatred for using their bayonets to extract food from civilians. Washington grasped intuitively that if his men lost the people, they would lose the war, and if his men lost the war, they would never be paid and, in fact, might be hanged in the bargain. So far did he go in trying to win the esteem of the citizenry that he forbade his troops under pain of death to utter blasphemies, even profanity. They must live among the people, he explained, and not offend them. They must conduct\n\nHis Life in O utline\n\n-\n\n31\n\nthemselves as Christian soldiers, because the people demanded it. s They must demonstrate the moral character of the American cause, to make it worthy both of the people in whose name they fought and the Providence whose favor they implored. Washington also endured many painful defeats, such as the loss of Philadelphia to the British in the fall of 1777 and, more painfully, the duplicitous behavior of several of his generals during the so­ called Conway Cabal, which tried to undermine Washington before the Congress in order to replace him in command. That plot back­ fired spectacularly. But what pained Washington most was the fla­ grant treason of Benedict Arnold, one of the greatest military commanders on either side and a particular favorite of Washington's. Washington called it a providential design that Arnold's plan was discovered just in time, in late September 1780, right before Arnold turned over to the British free entry into one of the most important forts on the Hudson River. As Washington wrote: \"Happily the treason has been timely discovered to prevent the fatal misfortune. The providential train of circumstances which led to it affords the most convincing proof that the Liberties of America are the object of divine Protection.\" 8 Thereafter, Washington was less trusting and directed some per­ sons closest to him to bring their reports confidentially and only to him. Worst of all, for almost eight years, month after long month, his most pressing concern throughout the war was getting the Con­ tinental -Congress to pull from the states the money they had pledged for the war, and in which most were in deep arrears. This delinquency left his beloved soldiers in desperate straits, unable to send money home to their needy families, unable to obtain medical care for their own wounds and wasting illnesses, hungry, meanly clad, short of ammunition, and often bleeding in the snow for want of boots. The whole nation teetered on the edge of bankruptcy from the long war. Until the very end, it was unclear who would be forced to quit first, the colonies or the faraway seat of empire. The war was more than either could afford.\n\n32\n\n- WAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nThere were, of course, several highs for General Washington as well: the nearly miraculous deliverance of his army from the Battle of Long Island in August 1776 (also discussed in detail in Chapter 4 ); his resounding victory at the Battle of Trenton against the British-hired Hessians on Christmas Day 1776, with the follow-up surprise attack on Princeton a week later; his introduction to, and then close friendship with (as if father-to-son), the Marquis de Lafayette, who served as a trusted aide and confidante; France's de­ cision both to recognize the independence of the United States, which Washington learned of in early May 1778 (and its previous decision to discreetly send supplies and munitions to the American army), and, finally, to join the war on the American side, with four French regiments arriving on July 10, 1780; and the arrival offshore of a great French fleet just in time to close the trap on the British and help secure the final victory at the Battle of Yorktown on Octo­ ber 19, 1781. In a glorious scene, hugely satisfying for Washington, an entire British army surrendered en masse to his troops. This grand blow, although it did not end the war, and the skirmishes con­ tinued, clearly signaled the beginning of the end, which came in 1783. After seven long years, Washington would finally be able to return to Mount Vernon and rest under \"his vine and fig tree\"-to employ here, as he often did, one of his favorite biblical sayings. First, though, just to survive-and to avoid hanging by the British-Washington had to demonstrate day after day the type of man he was: the indispensable n1an who was nonetheless modest and circumspect. As the country roiled in the throes of political cri­ sis while the war drew to a close, as the proud individual states struggled to unite under one national government, financiers and creditors worried about huge and unfunded debts. A bruised and unpaid army, at any moment liable to flare into rebellion, might all too easily be led into seizing povver and so satisfy the basic needs of its soldiers for at least some recompense. To say the least, the future of the United States was most uncertain. In fact, many influential patriots became convinced that the United States now needed for its\n\nHis Life in O u tline\n\n-\n\n33\n\nown survival a strong, one-man government, at least for a tempo­ rary period. TU RNING AWAY F ROM POWER\n\nIn fact, in May 1782, Washington received a letter from one of his colonels, Lewis Nicola, urging him to become king. Washington was shocked and horrified. He replied, With a mixture of great surprise and astonishment I have read with attention the Sentiments you have submitted to my perusal. Be as­ sured Sir, no occurrence in the course of the War, has given me more painful sensations than your information of there being such ideas existing in the Army as you have expressed, and I must view with abhorrence, and reprehend with severity. For the present, the com­ municatn. [sic] of them will rest in my own bosom, unless some fur­ ther agitation of the matter, shall make a disclosure necessary. I am much at a loss to conceive what part of my conduct could have given encouragement to an address which to me seems big with the greatest mischiefs that can befall my Country. If I am not deceived in the knowledge of myself, you could not have found a person to whom your schemes are more disagreeable. 9\n\nWashington turned aside from the ultimate temptation set before him. A little later, he had to go a step further, putting himself on the line to quell a possible coup by the army, of which word had been brought to him. Appearing by surprise at a meeting of officers on March 15, 1783, held specifically to discuss getting long-delayed justice for the suffering troops, Washington quashed the potential civil discord with a carefully calculated use of theater. He spoke peremptorily and clearly, forbidding his men from throwing away everything for which they had so long sacrificed. Then after his speech, fumbling for eyeglasses to read a letter from a congressman, he excused himself by saying that he had \"grown gray in your service\n\n34\n\n-\n\nWAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\nand now find myself growing blind.\" 1 0 He quelled the mutiny, as many of his officers ended up in tears at his words. As Thomas Jefferson was later to remark, \"The moderation and virtue of a single character probably prevented this Revolution from being closed, as most others have been, by a subversion of that lib­ erty it was intended to establish.\" 1 1 Crisis averted, Washington could return to his favorite of all refuges, Mount Vernon, and finally retire from public life. As he wrote to his friend and former colleague, Major General Henry Knox, soon after retiring, in words reminiscent of Christian in John Bunyan's Pilgrim Js Progress: I feel now, however, as I conceive a wearied Traveller must do, who, after treading many a painful step, with a heavy burden on his shoulders, is eased of the latter, having reached the Goal to which all the former were directed; and from his House top is looking back, and tracing with a grateful eye the Meanders by which he es­ caped the quicksands and Mires which lay in his way; and into which none but the All-powerful guide, and great disposer of human Events could have prevented his falling. 1 2\n\nOf course, a man such as Washington was not the type to truly retire. He left public life, but he did not leave the working world. He quickly reestablished his hardworking schedule of tending his lands and experimenting in agriculture. He also ended up as a prodigious host, as everyone flocked to Mount Vernon to be near the great man, especially artists, forcing Washington to sit through hours of being stared at, sketched, drawn, and painted. Though he hated being the object of their interest, Washington believed strongly that \"to encourage Literature and the Arts, is a duty which every good Citizen owes to his Country,\" 1 3 and so, as in everything else, he felt strongly his responsibility to others. This responsibility especially included family, and Mount Vernon found itself once again filled with the laughter of little children.\n\nHis Life in O utline\n\n-\n\n35\n\nUpon stepson Jackie's early death, the Washingtons adopted his two youngest children, George Washington Parke Custis and Eleanor Parke Custis (Nelly). Despite Washington's fairly grim financial situation after the war-he lost a great deal of money during the hostilities by paying many things out of his own pocket when Congress could not, by ac­ cepting as a duty the new continental currency that in reality was not worth much, and by refusing a salary and receiving his promised reimbursement for expenses in nothing more than certifi­ cates of indebtedness-he still never accepted any public help for doing his necessary entertaining of foreign and other official visi­ tors. But Washington did enjoy the gratitude he was given from all sides. Even that, of course, he might have been willing to forgo, if Providence had withheld it. He made it his practice to steel himself (as more than once his letters advised others to do) for whatever Providence might have in store. In this case, it was a very happy pe­ riod for the Washingtons, perhaps the happiest of their lives. They had each other, and they lived in peace on the spot above the Po­ tomac that they loved the best in all the world. This idyll, all too quickly, came to an end in the spring of 1787, when the Constitu­ tional Convention convened in Philadelphia. Though deeply wor­ ried about blotching his own unsullied reputation if he got involved in the messiness of congressional debate, for which he felt himself ill suited, and of which his experiences during the war left him with a sour taste, Washington at last decided that he simply must risk his entire lifetime reputation once again, lest everything he had sacri­ ficed so much for during the war come to naught. He soon was elected president of the convention, and his personal prestige kept the assemblage on even keel, as his eminence as focal point of the war brought disparate delegates together. The compromises neces­ sary to crafting the Constitution most likely would never have oc­ curred apart from his influence, and the confidence of the people in the convention's proceedings, especially the confidence of his beloved veterans, would not have been nearly as high. On September 17,\n\n36\n\n- WAS H I N G T O N ' S G O D\n\n1787, the twelve present states (Rhode Island had boycotted the convention) unanimously voted to accept the draft constitution. The debate over ratification began, and Washington eagerly read all the pamphlets that were then being quickly produced to argue pro and con. Although initially hesitant over the draft constitution, believing it not perfect, his reading and reflection led him to whole­ heartedly endorse it. Yet he did not do so publicly. In public, he maintained silence, worried about the impact of any meddling by someone of his stature. He finally heard the result he had been wait­ ing for in late June 1788, when news came to Mount Vernon of states nine and ten voting to ratify. The goal was met; the measure had received the approval of the people. The people had their Con­ stitution-and their nation. SHOULD H E ACCE P T T H E P R ESID ENCY ?\n\nThe next challenge was now staring Washington in the face-the presidency. How he dreaded that. He had already sacrificed so much for his country. Must he again push his personal life aside? And for what? For the arguments, rivalries, divisions, and pure politics of a government office? Especially the highest office? Besides, he was a general, a military man. On February 4, 1789, Washington was picked as president by the unanimous vote of the Electoral College. Not surprisingly, though, there was yet another delay: The vote needed to be counted in front of both houses of Congress and thus formally ratified. It took over a month to bring every delegate from the distant states to form a quorum, and so it was not until April 14 that Washington was fi­ nally and officially told of his election. Once again, he headed north to an unknown future. And on April 30, 1789, wearing a rare suit made of American-woven cloth, and speaking passionately about religion and Providence, he gave his inaugural address to a joint meeting of both houses of Congress.

Virtually all of the decisions that Washington made during these days became tradition-the unwritten law of the land. He also assembled around him a very talented group to be his heads of the great departments. Henry Knox remained as Secretary of War; John Jay, by his own choice, switched from Secretary of For­ eign Affairs (under the \"Articles of Confederation\" government) to chief justice of the Supreme Court; Edmund Randolph became At­ torney General; Alexander Hamilton became Secretary of Treasury; and Thomas Jefferson became Secretary of State (though he delayed his acceptance for months). With a minimum of conflict and strife, our government had been established. Few, if any, presidents in our history turned out to be better than Washington in getting these many rivals "
