Perrin, p. 458\n\nName: Garrett DAVIS\n\n_________________________________________\n\nGARRETT DAVIS.1 Among the list of the illustrious dead of Kentucky, no name has passed into history, bearing with it greater honors as a statesman, a patriot, and an honest and faithful servant of the cause of liberty, the Union and his State, than the lamented Garrett Davis. Living, as he did, from the early morn until the eventide of the nineteenth century, at a time when the nation most needed men of stalwart principle and sterling integrity, Garrett Davis filled the busy years of his faithful life full of noble deeds and heroic, unfaltering labor for the nation's good, and that of his native State, and fearlessly battled for what, in his unprejudiced mind, seemed right. The following brief statement of facts concerning his useful and eventful life, are gleaned from a published volume of Memorial Addresses on his Life and Character, delivered in the Senate and House of Representatives of the Forty-second Congress of the United States, Dec. 18, 1872, upon which occasion eulogies were delivered by Senators Stevenson of Kentucky, Cameron of Pennsylvania, Thurman of Ohio, Sumner of Massachusetts, Bayard of Delaware, Trainbull of Illinois, and many other noted statesmen. Garrett Davis was a native of Kentucky; he was born at Mount Sterling, Sept. 10, 1801. His father and mother emigrated from Montgomery Co., Maryland, to the county of the same name in Kentucky. His mother was a Miss Garrett-a family widely known in Maryland, and it was from her family that he derived his baptismal name. His father was a man of marked character; to energy and industry he added strong will and great personal popularity. He was for many years the Sheriff of his adopted county, and several times represented his district in the lower branches of the General Assembly of Kentucky. Garrett Davis was one of three brothers. The brilliant talents of two of them, also long since departed this life, are still remembered in Kentucky. Garrett enjoyed the advantages of what is known in Kentucky as a common school education. His early years were, however, fraught with a constant study of books, and he thus acquired a ,good English education, and a practical knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages; at an early age he determined to study law, and with a view of gaining practical knowledge, he sought and obtained employment as a deputy in the Circuit Court Clerk's office of Montgomery County. In 1823, he removed to Bourbon County, where he continued to prosecute his legal studies, and where he occupied a clerical position similar to that held in Montgomery County. About the year 1824, he commenced the practice of his profession in Paris, and to it be consecrated the earlier years of his life with enthusiastic devotion. His first wife was the daughter of Robert Trimble, a distinguished Jurist, who became subsequently a Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States. His second wife was a Mrs. Elliott, widow of a prominent lawver, also of Paris. Mr. Davis was an assiduous law student, and his industry received its reward. His business rapidly increased, and he soon rose to a high position at a bar which then numbered some of the most eminent lawyers of the Commonwealth. He regarded the law as the noblest science of intellectual triumph, and loved the administration of justice. All who have encountered him as an opponent in the trial of an important cause, will bear willing testimony to his high qualities as an able and strong lawyer. His last argument but one, in the Supreme Court of the United States, in the reported case of Missouri vs. Kentucky, is a lasting memorial of his legal learning and professional power. Mr. Davis always took an active and prominent part in the political contests of Kentucky, from his earliest manhood--always an ardent Whig, and frequently the selected standard-bearer of his party. In its most excited struggles, his clarion voice rang throughout this Commonwealth in defense of the principles of that patriotic and gallant organization. He was the trusted and true friend of Henry Clay, and enjoyed to a pre-eminent degree his confidence and regard. He represented Bourbon County in the lower branch of the General Assembly of Kentucky for many years. Always conservative in his views, he took a prominent and successful part in shaping the legislation of the State. For eight consecutive years he was chosen over able and distinguished competitors by the electors of the Ashland district, their Representative to the House of Representatives of the United States, and then voluntarily retired. The debates of that body during that period attests his power and strength as a ready and skillful debater. He was nominated as Lieutenant Governor on the Gubernatorial ticket with John J. Crittenden, but at his earnest request was excused by the convention. In 1861, amid perils and dangers of a revolutionary struggle, he was elected as an old line Union Whig, to succeed John C. Breckinridge in the United States Senate. He was the strongest opponent of secession, and at the period of his election, an earnest advocate of the rigid prosecution of the war to restore the Union. The result of the war, so far as it resulted in the overthrow of the rebellion, was as agreeable to him as to any other union man. But the changes in the form of government, the constitutional amendments, the acts of reconstruction, and other governmental acts which, by the dominant party, were deemed necessary in order to make the Government conform to the altered condition of things, were very repulsive to him, and he opposed them bravely and earnestly, though sustained by a hopeless minority. In 1867, he was re-elected to the United States Senate, a proud tribute to his fidelity and zeal in upholding the honor and guarding the interest of his State. For twelve years he occupied his seat in the Senate. Constitutional questions, novel and startling in their character, were during his time discussed and adopted, and Garrett Davis was never silent when duty prompted him to speak, and he was never known to quail before the power of an overwhelming political majority, and amid the bitterest party contests of the past, his honesty was never impeached or his spotless purity of character ever questioned. With him as a Representative, the conscientious discharge of his duty was paramount to every other consideration. His actions were prompted by conviction, and his convictions were the creations of a well-ordered mind, greatly strengthened by a pure and manly spirit, and throughout life he maintained the same elevated standard. In the death of this truly great and good man, Kentucky lost one of its most illustrious sons, his country, one of its purest and ablest statesmen. Such a man was Garrett Davis, and what higher praise could human statesmanship deserve? He died at his home in Paris, upon the 22d of September, 1872, and all that was mortal of the beloved Kentucky statesman rests beneath the blue grass sod of Bourbon County, in the Paris cemetery.\n\nSources\n\n1.

The mother of our subject was Mary, daughter of James McClintock, a native of the Emerald Isle. In 1843, our subject began learning the cabinet-maker's trade with J. P. Kern, and continued until he had completed his trade. In 1848, he began business in this town, in the furniture and undertaking line, and has since continued. June 22, 1851, he formed a matrimonial alliance with Helena, daughter of Jacob and Julia (Young) Miller, and by her had eight children, five living : James K., Nellie, George M., Owen L. and Rudolph. Mr Davis is a member of the Presbyterian Church and Elder of same. Thomas Davis, the grandrather of our subject, lived for sometime at Ruddel's Fort, upon his first coming to Kentucky, he married Sarah Ruddell, who died at the age of ninety-seven, in Pike County, Mo., where he removed in 1825; eight children were born to him, of whom was George M., the father of our subject. George M. served in the war of 1812, after which he came to Paris, and engaged as a gunsmith and remained until his death, which occured in 1833, of cholerra; of the children born to him were: Sallie, who died, aged nineteen; Margaret, wife. of W. W. Mitchell; James T. and George M , of Paris; Mary, wife of James Ingels, and Andrew, who died, aged twenty-five.\n\nGEORGE WILLIAM DAVIS 1827-1920:\n\nThe following sketch written by Mrs. Eleanor Davis Swearingen Rice and Mrs. Francis Jacobs Check, Jr. was published in The Kentuckian-Citizen June 1, 1943.\n\nGeorge William Davis was born February 26, 1827 in Paris. A representative sent to interview Mr. Davis, as a pioneer in the undertaking profession in Kentucky and one of the oldest active undertakers in America, published an interesting article in \"Crane and Breed Quality Talks,\" in June 1914. From this article much information has been obtained.\n\nIn 1843, at the age of sixteen, George Davis went to work in a cabinet shop owned by \"Boss\" Jesse T. Kern, where coffins were made. In a period of five years, he assisted in making several hundred coffins. One of which was made for a woman weighing three hundred and fifty pounds, and one for a man who was six feet eleven and one-half inches tall in his stocking feet and whose brother was six feet, eight inches.\n\nThe largest funeral in which Mr. Davis ever assisted was the burial of three Bourbon County soldiers of the Mexican War of 1847. At the close of the War a company from the county went to Mexico and brought home their dead.\n\nDuring the cholera epidemic the disease was at its worst stage in Paris and vicinity in the months of July and August 1849, and as many as twenty-one deaths occurred in twenty-four hours. It was necessary to call in carpenters to assist in making caskets.\n\nIn January 1848 Mr. Davis and his cousin, William T. Davis, purchased the undertaking and furniture establishment from Mr. Kern, including in the transaction tools, supplies, stock, \"good will,\" and a hearse valued at two hundred and fifty dollars. This may be the one he speaks of \"a little hearse, with shafts, for one horse which I as driver used in delivering coffins in town and country.\" The firm later possessed the first two-horse hearse in Bourbon County.\n\nIn July 1848 George W. Davis bought his partner's interest and reorganized it with six workmen in his employ. He served in many instances as minister, singer and undertaker, as well as grave-filler. On many occasions due to the panic of the populace, he was the only person present at the burial. His father died of the cholera, as did Mr. Kern. He himself was stricken at one time but soon recovered enough to carry on his business. This he did with an ever present spirit of public zeal, which quality in his make-up was uppermost during his life.\n\nOn the death of his eldest son, Thomas, another son, George Ruddell Davis, carried on his father's work. Shortly thereafter a third son, Rudolph, was added to the force, and still later the grandson, Ireland Davis.\n\nIn 1913 Mr. Davis, advancing in years, disposed of the furniture business and moved to the old Presbyterian Church building. Thus the firm returned to its original business as begun in 1843.\n\nHe was a faithful member of the Presbyterian Church for seventy-two years. \"Mr. George W. Davis is the oldest living member, being in the eighty-fourth year of his age. He united with the church in 1848 and in 1855 was made a deacon. Ten years later, Mr. Davis was called as an Elder and has ever since been a devout and constant (p. 34) member.\" -Lexington Herald Nov. 13, 1910.
