It was marred, however, when he earned the dubious distinction of being the first man to be expelled from the U.S. Senate... In 1796 he presided over the constitutional convention that transformed part of the Territory into the State of Tennessee. He was elected as one of its first U.S. Senators (1796-97). During this period, Blount's affairs took a sharp turn for the worse. In 1797 his speculations in western lands led him into serious financial difficulties. That same year, he also apparently concocted a plan involving use of Indians, frontiersmen, and British naval forces to conquer for Britain the Spanish provinces of Florida and Louisiana. A letter he wrote alluding to the plan fell into the hands of President Adams, who turned it over to the Senate on July 3, 1797. Five days later, that body voted 25 to 1 to expel Blount. The House impeached him, but the Senate dropped the charges in 1799 on the grounds that no further action could be taken beyond his dismissal. The episode did not hamper Blount's career in Tennessee. In 1798 he was elected to the senate and rose to the speakership. He died two years later in Knoxville in his early fifties. He is buried there in the cemetery of the First Presbyterian Church.\n\nWORKS\n\nBroadside. Territory of the United States, South of the River Ohio.

Letter from William Few, a signer of the Constitution, to Edward Telfair, who served several terms as Georgia's governor. In the letter, Few condemns the importation of black slaves into Georgia as a ploy to increase the state's congressional representation. Few writes, \"Is there one person of understanding & reflection among you who will not admit that every confederation of justice, humanity, and safety, forbids that any more Negroes should be brought into your state, and yet it is well known that the avarice of your citizens, and the rage for acquiring that property has broke through all legal restrictions, and in violation of law and every principle of policy and expediency they are carrying on that diabolical and injurious traffic, and hastening those evils in their nature most dreadful, which seems to demand every exertion to retard or prevent it. Trust not on your Eastern friends for aid, if you do not enforce righteous measures for your own safety; they will laugh at your calamity and seek for profit by your misfortunes. Already they begin to resist that principle in the Constitution which admits the Negroes of the Southern States to increase the number of Representatives in the Congress of the United States. A motion has been brought forward in the Legislature of Massachusetts to instruct their Members of the Senate ... to move for an amendment ... so as to apportion the number of Representatives according to the number of free men in the United States.\"\n\n[Letter] 1791 Jan. 15, Philadelphia [to] Governor Edward Telfair, Augusta. 1791. 4 pp. /leaves. This is a letter dated January 15, 1791 from William Few, a Senator from Georgia, to Governor Edward Telfair (Governor of Georgia, 1786-1787 and 1790-1793) respecting the Treaty of New York, which was signed on August 7, 1790 by representatives of the U.S. and the Creek Nation, including U.S. Secretary of War Henry Knox and Creek leader Alexander McGillivray. Few writes that the Assembly of Georgia did not approve of the Treaty of New York, which undermined the treaties that Georgia had already signed with the Creeks. He notes that most people in Georgia disapproved of the treaty as well. Few discusses the treaty only briefly and devotes the rest of his letter to a discussion of the debate over state versus federal authority.\n\nAn Autobiography of Colonel W[illia]m Few of Georgia, to [a member] of his family in New York. 1748-1816? 27 pp. /leaves.

By the argument it contains against a particular Providence, though you allow a general Providence, you strike at the foundations of all religion. For without the belief of a Providence, that takes cognizance of, guards, and guides, and may favor particular persons, there is no motive to worship a Deity, to fear his displeasure, or to pray for his protection. I will not enter into any discussion of your principles, though you seem to desire it. At present I shall only give you my opinion, that, though your reasonings are subtile and may prevail with some readers, you will not succeed so as to change the general sentiments of mankind on that subject, and the consequence of printing this piece will be, a great deal of odium drawn upon yourself, mischief to you, and no benefit to others. He that spits against the wind, spits in his own face.\n\nBut, were you to succeed, do you imagine any good would be done by it? You yourself may find it easy to live a virtuous life, without the assistance afforded by religion; you having a clear perception of the advantages of virtue, and the disadvantages of vice, and possessing a strength of resolution sufficient to enable you to resist common temptations. But think how great a portion of mankind consists of weak and ignorant men and women, and of inexperienced, inconsiderate youth of both sexes, who have need of the motives of religion to restrain them from vice, to support their virtue, and retain them in the practice of it till it becomes habitual, which is the great point for its security. And perhaps you are indebted to her originally, that is, to your religious education, for the habits of virtue upon which you now justly value yourself. You might easily display your excellent talents of reasoning upon a less hazardous subject, and thereby obtain a rank with our most distinguished authors. For among us it is not necessary, as among the Hottentots, that a youth, to be raised into the company of men, should prove his manhood by beating his mother.\n\nI would advise you, therefore, not to attempt unchaining the tiger, but to burn this piece before it is seen by any other person; whereby you will save yourself a great deal of mortification by the enemies it may raise against you, and perhaps a good deal of regret and repentance. If men are so wicked with religion, what would they be if without it. I intend this letter itself as a proof of my friendship, and therefore add no professions to it; but subscribe simply yours,\n\nB. Franklin\n\nDavid Barton.

Thus his mind rose from the visible to the invisible; and he found intensest pleasure in studies higher and deeper than all speculation. His Bible exhibits on its margin the care with which he perused it. Among his autographs is an abstract of the Apocalypse--and notes in his hand were seen on the margin of \"Paley's Evidences.\" With these readings he now united the habit of daily prayer, in which exercise of faith and love, the Lord's prayer was always a part. The renewing influences of early pious instruction and habit appear to have returned in all their force on his truest sensibilities, quickened by the infidelity shown in the action of the political world, and in the opinions and theories he had opposed, as subversive of social order. \"War,\" he remarked, on one occasion, \"by the influence of the humane principles of Christianity had been stripped of half its horrors. The French renounce Christianity, and they relapse into barbarism. War resumes the same hideous form which it wore in the ages of Gothic and Roman violence.\" It was the tendency to infidelity he saw so rife that led him often to declare in the social circle his estimate of Christian truth.\n\n\"I have examined carefully,\" he said to a friend from his boyhood, \"the evidence of the Christian religion; and, if I was sitting as a juror upon its authenticity, I should unhesitatingly give my verdict in its favor.\"* To another person, he observed, \"I have studied it, and I can prove its truth as clearly as any proposition ever submitted to the mind of man.\"\n\n* Reminiscences of General Morton.

Our Fathers found in this the best refuge in times of danger and distress, and the surest means to obtain divine protection and aid. In seasons of adversity it is unquestionably a privilege to supplicate the favor of God, when he has assured us that he will be enquired of, for the bestowment of temporal as well as spiritual blessings; and when we consider that we are but too prone to forget our Heavenly Benefactor in the multitude of his benefits, it is no less salutary that we should in times of prosperity humble ourselves before the Lord, that a sense of our dependence on his Providence may be maintained and cherished in our minds.--If humiliation and prayer be the duty and the privilege of individuals, it can be no less the duty of communities to unite in these acts of religious worship: for all the members of a community have a common interest in its prosperity and happiness.\n\nFor these reasons and in compliance with the constant and useful custom of our forefathers, I do by and with the advice of the Council, Appoint Thursday the seventh day of April next, to be observed as a day of public humiliation, fasting and prayer, throughout this state, and I do earnestly recommend to all religious societies of every denomination, that for this purpose they assemble together on that day at their usual places of public worship.--Let us humble ourselves before the Lord under a sense of our numerous transgressions and past offences, and particularly that while we have been favored with the best advantages for improvement and happiness, having that gospel which bringeth Salvation, we have not prized it more highly, or more carefully exemplified its precepts in our lives; and that while he has bestowed in such abundance the fruits of his providence upon us we have ungratefully abused his favours. Let us supplicate his pardoning mercy that for the sake of the great Redeemer he would graciously be pleased to grant us the remission of our sins, and dispose and enable us by the influence of his spirit to live holy and obedient lives; so that iniquity prove not our ruin. That he would put an end to those errors, which tend to the prostration of good morals, and social order, and correct those habitual vices, which are incompatible with individual and public happiness. That he would avert those public calamities that threaten our land, and cause that our National peace, honour, union and tranquility may be perpetuated, and our rights and privileges extended entire to future generations. Let us unitedly implore his blessing on the Government and People of the United States, that the President may be endued with divine direction and support, his life and health preserved, and that the administration of the General Government may be prospered. That he would especially have this State in his holy keeping, endue those who administer its government with the wisdom which is from above; and protect and prosper the People in their lawful employments; their agriculture, commerce, manufactures and fisheries; and cause that the blessing of health may be enjoyed throughout our land. That he would bless all institutions of Learning, that the the youth may be furnished with those treasures of science, and be trained up in those habits of piety, industry and good order, as will fit them for usefulness in their day and generation. Above all, that the glorious gospel of the Saviour, may be extended into all parts of the world, and be attended with its benign and saving effects; and that its Ministers may be aided and abundantly blessed in their labours. And it is earnestly recommended that all Persons do abstain from such labor and recreation, as would be inconsistent with the design of this public solemnity.\n\nGiven under my hand at the Council-Chamber in Portsmouth, this sixteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and eight ...

From the weight and magnitude now belonging to it I should be compelled to shrink if I had less reliance on the support of an enlightened and generous people, and felt less deeply a conviction that the war with a powerful nation, which forms so prominent a feature in our situation, is stamped with that justice which invites the smiles of Heaven on the means of conducting it to a successful termination.\"\n\nProclamation, November 16, 1814.

They will be invited by the same solemn occasion to call to mind the distinguished favors conferred on the American people in the general health which has been enjoyed, in the abundant fruits of the season, in the progress of the arts instrumental to their comfort, their prosperity, and their security, and in the victories which have so powerfully contributed to the defense and protection of our country, a devout thankfulness for all which ought to be mingled with their supplications to the Beneficent Parent of the Human Race that He would be graciously pleased to pardon all their offenses against Him; to support and animate them in the discharge of their respective duties; to continue to them the precious advantages flowing from political institutions so auspicious to their safety against dangers from abroad, to their tranquillity at home, and to their liberties, civil and religious; and that He would in a special manner preside over the nation in its public councils and constituted authorities, giving wisdom to its measures and success to its arms in maintaining its rights and in overcoming all hostile designs and attempts against it; and, finally, that by inspiring the enemy with dispositions favorable to a just and reasonable peace its blessings may be speedily and happily restored.\n\n[SEAL.]\n\nGiven at the city of Washington, the 16th day of November, 1814, and of the Independence of the United States the thirty-eighth.\n\nJAMES MADISON.\n\nMessage from the President of the United States, to both Houses of Congress at the commencement of the second session of the Twelfth Congress.

His kind providence originally conducted them to one of the best portions of the dwelling place allotted for the great family of the human race. He protected and cherished them under all the difficulties and trials to which they were exposed in their early days. Under His fostering care their habits, their sentiments, and their pursuits prepared them for a transition in due time to a state of independence and self-government. In the arduous struggle by which it was attained they were distinguished by multiplied tokens of His benign interposition. During the interval which succeeded He reared them into the strength and endowed them with the resources which have enabled them to assert their national rights and to enhance their national character in another arduous conflict, which is now so happily terminated by a peace and reconciliation with those who have been our enemies. And to the same Divine Author of Every Good and Perfect Gift we are indebted for all those privileges and advantages, religious as well as civil, which are so richly enjoyed in this favored land.\n\nIt is for blessings such as these, and more especially for the restoration of the blessing of peace, that I now recommend that the second Thursday in April next be set apart as a day on which the people of every religious denomination may in their solemn assemblies unite their hearts and their voices in a freewill offering to their Heavenly Benefactor of their homage of thanksgiving and of their songs of praise.\n\n[SEAL.]\n\nGiven at the city of Washington on the 4th day of March, A.D. 1815, and of the Independence of the United States the thirty-ninth.\n\nJAMES MADISON.\n\nJournal of the Senate of the United States of America, being the Second Session of the Twelfth Congress, begun and held in the City of Washington, November 2d, 1812, and in the thirty-seventh year of the sovereignty of the said United States.

Referring to Washington's services as a Vestryman, it is acknowledged that he was \"Quite active in Church affairs;\" but in touching these the author not only repeats all the traditional errors which, for lack of authentic data, have been made by previous writers on this subject, but he falls into a number of new and strange ones, and becomes involved in a most curious labyrinth of inaccuracies.

The well-known test oath was in these words: \"I do declare that I do believe there is not any Transubstantiation in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, or in the elements of Bread and Wine at or after the Consecration thereof by any person whatsoever.\" For the subscription to the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England there was no formula prescribed by law. The other oaths, too long to be reproduced here, are to be found in the Statutes at Large of England, First of George I., stat. 2, c. 13, and may also be seen, with slight errors in transcription, in Bishop Meade's Old Churches, &c., Vol. II., p. 4.\n\n--p. 110.\n\nBishop William Meade.

May you still go on approved by Heaven, revered by all good men, and dreaded by those tyrants who claim their fellow men as their property!\" ...\n\nWith reply by Washington:\n\n...\"When the councils of the British nation had formed a plan for enslaving America, and depriving her sons of their most sacred and invaluable privileges, against the clearest remonstrances of the constitution--of justice and of truth; and to execute their schemes, had appealed to the sword, I esteemed it my duty to take a part in the contest, and more especially, on account of my being called thereto by the unsolicited representatives of a free people; wishing for no other reward than that arising from a conscientious discharge of the important trust, and that my services might contribute to the establishment of freedom and peace, upon a permanent foundation, and merit the applause of my countrymen, and every virtuous citizen.\"\n\n... \"That the metropolis of your colony is now relieved from the cruel and oppressive invasion of those who were sent to erect the standard of lawless domination, and to trample on the rights of humanity, and is again open and free for its rightful possessors, must give pleasure to every virtuous and sympathetic heart, and being effected without the blood of our soldiers and fellow citizens, must be ascribed to the interposition of that Providence, which has manifestly appeared in our behalf through the whole of this important struggle, as well as to the measures pursued for bringing about the happy event.\n\n\"May that Being who is powerful to save, and in whose hands is the fate of nations, look down with an eye of tender pity and compassion upon the whole of the United colonies; may he continue to smile upon their counsels and arms, and crown them with success, whilst employed in the cause of virtue and mankind. May this distressed colony and its capital, and every part of this wide extended continent, through his divine favour, be restored to more than their former lustre and once happy state, and have peace, liberty, and safely secured upon a solid, permanent, and lasting foundation.\"\n\nLetter to Burwell Bassett, August 28, 1762 .
