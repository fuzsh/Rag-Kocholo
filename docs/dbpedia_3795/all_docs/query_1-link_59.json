OftenI've received valuable information from John, carefully researched during timetaken from his own work on his Harris, Baxter, Barret, Allen, and otherlines. Many times we searched the records together, and discussed our findingsor shared our frustration. To some degree this has been a joint effort.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't alsoacknowledge the benefit I've received from the basic research done by James L.Kendall, deceased, ofJeffersonville, Indiana, and presented to the Filson Club in March and Augustof 1931. Throughout this writing you'llsee his hand. I hope I've fulfilled his wish to have the Ransdell family genealogy \"properly\"arranged. I'm sorry that too many years have passed to permit him to critiquemy work.\n\n.......wkr\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe title \"SIFTED FROM THEASHES\" reflects the number of primary records that have been lost over theyears in Virginia and Kentucky; due to fire, neglect, and war. Far too often ithas been necessary to search out bits and pieces of confirming or indicativedata from sources that only hard work and chance can bring to your attention.Even then, when you've managed to discover what appears to be corroboratingevidence, there is still the gnawing feeling that you may be wrong. That isparticularly true when corroboration is significant and others before you havemuddied the water by presenting their suppositions as facts. Within thiswriting I have attempted to contain myself within the bounds of documentedknowledge, and have made reasonable effort to cite that documentation; givingspecif­ic reference to its source. Where I've allowed my imagina­tion latitudeto flesh out facts with supposition, I've made it a point to let that be known.If I've erred, I want to be corrected.\n\nOver forty years ago when entering my teens,I asked my father the classic questions; \"Who are we?\" and\"Where did we come from?\" What I was given was the equally classicanswer; \"Three Ransdell brothers came to Kentucky from Virginia afterthe Revolutionary War. We're descended from one of them.\" Of course, thatwas oral fantasy; based upon a kernel of truth. Somehow the answer satisfiedme, until I reached my early thirties.\n\nWhen my children began to show aninterest in their origin, they renewed my own interest in our family's his­tory.What I discovered upon questioning older family members surprised me. No onereally knew! By that time my grand­parents were no longer living and neither myfather nor others in his immediate family could tell me more than theirpaternal grandfather's given name, where he was born (which proved to beincorrect), their paternal grandmother's given and family name (that familyname also proved to be incor­rect), and the names of known paternal aunts anduncles.\n\nNow, after more than two decades ofsporadically searching for clues and confirmation, I have documented \"whowe are\" and \"where we came from.\" I am unwilling to let thatknowl­edge once again be lost. There are times in the life of each of us whenit's helpful to reach into the past for insight and inspiration. I want mychildren and grand­children, and the children yet to be born, to understandthat they are part of a continuing history, and realize how difficult thathistory is to reconstruct once it is lost.\n\nIn our case, as with many, to understandour history you must understand the history of America; how it came to be, andhow it evolved. Each is filled with events, both fortuitous and calamitous.What those events were, and how they compounded or simplified the difficultiesI encountered in reconstructing them, is part of my story. They are not thethrust of my story, nor are they clearly defined in its telling. But, they arethere. They are an underlying element, impacting upon the story's contents;motivating me to give emphasis to material that would have been otherwiseomitted. When reaching the point where you wonder what relevance a particularitem of information could possibly have, bear with me. If I've done my jobwell, its relevance will become apparent later.\n\nI've attempted to organize my material ina manner that enables each section to stand alone; relating the history of agiven generation. In doing so, I've been forced occasionally to becomeredundant. To the best of my ability I've kept those occasions to a minimum andhave attempted to provide additional insight or clarity when referencing apreviously cited document. However, you should anticipate being required to doa little page flipping to fully understand who did what to whom. I suggest youread the material through without referencing the cited documents, then go backand gather in the detail.\n\nPROLOGUE.\n\nThere appears to be two or more Americanfamilies bearing the surname Ransdell. One of them originated in the lands alongChesapeake Bay. The other, or others, originated in New England or elsewhere.This is the history of one line of the Ransdell family of Chesapeake Bay. Thechildren now being born are members of its thirteenth documented generation.\n\nI've used the qualifying term\"documented\" because there are indications that the family may have alonger history in America, yet to be documented. If so, the Ransdell family is among the very oldest Americanfamilies of English origin.\n\nMillicent Ramsden is recorded at Jamestown in 1608 (#1). On two separate occasions I've found thecursive \"Ransdell\"interpreted in error as \"Ransden\" or \"Ramsdon\" (#2). I'vealso found the given name Millicent within the family in the early 1700's.Millicent, the daughter of Edward Ransdell of the second generation is named inher father's Will in 1724 (to be cited). Millicent is not a commonly found namefor the time and place in which the second known Millicent lived, and the 1724Will is the first known document to contain the given name of a Ransdelldaughter. It's enough to make one wonder. And, as those readers who've delvedinto it already know; curiosity is the fuel that propels genealogical research.My point is; this isn't the definitive work on the Ransdell family history.There is still much more to be done if the full history of the family is to berecovered. You may be the ideal person to do it. If so, please let me know whatyou discover.\n\nTHEPROGENITOR.\n\nOn Wednesday, October 23, 1661, a CourtLeet & Court Baron was held at St. Clement's Manor, Maryland. Among thosein attendance, as a Leaseholder in the Manor and a member of the Jury, wasEdward Ransdell (#3).\n\n630 St. Clement's Manor Court Proceedings, 1659-1672.\n\nSt. Clements .

James (sic)\n\nFrom the preceding reproduction of theOfficial facsimile of the October 23, 1661, St. Clement's Manor Court record(which is now in the Archives of Maryland) it can be seen that Edward Ransdell is ranked third on the list of tenLeaseholders, and ranked fourth among the twelve men performing Jury andHomage.\n\nAnalysis of the document indicates thatthe rank of individuals within St. Clement's Manor was defined and significant.It isn't known if rank was based upon holdings, tenure, or other factors. It appears to have been based upon all ofthem.\n\nThe position of the name \"John Gee\" in thedocument indicates that it was specifically placed to recognize his rank was superior to that of \"MichaelAbbott\" among the Resiants after the name\"Michael Abbott\" had been recorded. And, the apparent addition of theterm \"absent\", which follows the name \"Luke Gardiner Gent\" in the list of Freeholders,indicates that the entire document was prepared in advance. The name of\"John Gee\" must have been initially omitted as an oversight, or hewas not expected to attend.\n\nYou will also note that Edmond Nanfen is ranked seventh among the jurymen, althoughhe is only a Resiant. For some reason he is accord­ed the title,\"Mr.\". It appears that he outranks Robert Cooper and Arthur De la hay, Leaseholderson the Jury, because of tenure. Otherwise, he would outrank all of theLeaseholders on the Jury.\n\nIf Edmond Nanfen's rank amongthe members of the Jury is based upon tenure, that indicates that EdwardRansdell was among the earlier arrivals at St.Clements Manor. From that, it appears probable that by 1661 Edward Ransdell hadbeen at St. Clement's Manor for some time, and was no longer in his twenties.An educated guess places the year of his birth between 1620 and 1630. Assumingthat he was born in the decade between 1620 and 1630, it is possible that hismother was at Jamestown in 1608. Pure fantasy? Perhaps. It's interesting tonote that no record of the arrival of an Edward Ransdell in America has yetbeen found.\n\nThe preceding is the first documentedrecord of Edward Ransdell who is believed to be the progenitor of theRansdell family along Chesapeake Bay. There are two ad­ditional known recordsof him -- both place him at St. Clement's Manor (#4).\n\nOn February 1, 1664, Edward Ransell (sic)(a miswriting or misreading of Ransdell) made a unique purchase of land from GerrettBreeding (he may be the same man recorded as\"Gerett Brenton\" in the preceding document) -- they were toshare the land and its improve­ments. It isn't known why the unique arrangementwas made, nor if the arrangement indicates some marital connection between theBreeding and Ransdell families. It appears from the fact that Edward was thepurchaser, that he was the younger of the two. But, that is pure supposition.The true significance of the document is not known. However, two points can bemade; Edward Ransdell was still young enough to be acquisitive in 1664, andJames Edmonds and George King (the witnesses to the document) must havebeen nearby neighbors. It's of interest that the Ransdell and Edmonds familiesare known to have remained neighbors, in Virginia, until after theRevolutionary War. (The references supporting that statement are too numerousto cite).\n\nOn October 26, 1666, Edward Ransdell was witness to a Deed of land from ThomasGerrard to Edward Connery. The documentshows Edward Ransdell signing with a unique mark. It has the appearance of asignet. However, not having seen the original document I don't know that to bethe case. In any event, its uniqueness is apparent. During this periodilliteracy was common; even among individuals of conse­quence. It was alsocommon for individuals who were not illiter­ate, to sign with a signet. WhetherEdward Ransdell was illiterate or not remains unknown. My best guess is; hewas.\n\nOn the same document we again find thename of James Edmonds; showing acontinuity of connection, for some reason, between him and Edward Ransdell. Othersignificant names are also seen. Thomas Gerrard, or his son by the same name, is later foundacross the Potomac river from St. Clement's Manor -- in Westmoreland County,Virginia. Gerritt Breedinge (showing the constant variation in spell­ing commonduring this period, and the difficulty encount­ered when attempting tointerpret the cursive documents of any period) is also listed. And, for thefirst time, we find the surname, Foxhall. Years later,that surname is used as a given name in the Ransdell family. It is believed tohave originated through a lateral connection at that later time. However, thereis a known connection between the Foxhall and Ransdell families in the thirdgeneration, which will be covered when the third generation documenta­tion isgiven.\n\nThe three preceding documents are allthat is factually known of Edward Ransdell the Progenitor. As scant as thatdocumentation is; it is still highly informative. And, when seen against thehistory of his period, it paints a fairly clear picture. Over the followingparagraphs I will bring that picture into clearer focus.\n\nThe years between the founding ofJamestown, in 1607, and the first known documentation of Edward Ransdell at St. Clement's Manor, in 1661, were filledwith turbulence. That was so, both in the Colonies and England. Thedifficulties of the first years at James­town are common knowledge. By 1625 --only eighteen years following the founding of James­town, and just five yearsfollowing the later landing at Plymouth Rock -- there were already more deadthan living colonists in English America. Famine and pestilence had killedlarge numbers of those early Virginia colonists who weren't slain by theIndians. Yet, driven by religious turmoil and political dissension at home, themigration to the New World continued.\n\nIn 1634, Maryland was settled by theCalvert family -- under a grant posthumously awardedto the first Lord Balti­more, George Calv­ert. That was not the first effort bythe Calverts to colonize America. George Calvert had previously attempted anaborted settle­ment of Catholics in Newfoundland. Failing in that initialeffort because of the harsh Newfound­land climate, he visited the lands alongthe Chesapeake and by 1632 was petitioning the Crown for title to the unsettledVirginia lands above the Potomac river. Those lands were ulti­mately granted,following George Calvert's death, and conveyed to his son and heir, Cecil;second Lord Baltimore.\n\nCecil Calvert never came to America. The actual settlementof Maryland was led by Cecil's younger brother, Leonard. In two ships (the Ark,and the Dove) Maryland's first colonists arrived at Chesa­peake Bay duringbitter weather, and spent their first months in the by then well establishedsettlement at Jamestown. Lacking that hospital­ity they too may haveexperienced a similar fate to the first settlers of Virginia. But, by order ofthe Crown, and motivated by the common bond of Nationality, the Virginianstreated these unwelcome guests with courtesy.\n\nIt was a Virginian, Henry Fleet, who led the Ark, and the Dove, bearingLeonard Calvert and the first settlers of Maryland, to thePotomac; and showed Calvert the Indian village he occupied and christ­ened St.Mary's (#5). [Mar­garet Barrow, a great-granddaughter of Henry Fleet's widow,Sarah Fleet, later married Wharton Ransdell, the great-grandson of Edward Ransdell theProgenitor. I am descended from Wharton and Margaret (Barrow) Ransdell, and acomplete section on them will be provided.]\n\nFrom the start there was an element ofhostil­ity between the Governments of Virginia and Maryland. That hostilityexisted for three basic reasons:\n\nTheprincipal of those was the Virginia Government's natural resentment over theloss of the lands above the Potomac.\n\nThesecond was the understandably vocal displeasure of those Virginians who hadalready settled above the Potomac. In granting the Calverts the lands thatsubse­quently became Maryland, the Crown had changed the polit­ical climate forthose Virginians, and they had influential supporters within the Government ofVirginia.\n\nThethird was the underlying religious conflict between the leaders of the sisterColonies. Virginia was a Protestant enclave where the Church of England was theestablished religion. Maryland, although never exclusive­ly so, was RomanCatholic. With the estab­lishment of Maryland the three rival religions ofEngland; Anglican, Catholic, and Puritan, each held sway over the Government ofan area of English America. Prior to that, the distance between New England andVirginia had kept the religious conflict between the Governments of theColonies to a minimum. Subsequent to that, with Maryland occupying the landsabove Virginia, Governmental conflicts based upon broad religious differenceswere no longer geographically restrained.\n\nPrior to the founding of Maryland, thethen Governor of Virginia, William Berkeley, had becomeautocratic in his policies. And all Virginians -- regardless of religiouspreference -- were required to provide economic support to the establishedAnglican religion. As a result, there were those in Virginia who were more thanwilling to give up their holdings below the Potomac for equal or betteropportun­ities above it. In the immediate years following 1634, many of themdid. Not only Catholics, but Protestants also migrated to Maryland fromVirginia. There were economic as well as religious incent­ives to do so. TheCalverts lured manpower from Virginia by offering more liberal settlementpolicies than existed under Berkeley. As a result, there was an influentialProtestant element in the Maryland Colony almost from its beginning.\n\nThe third Protestant church built inMaryland was The Episcopal Church of St. Clement's Manor, erected near St.Paul's creek in 1642 (#6). (I am of the opinion that the family of EdwardRansdell the Progenitor was among its members.)\n\nIn 1642, the English Civil War erupted.For the following twenty years Oliver Cromwell dominated the English Govern­ment. That wasparticularly true following Cromwell's beheading of King Charles I, in 1649.\n\nFearful of Cromwell's Puritandriven policies, and vividly aware of his willingness to effect sweepingchange, those in control of appointing the Governors of Virginia and Marylandmade symbolic changes to avoid Cromwell's interven­tion. The Englishbureaucracy removed Berkeley as Governor of Virginia, and the Calvertsappointed a Protestant, William Stone, as Governorof Maryland.\n\nFollowing those changes, serious dissensionstill existed between Catholics and Protestants -- especial­ly within Maryland,where a minor skirmish for control took place and a Puritan faction gained amuch stronger voice in the Maryland Government. Eventually, over time,Catholics and Protestants found common ground for developing their mutualinterests. But, until that final reconciliation was achieved, one group ofVirginians was constantly at the forefront in any opposition to the Calverts.That group was headed by William Claiborne -- who had arrived in Virginia in 1621, andserved first as the Surveyor at Jamestown, and later as Secretary of theColony.\n\nClaiborne was among those the Calverts displaced fromtheir settled lands above the Potomac. In retrospect, it appears likely thatClaiborne's claim to prior settlement was justified, and he was unjustlytreated. But, under pressure to maintain an orderly govern­ment, the Court ofthe British Admiralty upheld the Calverts' posi­tion. Claiborne never forgavethat wrong, and on three separate occasions, one prior and two following hisdisplacement, he proved to be a formidable opponent to the Calverts.\n\nOn the first occasion, Claiborne's followers andthe followers of the Calverts fought the first naval battle on Chesapeake Bay.Clai­borne's faction was victorious. But the victory was short lived. Claiborne's fur trading settlement on KentIsland (in Chesapeake Bay, near the present city of Annapolis) was confiscated,and his followers were forced to withdraw below the Potomac.\n\nOn the second occasion, Claiborne -- with the assist­ance of his kinsman,Richard Thompson -- attempted to organize an invasion ofMaryland (#7). That turned out to be a fiasco, and both William Claiborne andRichard Thompson were declared enemies of Maryland. For his participation inthe fruitless effort, Richard Thompson, who had previously accepted theCalverts and had been granted Popley (later Poplar) Island and the feudal rankof Baron, was stripped of his title and Maryland properties. [A grand­daughterof this same Richard Thompson, Ursula (Presley) Neale, later married Wharton Ransdell, a grandson of Edward Ransdell the Progen­itor.I am descended from Wharton and Ursula (Presley) Ransdell, and a full sectionon them will be provided.]\n\nOn the third occasion, Claiborne succeeded in gaining control of Maryland --which he held for a period of five years. This time, he used his influence inEngland to win appointment as an officer of the Protectorate -- the termapplied to the English Government under Oliver Cromwell. It was onlyafter the Calverts appeased Cromwell that Claiborne was displaced, and theGovernment of Maryland was returned to them. One element of this appeasementwas the freedom of religion law, for which Maryland became so justly famous.\n\nEdwardRansdell the Progenitor does not appear to have beenconspicuously involved in politics or religion, and was most probably a memberof that social class which leaves those matters to others. That supposi­tion isborne out by a later document, identifying his grandson, Wharton Ransdell, as a\"Yeoman\" (to be cited).\n\nBear in mind, the fledgling Colonies werean extension of Eng­land, and the Colonial social classes mirrored those ofEngland. In the Colonies, as in England, a Yeoman was respected; but he was asmall landholder who rarely involved himself with matters beyond his immediaterequire­ments. Few Yeomen aspired to, or achieved, an active role of leadershipin the broader community. The leadership role was left to the Gentry, who wereless pressed with everyday affairs. Historically in England many of the youngersons of the Gentry, forced by their circumstances, became Yeomen. It was notuntil later, in the Colonies, that sons of Yeomen readily became Gentry.Colonial wealth and its resultant social fluidity were just beginning todevelop. The \"Yeoman\" grandson of Edward the Progenitor, WhartonRansdell, ultimately became affluent and became \"Gentry.\" As a memberof the Gentry he participated in politics and served as Sheriff of WestmorelandCounty, Virginia.\n\nEDWARDRANSDELL OF THE SECOND GENERATION.\n\nOn October 22, 1696, Edward Ransdell, carpenter and cooper, of Westmoreland County,Virginia, is documented in that County's records as the purchaser of 192 1/2acres between Rappahannock creek and Nomony river. That is the first knownrecord of Edward Ransdell of the second gene­ration.\n\nThe record, itself, is unique (#8). It documents three transactions whichoccurred over a period of thirteen years, trans­ferring ownership of the sameland. Apparently, the trans­actions prior to 1696 were not recorded, or therecords were no longer extant. In either event, Edward Ransdell appears to have protected his title by havingthe records of owner­ship brought forward prior to purchase. At the same time,he wisely cleared the title of potential clouds, by having the dower rights ofthe wives of its previous owners released. (It is my belief he was from acrossthe Potomac in Maryland, as the records of Edward the Progenitor indicate, and oldenough to secure good advice before acting. His subsequent records supportthat.)\n\nIt is interesting to note, on April 14,1696, Henry Arkell of Essex County, cooper, sold land inWestmoreland County (#9). Edward Ransdell appears to have arrived upon the scene tofulfill the need for a required skill. Of course, that he arrived when he didcould be pure coincidence; there was a ready interchange between the colonistson the opposite banks of the Potomac, and many of them held land in bothMaryland and Virginia.\n\nIt is accepted that Edward Ransdell of Westmoreland County, Virginia, was the sonof Edward Ransdell of St. Clement's Manor, Maryland. The proximity of the twoloca­tions (the Potomac river separates them), the known migra­tion to Virginiafrom Maryland of associated families, and the knowledge provided by the Will ofthis second Edward, dated 1724 (to be cited), provide the basis for that accept­ance.It is clear that they were not the same man.\n\nIt is known from the Deed of October 22,1696, that Edward Ransdell of Westmoreland was a carpenter and cooper.His occupation is confirmed in other records; one of which is dated December 7,1702 (#10). That is a signifi­cant fact. As such, this second Edward Ransdellwas less heavily dependent upon the land for his livelihood than those who werePlanters. This was an age when tobacco was the only significant cash crop -- acash crop that was shipped in hogsheads -- and it depleted the soil of itsrequired nutrients in less than a decade. Even those planters who heldsufficient land to maintain themselves in one locale, were constantly requiredto fell the heavy timber of the virgin forest for new fields. They needed relativelylarge land holdings, and cheap labor, to survive. He did not. Lumber wasplentiful, and inexpen­sive. And, then, as now, essential skills were at apremium. Planters who didn't possess the resources to buy slave labor wereultimately forced to move inland. That movement compounded their problems. Their depleted lands were a drug on themarket. Removed from the waterways -- the only mode of relatively inexpensivecrop transportation -- they were quickly relegated by economic pressure to therole of second class citizens. Although he himself never acquired vast landholdings, Edward Ransdell prospered. He was not limited by the size of his landholdings, and relatively free from the fluctuation in the price of tobacco thatadded to the ruin of many other small landholders of the period.\n\nThis was a time of large families. Therewere several reasons for that. Marriages were made at a very young age --maximizing the number of years of female fertility. Women were dependent uponmen to work the land; and even those younger women with land of their ownrarely spent more than a year in widowhood. Children were an asset in a labor intense economy. Remarriage often took place in a matter ofweeks or months. Romantic love was not a major considera­tion. The death ratewas high, and those who survived, married; quickly, often, and to whomever wasavailable. As a result, there was a rapid integration of disparate famil­iesinto a clan. Once the clan reached sufficient size to provide the necessarymates, it closed ranks, and more than a century of inbreeding followed. It ishighly likely that the process had its earliest begin­ning for the Rans­dell family, in Maryland. And, by the time we findEdward Ransdell in Westmoreland, it is equally likely that he was alreadyrelated to the community of families known to have migrated to Virginia.Although we know nothing about his mother, her family, a possible stepmotherand her family, or a possible stepfather and his family, or pos­sible full orhalf brothers and/or sisters; it is likely that some combination of those wasthere, and the process of inbreed­ing had already begun. With that in mind, theknown records of Edward Ransdell of the second generation take on an addeddimension. They indicate possible past family connections, and point the way topotential future family connections.\n\nThe next known significant document ofEdward Ransdell of the second generation appears in theWestmoreland County, Virginia records dated May 30, 1699 (#11). In it, he sells 30 acres ofland to Jacob Ramy, Jr. The document places Edward Ransdell inCople Parish (the Sou­thern part of Westmoreland County), confirms hisoccupation as a carpenter, and provides sufficient information to recognize theland being sold as being a portion of the land he purchased in 1696. But themost significant information provided is the given name of his wife, Mary, whorelin­quished her right of dower. From that and other records (to be cited) weknow that Edward Rans­dell was married three times; and Mary Ransdell, who washis second wife, was the mother of four of Edward's five known children. And,it is highly probable that he married her in Virginia.\n\nA descendant of the Ramy family, now living in Louis­ville, Ky., hastold me that his family originated in Westmoreland County, Va., and theimmigrant was a French Huguenot. I have no reason to doubt his statements. Iknow of no marital connections between the two families, and from what I doknow, it is my opinion that none occurred.\n\nAlthough there are additional records ofthis second Edward Ransdell, which will becited, the most informative is his Will (#12). That document, dated May 1, 1724 and probated July 6, 1724, names hiswife at the time of his death, and provides the name and County of her formerhusband. From that, it is known that sometime between 1699 and 1724, MaryRansdell died, and Edward Ransdell married Amy Kelley, the widow of Captain John Kelley ofRappahannock (later Rich­mond) County, Virginia. (Richmond County is adjacentto Westmoreland.) The Will also provides the names of three sons; Wharton(eldest), Edward, and John. Edward andJohn are identified as minors, and are left in the care of Wharton, until 21.Two daughters are named; Elizabeth Talbott and Millicent Longworth. William Longworth is also named (presumed tobe Millicent's husband) and several of Amy (Kelley) Ransdell's children by herformer husband are named. Amy (Kelley) Ransdell is left little of Edward Rans­dell'sestate; but does receive her former husband's planta­tion. Edward's eldest son,Wharton Ransdell, is named Executor.\n\nOn March 10, 1723, a year before hisdeath, Edward Ransdell made a Deed of gift, of slaves, to his twoyounger sons; Edward and John (#13). In that Deed, he also identi­fied hisgrandson; Edward, son of Wharton.\n\nOn Jan. 24, 1720 -- four years before hisdeath -- Edward Ransdell made a Deed of gift of all his land in CopleParish, to his son Wharton (#14). In that Deed, Wharton is titled\"Yeoman\" (as was previously mentioned). Edward's three sons; Wharton(recipient of the gift), Edward, and John are mentioned. The land is to passfrom Wharton to his male heirs; in default, it is to pass to Edward, then hismale heirs; in further default, it is to pass to John, then his male heirs. Infurther default, it is to pass to the female heirs of Wharton. No daughters arementioned. The Deed was acknowledged by Edward and his wife, Amy, on January30, 1720 -- thus showing that Amy (Kelley) Ransdell wasEdward's wife by that date, and Mary Ransdell, Edward's former wife, must havedied prior to January 30, 1720.\n\nSometime after Edward's death in 1724,and before February 4, 1729, Amy (Kelley) Ransdell moved from Westmore­land County to herplantation, formerly belonging to Capt. John Kelley. Her Will, dated Feb. 4, 1729, gives her as being of the Parish ofSittenbourne, County of Richmond (#15). In it, she does not name any of EdwardRansdell's children. She does name four of her children by Capt. John Kelley.From that it is concluded that she was not the mother of any children by EdwardRansdell. That indicates that she was beyond her childbearing years prior to1720, and Edward Ransdell, her husband, was born circa 1660.\n\nOn a number of occasions, Edward Ransdell was a member of a jury called to settle landdisputes (#16).\n\nIn 1706, Edward Ransdell received a land grant of 141 acres inWestmoreland County (#17). It appears to be a reaffirmation of his title to hisexisting holdings. That conclusion is based upon the failure to find any recordof him selling land, other than the 30 acres previously cited, and an analysisof the family acquisitions and holdings in the following generations. It isalso based upon a knowl­ edge of the history of the period -- during this time,the Culpeper/ Fairfax agent, Robert Carter, was making a concert­ed effort toestab­lish their proprietary rights in the Northern Neck of Virginia, andexisting land titles were being reaffirmed by land grants under theirproprietary claim.\n\nOn October 28, 1707, Thomas Thompson was appointed surveyor of all the lands inWestmoreland County (#18).\n\nOn Jan. 17, 1715 -- nine years before hisdeath -- Edward Ransdell was named as a \"friend\" in the Willof Thomas Thompson, Gentleman(#19). The Will also named, \"friends\", Thomas Lee and William Peirce.\n\nThomas Thompson's Willindicates the status Edward Ransdell held in the community:\n\nItis believed, but not certainly known that Thomas Thomp­son was a descendant of Richard Thompson, thepartici­pant in the abortive attempt with his kinsman, William Claiborne, to invade Maryland. As was previously stated,Wharton Ransdell, eldest son of Edward of the secondgeneration, married Ursula (Presley) Neale -- her second husband and his first wife. Sheis known to have been a granddaught­er of Richard Thomp­son, kinsman of WilliamClaiborne (#20).\n\nThomasLee was a forefather of the family that is nowknown as the Lee's of Virgin­ia. That family included Richard Henry Lee, whosigned the Declaration of Inde­pendence, and General Robert E. Lee, of CivilWar fame. There were later inter­connect­ions between the Ransdell and Lee families. The great-granddaughter ofEdward Ransdell of the second gener­ation, Elizabeth (Rans­dell) Davenport, married asher second husband, Dr. George Steptoe -- whose sisters married members of the Leefamily (#21).\n\nWilliamPeirce was the great-grandson of Capt. WilliamPeirce of Jamestown; who arrived at Jamestown in 1610 and was Captain of theGuard in 1617. Captain William Peirce was also a member of the Council ofVirginia, standing sixth, 1632, and second, 1646 (#22). He is well document­edin early Virginia history. John Rolfe married one of his daughters, Jane, afterPocahontas died. A granddaughter of Edward Ransdell of the second generation, Sarah Elliott Ransdell, later married Joseph Peirce, thesecond son of William Peirce, \"friend\" to Thomas Thompson (to be cited).\n\nAs is documented by his own Will, EdwardRansdell of the second generation was survived bythree sons and two daughters:\n\nThedaughters (Elizabeth Talbott, and Millicent Long­worth) survived their husbands while still young.Eliza­beth then married William Thornton of Richmond County, Virginia (#23). She diedthere, testate, in 1742 (#24). Her older brother, Wharton, witnessed her Will.Millicent married as her second husband, Luke Thornton, brother of WilliamThornton -- her sister's husband (#25). Luke and Milli­cent Thornton moved toOrange County, Virginia, where their records can be found (#26). The known agesof William and Luke Thornton indicate the dates of birth of Elizabeth andMillicent Ransdell were circa 1702 (#27). Thus, Mary Ransdellwas their mother.\n\nWhartonRansdell, Edward's eldest son, married (circa 1715)Ursula (Presley) Neale (previously cited), widow of Daniel Neale,III (whose Will is reportedly filed in West­moreland County, dated 1713). Shewas the daughter of Peter and Elizabeth (Thompson) Presley (#28). The date of birth of Ursula(Presley) Ransdell is estimat­ed to be circa 1685 by those who have researchedthe Presley family. Her father, Peter Presley, son of William Presley,progenitor of the Presley family of Northumber­land County, Virginia, died in1693. And, it is known that her parents married circa 1660. Unless she was mucholder than Wharton, he also was born near that same (1685) date (#29). It isknown that Wharton Ransdell was born prior to 1696. He appears in the records,as a member of the West­moreland Grand Jury, in 1717 (#30). It is also knownthat he did not qualify for Grand Jury duty until after marrying Ursula(Presley) Neale. (At least there are no land records to indicate that hedid.) He was probably older than twenty­-onein 1717. Even if Wharton Ransdell was born in 1696, that would still make him sixto eight years older than his father's next known child. It is highlyimprobable that nearly a decade passed between children by the same mother. Itis my opinion that Mary Ransdell was the second wife of Edward Ransdell, andshe was not Wharton's mother. The identity of Wharton Ransdell's mother has notbeen learned. His given name implies that his mother was a member of theWharton family, which is known to have been in bothMaryland and Virginia prior to the time of his birth. Considerably moreresearch is needed in the records of both States on the early Wharton family.The supposition that Wharton's mother was Mary Gorham, repeated as fact by somewriters, is not tenable.\n\nThereare few known records of Edward Ransdell of the third generation. Those found showthat he lived to reach manhood, and there is some indication that he marriedand had children [that supposition is based upon his few known documents (to becited), and the inabil­ity to clearly identify some individuals bearing theRansdell name in later generations]. The first record I've been able toattribute to Edward Ransdell of the third generation, is on file in Westmore­landCounty: in 1736 he was the Executor of the Will of William Shaw (#31). That is known to be his record,because in the Will, William Shaw also mentions Elizabeth Sturman and Edward Ransdell, Jr. (At that date, thedesignation \"Jr.\" did not have the same meaning as at present. It didnot signify a father/son relationship. Any indi­vid­ual within a community who bore the same name as an olderperson within that community, was designated \"Jun­ior\"; or,occasionally, individuals bearing the same name were speci­fied by the use ofsome distinguishing title, such as a military rank or similar unique identi­fier.) The Will of William Shaw could not be arecord of Edward of the second generation -- he died in 1724. Nor do I believethe Executor to be Wharton Ransdell's son, Edward, grown to manhood. The bestestimates of the age of this younger Edward, have him in his late teens in1736. [Wharton and Ursula did not marry until circa 1715, and their first bornchild is known to have been a girl, Elizabeth (to be cited)]. Although it ispossible that the Edward Ransdell, Jr. in William Shaw's Will was an elsewhereundocumented son of Edward of the third generation, I find that difficult toaccept. If more than one younger Edward Ransdell was present in the commun­ity,it is highly likely that William Shaw's Will would have speci­fied whichyounger Edward Ransdell was intended -- by giving the name of his father. It ismy belief the Edward, Jr. in the Will of William Shaw, was Edward, son ofWharton. He is known to have later married Elizabeth Sturman, who is also namedas a beneficiary (to be cited). For that reason, I believe William Shaw,Elizabeth Sturman, and Edward Ransdell, Jr. were close to the same age, andfriends. It is possible that there was a connection between the Shaw andRansdell families through Mary Ransdell, the mother of Edward Ransdell of thethird generation, and as the eldest male of that connection, he was namedexecutor. That supposition should be checked for validity by some individual who is descended from EdwardRansdell of the second generation through other than his eldest son, Wharton.The only additional record I can directly attribute to Edward of the thirdgeneration, is of record in Orange County, Virginia (#32). He was witness to amortgage by Luke Thorn­ton, husband ofhis sister Millicent. I don't know where that document was signed. There are noother known records of Edward Ransdell of the third generation in OrangeCounty. He may have died young, or he may have moved elsewhere. There is apossi­bility that he moved to North Carolina. There are records of a Ransdellfamily there, but I have not pursued them.\n\nJohnRansdell of the third generation is known to havemoved to Orange County, Virginia with his sister Milli­cent and her husband,Luke Thornton (#33). The records of his family are to befound there. John did not prosper, and in 1760, it is stated that his childrenwere put out by the County Court, to learn trades. I don't know what thatmeans, not having seen the records. I do know that William, John, Sanford, andJesse Ransdell are recorded in the Orange County records of the 1780's, ashaving a number of children each (#34), and William, John, and Sanford Ransdellare later recorded as owning land (#35). They appear to be the sons of John ofthe third genera­tion. Jesse Ransdell died in 1795, leaving very little (#36).William, John, and Sanford sold their Orange County land in preparation formoving to Kentucky (#37), where they appear later. It is my belief that theyare the Ransdell family members found in the records of Mercer County, Kentucky(#38). At least one member of the Orange County, Virginia, family (Joshua) isknown to have moved to Georgia (#39). Connect­ing families are known to havemoved to North Carol­ina (#40). Two members of this family were very early inHarrison County, Indiana (#41), and fought at thebattle of Tippecanoe (#42). (Tippecanoe was the initial battle of the War of1812, and is credited with opening the Indiana Territory for settle­ment.)Those two early Indiana Ransdells are definitely connected to the Ransdellfamily found in Mercer County, Kentucky (#43). (I possess a considerable amountof detail on the Orange County Rans­dell families, but it is inappropriate forthis writing -- wkr.)\n\nWHARTONRANSDELL OF THE THIRD GENERATION.\n\nIt is reasonable to believe that WhartonRansdell of the third generation was trained by hisfather to be a carpenter, cooper, and joiner. If so, he followed that trade andprospered. If not, he still prospered. He ultimately became a Gentleman Justiceof Westmoreland (#44), and was Sheriff of Westmoreland in 1739 (#45).\n\nWharton modestly expanded his father'sland holdings in Westmoreland. In 1740, he is shown as having 240 acres, andhis eldest son, Edward, is shown as having 100 acres (#46). The 100 acresappears to have been purchased (by Wharton?) upon the marriage of this eldestson, to secure the son's franchise to vote. (Anoth­er indication that Whartonhimself was beyond the age of twenty-one when he gained this right.) The votinglaws of this period required a minimum holding of 100 acres within a County, toqualify to vote in that County. However, a man could vote in every county wherehe held a sufficient quantity of land.\n\nWharton also made sizeable land purchasesin Stafford and Prince William Counties. His holdings in Prince William were inthat portion which later became Fauquier County (to be cited).\n\nIn 1717, Wharton Ransdell served as a member of the Westmoreland CountyGrand Jury (previously cited). The implication of that record is that Whartonwas married to Ursula (Presley) Neale prior to that date. Prior to his marriage, hehad no land, and did not qualify for such duty.\n\nIn 1718, Ursula (Presley) Ransdell's only brotherdied. He was Captain Peter Presley, of Northumberland County. The court recordsof that County following his death, establish her identity and proves she wasmarried to Wharton Ransdell by that date.\n\nUrsula Ransdell and Mary Cox were named as Executors in Capt. PeterPresley's Will (#47).The Presley family was among the most respected in Colonial Virginia. Ursula'sgrandfather, father, uncle, and first cousin; between them, sat as members ofthe Virginia House of Burgesses from Northumberland County for over 100 years(1647-1759) (#48). That County was formed in 1647 -- and initially covered allof Virginia above the York river.\n\nIt would be impossible to fullyunderstand the lives of Wharton and his children without first understandingthe impact the Presley family had upon them. Through Ursula, thisline of the Ransdell family became accepted members of theTidewater Aristocracy. That membership included the privilege, and theexpectation, to participate in the broader social questions of the day. Theywere no longer members of the \"Yeoman\" class. They were \"Gentry.\"\n\nUrsula's mother was Elizabeth Thompson, the daughter of Richard Thompson (previouslymentioned) and Ursula (Bishe) Thompson (the daughter of a merchant ofBristol, England) (#49). The life of Ursula (Bishe) Thompson provides suffi­cientmaterial itself to fill a manuscript. She was married three, some say four,times, and each husband was prominent. It has been stated that PresidentZachary Taylor was descended from her. I have not verifiedthat.\n\nIt would be possible at this point todigress at length among the records of the Presley family. Beyond the satisfaction of doing so,there is little to be gained. The point has been made, and sufficiently so, toillustrate a marked change in the circumstances of the eldest line of theRansdell family in the third generation. Such is not aunique story; a similar change occurred during the migra­tions to Kentucky, andelsewhere, when more aggressive or fortunate members of many familiesestablished social status for their posterity -- to be wasted or enhanced bytheir subsequent behavior. The old saws hold true; \"It takes money to makemoney\" and \"One third of the world's wealth is passed down everygeneration\". The raw truth is; the younger sons of Edward of the secondgeneration were victims of their time. Not receiving enough to insure theirprosper­ity, they failed to prosper. And in subsequent generations, manydescendants of Wharton and Ursula suffered that same fate; while descendants ofhis younger brothers grappled with their circumstances and overcame them. Overtime, it became impossible on purely economic grounds to determine one from theother. However, one distinguishing mark remained. The pride in the Presleyancestry of Wharton and Ursula's descendants maintained the Presley name as agiven name within that branch of the family for genera­tions. That is animportant fact. There is no known incident where the given name Presley hasbeen found in a Ransdell family descended from other than Wharton and Ursula(Presley) Ransdell. If such occurred, I will appreciate being advised.\n\nIt is known that Wharton Ransdell married Ursula (Presley) Neale about 1715 (previously cited). It is statedthat she had two children by Daniel Neale, III; Hannah, and Presley (#50).There is a possibility that she had more (#51).\n\nDaniel Neale, III was bornin Northumberland County, circa 1680 (#52). His children could not have been ofage when he died in 1713. Ursula Presley was also born in Northumberland, but she isknown to have been living in Westmoreland with Daniel Neale, III when he died,and she was apparently still there when she married Wharton Ransdell (#53). With his marriage to Ursula (Presley)Neale, Wharton must have gained control of her former husband's estate. It isprobable that he lived there until Daniel Neale III's eldest son, PresleyNeale, came of age.\n\nPresley Neale later lived in Fairfax County, Virginia,where he died in 1749. He owned estates in Fairfax, West­moreland, andNorthumberland (#54).\n\nOn January 21, 1720, Colonel PeterPresley [first cousin to Ursula (Presley) Ransdell] upon motionof Daniel McCarty, Esq., inbehalf of Mr. Wharton Ransdell and Mr. Charnock Cox, appearedbefore the Court of Northumberland County and gave deposition that he wroteCaptain Peter Presley's Will, and the deceased intended to give his Negroes --not bequeathed -- to his two sisters; Ursula Ransdell, and Mary Cox. That isthe first known instance where Wharton Ransdell is addressed by the title,\"Mr.\" -- the title of a Gentleman (#55).\n\nWith the acquisition of ad­ditionalslaves, Wharton would have had to find something for them to do. A naturaloption was to put them to work on the land. It is possible that Wharton wasgiven his father's land in Cople Parish, in 1720, for that purpose (previouslycited).\n\nIn 1726, in Westmoreland County, WhartonRansdell is named in the Will of Youell Watts (#56). I do not know the significance of thatdocument. However, it could have a connection to his mother, and needs to beresearched.\n\nOn March 18, 1727, Wharton Ransdell purchased an additional 100 acres of land inthe vicinity of that receiv­ed from his father in 1720 (#57). The new landtouched Robert Sanford, Cockerill, and Ashton. The witnesseswere William Sturman and Thomas Chilton. Wharton'srelease and bond were recorded Apr. 2, 1728. It is my supposition that thisland was purchased in preparation for Presley Neale's coming ofage. On or about that date, Wharton must have had to turn the estate of DanielNeale, III over to its rightful owner. Both of Wharton's younger brothers wereprobably still living with him at the time. (It was not until 1734 that Luke Thornton and John Ransdell -- \"Luke Thornton'sbrother-in-law\" -- appear in the records of Orange County.) It isinteresting to note that the given name Sanford appears in the Ransdell familyof Orange County, and later in the family in Mercer County, Kentucky, andHarrison County, Indiana. It is possible that JohnRansdell married a daughter of Robert Sanford before moving from WestmorelandCounty.\n\nOn August 30, 1727, Wharton and UrsulaRansdell, of CopleParish, Westmoreland County, sold Negro slaves, in trust, during their lives,and afterward for the use of their children, viz., Elizabeth, Edward, Wharton,and William; \"being the children of said Wharton and Ursula\" (#58).That document clearly establishes the identity of the four known children ofWharton and Ursula Ransdell. The purchasers of the slaves were William Sturman and John Paine. The amount paid was five shillings (probablyan annual payment). The implica­tion is; Wharton and Ursula had more slavesthan they could use. I do not know the number of slaves involved, but thecircumstance fits very well with the theory that Wharton moved to a smallerproperty about this time.\n\nSometime between the date of thepreceding document (1727) and 1732/3, Ursula (Presley) Ransdell died. That is known because in 1732/3 WhartonRansdell remarried. Immediately prior to his remarriage, Wharton was theExecutor of the Will of his near neighbor William Sturman (#59). Within a short time he married thewidow, Sarah (Elliott) Sturman (#60). The tombstone dates of adaughter by this second marriage confirm that. At \"Level Green\", the ancest­ralhome of the Peirce family in Westmoreland County, is the markerof Sarah Elliott (Ransdell) Peirce. She died in 1783, in her 49th year (to becited). She was born in 1734.\n\nOn January 29, 1738, Richard Moxley of Parish of Washington, WestmorelandCounty, sold 100 acres to Edward Ransdell of the Parish of Copeley (sic), adjoiningWharton Ransdell, Gentleman, and Nicholas Minor. Witnesses were Nicholas Minor, Jr. andWilliam Muse (#61). It is my assumption, as previouslystated, that this was land purchas­ed (by Wharton?) for Edward, Wharton'seldest son. This is the time when Wharton's eldest son would have come of age,and about the time this eldest son married his stepsister, Elizabeth Sturman -- the daughter of William Sturman and Sarah(Elliott) Sturman [whowas by this date Sarah (Elliott) (Sturman) Ransdell] (#62).\n\nIn 1739, in Westmoreland, WhartonRansdell is named \"friend\" in the Will ofJohn Footman (#63). Here again, I don't know thesignificance of the document, and more research is needed. However, you willrecall that this was the year that Wharton was sheriff, and John Footman mayhave mentioned him in his Will for any of a number of reasons.\n\nWharton Ransdell was mentioned in another Will in 1739; thatof Sarah Monroe (#64) -- his mother-in-law. It is stated thatSarah Monroe was born Sarah Foxhall, and was the niece of John Foxhall, one of theearly Westmoreland set­tlers. It is possible that she was born in Maryland --recall Mr. Foxhall, the neighbor of Edward Ransdell at St. Clement's Manor. Itis known that she was Sarah Elliott, widow, in1708 (#65). She next married Andrew Monroe, who predeceased her (#66). HerWill, as Sarah Monroe, dated 1739, named the following individuals; Mr. WhartonRansdell, (daughter) Sarah Ransdell, Thomas Ransdell and Sarah Elliott Ransdell(Sarah Elliott Ransdell later married Capt. Joseph Peirce, and it is known that Elliott was her middlename), (son) John Elliott, (grandson) John Elliott, (daughter) Sibella Elliott,(daughter) Sarah Sturman and William Sturman, (grand­son) FoxhallSturman, (grandson) Spence Monroe, (grandchildren) Elizabeth, Sarah, and MarthaStur­man; Executor, John Elliott.\n\nI have not seen a complete copy of SarahMonroe's Will, and donot know why two daughters named Sarah are listed in the abstract, or if infact they were so designated in the Will. It appears to be an error based uponthe identifica­tion of the Sturman grandchildren as being the children of her daughterSarah, by William Sturman. It is known that William Sturman was dead prior tothis date (previously cited).\n\nThe Will of Sarah Monroe is the only document in which Thomas Ransdell, the son ofWharton and Sarah (Elliott) Ransdell, isever mentioned. He apparently died young. There is another name of interestfound in this document; Spence Monroe. It is not known if this Spence Monroewas the Spence Monroe who later fathered President James Monroe, or not. But,this was the same Monroe family, and it is entirely possible. I have notchecked this out.\n\nIn 1736, three years before her death,Sarah Monroe appeared in Court and gave a deposition(#67). Her age, at that time, is given as seventy-one; placing her year ofbirth as 1665. At this same hearing, William Monroe (age 70) and Mary Chilton (age 55) also gave depositions. I have notseen, and do not know the meaning of this document.\n\nWharton Ransdell died testate (#68). His Will was written\"in perfect health\" on June 10, 1755. (This further corroborates thecontention that he was born circa 1685.) It was not probated until April 25,1758. In it, he names the following as Executors: Wife Sarah, and three sons;Edward, Wharton, and William. Edward was given \"land where I live\",also a silver watch and a silver hilted sword, and the remainder of the land inStafford, on Beaver Dam Creek, not already given to \"my daughter\" SarahElliott Peirce. Wharton was given his father's wearingapparel and Negro. William was given a piece of land near North Cobbler Mount­ain,in Prince William County, and a Negro. (The portion of Prince William Countycontaining North Cobbler Mountain later became part of Fauquier County.)\n\nIt is interesting to note, that also in1758, the Will of a Daniel Neale was probated in Westmoreland County (#69).That Will names three of the deceased's sons and a brother as Executors. Thesons were; Spence, Daniel, and Rodman (or Rodham) Neale. The brother wasRamsdall Neale. I have not seen this document, and do not know if it has beencorrectly abstracted. I do know that in 1763, Edward Ransdell, Guardian ofthe orphans of Daniel Neale of Westmoreland County, bound John Neale to SolomanRedman, till 21(#70). Several interesting suppositions can be drawn from this data:\n\nThebrother \"Ramsdall\" was in fact a half-brother (Edward Ransdell), and DanielNeale was another son of Ursula (Presley) Ransdell byher first husband, Daniel Neale, III.\n\nTheRansdell and Neale families were interconnected prior to themarriage of Wharton and Ursula (Presley) Ransdell. Ifthe latter, that would indicate the possibility of additional records inMaryland or Virginia, corroborating it.\n\nSix years before he wrote his Will,Wharton Ransdell had already begun to put his house in order.On April 5, 1749, he made a gift of land to his two younger sons; Wharton andWilliam (#71). The land was in Prince William County, on Cedar Run.\"Wharton Ransdell of County of Westmoreland, Gentleman, for love andaffection for his sons Wharton and William gives (reserving for himself 100acres in Prince William County on Button Branch during his life and afterwardsto his sons) to William land purchased of Captain Thomas Barber on Cedar Run, 350 acres, corner near Mr.Scott's quarter,Francis Thornton to Button Branch, to mouth of Barber Branch;to Wharton, 420 acres, part of same tract, near Cedar Run.\" Signed WhartonRansdell; no wife signs. Witnesses; Richard Hampton, GeorgeNeavill, John Ralls, Robert Asbee (Ashby?).\n\nIt is known from Wharton's Will, dated1755, that he had given land in Stafford County to his daughter, Sarah Elliott (Ransdell) Peirce. No record ofthat gift has yet been found.\n\nWharton's widow, Sarah (Elliott) (Sturman) Ransdell, survived himby twenty-three years. Her Will was written in 1778, and probated inWestmoreland County in 1781 (#72). In it, she names her daughter Sarah ElliottPeirce, son-in-lawJoseph Peirce, granddaughter Martha Peirce, and grandson Elliott Sturman.\n\nThe four surviving children of WhartonRansdell of the third generation were; Edward(eldest), Wharton, William, and Sarah Elliott (Ransdell) Peirce. It is notknown when his daughter by Ursula (Presley) Ransdell,Elizabeth, died. And, as previously stated, the only record of his son, Thomas,by Sarah (Elliott) (Sturman) Ransdell, is the Will of Sarah Monroe.\n\nSarah Elliott (Ransdell) Peirce, as has beenpreviously stated, married Joseph Peirce. Joseph Peirce was a direct descendantof Captain William Peirce of Jamestown. The Peirce's were early settlers ofWestmoreland County, and Peirce's creek takes its name from them. Joseph andSarah Elliott (Ransdell) Peirce had five daughters and four sons. Among themwere; Ransdell, Martha, Sally Ransdell, Margaret (married elder R. H. Herndon), Fannie, andSibella (married Samuel Templeman) (#73).\n\nThere is some indication that SamuelTempleman married two of the daughters of Joseph andSarah Elliott (Ransdell) Peirce, or the samedaughter documented by two similar names. He is given as the husband ofIsabella (Peirce) (Chilton) Templeman, the widow of Thomas Chilton, sonof Major Thomas Chilton and Jemima (Cooke) Chilton, in the extensive documentation ofthe Chilton family in The Virgin­ia Genealogist.\n\nMajor Thomas and Jemima (Cooke) Chilton were also the parents of Mary (Chilton)Ransdell, the wife ofWilliam Ransdell of the fourth generation (#74). The tendency toward marryingwithin tightly knit family groups reflects the general practice of the period,and is not unique to these families.\n\nCaptain Joseph Peirce (he was so titled) is honorably mentioned inSemple's History of Virginia Baptist's. I do not know if Sally Ransdell was married to a Ransdell, or simply givenher mother's maiden name as a middle name. There is precedent for this usage ofthe mother's maiden name when the first name was Sarah. (Sally appears to be afamiliar name for Sarah.) Captain Joseph and Sarah Elliott (Ransdell) Peirce lived on the Peirce familyEstate, Level Green, WestmorelandCounty. The family burial plot is, or was, still there (previously cited).\n\nEdward Ransdell of the fourth generation, is known to havemarried his stepsister, Elizabeth (Sturman) Ransdell,circa 1738, and inherited his father's lands in Westmoreland; where he diedtestate in 1773 (#75). He is believed to be the same Edward Ransdell who was guardian to the children of the DanielNeale who died in 1758 (previously cited).\n\nEdward and Elizabeth (Sturman) Ransdell (who survived him) had only two knownchildren; Edward Ransdell, Jr., and Elizabeth (Ransdell) (Davenport) Steptoe.\n\nThe obituary of Edward Ransdell, Jr. wasadvertised in the Virginia Gazette, March 4, 1773; \"Died, on 24 February,1773, Mr. Edward Ransdell, Jr. The only son of Mr. Edward Ransdell ofWestmoreland. A hopeful young man, and much lamented.\" (#76). From that isgained supporting evidence that there was only one Edward Ransdell living inWestmore­land at this date; and Edward of the third generation must have diedprior to this date, or moved elsewhere.\n\nOne of the most historic documents of theperiod immediately preceding the Revolution, is the \"Resolutions Againstthe Stamp Act\" drafted by Richard Henry Lee, and signed in1765, first by himself, and then by other leading men of the Northern Neck ofVirginia. The name Edward Ransdell appears on that document. The Resolution isreputed to be the first public association in the land for the resistance tothat act. The Edward Ransdell who placed himself in jeopardy by so signing hisname, must have been Edward of the fourth generation. His son was of age, butsigned himself Edward Ransdell, Jr. (#77).\n\nEdward Ransdell and his son, Edward Ransdell, Jr., along withElizabeth (Sturman) Ransdell aredocumented in a Deed filed in Fauquier County, dated September 6, 1761 (#78).The Deed is for lands conveyed by the trustees of Robert Vaulx, Parish of Washington, Westmoreland County, to Thomas Chilton of Cople Parish, Westmoreland County; land inFauquier, formerly Prince William. The deed is signed by Augustine Washington,Edward Ransdell, and William Bernard; as trust­ees. Witnesses were; Foxhall Sturman, Elizabeth Ransdell, Thomas Chilton,Jr., and Edward Ransdell, Jr. The document proves that Edward Ransdell, Jr. wasof age in 1761. That valid­ates the contention that his parents married circa1738.\n\nFrom advertisements placed in theVirginia Gazette, October 17 and October 31, 1771, it is known that EdwardRansdell, Jr. wasDeputy Sheriff of Westmoreland at that time (#79).\n\nElizabeth (Ransdell) (Davenport) Steptoe, daughter ofEdward and Elizabeth (Sturman) Ransdell,survived her two husbands and died sans progeny, in 1802. Her only two childrenwere by Dr. George Steptoe. Both died about the time of his death, 1784(#80).\n\nFrom a history of Westmoreland County welearn James Davenport and Elizabeth Ransdell, daughter of Edward and Elizabeth (Sturman) Ransdell, were married in May, 1769. He was Clerk of Westmoreland County,and a \"warm friend of Richard Henry Lee\" who signed The Declaration of Independ­ence.\"Davenport died in 1777. His widow married second, her kinsman, Dr. GeorgeSteptoe, and lived at `Windsor' (the former estate ofher father, wkr). Dr. Steptoe was a half-brother to the wife of Thomas LudwellLee and to Mrs. Philip Ludwell Lee of `Stratford' and to Mrs. Samuel Washing­ton, wife of thebrother of General George Washington. Dr. Steptoe died in 1784, and Elizabeth'stwo children about the same time. She made her Will Sept. 1, 1801 proved April16, 1802. She left 350 acres of the `Windsor' tract to Samuel Templeman.\" (#81).Samuel Templeman was the husband of Elizabeth (Ransdell) (Davenport) Steptoe'sfirst cousin, Sibella (Peirce) Templeman,daughter of Joseph and Sarah Elliott (Ransdell) Peirce (previously cited.). JosephPeirce was among the first members of the Baptist Church, and, upon his death,freed a large number of slaves (#82).\n\nElizabeth (Sturman) Ransdell, widow ofEdward of the fourth generation, either died intestate or remarried. I know ofno record of her Will. It is known that she was still Mrs. Ransdell followingthe death of her daughter's first husband, James Davenport. She was soidentified in an advertisement to sell property from his estate, in theVirginia Gazette, October 17, 1777 (#83). It is my opinion that she neverremarried.\n\nPrior to his death, Edward Ransdell of the fourth generation added to hisWestmoreland holdings. He held 340 acres in Westmoreland upon the death of hisfather in 1758 -- the land was adjacent to the present County seat, Montross(#84). On December 1, 1762, Edward purchased an additional unknown quantity ofland. (The actual records must state the quantity, I haven't seen them.) Thepurchase was made from Richard Lee and wife Grace, of Maryland; William Booth and wife Elizabeth, of Westmoreland; and,Augustine and Ann Washington, of Westmoreland. The name of James Davenport, Clerk of the Court, also appears. Acknowl­edgmentwas made in Charles County, Maryland, May 21, 1764 (#85). The purchase appears to bepart of a plan to consolidate his hold­ings. In 1761, he sold to William Taylor of Westmore­land, a portion of his lands inStafford (#86). Additional land, apparently from the same Stafford tract wassold to a William Taylor, by an Edward Ransdell, November 16, 1809 (to becited). The second William Taylor is thought to be the son of the WilliamTaylor making the purchase in 1761. The later Edward Ransdell is thought to bethe son of William Ransdell of the fourth generation, and Mary (Chilton) Ransdell(previously cited).\n\nEdward Ransdell of the fourth generation must have taken thedeath of his only son very hard. The advertise­ment he placed in the VirginiaGazette is filled with pathos. He lived less than a year after that. In hisWill, dated June 19, 1773, (less than four months after his son's death) heleaves his Plantation to his wife, Elizabeth, \"to do as she pleases withit.\" Others named in his Will are (daughter) Elizabeth Davenport, wife of James Davenport; (brothers) Whartonand William (Ransdell); (nephew) Ransdell Peirce, son of Joseph Peirce; (nephews) PresleyRansdell, son of brother Wharton; and Edward Rans­dell, son of brother William.\"if daughter die, old Philip and Sarah shall not be carried out of thisCounty, but shall choose yearly who they shall serve.\" He had two Plantations; nephews, Edward andPresley, were made residuary legatees of these, in case his daughter,Elizabeth, should die without a child. He mentions \"friend\" JosephPeirce and Sarah, his wife. To Mr. Richard Parker, five Pounds(perhaps Shillings), for services. His wife, Elizabeth, was named Executor.Witnesses were; Mary Purcell, Thomas Thompson, and RichardParker. Probated Nov. 13, 1773 (previously cited).\n\nThere is some indication that EdwardRansdell, Jr. may have married, although no mention ofhis wife or any children is made in his father's Will. In 1778, in the Will ofNicholas Muse, of West­moreland, the following are named;(wife) Elizabeth, (sons) Jeremiah, Walker, Jesse, (daughters) Penelope Muse, ElizabethWashington, Mary Randall (possibly Ransdell), and Ann Washington,(brother) Daniel Muse (#87). There is known to have been a Randall family inWestmoreland. However, at least one other Rans­dell document shows a socialconnec­tion to the Muse family, and it is possible that Mary, the daughter ofNicholas Muse, was the widow of Edward Ransdell, Jr. In his bereave­ment,Edward Ransdell of the fourth generation may have excluded her from his Will;for reasons we will never understand.\n\nWharton Ransdell of the fourth generation, the second son ofWharton and Ursula (Presley) Ransdell,married, in Richmond County, Virginia, by December 3, 1744, Margaret Barrow, the daughterof Edward and Elizabeth (Minor) Barrow (#88).As previously stated, I am descended from Wharton and Margaret (Barrow)Ransdell, and a full section on them will be provided.\n\nMargaret Barrow was the second of three children. She had an older brother, John Barrow, whomarried Margaret Ball, the daughterof Samuel and Anna Catherine (Tayloe) Ball. They lived in Culpeper County,Virginia (#89). Samuel Ball was the sonof William Ball of Lancaster County. Samuel Ball's grandfather was WilliamBall, the progenitor of the Ball family of Lancaster. Joseph Ball, SamuelBall's uncle, was the father, by his second wife, of Mary (Ball) Washington, the mother of General George Washing­ton,First President of the United States (#90). That relationship is significantlater. Margaret (Barrow) Ransdell's youngersister, Elizabeth Barrow, married, in 1747, William Lightfoot (also, #89).\n\nMargaret (Barrow) Ransdell's paternalgrandparents were Edward Barrow and Anne (Stone) (Metcalf) Barrow. Anne(Stone) (Metcalf) Barrow's father was Col. John Stone, and her mother was Sarah(Fleet) (Walker) Stone, thewidow of Henry Fleet -- the man who led the Calverts to the Potomac river tosettle Maryland. Following the death of Colonel John Stone, by a number ofyears, there was litigation between the Metcalf and Barrow children of Anne(Stone) (Metcalf) Barrow, over the estate of their grandfather, Colonel JohnStone. That litigation became the basis for an historic decision, and is foundin Virginia Colonial Decis­ions, Barradall's Reports,pages B232-B239.\n\nWilliam Ransdell of the fourth generation, the remain­ing sonof Wharton and Ursula (Presley) Ransdell,married circa 1744, Mary Chilton, born 1724. Her parents were Major Thomas andJemima (Cooke) Chilton of Westmoreland County -- nearneighbors of Wharton and Ursula (Presley) Ransdell. Major Thomas Chilton wasthe son of John Chilton of \"Currio­man\", Westmoreland County. Jemima (Cooke) Chilton was the daughter ofMordecai Cooke of Gloucester County. Major Thomas Chilton inherited hisfather's Westmoreland property, and was charged with 1300 acres on the Westmore­landrent roll in 1740. Both the Chilton and Cooke families are extremely welldocumented. Major Thomas Chilton andhis son, also Thomas Chilton, each held the office of Sheriff of Westmoreland(#91).\n\nThrough her mother, Jemima (Cooke) Chilton, Mary(Chilton) Ransdell's lineage hasbeen traced to Edward III, King of England. That is not surprising. A numberof the families in the Northern Neck of Virginia migrated from England duringand immediately following the English Civil War. Among them were knowndescendants of the British Royal family; principally descendants through thefemale lines of the Plantagenets. I am aware of a similar claim to Royalancestry, through a later connect­ing family, for my line of the Ransdellfamily; but am reluctant to credit it without first satisfying myself that itis accurate. Far too many individuals have reached for this connec­tion toRoyalty. Some with more zeal than insight.\n\nSometime following their marriage,William and Mary (Chilton) Ransdell moved to what was, or later became, FauquierCounty. Fauquier County was formed from Prince William in 1759 (#92).\n\nOn March 23, 1760, William Ransdell and Mary, his wife, of Parish of Hamilton,and County of Fauquier, sold to Robert Ashby, 200 acres, being part of a largertract purchased by Wharton Ransdell, deceased, of Burgess, of LancasterCounty. No witnesses. Signed by William and Mary Ransdell (#93). That is asignificant document later.\n\nWilliam Ransdell of the fourth generation is known to haveserved as an Officer in the Fauquier County Militia under the command ofCaptain William Edmonds, in the Frenchand Indian War (#94). (That is one of the many indications of the closeproximity of the Ransdell and Edmonds families that I referred to earlier.)William and Mary (Chilton) Ransdell'seldest son, Wharton later received a land warrant for his father's service inthe French and Indian War (#95). He sold part, or all of that land in 1778(#96). (The evidence supporting that last statement is fragile, and needsfurther valida­tion. However, I believe it to be accurate -- wkr.)\n\nYou will recall that William Ransdell of the fourth generation had received twoseparate tracts of land from his father, Wharton. The first was 350 acres onCedar Run, in 1749. The second was a tract of land near \"LittleCobbler\" Mountain, in his father's Will, 1758. Both of the tracts werelater in Fauquier County (#97).\n\nOn July 27, 1769, William Ransdell placed an ad in the Virginia Gazette, statinghis place of residence as being located \"near Fauquier Courthouse\"(#98). He again placed an ad in the same newspaper, Feb. 4, 1773, offering tosell \"4 to 500 acres\" on Cedar Run -- Pignut soil. \"See JohnChilton, nearpremises\" (#99). John Chilton was the younger brother of Mary (Chilton)Ransdell (#100). William and Mary (Chilton) Ransdell apparently were stillresiding near Fauquier Courthouse at this latter date (1773).\n\nIn 1765, Major Thomas Chilton, father of Mary (Chilton) Ransdell, died. His Will names; (son) Thomas,(daughter) Mary Randall -- this spelling is known to be wrong, (grand­son)Chilton Randell -- also misspelled, (daughter) Hannah Sturman,(granddaughter) Jemima Sturman, (sons) William, John, Charles, and Stephen(#101). (It is necessary to note that the misspellings recorded are not due toerror on the part of those who wrote the original document. They certainly knewhow to spell the name. The errors are due to a misinterpretation of thecursive. The Ransdell name is not a familiar one, and is commonly mistaken forRandall or some variation of that better known name, or others. A few errors,now and then, is a small price to pay. Think how impossible this writing wouldhave been if our name was Smith and was always clearly written.)\n\nAt the time of his death, Major ThomasChilton owned large tracts of land in Westmoreland,Fauquier, and Stafford Counties. Among his personal property was listedsixty-two slaves (#102).\n\nOn July 3, 1776, William Ransdell of the fourth genera­tion wrote his Will. Itwas probated October 29, 1776 (#103). I do not know if William Ransdell servedin the Revolution. I do know that his younger brother-in-law, Capt. JohnChilton, was killed atthe battle of Brandywine (#104). You will recall that William Ransdell sawservice as an Officer in the French and Indian War. In 1773, he would have beenabout fifty years old. It is unlikely that he would have seen service in theRevolution. It is known that a number of his sons were Officers in the Revolu­tion.One of them, Captain Thomas Ransdell, served for the full duration. As anOfficer of the Continental Line, Captain Thomas Ransdell was eligible to be,and became, a Charter Member of the Virgin­ia Chapter of the Society of theCincinnati (#105).\n\nIn his Will, William Ransdell of the fourth genera­tion left his estate toMary (Chilton) Ransdell forher life, and identified the following children:\n\nWharton -- appar­ently the eldestson. He is thought to have never married (#106).\n\nThomas-- previously mentioned as Captain Thomas. His brother, Chilton Ransdell, was later theGuardian of the two known children of Captain Thomas Ransdell. These children,John and Marcia, received a pension for their father's military service. Theywere still minors circa 1807 (#107).\n\nWilliam-- believed by some to have moved to Mercer County, Ky., about 1795. I haveextreme difficulty in agreeing with that conten­tion. There are too many indica­tionsthat the Mercer County Ransdell family descends from John of the thirdgeneration. The date of birth of William Ransdell of Orange and later Mercer,appears to predate the date of marriage of William and Mary (Chilton) Ransdell(#108). Add to that the fact that the eldest son of William and Mary (Chilton)Ransdell does not appear to have been named William. Thus placing the date of birth of William, son of William andMary (Chilton) Ransdell, even later. If my belief is correct, this William diedin Fauquier or moved elsewhere. I have no further proven record of him.\n\nEdward-- mentioned in the Will of Edward Ransdell of the fourth generation. Possibly inherit­edlands in Westmore­land and Stafford following the death of Elizabeth (Rans­dell)(Davenport) Steptoe, in 1802. You will recall, Edward, son of brotherWilliam, was named as a residuary legatee in the Will of Edward of the fourthgeneration. I searched for, but was unable to locate the Will of Eliza­beth(Ransdell) (Davenport) Steptoe. I am sure that was a failing on my part. I was rushed at the time, and a renewedeffort should be more fruitful. As previously mentioned, this is possibly theEdward Ransdell who sold land to William Taylor in Stafford County, Va., in 1809 (to becited).\n\nChilton-- mentioned in the Will of his grandfather, Major Thomas Chilton, and verywell documented by one of his descendents (#109).\n\nWharton,Thomas, and William were named Executors. Witnesses were; Benjamin Ashby, JohnMarshall, and JohnRichie. No daughtersor other sons were mentioned.\n\nIt is reported (by Dorman, in TheVirginia Genealogist) that a son named Stephen was born to William and Mary(Chilton) Ransdell (#110). Stephen was not mentioned in WilliamRansdell's Will, and the age of Mary (Chilton) Ransdell in 1773, rules out aposthumous child by that name. There was a Stephen Ransdell (#111). I am of theopinion he was a member of the sixth generation. The purported son, Stephen, isnamed as such in a letter written in 1843, by Mark Chilton, the youngest son ofCharles Chilton, the youngest son of Major Thomas Chilton of Westmoreland(#112). Mark Chilton was writing from Missouri, to his kinsman, Robert Chilton,who was one of the fourteen children of William Chilton, son of William Chil­tonthe second son of Major Thomas Chilton of Westmoreland (#113). Mark Chiltonprefixed his letter by stating that he was writing from hearsay, about factsthat had occurred a generation earlier. (My own experience shows how unreliablethat type of family lore tends to be.) The letter may never have come to lightif Robert Chilton had not achieved fame as a General, and adjutant to Robert E.Lee, in the CivilWar (#114). In any event, Mark Chilton denigrated Stephen and Ursula Ransdell,whom he named as a son and daughter of William and Mary (Chilton) Ransdell. Aspreviously stated, a Stephen Ransdell did exist and William and Mary (Chilton)Ransdell may very readily have named a daughter for William Ransdell's mother,Ursula (Presley) Ransdell. Hiscomment was, \"everyone was quite respectable, other than Stephen andUrsula\", or words to that effect, whatever that means.\n\nI don't know who Stephen Ransdell was. If I had to make a wild guess, I wouldsearch for him as a son of Thomas Ransdell, Jr. and Mary (Ransdell) Ransdell,who were married in 1786, and will be cited later. Mark Chilton, the writer of the letter, was born in 1786(#115), and was only two years old when Mary (Chilton) Ransdell died in 1788(#116). He credits part of his information to an \"aunt Mary Rans­dell\"(#117). His \"aunt Mary Ransdell\" could not have been Mary (Chilton)Ransdell. The title appears to be an honor­ary one for Mary (Ransdell) Ransdellwho most certainly would not have denigrated Stephen Ransdell if he were herson. The denigrating comments appear to be from Mark Chilton's own memory ofevents that happened later. At another point in the letter, he cited ChiltonRansdell as Charles Ransdell (Or the printed copy of the letter makes thiserror) and after stating that Mary (Chilton) Ransdell had six sons, he namesonly five -- failing to name Edward. It is apparent that he did not proof hisletter before posting it. One more error would not surprise me.\n\nI have no idea who Ursula Ransdell was. (The name Ursula may have later appearedin the family as Sally. Thus causing it to be confused with Sarah.) There wasan Ursula Ransdell, who appears briefly in the records of Missouri, about MarkChilton's time. Idon't know if she was born a Ransdell, or not. I have never found the time topursue her. She had several children surnamed Ransdell, as I recall -- thoughvery dimly. I also dimly recall she was old enough to have been older than MarkChilton [the information came to me from my first cousin, John Charles Harris, son ofKatherine (Ransdell) Harris, and I don't have the reference at hand. However,it should be readily found in the U.S. Census for Missouri, 1850 or later.] Mypoint is; if its not in the records, you have to take it with a grain of salt.If you really want the truth, you have to dig for it. It's buried somewhere.Until I find an official record indicating that Stephen and Ursula Ransdellwere the Children of William and Mary (Chilton) Ransdell, I intend to assumethey were not.\n\nIt is known that William and Mary(Chilton) Ransdell must have had daughters. One of them, in myopinion, was Hannah Ransdell (1758-1810), who married William Moore in Fauquier 1779, and later moved to Kentucky(#118). Her marriage bond was signed by Wharton Ransdell -- I believe he washer eldest brother. Had Hannah Rans­dell been a daughter of Wharton Ransdell ofthe fourth generation, as some have contended, I believe she would have beenmentioned in her father's Will. It is known that she was living at the time itwas written. I am also biased by the fact that Mary (Chil­ton) Ransdell had a sister,Hannah (Chilton) Sturman.\n\nKentucky Court of Appeals Deed Book, Vol.II, contains a very enlightening document about the immediate family into whichHannah (Ransdell) Moore married. On page 219, it gives an Indenturedated March 23, 1808. Names included in this Indenture are: William Moore ofFayette County, Kentucky, and Hannah Moore, his wife; Henson Moore and AnneMoore, his wife; Mary Simpson; Thomas Chinn and Ann Chinn, his wife; Cuthbert Musgrove and Elizabeth Musgrove, his wife; David Bryan and Sarah Bryan, his wife; and Samuel Mooreand Malinda Moore, his wife; heirs and legal repre­sentatives of Samuel Moore,deceased, to William McGinnis of Mercer County, Kentucky, for 188 pounds... 150 acres. Recorded March 23, 1808,by the Kentucky Court of Appeals. The document apparently identifies thefather-in-law of Hannah Moore, and William Moore's brothers and sisters. [Thedocument also provides a possible source of research to determine how theMiddle name Chinn, came into the family of a John Ransdell, born circa 1782,who will be mentioned in a later section. I mention this now, only for thebenefit of his descendants, who may read this family history and desire torethink a segment of their own family history which has unfortunately mistakenJohn Ransdell, circa 1782, to be a descendant of Wharton and Margaret (Barrow) Ransdell. Itis my belief, John Ransdell, circa 1782, is descended from William and Mary(Chilton) Ransdell,although I have no specific knowledge on which that belief is solidly based. Ido have specific knowledge, which will be cited, that John Ransdell, circa1782, is not the John Ransdell with whom he is confused -- wkr.]\n\nAnother daughter of William and Mary(Chilton) Rans­dell, in myopinion, was Mary Ransdell, who married Thomas Ransdell, Jr. in 1786 (#119).[This is the Mary (Ransdell) Ransdell mentioned earlier.] I believe her olderbrother, Thomas Ransdell, Sr. (alias, Captain Thomas Ransdell) signed hermarriage bond. It is my contention that Captain Thomas Ransdell was older thanThomas Ransdell, the son of Wharton and Margaret (Barrow) Ransdell.That is based upon the given name of Mary (Chilton) Ransdell's father, MajorThomas Chilton. The practice of the day was to name an elder son for themother's father. The order of listing of William and Mary (Chilton) Ransdell'schildren, in every document, bears that out.\n\nI possess far more records on this branchof the family, but they do not lend themselves to this writing. I have alreadygone far beyond my original intention.\n\nWHARTONRANSDELL OF THE FOURTH GENERATION.\n\nAs previously stated, Wharton Ransdell of the fourth generation married, by December3, 1744, Margaret Barrow. The nextrecord we have of them (#120), is the Register of Overwharton Parish, StaffordCounty, Virginia. From that register, we know the names and dates of birth ofthree of their children; Elizabeth(1746), Edward (1748), and Wharton (1750). [The Overwharton register continueduntil 1758. Recorded within thisregister also, is the informa­tion that two members of the Ransdell family,Edward and Wharton, were owners of slaves within the Parish. Wharton of thefourth generation is thought to be the Wharton so listed. The identity ofEdward is open for debate. It is my opinion that this was Edward of the fourthgenera­tion, son of Wharton and Ursula (Presley) Ransdell. If so, he must have acquiredadditional land of his own or utilized land owned by his father.] It is alsoknown, from Judge Embry's Abstracts,that between 1747 and 1754, two Ransdell land transactions were recorded inStaf­ford County. They were in the Old General Index, and the book is lost. Onetransaction was from Ransdell to Ransdell. The other, was Ransdell to George. Ido not know what the transactions mean. It is possible that Wharton andMargaret (Barrow) Ransdell received land in Stafford from her family, and hesold that prior to moving to Prince William -- where he is known to have beenlater (to be cited). (I have long intended to check this theory out, byexamining the Barrow documents in Richmond County. But, to date, have failed to do so.)\n\nSometime between the birth of their thirdchild (1750) and the birth of their next child, Wharton and Margaret (Barrow) Ransdell are believed to have moved to that portion ofPrince William County that was later to become Fauquier.\n\nYou will recall, Wharton Ransdell of the third genera­tion gave his two youngersons, Wharton and William, land in Prince William in 1749 (previously cited).It appears most probable that Wharton and Margaret (Barrow) Ransdellmoved to that land, on Cedar Run, after the birth of their son, Wharton, in1750.\n\nIn 1752, Wharton Ransdell, thought to beWharton of the fourth generation, purchased 250 acres in Prince William Countyfrom Rev. Lawrence deButts of Parish of St. Mary's, in Maryland (#121).Reverend Lawrence deButts is known to have, prior to this time, been assignedto Washington Parish, Westmoreland. He also preached atCople Parish, in Westmoreland, and Farnham Parish, in Richmond County (#122).Both Wharton of the third generation, and Wharton of the fourth generation,would have known him. I favor this purchase being made by Wharton of the fourthgeneration, because it is known that he made other purchases of land in thevicinity of this tract after the death of his father (to be cited) and I haveno knowledge of his having receiv­ed this deButts land from his father. Thepurchase of this deButts land raises the question of whether Wharton andMargaret (Barrow) Ransdell thenmoved from the land on Cedar Run. I believe they did not. On May 23, 1757, it is recorded that Wharton Ransdellwas a Vestryman of the Parish of Hamilton, Prince William County; Rev. JohnBrunskill, Clerk (#123). Reverend John Brunskill is known to have served two churches in HamiltonParish (#124). His upper church was the nearer to Cedar Run. At the headwaterof Cedar Run was the \"Ordinary\" of George Neavill (#125). George Neavill is also named, withWharton Ransdell, as a Vestryman of Hamilton Parish in 1757. Although I have nocertain knowledge of it, the deButts land seems to have been purchased inanticipation of future needs. There is no indication that it had beenimproved. Reverend Lawrence deButts wasin Maryland, and there is no record of him having served in Prince William.(All of that takes on additional significance later.)\n\nOn April 5, 1759, the County of Fauquierwas formed from the Hamilton Parish territory of Prince William County. WhartonRansdell was named among those eligible to be sworn asmembers of the first Commission of Peace (Gentlemen Justices) (#126). There wasa dispute over where the County Courthouse was to be built. The first FauquierCounty meeting was held near Elk Run Church (served by Rev. Brun­skill). The Colonypoliticians of the day overruled the preference of members of the new FauquierCounty Court, and a site in Fauquier, on the property of Richard Henry Lee of Westmoreland, was designated as thelocation where Fauquier Courthouse was to be built. It is my recollection,although I do not have a copy of the verifying document and no longer rememberits specific source, that Wharton Ransdell was not administered the oath forsome time; because of his resistance to that decision. His reason being; thedistance the new site was from his place of residence. I am recalling detailfrom many years ago, before I began making copies of signifi­cant documents,and I am certainly subject to being wrong. But, I do not believe so. I thinkhis reluctance is part of the reason I have long felt the estate of Wharton andMargaret (Barrow) Ransdellremained on Cedar Run.\n\nOn December 17, 1762, CadwalladerSlaughter and Eliza­beth Rans­dell were married; consent by Wharton Ransdell(#127). Elizabeth was 16 years old. She was born in Over­wharton Parish,Stafford County, in 1746 (previously cited). Cadwallader Slaughter latersettled in Kentucky, and was one of the Founding Fathers of Louisville -- theCherokee Triangle is now located on Slaughter land, and Ransdell Avenue derivesits name from this connection.\n\nIn April of 1765, Wharton Ransdell purchased 195 acres in Fauquier County fromJohn Balendine (#128). Witnesses were; James Scott, Jr., William Ransdell, John Bell, Gustav­us Scott, and John Chilton. It was partof the tract patented to Rev. Lawrence deButts. You will recall, Wharton hadpurchased 250 acres from Rev. deButts in 1752.\n\nIn August of 1765, Wharton Ransdell purchased another 195 acres in the samelocale from John Balendine of Fairfax (#129). The land was shown as partof a tract of 2,864 acres patented to Reverend Lawrence deButts of Maryland, toSamuel deButts, brother, then to Barnaby Egan, then toBalendine.\n\nOn June 27, 1771, Wharton and MargaretRansdell sold to John Churchill, land inFauquier, on both sides Cedar Run (#130). (John Churchill was a member of theChurchill family that later settled in Louisville, Kentucky -- Churchill Downs,home of the Kentucky Derby, derives its name from them. -- wkr)\n\nOn September 14, 1771, Wharton Ransdell purchased land from John deButts of Anne ArundelCounty, Maryland. Witness­es were;James Scott, ElizabethScott, William Ransdell, and Edwin Fielding (#131).\n\nRecorded later in 1771, is the Deed toland purchased by Wharton Ransdell from Archibald and Abigail Allen (#132). This purchase is in the samelocality, and is shown to corner on Thomas Barber. Witnesseswere; James Scott, Jr., RandolphSpicer, and GeorgeRogers.\n\nYou will recall that the land Wharton Ransdell of the third generation purchased in PrinceWilliam County, and later gave to his younger sons, was purchased from CaptainThomas Barber. Thatindicates that all of Wharton Ransdell's land transactions, just listed, werein this same locale -- in the vicinity of Cedar Run.\n\nOn December 26, 1775, Chandler Fowke, Parish of Hamil­ton, was apprenticed toWharton Ransdell, Parish of Leeds, Fauquier County (#133). Thisis thought to be Wharton of the fourth generation. His Will shows him as beingof Leeds Parish, and by late 1775 his sons had begun to go, or were prepar­ingto go, to fight in the Revolution. By this date, Fauquier County had been splitinto two Parishes. Leeds Parish was in the Northern section of the County, andHamilton Parish was in its Southern section. To the North of Fauquier, abuttingLeeds Parish, was, and is, Loudoun County. That fact is important later. Itindicates that Wharton Ransdell of the fourth generation, and his family, livedvery near Loudoun County.\n\nFollowing the death of William Ransdell of the fourth generation in 1776, it is nolonger easy to distinguish the transactions of Wharton Ransdell of the fourthgeneration, from those of Wharton Ransdell, eldest son of William Ransdell ofthe fourth generation.\n\nIt is my belief that the next series ofland transac­tions were those of Wharton Ransdell of the fifth genera­tion, son of William. Youwill recall that a land Warrant had been issued to Wharton Ransdell, eldest sonof William and Mary (Chilton) Ransdell, forhis father's service during the French and Indian War. I believe Wharton of thefifth generation, eldest son of William, sold that land in 1778.\n\nSeptember 26, 1778, Wharton Ransdell to Robert Sanders, land inFauquier, on North end of Pon? Mt., Peyton's line, no witnesses, wife did notsign (#134). He sells part of same tract -- to Newhouse (#135).\n\nSeptember 28, 1778, Wharton Ransdell to Joseph Smith, land inFauquier, no Witnesses, wife did not sign (#136).\n\nNovember 1, 1779, Wharton Ransdell, Jr. sells land in Fauquier on John Churchill's line, now inpossession of John Ransdell, son of Wharton Ransdell. No wife signs. Witnesses;William Kenton, Robert Hanem, Benjamin Hamrick (#137). Again, this appears at first examin­ationto be Wharton Ransdell, son of William. If so, I do not know why his mother wasnot required to sign this Deed. Mary (Chil­ton) Ransdell was to have her husband's estateduring her life, and should have been a party to the Deed if this was part ofher husband's estate. It is known that she was still living at this date (prev­iouslycited). However, upon closer examina­tion, it appears that this is a sale ofland by Wharton of the fourth generation, and the identi­fier should be Sr.,not Jr. If so, that indicates thatMargaret (Barrow) Ransdell was dead by this date. Or, it mightbe the sale of land by Wharton, the son of Wharton and Margaret (Barrow)Ransdell. He was born in 1750, and could have been the purchaser of one of theprevious­ly cited tracts, purchas­ed in 1771, that was attributed to hisfather. In any event, the John Ransdell cited as being in possession of theland has to be John Ransdell, born circa 1754, the son of Wharton and Margaret(Barrow) Ransdell. He could not possibly be anyone else. I am descended fromJohn Ransdell, son of Wharton Ransdell of the fourth generation. A full sectionon him will be provided.\n\nOn January 16, 1782, Wharton Ransdell and Mary Morehead were married. Wharton Ransdell and Turner Morehead signed the bond. Turner Morehead wasthe brother of Mary Morehead. Her father was Charles Morehead (#138).\n\nOn November 30, 1782, Wharton Ransdell, Jr., son and heir to William Ransdell, andMary (Chilton) Ransdell, widow, sold land to Thomas Digges -- \"part of land which was purchased byWharton Rans­dell for the use of said William Ransdell, deceased\" (#139).(The Wharton Ransdell who made the initial purchase was apparently WhartonRansdell of the third generation. This is a portion of the land he gave to hisson, William, in 1749.) Signed by; Wharton Ransdell and Mary Ransdell. Witnesses;Charles Chilton, John Metcalfe, William Stewart, and JohnKennedy. As is clearlystated, this is Wharton, son of William of the fourth generation. He is sellinga portion or all of his share of the land received in his father's Will, dated1776. As contended earlier, Mary (Chilton) Ransdell was required to be a partyto this Deed, in order to release her dower rights; and, based upon thisrequirement in this Deed, I believe the earlier Deed for land in the\"possession of John Ransdell\", was from Wharton Ransdell of thefourth genera­tion. (In the cursive of this period, Sr. and Jr. are oftendifficult to distinguish.)\n\nOctober 27, 1783, Thomas Ransdell of Fauquier to Aquilla Dyson, land adjoining Wharton Ransdell, Jr., nowitnesses, no wife (#140). This is Captain Thomas Rans­dell home from the war;selling his por­tion. His mother should have signed, but didn't. Maybe she was already dead. The approximatedate of her death, 1788, is derived from the Fauquier County tax lists. Thesecould have been continued in her name for several years, in error.\n\nJuly 6, 1784, Wharton Ransdell, Gentleman, ofFauquier, to Thomas Digges, land on whichJohn Ransdell, son of said Wharton now lives, bounded by Petit, Churchill, Stewart, and Digges.No wife signs. Witnesses; Gust. B. Horner, Thomas Ray, and EdwardDigges (#141). Margaret (Barrow) Ransdell isnow definitely dead. The land sold in 1779 was \"in possession\" ofJohn Ransdell. The 1779 Deed did not state that it was the land on which JohnRansdell lived that was being conveyed. Now, the land \"where helives\" is sold. This is a fine, but meaningful distinction. It appears,that with his father's blessing, John Ransdell was preparing to depart forKentucky; where he is known to have been by 1788 (to be cited), and may havebeen by late 1784.\n\nJune 18, 1785, Henry Lee, Jr. ofWestmoreland County, in debt to Wharton Ransdell of Fauquier. Bond to indemnify Ransdell(#142). I do not know what that means.\n\nJanuary 7, 1786, Wharton Ransdell of the fourth genera­tion wrote his Will,probated July 24, 1786 (#143). In it, he named the following: (children)William Ransdell, Anne Morehead, MargaretRansdell, Sarah Ransdell, Thomas, Edward, John, Wharton; (grandsons) CharlesMorehead Ransdell and Wharton Ransdell; (son-in-law) Cadwallader Slaughter; (Executors)Charles Chilton, Elias Edmonds, ThomasRansdell, Sr., William Ransdell, Jr., and Thomas Ransdell, Jr. Witnesses were;Nathaniel Gray, John Green, Jr., DanielGray, Wharton Ransdell, and Enoch K. Withers.\n\nFrom the preceding it can be seen thatWharton Rans­dell did not name his children in the order oftheir birth, and his daughter Elizabeth, who married Cadwallader Slaught­er, was dead. Itis known that his son Wharton, who is thought to be the father of the twograndsons named in the Will (Charles Morehead Ransdell and Wharton Ransdell) also diedbefore the Will was probated. Presley,the known son of Wharton and Margaret (Barrow) Ransdell, wasnot named. It is thought that he was also dead by this date. It is known thatAnne (Ransdell) Morehead was the wife of Turner Morehead (#144). Of the remaining children;William, Margaret, Sarah, Thomas, Edward, and John -- only Edward and Johnappear to have been married. Neither are named as an Executor, and this leavesme with the impression that both were elsewhere. As previously stated, we knowJohn was in Kentucky by 1788, possibly by 1784.\n\nThe Will instructs that 1000 acres ofland is to be sold, and half of the money received is to go to Thomas (with 20pounds reserved for the education of the two named grandsons). The other halfof the money is to be equally divided between; William, Anne Morehead, Margaret, andSarah. It is stipulated; \"if, either my sons William Ransdell, or ThomasRansdell, or my daughter Sarah Ransdell should die without lawful issue, their estatebe equally divided between the surviving heirs of William, Thomas, AnneMorehead, and Margaret Ransdell\". That is strange, because we know thatAnne Morehead was married and had children by this date (#145). But Margaretappears to be unmarried. Perhaps the abstract is in error, and Margaret shouldhave been included with William, Thomas, and Sarah, as recipient of herinheritance contingent upon it passing on to the heirs of those named. Anotherpossibility is; Margaret too, was already married -- to one of the sons ofWilliam and Mary (Chilton) Ransdell. A likely candidate for her hus­bandwould be Captain Thomas Ransdell, who was named an Executor as Thomas Ransdell,Sr. She may even have been pregnant when her father's Will was drawn. If so,that would account for Captain Thomas Rans­dell's children coming of age, circa1807. As can be seen, there are any number of scenarios that can be played.But, one thing is certain; there was a reason for the way the Will was drafted.Poor Sarah looks as if everyone had given up hope of her ever getting ahusband. Yet, that is exactly what she did.\n\nOn September 26, 1786, Sally Ransdell married Nathaniel Gray, one of herfather's Executors. Nathaniel Gray and Charles Morehead signed the bond (#146).\n\nOn November 18, 1786, Thomas Ransdell, Jr. married Mary Ransdell. The bond wassigned by Thomas Ransdell, Sr. and Thomas Ransdell, Jr. (#147). This appears tobe the son of Wharton and Margaret (Barrow) Ransdell marrying the daugh­ter of Williamand Mary (Chilton) Ransdell (aspreviously stated). I have repeated this at this point, to place it in itsproper chronological order and illustrate the fact that Wharton and Margaret(Barrow) Ransdell did not have a daughter named Mary. It appears highlyprobable that Thomas Ransdell, Jr. was the son of Wharton and Margaret (Barrow)Ransdell, and married his first cousin, Mary Ransdell, following his father'sdeath. That is consistent with my contention that Capt. Thomas Ransdell was theolder of the two Ransdell men bearing the name Thomas. There are a number ofindica­tions that is an accurate conclusion.\n\nSarah (Ransdell) Gray may have died within a few years. On March18, 1789, a Nathaniel Gray married Betsy Ransdell. The bond was signed byNathaniel Gray and Thomas Ransdell (#148). Of course, this could have been adifferent Nathan­iel Gray. Betsy was probably a daughter of William and Mary(Chilton) Ransdell.Mark Chilton's letter (previously cited) gives the name of a"
