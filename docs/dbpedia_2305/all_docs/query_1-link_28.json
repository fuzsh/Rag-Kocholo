        "text": "Hello folks.After a short break,I’m back with a surprise treat for you.It has been around a month since my last post “Eravikulam National Park-In Search of Nilgiri Tahr” has been published.After publishing the post,I left it without publicising that the feedbacks and the views received by the post is very less compared to my previous posts.However,in the recent days,it has been receiving quite a considerable number of views.On 30 June,my posts have been viewed a record number of times-68.Eventhough,the most recent one haven’t got much views,my earlier posts like “The Train to Kangra Valley”,”Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram-Pancha Rathas”,”The Qutb Shahi Monuments of Hyderabad”,”Kerala’s Contribution to India’s World Heritage List” and others have been receiving a large number of views.I am happy that my posts are being viewed and rated even after months they were published.And,not to forget,WhatsApp has been quite influential in reaching out the posts to more and more people.This will also be my first major post in the month of July.The month is very special to me.Main reason being it’s my month of birth and the second reason being it’s also the birth month of my best friend,which means double delight in this month for me.Eventhough,I hadn’t posted anything here,I have been regularly noticing my viewers’ activities in the blog.The main reason I couldn’t involve myself deeply in the blog was “Football”.It’s the time of the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and I was busy myself watching the matches and reviewing them on Facebook.You guys may remember me putting a post on “The Road To Russia”.That was at the beginning of the qualification process to the World Cup back in 2016.How time went so fast.\n\nComing back to the present,India is a country of diverse culture and landscape.Every place in India will be different.There are 22 official languages and an infinite number of local languages.Eventhough,there is a difference in everything,they all are part of a common Indian culture and they have a unique universal value.Indians have witnessed several dynasties and rulers ruling over the country during various periods of time and they have also left behind some symbols of their rule.I have talked about the Pallava architecture of Mahabalipuram recently.Before,I talked about the Qutb Shahi monuments of Hyderabad,the Mughal architecture of Fatehpur Sikri,the evolving Chalukya architecture of Badami-Pattadakal-Aihole and there is the Vijayanagara architecture of Hampi still pending to be published.All these are the remains of the architectural brilliance of various dynasties that ruled over the country.They all have received International recognitions too.Today,I’m going to take you on a tour to one of the famous architectural wonders of India and a symbol of the Chola architecture-the Brihadisvara Temple of Thanjavur or Tanjore.It’s one of the famous temple in South India known for its style of architecture and in fact,one of the most visited temples by tourists,not pilgrims.Brihadishvara Temple, also called Rajarajesvaram or Peruvudaiyar Kovil, is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva located in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu.It is one of the largest South Indian temples and an exemplary example of a fully realized Tamil architecture. It is called as Dhakshina Meru of south. Built by Raja Raja Chola I between 1003 and 1010 AD, the temple is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the “Great Living Chola Temples”, along with the Chola dynasty era Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple and Airavatesvara temple that are about 70 kilometres (43 mi) and 40 kilometres (25 mi) to its northeast respectively.Brihadishvara (IAST: Bṛihádīśvara) is a Sanskrit composite word composed of Brihat which means “big, great, lofty, vast”, and Ishvara means “lord, Shiva, supreme being, supreme atman (soul)”.The name means the “great lord, big Shiva” temple. Locally, the temple is called the big temple, while in historic inscriptions it is also referred to as the Rajarajeswaram and Peruvudaiyar temple.\n\nThe original monuments of this 11th century temple were built around a moat. It included gopura, the main temple, its massive tower, inscriptions, frescoes and sculptures predominantly related to Shaivism, but also of Vaishnvaism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism. The temple was damaged in its history and some artwork is now missing. Additional mandapam and monuments were added in centuries that followed. The temple now stands amidst fortified walls that were added after the 16th century.Built out of granite, the vimana tower above the sanctum is one of the tallest in South India. The temple has a massive colonnaded prakara (corridor) and one of the largest Shiva lingas in India.It is also famed for the quality of its sculpture, as well as being the location that commissioned the brass Nataraja – Shiva as the lord of dance, in 11th century. The complex includes shrines for Nandi, Parvati, Kartikeya,Ganesha,Sabhapati, Dakshinamurti, Chandeshvara, Varahi and others. The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu.\n\nA spectrum of Hindu temple styles continued to develop from the 5th to the 9th century over the Chalukya era rule as evidenced in Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal, and then with the Pallava era as witnessed at Mamallapuram and other monuments. Thereafter, between 850 and 1280 CE, Cholas emerged as the dominant dynasty. The early Chola period saw a greater emphasis on securing their geopolitical boundaries and less emphasis on architecture. In the 10th century, within the Chola empire emerged features such as the multifaceted columns with projecting square capitals. This, states George Michell, signaled the start of the new Chola style.This South Indian style is most fully realized both in scale and detail in the Brihadeshvara temple built between 1003 and 1010 by the Chola king Rajaraja.The architect and engineer of the temple was Kunjara Mallan Raja Raja Rama Perunthachan as stated in inscriptions found at the temple.The main temple along with its gopurams are from the early 11th century. The temple also saw additions, renovations, and repairs over the next 1,000 years. The raids and wars, particularly between Muslim Sultans who controlled Madurai and Hindu kings who controlled Thanjavur caused damage.These were repaired by Hindu dynasties that regained control. In some cases, the rulers attempted to renovate the temple with faded paintings, by ordering new murals on top of the older ones. In other cases, they sponsored addition of shrines. The significant shrines of Kartikeya (Murugan), Parvati (Amman) and Nandi are from the 16th and 17th-century Nayaka era. Similarly the Dakshinamurti shrine was built later. According to an inscription dated 1801, the Marathas made elaborate repairs to the shrines of Ganesha, Kartikeya, Parvati, Sabhapati which houses the Nataraja bronze, Dakshinamurti, Chandeshvara, mandapas and the prakara walls. They also rebuilt the temple kitchen and put in a new floor in the courtyard.\n\nThe Brihadeshvara temple plan and development utilizes the axial and symmetrical geometry rules.The temple complex is a rectangle that is almost two stacked squares, covering 240.79 metres (790.0 ft) east to west, and 121.92 metres (400.0 ft) north to south. In this space are five main sections: the sanctum with the towering superstructure (sri vimana), the Nandi hall in front (Nandi-mandapam) and in between these the main community hall (mukhamandapam), the great gathering hall (mahamandapam) and the pavilion that connects the great hall with the sanctum (ardhamandapam).\n\nThe temple complex integrates a large pillared and covered veranda (prakara) in its spacious courtyard, with a perimeter of about 450 metres (1,480 ft) for circumambulation. Outside this pillared veranda there are two walls of enclosure, the outer one being defensive and added in 1777 CE by the French colonial forces with gun-holes with the temple serving as an arsenal. They made the outer wall high, isolating the temple complex area. On its east end is the original main gopuram or gateway that is barrel vaulted. It is less than half the size of the main temple’s vimana. Additional structures were added to the original temple after the 11th century, such as a mandapa in its northeast corner and additional gopurams (gateways) on its perimeters to allow people to enter and leave from multiple locations.Some of the shrines and structures were added during the Pandya, Nayaka, Vijayanagara and Maratha era, before the colonial era started, and these builders respected the original plans and symmetry rules. Inside the original temple courtyard, along with the main sanctum and Nandi-mandapam are two major shrines, one for Kartikeya and for Parvati. The complex has additional smaller shrines.\n\nThe Brihadisvara temple continued the Hindu temple traditions of South India by adopting architectural and decorative elements, but its scale significantly exceeded the temples constructed before the 11th century. The Chola era architects and artisans innovated the expertise to scale up and build, particularly with heavy stone and to accomplish the 63.4 metres (208 ft) high towering vimana.\n\nThe temple faces east, and once had a water moat around it. This has been filled up. The fortified wall now runs around this moat. The two walls have ornate gateways called the gopurams. These are made from stone and display entablature. The main gateways are on the east side. The first one is called the Keralantakan tiruvasal, which means the “sacred gate of the Keralantakan”. The word Keralantakan was the surname of king Rajaraja who built it. About a 100 metres (330 ft) ahead is the inner courtyard gopuram called the Rajarajan tiruvasal. This is more decorated than the Keralantakan tiruvasal, such as with its adhishthanam relief work narrating scenes from the Puranas and other Hindu texts. The inner eastern gopuram leads to a vast courtyard, in which the shrines are all signed to east-west and north-west cardinal directions. The complex can be entered either on one axis through a five-story gopuram or with a second access directly to the huge main quadrangle through a smaller free-standing gopuram. The gopuram of the main entrance is 30 m high, smaller than the vimana.\n\nThe main temple-related monuments and the great tower is in the middle of this courtyard.Around the main temple that is dedicated to Shiva, are smaller shrines, most of which are aligned axially. These are dedicated to his consort Parvati, his sons Subrahmanya and Ganesha, Nandi, Varahi, Karuvur deva (the guru of Rajaraja Chola), Chandeshvara and Nataraja.The Nandi mandapam has a monolithic seated bull facing the sanctum. In between them are stairs leading to a columned porch and community gathering hall, then an inner mandapa connecting to the pradakshina patha\n\nThe sanctum is at the center of the western square. It is surrounded by massive walls that are divided into levels by sharply cut sculptures and pilasters providing deep bays and recesses. Each side of the sanctuary has a bay with iconography.The interior of the sanctum sanctorum hosts an image of the primary deity, Shiva, in the form of a huge stone linga. It is called Karuvarai, a Tamil word that means “womb chamber”. This space is called garbha griha in other parts of India. Only priests are allowed to enter this inner-most chamber.In the Dravida style, the sanctum takes the form of a miniature vimana. It has the inner wall together with the outer wall creating a path around the sanctum for circumambulation (pradakshina). The entrance is highly decorated. The inside chamber is the sanctum sanctorum, which houses the brihad linga.The main Vimana (Shikhara) is a massive 16 storeys tower of which 13 are tapering squares. It dominates the main quadrangle. It sits above a 30.18 metres (99.0 ft) sided square.The tower is elaborately articulated with Pilaster, piers(a raised structure), and attached columns which are placed rhythmically covering every surface of the vimana.\n\nThe temple is dedicated to Shiva in the form of linga, his abstract aniconic representation. It is 8.7 m (29 ft) high, occupying two storeys of the sanctum. It is one of the largest monolithic linga sculptures in India.The Shaivism temple celebrates all major Hindu traditions by including the primary deities of the Vaishnavism and Shaktism tradition in the great mandapa of the main temple. The distribution of the deities is generally symmetric, except for the east entrance side which provide for the door and walkway. In addition to the main deities, each side provides for dvarapalas (guardians), and various other sculptures. The vestibule has three stone sculptures that is intricately carved, and mural paintings.The ground floor level sanctum walls have the following sculptures:\n\nEast wall: Lingodbhava, standing Shiva, Pashupata-murti, plus two dvarapalas flanking the pathway from ardha-mandapam\n\nSouth wall: Bhikshatana, Virabhadra, Dakshinamurti, Kalantaka, Natarajaplus two dvarapalas\n\nWest wall: Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu), Lingodbhava, Chandrashekhara without prabhavali, Chandrashekhara with prabhavali, plus two dvarapalas\n\nNorth wall: Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati), Gangadhara without Parvati, Pashupata-murti, Shiva-alingana-murti, plus two dvarapalas\n\nSculptures on the maha-mandapam walls North side South side Bhairava (Shiva) Ganesha Mahishasuramardini (Durga) Vishnu Saraswati Gajalakshmi\n\nThe temple has an underneath layer of Chola frescoes on the sanctum walls along the circumambulatory pathway. These frescoes which cover floor to ceiling, were discovered in 1931 by S. K. Govindasami of the Anamalai University.The painters used natural pigments and infused it into the wet limestone layer as it was setting in. The Chola frescoes were largely of Shaivism themes. These were restored in the 2000s. The total Chola fresco area is about 670 square metres (7,200 sq ft), of which about 112 square metres (1,210 sq ft) had been uncovered as of 2010 in a method that preserves both paintings, a technique developed by Archaeological Survey of India.The frescoes narrate Hindu mythology. According to Balasubrahmanyam, most frescoes are related to Shiva, but the 11th century Chola frescoes also show Vishnu, Durga and others, as well as scenes of Chola royalty, courtly and common life.\n\nThe later constructions, additions and modifications to the temple curtailed the amount of natural light inside the temple. The frescoes were thus photographed in a limited way and interpreted. According to Sriraman, a complete imaging with better photographic equipment suggests that these historic interpretations were incorrect.For example, a fresco that was previously interpreted as Dakshinamurti Shiva is actually a secular scene of a royal guru meditating under a banyan tree. On the tree are shown peacocks, birds, monkeys, squirrels and owls, plus a cobra. The animals and birds are shown as worried of the cobra, the one’s closer to the snake are shown to be more worried. Other parts of the panel similarly show a court listening to a saint. Other show women in different dresses in different dance mudra.\n\nSome of the paintings in the sanctum sanctorum and the walls in the passage had been damaged because of the soot that had deposited on them once upon a time. Owing to the continuous exposure to smoke and soot from the lamps and burning of camphor in the sanctum sanctorum over a period of centuries certain parts of the Chola paintings on the circumambulatory passage walls had been badly damaged. The Archaeological Survey of India, for the first time in the world, used its unique de-stucco process to restore 16 Nayak paintings, which were superimposed on 1000-year-old Chola frescoes. These 400-year-old paintings have been mounted on fibre glass boards, displayed at a separate pavilion.\n\nThe temple walls have numerous inscriptions in Tamil and Grantha scripts. Many of these begin with customary Sanskrit and Tamil language historical introduction to the king who authorized it, and predominant number of them discuss gifts to the temple or temple personnel, in some cases residents of the city.\n\nAn inscription on the north wall of enclosure, dated 1011 CE, gives a detailed accounts of people employed and supported by the temple. The inscription gives their wages, roles and names. It includes over 600 names including those of priests, lamp lighters, washermen, tailors, jewelers, potters, carpenters, sacred parasol bearers, dance gurus, dancing girls, singers, male and female musicians, superintendents of performance artists, accountants among others. Their wages was in parcels of land, so their temple employment was likely part time.\n\nThe temple employed devadasis who were dancers and singers of devotional hymns. Among its numerous inscriptions are frequent gifts that state, “to provide for worship, for food to assembly of sannyasis (monks or ascetics) and for repairs”. According to George Michell, the Thanjavur temple was a major charity institution in its history. It provides free meal for pilgrims, devotees and wayfarers on a daily basis. On days of Hindu festivals, these meals were elaborate and when brahmins were particularly invited and fed.\n\nOutside the temple enclosure are the fort walls of the Sivaganga Little Fort surrounded by a moat, and the Sivaganga Tank, constructed by the Nayaks of Tanjore of the 16th century who succeeded the imperial Cholas. The fort walls enclose and protect the temple complex within and form part of the protected area by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nBuilt in the year 1010 CE by Raja Raja Chola in Thanjavur, the temple popularly known as the Big Temple. It turned 1000 years old in September 2010. To celebrate the 1000th year of the grand structure, the state government and the town held many cultural events. It was to recall the 275th day of his 25th regal year (1010 CE) when Raja Raja Chola (985–1014 CE) handed over a gold-plated kalasam (copper pot or finial) for the final consecration to crown the vimana, the 59.82-metre tall tower above the sanctum.\n\nTo mark the occasion, the state government organised a Bharathanatyam Yajna, classical dance show under noted dancer Padma Subramaniam. It was jointly organised by the Association of Bharatanatyam Artistes of India (ABHAI) and the Brhan Natyanjali Trust, Thanjavur. To mark the 1000th year anniversary of the building, 1000 dancers from New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Singapore, Malaysia and the US danced in concert to the recorded 11 verses of divine music Thiruvisaippa(ninth volume of Thirumurai) composed by Karuvur deva (the guru of Raja Raja Chola). The small town turned into a cultural hub for two days beginning 26 September 2010 as street performers and dancers performed throughout the town.\n\nOn 26 September 2010 (Big Temple’s fifth day of millennium celebrations), as a recognition of Big Temple’s contribution to the country’s cultural, architectural, epigraphical history, a special ₹ 5 postage stamp featuring the 216-feet tall giant Raja Gopuram was released by India Post.The Reserve Bank of India commemorated the event by releasing a ₹ 5 coin with the model of temple embossed on it. A Raja, Cabinet Minister of Communications and Information Technology released the esteemed Brihadeeswarar temple special stamp, the first of which was received by G K Vasan, Cabinet Minister of Shipping.Mumbai Mint issued Rs 1000 Commemorative Coin with the same picture as on the Rs 5 coin. It was the first 1000 Rupees coin to be released in the Republic of India coinage. This coin was a Non Circulative Legal Tender (NCLT).\n\nOn 1 April 1954, the Reserve Bank of India released a ₹ 1000 currency note featuring a panoramic view of the Brihadeeswar temple marking its cultural heritage and significance. In 1975, the then government led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi demonetised all ₹ 1,000 currency notes in an effort to curtail black money. These notes are now popular among collectors.In 2010, the then Tamil Nadu chief minister, M Karunanidhi renamed Semmai Rice, a type of high productivity paddy variant, as Raja Rajan-1000 to mark the millennial year of the constructor of the temple, Rajaraja Chola.\n\nThe temple “testifies the brilliant achievements of the Chola in architecture, sculpture, painting and bronze casting.” The temple finds mention in many of the contemporary works of the period like Muvar Ula and Kalingathuparani. According to Chatterjee, the Dravidian architecture attained its supreme form of expression in the temple and it successor, the Brihadeeswarar Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram. The temple has been declared as a heritage monument by the Government of India and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument. The temple was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with the Brihadeeswara Temple at Gangaikondacholapuram and Airavatesvara temple at Darasuram are referred as the Great Living Chola Temples. These three temples have similarities, but each has unique design and sculptural elements. All of the three temples were built by the Cholas between the 10th and 12th centuries CE and they have continued to be supported and used by Hindus. The temples are classified as “Great Living” as the temples are active in cultural, pilgrimage and worship practises in modern times.\n\nThe Brihadishvara temple at Thanjavur is the site of annual dance festivals around February, around the Mahashivratri. Major classical Indian dance form artists, as well as regional teams, perform their repertoire at this Brahan Natyanjali festival over 10 days.The Temple car was rolled out on its trial run from opposite to Sri Ramar temple on 20 April 2015 witnessed by a large number of people. Nine days later, the maiden procession of the temple car was held. This was the first such procession in this temple held in the past hundred years, according to news reports.The temple is currently administered and managed by Babaji Bhonsle, the head of the Thanjavur Maratha royal family. He serves as the hereditary trustee of the palace Devasthanam which continues to manage 88 Chola temples including the Brihadeeswara temple. Tamil groups have been unsuccessfully petitioning the Tamil Nadu government to revoke these rights as he does not belong to the erstwhile Chola royal family.\n\nThe Great Living Chola temples represent the development of Dravida architecture from Chola period to Maratha Period. All three monuments have been in a good state of preservation from the date of the inscription of the property and no major threats affect the World Heritage monuments. These monuments are being maintained and monitored by the Archaeological Survey of India. The tradition of temple worship and rituals established and practiced over a thousand years ago, based on still older Agamic texts, continues daily, weekly and annually, as an inseparable part of life of the people.\n\nThe three properties are considered to pass the test of authenticity in relation to their conception, material and execution. The temples are still being used, and they have great archaeological and historical value. The temple complexes used to be part of major royal towns, but have remained as the outstanding features in today’s mainly rural context. The components of the temple complex of the Brihadisvara at Thanjavur, declared a World Heritage property in 1987, includes six sub-shrines which have been added within the temple courtyard over a period of time. The later additions and interventions reinforce the original concept embodied in the main temple complex, in keeping with homogeneity and its overall integrity. The traditional use of the temple for worship and ritual contribute to the authenticity. However the periodic report of 2003 noted a number of conservation interventions that have the potential to impact on authenticity e.g chemical cleaning of the structures and the total replacement of the temple floor; highlighting the need for a Conservation Management Plan to guide the conservation of the property so as to ensure that authenticity is maintained.The temple been under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India from the year 1922. Further, it was brought under the Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act from the year 1959, at the time of its enactment. The management of the cultural property can, therefore, be divided into two distinct parts: (1) The conservation, upkeep and maintenance of the properties, covering physical structure, architectural and site features, environment and surroundings, painting, sculpture, and other relics; and, (2) Temple administration covering staffing structure and hierarchy, accounting and bookkeeping, records and rules.\n\nThe management authority in relation to (1) is solely vested with the Archaeological Survey of India while the aspects covered in (2) are entirely looked after by the Department of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Therefore, it is evident that the property management is, in effect, jointly carried out by these two agencies, one a Central agency, the other belonging to the State.\n\nThe practice has been for the two agencies to prepare their own management plans independently, and review them from time to time. When necessary, joint discussions are held and any apparent contradiction or points of conflict are given due consideration and sorted out. In the case of the Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur and the Airavatesvara temple at Darasuram, the agencies consult the Hereditary Trustee of the Palace Devasthanam when necessary to finalise any issue which requires the Trustee’s input.\n\nHowever, since the nomination of the extended property , the Archaeological Survey of India the Department of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, Government of Tamil Nadu, have, in principle, agreed to draft a joint property management plan encompassing the specific requirements of both while meeting the fundamental objectives of protecting and promoting (1) the three cultural properties while enhancing their Outstanding Universal Value; (2) the Vedic and Agamic traditions and their significance in the life of the people; (3) the arts (sculpture, painting, bronze casting, dance, music and literature) inseparable components of traditional culture; and (4) the ancient science of vastu and silpa shastras, the fundamental guidelines to the construction of temples and religious structures, and to sculpture and painting.\n\nSince the inscription of property as World Heritage property, the monuments have been maintained in a good state of preservation and no major threats affect the monuments. Periodic maintenance and monitoring of the monuments by Archaeological Survey of India keeps the monuments to the expectation of tourists. However a Tourism Management and Interpretation Plan and a Conservation Management Plan are required to guide future work and determine priorities for conservation and interpretation effort. Basic amenities like water, toilets, etc. have been provided attracting more tourists to the place. Improving landscaping and tourist amenities are some of the long term plans. The temples have been centres of worship for the last 800-1000 years and continue to serve in this way. Monitoring of visitor numbers and impacts is necessary to ensure that they do not threaten the Outstanding Universal Value.\n\nThat’s quite a lot of preservation activities done for the three temples together.As mentioned,the temple is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites under the tag “Great Living Chola Temples.”In fact,at first only Brihadisvar was in the list when it was inscribed in 1987.The other two temples were added as an extension only in 2004 and only then,the collective tag came into existence.It has always been my dream to visit the temple and it hasn’t come true till now.Hopefully,in another few months,I’ll be on a tour to Thanjavur and Tiruchirapalli so that I can visit both Brihadisvara Temple and Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple.There was a time when I thought of doing a post graduation.But,now I believe that if I go on another graduation,that too a PG where I don’t have time even to manage my deeds properly,how can I manage my blog?So,to avoid that I have decided to look for a new job and save a small amount of money for travelling to new places.I believe the concept becomes practical.And,also I’ve shared quite a lot of photos too in this post.In fact,the photos are worth sharing.July,as I told earlier is quite a significant month for me.This July,two introverts will turn 24 and will continue their life as singles.One is me and the other you can guess.So,I don’t I’ll stay idle throughout the month at the blog.I’ll be back in another couple of days or maybe hours or maybe even seconds to take you on another adventure.Once again,I thank all of you for your support and valuable feedbacks on my posts.Don’t forget to miss the final knockout stage of the FIFA World Cup to find out who lifts the title.My favourites were Portugal and Germany.Both of them aren’t there now.So,there can be a new champion this year.Along with,do make your mornings joyful by going on a ride with your favourites on your favourite vehicle to your favourite place.Hope all of you have a wonderful month ahead.For the time being,take your minds to the realm of Brihadisvar and feel the positive energy.Every moment in the life is precious.Don’t waste them by simply being idle.Atleast,think and recollect your favourite moments.So,I’m dropping you all at Tanjore for the time being and pick you all back soon.Stay calm and enjoy the ride."
