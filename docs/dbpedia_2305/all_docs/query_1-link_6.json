Manikkavasagar was a 9th century Tamil poet who composed Thiruvasagam, a famous collection of 51 hymns dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. The hymns are included as the 8th volume of the Tirumurai, the 12 part Tamil canon of Shaiva religious works. Thiruvasagam is considered one of the profound works of Tamil literature and discusses the spiritual path from doubt to understanding of Shiva. It had a significant impact and various translations were made, including an English translation by G.U. Pope in 1900.",
