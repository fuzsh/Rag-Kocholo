        "text": "2.1.23. Unsluggishness\n\n601 Of household dignity the lustre beaming bright, Flickers and dies when sluggish foulness dims its light. By the darkness, of idleness, the indestructible lamp of family (rank) will be extinguished.\n\n602 Let indolence, the death of effort, die, If you’d uphold your household’s dignity. Let those, who desire that their family may be illustrious, put away all idleness from their conduct.\n\n603 Who fosters indolence within his breast, the silly elf! The house from which he springs shall perish ere himself. The (lustre of the) family of the ignorant man, who acts under the influence of destructive laziness will perish, even before he is dead.\n\n604 His family decays, and faults unheeded thrive, Who, sunk in sloth, for noble objects doth not strive. Family (greatness) will be destroyed, and faults will increase, in those men who give way to laziness, and put forth no dignified exertions.\n\n605 Delay, oblivion, sloth, and sleep: these four Are pleasure-boat to bear the doomed to ruin’s shore. Procrastination, forgetfulness, idleness, and sleep, these four things, form the vessel which is desired by those destined to destruction.\n\n606 Though lords of earth unearned possessions gain, The slothful ones no yield of good obtain. It is a rare thing for the idle, even when possessed of the riches of kings who ruled over the whole earth, to derive any great benefit from it.\n\n607 Who hug their sloth, nor noble works attempt, Shall bear reproofs and words of just contempt. 75 Those who through idleness, and do not engage themselves in dignified exertion, will subject themselves to rebukes and reproaches.\n\n608 If sloth a dwelling find mid noble family, Bondsmen to them that hate them shall they be. If idleness take up its abode in a king of high birth, it will make him a slave of his enemies.\n\n609 Who changes slothful habits saves Himself from all that household rule depraves. When a man puts away idleness, the reproach which has come upon himself and his family will disappear.\n\n610 The king whose life from sluggishness is rid, Shall rule o’er all by foot of mighty god bestrid. The king who never gives way to idleness will obtain entire possession of (the whole earth) passed over by him who measured (the worlds) with His foot.\n\n2.1.24. Manly Effort\n\n611 Say not, ‘Tis hard’, in weak, desponding hour, For strenuous effort gives prevailing power. Yield not to the feebleness which says, “this is too difficult to be done”; labour will give the greatness (of mind) which is necessary (to do it).\n\n612 In action be thou, ‘ware of act’s defeat; The world leaves those who work leave incomplete! Take care not to give up exertion in the midst of a work; the world will abandon those who abandon their unfinished work.\n\n613 In strenuous effort doth reside The power of helping others: noble pride! The lustre of munificence will dwell only with the dignity of laboriousness or efforts.\n\n614 Beneficent intent in men by whom no strenuous work is wrought, Like battle-axe in sexless being’s hand availeth nought. The liberality of him, who does not labour, will fail, like the manliness of a hermaphrodite, who has a sword in its hand.\n\n615 Whose heart delighteth not in pleasure, but in action finds delight, He wipes away his kinsmen’s grief and stands the pillar of their might. He who desires not pleasure, but desires labour, will be a pillar to sustain his relations, wiping away their sorrows. 7 6\n\n616 Effort brings fortune’s sure increase, Its absence brings to nothingness. Labour will produce wealth; idleness will bring poverty.\n\n617 In sluggishness is seen misfortune’s lurid form, the wise declare; Where man unslothful toils, she of the lotus flower is there! They say that the black Mudevi (the goddess of adversity) dwells with laziness, and the Latchmi (the goddess of prosperity) dwells with the labour of the industrious.\n\n618 ‘Tis no reproach unpropitious fate should ban; But not to do man’s work is foul disgrace to man! Adverse fate is no disgrace to any one; to be without exertion and without knowing what should be known, is disgrace.\n\n619 Though fate-divine should make your labour vain; Effort its labour’s sure reward will gain. Although it be said that, through fate, it cannot be attained, yet labour, with bodily exertion, will yield its reward.\n\n620 Who strive with undismayed, unfaltering mind, At length shall leave opposing fate behind. They who labour on, without fear and without fainting will see even fate (put) behind their back.\n\n2.1.25. Hopefulness in Trouble\n\n621 Smile, with patient, hopeful heart, in troublous hour; Meet and so vanquish grief; nothing hath equal power. If troubles come, laugh; there is nothing like that, to press upon and drive away sorrow.\n\n622 Though sorrow, like a flood, comes rolling on, When wise men’s mind regards it,- it is gone. A flood of troubles will be overcome by the (courageous) thought which the minds of the wise will entertain, even in sorrow.\n\n623 Who griefs confront with meek, ungrieving heart, From them griefs, put to grief, depart. They give sorrow to sorrow, who in sorrow do not suffer sorrow.\n\n624 Like bullock struggle on through each obstructed way; From such an one will troubles, troubled, roll away. 7 7 Troubles will vanish (i.e., will be troubled) before the man who (struggles against difficulties) as a buffalo (drawing a cart) through deep mire.\n\n625 When griefs press on, but fail to crush the patient heart, Then griefs defeated, put to grief, depart. The troubles of that man will be troubled (and disappear) who, however thickly they may come upon him, does not abandon (his purpose).\n\n626 Who boasted not of wealth, nor gave it all their heart, Will not bemoan the loss, when prosperous days depart. Will those men ever cry out in sorrow, “we are destitute” who, (in their prosperity), give not way to (undue desire) to keep their wealth.\n\n627 ‘Man’s frame is sorrow’s target’, the noble mind reflects, Nor meets with troubled mind the sorrows it expects. The great will not regard trouble as trouble, knowing that the body is the butt of trouble.\n\n628 He seeks not joy, to sorrow man is born, he knows; Such man will walk unharmed by touch of human woes. That man never experiences sorrow, who does not seek for pleasure, and who considers distress to be natural (to man).\n\n629 Mid joys he yields not heart to joys’ control. Mid sorrows, sorrow cannot touch his soul. He does not suffer sorrow, in sorrow who does not look for pleasure in pleasure.\n\n630 Who pain as pleasure takes, he shall acquire The bliss to which his foes in vain aspire. The elevation, which even his enemies will esteem, will be gained by him, who regards pain as pleasure."
