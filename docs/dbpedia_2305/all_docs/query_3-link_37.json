Lord Shiva and Parvathi Devi appeared in front of Maha Vishnu and Mahalakshmi and granted their wish but they didn’t give respect to Parvathi Devi. So Parvathi Devi gave a curse that though a son (Manmathan) will be born to them as per the granted wish, he will not have longevity.\n\nSo Mahavishnu made a Somaskanda moortham (Murugar in between Shiva and Parvathi) and worshipped. Then Parvathi Devi got satisfied and gave a blessing that their son would be burnt by Shiva’s third eye but will get into life after. Mahavishnu kept the Somaskanda moortham in His chest and it danced gently to the breath of Mahavishnu’s breath which is called the Ajaba Dance of Sri Thyagarajar at Thiruvarur. Later this was gifted to Indhra by Mahavishnu.\n\nOnce Indhra sought help from Muchukunda Chakravarthi, a great valorous monkey faced king to fight against demons and they won it also. As a thanks giving, Indhra offered whatever the King wanted but Indhra was shocked when the King, a staunch Shiva devotee, asked for the Somaskantha moortham Indhra was fondly worshipping which he got from Lord Vishnu Himself. Muchukunda Chakravarthi was not accepting any other gift. So Indhra played a trick by asking Visvakarma to make six more similar moorthams and offered all of them to the King asking to choose any one. Muchukunda, a great devotee of Lord Shiva, picked the correct one with the help of Lord Himself. Indhra was so happy with the devotion of Muchukunda Chakravarthi and gifted all the 7 moothams to him. The King, on return to earth, installed all the 7 moorthams at various places as Thyagarajars, keeping the original one at Thiruvarur. These 7 temples are called Saptha Vidanga Sthalams. Vidanga means something that has not been chiseled out. These seven Thyagarajars remain as urchavars in these temples while seven emerald (maragatha) lingams are also installed as associated main deities of the Urchava Thyagarajars.\n\nAll the Saptha Vidanga sthalams are around Thiruvarur and they are:\n\nThiruvarur – Veedhi Vidangar – Ajaba dance (dance to the tune of Vishnu’s breath while resting at His chest),\n\nThirukaravoil – AadhiVidangar – Kukkuda dance (dance like a chick),\n\nThiruvoimur – Neela Vidangar – Kamala dance (dance like a lotus wavering),\n\nThirukuvalai(Thirukkolili) – Avani Vidangar – Bringa dance (dance like a bee hovering over flowers),\n\nThirunallaaru – Naga Vidangar – Unmatha dance (dance like an intoxicated person) ,\n\nVedaranyam – Bhuvani Vidangar – Hamsa patha dance (dance like a swan) and\n\nNagapattinam – Sundara Vidangar – Tharanga dance (sea waves).\n\nNote: All seven Thyagaraja moorthies are said to dance in the above styles when taken in procession (it is the bearers of the processional deity who actually dance).\n\nDaily abhishegam takes place twice at specific times in the mornings and evenings to the emerald Vidanga lingams (they are called Vidanga lingams because they are associated with the Vidanga Thyagarajars). In 5 out of these 7, these emerald are stolen and are replaced now (what else can be expected of these dravidian rules?). Only in Thiruvarur and Thirunallar the originals are present now. Due to the commercial value and security reasons they are kept in safe vaults and taken out only during the abhishegam times. We have to see both the spatika lingam and the Thyagaraja moorthams together as one it is just that one is the urchavar and the other linga form is for abhishegam. We need not go into the discussion of which one of the two came from Indhra. Both of them are timeless and several yugams old. In one of the temples, even the face of the metalic Thyagaraja moortham is shapeless due to the abhishegam that had taken place for several yugas! Sri Thyagarajar comes out only once an year for the car festival and does not come out on any other day. Sri Thiyagarajar is always fully dressed and covered with flowers, so that only His and amman’s face are visible, even the Murugar in between is not visible. His and amman’s right foot are revealed only on Aarudhra Dharshan in the month of Margazhi, while their left foot are revealed only on Panguni Uthiram. Sri Thygarajar can be worshipped all times when the temple is kept open while the vidanga lingams can be worshipped only durig the short duration (10 minutes) of the abhishegam times.\n\nThiruvarur\n\nSCN088 – Sri Thyagarajar Temple\n\nSignificances:\n\nThis Shivastalam is a huge temple with many great historical and religious significances\n\nOne of the holiest of the 276 Thevara Paadal petras sthalams\n\nOne of the Saptha Vidanga sthalams having the original of the Vidanga moorthies.\n\nOne of the Pancha bootha sthalams representing Prithivi (Land), equivalent to Kanchi.\n\nThis is the sthalam that grants salvation to those people who are born here and also longing for it. It is considered that Shiva bootha ganas are born as people in Thiruvarur. Sundarar mentions “I am the slave of all those born in Tiruvarur” in his works in Thevaram.\n\nThe evening pooja or Saayaraksha pooja here is called Thiru Anthi Kappu (திரு அந்திக் காப்பு) and is of great significance. It is considered that Devendhra himself is doing the pooja at that time and the sannithyams of all the Shiva temples focus here.\n\nThe temple covers a huge area, having in its fold 9 Rajagopurams, 80 domes (vimanam), 12 high raised walls, 13 mandapams, 15 holy water wells, three flower gardens, three big prakaras and more than 100 shrines! This temple holds the record of having maximum shrines in India. It will take at least one full day to see all the important features and shrines of the temple.\n\nApart from the usual Chandikesvara, there is also Yama Chandikeswara. Yama has been asked by the Lord to sit in as Chandikeswarar since he has no job in this sacred town.\n\nThyagaraja is believed to have performed 364 miracles in Tiruvarur similar to the 64 performed at Madurai Meenakshi Temple.\n\nKamalambal ambigai is sitting in a very rare and stylish posture by putting her one leg over the other which can not be seen in any other temple.\n\nBirth place of Muthuswamy Deekshithar, Thyagarajar and Shyama Sastri, the great trinity of the Carnatic Music of the 17th/18th century,\n\nBirth place of Paravai Nachiyar, wife of Sundarar\n\nPresiding deity:\n\nSri Vanmikanathar as Swayambu lingam with Sri Kamalmbigai Ambal while Sri Thyagarajar is more popular.\n\nOther main deities: Thyagarajar, Veedhi Vitankar, Thirumoolattanar, Purtritangondaar, with Alliyangothai, Neelothbaalambal ambal\n\nLegends:\n\nThe legend of Sri Vanmikanathar, the presiding deity, relates to Shiva appearing within an anthill in response to prayers from the Gods. So, no abishekam is performed for Vanmikanathar.\n\nIt has the most number of hymns in the Thirumurai collection after Sirkazhi\n\nKalarsinga Nayanar and Dandi Adigal Nayanar were born in Tiruvarur.\n\nKadavarkon Kazharsingan, Seru thunaiyar, Naminandhi Adigal, Somaasi Maaranaar and Viranmindar are some of the other nayanmars/ saints associated with Tiruvarur.\n\nSambandar, Appar and Sundarar composed the Pathigams.\n\nIt was here that Sundarar composed the story of all Nayanmars called ‘Thiruttondattogai’.\n\nThe Temple:\n\nSri Thiyagarajar is always fully dressed and covered with flowers, so that only His and amman’s face are visible. His and amman’s right foot are revealed only on Aarudhra Dharshan in the month of Margazhi, while their left foot are revealed only on Panguni Uthiram.\n\nThe Vidangar Abhishegam takes place at 8:30 AM and 5:30 PM.\n\nSome important shrines are Aananthiswarar shrine, Neelothmbal shrine, Asaleswarar shrine, Adageswarar shrine, Varuneswarar shrine, Annamalieswarar shrine, Kamalambal shrine etc.,\n\nA special feature of the temple is the Akshara Peetam near the Shrine of Kamalambal. Akshara Devi here is formless and is believed to reside in the stone Peetam.\n\nThere is Nandi, who has taken a standing posture unlike other Shiva shrines, as a mark of respect to the deity.\n\nThere are three important mandapams: Chitra sabha mandapam, Maha mandapam and 1000 pillar mandapam\n\nIt is important to witness the maragatha linga abishekam.\n\nMuthuswamy Dikshithar used to sing Navavarna krithis and the Kamalambal ambigai used to listen in a stylish posture by putting her one leg over the other.This kind of Ambal posture is never seen in any other temple.\n\nGopurams architecture is amazing with single stone pillars at the entrance of Rajagopurams.\n\nThe Navagrahas are in a single line.\n\nLot of murals are painted around and at the roof of the outside moolasthanam.\n\nThe annual Brahmotsavam is held in the Tamil month of Panguni. Muchkunda Chakravarthi installed Thyagesar at Thiruvarar on the Hastha star day of Tamil Masi month. So every year festival starts on that with the flag hoisting ceremony and the Theerthavari takes place on the Panguni Uthiram day.\n\nParavai Nachiyar:\n\nThis is the birth place of Paravai Nachiyar, Sundarar’s first wife. Sundarar married Sangili Nachiyar as second wife atThiruvotriyur and also promised her not to leave Thiruvotriyur but he left the place after some time. He got punished and lost vision in both eyes. He got back vision in the left eye through Kanchi Ekambareswarar and came back to Thiruvarur. He got his vision restored at the other eye also through this Thyagarajar but Paravai Nachiyar didn’t even want to see him (naturally). So Sundarar appealed to Lord Shiva and He went as an emissary in the disguise of the temple priest and tried to persuade her but failed. Again, on the same night, He went as Lord Himself and persuaded her successfully to accept Sundarar again.\n\nMusic:\n\nThere was a large influx of the acumen of South Indian culture to the town during the 17th century CE due to the political unrest in Thanjavur and increased patronage of the Maratha kings to Thiruvarur, resulting in developments in music and dance.\n\nMuthuswamy Deekshithar, Thyagarajar and Shyama Sastri, the great trinity of the Carnatic Music of the 17th/18th century, were born in Thiruvarur. Deekshithar in particular composed several Kritis addressed to Thyagarajar, Kamalambika and several other deities in this temple.\n\nA unique musical instrument called Panchamuga Vadyam with each of its five ends ornamented differently is used in the temple.\n\nA type of nadaswaram (pipe instrument) called “Barinayanam” is also a unique instrument found only in Tiruvarur.\n\nMatru Uraitha Vinayaagr shirne:\n\nSundarar got 12,000 gold coins from Vridhachalam Pazhamalai nathar for his different temple works but he was worried about taking them to Thiruvarur without getting stolen on the way. So the Lord advised him to put the gold coins at the Vridhachalam temple tank and get back at the Kamalalaya temple tank of Thiruvarur. At Thiruvarur, he sang pathigams and got back the coins properly but doubted the quality of the coins. Without believing the Lord Himself, he wanted to check the quality of the coins by comparing with a small piece of the original he kept with him! So he requested the Matru Uraitha Vinayagar of this temple and He reported that the quality is lower! So Sundarar again sang the pathigams to get back the coins in their original quality (these later pathigams are not available as of now). This is nothing but the holy play of the Lord to listen to the pathigams of Sundarar.\n\nDevasraya mandapam:\n\nWhen Sundarar went inside the temple to worship Thyagarajar he was stopped by Viranmindar, another Adiyar. He said the worship procedure is to first give respect to the Adiyars at the Devasraya mandapam and then only step into the other shrines. Sundarar didn’t accept this and after heated exchange came out of the temple. While wandering outside the temple, he was wondering how to go inside and worship his Thyagarajar and at that time, the Lord Himself gave dharshan as Thyagarajar through the North entrance gopuram. It is a small shrine with a linga moortham just opposite the North entrance rajagopuram and is called Ottu Thyagesar (ஒட்டு தியாகேசர்) since the shrine looks as if sticking to the giant wall of the inner praharam. So even now the devotees should first give respect to the Adiyars at the Devasraya mandapam and then only enter the other shrines.\n\nDevendran at Eastern gopuram:\n\nThis is a massive 118 feet tall 7 tier Rajagopuram with plenty of sculptures. After Devendhran had to part with his Thyagarajar to Muchukundan, he was unable to bear the loss and came to Thruvarur requesting Thyagarajar to come back with him. The Lord had told him to wait at the Eastern gopuram to take Him. It is considered that Devendhran is still waiting at the Eastern entrance but Thyagarajar is yet to come out through that entrance. He comes out for all the festivals through the other entrances only!\n\nManuneetha Chola and the Stone Chariot (கல் தேர்):\n\nThiruvar is the place where Manuneethi Chola, an epic King ruled once.

The Azhi ther which is primarily a wooden structure with beautiful carvings gets added beauty when 68 decorative pieces are added to adorn the chariot. Normally, the dome of the cars will be in the format of hexagon, octagon, or circular. But the basement to the dome part of Azhi ther has five bands per side, totalling 20 in all.\n\nThe annual chariot festival is celebrated during April – May, corresponding to the Tamil month of Chitrai.\n\nFestivals:\n\nOn the Maasi month Hastha star day, Muchukundan installed Thyagarajar at Thiruruvar and that festival is taking place every year\n\nTheertham:\n\nKamalalayam, got its name since Mahalakshmi did penance to Moolattaneswarar here to marry Lord Vishnu.

There are several variants of how the idols were made in these 3 temples.\n\nThe sculptor first made the Subramanyar moorthy of Sikkal and was awe struck by its quality that he vowed that no other such image should be made, and cut off his right thumb (one variant claims it was the Chola King Mutharasan who had it cut off).\n\nHe was then prompted by Subramanyar in a dream, to fashion another moorthy for the shrine at Ettukudi. He followed the instructions in his dream and made the moorthy of Ettukudi without the support of his right thumb. When the moorthy was completed, he blinded himself (or the King blinded him as per the variant) so that he could not create moorthies any more.\n\nAnother dream prompted him to create the third moorthy of Skanda mounted on a peacock with the aid of a little girl (some say his daughter). When his chisel inflicted injury upon her, the blood that gushed forth splashed over his eyes and opened up his vision. He revered Skanda in a spate of poetry and the first phrase that he uttered upon recovering his eyesight was ‘EnKann’ (my eyes)- hence the name of that temple.\n\nPeople with poor vision pray to Subramanya at Ennkann to get back their vision.\n\nBrahma worshipped Lord Shiva here\n\nArunagirinathar sang Thiruppugazh on this Murugar.\n\nSubramanyar is facing South\n\nApart from the sheer beauty of the moorthy of Subramanyar, the fact that the whole weight of the moorthy is balanced on just the two legs of the peacock speaks volumes of the skill of the sculptor.

Valayapettai Ra. Krishnan, Muruga devotee and Tiruppugazh propagator, and his brother Dr. R. Ramaseshan engaged themselves in an extensive research of the places and have published books ‘Arunagirinathar Adichchuvattil’ and ‘Tiruppugazh Thalappayanam.’\n\nTriambakapuram was once peopled with Sanskrit scholars and Dikshitars who performed yagas. A century ago, the Dikshitars migrated and spread themselves in Senkalipuram, Vadakudi, Kandiramanickam and so on. However, the temple of Triambaka Sastha, family deity of the Dikshitars, is still there. As advised by Mahaperiyava, the temples of Pidari and Kaali were renovated some years ago. But the Siva temple had disappeared with only the Sivalingam with the Avudaiyar standing testimony to its existence.\n\nContact: Siruvapuri Murugan Abisheka Committee @ 9003232722.\n\nLinks: Location\n\nKappanamangalam\n\nKappanamangalam is located on the branch road towards Enkann\n\n1) Perumal temple\n\n2) Shiva Temple\n\nSCN093 – Sri Nardhanapureeswarar temple at Thalayalangadu\n\nLocation: About half a km after the Enkann diversion, the diversion towards North for about 100 meters will lead us to this temple.

This chakra is believed to have been sent to protect King Ambarisha, a Vishnu devotee, from the curse of Durvasa, the famous sage. Usually Vishnu’s Sudarshana Chakra in most temples is held in its resting position facing the devotees but here it is in a rare Prayoga chakra state ~ as if it is ready to be sent out. Hence there are also no houses built on the southern side of the street across the Temple.\n\nSri Mahalakshmi Thayar:\n\nSri Mahalakshmi thayar the consort of Sri Kalyana Vardharaja Perumal, is an exact replica of Triplicane Parthasarathy Temple Vedavalli Thayar.\n\nSri Kalyana Varadaraja Perumal:\n\nSince the Lord Aadhi Varadharaja Perumal was very fierce with the Chakra weapon, another Vishnu, Sri Kalyana Varadharajar was also erected in the same shrine. These Panchaloka Utsava idols of this Temple are very ancient, 10th century Chola bronze.\n\nSri Ramar:\n\nThough the presiding deity is Sri Varadharaja Perumal, the temple is more popular for the Ramar shrine. Anjaneya and Sita Pirati are on the right side of Kodandarama and Lakshnama to the left and the Divya dhampati bestow their grace in Kalyana kolam.\n\nThe Varadharaja Perumal temple was built in the early 1800s by a great Vishnu Bhakta by the name Sri Krishna Sastri Ayyaval (1773 – 1860), patron of SerfojiMaharaja ll.\n\nLater, this temple became the life and soul of a Mahaan Brahmasri Paruthiyur Krishna Sastri (1845-1911), revered as Paruthiyur Periyava. He was a great Rama Bhakta, a Ramayana exponent, Philanthropist and Kathakalakshepa and Pravachan Pioneer. He received Mantropadesam from Marudhanallur Sadguru Kodandarama Swamigal at a very young age, since then Sarvam Rama Mayam, (everything was Rama) for him. Sastri’s desire was to build a temple for Sri Rama. When he renovated the temple and constructed a Thatakam, Kodadhandarama Threertham known as the Melakulam, a very big surprise of beautiful bronze Rama Murtis awaited him. He installed Mahalakshmi and Kodandarama sannadhis and made this temple famous and auspicious.This Mahaan attained mukti though Kapala Moksha.\n\nFestivals: Rama Navami is a grand 10 day Utsavam in this temple.\n\nPushkarni: Kodandarama Theertham (Mela Kulam), Kudamurutti – Tributary of Cauvery\n\nContact: Bhattacharya @ 97868 67387\n\nEmail: PKSparivaar@yahoo.com\n\nLinks: Location Weblink1 Photos\n\n2) Shiva Temple\n\nLinks: Location\n\nSeru Kalathur\n\n1) Sri Someswarar Temple\n\nLinks: Location\n\n2) Sri Gopalakrishnan Temple\n\nLinks: Location\n\nThiruvarur – Peralam (Mayiladuthurai)\n\nSri Dakshina Kali Temple at Senthamangalam\n\nLinks: Location\n\nSCN086 – Sri Thrinethra nathar Temple at Palliyin Mukkoodal\n\nLocation:\n\nGayakarai (now called Gekarai) is about 4.5 km north of Thiruvarur from where a diversion takes us to a place called Palliyin Mukkoodal.\n\nIn the Thiruvarur – Peralam road, we have to take East ward diversion at Senthamangalam.\n\nOne can also alight at either Kodikal Palayam or Virkudi railway station in the Mayiladuthurai – Thiruvarur rail route.\n\nSignificances:\n\nOne of the 276 Thevara Paadal petra sthalams\n\nThe “Mukkoodal Theertham” here is regarded on par with Allahabad Thriveni sangam where three rivers meet.\n\nThis place and theertham are regarded on par with Gaya since Lord Rama is said to have performed rituals for his father, King Dhasaratha, here.\n\nMain deities: Mukkonanatheswarar and the Ambal is Maimevumkanni\n\nLegend:\n\nAriyan Palli, Kuruvi Rameswaram are the historical names of this place.\n\nLord Rama is said to have performed rituals for his father, King Dhasaratha, here as this place and theertham are regarded on par with Gaya. Like in Allahabad Thriveni sangam, where three rivers meet, “Mukkoodal Theertham” in front of the Temple is considered equally Holy. There is a Ramaswamy temple behind this Shivastalam.\n\nAccording to Thiruvarur Puranam, a Chola King who never missed a Shiva Dharshan before taking meals, reached late at this place and found that the temple was closed by that time. His assistant, who came in a horse, decorated a bag containing horse- feed as Shiva linga and kept it in front of the King. Thinking that it was a Linga, the King worshipped it and took dinner that night. He came to know the fact on the next day and tried to lift the bag. He could not succeed as the contents of the bag really transformed into a Linga.\n\nParvathi devi appeared as daughter to a Queen called Thapovadhani on a Lotus and The Lord married Her later.\n\nLegend has it that Jatayu worshipped Shiva and was directed to bathe in the Mukkoodal theertham\n\nGiven the association with Jatayu and Sri Rama, this Thevara Stalam is also known as KuruviRameswaram.\n\nSung by Appar in his Thevaram.\n\nThe Temple:\n\nThe Lingam has a highly polished appearance.\n\nThe east facing Temple, renovated by Naattukkottai nagarathar has just one Prakaram.\n\nNandi, facing the Sanctum has turned its head slightly.\n\nThe Murthis of Ganapathi, Subramanya and Lakshmi in the Prakara are extraordinarily beautiful.\n\nTheertham: Mookkoodal theertham, known by the name ShodasaSethu, is considered on par with Allahabad Thriveni Sangamam,\n\nNote: There is a Ramaswamy temple behind this Shivastalam.\n\nLinks: Location Weblink\n\nSCN073 – Sri Soundareswarar Temple at Thiruppanaiyur\n\nLocation: Andipanthal is located at about 9.5 kms from Thiruvarur in the Peralam road; and from Andipanthal, 2.5 kms North East diversion will take us to this temple.\n\nThe great King Karikala Cholan lived in this placed for 8 years before capturing his kingdom from enemies.

The tank near the Manikka nachiyar thittu, North East to this village is called “Santhitha Theertham” as a mark of the place of this meeting.\n\nSambandar and Sundarar composed the Pathigam.\n\nTemple:\n\nAs soon as we enter, there is a Vinayagar called “Thunai Iruntha Vinayagar” who was protecting Karikal Chola King.\n\nThere is an image of Paraasara Muni, who is said to have dropped a small portion of the celestial nectar – Amritam – into the Temple tank and hence the name “Amrita Pushkarini”.\n\nThere are seven lingams worshipped by the Saptha rishsis\n\nLike the Vinayagar in Thiruvarur connected with the Sundarar’s legend, the Vinayagar at the prharam here is also called “Matru Uraitha Vinayagar”\n\nSthala Vriksham: Panai (Palm); there are two palm trees here which grew by themselves without any seed when the previous trees became very old.\n\nTheertham: Amirtha Pushkarini.\n\nLinks: Location Weblink1 Weblink2\n\nMudikondan\n\n1) Sri Kothanda Ramar Temple\n\nLocation: Mudikondon is 20 kms from Mayiladuthurai and 15 kms from Thiruvarur.

It was here the ashram of Sage Bharadwaja existed.\n\nDuring His march to Lanka, Sri Rama stayed in the hermitage of Sage Bharadwaja for a short while, when the sage wanted to treat the Lord with a feast. Sri Rama politely declined to accept the offer as He was on a mission and promised to accept the same on His way back to Ayodhya. When Rama was returning back after completing His mission, His Pushpaka vimanam landed near the hermitage.\n\nLord Ranganatha, the kula devata (family deity) of Lord Rama manifested at the request of Bharadwaja Maharishi for the sake of Lord Rama. Lord Ranganatha personally coronated Lord Rama with a pushpa kireedam (a crown made of five different Deva Loka flowers). Rama gave darshan to Sage Bharadwaja with this Mudi (crown) and hence the place is known as Mudikondan.\n\nHanuman’s angry gesture:\n\nRama asked Hanuman to make a quick trip to Nandigram to inform Bharatha of their arrival. By the time Hanuman returned, Rama had adorned the crown and finished His meals. Saddened by the fact that his Lord did not wait for his return and not having set aside a plantain leaf for him, Hanuman decided to stand outside (though it is difficult to even imagine that Hanuman can become angry with Lord Rama!). Hence, Hanuman is absent in the sanctum sanctorum and he has a separate shrine opposite to Sri Ramar outside the temple complex.\n\nAlso, it is believed that Hanuman in his anger prayed that plantain should not grow here. To this day, there is no growth of plantain trees in Mudikondan, though one would find a number of trees outside this village.\n\nThe Temple:\n\nGenerally temples for Rama are constructed facing South so that Vibishana, after his cornonation following the end of Ravana, could ever worship Rama in the North. But the Mudikondon Temple is facing East as Bharadwaja Rishi wanted to have the dharshan of Sri Rama with Sita and Lakshmana with His crown. Instead, Sri Ranganatha shrine is installed facing South.\n\nHanuman shrine is opposite to that of the Lord.\n\nThe arca vigraham of Sri Rama is so beautiful with a slight stylish bending holding the bow.\n\nPrayers:\n\nThose praying in this temple are blessed with high education and wisdom. Those desirous of going overseas for higher education visit this temple praying to achieve their aim. Artists aspiring name and fame and special skills seek the blessing of the Lord of this temple.

Instead of Abhaya Hastham He has the Varadha Hastham similar to Kanchi Varadharaja perumal. Also, He has the Prayoga Chakaram, completely turned in a way to be sent out, similar to that of Ranganatha Perumal of SriRangam.\n\nThayar: Kannapura Nayaki along with Periya piraati, Sridevi, Aandal and Padmini Thaayar\n\nUtsavar: Sowriraja Perumal in the posture of seeking hands for marriage.\n\nPooja: Vaihasanam\n\nPrathyaksham for Kanva Maharishi, Thandaka Maharishi and Garudan.\n\nLegend:\n\nOnce the temple was on the seashore but now the sea is far away and the temple legend is connected very much with the fishermen.\n\nKanva Maharishi brought up Shakunthala, the daughter of Vishvamithra and Menaka. Later Shakunthala married King Dhushyanthan but he forgot his lover due to an eveil spell. In order to unite Shakunthala with her husband a fish ate up her marriage ring and when the King saw the ring, came running in search of Shakunthala and their son Bharatha.\n\nAs the fisherman was the sole reason of unison of Shakunthala and Dhushyantha they are called as “Bharathavar”.\n\nYearly once a special pooja is conducted to this perumal by all the fisherman of this area.\n\nUparisravas, a Fishermen King, performed the aswamedha sacrifice and begot a daughter named Padmini, whom he offered in marriage to Lord Vishnu at this shrine.\n\nVibishanan wanted to take away Ranganathar from SriRangam but as He was in sleeping posture be couldn’t do that. So he prayed to Perumal to show the beauty of His walk to him for which He obliged on a new moon day here.\n\nIt is believed that Neelamegha Perumal vanquished a demon called Veekatakshan with His disc and hence the presiding deity is found with the prayoga chakram completely turned in a “ready to send” position.\n\nIt is also believed that the Lord in the sanctum miraculously showed His long plait (Kudumi) in order to protect a devout priest Ranga bhattar from the King’s punishment and hence attained the name Sowrirajan. The dhrashan of His hair is possible only during the procession on New moon days.\n\n“Om Namo Narayana” is the eight syllable sacred manthra for Vaishnavities. Thirumangai Alwar was taught this Mantra from the Lord Neelamega perumal directly. Here the Perumal lives in each of the eight syllables and hence this place is also called “Srimath astakshara Maha Manthira Siddhi Kshetram”, the place where the Thirumandiram gives boundless power.\n\nA great devotee by name Muniyadaraiyaar was late when he went to offer Pongal to the Lord and the temple doors were closed. Hence he stood outside of the temple and mentally submitted the pongal to the Lord. As a honour of acceptence, bells in the Moolavar Shrine started ringing and the whole campus was filled with the fragrence of fresh ghee and pongal. So from that day, during the last pooja of each night, Perumal takes pongal which is named “Munitharam” pongal.\n\nThirumangai Azhwar is believed to have been initiated at this temple. There is a shrine to Tirumangai Azhwar closer to the temple, and also a temple for Ramanujar.\n\nNeelamega perumal gave dharshan to Thandaka Maharishi who was formely a king and due to his hard penance at Kanchi gained the status of Maharishi.\n\nThe Temple:\n\nBoth the tank and the temple at this place are very big in size.\n\nSince this is called “Booloha Vaikundam”, there is no Sorga vassal in this temple.\n\nWhile Perumal usually gives the posture of Abhaya hastham, a blessing posture, here He is present in the posture of seeking hands, meaning asking us to give our difficulties to Him.\n\nIndhra, after getting his dosham cleared off by praying to Lord here, installed Navagrahas and they are present in the Rajagopura walls facing West.

It is believed that Nandi stood in the way of Rama’s worship and that Parvathi controlled him by holding him with Her arm, hence the name of the place as Ramanandeeswaram. In the Somaskanda moortham of this temple, Parvathi devi is holding Nandhi in Her hand (For safety reasons the vigraham is in Thiruppugalur temple).\n\nSambandar composed the Pathigam.\n\nThe Temple:\n\nKulothunga Chola has gifted lands of Sivapathasekaramangalam for the maintenance of this Temple and renovated it.\n\nTheertham: Surya Pushkarini, Rama Theertham\n\nLinks: Location Weblink\n\nSCN079 – Sri Uthirapasupatheeswarar / Ganapatheeswarar temple at Thiruchengattankudi\n\nLocation: Around 1.5 kms East of Thirukkannapuram Paadal petra sthalam.\n\nSignificances:\n\nOne of the 276 Thevera Paadal petra sthalams\n\nOne of the temples where Lord Shiva enacted His holy play (Thiruvilaiyadal)\n\nVathapi Ganapathi, the one Paranjothi brought from Vathapi after his successful battle with Chalukyas is present here.\n\nThe life of Siruthonda Nayanar is connected with this temple\n\nMain deities: Uttarapathiyar, Ganapateeswarar and the Ambal Tirugukuzhal Nayaki.\n\nLegend:\n\nLord Ganapathi is said to have prayed to Lord Shiva here to seek atonement for the sin of having killed the demon Gajamukhasuran, hence the place is also called Ganapatheeswaram. The demon’s blood that flowed created the reddened land, called Chenkaadu, then as Chengattangudi.\n\nThe life of Siruthinad Nayanar is connected with this temple\n\nThis is one of the temples which has the significance of Lord Shiva coming on earth and walked through His holy feet to enact His different Thiruvilaiyadals. He came as Uthrapatheeswarar here and walked through from Siruthonda Nayanar’s house to the Aathi tree of this temple.\n\nSambandar and Appar composed the Pathigam.\n\nHistory of Siruthondar:\n\nThis is the birth place of Paranjothi, a staunch Shiva devotee and Chief of the Pallava army. He was always a winner and lost no battle as he was backed by the blessings of Lord Shiva. The King thought that if anything unnatural occurred to his commander, it would be a wrong committed against Lord Shiva and therefore granted retirement to him from services to continue a choice life dedicated to the service of Lord. Paranjothi-later Siruthondar-was too happy that he would be able to turn all his attention to a life of spirituality.\n\nHe was married to Mangai Nallal mentioned as Tiruvenkattu Nangai in our Saivite scriptures and a son named Seeralan. The couple was very particular to have their food only after hosting a lunch to Shiva devotees. They served what devotees wished. One day none turned up. Siruthondar left the house in search of a devotee. When he was out, a Shiva devotee knocked at his house. Tiruvenkattu Nangai and her maid Seerala Nangai welcomed the devotee and invited for the lunch. The devotee said that he would wait near the Kattathi tree at the temple until the male head of the house returns. When Sirthondar returned he was happy to know that a Shiva devotee was waiting. The Shiva devotee said that he needs the meat of a first male child of a family. He and his wife prepared the food with their son’s meat as wished by the devotee.\n\nWhen food was served, the Shiva devotee asked the host to call his son also to join him. Shocked and surprised, the couple came out and cried “Seerala, Seerala..”. The boy in all flesh and blood came alive before them. When they entered, the Devotee in His true form granted darshan with Mother Parvathi and salvation to all of the four including the maid. He was Lord Pasupatheeswara. The Kattathi tree and a shrine of the family of Siruthondar are just before the Shrine of Lord. The idols of Siruthondar, Uthrapatheeswarar (the urchava idol of Ganaptheeswaram), Thiruvenkattu Nangai in a posture of serving food are present here.\n\nThe Temple:\n\nAll the Ashta (8) Veeratta Samharamurthies are in line in the prakara – Lords Bhujangalinga Murthy, Gaja Samharamurthy, Oordhva Thandavar, Kaala Samharamurthy, Gangalamurthy, Bikshadana, Tripura Samharamurthy and Bhairava. Their presence in a single temple thus facilitates darshan of all Samharamurthies of different temples in a single place.\n\nAmudhu Padayal festival is celebrated in the Tamil month of Chittirai and one special prasadam in the name of “Seeralan kari” is being made only on that day with the combination of some medicinal products.

The name Marugal also comes from the stala vruksham – Vaazhai.\n\nA trader promised to offer one of his 7 daughters to their maternal uncle for marriage in the early years but didn’t keep up his promise. When they turned up with marriage age, he arranged marriages for them with some other persons one by one. The 7th daughter, a Shiva devotee, realizing that her father will cheat her uncle in her case also, eloped with him to this temple. Unfortunately, the boy got poisoned up with a snake bite and was dead. She cried to the Lord and when Sambandar came to this temple, he heard her cry and sang the Pathigam ‘Sadaiyai Enumaal’, known as “Vidam Theertha Patikam” and brought back her uncle to life. He also conducted the marriage between them with Swamy Himself standing as a witness in the form of a Vanni tree and a well. The girl’s parents, who were at Madurai, didn’t accept the marriage because there was no witnees to the marriage. The girl prayed to the Lord and He gave dharshan at Madurai in the form of Vanni tree and well as a proof of marriage. Thus, this temple is the source of the famous holy play that was enacted at Madurai. This event is commemorated in a celebration each year. We can see the vanni tree and the well in the praharam of this temple.\n\nThe ‘Sadaiyai Enumaal’ pathigam is considered very powerful in resolving the problems in marriages.\n\nSambandar and Appar composed the Pathigam.\n\nThe Temple:\n\nThis is one of the 78 “Madakkoils”, built on an elevation, by Ko Chengat Chola Nayanar so that elephants can not enter the sanctum.\n\nChitra Pournami is celebrated here on a grand scale.\n\nSthala Vriksham: Marugal, a type of banana tree\n\nTheertham: Siva Ganga\n\nLinks: Location Weblink1 Weblink2\n\nSCN081 – Sri Ayavantheeswarar at Seeyathamangai / Sathamangai\n\nLocation: Around 2.5 kms from the Thirumarugal temple with around 1 km North ward diversion from the Nannilam – Karaikkal main road.\n\nSignificances:\n\nOne of the 276 Thevara Paadal petra sthalams\n\nAvathara sthalam of Sri Neelanakka naayanaar\n\nMain deities: Ayavanteeswarar and the Ambal Malarkannammai, Ubaya pushpa vilochani\n\nLegend:\n\nThe place is called Sathamangai and the temple is called Ayavantheesam in the scriptures.\n\nBrahmma worshipped the presiding deity here, hence the name Ayavanti.\n\nSambandhar sang hymns of this Lord and all of his verses describe Shiva’s manifestation as Ardhanareeswarar.\n\nThe Temple:\n\nThe idols of Sri Neelanakka naayanaar and his wife Mangayarkkarasi are present in the temple\n\nAavani Moolam in the Tamil month of Avani witnesses a lot of festivities here\n\nSthala Vriksham: Konrai\n\nTheertham Brahmma Theertham\n\nLinks: Location Weblink1 Weblink2\n\nSri Seshapureeswarar Temple at Seshamoolai\n\nThis is a 1,000-year old Chola period temple.\n\nLegend has it that Adiseshan earned the wrath of Durvasar, who cursed him to live on earth.

There are several variants of how the idols were made in these 3 temples.\n\nThe sculptor first made the Subramanyar idol of Sikkal and was awe struck by its quality that he vowed that no other such image should be made, and cut off his right thumb (one variant claims it was the Chola King Mutharasan who had it cut off).\n\nHe was then prompted by Subramanyar in a dream, to fashion another idol for the shrine at Ettukudi. He followed the instructions in his dream and made the idol of Ettukudi without the support of his right thumb. When the idol was completed, he blinded himself (or the King blinded him as per the variant) so that he could not create idols any more.\n\nAnother dream prompted him to create the third idol of Skanda mounted on a peacock with the aid of a little girl (some say his daughter). When his chisel inflicted injury upon her, the blood that gushed forth splashed over his eyes and opened up his vision. He revered Skanda in a spate of poetry and the first phrase that he uttered upon recovering his eyesight was ‘EnKann’ (my eyes)- hence the name of that temple.\n\nThe Temple:\n\nThis is one of the 78 “Madakkoils”, built on an elevation, by Ko Chengat Chola Nayanar so that elephants can not enter the sanctum.\n\nThe annual Brahmotsavam is celebrated in the Tamil month of Chittirai. During Skanda Sashti Utsavam, Singaravelar receives his Vel (Spear) from Devi.\n\nSthala Vriksham: Jasmine\n\nTheertham: Ksheera Pushkarini\n\nContact: Sri Arunkumar Gurukkal @ 94435 04591\n\nLinks: Location Photos Weblink1 Weblink2\n\nSri Murugan Temple at Poravacheri\n\nPorulvaithacheri, now called Poravacheri, is just a kilometer before Sikkal while going from Nagapattinam and 4 Kms from Nagapattinam.\n\nThe main deity here is Shiva, but it is the idol of Shanmugha which captures all our attention.\n\nIt is a very beautiful Shanmuga with the peacock giving a feel that it will fly away at any moment with its master – so life-like.\n\nThe complete idol is of single granite stone with the Lord Subramnayar having six faces (Arumugan), twelve hands, weapons in ten hands and the other two hands in Abhaya Varadha hastham. The sculpture of Subramanian is beautiful with minute details like finger, nails which gives a feeling of life in the sculpture.\n\nAs we go around we see Lord Ganesha named as Annadhana pilliyar.There is a separate sanctum for Ambal, who is worshiped as swarna kalika Devi.\n\nLord Siva is seen here, in Linga form known as Sundareswarar and his consort Meenaksi.

It resembles to the Anantha Padmanabhaswamy of Thiruvananthapuram in many factors like, the name Ananthasayana Perumal, the size and posture – the garbhagriha having three doors to enabling the devotees to view Him from head to feet.\n\nLegend:\n\nMother Seetha embellished herself with all the jewels left here before going to further South. On the return journey to Ayodhya, She took them back. The name Aabharana dhari coveys this (Aabharanam in Tamil means jewels). Among Maharshis Brighu and Markandeya worshipped this Lord and achieved their object. The temple has given equal importance to Saivate Gods as evidenced by the Saivate symbols at several places, thereby establishing abheda between Hari and Hara.\n\nThe Temple:\n\nIt is a very big temple with vastness in everything like towers, courtyards, a large number of mandaps for parivara devathas and imposing towers.\n\nLinks: Location Photos Weblink\n\nThere is also an old Chola temple at Avarani but dilapidated\n\nSri Nadueaswarar / Sri Vedhapureeswarar Temple at Puduchery\n\nThe temple is located at 2 kms South of Avarani and 2.5 kms East of Vadakalathur/Pattamangalam.\n\nThe Shiva Lingam here is called Nadu-Eashwarer (Nadueaswarar) and is unique in shape that is said to have been created by Maharishi Vashistar.\n\nAccording to Sathguru Venkataraman of Agasthiar.org:\n\nJust like the “vimana” of Lord Ranganatha Perumal of Srirangam arrived from Vaikunta itself, this unique Na"
