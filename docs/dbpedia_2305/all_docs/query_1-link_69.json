The list includes temples wherein Saint Arunagirinathar has sung Thiruppugazh songs in praise of Lord Murugan. A few Murugan temple details were covered in my earlier Blog : Kshethradanam – 30 Important Murugan /Subhramanya/ Karthikeya temples for Darshan with Map of 1000 Temples Around Salem there are a number of small hills and Lord Murugan resides in many of them (9 Thiruppugazh sthalams and 19 Murugan temples covered in this Blog)\n\nNEW Blog : Please see my Blog on Murugan / Subramanya temples around Coimbatore , Tamilnadu wherein details of 15 Thiruppugazh sthalams and 14 Murugan / Subramanya temples are given.\n\nNew Blog : Shiva Temples established by Lord Murugan around Tiruvannamalai – Part 2 of 5 (Sapta Karaikanda Sthalams and Sapta Kailaya Sthalams).

Also you can paste the location details from the Blog to get the location of the temple\n\n3.Thiruppugazh Sthalangal\n\nThiruppugazh is one of the major works of medieval Tamil literature, known for its poetical and musical qualities, as well as for its religious, moral and philosophical content rendered by Saint Arunagirinathar. Arunagiri visited temples all over South India and composed 16,000 songs – at present about 1,334 alone were found. His songs show the way to a life of virtue and righteousness and set the tone for a new form of worship, the musical worship.\n\nThe works of Arunagirinathar include Thiruppugazh , Thiruvaguppu, Kandar Alangaram, Kandar Anubhuti ,Kandar Andhaadhi, Vel Viruttham, Mayil Viruttham, Seval Viruttham, Thiru Elukūtrirukkai etc. For Lord Murugan’s devotees Thiruppugazh is equivalent to Thevaaram, Kandar Alangaram is equivalent to Thiru Vaasagam and Kandar Anubhuti is equivalent to Thiru Mandhiram. Tiruppugazh, composed by saint poet Arunagirinathar, is unique because it brings before us the image of Lord Muruga in full splendour and glory and bestows us the abounding grace of Muruga. Among many saints who guided humanity to the path of perfection, Arunagirinathar occupies a unique position. His songs not only sparks the flame of devotion in the minds of people but also the light of knowledge in the intellect. He showed the way to the life of virtue and righteousness. He showed the way to the Lotus Feet of Muruga. Arunagirinathar has visited / sung in praise of Lord Murugan in over 200 Temples.

A hunter came to the spot and wanted to drive away the parrots which hid themselves in an ant-hill. The hunter cut the ant-hillwhen parrot Sukha spread his wing to protect the Sivalinga in.Parrot Sukha was also attacked causing profuse bleeding and death.Blood also oozed out from the Linga.Realizing the truth, the hunter killed himself.

He would ignore the Ambal even though they were both sitting together. Angered by this, Ambal cursed Sage Birunki.

This temple is situated in the foot hills of Kolli Malai and historically it was called Koogai Malai. The original name of this place was Velavan Kurichi as one of the names of Murugan is Velavan ( one who holds the spear ). This place is also well known for its spice market where the produce from Kolli Hills are sold.\n\nThis temple is believed to pre-date Pazhani and hence the Lord is called Pazhani Appa and over a period of time, the temple came to be called Pazhaniappar Temple. Bhogar, the Siddhar, credited with the Pazhani Moola Vigraham, made it out of 9 poisonous substances ( Nava bashanams ) and the Abhisheka water has the powers to cure any disease. Before making the Pazhani Vigraham, Bhogar made a similar Murthy with the herbs of Kolli Hills and installed Him in Belukurichi. Hence it is even older than Pazhani and the Lord is called Pazhani Appa ( Pazhani’s father, in terms of antiquity)\n\nThis is the place where Murugan comes in the form of a Hunter to chase and marry Valli. Hence He appears as a Hunter in the Moolastanam. He faces the Western direction. The hair style is very peculiar with the hair knotted atop the head, typical of hunters and Konrai ( golden shower ) flowers adorn his head. He wears footwear on his feet, once again denoting outdoor activities ( a similar Murthy is seen in Sikkal, near Nagapattinam). His left hand though kept on hip, also holds a Cheval ( cock ). His right hand holds the Vajra Vel (spear). Generally the height of the spear used to be shorter than the Murthy. Here it is longer. It is clarified that the spear is having three points through which the Trimurthis bestowed Their powers on this Murugan and hence the spear is longer. As He is a Hunter, He also keeps a dagger ( pichuva kathi in Tamil ) in His waist band which is also made up of Konrai flowers .This unique makeup is seen in the Main Shrine, only in this temple though similar attire and posture in sub-shrines in other temples like Sikkal. The deity’s forehead is having the three lines of Vibhuthi ( holy ash ) with Vel ( spear ) in the middle. This symbolizes the union of Shiva and Shakti on this idol.\n\nThe midnight Pooja on the Pournami days ( full moon ) is very special and unique. On this day, when the abhihekam is completed, sweat emanates from the tip of the nose, chin and chest of the Lord and sweet fragrance of three different varieties are felt by the devotees. After alankaram is completed at 11.50 pm and the doors of the shrine would be closed. All the devottees would be waiting outside. It is believed that the 18 Siddhars come here for praying at mid night on that day. When the doors are opened at midnight, there would be evidence of Pooja being already performed with marked changes in the alankaram. This is believed to be happening even today.\n\nAt the entrance of the sanctum, a Shiva Linga is carved. In the Artha Mandap, two snakes are depicted, trying to swallow Sun and Moon ( Rahu and Ketu ). There is a green stone below these snakes and any one meditating sitting on this stone, is believed to get his prayers answered.\n\nThis is a very old temple of nearly 2000 years of existence. Val Vil Ori, the King of Kolli Hillsand one of the Kadayezhu Vallal or Philanthropists had prayed here and his close friend, the Tamil Poetess Avvayyar also prayed here.

Part of the section is in the Ghats with hair pin bends. Once a large number of sages were attracted by the serene atmosphere of this place. They were disturbed by demons in performing penance. A local sculptor made a beautiful female statue called Kolli Pavai and this was used to lure and destroy the demons so that the Rishis could continue with their penance.

When we stand at a particular point in this temple, we can have simultaneous darshan of all the main deities- Arapaleeswarar, Thayammai, Vinayaka and Murugan. A secret passage is believed to be in existence here, connecting this temple to the one in Rasipuram.\n\nKollimalai was part of the Chera Kingdom. One of its rulers Valvil Ori, was one of the 7 Kadeyezhu Vallals ( great philanthropists ) of the Tamil culture. He was instrumental in the temple construction and hence his statue is seen in this temple. One of the parts of the Ori kingdom was this hill which was known as Arapalli and hence the Lord came to be called Arapaleeswarar. Thirugnanasambandar and Appar have sung about this Lord. There is also a book of poem on Him called Arapaleeswara Sathakam.\n\nAs per another legend, this temple was established by Siddhars to propagate justice and morals ( Aram in Tamil ). Hence the Lord was called Arapaleeswarar. Even today there is a belief that this temple is frequented by Siddhars. Siddhar Kagabujangar is associated with this temple.\n\nDevotees feed the fishes found in Panchanadhi near the temple. The local tribals catch these fishes, do the noseboring on them and put them back in water. The fishes are never caught to be used as food. Ignoring this, once a traveller caught some fishes, cut them and started cooking. From the hot pot, the fishes jumped out, the cut pieces joined together and they went back to the river! Then there was an Asariri ( voice from the sky ) that all the creatures in this hill are part of Shiva and no one should hurt them.
