Please make me to do only good deeds in this earth, in order to reach your holy feet during my next birth.\n\nOh Lord Shiva, you know very well, that I pay great respect on you, I am able to talk, able to see, able to hear and able to walk only because of you, you are the most benevolent god who has granted sufficient things to me.\n\nOh Lord Shiva, please save me from the troubles and turmoil in this difficult Kali Yuga. People commits sins very easily due to the influence of Kali Purusha, hence, let you show mercy on me, in order to get rid from the clutches of Kali Purusha.\n\nOh Lord Shiva, after accepting you as my beloved god, I am finding great happiness on my life, I am finding your image on all the things present in the earth.
