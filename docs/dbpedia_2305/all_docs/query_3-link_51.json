The Dark Ages of Tamil History The Dark Ages of Tamil history consists of two periods. The first is the European Colonization from 1621 – 1948.

Tamil – Portuguese War of 1619 War broke out on 5 June 1619 between the Tamils and the Portuguese. Constantine de Saa ordered his military commander General Philippe de Oliveira to capture Jaffna. His total army was 230 Portuguese and more than 3000 Sinhala Buddhists. The Portuguese governor of Colombo, General Constantine de Saa defeated the Jaffna King.

The Sinhala had its own administration.\n\nAD 1833\n\n: The Colebrooke Commission Report of 1833 merged these territories with the rest of the island for supervisory convenience thus reducing the Tamil population to a minority status in the island. The Tamils were then subjected to discrimination, poverty, economic loss and racism and religious oppression from the majority Sinhala people.\n\nAD 1853 -1924\n\n: Sir Ponnabalam Arunachalam was the youngest son of Mudaliyar A. Ponnambalam and was born on 14 September 1853. In 1913 he was knighted at the hands of King George V at Buckingham Palace. He founded the Ceylon Tamil League putting forward the demand for a separate, sovereign state for the Tamils naming it “Tamil Eelam”. He died on 9 January 1924.\n\n13.4. Sri Lankan Colonization and Genocide of Tamils AD 1948\n\n: Third Tamil Genocide. The Sinhala nation takes possession of Eelam and commits genocide on millions of Tamils. It is the worst form of structural genocide in human history and is supported by Sinhala Buddhist scripture and mindset.

The figure of the Sinhala is sought to be made omnipresent and omnipotent in Tamil territories.\n\nAD 1948\n\n: The Sinhala implemented the Constitution of 1948 with genocidal intent against the Tamils as follows:\n\nAD 1948 - 1949\n\n: One Million Tamil plantation workers were disenfranchised through the Citizenship Act of 1948 and 1949. Sinhala settlers occupy the Tamil Homeland through state aided Sinhala colonization schemes and the process is continuing unabated.\n\nAD 1956\n\n: The Sinhala Only Act put an end to the equality of status of the Tamil and Sinhala languages and closed avenues of employment for the Tamils.\n\nAD 1970\n\n: The Education System discriminated against Tamil students denying them educational advancement and creating a huge mass of unemployed Tamil youth.\n\nAD 1970\n\n: Tamil areas were isolated from all national development projects and economically deprived.\n\nAD 1974\n\n: Pogroms were organized against the Tamil people by state sponsored racial riots by the Sinhala in 1956, 1958, 1961, 1974, 1977, 1979, 1981 and 1983 threatening the very survival of the Tamils. In 1983, violence between Tamil and Sinhala in Sri Lanka marks beginning of Tamil rebellion, demanding an independent nation called Tamil Eelam. The Sinhala murdered 37 Tamil Eelam political prisoners in jail.\n\nAD 1976\n\n: The Vaddukai Convention of May 1971 declared the restoration and reconstitution of the sovereign state of Tamil Eelam. TULF fought the General Elections of 1977 on this manifesto and won an overwhelming majority of votes. This was the people‟s mandate given in the last free elections ever held in the North East of Sri Lanka.\n\nAD 1976 – current\n\n: Tamil struggle continues.\n\n14. FOUNDER OF TAMIL HUMANISM  Thiruvalluvar\n\nThiruvalluvar is the founder of Tamil Humanism and is the author of the Tamil Marai. He is an internationally celebrated Tamil humanist. Thiruvalluvar‟s Path of Tamil Humanism is the Path of Virtue. Thiruvalluvar was born in Mayilapur in Tamil Nadu on 15 January 31 BC. It is the day after the Tamil New Year. Thiruvalluvar as a youth grew into a student, farmer and state advisor. He was a textile weaver by profession. Thiruvalluvar fell in love with Vasuki and their marriage was solemnised. She was a chaste, devoted and an ideal wife. Thiruvalluvar showed by example that a person can lead the life of a householder and at the same time lead a life of righteousness and with respect. A beautiful daughter was born. They named her Mullai and brought her up with loving care. In 300 BC, Elala Chola, the King of the Tamil country ruled over Eelam. Elelasingan was his descendent and ship merchant of Mayilapur. He accepted Thiruvalluvar as his teacher and was his first disciple. One day in the evening, Elelasingan and Mullai met in a garden and they fell in love with each other. Thiruvalluvar solemnized his marriage with Mullai. In 21 BC, Uggiraperuvazhuthi, the Tamil King, decided to send a delegation to Augustus Caesar and strengthen the trade link. He told the Romans visiting him that he is sending a delegation of merchants to Rome with Elelasingan as leader. Elelasingan left for Rome taking leave from Mullai. He left in the month of July and he promised Mullai he will return in December. Thiruvalluvar saw that many people in this world are living without understanding humanist principles. He stayed in his house in Mayilapur and began writing his book under a LLuppai tree. He formulated the concepts based on the 70 000 year old oral tradition of humanism and the 5000 year old Indus valley civilization, and the civilization of the four Tamil kingdoms of Pandya, Chola, Chera and Eelam. He wrote the philosophy of humanism into couplets in a book which he called Tamil Marai (Tamil Humanist Scripture). Thiruvalluvar also called it „Muppal‟. Muppal means three kinds of subjects which are righteousness, wealth and love. Thereafter he decided to travel propagating humanist principles to all people.\n\nHe travelled to Madurai to submit his work, „Muppal‟, to the Pandya king. The Pandya kings ensured that many Tamil poets flourished. The Tamil Sanggam of Madurai which is an assembly of eminent poets, scholars and researchers called his work „Thirukural‟. The Tamil Sanggam introduced the Thirukural to the world. The Tamil Marai is considered as the „Sacred Word of God‟. Thiruvalluvar is regarded as a Tamil prophet by the Tamil community. Thiruvalluvar said to the King: „a small dew drop depicts even a Palmyra tree, so also the Kural. Oh King, spread these spotless couplets. Preach to the world the humanist message of the Tamil Marai.‟ The Tamil Calendar is dated from the birth of Thiruvalluvar and is called Thiruvalluvar Aandu. The Tamil New Year begins on the 14 January which is the 1st day of the 1st month (Thai) of the Tamil calendar. The next day is celebrated as Thiruvalluvar Day as the 15 January is the birthday of Thiruvalluvar. This celebration of New Years Day and Thiruvalluvar Day is the Pongal Festival.\n\n15. LEADERS OF TAMIL HUMANISM\n\nThe two important leaders of Tamil Humanism are Mr. Seenivasa and Mr. R.M. Moodali. They are the two main authors of the books on Tamil Humanism. Therefore the books on Tamil Humanism are called the „SEENIVASA - MOODALI VERSION‟. They are the revivalists of Tamil Humanism.\n\n Seenivasa Seenivasa Padayachi was a great advocate of the Tamil Religion. He tirelessly propagated Tamil Spirituality in Tamil Nadu and in South Africa. The story of Seenivasa Padayachi is but a legend. The life of Seenivasa Padayachi and what we know is largely derived from oral traditions. What remains of his existence is the Tinley Manor Ragasiyam which he built in 1889 and the scriptures he recited with his last breathe in that Sanggam. Seenivasa Padayachi was born in 1861 in Chidambaram. His father was Sabapathi. He was 28 years old when he arrived in Durban. He was educated in Tamil and English. His wife was Valliammal and she was born in 1867 in Chidambaram. Seenivasa and Valliammal had three children. Seenivasa‟s father Sabapathi was a learned scholar and a Priest at Chidambaram. Some say he was a great yogi in Chidambaram. Sabapathi was born around 1801. Sabapathi taught Seenivasa the Tamil religion and culture in its purest form. He believed in Tamil Humanism and the Ragasiyam is the highest form of worship. He wanted all Tamils to worship in the Ragasiyam. Sabapathi‟s vision is: „A Ragasiyam in every town and village‟. However the Nayak Brahmins resisted and did not want all people to have the Truth. Legend says that Sabapathi‟s grandfather who was born around 1681 was also a Priest at Chidambaram. He promoted the Tamil religion and the freedom of all to worship the Ragasiyam The Ragasiyam is a Meditation and Cultural Hall. He resisted and challenged the Nayak Miliary rule. However the Nayak Hindu Brahmins still dominated the villages and Tamil Religion was still forbidden. This led to a conflict between the Nayak Hindu Brahmins and Seenivasa Padayachi when he promoted the Path of Virtue, the Tamil Religion.\n\nHe condemned the village chief and Nayak Brahmins in Chidambaram for promoting South Indian Hinduism. He encouraged the villagers to follow Tamil Humanism which is the Tamil religion. The villagers protest was increasing against the Nayak Brahmin priests. This conflict forced him into exile. If he continued living there his life and his family‟s safety was in danger. The Nayak Brahmin persecution forced him into exile. His exile brought him to the shores of South Africa, keeping the Tamil religion alive. He took his only priceless possession the Tamil Marai and together with his family boarded the ship headed for South Africa. Sabapathi gave Seenivasa his blessings to go to South Africa to protect the faith. He encouraged him to travel abroad to save the Tamil beliefs. When Seenivasa arrived the first thing he did was to go and search for land to build the Ragasiyam as per his father‟s wishes. He found many Tamils living in the North Coast of Natal. Seenivasa built the first Ragasiyam outside of India for the Tamils in Tinley Manor, Natal, South Africa. It was built out of wood and iron around July 1889. Alagiri also helped Seenivasa with the construction of the Ragasiyam. The Ragasiyam is the Hall for the Praise of God. The congregation in Tinley Manor assembled there and in front of them is a room of empty space. In this room hangs the golden leaves with the Tamil alphabet on it. This Ragasiyam is the purist form of Tamil worship. Tamils worship God in this way for thousands of years. They recited the Tamil Marai and other scriptures and conducted their ceremonies in this Ragasiyam. Seenivasa was involved in promoting the Tamil religion and culture in Tinley Manor. When his indentured contract expired after 5 years he moved to Germiston in 1894, Transvaal now called Gauteng. Seenivasa moved to Transvaal (Gauteng) because he knew there were many Tamils living here. In 1895 he built another Ragasiyam in Germiston. His vision was that wherever there is a Tamil community there should be a Ragasiyam. During his stay in Germiston, he opened a cigar factory. He would travel from Germiston to Ottawa, Tongaat then to Tinley Manor to buy the Tobacco leaves and bring them to Germiston. It was a flourishing business as he supplied the mines and shops with cigars. He hired a factory manager to manage the cigar manufacturing while he was away in Tinley Manor. He was a highly spiritual person always in meditation and study of the Tamil religion. Around 1900, while he was away in Tinley Manor, his wife Valliammal made a mistake and had an affair with the factory manager. On his arrival back to Germiston he came to know of it. He was disappointed but he forgave her. So he divorced her and decided to move back to Tinley Manor in Natal, KZN.\n\nHe gave her the house and the cigar business which made her financially independent. The children were well provided for and even their grandchildren still were financially well off. Seenivasa moved to Tinley Manor permanently in 1900. He lived there in meditation and study in the Tinley Manor Ragasiyam and established a Tamil Sanggam. He remarried to Alamalu and they had four children. Alamalu was born in 1872. Alamalu was an excellent caregiver and took care of Muniamma like her own child. Alamalu together with Muniamma, Lutchmana and Subbu visited the Tinley Manor Ragasiyam in 1901. Seenivasa met Alamalu and admired her caring and family qualities. She lived with the Lutchmana Naik‟s family until she got married to Seenivasa Padayachi in 1901. When Seenivasa married Alamalu, she moved to Tinley Manor. She eventually lived in Tinley Manor for the rest of her life. He propagated Tamil Humanism amongst the indentured labourers. He spent the rest of his life promoting the Tamil religion and culture in the Tinley Manor Ragasiyam. His last day on earth was unforgettable. He took his wife and children to the Tinley Manor Ragasiyam. He entered the Sanggam. Seenivasa Padayachi sat down in the Tinley Manor Tamil Sanggam, facing the congregation, his friends, his family and children for the last time. He smiled at his loving wife, Alamalu, and his children and began to speak about Tamil Humanism. He praised God through words, recited all the Tamil scriptures in English and Tamil and while chanting „Namasivaya‟ in the Sanggam he collapsed and died peacefully. And now the essence of Seenivasa Padayachi‟s recitation of Tamil Spirituality is presented to you.\n\n R.M. Moodali\n\nR.M. Moodali\n\nKamatchi Moodali\n\nR.M. Moodali is a political activist and an internationally renowned humanist. He made an immense contribution to the transformation of South Africa. Rajoo Munisami Moodali was born on 31 October 1907. He was the son of an indentured labourer Thayi. Thayi came from a district called South Arcot in Tamil Nadu. In 1914, Thayi died at the age of 41 years and R.M. Moodali was placed in an orphanage. From 1918 to 1930, he worked on Apartheid farms for a Mr. G. Duncan. In 1931 he worked as a waiter at Victoria hotel. In 1935, he worked for the Hulletts family as a chauffeur. In later years he did part time bookkeeping for small companies as White businesses did not give him work because of the Job Reservation Act. He went to the Wesleyan Missionary School in 1912, and had to leave school at Standard Four to work on the farm. In 1931 he completed a Bookkeeping course part time through correspondence. In 1940‟s he join the Study Circles and learnt politics and economics. This was the beginning of his political career. In 1940, he joined the South African Communist Party. Latter he joined the ANC and the NIC. In the 1980‟s he joined the UDF in the anti- Apartheid struggle. He continued to be involved in politics until 1994, that‟s a total of 53 years struggling for Human Rights. R.M. Moodali witnessed the rise and fall of Apartheid and participated actively in the Antiapartheid struggle. Throughout his life, he was a Human Rights activist. He attended the protest meetings. He received pamphlets, posters, listened to Radio Freedom, the Voice of the ANC and distributed the pamphlets and messages from door to door. He was a freedom fighter against colonialism and Apartheid. His response is the way millions of people responded to the leaders, until the disbanding of the Natal Indian Congress and UDF structures.\n\nR.M. Moodali was also a cultural activist. He belonged to various cultural organisations such as Stanger Youth Orchestra, Stanger Debating Society, The Rationalist Association of South Africa, Pretoria Tamil Rationalism Society, The Humanist Association of South Africa, Natal Buddhist Society, The Thirukural Society, International Movement for Tamil Culture: South Africa and many others. In the 1980‟s he suggested to his family and Babs about forming a Tamil humanist international society. He encouraged Mr Rowley Arenstein his old friend from the liberation struggle to join. R.M. Moodali was a loving person who went about his daily life with the universal principles of humanism. He was a humanist and a convinced atheist. He was talkative and an eloquent speaker. He was also a cultural activist who promoted the reformation of Tamils by rejecting the caste system, superstition, rituals and fatalistic beliefs. The most important thing that had to change was the Tamil belief system in order for them to become progressive. He was involved in promoting the Tamil culture and language. His understanding of the Tamil Marai was from a Tamil perspective which is the concept of the Moodali version. He promoted the Tamil language and he advocated other cultural and linguistics groups to promote theirs in unity and harmony as South Africans.
