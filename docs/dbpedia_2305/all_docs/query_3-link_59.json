        "text": "History\n\nShaiva Siddhanta's original form is uncertain. Some hold that it originated as a monistic doctrine, espoused by Tirumular (date unknown). It seems likely to others, however, that the early Åaiva SiddhÄnta may have developed somewhere in southern India, as a religion built around the notion of a ritual initiation that conferred liberation. Such a notion of liberatory initiation appears to have been borrowed from a Pashupata (pÄÅupata) tradition.[8] At the time of the early development of the theology of the school, the question of monism or dualism, which became so central to later theological debates, had not yet emerged as an important issue.\n\nTamil bhakti\n\nTirumurai The twelve volumes of Tamil Åaiva hymns of the sixty-three Nayanars PartsNameAuthor 1,2,3ThirukadaikkappuSambandar 4,5,6ThevaramThirunavukkarasar 7ThirupaatuSundarar 8Thiruvasakam &\n\nThirukkovaiyarManickavasagar 9Thiruvisaippa &\n\nTiruppallaanduVarious 10ThirumandhiramThirumular 11Various 12Periya PuranamSekkizhar Paadal Petra Sthalam Paadal Petra Sthalam Rajaraja I Nambiyandar Nambi\n\nFrom the fifth to the eighth CE Buddhism and Jainism had spread in Tamil Nadu before a forceful Shaiva bhakti movement arose. Between the seventh and ninth centuries, pilgrim saints such as Sambandar, Appar, Sundarar 63 nayanmars used songs of Shivaâs greatness to refute concepts of Buddhism and Jainism. Manikkavacakar's heart-melting verses, called Tiruvacakam, are full of visionary experience, divine love and urgent striving for truth. The songs of these four saints are part of the compendium known as Tirumurai which, along with the Vedas, Shaiva Agamas, and the Meykanda Shastras, are now considered to form the scriptural basis of the Åaiva SiddhÄnta in Tamil Nadu. It seems probable that the Tirumurai devotional literature was not, however, considered to belong to the Åaiva SiddhÄnta canon at the time when it was first composed:[9] the hymns themselves appear to make no such claim for themselves.\n\nThe Bhakti movement should not be exaggerated as an articulation of a 'class struggle', there is nevertheless a strong sense against rigid structures in the society.[10]\n\nIntegration\n\nIn the twelfth century, Aghorasiva, the head of a branch monastery of the Amardaka order in Chidambaram, took up the task of amalgamating Sanskrit and Tamil Siddhanta. Strongly refuting monist interpretations of Siddhanta, Aghorasiva brought a change in the understanding of Siva by reclassifying the first five principles, or tattvas (Nada, Bindu, Sadasiva, Isvara and Suddhavidya), into the category of pasa (bonds), stating they were effects of a cause and inherently unconscious substances, a departure from the traditional teaching in which these five were part of the divine nature of God.\n\nAghorasiva was successful in preserving the Sanskrit rituals of the ancient Ägamic tradition. To this day, Aghorasiva's Siddhanta philosophy is followed by almost all of the hereditary temple priests (Sivacharya), and his texts on the Ägamas have become the standard puja manuals. His Kriyakramadyotika is a vast work covering nearly all aspects of Shaiva Siddhanta ritual, including the daily worship of Siva, occasional rituals, initiation rites, funerary rites, and festivals.\n\nIn Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta, the thirteenth century Meykandar, Arulnandi Sivacharya, and Umapati Sivacharya further spread Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta. Meykandar's twelve-verse ÅivajÃ±Änabodham and subsequent works by other writers, all supposedly of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, laid the foundation of the Meykandar Sampradaya (lineage), which propounds a pluralistic realism wherein God, souls and world are coexistent and without beginning. Siva is an efficient but not material cause. They view the soul's merging in Siva as salt in water, an eternal oneness that is also twoness.\n\nSaiva Siddhanta today\n\nSaiva Siddhanta is practiced widely among the Saivas of southern India and Sri Lanka, especially by members of the Brahmins, Vellalar & Nagarathar community. It has over 5 million followers in Tamil Nadu, and is also prevalent among the Tamil diaspora around the world. It has thousands of active temples predominantly in Tamil Nadu and also in places around the world with significant tamil population and also has numerous monastic and ascetic traditions, along with its own community of priests, the Adishaivas, who are qualified to perform Agama-based Shaiva Temple rituals.\n\nTheology\n\nPart of a series onHindu philosophy Orthodox\n\nSamkhya\n\nYoga\n\nNyaya\n\nVaisheshika\n\nMimamsa\n\nVedanta\n\nHeterodox\n\nCharvaka\n\nÄjÄ«vika\n\nBuddhism\n\nJainism\n\nHinduism\n\nOther Indian philosophies\n\nTexts\n\nThe texts revered by the southern Saiva Siddhanta are the Vedas; the twenty-eight dualist Hindu Agamas, which form the ritual basis of the tradition; the twelve books of the Tamil Saiva canon called the Tirumurai, which contains the poetry of the Nayanars; and the Saiva Siddhanta Shastras.[11]\n\nEarly theology\n\nSiddhas such as Sadyojyoti (ca seventh century[12]) are credited with the systematization of the Siddhanta theology in Sanskrit. Sadyojyoti, initiated by the guru Ugrajyoti, propounded the Siddhanta philosophical views as found in the Rauravatantra and SvÄyambhuvasÅ«trasaá¹ graha. He may or may not have been from Kashmir, but the next thinkers whose works survive were those of a Kashmirian lineage active in the tenth century: RÄmakaá¹á¹­ha I, VidyÄkaá¹á¹­ha I, ÅrÄ«kaá¹á¹­ha, NÄrÄyaá¹akaá¹á¹­ha, RÄmakaá¹á¹­ha II, VidyÄkaá¹á¹­ha II. Treatises by the last four of these survive. King Bhoja of Gujarat (ca 1018) condensed the massive body of Siddhanta scriptural texts into one concise metaphysical treatise called the TattvaprakÄÅa.\n\nLater theology\n\nThe culmination of a long period of systematisation of its theology appears to have taken place in Kashmir in the tenth century, the exegetical works of the Kashmirian authors Bhatta Narayanakantha and Bhatta Ramakantha being the most sophisticated expressions of this school of thought.[13] Their works were quoted and emulated in the works of twelfth-century South Indian authors, such as Aghorasiva and Trilocanasiva.[14] The theology they expound is based on a canon of Tantric scriptures called Siddhantatantras or Shaiva Agamas. This canon is traditionally held to contain twenty-eight scriptures, but the lists vary,[15] and several doctrinally significant scriptures, such as the Mrgendra,[16] are not listed. In the systematisation of the ritual of the Shaiva Siddhanta, the Kashmirian thinkers appear to have exercised less influence: the treatise that had the greatest impact on Shaiva ritual, and indeed on ritual outside the Shaiva sectarian domain, for we find traces of it in such works as the Agnipurana, is a ritual manual composed in North India in the late eleventh century by a certain Somasambhu.[17]"
