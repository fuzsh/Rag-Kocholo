Inge Morath

Photographer Inge Morath (1923 – 2002) and artist Saul Steinberg (1914 – 1999) engaged in a unique collaboration by having friends and acquaintances don paper bags drawn with fantastic faces and then posing them for photographs. In a delightful series of individual and group portraits taken from 1959 to 1963 the images convey both humor and an unnerving psychological depth. We may not know who is beneath each bag, but we seem to know the type they are playing. Between Morath's deadpan style and Steinberg's flights of fantasy they created a veritable encyclopedia of attitudes, postures, and mannerisms.

Inge Morath joined the photographic cooperative Magnum in Paris by invitation of Robert Capa in 1953 and was assistant to Henri Cartier-Bresson before becoming a full member. Her work was widely published in magazines, including Life, Paris Match, and Vogue, and in numerous books.

Ms. Morath was married to Arthur Miller and they had one daughter, the film director Rebecca Miller.

In 2015 the Bienecke Library at Yale acquired the bulk of the Inge Morath Estate.
