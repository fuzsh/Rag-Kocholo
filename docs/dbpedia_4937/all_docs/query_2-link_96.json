        "text": "Inge Morath, who has died of lymphatic cancer aged 78, was a photographer with two of the earliest leading photo agencies, Magnum and Report. Her stunning black and white images appeared in leading magazines, and she worked as Henri Cartier-Bresson's assistant and with artists Saul Steinberg and Louise Bourgeois. In 1962, after his divorce from Marilyn Monroe, whom she had photographed, she married the playwright Arthur Miller.\n\nMorath was a fine photographer in the classical reportage tradition. She preferred to spend extended periods living with an individual project \"to let it grow\". Several developed into lasting relationships with people and places she would revisit. Occasionally, she would shoot in colour, as though to lift a particularly exotic topic or as her work in films demanded, most notably on John Huston's Moulin Rouge (1953). Although published extensively in Life, Paris Match, the Saturday Evening Post and Vogue, she gained satisfaction mainly from producing travel books, nearly always backed by touring exhibitions.\n\nBorn in Austria, to liberal Protestant parents who were both research scientists, she and her family were living in Germany when the second world war broke out. Morath was punished for refusing to join the Hitler Youth by being given forced labour at Tempelhof airport; this was exhausting and dangerous work, as it was a repeated Allied target. Her wartime experiences, and the horror and poverty she witnessed in its aftermath, left her unable to photograph war.\n\nIn 1944, Morath graduated in Romance languages at Berlin University. From the end of the war, she worked as an interpreter for the United States Information Service for five years, and then for Rot-Weiss-Rot, the Austrian radio network, where she honed her writing skills. By 1949, she was a contributor to the literary magazine Der Optimist, and the Austrian editor on Heute.\n\nShe also worked with the Austrian photographer Ernst Haas, who was based in Paris and involved in the earliest days of Magnum. Morath became a writer, researcher and intermittent desk editor, writing text captions for Haas, and for fellow Austrian Erich Lessing. In 1951, she moved to London, came into contact with Picture Post magazine, started taking her own photographs, and was briefly married (for three weeks) to one of its principal journalists, Lionel Birch.\n\nIn 1952, she undertook her photographic apprenticeship with Simon Guttman - a man almost as legendary for his cantankerous perfectionism as for his photo-agency, Report - and, from 1954, was Cartier-Bresson's assistant.\n\nMorath and her Leica made their first lengthy foray to Spain in 1954. After Franco's death in 1975, the country's rapid development as a cutprice holiday playground spurred her further into the interior. Her insistence on travel over tourism, on making new discoveries and learning the language, led even her early European stories to reveal intimate, unexpected, and often amusing, qualities.\n\nIn her own telegram style of writing, she noted how, in 1955, the \"great event was Robert Capa's inviting me to join Magnum now as a photographer on the strength of my pictures and text on French worker priests, which was three months in doing.\" Her travels increased, always bringing her new friends - she was as interested in peasants as in intellectuals - and her obsession with literature meant that her itineraries were always produced with reference to writers whose work she read in the original language.\n\nMorath's first book, Guerre Ã  la Tristesse/Fiesta In Pamplona, with text by Dominique Aubier, had been published in 1954. It was followed by Venice Observed (with Mary McCarthy, 1956), Bring Forth The Children (with Yul Brynner, 1960), Tunisia (with fellow Magnum photographer Marc Riboud and texts by Claude Roy and Paul Sebag, 1961), and From Persia To Iran (with Edouard Sablier, 1961).\n\nShe first met Arthur Miller in 1960 on the set of The Misfits, while on an assignment to document Marilyn Monroe's acting. After their marriage, Morath and Miller began to travel together, mostly eastwards, and her 1969 book, In Russia, included text by him. It was followed by My Sister Life (1973), with poems by Boris Pasternak.\n\nMorath extended her travels to Asia, pursued eastern philosophy, taught herself Mandarin, and, in 1979, accompanied Miller to China for the staging of his Death Of A Salesman, a trip that generated two further books: Chinese Encounters (1979) and Salesman In Beijing (1984). The same eye that had gently parodied the British class system sharply perceived Mao's new social order.\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, Morath stayed home for longer periods. She made little alteration to the country house in Roxbury, Vermont, where Miller and Monroe had lived, beyond turning the heart-shaped swimming pool back into a natural lake, where she swam daily. Her long-term projects included making a book of Steinberg's masks and a reportage on Bourgeois's sculptures.\n\nAs she grew older, the couturier clothes of her Paris years were discarded in favour of those more suitable to a daily life that included yoga, swimming and gardening. She maintained her ample European cuisine, preparing goulasch for her guests while quietly keeping to a vegetarian diet herself. We would eat at a table Miller had made, under posters of Chinese calligraphy and her own favourite portraits, including the large, befurred woman with her pooch and her flunkey in Pall Mall.\n\nShe reissued earlier work on Spain and undertook a massive review of the Danube, following the river from source to mouth. In 1999, after a host of retrospective exhibitions and awards, she published her Life As A Photographer. In it, Miller commented that it was \"not only a process of catching the subject's soul, but of the moment seizing Morath at the same instant\".\n\nShe is survived by Miller and their daughter Rebecca, a writer and director married to the actor Daniel Day-Lewis."
