        "text": "We took a trip up the California coast to celebrate our 40th anniversary with some great wine and a great meal at The Gathering Table at the Ballard Inn. On our return trek, we stopped in Santa Barbara's newly renovated Museum of Art which never disappoints. Among other things, we saw 2 photography & contemporary art exhibits which are running now through Dec 5. Well worth stopping for if you're in the area.\n\nOf particular interest to me, was an Inge Morath collection of gelatin silver prints. If her name doesn't spark instant recognition, that's okay because her work probably does. Throughout the 50-60s, Magnum photographer Morath captured many internationally famous people including husband Arthur Miller, Pablo Picasso, Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Yves St. Laurent and many more... But this iconic one from SBMA's permanent collection is my personal favorite.\n\nNancy O'Sheaâ€” Product User, Community Expert & Moderator"
