        "text": "Description\n\nInge Morath's \"favorite portrait\" of her husband, Arthur Miller\n\nInteresting mini archive of items relating to playwright Arthur Miller and his wife, photographer Inge Morath, which is highlighted by a beautiful original semi-glossy 11 x 14 silver gelatin photograph of Miller that was taken by Morath, showing the writer seated at a table with eyedrops, a glass of water, an eyeglasses case, and an Oxford dictionary, signed on his sleeve in black ink by Miller, and the reverse is signed in ink by Morath, who adds the title, “Arthur Miller, Roxbury, CT!” Included with the photo are four letters — three ALSs and one TLS — from Morath, signed “Inge Morath” or “Inge Morath Miller,” each sent to the original buyer of the Miller photograph, who purchased it directly through Morath and her agency, Magnum Photos. The letters, dated between March and May 1993, all concern the sale of the photograph, with Morath mentioning the couple’s travels to India, London, and Argentina, while also proclaiming the photo as “my favorite portrait of him.” In overall fine condition. Accompanied by the original Magnum Photos mailing envelope."
