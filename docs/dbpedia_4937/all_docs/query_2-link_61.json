        "text": "The Magnum Foundation and the Inge Morath Foundation announce the 15th annual Inge Morath Award. The annual award of $5,000 is given to a female photographer under the age of 30, to support the completion of a long-term documentary project. One award winner and up to two finalists are selected by a jury composed of Magnum photographers and the director of the Inge Morath Foundation.\n\nInge Morath was an Austrian-born photographer who was associated with Magnum Photos for nearly fifty years. After her death in 2002, the Inge Morath Foundation was established to manage Morath’s estate and facilitate the study and appreciation of her contribution to photography. Because Morath devoted much of her enthusiasm to encouraging women photographers, her colleagues at Magnum Photos established the Inge Morath Award in her honor. The award is now administered by the Magnum Foundation as part of its mission of supporting the next generation of socially-conscious documentary photographers, in cooperation with the Inge Morath Foundation.\n\nPast winners of the Inge Morath Award include: Danielle Villasana (US, ’15), Winner, for A Light Inside; Shannon Jensen (US, ’14), for A Long Walk; Isadora Kosofsky (US, ’12), for Selections from “The Three” and “This Existence”; Zhe Chen (China, ’11) for Bees; Lurdes R. Basolí (Spain, ’10) for Caracas, The City of Lost Bullets and Claire Martin (Australia, ’10) for Selections from The Downtown East Side and Slab City; Emily Schiffer (US, ’09) for Cheyenne River; Kathryn Cook (US, ’08) for Memory Denied: Turkey and the Armenian Genocide; Olivia Arthur (UK, ’07) for The Middle Distance; Jessica Dimmock (US, ’06) for The Ninth Floor; Mimi Chakarova (US, ’06) for Sex Trafficking in Eastern Europe; Claudia Guadarrama (MX, ’05) for Before the Limit; and Ami Vitale (US, ’02), for Kashmir.\n\nDeadline:\n\nAll proposals must be submitted by April 30th, 2016.\n\nAnnouncement of Winner:\n\nThe winner of the Inge Morath Award will be announced on the web sites of the Magnum Foundation and the Inge Morath Foundation in July, 2016.\n\nFine Print:\n\nAll submissions must consist of work done solely by the submitting photographer.\n\nPhotographers represented by Magnum Photos and their immediate relatives are not eligible.\n\nIM Award recipients and finalists grant the Magnum Foundation a license to reproduce, display and distribute their submissions solely in connection with the administration and judging of the Inge Morath Award, including on the Magnum Foundation website and the Inge Morath Foundation website.\n\nIM Award recipients agree that any future publication, exhibition or display of the funded project shall credit the Inge Morath Award and the Magnum Foundation.\n\nUpon completion of the funded project, a final (digital) copy must be provided to the Magnum Foundation. The Foundation, in furtherance of its charitable purposes, may, in the future, (1) display the project on its website and make it available for display on the website of the Inge Morath Foundation; and (2) publicly display the project (or excepts from it) in connection with exhibitions or promotional materials related to the Inge Morath Award. The Foundation will credit the artist as the author and copyright holder of her photographs.\n\nIM Award recipients may be required to provide additional identifying information prior to receiving payment."
