        "text": "\"There's a lot of red, a particular wonderful red, you can see she's very attracted to,\" says Rebecca Miller of her mother, the photographer Inge Morath. Looking at these pictures – the flashing flamenco skirts, the luminous car in the dark London street, the scarlet signage on an Edward Hopperesque scene of urban America – it's hard to understand why her work in colour has been hidden for so long. \"Colour connected her to painting; in a way black and white was reportage. She always found a kind of poetry in the everyday, but colour pushed her more in that direction.\"\n\nPhotojournalists such as Morath – the first woman to become a full member of the Magnum agency, in 1955 – took pictures on both types of film. Influenced by founder member Robert Capa, they pioneered a new way of telling stories with sequences of images, which they sold to magazines such as Holiday and Life. At first, Morath had only one camera. \"If I had to do colour and black and white simultaneously,\" she recalled, \"I'd finish one, then do [the other], trying not to think of both at the same time; the thinking is so different!\"\n\nSo, too, was the way in which the images were regarded. While black and white stories were treated as fine art, colour was seen as essentially commercial, so for many years Morath and others viewed their work in colour as secondary. Museums and publishers were interested only in black and white, and no one challenged them. As Walker Evans, influential editor of Fortune magazine, put it, \"Colour photography is vulgar.\"\n\nIt was a view echoed by Magnum co-founder Henri Cartier-Bresson, who only ever shot in black and white. In 1953, Morath became his assistant and, travelling the world with him, this student of languages discovered her vocation. She worked in both colour and black and white right from the start of her career, regardless of Cartier-Bresson's feelings about the former, yet the pictures reproduced here, spanning 1953-61 (after she left Austria and before she married the playwright Arthur Miller), would not be seen until after her death in 2002.\n\nThe way in which Magnum catalogued its images helped keep them hidden: black and white negatives were filed under the photographer's name with contact sheets and captions; colour transparencies were archived by subject rather than story. So, for example, when Morath went on assignment in 1954 to photograph Parisian models with large dogs, the transparencies were simply stored under the heading \"Animals\".\n\nIt has taken two years of work by the Inge Morath Foundation, starting with 68 binders and two filing cabinets of unsorted transparencies, to restore some of her original sequences. Last year 7,000 colour originals were rescued from storage. Thousands more slides remain undocumented.\n\nFor Miller, it's the Spanish pictures that stand out: \"She had a real love affair with Spain, and one of her great actual love affairs there. She responded to the severity and romance of the culture. She was a serious person but had a whimsical side. The wave of surrealism was still breaking over her. You can see the overlay. Colour can feel more literal, black and white more lifted away from the everyday. But I don't think she treated colour in an offhand way or looked down on it.\"\n\nWhat did Morath think her own best work? \"It's hard for me to say. She was very modest, reluctant even to think of herself as an artist. But she was very serious about it. She dedicated her life to it.\""
