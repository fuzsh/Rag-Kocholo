        "text": "Born on 27 May 1923 in Graz, Austria. After studying Romance languages in Berlin and Bucharest, she worked as a journalist for print media and radio stations. Her first forays into the field of photography were as a picture editor for Simon Guttmann in London. Her friendship with Ernst Haas led to an encounter with Robert Capa. In 1953, she was accepted into the Magnum agency. This was quickly followed by her first solo exhibition in 1956, along with several book publications. Her travels took her across Europe, Africa, the Orient, the USA, USSR, China, Japan, Thailand and Cambodia, with frequent publications of her reportages in international magazines. Inge Morath passed away in New York on 30 January 2002.\n\nEvery year since 2002, the Inge Morath Foundation together with the Magnum agency awards a grant designed to support female young photographers.
