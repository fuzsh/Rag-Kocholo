        "text": "Background information\n\n\"Inge Morath (1923-2002) was the first woman in the MAGNUM agency, this legendary male-dominated institution for quality photojournalism to this day. Born in Graz and raised in Darmstadt and Berlin, she learned photography with Ernst HAAS in Vienna, with Simon GUTTMAN in London and with Henri CARTIER-BRESSON in Paris before Robert CAPA brought her to MAGNUM in 1955. She spoke five languages, including Russian and Mandarin, interacted with intellectuals, artists and actors, of whom she took unforgettable portraits, and brought back reportage from all over the world, from all over Europe, Africa, the Near and Middle East, Russia and China. Exclusively for MAGNUM, she also photographed on many film sets, such as Marilyn Monroe's last film, 'The Misfits', for which Arthur Miller, then Marilyn's husband, had written the screenplay. After their divorce, Inge Morath married the playwright.\n\nContent\n\nThe catalog volume 'Hommage' to the retrospective exhibition on the occasion of the 100th birthday of Inge MORATH shows the whole spectrum and the - perhaps feminine? - subtlety of her work. An autobiographical speech she gave in Berlin in 1994 is the main text of the accompanying German-English publication in Munich.\" (Â© Schirmer/Mosel verlag, 2023)\n\nAbout the Austrian Magnum photographer Inge MORATH (1923-2002)"
