        "text": "CLAIRbyKahn together with the Erich Hartmann Estate and the Inge Morath Estate are delighted to announce that the National Gallery of Ireland has acquired works by Erich Hartmann and Inge Morath.\n\nThe acclaimed museum has purchased portfolios of photographs by Hartmann and Morath that were shot in Ireland in the middle of the 20th century. These images will be included in the National Gallery’s first-ever photography exhibition: A View of Ireland : Collecting Photography, that will run from October 26, 2019 to February 2, 2020.\n\nEstablished in 1854 by an Act of Parliament, and opened to the public in 1864, the National Gallery of Ireland is one of Europe’s earliest public art galleries. It houses a collection of over 16 300 works of art spanning the early Renaissance to the present day, including paintings by Titian, Caravaggio, Vermeer, Monet, and Picasso.\n\n“We are very proud to be able to work with such an esteemed institution to help safeguard and share these masterful images of Ireland,” says CLAIRbyKahn director Anna-Patricia Kahn. “This is an exceptional opportunity to introduce Erich Hartmann and Inge Morath to new audiences and to emphasize the deep connection they felt to the Irish landscape and people.”"
