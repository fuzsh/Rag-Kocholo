        "text": "Graduate Shirin Abedi wins this year’s Inge Morath Award for her student work “May I have this Dance.” Each year, the Magnum Foundation honors a female or non-binary photographer under 30 with this award, which provides Shirin Abedi with $7,500 to complete her project “May I Have This Dance.” In the reportage, the German-Iranian photographer tells the story of five young ballet dancers in Iran. Under the misogynistic regime, these dancers have to face tough obstacles: for example, the fathers of the dancers are never allowed to attend any of the ballet performances.\n\nShirin Abedi commented that she was honored to receive the award. Inge Morath was a pioneer and a role model for many women. She herself concludes, “For me, this is a sign to believe in myself and to acknowledge that I too can be a progressive woman for my society.” The Inge Morath Award is presented every year. The jury includes full members of the famous Magnum photo agency, including some of the most successful photographers of their time. The prize honors the photographer of the same name, who died in 2002.\n\nShirin Abedi graduated from Hanover College in 2021. Her photographs have already been published in Stern, Zeit Online, Krautreporter and the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail. She also sits on the jury of the German Youth Photography Award and passes on her knowledge in workshops."
