        "text": "Chinese Encounters\n\n[INSCRIBED] Morath, Inge and Arthur Miller\n\nNew York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1979. First Edition, First Printing.\n\nSmall Quarto (9 3/4 x 7 3/4 inches; 247 x 195 mm), 252, [4] pages in blue cloth, silver titles to spine, in a photo-illustrated dust jacket.\n\nINSCRIBED on the half title to William and Rose Styron: \"For Rose and Bill / A little guidance from under the / Earth. / As ever, / Arthur [and] Inge.\" (Written in Arthur Miller's hand; Inge Morath has signed her name.) A terrific literary association.\n\nThis volume presents spectacular color and black-and-white photographs by Inge Morath and extensive text by her playwright husband, Arthur Miller. They visited China in 1978, and talked with artists and ordinary people during the political thaw that followed Chairman Mao's death and the downfall of the loathsome Gang of Four. A fascinating look at China as it attempted to come to terms with the madness of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThis book will be especially interesting to theater lovers; Miller relates fascinating anecdotes about his meetings with actors and playwrights.\n\nCONDITION: Very Good or better, with foxing to the fore edge and bottom edge. The unclipped dust jacket has some light rubbing and a small split at the top of the lower panel where it meets the spine. Item #1134"
