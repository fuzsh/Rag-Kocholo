        "text": "As published in Creative Image Magazine (Print Edition), Volume 2 Issue 3\n\nPhotographs: The Inge Morath Foundation/Magnum Photos\n\nText: Cheryl Mukherji\n\nWoman. What makes her who she is, as she stands in front of you poised – with the sea storming inside, her exuberance at the brim, and a gaze that sends a hundred hearts to war?\n\nAs I delve into photographs by Inge Morath, the answer begins to unravel with each one: of women from everyday life, uninhibited, without pretense, basking in their true nature, being unapologetically themselves. Her photographs ranging from posed portraits of celebrities like actress Jayne Mansfield, to joyfully candid like her picture of Marilyn Monroe on the sets of The Misfits–caught in an unguarded moment as she walked dreamily beneath some trees–to snatched images of anonymous passers-by. Often they celebrated the human capacity for pleasure – Bedouin women dancing in the desert, Princess Troubetzkoy in her costume as Prince Youssou, among others.\n\nInge Morath was born in Graz, Austria, in 1923. She was drafted for factory service in Berlin, alongside Ukrainian prisoners of war, towards the end of World War II. During an attack on the factory by Russian bombers, she fled on foot to Austria. Despite having been raised amidst and faced with the direct consequences of war, Morath refused to photograph it, preferring to work on stories that celebrated life. “During the war, you had to keep your mouth shut a lot of the time, so you learned to observe more closely”, she said in an interview. It was this capacity for an observation that informed her photography. She believed that, when you take a picture, “you trust your eye, and cannot help but bare your soul”. Morath’s work was motivated by a fundamental humanism, shaped as much by her experience of war as by its lingering shadow over post-war Europe.\n\nMorath’s photographs show an invariable intimate relationship with her subjects. It is as if her work is an ongoing series of observations, memories, and experiences of the life she made for herself. Her poetic and somewhat theatrical depiction of elegance made her portraits of women stand out. “It’s a certain kind of appreciation of lovely things that she had that was particular to her time,” said her daughter, Rebecca Miller. Morath’s portrayal of the female is refreshing, that challenges the male gaze in photography. In her photos, the story of womanhood becomes intriguing and urgent. In her career, she slowly transitioned to taking portraits of women living in London. One of the most striking portraits from this series is that of publisher Eveleigh Nash at Buckingham Palace Mall.\n\nInge Morath worked as a researcher and assistant to Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris. Working with contact sheets sent to the Magnum office by the founding member fascinated Morath. “I think that in studying his way of photographing I learned how to photograph myself before I ever took a camera into my hand.” Morath went ahead to become the first woman to become a full member of Magnum Photos.\n\nInge Morath photographed the iconic beauty Marilyn Monroe on the sets of The Misfits where she met playwright Arthur Miller for the first time. “Marilyn liked her at once, appreciating her considerate kindness and the absence – remarkable of a photographer – of aggression. She doted a little on the pictures Inge Morath had taken of her, sensing real affection in them,” said Arthur Miller in his autobiography Timebends. During this time, Marilyn and Arthur’s marriage was speeding rapidly towards the end of its life, culminating in divorce– and whilst Miller claimed there was nothing between him and Morath during filming, he went on to marry the photographer in 1962. Miller has described their years together “the best” of his life and he dedicated his autobiography (published 1987) to her.\n\n”She made poetry out of people and their places over half a century,”\n\n-Arthur Miller\n\nHonor Moore, a poetess whom Inge Morath photographed and remembered fondly said, “But her work, regardless of her gender, stands alone as lively, fun, and contemplative all at once. From kitchen to garden, to New York, Paris, Vienna, up the Danube, on pilgrimage in Spain, to Kansas or China: always carrying the Leica returning, telephoning: “I am back. You must come soon, darling, while it is all still fresh.” And while moving, camera at hip or eye, she’s understanding you, whatever language you speak. She speaks German, French, English, Spanish, Italian, Romanian, Russian, and Chinese. When I beg her to write an autobiography, a mournful, almost desperate look crosses her face. “Different parts of my life have happened in so many different languages! How would I choose!?”\n\nMoore dedicated a poem to Morath, composing:\n\nI watched her, long fingers moving\n\nin failing light, framing the air with stretched hands. Might she\n\nphotograph me? She arrived in the morning. From my open door,\n\nwatching her leap from the car, flimsy red camera bag, jeans, shirt\n\nrolled to the forearm, the quick suggestion I sit, fingers\n\nadjusting the lens, her icon face in March light. You’ll see\n\nsorrow in my eyes in the one she chose. In the dining room,\n\nshe asked me to stand against the wall, camera sliding\n\nacross her face. Was I working? Was I happy? As if to work"
