        "text": "“… almost like entering a dream one had had many times. I loved the people, they let me photograph them, but also they wanted me to listen to them, to tell me what they knew, so that we told their story together.”“… almost like entering a dream one had had many times. I loved the people, they let me photograph them, but also they wanted me to listen to them, to tell me what they knew, so that we told their story together.”\n\n– Inge Morath, MagnumPhotos.com\n\n“Reno, initially, and The Misfits in particular, was a circus for Inge; a rich mine of subjects. My first glimpse of her was in the Mapes Hotel coffee shop, where she was sitting at a table laughing with John Huston. She had worked on Huston’s film Moulin Rouge some time earlier, and had earned his respect as an artist. Huston’s admiration and respect came in part from the work, of course, but it was also because of her bravery. As far as he was concerned, that was the major virtue of anyone.\n\nInge took comparatively few pictures. When she pointed the camera she felt a certain responsibility for what it was looking at. Her pictures of Marilyn are particularly empathic and touching as she caught Marilyn’s anguish beneath her celebrity, the pain as well as her joy in life. Many of the pictures of the Magnum group have become part of the mythology of The Misfits. Inge’s, I think, are especially tender and beautiful.”\n\n– Arthur Miller, from a conversation at the Howard Greenberg Gallery, New York, 2004.\n\n“Eli and Marilyn were like buddies, and you can see it… Marilyn Monroe was marvelous to look at; there was a shimmery, mother-of-pearl quality totally her own. Since she quite frequently arrived hours late to the set, co-stars and crew would go off into a hot semi-drowsiness, but madly jumped to their feet at the first sight of her car. Her arrival was invariably felt like an electric shock. It was a fantastic world; we photographers were glad to be outsiders.”\n\n– Inge Morath, from a conversation with Gail Levin for Making the Misfits, © Great Performances, Thirteen/WNET, 2001.\n\n“Inge believed that to photograph a place you had to know the language. So she studied Chinese for about seven years before she went to China, and she did, similarly, with Russian before she went to Russia. Travel with her was a privilege because I would never have been able to penetrate that way.”\n\n– Arthur Miller, from a conversation at the Howard Greenberg Gallery, New York, 2004.\n\n“Inge Morath was, above all, a traveller…Her approach to a story was ‘to let it grow’, without any apparent concern for narrative structure, trusting in her experience and interests to shape her work rather than in an editorial formula … She unsentimentally made pictures that were guided by her relationship to a place. These relationships were invariably intimate and long-lasting; she regularly revisited the places she chose to photograph…””Inge Morath was, above all, a traveller…Her approach to a story was ‘to let it grow’, without any apparent concern for narrative structure, trusting in her experience and interests to shape her work rather than in an editorial formula … She unsentimentally made pictures that were guided by her relationship to a place.
