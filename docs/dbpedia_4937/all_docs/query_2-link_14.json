        "text": "Portrait\n\nWhen I sat down, my hands felt impossible. Just fold them,\n\nshe said, looking, pressing the button, shifting the angle,\n\npressing again. The portrait is black and white, the settee\n\nblue and orange, behind me a corner of my grandmother’s\n\nself-portrait. I thought I looked old, but, gesturing as if\n\nsmoothing a tablecloth, she said, Your face has an asymmetry\n\nI like. We met at the house of a dancer, they were all friends,\n\nso I was quiet, near her husband at the round table. It was June,\n\nand how do I remember this? We had London broil, cooled\n\nto room temperature. When I noticed raspberry on my shirt,\n\nshe and her husband were telling a story—Cambodia, escaping\n\nto Laos as the Vietnamese advanced, she had photographed\n\nAngkor Wat, the daughter a child, airport closed, crossing\n\nborders in the rain forest. I watched her, long fingers moving\n\nin failing light, framing the air with stretched hands. Might she\n\nphotograph me? She arrived in the morning. From my open door,\n\nwatching her leap from the car, flimsy red camera bag, jeans, shirt\n\nrolled to the forearm, the quick suggestion I sit, fingers\n\nadjusting the lens, her icon face in March light. You’ll see\n\nsorrow in my eyes in the one she chose. In the dining room,\n\nshe asked me to stand against the wall, camera sliding\n\nacross her face. Was I working? Was I happy? As if to work\n\nwas to be happy. In Paris, she photographed Cocteau, Picasso;\n\nin Russia, Nadezhda Mandelstam, in New York, elsewhere,\n\nso many my portrait traveled with, hair messily piled, broken\n\nhair stick, eyes sorrowful, to Barcelona, Vienna, Paris . . .\n\nNight after night, they invited me to supper. We thought\n\nyou seemed a little lost. I gave her precise gifts, and she,\n\nscorning the purchased, gave things she had—the string of\n\nEgyptian beads, a sea-blue scarab, a silver hand, the mandala\n\non rice paper. Last Christmas Eve, pale scarf already wrapping\n\nher head, I opened her presents, the book about saints, a walnut\n\ncarved with tiny faces of the Buddha. I waited to open\n\nthe flat box, leaning close to keep her warm, almost reluctantly\n\nlifting the lid, my younger eyes shocking my present ones\n\nto tears. It’s how you looked then. Then? When had that March day\n\nceased to be part of now? Through the Christmas supper she had been\n\ntoo weak to cook, we sat, dancer, daughter, husband, beloveds,\n\nas if by humbly enacting this night, we might forestall what was,\n\nhave back that summer I was lost and they found me, equinox\n\nsky bright, the three of us cavorting, wide lawn blackening\n\nat the edge of the entire earth, dark falling like a spangled veil.\n\nSome Notes about Inge Morath\n\nFrom kitchen to garden, to New York, Paris, Vienna, up the Danube, on pilgrimage in Spain, to Kansas or China, always carrying the Leica, returning, telephoning: “I am (or we are) back. You must come soon, darling, while it is all still fresh.” And while moving, camera at hip or eye, she’s understanding you, whatever language you speak. She speaks German, French, English, Spanish, Italian, Romanian, Russian, and Chinese. When I beg her to write an autobiography, a mournful, almost desperate look crosses her face. “Different parts of my life have happened in so many different languages! How would I choose!?”\n\nI met Inge Morath, her husband Arthur Miller, and their daughter Rebecca Miller, when I moved to Connecticut in 1984. Our friendship, as women and artists, brought closer the catastrophes of the 20th century with which her life had made her intimate. Born in Graz, Austria, in 1923, educated in Berlin and Bucharest, she was drafted in 1944 to work at a munitions factory in Berlin. In the chaos of the Russian advance in April 1945, she escaped, making her way on foot to Salzburg where she was reunited with her parents. After the war she worked as a photojournalist, becoming in 1955 the first woman to join Magnum. Based in Paris, often working with her friend Henri Cartier-Bresson, she photographed extensively in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. After her marriage to Miller in 1962, whom she met photographing the shooting of The Misfits, she lived in Connecticut, pursuing assignments and independent projects.\n\nInge Morath received the Gold Medal of the National Arts Club, the Austrian State Prize for Photography, and the Gold Medal of Honor of the City of Vienna. Her photographs are collected in more than 30 volumes, including Inge Morath: Life as a Photographer (Kehayoff Books, 1999). The landscape reproduced here is the border between Slovenia and Styria; the portrait, taken in 1985, is published in Portraits (Aperture, 1986) and the photograph on pilgrimage in Camino de Santiago (Universidad de Santiago de Compostela, 1998)."
