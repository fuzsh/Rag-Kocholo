        "meta_description": "Since its founding in 1990, the Danziger Gallery has established itself as one of the leading photography venues in the world, known for the originality and diversity of its programming, its representation of established photographers, and the influence of its new discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe gallery was the first to show Susan Derges’ \"camera-less\" photographs; Robert Franks from the Penn Collection; and the experimental work of artists such as Liz Nielsen and Yuji Obata.\r\n\r\nMoving this year to a bi-level space on New York’s Lower East Side has afforded the gallery a certain nimbleness in terms of its programming allowing it to mount major shows while also responding quickly to new artists and the technological evolution of the medium. Its programming pulls from the worlds of art, new media, and print to create an up to date vision of photography's place in the world.\r\n\r\nThe gallery maintains an ongoing close creative relationship with its own roster as well as a strong collaborative relationship with other galleries and artists. Outside collaborations include two exhibitions with Jack Pierson (in association with Cheim and Read), several projects (both past and ongoing) with Chuck Close, and three exhibitions of Andy Warhol photographs in conjunction with the Andy Warhol Foundation. \r\n\r\nThis past year has seen gallery artists on view in museums in Tokyo, London, Lausanne, Paris, and throughout the U.S..  Paul Fusco's Robert F Kennedy Funeral Train – Rediscovered - a project originated by the gallery in 2008 - was featured at the recent Gwanjgu Biennale in Korea and is now in the collections of The Addison Museum, The Norton Museum of Art, The High Museum of Art, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography.  Susan Derges was featured in this year’s Houston Fotofest; and Mark Cohen was exhibited at and The Victoria and Albert Museum.  Most recently, Hans Breder’s work was acquired by The Getty, The Whitney, The Museum of Fine Arts Houston, and The Milwaukee Art Museum.",

        "text": "Inge Morath\n\nPhotographer Inge Morath (1923 – 2002) and artist Saul Steinberg (1914 – 1999) engaged in a unique collaboration by having friends and acquaintances don paper bags drawn with fantastic faces and then posing them for photographs. In a delightful series of individual and group portraits taken from 1959 to 1963 the images convey both humor and an unnerving psychological depth. We may not know who is beneath each bag, but we seem to know the type they are playing. Between Morath's deadpan style and Steinberg's flights of fantasy they created a veritable encyclopedia of attitudes, postures, and mannerisms.\n\nInge Morath joined the photographic cooperative Magnum in Paris by invitation of Robert Capa in 1953 and was assistant to Henri Cartier-Bresson before becoming a full member. Her work was widely published in magazines, including Life, Paris Match, and Vogue, and in numerous books.\n\nMs. Morath was married to Arthur Miller and they had one daughter, the film director Rebecca Miller.\n\nIn 2015 the Bienecke Library at Yale acquired the bulk of the Inge Morath Estate."
