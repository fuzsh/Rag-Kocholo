        "text": "Photographer Inge Morath is one of the “classics” of press photography. This monograph presents a comprehensive cross-section of her work from the 1950s to the present and includes over 100 of her most important black-and-white photographs Inge Morath was born in Austria and left Vienna in the post-war period together with the photographer Ernst Haas to work for the “Magnum” agency. A varied and intensive activity as a photographer for “Magnum” took her to all parts of the world. She published highly acclaimed books on Spain, Russia, China as well as illustrated books on special topics. Some of these books are collaborations with her husband, the American playwright Arthur Miller, with whom she lives in the USA. For this monograph, on the one hand, her best-known works have been selected, and on the other hand, an extensive selection has been made from her archive, including photographs, some of which have never been published before. The monograph is an example of classic press photography and comprehensively presents the work of the first “State Prize Winner for Photography” in Austria. In the accompanying illustrated book, the photographs are supplemented by a biography by Kurt Kaindl, a text by Inge Morath about the beginning of her collaboration with Magnum, and an art-theoretical text by Margit Zuckriegl.\n\nInge Morath, *1923 in Graz, Austria. †2002 in New York."
