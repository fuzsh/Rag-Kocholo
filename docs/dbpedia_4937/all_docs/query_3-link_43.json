        "text": "Esopus Space is pleased to present “Inge Morath: Bal d'Hiver,” an exhibition of recently discovered images captured over a half-century ago by the renowned photographer Inge Morath. An opening reception for the exhibition, which runs through December 15th, will be held at the gallery on Wednesday, November 2nd, from 6 to 8 pm.\n\n“The Paris social season opened with a big, elegant splash last Tuesday. The Baronne de Gabrol, President of ESSOR, an association for the protection of France’s abandoned children, sponsored the Winter Ball, at which some of the most distinguished names in Europe amused themselves for the benefit of needy children.” So begins Inge Morath’s description of the Bal d’Hiver, a dance on ice performed in 1955 by European royalty, in costumes donated by couturiers including Hubert de Givenchy and Christian Dior, and attended by an international roster of celebrities, from the Countess d’Paris to film star Charles Chaplin. Morath's remarkable photos of the event take the viewer behind the scenes of this one-of-a-kind gathering while exhibiting her extraordinary sense of composition and intensely humanistic approach. Each image perfectly illustrates a comment made by the photographer in 1999: “The personal vision is usually there from the beginning; result of a special chemistry of background and feelings, traditions and their rejection, of sensibility and voyeurism. You trust your eye and you cannot help but bare your soul.”"
