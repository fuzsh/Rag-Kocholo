        "text": "401\n\nSubmission Deadline: April 30th, 2015.\n\nThe Magnum Foundation and the Inge Morath Foundation announce the 14th annual Inge Morath Award. The annual award of $5,000 is given to a female photographer under the age of 30, to support the completion of a long-term documentary project. One award winner and up to two finalists are selected by a jury composed of Magnum photographers and the director of the Inge Morath Foundation.\n\nInge Morath was an Austrian-born photographer who was associated with Magnum Photos for nearly fifty years. After her death in 2002, the Inge Morath Foundation was established to manage Morath’s estate and facilitate the study and appreciation of her contribution to photography. Because Morath devoted much of her enthusiasm to encouraging women photographers, her colleagues at Magnum Photos established the Inge Morath Award in her honor.\n\nThe award is now administered by the Magnum Foundation as part of its mission of supporting the next generation of socially-conscious documentary photographers, in cooperation with the Inge Morath Foundation.\n\nPast winners of the Inge Morath Award include:\n\nShannon Jensen (US, ’14), for A Long Walk;\n\nIsadora Kosofsky (US, ’12), for Selections from “The Three” and “This Existence;”\n\nZhe Chen (China, ’11) for Bees;\n\nLurdes R. Basolí (Spain, ’10) for Caracas, The City of Lost Bullets and Claire Martin (Australia, ’10) for Selections from The Downtown East Side and Slab City;\n\nEmily Schiffer (US, ’09) for Cheyenne River;\n\nKathryn Cook (US, ’08) for Memory Denied: Turkey and the Armenian Genocide\n\n; Olivia Arthur (UK, ’07) for The Middle Distance;\n\nJessica Dimmock (US, ’06) for The Ninth Floor;\n\nMimi Chakarova (US, ’06) for Sex Trafficking in Eastern Europe;\n\nClaudia Guadarrama (MX, ’05) for Before the Limit; and\n\nAmi Vitale (US, ’02), for Kashmir.\n\nImage Specifications:\n\n– Your image submission must include 40 – 60 photographs (1200 pixels on the longest side @ 150 DPI saved as a JPEG compression at 8 minimum).\n\n– Create a folder containing your individual images. Please use numbered filenames indicating the image sequence, with the number coming first in the file name and then last name; for example: 01_Smith, 02_Smith, 03_Smith etc. (use only two digit numbers; 01, 02, 03, etc.).\n\nRequired Support Material:\n\n– Project description. This should describe the project and how the Award will be used to complete work on the project.\n\n– Curriculum Vitae (maximum three pages) including name, email address, telephone number, and mailing address.\n\n– Scan of ID clearly showing date of birth. All applicants must be under the age of 30 on April 30th, 2015 (in other words, if April 30th is your birthday, and you’re turning 30, then you’re no longer eligible to submit a proposal)."
