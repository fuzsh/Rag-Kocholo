        "meta_description": "Danube Revisited – The Inge Morath Truck Project, is a photographic road trip along the Danube and a travelling exhibition of the work of renowned Magnum photographer Inge Morath, inside a converted 7.5T truck. The exhibition of her work from the Danube made its way back along the river, accompanied by eight female photographers who produced new work along the way and promoted the power and potential of photography through night projections, artist talks, photo forums and engaging in cultural exchange with institutions and organizations along the route.  &nbsp;The participating photographers are all recipients of the grant given annually in Morath's name, by the members of Magnum Photo Agency. A core motivation for each of these women is to support the under-represented female voice in documentary photography. As such they have created a project that is for women, by women, and in the legacy of a pioneering woman. &nbsp;As the final result of the Project, Fundación Telefónica produced a touring exhibition that included Inge’s work in the región together with the new photographs created on the Danube Revisited tour. The tour and resulting exhibiton has been described as a “multidimensional phenomena that mark it as one of the most talked about collaborations in photography today.”&nbsp;To learn more about this project please visit the website&nbsp;http://www.danuberevisited.com/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",
