        "text": "Inge Morath grew overwhelmed with panic one day in 1958, as she was on the road to the source of one of Europe’s largest rivers, the Danube.\n\nIt was not about gaining access, although to some, the idea of a young female photojournalist getting visas for six communist states that bordered the river might have seemed daunting. For Morath, the panic was something else.\n\n“How will I photograph this river?” She wrote in “Donau,” a 1995 book about the journey. “In how many ways can one photograph water, and what can such pictures convey?”\n\nBut as she drove farther, she assured herself, “A river has a history written on its banks by generations of people who, in effect, have left us their stories there.”\n\nMorath, who died in 2002, kept the project quiet for years, growing her legacy as a pioneering female photojournalist and the wife and collaborator of the playwright Arthur Miller. It was not until the 1980s that the river resurfaced when Kurt Kaindl, a curator in Salzburg, Austria, working on a monograph with her, kept noticing photographs of the Danube.\n\n“She told me she intended to make a big project about the river, but never made enough work to publish,” Mr. Kaindl said. In exchange for book rights, he and his wife accompanied Morath in the mid-1990s to the Danube so she could complete the project.\n\nThis summer, nine women — all recipients of Magnum’s annual Inge Morath Award — will continue Morath’s journey along the river through “Danube Revisited: The Inge Morath Truck Project,” a photographic road trip and traveling exhibition made possible by a converted 7.5-ton truck.\n\nThe women will use the truck to show Morath’s work, create new photographs, collaborate with locals, give portfolio reviews and receive submissions from new female artists along the way. They will also choose four female photographers to join them on the road.\n\nThe group — which includes Olivia Arthur, who has since joined Magnum — began a Kickstarter campaign, which is close to its $50,000 goal for the project. The Magnum photographer Larry Towell, who helped start the award 12 years ago, is one the supporters of the campaign.\n\n“I’m quite aware of scarcity of women in photojournalism,” Mr. Towell said. “In order to keep a person’s spirit alive you have to create new work.”\n\nThe Inge Morath Foundation has also stepped forward as a sponsor. “The return to the Danube by the inheritors of Morath’s legacy is a return of the gift received by them,” said John Jacob, the foundation’s director.\n\nAmi Vitale was the award’s first recipient in 2002 for her project covering conflict in Kashmir. Ms. Vitale said the award allowed her to complete a crucial final year there.\n\n“Now, it is simply about sharing what we’ve learned,” she said. “Inge Morath’s work goes across generations.”\n\nClaire Martin, another participant in the summer road trip, said the award she won in 2010 started her on a career she once thought was beyond her reach. Encouraged by the Magnum photographer Trent Parke, who taught a workshop in her hometown, Perth, Australia, she took the risk.\n\n“I was surprised when I won,” Ms. Martin said. “Having that validation gave me confidence to put myself out there and to call myself a photographer.”\n\nAnd yet, Inge Morath did not begin as a photographer herself.\n\nBorn in Graz, Austria, in 1923, to scientists, she moved around frequently. Just before the Second World War, the family relocated to Berlin, where she studied linguistics in college. But her refusal to join the student union landed her in a frequently-bombed factory, where she assembled airplane parts.\n\n“You felt she had a real problem with war,” Mr. Kaindl said, adding that she was uneasy with the German language and made a point to learn half a dozen others fluently, including photography, which she viewed as a language.\n\nShe employed her language skills after the war, first as a translator, then as Austrian editor of an American magazine for which she wrote articles to accompany photographs by Ernst Haas. She collaborated with Haas on a story, which she thought “nobody would like at all,” about Austrian prisoners of war arriving from Russia.\n\nBut the editor was so pleased that he sent copies to Robert Capa, who two years prior had created Magnum. Capa immediately invited both Haas and Morath to Paris, where Haas became a photographer and Morath an editor. Her duties involved writing captions, performing research, essentially doing everything but taking photographs.\n\nAll of that changed in 1951, when she moved to London because of a brief marriage to the journalist Lionel Birch. “Now that I was no longer accompanied by photographers, the world around me seemed to be filled with things that wanted to be photographed,” Morath wrote.\n\nShe bought a used Leica and took up an apprenticeship with Simon Guttmann, who was an adviser to Picture Post. Still, she was cautious, maybe a little shy, about her incipient career. She changed her credit to Egni Tharom — her name backward — and started selling photos to magazines. Her confidence grew and soon she was back in Paris, divorced, but with a new calling.\n\nIn 1953, she moved in with activist Catholic priests who worked with people living in poor conditions. She showed the photographs to Capa without revealing herself as the photographer. When he liked the images, she told him her secret. Capa admitted her into Magnum as the only other woman besides Eve Arnold. She traveled all over Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nIn 1956, she went to Iran, where she admitted it was hard for a woman to work. But she had prepared well for the journey.\n\n“I belong to the school of photographers who like to prepare themselves thoroughly for a trip to a new country,” she wrote. “Before I start a project, I like to look into its background, to immerse myself in the culture involved, to learn at least the basics of its language.”\n\nMorath met Arthur Miller in 1960 on the set of “The Misfits,” a film with Marilyn Monroe, which she was photographing for Magnum. Two years later, the two married and had their first child.\n\n“When I was born, my mother abandoned her career as a traveling photojournalist who takes jobs from magazines and leaves for parts unknown at a moment’s notice,” Rebecca Miller said. “She narrowed her focus to the life around her, her own family, the artists and intellectuals who lived in Connecticut.”\n\nThe result was a book called “In the Country.”\n\nOnce Rebecca was on her own, the Miller-Morath team traveled the world and made books, like “Chinese Encounters,” for which Morath practiced her Mandarin extensively.\n\n“Somehow I think language was, to her, the key to being able to make people trust her, to getting more intimate images,” Ms. Miller said.\n\nSusan Meiselas, who knew Ms. Morath and has been a member of Magnum since 1976, remembers her as “a spry, energetic, engaging person whom you could find the sparkle of life both in herself and in the images she made.”\n\nLike those of the Danube. The river has gone through many changes since Morath’s first visit — from the fall of the Iron Curtain to the unrest in Ukraine. But a certain spirit continues.\n\n“I love that this young group has chosen to relive and reinvigorate and re-examine and reimagine this work,” Ms. Meiselas said. “That is what a legacy is all about.”"
