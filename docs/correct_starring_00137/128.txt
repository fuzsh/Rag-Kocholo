Ed Wood (film) Edward D. Wood, Jr., an eccentric actor/writer/director, has only one thing going for him—an optimistic spirit that remains indomitable despite his obviously misguided career choices. Wood tries to make it in Hollywood, but earns the reputation of the “worst director of all time.” He has a fetish for wearing women’s clothes, and he gathers around him a bizarre band of characters, including the down-and-out screen legend Bela Lugosi, television horror queen Vampira, hulking Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson, psychic Criswell, and highbrow transvestite Bunny Breckinridge. Wood creates ineptly made, off-beat, low-budget independent films that somehow turn out to be cultish classics and turn their director into a legend. Limited release in Los Angeles and New York on September 28, 1994; general release on October 7, 1994. Directed by Tim Burton. A Touchstone film.
