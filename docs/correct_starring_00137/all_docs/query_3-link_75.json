        "text": "Top image: Coffee and Cigarettes (2003) dir. Jim Jarmusch\n\nJim Jarmusch has revealed details of his upcoming zombie movie titled The Dead Don’t Die, including an all-star cast.\n\nSet for release 14th June, the film was written and directed by Jarmusch and sees the US auteur catch up with previous collaborators Iggy Pop, RZA, Tom Waits, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Adam Driver and Steve Buscemi alongside new faces including Chloë Sevigny, Danny Glover, Caleb Landry Jones, Rosie Perez, Sara Driver, Selena Gomez.\n\nWhile plot details are yet to be disclosed, on-set photos show Murray, Driver and Sevigny as police officers. The Dead Don’t Die follows Jarmusch’s acclaimed 2016 documentary on the Stooges, Gimme Danger.\n\nExciting news and a good excuse to rewatch Jarmusch’s oeuvre. We suggest starting with Mystery Train."
