        "text": "Wes Anderson has recruited his next star-studded cast for a new movie led by Bill Murray, Michael Cera, and Benicio del Toro, reports Deadline.\n\nAnderson co-wrote the film with his frequent collaborator Roman Coppola (The Darjeeling Limited, Moonrise Kingdom). Details are officially being kept under wraps, but it’s set to go into production this year.\n\nLast June, Anderson gave insight into the movie during an interview with Le Monde. “My next feature film will be linear, with Benicio Del Toro in every shot,” he said. “I can’t tell you much more than that except that it will be about espionage, a father-daughter relationship, and, let’s say, with a rather dark tone.”\n\nRelated Video\n\nRecent reports have also said the plot revolves around “three key characters,” with other Anderson regulars playing smaller roles.\n\nWhile the currently untitled movie will mark Cera’s first time working with Anderson, Murray and del Toro have previously worked with the filmmaker. Murray’s history with Anderson dates back to 1998’s Rushmore, while del Toro appeared in 2021’s The French Dispatch.\n\n2023 was a packed year for Anderson, who is coming off the feature Asteroid City and the Netflix shorts The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, Poison, The Rat Catcher, and The Swan."
