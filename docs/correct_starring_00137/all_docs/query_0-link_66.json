        "text": "U.S., 1994\n\nDirected by Tim Burton\n\nStarring Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker\n\nScreenplay by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski\n\nDCP. Approx 127 min.\n\nAlways upbeat, uncompromising 1950s auteur Edward D. Wood Jr. struggles against a misunderstanding world to realize his unique artistic vision—only trouble is, he’s Johnny Depp as Ed Wood (once described as “the worst director of all time,” but the verdict is still out), and his visions are the way-before-its-time cross-dressing drama Glen or Glenda? and the no-budget Bride of the Atom (later re-titled Bridge of the Monster) and immortal Plan 9 from Outer Space. Academy Awards to Martin Landau’s both hilarious and heartrending portrayal of washed-up drug addicted screen icon Bela Lugosi and Rick Baker’s make-up for everyone from Lugosi to TV ghoul Vampira. Featuring Bill Murray, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rosanna Arquette, and Jeffrey Jones. Screenplay by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski.\n\nReviews"
