        "text": "For Missouri State University graduate Ted Melfi, persistence paid off when it came to persuading comedy and acting legend Bill Murrary to star in Melfi's film, \"St. Vincent.\"\n\nIt took repeated calls to the actor's (who is known for not having a cellphone) 1-800 number and a \"nice letter\" to get Murray to join the cast.\n\n\"That's always a good sign when someone can write a letter. I asked him if he can meet me at the airport, we could go for a ride,\" Murray told USA TODAY.\n\nMelfi and Murray met at Los Angeles International Airport and went to an In-N-Out Burger for grub. After a couple hours talking about the script, Murray was on board to play the lead role of Vincent.\n\n\"He is the most free, spontaneous wild creature you could ever imagine,\" Melfi said of Murray. \"He is kind of like a lone wolf. He doesn't like the Hollywood style. He doesn't like to be tied down. He wants to be free.\"\n\nMelfi wrote and directed the film, which will be in Springfield theaters today and also stars Melissa McCarthy and Naomi Watts. Melfi said McCarthy fans might be surprised at her dramatic acting in this film — very different than her typical comedic roles.\n\n\"To me, it's a drama with some funny moments,\" Melfi said. \"It's a dramady.\"\n\n\"St. Vincent\" is the story of a young boy named Oliver (played by Jaeden Lieberher) whose parents are divorced and finds an unlikely friend and mentor in his neighbor.\n\nThat neighbor, Vincent, is a \"curmudgeon Vietnam War veteran who drinks too much, smokes too much and gambles too much and doesn't have much cause to live anymore,\" Melfi explained.\n\n\"He becomes the kid's nanny. The kid teaches the old guy he has value, and the old guy teaches the young kid everything he needs to know about life,\" Melfi said.\n\nMelfi is originally from New York but graduated from high school in Conway.\n\nHe graduated from Missouri State University in 1994.\n\nOver the years, Melfi has returned to Springfield to cast and film projects including \"Larva\" for the Sci-Fi Channel, \"Winding Roads\" for the Lifetime channel, and \"Park Day\" which is available on video.\n\n\"St. Vincent\" is Melfi's first film to be shown in theaters on a national level.\n\nThe character Vincent, played by Murray, was inspired by Melfi's father-in-law, a Vietnam vet with a drinking problem.\n\n\"He abandoned all his kids and quit talking to my wife when she was 9,\" Melfi said of his father-in-law. \"Twenty-five years later, she goes to one of those weekend seminars — a find-your-life seminar — and she gets an assignment to make amends with all the people in her life.\"\n\nMelfi's wife found an address in the phone book for someone in Massachusetts with her father's name and wrote a letter.\n\n\"Two weeks later the phone rings and it was her dad,\" he said. \"They became best friends for the last 10 years of his life. He became a saint for her. That is the character of Vincent, who learns his value through someone else later in life and gets a second chance.\"\n\nThe story and title were also inspired by Melfi's relationship with his niece. Melfi adopted her when she was 11 and her father — Melfi's brother — had died.\n\nMelfi and his wife took his niece from Tennessee to Los Angeles where she enrolled in a Catholic high school.\n\nThere, she was given an assignment to choose a Catholic saint that inspires her and draw a comparison to someone in her life.\n\n\"And she picks Saint William of Rochester, the patron saint of adopted children. And she picked me,\" Melfi said.\n\n\"That is the entire story of 'St. Vincent.' That is what happens in the movie — without giving too much away.\""
