        "text": "Ed Wood Movie Poster\n\n“Because of his eccentric habits and bafflingly strange films, director Edward D. Wood Jr. is a Hollywood outcast. Nevertheless, with the help of the formerly famous Bela Lugosi and a devoted cast and crew of show-business misfits who believe in Ed’s off-kilter vision, the filmmaker is able to bring his oversize dreams to cinematic life. Despite a lack of critical or commercial success, Ed and his friends manage to create an oddly endearing series of extremely low-budget films.”\n\nIt’s appropriate that Tim Burton would direct this and even more appropriate that Johnny Depp would play the lead character as this story profiles an unusual subject: the worst director of films, perhaps, in Hollywood history….and one of its strangest characters.\n\nAs interesting as the story is, I found the black-and-white photography to be the best aspect of the film, but that’s no surprise since Burton usually excels in making great visual films. Depp was hilarious as “Ed Wood“. The eternal optimistic attitude and silly smile on his face in this film always makes me laugh and actually is inspiring in parts. You can’t help but like poor Ed.\n\nThe most dramatic figure is Bela Lugosi, played memorably by Martin Landau, who deservedly won many awards for this performance. What a tragic figure.\n\nTo no surprise, there is a cheap shot against Baptists, who are made to look like meddling fools, something Hollywood loves to portray when it comes to any Christian character. Other than that, it’s a fascinating film and portrait of a weirdo that only real-life weirdo Johnny Depp could do justice.\n\nVintage Movie Posters Grading Criteria\n\nMint\n\nA poster that has never been used or displayed and may show the most minor signs of age and wear.

This is the highest grade allowed for a poster that has been restored either on linen or on paper.\n\nFine\n\nA poster with good colors and overall clean appearance.

May have staining, cracking, dry rot, and/or large tears. May be heavily soiled, may have pieces missing. In need of major restoration.\n\nAll photographs and images used on our site are photographs of the actual poster/item you are buying, we do not use stock photographs.\n\nMost Popular Poster Types\n\nUS Posters\n\nLOBBY CARD\n\n11 x 14″ printed on heavy stock paper. Used as display in theatre lobbies. Originally made in sets of eight. Some sets have a title card, which contains credits and artwork, essentially a mini-poster. The remaining seven cards are coloured photographic credits and poster artwork showing different scenes from the movie.\n\nWINDOW CARD\n\n14 x 22″ printed on heavy stock paper with the top 4-6 inches usually left blank for the local cinema owner to fill in the cinema and the date it was due to play. Largely discontinued during the 1970’s.\n\nHALF SHEET\n\n22 x 28″ printed on heavy stock paper. The image displayed is normally a smaller version of the main poster, although some do have different artworks and sometimes come in two versions.\n\nINSERT\n\n14 x 36″ printed on heavy stock paper. Inserts usually have the same artwork as a one sheet. Popular with collectors since they are smaller and easier to frame. Normally come tri folded or rolled.\n\nSTYLE Y/FORTY BY SIXTY\n\n40 x 60″ printed on heavy stock paper. Rare since they were primarily used for major motion pictures only. Designed to be used outside the theatre, on an easel, normally at a drive-in movie theatre.\n\nONE-SHEET\n\n27 x 41″ printed on paper. This is the most common size of poster, intended to be displayed in a glass “marquee” case. It is the most sought after size by collectors. Since the 1980’s most posters are sent to the theatre rolled and maybe slightly smaller measuring 27″ by 40″ and with the advent of backlit light boxes a growing number of modern movie posters are available double-sided and the more traditional single-sided.\n\nTHREE-SHEET\n\n41 x 81″ printed on paper. These were printed on two or three separate sheets designed to overlap, few survive. Used for larger advertising spaces, normally posted on walls, perfect for huge movie theatres the drive-in, where people could see them from a distance. From the 1970’s on, three-sheets were sometimes printed in one piece and issued as “international” versions to be used abroad.\n\nBRITISH Posters\n\nBRITISH QUAD\n\n30 x 40″ Most common poster size used in the UK. British Quads are horizontal and may have different artwork to the US one sheet. Like a US one sheet they normally come in two versions. Like a US one sheet they are usually supplied single-sided or more commonly now as a double sided poster.\n\nBRITISH ONE-SHEET\n\n27 X 40″, printed on paper. Very rarely used size.\n\nITALIAN Posters\n\nITALIAN LOCANDINA\n\n13 x 28″ six inches shorter than the US insert, very nice size to frame. Italian poster illustrators are some of the best in the industry.\n\nITALIAN PHOTOBUSTA\n\n18 x 26″ Glossy, high quality, used as lobby cards in Italy. Size may vary, either vertical or horizontal format. There are also double Photobusta or mini Photobusta.\n\n2-FOGLIO (DUE)\n\n(DUE): 39 x 55″ This is the standard poster size used in Italy. Italian poster illustrators are some of the best in the industry.\n\n4-FOGLIO\n\n(QUATTRO) 55 x 79″ Very large Italian poster printed in two pieces, often contains very beautiful artwork.\n\nFRENCH Posters\n\nFRENCH\n\n47 x 63″ (GRANDE) or 24 x 33″ (PETITE) French movie posters normally come with different artwork to either the US or the UK. Like the Italian’s some of the artwork is extrememly beautiful."
