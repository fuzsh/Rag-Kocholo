        "text": "“A glorious homage to the power of film in general and one of Burton’s finest moments.” – Empire Magazine\n\nThe great American-Jewish actor Martin Landau, who passed this July, deservedly won an Oscar for his role as the Dracula star Bela Lugosi in this modern classic. Charting the bond formed between Lugosi and the man who has come to be known as the worst film director of all time, Ed Wood is a magnificent tribute to some of the best bad movies Hollywood ever produced and the overlooked talent who made them."
