        "text": "‘St. Vincent’ director on working with Bill Murray\n\nFor his first theatrical feature, Thomas Melfi wound up with a cast that includes Melissa McCarthy, Naomi Watts and the great Bill Murray.\n\nMurray plays a cranky old drunk who baby-sits Oliver, the12-year-old son of McCarthy’s character while she works in a hospital; Watts plays a pregnant Russian stripper. (Yes.) It’s an auspicious debut, one that Melfi talked about recently.\n\nQuestion: Where did you come up with the idea?\n\nA: Essentially, the movie’s a true story. Eight years ago my oldest brother passed away, and he was 38. He left behind a daughter, an 11-year-old girl, and the mother was not in the picture. So my wife and I adopted her, and we moved her from Tennessee to Van Nuys, Calif., and we put her in a Catholic school. ... Her sophomore year, in her world-religion class, she gets a homework assignment: Find a Catholic saint that inspires you. And find someone in your everyday life that mimics the qualities of that saint, and draw a comparison. She picked St. William of Rochester, the patron saint of adopted children, and she picked me. And that’s the entire movie. You could say based on a true story, really, in the movie, but I don’t. I took a lot of liberties.\n\nQ: Well, there’s Vincent, too.\n\nA: The second true story is Vince, the character, is 100 percent my father-in-law, my wife’s father. Bastard of a guy, Vietnam vet, alcoholic, abandoned all five of his kids, left my wife when she was 9, never talked to her again.\n\nTwenty-five years later, my wife goes to one of those find-your-life seminars in Los Angeles, gets an assignment, get complete with the people in your life and make amends with them. And she writes a Dear Dad letter and mails it to an address she finds in the White Pages in East Longmeadow, Mass. Two weeks later the phone rings: “Kim, it’s your dad,” and she starts crying.\n\nAnd they became each other’s saints for the last 10 years of his life. He changed 100 percent. He was there for her. They talked every night on the phone, and to watch that relationship blossom was like the greatest gift she ever had. So these two stories are blended together to make “St. Vincent.”\n\nQ: Pregnant Russian strippers?\n\nA: Yeah. That’s not true. (Laughs.)\n\nQ: Can we assume that, unlike Vincent, you didn’t take your niece to the horse track?\n\nA: No, I haven’t taken her to the track. But she’s been in a bar. My wife grew up in bars. So my wife is a little bit of Oliver, too.\n\nQ: The process of getting Murray is legendary. He doesn’t have an agent. It starts with a phone call, right?\n\nA: That’s it. There’s a 1-800 number and you call it, and you wait. And you call it and call it and call it. I must have called it I don’t know how many dozens of times. You just call and you wait.\n\nQ: Were you working on a Plan B, in case he never called back?\n\nA: I wasn’t. I wasn’t because I’m delusional. My wife says I have happy delusions. I’m delusional that way. I just say, this is how it’s got to be and it’s got to be. I don’t take no. I just don’t like no. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. That’s just how I am. I wasn’t going to stop till I got him to say something.\n\nQ: It’s a pretty impressive cast for your first feature. Were you intimidated?\n\nA: To be perfectly honest with you, there’s no time to have an emotion like that. If you do, you’re done, because it happens so fast and so quick and you have to be so sharp and so on it every moment of the day. ... I didn’t have a lot of time to have self-doubt. And I say thank god about it, because if I did, I don’t know if I’d be here.\n\nQ: Was it a smooth production?\n\nA: It was particularly smooth in the sense that everyone really liked each other, so all the actors really jelled right away. The crew was really sharp and some of these people I had done commercials with over the years, so I came with a sense of a team. ... When we got there, it was just kind of executing. But, in general, because of Bill and his personality, it was a very loose and fun set. So we kind of enjoyed our days.\n\nQ: You wrote and directed. Was there an inclination to change the script while shooting?\n\nA: No. At some point you have to kick the writer off the set because it’s not helpful. He can’t be there. He can’t be there, because then the movie becomes about the words, and once the camera is there, it’s no longer about the words.\n\nQ: Ha. Do you get to see the writer when you go home?"
