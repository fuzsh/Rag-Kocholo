        "text": "1998’s Rushmore is the first of many collaborations between Wes Anderson and Bill Murray, beginning a long and fruitful artistic relationship that continues to thrive to this day. In the years since, Murray has appeared in 10 of Anderson’s 11 films, including every outing the filmmaker has delivered except his debut, 1996’s Bottle Rocket.\n\nThough the pair have become an inseparable force in the pop culture zeitgeist, there was a time when it shocked audiences to see Bill Murray taking on serious roles in Wes Anderson’s growing catalog.\n\nMurray had previously made a name for himself by leaning on his endlessly sarcastic performances and acerbic wit, delivering a sort of live-action Bugs Bunny routine in many of his roles.\n\nIf he had played his cards close to his chest, he could have reveled in silly roles for the remainder of his career, and never reached the artistic heights he desired. Once Murray collaborated with Wes Anderson, he began to display an incredible range, proving to audiences that he was capable of a wide array of talent.\n\nRushmore was the first outing that delivered on this promise, seeing Bill Murray as a resigned businessman suffering from existential dread, while still holding out hope that things could get better. Murray’s portrayal against Jason Schwartzman’s up-and-coming student provided a surprising amount of depth, likely resulting from Murray’s kinship to the character.\n\nAs the story goes, Bill Murray fell in love with the writing of the script so much that he volunteered to do the film for the lowest union-approved salary of $9,000.\n\nBill Murray chose to take on the staggering pay cut because he believed in the film, and the filmmaker, and insisted that the film’s budget could be better used elsewhere. This level of selfless artistry seemed incredibly out-of-character for fans of Murray’s work prior to 1998, as he so often portrayed selfish and unaffected characters in his films. When the film eventually premiered, Murray’s performance was hailed as a career high, and still holds a place in the hearts and minds of many fans to this day.\n\nThe actor’s future collaborations with Wes Anderson would see him taking on a host of complicated characters across a wide spectrum of empathy. Like many acclaimed directors, Wes Anderson is known to work with a cast of recurring favorites, with Bill Murray taking arguably the lead spot on his list. This may all have never been possible if it weren’t for Bill Murray’s deep devotion to Rushmore, and the character of Herman J. Blume."
