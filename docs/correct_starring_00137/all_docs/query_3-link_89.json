        "text": "Bill Murray is an American actor, comedian, and writer who has become a cultural icon throughout his long and varied career. Born in Evanston, Illinois, in 1950, Murray began his career as a cast member on the sketch comedy show ‘Saturday Night Live’ in the late 1970s.\n\nMurray’s early film roles included projects such as ‘Meatballs’ (1979) and ‘Caddyshack’ (1980), but it was his performance in the 1984 comedy classic ‘Ghostbusters’ that solidified his status as a bonafide movie star. The actor went on to appear in a string of popular films throughout the 1980s and ’90s, including ‘Groundhog Day’ (1993), ‘Rushmore’ (1998), and ‘Lost in Translation’ (2003), a collaboration with Sofia Coppola that remains one of his most loved performances.\n\nMurray is known for his distinctive acting style, which combines deadpan humour with a charming and likeable demeanour. He has won acclaim for his work in both comedic and dramatic roles and has been nominated for numerous awards throughout his career, including an Academy Award for ‘Best Acto’r for his role in ‘Lost in Translation’.\n\nIn addition to his acting work, Murray is also a successful writer and producer. He has contributed to the screenplays of several of his films, including ‘Groundhog Day’ and ‘The Royal Tenenbaums’, and has produced and directed several projects as well.\n\nMurray, of course, is also known for his off-screen antics and larger-than-life personality. A keen lover of sports, especially golf, the actor has been involved in numerous charity events and celebrity tournaments. He has also been known to crash parties and events and is famously difficult to contact or schedule for appearances.\n\nBill Murray remains a beloved figure in popular culture whose talent and charisma have made him one of the most recognisable actors of his generation. His ability to transition seamlessly between comedic and dramatic roles, as well as his reputation for being a bit unpredictable, have made him a unique and enduring presence in the entertainment industry."
