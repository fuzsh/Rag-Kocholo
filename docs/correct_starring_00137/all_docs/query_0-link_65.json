        "text": "What a week it has been! The University of Connecticut was able to celebrate back-to-back national championship wins for the men’s basketball team. We are fortunate to have witnessed some great basketball these past few years, and it is special for the senior class to be a part of these years as our university has gained so much recognition. While some argued that the celebrations were anticlimactic, some students found a way to break a window at the recreation center. At least no couches were lit on fire. As always, here are some of my media recommendations for this week. Maybe they will help you ease off the high of our win.\n\nThe Movie: “Ed Wood”\n\nNothing beats a Johnny Depp-Tim Burton collaboration — especially in the 90s. Following the iconic film “Edward Scissorhands” in 1990, Depp and Burton teamed up to create “Ed Wood” in 1994 — the duo’s second project together.\n\nBased on a true story, the film shows the career of Hollywood film director Ed Wood played by none other than Johnny Depp. The story follows Wood’s career of directing mediocre films in the 1950s that went on to become cult classics years later. Wood is able to direct bombs with the help of legend Bela Lugosi, who is brilliantly portrayed by Martin Landau in an Oscar-nominated performance. Regardless of the film’s success, Wood and his team of Hollywood outcasts can do them with a low budget.\n\n“Ed Wood” also stars powerhouse actors Sarah Jessica Parker as Woods’ wife, Dolores Fuller, and Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge.\n\nBy coincidence, I was able to see the back of Bill Murray’s head as he appeared at the championship rally on Tuesday night to support our national champions and his son, assistant coach Luke Murray.\n\nThe message of “Ed Wood” speaks to loving what you do regardless of the outcome, even if no one believes in you. If you have a story you want to tell, staying true to yourself and being authentic and authoritative — respectfully — will get you to where you want to be. It is also refreshing to see Depp take on a more grounded role of a real person while also showing the audience the more eccentric side of the characters we are so used to seeing. It is rare to see Depp take on these characters that are not so whimsical, but his performances are just as captivating when playing more straight characters, like his performance as Donnie in the 1997 film “Donnie Brasco” or James ‘Whitey’ Bulger in the 2015 film “Black Mass.” Shot in black and white, Burton portrayed Ed Wood not as making fun but as showing his process of filmmaking and his life.\n\nThe Show: “Kill Tony”\n\nThink of it as an R-rated “America’s Got Talent” but strictly for comedy — the number one live podcast “Kill Tony” takes a no-holds-bar approach to seek out the new and upcoming talent in the stand-up comedy world. The host, Tony Hinchcliffe, pulls random names from a bucket that includes people who have never performed comedy before or have just started their stand-up journey. The participants have just one minute to perform their material and either get laughs from the crowd or complete silence and sometimes booed off the stage. After the set is over, the panel of guests interviews the comic to find out interesting things about their lives, which adds to the humor and brilliance of the show. You never know who might be a part of the esteemed panel. Whether it is other accomplished comedians or WWE legend Ric Flair, Post Malone or even Tucker Carlson, people who have never performed stand-up and still enjoy the craft and the show. “Kill Tony” is taking over the live show genre and deserves to get more mainstream recognition as the show continues to sell out theaters and arenas around the world. Available on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts, “Kill Tony” is one of a kind.\n\nThe Album: “Songs in the Key of Life”\n\nWalking through campus during these gloomy, rainy days, I find myself searching for music in R&B to accompany the soft, low-energy sounds and feelings of the day. Having been a fan of Stevie Wonder, I clicked shuffle on his 1976 album “Songs in the Key of Life.” Being one of Wonder’s longest collections of songs, the two-LP set is a wide arrangement featuring some of Wonder’s best work. The opening track, “Love’s In Need of Love Today,” might sound familiar to fans of JAY-Z and his “4:44” album as he samples Wonder’s opening track on the song “Smile.” Wonder kicks off the beginning of the track with the explosive “Village Ghetto Land.” Then, Wonder delivers one of his most iconic tracks, “Sir Duke,” which is a song that no one can not tap their foot along to. The album is filled with more hits like “Isn’t She Lovely” and covers topics from love and relationships to social issues and spirituality.\n\nComing towards the end of the semester, it might be beneficial to show up to that lecture you have never been to or reach out to the professor about catching up on a semester saving assignment that was due in February.\n\nSee you next weekend."
