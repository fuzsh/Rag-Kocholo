        "text": "This film is also known as \"I Changed My Sex\", among possibly other titles. Ed starred in the movie himself, which he didn't usually do, under the name of \"Daniel Davis\"- Davis was his middle name, I don't know where he got the \"Daniel\" from- as, obviously, Glen... and Glenda. Also in the film is his then girlfriend Dolores Fuller and none other than Bela Lugosi, who would work with Ed again later. Hollywood had finished with Lugosi, and he was in need of the money which Ed paid him. The two became friends.\n\nAs was his habit, Ed used large amounts of stock footage but perhaps this time more than any other. The film had a limited release then re-releases under other titles, and made next to no money.\n\nA re-release (again) in the early 80s featured extra footage, previously unseen. It was restored and colourized in 2009 for DVD release.\n\nThis film is widely regarded as the most autobiographical of Ed's movies. \"Glen\" had much in common with Ed himself which isn't too surprising since he wrote the script.\n\nQuite frankly, I found the film almost impossible to sit through since it lacks the elements usually found entertaining in \"Bride\", \"Plan 9\" or \"Ghouls\". It is a bad movie- not so bad it's good, like those three. The only reason to watch it is to see Lugosi. Some of it is almost competently done, to damn with faint praise.\n\nNow we reach a more typical Ed Wood film….\n\n“Bride Of The Monster” (aka “Bride Of The Atom”) stars Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist!\n\nTor Johnson as his hulking, silent (well, almost) henchman!\n\nAnd a rubber octopus!\n\nMade in 1955 ('ish- accounts vary) on a budget of approximately $2.49, the local police are dealing fairly ineptly with a series of disappearances happening near a spooky old house. It takes a while (I think it’s 12 disappearances) but eventually suspicion forms around the scientist who owns the house and his huge silent assistant. The plot is creaky, but no worse than some Lugosi had starred in during the 1930s and 40s.\n\nThe dialogue stinks, on the whole, but there are one or two atmospheric speeches delivered well by Lugosi. This is probably the best-\n\n(67) Bela Lugosi in Home, I have no home.avi - YouTube\n\nThe story goes that Ed wanted to have cue cards set up for Bela to read, but the ageing star- even now, still proud of his stage background- refused them and did the speech, part of which he had written himself, purely from memory.\n\nFor comparison, here's Martin Landau in his Oscar-winning role as Lugosi in Tim Burton's \"Ed Wood\"-\n\n(67) Ed Wood No Home Scene - YouTube\n\nMuch more interesting than the film itself are the stories behind it. One Loretta King promised Ed some money to shoot the movie (stories differ as to how much she offered, how much she actually had, and whether she deliberately deceived Ed or he just misunderstood her) so Ed started shooting and gave her the female lead, much to the anger of his girlfriend Dolores Fuller who had been promised the part and who wouldn’t be Ed’s girlfriend for much longer. This may have been the final straw in their relationship- she had tolerated his wearing her clothes and his drinking, but she had had enough (as usual, stories differ as to exactly when she left him) and went off to write songs for Elvis. No, really. Here’s one which was a hit-\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZjJgLoihG3c\n\nWhen Loretta’s money quickly ran out, Ed tried various backers and ended up with a meatpacker millionaire named Donald McCoy, who insisted on his son Tony being given the lead. He plays a police officer and isn’t as terrible as some, er, most of the others (hello, Loretta King). He also insisted on an atomic explosion at the end. This made no sense, but that of course didn’t prevent Ed from doing exactly that.\n\nThe sets are awful and very wobbly- they don’t need a man Tor Johnson’s size thumping into them to wobble. There is a lot of stock footage which matches with the main body of the film in no way whatsoever.\n\nAnd of course, there’s a rubber octopus. Sadly contrary to myth (and to Tim Burton’s film), Bela himself apparently did not get into a shallow pool of water, fortified by some handy alcohol, to pretend to fight with the octopus. That would be a stuntman- the well over 70 Bela just did the close-ups.\n\nOk, enough from me, at least for the moment. Any thoughts?\n\nAfter “Bride”, Ed was intending to shoot “The Ghoul Goes West”, starring Bela Lugosi. After only a few silent minutes of Lugosi at a funeral then posing round a graveyard in his Dracula gear\n\nplus some shots of him at Tor Johnson’s house\n\npoor Bela passed away at the age of 73. He was buried at his own or his family’s request (accounts differ) in his Dracula cape- or one of them, anyway, since he’d been playing the part on stage and film for some 30 years by this point and worn out a few capes. There is no truth to the rumour that at the funeral Peter Lorre whispered to Boris Karloff “Should we stake him, just to be sure?” since neither were present.\n\nAlso there’s no truth to the only mourners being Ed Wood and his circle, as seen in the Tim Burton film “Ed Wood”.\n\nEd was left with a very few silent shots of Bela and no film. This of course didn’t stop him from making a film anyway….\n\nPLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE\n\nThis film had a very small budget courtesy of local Baptist ministers. The biggest star had died before production; a TV horror hostess only agreed to take part if she had no lines; the sets varied from unconvincing to worthy of a primary school play; some of the cast were downright amateurs; the special effects were laughable.\n\nA director with talent and determination could have made something out of such limitations (eg \"Targets\" a 1968 film directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starring Boris Karloff), but Ed Wood only had determination.\n\nThe Cast:\n\nAs stated, Bela Lugosi had died before this film had begun. Ed used a double, and I use the word loosely, to complete his scenes. This was a man called Tom Mason, who was a chiropractor many years younger and a lot taller than Bela. Ed instructed him to keep his cape over his face in all his scenes.\n\nThe result was…. unconvincing.\n\nVampira was a TV hostess of horror films, who had had some very small parts in movies. When her show was cancelled (it was revived many years later) she was ….perhaps “happy” is too strong a word… to take Ed’s offer provided she didn’t have to speak any lines. This is her story; it’s possible that since she was playing a zombie-like character she didn’t have any lines in the first place.\n\nTor Johnson was a huge wrestler who had begun acting in small parts as a tough guy, wrestler, etc, many years before meeting Ed Wood. His strong Swedish accent made him a poor choice to speak lines, but of course Ed didn’t worry about that.\n\nCriswell was a… clairvoyant? Fortune teller? His many wildly inaccurate prophecies had brought him fame on radio and TV.\n\nPaul Marco plays Officer Kelton, as he had done in “Bride Of The Monster” and would again in “Night Of The Ghouls”.\n\nEd himself has a cameo as a man who, on seeing the flying saucers, drops his bottle of booze.\n\nThe Plot:\n\nBriefly- aliens resurrect the dead (well, 3 of them, anyway) as part of their Plan 9. We’re never told what Plans 1-8 were. They intend to stop humans from making a “Solarnite” bomb.\n\nSometimes they want to make contact, sometimes they want to avoid it.\n\nStrange events at a graveyard bring in the local police. A pilot who saw a flying saucer (not just any flying saucer, a cigar-shaped one) is also involved.\n\nThere’s more, but it’s as pointless as trying to summarize the 1967 “Casino Royale”.\n\nThe Sets and “Special” Effects:\n\nOh boy, where to begin? The plane cockpit seen early in the film.\n\nThe gravestones that wobble and fall over.\n\nThe flying saucers. On fishing lines.\n\nThe crypt with an unfeasible number of people inside.\n\nThe large amount of stock footage, matching poorly with the rest of the film.\n\nThe shadow of the boom mike in the cockpit scene. This wasn’t entirely Ed’s fault- he had shot the scene anticipating a different screen ratio.\n\nThe Acting:\n\nThe best acting in the film comes from Bela Lugosi. And he’s dead.\n\nTor Johnson is almost unintelligible as Inspector Clay. Fortunately he doesn’t have too many lines before he dies and is resurrected.\n\nDuke Moore is the cop who scratches his head with his presumably loaded revolver. And points it to give orders. Straight at people. He’ll be back in “Night Of The Ghouls”, as a different police officer (though it might as well have been the same one).\n\nDudley Manlove plays Eros, an alien, ridiculously. “You see? Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!” Although to be fair Ed’s script doesn’t help him much.\n\nMona McKinnon is very wooden in the main female part. Gregory Walcott is a bit better as her husband, the pilot.\n\nJohn Breckinridge (known as “Bunny”) as the Ruler is fey and uninterested, reading his lines from papers and convenient gadgets. Bill Murray is wonderful as him in “Ed Wood”.\n\nCriswell’s narration is mannered and off-putting.\n\nThe Direction\n\nEd doesn’t bother too much about matching up day and night shots. Or fitting stock footage in with the rest of his film. Or changing angles, shots, etc- once he’s got the camera set for a scene, it almost always stays there without cutaways to, eg, close ups. Or pacing. Or… you get the idea.\n\nSo, is it the worst film ever as it has the reputation of being? No, of course not- it isn't even the worst Ed Wood film ever. But enough from me, anyone like to chip in?\n\nEdit- in picking the above photos, I had to be careful not to pick scenes and actors from Tim Burton's \"Ed Wood\" since that film reproduced \"Plan 9\" meticulously. I'm not sure if one or two may have crept in, nonetheless!\n\nOne of Ed’s least known non-porn films is “Night Of The Ghouls”. This forms, arguably, the third part of a trilogy with “Bride Of The Monster” and “Plan 9 From Outer Space”- we’ll get on to why under “Continuity”.\n\nAlthough shot not long after “Plan 9” (around 1959) it wasn’t released for many, many years simply because Ed was (surprise, surprise) unable to pay the lab fees. It sat until 1984 when someone paid the fees and released it on home video.\n\nPlot:\n\nFake medium Dr Acula (yes, you read that right) takes money from rich gullible subjects and gives them a view of their deceased beloveds (actually lookalikes) and some truly unbelievable “ghosts”. In his service is Tor Johnson’s Lobo who survived the explosion at the end of “Bride”, although heavily scarred.\n\nThe local police (including Duke Moore, who had been in “Plan 9” but is playing a different character here for no discernible reason) are alerted by deaths near the apparently unharmed house we saw blow up at the end of “Bride”. Moore is assisted by Paul Marco’s Officer Kelton, who had been in “Bride” and “Plan 9”.\n\nThe seances held by Dr Acula are absolutely priceless in their hilarity.\n\nThe film is introduced and narrated, as with “Plan 9”, by Criswell who turns up in an actual part at the end which I won’t spoil.\n\nCast:\n\nDr Acula was clearly written and intended for Bela Lugosi but is played by one Kenne Duncan who would also work with Wood on other projects. He isn’t terrible, but not a patch on how Bela would have handled the part.\n\nLt Bradford is played by Duke Moore, who had played the similar part of Lt Harper in “Plan 9”.\n\nLobo is, of course, played by Tor Johnson who had played him in “Bride”.\n\nOfficer Kelton is played for the third time by Paul Marco.\n\nTom Mason, who (ahem) doubled for Bela Lugosi in “Plan 9” turns up again, this time showing his face.\n\nThere are also a Black Ghost and a White Ghost. I wonder if the White Ghost is Ed himself?\n\nCriswell introduces the story from his coffin, as he did in “Plan 9”, narrates, and joins in the action at the end.\n\nSets, etc:\n\nWell, we’re all used to how Ed handles sets and “special” effects by this time but the shots of the “ghosts” during the “séance” truly top everything he’s done before. I can’t find the words, just have a look.\n\n(Under the sheet is, of course, Ed himself.)\n\nContinuity:\n\nContinuity, you say? In an Ed Wood movie? Yes, seriously. Does he handle it well? What do you think?\n\nTor Johnson returns as Lobo, whom he had played in “Bride”, but this time he’s horribly scarred. Well, I suppose being at the centre of an atomic blast will do that.\n\nThe police mention that this is the same house we saw in “Bride”- you know, the one that blew up. Except no it isn’t, it’s quite different.\n\nThe police officer played by Duke Moore is put on the case because he was on the “Bride” case. Which he wasn’t. His actor was in “Plan 9”, though.\n\nAs stated earlier, Paul Marco plays Officer Kelton as he had done in “Bride” and “Plan 9”. He complains that he always gets landed with spooks, aliens, etc.\n\nDirection:\n\nOur man has learned a bit from his previous efforts and this is more competently handled than its predecessors. Less stock footage, too. This, however, reveals a previously unsuspected side effect- it’s dull, apart from the seances. You thought it was difficult to hold interest through “Bride”? Try this one when you can’t sleep."
