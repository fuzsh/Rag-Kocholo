        "text": "By 1982, Murray had already proven himself as a more-than-capable leading man. When it came to Tootsie, though, he was far from the star but delivered as the deadpan, almost side-kick character in this massively popular hit. As the roommate of Dustin Hoffman's Michael Dorsey, who transforms into Dorothy Michaels, Jeff is sarcastic, witty (he is a playwright, after all), and loyal. This is not Murray's most memorable role, but it's a good example of how he could successfully adapt to different size roles — at least back then.\n\nMurray doesn't garner much screen time in this 1998 neo-noir thriller that stars Matt Dillon, Denise Richards, Neve Campbell, and Kevin Bacon. But when visible, Murray delivers rare moments of comic relief as the attorney (complete with the always funny neck brace and ambulance-chasing work attire) of Sam Lombardo (Dillon). Of course, plenty of plot twists follow.\n\nMurray has lent his talents to many types of films, including the world of live-action animation. That's where we find Frank DeTorre, a lazy zookeeper and widow who doesn't take the best care of his body. So, when he eats a questionable hard-boiled egg at the zoo, the animated city inside his body — featuring white blood cell Osmosis \"Ozzy\" Jones (Chris Rock) — goes to work to keep him safe, which is a challenge. The animated moments provide the best parts of this mediocre film, but the unappealing Frank is entertaining enough to get a mention.\n\nThe first of several instances on this list where we'll highlight Murray's work with quirky director Wes Anderson. In this case, a stop motion animated comedy from 2009. Murray's Clive Badger is a lawyer who represents Mr. Foxy Fox (George Clooney) when he looks to buy a tree home in a questionable neighborhood. The two characters might deliver the most memorable scene in the film that leads both to ask, \"Are you cussing with me?\"\n\nThe Hollywood film version of this popular TV series from the late 1970s and into the '80s was serviceable at best. But it helped kick off a film franchise. Murray was only around for the 2000 original movie. (There are various reasons why he didn't return for 2003's Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.) But it's safe to say that Murray's Bosley, the Angels' middle man between Charlie, was the most consistent comedic element within the film. That's not saying much, but still worthy of some attention.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Murray does not have to be the star of the show to come off as memorable. That's the case with this 2014 Wes Anderson project that earned multiple Oscar nominations. As one of several eccentric concierges associated with the Society of the Crossed Keys, Murray has some standout moments among more high-profile characters played by Ralph Fiennes, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, and Edward Norton. Anderson's movies aren't for everybody, but Murray tends to be subtly and consistently funny when he participates.\n\nPerhaps the most notable aspect of this crime comedy-drama from 1993 is that it was somewhat of a role reversal with co-star Robert De Niro. Murray's Frank Milo is an oddball crime boss who plays strong man to De Niro's mild-mannered Wayne Dobie, an employee of the Chicago Police Department. The movie is entertaining enough, and along with Uma Thurman, the two work relatively well together. The film's highlight must be the comical fight scene between the male co-leads.\n\nRobert Duvall is the star of this 2009 drama, but Murray more than holds his own in an underrated supporting role. Murray's Frank Quinn is the witty and highly professional funeral parlor owner willing to host the \"funeral party\" of local hermit Felix Bush (Duvall), even though he is still alive and wants to attend. While others in town have been leery of Felix, Frank is one of the few to embrace his wishes — perhaps because he welcomes the oddity of the situation.\n\nFrom 1979, this popular summer camp farce is notable for being Murray's first starring film role. As Camp North Star senior counselor, \"Tripper\" is a goofball with a good heart. He likes to have a good time, bust chops, and pull pranks while indirectly providing motivation for the less-than-joyous campers. Looking back on this Ivan Reitman project, it's cheesy, but it was good enough to kickstart Murray's budding movie career.\n\nOne of Murray's most recent pictures from 2020 and a film that earned him a Best Actor Golden Globe nomination. He stars alongside Rashida Jones, who plays his daughter in this perhaps forgotten comedy-drama. Felix is concerned about the faithfulness of his daughter's husband and tries to use that to bond with her. While Murray and director Sofia Coppola are best known for that Academy Award-nominated film that we will talk about later, their work here is quite unheralded. Felix was not the best dad, but Murray is rather charming in trying to make up for the past.\n\nIn 2014, Murray appeared in two episodes of his critically acclaimed HBO miniseries that chronicles the misanthropic, retired schoolteacher (Frances McDormand). Murray was nominated for both a Golden Globe and Primetime Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the role of Jack Kennison, a widower who finds himself involved in Olive's life. It was perhaps Murray's most celebrated television performance since those early Saturday Night Live days.\n\nIn 2012, Murray took on the role of portraying Franklin Roosevelt in this comedy-drama. Murray's performance was highly praised, surprising professional critics and plenty of fans that he could pull off such a historically significant character. It was also good enough to earn Murray a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor. This role cemented the fact that Murray can do just about anything as an actor and still find a way to succeed.\n\nGoing back to 2005 to a film that casual Murray film fans might have missed. This is a shame because Murray's performance as an aging \"Don Juan, who learns he has a grown child and embarks on a trek to find out, shouldn't be missed. Through the years, Murray continued to mature as an actor and can perfectly blend his comedic nature and dramatic flare within the comedy-drama genre of films that has been his bread and butter for the past few decades.\n\nWhile 1988's Scrooged has become a cult favorite over the years, it's been widely reported that it was not one of Murray's best experiences. Playing the lead in this modern-day version of A Christmas Carol, Murray's cynical and self-absorbed Frank Cross is the movie's highlight. It was another example of the reported difficulties cast, crew, and executives have had working with the star. Yet, when the lights are on, Murray tends to deliver.\n\nAnother Golden Globe nomination came Murray's way for this 2014 comedy-drama. Chalk this up as another unheralded performance from Murray, playing a retired Vietnam War veteran who is surly and continues to indulge in favorite vices like smoking and gambling. Those appear to be his main focus for living until he begins a friendship with bullied neighbor Oliver, who indirectly teaches Vincent that there is more to the man than his out-front, flawed existence.\n\nMurray and Richard Dreyfuss make for quite the comedic duo in this popular 1991 film. Sure, the premise is hokey. How many patients (Murray) would follow their self-absorbed psychotherapist on vacation with his family? Of course, that happens here, and comedy ensues. While Dreyfuss is solid as the straight man, the film is all Murray. Not the over-the-top goofiness he was known for during the 1980s, this is a performance that proved that he can still be funny while maturing as an actor.\n\nIn this 2004 Wes Anderson homage to the legendary diver and oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, Murray delivers a performance that should have been lauded more. He's brilliant as the quirky oceanographer, filming a documentary about his trek for revenge on the \"jaguar shark,\" which ate his co-worker and friend, Esteban du Plantier. During the journey, Steve must also deal with some personal circumstances that pop up, thus showing some endearing qualities masked by his obsession with the mission.\n\nThis is that other Murray film from 1993, and the one that truly proved his versatility as an actor. The premise of a disgruntled TV weatherman caught in a time loop while covering the annual Groundhog Day tradition in Punxsutawney, Pa., lends itself to be a comedy. But, Murray's performance was more dramatic and left audiences sympathetic to his plight. While the movie might be Murray's most popular when it comes to mass appeal, it opened the door for what would become his expansive film career.\n\nPlenty of die-hard Murray supporters believe \"Big Ern\" is the greatest character he's ever portrayed. That notion is up for debate. Still, Ernie McCracken takes the cake in the world of fictional bowling villains. He's lewd, crude, and totally full of himself. He's a showman and dork, and he doesn't care who he steps on. Of course, that's why we can't get enough of Murray's performance, which outshines that of lead Woody Harrelson in this 1996 Farrelly brothers' cult classic.\n\nMurray was back to a starring role with this 1981 comedy classic — again directed by Ivan Reitman. After losing his girlfriend and job, not to mention a good-looking pizza, on the same day, slacker John Winger and pal Russell (Harold Ramis) join the United States Army. The basic training boot camp scenes are some of the funniest Murray has delivered during his illustrious film career.\n\nA year after proving his worth as a leading funny man, Murray essentially stole the show in this hilarious supporting role alongside former Saturday Night Live castmate Chevy Chase, plus Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield. To plainly put it, Carl is creepy. He's dirty, both physically and in his mind, and is operating on various substances to get by. However, he's also determined when it comes to ridding Bushwood Country Club of its gopher problem. The performance only solidified Murray as a Hollywood star.\n\nMurray's second Golden Globe nomination came for this beloved 1998 Wes Anderson coming-of-age comedy-drama. When it comes down to it, this might be Murray's most complete role in terms of balancing comedy and drama without compromising either. Herman Blume is an odd, self-centered, and wealthy industrialist who befriends high schooler Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman). The two also find themselves in a harmless love triangle, where Max brings out the child in Herman. This is truly Murray at his finest.\n\nIs this the pinnacle of Murray's acting career? From a critical standpoint, sure. It's the role that earned Murray his only Academy Award nomination and delivered his only Golden Globe victory. This 2003 romantic comedy-drama is what officially put Murray up there with the likes of, say, Tom Hanks — a longtime funny man who proved he's more than worthy of succeeding in a dramatic role. As a somewhat washed-up actor relegated to Japan to promote whisky, Murray showcases a character with a wide range of emotions. Someone looking for purpose amid a midlife crisis, both professionally and personally. It's as deep as it's gotten for Murray and well executed.\n\nMurray has played his share of iconic movie characters, but the quirky, drew-witted, brilliantly goofy Dr. Peter Venkman has enjoyed quite the fictional life. The Ghostbusters franchise of films (beginning in 1984), and other outlets to keep the gang going, has a lot to do with Murray's popularity and earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination. Initially skeptical of ghosts and the paranormal, Dr. Venkman is proven wrong and becomes a spirited fighter for the cause. It's easy to cite Lost in Translation as Murray's \"best\" role, but Peter Venkman seems to be the one movie fans of all ages can celebrate."
