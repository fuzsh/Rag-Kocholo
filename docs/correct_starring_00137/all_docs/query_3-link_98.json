        "text": "If there’s something strange in your neighborhood, who you gonna call? Bill Murray, who suits back up as Peter Venkman in “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,” out March 22.\n\nMurray isn’t the only franchise favorite to return for the chilly sequel, which sees the Big Apple covered in ice after an ancient artifact unleashes an evil force. His fellow original Ghostbusters — Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson and Annie Potts — are back for “Frozen Empire,” and so is Slimer, aka “The Mean Green Ghost,” who returns with a vengeance.\n\nAccording to the sequel’s logline, “Ghostbusters new and old must join forces to protect their home and save the world from a second Ice Age.” The movie, which follows up 2021’s “Ghostbusters: Afterlife,” also stars Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Kumail Nanjiani, Patton Oswalt, Celeste O’Connor and Logan Kim.\n\n“Heads up. Tall, dark and horny at 12 o’clock,” Murray says in the trailer when the gang encounters a Devil-like, glowy-eyed beast. The new clip also features the Ectomobile zooming across New York, harnessing icy ghosts.\n\n“Frozen Empire” is directed by Gil Kenan, who wrote the script with Jason Reitman, who directed “Afterlife” and whose dad, Ivan, directed the original two “Ghostbusters” films. Ivan produces “Frozen Empire” along with his son Jason and Jason Blumenfeld. Executive producers include Aykroyd, Gil Kenan, JoAnn Perritano, Amie Karp, Erica Mills and Eric Reich.\n\n“It’s an absolute honor to pick up the proton pack and step behind the camera for the next chapter of the Spengler family saga,” said Kenan in a statement when he was announced as director. “I just wish I could go back to 1984 and tell the kid in the sixth row of the Mann Valley West that one day he was going to get to direct a ‘Ghostbusters’ film.”\n\nWatch the trailer below."
