        "text": "He was a sh*t to me on Life Aquatic. The first week I was there, we were all in this little hotel, and he invited the entire cast to go and have dinner, except me. And everyone came down for dinner, a little dog-faced about my not being invited, and they were all like, \"Oh, you know, we don’t really want to go.\" That was worse than anything...\n\nI think we met again in Florence, because that movie was shot all over Italy, and we were doing a scene at Gore Vidal’s house in Ravello, and he said, \"Hey, how’ve you been? I missed you.\" I said, \"You’re full of sh*t. You didn’t miss me.\" He looked all confused for a moment. He’s been a little nicer to me since. He showed up at my husband’s funeral. He couldn’t have been nicer that day. He showed up. A lot of people didn’t.\n\nHe was an Irish drunken bully, I didn't talk about it for years. Bill just got drunk at dinner... He came back from dinner [one night] and I said, \"Read this [script tweak], I think it's really funny.\" And he put his face next to me, nose-to-nose. And he screamed at the top of his lungs, \"Everyone hates you! You are tolerated!\"\n\nThere was no time to react, because he leaned back and he took a modern glass-blown ashtray. He threw it at my face from [only a couple feet away]. And it weighed about three quarters of a pound. And he missed me. He tried to hit me. I got up and left.\n\nI think Bill Murray was a little bit worried about me during Aloha because I had a really bad acne problem that they [edited] out of the movie [in post-production] because I was having some sleep issues. But seriously, on like a daily basis, he would bring me nice little presents. He would go to a concert and bring me a key chain, or he would go to a store and bring me Maui Onion potato chips... a visor, some slippers. It was pretty sweet.\n\nIt was sad and painful and awful... It was that same kind of tension you would get in a family... It was uncomfortable. You could understand, you know, there were these two bull moose going at each other. The testosterone was surging... I think they both knew the one thing that they could say to one another that would, you know, hurt the most.\n\nI’m still giggling about the fact Billy came up to me. It was maybe the second scene. I was preparing, because I had been to drama school. Now, I was supposed to re-experience the terror dogs in the refrigerator. I just saw some in there actually before this Zoom. But he came over - and I don’t know if you remember this Bill - but you went, \"What are you doing?\" I went, \"I’m preparing.\" You went, \"You’re what?\" I said, \"I’m preparing.\" You started to tickle and shake me and really you can’t do comedy if you’re gonna prepare. It’s ridiculous."
