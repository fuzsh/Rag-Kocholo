        "text": "How many film directors have a secret fear that they are really Ed Wood? Not in those words perhaps, but fearing that they share his faults. How many wonder if they have compromised artistic integrity in getting a film funded? Or that they never had any talent to begin with? Or that the various chaotic elements of filming that they threw together do not really add up to a coherent or sensible film?\n\nAfter all, what is it that successful film directors have that Edward D Wood Jr did not? Talent, most obviously. Yet perhaps it is not just that. Most film directors get to work with gifted actors, experienced camera crews, a team of scriptwriters, and competent editors who can throw all the fragmented recordings into one final coherent whole.\n\nThis is what Ed Wood lacked. He was a poverty row director, writer and actor who had to make his films with the materials he had to hand. What he did have was a colour-blind cameraman, actors who could not act, and no time or money to put together a good film.\n\nThat is part of the reason why Ed Wood is considered the worst film director who ever lived, whereas Tim Burton is a highly prestigious auteur whose films make millions. One only has to look at the making of Ed Wood to see the difference. Burton employs special effects, dolly shots, Dutch angles, zooms, arial and ground floor shots, superimposed images and montage footage, a bag of tricks that Ed could only have dreamed of using.\n\nBurton can do this because he has a budget that dwarfs any Ed Wood production. This film alone cost more to make than every Ed Wood movie put together, and yet it was a low budget for a Burton movie. The director even waived his salary to make it. Burton and the studio probably sensed that the movie would not be a moneymaker, but it was a personal labour of love for Burton, a chance to do something he enjoyed. For fans of the movie, it is a cult classic, an underrated offering by a popular director.\n\nThere is one film director who has never feared that he might secretly be Ed Wood, and that is Ed Wood himself. There are moments of doubt when the Ed Wood of the movie (Johnny Depp) begins to question his abilities. Studio bosses are unstinting in their criticism. One of them snarls that Wood’s movie is a ‘stink bomb’. Another film mogul laughs at the amateurish quality of Wood’s offering, and thinks he is being pranked. He later tells Wood that it is the worst film he ever saw.\n\nHowever, Wood’s most notable feature is his unshakeable faith in himself. The real Wood seems to have shared the lack of self-awareness that we see in his fictional self. In both cases, he continued to believe that his movies were classics. That he got to make so many movies is a miracle of persistence and hope, and perhaps a warning that inspirational platitudes about how one should always keep trying are often misplaced. Sometimes it would be more sensible to just give up.\n\nIn Wood’s eyes, he is a struggling genius like Orson Welles, another man who was actor, director and scriptwriter. Wood keeps a poster of his hero in his room, next to one of Bela Lugosi. In one of the film’s most hilarious moments (sadly with no basis in fact), Ed Wood storms away from his film set discouraged, and goes into a bar. Who should be sitting in that bar but Orson Welles (Vincent D’Onofrio) himself!\n\nNaturally the two men get to talking, and it is once again clear that the difference between a genius who makes good movies and an inspired but talentless director who makes bad movies operates on the horseshoe principle, whereby opposites become similar again. Like Wood, Welles is struggling to fund his treasured projects, and facing creative interference from his backers. For example, the decision to cast Charlton Heston as a Mexican in Touch of Evil. As a result, Welles gives Wood the encouragement he needs to continue his work, even though that is probably not a good idea.\n\nBurton’s approach to Ed Wood is both mocking and sympathetic. Wood’s many struggles are portrayed in a comical manner that does not admit any deeper poignancy. Nonetheless there is a sneaking admiration for Wood’s tenacity and his misguided but serious intentions.\n\nIn that respect I cannot help but approve. I set up this blog page to honour the movies that I love. My intention was to praise the best films that I have seen. Some of the choices may seem to have little artistic merit, but I saw something good in them.\n\nHowever if I had not created a page for good movies, I would have created one for bad movies. Bad movies, like good movies, have a spark of originality in them that is missing in competently-made but mediocre films. They do not follow predictable conventions, and hackneyed storylines. As in a good movie, the viewer gets to see something that they normally do not find in the unremarkable movies that lies inbetween. Of course many bad movies are a little dull but then so are a number of arthouse movies.\n\nWood’s movies are shot so randomly that they flow like a stream of consciousness. They are tied together by stock footage and arbitrary film shots that Wood took, and later decided to incorporate into his movie. The dialogue is deliriously absurd: “We are all interested in the future – for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives”.\n\nWatching Tim Burton’s film gives the viewer an insight into how such dreadful movies manage to get made at all, and also why they are so bad. During the course of the movie, we get to see Wood working on three films.\n\nWood’s first opportunity arises when Wood is given an opportunity by cynical producer, George Weiss (Mike Starr). Weiss unashamedly admits that his remit is making crap. His films are cheap exploitation works that are designed to be made cheaply. At the present time, he is interested in making a film about transvestism.\n\nWhile Weiss’s intentions are to make schlock, the project has a personal interest for Wood, because he is himself a cross-dresser. The result is that Wood takes the project seriously, and Weiss shows no interest in the production. He tells Wood, “Fine! Shoot whatever baloney you want. Just make sure it’s seven reels long.”\n\nWith no money or access to a studio, Wood resorts to guerrilla film-making. The crew are forced to flee when they see a police car, because they do not have a licence to film on the street. The resulting film is so bad that even Weiss is disgusted: “I wish I hadn’t blown every dime I ever made into making this stink bomb! And if I ever see ya again, I’ll kill ya!”\n\nGlen and Glenda is an execrably bad movie of course, but in its favour it is one of the first films to call for acceptance and respect for transvestites. Making Glen and Glenda also helped to liberate Wood. For the first time he was able to come out of the closet, or perhaps we should say out of his girlfriend’s closet, and admit that he liked wearing women’s clothes.\n\nFor the rest of the movie, Wood is surprisingly open about his liking for female clothing. He wears them in public, and while making his movies. He freely blurts out his penchant for cross-dressing, even on a first date.\n\nThis puts great strain on his relationship with his girlfriend, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker). She is shocked by his cross-dressing, and tolerates it with difficulty. Wood’s choice of like-minded friends also arouses her disgust: “Ed, this isn’t the real world!” she insists; “You’ve surrounded yourself with a bunch of weirdos”. Finally she leaves him, and Wood finds solace with the more accepting Kathy O’Hara (Patricia Arquette).\n\nIt is only fair at this point to mention that Fuller objected to her portrayal in the film, and said that she was supportive of Wood’s cross-dressing. It was, Fuller said, Wood’s drinking that caused her to break up with him, a vice that Burton barely mentions in the film. Curiously Fuller had a more successful career than any of Wood’s circle, and wrote a few songs that were performed by Elvis Presley.\n\nAnother film follows Glen or Glenda. This one is Bride of the Atom, renamed Bride of the Monster. Wood attempts to find a someone to fund the movie, but is initially unsuccessful. After meeting Loretta King (Juliet Landau), an aspiring actress, Wood mistakenly imagines that King is a wealthy heiress who has agreed to fund his movie, and gives her the lead role that he had set aside for Dolores. Alas, Wood is mistaken, and King has no money at all.\n\nStill the decision to cast King is typical of how ‘actors’ were often chosen for low-budget trashy movies. A cash-strapped moviemaker is forced to give into the demands of his financial backer, and find roles for a number of talentless amateurs whose only qualification for acting is that they bought their way into the movie.\n\nThis proves to be the case when the dogged director finally obtains the money to finish Bride of the Monster. Wood’s funder is a meat-packing tycoon, Don McCoy (Rance Howard) McCoy has only two demands for the movie: “Number one: I want the movie to end with a big explosion,” he insists. “But it ends with Dr Vornoff falling into the pit,” insists Wood. “Not anymore,” McCoy firmly says. “Number two. I got a son. He’s a little slow, but a good boy. And somethin’ tells me he’d make a helluva leadin’ man”.\n\nSo Wood makes the necessary changes, and the film goes into production. The explosion is little more than stock footage, but Wood has high hopes that he can include a giant octopus in the movie. The octopus is stolen from Republic Pictures, but as ever Wood has the Midas touch in reverse. His crew forget to steal the engine, so the scenes with the octopus involve the actors very obviously wrapping its tentacles around them.\n\nSomehow the film is finished and has its premiere. This proves to be a disaster, and the film crew are forced to make a hasty exit from an ugly mob. Does Wood learn his lesson? Not at all. He begins work on a new film, Grave Robbers from Outer Space.\n\nThis time, Wood’s desperation for financial backing takes an even more bizarre turn. He gets into discussions with a Baptist church that wishes to make a film about the twelve apostles. They are foolishly persuaded that the profits from Grave Robbers from Outer Space will help to fund their own movie. Profits?\n\nThis time the conditions set by the Baptists are mild. They insist that the blasphemous title is changed to Plan 9 from Outer Space, and they ask that Wood and his friends are baptised. I am reminded of how Larry Flynt promoted his magazines through evangelicals. In both cases, the sincerity of the two men in embracing a religious organisation is open to question.\n\nThe Baptists soon fear that they have literally made a deal with the devil. The sight of Wood shooting the film in his woman’s angora sweater seems hardly likely to set their mind at ease. Wood’s insouciant disregard for the most basic of film errors also adds to their dismay. The director pays no attention to continuity, with scenes alternating between daytime and night-time. Actors fall against cardboard gravestones that visibly topple over. “Mr Wood,” asks one of his backers, “do you know anything about the art of film production?”\n\nMoney, or its lack, is a key factor in understanding how Wood chose his cast, but he does seem to have had a knack for finding “misfits and dope addicts” to surround him, as Dolores might put it. Wood seems to have also been something of a no-talent spotter, recruiting his team on a whim. For fun, let us have a look at a few of them.\n\nBunny Breckinridge (played by Bill Murray) was a drag queen friend of Wood’s, a camp and fastidious man who was keen to get a sex change operation. He explains, “I’m getting my first series of hormone injections. When those girls kick in, they’re gonna take out my organs and make me a woman.” Bunny adds as an afterthought, “Goodbye, penis!” Alas, Bunny’s penis proves to be a stubborn guest, and he never makes the change. Bunny goes to Mexico to get a gender realignment operation, and comes back instead with a Mariachi band.\n\nAfter seeing Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson (George “The Animal” Steele) in the ring, Wood decides to recruit the giant for his film, even though Tor’s thick accent makes his dialogue in Plan 9 from Outer Space hard to follow. The muscular Tor makes an improbable police inspector, but at least Wood did not make the mistake that Coleman Francis (a director who competes with Wood for the title of worst film director) did. In The Beast of Yucca Flats. Francis had the wrestler playing a famous scientist!\n\nAfter Bela Lugosi dies early in the shooting of Plan 9 from Outer Space, Wood struggles to find a replacement actor who resembles Lugosi so that Wood can still use the material he has already filmed. His choice falls on his girlfriend’s chiropractor, Tom Mason (Ned Bellamy), who Wood is convinced looks just like Lugosi, even though Mason is a foot taller and bald. “Gee, I never noticed,” Wood exclaims; “Put a wig on him”.\n\nWood actively pursues another actress. This is Maila Nurmi (Lisa Marie), a presenter whose persona was Vampira. Anticipating Elvira, Vampira appeared on TV introducing horror movies whilst wearing a dress with a plunging neckline. However Vampira did not have the good jokes of Elvira, and her cleavage was more clammy than appealing.\n\nNone of this prevented Wood from fancying her, and even asking her for a date. While she has a successful TV show, Vampira refuses Wood’s professional and romantic overtures. However after she loses her job, she is more accommodating. Wood’s usual luck prevails. Vampira agrees to appear in Plan 9, but refuses to deliver any dialogue.\n\nHowever Wood’s biggest coup was to persuade one well-known actor to appear in three of his movies. That actor was Bela Lugosi (played by Martin Landau). Wood runs into Lugosi by accident when he sees the actor shopping for a coffin to sleep in. Wood is soon driving his hero home, and sitting in Lugosi’s house. The house is a low-rent version of Norma Desmond’s in Sunset Blvd. The room is filled with paraphernalia from Lugosi’s heyday, but squeezed into a small apartment.\n\nWhile Burton called his film Ed Wood, he could have called it Ed and Bela, as the story is essentially about the relationship that formed between the two men. Burton includes few details about Wood’s life before he met Lugosi, and makes no allusion to Wood’s other films made during this period.\n\nBurton’s movie also ends with the premiere of Plan 9, and only briefly mentions Wood’s subsequent career, which included films such as The Sinister Urge, which earnestly attacks the pornography industry, and its follow-up, Orgy of the Dead, which was, well, semi-pornographic.\n\nThis focus on Wood and Lugosi is sensible, as their touching tragicomic relationship forms the heart of the movie. What on earth would induce a respectable actor to appear in an Ed Wood movie? At the end of his life, Lugosi’s career had stalled. The actor was broke, depressed, and addicted to morphine and methadone.\n\nWhat Wood gets is not the confident and theatrical Lugosi of Dracula and White Zombie, but a bitter man, still living in the shadow of Boris Karloff, and spouting profanities. “But now, no-one gives to fucks for Bela,” he complains. Indeed most people think he is already dead. I should mention that Lugosi’s representation in the film has been challenged by his children. He did not sleep in a coffin. He did not own little dogs. He was a gentlemanly figure who did not swear. So I suppose he did not stride onto the set for Bride of the Monster and shout, “Let’s shoot this fucker!”\n\nNonetheless Wood feels a sincere love for his idol. He is supportive towards the only famous actor who ever appears in his films. When Lugosi goes into rehab, Wood fends off reporters and gets Lugosi back on his feet after the actor is thrown out because he has no money. Wood encourages Lugosi, saying that he looks much better, when the poor man looks half-dead.\n\nThere are also the nights when Wood receives a phone call from Lugosi and needs to go round to reassure his star. This can involve trying to prevent Lugosi from killing himself, and possibly taking Wood with him. Wood hopes that he can restore Lugosi’s former dignity by making a hit movie, but sadly the director’s good intentions are not matched by his ability.\n\nIt is impossible not to laugh at Ed Wood’s crude amateurism. Still Wood did not have the time to make a better production, and was forced to deceive himself that what he had filmed was brilliant. No matter how badly the scene goes, Wood is always convinced that he has achieved the perfect take.\n\nWhen Tor blunders into the set and the wall wobbles, Wood does not shoot the scene again, arguing, “You know, in actuality, Lobo would have to struggle with that problem every day”. Of course this is silly, and so is Wood’s remark when he attempts to rein in his unruly lead actor: “Bela, I have 25 scenes to shoot tonight”.\n\nYet in a way Wood is being realistic about what he could achieve. A major film studio could spend several days making just one scene. Wood has to make 25 in a night because he cannot afford to spend any more time or money making the film.\n\nOf course Wood was terrible, and some amateur moviemakers have made better films on the same amount of money. Good moviemaking is often a matter of judgement. Still, perhaps Wood’s films are no worse than the most disastrous mainstream movies that had millions of dollars thrown at them, and still turned out bad.\n\nWood did at least put his own personal signature on his works, and dared to make a move when all the odds were against him. Given the choice I would rather watch an Ed Wood movie than any dreary and predictable Hollywood production that has no surprises or art."
