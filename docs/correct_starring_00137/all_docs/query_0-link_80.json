        "text": "Today marks the 10th anniversary of Transcendence, a 2014 film starring Paul Bettany, Cillian Murphy, Morgan Freeman, Rebecca Hall, and the one and only, Johnny Depp. In this sci-fi thriller, Dr. Will Caster (Johnny Depp), who is the world's top guy when it comes to AI, is conducting experiments to create a sentient machine. He’s taking on some dangerous implications and ultimately puts his life at risk when his thirst for knowledge transcends into the unknown.\n\nThinking about this movie got me spiraling into what other Johnny Depp led movies live rent free in the minds of the audience. Is it something animated or a movie with a plot so unbelievable that it’s become a cult classic.? Either way, Johnny has been a jack of all trades taking on roles that have him transforming his look to where he’s unrecognizable (in a good way).\n\nFull disclaimer here that with almost 100 acting credits on IMDb, this list of 10 was the hardest one I've ever completed. So if your favorite Johnny Depp movie isn't on my list, you now know why. So sit back and scroll through the top 10 Johnny Depp movies that have left a significant impact on the world.\n\n10. Cry Baby We’re starting in 1990 with the bad boy with a heart of gold. Johnny was just 26 when the film hit theaters which makes this role THAT much more impressive. This misunderstood leather jacket wearing, singing heartthrob, motorcycle-riding juvenile delinquent not only drew all the girls to Johnny, but also made all the guys want to be him. 10/10 would recommend if you're looking to watch a comedy musical!\n\n9. Benny & Joon A rom-com for the ages. This is one of my favorites from Johnny because Sam connects with Joon on an entirely perfect level. This love story thrives on supporting each other through being entirely yourself, even if the way that they were brought together was a little unconventional (literally he was summoned to be a housekeeper because Benny lost a poker bet).\n\n8. Minamata If you haven’t heard about the movie that is inspired by true events in Minamata, Japan, you’re truly missing out on a cinematic masterpiece. Johnny takes on the role of War photographer W. Eugene Smith as he travels back to Japan where he documents the communities that were directly affected by mercury poisoning. While this movie has a heavy message and tone, watching this story will be a life-changing experience for you.\n\n7. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory As a millennial, I can say with the utmost confidence that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had made a significant impact on my childhood. With this film sharing the chocolate vibe from 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, the audience knew what to expect, but tbh, they were blown away with this reimagined concept. Johnny as Willy Wonka was truly iconic and no one could have come close to his commitment to being the chocolate king!\n\n6. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street The legendary tale of a Victorian London barber has entered the chat. Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter reunite once again to put on a performance of a lifetime. From the mind of Tim Burton, this story rises from the ashes to seek revenge. I for one was captivated the entire time with Johnny’s musical numbers and anticipating the drama and chaos that was about to follow.\n\n5. Donnie Brasco The duo of Al Pacino and Johnny Depp of course is making my list. Sitting right at number five, this bio crime drama is what 1997 dreams are made of. When Lefty (Pacino) brought Donnie (Depp) into his crime world, he took a risk that ultimately turned the mafia upside down. This movie was based on a true story which to me makes me feel like I was actually right there undercover with Donnie Brasco (sorry if that spoiled the plot to the 27 year old film for you).\n\n4. Edward Scissorhands You want another Tim Burton movie? I’ll give you another Tim Burton movie. Stepping out from a world of isolation, Edward Scissorhands is ready to get back into the real world with real problems and with people that are bound to look at him differently. They truly don’t make movies like this anymore and I’m so glad that Johnny was a part of this work of art.\n\n3. What's Eating Gilbert Grape I’m not sure if WEGG is considered a cult classic in the movie scene, but to me, it definitely is. Johnny stars as Gilbert Grape alongside Leonardo DiCaprio as Arnie Grape where they are on a journey together to keep the family bond as strong as possible when all odds are against them. In this film, we enter my favorite Johnny Depp hair era which is a plus, and knowing that both Depp & DiCaprio give award worthy performances should entice you to watch during your next movie night.\n\n2. Ed Wood Sitting at number two is another bio-dram, but this time, we add a little comedy into the mix. This two time Oscar winning film (for both Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Best Makeup), had brought actors Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker, and even Bill Murray together to tell the story of Ed Wood. Hollywood legend Ed Wood had a passion for storytelling and above all, the flare for the dramatics. The unforgettable cast listing alone should be enough to make you watch this black and white film."
