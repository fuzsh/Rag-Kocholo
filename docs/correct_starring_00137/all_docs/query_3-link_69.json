The film is based on Coppola’s time in Tokyo. It follows Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a recent college graduate who travels to Japan with her husband, but she ends up mainly exploring Tokyo alone until she becomes friends with Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a former movie star.\n\nWhy It’s A Good Option for Bill Murray Fans: Lost in Translation received a lot of critical praise and gained several Academy Award nominations, including a Best Actor nomination for Murray. The film also received attention for the ending that left viewers with a major question. Lost in Translation is one of Murray’s best performances and offers a different look at the actor known for his big and bold characters. It’s a more subdued, but just as compelling, performance.\n\nStream it on Peacock here.\n\nStripes (Showtime)\n\nStripes is one of the many Ivan Reitman, Bill Murray, and Harold Ramis collaborations.

Milo gives him a week with Glory (Uma Thurman) as a present.\n\nWhy It’s A Good Option for Bill Murray Fans: Bill Murray is not known for his tough-guy roles, and Robert De Niro is not known for softer roles, so this was clever casting in 1993 to put these respected actors in roles against their norms. De Niro, Uma Thurman, and Murray aren’t a combo that viewers see often nor expect to see, so it's fun to see them all together in Mad Dog and Glory.\n\nStream it on Peacock here.\n\nKingpin (Showtime)\n\nKingpin is a 1996 comedy from the Farrelly brothers, which stars Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid, Vanessa Angel, and Bill Murray.

Bill Murray’s character Big Ern is brass, vulgar, and a jerk, but he’s such an entertaining character to root against. Woody Harrelson and Murray have great onscreen chemistry, so it’s interesting watching him be the antagonist to Harrelson's protagonist in Kingpin.\n\nStream it on Showtime here.\n\nMoonrise Kingdom (Peacock)\n\nMoonrise Kingdom is one of Wes Anderson and Bill Murray’s many collaborations. It’s also just one of Anderson’s best movies. Moonrise Kingdom tells the story of two young kids who run off together, while the adults try to locate them. The cast of the film includes some of Anderson’s long-standing collaborators like Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, and Jason Schwartzman.\n\nWhy It’s A Good option for Bill Murray Fans: Bill Murray’s Walt Bishop isn’t one of Anderson’s best Murray characters, but he’s an interesting guy, full of Anderson-isms. Moonrise Kingdom is a film about young love and how it can make us feel invincible. It’s just an enjoyable movie that continues to showcase Murray’s range of quirky Wes Anderson characters.\n\nStream it on Peacock here.\n\nSaturday Night Live Bill Murray Sketches (NBC.com)\n\nNBC has over 80 sketches on-demand featuring Bill Murray from his time on Saturday Night Live as a regular cast member (1976-1980).\n\nWhy It’s a Good Option for Bill Murray Fans: Saturday Night Live is really what kicked off Bill Murray’s comedy career. These clips showcase Murray’s talent and bring nostalgia to those who watched them when they originally aired. If they weren’t alive or too young to remember them, these skits could also be an introduction to Murray’s time on SNL.\n\nStream it on NBC here."
