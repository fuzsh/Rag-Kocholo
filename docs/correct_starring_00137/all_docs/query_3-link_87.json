        "text": "These days, it's getting pretty hard to think of major Hollywood stars who haven't shown up in the MCU at some point in time – and the latest big name to appear is none other than Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day star Bill Murray.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor and comedian has a relatively minor role as Lord Krylar in new film Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania – starring alongside returning stars such as Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly and Michael Douglas in the first film of Phase 5.\n\nBut who actually is Lord Krylar?

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nWho is Lord Krylar?\n\nIn the film, Lord Krylar is the governor of Axia – a bizarre community in the Quantum Realm.\n\nHe is an old acquaintance of Janet van Dyne from her previous time there (indeed he makes a few pointed comments that indicate they were more than just acquaintances) and is the first person she decides to go to for help when finding herself back in the place she was trapped for so long.\n\nMore like this\n\nKrylar's high status has afforded him the opportunity to enjoy a life of luxury, which consists of eating expensive meals, drinking exotic cocktails and enjoying top-notch transportation aboard his huge pleasure yacht.\n\nInterestingly, this is rather different to the character of the same name who appears in the comics, who was introduced in 1972 as an alien scientist of the Microverse who served a crazy warlord known as Visis.\n\nDespite bearing the same name, then, this Lord Krylar is best viewed as an original character created for this film.\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is released in UK cinemas on Friday 17th February.
