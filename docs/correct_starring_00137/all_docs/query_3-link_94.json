        "text": "Preview:\n\nWes Anderson is locking in the cast for his next movie.\n\nBill Murray, Michael Cera and Benicio Del Toro are the first people added.\n\nRoman Coppola worked on the script with the director.\n\nHaving brought us not just his latest movie, ‘Asteroid City’, but four short films based on the work of Roald Dahl last year, Wes Anderson could easily just take 2024 off. But he’s already got a new film in the works, and now, via World of Reel, we know that Bill Murray and Michael Cera are aboard to star, alongside Benicio Del Toro, who was previously announced.\n\nWhat’s the story of Wes Anderson’s next movie?\n\nAnderson, who apparently finished the script (working alongside occasional collaborator Roman Coppola) before last year’s writers’ strike, has been keeping the details close to his chest.\n\nBut in an interview with Le Monde last June, Anderson did spill a little bit about it, including divulging a reunion with Benicio Del Toro, who appeared in the director’s ‘The French Dispatch’:\n\n“My next feature film will be linear, with Benicio Del Toro in every shot. I can’t tell you much more than that except that it will be about espionage, a father-daughter relationship, and, let’s say, with a rather dark tone.”\n\nRelated Article: Every Wes Anderson Movie Ranked!\n\nWho will appear in the new Wes Anderson movie?\n\nWith Del Toro already confirmed, Murray is hardly a surprise. He’s worked on nine of Anderson’s movies and bowed out of ‘Asteroid City’ because of a combination of scheduling issues and complaints against his behavior on another movie. It would seem that despite those complaints, Anderson is only too happy to stick by him.\n\nMichael Cera would be a new recruit to the director’s extensive troupe, but we can certainly see him fitting in with the quirky, mannered style that is as much a part of Anderson’s canon as his perfectly composed frames.\n\nAnderson had intended to start shooting the movie last fall, but he had to delay because of the actors’ strike. The plan is now to kick off filming later in the spring.\n\nWhile this latest project is reportedly going to feature a much smaller cast than the sprawling ensemble of ‘Asteroid City’, we’d expect to learn of at least a few more additions in the coming months.\n\nWhen will Wes Anderson’s new movie be in theaters?\n\nAs of right now, there’s no word on a release date for the movie. Could he have this one done in time for awards season? We’d have our doubts, but anything is possible at this point.\n\nOther Wes Anderson Movies:\n\n'Bottle Rocket' (1996)\n\n'Rushmore' (1999)\n\n‘The Royal Tenenbaums' (2002)\n\n‘The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' (2004)\n\n'The Darjeeling Limited' (2007)\n\n'Fantastic Mr. Fox' (2009)\n\n'Moonrise Kingdom' (2012)\n\n'The Grand Budapest Hotel' (2014)\n\n'Isle of Dogs' (2018)\n\n‘The French Dispatch' (2021)\n\n'Asteroid City' (2023)"
