        "text": "In ’94 I knew very well who Ed Wood was so when this film hit theaters, I was devouring the news articles and couldn’t wait to see it. Opening weekend off I went. If I recall correctly, to a theater that was sparsely occupied. Plenty of empty seats. In the end, it was the absentees loss and not mine. Years later I still love this flick that takes us on a journey of a dreamer trying to make good in Hollywood and more importantly a window to the latter days of horror icon Bela Lugosi. It’s the relationship of Depp and Landau that represents the heart of the film and one that can easily tug at the heart strings for those of us that love the glory years of horror and all things Bela.\n\nThe irony is that Martin Landau as Lugosi won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor while Bela himself I think it safe to say never got a sniff of the real thing throughout his career. I have heard it said that too many liberties were taken with some of the scenes and language but I feel the spirit of Bela is there and with all the little nods to history, I think Landau does justice to “poor Bela.”\n\nThis turned out to be one of those films that I still find myself spouting off quotes from. All in fun but many of them strike my funny bone so enjoy this gallery of pics and selected quotes from the many characters that populate the wacky world of Ed Wood.\n\nJohnny Depp as Ed Wood had these fine things to say.\n\n“This is the one. ‘This’ is the one I’ll be remembered for. ”\n\n“Really? Worst film you ever saw. Well, my next one will be better. Hello. Hello. ”\n\n“This story’s gonna grab people. It’s about this guy, he’s crazy about this girl, but he likes to wear dresses. Should he tell her? Should he not tell her? He’s torn, Georgie. This is drama. ”\n\n“My girlfriend still doesn’t know why her sweaters are always stretched out. ”\n\n“I like to wear women’s clothes. Panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps. It’s just something I do. And I can’t believe I’m telling you this, but I really like you, and I don’t want it getting in the way down the road. ”\n\nMartin Landau as Bela Lugosi knocks it out of the park.\n\n“How dare that a–hole bring up Karloff? You think it takes talent to do Frankenstein? It’s all makeup and grunting. ”\n\n“Home? I have no home. Hunted… despised… living like an animal. The jungle is my home! But I will show the world that I can be its master. I shall perfect my own race of people… a race of atomic supermen that will conquer the world! ”\n\n“This is the most uncomfortable coffin I’ve ever been in. Your selection is quite shoddy. You are wasting my time. ”\n\n“I’m not getting near that goddamn thing. One of them burned me in “The Return of Chandu”. ”\n\n“Pull the string! Pull the string! ”\n\nBill Murray pipes in as Bunny Breckinridge…..\n\n“How do you do it? How do you get all your friends to get baptized just so you can make a monster movie? ”\n\n“What about glitter? When I was a headliner in Paris, audiences always liked it when I sparkled. ”\n\nJeffrey Jones turns up as the all seeing, Criswell.\n\n“Eddie, we’re in show biz. It’s all about razzle-dazzle. Appearances. If you look good, and you talk well, people will swallow anything. ”\n\n“Greetings, my friends! You are interested in the unknown. The mysterious. The unexplainable. That is why you are here. And now, for the first time, we are bringing you the full story of what happened. We are giving you all the evidence based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal. The incidents, places. My friends, we cannot keep this a secret any longer. Can your heart stand the shocking facts of the true story of Edward D. Wood Jr.? ”\n\nSarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller……\n\n“Ed, this isn’t the real world. You’ve surrounded yourself with a bunch of WEIRDOS! ”\n\n“Ed, what’s *my* motivation? ”\n\nVincent D’Onofrio inspiring as Orson Welles.\n\n” Visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else’s dreams? ”\n\nLisa Marie makes for a stunning Vampira.\n\n“You’re watching our Halloween movie, “White Zombie”, starring Bela Lugosi, John Harron, Madge Bellamy, and a bunch of other people I’ve never heard of. ”\n\nTor Johnson a perfect fit for George “The Animal” Steel.\n\n“Mister Bunny, what’s wrong? I heard you were becoming a lady. ”\n\nEd finds the love of his life as Patricia Arquette plays Kathy O’Hara.\n\n“Does this mean… you don’t like sex with girls? ”\n\nA parting shot of Ed and Bela both imagined……\n\nand for real……"
