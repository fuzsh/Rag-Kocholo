        "text": "Butterfly Pavilion is the first stand-alone, Association of Zoos and Aquariums-accredited non-profit invertebrate zoo in the world and a leader in invertebrate knowledge, inspiration and connection. Whether it is providing unique, hands-on learning experiences in our exhibits and educational programs, conducting new research that sets the standard for zoos across the country or building innovative solutions for species and habitat conservation in countries around the world, Butterfly Pavilion is leading the way in ensuring invertebrates are protected for the future.\n\nMission\n\nButterfly Pavilion exists to foster an appreciation of invertebrates by educating the public about the need to protect and care for threatened habitats globally, while conducting research for solutions in invertebrate conservation.\n\nVision\n\nButterfly Pavilion is the premier invertebrate education, research and conservation institution in the world.\n\nFunding\n\nButterfly Pavilion was created by the Rocky Mountain Butterfly Consortium, a Colorado nonprofit founded in 1990. As a publicly supported facility, Butterfly Pavilion is primarily supported by admission fees, community support and by the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD). The eleven-acre site was provided by the City of Westminster.\n\nOperations\n\nButterfly Pavilion is a Colorado 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and operates with a Board of Directors in collaboration with scientific advisors from zoos, universities, and museums, both locally and nationally.\n\n“The selection of those employees, consultants, contractors, accountants, attorneys and other professional agents of the facility by the management, Board or any committee or Officer designated to do so, shall be based upon their respective qualification and/or capabilities and shall not be based on age, race, sex, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, marital status, gender, military status, veteran status, political service, affiliation, disability, sexual orientation, transgender status, gender identity or gender expression. (as amended by the Board of Directors June 27th 2011.)”\n\nIn-Kind Donation Requests\n\nButterfly Pavilion is proud to support our community by considering in-kind donation requests of 4-pack of admission tickets to 501(c)3 nonprofits in support of fundraising events. Please be sure to submit your request at least 3 months prior to your event. Only one request will be fulfilled per organization per year. Please submit your request through the form below. Due to the high volume of requests we receive, we are not able to honor every request."
