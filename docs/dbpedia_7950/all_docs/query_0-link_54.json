        "text": "Welcome to a new year of Belletrista! We have exciting plans for 2011, including two themed issues. In this issue we present all the things you've come to expect in an issue of Belletrista, but we are always trying to improve, and are consistently on the look-out for new ideas. In this issue we offer our readers two excerpts from new or forthcoming books as not only a way to sample what these books have to offer, but also as a means of introducing talented writers. In our New & Notable section, we have given Canadian books its own section, bringing it out from underneath the shadow of its literarily larger neighbor, the United States, to make it easier for you, our readers, to explore this country's literature. If you have something to say about any of the books or authors we feature, we invite you to visit our blog, \"If Written by a Woman\", and share them. Happy Reading!"
