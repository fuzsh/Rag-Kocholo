        "text": "Field Guides for Butterfly Identification\n\nThe Field Guides of eBMS want to be useful to identify butterflies in the field easily and simply. The butterfly species are organised by families and genus and symbols identify useful characteristics to identify butterfly species easily.\n\nYou can download to your devices and print all these free field guides\n\nWe selected the most common species per region reducing the number of species in each Field Guide with the help of butterfly experts and BMS coordinators. This useful material will help volunteers and involve people in butterfly monitoring. See below the different Field Guides created per country or region and download the pdfs in several languages. There are Field Guides for:\n\nAustria - Vienna & Burgenland\n\nCyprus\n\nDenmark\n\nFrance - Temperate plains\n\nGreece - Corfu\n\nItaly - per regions\n\nLithuania\n\nMalta\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal - Madeira\n\nSlovenia – common and mountain species\n\nSlovakia – common species\n\nSpain – Common species Spain, regions of Andalucía, Castilla-La Mancha and Galicia\n\nOther countries at the bottom of the page.\n\nAustria\n\nTwo different field guides to identifying the most common butterfly species in the area.
