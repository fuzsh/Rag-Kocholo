        "text": "Colombia contains the greatest diversity of orchids, birds, frogs, and freshwater fish globally. There are almost 4000 species of butterflies spread throughout the country’s various regions. Your participation in our Colombia butterfly tours helps to document the vast biodiversity of Colombia, contributing to the impressive and ever-growing list of butterfly species found there.\n\nColombia is unique in the way its topography forms many natural obstacles that substantially hinder the movement of species, creating many different zones of speciation. The Three Cordilleras (Western, Central, and Eastern) are the most obvious hindrance to animal movement, which function as natural barriers in distributing species that inhabit altitudes above 2000 meters. In between the Three Cordilleras, one can find the valleys of the Magdalena and Cauca Rivers, which present species and races characteristic of these ecosystems. Separate from the Andes to the north rises the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, reaching an astonishing 5700 meters and acting as a high elevation island of speciation. The forests along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts provide unique opportunities to experience the biodiversity of Colombia as well. Where the vast plains of the Orinoquia meet the majestic Amazon jungles and where the Andean mountains meet, the plains are also incredibly diverse and unique places.\n\nIn Colombia, you can photograph nearly 4000 species in their natural habitat helping to bring an appreciation for this charismatic group of insects that surround us every day.\n\nFeatured Trips\n\nAmazon Basin and Sierra de Santa Marta\n\nJoin us on an amazing butterfly tour of Colombia!
