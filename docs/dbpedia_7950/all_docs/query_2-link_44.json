        "text": "Idea leuconoe, also known as the paper kite butterfly, rice paper butterfly or large tree nymph is known for its presence in our butterfly house. They are of Southeast Asian origin, but can also be found in Northern Australia and Southern Taiwan.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe Large Tree Nymph has a wingspan of 120 to 140mm!\n\nThe Owl butterflies are species of the genus Caligo and are known for their huge eyespots, which resemble owls' eyes. They are found in the rainforests of Mexico, Central and South America.\n\nDid you know?\n\nWith a wingspan of 65 - 200mm Owl butterflies are very large and fly only a few metres at a time!\n\nThe Common Green Birdwing (Ornithoptera priamus) has an average wingspan of 180 - 220mm and belongs to the genus Ornithoptera that contains the largest and most spectacular butterflies of the world.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe butterfly gets its specific name of ‘priamus’ after Priam – the king of Troy during the Trojan War.\n\nThe Blue Morpho butterfly has vivid blue wings that are edged with black. With wingspans anywhere between 125 and 200mm, they are among the largest butterflies in the world.\n\nDid you know?\n\nBlue Morphos' wings are not actually blue! The blue is not caused by pigmentation; it is caused by the way light reflects off of microscopic scales on the back of their wings.\n\nCethosia biblis is medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan reaching about 80 - 90mm.\n\nTheir astonishing pattern helps to disguise the shape of the butterfly, while the intense colour of the dorsal sides of the wings is a warning to predators it tastes bad due to the poisonous host plants eaten by the caterpillars.\n\nDid you know?\n\nAdults are most active in the morning and feed on nectar.\n\nThe Malachite (Siproeta stelenes) is a species of tropical butterflies and a member of the brush-footed butterfly group. They are one of the most familiar butterfly species in South America and are known for their unusual coloration and large size. In fact, with a wingspan of up to 100mm, they are one of the largest butterfly species of the world.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe Malachite gets its name from the mineral malachite that bears the same shade of green.\n\nThe males are pale yellow with black margins, or brown on the underside, and they have long tails on their hind wings. Their wingspan can be 100 - 120mm.\n\nDid you know?\n\nIt can be hard to correctly identify the females because they can take a variety of forms. They mimic distasteful milkweed butterflies to avoid being eaten by predators.\n\nThe Orange Swallowtail, Papilio thoas, is a butterfly of the family Papilionidae. It is found from the southernmost United States to as south as Argentina and Uruguay. The species is easily confused with the Giant Swallowtail, which it closely resembles in both larval and adult stages.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe Orange Swallowtail has a wingspan of 100 - 130mm\n\nThe atlas moth is among the biggest insects on the planet, with a wingspan stretching up to 27 centimetres across - that's wider than a human handspan. And the caterpillars of the species reach up to 12 centimetres long, spending every spare second eating.\n\nDid you know?\n\nIn Taiwan, the cocoons of Atlas Moths are used as purses!"
