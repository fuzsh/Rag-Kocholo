Known for its ability to travel large distances, the migrations in North America are one of the greatest natural phenomena in the world - where the adult butterflies can migrate from as far north as Canada to the overwintering grounds in Mexico, the west coast of California and Florida.\n\nMillions of the butterflies make a 2,000-mile (3,220km) journey each year from Canada to pass the winter in central Mexico’s warmer weather. But climate change, pesticides and the incursion of illegal loggers have seen the forests dwindle and with them, the number of monarchs.\n\nFirst recorded in the UK in 1876.\n\nSize and Family\n\nFamily: Nymphalids\n\nSize: Large\n\nWing Span Range (male to female): 95-100mm\n\nConservation Status\n\nButterfly Conservation priority: Low\n\nEuropean status: Not assessed\n\nCaterpillar Foodplants\n\nCaterpillars feed on various Milkweeds (Asclepias species), a plant which is not native to the British Isles, and this explains why the butterfly has not been recorded to have bred here.\n\nHabitat\n\nA rare migrant to the UK but in North America, the butterfly can be found almost anywhere that their foodplant grows, including farmland, gardens and even roadsides. The Monarch overwinters in sheltered forests made up of Eucalyptus trees, Monterey pines and Monterey cypresses.\n\nDistribution"
