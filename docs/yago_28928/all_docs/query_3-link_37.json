        "text": "The Crown of Queen Adelaide is a crown that was made in 1831 for Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, the Queen Consort of King William IV of the United Kingdom. It is one of the smaller and more modest crowns of the British Royal Collection.\n\nDesign[]\n\nThe Crown of Queen Adelaide was designed by the court jeweler of the time, Edward Strode. It is made of gold and is set with 1,333 diamonds and 169 pearls. The crown has four crosses patt√©e and four fleurs-de-lis arranged on a band, with a monde and cross at the top. The monde is a small globe, which represents the world, and the cross on the top represents Christ's dominion over the world. The inside of the crown has a velvet lining, which is embroidered with the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe Crown of Queen Adelaide was made for the Coronation of Queen Adelaide in 1831. Adelaide was the wife of King William IV of the United Kingdom, who reigned from 1830 to 1837. The crown was only worn once, by Queen Adelaide during the coronation ceremony on September 8, 1831. Adelaide wore the crown for a short time before she exchanged it for the smaller Imperial State Crown, which was more comfortable.\n\nToday, the Crown of Queen Adelaide is part of the Royal Collection and is on display in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. It is one of the smaller and more modest crowns in the collection, and it is rarely used. When it is used, it is worn by a female member of the Royal Family during certain ceremonial occasions.\n\nUse during the Coronation Ceremony[]\n\nThe Crown of Queen Adelaide holds a significant place among the many crowns used during the Coronation Ceremony to crown the Queen Consort of the United Kingdom. Named after Queen Adelaide, the wife of King William IV, this exquisite crown is an integral part of the British monarchy's regalia.\n\nDuring the Coronation Ceremony, the Crown of Queen Adelaide is typically placed on the head of the Queen Consort by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who officiates the ceremony. As the highest-ranking clergyman in the Church of England, the Archbishop's blessing and presence symbolize the religious and spiritual aspects of the coronation.\n\n\"May this Crown, adorned with the grace and heritage of Queen Adelaide, be a testament to the Queen Consort's dedication and devotion. With the divine blessing, may she find strength, wisdom, and compassion as she supports and stands by her royal partner in service to the nation.\"\n\nThis blessing emphasizes the symbolic significance of the Crown of Queen Adelaide and the Archbishop's role in anointing the Queen Consort, invoking blessings for her reign and emphasizing her commitment to serving the country.\n\nLegacy[]"
