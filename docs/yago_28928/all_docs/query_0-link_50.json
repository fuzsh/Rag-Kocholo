        "text": "William IV (born August 21, 1765, London, England—died June 20, 1837, Windsor Castle, near London) was the king of Great Britain and Ireland and king of Hanover from June 26, 1830. Personally opposed to parliamentary reform, he grudgingly accepted the epochal Reform Act of 1832, which, by transferring representation from depopulated “rotten boroughs” to industrialized districts, reduced the power of the British crown and the landowning aristocracy over the government.\n\nThe third son of King George III, he entered the Royal Navy at the age of 13, fought in the American Revolution, and, while serving in the West Indies, formed a close friendship with the future naval hero Horatio (afterward Viscount) Nelson. When he left the sea in 1790, however, he had become unpopular with many other fellow officers and had angered his father by his numerous love affairs. Between 1794 and 1807 he had 10 illegitimate children (surnamed FitzClarence) by the Irish comedienne Dorothea Jordan. His marriage (July 11, 1818) to Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen produced two daughters, both of whom died in infancy. On William’s death, therefore, the British crown passed to his niece Princess Victoria, and the Hanoverian crown passed to his brother Ernest Augustus, duke of Cumberland.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFit for a King (or Queen): the British Royalty Quiz\n\nThe duke became heir presumptive on the death (November 6, 1817) of Princess Charlotte Augusta, the only legitimate child of his elder brother, the Prince Regent (afterward King George IV, reigned 1820–30). In April 1827 the new prime minister, George Canning, revived for him the office of lord high admiral, but he was forced to resign in August 1828, when the duke of Wellington was premier. After succeeding George IV as king, William proved to be less brilliant but also less selfish and more attentive to official business than his brother had been."
