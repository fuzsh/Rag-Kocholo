        "text": "While William IV of the UK had several illegitimate children with his mistress Dorothea Jordan, none of his legitimate children with Queen Adelaide survived childhood.\n\nThe question is how would history have been affected if four of theses children survived. There would be not Victoria and Albert (and if Victoria existed she'd be a minor princess) and as such her many descendants would not exist. What would have been probable matches for the Clarence kids and how might having a born and bread Hanoverian on the throne, as well as the continuing personal union, have impacted the monarchy's position in the UK.\n\nFor reference William and Adelaide's kids are:\n\nPrincess Charlotte (March 1819)\n\nstillborn child (Sept. 1819)\n\nPrincess Elizabeth (Dec. 1820)\n\nIOTL Stillborn twin boys who, for this thread, can be called the future Prince of Wales and Duke of York (April 1822)\n\n(I kept the child between Charlotte and Elizabeth stillborn as, based on dates, the kid was likely extremely premature due to being born less than 6 months after Charlotte if we assume Adelaide got pregnant the day after Charlotte's birth, which she didn't. If you'd like that stillborn child to live for added butterflies, you can push back their DOB by a few months)\n\nActually I'd say it changes a hell of a lot. Victoria was entirely uneducated when she came to the throne and easily fell under Melbourne's spell. She basically learned that the Monarch's role was to only act with her minister's suggestions/advice and had little power to say no, a complete lie legally. Then Victoria and Albert really didn't put much effort into fighting for domestic influence and instead focused on foreign affairs, which put them against Palmerston. Big guess who won that fight. It wasn't until the 1860s and 1870s that Victoria really tried to assert herself to very mixed results. A well-educated monarch in 1837 would be in a much better position to retain the continued use of the royal prerogative without the constant need of the ministers. I'd say the best way to continue this power would be either with the Reform Crisis (get a Tory reform that disenfranchised the rotten boroughs and transfers their votes to the industrial towns) or in 1834, when William IV appointed a PM contrary to the will of Parliament (have Peel pull a Pitt the Younger and refuse to resign in the votes of no confidence until the country supports the PM).\n\nEven then, a monarch could still retain the use of the prerogative if they try. Establish the right to dismiss individual ministers, ignore votes of no confidence if they retain the Crown's backing, ex ex. I think it would be possible to keep the Crown at George III level influence for a good while if the monarch is skilled enough.\n\nKing William IV of United Kingdom (1765-1837) m. 1818, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen (1792-1849)\n\nPrincess Charlotte (27 March 1819-) m. 1837, William III of the Netherlands (1817-1890)\n\nPrincess Adelaide (5 December 1819[1]-) m. 1839, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1818-1893)\n\nLouise (9 December 1839-) m. 1953 Leopold II of Belgium (1835-1909)\n\nErnest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1841)\n\nPrincess Elizabeth (10 December 1820) m. 1840, Christian IX of Denmark (1818-1903)\n\nWilliam V (8 April 1822) m. 1842, Auguste Sophie Friederike (1823-1899)\n\nGeorge V (3 June 1843-14 May 1912) m. 1861, Grand Duchess Alexandra Alexandrovna of Russia (30 August 1842 – 10 July 1919)\n\nWilliam VI (1863-)\n\nAugusta, Princess Royal (1 December 1844-20 November 1925)\n\nWilliam, Duke of Clarence and St Andrews (24 December 1845-18 March 1913)\n\nPrincess Adelade (26 November 1847-13 October 1928)\n\nPrincess Victoria (29 September 1853-26 February 1933)\n\nEdward, Duke of Kent (27 October 1858-14 January 1939)\n\nPrince George, Duke of York (8 April 1822-1846) m. 1840, Princess Augusta of Cambridge (19 July 1822-5 December 1919)\n\nWilliam, Duke of Kent (22 July 1845 – 11 June 1914) m.

I could see memoirs of the Clarence kids being published lamenting the fate of \"poor cousin Vicky\" being stuck with her mother until she dies, at which point her best chance to marry is with a royal who has kids and is looking for a stepmom which, given Victoria's mothering skills IOTL, is destined to end poorly for all involved.\n\nThat I don't know.
