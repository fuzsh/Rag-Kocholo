Hindmarsh's term of appointment was to commence 28 December 1836, and ended after 1 year and 200 days on 16 July 1838.\n\nThe Governor was given those written orders from King William IV, known as The Letters Patent, \"which expressly sought to protect ... [the] ... traditional rights to land and resources [of the existing inhabitants] in the following words: '… Provided Always that nothing in those our Letters Patent contained shall affect or be construed to affect the rights of any Aboriginal Natives of the said Province to the actual occupation or enjoyment in their own Persons or in the Persons of their Descendants of any Lands therein now actually occupied or enjoyed by such Natives'[2]. Ref.1 confirms that \"Hindmarsh ... stated that Aborigines were to be treated justly and were 'equally entitled to the privileges of British subjects'. However, the Resident Commissioner, James Hurtle Fisher[3] and the Secretary of State for the Colonies clearly had other plans, and Hindmarsh was sent back home in 1838, after the death of William IV in 1837, no doubt influenced by the wealthy merchants of the South Australian Company[4]that had been established in 1835.\n\nSources\n\n↑ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hindmarsh\n\n↑ https://www.adelaide.edu.au/press/system/files/media/documents/2020-07/uap-natural-history-cllmm-ebook.pdf\n\n↑ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hurtle_Fisher\n\n↑ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian_Company\n\nWikipedia: William IV of the United Kingdom\n\nLuke Mosley, Qifeng-Ye, Scoresby Shepherd, Steve Hemming, Rob Fitzpatrick, Editors, 2018, 'Natural History of the Coorong, Lower Lakes, and Murray Mouth Region (Yarluwar-Region)'.
