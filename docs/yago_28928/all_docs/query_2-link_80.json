After his brother, George IV, died, he ascended to the throne on 26 June 1830, at age 64. Somewhat colourless with Spartan tastes, he was notably eccentric, but had a humdrum old age.\n\nHis reign saw several reforms: the poor law was updated, child labour restricted, slavery abolished in nearly all of the British Empire, and the British electoral system refashioned by the Reform Act 1832.\n\nWilliam had a liaison for some 20 years with the actress Mrs. Jordan; they had eight children who were given the name FitzClarence. He married in 1818; two daughters who both died.\n\nHe died on 20 June 1837 in Windsor, England. His niece (Queen) Victoria wrote in her diary that day that she had been informed that he \"had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen.\"\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nassociate relationship with George Rawdon-Hastings, 2nd Marquess of Hastings (born 4 February 1808).

This morning about two o'clock her majesty was taken in labour . . . and was safely delivered of a prince at a quarter before four o'clock.\" Scholfield quotes same data in \"An Illustration of the Liturgy of the Church of England\" by Thomas Pruen (Rivington, 1820), p. 153: \"born August 21, 1765, a quarter before 4 in the morning.\" Scholfield notes various books containing the same data. For example, \"MEMOIR OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF CLARENCE, LORD HIGH ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND\" in \"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction\" (London: J. Limbird, 1828): \"The DUKE of CLARENCE, who is next brother to his present Majesty, was born at St. James's Palace, August 21, 1765, at a quarter before four in the morning, and in the following month was baptized by the name of WILLIAM HENRY.\"\n\nPreviously: Lyndoe in AA 7/1982 gives \"sunrise.\" Dana Holliday has \"3:00 to 4:00 AM\" from a biography. PC gives 2:00 PM as \"recorded,\" not verified. None of these references come with sources, but Scholfield quotes a contemporary news report and two biographies with a time of 3:45 a.m., therefore the RR has been upgraded from DD to A.\n\nTime of death quoted from The Letters of Queen Victoria: A Selection From Her Majesty's Correspondence Between the Years 1837 and 1861 by Queen Victoria of Great Britain (Library of Alexandria, 1907).\n\nCategories\n\nFamily : Childhood : Advantaged\n\nFamily : Childhood : Order of birth (Third son)\n\nFamily : Relationship : Number of Marriages (One)\n\nFamily : Relationship : Stress - Extramarital affairs (Mrs. Jordan, 20 years)\n\nFamily : Parenting : Foster, Step, or Adopted Kids (Eight illegitimate kids)\n\nFamily : Parenting : Kids 1-3 (Two daughters)\n\nFamily : Parenting : Kids -Traumatic event (Both daughters died)"
