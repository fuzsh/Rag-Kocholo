        "text": "The many headlines generated by Prince Harry, younger son of Prince Charles, may inspire one to look back in time and see how unruly royals fared in the past. Let’s travel back to the early 19th century.\n\nThis prince was a middle son in a very large royal family, not expected to ascend to the throne of England when born. He threw himself into a military career. He was wild and boisterous, given to carousing, and fell deeply in love with an actress. During their many years together, she financially supported him. Sometimes mocked by the public, he had a warm heart, a generous nature, and a willingness to listen that gave him a popularity few others in his family enjoyed.\n\nMeet William, Duke of Clarence and later King of England from 1830 to 1837.\n\nIn these days of Harry and Meghan, William’s career presents some interesting comparisons.\n\nBorn on August 21, 1765, he was the third son of George III and Queen Charlotte. As was common in the age, his parents did not see that much of him. He was in the hands of private tutors at Richmond and Kew and seems to have been emotionally closest to his sister Augusta."
