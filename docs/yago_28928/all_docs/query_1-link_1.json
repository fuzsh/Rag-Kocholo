The molded rim portraits of William and Adelaide are hand-enameled. One of a series of plates issued with a variety of decorations in the center. The red-brown transfer print is decorated in green and yellow and entitled, \"The Hen in the Flower Garden\". In sound condition for a piece over 170 years old with no chips or cracks. There in wear to the rim, all over crazing with some resulting discoloration.

PROCLAIMED JUNE 28 1830\n\n.\n\nCROWNED WITH THEIR / PEOPLES LOVE / GUARDED BY A / NATIONS LOYALTY / HALLOWED BY / THEIR COUNTRY'S BLESSING. Crown with rays below first line; sprays of rose, thistle and shamrock above last line.\n\nDocument 79952\n\nQUEEN ADELAIDE. AQS: \"A Reg\" as Queen of England, 1p, 3½x4¼, mounted to a page of similar size. In full: \"Commit thy way unto/the Lord, trust also/in Him and he shall/bring it to pass\". Headed \"Ps XXXVII.5\" indicating it is a biblical quote from Psalms 37:5. Adelaide (1792-1849) and William, Duke of Clarence, third son of King George III, were married on July 11, 1818. In 1830, upon the death of his brother, King George IV, William became King William IV and his wife became Queen Adelaide. They had seven children (including twin girls), but five were stillborn, and the other two died before reaching the age of two. When King William IV died in 1837, his niece succeeded him on the British throne as Queen Victoria. Soiled. Lightly creased from mounting.\n\nCorrection: they had twin boys, not girls.\n\n. . .\n\nThe State Diadem\n\nThis fantastic piece of jewellery, made in diamonds and pearls, was executed on the orders of King George IV and was it possibly worn by him at his coronation, over a large plumed hat. Some sources, nevertheless, say the King never wore it, for the diadem was judged too feminine. The circular diadem is decorated with four crosses-pattées, set with diamonds, representing St. George, the front one with a wonderful honey-coloured diamond in the centre. The four bouquets of flowers in diamonds include roses, thistles and shamrocks, representing England, Scotland and Ireland. Wales, being a principality, was not represented. Below, two rows of pearls with diamonds in the middle make it one of the finest pieces of jewellery of the royal collection. It is part of the Crown Jewels since the death of HM Queen Victoria, who left it to the Crown in her will. The diadem was never used by a male royal again, only by queens, consorts and regnant, from Queen Adelaide to Queen Elizabeth II.\n\npics courtesy: http://www.angelfire.com/realm2/coronation/dress.html\n\nSome details of the State Diadem.\n\nLarge Dining Room - Government House, Adelaide, South Australia\n\nThe Large Dining Room was added during the second stage of construction. Up to twenty eight people may be seated for dinner. Formal dinners of about this number are held regularly. Note portrait of Queen Adelaide on right.\n\n[FONT=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif][SIZE=-1]The portraits in this room are of King William IV and Queen Adelaide. The portrait of William IV was listed in the 1868 inventory. Three cedar serving tables of four shelves grace the room. [/SIZE][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif][SIZE=-1]The dining table is of mahogany and is dated 1850-1900. The chairs are in a semi balloon-back style. [/SIZE][/FONT]\n\npic courtesy: http://www.governor.sa.gov.au/html/govhouse.html\n\nQueen Adelaide and Prince William, Duke of Clarence later King William IV were married at the same time in a double ceremony with William's brother Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Princess Victoire or Victoria, later Duchess of Kent, and Queen Victoria's mother.\n\nJudiciously, in the circumstances, neither of the brides was in her first youth, the future Queen Adelaide having been, at twenty-six, the younger of the two. The Duchess of Kent, a little over thirty, had been already married, in 1803, when she was seventeen, to Prince Emich Charles of Leiningen. Eleven years afterwards, in 1814, she was left a widow with a son and daughter. Four years later she married the Duke of Kent. The brides were very different in looks and outward attractions. The Duchess of Clarence, with hair of a peculiar colour approaching to a lemon tint, weak eyes, and a bad complexion, was plain. She was also quiet, reserved, and a little stiff, while she appears to have had no special accomplishments, beyond a great capacity for carpet-work. The Duchess of Kent, with a fine figure, good features, brown hair and eyes, a pretty pink colour, winning manners, and graceful accomplishments—particularly music, formed a handsome, agreeable woman, “altogether most charming and attractive.”\n\nBut both Duchesses were possessed of qualities in comparison with which beauty is deceitful and favour is vain—qualities which are calculated to wear well. Queen Adelaide's goodness and kindness, her unselfish, unassuming womanliness and devout resignation to sorrow and suffering, did more than gain and keep the heart of her bluff, eccentric sailor-prince. They secured for her the respectful regard of the nation among whom she dwelt, whether as Queen or Queen-dowager. The Archbishop of Canterbury could say of her, after her husband's death, “For three weeks prior to his (King William's) dissolution, the Queen sat by his bedside, performing for him every office which a sick man could require, and depriving herself of all manner of rest and refection. She underwent labours which I thought no ordinary woman could endure. No language can do justice to the meekness and to the calmness of mind which she sought to keep up before the King, while sorrow was pressing on her heart. Such constancy of affection, I think, was one of the most interesting spectacles that could be presented to a mind desirous of being gratified with the sight of human excellence.” [Footnote: Dr. Doran] Such graces, great enough to resist the temptations of the highest rank, might well be singled out as worthy of all imitation."
