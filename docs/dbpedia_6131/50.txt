Galaxis has carved out its name as a powerhouse in the web3 industry, known for fueling community projects with its cutting-edge blockchain-powered membership technology. High-profile collaborations with icons like Mike Tyson and Steve Aoki and partnerships with colossal entities such as the NBA have showcased the platform’s capacity to redefine the meaning of decentralized communities. Illustrating their success, Galaxis has impressively sold over 225,000 NFTs and facilitated the generation of more than 32,000 ETH on secondary markets. And now, Galaxis is releasing a unique web3 product that will drive things even further: Galaxis Engines.

What is Galaxis Building?

Galaxis is redefining the digital collectibles space with its decentralized no-code platform. Essentially, the platform transforms how digital communities are built and interacted with. At its core, Galaxis enables users to monetize creativity through a unique ecosystem where Web3 projects, artists, athletes, and companies of all forms and sizes can launch their own membership cards (NFTs), which go beyond traditional digital assets.

These membership cards are not only versatile but also can be upgraded with unique and dynamic traits and gamification elements, offering a wide range of utilities to their holders. They are accessible through various means, including winning, complementary distribution, direct purchase from creators, or buying on the open market. This flexibility in acquisition is matched by the platform’s ability to deploy complex collections rapidly. Creators can launch their fully on-chain collections in less than two hours, a process that would normally take days or weeks, thanks to advanced features like traits.

Now, Galaxis is taking a giant leap forward with the introduction of Galaxis Engines, signaling the start of the public launch of their platform.

Galaxis Engines Driving the Decentralized Communities

The Galaxis Engines are not just a new platform feature; they are the very core of what makes the platform tick. They function as a decentralized backbone, empowering users to earn the platform’s token, $GLX while mining and distributing essential Launch Keys.

These keys enable creators to unlock the full suite of platform capabilities.

Once the engine is activated upon purchase, it starts generating incentives. These come in the form of $GLX. With these tokens, users can trade, stake, or participate in the myriad activities the Galaxis platform offers. A daily pool of 1,600,000 $GLX + 400,000$ additional rewards pool is reserved for Engines Holders.

Launch Keys

A unique feature of the Galaxis Engines is its ability to generate Launch Keys. These keys allow creators to unlock platform features and launch their communities. The model is envisioned to support creators, Engines Operators, and the whole ecosystem.

Engines Upgrades & Rewards Pool

Besides the regular daily $GLX incentive pool there is a reward pool that can be unlocked through traits, these traits can be earned through active participation in the Galaxis community. By staying engaged and informed, you can learn how to augment your engine with these various traits. Each trait is designed to enhance the Galaxis Engines functionality and your overall experience on the platform.

Moreover, the additional traits that can be picked up from the Vaults go beyond mere cosmetic upgrades. Some can offer boosts, optimizing the earning potential of your share of the $GLX rewards pool, while others may introduce platform tweaks that refine your experience and interaction with the system.

It’s important to note that these enhancements aren’t passive bonuses; they require your active involvement. Keeping up with the latest platform updates, participating in community events, and contributing to the ecosystem’s growth are all part of the journey to maximizing the potential of your Galaxis Engines. Through this dynamic engagement, you become a driving force in the evolution of Galaxis, paving the way for a richer and more rewarding community experience.
