This IDO reflects Bybit Web3’s brand, which is all about providing users with a better way to access Web3 and consequently a more open and accessible Web3 ecosystem.\n\nGalaxis is a decentralized application that allows developers to develop and experience virtual spaces, thus forming societies that exist in the digital space. Galaxis’ no-code tools will be available not only to business owners, developers, and content creators, but also to any individual trying to succeed and thrive online.\n\nEmily Bao, who is among the many campaigners of Bybit, stated:\n\n“At Bybit, we are firm believers in the transformative potential of Web3. By supporting visionary projects like Galaxis, we contribute to building a more connected and empowered future for blockchain communities. The Galaxis IDO aligns perfectly with our vision of fostering a thriving Web3 ecosystem that’s simpler, open, and equal for all.”\n\nThe subscription round is scheduled to be implemented starting from May 3rd and lasting until May 7th, 2024. Through this activity, users have to maintain a holding of a minimum of 300 USDC (Ethereum Chain) on their Bybit Wallet. The Bybit IDO offers 60,060,060 GALAXIS tokens, with up to 2,000 competition winners being the maximum allowed.\n\nBybit Web3 provides a bundle of DeFi products that anyone can access, including wallets, exchanges, and platforms where everything is well-structured and uncomplicated. By utilizing the Bybit blockchain with a strong security record and experience of servicing over 25 million users worldwide, Bybit Web3 turns the trust of its users toward a new sphere of enabling technology.\n\nIt is through this IDO that Bybit Web3 demonstrates its willingness to embrace more innovation and growth within the Web3 sphere."
