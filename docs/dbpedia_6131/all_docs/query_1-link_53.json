Along the journey, partnerships with high-profile individuals like DJ Steve Aoki, actor Val Kilmer, and NBA personality LaMelo Ball have been established. Over the past few years, more than 225,000 NFTs have been sold, generating over 32,000 ETH ($100 million) in secondary sales of NFTs. Now, the focus is on mass distribution.\n\nCEO and co-founder Andras Kristof, who also installed the first Bitcoin ATMs in Singapore, shares some exciting news: \"The next step includes supercharging the ecosystem with our $1M dollar Creator Grants programs, the CoinMarketCap Incubation, and many other exciting opportunities where both creators and members get paid. All this is happening on the Galaxis Platform, which is launching soon.‚Äù Galaxis, as a post-hype NFT utility platform, believes that this new technology will transcend the hype and bring real value to all industries beyond Web3.\n\nCommunity creators can launch their membership card NFT collections without coding knowledge.\n\nIncubated by CoinMarketCap, Galaxis enables individuals or brands with a community to create engagement and incentive mechanisms for their communities through NFTs. With a built-in economy, the need for any third-party engagement tools is eliminated. For more information, refer to the official channels of Galaxis and Bybit. Stay tuned for more updates.\n\nAbout Galaxis\n\nGalaxis is a groundbreaking platform designed to empower creators and brands in the ever-evolving Web3 ecosystem. Leveraging the latest in blockchain technology, Galaxis provides a suite of tools and services to create, manage, and sell dynamic NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) with utility.
