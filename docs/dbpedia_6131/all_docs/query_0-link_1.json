Kyla (Richard Moll) tries to find the object and use its inherent energy to increase his villainous sphere of influence. He successfully obtains the device after defeating its protectors on Sintaria. Meanwhile, Ladera (Brigitte Nielsen), a freedom fighter with the ability of invisibility, makes her way to Earth to seek out a sister gem to stalemate Kyla and prevent him from obtaining the object. Once there, she discovers Jed (John H. Brennan) has already retrieved the object from its secure location. However, Victor Menendez (Fred Asparagus) and his mercenaries also wish to own the device as recompense for monies Jed owes them. After dispatching Victor and his minions, Ladera bands together with Jed to seek out the first gem and thwart Kyla's plans.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nBrigitte Nielsen as Ladera\n\nRichard Moll as Kyla\n\nJohn H.
