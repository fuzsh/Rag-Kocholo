        "text": "The owner of the Galaxy Leader car carrier that was seized by Iran-backed Houthi’s in Yemen is calling from immediate release of its 25 crew members after new video the ship surfaced.\n\nThe Galaxy Leader, a Bermuda-flagged car carrier chartered by Japanese shipping company NYK, was illegally boarded by armed assailants via helicopter on November 19 as it transited the Red Sea. The ship, which reportedly has ties to an Israeli businessman, has been taken to the Hodeidah port area in Yemen, where it remains at anchor.\n\nVideo released by Hamas this week allegedly shows the Commander of Yemeni Navy speaking to crew members on the bridge of the ship.\n\nGalaxy Maritime Ltd, the Isle of Man-based registered owner of the Galaxy Leader, notes that the video footage appears to show all crew members seem to be well and remain on board the vessel.\n\n“Owners and Managers state that the welfare and immediate release of the crew comprising 17 Filipino nationals, 2 Bulgarians, 3 Ukrainians, 2 Mexicans and 1 Romanian citizen, remains the priority,” Galaxy Maritime said in a statement.\n\nAdditional video shows militants dancing on the deck of the ship. Another shows the ship adorned with the Palestinian and Yemeni flags.\n\n“Families are being kept informed of the situation and every effort is being made through all possible channels to secure the immediate release of crew and vessel, including through the various Embassies and authorities involved of those being held. Owners and managers will refrain from commenting on operational matters at this time,” Galaxy Maritime said."
