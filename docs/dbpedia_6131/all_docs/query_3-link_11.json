        "text": "MISP galaxy is a simple method to express a large object called cluster that can be attached to MISP events or attributes. A cluster can be composed of one or more elements. Elements are expressed as key-values. There are default knowledge base (such as Threat Actors, Tools, Ransomware, ATT&CK matrixes) available in MISP galaxy but those can be overwritten, replaced, updated, forked and shared as you wish.\n\nExisting clusters and vocabularies can be used as-is or as a common knowledge base. MISP distribution can be applied to each cluster to permit a limited or broader distribution scheme.\n\nGalaxies can be also used to expressed existing matrix-like standards such as MITRE ATT&CK(tm) or custom ones.\n\nThe objective is to have a comment set of clusters for organizations starting analysis but that can be expanded to localized information (which is not shared) or additional information (that can be shared).\n\n360.net Threat Actors - Known or estimated adversary groups as identified by 360.net.\n\nCategory: actor - source: https://apt.360.net/aptlist - total: 42 elements\n\n[HTML] - [JSON]\n\nAmmunitions - Common ammunitions galaxy\n\nCategory: firearm - source: https://ammo.com/ - total: 409 elements\n\n[HTML] - [JSON]\n\nAndroid - Android malware galaxy based on multiple open sources.\n\nCategory: tool - source: Open Sources - total: 433 elements\n\n[HTML] - [JSON]\n\nAzure Threat Research Matrix - The purpose of the Azure Threat Research Matrix (ATRM) is to educate readers on the potential of Azure-based tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

Malicious threat actors use domain names, their corresponding technical resources, and other parts of the DNS infrastructure, including its protocols, for their malicious cyber operations. CERTs are confronted with reported DNS abuse on a continuous basis, and rely heavily on DNS analysis and infrastructure to protect their constituencies. Understanding the international customary norms applicable for detecting and mitigating DNS abuse from the perspective of the global incident response community is critical for the open Internet’s stability, security and resiliency.
