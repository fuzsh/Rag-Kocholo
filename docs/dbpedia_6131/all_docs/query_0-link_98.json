        "text": "Bybit, a prominent player in the global cryptocurrency exchange arena, has announced the launch of an initial DEX offering (IDO) for Galaxis on its cutting-edge Web3 platform.\n\nRevolutionizing Fundraising with IDO\n\nUnlike traditional initial coin offerings (ICOs), IDOs leverage decentralized exchanges (DEXes) for fundraising. By listing tokens directly on DEXes, IDOs offer a decentralized approach to fundraising, enabling broader participation. Participants contribute liquidity to the pool and receive new tokens in return.\n\nSubscription Period Details\n\nThe IDO subscription period commenced on May 3 and will run until May 7, as confirmed by Bybit, which ranks among the top three cryptocurrency exchanges by daily trading volume. Following this, a snap period will ensue for three days before the official reveal, purchase, and listing scheduled for May 10.\n\nKey Features of Galaxis Token\n\nThe new token, Galaxis, will debut with the ticker symbol ‘GALAXIS,’ replacing the previous symbol ‘GLX.’ The total token supply will be limited to ten billion tokens.\n\nParticipation Requirements\n\nTo participate in the IDO, users must maintain a Bybit wallet with a minimum balance of 300 USDC (on the Ethereum chain) throughout the snapshot period. Subaccounts are ineligible for participation. The IDO will accommodate a maximum of 2,000 winners. Upon receiving the tokens, participants can redeem them, albeit bearing the blockchain gas fees themselves.\n\nAligning Vision with Web3\n\nEmily Bao, Bybit Web evangelist, emphasized the alignment of Galaxis’s vision with the ethos of Web3. She underscored Bybit’s commitment to nurturing a thriving Web3 ecosystem by supporting innovative projects like Galaxis, aiming to foster connectivity and empowerment within blockchain communities.\n\nExploring Galaxis’s Features\n\nGalaxis stands as a no-code Web3 platform empowering users to create personalized membership cards and develop and monetize communities, products, or services. Noteworthy features include an NFT platform enabling users to issue their own tokens and an integrated marketplace facilitating token and card trading.\n\nUnleashing Gaming Potential\n\nRecognizing gaming as a cornerstone application within the blockchain sector, Galaxis offers users the opportunity to engage in online tournaments, including multiplayer games. Moreover, users can transform their membership cards into instant collective gaming experiences, underscoring the platform’s commitment to innovation and user engagement.\n\nConclusion: Driving Web3 Innovation\n\nIn conclusion, Bybit’s collaboration with Galaxis represents a significant milestone in the evolution of Web3 innovation. Through the Galaxis IDO, both entities aim to usher in a new era of decentralized finance, characterized by accessibility, inclusivity, and innovation, ultimately contributing to the advancement of the broader blockchain ecosystem."
