It's a mash of all the known aliens across the galaxy and universe, and serves as a space port for the aliens and humans. Prime is the current Circleman of Galaxis.\n\nInformation[]\n\nWith Karateka to the north and Hero Square to the east, Galaxis is located to an edge of the entire island of the Imagine Nation.\n\nWith the most futuristic and geometric buildings, Galaxis houses all types of aliens from across the universe. A space port, it also serves for humans and aliens that come and leave the planet, and functions a lot as a facility for new aliens that want to form an alliance with Earth through the Imagine Nation.\n\nFeatures[]\n\nValorian Garrison[]\n\nHome to the remaining Valorians of the galaxy, including Prime and Allegra, the Valorian Garrison is, in many ways, also the capital of Galaxis, since this is were Prime lives. Most of the visiting aliens come from time to time here for business with the Circleman.\n\nSpace Port[]\n\nThe only place in the entire Imagine Nation where humans can actually leave from the planet, it's a hub for aliens and humans alike to arrive on Earth as well as leave it. All kinds of space ships, no matter the shape and size, land and take off from here. Even ship fighters are stationed here when the Earth is in danger and allies come to help.\n\nTrivia[]"
