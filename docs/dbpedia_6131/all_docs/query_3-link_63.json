        "text": "I received my Gear S3 Frontier the Christmas holiday of 2018. Iâve loved and enjoyed it first moment I received it. Personally I wouldâve gone with what was most popular at that time if Iâd purchased myself (fitbit/Apple Watch etc). But it was a gift from my spouse who is one who searches and reads reviews and ratings before making a section on any purchase. About 3 weeks ago I began trying to complete the newest update. After so many unsuccessful attempts of updating I gave up and finally a couple days ago was able to complete the update successfully. I can see the difference in the look of the icons and colors on the screen. Iâm not tech savvy therefore I donât know what this new update, now with Bixby, means. Sounds like something I could really care less about. I pretty much only use it for its step count & health app and making calls here and there. Seeing as though I have an iPhone I canât respond to messages but I can receive my texts and iMessages on my watch. I have noticed my battery life doesnât last nearly as long. Even on the off days of working out, my battery life is at about 50% around noon and I still have a full day ahead almost. Seeing as though I charge it until itâs completely charged and only use my watch the most when Iâm active my battery life should last longer it seems. Please help me figure out why my battery life is so much less since Iâve updated. Thank you!\n\nI read a lot of reviews about compatibility with iPhone before getting my Galaxy Watch (standalone version from T-Mobile). Everything I found said I would lose a lot of functionality because iOS did not play well with Samsung products. Iâm happy to report that I can make and receive calls and texts without issue, even if I turn my iPhone off and leave it at home (reviews all said I would not be able to reply to texts from my watch). Almost everything seems to work without issue with the major exception of Samsung Pay. Iâve paired my watch with a Samsung phone, and I must admit this is a function I will really miss as I donât like carrying a phone and wallet when I work out. Apple Pay wonât work on the watch either, for obvious reasons. One other thing that is not working on my watch (which worked when paired to a Samsung phone) is the voice to text feature. I think it worked when I first linked the iPhone, but itâs stopped working. This is a feature I hope can be fixed since itâs difficult to type out even short texts on the little screen.\n\nI received a response from my earlier reviews a few days after I left the review. I had already fixed by deleting the app from my iPhone and doing a factory reset. This fresh install made everything start working again however I did lose all my watch faces that are not showing available any longer. I give a 5 star now because I love the fact that they responded and it works.\n\nEarlier review: I have had the watch for about 6 months and about a month in the raise hand gesture to wake quit working. I have it turned on in settings. I just did update where one of the changes is touch screen to wake and that doesnât work either. Also about a month in the notifications of incoming calls and messages quit working. I get no sound or vibrations. I made sure theatre mode, do not disturb are not on. I have notifications turned on for the galaxy watch and messages. I have an iPhone 8 Plus and all software is up to date on both. I love the styling of the galaxy watch plus the personalization available over the Apple Watch but not happy with the issues Iâm having. I can take a call and read messages when I see it is coming in on my phone. I used the Galaxy iOS app to ask for help several months ago but never got a response. I canât find a number to call for text support."
