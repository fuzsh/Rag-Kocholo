        "text": "Samsung has been connected to the Olympics for years and Paris 2024 looks like it’s the company’s Personal Best. For a start, it designed a stunningly beautiful special-edition Galaxy Z Flip6 which was hand-delivered to every athlete. The special version had a gold edging (well, it was never going to be bronze, was it?) and unique logo. But it’s the way it got involved in the Opening Ceremony which stands out.\n\nForbesSamsung Galaxy Fold6 To Hidden Speakers: Secrets Of The Samsung Design Studio\n\nAs you’ll know by now, the ceremony was different from any other one in the history of the Olympics. Instead of basing it just in a stadium, this year, it was based around the Seine which flows through Paris, to show off the city in a whole new way, from a bridge which sprang to life in a vibrant tricolore of smoke, to a huge metal horse that sped down the water.\n\nBut filming across Paris brought a unique challenge, and Samsung’s response was designed to bring fans closer than ever.\n\nThe company took around 250 of its flagship phones, the Galaxy S24 Ultra, and paced them strategically along the route, including on some of the 85 boats that carried the 10,500 athletes down the river.\n\nOutside broadcasts are always high-tension affairs, but the extra coverage coming from the content picked up by the phones helped ensure extra footage, recorded in high resolution and broadcast over 5G, was available.\n\nThe phones were tiny enough to be unobtrusive to fans watching on the banks of the Seine, and discreet enough to ensure the athletes weren’t intimidated as they might have been by full-size broadcast cameras.\n\nOh, and they had another benefit: they are waterproof. Even if you didn’t watch the Olympics, you are likely to know one thing about them: the rain tipped down continuously from beginning to end, almost. While this meant that some of the riverside screens seemed to struggle at times, Samsung’s phones were blissfully unaware of the rain dousing the spectators.\n\nIt's not like this was a fly-by-night operation: the company claims that 360 days of testing went in to ensuring the phones could deliver great content.\n\nPerhaps the Olympics have driven sales of Samsung’s products. James Kitto, the VP and Head of Samsung’s Mobile Division, U.K. and Ireland, said, “For our new wearable offerings, which includes the Galaxy Watch Ultra, in the UK we’re seeing an increase in demand year-on-year, up 37%; with health and wellness top of people’s mind as we find ourselves mid-way through the summer of sports with the start Olympic and Paralympic Games well underway.”\n\nKitto also said that the company has seen a “positive start” to sales of its most intimate new device, the Galaxy Ring, and that the latest large folding phone, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 has “jumped in popularity by 15%.”\n\nThe company says it will also use the same network and hardware to stream the sailing competitions in Marseille, with a handset installed on every competing boat.\n\nLaunching new products just days before the Olympics is a gift for any company, and Samsung has made the most of the opportunity with flair."
