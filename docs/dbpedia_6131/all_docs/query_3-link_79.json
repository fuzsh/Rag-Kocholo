        "text": "In Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, 42 is the number from which all meaning (\"the meaning of life, the universe, and everything\") can be derived. However, its actual significance is open to interpretation.\n\nA BBC News radio script based on Adams' book introduces this concept with the following lines:\n\nA caveman lays out the following sentence in Scrabble stones: \"What do you get if you multiply six by nine?\"\n\nArthur: \"Six by nine? Forty-two? You know, I've always felt that there was something fundamentally wrong with the Universe.\"\n\nA faint and distant voice then says: \"Base thirteen!\"\n\nWhat is base 13 and how is it related to the number 42?\n\nBase 13 (otherwise known as a tri-decimal or tre-decimal) is a positional number system that holds 13 as its base. It uses 13 digits to represent numbers.\n\nDigits for base 13 include 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, X, E and T or 0-9, A, B and C. It should be known however that Base 13 is not used in any practical situation.\n\nThe number 42 is not a particularly significant number in base 13. However, in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, 42 is Deep Thought's answer to \"the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.\" Deep Thought is a fictional supercomputer built for that very purpose in the book.\n\nIn this case, instead of representing a physical object, the number 42 is the actual answer to the question, \"What is the meaning of life?\"\n\nIn some Spanish-speaking countries, there is a phrase that goes, \"42 es la respuesta a la pregunta final\" or \"42 is the answer to the final question.\"\n\nThis has led many to search for representations of the number 42 in order to unearth any hidden meaning the number might possess. Others have dismissed it as making no sense whatsoever.\n\nWhere else does 42 appear?\n\nWhile we can do little more than speculate, many have noted significant representations of the number 42 outside of the Guide to the Galaxy that may (or may not) shed further light on the meaning of life.\n\n42 in binary code\n\nWhile it may not be significant to base 13, the number 42 is a significant number in binary code, where it is represented as 101010. This particular pattern of zeros and ones appears often in mathematical and computer-related contexts.\n\n42 in Buddhism and Hinduism\n\nThe number 42 is also significant in some Eastern religions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism where many believe a person reaches Nirvana or Moksha, which is the final goal of life, around age 42. Of course, there is no actual set age for this experience.\n\n42 in Christianity\n\nThere are also many mentions of the number 42 in the Bible. In the Book of Revelation, for example, the number 42 is associated with the 42 months that the Antichrist will rule over the world. In another instance, 42 is the number of generations from Abraham to Jesus Christ.\n\n42 and the angle of a rainbow\n\nThe angle at which light reflects off water to create a rainbow is 42 degrees.\n\n42 and the speed of light crossing a proton\n\nTwo physical constants in the universe are the speed of light and the diameter of a proton. It takes light 10 to the minus 42nd power seconds to cross the diameter of a proton.\n\n42 and the asterisk symbol\n\nForty-two is the ASCII code for the symbol * also known as the asterisk. This symbol is often thought to translate to anything or everything. In this instance, 42 = everything, the meaning of life.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that all these 42s are base 10, not base 13, so their relation to one another is still vague at best."
