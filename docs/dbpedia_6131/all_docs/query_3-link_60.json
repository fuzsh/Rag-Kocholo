        "text": "Below is a massive list of galaxy words - that is, words related to galaxy. The top 4 are: star, universe, nebula and nova. You can get the definition(s) of a word in the list below by tapping the question-mark icon next to it. The words at the top of the list are the ones most associated with galaxy, and as you go down the relatedness becomes more slight. By default, the words are sorted by relevance/relatedness, but you can also get the most common galaxy terms by using the menu below, and there's also the option to sort the words alphabetically so you can get galaxy words starting with a particular letter. You can also filter the word list so it only shows words that are also related to another word of your choosing. So for example, you could enter \"star\" and click \"filter\", and it'd give you words that are related to galaxy and star.\n\nYou can highlight the terms by the frequency with which they occur in the written English language using the menu below. The frequency data is extracted from the English Wikipedia corpus, and updated regularly. If you just care about the words' direct semantic similarity to galaxy, then there's probably no need for this.\n\nThere are already a bunch of websites on the net that help you find synonyms for various words, but only a handful that help you find related, or even loosely associated words. So although you might see some synonyms of galaxy in the list below, many of the words below will have other relationships with galaxy - you could see a word with the exact opposite meaning in the word list, for example. So it's the sort of list that would be useful for helping you build a galaxy vocabulary list, or just a general galaxy word list for whatever purpose, but it's not necessarily going to be useful if you're looking for words that mean the same thing as galaxy (though it still might be handy for that).\n\nIf you're looking for names related to galaxy (e.g. business names, or pet names), this page might help you come up with ideas. The results below obviously aren't all going to be applicable for the actual name of your pet/blog/startup/etc., but hopefully they get your mind working and help you see the links between various concepts. If your pet/blog/etc. has something to do with galaxy, then it's obviously a good idea to use concepts or words to do with galaxy."
