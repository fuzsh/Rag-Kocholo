        "text": "Andrea Cimatti, Università di Bologna\n\nAndrea Cimatti is full Professor of Astrophysics at the Università di Bologna. He has worked in Germany, the USA, and Italy at the INAF Arcetri Astrophysical Observatory. His research uses the largest telescopes in space and on Earth to study galaxies and cosmology. He is one of the founders of ESA's Euclid space mission. He is a recipient of the Bessel Prize of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, among others. He teaches courses on fundamental astronomy and on galaxy formation and evolution. He has published key papers based on observational studies of distant galaxies.\n\nFilippo Fraternali, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands\n\nFilippo Fraternali is Associate Professor of Gas Dynamics and Evolution of Galaxies at the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute of the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, The Netherlands. He obtained his Ph.D. from the Università di Bologna, where he was an assistant professor between 2006 and 2017. He did postdoctoral research in the Netherlands and was a Marie-Curie fellow at the University of Oxford. He has published extensively on various topics of galaxy formation and evolution.\n\nCarlo Nipoti, Università di Bologna\n\nCarlo Nipoti is Associate Professor of Astrophysics at the Università di Bologna, where he received his Ph.D. in Astronomy, and he was a temporary lecturer of Theoretical Physics at the University of Oxford. He teaches courses on the physics of galaxies and on the dynamics of astrophysical systems at undergraduate and graduate levels. His research is in the field of theoretical astrophysics with special interest in the formation, evolution and dynamics of galaxies, on which he is author of valuable papers."
