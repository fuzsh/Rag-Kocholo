        "text": "Additional reading from www.astronomynotes.com\n\nClusters of Galaxies\n\nWhen we studied stars, we discovered that they were found in specific groupings that you might see as analogous to how people populate communities on Earth. For example, we see star clusters, which are in some ways like \"cities\" filled with about half a million stars. We also find stars in groupings of billions of stars inside of galaxies, so you might consider galaxies to be similar to \"countries\" of stars, although no country on Earth has 100 billion people!\n\nNow that we are studying galaxies, we can use observations of the environment around the Milky Way to inform us of the types of communities in which galaxies are found.\n\nThe Local Group\n\nIf we survey the local universe around the Milky Way, we find that there are a few dozen galaxies in our neighborhood. More specifically, we define our “group” to include those galaxies that we believe to be mutually bound to each other by the force of gravity. Collectively, we refer to this group of galaxies that includes the Milky Way as the Local Group of galaxies. The Local Group contains only a few large galaxies, all of which are spiral galaxies. These are the Milky Way, Andromeda (M31) and M33, which is also called the Triangulum Galaxy.\n\nMost of the rest of the Local Group members are different types of dwarf galaxies. There are irregular galaxies, like the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), there are dwarf elliptical galaxies like M32, which is a satellite of Andromeda, and there are dwarf spheroidal galaxies like Sculptor, Fornax, and Ursa Minor (named after the constellations in which they are found). For the most part, though, these objects are all much smaller and less massive than the Milky Way and Andromeda. If we compare the galaxies by their luminosities, for example, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 1/10th as bright as the Milky Way, which suggests that it has about 10% of the mass of the Milky Way. Some of the smallest dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group are as faint as 1/50,000th the brightness of the Milky Way. Therefore, even though the dwarf galaxies are dominant in number in the Local Group, the three spirals dominate the mass of the Local Group. This is common in most environments. There are a range of galaxy sizes and masses, and there are fewer of the most massive galaxies and many more of the dwarf galaxies.\n\nThe galaxies of the Local Group are distributed within a volume of about 1 Megaparsec (Mpc) in radius. The volume of a sphere with a radius of 1 Mpc is about 4 cubic Mpc. This means that there are about 10 galaxies per cubic Mpc in the Local Group.\n\nIf you move outward from the Local Group, you encounter several other groups that are superficially similar to our own. M81 and M82 are two of the largest members of their group about 4 Mpc away from us, which also includes a total of about two dozen known galaxies. Centaurus A is a member of the M83 group, which is about 5 Mpc away. The Local Group, the M81 group, and the M83 group are examples of what are generally called “loose groups,” which are just what they sound like: bound groups of galaxies that are not very densely packed together.\n\nYou have already seen images of the Milky Way Galaxy from the Digital Universe Atlas, where the disk of the Milky Way was represented as a flat image, and the dark matter halo of the Milky Way was represented with a wire frame sphere. Below is a short movie, captured from the Digital Universe Atlas, showing the point of view of an observer flying around the Milky Way. The green dots that you see represent the 3D positions of the galaxies in the Local Group. In this view, you see primarily the satellites of the Milky Way (e.g., Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, Sculptor) because Andromeda, M33, and their satellites are more distant (in fact, they are the dense group of green dots you see at the edge of the field of view of the movie)."
