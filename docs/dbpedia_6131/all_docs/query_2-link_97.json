        "text": "James Webb Space Telescope spots earliest-known galaxy: What a new study says\n\nSub : Science and tech\n\nSec: Space sector\n\nContext:\n\nNASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spotted the earliest-known galaxy called as JADES-GS-z14-0.\n\nMore on news:\n\nJWST, which by peering across vast cosmic distances is looking way back in time, observed the galaxy as it existed about 290 million years after the Big Bang event that initiated the universe roughly 13.8 billion years ago.\n\nThis period spanning the universe’s first few hundred million years is called cosmic dawn.\n\nWhat do we know about the galaxy?\n\nThis galaxy, called JADES-GS-z14-0, measures about 1,700-light years across.\n\nA light year is the distance light travels in a year, which is 9.5 trillion km.\n\nThe galaxy has a mass equivalent to 500 million stars the size of our Sun and is rapidly forming new stars – about 20 every year.\n\nUntil now, the earliest-known galaxy dated to about 320 million years after the Big Bang, as announced by the JADES team last year.\n\nThe JADES team in the same study disclosed the discovery of the second oldest-known galaxy, from about 303 million years post-Big Bang.\n\nWhy is the galaxy so bright?\n\nHypotheses that have been advanced to explain the luminosity of early galaxies are as follows:\n\nThe first attributed it to supermassive black holes in these galaxies gobbling up material.\n\nThese galaxies are populated by more stars than expected or by stars that are brighter than those around today.\n\nAbout James Webb Space Telescope (JWST):"
