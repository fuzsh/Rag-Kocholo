        "text": "A galaxy is a system of millions of stars consisting of gas and dust, bound by gravitational force. The sun is one of the stars in the galaxy. Our galaxy is known as the milky way. It appears as a milky band of light in the sky, hence the name. The shapes and sizes of galaxies differ, and the milky way is a large barred spiral galaxy. There are approximately 70,000 million stars in the universe. The Hubble space telescope, launched in 1990, discovered more than 10,000 galaxies by observing a small part of space for 12 days.\n\nThe Milky Way’s central black hole, Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. The milky way has a diameter of at least 30,000 parsecs (100,000 ly) and is separated from the Andromeda Galaxy.\n\nNote: IC 1101 is the largest galaxy found in the universe.\n\nGalaxies rotate with respect to their centre. The space between galaxies is known as intergalactic space. Intergalactic space is almost close to an absolute vacuum.\n\nThere are four main types of galaxies:\n\nElliptical\n\nIrregular\n\nSpiral\n\nBarred spiral\n\nElliptical galaxy: These galaxies are roughly ellipsoidal with smooth and featureless images. Elliptical galaxies range from tens of millions to over one hundred trillion stars. Some examples of elliptical galaxies are NGC 5 (Andromeda), NGC 67 (Andromeda), NGC 71 (Andromeda), and PGC 1000714.\n\nIrregular galaxy: This galaxy does not have a distinct regular shape and is disordered in appearance, with neither a nuclear bulge nor with traces of spiral arm structure. Some examples of irregular galaxies are The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.\n\nSpiral galaxy: Spiral galaxies have a bar-like structure known as a barred spiral galaxy. Almost 77% of the galaxies observed are spiral galaxies. The Andromeda galaxy is an example of a spiral galaxy.\n\nBarred spiral galaxies: It is a spiral galaxy made of stars with a central bar-shaped structure. The milky way is a large barred spiral galaxy. Some examples of barred spiral galaxies are M58 (SBc), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC, Sm), and M61 (SABbc).\n\nImportant Galaxies Questions with Answers\n\n1. Our galaxy is known as the ____\n\nLarge Magellanic Cloud\n\nAndromeda\n\nMilky way\n\nSmall Magellanic Clouds\n\nAnswer: c) Milky way.\n\nExplanation: Our galaxy is known as the milky way. The milky way includes our solar system.\n\n2. Do galaxies rotate?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nAnswer: a) Yes\n\nExplanation: Galaxies do rotate with respect to their centre.\n\n3. The ____ instrument discovered more than 10,000 galaxies.\n\nAnswer: Hubble Space Telescope\n\nExplanation: Hubble Space Telescope is a large and versatile telescope used to observe celestial objects.\n\n4. More than two-thirds of all observed galaxies are _____\n\nBarred spiral\n\nIrregular\n\nSpiral galaxies\n\nElliptical\n\nAnswer: c) Spiral galaxies.\n\nExplanation: Almost all galaxies observed are spiral.\n\n5. Write three critical features of the milky way.\n\nThree key features of the milky way are:\n\nIt appears as the milky band of light in the sky.\n\nThe Milky Way galaxy is about 100,000 light-years across.\n\nIt is a Barred spiral galaxy.\n\n6. Match the following\n\nElliptical 1) Milky way\n\nIrregular 2) Andromeda\n\nSpiral 3) Small Magellanic Clouds\n\nBarred spiral 4) NGC 71\n\nOptions:\n\n1. a) 1, b) 2, c) 3, d) 4\n\n2. a) 4, b) 3, c) 2, d) 1\n\n3. a) 2, b) 1, c) 4, d) 3\n\n4. a) 4, b) 1, c) 2, d) 3\n\nAnswer: 2. a) 4, b) 3, c) 2, d) 1\n\n7. Define galaxy.\n\nA galaxy is a system of millions of stars consisting of gas and dust bound by gravitational force. Examples of galaxies include Andromeda and the Milky Way.\n\n8. M61 (SABbc) is which type of galaxy?\n\nBarred spiral\n\nIrregular\n\nSpiral galaxies\n\nElliptical\n\nAnswer: a) Barred spiral.\n\n9. The solar system is present in the milky way.\n\nTrue\n\nFalse\n\nAnswer: a) True\n\nExplanation: The milky way is present in the solar system.\n\n10. What is interstellar space?\n\nThe space between stars is known as interstellar space.\n\nPractice Questions\n\n1. Choose the Elliptical galaxy.\n\nMilky way\n\nSmall Magellanic Clouds\n\nAndromeda\n\nNGC 67\n\n2. Define intergalactic space.\n\n3. What are the main types of galaxies?\n\n4. ____ is the largest galaxy found in the universe.\n\n5. State true or false: Galaxies do not rotate.\n\nWatch the video below to know in detail about the star and celestial objects.\n\nStay tuned to BYJU’S to know more about various science and maths concepts, along with engaging videos for better understanding."
