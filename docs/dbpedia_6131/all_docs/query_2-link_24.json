        "text": "The Great Debate\n\nIn 1920, two prominent astronomers were invited by the National Academy of Sciences to discuss the size and shape of the Universe. One of them, Harlow Shapley, said that the entire Universe was contained within our galaxy, the Milky Way. The other, Heber Curtis, argued that the Milky Way was just one \"island universe\" among many. Three years later, using the largest telescope in the world at California's Mt. Wilson observatory, Edwin Hubble settled the matter. He showed that a fuzzy object in the sky was too far away to be part of our own galaxy and must be another, separate galaxy. This was the Andromeda galaxy, one of our closest galactic neighbors. Once the existence of another galaxy outside our own was proven, we had to accept that our galaxy was not the only oneâ€”we were just one of many that make up the Universe."
