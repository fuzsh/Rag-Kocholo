In the event of mild rain, raincoats and umbrellas are encouraged.\n\nIf the weather is colder than expected during your Galaxy Lights experience, the Space Center Houston Shop offers a variety of space-inspired cold-weather apparel for purchase that double as great souvenirs!\n\nIn the event of closure due to severe weather, guests can redeem their Galaxy Lights tickets on any other night of Galaxy Lights through January 5, 2025.\n\nCheck back later in the year for the ticket on-sale date for Galaxy Lights 2024!\n\nThe price of admission to Galaxy Lights varies by day, depending on peak attendance, but prices range from $19.95 to $27.95 for guests over 3 years of age.
