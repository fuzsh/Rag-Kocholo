        "text": "Earth may seem like a large place. People cannot easily cross the globe to explore different lands and sail from ocean to ocean. But zoom out past the atmosphere, and Earth soon begins to look small relative to the vastness of space and the many objects found in it.\n\nWithin the solar system, conventional units, such as miles or kilometers, can be used to describe distances. However, space is so expansive that it is not practical to use those units. The numbers would be too long! Instead, we use a light-year, or the distance that light travels in one year (about 5,880,000,000,000 miles or 9,460,000,000,000 kilometers). Several labels throughout the video show the viewer’s distance while traveling away from Earth using light-year units. For example, the label “Distance from Earth: 1 Light-Hour” appears at about 1:03, along with a view of several planets orbiting the Sun. That distance conveys that it takes 1 hour for the Sun’s light to reach that location. As the video continues, the viewer is taken beyond the orbiting planets of the solar system and through interstellar space to more than 10,000 light-years away from Earth.\n\nThe video at 1:23 shows the Sun’s true brightness compared with other stars within the galaxy that are visible from that location. Here, the Sun appears much larger and brighter than the other faraway stars, which look like tiny dots. As the distance continues to increase, the Sun appears smaller and less bright, until it fades from view at about 1:47.\n\nIn addition to the presence of space telescopes and probes (Voyager 1 being the farthest out; see 1:18 “The trajectories of our farthest spacecraft”), humans have created a footprint in space in the form of radio signals. The video at 1:54 shows a blue sphere that visually represents the limit of humanity’s strongest radio signals. The first radio signals strong enough to escape Earth’s atmosphere in the late-1930s have traveled fast and far, creating a radius of nearly 80 light-years. But even that distance, which is far beyond where our spacecraft have traveled, is a tiny fraction of the distance across the galaxy!\n\nFar outside our solar system but within the Milky Way, other stars with known planets come into view (1:58). Here, it becomes clear that our solar system is just one of countless star systems. Statistical estimates suggest that each star in our galaxy has an average of one planet. That would mean our galaxy has about 1 trillion planets! The first exoplanet was discovered from an observatory in France in 1995. From that point, the search for more extrasolar planets took off. More than 3,700 exoplanets have been discovered. NASA has a few space telescopes, like Kepler, constantly scanning patches of space for distant planets.\n\nAs students observe images and read about the journey from North America to the edge of the Milky Way, they can begin to form a mental map of Earth’s place in the galaxy. They will also be able to expand their U.S. address into a cosmic address."
