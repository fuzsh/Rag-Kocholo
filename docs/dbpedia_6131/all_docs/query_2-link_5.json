        "text": "Galaxies in the Universe\n\nThe lists of Known Galaxies in the Universe are discussed below:\n\n1. Andromeda\n\nIt is a spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years from Earth and the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. Its name stems from the area of the sky in which it appears the constellation of Andromeda.\n\nConstellation: Andromeda\n\n2. Black Eye Galaxy\n\nIt is a galaxy which was discovered by Edward Pigott in March 1779 and independently by Johann Elert Bode in April of the same year, as well as by Charles Messier in 1780. It has a spectacular dark band of absorbing dust in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus, giving rise to its nicknames of the \"Black Eye\" or \"Evil Eye\" galaxy.\n\nConstellation: Coma Berenices\n\n3. Bode's Galaxy\n\nIt is a spiral galaxy about 12 million light-years away, in the constellation Ursa Major. It was discovered by Johann Elert Bode on December 31, 1774.\n\nConstellation: Ursa Major\n\n4. Cartwheel Galaxy\n\nIt is a lenticular galaxy and ring galaxy about 500 million light-years away in the constellation Sculptor. It looks like a cartwheel that's why astronomers called it a 'Cartwheel'.\n\nConstellation: Sculptor\n\n5. Cigar Galaxy\n\nIt is a starburst galaxy approximately 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major.\n\nConstellation: Ursa Major\n\nTop 10 Nearest Star System to the Solar System\n\n6. Comet Galaxy\n\nIt is a spiral galaxy located 3.2 billion light-years from Earth, in the galaxy clusters Abell 2667, which was found with the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nConstellation: Sculptor\n\n7. Cosmos Redshift 7\n\nIt is a high-redshift Lyman-alpha emitter galaxy.\n\nConstellation: Sextans\n\n8. Hoag's Object\n\nIt is a non-typical galaxy of the type known as a ring galaxy. It is named after Arthur Hoag who discovered it in 1950 and identified it as either a planetary nebula or a peculiar galaxy with eight billion stars.\n\nConstellation: Serpens Caput\n\n9. Large Magellanic Cloud\n\nIt is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.\n\nConstellation: Dorado/Mensa\n\n10. Small Magellanic Cloud\n\nIt is a dwarf galaxy near the Milky Way. It is among the nearest intergalactic neighbours of the Milky Way and is one of the most distant objects visible to the naked eye.\n\nConstellation: Tucana\n\nTop 10 Most Dangerous Asteroids\n\n11. Mayall's Object\n\nIt is the result of two colliding galaxies located 500 million light-years away within the constellation of Ursa Major. It was discovered by American astronomer Nicholas U. Mayall of the Lick Observatory on 13 March 1940, using the Crossley reflector.\n\nConstellation: Ursa Major\n\n12. Milky Way\n\nIt is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. It appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610.\n\nConstellation: Sagittarius (centre)\n\n13. Pinwheel Galaxy\n\nIt is a face-on spiral galaxy distanced 21 million light-years away from the Earth and located in the constellation Ursa Major.\n\nConstellation: Ursa Major\n\n14. Sombrero Galaxy\n\nIt is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation Virgo.\n\nConstellation: Virgo\n\n15. Sunflower Galaxy\n\nIt is a spiral galaxy in the northern constellation of Canes Venatici. It was first discovered by the French astronomer Pierre MÃ©chain then later verified by his colleague Charles Messier on June 14, 1779.\n\nConstellation: Canes Venatici\n\n16. Tadpole Galaxy\n\nIt is a disrupted barred spiral galaxy located 420 million light-years from Earth in the northern constellation Draco.\n\nConstellation: Draco\n\n17. Whirlpool Galaxy\n\nIt is an interacting grand-design spiral galaxy with a Seyfert 2 active galactic nucleus located in the constellation Canes Venatici and was the first galaxy to be classified as a spiral galaxy.\n\nConstellation: Canes Venatici"
