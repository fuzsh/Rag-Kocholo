Van Vogt, A[lfred] E[lton]. THE WORLD OF NULL-A. New York: Ace Books, Inc., [1964]. Small octavo, pictorial wrappers. Second Ace edition. Ace Books F295. "A space-operatic mystery story in its author's best vein, with a hero who seemingly can die and be reborn endlessly (thanks to his 'non-Aristotelian' mental powers). It's dreadful old garbage by any reasonable critical standard, and yet it has a dreamlike conviction which has endeared it to generations of readers. The works of van Vogt, which have provided so much escapist joy, are among the great embarrassments of modern SF." - Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, second edition (1995), p. 427. Anatomy of Wonder (2004) II-1158. Several cover creases, inner surface of covers tanned at edges, a very good, unread copy. (#158169).
