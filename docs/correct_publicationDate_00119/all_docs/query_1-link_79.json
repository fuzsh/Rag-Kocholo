        "text": "RESOURCES\n\nThe first year I offered the Intensive English Institute on the Teaching of Science Fiction, a teacher from Buffalo, New York, asked me how many books a teacher should read in order to have a sound background for the teaching of science fiction. I said, offhand, about a hundred books and gave her a list prepared by a committee of the Science Fiction Writers of America and published, together with a commentary by Alexei Panshin, in the June 15, 1970, issue of Library Journal. Since then more than 30,000 books have been published and the list is dated. Below is my own list and my own comments. Though based on the original SFWA list, my list has deletions and additions, for the period not only after, but before 1970. An earlier version of this list also was published in Library Journal, November 15, 1988.\n\nWe do not provide publishing data, for books go in and out of print rapidly and often are reissued by other publishers, but we attempt to link to online sources for most books. Many public libraries will have copies; college libraries with science-fiction collections should have all of them, and many of the titles are available in Easton Press's Masterpieces of Science Fiction collector's editions, which used the 1988 list as a basis for its selections. For current information on availability, the best sources are Books in Print and Paperback Books in Print, as well as the various online book dealers. Because many of these books are getting difficult to find, we have also added links to where you can find these books available for sale online. Just click the underlined book titles to go to an online bookseller offering new or used editions.\n\nIf you have read books by all the authors listed below, you have a solid acquaintance with the foundational and important novels of science fiction. Naturally, people differ in their definition of which books are important or have had a greater impact on the genre. This list will continue to grow as we receive more recommendations for what various scholars consider \"important.\" At some point it will become difficult to read all the works listed here! However, well-read SF readers should be familiar with all of the authors listed below.\n\nWe provide this list as a resource for librarians and other scholars looking for a basis for what constitutes consensus. This list was originally published on the Center for the Study of Science Fiction's website here, where it is regularly updated. We hope you find it useful!\n\nABBOT, Edwin A. Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions [Amazon|Powell's] (1884). British schoolmaster and theologian Edwin A. Abbot (writing this short novella under the pseudonym, \"A Square\") satirizes Victorian culture by developing a two-dimensional world interrupted by a three-dimensional visitor. This device helps expose a number of social issues such as class, gender, and religion. Still popular today, Flatland has been made into a number of short films and even a feature film in 2007.\n\nADAMS, Douglas. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy [Amazon|Powell's] (1979) springboarded from the popular radio and television series into a series of best-selling comic send-ups of SF and society for this British author. In 2005, made into a popular movie.\n\nALDISS, Brian.

The Long Afternoon of Earth [Amazon|Powell's] (Hugo, 1962). Also published as Hothouse [Amazon|Powell's]. A fantastic story of a future when Earth has a tropical climate, plants grow wild, animal life is strange, and spider webs reach to the moon. Other books of interest: The Dark Light Years [Amazon|Powell's](1964); Barefoot in the Head [Amazon|Powell's](1969), Aldiss's psychedelic, Joycean novel; and Frankenstein Unbound [Amazon|Powell's](1973).\n\nANDERSON, Poul. Tau Zero. [Amazon|Powell's] An Einsteinian novel in which a ram-scoop starship malfunctions and continues to accelerate while time passes ever more swiftly outside until the universe collapses.

A long-awaited sequel (Foundation's Edge [Amazon|Powell's]) became a bestseller in 1982, as did all of his 1980s novels binding together his Foundation and his Robot universes. Asimov is a central writer in the SF canon, and this trilogy is a central work in the SF myth of man's empire in space.

His anthology, Before the Golden Age (1974) [Amazon|Powell's], provides a good sample of magazine SF in the 1930s, and his two-volume autobiography (plus a final volume of memoirs) is a long but readable account of what it was like to be a science-fiction writer in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nBALLARD, James. The Crystal World (1966) [Amazon|Powell's]. A strange, introspective novel in which a region of Africa is affected (as well as other parts of the world) by a condition in which living things are changed to crystal. Ballard was a major figure in the British New Worlds, new-wave fiction that emerged in the 1960s.

Classic utopian novel of an insomniac who falls asleep and wakes up in a socialist future; tremendously influential in its time.\n\nBENFORD, Gregory. Timescape [Amazon|Powell's], Campbell, Nebula, 1980. The author, a research physicist and astronomer, has written a number of other novels of interest, particularly his four-volume series about a world-shattering battle between organic and inorganic intelligence at the heart of the galaxy, Great Sky River (1987) [Amazon|Powell's], Tides of Light (1989) [Amazon|Powell's], Furious Gulf (1994) [Amazon|Powell's], and Sailing Bright Eternity (1995) [Amazon|Powell's], to which one might add his earlier Nigel Walmsley novels, In the Ocean of Night (1977) [Amazon|Powell's] and Across the Sea of Suns (1984) [Amazon|Powell's].\n\nBESTER, Alfred. The Demolished Man [Amazon|Powell's]. Flamboyant novel of murder in a world where telepathy is common. Hugo, 1953. The Stars My Destination (also titled Tiger!

He edited Analog magazine after Campbell's death.\n\nBRADBURY, Ray. The Martian Chronicles (1950) [Amazon|Powell's]. Emotion-packed short stories based around a fantasy Mars.

The Past Through Tomorrow [Amazon|Powell's] (1967); this collection of early \"Future History\" stories still is a favorite of many readers. Many consider Starship Troopers [Amazon|Powell's](1959) to be Heinlein's finest work of philosophical SF, and it was made into a movie (1997) and other properties. Perhaps the most influential figure in modern science fiction, Heinlein has excelled in many fields of SF, including juvenile (personal favorite: Have Spacesuit-Will Travel [Amazon|Powell's] 1958) and sexual-religious themes (Stranger in a Strange Land [Amazon|Powell's] Hugo, 1962), as well as straightforward adventure (The Puppet Masters [Amazon|Powell's], 1952; Glory Road [Amazon|Powell's] 1963).\n\nHERBERT, Frank.

This study of a mentally retarded man who becomes a genius through an operation and then regresses to his previous condition won a Hugo in 1960 as a novelette and a Nebula in 1966 as a novel.\n\nKNIGHT, Damon, ed. The Best of Damon Knight [Amazon|Powell's](1976). Knight may be best known as a pioneer critic who became an anthologist and editor, particularly of the original anthology Orbit, but he was the author of great short fiction.
