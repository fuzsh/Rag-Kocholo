I had to return the book before getting half-way into it. I tried to find it later but it had been taken out of the library collection.\n\nI didn't get far into the novel. I don't remember anything about the main character or the plot.\n\nWhat I do remember:\n\nIt is set on Earth in an unspecified near future where teleportation is completely common place. Most people have to ability to do it. People commute to/from work by teleportation.\n\nPeople can not randomly teleport anywwhere they like. They need to have a clear visual memory of the place they want to go to. There are teleporting stations (like subway stations) all over town with distinctive murals or floor-patterns that people use as targets and they walk to last mile or so to wherever they need to go.\n\nI'm not certain but I seem to recall the teleporatation method is aided by technology, with a computer or AI making sure people don't bump into each other when teleporting. This AI may also keep track of people to prevent them jumping to places they are not allowed to go.\n\nThe \"burning man\" is a guy who is locked into some halfway teleported state and who appears to be \"on fire\" to people who see him."
