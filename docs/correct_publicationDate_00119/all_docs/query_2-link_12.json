When I try to use this formula, I think that the $- part of the set analysis is applying to both conditions that I've set, because the number is wildly inaccurate.\n\n=count({$-<actorname={'*'}, Status={'Open'}>} RequestID)\n\nAnother way I tried to do this was by subtracting the number of tickets with an open and not null actorname value from the total count of open tickets, but when I validated my data, I found that it wasn't working either. For that, I used this formula:\n\n=count({<Status={'Open'}>} RequestID)-count({<actorname={'*'}, Status={'Open'}>} RequestID)\n\nIs there a way to get the count of tickets with null actorname values which also have a status of 'Open'?\n\nThanks\n\nyou may be not having exactly null in your data base some time its blank. use len() function .\n\nSo use if(len(actorname)>0,count({$<Status={'Open'}>}RequestID))\n\nThanks\n\nBKC\n\nWell nulls will never be part of the current selection, so you needs something like this:\n\n=count({1<actorname -= {'*'}, Status={'Open'}>} RequestID)\n\nor this:\n\n=count({1<actorname -= {'*'}> * $<Status={'Open'}>} RequestID)\n\nIf these do not work, I suggest you post your application or at least a sample illustrating the problem.\n\nLogic will get you from a to b.
