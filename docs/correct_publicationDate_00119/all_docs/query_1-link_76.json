        "text": "Joe Springer, curator of the Mennonite Historical Library at Goshen College, wants the library to contain all books ever published by and about Mennonites, Amish and Hutterites. He not only knows the MHL catalog, but he combs both rare book and new book catalogs and seems to remember whatever he has seen.\n\nSo when I was writing “In This Issue” as an introduction to serial fiction by and about Mennonites and Amish, I wanted to include a paragraph listing of all such authors’ names. I knew of eleven. I sent the list to him, asking him to add any others that I had missed.\n\nWhen I saw that his list totaled almost three times as many names as mine, I knew I was in trouble. Or, better yet, that here was a phenomenon that needed to be named and explored. One thing led to another, and I compiled the informal bibliography that follows: a rather complete listing of authors, brief biographies, names of series, publishers, individual books and dates of publication.\n\nMost of the series found here fall within the category irreverently called “chick lit” by critics, or, in this case, “bonnet lit,” alluding to the severe head coverings worn by most of the young Mennonite and Amish heroines of these romances, which are usually set in a pastoral countryside. The amazing public following that these books have created in the U.S. and Canada is analyzed in such essays as Jana Reiss’s “Hitching a Ride on the Amish Buggy,” Publishers Weekly 255:22 (June 2, 2008), 58, and ”Christian Fiction Editors Talk Trends: Bonnets Multiply; Goodbye, Chick Lit,” Publishers Weekly 257:10 (March 8, 2010), 1-6. See also Alexandra Alter’s ”They’re No Bodice Rippers, but Amish Romances Are Hot,” Wall Street Journal 254:59 (Sept. 9, 2009), A1-A20.\n\nIf such series are not mainly about romance, they tend to be mystery or detective narratives, with the main sleuth being an unlikely Amish woman or other “plain” person.\n\nAnother category is of books for children, with their main intent being to describe and interpret the “simple” lifestyle, hoping to instill wholesome moral, spiritual and cultural values in young readers.\n\nThe bibliography also includes fiction of greater literary achievement, such as the serial novels by P. L. Gaus, Judy Clemens, Karl Schroeder and Armin Wiebe, as well as Schroeder’s early compatriot in science fiction, A. E. van Vogt.\n\nMost of the writing documented here falls under the radar of the kind of academic literary criticism found at Mennonite literature conferences and in Mennonite scholarly journals. It should not. Yes, it is “popular” literature. But literary criticism has merged into cultural criticism, which acknowledges no hierarchies. And the very popularity of such literature—rankings on theNew York Times best-seller lists, hundreds of thousands of copies sold in both the secular romance and the evangelical Christian markets—makes it a cultural phenomenon on whose reception Mennonites should turn a critical eye. Perhaps a conference devoted to popular Anabaptist serial fiction, or a special issue of The Mennonite Quarterly Review is in order. The bibliographical list presented here should both make that point and help make such study possible.\n\nThe limitations of the bibliography are many, partly because it is based on information from websites, amazon.com and the Mennonite Historical Library at Goshen College – occasionally none of which agree.\n\nPublishers of any one series over the years, or of hardcover become paperback, vary. Some titles are apparently author-published.\n\nAlthough most books are listed, top to bottom, in the order in which they were published in the series, the publication dates given may be for the in-print edition, not for the original publication; or for the paperback rather than the original hardback.\n\nSome “series” consist of a single book or two, with a contract for more. One announced series does not yet have a book in print. Brackets around a title indicate that the book is forthcoming.\n\nHard facts about authors are sometimes difficult to find, hence the very brief biographical notes, which mostly concern the author’s possible connection with Amish and Mennonite communities. More information can be found on most authors’ websites and blogs.\n\nThe nature of “series” is variable. In any one series, most books are set in the same location, but the central characters may be different and the narratives are likely not continuous through the series.\n\nMany popular books about Amish and Mennonites are one-time titles, not in series. For instance, Jodi Picoult’s best-selling Plain Truth is not in the list, nor are other stand-alone titles by the authors whose series are listed here."
