This would also work on import:\n\nif(isnull(Dimension),'Unlisted',Dimension) as Dimension\n\nBest,\n\nMatt\n\nHi,\n\nIf you need this in all the charts then you should do this in script itself, because the calculated dimension has performance issues. As matt suggested do this in the script by using\n\nLOAD\n\n*,\n\nIf(IsNull(DimensionName), 'Unlisted', DimensionName) AS DimensionName\n\nFROM Source;\n\nHope this helps you.\n\nRegards,\n\nJagan."
