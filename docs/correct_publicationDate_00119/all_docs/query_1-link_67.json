Seventeen years later, he published one issue of an amateur mag­ azine called Snide and moved to Salem (Oregon) in a hurry. There he published a second issue and escaped to New York, avoiding a second Salem and a second witch burning. He spent ten years in New York City, editing an assortment of magazines— among them the ill fated Worlds Beyond— reading manuscripts for a quack literary agent, \"being a bohemian in a garret,\" a clerk, a proofreader, a stripper (not Minsky's; for the offset litho trade). Five years ago he retired to the wilds of Penn­ sylvania, where he lives with his wife and two children. He has written some fifty short stories and novelettes, including the classic \"Not With a Bang\"; thirty television scripts for ' 'Captain Video” and one novel, \"Hell’s Pavement.\" A second novel, still untitled, is to be published by Lion Library in 1957,\n\nADVENT : PUBLISHERS 3508 N.

In one false sense, it’s used to mean restrictedly adverse ‘What authors call destructive) criticism, as if a favorable [construc­ tive) evaluation could not be the result of critical analysis. And in another misprision, it’s used to mean reviewing. Reviewing is a lesser art, with a more immediate functional purpose. The reviewer’s objective is to express his reactions to a work in such a way that the readers of a given periodical will know whether or not they want to read it. The critic attempts to measure the work by more lasting and more nearly absolute standards, to determine its place, not for the reader of the moment, but for the cultivated mind viewing the entire art of which this work forms a segment. All of the rest of us—Henry Bott*, Groff Conklin, August Derleth, Floyd C. Gale, Villiers Gerson, H. H. Holmes, J. Francis McComas, P. Schuyler Miller, Hans Stefan Santesson—are pri­ marily reviewers; damon knight, in most of his published assess­ ments of science fiction and particularly in those gathered here, is a critic. Professional criticism is extremely rare in the science fiction field. God knows criticism of science fiction has been more than plentiful outside our orbit; but the critical contributions of selfappointed scholars and intellectuals have been marked by equal portions of distaste for science fiction and complete ignorance of it. (It’s worth noting that one of America’s most esteemed jour­ nals of opinion recently asked Ward Moore to contribute a critique of science fiction—then canceled the assignment when an outline showed that the piece would be both informed and favorable.) Within science fiction, criticism—and frequently of a high order—has appeared almost solely in amateur publications; indeed the wealth of material, critical, bibliographical and biographical, ♦ Forgive me, Dr« Asimov; these names are arranged alphabetically.\n\nIntroduction vii that has appeared in fanzines, from Fantasy Commentator to Inside, is such that a university library with a complete fanzine file would be the Mecca of Ph.D. candidates in the twenty-first century. But damon knight* has introduced criticism into professional magazines—partly because he is equipped with the background and intellect to do so (but then so are most of the reviewers mentioned above), and largely because his magazine outlets, if not always the most affluent or the most widely circulated, have given him free rein and virtually unlimited space. Most of us have free rein to the extent of being allowed to say precisely what we think (though at least one of my reviewing col­ leagues has been subject to arbitrary editorial revision of his expressed opinions), but we’re very tightly restricted in the matter of space, so that we are forced to present a persuasive (we hope) statement rather than a closely reasoned analysis. With all due respect to E. E. Smith, Ph.D., who has expended a good deal of serious research in statistically tabulating the per­ centage of verdicts in which various reviewers and critics are “right” or “wrong,” both reviewing and criticism are matters of opinion. There is no ultimate, absolute Esthetic Truth; and if you attempt to judge the rightness or wrongness of others, you simply set yourself up as a reviewer of reviewers, a critic of critics, and just as fallible as any of them Nevertheless, you tend to rate a man according to the extent to which his opinions agree with yours; but knight, by virtue of the analytical, essayistic treatment made possible by his freedom in space, has an all but unique quality: You can disagree completely on the book in question, and still admire (and even to some extent agree with) the critique. Personally I find myself agreeing with knight to an embarrass­ ingly suspicious degree**. But when I do sharply disagree, I always recognize that knight has read the same book (some rev­ iewers seem to have read a wholly different collection of words printed and bound under the same title) . . . and that a rereading might possibly convert me to his viewpoint. A striking example is Curme Gray’s Murder in Millenium VI, which originally struck me, in 1952, as one of the most unprintable abortions I had ever read. The knight critique in this volume not only brought the * Every time I type that name I have to reassure myself that I have not been reincarnated as a cockroach,\n\n* * In this volume knight covers 81 books, of which I've read and reviewed 75. I'm in unquestioning agreement on 56 of these and have minor reservations---- largely matters of em­ phasis—on 16, leaving only 3 items for real controversy.\n\nIn Search of Wonder vlii entire book vividly back, after four years, to a mind which thought it had mercifully forgotten the whole thing; it also persuaded me that the novel does indeed possess one rare virtue which I had completely overlooked, and I now find myself tempted to go back and reread the book with knight’s analysis in mind. Successively or simultaneously, damon knight has been a science fiction fan, even an actifan (the uninitiated will have no trouble with that fannish word if they’ll simply pronounce it aloud), an editor, a critic and a creative writer. Science fiction readers are used to the phenomenon of the writer-editor; in this field, unlike most others, almost every suc­ cessful editor is or has been a successful writer. But the writercritic is more controversial, if by no means uncommon. The question of whether an arbiter should also be a creator is, as I’ve written elsewhere*, a tough one: “Either way, the victim of an unfavorable review can make what seems a legitimate com­ plaint. If the reviewer is not a writer, what does he know about the field? He’s probably soured and frustrated because he can’t sell, and takes out his spite on those who do. If he is a writer, he’s jealous of competition, he can understand only his own kind of story, and who’s he to talk anyway—look at his own stuff!” In knight’s case, at least, the writer-critic duality seems to work out admirably. There’s plentiful evidence in this volume that he loves competition and that he understands intimately many types of stories not remotely related to his own work. And if you “look at his own stuff,” you can only be dazed and delighted by such virtually perfect short stories as “To Serve Man” (Galaxy, November, 1950) and “Not With a Bang” (F&SF, Winter-Spring, 1950) and such an imperfect but brilliantly stimulating novel as Hell's Pavement (Lion, 1955). (Pavement, incidentally, is knight’s only previous book. The present volume marks an unprecedented event: the publication of a science fiction author’s collected critiques before his collected short stories. The latter collection is long overdue—Publishers please note!) And the practice of the critical profession has developed in knight-the-writer an unusual and valuable quality of self-criticism. He is able, as is almost no other professional writer of fiction, to stand apart from his completed work and look at it objectively. While an editor is still brooding over what suggestions to make for salvaging a flawed but potentially fine knight story, he’ll receive an unsuggested rewrite which solves all the problems. ♦The Mystery Writers Handbook, by the Mystery Writers of America (Harpers, 1956)\n\nix\n\nIntroduction\n\nKnight can be so dazzlingly individual as either critic or writer (he didn’t do badly as an editor either; possibly the most tragic instance of stupidity in the whole misbegotten science fiction “boom” was the almost contraceptive killing off of Worlds Beyond) that writers and readers alike have been highly curious as to what he is like as a person. The science fiction universe teems with flamboyant outsize extroverts; surely a man who, in print, manages to stand out as a personality in such company must be something spectacular in the flesh. So came the Thirteenth World Science Fiction Convention in Cleveland in 1955 (that happiest, warmest, most delightful of Conventions!), and damon knight, who had been out of direct con­ tact with fandom since before his rise to professional prominence, decided to attend. The fans at the convention got ready to bug their eyes; the pro­ fessionals checked the condition of their body armor. (I don’t know why knight has such an undeserved reputation as a hostile critic; this volume contains far more praise than attack, and if the debunking of Austin Hall is as devastating a hatchet job as I’ve read, the section on Heinlein is a sheer love letter.) And damon knight appeared . . . and suddenly one understood the reason for those minuscule initials. One could not possibly write, with conventional capitalization, “And Damon Knight appeared”; it would be overstating the facts. A batch of editors and writers staged for the Convention a satiric skit on the past, present and future of science fiction— written, memorized, rehearsed, costumed, lighted and presented in something under 24 hours. And while we were writing it, there I was in a room with three men who could out-talk me. This is not a common event, even in science fiction circles; but Fritz Leiber has trained Shakespearean articulation and projection, Randall Garrett has an improbable and even indecent amount of the Effervescence of Youth, and Sam Moskowitz has a voice which is obviously the Creator’s working model for the Last Trump. I know when I’m licked. I stretched out on a bed and settled down to the pleasant task of contemplating fellow-collaborators Mildred Clingerman and Judith Merril, while creative contention thundered around me. And off in a corner of the hotel room, damon knight found a typewriter, set it up on a desk, found paper and carbon, and wrote the skit. All of the rest of us had starring parts and chewed them down to the last scrap of hamfat; knight did not appear in it.\n\nIn Search of Wonder I should like to know damon knight well; I hope in time I shall do so (and possibly even discover the existence of Damon Knight). But meanwhile I think of him as the man at the typewriter, quietly getting something done while the rest of us make a great foofaraw about it. x\n\nThis book is, I think, another example of knight’s getting some­ thing done. What kind of book is it? Well, it’s easier to start off by defining a few things which it is not. It is not an earnest endeavor to reach the ultimate implications of science fiction as a form and its place in our culture; if you want that, see Reginald Bretnor’s Modem Science Fiction: its Meaning and Its Future (Coward-McCann, 1953). It is not, except inadvertently, a compendium of useful how-to notes for the writer of science fiction; see L. Sprague de Camp’s Science Fiction Handbook (Hermitage, 1953). It is not a gently persuasive lure for the reader who knows nothing of science fiction; see Basil Davenport’s Inquiry into Science Fiction (Longmans, Green, 1955). It is not even, to be strictly accurate, quite a book, any more than loosely assembled series of shorts and novelets, as knight points out, are really novels. It is a collection of critical notes and essays managing to cover, among them, most of the principal trends and individual authors of modern science fiction—in book form, I should add, since the magazines are considered only indirectly as sources of book material. It is addressed—though the wit and clarity of the writing should make it readable to anyone—specifically to the regular reader of science fiction ... a marked advantage in that the writer of critiques for the general literary public must spend much of his time in uncomfortable defensive or evangelistic postures. (And too, among ourselves one can attack faults in science fiction with­ out being misinterpreted as attacking the genre itself.) And (this is the “getting something done”) it provides conclu­ sive proof that, to quote knight’s introductory credo, “science fiction is a field of literature worth taking seriously, and that ordinary critical standards can be meaningfully applied to it.” Some of us have been going around, aggressively or piteously, arguing that look, science fiction is a part of literature. Others have disregarded the problem; and most astoundingly, John W. Campbell, Jr.—who of all people should know better—has\n\nxi\n\nIntroduction recently* asserted flatly that science fiction is not literature and cannot be assessed by normal literary standards of critical values. Meanwhile damon knight has simply gone ahead, taken science fiction seriously as a field of literature, applied ordinary critical standards, and made the result meaningful. It’s as easy as that if you settle down to your typewriter in a corner away from the foofaraw. ANTHONY BOUCHER\n\nBerkeley, California June 5, 1956\n\n★ \"Science Fiction and the Opinion of the Universe, \" Saturday Review, May 12, 1956.\n\nAUTHOR’S NOTE\n\nTHIS BOOK CONSISTS mainly of critical pieces written from 1952 to the present. I owe very grateful thanks to people like Jim Blish who said there ought to be a book, as well as to editors Lester del Rey and Robert W. Lowndes, who between them gave me my start in this field, and to Earl Kemp and Sidney Coleman for many invaluable suggestions. These short essays make up an informal record of the period that will be known to science fiction historians as the Boom of 1950-1955. It was a period that produced some of the best science fiction ever to appear in hard covers, along with a fascinating flood of the worst science fiction ever conceived by the mind of man. Bad and good, I’ve taken it all for what enjoyment or moral could be squeezed out of it. The flood has now receded, but if science fiction runs true to its cyclical pattern, there’ll be another about 1960. And, I trust, I’ll be on hand with the same net and gun.\n\nDAMON KNIGHT Milford, Pennsylvania June 8, 1956\n\nCHAPTER\n\nONE\n\nCRITICS\n\nTHIS CREDO APPEARED in my first review column for Lester del Rey’s Science Fiction Adventures (November, 1952); I have stuck to it ever since, and I think it introduces this book as well as the column.\n\nSome readers (not to mention writers, editors and publishers) may be unpleasantly surprised by the pugnacious tone of the reviews that follow. I won’t apologize—not very often, anyhow— but I will explain. As a critic, I operate under certain basic assumptions, all eccentric, to wit: 1. That the term “science fiction” is a misnomer, that trying to get two enthusiasts to agree on a definition of it leads only to bloody knuckles; that better labels have been devised (Heinlein’s suggestion, “speculative fiction,” is the best, I think), but that we’re stuck with this one; and that it will do us no particular harm if we remember that, like “The Saturday Evening Post,” it means what we point to when we say it. 2. That a publisher’s jacket blurb and a book review are two different things, and should be composed accordingly. 3. That science fiction is a field of literature worth taking seriously, and that ordinary critical standards can be meaning­ fully applied to it: e. g., originality, sincerity, style, construc­ tion, logic, coherence, sanity, garden-variety grammar. 4. That a bad book hurts science fiction more than ten bad notices. The publishers disclaim all responsibility; angry readers please apply to me.\n\nNowadays, we like to think, everybody loves science-fantasy, from Artie Shaw to Clifton Fadiman; but occasionally we are re­ minded that not all the world’s respectable literary parlors are yet open to us. Such a reminder is Arthur Koestler’s short essay, “The Boredom of Fantasy,” in the August, 1953 issue of Harper’s Bazaar. After a burst of good-humored laughter at the expense of one of A. E. van Vogt’s wilder novels (the hero of which Koestler identifies as “Robert Headrock”), Koestler admits that he is\n\n2 In Search of Wonder partially addicted to the stuff himself, deals briefly and penetratingly with the history of the field, and then gets down to his major point: He likes it, but it isn’t art. ...Swift’s Gulliver, Huxley’s Brave New World, Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Eour are great works of literature because in them the oddities of alien worlds serve merely as a background or pretext for a social message. In other words, they are literature precisely to the extent to which they are not science fiction, to which they are works of disciplined imagination and not of unlimited fantasy.\n\nThis criticism is less than we might have expected from one of the most brilliant of all living novelists. All that Koestler says here is inarguably true, and perfectly irrelevant. “A similar rule holds for the detective story,” he goes on. Just so; and for the historical story,the realistic story,the story of protest, the story of ideas, the story of manners, the story of adventure; in short, for all fiction. Science-fantasy is a form: what matters is what you put into it. Again: ‘‘This is why the historical novel is practically dead today. The life of an Egyptian civil servant under the Eighteenth Dynasty, or even of a soldier in Cromwell’s army, is only imagi­ nable to us in a dim outline; we are unable to identify ourselves with the strange figure moving in a strange world.” Koestler should have added, ‘‘unless the writer has genius”; in sciencefantasy as elsewhere, this is not a true statement of a limitation but only of an obstacle. We have not been to Mars; neither have we been to Elsinore, nor to ancient Rome, nor, most of us, to a Russian prison, to a penthouse, to a sweatshop, to a DP camp. This obstacle was brilliantly surmounted in Koestler’s own first novel, The Gladiators ; and what is Darkness at Noon but a masterful exercise in speculative imagination? If science-fantasy has to date failed to produce much great literature, don’t blame the writers who have worked in the field: blame those who, out of snobbery, haven’t. This question of the respectability, or respectable value of science fiction has vexed a lot of the people who read it. Thousands, I suppose, have torn off the covers of science fiction magazines before taking them home, and many must have felt guiltily doubtful about the contents even then. Science fiction has long had, still has a dubious aura: we read it for a certain special kind of satisfaction, but we are frequently aware that according to ordinary standards of taste we ought not to like it. Dozens of scholarly articles have been written to demonstrate the special nature of science fiction (‘‘the genre”) and why it really is (or isn’t) a scare literature for adolescents. Most of\n\n3 Critics these have been produced by people with only a superficial acquaintance with the field, but even knowledgeable critics often add to the confusion. To see what may be at the bottom of all this argument, suppose we try asking two* questions: 1. What is reputable fiction? 2. What is special about science fiction? Reputable fiction—meaning fiction that the critics and the librarians like—has many distinguishing characteristics, but two of them appear to be central: it is fiction laid against familiar backgrounds (familiar, at least, to readers of reputable fiction— as far as the reader’s personal experience goes, a Dakota wheat farm may be as exotic as the moons of Mars); and it tries to deal honestly with the tragic and poetic theme of love-and-death. The disreputable forms, the Western, science fiction, sports story and so on are defined by their backgrounds; but please note that this is a convention. You could define all of fiction in this way, piecemeal—“New York stories,” “Dakota wheat farm stories” and so on, but it isn’t convenient or necessary to do so. What really distinguishes the disreputable forms is their re­ duction of love and death to perfunctory gestures, formalized almost like ideographs. (The villain falls over a cliff; the heroine falls into the hero’s arms; neither event takes more than a paragraph.) Detective fiction, a half-reputable form, owes its half-accep­ tance to its partial honesty with death. The popular forms, the slick short story, TV serial and so on, suppress both love and death (substituting “romance” and “menace”); that’s why they are popular. Now, what is special about science fiction? It might be more appropriate to ask what is special about “mainstream” fiction. The latter is restricted to a small number of conventional times - and - places. Science fiction includes all these, and all others that a writer of our time-andplace can imagine. Science fiction is speculative; but so is every work of fiction, to some degree; historical and exotic fiction particularly so. These are convenient standards, and it’s inevitable that librarians and critics will use them—but there must have been a time when stories about India or Alaska or the South Seas were “outlandish,” “weird,” “unbelievable,” “unheard of” and so on. Such stories have gained mass acceptance simply by being around long enough to become familiar; and we may expect that science fiction will do the same.\n\nIn Search of Wonder What we get from science fiction—what keeps us reading it, in spite of our doubts and occasional disgust—is not different from the thing that makes mainstream stories rewarding, but only expressed differently. We live on a minute island of known things. Our undiminished wonder at the mystery which surrounds us, is what makes us human. In science fiction we can approach that mystery, not in small, everyday symbols, but in the big ones of space and time. That’s all—or nearly all. Science fiction is already moving out of the realm of disrepu­ table forms, just as the Western is, and just as, to a considerable degree, the detective story is moving upward from its half-repu­ table status. It can’t, I’m afraid, ever become a popular form— it won’t stand the suppression. But it can be wholly respectable, and in such stories as C. L. Moore’s \"No Woman Born’’ (Astounding, December, 1944), Philip Farmer’s \"The Lovers’’ (Startling, August, 1952) and many more, it’s already well on the way. The librarians are already on our side; give the critics time.\n\n4\n\nCHAPTER\n\nTWO\n\nTHE CLASSICS\n\nNOW THAT AMERICAN science fiction, past its majority, is heading for the peaceful middle age of an established form, some of its earliest adherents feel as if they had suddenly grown long gray beards; there is nothing more pathetic, I suppose, than the look on the face of an old-guard fan who’s waited to say something about Stanton A. Coblentz, while all around him people are talking about Heinlein. With understandable bitterness, some have been driven to the extreme position that no science fiction published later than 1935 is worth reading—while among their younger colleagues it isn’t hard to find those who will put the date still later, and argue that everything published before it was trash. But whether you belong to either group, or to neither, there’s almost certain to be something in The Heads of Cerebrus for you, Those who yearn for the Good Old Days are bound to like it—it was first published in The Thrill Book, in 1919. Those who insist on the close reasoning and the satirical wit of modern science fiction will find surprising amounts of both here; and if, like my­ self, you have a foot in both camps, you’re sure to be delighted by this connoisseur’s blend of the quaint and the ageless. Terry Trenmore, not the ingenue but the hero of this story any­ way, is the sort of big, flamboyant, sentimental, stage Irishman that used to turn up all the time in the popular arts until, I guess, about the time Victor McLaglen retired and Brian Ahearne went back to drawingroom comedy. You couldn’t write about such a man today, he doesn’t exist; but, here he is, for those that love him, musclebound and poetic as ever. For contrast, look at the world into which Trenmore and his friends stumble: Philadelphia in the year 2118, ruled as a pocket oligarcy by “Penn Service” and its glittering court of Superla­ tives—the Loveliest, the Cleverest and so on—chosen and kept in power by blatantly rigged tests, while the proletarians have no names at all, only numbers which they must wear on Landon-sized lapel buttons. It isn’t the best social satire in the world; but it’s modern enough, if you like, to have come out of thé pages of a 1956 magazine.\n\nIn Search of Wonder P. Schuyler Miller calls this “perhaps the first work of fantasy to envisage the parallel-time-track concept.” You can read it that way, to be sure, but it’s perversity; the author tells you in plain terms that the story’s about something quite different and at least as interesting. Philadelphia 2118 is a world of might-be, a philosophical spark struck off from the brain of the first traveler to find the way out of our prosaic universe of what-is.\n\n6\n\n“Many times have I sought him there. Many times has his name come up in some such fantastic connection as it came to you. I have seen, as it were, the shadow of his thought sketched in the tangible phantasmagoria which surrounded me. But either he evades me purposely, or he is dead, and only his mind endures as an invisible force ... ”\n\nThat passage has a dusty taste, and much of the writing is the same or worse, but not all by any means. Let me quote the beginning of chapter 5: When the marvelous oversteps the bounds of known possibility there are three ways of meeting it. Trenmore and his sister, after a grave discussion of certain contingencies connected with the Catholic religion and a dismissal of them on grounds too utterly Celtic and dogmatic for Drayton to follow, took the first way. From that time on they faced every wonder as a fact by itself, to be accepted as such and let go at that. Drayton ... compromised on the second way, and accepted with a mental reservation, as “I see you now, but I am not at all sure that you are there or that I really believe in you!’* Fortunately there was not one of the three so lacking in mental elasticity as to discover the third way, which is madness.\n\nNow that, I submit, is not dated writing and is never likely to be; it’s lucid, didactic, analytical and above all, zestful: an adjective which describes nearly the whole of the book. “Francis Stevens,” we are given to understand, wrote only out of need and stopped at once when the need ended; but she wrote in the only way good writing is ever done: with joy. There is no plot neces­ sity for the interlude in the half-world of Ulithia; it’s pure fantasy for the love of it; and there are lines in that chapter that are feather-touches along the cheek.\n\nOne of science fiction’s few genuine classics, out of print in this country since 1937, is Karel Capek’s wonderful War With the Newts. The publishers’ cover blurb for the Bantam paperbound edition (“ ... a great novelist’s electrifying story of what might happen to our world tomorrow ... ”) is of course pure space gas, as Tom Corbett would say. This is a satire, one of the great ones. It has enormous charm, human warmth, gaiety, wit—and all the time, gently, patiently, it is flaying human society by inches.\n\n1\n\nThe Classics The Newts (a giant species hitherto known only as a fossil) were discovered on the shore of Tanah Masa by gloomy old Captain J. van Toch, who took a paternal liking to them. (“ ‘What’s the use, you ought to be honest even with animals.’ ”) At first they brought up pearl shells, in exchange for tools to build their dams and breakwaters, and weapons to fight sharks. Later, when it was discovered that they could talk, it was natural for more and more people to seek other uses for them. With great ingenuity, and in spite of the most disheartening obstacles, people succeeded. The flesh of the Newts has also been taken to be unfit for human consumption and even poisonous; if eaten raw, it causes acute pains, vomiting, and mental hallucinations. Or. Pinkel ascertained after many experiments performed on himself that these harmful effects disappear If the chopped meat is scalded with hot water (as with some toadstools), and after washing thoroughly it is pickled for twenty-four hours in a weak solution of permanganate of potash. Then it can be cooked or stewed, and tastes like inferior beef. In this way we ate a Newt called Hans; he was an able and intelligent animal with a special bent for scientific work; he was employed in Dr. Pinkel’s department as his assistant, and even refined chemical analysis could be en­ trusted to him. We used to have long conversations with him in the evenings, amusing ourselves with his insatiable thirst for knowledge. With deep regret we had to put Hans to death, because my experiments on trepanning had made him blind....\n\nFed, protected, dissected, exploited, armed by every nation against every other, the Newts continued to grow in numbers, as well as in knowledge. Not so many years after old Captain van Toch passed away, there were already twenty billion worker and warrior Newts in the world, or about ten times more Newts than people. ... The young Newts apparently stood for progress without any reservations or restrictions, and declared that below the water they ought to assimilate all land culture of every kind, not omit­ ting even football, fascism, and sexual perversions;....\n\nThen one day the world awakened to find an earthquake had sunk three hundred square miles of Louisiana under shallow water. A strange croaking radio voice came out of the sea: “Hello, you people!; Don’t get excited ... There are too many of us. There is not space enough for us on your coasts any longer. Therefore we must break down your continents....’’\n\nOnly out of a landlocked and tired little nation could have come such raw despair, so incredibly blended with gentle, calm affec­ tion. “The Newts,” says Egon Hostovsky in his Note on the Author, “are, of course, symbols of nazis and communists.” So they are, fleetingly, at the end of the book, which trails off into a nightmare much as Mark Twain’s “A Connecticut Yankee” does; but most of the time, I think, the Newts are ourselves as Capek\n\n8 saw us—gentle, long-suffering, other sharks of the land.\n\nIn Search of Wonder mute; the natural prey of\n\nUnder the Triple Suns, by Stanton A. Coblentz, is a wild, heavy-handed 1930-style adventure story, which I can’t honestly recommend to modern readers: but I think science fiction writers ought to read it. I’m speaking to you, from Doc Smith on, who have fallen into the habit of describing an alien city, on another planet, as if it were Manhattan seen through slightly cockeyed spectacles. There is a failure of communication, the expected article is not reach­ ing the customer, when a science fiction hero arrives in the metropolis of Ub-Gloob, on Sirius XII, to find that the only dif­ ference between it and New York is that the cars move faster. Looking back, it’s easy to see how thegambit began: the slambang science adventure epic whose growth took place in the thirties would have been intolerably slowed down, if the writer had felt obliged to examine every new race and culture in detail. But it’s easy to see, too, that the new convention was a betrayal of science fiction. Science fiction exists to provide what Moskowitz and others call “the sense of wonder’’: some widening of the mind’s horizons, no matter in what direction—the landscape of another planet, or a corpuscle’s-eye view of an artery, or what it feels like to be in rapport with a cat ... any new sensory experience, impossible to the reader in his own person, is grist for the mill, and what the activity of science fiction writing is all about. So: notice, once you have passed (or skipped) the wooden dialogue and stereotyped action of the early chapters, Coblentz’s notion of a city on another planet: He was peering into an enclosure that hardly seemed an en­ closure at all. Far above, at a height of thousands of feet, the gray cobweb ceiling curved like an actual sky. Though from without, it had looked opaque, from within he saw it to be trans­ lucent: the subdued and filtered radiance of the three suns penetrated it with a soft, even glow. ... The walls were ribbed with thousands of strands of some fabric that looked like bamboo and crossed it irregularly, and yet somehow gave the impression of branching supports, which likewise suggested a cobweb, curved and bent and twisted between the floor and the ceiling, with closely woven whorls and patterned spirals and platforms and slim long cables that swung faintly as if in an invisible current.\n\nCoblentz’s story unfolds itself, steeped in the sunless gloom of this gigantic spiderweb tent—a vivid sensory experience that never was in the world before. Coblentz uses this background for an engaging but primitive satire about “social climbers’’ (the\n\n» The Classics social status of the Ugwugs, the city’s inhabitants, depends on their height above the tent’s floor) and similar conceits; but it would have served equally well for a straightforwardXenographic story, or puzzle, or mood story, or whatever you like. The point is: If your alien planet is just like Broadway, or even just like Uganda, what the devil is the use of leaving Earth at all?\n\nJohn Collier, who must be now getting on towards sixty, was once an impudent young man with a poet’s heart and an engagingly apelike countenance, the latter two of which qualities he retains to this day. These traditionally Hibernian attributes have been the making of many a great minstrel, warrior, king or rogue. The combination cannot help but explode into things utterly new and astonishing—into heads carved off with goose-quill nicety, or rhymes chopped out with an axe. Except he takes a club or a dirk in his hand, a man so endowed is doomed to be disappointed in love, tyrannized by relatives, gulled twice a week by the unscrupulous, and mocked at by Philistines: but give him a pen, and he will get his own back twice over. There was a young man who was invariably spurned by the girls, not because he smelt at all bad, but because he happened to be as ugly as a monkey. He had a good heart, but this soured it, and though he would grudgingly admit that the female kind were very agreeable in shape, size, and texture, he thought in all other respects they were the most stupid, blind perverse, and illnatured bitches that had ever infested the earth.\n\nThis is the first paragraph of “The Devil George and Rosie.’’ one of the fifty stories in Collier’s collection Fancies and Goodnights, in which ugly, good-natured and gullible persons figure at length. Clearly enough, all these persons are Collier himself; very infrequently one of them, like George, is allowed to take the principal role; but most of them appear as demons. “Hell,” said Percy Bysshe Shelley, “is a city much like London”; Collier has made it as easily reached and very nearly as familiar. In Hell, as in other places that we know of, conditions are damnably disagreeable. Well-adjusted, energetic, and ambitious devils take this very much in their stride. They expect to improve their lot and ultimately to become fiends* of distinction.\n\nThis is an ill-founded hope, however; Collier’s demons vary somewhat in appearance and disposition, but there is nothing really objectionable about any of them; on the contrary, they are ♦ This word appears as \"friends\" in the Doubleday text; printers, as we all know, are the lily-purest and most angelic of mortals, and I doubt if there is one of them who knows what a fiend is.\n\n11 The Classics rather likeable fellows but in their pure state hopelessly incom­ petent to meet the challenges of modern living. The nastiest of the lot is old Tom Truncheontail of “Fallen Star,’’ from which story the quotation above is taken; and even he, after psycho­ analysis, becomes well-tailored and taillessly respectable, and makes a fortune in Wall Street. Not as much can be said for all the human characters in these stories, which also abound in spiteful and tight-fisted male re­ lations, fat hennaed sluts, murdered wives and the like; however, there is a bit of Collier in the worst of them, and whatever they may be doing—poisoning or disemboweling each other, leaping from the tops of skyscrapers, posing as specimens of the taxi­ dermist’s art—it is sure to be done with the utmost aplomb. Nearly all these stories belong to one canon: the conventional romantic fantasy, or domestic tragedy, or sophisticated love story, with the fur side in. Nothing ever works out even approxi­ mately as expected; every turn of the plot is a wild (but remorse­ lessly logical) tangent; wives become husbands, the innocent are guilty, jinn equals Aladdin. Collier takes an innocent, childish delight in pulling the rug out from under his reader, sometimes before he is fairly on it, as in the opening sentence of “Pictures in the Fire,” “Dreaming of money as I lay half asleep on the Malibu sand...” These first lines are an especial preoccupation of Collier’s (and the last lines as well); there is nothing like them anywhere else in literature; they are sandbags between the eyes. “Great Possibilities,” for example, opens as follows: There are certain people who do not come to full flower until they are well over fifty. Among these are all males named Murchison.\n\nCollier, besides, was quick to learn the unpalatable truth that bitterness does not make art until it is transmuted into satire, that tragedy bores us unless it is preventable, that beauty is like Pablum without a touch of the ludicrous. Only twice in fifty stories, in “The Lady on the Grey” and “Special Delivery,” has he made the error of taking himself too seriously; and these are stories that would shine in other company. In addition to Hell and its environs, Collier has taken a great interest in the domestic scene. In the same volume there are two stories in which a man kills his wife (the classics “De Mortuis” and “Back for Christmas”); one in which the job is carried out for him by an obliging monster; one in which he does his best, but owing to a regrettable misunderstanding is hoist by his own mushroom; and one in which two soul-mates simultaneously poison each other for the insurance; this without taking any\n\n12 In Search of Wonder account of slaughtered uncles and nephews. Collier has also done incredible things to the triangle as well as the quadrangle plot, and has turned his attention upon M. D.’s, dentists, psycho­ analysts, bohemians and other curious fauna in London, Hollywood and New York. Some of these tales have the dramatic simplicity of an anonymous anecdote, and in fact one of them (not included here) appeared as such, condensed and shorn of its author’s name, in a jackdaw volume of Bennet Cerf’s. Three others demand special mention and a category of their own: three tours de force, conversation pieces in which the implications areeverything, the events visible onstage nothing: “Little Memento,” “The Chaser” and the finest short murder mystery ever written, “The Touch of Nutmeg Makes It.” In nearly all the stories here collected, the influence of poet and ape are equally felt, which is to say that these stories are brilliantly balanced on the tension between farce and tragedy. It is the business of the satirist to make his readers forget that he is a living human being, able to be hurt, able to love or hate singlemindedly and without reserve; but in one story, “The Steel Cat,” Collier’s art is something more than satire. Here the ape speaks alone; the poet has been temporarily won over, and is present only to contribute the artistry that makes the death of a mouse a more shameful and terrible thing than the death of Desdemona. ' Elsewhere, however briefly, the poet also is audible alone; and I think it fit to end with this one last quotation, the opening lines of “Variation On A Theme”: A young man, with a bowler hat, cane, flaxen mustache, and blue suit, was looking at a gorilla in a zoo. All about him were cages floored with squares of desert. On these yellow flats, like precise false statements of equatorial latitudes, lay the shadows of bars. There were nutshells, banana skins, fading lettuce; there were the cries of birds who believed themselves mewed up because they were mad, the obeisances of giraffes, the yawns of lions. In an imitation of moon crags, mountain goats bore about ignobly eyes that were pieces of moon.\n\nThe Coming of Conan, by Robert E. Howard, is of interest to Howard enthusiasts, who will treasure it no matter what anyone says, and to students who may find it, as I do, an intriguing com­ panion piece to L. Sprague de Camp’s The Tritonian Ring. Howard’s tales lack the de Camp verisimilitude—Howard never tried, or never tried intelligently, to give his preposterous saga the ring of truth—but they have something that de Camp’s stories lack: a vividness, a color, a dream-dust sparkle, even when they’re most insulting to the rational mind.\n\nThe Classics Howard had the maniac’s advantage of believing whatever he wrote; de Camp is too wise to believe wholeheartedly in anything. This book contains the only fragment of a Conan story that I remember from Weird Tales—Conan tippy-toeing along a ledge with a naked girl held by the hair, and then dropping her carefully into a cesspool—which turns out to be neither as isolated nor as insignificant as I had supposed. Another naked lady friend of the hero’s, in another episode, winds up hanged to a yardarm with a rope of jewels;and for that matter, hardly anyone, man or woman, squeaks through the Conan saga without some similar punishment, except Conan himself. All the great fantasies, I suppose, have been written by emo­ tionally crippled men. Howard was a recluse and a man so morbidly attached to his mother that when she died he committed suicide; Lovecraft had enough phobias and eccentricities for nine; Merritt was chinless, bald and shaped like a shmoo. The trouble with Conan is that the human race never has produced and never could produce such a man, and sane writers know it; therefore the sick writers have a monopoly of him.\n\n13\n\nCHAPTER\n\nTHREE\n\nCHUCKLEHEADS\n\nMY PUBLISHERS have asked me to open this chapter by dealing with a hypothetical reader’s hypothetical question: “If these books are so bad, why bother writing so much about them?” I had to stop and think. I have been throwing bad tomatoes at worse performances for so long, and so entirely instinctively, that it had never occurred to me to think up a reason for it. Why should anybody rip a bad work of art to shreds? Why, to find out how it is made. The critical method is to take things apart. The critic uses the same sharp-edged tools on all stories, but good stories resist; bad ones come to pieces. One of these tools happens to be laughter; that.’s all. I should have thought it was obvious. The Blind Spot, by Austin Hall and Homer Eon Flint, is an acknowledged classic of fantasy, first published in 1921; much praised since then, several times reprinted, venerated by connois­ seurs—all despite the fact that the book has no recognizable vestige of merit. Hall, who wrote 39 of the book’s 48 chapters, had these faults: He was style-deaf. Sample, from the prologue: For years he had been battering down the skepticism that had bulwarked itself in the material.\n\nAnother, from page 273: ... he had backtracked on his previous acts so as to side in with the facts...\n\nHe was totally innocent of grammar. This is not an exagger­ ation; Hall could not tell a noun from an adjective, or a verb from either. Two samples, both from page 20: She is fire and flesh and carnal—... at whose feet fools and wise men would slavishly frolic and folly.\n\nHe was so little at home in the English language that he could not lay hands on the commonest idiom without mangling it. Three samples, out of dozens:\n\n15\n\nChuckleheads It was a stagger for both young men. (Page 264.) There was a resemblance to Rhamda Avec that ran almost to counterpart. (Page 172.) It was a long hark back to our childhood. (Page 30)\n\nHe was credulous without limit. The myths solemnly subscribed to in this book—none of them having anything to do with the plot— include the intuition of women, the character-judgment of dogs, “animal magnetism,” “psychic vibrations” and the influence of intelligence on the color of the eyes. He had no power of observation. The men about him purchased cigars and cigarettes, and, as is the habit of all smokers, strolled off with delighted relish. (Page 1.)\n\nHe had no empathy, and, I might add, no sense of humor. This is his notion of writing like a woman: I am but a girl: ... I should be jealous and I should hate her: It is the way of woman. ... I am a girl and I like attention; all girls do. ... I had all of a girl’s wild fears and fancies. I am a girl, of course.... (Pages 101-103.)\n\nHis knowledge of science, if he had any, is not discoverable in these pages. He used “ether,” “force” and “vibration” synonymously. On page 85, a chemist refers to a stone’s thermal properties as “magnetism.” “Magnetic,” like “sequence,” “almost,” “intrinsic,” “incandescense” (sic) and “iridescense” (sic) is a word Hall kept tossing in at random, hoping to hit something with it eventually. For example: She /a? dog named Queen/ caught him by the trouser-leg and drew him back. She crowded us away from the curtains. It was almost magnetic. (Page 95.)\n\nHe was incapable of remembering what he had already written or looking forward to what he was about to write, except when it was inappropriate to do so. For example, the book opens with the introduction of a character known as Rhamda Avec. (Didn’t I say Hall had no sense of humor?) “Rhamda” is a title, but the narrator does not know this, no one who uses the name in conver­ sation knows it, and the reader is not supposed to find out about it until page 58. Nevertheless, Avec is consistently referred to as “the Rhamda.” And then, on page 171, we get this: By this time Watson was convinced that the word indicated some sort of title.\n\nThis Rhamda is a mysterious personage who, it goes on to appear, has come through the Blind Spot—an intermittent pas­ sageway between the Earth and another world. Somehow con­ nected with the Spot is a blue jewel of odd properties, which the Rhamda spends the first half of the book trying to recover from one of the four protagonists; but inasmuch as he refuses to tell\n\n16 In Search of Wonder anybody why he wants it, what it is, who Zze is, or what happened to kindly old Dr. Holcomb—who vanished through the Spot shortly after being seen with the Rhamda—it’s not surprising that he never gets it. Later on he gets lost somehow, an entirely new villain shows up—“the Bar Senestro,” if you please—and it eventually turns out that the Rhamda has no ulterior motives at all, but simply wanted to do everybody a good turn by getting the jewel back where it belonged. This being so, it is hard to understand why he stalked around like a silent-movie villain for twenty-odd chapters, clam-silent and snake-sinister. The behavior of the other characters is equally puzzling. Another tourist from the far side of the spot is wandering around in the early chapters—“the Nervina.” She also wants the jewel returned to the Rhamda but is angry at him—no reason given— and she won’t tell anybody anything, either. It becomes evident early in the story that the Rhamda can’t or won’t take the jewel by force, and yet two of the protagonists, in turn, wear it for months even though it is evidently killing them. Still earlier, fourteen pages are devoted to the introduction of the jewel. On page 40, one of the protagonists shows it to two others; on page 54, he disappears into the Spot. In between, it occurs to nobody to ask, “Where did you get it?’’ and as a result nobody finds-out until page 72. “Hall,” says Forrest J Ackerman’s introduction, “contributed a great knowledge of history and anthropology, while Flint’s fortes were physics and medicine.’’ Flint’s understanding of physics may be judged by this passage, from page 147. (The stone “inducts” sound. They seal it in an air-tight canister; the sound stops.) “Ah!” cried Herold. “It’s a question of radioactivity, then!...\n\nFlint’s nine chapters, written in a gushing, mock-hearty style which is an immeasurable relief after Hall’s illiteracy, do inject some bustle into the story and contribute a good deal of common sense: “Work on that ring. I was a fool not to get busy sooner.”\n\nThis is true, and applies with much greater force to protagon­ ist number one, who, instead of following up the only lead he had, apparently spent twelve months mooning around the awful old house on Chatterton Place, reading the collected works of Madame Blavatsky. But Flint’s memory was as frail as Hall’s. On page 149 an extraordinarily heavy lump of stone, which Herold can barely lift with a spade, is discovered for the first time in the pile of earth\n\n1' Chuckleheads which Jerome had previously dug up, sifted minutely, and tossed through a doorway into the next room in the cellar. Flint’s numerous new characters do nothing, say nothing— although at great length—and now Hall takes over again, this time on the other side of the Spot, where we meet more new people, including a woman with ... a wonderful fold of rich brown hair, tastefully done ... Most of Hall’s women have this oddity; in this case it sounds like something between an envelope and a crepe Suzette. We also rediscover Dr. Holcomb, comfortably estab­ lished as the reincarnation of a local God, and the story winds up in a very conventional melange of pageantry, witchcraft and good clean sport, which Merritt might have written in an off week. We learn from Dr. Holcomb the importance of the Blind Spot: “It will silence the skeptics, and form a bulwark for all re­ ligion’’; working together, our friends succeed in restoring the missing jewels to their places, returning to Earth, and closing the Spot; the eligible members of the party are neatly married off, and all ends happily. The Rhamda Avec, having been mislaid twenty-one chapters back, remains so. We are left to wonder where he is, who built the Spot, what in the world all the characters thought they were up to, what the story was about in the first place, and—most of all—why anybody, even Ackerman, even Moskowitz, ever took this schoolboy novel seriously. Take equal parts of Austin Hall, Sax Rohmer and A. Merritt, add a touch of H. P. Lovecraft; shake until addled. Yield: Kinsmen of the Dragon, by Stanley Mullen. Serves 1/2. I think it was my friend Jim Blish who coined the term “idiot plot,’’ defined as a plot which is kept in motion solely by virtue of the fact that everybody involved is an idiot. Here is a delight­ ful specimen: Sir Rodney Dering, the Wise Old Man of the story, is an idiot; Franchard, its sinister villain, is a super-idiot; Eric Joyce, its handsome hero, is an idiot in spades. Behold: In the prologue, Joyce visits Dering in London (Joyce is a young American who, although the author does not say so, must have been in suspended animation since about 1920) and is conned into joining a crusade against Franchard, who—Dering tells him —is using a network of nut-cults for the purpose of “undermining what we have left of civilization.’’ Supposing Joyce to have any brain at all, he ought to ask, “Why?’’ He doesn’t, and the question never comes up; apparent­ ly it hasn’t occurred to Dering, either.\n\nIn Search of Wonder In chapter 1, we find Joyce in London again after a quick trip to Paris made off-stage. A long black sedan (typus!) swoops down; in it are Franchard and his girl friend, Darla, who spray Joyce with bullets. This seems a little odd, since Joyce has done nothing to annoy them, but he takes it as a matter of course. Franchard’s explanation is deferred until page 66, and it’s a honey: “‘I don’t know why I did it. Just a momentary impulse...’ ” The Paris trip turns out to have been equally odd. Joyce, act­ ing on Dering’s orders, has interviewed two or three people, read a couple of books in the Biliotheque Nationale, learned nothing not already known, and accomplished nothing whatever; we are left to wonder what, if anything, the trip was supposed to accom­ plish. This is partially elucidated on page 27: the trip, Dering says, has “ ‘succeeded in its main object, that of drawing their fire.’ ” This leads us to still another “Why?”, but the only answer we are going to get appears farther down on the same page: “ ‘It’s not like Franchard to be unworkmanlike. He had a sitting shot, too. ...’ ” This is not very satisfactory, but at least it’s plain enough— Dering’s object in sending Joyce to Paris was simply to get him shot dead. Neglecting the perplexing question of Darla’s motive in accos­ ting Joyce in a Paris bar, getting offended two minutes later and walking out without having altered the plot in any way, let us pass on to chapter 6. After some preliminaries designed to show that Franchard is an evil so-and-so, Dering has got the password to one of the nut-cults and sent Joyce to investigate it. Joyce witnesses a very dull ceremony, broken up in the middle by a husband with a grievance, whereupon the cult priests set fire to the place and Joyce is captured by Franchard, who remarks, “ ‘You puzzle and intrigue me, Joyce. What can you hope to gain by your childish attempts to thwart me?”’ This is a good question; a better one is, \"What attempts?” Franchard, who is telepathic and clairvoyant, then has Joyce, who knows nothing about anything, tortured to extract unspecified information from him. He is about to use scopalamine for the same purpose, when Darla rescues Joyce and turns him loose. On the way, Joyce gets a small bottle handed to him in the dark, without a word spoken. He promptly swallows its contents—which, surprisingly enough, turn out to be brandy. For all he knew, they might have been ink.\n\n18\n\nChuckleheads Following this, Joyce happens to bump into an old friend named Redwood—identified, two pages later, as a merchant seaman who has been missing and supposed dead for three years. You can tell he’s an old salt: ‘“Funny things happen at sea. ... On a ship, the captain is boss and nobody questions his orders.’ ” They escape an ambush at Joyce’s car and drive home, tailed by the usual black sedan—which, however, goes away without any further attempt on their lives. If the reader at this point has another “Why?” left in him, he can use it here. Redwood, who is really Chick Watson of “The Blind Spot” in disguise, tells a tale apparently derived from an imperfect recollection of “The Blind Spot,” “A Descent Into the Mael­ strom,” “Pellucidar,” “At the Mountains of Madness” and “The Moon Pool”; i. e., after boarding a derelict, Redwood and his companions pass through a dimensional doorway; are sucked down by a huge whirlpool; emerge in a subterranean world; wander in a city of Cyclopean horror; and wind up in the hands of a dismal gang of demonolaters headed by Franchard. Redwood is puzzled by the efforts of Franchard’s gang to drag information about nuclear physics out of their proletarian prisoners: 19\n\nBut why, since He seemed to know everything else about our world, would He not know ... about that? There was no answer.\n\n... Then, or ever. Franchard’s men, it turns out, have infiltrated an atomicweapons arsenal in Yorkshire; Joyce and two others go there to “investigate,” get caught in the middle of a pointless raid by the cultists, and retire with the score tied at zero. This brings us to chapter 13, up to which point nobody, on either side, has advanced the plot an inch. Now, however, another old friend of Joyce’s turns up: this one just happens to have a well-staffed private submarine, with which he had been planning to explore the Arctic ice. Dering, persua­ sive as ever, enlists him and his crew to find the dimensional doorway described by Redwood, and attack Franchard on his home grounds. The main curiosity here is that nobody has any notion of how the submarine crew is to get back to Earth—Redwood’s return appears to have been an accident; he doesn’t know how it happen­ ed—but this question never occurs to anybody. That isn’t all. Watch these page numbers closely: On page 261, after a battle with the cultists in the eldritch dead city, a trek up into the mountains to a city of lizard-people, and other irrelevant adventures, Joyce is interviewing a gentleman\n\n20 In Search of Wonder named Vor, the Red Archdruid. Franchard, it appears, is the Black Archdruid, and there may or may not be a third—the White —who holds the balance of power. Vor mentions casually that he has traveled between the worlds—ergo, by an easy deduction, he knows how it is done. Joyce pays no attention. On page 263, it turns out Vor’s method is “astral projection” —no good for Earthmen. Joyce still doesn’t react. On page 273, Vor volunteers the information that he can show Joyce how to return to Earth. And on page 275, Joyce asks, “ ‘Is it within your knowledge to direct us to our own world again? ...’ ” Yikh! ... At any rate, it is now about time for Joyce to be recaptured by Franchard; this accordingly happens, and we get the standard interview, during which Franchard remarks, “‘Your bungling efforts to thwart my plans have caused me no end of trouble.’ ” This, of course, is a bare faced lie. There follows a touching scene between Darla and Joyce; Darla slips her bra down to show Joyce her tattoo, incidentally, and we learn that it’s in a “hollow beneath her left breast.” Carries kleenexes there, no doubt. Some lizard-men rescue Joyce as he is about to be done in; the party climbs up a tunnel to reach Earth again (don’t ask me how this works), and we find that Franchard, at any rate, has quit fooling away his time: he is setting fire to cities at a great rate and has entrenched himself with an army on (for reasons best known to God) a small island off the coast of Scotland. Our heroes attack him here and are captured once more, just as Franchard is about to sacrifice Darla on a druidic altar; Darla, however, turns into the White Archdruid, kills Franchard, and saves the day. In the process, it would seem, she has become dangerously radioactive, but this is a minor matter; all Joyce has to do is take her down the tunnel to the subterranean world and get her cured—which, as the story ends, he is preparing to do. Try bicarbonate of soda. “This eloquent novel,” says the jacket of Taylor Caldwell’s The Devil's Advocate, making two errors in three words, “is a dramatic presentation of life in America in the not-so-distant future. It is chiefly the story of Andrew Durant and how in the year 1970 he and the incredibly brave Minute Men worked secret­ ly and ingeniously to overcome the awful tyranny of the dictator­ ship that ruled the country.\n\n21\n\nChuckleheads “The dictators were native Americans of the group that had been in power for over thirty years. ...” To be precise, for 38 years: ever since the Presidential election of 1932. Other villains, besides Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Democratic Party: farmers workers executives technicians teachers rich people\n\npsychiatrists New Yorkers cattlemen doctors liberals college students materialists\n\nagnostics, atheists scientists (“smirking”) women in men’s jobs communists in the cabinet journalists\n\nMost of these groups are fingered one at a time by Miss Caldwell in a formula which begins: “They, more than any other single group, had been responsible ...” When the reader has encountered this sentence for the eight or ninth time, he begins to wonder whether anyone is going to be left out. But not everybody is guiltier than anybody else; Miss Caldwell likes: the clergy, especially the Catholic clergy the middle class the Republican Party\n\nThe ingenuity exercised by the Minute Men in the 1970 revo­ lution is of a class familiar to science fiction readers: they infiltrate the dictatorship until, in effect, they own it. Then, avoiding the prosaic coup d’etat, which would not make much of a novel, they slyly intensify the government’s oppression until the public, which has stood with its finger in its mouth for going on forty years, Rises in its Wrath. Miss Caldwell’s style is of a piece with her plot. In narrative passages, among many other curiosities, she shows an ability to choose the word which does not merely understate a dramatic point, but mashes it completely flat: “ ... assassination of public officials proceeding by night and day” ... “hordes ... applying fire to public buildings” ... “a blow in the mouth which had removed three of his teeth.” (Italics mine.) Totalitarianism is not intrinsically a funny subject, and I am not poking fun at this writer for dealing with it, nor for her opin­ ions: Miss Caldwell to the contrary, it is not against the law in this country to be a Republican. Or a fathead, either. But it seems to me that anyone writing after Koestler on Koestler’s subject must either parrot him, as Orwell did in Nineteen EightyFour, or attempt to refute him; Miss Caldwell writes as if he had never existed—as if, indeed, no fiction but her own had been written since 1910. I don’t say it is easy to interpret this century in prose, but Miss Caldwell has not made the first step essential to the inter­ pretation of anything. She sees as in a Dewey button, darkly.\n\n22\n\nIn Search of Wonder Miss Caldwell’s second venture into the field covers a little more territory, and the catastrophe in Your Sins and Mine is more impressive: the Earth refuses to give forth its fruits; and this time, all of us are to blame. The theme is terrifying enough, and in other hands might have made a notable book. But Miss Caldwell’s ideas, like her char­ acters, areas formless as dough: the tragedy of this story is three-quarters invisible behind a comedy of errors. And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled. For these things must needs come to pass; but the end Is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines and earthquakes in divers places. But all these things are the beginning of travail. ... And because iniquity shall be multiplied, the love of the many shall wax cold. But he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.\n\nThis interpolated passage from Matthew (xxiv., 6-8, 12-13) is the basis for Miss Caldwell’s apocalyptic story. One dry spring, the fruit trees fail to blossom; the corn does not sprout, the wheat dies. Cattle grow lean; thistles invade the fields. In the farming community of Arbourville, the narrator’s father (who “was what used to be called a ‘fundamentalist’ ”) quotes Matthew to anybody who will hold still, but everybody else prefers a rosy Rotarian view. Newspapers, grange officials, heads of govern­ ments all keep up the fiction that the drought and famine are temporary, and local. As the year wears on, Jehovah’s patience with this obtuseness wears thin. New weeds of an almost Martian virulence appear. There is a plague, and a world-wide earth­ quake. The Almighty invents a brand-new insect, like a scorpion but nastier, to sting his children. “Local condition, ha-ha,” says everybody but the narrator’s pa. “Get better soon, yes sir. You bet. Got to keep smiling, boy. Keep that old chin up, shoul­ der to the wheel!” As stockpiled food begins to give out, the local farmers band together to protect their seed corn and ration themselves. A native Communist agitator shows up, unaccountably talking like a Nazi out of a 1940 novel, but is quickly suppressed; and so forth, and so on. Miss Caldwell’s explanation for all this is as follows: The land hated us, the violated land, the faithful land, the ex­ ploited and gentle land. The land had decided that we must die, and all innocent living things with us. The land had cursed us. Our wars and our hatred—these had finally sickened the wise earth.\n\nNow, the curious thing about this is that it is not in the least biblical. Fundamentalist old farmer George appears to have for­ gotten that the events referred to in Matthew xxiv. are to be fore­ runners of the second coming of Christ (an event, and for that\n\n23 Chuckleheads matter a name, not mentioned in this book). The author’s alter­ native explanation—not Christian nor even patrist—invokes the ancient Goddess variously worshiped as Dementer, Ceres, etc.— the “earth mother” aspect of the Triple Goddess. But on Christmas Eve, the Milky Way flows together into the shape of a cross, following the suggestion of Matthew xxiv., 30: \"and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven.\" (How morti­ fying for the author if it had been a crescent or a star of David instead!) At any rate, on page 115 the narrator discovers (having done it once before, on page 37, and then sat on his hands for seven chapters) that all you have to do is kneel and pray, “Lord, be merciful to me, a sinner,” and the weeds in your immediate vicinity will magically vanish, the earth be fertile again. This seems like a small price to pay, and accordingly everybody falls to. End of sermon. The moral is not obvious, except that this country’s unique theological contribution is still a wholly contemptible, watered down, dime-store religiousity. The tragedy, I suppose, is that Miss Caldwell is perfectly sincere: this saucer of weak tea really does plumb the depths of religious experience for her, and —evidently—for the “hundreds” of “priests, rabbis and minis­ ters” who are said to have written her in praise of this work.\n\nStarship Through Space, by Lee Correy, would appear to be Holt’s answer to Robert A. Heinlein’s Scribner’s juvenile series. Format and design are similar; so are the backgrounds; so is the plot—there are even recognizable chunks here from Red Planet (pages 15-18), Farmer in the Sky (page 48), Gulf (page 89), Between Planets (page 98), Universe (page 121), Methuselah's Children (page 164) and Starman Jones (page 166). The bookisn’t entirely bad. For one thing, Correy, an engineer, makes his specialty vivid and interesting; for another, he has carried the saucer mystery into space, such an obviously good idea that I suppose at least twenty writers are now kicking them­ selves for not having thought of it first. I want to say also that it’s hard not to feel guilty for being as severe as this on a first novel. Heinlein’s own first juvenile was nothing to be proud of; as for borrowing, although I think Correy has overdone it a mile, it’s damnably difficult to avoid borrowing from Heinlein, who has so much to lend. But this author has one overriding fault which makes me doubt that his second, or third, or tenth will be much better: Correy is half-literate.\n\nIn Search of Wonder Language and engineering are demanding and, perhaps, essen­ tially contradictory disciplines; again and again in science fiction we meet the engineer who knows his subject, has story-telling gifts, is ambitious and productive; can build and service a hi-fi rig—and has a seventh-grader’s understanding of that equally complex instrument, the English language. Correy has made the incredible mistake here, among others, of exposing his idea of poetry: a character named Manning,who has been writing a symphonic suite for \"a full a capella chorus, an electronic guitar section, and theremin” is persuaded to sing part of his score. There are three stanzas, of which the worst, by a hair, goes like this:\n\n24\n\nWe who have tasted alien stream And done what others only dream; We who with earth-dirt on our shoes Have walked the paths the sunbeams use; We will trod the Milky Way.\n\nOn the basis of this sample it can be definately said that Manning is a worse poet than Lilith Lorraine; the only recent entry in science fiction that even comes near it is Milton Lesser’s space-ranger song, in which “moons” is rhymed with “ruins.” But it sends Correy: “I like it very much,” Marge said. ‘‘So do I,” Walt put in. ‘‘You can sell that, Marc.” “Perhaps, perhaps,” Manning said modestly. “But my profes­ sion is astrogation. I have this sideline for relaxation. If other people enjoy it, too, I’m happy. ... What’s money? I have more personal satisfaction than any money could possibly buy me.” “I like your philosophy,” Walt said sincerely.\n\nThe plot, which concerns the construction and maiden voyage of the first starship, with the two boy heroes accompanying their Big Cheese fathers, worsens steadily. In chapter 7, Correy in­ sanely introduces a cat into a control-room equipped with Heinlein’s proximity switches. In chapter 9, there is a foolish scene when the starship comes out of “high-dive” too close to Pluto: the pilot dangerously overloads the engines to decelerate, instead of steering out of collision course. (Reminds me of Moskowitz’s ships that kept banging and clashing their way through the asteroid belt.*) And in chapter 13, about the point where Heinlein usually injects a small and palatable dose of mysticism, Correy (if a little is good,the whole bottle is better)gives us this: The starship has landed on a Centauri planet and found (sur­ prise!) people. Descendants of a forgotten Earth expedition, naturally. Not from Atlantis—that would be bad enough, but it’s out of style now, so this idiot has made the Tower of Babel into a * My mind seems to have censored this, to make it sound more credible. Actually, it wasn't the asteroid belt; it was the rings of Saturn.\n\nChuckleheads 25 spaceship. The theme is developed with more piety than wit: the Centaurians’Bible is just like ours up to Genesis xi, but entirely different thereafter, meaning that the Babel story had to be set down as a running account (“the oldest history book terrestrial man had,’’ says Correy, apparently meaning the oldest newspaper) and that the writing of Exodus and Numbers, supposed by modern scholars to have been contemporary with that of Genesis, had to wait until the babbleship had taken off and the Israelites had gone back to their goats.\n\nCHAPTER\n\nFOUR\n\nCAMPBELL AND HIS DECADE\n\nIN THE PANTHEON OF magazine science fiction there is no more complex and puzzling figure than that of John Campbell, and certainly none odder. Under his own name, beginning as an MIT student in the thirties, he wrote gadgety, fast-moving, cosmicscaled science fiction in the E. E. Smith tradition, and became, after Smith himself, its acknowledged master; as “Don A.Stuart,” he began a one-man literary revival which eventually made that tradition obsolete. As editor of Astounding, he forced the maga­ zine through a series of metamorphoses, not the least startling of which has been the evolution of its title—from ASTOUNDING Stories to ASTOUNDING Science Fiction to Astounding SCIENCE FICTION to ASTOUNDING SCIENCE FICTION, and halfwayback again. More clearly than anyone, Campbell saw that the field was growing up and would only be handicapped by the symbols of its pulpwood infancy; he deliberately built up a readership among practicing scientists and technicians; he made himself the apostle of genuine science in science fiction ... and ended as Dianetics’ number one convert and fall guy. As an editor, Campbell has never forgotten that, like a nation or an organism, the magazine which does not grow and change must wither. There have been periods, long enough to try the soul of the most faithful reader, when Astounding seemed to be dying on the vine; but always, up to now, it has turned out that Campbell was only incubating a new avatar. In the hasty, ill-composed and iU-considered introduction to Shasta’s Who Goes There?, Campbell says of the first Don A. Stuart story, “Twilight,” that “it was entirely different from any science fiction that had appeared before.” He ought to have added, “in Gernsback’s Amazing Stories or any of its successors”; so qualified, the statement would have fallen at least somewhere near the truth. “Twilight” is what Campbell says it is, a pure mood story—and as such is the lineal descendant of H. G. Wells’ “The Time\n\n27 Campbell and His Decade Machine,” Rudyard Kipling’s “A Matter of Fact” (both circa 1890), Stephen Vincent Benet’s “By the Waters of Babylon” and many others. By the late thirties, when after a long decline the oldest magazine in the field had already died and been reincarnated as a dung-beetle, magazine science fiction was fast settling to­ wards a dismal status as just another variety of pulp; Campbell’s great achievement was to rescue it from its own overspecialized preoccupations and start it back toward the mainstream of litera­ ture. Although he later tried to nudge the pendulum the other way, the movement has continued; the revolution is a success. The second Campbell-Stuart collection, Cloak of Aesir, con­ tains seven stories that justify the author’s cheerful boast: every one is a landmark in science fiction history. The gems of count­ less later stories are in them; indeed, it seems reasonable to doubt that the field ever could have developed as it has if they had not been written. All these stories belong to what might be called the “Oh, yeah?” school of science fiction, though they are so cloaked in the Stuart mood-writing and in what still seems to me, in some of them, a real beauty, that probably few people realized it till Campbell himself pointed it out. “Forgetfulness,” for instance, is nothing at bottom but an irreverent iconoclast’s-eye view of the proposition, “Machine civilization represents progress.” So is “The Machine” and “The Invaders” takes a similar look at “It would be awful if the Earth were conquered from outer space.” “The Escape” is a “tragic” love story with a happy ending—and Campbell defies you to prove it isn’t. Campbell, a capable writer, never has been a stylist, and he didn’t alter his natural prose style, with its short, blurted, agrammatical sentences, for the purpose pf creating “Don A. Stuart.” What makes the difference is partly the tone—a kind of high-pitch­ ed sing-song—and partly the point of view, a subtle thing that resists exact definition. The visual quality of every writer’s work differs somewhat from every other’s; probably it also differs, at least as widely, between one reader and the next, so that if I say that the Don A. Stuart quality, to me, is like a series of images shifting in and out of focus through a pearl-gray haze, nobody else is likely to sit up and say, “That’s exactly it,” least of all the author; readers who aren’t visually oriented will not even know what I’m talking about. But the quality does exist and, I should think, is capable of being detected in some form by almost every­ body; it’s an important factor in making these stories what they are.\n\n28 In Search of Wonder Clearly enough, the Don A. Stuart stories were only one experi­ ment among many to Campbell; but modern readers may find in these two volumes his most important and lasting contribution to the literature. People with a taste for the sharp-operator hero who flourished in American popular fiction during the thirties, and people with an insatiable appetite for bad science fiction will like Nat Schachner’s old Astounding series, Space Lawyer. I confess to a sneaking fondness for it myself; the story moves fast and simply, as mech­ anically exciting as a pinball machine; it’s wonderfully relaxing, because the author has done all of what little work there was, and nothing is required of the reader, not a moment’s thought, not even an emotional response. The formula is simply an amalgam of Mr. Tutt and Colin Glencannon, lifted bodily out of context and dumped into space. I wrote “into a spaceship” before I caught myself; actually it’s clear from internal evidence that the vessels the author calls “spaceships” are oceangoing freighters—probably windjammers, at that. No sooner had the ship blasted off than they set him to work. And what work! Scrubbing and scouring and restacking bales and cases every time the freighter took a steep curve. ... (Page 24.) ... The liner swerved toward her, and the buzzer sputtered, as the ship called for her to make radio contact. ... The liner hesi­ tated ¿with flapping sails?7, then proceeded on its course. ... (Page 137.) ... She made some rapid calculations. If she kept her rockets on to hold to a steady three-hundred-mile-a-second gait /against a contrary wind, probably/- ••• (Page 139.)\n\nAnd so forth. There’s a dramatic moment in chapter 10 when the hero, after accelerating steadily for thirty-five million miles out from Earth, turns on a dime and “retraces his steps” to rescue the heroine, becalmed in the Horse Lattitudes and about to fall into the Sun; later on we encounter a description of radio­ activity, all too obviously written when the works of A. Merritt had to serve in place of the unborn Smythe Report; but it doesn’t matter—there’s never a doubt that hero and heroine will steer safely at last through reef and shoal, in fair weather and foul, to the snuggest of all pasteboard harbors.\n\nScience-fantasy addicts ordinarily shun other forms of pulp fiction as the plague; I still remember vividly the expression of horror on the face of one of them when—being then, through no fault of my own, the editor of a Western magazine—I tried to show him a copy of something with Stetsons and sixguns on the\n\n29 Campbell and his Decade cover ... So that until July, 1938, when Astounding published a short story called “The Dangerous Dimension” few of us had ever heard of L. Ron Hubbard. Hubbard was the typus of a now-vanishing tribe of pulp-writers: like Tom Roan, who made occasional appearances in editorial offices wearing a ten-gallon hat and swearing like a muleskinner; like Norvell Page, who affected an opera cloak and a Mephisto­ phelean goatee, Hubbard lived what he wrote. Big, swaggering, and red-haired (like many of his heroes);sailor, explorer, adven­ turer; a man among men and a devil with the ladies, he cut a swath across the science-fantasy world, the like of which has never been seen again. In 1950, as the world knows, he catapulted to best-sellerdom and nationwide notoriety; a year later, trailing a cloud of law­ suits, he disappeared into the limbo of the Middle West, where, at last report, he remains. He leaves behind an undiminished throng of admirers, a few friends and, I think, a rather larger number of enemies; a growing body of legend; and upwards of ten short novels, most of them originally published in the early forties. Here are two of them, both from the 1940 Unknown. “Typewriter in the Sky” deals with the upsetting experiences of a dilletante pianist, Mike de Wolf, who is forced to live a role in a blood-and-guts pirate novel as it is written by his friend Horace Hackett—and not as the hero, either; as the villain. The world around him is one completely subject to Hackett’s whim: if Hackett says a man turns purple with rage, that’s what happens. Hackett, moreover, is a very careless writer; de Wolf, moving willy-nilly through his paces as Miguel de Lobo, admiral of the fleets of His Most Catholic Majesty in the year 1640, finds himself playing Mozart on a piano plainly marked Steinway, Chicago. ■ The plot shuttles back and forth between Hackett, clad in a dirty bathrobe, grinding out chapters to meet his deadline, and Mike, fighting desperately to change the story and avert his own inevi­ table doom. The problem is a tough one, and Hubbard does not so much solve it as slide around it: the story-within-a-story winds up with a pointless final scene involving Mike and the heroine; the dream-world dissolves in earthquake and storm; and Mike is re­ translated to the world of reality. This weakness is more than compensated for by the ending of the story itself—three immortal lines: Up there— God? In a dirty bathrobe?\n\nIn. Search of Wonder “Fear,” as the author tells you plainly in a prefatory note, is not a fantasy at all—not, at any rate, in the addict's sense. It is written as if it were; the reader is led to believe that James Lowry’s troubles stem from his having provoked the enmity of supernatural creatures, by writing an article denying their exis­ tence. And the story’s plot, certainly,is fantastic enough: Lowry, having lost four hours and his hat, wanders in search of them into one hideous underworld after another. If he doesn’t find them, he instinctively realizes, he will go mad; and if he does, he will die. The second half of this credo is quite true; the first comes a little late: Lowry is already insane. At story’s end, he regains his senses and remembers what happened during the missing four hours: finding his wife and his best friend together and misinter­ preting the circumstances, he killed them both with an axe. Haunted by his dead wife’s scream (“Jim! Oh, my God! Jim!’’) Lowry spends the two days after the murder crossing and recrossing the borderline of sanity. In his classes and at church, he is able to put up a fair appearance of normalcy. At home, re­ creates elaborate fantasies in which they speak to him, prepare dinner for him, and so on. (But he can’t eat the imaginary food, because, when he tries to do so, the plate “moves’’ under his fork.) When he returns to the cellar in which the bodies lie, twice, to dispose of the evidence, his mind retreats altogether into hal­ lucination. The first of these episodes is the most effective passage in the story: the cellar stairs become an endless stairway incredibly opening from the sidewalk in front of Lowry’s own house; he has to go down them, because each step vanishes behind as he des­ cends; and, to help him forget where he really is, he creates a series of talkative phantoms: 30\n\n'If you please, mother, can’t we come In off these stairs?” \"You can’t leave them. You walked up them, and now you’ll walk down them all the way to the bottom. You must do it, that’s all there is to it. You can sag and drag and gag and wag, but you’ve got to go to the bottom. All the way down. All the way, way, way, way, way, way, way, down! Down! Down! Down! Want some advice?”\n\nAfter the second return, Lowry drifts still further into dementia, and here we get the most specifically clinical material in the story—a paranoid rejection of reality, and a recurringcastrationanxiety fantasy in which the suppressed hatred for Lowry’s ex­ friend returns in a disguised form. “Fear” is a good story that might easily have been a great one. Parts of it are magnificently written; a few passages, like the one quoted above, are pure dream-logic and dream-poetry, as good as anything in Carroll. Others are dull or irrelevant, and large sections are unforgivably bad.\n\nCampbell and His Decade The same is true of “Typewriter in the Sky”—and, indeed, of nearly all Hubbard’s work. Chapter 4 of “Typewriter” is a satirical and very funny dialogue between Horace Hackett and another writer. Toward the end of it, having bored each other with recitals of their current plots, and damned editors, the reading public and their profession indis­ criminately, they drift into a reverent discussion of writing methods:\n\n31\n\n“Sure. You lay out the beginning and know how it’s going to end, and It wanders around as it pleases in the middle. ... “It's funny. ... I get spooky about it sometimes. It’s—well, it’s as if we were perfectly in tune with the story. We don’t have to think .about it, it just sort of comes bubbling out of us like music.”\n\nThis is an accurate description of the commonest compromise between plotting and inspiration (some writers plot everything, in minutest detail; others simply reel the stuff out, without the slight­ est notion of where they are heading) and of the ecstatic feeling it sometimes produces. Nearly all writers rely to some extent on subconscious processes to fill in the fabric of their work; the ecstasy probably has something to do with the typical writer’s well-known reluctance to do any work himself. The trouble with leaning too heavily on the subconscious is simply that it has no critical facultyjit may lead you down tempor­ arily attractive bypaths which end up miles from your story line; it tends to be prolix; it often grasps eagerly at the approximate word instead of the right one. Hubbard must have worked submerged most of the time. He wrote, we are told, on an electric typewriter, because no manually powered one could keep up with him. In this volume and else­ where, there is ample proof that Hubbard had an exquisite word sense, when he wanted to use it; and equally ample proof that he seldom bothered. These two stories—particularly the second—are monuments to a prodigal talent, prodigally wasted.\n\nConjure Wife, by Fritz Leiber, is easily the most frightening and (necessarily) the most thoroughly convincing of all modern horror stories. Its premise is that witchcraft still flourishes, or at any rate survives, an open secret among women, a closed book to men. Under the rational overlay of 20th-century civilization this sickly growth, uncultivated, unsuspected, still manages to propagate itself: “ ... I don’t do much. Like when my boyfriend was in the army, I did things to keep him from getting shot or hurt, and I’ve spel­ led him so that he’ll keep away from other women. And I kin annernt with erl for sickness. Honest, I don’t do much, ma’am.\n\n33\n\nCampbell and His Decade And it don’t always work. And lots of things I can’t get that way. “ ... Some I learned from Ma when I was a kid. And some from Mrs. Neldel--she got spells against bullets from her grandmother who had a family in some European war way back. But most women won’t tell you anything. And some spells I kind of figuer out myself, and try different ways until they work...”\n\nTansy Saylor, the wife of a promising young sociology professor at an ultra-conservative small American college, is, like most women, a witch. She is also an intelligent, modern young woman, and when her husband happens to discover the evidence of her witchcraft (not his own easy advancement, which he ascribes to luck, but certain small packets of dried leaves, earth, metal filings, etc.) he’s able to convince her that her faith in magic is compounded of superstition and neurosis. She burns her charms; Norman Saylor’s “luck” immediately turns sour. But this is not all—the Balance has been upset. This witches’ warfare ... was much like trench warfare or a battle between fortified lines—a state of siege. Just as rein­ forced concrete or armor plating nullified the shells, so counter­ charms and protective procedures rendered relatively futile the most violent onslaughts. But once the armor and concrete were gone, and the witch who had forsworn witchcraft was out in a kind of no man’s land-For the realistic mind, there could be only one answer. Namely, that the enemy had discovered a weapon more potent than battleships or aircraft, and was planning to ask for a peace that would turnout to be a trap. The only thing would be to strike instantly and hard, before the secret weapon could be brought into play.\n\nLeiber develops this theme with the utmost dexterity, piling up alternate layers of the mundane and outre, until at the story’s real climax, the shocker at the end of chapter 14, I am not ashamed to say that I jumped an inch out of my seat. From that point onward the story is anticlimax, but anticlimax so skilfully managed that I am not really certain I touched the slip-cover again until after the last page. Leiber has never written anything better ... which, perhaps, is all that needed to be said. It is no pleasure to me to make the admission, but Jack Williamson’s The Humanoids is without doubt one of the most important science-fantasy books of its decade. The story deals with a basic, immediate, and very probably in­ soluble philosophical problem. A human scientist, embittered by mankind’s ceaseless attempts to destroy itself, perfects and sets in operation the humanoids—a horde of efficient, respectful robot servants, all controlled by a single cybernetic brain, whose prime directive is, “To serve and obey, and guard men- from harm.” But the first two clauses of this commandment are slighted by the\n\n34 In Search of Wonder humanoids’ built-in interpretive mechanism; it is the third with which they are concerned, and they execute it to the last humor­ less inch. Wherever their expanding power touches, they guard men from any conceivable harm, even to the extent of depriving pathological­ ly unhappy people of their identities. The rest of the story is occupied by the frantic attempts of the inventor and others to halt this monster, and change its interpre­ tation of the prime directive so that the robots will actually serve and not rule ... up until the final episode, wherein the book’s un­ happy protagonist learns that among the small group of renegades who are cooperating with the humanoids is the inventor himself, now a convert to the robots’ present methods. The story ends on a completely ambiguous note, the question unresolved—are the humanoids, in the last analysis, humanity’s salvation or destruction? The book is important, then, because its theme is important, and because Williamson’s treatment is both honest and dramatical­ ly effective. It is also a most painstaking and conscientious job of writing, in everything from the plot structure to the pseudoscien­ tific window dressing. It pains me to admit all this, merely because the writing itself is so thoroughly, unremittingly and excruciatingly bad. Williamson has the misfortune to be an exceptionally careful craftsman who grew up in one of the crudest eras of pulp fiction. The usual technique in those days was to grab the reader by his nose at the earliest possible moment in a story and never let go: thus, the hero invariably started out in a tough situation, which got progressively worse until the last scene, when, plausible or not, the problem was solved. Williamson, as a struggling young author, earned an impressive success by applying this system more thoroughly than any of his rivals. Williamson began each story by putting his hero in app­ roximately the position of a seventy-year-old paralytic in a plaster cast who is required to do battle with a saber-tooth tiger —and, there being no place to go from there, kept him in the same predicament throughout the story, only adding an extra fang from time to time. The years have polished this technique but have not altered it much; and the effect of it upon an even moderately sensitive ear is like that of an irritating sound repeated over and over and end­ lessly over. Dr. Clay Forester, this novel’s central character, is the victim of every torment Williamson could devise for him: he is fatigued\n\n35 Campbell and His Decade to the limit of his endurance, sick with fear, frustrated by his work and his personal relationships, injured in his self-esteem by everyone around him, confronted by insoluble and vitally impor­ tant problems—and his knee hurts—; and all this, very nearly without a letup, goes on throughout the story. I read the book through for professional reasons, and came to the conclusion given above. But if I had been reading purely for pleasure, I would have breathed a prayer for Dr. Forester to break his neck somewhere during the second chapter, and turned to Dr. Doolittle.\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nCOSMIC JERRYBUILDER:\n\nA. E. VAN VOGT\n\nTHIS CHAPTER CONSISTS mainly of a long essay, originally titled “The World of van Vogt,’’ which I wrote in 1945 for Destiny's Child, an amateur magazine of Larry Shaw’s. It pre­ dates my professional book reviewing by five years, and contains numerous crudities and at least one outright error;, in spite of which it seems to belong here. The inserted passages in brackets are from a second essay I wrote later, but never published: these compare the original magazine version of The World of A with the extensively revised and rewritten book version. John W .Campbell has said editorially more than once that The World of A is “one of those once-in-a-decade classics of science fiction.’’ I offer the alternate judgment that, far from being a “classic” by any reasonable standard, The World of A is one of the worst allegedly-adult science fiction stories ever published. I’ll try to prove that assertation by an analysis of the story on four levels: Plot, Characterization, Background and Style; to be followed by a brief comment on van Vogt’s work as a whole.\n\nPlot: The World of A, like all of van Vogt’s longer work, is organized as a story-within-a-story-within-a-story—an extremely complex framework, vital parts of which are kept hidden until the end. It is, in fact, organized very much like a crime-detection novel— with two significant exceptions: that in a crime-detection novel, (a) all clues which are eventually used in solving the mystery must be given to the reader beforehand, and (b) all characters, no matter how fantastic their action may be caused to appear, must be plausibly motivated. The World of A abounds in contradictions, misleading clues and irrelevant action. Shorn of most of these, and with the nar­ ration sequence straightened out, this is what happens in the story:\n\nCosmic Jerrybuilder The original Gosseyn discovers a process whereby he can re­ produce his personality in a series of identical bodies. About five hundred years before the beginning of the story proper, one of this series of Gosseyns is mutated, developing an “extra­ brain ” * which enables him to perform apparently miraculous feats—“teleportation” and the like. This Gosseyn goes to Venus, where he discovers that an extra-Solar race of humans has esta­ blished a secret base on that planet. This base is commercial, not military, but is kept secret because its establishment is in violation of agreements made by a Galactic League. The Gosseyn, realizing that this base constitutes a threat to Sol, superintends the building of the Games Machine in an attempt to remake the Solar population into a completely sane and well-integrated race. Then he visits other star-systems, presumably via the transpor­ tation system of the aliens. When he or his duplicate-sucessor returns, he finds that a Terrestrial group, supported by Crang, Thorson and Prescott— members of the alien staff on Venus—is plotting to destroy the null-A system and the Games Machine. At the time the story begins, this group, by means of an alien invention called the Distorter, has forced the Machine to accept traitors for more than half of all executive, judicial and police positions on both Earth and Venus. The Machine knows what is happening, but is unable to broadcast warnings because of the Distorter. Thus the revolutionaries’ purpose is in fact accomplished; all that remains is to destroy the Machine and formally take control. The Gosseyn insinuates two spies into the traitorous group: Patricia Hardie, daughter (?) of President Hardie (chosen for that post by the Machine under the influence of the Distorter) and “X,” a mutilated duplicate Gosseyn. Then he brings to life an­ other duplicate, Gosseyn I, who is the first protagonist of the story. Gosseyn I’s memory has been tampered with, as presum­ ably the others’ have also, and he does not suspect his true iden­ tity. Gosseyn I is now maneuvered by the dominant Gosseyn in such a manner that he comes to the attention of the traitors, who believe for some reason that he is tremendously dangerous to them. It is never stated just who they think he is, but one clue (page 38, first instalment) suggests that they take him for the first mutated Gosseyn, the one who discovered the base on Venus and traveled among the aliens. At any rate, they torture him in an effort to find out what he knows; he escapes; they follow and kill him. „ . Gosseyn II comes to life on Venus, with all the memories of Gosseyn I except of what he had been told (false) about his iden37\n\n*By this puzzling word van Vogt, no grammarian, seems to mean simply \"an extra brain. ”\n\n38 In Search of Wonder tity. An agent of the Games Machine picks him up, tells him to allow himself to be recaptured by a certain member of the gang, which he does. The gang brings him back to Earth. He escapes, is recaptured, and the gang decides not to kill him again. He goes to the Machine, which tells him that he must kill himself, in order that Gosseyn III, whose extra-brain is fully developed, may come to life. He tries to do so, but meanwhile the Mach"
