It's dreadful old garbage by any reasonable critical standard, and yet it has a dreamlike conviction which has endeared it to generations of readers. The works of van Vogt, which have provided so much escapist joy, are among the great embarrassments of modern SF.\" - Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction, second edition (1995), p. 427.
