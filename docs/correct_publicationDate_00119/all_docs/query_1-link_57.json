        "text": "The (long overdue) results of the 2021 Cosmos Prize\n\nThe round-robin novel Cosmos was the product of a scheme orchestrated in 1933 by a young Raymond A. Palmer, then editor of the fanzine Science Fiction Digest. This remarkable feat of amateur publishing involved the recruitment of sixteen professional authors, each of whom contributed a chapter loosely developed from a plot outline provided by Palmer. We’ve written extensively about Cosmos, especially on the The Cosmos Project website.\n\nWhile Cosmos represented an impressive achievement in influence and coordination, the resulting fiction was somewhat predictably irregular — and in some cases, terrible. In 2020, we launched a writing contest that sought to address what we saw as the worst flaw. The final chapter, contributed by none other than Edmund Hamilton, fails to draw together the previous elements in the story and left us entirely unsatisfied.\n\nSeveral authors stepped up to offer alternative conclusions to the novel. We announced the winners and published their submissions in 2021.\n\nThe success of this contest led us to initiate a sequel. The 2021 Cosmos Prize was established as encouragement for artists to illustrate two parallel round-robin works, both titled The Challenge From Beyond. Ten prominent professional authors wrote chapters based on the title — five for a science fiction version, and five for a fantasy version. The results were published in the September 1935 issue of Fantasy Magazine. You can read the works as they originally appeared here.\n\nWe were delighted when Sara Light-Waller, winner of the 2020 Cosmos Prize, also submitted a terrific entry for the 2021 prize. We then waited anxiously for other aspiring and/or accomplished artists to take up the Challenge… From Beyond. We’ve had numerous expressions of interest, but no further credible submissions.\n\nIt’s past time to give Sara her due. We’re pleased to present her four illustrations. The first three capture scenes and characters from the science fiction version of the story, written by Stanley G. Weinbaum, Donald Wandrei, Edward E. Smith, Ph.D., Hal Vincent and Murray Leinster. She created two full renderings for this story. Page numbers are as they appeared in the original fanzine, where numbers spanned multiple issues in a volume. (Click the images for expanded views.)\n\nSara also provided a spot illustration for a key character who first appears on page 216. She notes that this image would likely appear early in a printed version of the story.\n\nSara submitted just a single illustration for the fantasy version of Challenge From Beyond, written by C.L. Moore, A. Merritt, H.P. Lovecraft, Robert E. Howard, and Frank Belknap Long, Jr. Her exceptional work on this piece recalls for us the style of Virgil Finlay.\n\nCongratulations to Sara! As the winner of the 2021 Cosmos Prize, she’ll receive $300 in cash and copies of The Visual History of Science Fiction Fandom.\n\nStay tuned to First Fandom Experience for more news about our continuing work to bring to life the history and impact of science fiction fandom.\n\nIntroducing Volume Three of The Visual History\n\nFrom the Introduction:\n\nIt was the best of fandom. It was the worst of fandom.\n\nHistorians may be inevitably drawn to the Dickensian contrapuntal.\n\nScience fiction fandom in 1941 played out in a panoply of wisdom, foolishness, belief and incredulity. Less mired than previous years in the economic shackles of the Great Depression, fans let loose in ways both expected and surprising.\n\nThe year began with a bang – the noisy implosion of the ascendant Queens Science Fiction League, torn apart by rancor among New York factions stewing since 1938. In early December, fans in America were forced to face the threat of imminent dystopia as insidious products of science and engineering rained down on sailors at Pearl Harbor.\n\nBetween these bookends, fans read and wrote and gathered and argued and published in profusion – mostly in good humor.\n\nThe perennial questions persisted. What’s the purpose of the fiction we inhale like oxygen? What role do fans play in the world? Are we somehow better than others? What’s the point of organizing? Perhaps these debates were reason enough to come together.\n\nFans flocked together. Small but vibrant clubs coalesced in Boston, Minneapolis, northern New Jersey and central Michigan. Regional gatherings established communities and annual conferences that still endure.\n\nFans initially believed the shocking report of the suicide of Earl Singleton, the tall handsome poet who so impressed them at the Chicago Worldcon in 1940 – and were incredulous when his demise was revealed to be a cynical prank.\n\nThe Futurians of New York had been a hotbed of controversy, publishers of variously literate invective and often maudlin poetry. As the calendar turned, many members of this loose confederation found footholds in the professional ranks. As editors of short-lived pulps, they published stories penned by their friends. As authors, some launched careers that would last a lifetime.\n\nFanzines flourished. Some fans lamented the deluge. As always, quality varied widely. Stalwarts such as Harry Warner, Jr. (Spaceways and Horizons), Jack Speer (Sustaining Program) and Julius Unger (Fantasy Fiction Field) consistently published high-quality issues. The Fantasy Amateur Press Association met its goal of four quarterly mailings, each stuffed with a few gems and a collage of miscellany.\n\nFan artists matured, raising the bar for the quality of illustration gracing amateur publications. The impressive work of Lou Goldstone and Roy V. Hunt could well have led to careers in art but did not. British fan artist Harry E. Turner’s contributions to wartime fanzines laid the foundation for his later work as a designer and graphic artist.\n\nBetween their frequent parties, the dynamic Los Angeles fan community produced a monthly avalanche of material. Voice of the Imagi-Nation served as the hub of fan correspondence from America, the UK, Canada and Australia. The group pioneered the wider use of lithography for art reproduction and fostered a growing base of professional authors. The year saw the pro debut of Ray Bradbury, the emergence of Leigh Brackett and the ascendance of Robert A. Heinlein. A mysterious woman from San Francisco burst on the scene and captured a prominent fan’s heart – but his ardor was doomed to be unrequited.\n\nThe westward migration of the World Convention to Denver led to epic adventures on the byways of America. (Highways were yet to be constructed.) From Oregon came young Damon Knight, driven to Denver by his parents. From Riverside, California, teenager James “Rusty” Hevelin hitchhiked. Captivated by fans from the east, neither went home.\n\nThe Denver Worldcon would be the last until 1946. Fans didn’t know this at the time, but they debauched as though they did. Traditions established the prior year in Chicago did more than survive the trip, highlighted by an extravagant masquerade. As Guest of Honor, Robert Heinlein led the audience to “The Discovery of the Future.” Forrest J Ackerman would later dub this the most outstanding conference address he heard in his fifty-plus years as a fan.\n\nBritain endured the Blitz of nightly Nazi firebombs. Fans scattered from the cities but stayed in touch. A small cadre maintained a steady pace of correspondence and publishing. At the center was J. Michael Rosenblum, deemed “contemptable” by an American peer for his stance as a Conscientious Objector. Other Brits took up arms despite a hatred of war. A Nuneaton fan accused his hobby of urging him to the front lines: “It is difficult to call to mind an outstanding fantasy not built up on one or all of the ideals of battle, murder & sudden death. The red gods of war have never had stronger propagandists than the writers of fantasy.”\n\nMore than ever, the experience of fans in 1941 offers a view of the human experience of that time. In the US, journeys from the coasts to the heartland and back were set amidst evolving attitudes regarding the present and the future. In Britain, the terrible potential of science came in the dark – yet fans’ inherent optimism survived. Young fans were inspired by those who came before, evidence of the enduring appeal of hope, imagination, speculation and the camaraderie of like-minded fellows.\n\nOur mission at First Fandom Experience is to bring to life the evolution and impact of science fiction fandom. The passion and work of early fans laid the foundation for the pervasive influence that science fiction and fantasy exert today. Their words and pictures deserve to be remembered as they were written and drawn. In their voices, we hope their optimism, joy and energy speak to you as they have to us.\n\nExhaustively researched and profusely illustrated, this 500-page hardcover volume was introduced at the Windy City Pulp and Paper Convention, April 5, 2024.\n\nClick here to order!\n\n1946 Project Wrap-Up: We Had Fun!\n\nDuring Chicon 8, First Fandom Experience had the privilege of organizing the 1946 Project. The program track encompassed sixteen panels and presentations:\n\n1946: A Year in the Life of a Fan\n\nThe Life and Impact of C.L. Moore\n\nThe Life and Work of A.E. van Vogt and E. Mayne Hull\n\nTitus Groan: Genre or Not?\n\n(Click for a great summary by moderator Dave Hook.)\n\n1940: The First Chicon\n\nUndiscovered and Forgotten Gems of 1946\n\nRemembering Erle Melvin Korshak\n\nLeading Ladies: Women in Fandom in 1946\n\nHow Did Atomic Weapons Change Science Fiction?\n\nThe SFF Art and Artists of 1946\n\nExtinction and Evolution: The 1946 SFF Book Publishing Boom\n\nScience in Science Fiction: The Guesswork of 1946\n\nJames Kepner and Edythe Eyde:\n\nPioneering LGBTQ+ Activism in 1940s Los Angeles Fandom\n\nThe Likely Hugo Nominees From 1946\n\nRay Bradbury’s Preposterously Productive 1946\n\nHow the 1946 Pacificon Saved Post-War Worldcons\n\nThanks up front to the First Fandom Experience team, without whom we couldn’t do any of what we do. John L. Coker III and Sam McDonald act as principle historians, supported by Doug Ellis. We’re proud to have been recognized by the Chicon organizers as Heroes of the Convention.\n\nFan Guests of Honor Joe Siclari and Edie Stern, curators of the remarkable Fanac.org archive, provided invaluable guidance and material in support of the project. Mark Olson, shepherd of Fancyclopedia, worked with us to create a display of fanzines distributed at the 1940 Chicon.\n\nWe’d like to thank all of the terrific panelists who lent their expertise and insight to one or more of these sessions:\n\nExtra special thanks to Convention Chair Helen Montgomery, Program Division Head Nchanter, Exhibits Division Head Benjamin Levy, and their great teams — for their outstanding collaboration and support.\n\nAlso, we offer deep appreciation to Stephen Korshak, the son of Erle Korshak, Fan Guest of Honor (sadly departed prior to the con), and Dean Ziff, nephew of Mark Reinsberg. As high school students, Erle and Mark were the co-organizers of the 1940 Chicon. The presence of their descendants at the panel discussing that first Chicago convention added a moving sense of history.\n\nA last-minute surprise addition to the 1940 Chicon panel was a showing of recovered sections of the assumed-lost film, “The Monsters of the Moon.” A version of this 1930s stop-motion monstrosity was viewed by attendees of the first Chicon. Restored by “Dr. Film” Eric Greyson and hot off the presses, special guests Bruce Lee and Mindy Grayson shared the six-minute space opera with an amused and appreciative audience. (The film is available as part of a collection offered on DrFilm.net.)\n\nTo inform our program, we published a series of blog posts with historical context on SFF and fandom in 1940:\n\nScience Fiction and Fantasy in the Pulps: 1946\n\nScience Fiction and Fantasy in Books: 1946\n\nThe Fan Cave, c1940s\n\nA Year in Fandom: 1946\n\nA Vote for van Vogt in ’46\n\nWhat Can We Learn From the 1946 Pacificon Program Book?\n\nA Year in the Life of a Fan: Joe Kennedy in 1946\n\nRay Bradbury’s Preposterously Productive 1946\n\nIn addition, we assembled an exhibit representing the den of an active fan from the 1940s, drawn from fans’ published descriptions of the period — perhaps most directly, Bob Tucker’s essay from Le Zombie in June 1940.\n\nThe star of the den exhibit was an (almost) functional 1920s A.B. Dick Number 77 Model A mimeograph machine. This particular make and model was common among fan publishers of the day, including Tucker. Also featured were full facsimiles of 1940s fanzines and a collection of reading pulps. The (mostly) working period typewriter and the guestbook tempted some visitors to leave thoughtful messages.\n\nAt the show, we introduced a new book: The First Chicon is an excerpt from The Visual History of Science Fiction Fandom, Volume Two: 1940. This slim-but-rich 9×12 softcover includes the key chapters from the full volume that cover the 1940 Chicon in depth. (The book will be available soon for order on this site.)\n\nFirst but not least, at the Opening Ceremonies David was honored to accept the First Fandom Posthumous Hall of Fame Award on behalf of August Derleth, founder of Arkham House.\n\nWe now turn our attention back to our core mission: the completion of The Visual History of Science Fiction Fandom. We hope to have Volume Three out in the first half of next year, with a focus on the very-important year of 1941. The series will (may) conclude with Volume Four, covering 1942 – 1946. Our work on the 1946 Project has already set us up with a rich base of research and material regarding that also-very-important year.\n\nThanks for all of the great conversations and support at Chicon 8.

Bradbury was not surprised – he was beginning to send his remaining weirds to magazines that were publishing his fantasies – but the story was saved by a most unlikely chain of events. Truman Capote, who was then as editorial apprentice at Mademoiselle, was at loose ends one day in the late winter of 1946 and found the story on the floor of the fiction editor’s office. He read it, loved it, and recommended it to Rita Smith, his editor. Soon Bradbury found himself working closely with the magazine’s staff as his story became the centerpiece of a ghoulish October 1946 issue complete with a Charles Addams illustration.”\n\nFrom Ray Bradbury, The Life of Fiction by Jonathan R. Eller and William F. Touponce, The Kent State University Press, 2004\n\n“In 1946, I wrote a short story called “Homecoming” and I sent it to Weird Tales, but they sent it back to me. They refused to give me fifteen dollars for it. I had a hunch that I should try a big magazine like Mademoiselle. So, I sent it off and they held it for two or three months, not knowing what to do with it, because I had created this vampire family, which was very strange. ‘Homecoming’ was about a big celebration of all of these vampires. They finally bought the story, and they got Charles Addams to illustrate it. I was beginning to create my family and Charles Addams was starting to create his family. I went to New York, this time on the train. I arrived in New York City and met the editors at Mademoiselle Magazine.”\n\n“I saw the wonderful illustration by Charles Addams for ‘Homecoming,’ which was a double page spread. I loved it so much that I bought it from him. It was three hundred dollars. I didn’t have it, so I bought it on time. I gave Charles Addams twenty dollars a month and bought that painting. So, when my novel From the Dust Returned came out two years ago, I had that cover which I bought fifty years ago and kept all that time and finally gave it to my publisher and you see it on my book. Charles Addams and I planned to do a book together. But, nobody wanted the idea, so we separated. He went his way with his family and I went my way with my family, and we had two separate careers.”\n\nRay Bradbury, from the Introduction to TALES OF THE TIME TRAVELERS, 2009, edited by John L.

We also want to understand what it was like to spend that year as an active fan.\n\nOne of the most prolific and well-regarded fans was Joseph Charles “Joe” Kennedy. His remarkable 1946 is worthy of note, if not entirely representative of how most fans passed their year. Born August 21 1929, he turned just 17 in the Fall of 1946 — but ranked among the most accomplished fans of the period.\n\nIn January 1946, Milton A. Rothman provided a guide to fannish activities, intended to provide something of a “Fandom 101” for new adherents. Originally published in The National Fantasy Fan (v5n1, January 1946), the essay identified eight primary activities in which serious fans engage.\n\nKennedy pursued all of these to some degree, but he was most prolific in writing and publishing for the fan community. His primary effort, Vampire, had run for four issues in 1945 and was already recognized as a leading fan publication. The full extent of his output throughout 1946 is, to us, impressive.\n\nJanuary\n\nJanuary 1 — the very dawn of 1946 — Kennedy joined a gathering at the New Jersey home of Sam Moskowitz. This was the second meeting of the self-designated “Null-A Men,” satirically named after the controversial novel by A.E. van Vogt. As Moskowitz noted in The 1946-47 Fantasy Review, “The initial idea of a loosely knit, social group was abandoned when 10 fans showed up… The idea of an organizational meeting was expanded into a full-fledged convention.” This was the origin of the “First Post-War Eastern Science Fiction Convention,” which would convene in March of that year.\n\nAlso at the start of 1946, Kennedy issued the first of his ambitious yearbooks, The 1945-46 Fantasy Review. Weighing in at 48 dense pages, this review of the field and fandom included a rich summary of fan events during the year, as well as poll results ranking books, stories published in the pulps, professional authors and fan journalists.\n\nAs a member of the Vanguard Amateur Press Association (VAPA), Kennedy published Joe’s Jottings. This ‘zine primarily featured commentary on VAPA and the contents of the mailings, with occasional poetry and short fiction by Kennedy and others. The January issue was sparse — unsurprising given Kennedy’s other activities.\n\nFebruary\n\nKennedy and his frequent collaborator George R. Fox published Speculations, a fanzine that lasted only a single issue. It featured articles by Sam Moskowitz, an original radio play by John H. Cooper, and a “Composite Readers Report on TTTT Number Three.” This last was a summary of reviews of Fox & Kennedy’s humor fanzine Terrible Test Tube Tales that ran for three issues in 1944 and 1945.\n\nMarch\n\nOn March 3, Kennedy attended the First Post-War Eastern Science Fiction Convention at the Slovak Sokol Hall in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nApril\n\nVampire, Kennedy’s primary and most ambitious fanzine, saw its fifth issue in April 1946. Most dramatic was a to-and-fro between Sam Moskowitz and August Derleth concerning the publication of The Outsider and Others.\n\nThe fourth issue of Joe’s Jottings boldly proclaimed itself as “The Magazine of Cultural Americana” — but delivered only more commentary on VAPA and an odd poem by Dale Hart.\n\nJune\n\nThe sixth issue of Vampire appeared in June 1946 with a stunning cover by fan-artist John Cockroft.\n\nSeptember\n\nOn top of all his activities in fandom, Kennedy began his higher education in Fall 1946, attending Seton Hall.\n\nKennedy also attended the September 8 meeting of the newly-revived Queens Science Fiction League in 1946, and submitted this article on the club to Fantasy Times.\n\nThe fifth issue of Joe’s Jottings also appeared in September, featuring more of Kennedy’s cartoon rendering.\n\nLast but not least, the seventh issue of Vampire was issued in September. The macabre cover by Walt Kessel was titled “Morning After the Convention.”\n\nOctober – November\n\nFor the October 1946 mailing of the Fantasy Amateur Press Association (FAPA), Kennedy inaugurated his membership in the Association with the first issue of his fanzine Grulzak. With minor exceptions, the 18 pages were entirely written and illustrated by the editor.\n\nOn October 27, Kennedy attended the Philadelphia Conference, a revival of the annual event that had been on hold since 1941. He quickly penned and published his account of the proceedings, issuing his Expose!! A Kennedy’s-eye View of the Philly Conference dated November 2.\n\nIn the November 1946 issue of The Scientifictionist, Kennedy contributed a four-page article titled “Utopias Made to Order.” He poses the eternal question facing fans of speculative fiction:\n\n“So we have, in fandom, two seemingly opposing schools of thought: one which foresees a bright future for the human race, and recommends that fandom do everything within its power to aid social and scientific progress; and the other, which adopts a sort of philosophical resignation to the aimlessness of life and the utter lack of meaning of the universe. Which, then, to choose?”\n\nDecember\n\nThe final 1946 issue of Vampire featured a remarkable cover by St. Louis fan-artist Van Splawn.\n\nIn addition, Kennedy cooked up another offering — though we’ve been unable to track down any copies. In 1950, he wrote:\n\nJanuary 1947\n\nAt the dawn of 1947, Kennedy delivered his 77-page omnibus, The 1946-47 Fantasy Review, cited throughout our work on the 1946 Project.\n\nReputation Realized\n\nKennedy was recognized at the time by his fellow fans. In a poll published in July, Kennedy ranked fifth as Top Fan Poet and fourth as Top Fan Editor. His fanzine Vampire placed fourth among its peers.\n\nIn Kennedy’s own poll published in The 1946-47 Fantasy Review, Vampire was ranked tops of the fanzine pantheon.\n\nRecognition, well deserved.\n\nKennedy’s later career was (is) impressive as well. As “X.J. Kennedy,” he is a widely-read and much-awarded poet and author. As with other prominent fans, his early days as an active amateur publisher helped to prepare him for a prominent life in letters.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Joe Kennedy and his contributions to fandom? Please drop us a note!\n\nWhat Can We Learn From the 1946 Pacificon Program Book?\n\nThe next in our series of posts in support of the 1946 Project at Chicon 8.\n\nThe Front Cover\n\nThe Los Angeles fan community in 1946 boasted an impressive range of talent, and lead the way in innovative publishing. The landscape format of the 8.5×5.5-inch program was novel. Fan-Artist Lou Goldstone designed the book overall and rendered the striking lithographed cover.\n\nGoldstone was a regular contributor of art to fanzines. His own 1941 title, Fantasia, featured his illustrations, fiction and poetry. His jacket design for the 1948 Fantasy Publishing Company’s volume Death’s Deputy by L. Ron Hubbard bears macabre resemblance to the Pacificon program cover.\n\nThe Membership List\n\nOne hundred and fifty-eight (158) fans are noted as contributing the $1 membership fee to the convention. (This isn’t an attendee list. Later accounts indicate actual attendance at about 120.)\n\nThe roster primarily includes fans from across the United States, as well as a smattering of family members and other adjunct supporters. We count 23 women. Notable professionals include Leigh Brackett, David H. Keller MD, Robert Bloch, Robert Heinlein, J. Harvey Haggard and Jack Williamson. Perhaps the most surprising: Fritz Lang, director of the iconic fan-favorite Metropolis (1927). Forrest J Ackerman described Lang’s 1944 visit to his home:\n\nThe Welcome Page\n\nThe membership fees covered “over 50% of the expenses” — implying the the event cost something around $300 to put on.\n\nThe Philadelphia Science-Fiction Society Announced Their Bid\n\n(The PSFS Conference held in October 1946 was a highlight of the year for East Coast fans. We now know that Philadelphia was awarded and hosted the fifth World Science Fiction Convention in 1947, the first Philcon. There was no opposition to their bid.)\n\nThe Ackerman Family Ads\n\nThe Ackerman family supported their own. Full-page ads in the program cost $4, so this was another way to fund the convention. Forry’s quirky sense of humor seems genetic. Forrest’s brother Alden was killed in action in January 1945. We have no idea why his father would refer to Alden as “one of the cleanest boys I have ever known.”\n\nThe International Shout-Out\n\nAckerman maintained ties with fans overseas through regular correspondence. His tribute to foreign fans includes a greeting in his beloved Esperanto.\n\nThe First Two Days\n\nThe Fourth of July in 1946 fell on Thursday. The four-day program concluded on Sunday, July 7.\n\nA single program track, like the previous three Worldcons. Distribution of badges. Welcome from Russ Hodgkins. The Guests of Honor address. The inevitable auction, inevitably run by Erle Korshak. A presentation of a recording of Robert Bloch’s radio show, “Stay Tuned For Terror.”\n\n(What’s not revealed by the Program: the “Special Session” presented by Ackerman and Laney was a pitch for the Fantasy Foundation (working code name: “Operation Futurian”). This was intended as something of a “Master Library of Fantasy Fiction,” mostly comprised of Ackerman’s collection. The idea never took root. Sadly, following this presentation, Ackerman nearly collapsed from exhaustion and the flu, and missed the rest of the convention.)\n\nOn Day Two, an offsite visit to the “Ackerman Museum” (prior to its designation as the “Ackermansion”)… (was cancelled due to Ackerman’s illness.)\n\nA “Weird Session,” in honor of the fans of fantasy and horror — a growing cadre in fandom, with Francis T. Laney’s impressive fanzine The Acolyte as a rallying point. A one-man show by stage personality “Brother Theodore.”\n\nThe Last Two Days\n\nFun at Westlake Park (now MacArthur Park), but no baseball game. The National Fantasy Fan Federation (NFFF). The masquerade. Impromptu music and dancing. (Rothman, Leibscher and Perdue at the piano. Liebscher’s performance was dubbed the “Pacificoncerto.” Rothman played “Ritual Fire Dance.” Tigrina sang her original, “The Sabbath Summons.”)\n\nDay Four: Another offsite at the West Coast reincarnation of Michigan’s Slan Shack. Bidding for the next convention (Philadelphia won; see above). The “Fanquet.”\n\nOn Sunday, the afternoon session featured a presentation not on the program, a sobering speech by a representative of the Federation of Pasadena Scientists on civilian control of atomic energy.\n\nH.P. Lovecraft’s “The Dunwich Horror” was delivered via a recording of the radio drama aired on November 1 1945 by the CBS Radio series, “Suspense.” (This was actually played on Saturday the 6th, rather than Sunday the 7th. Audio is available here.)\n\n(The “Surprise Fantasy Film” was to have been “Turnabout,” but the film was unavailable. “One Million BC” was substituted.)\n\n(We’re unsure of the identity of the woman with the tall headdress mostly hidden behind Dale Hart. Cay Forester was an actress hired to portray “the girl we’d most like to be wrecked on the moon with.” Jack Speer described her as “unutterably bored to everyone except the photographer.”)\n\nThe Guests of Honor Took the Centerfold\n\nWhy van Vogt and Hull in ’46? The husband and wife were having a capstone year. Ackerman later recalled:\n\nSomething happened prior to the convention that is not known. We had a committee of five fans, and it was our duty to decide who should be the guest of honor. I had a novel notion and said that, for the first time, we should make the guest of honor a woman — Catherine Moore. She was a very well-known author in science fiction. I said we should also get Margaret Brundage, the popular artist for Weird Tales. I said we should get a major female fantasy fan and a female fantasy fanzine publisher and a female assistant to one of the professional magazines. Someone spoke-up and said that we couldn’t have Catherine Moore by herself without her husband, Henry Kuttner. I said that Kuttner should be proud that his wife was the professional guest of honor. Three votes were needed to vote in favor of my idea, but it lost. There were only two votes to see it my way. In the end, A. E. Van Vogt and his original wife Edna Mayne Hull were made the guests of honor.\n\nFrom the 2006 Worldcon in Anaheim. Recorded and transcribed by John L. Coker III.\n\nSupport Came From Across the Land\n\nThe Pro Mags Chimed In\n\nAckerman Still Held a Torch\n\nIn 1945, Forrest J Ackerman proposed marriage to fellow fan Tigrina (Edythe Eyde) by posting an open letter in a fanzine (FANews, n166, June 19 1945). Tigrina rejected the proposal in equal measure in the same publication (FANews, n170, July 3 1945). Despite this very public and embarrassing exchange, Forry and Tigrina remained friends. For Ackerman, it seems perhaps there was still hope. One key reason for Tigrina’s rejection became clear in 1947 when she began publishing the first Lesbian magazine in the country, Vice-Versa.\n\nAspirations Were Put Forth, But Not Achieved\n\nFandom Remembered\n\nWell-regarded Los Angeles fan Paul Freehafer joined the Science Fiction League in 1937. He published the fanzine Polaris and served as Treasurer for the Pacificon. Freehafer passed away from a heart condition in 1947 at age 27. By tradition, the LASFS Clubhouse is known as “Freehafer Hall.”\n\nOne Ad Was the Coolest\n\n…though it’s not entirely clear what this group was advertising.\n\nWhat can we learn from the 1946 Pacificon Program Book? Please drop us a note with your thoughts:\n\ninfo@firstfandomexperience.org\n\nA Vote for van Vogt in ’46\n\nThe next in our series of posts in support of the 1946 Project at Chicon 8.\n\nAs part of the 1946 Project, we’ll focus on the work of Alfred Elton “A.E.” van Vogt and his fellow author (also spouse) Edna Mayne Hull. Why so?\n\nvan Vogt is recognized as a Grand Master, having received the fourteenth instance of the Damon Knight Memorial award in 1996. He’s also regarded as something of an odd-duck, his work drawing a wide range of reactions.\n\nPhillip K. Dick and Harlan Ellison credited van Vogt’s The World of Null-A as an early inspiration. In contrast, Damon Knight tore all aspects of that same novel to shreds, writing, “[van Vogt] is no giant; he is a pygmy who has learned to operate an overgrown typewriter.” (From the fanzine Destiny’s Child, November 1945).\n\nIn van Vogt’s 1975 autobiography (assembled from interviews he gave in the 1960s), he wrote: But then again, Knight later wrote: “Other writers may be able to work on intuition, but I can’t. In other words, here I am living on things. One is that there are methods for doing things and the other is that I dream my story ideas in my sleep.”\n\nResponding to this revelation, Knight reconsidered his perspective on the author, writing: “van Vogt has just revealed, for the first time as far as I know, that he made a practice of dreaming about his stories and waking himself up every ninety minutes to take notes. This explains a good deal about his stories, and suggests that it is really useless to attack them by conventional standards. If the stories have a dream consistency which affects readers powerfully, it is probably irrelevant that they lack ordinary consistency.” (Science-Fiction Studies, v1n3, Spring 1974)\n\nWe submit that 1946 was a capstone year for the authors, where their prominence and influence on the genre and fandom may have been at its peak. What supports this assertion?\n\nvan Vogt’s prominence had been growing since he captured the front cover of Astounding with his first published science fiction story, “Black Destroyer” in July 1939. John W. Campbell, Jr. chose to lead with this tale over Isaac Asimov’s first Astounding appearance in that same issue.\n\nThe novel Slan, first serialized in Astounding beginning in September 1940, made a major impression on fans of the day. The sympathetic portrayal of a persecuted race of human mutants with extraordinary powers caused fans to ask the question, “Are fans Slans?” In the post-war publishing science fiction boom that began in 1946, van Vogt’s Slan was issued in book form by Arkham House. The novel was rated third in Joe Kennedy’s fan poll from January 1947.\n\nvan Vogt’s second novel, The Weapon Makers, was widely praised by fans after its serialization in Astounding in 1943. That same year, the author ventured into the fantasy genre with The Book of Ptath, appearing in Unknown Worlds in October. Plans were announced in 1946 for the publication of The Book of Ptath by Fantasy Press (1947) and The Weapon Makers by the Hadley Publishing Company (1947).\n\nKennedy’s 1946 fan poll rated van Vogt second among favorite authors, following only Henry Kuttner in popularity. “The Chronicler” (Astounding, October 1946) was ranked ninth among stories published in magazines.\n\nHull had appeared regularly in Astounding under her own name (“E.M. Hull”) beginning in December 1942 (“The Flight That Failed”). She captured her first cover in the December 1943 issue with “The Debt,” part of a series featuring rapacious future businessman Artur Blord. Her work also appeared in Campbell’s Unknown Worlds, sometimes alongside that of her husband.\n\nvan Vogt’s The World of Null-A appeared in Astounding beginning in August 1945. The controversial novel was much-discussed among fans for its embrace of “non-aristotalian philosophy,” sometimes described as “fuzzy logic.” It was ranked first in Kennedy’s fan poll for 1945.\n\nFollowing their move to Hollywood in November 1944, van Vogt and Hull became involved with the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society (LASFS). van Vogt regularly attended meetings of the group and spoke at several events in 1946.\n\nvan Vogt was a Guest Speaker at the January 10 1946 “Atomicon,” a gathering of the LASFS to discuss the beginning of the “Atomic Age.” He offered a novel idea regarding the potential benefits of atomic energy.\n\nvan Vogt and Hull appeared at the 1946 World Science Fiction Convention in Los Angeles (the first Pacificon) as the Guests of Honor.\n\nWhat works of van Vogt or Hull stand out for you? Which have best stood the test of time? How have these writings influenced the genre? Please drop us a note with your thoughts:\n\ninfo@firstfandomexperience.org\n\n(The title of this post is informed by the best analysis we’ve seen of the proper pronunciation of “van Vogt.”)\n\nA Year in Fandom: 1946\n\nThe next in our series of posts in support of the 1946 Project at Chicon 8.\n\nWhat was it like to be a science fiction fan in 1946?\n\nThere was a lot of new material to read. With the end of the war, Science fiction and fantasy pulps had proliferated. Classics genre novels from pulps of prior years were issued in book form. Just keeping up was a challenge.\n\nFan activity was also resurgent. The club scene remained most active in Los Angeles and New York, but fans from other corners also made their voices heard. Several clubs formed prior to the war resumed meeting in 1946, often attracting a mix of old and new members.\n\nThe timeline presented here is drawn from a variety of sources. Primary among them is Joe Kennedy’s 1946-1947 Fantasy Review, the second in his series of yearbooks covering the field. Eleven pages were dedicated to the doings of fans.\n\nOne event to which fans ascribed importance bears further exposition: the September 1946 article in Harper’s Magazine by William S. Baring-Gould titled “Little Superman, What Now?” Baring Gould had been corresponding with fans for some time, reading fanzines, and attending gatherings. Most importantly, he joined the First Post-War Eastern Science Fiction Convention in March as part of his research, and commented on the meeting in his article. This was the most accurate and deep portrayal of organized fandom to have appeared in the mainstream press to that point. We provide the full piece here.\n\nFans published extensively in 1946. Core members of the community returned from service to find a wide range of fanzines, many with heightened standards for prose, fiction and art. We’ve tabulated the most notable titles, omitting some one-shots and likely missing a number of more obscure publications (especially from VAPA). For these 69 fanzines, we count approximately 316 total issues for the year.\n\n(Titles in bold italic debuted in 1946. Titles followed by Roman numerals provide disambiguation per the Pavlat-Evans Fanzine Index.)\n\nStay tuned for more highlights from our exploration of science fiction and fandom in the very busy year of 1946.\n\nThe Fan Cave, c1940s\n\nThe next in a series of posts in support of the 1946 Project at Chicon 8.\n\nThe “experience” component of “First Fandom Experience” conveys our desire to capture what it was like to be an early fan. To date we’ve dedicated the most space to fannish interactions — clubs, correspondence, conventions, conflicts. But fans spent most of their time at home. Those fortunate enough to have even a semi-permanent residence literally papered their walls with the accumulated evidence of their devotion to science fiction.\n\nA few prominent fans allowed us to peek into their sanctum sanctori. The earliest narrative tour we’ve found came from Wilson “Bob” Tucker in his fanzine Le Zombie from June 1940.\n\nTucker aspired to create a décor in which one could “picture yourself out in space.” Other inspirational adornments were more terrestrial. Common to all the accounts we’ve encountered, he cites “the ever-present desk, bookcase, table, mimeograph…”\n\nAs to the mimeograph: most fans that published had one, or access to one. By 1940, the arcane and messy chemistry-project of hectography had generally given way to the more-predictable and mostly-monochrome stencil-and-crank world of the mimeo.\n\nTucker’s essay inevitably sparked responses. Joe Gilbert of Columbia, South Carolina shared his “proletarian” retreat in the September-October 1940 issue of Le Zombie.\n\nIn the May 1941 issue of The Science Fiction Fan, prolific fan publisher Harry Warner, Jr. provided a detailed inventory of the “business part” of his workshop.\n\nThen and now, fans have surrounded themselves with their closest “friends” — the books and magazines that offer escape from the confines of their room, their house and their planet.\n\nIn stylish contrast, British fan Ron Holmes presented the astonishing notion that a collection isn’t something a true fan actually requires.\n\nWhat would you have expected to see if you’d visited the home of a fan in 1946? What adorns your fannish shrine? Please drop us a note with your thoughts:\n\ninfo@firstfandomexperience.org\n\nScience Fiction and Fantasy in Books: 1946\n\nContinuing our series of posts in preparation for the 1946 Project at Chicon 8.\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, an explosion of genre book publishing brought science fiction and fantasy closer to the mainstream. However, new novel-length fiction was scarce, so the vast majority of titles issued in 1946 looked back, republishing material from prior years.\n\nThanks to one prolific fan, we have a contemporaneous view of fandom’s favorites from this period. In January 1947, New Jersey’s Joseph Charles (“Joe”) Kennedy published the 1946-1947 Fantasy Review, the second in his series of yearbooks covering the field. Along with his own perspective, Kennedy presented the results of a survey that captured the opinions of 78 fans of the day. Caveats apply; e.g. the sample appears to be entirely from the United States and Canada — but the poll offers at least one window into sentiments at the time.\n\n(Joe Kennedy went on to a notable career as an author and poet, writing under the name X.J. Kennedy.)\n\nThe scoring system for fans’ favorites weighted the results based on respondent’s rank-ordered choices.\n\nThe results are presented below. From Kennedy’s notes, those marked with (*) weren’t actually published in 1946 but are included to reflect the fans’ full responses.\n\nThe runaway first and second place finishers were representative of the dominant trend in genre books issued in 1946 — they’re anthologies of short stories. Adventures in Time and Space received more first-place votes (39) than all of the other titles combined.\n\nIn 1946, Random House was already a leading mainstream publisher. The omnibus Adventures featured 35 stories, mostly by current leading authors from both North America and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe mention of science fiction fan clubs in the jacket notes would seem to indicate that the publishers hoped to reach both established and new readers of the genre. Regarding the latter group, Kennedy opined that there was “public demand for escape literature in the face of the grim reality of the atomic age.”\n\nBack leaf, Adventures in Time and Space, Random House, 1946\n\nFrom Crown Publishers came The Best of Science Fiction, with a preface by John W. Campbell, Jr. This 785-page tome included “40 wonderful stories, unlike any other kind of stories you have ever read.” Did established fans take offense at the implication that nobody knew of science fiction prior to this book? Were they prepared to welcome novice readers into the sanctum of their speculative refuge? It’s easy to imagine both reactions.\n\nThe Crown title presented a wider historical sampling of the field than the Random House anthology, including stories by Edgar Allan Poe, H.G. Wells and John Taine, as well as then-recent works by Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov.\n\nEstablished fantasy publisher Arkham House scored three titles in the top ten in Kennedy’s poll. Two were anthologies: the first collection of Robert E. Howard’s fantasy stories, Skull-Face and Others, and The House on the Borderland and Other Novels, the first American book publication of William Hope Hodgson’s imaginative fantasy. Both volumes featured striking covers by Hannes Bok.\n\nArkham House had a busy 1946, also releasing The Hounds of Tindalos, an anthology of Frank Belknap Long’s stories from Weird Tales; The Doll and One Other by Algernon Blackwood; Fearful Pleasures by A.E. Coppard; and West India Lights by Henry S. Whitehead.\n\nArkham’s third top-ten book represented another category with multiple examples in 1946. Slan by A.E. van Vogt was a re-publication of the author’s novel originally serialized in Astounding Science-Fiction beginning in December 1939. The tale of a superior mutant sub-species of humans, hunted for their difference — the “X-Men” of its day — spurred the meme “Are fans Slans?” that has persisted in fandom to present times. Van Vogt was particularly visible to the fan community in 1946 as the Guest of Honor at the first Pacificon held that year.\n\nSimilarly, the newly-formed Buffalo Book Company’s The Skylark of Space presented the epic E.E. “Doc” Smith space opera from 1928, updated by Smith from its premier run in Amazing Stories. The same publisher also issued the collected installments of John Taine’s 1931 Wonder Stories serial The Time Stream.\n\nReprints of “classic” genre novels also gained attention from the fans who responded to Kennedy’s poll. Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World reached a new audience through a 1946 edition from Harper & Row. Abraham Merritt’s The Ship of Ishtar made the list based on a 1945 Avon Book Company digest of the 1924 fantasy novel.\n\nSome classics reappeared in paperback, reflecting the rapid expansion of that format. A new edition of James Branch Cabell’s Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice from 1919 appeared as a paperback from Penguin Books. Abraham Merritt’s epic 1920 fantasy The Metal Monster received a reboot as a title in the “Murder Mystery Monthly” series from the Avon Book Company.\n\nThe Fox Woman and The Blue Pagoda from the New Collector’s Group was in the vanguard of a wave of fan-lead publishing efforts that grew in 1946. Artist Hannes Bok (Wayne Francis Woodward) and Paul Dennis O’Connor orchestrated this volume collecting an unfinished story by Abraham Merritt and Bok’s attempt to finish the tale.\n\nTitle page from The Fox Woman and The Blue Pagoda. Art by Hannes Bok\n\nAppropriately rounding out Kennedy’s top ten, Avon Ghost Reader is the fan-favored example of the dominant sub-genre for books issued in 1946 — anthologies of ghost stories. Titles abounded, including And the Darkness Falls from World Publishing Company, containing 59 stories and ostensibly edited by Boris Karloff.\n\nWholly new novel-length genre titles were scarce in 1946. A notable exception was The Murder of the USA by Murray Leinster, writing as Will F. Jenkins. Published in book form by Crown Publishers with a preface by John W. Campbell, Jr., the tale also appeared in the June 1946 issue of Argosy as Atoms Over America.\n\nAlso new in 1946 was the dark comedic novel Mr. Adam by Pat Frank. The original J.B. Lippincott edition ran for thirteen printings. The cover of the 1948 Pocket Books reprint revealed the book’s sardonic take on post-nuclear dystopia.\n\nIn 1959, Frank would pen a less humorous portrayal of atomic aftermath: Alas, Babylon.\n\nProminent science fiction fan Wilson “Bob” Tucker’s debut as a novelist appeared in 1946 — but not as a genre title. The Chinese Doll was the first of Tucker’s mystery novels. Despite the departure in subject matter, his fellow fans recognized his success with two first-place votes.\n\nPeabody’s Mermaid by Guy and Constance Jones (Random House) merits a mention as the basis for the 1948 film “Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid,” starring William Powell and Ann Blyth.\n\nNotably absent from Kennedy’s poll results are two important fantasy works issued in 1946. Mervyn Peake’s Titus Groan, first of the Gormenghast series, has since been recognized as a highlight of the genre. Fans in North America may not have seen this work due to its initial publication in the UK by Eyre and Spottiswoode. The allegorical Mistress Masham’s Repose by T.H. White (Putnams) examines authoritarianism through the tale of a girl’s encounter with Lilliputians.\n\nNot widely available to fans in North America were two paperbacks from London’s Pendulum Publications LTD, issued as entries in their “Popular Spacetime Series.” Wings Across Time by Frank Edward Arnold was a reprint of a story that originally appeared in Science Fiction Quarterly in 1942. Other Eyes Watching by John Russell Fearn (writing as Polton Cross) was new in 1946.\n\nAlso below fans’ radar was the Junior Literary Guild’s publication of The Angry Planet by John Keir Cross. “Living creatures — individuals — Martians!” Blatant indoctrination of youth into fanciful speculation!\n\nWhich science fiction and fantasy books from 1946 have you encountered?
