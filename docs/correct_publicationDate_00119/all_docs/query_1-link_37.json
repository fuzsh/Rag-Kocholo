        "text": "It’s going to be a while before I finish the thick books I’m reading now and there’s not going to be any weird fiction postings this next week.\n\nYou know what that means: a dive into the archives where I found this Retro Review from 2005.\n\nReview: The Annotated Tales of Edgar Allan Poe, ed. Stephen Peithman, 1981.\n\nThis is an indispensable collection of Poe’s short fiction, and Peithman’s annotations are actually useful.\n\nI will discuss only those stories having a fantastic element.\n\n“Introduction”, Stephen Peithman — A pretty good introduction to Poe’s life and the critical reaction around him. Of course some revere him. Others see him as lacking substance, particularly “no human interest” (critic W. C. Brownell’s words) which is false on the face of it. Poe obviously has a lot of human interest given his keen interest in depicting aberrant states of human psychology and perception. What Poe lacks is modern mainstream literature’s obsession with particular characters. Poe’s interest, as befitting a proto-sf writer, is in characters as types and representatives of man in general. Peithman quotes a bunch of famous writers and critics on Poe. Peithman does note Poe’s keen interest in women but seeming lack of sexual desire. He may not have consummated his marriage to his thirteen-year-old cousin. In his last month of life, he became a temperance man. Of course, his death is shrouded in mystery. Peithman speculates that occasional hoaxster Poe deliberately chose Rufus Griswold as his literary executor knowing that Griswold’s deliberate besmirchment of his reputation would keep his name and reputation alive.\n\n“Metzengerstein” — Peithman’s introduction says this is the tale of Poe that is closest to the German Gothic tradition. He also notes the presence of the theme of transmigrating souls in several of Poe’s other works besides here. Peithman helpfully notes Poe’s inspirations and source materials as well as cinematic adaptations of the story.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview: Null-ABC, H. Beam Piper and John J. McGuire, 1953.\n\nIt’s a world where department stores launch armed attacks on their competitors. Elections have gangs who beat up and occasionally kill the opposition. (And, if you don’t have your own gang, you can rent one.) Technology has stagnated. High school students assault their teachers regularly. And most of the population is illiterate.\n\nYes, there’s a Crisis in 2140. That was the better titled selected for the novel when it was republished as part of an Ace Double in 1957. It was originally serialized in the February and March 1953 issues of Astounding Science Fiction, and I suspect editor John W. Campbell gave it a title reminiscent of A. E. van Vogt’s Null-A series which ran in Astounding in the 1940s.\n\nThe work is part of a group of 1950s science fiction novels dealing with the theme of anti-intellectualism. They include Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and Fritz Leiber’s The Silver Eggheads (which I have not read). Like another such novel, James Gunn’s The Burning, it features a population that blames historical problems on intellectuals, and, in particular, has reacted against that basic intellectual tool: literacy.\n\nThere has always been, on the part of the Illiterate public, some resentment against organized Literacy. In part, it has been due to the high fees charged for Literate services, and to what seems, to many, to be monopolistic practices. But behind that is a general attitude of anti-intellectualism which is our heritage from the disastrous wars of the Twentieth and Twenty-first Centuries. Chester Pelton has made himself the spokesman of this attitude. In his view, it was men who could read and write who hatched the diabolical political ideologies and designed the frightful nuclear weapons of that period. In his mind, Literacy is equated with ‘Mein Kampf’ and ‘Das Kapital’, with the A-bomb and the H-bomb, with concentration camps and blasted cities.\n\nYes, in this society literacy is so rare – but still a necessary skill – that Literates have their own union, the Associated Fraternities of Literates. And men like Chester Pelton, owner of a department store, resent that their skills are needed. And he can do something about it. He’s a senator in the North American Confederacy.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nTimeslip Troopers and The Martian Epic got me interested in the works of Théo Varlet. So, as I usually do when reading more deeply in an author’s work, I sought his short fiction first.\n\nReview: The Germans on Venus and Other French Scientific Romances, ed. and trans. Brian Stableford, 2009.\n\nAs laid out in his “Introduction”, this is the second anthology of French science fiction or, more properly, roman scientifique that Stableford has done for Black Coat Press.\n\nUnlike the first, which attempted to define and show the “fundamental pattern of development” of the French roman scientifique, Stableford merely seeks to come up with representative samples from the entire period of the genre. Unintentionally, it ended up being somewhat biased towards humorous stories, he says. When authors defend themselves against the charge of absurdity by being absurd, their narratives are pushed to the limits.\n\nFollowing the turmoil of the French Revolution, propagandizing for progress was harder. The skepticism about the benefits of progress and the perfectibility of human society was a common theme. Many of these stories have the theme that Isaac Asimov dubbed the “Frankenstein complex”: no good can come from technological progress. Stableford’s “editorial sieve” wasn’t interested in the “more pragmatic aspect of antitechnological sentiment” because that’s rather mundane in the context of science fiction. He opted for the more extreme and interesting cases. And, of course, some stories touch on the growing conflict between society and religion which, in the roman scientifique, played out in two distinctive ideas not seen much in American science fiction or the British scientific romance: the “plurality of worlds” and cosmic palingenesis – the transmigration of souls.\n\nI’m not going to mention much about the background of each writer, but Stableford does introduce each story with a useful literary biography of its author, their place in the roman scientifique, and any probable influences on their work.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nMy look at Stableford’s work continues.\n\nReview: The Sociology of Science Fiction, Brian Stableford, 1987.\n\nIn Chapter IV, “The Expectations of the Science Fiction Reader”, Stableford tries to discover what sf readers get out of the genre. He looks at three questions: what sf readers say they get out of the genre, how the various definitions of sf serve as rules for composing sf works, and what writers and apologists of sf say about the genre’s function and value.\n\nStableford argues that the whole question of science fiction as a genre is that reading a work of sf is different than reading another sort of novel. That’s what defines the genre. He quotes Darko Suvin as defining a genre as a system of expectations, based on prior reading experience, of a particular type of material. Even innovations in the genre are just an evolution of expectations based on past experience with sf.\n\nWhat are those expectations? To get an idea, Stableford turns to the letters columns of sf magazines. There are a couple of methodological problems with this acknowledges Stableford.\n\nThese are, first of all, a self-selected sample, and, of course, not all the letters received were printed though Stableford notes early sf pulps frequently had letters insulting certain stories.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nReview: The Plurality of Imaginary Worlds: The Evolution of French Roman Scientifique, 2nd Edition, Brian Stableford, 2016, 2017.\n\nThis is Stableford’s companion to his four volume New Atlantis series on British scientific romances.\n\nAs usual, Stableford writes in a clear way with some nice turns of phrase though he lets some of his snarkiness and sarcasm show at times.\n\nThe book starts out in 1657 with Cyrano de Bergerac’s Histoire comique des États et Empires de la Lune [Other Worlds] and goes through 1939. Because of World War Two, little French work was published in the 1940s. Like the British scientific romance, it was subsumed into the dominant American mode of science fiction after the war.\n\nStableford mentions, as did James Gunn’s in his Alternate Worlds, some of the genres that fed into sf/roman scientifique: traveler’s tales (le merveilleux), imaginary voyages, utopias, and satires. (He talks about how French censorship of books meant many were published with bogus foreign printing information and under pseudonyms.) However, a unique French element was what Voltaire coined contes philosophiques. The interest in telling “fay stories” in the French court also played a role.\n\nStableford divides his analysis by historical eras and themes within them.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nOur next stop in the Night Land.\n\nEssay: The Starcombers, Edmond Hamilton and The Year When Stardust Fell, by Raymond F. Jones, 2012.\n\nI would never have known that Edmond Hamilton wrote something possibly influenced by William Hope Hodgson’s The Night Land if Andy W. Robertson hadn’t mentioned this novel at his Night Lands website. (Robertson even quotes Hamilton on Hodgson.) I would have guessed, if any pulp writer paid homage to Hodgson’s creation, it would have been, judging by the title alone, Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore’s Earth’s Last Citadel – except I’ve read that novel and the only thing Hodgsonian is the title.\n\nHamilton is in his gritty mode in this 1956 story. His characters are tough and treacherous, his spaceships lived in.\n\nLike his “What’s It Like Out There?”, it initially questions the value of humans being in space.\n\nThe titular starcombers are scavengers with four spaceships. They have their families with them. Harry Axe (which is a good name for a raider and scavenger) is on his second wife, Lucy. She comes on to men, including protagonist Sam Fletcher, out of what seems to be vain need to have her physical attractions validated. She manages to seem almost naked even in a spaceman’s coverall. Continue reading →\n\nAnd it’s more Charles Sheffield.\n\nRaw Feed (1994): Proteus Combined, Charles Sheffield, 1994.\n\nAn omnibus of Sheffield’s Proteus series.\n\nSheffield is known as a hard sf writer and has written some good hard sf – he’s certainly got the technical background for it.\n\nHowever, I suspect (like James Gunn’s The Immortals) this story owes more to some fanciful playing with dubious, but popular notions of biomedicine than real science. Here Sheffield takes the 70’s notion of biofeedback to a bizarre level: the human form can actually be changed with the help of computerized biofeedback.\n\nIn Sight of Proteus, Sheffield develops the idea while wending a way through a complicated plot involving secret and illegal form manipulation for the benefit of man and space travel and alien contact.\n\nThere are catalogs that cater to fashion in forms, form change to prolong life, illegal forms that hero Bey Wolf searches out for the government, and conflict over the use of forms (“spacers” don’t like them), and the redefining of humanity as someone who can use biofeedback equipment at an early age.\n\nI liked the plot element with some humans – under the influence of illegal form change equipment – being contaminated with Logian viral DNA and changing into aliens. Loge – and I have no idea if the purported pre-1975 science listed is real – is the planet that supposedly existed (according to Bode’s Law and evidenced by the asteroid belt and the calculated origin point of some comets) between Mars and Jupiter. Aliens lived on it as evidenced by transuranic elements. Continue reading →\n\nI’m not resuming my James Gunn series yet, but I happen to come across this story in a recent issue of Analog.\n\nReview: “The Little Sailboat”, James Gunn, 2019.\n\nThis is a “Probability Zero” story. That’s an Analog feature of short-short stories. Many are humorous. Some, like this one, are fabalistic or outside of Analog‘ usual scope of hard science fiction.\n\nGunn, in Crisis!, was operating in science fiction guru mode. This is Gunn operating in, unfortunately, in sort of an Elijah mode.\n\nA man builds a sailboat in his driveway. However, the driveway is “hundreds of miles from the nearest ocean”.\n\nSince this story is sort of a combination of “The Little Engine That Could” and the building of Noah’s Ark, the sailboat is personified as “the Little Sailboat”, and neighborhood boys mock the Little Sailboat as they pass.\n\nAs men, these boys do all sorts of reprehensible things. They “cooked large slabs of meat on charcoal grills, drank cold beer, and ran their air conditioners”. Continue reading →\n\nThe James Gunn series continues.\n\nReview: “Pest House”, James Gunn, 1996.\n\nThis was Gunn’s 64th story. Michael R. Page’s Saving the World Through Science Fiction puts the composition date at 1957. As of the 1996 publication date of The Unpublished Gunn, Part Two, it was his last unpublished story. Page says it was also the last piece of fiction Gunn wrote until the late 1960s.\n\nThis was a story aimed at the “slick” science fiction magazine market. Gunn defines that market as having\n\na more general theme, a setting in the not-too-distant future, and an idea that did not present serious difficulties for an unsophisticated readership.\n\nLike “Jackpot for Julie” and “The Man with One Talent”, I don’t discern any flaws that would have made its publishing questionable. Page says the story would have undoubtedly been published if the science fiction magazine market had not collapsed in the late 1950s. Continue reading →"
