        "text": "Lord of Light\n\nBy Roger Zelazny,\n\nFrom my list on hard science fiction by old masters.\n\nBy Stefan Vučak Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI became hooked into science fiction as a kid the day I read an illustrated book of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. From then on, science fiction became an important part of my reading repertoire. Having wide-ranging interests, I enjoy military techno-thrillers, Anglo-French naval warfare, Greek/Egyptian/Roman mythology, most sciences, history of religions, with an occasional novel that strays from the norm and adds a sparkle to my reading. Mary Stewart’s The Crystal Cave and The Hollow Hills are very close to my heart. Just shows that I’m different. After all, I must do something when I am not writing my own novels! Although I have an extensive library of modern science fiction works, I am fond of many oldies.\n\nStefan's book list on hard science fiction by old masters\n\nWhy did Stefan love this book?\n\nThis book epitomizes all the qualities a hard science fiction story should have, and which many fail to achieve. I found the theme enthralling - men turning themselves into gods, and the scenario frighteningly plausible.\n\nI love this story because it deals with real characters and doesn’t spare their flaws. I sympathized with the main character, a man prepared to battle heaven for freedom, shunning the mantle of godhood. This novel not only entertained but also forced me to think, something I relished.\n\nOnce started, this work is difficult to put down and I nodded with satisfaction when I turned the last page.\n\nBy Roger Zelazny,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n7 authors picked Lord of Light as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nImagine a distant world where gods walk as men, but wield vast and hidden powers. Here they have made the stage on which they build a subtle pattern of alliance, love, and deadly enmity. Are they truly immortal? Who are these gods who rule the destiny of a teeming world?\n\nTheir names include Brahma, Kali, Krishna and also he who was called Buddha, the Lord of Light, but who now prefers to be known simply as Sam. The gradual unfolding of the story - how the colonization of another planet became a re-enactment of Eastern mythology - is one of…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Hammer and the Cross\n\nBy Harry Harrison,\n\nFrom my list on historical fiction or fantasy about the Viking Age.\n\nBy Peter Gibbons Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI developed a passion for history as a child in Warrington, Cheshire. I would lose myself in tales of Achilles, Alexander, King Arthur, and King Alfred the Great. My love of the Viking Age became nurtured through visits to Viking exhibitions like the Yorvik centre in York, and Dublinia in Dublin. The catalyst for my first book, Viking Blood and Blade, was a trip to the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark. That museum holds a full-size Viking warship, which is truly breathtaking. I have published seven historical fiction novels set in the Viking Age, and I hope you enjoy the books on this list as much as I have…\n\nPeter's book list on historical fiction or fantasy about the Viking Age\n\nWhy did Peter love this book?\n\nI read this book whilst I was a teenager, and although it is an alternative history book, the depiction of Viking Age Britain, and the Vikings themselves had me hooked.\n\nThe battles and characters hook you in, and there is just enough of a fantasy element thrown in to make this novel almost perfect.\n\nBy Harry Harrison,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Hammer and the Cross as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn an alternate history set in A.D. 865, Shef, son of a Norse raider and an English lady, tries to carve out a kingdom of his own in England, while Christian kings and Viking worshippers of Asgard battle for the country's dominion.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Holmes-Dracula File\n\nBy Fred Saberhagen,\n\nFrom my list on Sherlock Holmes mash-ups.\n\nBy Christian Klaver Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nMy name is Christian Klaver, and I’ve had, in turn, many different jobs as a bookseller, martial arts instructor, and bartender before settling into a career in internet security. Books have always been a passion of mine, with science fiction, fantasy, and mystery as my main focus. I’ve been a lifelong fan of Sherlock Holmes and am a proud member of two different Sherlock Holmes Societies.\n\nChristian's book list on Sherlock Holmes mash-ups\n\nWhy did Christian love this book?\n\nThe story unfolds with sections both from Watson and Count Dracula and is just a great deal of fun.\n\nSaberhagen wrote an entire series starring Dracula, but this one, with Holmes in it, is the best of the lot and Saberhagen does some really fun, fun things with the conflict between the two.\n\nBy Fred Saberhagen,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Holmes-Dracula File as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n1887, London, Victoria’s Jubilee -- criminals threaten to release thousands of plague infested rats on the day of celebration. The extraordinary powers of the Count and sharp mind of the Master Detective team up to avert a catastrophic public disaster. (And, the reader discovers more than a deerstalker hat and an Invernes Cape in Holmes’ family closet.)\n\nPreview\n\nAwfully Appetizing\n\nBy Leod Fitz,\n\nFrom my list on authors you probably haven’t heard of.\n\nBy Jason R. Richter Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs a not well-known writer of science fiction, that grew up reading speculative fiction novels by not very well-known authors, I want to shine a light on the more obscure corners of my bookshelf. Neil Gaiman and Arthur C. Clarke and Robert Jordan get plenty of press. They don’t need any help. This is a list of authors that I don’t think enough people are talking about. And it’s a shame, because all of them have a lot of really interesting worlds to explore. Enjoy.\n\nJason's book list on authors you probably haven’t heard of\n\nWhy did Jason love this book?\n\nI hear you saying to yourself, “Please, recommend another book by a dead guy, Jason!” Well, sorry to disappoint, but this recommendation is from a living author. I’m actually a huge fan of this guy and he’s still alive putting out books. Awfully Appetizing follows Walter, a ghoul (undead carrion eater), that was raised by humans. Walter runs a funeral parlor where he disposes of bodies in the secret war between the werewolves and the vampires in a Colorado college town. The writing is funny. The characters are great. If you like the Harry Dresden books by Jim Butcher, you’ll love Awfully Appetizing.\n\nBy Leod Fitz,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Awfully Appetizing as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nWalter Keppler is a quiet, private man. He lives in a trailer park at the edge of town, and is working hard to pay off the startup loan he needed for his funeral home. In his spare time, he likes to camp, fish, and eat roadkill.\n\nWalter Keppler is a ghoul, raised by humans. He’s one of the many monsters who calls the town of Collinswood Colorado home, but he’s spent most of his life struggling against his darker nature, and trying to stay as far away from the rest of the creatures of the night as he possibly can.…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Small Pleasures Of Life\n\nBy Philippe Delerm,\n\nFrom my list on which you may have never heard anything.\n\nBy Richard Hernaman Allen Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve gone to France often during my life. I always buy books that look interesting while I’m there, mainly to keep my French in good shape. I tend to pick authors and subjects which catch my eye. Some get discarded, but most give a fascinating and often very different perspective on life than I find in English novels and essays.\n\nRichard's book list on which you may have never heard anything\n\nWhy did Richard love this book?\n\nThis is an excellent series of essays on the small things in life which please the author. Some are more obvious than others, but all are described stylishly and with typical French humour and elegance. I confess that after reading it, I did my own—inevitably inferior—version. But it was an enjoyment just going through the process.\n\nBy Philippe Delerm,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Small Pleasures Of Life as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn enchanting celebration of life's small pleasures, this little book captures the French imagination and art of living a good life.\n\nEach chapter features a small pleasure that is both uniquely Gallic and universal. From the smell of apples maturing in a cellar to the gentle whir of a bicycle dynamo at dusk to turning the pages of a newspaper over breakfast, to the joy of a snowstorm inside a paperweight . . .\n\nRecounted with a lively, innocent curiosity about the little things that make life worthwhile, this is an unforgettable, absorbing read to be savoured at length by…\n\nPreview\n\nBram Stoker\n\nBy Barbara Belford,\n\nFrom my list on dive deeper into Dracula.\n\nBy Hans C. De Roos Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI saw Francis Coppola’s movie Bram Stoker’s Dracula in 1992, but studied the novel only after I created a photo story, The Ultimate Dracula (Munich, 2012). Next to the images, my book presented the true location Stoker had in mind for his fictitious Castle Dracula (No, not Bram Castle), and the historical person he referred to while speaking about Count Dracula (No, not Vlad the Impaler). The next steps were discovering the true locations of Carfax and the Scholomance, unraveling the backgrounds of the Icelandic and Swedish versions of Dracula, and unearthing the first US serialization. I simply love to solve riddles. By now, I am organizing international Dracula conferences.\n\nHans' book list on dive deeper into Dracula\n\nWhy did Hans love this book?\n\nBarbara Belford’s 1996 book is one of the classics in its field, next to the Stoker biographies by Harry Ludlam, Daniel Farson, and Paul Murray. With a background in journalism, Belford created a very readable introduction to Stoker’s life. Her book still is an invaluable source for fans and scholars trying to understand the making of Dracula. It is a good stepping stone for readers who would like to dive deeper later on, e.g., by studying David Skal’s more recent work, Something in the Blood. For me personally, it gave me a very colorful image of Stoker’s life and helped me better understand him as a person and an author.\n\nBy Barbara Belford,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Bram Stoker as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis biography draws on unpublished archival material to explore the links between Stoker's life, his vampire tale, and the political, occult and sexual concerns of the 1890s. It shows how Stoker's friendship with Henry Irving led to his life being overshadowed by Irving's achievements.\n\nPreview\n\nA People Betrayed\n\nBy Alfred Doblin, John E. Woods (translator),\n\nFrom my list on for understanding the Weimar Republic.\n\nBy Terrence Petty Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nWhile growing up in a Vermont town in the lower Champlain Valley, I became fascinated with the wealth of nearby historic sites dating from the French and Indian War and the American Revolution. Within easy reach of our family station wagon were Fort Ticonderoga and more. I became especially intrigued by German mercenaries hired by the British to fight the American colonists. My interest led me to become a history major at the University of Vermont, and eventually to Germany as a correspondent for The Associated Press. I worked and lived in Germany from 1987-1997, covering the toppling of Communism, the birth of a new Germany, the rise of neo-Nazi violence, and other themes.\n\nTerrence's book list on for understanding the Weimar Republic\n\nWhy did Terrence love this book?\n\nAlfred Döblin, one of the most consequential German authors of all time, is best known for his gritty, modernist Weimar-era novel Berlin Alexanderplatz. Often overlooked are two works of historical fiction by Döblin, A People Betrayed,and Karl and Rosa. Set in Berlin during the November 1918 proletarian revolution, these two books are epic in scope, employing both real and fictional characters to tell of the violent beginnings of the Weimar era, a foreshadowing of the political and social fissures that would plague Germany’s first postwar democracy and ultimately set the stage for Hitler’s rise to power.\n\nBy Alfred Doblin, John E. Woods (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked A People Betrayed as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNovember 1918. The First World War is over, the battle is lost a and everywhere there is talk of revolution. Leaders of the German military have formed an uneasy alliance with the socialists who control the government and have proclaimed a new German republic, but throughout Berlin rival groups stage rallies and organize strikes. In A People Betrayed, the first volume of the epic November 1918: A German Revolution, Alfred Doblin takes us into the public and private dramas of these turbulent days, introducing us to a remarkable cast of fictional and historical characters, and bringing them to life in…\n\nPreview\n\nRites of Spring\n\nBy Modris Eksteins,\n\nWhy did Elliot love this book?\n\nThis book is beautiful even as its subject is ugly: how the shock of the Great War led inexorably in Germany to the rise of Hitler.\n\nI loved the aesthetics of this book. Eksteins begins by transporting us back to Paris, sitting us in the audience on opening night in May 1913 for Stravinsky's ballet The Rites of Spring, which caused mayhem because of the wild dance techniques and jarring music. Eksteins then takes us on a journey through the culture of Weimar Germany as Berlin seized the title of Europe's cultural capital from Paris.\n\nI was enraptured by the dizzying esthetics of modernism, dada, surrealism, and other, punctuated bursts of artistic trends, both celebrated and opposed, in a right-wing backlash that had real-world consequences. Ekstein's thesis convinced me counter-intuitively that Hitler and Nazism were connected in the irrational conglomeration of birth and destruction, first introduced by Stravinsky.\n\nThis book…\n\nBy Modris Eksteins,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked Rites of Spring as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNamed \"One of the 100 best books ever published in Canada\" (Literary Review of Canada), Rites of Spring is a brilliant and captivating work of cultural history from the internationally acclaimed scholar and writer Modris Eksteins.\n\nA rare and remarkable cultural history of World War I that unearths the roots of modernism.\n\nDazzling in its originality, Rites of Spring probes the origins, impact, and aftermath of World War I, from the premiere of Stravinsky's ballet The Rite of Spring in 1913 to the death of Hitler in 1945.\n\nRecognizing that “[t]he Great War was the psychological turning point . .…\n\nPreview\n\nBefore the Court of Heaven\n\nBy Jack Mayer,\n\nFrom my list on WWII era that explore conflicts on the home front.\n\nBy Joe Kilgore Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always been enamored with the World War II era. It was a time that seems virtually non-existent today, where almost everyone in my country was on the same page. There seemed to be a collective commitment to the struggle. An agreement that this was indeed good versus evil. Of course, I’m sure its nostalgic allure is much greater for those of us who didn’t actually have to live through it. But the strength, perseverance, and everyday heroism it brought out in soldiers and civilians alike, deserves to be chronicled and remembered forever.\n\nJoe's book list on WWII era that explore conflicts on the home front\n\nWhy did Joe love this book?\n\nMost of this novel’s action occurs between World War I and World War II. It’s the riveting tale of a young German crushed by his country’s defeat and dedicated to doing something about it. He joins a network of assassins and aids in the murder of a high-ranking Jew in the Weimar government. Sent to prison, he meets a unique individual and begins an acute reexamination of everything he’s previously believed. This is a passionately compelling tale of one man looking deep within himself to make sense of what he’s done with his life. The author brings the times, as well as his characters vividly to life and makes this chronicle of redemption a supremely fulfilling read.\n\nBy Jack Mayer,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Before the Court of Heaven as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nHistorical Fiction based on a true story of Weimar Germany and the rise of the Third Reich.
