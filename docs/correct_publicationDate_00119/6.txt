Seller Rating:

Soft cover. Condition: Very Good. 2nd Edition. Every classic SF library needs A.E. van Vogt's "The World of Null-A". And the version you actually want to read is the author's 1970 revision, originally published as a Berkley Medallion paperback, which included a new introduction, new content, and some needed tweaks. Offered here are BOTH a 1st printing of that 1970 Berkley Medallion paperback PLUS the 1990 Ariel Press first trade paper edition of the revised version. The paperback is in very good+ condition. Its binding is tight with slight lean and no crease in the spine. Its covers are unmarked with some light age toning and a few traces of soiling. Its pages are unmarked. The Ariel trade paper is in near fine condition, unread, marred only by a nearly imperceptible smudge on the front cover where a store price sticker was removed. Its binding is tight and square, with no reading creases. Its covers are unmarked, unworn and bright (neither toned nor faded.) Its pages are unmarked and unworn. Not a remainder. As with all Space Age Book purchases, I will ship these books in a moisture proof zip-loc bag, padded in bubble wrap, inside a sturdy box to assure they reach their proud new owner in the same condition as my description. Bibliographic note: the ISBN in this listing is for the Berkley Medallion paperback. The ISBN for the Ariel Press book is 0898041538. Seller Inventory # 000990
