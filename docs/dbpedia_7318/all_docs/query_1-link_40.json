        "text": "Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance: AUTOSAR migration\n\nProducts: EB tresos, Software engineering\n\nCategories: ECU development & AUTOSAR\n\nThe company\n\nThe Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, which sold 10.6 million vehicles in almost 200 countries in 2017, was looking for a partner to help evaluate and implement AUTOSAR.\n\nThe challenge\n\nThe Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance wanted to go from a ECU-based architecture to a feature-driven software architecture. They also needed to build up know-how regarding AUTOSAR to better manage their Tier 1 suppliers (technical and economic viability).\n\nConstraints:\n\nRenault had their own ECU software specifications\n\nRenault needed an overview of how AUTOSAR would affect their own specifications and the software development of their Tier 1 suppliers.\n\nThe solution\n\nElektrobit did an extensive specification analysis for Renault and in the second phase of the project, Elektrobit carried out the prototyping.\n\nBenefits:\n\nElektrobit combines more than 30 years of automotive software development and over 15 years of AUTOSAR experience.\n\nElektrobit has a location in Paris, from which Renault is supported in their native language.\n\nElektrobit now offers 4 additional software modules to Tier 1s (for communications and diagnostics) to propose a full AUTOSAR solution compliant to Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi specifications.\n\nElektrobit’s contributed value\n\nElektrobit helped Renault to define and establish a standard software architecture platform. This allows Renault to embed additional ECU features more easily. The software can be synchronized before the hardware, which leads to an increased flexibility."
