        "text": "The company originated in two earlier companies—Kwaishinsha Co. (founded in 1911 to produce Dat cars) and Jitsuyo Jidōsha Co. (founded in 1919)—which merged in 1925 to form Dat Jidōsha Seizō Co. In 1933 the assets of this company were taken over by new investors, who established the Jidōsha Seizō Co., Ltd., giving it its present name the following year. The new company was engaged in the production and sale of vehicles and parts under a new name, Datsun.\n\nDuring the war years (from 1938) the company converted entirely to production of trucks and military vehicles. In 1945 the Allied occupation forces seized the main Nissan plants; though allowing production of Nissan and Datsun vehicles to resume at one plant, they did not restore all other facilities to Nissan until 1955. Thereafter, especially during the 1960s, when Nissan entered the world market, production and sales grew phenomenally as the company established assembly plants in several countries outside Japan. By the late 1990s, however, Nissan was struggling, and in 1999 it entered into a partnership with the French carmaker Renault. The partnership was a success, and Nissan’s sales buoyed in the early 21st century, driven in part by sales of the company’s popular electric automobiles."
