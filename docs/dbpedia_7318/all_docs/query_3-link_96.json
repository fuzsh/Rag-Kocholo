        "text": "carb\n\nLee Iacocca, the great American auto industry manager, once said that by the beginning of the 21st century there would be only a few really big players in the global automotive market – corporations and alliances that would own the vast majority of car brands. He turned out to be absolutely right. It was at the turn of the century and a little later that the most active wave of mergers and closures of several companies began.\n\nToday’s car market is dotted with a variety of brands. But not everyone knows that the majority of car brands do not exist by themselves and almost each is a big automobile concern. Of course, there are independent brands, but their number can be counted on the fingers of one hand.\n\nIn fact, in today’s world, there are only a little more than a dozen large conglomerates that own all of these brands and produce about 90% of all cars. And four of them have more than 10% of the market each.\n\nFor example, did you know that the German brand Opelhas long been owned by the American company General Motors, and the legendary Swedish car brand Volvois now fully owned by the Chinese car corporation?\n\nWho owns the majority of world car brands, who owns who, and who exists autonomously – in this article we tried to answer all these questions and structure the information in the most accessible and convenient for you. For this purpose, for our part, we have taken and sorted all the famous car brands by the corporations that own them at the moment. Thanks to our catalog you will be able to learn more about what car brand belongs to a particular car company.\n\nFor your convenience, we have divided all automobile concerns into continents, but in some cases, it was difficult because the companies were formed by merging manufacturers from different continents.\n\nEuropean Automobile Concerns\n\nVolkswagen Auto Group (VAG)\n\nThe world champion in car sales is the German Volkswagen AG headquartered in Wolfsburg. VW began actively buying brands back in the 1980s. The first was the Spanish SEAT in 1986 and in 1991 the Germans bought the Czech Skoda. In 1998, Bentley, Lamborghini (purchased by a subsidiary of Audi), and Bugatti were added to its portfolio, and since 2009 the hunt for Porsche began, and by 2012 VW became the parent company. In 2009, the Germans bought a majority stake in Scania, and in 2011 – MAN. Also in 2011, Audi bought the motorcycle company Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A.\n\nThe company officially employs about 375,000 people. The production of cars under the management of “Volkswagen AG” is organized in more than 20 countries. The main activity of the company is directly related to the mass production of automotive products.\n\nThe concern ownsthe following auto brands:\n\nAudi;\n\nVolkswagen;\n\nBentley;\n\nLamborghini;\n\nBugatti;\n\nPorsche;\n\nSeat;\n\nSkoda;\n\nMan;\n\nScania;\n\nDucati\n\nStellantis\n\nLaunched in December 2019, the merger of auto giants Peugeot S.A. (Groupe PSA) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCA) was officially completed on January 16, 2021, resulting in the formation of Stellantis Corporation, the world’s fourth-largest automaker by volume after Toyota, Volkswagen Group and the Renault-Mitsubishi-Nissan alliance.\n\nStellantis is present in more than 130 global markets, has manufacturing facilities in more than 30 countries, and employs more than 300,000 people. The company has a broad portfolio of automotive brands, mobility services, parts, and after-sales services. The company strives to be the best, not the biggest, by working for the benefit of all its shareholders as well as the communities in which it operates.\n\nThe concern owns the following auto brands:\n\nCitroen;\n\nPeugeot;\n\nDS;\n\nOpel;\n\nVauxhall\n\nAlfa Romeo;\n\nChrysler;\n\nDodge;\n\nFiat;\n\nJeep;\n\nAbarth;\n\nMaserati;\n\nLancia;\n\nRAM\n\nBMW Group\n\nBMW Group AG (Bayerische Motoren Werke AG) manufactures automobiles, motorcycles, and engines for them. The headquarters is located in Munich, Germany. The official date of the foundation of the concern is 1916. In 1994, the company has acquired the shares of the above-mentioned brands. The exception is Rolls-Royce, which became a division of BMW in 1998. In 2000, due to regular losses, BMW sold its Land Rover division to American Ford (which, in turn, sold LR to Indian Tata in 2008), and production facilities Mini transferred to a separate newly formed subsidiary, which still produces revived MINI. BMW has assembly plants in Germany, Russia, the USA, South Africa, Mexico, Hungary, Egypt, India, and China.\n\nThe BMW Group consists of:\n\nBMW;\n\nRolls-Royce;\n\nMini;\n\nBMW Motorrad.\n\nDaimler Group\n\nThe last 100 percent European concern on our list is the German Daimler. The Daimler concern is the same as the BMW concern. The main focus is the production of Mercedes-Benz, and in addition, already produces small cars Smart and premium Maybach.\n\nThe company’s headquarters is located in Stuttgart. The firm appeared in 1926 and was called Daimler-Benz AG. It formed as a result of a merger of two individual German manufacturers. In addition to the production of passenger cars, the company has been also engaged in the production of trucks, as well as various models of buses and motor vehicles.\n\nMercedes-Benz cars are produced in Germany, Austria, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Spain, South Africa, Thailand, the USA, and Vietnam.\n\nThe Daimler Group includes the following brands:\n\nMercedes-Benz;\n\nMercedes-AMG;\n\nMaybach;\n\nSmart;\n\nDaimler Trucks Group;\n\nMercedes-Benz Vans Group;\n\nFreightliner;\n\nWestern Star;\n\nThomas Built Buses;\n\nSetra;\n\nBharatBenz\n\nRenault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance\n\nAmong the world’s largest automakers it is impossible not to mention the Renault-Nissan alliance, which owns such brands as Samsung, Infiniti, Nissan, Dacia, and Renault.\n\nThe merger of brands such as Nissan and Renault has formed a rather large concern. This was because at the time of the merger, the companies already owned several brands. Subsidiaries of Nissan are premium Infiniti and budget Datsun. Renault, in turn, had such brands as Dacia, Samsung Motors, and Avtovaz in its division. Mitsubishi Motors Company joined the alliance in 2016 as a big contributor as well.\n\nThe group has production facilities in France, Russia, Japan, India, and Brazil. The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance is supervised by a special new body, the Governing Board, which includes the heads of all three companies: Thierry Bolloré (Renault), Hiroto Saikawa (Nissan), and Osamu Masuko (Mitsubishi).\n\nThe peculiarity of the alliance is the absence of headquarters. The formed “trio” continues to design cars under well-known brands. But the partners have the full right to use each other’s innovative developments.\n\nThe group includes such automobile brands as:\n\nDacia;\n\nDatsun;\n\nInfiniti;\n\nLada;\n\nNissan;\n\nMitsubishi;\n\nRenault;\n\nAlpine Motor;\n\nRenault Korea Motors.\n\nAston Martin\n\nAston Martin is a legendary British company specializing in the production of ultra-expensive sports supercars. The production of cars of this brand began with the construction of a sports coupe by Robert Bamford and his companion Lionel Martin in 1914. And only in 1920 the serial production of sports cars, light, powerful, and maneuverable, was established. The wave of success lasted until World War II when there was a temporary lull in sales of luxury cars that lasted until 1947. Then Aston Martin changed ownership. David Brown became the new CEO.\n\nThe next stage of the brand’s development was the company’s transition to Company Development Ltd, and then to Ford Motor Company. In 2020, Aston Martin got a new investor, Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, followed by a new CEO (former head of AMG division Tobias Moers), and Daimler became the largest shareholder (20% of shares). The new strategy provides for a complete transition to AMG engines, and in this regard, the company began to reshape the development plan of the model range.\n\nAston Martin;\n\nLagonda\n\nAmerican Automobile Concerns\n\nFord Motor Company\n\nCurrently, the American company “Ford” ranks fourth in the world among all the world’s car manufacturers. In the American car market itself, this company occupies the third position in sales, second only to such auto corporations as “General Motors” and “Toyota”. The brand was founded in 1903. The brand name has not changed throughout the history of automobile production.\n\nBefore the 2008 crisis, Ford owned such brands as Jaguar, Lincoln, Land Rover, Volvo, and Aston Martin, as well as 33% of Japanese Mazda. Due to the crisis, all brands were sold. Ford still owns only Lincoln, which specializes in the production of premium cars. Lincoln makes luxury cars, mostly for the United States, but Ford’s production geography is still very wide – North and South America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nFor more than a century, the concern has bought and sold the rights to own different car marques. Today, its companions include such brands as:\n\nLincoln;\n\nFord;\n\nTroller;\n\nFPV\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nGeneral Motors has been the world’s largest automaker for 77 years. Unfortunately, due to the financial crisis in 2008, the company lost its leadership in the global automotive market. Today, the company “General Motors” in terms of production and number of sales is only 3rd place in the world, behind automotive giants such as “Toyota” and “Volkswagen”.\n\nThe largest American company began to grow in 1892. Its founder was R.E. Olds. In those years, automakers called Cadillac Automobile Company and Buick Motor Company developed in parallel. In 1903, the three brands merged to eliminate unhealthy competition from the market.\n\nIn recent years, General Motors has lost a huge number of its brands: Opel, Saab, Hummer, Saturn, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Plymouth, and Holden.\n\nGM is headquartered in Detroit and has production facilities on every continent.\n\nAutomobile brands that are part of the concern:\n\nBuick;\n\nCadillac;\n\nChevrolet;\n\nGMC\n\nAsian Automotive Concerns\n\nToyota\n\n“Toyota Motor” is one of the world’s largest corporations that is involved in the industrial production of motor vehicles. For several years now, “Toyota” has been the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. The auto alliance appeared in 1935. The first production car – a pickup truck model G 1. The company’s headquarters is located in the Aichi Prefecture and has production facilities around the world.\n\nThe main business of the company “Toyota Motor” is the production of cars, trucks, and buses, which are produced under different car brands.\n\nThis concern consists of more than 300 small companies that use the Toyota logo. The group consists of:\n\nToyota Tsusho Corporation;\n\nKyoho Kai Group (211 firms engaged in the production of auto parts);\n\nKyouei Kai Group (123 logistics firms);\n\nDenso\n\nLexus;\n\nScion;\n\nDaihatsu;\n\nHino;\n\nRanz\n\nHonda Motor Company\n\nThe leading Japanese manufacturer of motor vehicles is currently one of the ten most active and influential automobile concerns. Honda was founded in 1948. Honda has production facilities in Japan, the USA, Canada, Mexico, Britain, China, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Argentina, and Brazil.\n\n“Honda Motor is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of motor vehicles and cars. The main divisions of the company are engaged in the development and production of various motor vehicles, ranging from mopeds to sports bikes. Recently, the company became a world leader in the production of ATVs.\n\nBut, despite the obvious focus on the production of motorcycles and other motorcycles, the Japanese company “Honda Motor” is also one of the largest companies in the automotive industry. Each year the Japanese automaker manufactures a variety of car models for the world.\n\nHowever, besides its main brand, the Japanese manufacturer of cars and motorcycles Honda can boast of only one company. It is the brand Acura, which was founded by Honda itself to produce cars in the premium segment.\n\nHere is the list of automobiles that are owned by Honda Motor:\n\nAcura;\n\nHonda\n\nZhejiang Geely\n\nGeely is a Chinese company, which by mistake is also considered independent. In fact, the letters of the logo on all cars of the brand are the name of the parent company. It was founded in 1986. “Zhejiang Geely Holdings Group” is one of the ten largest Chinese automobile companies. At the moment, this holding company owns nine large car plants in China.\n\nIn addition to the usual production of cars, the company is also engaged in the production of cars for taxi transport, motorcycles, engines, and gearboxes.

Among other things, this company is also a global manufacturer of both motor vehicles and boat engines. Suzuki is the third company by sales in Japan. But its main “cash” Suzuki makes due to the Indian market, where it sells a huge amount of its cars under the Maruti Suzuki brand. The company’s facilities are located in Japan, but it assembles and sells clones of Japanese models all over the world. For example, SX4 is Fiat Sedici in Europe, Alto is Nissan Pixo, and Vitara is Chevrolet Tracker in America, and this list is almost endless.\n\nHere’s a list of automobiles that are owned by Suzuki Motor Corporation:\n\nMaruti;\n\nSuzuki\n\nMazda Motor\n\nMazda Motoris the largest automobile manufacturing company in Japan, which is also the largest company on the world stage of the automotive industry.

Naturally, the automotive industry itself is changing. Time is inexorably changing everything around us. The same applies to the automobile world. Yesterday, many modern technologies seemed to us like something fantastic, and today we sometimes do not even think about how complex in design and provision our modern cars have become.\n\nBut along with the development of the automobile industry itself is changing and the balance of power in the global automotive market. In this modern and quite complex reality, sometimes it becomes difficult to keep track of everything.\n\nAmong the acquisitions and mergers of recent years should be mentioned the transition under the wing of the Chinese Geely brand Volvo and the acquisition of British premium brands Land Rover and Jaguar by the Indian company Tata. The most curious case is the purchase of the well-known Swedish brand SAAB by the tiny manufacturer of supercars Spyker from Holland.\n\nThe once-powerful British car industry has told its life a long time ago. All famous British car producers have long ago lost their independence. Their example was followed by small British firms, which passed to foreign owners. In particular, today the legendary Lotus is owned by Proton (Malaysia), and Chinese SAIC bought MG. By the way, the same SAIC before that sold Korean SsangYong Motor to Indian Mahindra&Mahindra.\n\nIn the Renault-Nissan alliance, support for each other is provided by partners, and in the Volkswagen Group, mutual assistance is provided by several brands.\n\nAs for such companies as Mitsubishi and Mazda, more and more difficulties await them in the future. While Mitsubishi can get help from PSA partners, Mazda will have to survive on its own, which in today’s world is becoming more and more difficult by the day.\n\nIn this article, we looked at the largest car companies in the world, which own almost 90% of the most famous car brands.
