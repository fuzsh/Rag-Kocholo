        "text": "Nissan and Renault on Wednesday finalized the terms of their revamped alliance, with the Japanese automaker committing to invest up to 600 million euros ($663 million) in its partner’s electric vehicle unit Ampere.\n\nThe agreement to conclude the terms of their overhauled partnership will put the two automakers on more equal footing and caps months of sometimes tense negotiations over issues such as the sharing of future intellectual property.\n\nThe investment in Ampere is consistent with Nissan (NSANF) being a strategic investor and securing a board seat on the new company, Nissan (NSANF) said.\n\nSources have said Ampere could be valued at up to 10 billion euros. That would put Nissan’s investment of up to 600 million euros in Ampere at about 6%, lower than the 15% it had flagged as a maximum share in February.\n\nIn a statement, Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said the Ampere investment “complements and strengthens Nissan’s ongoing electric push in Europe.”\n\nThe companies said the overhaul was subject to regulatory approvals and completion was expected in the fourth quarter of 2023."
