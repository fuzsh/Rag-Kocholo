        "text": "Nissan and its French partner Renault have said they are in talks about the future of their alliance that include consideration by the Japanese automaker of investing in a new Renault electric vehicle venture.\n\nRenault shares rose by as much as 6% in early trading Monday, making the stock the best performer on France's benchmark CAC-40 equity index.\n\nThe talks between the two automakers, which could prompt the biggest reset in the alliance since the 2018 arrest of longtime executive Carlos Ghosn, have included consideration of Renault selling some of its stake in Nissan, two people with knowledge of the discussions said."
