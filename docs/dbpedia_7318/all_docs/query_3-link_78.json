        "text": "Renault Group and Volvo Group have launched Flexis SAS, a new company that will develop and produce electric vans.\n\nThe joint venture will now start operations, having completed all regulatory approval processes.\n\nAn all-new family of light commercial vehicles will be introduced by the business. Production is planned to start in 2026.\n\nThe vehicles will be built on a skateboard platform, designed to offer high modularity for different body types at low cost. A variety of battery options will be available, to balance cost with payload. The vehicles will also utilise an 800v electrical system, to enable rapid charging capability.\n\nBy adopting a new Software Defined Vehicle architecture, the vehicle will offer new monitoring capabilities to maximise business performance. Renault and Volvo claim this approach will reduce global operating costs by 30% for fleet operators.\n\nRenault Group will bring the know-how to develop and manufacture at scale the electric platform, while Volvo Group will leverage its strong customer base of professional logistic companies, global service network, and wide experience in uptime and productivity services.\n\nVolvo Group, through its business area Renault Trucks, and Renault Group have been working together on light commercial vehicles for more than 35 years, materialised by the distribution in both networks of the Renault Master and Trafic commercial vehicles.\n\nThe two groups expect CMA CGM to join the new company. Renault and Volvo will continue to seek additional investment and business partners.\n\n“We are excited to take yet another step in our journey towards sustainable transport solutions through the intended establishment of a new company. Volvo Group is keen to continue to offer its customers complete transport solutions that help them decarbonize their value chains. We see a growing demand for clean, efficient, and safe urban transportation and partnership and collaboration is key to achieve this,” says Martin Lundstedt, president, and CEO of Volvo Group.\n\nLuca de Meo, CEO of Renault Group, added: “Electrification and digitalisation are paving the way for a revolution in the LCV market. Renault Group intends to lead this transformation while ensuring a robust and effective value creation. Today, we are very proud to embark in this journey with Volvo Group to bring the best of solutions to our professional customers. We also look forward to CMA CGM joining the company. The new company is the start-up minded, unmatched combination of the complementary assets of 3 champions: a leading truck maker, expert in tailored services, a champion of the global supply chains, and a European EV pioneer & LCV leader. All the ingredients are there to come up with something truly unique.\""
