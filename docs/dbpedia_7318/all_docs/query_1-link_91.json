Fast forward 15 years and RNAIPL has now established itself as a leading automotive manufacturer having produced over 2.5 million Renault and Nissan cars in India for domestic and export markets.\n\nAdvt\n\nThe Chennai-based manufacturing plant has manufactured more than 2.5 million vehicles and exported 1.15 million of them to over 108 destinations. As part of the USD 600 million investment by the Renault Nissan Alliance in India, RNAIPL will be manufacturing six new models of cars, including two EVs over the next few years, the company said.\n\nKeerthi Prakash, Managing Director of RNAIPL, said: “As we celebrate RNAIPL's 15-year journey, we take immense pride in the remarkable growth we have achieved in these years and the various milestones we have crossed in our pursuit of manufacturing excellence, delivering value to customers and contributing to the local economy. We remain committed to bringing the best of Nissan and Renault products to customers in India and abroad while at the same time reducing the impact of our operations on the environment and supporting the sustainable development of our local communities.”\n\nRNAIPL is the first dedicated Alliance manufacturing plant globally for the Renault Nissan Alliance. The first car, a Nissan Micra, was rolled out in May 2010. The company manufactured its first 100,000 vehicles within a year of start of operations. It has manufactured 20 models of Renault and Nissan cars so far. By July 2023, RNAIPL had manufactured more than 2.5 million cars, the company said in a media release.\n\nBy ,\n\nETAuto\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.\n\nDownload ETAuto App\n\nGet Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles"
