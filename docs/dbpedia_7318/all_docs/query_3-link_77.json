        "text": "Nissan Global\n\nNissan is a celebrated global corporation renowned for its top-tier automobiles, exceptional client service, iconic approach to diversification, and future-forward collaborative partnerships. Here’s a concise overview of Nissan Global, its history and all the alliances that make it such a time-honoured automotive brand overall.\n\nAbout The Nissan Global Motor Corporation\n\nIf you are a new supporter of the Nissan brand, or only now getting around to reading up about it, you may be wondering who owns Nissan. The short answer is that Nissan falls under the umbrella of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, also referred to as the Renault Alliance.\n\nHowever, it’s an oversimplification to say that Groupe Renault owns Nissan. The truer sense of the partnership means that these three auto brands have banded together in order to optimise product development and deliver highly innovative technology.\n\nToday, the consolidated group of which Nissan forms a vital part has 30 production facilities in 15 markets, producing and selling upwards of 3.4 million units each year. This is thanks to the ability of the alliance to deliver innovative technology, provide a rewarding driving experience and offer effortless ownership to discerning motorists around the world.\n\nAbout Nissan’s Alliances And Partnerships\n\nSo, who makes Nissan and who does Nissan own? The short of the long is that the Alliance formed in 1999 has now worked together for 20+ years to develop exceptional vehicles and bring them to market across the globe at very attractive price points thanks to their immense combined buying power and talent pool.\n\nToday, the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance leverages the skills of 375 000+ employees around the globe to innovate and address prevailing and emerging customer needs. As one of the top three original equipment manufacturers in the world, the foremost aim is always to lead the mobility revolution, and reach carbon neutrality by 2050. These lofty ideals are backed up by $15 billion+ invested in R&D and Capex each year.\n\nNissan’s History In A Nutshell\n\nThe Nissan brand has a fascinating history that started in Japan in 1914. Starting with the DAT that would become the Datsun, the company shifted gears in 1938 to produce trucks and military vehicles. After the war ended, and a seize period had come and gone, the 1950s Nissan boom was heard worldwide, and the brand stepped onto the global stage.\n\nFrom sports sedans that heralded a racing heritage, to luxury family cars, the brand read its audience with amazing clairvoyance and spread its operations around the world to become a global car giant. By the 1990s it was producing 50 million units annually, and in 1999 the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance was born. Today, Nissan continues to build on this tremendous history as a part of this three-pronged powerhouse."
