It captures the spirit of the global automotive collaboration and is respectful of each member company’s identity,” said a spokesperson for the organisation.\n\nAgencies Teneo Blue Rubicon, Interbrand and We Are Social were also involved in helping to produce the logo and an accompanying website.\n\nThe alliance was originally founded in 1999 by Renault and Nissan. Mitsubishi was then acquired in 2016. Operating as a collective, the alliance recently surpassed the Volkswagen Group to become the world’s largest car manufacturer.\n\nSource: Renault-Nissan Alliance"
