        "text": "France and Japan Monday gave their “strong support” to the Renault-Nissan alliance as they set out the priorities of a new cooperation deal.\n\nExperts from both sides have been working since June on the agreement, aimed at settling a partnership rocked by the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of both companies, late last year on fraud allegations in Japan.\n\nFollowing a telephone call, France’s Bruno Le Maire and Japan’s Hiroshige Seko said they had agreed to set up a “policy dialogue” between the two companies covering five issues: autonomous driving, battery supply chains, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, hydrogen development and boosting small and medium suppliers.\n\n“A memorandum of cooperation has now been agreed and sets the frame work for the continued discussion between both parties,” Le Maire and Seko said.\n\nThe French government owns a 15 percent stake in Renault, which in turn holds a 43 percent stake in Nissan. The Japanese auto giant has 15 percent of shares in Renault."
