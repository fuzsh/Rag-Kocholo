In keeping with this spirit, our celebrations were spread over several days. Earlier this month, we invited 25 girl students from Vadakupattu and Chenakuppam government schools to visit our plant and get a glimpse of our manufacturing process. The students were hosted by a group of RNAIPL women employees who shared their personal experiences to inspire more girls to choose careers in STEM. Yesterday, our women employees participated in a few engaging and fun activities. Additionally, I would like to thank Ms Saraswathi K, Secretary General of the Madras Chamber of Commerce, who kindly took time to speak to our team and share learnings from her rich professional experience. I also took this opportunity to have a candid discussion with our team. As we move towards making RNAIPL a best place to work, it is important that we #inspireinclusion for everyone. #internationalwomensday #womeninmanufacturing #renaultnissan #rnaipl #automotive‚Äù\n\nAt RNAIPL we are committed to our goal of reaching Carbon Neutral operations by 2045.
