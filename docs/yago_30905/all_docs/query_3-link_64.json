        "meta_description": "Crabbing is one of Washington's most popular recreational fisheries. Each year, recreational crabbers catch more than 1.5 million pounds of Dungeness crab using pots, ring nets, and — in the case of wade and dive fishers — their bare hands.All recreational crabbers 15 years or older must carry a current Washington fishing license. Options range from an annual shellfish/seaweed license to combination fishing licenses, valid for a single day or up to a year.",

        "text": "Puget Sound crabbers: remember to submit your Catch Record Card and to not set pots in ferry or shipping lanes. Please also avoid obstructing marina entrances or boat launches.\n\nThe Puget Sound recreational crab management area includes Washington marine areas 5 through 13 (including the Strait of Juan de Fuca, San Juan Islands, Puget Sound, and Hood Canal) and marine area 4 (Neah Bay) east of the Bonilla-Tatoosh line. The Dungeness crab catch record card is required for this area.\n\nLearn more about crabbing in Puget Sound\n\nPuget Sound area crab fishers must return their catch record cards or report online even if they did not go crabbing or catch any crab. The deadline for returning summer and winter catch cards is printed on each catch card. If crabbers fail to return their catch card they will be required to pay a $10 fine before they can purchase another crab endorsement .\n\nPuget Sound Dungeness crab reporting system now in effect:\n\nTwo-card reporting system: All sport crabbers fishing in Puget Sound are required to report their Dungeness crab catch on separate summer and winter catch record cards at the end of each season. The new cards are separate from the multi-species card used for recording catches of salmon, halibut and other fish. People of all ages who have a crab endorsement and received a catch record card are required to make a report even if they did not go crabbing or catch any crab.\n\nOnline reporting: Sport crabbers can either report their information through WDFW's online licensing system or mail their catch cards to the address on this page. The website address for reporting crab catches is printed on the catch record card along with reporting deadlines.\n\nThe online reporting site will only accept catch reports during two time periods. Summer Catch Record Cards can only be entered online from the day after Labor Day through Oct. 1 of each year. Winter Catch Record Cards can only be entered online from Jan. 1 through Feb. 1 of each year. The reporting site will allow you to view your reporting history at any time.\n\nFailure to report penalty: If those crab fishing in the Puget Sound management area fail to report their summer or winter harvest, they will be assessed a $10 penalty with the following year's license purchase.\n\nPuget Sound crabbers have several options for reporting their catch information. They can report online, drop the Puget Sound Dungeness crab catch record cards off at a WDFW regional office, or mail them to:\n\n​​​Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife\n\nWDFW CRC Unit,\n\nPO Box 43142,\n\nOlympia, WA 98504-3142\n\nFishery managers rely on individual catch record card reports to estimate recreational harvest and to set future crabbing opportunities. By completing catch record cards, fishers play a vital role in maintaining sustainable harvest opportunities.\n\nTake our CRABBER KNOWLEDGE QUIZ to test your knowledge of the Puget Sound recreational crabbing rules and provide valuable information to fisheries managers. We are conducting a study that aims to evaluate Puget Sound recreational crabbers’ knowledge of crabbing rules and regulations and to provide an educational tool for crabbers to learn current regulations and best practices. Participation should take approximately 15 minutes, is voluntary, and all responses are anonymous.\n\nCoastal crabbers: avoid setting pots in shipping lanes, navigational channels, and tow boat lanes, including those in Grays Harbor and off the Washington Coast. An interactive map of coastal tow lanes is available from Washington Sea Grant on this webpage.\n\nThe coastal recreational crab management area includes Washington marine areas 1-3 and marine area 4 west of the Bonilla-Tatoosh line. A crab catch record card is not required for this area.\n\nLearn more about crabbing in coastal areas\n\nRecreational crabbing is open year-round on the Washington Coast, but pot gear season closes in several areas for a portion of September, October, and November to reduce soft-shell crab mortality.\n\nCrab snares and foldable traps are legal during this time, as are ring nets that lie completely flat on the bottom. Hoop nets or dome pots that do not lie flat are prohibited during this time.\n\nPot closure dates vary by area. Please see the marine area regulations below for details. Learn more and get tips for coastal crabbing in this 2023 WDFW blog post: Check your gear: here’s what’s legal during crab pot closure in coastal marine areas.\n\nOr learn more about WDFW's Coastal Recreational Crab Unit in our August 2023 blog post."
