        "text": "By Michele Willer-Allred\n\nStudents in John Loprieno's theater arts class at Moorpark College usually have no clue their instructor is a soap operaÂ star.\n\nIn 1986, a 26-year-old John Loprieno landed the role of the handsome Cord Roberts on the ABC soap opera \"One Life toÂ Live.\"\n\nSince then, he has continued to make recurring appearances on the soap, but this week marks a sort of end of an era forÂ him.\n\nIt was announced during the summer that the soap opera, which has been on television since 1968, has been canceled and that production will end Nov.Â 18.\n\nABC has licensed the soap opera to Prospect Park, a media and production company that plans to continue the seriesÂ online.\n\nLoprieno was asked by the show's producers to reprise his role before the show goes offÂ television.\n\n\"I said, 'Yes, it would be fun to see everyone and say goodbye,' \" heÂ said.\n\nIn the past 10 years, whenever Loprieno was asked to be on the show, it was just for one or two appearances, heÂ said.\n\n\"More often than not, it was either for a wedding or a funeral, and I would sit in the back, and they would kind of pan the camera across me,\" he said withÂ aÂ laugh.\n\nSince October, the actor has done 13 episodes and had to travel back and forth between New York, where it is recorded, and Moorpark, where heÂ teaches.\n\n\"It turned out to be a much bigger cameo than I thought it would be. It was fun. It was great to see everybody and work with (actress) Andrea Evans again,\" LoprienoÂ said.\n\nHis students, though, have remained largely oblivious to their teacher's fame on the once very popularÂ soap.\n\n\"I don't even think daytime is on their radar. Once in a while, a student will say, 'My mom used to watch you,' \" Loprieno said withÂ aÂ laugh.\n\n\"I always thought the nice thing about daytime is that there's no reruns, so at least my students won't be able to throw that up in my face and have fun with me about some of the goofy stuff I used to do in daytime. But YouTube has got everything. Some of them have seen some of my most embarrassing moments,\" heÂ said.\n\nLoprieno was on the soap opera \"Search For Tomorrow,\" which was canceled, before he got the role on \"One LifeÂ toÂ Live.\"\n\nThen, daytime television was very popular, and he did promotional appearances across theÂ country.\n\n\"It was great to be in your mid-20s, working in New York City as an actor. It was really kind of this fantasy come true. We sure felt like celebrities,\" heÂ said.\n\nBut in the 1990s, Loprieno said, daytime soaps faced competition from other shows, including reality television.\n\n\"Daytime kind of birthed a lot of the reality shows you see now because they wanted that kind of programming, but they didn't want to pay all the players,\" heÂ said.\n\nHe also said there's no artistic culmination of what reality television stars do to oneÂ another.\n\n\"Eventually, all the lies and secrets of the soap opera characters came out, and they lost something ? a relationship, a fortune, whatever. When somebody's evil or does inappropriate things on a reality show, they don't get their just deserts, like they would in a crafted story,\" said Loprieno, now married and a fatherÂ ofÂ two.\n\nLoprieno has been teaching at the college full time for six years. This summer he plans to work on writing projects he has had on the back burner for years. In December, the school will hold auditions for the musical \"Chicago,\" which he willÂ direct.\n\nLoprieno, who has a master of fine arts degree in theater, said he would like to return to acting and would consider reprising the role of Cord Roberts on the new \"One LifeÂ toÂ Live.\"\n\n\"It will be interesting to see how it evolves. There were a couple of people who asked me if I'd be interested in going back on, and I said, 'Hey you never know.' Sure, depending on the circumstances and my school schedule,\" heÂ said.\n\nHe is mum, however, on what happens to his character in the final episodes of the televisionÂ show.\n\n\"I will say, though, that Cord and Tina fans will be happy,\" heÂ said."
