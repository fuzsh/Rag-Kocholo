        "text": "Moorpark College Professor reprises role as Cord Roberts on “One Life to Live”\n\nThis month MC Theatre Department Chair John Loprieno reprises his role as Cord Roberts on the daytime soap opera ‘One Life to Live.’\n\nLoprieno, who has played the popular Cord Roberts on the daytime television drama since 1987 said; “It was a lot of fun, there is always that question can I do what I used to do.” Loprieno commented “I am happy to see I can still do what I used to do.”\n\n‘One Life to Live’ premiered in 1968, centering on the lives of the citizens of the fictional town of Llanview, PA.\n\nLoprieno who had his last appearance on the show in 2008 said; “The show called me, technically they are slotted to be canceled in January, and they were reaching out to former characters”.\n\nFor over 40 years serial soap opera drama dominated the daytime television line up. Earlier this year fans were shocked to hear that two major soaps; ‘All My Children’ and ‘One Life to Live’ would be pulled from the line-up and replaced with talk and reality shows.\n\n“It’s kinda like going away to school and having your parents sell the house.” Loprieno stated regarding the shows cancellation.\n\nSuzanne Fagan who is a MC Theatre Arts Professor and is currently directing the MC production of ‘The Learned Ladies,’ says she is not really a daytime fan but she did catch his return to the show.\n\n“It is great working with John, he is such an asset to the department,” Fagan commented. “His door is always open to students and faculty alike.”\n\nClaudia Bedoya a, MC theater student and current cast member in ‘the Learned Ladies’ production says she watched the show a few times in the past.\n\n“I definitely know that Cord Roberts (John Loprieno) was a popular character and still I,” Bedoya commented. “We are very blessed to have him as an instructor. He is a brilliant director, actor and mentor.”\n\nLoprieno who instructs a number of theater arts classes at MC said; “I like to think that it helps me get street credit with my students.”\n\nAlthough the show is up for cancellation in January Loprieno’s character Cord Roberts will run until the first week of November.\n\n“It certainly was nice to end with a happy ending for the character, he gets back with his wife,” he noted.\n\nLoprieno says he has no future plans to return to television at this time but commented; “I do have several writing projects germinating.”"
