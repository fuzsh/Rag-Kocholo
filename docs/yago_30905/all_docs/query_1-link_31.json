        "text": "On Wednesday, several of the stars of One Life to Live participated in a special tribute honoring the late Andrea Evans (ex-Tina), who passed away last month from cancer at the age of 66, on You Tube’s Michael Fairman Channel. Andrea’s passing came as a shock to many who were unaware that she was battling cancer for yet the second time.\n\nIn the world of soap operas, Andrea’s portrayal of One Life’s Tina Lord Roberts encapsulated what made people tune-in every day – the high camp, the vixen, and machinations of a villainess. Through it all, no matter what Tina did, fans still loved her and couldn’t wait to see what she would do next. While Andrea appeared on other soaps including, Passions, The Bold and the Beautiful, The Young and the Restless and the digital series, The Bay, it was her role on One Life to Live that will remain a part of soap history.\n\nJoining Michael Fairman to honor Andrea were: Erika Slezak (ex-Viki), Fiona Hutchison (ex-Gabrielle), John Loprieno (ex-Cord), and. Robert S. Woods (ex-Bo). Later, the actors were joined by the former head writer of One Life to Live and now the head writer of Days of our Lives, Ron Carlivati. In addition, James DePaiva (ex-Max) and Barbara Luna (ex-Maria) sent special messages that were read on-air in tribute to Andrea, since they were unable to participate on the livestream.\n\nFiona detailed her friendship with Andrea, and being one of the few people who knew she was ill, plus insight their time together on One Life which included the now classic Iguazú Falls storyline. Bob Woods spoke with great sadness at losing Andrea at such a young age, while John Loprieno talked about his screen-test with Andrea which led to him becoming Cord Roberts.\n\nErika Slezak spoke on how Andrea made the character of Tina all her own, sharing, “Tina grew into a very complex character, that she herself created. I mean, they wrote it, but she created all the ins and outs and the different aspects of that character. She had to create everything from scratch and boy did she ever. She was very smart.”\n\nIn addition, Erika addressed the challenging life Andrea lived when she became the victim of a stalker, and how because of it, Andrea stayed away from show business for years and left the show. “I was just so sorry she went through this just terrible period in her life where she was being stalked by somebody who literally wanted to kill her.” The six-time Daytime Emmy winner, added, “Andrea was afraid to walk the streets alone because he found out where she worked. He would show up at the front door of the studio. To live like that for so many years, to the point to where she had to hire security guards to help her walk the dogs, to pick her up from the studio and to take her home, check the apartment, and then, she couldn’t leave after that. Then, they had to pick her up in the morning and bring her to work, that’s no way to live. She finally said, ‘I can’t do this anymore. I have to leave.’ She moved, and no one knew where she moved to. I knew she moved to California, but that’s all I knew.”\n\nJames DePaiva sent this very touching message: “In December 1986 I was brought to ABC to NYC. There in the early morning I was introduced to Andrea Evans for my audition as Max Holden. A few weeks later I moved to New York and began my work with Andrea. Two weeks after that I was whisked away to Argentina with Andrea, John Loprieno, Marcia Cross, and Fiona Hutchison. A sweltering heat wave and dangerous conditions, Andrea stayed cool, calm and collected. Back in NY I became aware that Andrea was the young star of OLTL. I was blessed to be working with her as she showed me the ropes of working on a Soap, but also the business and publicity savvy that it took to maintain a career. I remember John and I being eye candy bookends for Andrea at my first Emmy award show. She was wearing the most attention getting dress I had ever seen up to that point in my life. Andrea always knew how to make a splash. Andrea was always generous, kind and helpful to this “green” actor from California. I can honestly say, if not for her I would never have had this wonderful career and life I’ve lived and for that I am grateful to her. I’m sorry I can’t be there to share in this tribute. She was always one of a kind and is dearly missed.”\n\nOne of the most outlandish storylines that Fiona, John, Erika and Andrea were all a part of was the underworld city of Eterna. Fiona shared on that time, “It was great fun to go on the Eterna set every day. It was a whole other world and it was across the street. It was very believable stepping into it. It was out of left field but that was, what One Life was at the time.”\n\nJohn Loprieno said he was intimated when he first came to One Life to work with Evans, expressing: “Andrea was well-established and to kind of step into her light was very intimating. She was very thoughtful and kind during those first few couple of days.”\n\nFormer OLTL head writer, Ron Carlivati joined the tribute and shared why Andrea as Tina Lord Roberts made such an emotional and pivotal impact on his personal and professional life: “My love of soaps is so tied to that time with Tina, Cord, and Gabrielle, and Tina being presumed dead and going over the Iguazú Falls. Tina is such an iconic, emblematic part of One Life to Live and such a part of why I loved soaps in the 80’s. There was just something about that character that as bad as she could be, or as evil she could be, you loved her. I think it was the warmth of Andrea coming through.”\n\nYou can watch the One Life to Live tribute to Andrea Evans in full below.\n\nAfter you have been able to check it out, let us know what your favorite part of the tribute was, and your favorite memories of Andrea as Tina in the comment section.\n\nWhen you are on a concert world tour, of course, you want to hit Los Angeles as one of your stops! However, in the case of Genoa City rock star, Danny Romalotti (Michael Damian) and his longtime love, Christine (Cricket) Blair (Lauralee Bell), after they come to the City of Angels for a show, they are then asked at the request of the Forrester family to attend a very special soiree.\n\nIt’s all a part on an upcoming crossover event on August 13th and 14th on CBS’ The Bold and the Beautiful. On the episodes, Y&R stars Lauralee Bell and Michael Damian come to their sister soap when Danny and Christine attend a party in honor of the success of the relaunch of Brooke’s Bedroom line. This past week, Ridge (Thorsten Kaye) and Brooke (Katherine Kelly Lang) were triumphant in Monte Carlo where the fashion world got their first taste of Brooke’s 2.0 project.\n\nHowever, Danny and Christine soon learn that they were called to the mansion for a ‘business’ move by the Forresters, which somehow leads Danny to perform his number one hit (and Michael Damian’s too), Rock On (the remix) which is currently on music streaming platforms everywhere. From the looks of the snaps released by CBS, the Forresters clear some space in the living room for his performance.\n\nAhead of their appearance, Lauralee and Michael visited You Tube’s Michael Fairman Channel to tease their upcoming episodes on B&B, and discuss the longevity of their soap opera supercouple success and more.\n\nLauralee explained how her brother, Brad Bell (EP and head writer, The Bold and the Beautiful), came up with the idea for Danny and Christine to stop in LA. Bell shared, “There was a rumor months ago that I was coming on to B&B, and I think Annika Noelle (Hope, B&B) called me. She’s like, ‘Is this true?’ And I was like, well, if it’s true, I don’t know and it wasn’t true (at the time). Then, I called Brad and said, ‘Hey, if this is happening, could you tell me? I just need to block out some dates.’ At the time, he said, ‘No, no, no. I don’t have anything planned, but I would love to come up with something where you guys would authentically be able to come over.’ Then, as soon as he saw our characters in Paris on Y&R (Danny and Christine went to visit Traci), he said, ‘I think you need to come to LA.”‘\n\nTaping episodes at B&B with all the members of the Forrester clan including: John McCook (Eric), Lang, Kaye, Jacqueline MacInnes Wood (Steffy), Alley Mills (Pam), Tanner Novlan (Finn) and Jennifer Gareis (Donna) came with a ‘laughing fit’ were everyone tried to hold it together during the scenes.\n\nMichael Damian shared, “There was a laughing fit. I think it was actually started by Thorsten Kaye.” Lauralee added, “Oh yes! We had lines that had a double meaning and as soon as it went there, it was like there was no way we were going to get through it.” Damian chimed in, “Take 20!”\n\nThose wanting to follow Cricket and Danny’s world tour off-camera, should note to follow Danny Cricket Fan, Lauralee explained,”Brenda who runs it has us in every city. There’s an online virtual tour. There are tickets. The Bug Squad, etc. And today, we have a date with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce!’ Damian adds, “And he (Travis) calls me on the phone and we get together!” Bell chimes in, “It’s incredible!”\n\nNow below, check out our conversation with Lauralee Bell and Michael Damian, and then let us know if you are looking forward to their upcoming crossover to The Bold and the Beautiful via the comment section.\n\nSanta Barbara is celebrating its 40th anniversary this month. The soap opera that premiered back on July 30,1984 and was canceled after nine seasons, remains an all-time favorite for television fans around the globe.\n\nTwo of its most popular stars, Lane Davies (ex-Mason) and Nancy Lee Grahn (ex-Julia), chatted live on the Michael Fairman Channel, were they reminisced about the ups and downs of their on-screen and off-screen relationship during their time as a soap supercouple, and getting the opportunity not once, but twice, to act with each other on General Hospital – most recently in scenes as Fergus Byrne and Alexis Davis.\n\nLane and Nancy participated in the livestream event ahead of the upcoming Santa Barbara 40th reunion event that will bring together cast and creatives on Friday night, August 2nd in Burbank, California. Participants include: A Martinez, Marcy Walker, Robin Mattson, Judith McConnell and more. The gathering will also serve to honor the late, great Santa Barbara co-creator, Bridget Dobson who passed away at the age of 85, as well as offer up a meet and greet opportunity.\n\nOn Santa Barbara, Mason and Julia certainly had a combustible and passionate relationship. Grahn shared of the pairing, “The setup for us was really fun. It was classic in that he was a conservative. Julia was a liberal. She wanted a baby. She was a single mother. At that time, that was 40 years ago, she employed him to get impregnated.”\n\nBack in the hey day of Santa Barbara, Nancy recalled, “It took the characters a really long time for us to get together. They did journeys back then. Now (on soaps), it’s quicker. Now, I’m not comparing us by any means to Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, but it was the classic, these two are going to fight all the time, and be incredibly attracted to one another.”\n\nDavies added, “I think it was kind of accidental and kind of manipulated by Nancy and myself, at least the way I remember it. We were both in storylines that we didn’t really love and they were putting us together for these little banter scenes. We liked the chemistry. So, we started just kind of punching up the chemistry and the writers picked up on that and we just ran with it.”\n\nIt is no question to Nancy, that one of her all-time favorite roles was Julia Wainwright Capwell. “I loved playing Julia. I loved what it brought out in me and what it taught me, and how it changed me and grew me,” she shared. However, when Santa Barbara was canceled, Nancy was still with the soap, and she recalled where the state of the show was at at that time, “The writing and the heads of the show changed pretty significantly toward the end. There were changes that happened. I felt complete when it ended, but I was scared to be out there again. You get used to that very nice steady work and paycheck.”\n\nIt was after Santa Barbara was canceled, that Nancy began her journey to Port Charles, “I called General Hospital. It was Wendy Riche at the time (as EP) and Michele Val Jean (writer) who’s now created The Gates. She was a beautiful writer on Santa Barbara. I said (to her), ‘So I wanna have a baby, anybody interested in me in General Hospital?’ She called Wendy Riche, and they said, ‘Come on over.’ So, that’s what happened.”\n\nAs for Lane, he left Santa Barbara earlier on during its run and explained his reasons for his departure. “I left before it was over. I’d done the show for five years.I, I did it as much for my own mental health as anything else. I was kind of at the end of my rope just in terms of burnout, and either Nancy would be dead or I would be in jail, or both if I’d stayed on the show because we were about to kill each other. Not really. By that point, we were getting along again.” Grahn replied to Davies, “I could easily not talk to you all day long and then act with you. I loved acting with you.”\n\nOne of the major plot point issues where Nancy and Lane reached an impasse, was when they both shared different core views for Julia and Mason. Grahn explained, “My character (Julia) spent way too much time after a certain point just wanting to marry Mason, or putting up with him, or making excuses for him. He wanted to be this manly guy just sort of galavanting about town. Lane thought if Mason got married, and was a father to a baby, it would make him weak. This was a thing with our characters and what we were arguing for. And finally I said, ‘I’m not doing this anymore because I am representing women out there, and they cannot see this. They have to see Julia either move on, or there has to be some sort of meeting of the minds, and some equality in this male/female relationship.”\n\nNancy added, “Lane did not want his character to get married or become domestcized because he thought it would make him uninteresting. We fought about that to the point where we didn’t speak to each other for eight months.” Lane shared, “That was the biggest problem I had. I went from a guy who would change his stepmother’s pregnancy test so that she would sleep with him, to a guy that was folding diapers. I thought, ‘I’m never gonna keep my demographic folding diapers!”‘\n\nLane and Nancy also had differing opinions on the Sonny Sprocket storyline, where after Mason was presumed dead, he developed an alternate personality who was a sort of cowboy. “It was fun. I don’t think I ever was quite as country as Sonny Sprocket. He was so much looser than Mason that he was fun to play, Davies explained. However, Grahn added, “He looked exactly like Mason. He sounds exactly like Mason. And I’m supposed to not believe that’s Mason?”\n\nBack in May of 2024, Nancy and Lane got to reconnect and share scenes together on General Hospital, when during Alexis’ hearing to get her law license reinstated, her opposing counsel turned out to be Fergus Byrne, the brother of Alexis’ late lover, Neil Byrne.\n\nThe two previously worked together on the ABC soap opera back in 2002-2004, when Davies played Cameron Lewis. Now with a new character on GH, Nancy explained how it came about, and if Fergus could return in the future.\n\nNancy shared, “I wanted to recreate Mason and Julia as senior citizens. It was such a satisfying acting experience for me. I also know he (Lane) can give as good as he gets. So you want a (scene) partner that will poke you a little bit, so that’s the fun of it.”\n\nAs far as if there is a chance for Fergus to come back to the GH canvas, Nancy added, “I love working with Lane, so I’d be thrilled. I don’t know what they’re going to do. I also think Patrick Mulcahey who wrote most of the Mason and Julia stuff, was at General Hospital briefly. I think that was his idea to bring Lane on. He knew that he could count on Lane to do this thing that was very demanding because it was tremendous amounts of dialogue in just a few days. I think we did six shows in three days. So, he needed someone that he knew could count on. I think if Patrick had stayed on General Hospital, there was probably more room and opportunity for that. I don’t know about now though. I mean, we’ll see.”\n\nWatch the full conversation with Lane and Nancy below.\n\nNow let us know what were your favorite Santa Barbara moments of Mason and Julia? Do you hope GH brings back Lane as Fergus Byrne?

One of those major hurts for Sharon, was when Nick was falling for Phyllis (Michelle Stafford), who was there for him to pick up the pieces, when he was reeling from the death of his adoptive daughter, Cassie Newman (Camryn Grimes), back in 2005.\n\nYears later, fans are still divided and in separate camps … those rooting for Nick and Sharon as their ride or die favorites, “Shick”, or those pulling for Nick and Phyllis, also known as “Phick.” This week on the Friday, July 19th episode, teasers for Y&R share that Nick finds himself caught between Phyllis and Sharon! Morrow recently visited the Michael Fairman Channel for a special livestream conversation where he gave his perspective and views on Nick’s love life and relationships, then and now, as well as addressed questions from fans in the live chat.\n\nWhen speaking on if he see’s Nick and Sharon as each other’s endgame, Morrow expressed, “I don’t see them just being together forever, always happy and perfect. I just don’t. They’ve got problems. Yes, they’re each other’s first love. They’re each other’s true love. They met each other when they were kids. So, you have all these life experiences that happen. You have all the things they did to each other that affects who they are as people going forward. If the show tells me, ‘Yes! You’re going to end up with Sharon till the end of your career,’ If that’s what you want, then do it. But, I don’t know if that’s viable.”\n\nHaving Nick and Sharon just being happy, Morrow feels would not be great soap fare, “You need drama, you need issues, you need problems, you need things to make the story, go,” shared Joshua. “Nick has this problem, and it’s a good problem, but it is Phyllis. She has carved out a huge piece of his heart. I know the ‘Shick’ people do not like hearing that, but it is the truth. This woman has a hold of Nick, and it is never going to go away, and that’s a problem that Nick has. When he’s with one of them, he still always has a place with the other one. I know they don’t like hearing it, but it is just the truth. I know there’s a whole group of people out there that think I have a lot of say (re: storyline) in it, too. I have zero say for the millionth time.”\n\nMorrow also conceded that Shick fans will definitely see Nick and Sharon reunite, relating, “It’s a soap opera. Nick, of course, will end up with Sharon again at some point. I don’t know when it is, but it is definitely coming at some point. How long that lasts, I don’t know. I’ve got one job on this show, and that is to show up on time and know my lines and be effective. So, that’s what I’m gonna continue to do. So, whatever Josh Griffith (executive producer and head writer, Y&R) and the writers put in front of me, then that’s what’s gonna happen.”\n\nRecently Joshua made some soap headlines when he was asked what plot twist he would still like to do, and during our conversation he jokingly adjusted his statement after getting some blowback from some fans, “I said in a recent interview that I would like to have a crossover with The Bold and the Beautiful,” began Joshua. “I’d like to apologize to Jacqui MacInnes Wood (Steffy, B&B). I’m sure she got some warnings from the people who really despise Nick and think he’s an old creepy guy, that he’s got his eyes set on the beautiful Steffy. I just think the idea of a sort of crossover triangle would be pretty amazing. Logistically. I don’t know how it could ever work. I’m sure it couldn’t, but just the idea of it sounds interesting.”\n\nComing up with a variation on his Y&R and B&B crossover story, Joshua added, “So, for all those people that think Nick is a creepy old predator, then I’ll do (the story) with Katherine Kelly Lang (Brooke, B&B). Will that make everyone happy? Either one. Give me either one and I’ll sell the hell out of this story. Just give me a chance, Brad Bell (EP and head writer, B&B) and Josh, we can make it work.”\n\nWatch our full interview with Joshua Morrow below.\n\nNow, let us know, are you still rooting for Sharon and Nick, Phyllis and Nick, or might you like to see him in a new romance with Steffy or Brooke on The Bold and the Beautiful?
