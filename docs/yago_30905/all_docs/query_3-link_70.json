        "text": "GILBERT, Iowa (KCCI) - A 79-year-old grandmother is making a remarkable recovery after she was crushed by her cement basement wall as a powerful tornado swept through Greenfield, Iowa.\n\nDixie Dingman, known as “Grandma Dixie,” puts one foot in front of the other every single day. It’s an activity she doesn’t take for granted because just months ago, she didn’t know if she’d ever be able to walk again. That’s when she was buried alive in debris after her house took a direct hit May 21 from an EF-4 tornado.\n\n“I saw the south wall of cement coming at me, and it was just right there. I said, ‘God, am I going to die?’” Dingman said.\n\nThe 79-year-old survived but suffered a broken back, 10 broken ribs and a cracked sternum. She soon underwent a spinal fusion at the Iowa Clinic.\n\n“That involves rods and screws to stabilize these fractures and prevent any abnormal motion and prevent further injury to the nerves and the spinal cord,” said Dr. Royce Woodroffe, the neurosurgeon who did Dingman’s surgery.\n\nRecovery from the procedure typically takes three to six months, Woodroffe says, and sometimes even longer for someone Dingman’s age. But in less than three months, the 79-year-old is already back up and walking again.\n\n“I don’t know that I’ve ever seen somebody recover as quickly as I’ve seen her recover,” Woodroffe said. “She was very determined to get back on her feet, and she certainly has done that already.”\n\nDingman says she is “doing fantastic,” thanks to her doctors. She uses a walker to get around and enjoys going for strolls in the neighborhood. She also recently drove a car for the first time since the incident and even went shopping by herself.\n\n“It feels very good. That’s why I’m not still very much,” she said. “I am a goer, a doer. I want to get out.”\n\nDingman says her positive attitude and good sense of humor give her strength. She likes to wear a shirt made for her to commemorate her ordeal. It reads, “Of course I survived an EF-4 tornado, we were both cyclones.”\n\nBut most importantly, she says it’s her faith in God that has carried her through.\n\n“I’ve got to give God all the credit,” she said. “Praise to my family and to my God.”\n\nDingman is currently living with her daughter and son-in-law in Gilbert. She won’t be moving back to Greenfield, but she says she’s looking forward to once again living by herself, this time in a home closer to family, soon."
