        "text": "A woman in Dallas, Texas, has died from West Nile, a virus spread though mosquito bites. As much of the United States approaches peak mosquito season, officials are warning about increased circulation and urging people to protect themselves.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dallas County Health and Human Services announced that a woman had died after contracting West Nile Virus, the seventh death from the virus in the U.S. this year. The female patient, who had underlying conditions, developed a severe form of the illness which called West Nile Neuroinvasive disease.\n\nWhile most people infected with West Nile do not show symptoms, about 20% can develop a fever and flu-like illness, per the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Rarely, the virus can cause severe inflammation of the central nervous system and can be fatal.\n\nThe virus, which spreads from infected mosquitos to mammals, peaks in the U.S. every summer. Over 100 human cases have been reported in at least 26 states so far, per the CDC. According to experts, viral activity appears to be earlier then expected.\n\nWhat is West Nile virus and where is it spreading in the U.S.? Experts discuss West Nile symptoms, transmission, risk, and prevention.\n\nWhat is West Nile virus?\n\n\"West Nile virus is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States and cases are seen every year,\" Dr. Erin Staples, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC’s Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, tells TODAY.com.\n\nWest Nile virus can infect mosquitoes, birds, humans, horses and other mammals. \"It was first identified in 1937 in a region of Uganda West of the Nile River, hence the term West Nile,\" Dr. Daniel Pastula, chief of neuro-infectious diseases and global neurology at the University of Colorado, tells TODAY.com.\n\nSince it was first detected in the United States in New York City in 1999, West Nile has expanded throughout North America, and now is endemic in many parts of the U.S., Pastula says.\n\nIn the U.S., cases of West Nile are most commonly reported during mosquito season, which spans from summer through the fall. \"We typically see our West Nile transmission season from July through October, so right now we're in peak season,\" says Pastula. Mosquito season may vary depending on state and climate.\n\nHow does West Nile spread to humans?\n\nBirds are the primary natural reservoir for West Nile virus, and mosquitoes become infected by feeding on infected birds, Scott Weaver, PhD, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch, tells TODAY.com.\n\n\"It normally exists in a cycle (between birds and mosquitoes),\" says Pastula. Mosquitoes bite local birds and become infected if the bird has a high enough viral load. Infected mosquitoes can pass the virus to more birds and non-infected birds will eat infected mosquitoes.\n\nOccasionally, there's a \"spillover,\" says Weaver, and mosquitoes transmit the virus to mammals or humans.\n\nThe virus is transmitted primarily to humans from the Culex species of mosquitoes. West Nile does not spread from person to person, as humans are considered a “dead-end hosts,” per the CDC.\n\nThere are very rare exceptions where West Nile virus has spread through blood transfusions, organ transplants and laboratory exposures, Pastula notes. In a very small number of cases, the virus has spread from mother to baby during pregnancy or breastfeeding.\n\nThere is no evidence that humans can contract West Nile through contact with infected birds, alive or dead, per the CDC. Generally speaking, “if you don’t get bit by a mosquito, you’re not going to get West Nile,” says Pastula.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of West Nile?\n\nThe vast majority of people infected with West Nile, 70–80%, do not experience any symptoms, says Weaver, and about one in five people may develop a non-specific flu-like illness.\n\nThese typically begin about one week after being bitten by an infected mosquito, but the incubation period can range from two to 14 days, Pastula adds. Symptoms of West Nile virus may include:\n\nFever\n\nHeadache\n\nBody aches\n\nJoint pain\n\nRash\n\nNausea or vomiting\n\nLack of appetite\n\nSwollen lymph nodes\n\nSymptoms are typically mild and most people recover within a week, per the CDC, but fatigue can last for weeks or months.\n\nIn about 1 in 150 people who develop symptoms, the virus can infect the central nervous nervous system and cause severe illness called West Nile neuroinvasive disease, the experts note. This can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or spinal cord (meningitis) and acute flaccid myelitis or a polio-like illness, says Pastula.\n\nSymptoms of severe West Nile neuroinvasive disease include:\n\nHigh fever\n\nSevere headaches\n\nStiff neck\n\nConfusion\n\nMuscle weakness\n\nSeizures\n\nVision loss\n\nParalysis\n\nComa\n\nWest Nile neuroinvasive disease can be life-threatening and fatal, especially in older people, says Weaver. \"People who survive the neurologic form often have a very tough road to recovery and (impaired) motor function and cognitive ability,\" Weaver adds.\n\nAnyone infected with West Nile virus can develop severe illness, but certain people are at higher risk, the experts say. These include people who are over the age of 60, people who have received organ transplants, and people with underlying conditions such as cancer, diabetes and kidney disease.\n\nWest Nile virus is diagnosed through laboratory testing, clinical symptoms and history of exposure, per the CDC. The vast majority of people who are infected never get diagnosed, Weaver adds.\n\nWhere is West Nile spreading in the U.S.?\n\nSo far in 2024, there have been 103 human cases of West Nile virus reported in the U.S., which includes 68 cases of neuroinvasive disease, per CDC data as of Aug. 6. These cases have been reported in at least 26 states.\n\nThe states reporting the highest number of human cases of West Nile virus in 2024 are Texas, Nebraska, Nevada, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nThe recent death reported in Dallas, Texas, was the sixth human case of West Nile and the first death in Dallas County, according to local officials.\n\n\"We’re seeing a pretty typical pattern now where the the epicenter is in the Southern central area,\" says Weaver.\n\n“This is is the time of year when cases of West Nile virus increase,” says Staples. However, experts say the virus is circulating at higher levels than usual for this time of summer.\n\n“It is still relatively early in the transmission year for this virus. We're starting to get into the heart of it, so it’s pretty concerning that we’re seeing so many cases already ... (and) there's a lot more to come,” Weaver notes.\n\n“While the number of West Nile virus cases reported so far (in 2024) are similar to those for last year, some areas did see WNV activity earlier (this year),” says Staples.\n\nThe number of cases of West Nile virus reported in the U.S. each year varies from several hundred to several thousand, per CDC data. The majority of cases are reported in August and September.\n\nSo far this year, the CDC has received seven preliminary reports of deaths in people with \"evidence of West Nile infection\" in the U.S, says Staples. “It’s important to note that the reports are preliminary and some could change after follow up review,” Staples adds.\n\nThere were a total of 182 deaths from West Nile in the U.S. in 2023, per the CDC. \"The number of deaths reported so far in 2024 is similar to what was reported at this time last year,\" says Staples.\n\n“However, WNV tends to be unpredictable and varies from year to year so we don’t know specifically how this year will be compared to others,” says Staples.\n\nRegional patterns can also vary each year. \"It depends on the amount of mosquitoes and when they come out. It depends on bird migration patterns. It depends on temperature, rainfall, irrigation and more,\" says Pastula.\n\nRising temperates due to climate change have increased the risk of human exposure to West Nile virus, NBC News previously reported.\n\nWest Nile virus treatment\n\nThere is no specific treatment or vaccine to prevent West Nile virus, the experts note.\n\nIn people who develop a mild flu-like illness, rest, fluids and over-the-counter pain relievers can help ease symptoms, Weaver notes.\n\nPeople who develop severe cases of West Nile neuroinvasive disease may require hospitalization, intravenous fluids, pain management or other supportive care to prevent complications, per the CDC.\n\nHow to prevent West Nile virus\n\nEveryone can take steps to help protect themselves from West Nile virus by preventing mosquito bites, says Staples. The experts recommend the following measures:\n\nWear EPA-registered insect repellents\n\nUse window screens and air conditioning\n\nCover skin by wearing long-sleeve shirts and long pants\n\nLimit time spent outside from dusk to dawn, when mosquitoes are most active\n\nAround the home, dump or drain any standing water where mosquitoes can breed\n\n“You can’t prevent it 100%, but you can absolutely reduce your risk,” says Pastula."
