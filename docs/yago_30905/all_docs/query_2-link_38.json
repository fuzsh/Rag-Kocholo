        "text": "Andrea Evans, beloved for her portrayal of the irrepressible Tina Lord on One Life to Live and who played the role of Patty Williams on The Young and the Restless, has died. The actress was 66 years old.\n\nIn Memoriam: Andrea Evans\n\nThe news of Evans’s sudden passing on Sunday was reported by Deadline, which attributed the news to casting director Don Carroll. The site reported that she passed away from cancer. According to her IMDB page, she was a Celebrity Ambassador for City Of Hope’s “Walk of Hope Against Breast Cancer” as well as several animal rights organizations.\n\nRon Carlivati, former head writer of OLTL, shared his memories of Evans on Instagram. “I am absolutely heartbroken to learn of the untimely passing of Andrea Evans who played the iconic Tina Lord Roberts on One Life to Live and is one of the reasons I fell in love with soap operas in the first place,” Carlivati (now Days of our Lives’ head writer) wrote. “Andrea brought such a sense of guilelessness and fun to a selfish and scheming character and made you fall in love with her. After watching her as a fan for many years, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to write for her and it was one of the most satisfying experiences of my professional career.\n\n“I will treasure the memories of Tina trying to misappropriate the Crown Jewels of Mendorra with her beloved dog David Vickers under her arm,” Carlivati continued. “She survived a trip over the Iguazu Falls and made her way back to Llanview to crash Cord’s wedding to Kate Sanders with a stolen baby in her arms, and that’s how I will always remember both the character and the actress: resilient and resourceful, but also so warm and kind. My thoughts and prayers are with her family. Rest in peace, dear Andrea.”\n\nAndrea Lynn Evans was born on June 18, 1957, in Aurora, Illinois, to Robert E. Evans and Audrey Evans. She had a brother, Robert Jeffrey Evans.\n\nEvans became a fan favorite on soaps after joining OLTL as Tina Clayton, the daughter of Viki Lord Riley’s (Erika Slezak) best friend, Irene Manning. Viki took Tina in after Irene’s passing, not knowing that she’d been fathered by her late dad Victor Lord. Tina’s escapades and willful nature endeared her to audiences. She reprised Tina on OLTL in the show’s final months over a decade ago.\n\nEvans earned two Daytime Emmy nominations over the course of her career including one for playing Tina in 1988. While Tina is arguably Evans’s most well-known role, she also played Patty on Y&R, Tawny on The Bold and the Beautiful, and Rebecca on Passions.\n\nEvans also appeared on the web soaps The Bay and DeVanity. She is survived by her husband, Steve Rodriguez, and daughter Kylie. Evans had recently completed work on her upcoming memoir My One Life To Live. Soap Hub sends sincere condolences to the family of Andrea Evans, as well as her friends, co-workers, and fans at this difficult time."
