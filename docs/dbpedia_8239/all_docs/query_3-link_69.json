        "text": "Joseph Watts Bryant Jr, loving husband, father, former tractor trailer driver and dedicated friend, died peacefully at his home in Odenton, Maryland on February 5, 2023. He was 86.\n\nBorn in Warrenton, VA, Joe grew up with his parents and younger sister Charlotte. Joe had an incredible and adventurous journey through life. He treasured country living and was surrounded by four legged friends throughout his life, but truck driving was in his soul. He began driving at the ripe old age of 12 traveling with truck drivers throughout the country for his father’s cattle business. He drove livestock for many years until he answered Uncle Sam’s call and enlisted March 15,1956 where he served as a Heavy Weapons Operator until January 4, 1958.\n\nAfter returning from the Army, his first marriage produced three children: Kevin, Jeff and Debbie. He continued to drive for a variety of businesses before settling at Safeway Inc. in 1976. In 1978, he met the love of his life Dorothy V. Bryant. They married in 1980. He continued driving for Safeway for 26 years until he retired, with Dottie, in 2002. Joe loved trucking and took great pride in his remarkable abilities, winning truck rodeos on the east coast multiple years. In 1984 Joe and Dottie were selected to represent Safeway as Safeway Olympic Ambassadors. Together they drove an incredible Olympic themed tractor trailer from Washington DC – Los Angeles, CA, with stops across the country.\n\nHe joined his wife in their love for horses and together they owned and operated Three Springs Farm and bred and raised Arabian horses for 38 years. He was heavily engaged in the local Arabian Horse Association and was an active member for many years. Their favorite horse, Sunshine, provided hours of joy for them and continued to be Joe’s companion after Dottie passed in 2018.\n\nJoe is survived by his children from his first marriage, Kevin Bryant (Cathy), Jeffrey Bryant, and Deborah Echard (William); his stepchildren with Dottie, Patrick Hatcherson, Kimaywin Greeley (Charles – Deceased), and Michelle Marx (Norman). He is also survived by 16 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his wife, Dorothy Bryant and his parents Joseph Watts Bryant, Sr. and Annie Lee Carner Bryant and his sister Charlotte Boone."
