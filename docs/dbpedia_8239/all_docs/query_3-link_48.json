        "text": "Jeffrey C. Lettre, 27, of Berlin, N.H., passed away peacefully on Saturday December 18th, 2021 at Massachusetts General Hospital from complications with pneumonia. He was born in Littleton, NH on June 8, 1994 the son of Jean-Paul and Wendy (Martin) Lettre.\n\nEarly on Jeffrey was diagnosed with Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. He lived at home until the age of 16 before moving to Cedarcrest Center for Children with Disabilities in Keene, NH. He then aged out and transitioned to Coos County Nursing Home in Berlin, N.H. until 2019 when he had complications with pneumonia. For the last 2 ½ years, Jeffrey has been at the Layfayette Center in Franconia, N. H. He has had pneumonia 3 more times since 2019. He was a fighter and just couldn’t fight any more.\n\nJeffrey had a purpose and that was to spread unconditional love, joy and happiness to all he met. We are thankful that he defied all odds and achieved so much in his short time here with us. His care takers would see who got a chest thump first on the shift they were workings. Jeffrey has brought comfort into people’s lives. To all long-term care staff, healthcare professionals, school teachers, and in school nurses, Thank You for all your hard work to help our son. So many loved him as their own. Where there should be no favorites, Jeffrey was a favorite of many.\n\nJeffrey leaves behind his parents Jean-Paul and Wendy (Martin) Lettre of Berlin, N.H.; his brother Justin Lettre of Madison, NH; his maternal grandmother Wilma (Hamlin) Martin of Gorham, NH; his aunts and uncles Wade and Amy Martin of Chantilly, VA, Normand and Margaret Lettre of Berlin, N.H., Marcel and Rosia Lettre of Taylorsville, UT, Stan and Monique Bulsterbaum of Taylorsville, UT, Robert and Cathy Lettre of Zephyrhills, FL; several nephews, nieces and cousins. He was predeceased by his paternal grandparents Oscar and Aurora (Lacasse) Lettre and his maternal grandfather Wallace C. Martin.\n\nA Funeral Service will be held on Tuesday, December 28, 2021 at 11am at the Bryant & Fleury-Patry Funeral Home, 180 Hillside Ave., Berlin, NH. Relatives and friends are invited to call on Monday evening from 4pm to 6pm. Interment will take place in the spring at Hillcrest Cemetery in Milan.
