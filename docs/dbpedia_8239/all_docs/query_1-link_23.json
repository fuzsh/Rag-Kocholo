        "text": "By: The Jeffrey S. Moorad Sports Law Journal*\n\nEarly Years\n\nOn August 23, 1978, Kobe Bryant, a Philadelphia legend, was born.[1] Kobe became more than a local phenomenon—he embraced the national stage at an early age in high school, becoming a fan favorite in the NBA, and Hollywood royalty among the Hollywood elites, not to mention Kobe was an international star the likes of which very few Americans have ever seen.[2] Kobe’s career speaks for itself—on and off the basketball court—but he never lost track of his roots, his fans, his humbling beginnings, and the lessons he learned along the way, which he graciously instilled to his fans throughout his lifetime. [3]\n\nKobe, the son of Joe Bryant, a former NBA player himself, began playing basketball at a young age.[4] When Kobe’s father retired from the NBA and moved to Italy to begin a new playing career in 1984, Kobe embraced the Italian culture and his love for basketball continued to flourish.[5] Like most of Europe, Italy was more focused on soccer, but Kobe became enthralled with basketball.[6] At the age of six, Kobe knew basketball was going to be instrumental in his life, just like his father.[7]\n\nJoe Bryant’s career in Italy moved from Rieti, in the middle of the country, to Pistoia, and then Reggio Calabria, in the south, where he won Player of the Year Award twice.[8] Following his father’s footsteps, Kobe would later win MVP honors in the NBA, along with many other recognitions.[9] But in Italy, Kobe began to set himself apart from his peers.[10] Playing the game ran in the family, and Kobe felt a connection with the sport in a country far away from where he would step into the international spotlight.[11] In Italy, Kobe played on the Pallacanestro Reggiana youth team, the same team his father played for.[12] Kobe stayed connected to Italy and his roots there—he often returned for charity events, referred to his upbringing there, and not only became fluent in Italian, but became known for his affection of other cultures.[13] For example, in December 2019 Kobe made headlines for heckling Luka Doncic in Slovenian, taking his post-retirement trash talking to a new level.[14] All of these instances pointed to Kobe’s likeability, and his character, which made him a well-liked celebrity throughout the world and one that many other athletes looked up to.[15] The beginning of Kobe’s career took off when he returned to the Philadelphia area in 1991, and began his high school career.[16]\n\nLower Merion Career\n\n“Rest at the end, not in the middle.” [17]\n\nThis saying of Kobe’s high school English teacher became an integral part of the basketball star’s lifestyle, a base for the Mamba Mentality that became synonymous with greatness.[18] Whether he knew it or not, Mr. Fisk found the perfect way to describe Kobe’s career at Lower Merion High School, the launching point for a decorated NBA career. [19]\n\nLower Merion hadn’t been known as a traditional basketball power; in the suburbs of Philadelphia, the school wasn’t labeled as the toughest program in the area.[20] Kobe settled into his freshman year at Lower Merion simply because his family had settled in the area after returning from Europe at the completion of his father’s professional career.[21] Suiting up in maroon, Kobe made the varsity roster immediately, and as his high school coach claimed, he began to “set the foundation and showed us how to do it.”[22] Building the program certainly did not happen right away, as the Aces went 4-20 during that first season.[23]\n\nAfter a long four-win season, Kobe led Lower Merion to an impressive 77-13 record over the next three years, garnering national attention along the way as a rising star. [24] In true Mamba fashion, Kobe broke out as a professional prospect during his junior season, where he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 5.2 assists per game.[25] Leading the team by spending time at all five positions, his junior campaign ended with him earning the title of 1995 Pennsylvania Player of the Year.[26]\n\nThe 1995-1996 senior year was just as spectacular, with Kobe averaging 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4 steals, and 3.8 blocked shots per game.[27] After starting the season at 1-3, Lower Merion won thirty straight games to end the year as PIAA State Champions with a 48-43 win over Erie Cathedral Prep.[28] When Kobe took off his Lower Merion Aces jersey for the last time in 1996, he was the Naismith High School Player of the Year, the Gatorade Men’s National Basketball Player of the Year, a McDonald’s All-American, and a USA Today All-USA First Team selection.[29] He finished his high school career with a Pennsylvania state record 2,883 points, one of the many accomplishments prompting his alma mater to retire his No. 33 jersey in 2002.[30]\n\nKobe put the Philadelphia suburbs on the map, with his high school career generating so much excitement that scouts and media often roamed the halls, in addition to attending his games.[31] While his basketball career was outstanding to the point of disbelief, Kobe’s reputation as a competitor extended far beyond the court.[32] One of his teachers, John Osipowicz, recalls a time in class where the star wrote a short story about a player stepping up to the free throw line, with his team a point behind.[33] With a surprise ending, the individual missed both shots and the team lost the game.[34] Osipowicz reflects that Kobe “was so much of a winner, but even at 17 he was aware you could lose,” something that appeared to show the depths of the high-schooler’s basketball IQ.[35] Kobe didn’t lose much throughout his career, but it was a possibility he was always aware of, something that contributed to his demanding nature, expecting not only himself, but also his teammates to put in more work than their competitors, every single day.[36]\n\nHaving forgone college to enter the NBA draft, Lower Merion High School exists as a proud connection to Kobe Bryant’s legendary career.[37] Having renamed the gym in his honor, future generations now have the opportunity to celebrate his contributions to the game.[38] Kobe’s high school career translated directly into his professional career, and directly reflects Mr. Fisk’s mantra.[39] A kid from the suburbs outworked all his peers, held all those around him accountable to his championship standards, and most memorably, he never once rested in the middle, becoming a legend in the game of basketball.[40]\n\n1996 – 2006 NBA Career\n\n“[I]t wasn’t in vogue to take high school players” when the Los Angeles Lakers acquired an 18-year old Kobe Bryant in the 1996 NBA Draft.[41] And yet, the Lakers decided to obtain Kobe from the Charlotte Hornets after watching his pre-draft workout.[42] Little did the franchise know that Kobe would go on to become the greatest Los Angeles Laker of all time.\n\nKobe entered the league wearing the number 8.[43] He went scoreless in his NBA debut.[44] But even then “you could see the competitive fire and the nature of him as an individual.”[45] In his rookie year, Kobe was named the Slam Dunk Champion during the 1997 NBA All-Star Weekend.[46] When Kobe was 19 years old, he became the youngest-ever to start in an NBA All-Star Game.[47] At the age of 20, he became an official starter for the Lakers.[48]\n\nKobe continued to perfect his craft and nurture his competitive spirit under the guidance of Phil Jackson and with the support of Shaquille O’Neal.[49] In his first NBA Finals appearance, Kobe emerged as a premier player and assisted the Lakers in winning its first NBA Championship in over a decade.[50] The following year, Kobe and the Lakers routed every opponent standing in their way of the NBA Finals.[51] In the 2001 NBA Finals, Kobe exhibited exceptional athleticism, remarkable endurance and fierce leadership in order to earn the Lakers a consecutive championship title.[52]\n\nDuring 2001-2002 season, Kobe played in 80 regular season games for the first time in his career.[53] He averaged 25 points, 5 assists, and 5 rebounds per game and successfully led to the Lakers to its third straight NBA Finals.[54] Moreover, Kobe’s stellar performance against the New Jersey Nets enabled the Lakers to secure it third consecutive NBA championship.[55] However, Kobe remained unsatisfied and unwavering in his quest to dominate the league. In 2003 and 2004, he was named to the All-NBA First Team and NBA All-Defensive First Team due to his unique scoring ability and defensive prowess.[56] On January 22, 2006, Kobe scored an astonishing 81 points and willed the Lakers to “victory against the Toronto Raptors.”[57] In his final years wearing the number eight, Kobe was recognized by all as an NBA All-Star who was able to “pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of [his] ability.”[58]\n\n2006 – 2016 NBA Career\n\nThe year 2006 marked the halfway point in Kobe’s 20-year NBA career. [59] Hanging up his number 8 Los Angeles Lakers jersey, Kobe adopted the number 24 at the beginning of the 2006-07 season, a return to the number he had donned early in high school. [60] The change was intended to create a “clean slate” for Kobe as he matured in both his professional and personal lives.[61] Instead of slowing down, however, the legend was preparing to play some of the best basketball of his career.[62]\n\nStrictly by the numbers, Kobe’s last ten years in the NBA equaled, and even exceeded, the offensive output of his first ten.[63] Early in 2006, he scored 81 points in a historic game against the Toronto Raptors, a single-game showing only surpassed by the Philadelphia Warriors’ Wilt Chamberlain, who scored 100 points against the New York Knicks in 1962.[64] During the period between 2006 and 2016, Kobe averaged 28.33 points per game; in the 2006-07 and 2007-08 seasons, he averaged more than 30 points per game.[65] In fact, during the 2014-2015 season, Bryant overtook Michael Jordan to become the third-highest point scorer in the history of the NBA.[66]\n\nThe back half of Kobe’s career was replete with both individual and team accomplishments.[67] This ten-year period saw him named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player for the first and only time; the award was bestowed on him in 2008. [68] He won gold medals as a member of Team USA at the Olympics in both 2008 and 2012.[69] Every single All-Star Game between 2006 and 2016 included Kobe Bryant.[70] He captured his fourth and fifth NBA championship rings in 2009 and 2010 in matchups against the Orlando Magic and Boston Celtics, respectively.[71] Following a string of injuries, his larger-than-life NBA career ended on April 13, 2016 after a win against the Utah Jazz.[72] Despite these injuries, Kobe scored 60 points in his final game, a league record for most points scored in a player’s last game that still stands today. [73]\n\nThis period was significant for Kobe off the court, as well. [74] He became a father to Gianna Bryant in 2006 and to Bianka Bryant in 2016, the second and third of his four daughters. [75] In 2013, he co-founded an investment firm called Bryant Stibel with Web.com founder Jeff Stibel, and he launched a media company called Granity with the goal of “creating new ways to tell stories around sports.”[76] In fact, Granity was responsible for creating an Oscar-winning short film featuring Kobe’s poem “Dear Basketball,” which he released in 2015 to announce his retirement from professional basketball. [77] With all of these accomplishments in mind, one thing is clear: while 2016 may have marked the end of Kobe Bryant’s time in the NBA, it also marked the beginning of “what would have been just as meaningful a second act.”[78]\n\nRetirement\n\nAfter his retirement from basketball in 2016, some of Kobe’s peers have noted they had never seen him happier than the last three years of his life.[79] The Lakers retired both of his numbers, 8 and 24, in 2017.[80] In 2018, Kobe won an Oscar for Dear Basketball, in the Best Animated Short Film category.[81] The film was based on a poem Kobe wrote for the Players’ Tribune during his final NBA season.[82] Kobe was also involved in many investment projects, including Bryant Stibel & Co., an investment firm Kobe co-founded before retirement.[83] As of 2019, the firm invested in “tech, media, data, and companies believed to have the potential to become ‘unicorns.’”[84]\n\nOutside of his post-retirement professional accomplishments, Kobe has stayed involved with sports.[85] In 2018, Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Academy.[86] This academy supports youth programs in a variety of sports.[87] In addition, Kobe mentored many athletes, inside and out of basketball, and male and female.[88]\n\nKobe’s greatest accomplishment, on and off the court, was his family, which includes his wife, Vanessa and his four daughters: Natalia, Gianna, Bianka, and Capri.[89] Spending time more quality time with his family, was the best part of retirement for the NBA legend.[90] Kobe wanted to “foster a love of sports in daughters,” and in 2018, he wrote a children’s book, Legacy and the Queen, to inspire his daughters to play sports and to work hard.[91] Part of the reason he founded the Mamba Sports Academy were for his daughters, and he coached Gianna and her Mamba basketball team.[92] Kobe never felt he needed a son because Gianna would carry on the Bryant family basketball legacy.[93] Finally, Kobe loved being a dad, and specifically he loved being a girl dad.[94] Through all of his retirement activities, that fact shines through.\n\nLasting Impact\n\nKobe’s Mamba Mentality permeated into the lives of every one of his teammates, both at the professional and Olympic level, as well as people of every profession.[95] Defined as an unending desire to capitalize each and every opportunity to get better, Kobe approached every practice with the goal of pushing himself and his teammates to their full potential.[96] Legendary players, such as Dwayne Wade, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, and Shaquille O’Neil, each unquestionably attributed a portion of their success in the sport to their encounters with Kobe and his mentality. [97] In an interview just a few weeks before his untimely passing, Kobe explained that “he was born talented, but worked as if he had no talent.”[98]\n\nIn the realm of youth sports, Kobe’s training as a father of four translated into an unending desire to utilize his talents for the next generation of athletes.[99] In 2018, the Mamba Sports Academy opened in Thousand Oaks, California, offering a variety of training opportunities for young athletes.[100] His own daughters, Gianna and Natalia, each harnessed their respective athletic talents utilizing this platform, along with thousands of others.[101] In the wake of his passing, his legacy of the Mamba Academy will continue to provide the opportunity of for participants at all ages to get a taste of the eternal Mamba Mentality.[102]\n\nTestimonials from Writers\n\n“When I think of Kobe Bryant, the first thing that comes to mind is his one-of-a-kind mentality. Admittedly, I also think about the countless number of NBA championships, All-Star games, Olympic medals, and other on the court successes, but I see these accomplishments as being a result of his mentality, and not the other way around. The vast outpouring of love coming from every basketball player, past and present, I believe is a great tribute to just how deeply this mentality permeated the game. Mamba Mentality is something I will never forget because I believe it will continue to live on through each and every one of us.”\n\n- Catherine DeSilvester, Class of ‘20\n\n“Kobe epitomized the idea that there is no such thing as peaking. Even after he'd gone as far as he could go as a professional basketball player, he never stopped finding new ways to grow, learn, and chase excellence. And he lifted up those around him, too- as a coach, as an entrepreneur, and as the supportive \"girl dad\" of his four daughters. While it's hard to believe that he's gone, it's a comfort to think of all the good he left behind.”\n\n- Rachel Insalaco, Class of ‘21\n\n“‘Mamba Mentality is a constant quest to find answers. It’s that infinite curiosity to want to be better, to figure things out. Mamba Mentality is you’re going, you’re competing, you’re not worried about the end result . . . You’re not worried about what people may say. You’re not worried about disappointing others. You’re not worried about any of that, you’re just focused on being in the moment.’[103] Kobe Bryant’s mental approach to the game of basketball shaped my personal perspective on life.”\n\n- Nkiruka Umegbolu, Class of ‘20\n\n“Growing up as a college basketball coach’s kid, Kobe Bryant was a name I’ve known from the time I could talk. I spent years on the sidelines studying the game, seeing players attempting to incorporate the Mamba Mentality day-in and day-out, knowing just how important he meant to players at every level of basketball. Whether you’re a Lakers fan or not, Kobe is the name you associate with true leadership, with championships, with holding those around you accountable.\n\nAnd aside from every legendary accomplishment on the court, I felt a connection to Kobe because of the bond he shared with his daughter over the game of basketball, something that is very close to my family. As the daughter of a #GirlDad in the basketball world, I related to the courtside conversations and teachable moments we saw him share with Gigi. Thank you, Kobe, for showing us what it means to be great, but more importantly, what it means to love through the game.”\n\n- Kirsten Reilly, Class of ’21\n\n*Gregory Bailey, Editor in Chief; Catherine DeSilvester, Executive Editor; Laurel Stout, Managing Editor of Technology; Nkiruka Umegbolu, Managing Editor of Symposia and Special Projects; Rachel Insalaco, Staff Writer; Kirsten Reilly, Staff Wri\n\n[1] See Kobe Bryant Biography, Biography (last updated Jan. 30, 2020), https://www.biography.com/athlete/kobe-bryant (providing dates and place of birth); Jeré Longman & Sarah Mervosh, Kobe Bryant, Philly Guy, N.Y.
