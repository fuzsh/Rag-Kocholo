Jeff was a graduate of Habersham Central High School where he was very active with Key Club and the HCHS Band of Blue. He graduated from North Georgia College with a degree in Business and was employed with the Duane Hartness State Farm Insurance Office in Demorest.\n\nFollowing graduation from college, Jeff lived in Central Florida for several years, where he worked as the factory service parts manager for Correct Craft Inc., the maker of Ski Nautique boats. Jeff enjoyed spending time with family and friends. He was an avid motorcycle enthusiast who also enjoyed playing the piano, camping, and caring for his animals. Jeff was so proud of his nieces and nephews and was a staunch supporter of their involvement in sports; he attended many games to cheer them on! He was a long-time member of B. C. Grant Baptist Church.\n\nSurvivors include his long-time friend and companion, David Williams, of Cornelia; his brother and sister-in-law, J. Michael and Donna Dill Shirley, of Cornelia; two nieces, Marisa Whittington (Stan) and Rachelle Woodruff (Ricky), of Habersham County; two great-nieces and three great-nephews; and a large number of aunts, uncles, and cousins.\n\nVisitation will be on Sunday, August 11, 2024, from 2 until 7 pm at McGahee-Griffin & Stewart Funeral Home.\n\nA private graveside service will be held at Yonah Memorial Garden in Demorest.\n\nNo flowers please.

Toccoa Highway, Clarkesville, Georgia 30523.\n\nAn online guest register is available and may be viewed at www.mcgaheegriffinandstewart.com.\n\nMcGahee-Griffin & Stewart Funeral Home of Cornelia, Georgia (706/778-8668) is in charge of arrangements."
