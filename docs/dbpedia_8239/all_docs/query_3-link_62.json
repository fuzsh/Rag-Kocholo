        "text": "VICTORIA R. WINSOR\n\nCLINTON – Victoria Robertson Winsor, 66, passed away on Sunday, July 21, 2024. Vic was born on August 12, 1957, and was raised in East Bridgewater, Massachusetts.\n\nShe graduated from East Bridgewater High School in 1975.\n\nShortly after, she and her now husband, set off on a cross-country adventure on their bicycles, traveling throughout the U.S. and Canada. They ultimately settled in Clinton in 1982. The house was a mere shell but with much determination, it became a home. It is where the boys, Ben and Dan, were born and raised, where fruits and vegetables were grown, canned and made into delicious meals, and where flowers bloomed. Fabric was cut and sewn into beautiful quilts made of love for all family members to sleep under.\n\nVic was an integral part of Winsor Firewood and Logging, and not just keeping the books, running for parts and answering the phone. Last fall she still did not hesitate to climb up on the truck and level off a load of firewood. She could operate a skidder enough to pull a truck through the mud or snow and was a competent firewood processor operator.\n\nVictoria was predeceased by her parents Bruce and Audrey Robertson.\n\nShe will be missed by husband, Brant; sons Benjamin (Katie), of Northwood, New Hampshire, and Daniel, of Canaan; grandchildren Madelyn, Colby and Aleda; sister, Glenda Robertson (husband Dan Doiron), of Augusta; sisters-in-law Jeanne (Anston) Boelsma, of Bethel, and Betsey Cooper, of Bryant Pond; and brothers-in-law Craig (Jen) Winsor, and Neil Winsor, both of East Bridgewater, Massachusetts.\n\nA memorial service was held at Brown Memorial United Methodist Church, in Clinton, on Saturday, August 3. A reception followed next door at Fellowship Hall. Interment at Greenlawn Rest Cemetery will take place at a later date.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Clinton Parks and Recreation Association, 1 Victor Lane, Clinton, ME 04927.\n\nRANDY BISWELL\n\nWINDSOR – Randy Biswell, 79, died on Monday, July 22, 2024, at his home, in Windsor. Randy was born in Ethel, Missouri, on July 21, 1945, to Susan (Strouse) Biswell and Omer Henry Biswell.\n\nRandy retired as a truck driver for Hannaford Trucking. He earned awards for nearly 2,000 miles of accident-free driving. He served in the U.S. Army as an SP4 and earned a National Defense Service Medal and an award as Marksman M-16. There, he met Allen Rogers, a friend and future brother-in-law.\n\nRandy liked solitary activities and small group get-togethers. He introduced the family to Missouri fried pork sandwiches, strawberry shortcake with pie crust rounds, and mashed potato salad.\n\nIn his spare time, he enjoyed woodworking (made beautiful furniture), watching NASCAR races, finding unusual solutions to problems, and keeping the wood fires burning.\n\nHunting season became a lovely walk in the woods carrying a gun, with his friend Dicky Young and fishing was a chance for them to sit in a boat and later tell tales of the huge fish they released. He drove the trails in his Gator with his trusty granddog Dyson at his side.\n\nRandy is survived by his wife of nearly 52 years, Lydia Jean (Rogers); his sons, Robert and Todd; his grandchildren, Korbyn, Haleigh; and great-granddaughter, Renee, all of Windsor; sisters, Carol and husband, Rev. Ralph Peters, of Chanute, Kansas, and Janey and husband Jim Stallo, of Brookfield, Missoui; brother Henry and his wife, Laura, of Ethel, Missouri; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe was predeceased by his parents; and his brother, Jonathan.\n\nArrangements are under the direction of Direct Cremation of Maine in Belfast. A celebration of Randy’s life will be held at a later date.\n\nMemories and condolences may be shared to with the family at http://www.directcremationofmaine.com.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please enjoy a beverage of your choice with a family member or friend or give to a charity of your choice.\n\nJANET P.
