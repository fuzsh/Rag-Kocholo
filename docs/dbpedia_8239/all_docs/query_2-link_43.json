        "text": "Twin Falls- Jeffery Lynn Bryant, 59, of Twin Falls, passed away Saturday May 14, 2016, at his home, surrounded by family and friends. He was born March 5, 1957, in Jerome, Idaho, the son of Arie Buddy Bryant and Mary M. Bartlett Bryant. Jeff was raised in Jerome and attended schools there. Most of his working years were spent in landscaping and he did amazing work. He cared deeply for his clients. His most recent employer was Idahoscapes and he considered working with the Popes like working with his own family. Jeffery loved golfing with his grandsons, brothers and friends. He loved family time and cooking- and the two together was his favorite combo. Jeffery is survived by his loving wife and best friend, Toni Bryant; his daughters Melinda (Manuel) Salinas, Jaimie (CJ) Spencer and Jennifer (Juan) Marin; his grandsons, Tony and Christian Marin; one granddaughter, Cayleanna Spencer; eight siblings and many extended family members and friends. He is preceded in death by his parents. A visitation will be held Friday evening, May 20, 2016 , at Farnsworth Mortuary, 1343 South Lincoln, Jerome, where family and friends may call from 6-8 p.m. Funeral services will be conducted at 11:00 a.m. , Saturday May 21, 2016 , at Life Church of the Magic Valley, 47 East 100 South, Jerome, with a visitation beginning at 10:00 a.m. www.farnsworthmortuary.com"
