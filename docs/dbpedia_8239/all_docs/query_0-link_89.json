        "text": "The Queen and the Prime Minister are leading the nation in honouring the servicemen and women who fought and died during the conflict in Afghanistan as part of a commemoration service today.\n\nIt marks the end of the 13-year combat operations in the country with the families of some of the 453 British soldiers killed and veterans are taking part in the ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral in London.\n\nPrince Harry, who served two tours during the conflict, arrived at the service along with his brother Prince William, his heavily-pregnant wife Kate, as well as the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nFollowing tradition, the Queen and Prince Philip were the last to arrive and the group of royals processed along the cathedral's nave to their seats led by senior clergy including Bishop Chartres and the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.\n\nThe first hymn sung was God is love: let heav'n adore him and the Dean of St Paul's, the Very Reverend Dr David Ison welcomed the congregation in the bidding prayer.\n\nHe thanked the commitment of the nation's service personnel, prayed for the leaders and people in Afghanistan, and went on to say: 'We commemorate with sorrow and regret those who have died in these operations and pray for their families and friends and for all who mourn their loss.\n\n'We remember those who have been injured in body, mind and spirit and we pray for their continued wellbeing and for those who especially support them.'\n\nThe Prime Minister paid tribute to those who fought to free Afghanistan from the Taliban, saying: 'Today we stand together to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the thousands of British men and women who served our country in Afghanistan.\n\n'We take pride in the scale of their achievements, driving out Al Qaeda and building up the Afghan forces so they can begin to take control of their own security.\n\n'Thirteen years on, the terrorist threat to our country from the region has been substantially reduced. Our families are safer because of what our Servicemen and women have done.\n\n'We also pay tribute to the outstanding contribution of our civilians and aid workers who continue to risk their lives in the service of others. Their efforts underline our ongoing commitment to support the people of Afghanistan in building a new future for their country.'\n\nAlso in attendance were The Duchess of Cornwall, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, The Duke of York, The Earl and Countess of Wessex, The Duke of Gloucester, Deputy Prime Minister, Secretary of State for Defence, Service Chiefs and other senior political and military figures.\n\nA cross made of shell casings from the memorial at the main allied base in Afghanistan, Camp Bastion was brought through the cathedral by representatives of the three forces and presented at the altar.\n\nOfficer Cadet Noor Aziz, from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, read a recital before the Archbishop of Canterbury blessed the Camp Bastion cross for its new memorial at the Royal British Legion's National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.\n\nPrayers were read by Squadron leader Adam Booth, from the Permanent Joint Headquarters, Corporal Julian Cocks, from the Royal Marine Reserve, Bristol and Liuetenant Colonel Andrea Lewis, of the Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps.\n\nSarah Bushbye, former Corporal of the Army Medical Services, Kerry Ashworth, mother of Lance Corporal James Ashworth of the Grenadier Guards who was killed, and Darren Fuller, former Colour Sergeant of the Parachute Regiment also said a prayer.\n\nFive detachments made up of serving personnel from the Army, RAF, Royal Navy and the Royal Marines, with a sixth of up to 400 veterans from the conflict, brought together by the Royal British Legion (RBL) will take part in a parade after ceremony.\n\nThey marched in silence past St Paul's accompanied by military bands and pipes and drums, with Prince Charles taking the royal salute, through the centre of London to Guildhall.\n\nA brief ripple of applause broke out from some sections of the crowd, as happened at some military funerals up and down the country for those whose lives had been lost on the battlefields of Afghanistan, but it mainly remained silent throughout.\n\nAircraft from the campaign, including Chinook, Apache and Sea King helicopters, as well as Hercules transport planes and Tornado attack jets, roared over the parade in their own salute.\n\nHundreds of people turned out to line the streets and catch what is likely to be the last time the Duchess of Cambridge will be seen in public before she has her second child.\n\nMembers of the Royal family will later meet those who took part in the commemorations or served in Afghanistan during a series of receptions at Guildhall, the Honourable Artillery Company and Wellington Barracks.\n\nAt the same time military establishments throughout the UK and Germany held events for personnel and families to mark the day in their own way, and the Royal Air Force held a service for personnel and families at Lincoln Cathedral, a place of great symbolic importance for the RAF.\n\nA service was also held in Kabul, Afghanistan were some soldiers remain assisting the Afghan government and Afghan National Defence and Security Forces.\n\nThe Earl and Countess of Wessex were also in attendance with the Duke of Gloucester as well as Tony Blair, who was prime minister at the outbreak of war in 2001.\n\nAlmost 150,000 UK personnel served in the Afghanistan conflict, and 453 British men and women died in the fight against the Taliban insurgency.\n\nAhead of the service, Captain Gary Barrow, who completed three Afghan tours, said friends and colleagues who died fighting in Afghanistan may be gone but will not be forgotten.\n\nHis son Tyler, 13, gave a reading in the ceremony and stood beside Bishop of London Richard Chartres and representatives of other faiths to make 'an act of commitment to the common good' and publicly state that they will strive for peace and seek to heal the wounds of war.\n\nCapt Barrow, 38, originally from Manchester but now living in Andover, Hampshire, said: 'I've lost friends and colleagues, people who served with me, people who served under me, and today we will all be remembering them and we will never forget them.'\n\nThe officer from the King's Royal Hussars added: 'But it's also a chance to say thank you to everybody from the civilians to the families. I work now a lot with families of soldiers who are deployed, and it will certainly be a chance to say thank you to all of them.'\n\nRepresentatives of other nations which took part in the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force were also present.\n\nA spokesman for the Royal British Legion said: 'The end of combat operations in Afghanistan provides us the opportunity to reflect on the 453 service personnel who lost their lives in that conflict and the many thousands more who served their country under trying conditions.\n\n'The Legion salutes them and stands ready to preserve their memory and their welfare.'\n\nFollowing the announcement of the service last month, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said he hoped people throughout the UK would join together in 'remembering those we have lost and recognising the extraordinary courage and dedication of all those who served'.\n\nHe said: 'They leave a proud legacy - terrorists have been prevented from using Afghanistan as a safe haven for attacks on our streets and it is a safer and more prosperous country.'\n\nSpeaking after the ceremony today, he said: 'The service at St Paul’s and the parade were incredibly moving. Seeing the Bastion cross rededicated today brought home the enormity of the contribution and sacrifice that Britain has made to helping Afghanistan become a safer country.\n\n'This was the right way for the whole country to pay tribute to everyone who worked so hard and achieved so much in Afghanistan over 13 years, especially those who sustained life-changing injuries, and those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n'I am delighted that large numbers of our Armed Forces, veterans, their families, and representatives of charities and aid organisations, were able to pause and remember those we have lost, and to recognise the extraordinary courage and dedication of all those who served.'\n\nThe Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton, said: 'Today’s services at St Paul’s Cathedral and around the country were an opportunity to commemorate the service and sacrifice of all who served in Afghanistan.\n\n'They were also an opportunity for us to thank and pay particular tribute to our Service families. They have endured the extreme anxiety of waiting at home and many have had to bear the grief of a loved one lost or badly injured.\n\n'As Chief of Defence Staff I am intensely aware of the debt of gratitude we owe them all.'\n\nThe final chapter in the 13-year conflict came last October when the last British troops were airlifted from the sprawling Camp Bastion base in Helmand Province, leaving just a few hundred personnel in advisory, logistical and support roles to help the Afghan army.\n\nSarah Adams, from Newport in South Wales, whose son Private James Prosser, from 2nd Battalion The Royal Welsh, was killed in Afghanistan in 2009 is at today's service.\n\nShe told BBC Radio 4 this morning: 'James was a driver for a warrior armored vehicle and they were asked to go and clear a compound where Taliban were storing weapons and he went over an IED.\n\n'[Since his death] it has changed. It seems to get harder the longer it goes on. It's easy for the Government to say we're commemorating the end of combat services in Afghanistan but it's never the end for us.\n\n'But James wanted to go. He believed in what he was doing. As much as I wish he hadn't gone, it's very difficult as it doesn't seem to have achieved what they set out to do.\n\n'It's not as safe as they wanted to leave it, I take nothing away from the soldiers who did a fantastic job. They should be remembered always but we didn't leave it in the best position like we were supposed to.'\n\nSpeaking about today's service she said: 'I thinks it's very fitting everybody should remember what our soldiers and their families go through and what they continue to go through but personally Afghanistan and what it did will always haunt me. The whole country should get together and be thankful for what we've got with our armed forces.'\n\nDuane Ashworth, from the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, whose son James from the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guard did two tours of Afghanistan but was killed in 2012, told the Today programme: 'I do believe the country is in a better position than it was 13 years ago, it's now up to the Afghan forces to continue that training to make sure what our lads did continues.\n\n'Obviously I served in the military myself so I understand more than most parents what they were doing over there. James believed what he was doing out there was correct.'\n\nHe added: 'I don't think they'll ever be a line for the families, for the nation it will be a fantastic day, its nice to have our lads and girls recognised.'\n\nAfghan President Ashraf Ghani told the BBC the 453 UK troops had 'paid the ultimate sacrifice to enable us to live in freedom, in hope for peace, prosperity and dignity'.\n\nToday's commemoration comes after Tony Blair admitted that he had not foreseen just how long the struggle in Afghanistan would last when he first deployed troops in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn an interview with Forces TV, the former prime minister said that even now it was not properly understood just how much more there was to be done.\n\n'I think we have not yet understood the depth of this problem, the scale of it, and the need for a comprehensive strategy to deal with it,' he said.\n\n'It is not just Islamic State in Iraq and Syria... It is happening day in and day out - there are thousands of people losing their lives every few weeks.'\n\nHe said he believed his decision to deploy British troops in Afghanistan had been justified, although he acknowledged that families who had lost loved ones may feel differently.\n\n'I always felt that it was right and justified that we were there in Afghanistan, that we were fighting both to remove the Taliban and then to try and stabilise the country. But there is nothing that's really possible to say that could provide true consolation for family of someone who has lost their life,' he said."
