        "text": "Bear Bryant (born September 11, 1913, Kingsland, Arkansas, U.S.—died January 26, 1983, Tuscaloosa, Alabama) was an American college football coach who set a record (later broken) for more games won than any other collegiate coach, with the majority of the victories coming during his tenure (1958–82) at the University of Alabama.\n\nBryant played tackle and was all-state at Fordyce (Arkansas) High School. He went on to the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa (1932–36; B.S., 1936), where he played blocking end. During his collegiate career the team won 23 games, lost 3, and tied 2. He played on the team that beat Stanford University in the Rose Bowl game (1935).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nBryant was an assistant coach at Alabama (1936–40) and at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee (1940–41). After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, he began his career as a head coach in 1945 at the University of Maryland, College Park. Bryant resigned after the president reinstated an athlete Bryant had dismissed for breaking training rules. At the University of Kentucky, Lexington (1946–53), his team won 60 games, lost 23, and tied 5; won the school’s first Southeastern Conference championship; and won three of four bowl games. Bryant left Kentucky after losing a battle of wills with Adolph Rupp as to whether basketball or football should be the dominant sport.\n\nIn 1954, Bryant’s first year as a coach at Texas Agricultural and Mechanical University, College Station, the team lost 9 of 10 games. In the next three seasons, however, they lost only four games and won one Southwest Conference championship."
