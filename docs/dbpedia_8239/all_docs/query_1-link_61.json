        "text": "W. C. Bryant of Bucyrus, has fitted up a Photograph Gallery in the Kingsboro building on East Main street, first door West of Dr. Summer's office. He has had 14 years experience in the business and is prepared to do any class of work. Mr. Bryant makes a speciality of out door work such as buildings on which his terms are very low. Don't fail to give him a call when you want anything in his line. Don't wait for a clear day or a cloudy day is just a good. I have a large light and am prepared to do first class work in all kinds of weather. Some of the very best photographs are made on cloudy days, so don't wait on the weather, one day is as good as another. I will give you first class work. Come any time.\n\nW. C. Bryant\""
