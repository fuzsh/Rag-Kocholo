        "meta_description": "Jeff Bryant, 53, of Humble, passed away February 15, 2010 in Equatorial Guinea, Africa while working for Noble Energy. Jeff was born in Alabama and raised in Florida, where he became an avid Florida State Seminole fan. Jeff had an appointment to the Naval Academy, but injured his knee, and ended up at Montana Tech in Butte, Montana, where everyone called him “Florida”. Among his many other interest, Jeff was a History Buff, where he knew everything there was to know about WW II, an amateur astronomer, avid reader, private pilot, loved offshore fishing and sailing. He worked for Amerada Hess for 26 years, where Randy and Julie Darbonne & Mike Raines became lifelong friends. He worked in Lafayette, East Texas, Houston Off Shore, North Dakota, New Mexico, California, London, Algeria, and most recently in Equatorial Guinea. While working in California, Jeff dabbled in politics and coached a bit of soccer. Jeff also had an affection for all animals, and loved his wife and children more than anything. Jeff is survived by his loving wife; Beth, children; Kelsey Booth and Morgan James Bryant, mother; Mildred Bryant, brothers; James A. Bryant, Jerry D. Bryant, brother-in-law; Troy B.
