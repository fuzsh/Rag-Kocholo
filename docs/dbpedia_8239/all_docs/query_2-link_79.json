        "text": "Austin Peay VII, age 56, of Clarksville, TN passed away on Tuesday, August 6, 2024.\n\nBorn on October 10, 1967, Austin led a life filled with accomplishments and contributions to his community. The family will receive friends from 3-6 p.m. on Sunday, August 11, 2024, and again on Monday from 10 a.m. until 10:45 a.m. at McReynolds-Nave & Larson Funeral Home. Graveside Service will be held at 11 a.m. Monday, August 12, 2024, at Greenwood Cemetery with Deacon Tim Winters officiating.\n\nAustin graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Tennessee with a degree in Political Science followed by a Juris Doctor degree from The University of Tennessee in 1993. Since that time, his dedication to the legal profession shone brightly in his work at Batson-Nolan Law Office, where he made lasting impressions on colleagues and clients alike. He was a member of the Montgomery County and Tennessee Bar Associations, Tennessee County Attorneys Association, Golden Key Honor Society, Phi Beta Kappa, Kiwanis Club of Clarksville, Tennessee Alpha Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity, and a lifelong member of Immaculate Conception Catholic Church. Austin had many accomplishments but can be best remembered for his riddling responses and uncanny humor among friends. He was a trustworthy, dependable and loyal friend to those who were fortunate to know him.\n\nHe enjoyed traveling and had a sense of adventure throughout his life. He once took part in the Running of the Bulls and viewed the Tour de France. While on a trip with family to Alaska, he was inspired to obtain his pilotâ€™s license after flying with a bush pilot and enjoyed this hobby for many years. Austin enjoyed sports throughout his life, at times volunteering with youth and high school football programs and was an early follower of the Nashville Predators and Tennessee Titans.\n\nHe is proceeded in death by his parents, Austin Peay VI and Barbara Wedell Peay. Survivors include his sister, Marty (Grant) Shaw; nephew Landon Austin Shaw; aunt, Delores Porter; uncle John (Patsy) Peay ; cousins, Susie (Kirk) McAllister, Evans (Lori) Peay, Frank (Amy) Peay, and John (Jane) Peay. Serving as pallbearers will be Grant Shaw, Landon Shaw, Evans Peay, Jeff Long, Billy Leavell, Derek Comperry, John Gannon, Scott Bryant, and James Corlew. As a pet owner most of his life, Austin had a deep passion for the welfare of animals, especially his beloved cat, Milton. Austin had a discreet kindness and a generous heart.\n\nArrangements are in the care of McReynolds Nave & Larson Funeral Home."
