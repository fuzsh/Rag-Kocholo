As a forage crop oats has been profitably cultivated in the Oostanaula, Etowah and Coosa valleys, and. all through Mid dle Georgia. The expense of production is comparatively light and under favorable conditions the returns are good. In 1900 there were 467,336 acres and the production was 7,010,040 bushels, valued at $3,434,920. The largest yield'was reported from a farm in Wilkes county. This was 137 bushels to the acre, but farms in DeKalb, Floyd, Coweta and Schley counties reported crops of 100 bushels and over.\n\nOatts, a post-hamlet of Burke county, is fifteen miles southwest of Waynesboro and almost on the Jefferson county line. Louis ville is the nearest railroad station.\n\nOcean City. (See Tybee). Ocee, a post-hamlet of Milton county, is about five miles north west of Duluth, which is the nearest railroad station. Ocher. Strictly speaking ocher is a combination of peroxide of iron with water, but the name has been conferred on various clays colored with iron oxides, the shade of color depending upon the proportion. Subjected to the process of calcination the color is deepened and rendered more permanent. Ocher is found in the iron bearing mud associated with the water pumped from many mines and in natural beds, sometimes several feet in thickness, in different geological formations. In northwest Georgia large de posits of these iron bearing clays are found, being generally asso ciated with the brown iron ores. The most extensive of these de posits are found in what is known as the Weisner quartzite, near Cartersville. They occur chiefly along the western margin of the quartzite, where it has been crushed or broken. The ocher ob tained from these deposits is really a pulverulent form of brown iron ore, is remarkably free from impurities and well adapted to the manufacture of paints and linoleum. The mining and ship ment of yellow ocher has become a considerable industry in Bartow county. At Cartersville there are four mills for preparing the material. For the year ending August 1, 1900, the product of this district was 4,500 tons. It is said that most of this ocher finds its way to England, where it is used in the linoleum factories. The value of .the state's output for the same year was approximately $75,000. Ochillee, a village in the northern part of Chattahoochee county, is at the junction of the Seaboard Air Line and the Central of\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\n19\n\nGeorgia railroads. It has a money order postoffice, express and\n\ntelegraph offices, and is an important trading and shipping point\n\nfor that part of the county. Ochlochnee, an incorporated town in the northwestern part of\n\nThomas county, is on the Albany & Thomasville division of the\n\nAtlantic Coast Line railway, and in 1900 had a population of 244.\n\nIt has a money order postoffice, which supplies mail to the rural\n\ndistricts by means of several free delivery routes, and is an impor tant commercial center and shipping point for that section of the\n\ncounty. Ochwalkee, a village of Montgomery county, is a short distance\n\nwest of Mount Vernon, on the Seaboard Air Line, at the point where it crosses the Oconee river. It has a money order postoffice, express and telegraph service, some mercantile interests and in 1900 reported a population of 100.\n\nOcilla, a town in the eastern part of Irwin county, was incorpor ated by act of the legislature in 1898. It is located on a branch of the Atlantic & Birmingham railroad and a branch of the Sea board Air Line connects it with Fitzgerald. It is the second larg est town in the county, and by the census of 1900 had a population of 805 in the corporate limits arid 1,740 in its entire district. It has express and telegraph offices, a money order postoffice with rural free delivery, a bank, prosperous commercial establishments, and an oil and fertilizer company doing a large business, while there are good schools and churches in the town and vicinity.\n\nOcilla Oil & Fertilizer Company, manufacturers of cotton-seed oil products and fertilizers, Ocilla, Irwin county, represents one of the important enterprises which has been fostered through the development of the cotton-seed industry throughout the South. The company was organized and incorporated in 1903, with a cap ital stock of $30,000, and its well equipped plant has a capacity for the handling of forty tons of cotton seed every twenty-four hours, while in connection is maintained an extensive gin, with a capacity of 125 bales of cotton a day. The oil products of the concern are maintained at the maximum standard of purity and attractiveness and are sold throughout the Union, the business of the company having shown a constant tendency to expansion from the time of its inception. The plant utilizes 25,000 square feet of ground, and employment is given to a corps of forty men. The stock of the company is owned entirely by residents of Irwin county, the offi cers being as follows: J. A. J. Henderson, president; J. E. Howell, vice-president; R. V. Paulk, secretary and treasurer. In addi-\n\n20\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\ntion to this executive corps the board of directors also includes William Henderson, D. H. Paulk, J. W. Paulk, Jacob McMillan, and J. L. Paulk.\n\nOconee, an incorporated town in the southwestern part of Wash ington county, is on the main line of the Central of Georgia rail road, a short distance east of the Oconee river. It has a money order postoffice, express and telegraph offices, some mercantile and shipping interests, school and church privileges, etc.\n\nOconee County was laid out from Clarke and was named for the Oconee river, which forms its eastern boundary. It lies in the eastern part of the state and is bounded by Clarke county on the northeast, Oglethorpe on the east, Greene on the south, Mor gan and Walton on the southwest, and Walton and Jackson on the northwest. The Oconee and Appalachee rivers, with their branches, water the county. The surface is hilly. The soil is productive and raises good crops of corn, wheat, oats, barley, sweet and Irish potatoes, cotton, ground and field peas, sugar-cane, vege tables, berries and melons. Peaches and apples yield abundantly and large quantities of fruits and vegetables are exported. Along the streams are growths of sycamore, poplar, maple, ash and gum. In other parts of the county grow oak, hickory, chestnut and wal nut. There is also some pine, but the output of lumber is insig nificant. There are a number of factories along the Oconee and Appalachee rivers, but the water-power is greatly in excess of what is used.. The minerals are mica, feldspar, hornblende and gneiss. Watkinsville is the county seat. It is on the Macon & Athens branch of the Central of Georgia Railroad. A division of the Seaboard Air Line traverses the northern part of the county. The population in 1900 was' 8,602, showing a gain in 889 in ten years.\n\nOconee River. This river rises in Hall county and flows a gen eral southeasterly direction until it unites with the Ocmulgee to form the Altamaha. In November, 1864, as Howard's wing of Sherman's army advanced to this river at Ball's Ferry, Gen. H. C. Wayne, commanding the cadets of the Georgia military institute and part of the reserves, fell back across the river. On the 23rd, Austin, with the cadets, successfully held the Central railroad bridge, while Hartridge at the ferry drove back across the river a Federal detachment which had forced its way over. This gave time for the removal of the stores at Tennille. On the next day General Wayne reported to General McLaws that the Federals were shelling him at Oconee Bridge. Wayne with the state troops\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\n21\n\nand cadets kept up a brave fight until night, holding one end of the bridge while the enemy set fire to the other. Finally, when flanking parties had crossed to his right and left, he withdrew his small force in good order.\n\nOconee War. Both the Creeks and Cherokees had extended aid to Great Britain during the Revolutionary war, but by the triumph of American arms they met the fate of the vanquished and were left to the mercies of the victors. The State of Georgia took ad vantage of the situation and in dictating terms of peace made at Augusta in 1783 obtained important cessions of land. The Chero kees, being comparatively weak, without adequate leadership and not inclined to hostility, accepted the exigencies of the occasion, but the Creeks were not so disposed. By the treaty they had lost all their possessions east of the Oconee river, and as the agree ment had been signed by only a portion of their head men a power ful faction, under the leadership of the redoubtable McGillivray, refused to acquiesce in it. The dissatisfaction of this party in creased when the legislature, in February, 1784, passed an act throwing open to settlement the newly acquired territory.\n\nConditions were aggravated by the dispute between the United States and Spain over the territory lying between the Chattahoochee and Mississippi rivers. Spain claimed sovereignty over the region on the ground of having taken the Province of West Flor ida from Great Britain while the Revolution was in progress and as she was at that time a powerful nation the United States was inclined to settle the question by diplomacy, rather than by an appeal to arms. Early in 1784 McGillivray went to Pensacola, where he formed a treaty of \"alliance and friendship\" with the Spanish authorities. Aided and abetted by the emissaries of Spain the Creeks kept up for several years, in that irregular, desultory manner so common to Indian warfare, a series of depredations on the white settlements along the Georgia frontier. Various at tempts were made to restore peace and good feeling, but every new treaty was broken soon after it was concluded. Notwithstanding the continuance of hostilities the whites kept pouring into the Oconee country. Every neighborhood had its fort, or blockhouse, which frequently became the permanent abode of the women and children, while the men toiled in the forest or field with the trusty rifle always within easy reach.\n\nFor some time President Washington sought to restore peace by a settlement of the Spanish claims in a way that would break the alliance between them and the Creeks. Failing in this he deter-\n\n22\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nmined to appeal to the Indians themselves. In the spring of 1790 he sent Col. Marinus Willet on a confidential mission to the Creek nation, with the result that McGillivray and several other chiefs returned with Colonel Willet to New York, where a treaty was concluded on August 7th. By its stipulations the Creeks renounced their allegiance to Spain, accepted the Altamaha and Oconee rivers as the eastern boundary of their possessions, and placed them selves under the protection of the United States, while the govern ment agreed to restore to the tribe the Tallassee country, lying between the Altamaha and St. Mary's rivers, and to guarantee all the Creek domain against further ingressions on the part of the whites. But the treaty was not satisfactory to either the Indians or the people of Georgia. The Creeks had not received more than half of what they had been led to expect and the Georgians re sented the surrender of the Tallassee country. The abrupt ter mination of McGillivray's treaty with Spain threatened to embroil the United States .in serious complications with that nation and hostilities continued until the treaty of Coleraine in June, 1796. Taking its name from the territory in dispute, this intermittent struggle, that continued over a period of twelve years, is known as the \"Oconee War.\"\n\nO'Connor, Daniel P., is successfully established in the wholesale grocery trade in the city of Augusta, where he conducts business under the title of D. P. O'Connor & Co. He was born in the city which is now his home, April 19, 1865, is a son of John and Ellen (Hickey) O'Connor, both of whom were born in County Cork, Ireland, whence they came to America as young folks, the father in 1852 and the mother the following year, forming an acquaintance in Augusta, where their marriage was solemnized June 22, 1856. John O'Connor became a successful furniture dealer of Augusta, where he continued to reside until his death, which occurred on July 5, 1905, and he is survived by his widow, three sons and two daughters, all being resident of Augusta. Dan iel P. O'Connor secured his early education in the parochial schools of Augusta, and took a course in St. Patrick's commercial insti tute of that city. He left school at the age of fifteen years and se cured employment in a wholesale grocery establishment. For five\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\n23\n\nyears he was employed as salesman for the firm of O'Donnell & Burke, both members being now deceased, and he has continued to be identified with the wholesale grocery trade in Augusta since the age of fifteen years. In 1890 he engaged in business for him self, forming a partnership with William E. Jackson, under the firm name of Jackson & O'Connor. On Jan. 1, 1900, he purchased the interest of Mr. Jackson and has since continued the business individually, under the title of D. P. O'Connor & Co. In politics Mr. O'Conor is a stanch adherent of the Democratic party, and is a communicant of St. Patrick's Catholic church, as is also Mrs. O'Connor. He is affiliated with the Knights of Columbus, in which he is a deputy grand knight. On Jan. 28, 1888, Mr. O'Con nor was united in marriage to Miss Ann C. Faughnan, daughter of Miles Faughnan, of Augusta, and she died March 7, 1902, survived by three children, namely: Catherine E., born Jan. 15, 1889; Marie Anna, born July 27, 1893; and Miles J., born July 19, 1899. On Oct. 17, 1905, Mr. O'Connor wedded Miss Volo M. Benson, daughter of James A. Benson, of Washington, Wilkes county.\n\nO'Connor, Jeremiah J., one of the progressive business men and representative citizens of Augusta, was born in that city, Oct. 4, 1855, and is a son of Michael G. and Julia Agnes (Mullane) O'Con nor, both native of County Cork, Ireland, where their marriage was celebrated and whence they immigrated to the United States in 1850, locating in the city of Augusta, where the father died in 1858 and the mother in 1885, the subject of this review being the only surviving child. Mr. O'Connor attended the parochial and public schools of Augusta during his boyhood days, but early as sumed the practical responsibilities of life, and it has been his por tion to win independence and success through his individualefforts. When but eleven years of age he became a cash boy in a local dry-good establishment, and even prior to this, in the Civil-war period, he found employment in a local factory in which was manufactured ammunition for the Confederate government. In the dry-goods store of Gray & Turley, later Jas. W. Turley, which he entered as a cash boy, he rose through various grades of promotion to that of buyer and manager and that his services were appreciated is shown not less in this fact than in his continuing in the employ of the one firm for the long period of eighteen years. In 1885 he became a salesman in the shoe store of William Mulherin & Co., and two years later was admitted to partnership, the title of the firm being simultaneously changed to Mulherin, Rice & Co. The senior member of the firm, William Mulherin, died\n\n24\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nin 1893, and a few months later the surviving partners, Rice and O'Connor, formed a copartnership, under the title of the Rice & O'Connor Shoe Company, and they have three large and finely ap pointed stores in- Augusta, doing an extensive business in both the jobbing and retail departments of their flourishing and important enterprise. Mr. O'Connor is a stanch supporter of the cause of the Democratic party; is a member of the city council, in which he represents the third ward; and served three years as a member of the board of education prior to entering the municipal council. He and his wife are communicants of the Catholic church and he is affiliated with the Knights of Columbus and the Catholic Knights of America. On Sept. 8, 188?', Mr. O'Connor was united in mar riage to Miss Elizabeth I. Rice, daughter of Matthew Rice and a sister of his business associate, Patrick H. Rice. They have seven children: Matthew R., Arthur B., Thomas M., Marion A., Eliza beth R., Gerald A., and Joseph J.\n\nO'Connor, John J., is established in a very successful retail grocery business at 1289 Broad street, Augusta, in which city he was born, June 11, 1873, being a son of Patrick J. and Mary E. (Murray) O'Connor, the former of whom was born in county Mayo, Ireland, Jan. 10, 1842, and the latter in Augusta, Ga., in March, 1846. The father was for many years engaged in the grocery business in Augusta, and was for a number of years a mem ber of the city council. He served from 1888 to 1903 as sheriff of Richmond county and died on Christmas day of the latter year, having been one of Augusta's well known and highly honored citi zens. He was prominent in local politics, as a stanch supporter of the cause of the Democratic party, and was a communicant of the Catholic church, as is also his widow, who still resides in Au gusta. He is survived by two sons and three daughters, all of whom reside in Augusta, the subject of this sketch being the elder of the two sons. Thomas H. is engaged in business in his native city; Anna Catharine is the wife of James P. Armstrong, cashier of the Irish-American bank; and Mary Ellen and Margaret remain with their mother. John J. O'Connor completed his educational training at Spring Hill college, in Mobile, Ala., and thereafter served six years as deputy sheriff of Richmond county, during the regime of his father in the office of sheriff. He resigned this posi tion in 1899, and has since been engaged in the retail grocery trade, having a well stocked and well appointed establishment and en joying an excellent supporting patronage. He is a Democrat in his political allegiance and is a communicant of the Church of the\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\n25\n\nSacred Heart, one of the principal Catholic churches of Augusta. He is affiliated with the Knights of Columbus and the Ancient Order of Hibernians. On Aug. 5, 1898, Mr. O'Connor was united in marriage to Miss Mary Genevieve Daly, daughter of James and Mary (McAndrew) Daly, of Augusta. Mr. Daly is manager of the extensive department store of J. B. White & Company, of Augusta. Mr. and Mrs. O'Connor have five children, namely: Mary Eliza beth, M. Genevieve, Margaret V., Patrick J. and John J., Jr.\n\nOculus, a post-hamlet in the southwestern part of White county, is not far from the Hall county line. Lula is the most convenient railroad station.\n\nOdd Fellows. Oglethorpe Lodge, No. 1, Independent Order of Odd Fellows, was organized at Savannah in 1842. On Nov. 13, 1843, the Grand Lodge of the State of Georgia was constituted at Savannah by Albert Case, Deputy Grand Sire. The charter granted at that time was destroyed in 1845, by the burning of the lodge room occupied by Oglethorpe Lodge, in Washington Hall, Savannah, where the Grand Lodge maintained its headquarters, and a new charter was granted the following year. The sessions of the Grand Lodge were held in the city of Savannah until 1850, when the head quarters were removed to Macon. No session was held in 1864, owing to the fact that there was no money in the treasury to de fray the expenses of the meeting, the lack of funds having been caused by the heavy demands upon the resources of the order during the war. In 1869 the constitution was amended so that the sessions could be held at such places as the Grand Lodge might designate at a regular meeting. At the time the Grand Lodge was organized there were seven lodges in the state. The report for May, 1905, shows 285 lodges with a membership of 23,528. Many of the subordinate lodges own their places of meeting and the order is in a prosperous condition.\n\nOdell, a post-hamlet of Forsyth county, is about eight miles southwest of Gumming and not far from the Milton county line. The most convenient railroad station is Suwanee.\n\nOdessadale, a town in the western part of Meriwether county, is on the Seaboard Air Line railway, and in 1900 reported a popula tion of 139. It has a money order postoffice, with rural free deliv ery, an express office, some mercantile concerns, and is a shipping point for a rich agricultural district.\n\nOdomville, a village in the extreme western part of Emanuel county, is on the Wadley & Mount Vernon railroad, a short dis tance north of Adrain. It has a money order postoffice, an express\n\n26\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\noffice, some mercantile and shipping interests, and in 1900 had a\n\npopulation of 50.\n\nOdum, a village of Wayne county, is on the Macon & Brunswick\n\ndivision of the Southern railroad, ten miles west of Jesup. It has\n\na money order postoffice, with rural free delivery, express and\n\ntelegraph offices, and is a trading and shipping point for that part\n\nof the county.\n\n... ,,\n\nOelschig, August Carl, one of the lead-\n\n::: ^f^' ^ ^\n\ning florists of the city of Savannah, was\n\n:V;;j;hT;jj:;;jh:;Mfc :-:^\n\nborn in the kingdom of Saxony, Ger\n\nmany, Nov. 27, 1848, and was reared and\n\neducated in the fatherland, where he\n\ncontinued to reside until 1.874, when he\n\ncame to America, dependent upon his\n\nown resources for making his way in\n\nlife. On Long Island, N. Y., he learned\n\nthe florist's trade and business, becoming\n\nfamiliar with all details of the work. In\n\n1881 he came to Georgia and took up his\n\nresidence in Savannah, establishing a\n\nsmall greenhouse on Anderson street, and also engaging in the\n\nraising of roses on an extensive scale, for the -wholesale market.\n\nIn 1890 he established his present greenhouses, on Moore avenue,\n\naccessible to the center of the city by the Thunderbolt electric line,\n\nand his eldest son, Carl H., is now associated with him in business,\n\nunder the firm name of A. C. Oelschig & Son. With the aid of\n\nhis wife and son Mr. Oelschig has here built up one of the most\n\nextensive greenhouse plants purveying to the Savannah and whole\n\nsale trade in this section. The plant includes eleven greenhouses,\n\nwith 75,000 square feet of glass. The firm also make a specialty\n\nof raising rubber plants on a large scale, for the wholesale market,\n\nthe concern being undoubtedly the largest growers and shippers\n\nof rubber plants in the United States. Mr. Oelschig had but a lim\n\nited capital when he arrived in Savannah, and his pronounced\n\nsuccess stands in evidence of his energy, progressive ideas and bus\n\niness sagacity. He is the owner of one of the beautiful suburban\n\nhomes of Savannah, finding great pleasure in improving and beau\n\ntifying his property. He is a member of the Savannah chamber of\n\ncommerce, and is identified with the Knights of Pythias, the Ger\n\nman Friendly society, and the Gesangverein Frohsinn club. On\n\nApril 4, 1882, he was united in marriage to Miss Anna Elizabeth\n\nWagner, who was born in Hesse-Cassel, Germany, Feb. 21, 1853,\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nbeing a daughter of Johann Heinrich and Catherine (Schneider) Wagner.

Dr. Oertel is 'a clergyman of\n\nthe Protestant Episcopal church and is\n\nan artist of distinguished talent, his painting entitled \"Rock of Ages\" having given him a world wide reputation, reproductions of the same being now found in thousands of homes. He and his wife now reside in Vienna, Va. Dr. Theodore E. Oertel secured his more purely literary ed ucation chiefly in the schools of the Protestant Episcopal cathedral at Garden City, Long Island, N. Y., and he was graduated in the medical department of the George Washington university, at Wash ington, D. C., as a member of the class of 1893, duly receiving his degree of Doctor of Medicine. In 1893 he was engaged in post graduate work in the city of Chicago; in 1893-5 was pathologist in West Side German dispensary in New York city; and in 1896 he came to Georgia for the purpose of establishing a pathological department in the state hospital for the insane, at Milledgeville. He there remained as pathologist for nearly three years, at the ex piration of which, in the autumn of 1898, he located in Augusta, where he has since been actively engaged in the work of his profes sion, as a specialist in the lines noted, having built up a very large practice and one which brings to him patients from Georgia and ad joining states. Since 1898 he has held the chair of histology and bacteriology in the Medical College of Georgia, which is a depart ment of the state university. He is a member of the American medical association and the Medical Association of Georgia, as well as the Richmond county medical society, of which last mentioned he is an ex-president. In the state association he is chairman of the committee on tuberculosis; is the author of a valuable and author-\n\n28\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nitative textbook, entitled Medical Microscopy, published in 1902; and is a communicant of the Protestant Episcopal church, as is also Mrs. Oertel. On April 24, 1893, Doctor Oertel was united in marriage to Miss Marie Cecile Rollings, of Washington, D. C., and they have one son, Robb Church Oertel, born March 31, 1898.\n\nOfferman, a town in the northern part of Pierce county, reported a population of 500 in 1900. It is located at the junction of the Atlantic Coast Line and the Atlantic & Birmingham railways, the former connecting it with Savannah and the latter with Bruns wick, giving it ready access to the seacoast. It has a money order postoffice, with rural free delivery, express and telegraph offices, a large saw-mill, several good stores and the customary school and\n\nchurch accommodations. Ogeechee, a village of Screven county, is on the main line of the\n\nCentral of Georgia railroad, a few miles northwest of Dover. It has a money order postoffice. from which several free delivery routes supply mail to the rural districts, express and telegraph service, some mercantile and shipping interests, schools, churches, etc., and in 1900 reported a population of 73.\n\nOgeechee Canal. This is an artificial water-way between the Savannah and Ogeechee rivers. (See Canals). As Sherman drew his lines of investment about the city of Savannah in December, 1864, there was some skirmishing along this canal as the Confeder ate outposts were retired upon the main body of Hardee's forces.\n\nOgeechee Ferry. In the early spring of 1780 the Americans under Twiggs, Dooly, Clarke, Few and Jones were engaged in de fending the frontier against the depredations of McGirth's Tories and Indians. Toward the latter part of March Colonel Pickens, with part of his regiment from South Carolina, formed a junction with Twiggs and Captain Inman, and with their combined force, amounting to about 300 men, they marched down the Ogeechee river, hoping to surprise and perhaps capture McGirth. They found him in Liberty county, killed some of his men, took three or four prisoners, but McGirth, through the fleetness of his horse and his perfect knowledge of the country managed to escape. The British general at Savannah, hearing of the presence of the Amer icans on the Ogeechee, and supposing it to be only a small party, sent Captain Conklin, with 66 men, to disperse them. Conklin left Savannah at three o'clock on the morning of April 4th and reached Ogeechee Ferry about ten. Having been informed by some negroes as to the position of the Americans, he divided his men, intending to gain the right flank and attack from two sides simultaneously. Pick-\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\n29\n\nens and Twiggs could see the British as they were crossing the river and thus became aware of the design. They accordingly concealed the main body of their troops and sent Captain Inman, with twenty dragoons, to draw the enemy into close action where the whole force might be captured. Inman was too hasty in opening the engagement, which compelled the main body to expose themselves before the plan had an opportunity to succeed. Conklin was mor tally wounded early in the action, Lieutenant Roney was wounded, two British soldiers killed and seven wounded, and the rest scat tered through the surrounding swamps. The Americans then burned Governor Wright's barn to prevent 350 barrels of rice stored there from falling into the hands of the enemy who were then engaged in collecting supplies for the army at Savannah.\n\nOgeechee River. This stream rises in Greene county and flows in a southeasterly direction until it empties into Ossabaw sound, forming for the last few miles of its course the boundary between Chatham and Bryan counties.\n\nDuring the early days of December, 1864, as Sherman's army was advancing upon Savannah, the Seventeenth corps followed the course of the Ogeechee river, on the north side of the stream, while the Fifteenth in two columns was on the south side, the most southern column passing through Statesboro. In crossing the river at Jenk's Bridge, on December 7th, the northern column was re sisted by a small force of Confederates, which was finally forced to retire in the face of the superior strength of the enemy.\n\nOgeechee Road, Skirmish May 21, 1782. (See Baillou's Cause way).\n\nOglesby, a post-hamlet of Elbert county, is on the Seaboard Air Line railway, about five miles west of Elberton. It has a telegraph office, and express office, some mercantile concerns, and is a trading center for the adjacent district.\n\nOglethorpe, the county seat of Macon county, is located on the west side of the Flint river and a short distance from Montezuma. It has express and telegraph offices, a court house, valued at $20,000, several neat brick stores, a money order post-office with rural free delivery and a bank. There are also a system of public schools, an excellent high school where boys and girls are prepared for a collegiate course, and good church privileges for the citizens. The population of the town in 1900 was 545, and of the militia district 2,174.\n\nOglethorpe County was laid out in 1793 and a part was given to Greene in 1794. The boundaries were somewhat changed in 1799,\n\n30\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nwhen parts of Oglethorpe were given to Greene, and parts of Greene were added to Oglethorpe. A part was given to Madison in 1811 and'a portion taken from Clarke in 1813. Another portion was set off to Taliaferro in 1813 and still another part to Madison county in 1831. The county was named for James Edward Ogle thorpe, founder and first governor of Georgia. It lies a little north east of the center of the state and is bounded on the north by Mad ison county, on the northeast by Elbert, on the east by Wilkes, on the southeast by Wilkes and Taliaferro, on the south by Greene, and on the west by Clarke and Oconee. The Broad and Oconee rivers, with their tributaries, drain the land. There are valuable water-powers, especially at Watson's and Andrews shoals. The surface is hilly and the soils are the result of the decomposition of granite, slate, gneiss and hornblendic slates. The productions are principally cotton, sweet and Irish potatoes, field and ground peas and the cereals. The county is well adapted to the raising of forage crops. Dairy farming and the raising of cattle for the market are two important occupations. No section of the state produces finer fruits and melons, but none are exported. Oak, pine, hickoryr poplar, ash, birch, maple, gum, dogwood and cedar timbers are com mon, and about twenty sawmills are engaged in converting these timbers into lumber. The county has an abundance of trap rock for road material, and granite of unsurpassed quality is found. Gold is now being mined and two gold mills are in operation. Lexington is the county seat, and Smithonia is a manufacturing town. The population of the county in 1900 was 17,881, an increase of 930 since 1890. The Athens branch of the Georgia railroad crosses the county in the western part, and a short road known as the Smithonia, Danielsville & Carnesville connects with the Seaboard Air Line at Colbert. Lexington is connected with the Georgia railroad by a short line called the Lexington Terminal. This town has been the home of quite a number of Georgia's noted sons, among whom may be mentioned William H. Crawford, Thomas W. Cobb, Stephen Upson, George R. Gilmer and the Lumpkins.\n\nOglethorpe, James Edward, founder and first governor of Georgia, was born in London, England, June 1, 1689, and was of a noted fam ily. One of his ancestors was a member of the household of Charles II, and his father, General Oglethorpe, led the army of James II, against the Prince of Orange. James Edward was educated at the Corpus Christi college, Oxford, and upon leaving college entered the army, where he attained the rank of general. For thirty-two years he represented Hazlemere in Surrey in Parliament and it was\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA,\n\n31\n\nwhile serving on a committee to inquire into the condition of jails that he conceived the idea of aiding the honest debtor by trans planting him to a colony in America. The plan at once met with favor. Parliament voted $50,000, many private citizens contrib uted to its success and King George granted the lands between the Savannah and Altamaha rivers for the colony. After a year, in this country he returned to England and in 1734 sent over 150 new colonists, Salzburgers and Scotch Highlanders. In 1735 he fol lowed with 300 more, among whom were the Wesley brothers. Finding affairs in an unsettled condition he exerted all his energies to place the colony on a firmer basis by making friends with the Indians and providing protection against the encroachments of the Spanish in Florida. In 1743 he went to England to refute charges made against him by Lieutenant-Colonel Cooke. Although he was exonerated he did not return to the colony as his means were by this time quite exhausted. He was recognized as the gov ernor of Georgia, however, until the surrender of the charter of 1752. At the beginning of the Revolution General Oglethorpe was offered command of the British troops in America, but refused to accept it unless he should be allowed to conciliate the colonists. The place was then given to General Gage. His last years were spent at Cranham Hall, where he was known as a patron of liter ature and the arts. His own account of \"The St. Augustine Cam paign\" was published in 1742, and his \"New and Accurate Account of the Colonies of Georgia and South Carolina,\" with many of his letters, are to be found in the collections of the Georgia Historical Society. He died at Cranham Hall, July 1, 1785.\n\nOglethorpe University. A division of the interests of the Geor gia Educational Society led the trustees of the Midway seminary to tender that institution to the Hopewell Presbytery, which ac cepted it and appointed a committee to report on the advisability of elevating it to the rank of a college. That was in the spring of 1835. At the fall meeting of the Presbytery in the same year the committee recommended the establishment of a college. A board of twenty-four trustees was appointed, the name of Oglethorpe university adopted for the new institution, and Midway, Baldwin county, selected as the location. The university was chartered in the ensuing December and on Nov. 24, 1836, the organization was perfected by the election'of officers and a faculty. The corner stone was laid on the last day of March, 1837, though the main building had been commenced in the August before. The univer sity was opened in January, 1838, and the first class was graduated\n\n32\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nin the fall of 1839. For want of funds the exercises were suspended during the latter years of the Civil war. The financial difficulties continued until March, 1870, when the board decided to remove the school to Atlanta. The exercises were accordingly resumed in that city in October following, with Dr. David Willis as presi dent, but in 1872 the institution was closed altogether.\n\nOhoopee, a town in the eastern part of Toombs county, is on the Seaboard Air Line railway, five miles from Lyons. In 1900 the population was 205. It has a money order postoffice, express and telegraph offices, some good stores, and is a shipping point of con siderable importance.\n\nOkefmokee Swamp. This great bog is located in southeastern Georgia, in the counties of Charlton, Ware and Clinch. It is about forty-five miles long and has an average breadth of thirty-five miles. The Indian name of the swamp was Ecunfinocau, meaning \"Quiv ering Earth.\" According to their traditions one of the islands in it was inhabited by a peculiar tribe, the men of which were very warlike and the women exceedingly beautiful. Some hunters are said to have once penetrated so far into the swamp, in pursuit of game, that they lost their way and were in danger of perishing, when they were given food by some of the beautiful women of the strange island, and at the same time warned to depart to escape the cruelty of their husbands. These hunters claimed to have seen the homes of the tribe, but as they tried to approach the island it kept constantly receding before them as if enchanted. When they told their story to their own tribe some of the young warriors were in favor of invading and conquering the island, but it could never again be discovered. Several streams have their source in the Okefinokee swamp, while fish and game abound in the lakes and on the islands. One of the islands is known by the name of \"Billy's Island,\" as it was once the home of the celebrated Seminole chief, Billy Bowlegs. The soil is prodigiously fertile and there has been some suggestion of taking the muck and mixing it with the sandy and clay lands in the adjacent territory as a ferti lizer. On Oct. 29, 1889, an act was passed by the legislature, au thorizing the sale of the swamp to the Suwanee Canal Company, which was organized for the purpose of draining the swamp in order to get the valuable yellow pine and cypress timber that grows on the islands. The swamp was sold for about 26 cents an acre and the company attempted to open a canal to the St. Mary's river. The scheme proved to be impracticable as the sand filled the canal and the topography of the swamp is of such a character that\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nS3\n\nsufficient fall can not be obtained to insure a good current. The company next tried to construct a railroad across the swamp. By this means they were able to get a lot of the cypress timber into market, but the enterprise, like the canal, was finally abandoned as being too expensive to warrant completion. In 1897 the com pany was declared insolvent and its affairs were wound up by a receiver.\n\nOliver, one of the important towns of Screven county, is on the main line of the Central of Georgia railroad system, not far from the Effingham county line. The population in 1900 was 350. It has some mercantile and manufacturing establishments, a money order postoffice, from which radiate several free delivery routes, express and telegraph service, good schools and church privileges, and does considerable shipping.\n\nOliver, Francis McDonald, a leading attorney of Savannah, Ga., was born in Montgomery, Ala., April 11, 1872. He is the second child and oldest son of Joseph Samuel and Nannie (Roberts) Oliver, both of whom were born and reared near Georgetown, the county seat of Quitman county, Ga. His grandfather, James M. Oliver, was born in Twiggs county, Ga., but in early life, after his mar riage to Mary Ann Reddish, a native of Warrenton, Ga., removed to Quitman county. He was a soldier in the Confederate Army, enlisting as a private in Company F, Thirty-second Georgia regi ment, at Charleston, S. C., May 9, 1864, and continued in active service until the surrender of his brigade at Greensboro, N. C. on April 26, 1865. Shortly after the war he was elected sheriff of Quitman county and held this position continuously, for years. For four years he was tax-receiver of Quitman county, and for sixteen years, was clerk of the superior court of that county. Shortly before his death, on Jan. 13, 1903, he had just been elected clerk for the ninth consecutive term. Had he served the unexpired term, he would have completed a continuous service of eighteen years as clerk. Joseph Samuel Oliver was the second child, and oldest son of James M. Oliver. He was born May 20, 1849. On Jan, 9, 1868, he married Miss Nannie C. Roberts. The children of this marriage are, Annie B., wife of N. B. Bryan, of Kissimmee, Fla.; Mary Ola, wife of Rev. Jasper C. Massee, of Raleigh, N. C.; Edgar J., a practicing attorney in Savannah, Ga.; Ruby, now resid ing with her mother in Kissimmee; Thaddeus S., a student at the Georgia school of technology, and Francis McDonald.

His business was that\n\n3-III\n\n34\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nof a railroad contractor and builder. Among the railroads con structed by him, were the Toccoa & Elberton; a part of the Spartanburg & Asheville line ; a part of the Georgia Southern & Florida; The South Bound railroad, from Savannah, Ga., to Columbia, S. C, now a part of the Seaboard Air Line Ry.; The Carolina Midland, from Barnwell to Allandale, S. C., now a part of the Southern system; The Florida East Coast, from Daytona, to Rockledg'e, and the Carrabelle, Tallahassee & Georgia railroad. He repre sented Osceola county in the legislature for two consecutive terms. Francis McDonald Oliver received his early education in the public schools of Georgia and Florida, which was supplemented by a four years course in the Florida state college at Lake City, where he graduated in 1892 with the degree of Bachelor of Arts. In 1894 he entered Vanderbilt university at Nashville, Tenn., graduating from the law department in June, 1896 with the degree of LL. B. During his two years at Vanderbilt he did post graduate work in history and economics. While at the Florida state college, Mr. Oliver won the honor medals in language, history, .science, oratory and essay. At Vanderbilt he received the \"Founders Medal\" in oratory and the \"Debaters Medal.\" After his graduation from Vanderbilt, Mr. Oliver, on July 3, 1896, went to Savannah, Ga., where he began the practice of his profession, becoming in the office of Barrow & Osborne an associate of Ex-United States sena tor Pope Barrow, and solicitor-general W. W. Osborne. On Jan. 1, 1898, he formed a law partnership with Judge H. D. D. Twiggs, who had about that time removed to Savannah from Augusta. The firm name of Twiggs & Oliver was adopted and has so contin ued since that date. This is one of the most influential law firms in the city of Savannah. Mr. Oliver is a Democrat. In January, 1904 he was elected to the aldermanic board of his city, and has continuously served in that capacity since his initial election. He is a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, the Savannah lodge Knights of Pythias, The Savannah Yacht club, the Savannah Vol unteer Guards and is a consistent member of the First Baptist church.

It is on the Sea board Air Line railroad, in the Mineral Springs militia district, and in 1900 reported a population of 152. It has a money order postoffice, express and telegraph offices, some good stores, schools, churches, etc. Besides the railroad facilities the town is near enough to the Chattahoochee river to profit by the rates offered by the river traffic, which makes it a good shipping point for the products of the surrounding country.\n\nGmar, a post-hamlet of Wayne county, is about five.miles north of Screven, which is the, nearest railroad station.\n\nOmecron, a post-hamlet of Wilkinson county, is eight miles northeast of Allentown, which is the nearest railroad station.\n\n36\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nOmega, a village in the southern part of Worth county, is on the Fitzgerald & Thomasville division of the Atlantic & Birmingham railway, and not far from the Colquitt county line.

He was born\n\nin Cherokee county, April 26, 1844, and was there reared and educated. He is a son of Capt. John B. and Nancy (Blythe) O'Neill, the former born in South Caro lina and the latter in Cherokee county, Ga. Capt. John B. O'Neill enlisted in the Confederate ranks at the beginning of the Civil war as captain of Company A, Eighteenth regiment, Georgia Volun teers, and was wounded in the second battle of Manassas. The injury was so severe that he was never afterward able for field service, and passed the remainder of his life in Cobb county, where his wife also died. The family was also represented in the war of the Revolution. James J. O'Neill was seventeen years of age at the time of the outbreak of the war between the states. He en tered the military service of the state of Georgia in 1861, as ser geant in Company A, First regiment, Fourth Georgia brigade. After being in rendezvous two months the command went to Vir ginia and entered the Confederate service, being numbered as the Eighteenth Georgia infantry. This was the Georgia regiment that was brigaded with three Texas regiments to form what was known as Hood's Texas Brigade, famous for its reckless daring in battle. Sergeant O'Neill shared fully in the service of this brigade at the battles of West Point, Seven Pines, Seven Days' battle before Richmond, Mechanicsville, Cold Harbor, White Oak Swamp, Malvern Hill, Kelly's Ford and Thoroughfare Gap. In the second battle of Manassas he captured the flag of the Twenty-fourth New York regiment. In this engagement his father, Capt. J. B. O'Neill, was seriously wounded and was furloughed to his home, carrying the captured flag with him. He gave the flag to private Northcutt, of his company, to convey the same to a member of the\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\n37\n\nlegislature and through the latter to the governor of the state at Milledgeville, and by some means Northcutt was given credit for the capture of the flag, as is shown in the reports of Forty-second Georgia records. Following closely on Manassas were the battles of South Mountain and Sharpsburg, Md., in which Sergeant O'Neill participated, and later he took part in the battles of Fredericksburg, the Wilderness, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, after which he was transferred to the Western Army as a private in the Sixth Georgia cavalry, and was under command of Gen. Joe Wheeler. Private O'Neill took part in the battles of Chickamauga, Sweetwater, Philadelphia, London and Dandridge, at which last men tioned place he was promoted to first sergeant. He was also in the siege of Knoxville and the engagements at Bean's Station and Mossy Creek (Now Jefferson City), at which last point he was seriously wounded, Dec. 29, 1863. He was thereafter in hospital until sent home on a furlough. On recuperating he joined his reg iment at Resaca and took part in the engagement at that place as first sergeant in command of his company. In the battle of New Hope Church he was promoted to second lieutenant, in which rank he was often in command of his company. He took part in the bat tles of Jones' Farm, McAfee's Cross Roads, Latimer's Mill, Kenesaw Mountain, and the engagement near Smyrna, was in all of the battles around Atlanta and assisted in the capture of Stoneman and his command, as well as the driving of Cook and Garrard across the Chattahoochee river. He rode with Wheeler and his men on the famous raid through northern Georgia and Tennessee, fighting and skirmishing day and night. While crossing the Cum berland mountains he was captured by the notorious bushwacker, Blackburn, but escaped by taking desperate chances, and rejoined his regiment. Returning in time to see the destruction of Atlanta, he assisted in fighting Sherman's cavalry night and day, on the famous march to the sea, and after the fall of Savannah took part in the operations in the Carolinas, including the battle of Aiken, where his horse was shot under him, and also the battle of Bentonville. He surrendered near Greensboro, N. C, under the capitu lation of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, April 26, 1865. After the close of his gallant and faithful military career Captain O'Neill located in Marietta, where for some time he was employed as a clerk in a mercantile establishment and where, in 1865, he was united in mar riage to Miss Mary A. Cook. He finally engaged in the lumber and milling business, with which he has ever since been identified. In 1881 he established himself in this line of enterprise in Rome,\n\n38\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nbeginning operations on a small scale and from this modest incep tion evolving the fine industrial enterprise controlled by the O'Neill Manufacturing Company, of which he is president, and his son, James H., vice-president. The plant of the company is the largest in the northern part of the state and there are only two larger in the entire state. Employment is given to an average of 100 workmen, and the output includes general planing-mill work, sash, doors, blinds, etc. The products are sold principally in Vir ginia, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky and other states further to the north, and the company has four lumber yards in West Virginia, handling all kinds of stock from the headquarters, in addition to the man ufactured products. Captain O'Neill is arrayed as a stanch sup porter of the Democratic party, though never a seeker of office, and is identified with the United Confederate Veterans. Captain and Mrs. O'Neill became the parents of three children, Leni L., James H. and Louise, all of whom are living.\n\nOnida, a post-village of Liberty county, is about fifteen miles northwest of Hinesville and not far from the Cannouchee river.

Omaha is the nearest railroad station.\n\nOrme, Aquilla Johns, is one of the rep resentative attorneys of the younger gen eration in the city of Atlanta, and in the capital city his success in his chosen pro fession has been of no secondary order. He was born in Atlanta, April 30, 1874, a son of Aquilla Johns Orme, Sr., born in Dauphin, Pa., Jan. 23, 1838, and Kate (Harman) Orme, born in Forsyth, Ga., Feb. 19, 1850. The father enlisted in 1861 as a soldier in the Confederate ser vice, becoming quartermaster's guard in the First Georgia infantry, and took part in all the engagements in which the regiment was involved. He was one of the number lost on the Laurel Hill retreat, when he went six days without food. His father, Archibald Orme, was a soldier in the war of 1812, and in the ancestral line two representa tives, Col. Archibald Orme and Col. Richard McAllister, were gal lant officers in the Continental forces in the war of the Revolution. The subject of this sketch is a descendant also of Ninan Beall, who served in the earlier colonial wars. Rev. John Orme, D. V. M., was the original American progenitor. He was born in England, in 1691, and came to America in 1720, in answer to an appeal made by the Presbyterians of America to the Presbyterian synod of England, and continued in the work of the ministry until his death. In the maternal line Mr. Orme is a grandson of Zachariah Edward\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\n41\n\nand Apsyllah Anne Harman, the former of whom was an able\n\nlawyer, and a great-grandson of Zachariah Harman, who served\n\nin the war of 1812. He is also a descendant of Capt. John Holmes,\n\nCapt. William Bentley and John Milner, each of whom was an\n\nAmerican officer in the war of the Revolution, and of John Milner,\n\nwho served in the colonial wars. Mr. Orme secured his earlier ed\n\nucational training in the public schools of Atlanta and thereafter\n\ngraduated at the Virginia military institute, Lexington, Va., in\n\n1893. He then took up the study of law under able preceptorship\n\nand was admitted to the bar of his native state in 1894, since which\n\ntime he has been engaged in the practice of his profession in Atlan\n\nta. In 1903 he was appointed by Gov. Jos. M. Terrell to the posi\n\ntion of solicitor of the criminal court of Atlanta. He is a member\n\nof the Georgia bar association, the Masonic fraternity, the Inde\n\npendent Order of Odd Fellows, the Knights of Pythias, the Im\n\nproved Order of Red Men, the Capital City club and the Piedmont\n\nDriving club, enjoying distinctive popularity in the business and\n\nsocial circles of the fair city of his birth. He has never deviated\n\nfrom, the path of close allegiance to the Democratic party, is a\n\nzealous member of the First Baptist church, and a member also of\n\nits committee on finance. On April 6, 1899, Mr. Orme was united\n\nin marriage to Miss Callie Cobb Jackson, daughter of Henry and\n\nSally (Cobb) Jackson, of Athens, Ga., and they have three children,\n\nAquilla Johns, Jr., born March 22, 1900; Sarah Cobb, born Aug.\n\n20, 1902; and Callie Jackson, born Jan. 13, 1905.\n\nOrr, a post-hamlet of Gilmer county, is almost on the Pickens\n\ncounty line, and is four miles east of Keasley, which is the nearest\n\nrailroad station.\n\nOrr, Gustavus John, was born at Orr-\n\n,::;;llllllillls::,\n\nville, Anderson county, then designated\n\n;i^^fm^9im.\n\nas district, S. C, Aug. 9, 1819. His\n\nfather, James Orr, was born in Mecklen\n\nburg county, N. C., Sept. 26, 1774, and\n\nhis mother, Anne (Anderson) Orr, was\n\nborn in Anderson county, S. C., Aug. 20,\n\n1792. His mother's father, James An\n\nderson, a Virginian by birth, was a pa\n\ntriot captain during the war of the Revo\n\nlution, at the close of which he settled\n\nin what was then known as Pendle-\n\nton district, S. C., afterward named An\n\nderson district, in honor of his elder brother, Gen. Robert Ander-\n\n42\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nson. James Orr, father of the subject of this memoir, was of Scotch-Irish descent, and was reared to maturity in North Caro lina. From that state he removed to South Carolina, giving his name to the locality where Gustavus J. was born, and later in life removed to Jackson county, Ga., where his son grew to manhood. The latter was educated in the University of Georgia, then known as Franklin college, and in Emory college, at Oxford, in which lat ter institution he was graduated in 1844. While at Athens as a student in the university he had as college mates Thomas R. R. Cobb, Samuel Hall, Joseph Le Conte, W. H. Felton, Linton Steph ens, J. L. M. Curry and Benjamin H. Hill. The last named was his classmate and both were members of the Demosthenean society. Young Orr stood first in his class, and in debate ranked next to Mr. Hill. At Emory college his most intimate associate was L. Q. C. Lamar. He chose law as his profession but soon after graduation was chosen assistant in the preparatory department of, and tutor in Emory college, and held these positions for a time. Later he began the study of law, in the office of B. H. Overby, of Jefferson, Ga. Circumstances caused him to resume teaching, and he was. thus engaged first at Jefferson, and later at Covington. Being offered the chair of mathematics in Emory college, he at first declined it, with a view of forming a law partnership with Judge John J. Floyd, of Covington, but, being persistently urged, he at last ac cepted and from January, 1849, until 1867 he filled this position, with credit to himself and profit to his pupils. In 1867 he accepted the presidency of the Southern Masonic female college at Covington, and in 1870 became professor of mathematics in Oglethorpe college, at Atlanta. In 1859, while a professor at Emory college, he was appointed, by Gov. Joseph E. Brown, a commissioner on the part of Georgia to run the boundary line between Georgia and Flor ida, the same having never been satisfactorily determined. When, through a decision of the supreme court of the United States and a concurrent act of the legislatures of each state involved, nothing was left to be done except to make an accurate and scientific sur vey, Mr. Orr, on the part of Georgia, and B. F. Whitner, in behalf of Florida, made this survey, in the winter of 1859-60. The two legislatures had decided that if the two surveyors should come within one-fourth of a mile of Ellicott's Mound, the line thus sur veyed should be accepted. In fact the surveyors missed this ob jective point by only twenty-four feet, in a line one hundred and fifty-eight miles in length. The line thus surveyed is to-day the boundary line between Georgia and Florida. On Jan. 15, 1872,\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\n43\n\nGov. James M. Smith sent together to the senate the names of Gustavus J. Orr to be state school commissioner and Hiram War ner to be chief justice of the supreme court. Both were unanimous ly confirmed. These were the first appointments under a Demo cratic administration after the days of reconstruction. Mr. Orr was thereafter reappointed, by the advice and consent of the senate, six times in succession and by five governors, namely: James M. Smith, Alfred H. Colquitt, Alexander H. Stephens, Henry D. McDaniel, and John B. Gordon. In none of these instances was there any opposing candidate, and his incumbency of the office termi nated only with his death. Doctor Orr was as truly the father of public education in Georgia as was Horace Mann the father of the public-school system of Massachusetts. The first school law, en acted in 1870, was modeled upon a report made by him as chairman of a committee of the Georgia Teachers' association, in 1869, and in 1873, at the request of Judge William M. Reese, then a senator, he drafted the general school law of that year. Thereafter he framed almost every important act relating to the common schools. Not only was his influence thus felt in affirmative legislation, but he also had to stand constantly on the defensive to protect and foster the interests which lay so close to his heart. At every ses sion of the general assembly open or covert assaults were made on the school system and bills were offered to abolish it outright or else to accomplish that end under.the guise of bettering the law. These had to be met and defeated, and his efforts along this line were constant and indefatigable. The difficulties of his work, especially at the outset, are hard to realize. In the first place, an effort had been made, under the first school law, to put public schools in operation with no funds in sight, and this had resulted in a school debt which was hard to manage. Many of the people were opposed to public schools because they thought them a \"Yankee\" institution; many of the religious people because they thought them \"Godless schools;\" and many more because the negro must have schools as well as the white. In combating op position and awakening favorable sentiment Doctor Orr wrote thousands of letters, issued many official circulars, published numer ous articles in the newspapers of the state, and delivered hundreds of addresses all over Georgia. His annual reports contained many recommendations which were acted upon only after his death and some of which, especially the matter of local taxation for rural schools, are only now being accepted by the people of the state. In addition to all the ordinary duties of his office he was in control\n\n44\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nin this state of the Peabody fund, being the trusted representative first of Doctor Sears and afterward of Doctor Curry. This fund was wisely administered, largely in free scholarships for the educa tion of teachers and in normal institutes in different parts of the state, under his general personal supervision. Doctor Orr was widely known among the educators of the United States. While he impressed Sir George Campbell, member of parliament, (\"White and Black in the United States,\" page 373), as a \"thorough old southerner\" and as being \"extremely reasonable for an out-and-out southern man,\" he was listened to with the highest respect by northern educational audiences everywhere and on a number of occasions by committees of the United States senate and house of representatives. He was gifted in presenting his own views when these were antagonistic to those entertained by his audience. In the year 1880 he delivered, from the standpoint of the south, an ad dress on \"The Negro,\" at Chautauqua, N. Y., before the National Educational association, more, perhaps, than nine-tenths of whose members were from the north and west- Immediately thereafter, without being a candidate therefor, he was elected vice-president of that body for the ensuing year, and at the succeeding session received the unsolicited honor of the presidency of the association. Evans, in his valuable History of Georgia, speaks of him, as \"an able man, possessing great learning, energy and ability,\" and of his being \"called the father of common schools in Georgia.\" In Avery's History of Georgia, after mentioning his first appointment, the following occurs: \"This was a most admirable selection. A gentleman of erudition, energy, sleepless zeal, crystal purity and integrity, and fine organizing capacity, Mr. Orr has, in the nine years of his continuous incumbency, seen the public-school system flourish and grow under his able direction until its former unpop ularity has been wholly changed and its sterling benefits are every where admitted.\" Nearly four, years after his death, Hon. Andrew S. Draper, superintendent of public instruction of the state of New York, in an address before the Georgia State Teachers' association, delivered at Brunswick, said: \"With some opportunities for spec ial knowledge of the subject, I can not hesitate a moment in saying that the statute books of your state contain a system of school laws, a scheme for the organization and management of the state school system, more comprehensive and judicious, more wise and statesmanlike than is to be found in most states of the Union. If I were asked to name one in which, taking all things together, there were better provisions for securing an efficient state, city and coun-\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\n45\n\nty supervision, for regulating the admissions to the teaching ser vice, for selecting trustees and directors, and for directing all the innumerable details of public-school work, I should have the great est difficulty in doing so. I suspect that the educational interests of your people owe a debt of gratitude to the wisdom and expe rience, the discriminating mind and the honest and courageous purpose of Gustavus J. Orr, which was hardly appreciated in his life time but which, as the fruits of his work are gathered, will win for him the honor and esteem of many generations.\" As a thinker Doctor Orr was noted for the comprehensive view he obtained of any subject which engaged his attention. He seemed to think that he knew nothing of a matter unless his knowledge of it was ex haustive. As a writer and speaker his logic was, perhaps, equalled by the simple elegance of his diction. There was hardly ever any revision of an article once written by him, and an extempore speech when delivered by him could be stenographically reported and published without a single correction. Many details might be named to show the wise management and practical efficiency of his administration, but only one will be here mentioned. During the sixteen years of his incumbency, such was the honesty and economy of his official life and so well was the small school fund of that early day husbanded, that ninety-five per cent, of all money raised reached the teachers, only five per cent, going to all ex penses of administration, state and county. His Christian character was without a blot and his faith in Jesus Christ was that of a little child. Doctor Orr was married on Dec. 30, 1847, to Miss Eliza Caroline Anderson, daughter of Dr. William and Mary D. (Hunter) Anderson, of Orrville, Anderson county, S. C. Following is a brief record concerning their children: William Anderson Orr died in infancy; Judge Edgar H. Orr is a resident of Atlanta; Alice Gertrude died in infancy; Mary Eliza died in Atlanta, Dec. 21, 1900; Anna Gustavia died in infancy, Rev. Gustavus John Orr is principal of the Massey school in Savannah; Mrs. Jessie Olivia Bass resides in Atlanta; Cornelia Agries is a teacher in the public schools of Atlanta; and Angus Elgin is in the railway mail service and resides in Atlanta. Doctor Orr was an active and consistent member of the Methodist Episcopal church South, with which he united in early manhood and in which he continued until his death, which occurred on Dec. 11, 1887.\n\nOrus, a post-hamlet of Colquitt county, is on the Georgia North ern railroad, seven miles northwest of Moultrie. It is also known as Schlev Station.\n\n46\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nOsborn, a post-hamlet of Towns county, is on the headwaters of the Hiawassee river, about six miles southeast of the town of Hiawassee. The nearest railroad station is Clayton.\n\nOsborne, Lyiran S., M. D., one of the leading physicians and surgeons of Irwin county, engaged in the active prac tice of his profession at Fitzgerald, and one of the highly esteemed citizens of that thriving and attractive little city, was born in the city of Janesville, Wis., Jan. 11, 1855. He is a son of William F. and Helen (Shedd) Osborne, both of whom were born in Genesee county, N. Y., in the year 1833, and are now resi dents of the state of California. The father served three years in the Union army during the Civil war, having been a member of Company I, Eighth New York heavy artillery. His great-grandfather, Roswell Osborne, was a soldier in the Continental line during the Revo lution and also served in the.war of 1812 Doctor Osborne secured his preliminary educational discipline in the public schools of Gen esee county, N. Y., after which he became a student in the State normal and training school at Brockport, N. Y. His professional training was received in the medical department of the celebrated University of Michigan, at Ann Arbor, where he was graduated as a member of the class of 1878. receiving the degree of Doctor of Medicine. In the following year he located in Waverly, la., where he was engaged in practice one year, at the expiration of which he removed to Big Stone City, Dakota, where he continued in prac tice until 1884. He then engaged in the work of his profession at Kansas City, Mo., remaining there until 1890, when he returned to Waverly, which represented his home and field of endeavor until the autumn of 1897, when he came to Georgia and located in Fitz gerald, where he has since resided and where he controls a large and representative practice. He has made various removals on account of weakness of the lungs, but has found the climate of Georgia most excellent in its effect upon him. He is a member of the Medical Association of Georgia and of the American medical association; is a Republican in his political views; and fraternally is identified with the Ancient Order of United Workmen and the Knights of the Maccabees. Both he and his wife hold membership in the Congregational church. For the past five years he has been\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\n47\n\na valued member of the board of education of Fitzgerald, being secretary of the same at the present time (1905) and having served one year as its president. He has taken a very deep interest in local educational affairs and has done much to improve the schools of Fitzgerald. At his suggestion the schools were entirely reorga nized and a thorough business course has been added to the cur riculum, the schools of Fitzgerald being now recognized as among the best in the state. Dr. Osborn has been a member of the board of pension examiners of Irwin county since 1899, having been appointed by President McKinley. While resident of- South Dako ta he also served three years in this capacity. He is the owner of one of the finest homes in this section of the state and is one of the loyal and public-spirited citizens of his city. On Sept. 24, 1884, he was united in marriage to Miss Laura Smilie, daughter of Francis and Mary (Perry) Smilie, both of whom were born in Ver mont and are now deceased. Ancestors on both sides were soldiers of the colonial army during the war of the Revolution. Dr. and Mrs. Osborne have three children, William Farrand, Helen M.\n\nand Esther L. Osborne, Henry, chief justice of Georgia from March, 1787,\n\nto January, 1789, succeeded John Houston in that office. After the constitution of 1789 went into effect he was the first judge of the superior court in the Western circuit. Sometimes he presided with George Walton at Savannah, and sometimes he sat alone in the Eastern circuit. The old court records show that he remained on the bench until 1791, after which all trace of him appears to have\n\nbeen lost. Oscarville, a post-village of Forsyth county, with a population\n\nof 63, is twelve miles northeast of Cumming and not far from the Chattahoochee river. Flowery Branch is the most convenient rail\n\nroad station. Osgood, a post-village of Berrien county, is on the Georgia\n\nSouthern & Florida railroad, six miles north of Sparks. It is a trad ing center and shipping point for that part of the county, and in 1900 had a population of 46.\n\nOsierfield, a post-hamlet of Irwin county, is a station on the At lantic & Birmingham railroad, about ten miles east of Fitzgerald.\n\nO'Steen, Levi, judge of the city court.of Douglas, Coffee county, is an able jurist and lawyer, and a man who has won success and prestige through his own efforts. He was born in the town of Clinch, Clinch county, Ga., Sept. 1, 1870, a son of Benjamin and Mildred O'Steen, the former born in Waycross, Ware county, this\n\n48\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nstate, in 1849, and the latter in Coffee county, in 1851. The paternal grandfather of Judge O'Steen was Capt. John Riley O'Steen, who went forth in the service of the Confederacy upon the outbreak of\n\nthe Civil war, as captain of Company G, Fiftieth Georgia volunteer infantry, in which he served with distinction until his death, in September, 1862. He was killed in the battle of Boonsboro, Mary land. Judge Levi O'Steen was afforded the advantages of the common schools in his boyhood days, but depended upon his own resources in broadening out his education to symmetrical proportions. He completed a course of study in Jasper normal institute, at Jasper, Fla., and thereafter devoted four years to successful pedagogic work, teaching in the public schools of Florida and Georgia. He then took up the reading of law, in the office of Quincy & McDonald, of Douglas, Ga., and was admitted to the bar of his native state in 1897, after which he was engaged in practice one year at Homerville, Clinch county. He then returned to Douglas, where he entered into a professional partnership with his former preceptors, with whom he was as sociated in practice until his appointment to the office of solicitor of the city court of Douglas, on June 6, 1899, this appointment having been conferred by Gov. Alien D. Candler. Judge O'Steen proved an able public prosecutor, and continued incumbent of the office noted until his appointment to preside on the bench of the same court, Aug. 31, 1903. He has exercised his judicial functions with much discrimination and wisdom, is an able and popular official and a representative member of the bar of Coffee county. For two years he was associated with M. A. Candler in the practice of his profession. He was the first man to experiment with peach culture in his section, and is now the largest individual grower of this fruit in Coffee county. Judge O'Steen is a stanch adherent of the Democratic party, and he and his wife are prominent mem bers of the local organization of the Methodist Episcopal church South, in which he is a steward. He is affiliated with the Inde pendent Order of Odd Fellows and the Knights of Pythias, in the local lodges of which he has passed the various official chairs. The Judge has not been denied a due reward for his earnest and honor able efforts, having gained both professional prestige and material\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\n49\n\nprosperity. He provided the means for his own education, and at the time of his marriage had practically no financial resources. To-day his capitalistic status is indicated, in a conservative way, by an estate valued at $15,000. He now resides on his beautiful farm of 490 acres, one mile from the city, having as a homestead a fine old colonial mansion. On Nov. 27, 1897, he was united in marriage to Miss Fannie Smith, daughter of Robert S. and Mary (Gaskin) Smith, of Coffee county, and of the five children four are living, namely: Herbert Quincy, Edith, Myrtie, and Alton Tilden, Mil dred, the third in order of birth, died in early childhood.\n\nOswald, a post-village of Telfair county, is on the Seaboard Air Line railway, five miles west of Helena. It has some mercantile\n\nconcerns and does some shipping. Ottley, John King, cashier of The\n\nFourth National bank of Atlanta, and known as one of the able financiers of\n\nthe state, was born in Columbus, Lowndes county, Miss., June 15, 1868. He is the son of John King Ottley who was\n\nborn in Princess Anne county, Va., in 1816, and Ellen Gertrude (Williams) Ottley, who was born in Washington, 111., in 1840. John McLaran, Mr. Ottley's great-grandfather in the maternal\n\nline, was a patriot soldier in the War of the Revolution. The father of the sub ject of this sketch was loyal to the cause of the Confederacy during the war between the states, but was physically incapacitated for service in the army. He passed the closing years of his life in Columbus, Miss., having been a merchant by vocation during the greater portion of his active business career. John K. Ottley com pleted his educational training in the Southwestern Presbyterian university at Clarksville, Tenn. He has been identified with the banking business during practically his entire business career. While yet a boy he held a clerical position in the Boatmen's bank of St. Louis, Mo., and subsequently became cashier of the Delta bank at Greenwood, Miss. In 1890 he removed to Atlanta where he became interested in the organization of the American Trust & Banking Company, and later in that of its successor, The Fourth National bank of Atlanta, in 1896. Of this bank he has been cashier from the time of its inception. The \"Southern Bank\", in its issue of January, 1905, says that Mr. Ottley \"has been with The\n\n4 III\n\n50\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nFourth National bank since its organization, discharging the deli cate, responsible and difficult duties of cashier so skillfully and so faithfully that to his efforts and ability is due, in large measure, the great success to which the bank has attained. Thoroughly capable, energetic and painstaking, with a firm grasp of. the details of his work and a breadth of view that enables him to administer the affairs most wisely, Mr. Ottley has wrought out a policy and a system that have made The Fourth National bank of Atlanta a conspicuous factor in the financial world and for himself an envia ble reputation. Largely through his efforts the business of the bank has grown from one showing resources of $975,594, in 1896 to nearly $5,000,000 in January, 1905, as shown by The Fourth Na tion bank's last statement to the comptroller. The Fourth Na tional bank is represented in the membership of the American bankers' association and the Georgia bankers association. Mr. Ottley is a member of the sinking fund commission of the city of Atlanta. On March 21, 1889, Mr. Ottley was married to Miss Passie Fenton McCabe, daughter of Dr. Fenton Mercer and Passie (Butler) McCabe of Columbus, Miss. They have two children, Passie May and John King, Jr. They belong to the Presbyterian denomination, Mr. Ottley being treasurer of the North Avenue Presbyterian church of Atlanta. Mr. Ottley belongs to the Cap ital City club and the Piedmont Driving club and is affiliated with the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. During the winter the family are at their town house, 537 Peachtree street, but spend the re mainder of the year at their delightful country place \"Joyeuse,\" a few miles out of Atlanta on the beautiful Peachtree road. Both these homes are centers-of the pleasantest social interest and many friends enjoy their cordial hospitality during the season. From early boyhood Mr. Ottley has been greatly interested in the own ing and breeding of live stock, being particularly fond of saddle horses. While he is kept exceedingly busy with his arduous duties as cashier of The Fourth National bank,, he yet finds some time to devote to his favorite recreation of riding and driving. \"Joy euse\" is famous for its horses and poultry. Mr. Ottley, being of Southern birth, is, as may be supposed a stanch Democrat. He is public spirited and very loyal to the interests of his city, being always ready to aid, in any way possible in the moral and national up-building of Atlanta.\n\nOtto, a post-village of Union county, is on a branch of the Notely river, three or four miles south of Blairsville. It is a trading cen-\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\n51\n\nter for the neighbrohood in which it is located and in 1900 reported\n\na population of 78. Otto, George F., has risen to promi\n\nnence and definite success as a contrac tor and builder in his native city of Sa vannah, where he was born, Dec. 28, 1868, a son of Frederick and Martha (Padgett) Otto, both of whom were likewise born and reared in Savannah, where the former passed his entire life, a boilermaker by trade and having died when his son George F., now the only living child, was but six years of age. The mother is still living and maintains her home in Savannah. Frederick Otto was a Confederate soldier during the Civil war, as a private in a Georgia regiment. George F. Otto attended the public schools of Savannah until he had attained the age of twelve years, when he assumed the active responsibilities of life, his first employment being as a general utility boy in the pressroom of the Savannah Morning News, with which concern he remained three years. At the age of sixteen years he entered upon an apprenticeship at the carpenter's trade, serving four years and thereafter engaging in the work of his trade, as a journeyman. Since 1891 he has been independently engaged in business as a contracting carpenter and has been very successful in his endeavors, having erected a num ber of the handsome private residences of Savannah. He is a stanch Democrat, and both he and his wife are members of the Methodist Episcopal church South. He is a member of the Sa vannah chamber of commerce; is affiliated with the Masonic fra ternity, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, the Knights of Pythias, and the Junior Order of United American Mechanics, in which last he holds a state office and is a member of Georgia Com pany, No. 1, Uniform Rank, Knights of Pythias, which has taken many prizes in competitive drills, both state and inter-state. On Jan. 20, 1892, Mr. Otto married Miss Georgia Olivia Floyd, daugh ter of Benjamin G. and Eva (Brannon) Floyd, of Savannah, and of their seven children all are living except Benjamin, who died in infancy. The names of the others are here entered in order of their birth: Lillian Inez, Georgia Lucille, Frederick Floyd, Eva May, Maud Ethel, and Christine Lois.\n\n52\n\nCYCLOPEDIA OF GEORGIA\n\nOusley, a town in the western part of Lowndes county, is on the Atlantic Coast Line railroad, and near the Little river. It has a money order postoffice, with rural free delivery, an express of fice, some good stores, schools and churches, and does considerable shipping, especially in cotton, lumber and naval stores.\n\nOusley, Robert P., a leading member of the bar of Lowndes county, being en gaged in the practice of his profession in Valdosta, has represented his county in the state legislature and is a member of one of the old and prominent families of Georgia. He was born at Ousley, Lown des county, Oct. 18, 1860, a son of Jo seph' A. and Angie R. (Rushin) Ousley, both natives of Georgia, the former born in Monroe county, Feb. 24, 1832, and the latter in Marion county, Aug. 22, 1832. The paternal great-grandfather of the subject of this review, was a soldier of the Continental line during the war of the Revolution, having enlisted from Virginia. After the war he settled in Greene county, Ga., and passed the remainder of his life in this state. Col. Joseph A. Ousley was a gallant and distinguished officer in the Confederate service during the Civil war, entering the army as second lieutenant in the Twelfth Georgia volunteer infantry, and having been promoted to captain and later to quartermaster, with the rank of colonel. He was a stanch Democrat and in the early '70s served as a rep resentative of Lowndes county in the lower house of the state legis lature. Several years later his party again nominated him for the same office, but he declined the honor. He and his wife both died at Valdosta, the latter in 1884. Robert F. Ousley secured his earlier educational training in the schools of Valdosta, later at tended Emory college at Oxford, and Auburn college in Alabama; studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1887.
