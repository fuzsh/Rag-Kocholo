The Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Prize in Literature

In 1997 Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn fulfilled a dream he had harbored ever since receiving the Nobel Prize – to establish a literature prize in Russia, one that, as he said, would “not overlook the worthy” authors, nor “reward the empty” ones.

The mission of the prize is to recognize Russian literature, in all its genres. Laureates can be prose writers, poets, playwrights, literary critics and scholars of literature. The prize has been expanded to incorporate contributions to the study of Russian culture, history and social thought. What unites all laureates is that their work must be in the Russian language and written in Russia at any time after the 1917 Revolution. In a small minority of cases, laureates have been recognized posthumously. A laureate cannot receive the award twice.

For over twenty-five years now, the announcement of the The Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Prize in Literature every March, and the award ceremony held shortly after Easter, have become important events in Russian literary life. While the prize has been awarded mainly to prose writers and poets, the list of recipients includes linguists, literary critics, directors and actors who have brought literature to the screen.

One of the distinguishing features of the prize is that it is the only one in Russia to be founded “for writers by a writer”. The $25,000 annual prize is funded from the proceeds of worldwide publications of The Gulag Archipelago.
