        "text": "Sergei Pavlovich Korolev in his apartment\n\nSeventh Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nNow the attitude towards the once most prestigious scientific prize named after Alfred Nobel is ambiguous. The last Nobel laureate from Russia, Dmitry Muratov, who received the Peace Prize, only confirmed the extreme politicization of the Stockholm office. Much earlier, in 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev received a similar medal for the collapse of the Soviet Union and the lost Cold War.\n\nRepeatedly distorted history of our Motherland, Alexander Solzhenitsyn received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1970 for his works. The official justification was as follows: “For the moral strength with which he followed the immutable traditions of Russian literature.”\n\nIt is impossible to say that the peace and literature prizes have any real value in the world. Now, as before, it is a tool for promoting the policies of Western countries and a factor of influence on society and government. If you want to ruin a good idea, in general, ask Brussels and Washington how best to implement it.\n\nNow the Nobel Prize is not what it used to be\n\nBut there is another, traditional side to the most prestigious award in the world. We are talking about purely scientific areas - chemistry, physiology and medicine, physics and, to a lesser extent, economics. Although the latter is called the Nobel Prize in Economics, Alfred himself has nothing to do with it. It appeared in 1969 and is called the “Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.” But let’s not get distracted and turn to the domestic laureates of the “correct” Nobel Prize.\n\nThe gigantic scientific and technological leap that the country made in the 2010th century could not but affect the global recognition of Russian and Soviet researchers. If we do not take into account the “pseudo-Russian” prize in physics of Novoselov and Geim in XNUMX, then we have one Nobel in chemistry, six in physics, two in physiology and medicine, as well as Leonid Kantorovich with a prize in economics .\n\nAt least two awards are missing. One in chemistry - from Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev and in physics - from Sergei Pavlovich Korolev. We covered the first story in the material “Where did Dmitry Mendeleev’s Nobel Prize go?”. The time has come to decide on the Sergei Korolev Prize.\n\nAnyone who is more or less versed in the history of science and technology understands that the launch of an artificial Earth satellite and the first man into space are worthy of a Nobel Prize. Most of the prizes in this area are given for fundamental scientific achievements, but the resonance from Gagarin’s flight was such that Korolev could hardly have been awarded the prize until the end of 1961. If everything had happened in the best way, Russia would now have seven Nobel medals in physics. However, this event could have happened a little earlier.\n\nProfessor Sergeev and team\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union tried to classify everything. In order for the enemy to be unable to understand anything at all, for example, the People's Commissariat tank industry in 1945 was renamed the People's Commissariat of Transport Engineering Industry, and a year later - the famous Ministry of Transport Engineering in narrow circles. There are plenty of such examples.\n\nThe appropriateness of this approach can be debated for a long time, but the fact remains that the Nobel Prize in Physics was not awarded to Sergei Korolev due to the regime of extreme secrecy. In 1957, a request came from the Nobel Committee proposing to nominate the chief designer of space technology for the award. It was clear from the tone of the letter that the Kremlin had only to submit a candidacy, and it would have been immediately approved in Stockholm. Nikita Khrushchev made a decision on this issue, and he snapped:\n\n“One person cannot be named; the creator of new technology in our country is the whole people.”\n\nThe official position of the Soviet leadership was the reluctance to reveal the identity of the head of the space issue in the country. Of course, the name of the hero should not have been known to his own people - the identity of Sergei Korolev was revealed only after his death. According to all documents, the designer appeared as “Professor K. Sergeev.”\n\nThe famous video chronicle of the negotiations between Korolev and Gagarin before launch into orbit has nothing to do with April 12, 1961. The material was filmed much later in Sergei Pavlovich’s apartment.\n\nAccording to open data, after Gagarin’s flight into space there were no repeated requests from Stockholm. Maybe they were offended by Khrushchev’s neglect, or maybe not. In the end, in 1962, Lev Landau single-handedly (which was a rarity) received the Nobel Medal in Physics “For his innovative theories of condensed matter, especially liquid helium.” This happened in the hospital after a terrible accident and the actual departure of a genius from big science.\n\nStockholm had no hypothetical resentment towards the Kremlin. A possible reason why the Nobel Committee did not propose to nominate the then-unnamed chief designer again was the secondary nature of launching a man into space. Yes, it was an outstanding achievement in world history and science, but the first object in space was still Sputnik 1. A new word has even appeared in foreign languages ​​in connection with this – Sputnik. From a scientific point of view, the launch of the first artificial satellite was more important than the launch of a person.\n\nFrankly speaking, even now people in space are more likely to perform ideological rather than scientific, technical and research functions. The Nobel Committee likes to give prizes for discoveries that either allow the creation of new research methods or provide a serious technological breakthrough. Sputnik 1 met both award criteria at once.\n\nIf you believe the memoirs of Khrushchev’s son, Sergei Korolev was very offended by the Secretary General. In the end, Nikita Sergeevich could nominate two or three people if he did not want to elevate the main one. Such precedents have already happened - in 1958, Pavel Cherenkov, Igor Tamm and Ilya Frank received a prize in physics for the discovery of the “Cherenkov effect”.\n\nThe secrecy of “Professor K. Sergeev” was absurd. As KGB chief Ivan Serov admitted, everyone understood that there was no need to keep the name of the chief secret. But the enemy’s resources were limited to a certain extent, and intelligence had to spend money on revealing “unclassified” secrets.\n\nThe version about the reluctance to quarrel with the rather effective team of chief designers of the Soviet space project deserves attention.\n\nSergei Korolev, as Chairman of the Council of Chief Designers, was not only an engineer, but also a talented organizer, whom modern “effective” managers should look up to.\n\nLet’s say everything turns out for the best, the Queen is declassified and awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in Stockholm. How will Mstislav Keldysh, a brilliant mathematician and one of the ideologists of the Soviet space program, look at this? Or Valentin Glushko, the country's chief rocket engine specialist? Glushko had a tense relationship with Korolev, and he liked to repeat that with his products any tin could be launched into space.\n\nIn his own way, he was right. There were many such leaders in the USSR space department - Nikolai Pilyugin (developer of control systems), Viktor Kuznetsov (gyros and stabilization systems), Mikhail Ryazansky (rocket radio systems) and others. The government tried not to forget everyone after the next technical masterpiece - there were Lenin Prizes, Heroes of Socialist Labor, and luxurious country dachas. And suddenly Sergei Korolev receives the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe version proposed above is not indisputable, but it offers a lot of food for thought.\n\nMaybe the Soviet Union didn't need another Nobel Prize in Physics?\n\nEvgeny Fedorov\n\nOur news channels\n\nSubscribe and stay up to date with the latest news and the most important events of the day.\n\n28 comments\n\n\"Right Sector\" (banned in Russia), \"Ukrainian Insurgent Army\" (UPA) (banned in Russia), ISIS (banned in Russia), \"Jabhat Fatah al-Sham\" formerly \"Jabhat al-Nusra\" (banned in Russia) , Taliban (banned in Russia), Al-Qaeda (banned in Russia), Anti-Corruption Foundation (banned in Russia), Navalny Headquarters (banned in Russia), Facebook (banned in Russia), Instagram (banned in Russia), Meta (banned in Russia), Misanthropic Division (banned in Russia), Azov (banned in Russia), Muslim Brotherhood (banned in Russia), Aum Shinrikyo (banned in Russia), AUE (banned in Russia), UNA-UNSO (banned in Russia), Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar people (banned in Russia), Legion “Freedom of Russia” (armed formation, recognized as terrorist in the Russian Federation and banned), Kirill Budanov (included on the Rosfinmonitoring list of terrorists and extremists), the International LGBT public movement and its structural divisions are recognized as extremist (decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dated November 30.11.2023, XNUMX)\n\n“Non-profit organizations, unregistered public associations or individuals performing the functions of a foreign agent,” as well as media outlets performing the functions of a foreign agent: “Medusa”; \"Voice of America\"; \"Realities\"; \"Present time\"; \"Radio Freedom\"; Ponomarev Lev; Ponomarev Ilya; Savitskaya; Markelov; Kamalyagin; Apakhonchich; Makarevich; Dud; Gordon; Zhdanov; Medvedev; Fedorov; Mikhail Kasyanov; Dmitry Muratov; \"Owl\"; \"Alliance of Doctors\"; \"RKK\" \"Levada Center\"; \"Memorial\"; \"Voice\"; \"Person and law\"; \"Rain\"; \"Mediazone\"; \"Deutsche Welle\"; QMS \"Caucasian Knot\"; \"Insider\"; \"New Newspaper\""
