        "text": "JEFFREY BROWN:\n\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn was first a prisoner in the Soviet Union's vast Gulag system and then a writer who exposed the horrors of that system to the world.\n\nHe was born into the first generation following the 1917 Russian revolution and served in the Red Army during World War II. But in 1945, he was arrested by Joseph Stalin's secret police. His crime: disparaging the Soviet dictator in a letter to a friend.\n\nIn 1962, during the short-lived liberalization under Nikita Khrushchev, Solzhenitsyn was permitted to publish \"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.\" The searing tale of the struggle to survive a winter day's imprisonment drew international acclaim.\n\nSolzhenitsyn would go on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970, but renewed scrutiny and then censorship from the soviet state. His most famous work, \"The Gulag Archipelago,\" part memoir, part history of the prison system in which millions of Russians lost their lives, was smuggled out of the Soviet Union on microfilm and first published in the West.\n\nOne of Solzhenitsyn's sons spoke today of his father's motivation in writing.\n\nSTEPAN SOLZHENITSYN, Son of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: The misery of people here and the lack of freedom under the Soviet regime, their impoverishment after the Soviet regime was always a source of great pain to him. That is why he opposed the Soviet regime.\n\nJEFFREY BROWN:\n\nSolzhenitsyn was charged with treason in 1974 and forced to leave his country. He lived in the United States for almost 20 years and continued to write about the Soviet Union, while also criticizing what he saw as the failings of the West.\n\nIn 1994, he received a hero's welcome upon return to his native land. It was there that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn died yesterday, outside Moscow, as his wife said he had wished: at home in the summer. He was 89 years old."
