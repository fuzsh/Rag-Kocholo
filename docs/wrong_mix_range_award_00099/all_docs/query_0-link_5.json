        "text": "By ANTHONY LEWIS\n\ntockholm, Dec. 10--The Nobel Prizes for 1970 were formally presented today, and along with the royalty and the rows of stiff shirts there was drama.\n\nIt was the drama of the absent figure: Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, the Soviet writer who won the prize for literature. He stayed away from the ceremony because he feared that if he left the Soviet Union he would not be allowed to return.\n\nSeven other 1970 laureates were in the Stockholm Concert Hall this afternoon, in white tie like the audience. Each heard a Swedish academician praise his work; then each received his gold medal and diploma from King Gustav VI Adolf.\n\nBut when it came time for the literature award, there was only the speech in praise of the winner. It was by Dr. Karl-Ragnar Gierow, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy.\n\nSpeaker Quotes From Pravda\n\n\"Solzhenitsyn is of the incomparable Russian tradition,\" Dr. Gierow said. \"The same background underlies the gigantic predecessors who have derived from Russia's suffering the compelling strength and inextinguishable love that permeates their work.\"\n\nWith irony, Dr. Gierow drew on Pravda for his one quotation from critical appraisal of Mr. Solzhenitsyn's work.\n\nThe quote was from a Pravda review of Mr. Solzhenitsyn's first novel, \"A Day in the Life of Ivan Denslovich,\" published in 1962, when Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev was leading the Soviet Union through a period of de-Stalinization. Mr. Khrushchev is said to have intervened to have assured publication of the novel, which tells of life in a prison camp during the Stalin period.\n\n\"Why is it that our heart contracts with pain as we read this remarkable story at the same time as we feel our spirit soar?\" the Pravda review said. \"The explanation lies in its profound humanity, in the quality of mankind even in the hour of degradation.\"\n\nSince then, a ban on publications criticizing Stalin's rule of terror has brought Mr. Solzhenitsyn under severe attack. Neither of his last two novels, \"Cancer Ward\" and \"The First Circle,\" has been published in the Soviet Union. But copies were spirited out of the country and published to critical praise abroad. Typewritten manuscripts of the novels have circulated widely in the Soviet Union in what is called the samizdat, or hand- to-hand press.\n\nLast year the author was expelled from the Soviet writers' union, and at the award of the Nobel Prize this October he was savaged in the Soviet press.\n\nAt first Mr. Solzhenitsyn said he would go to Stockholm to accept the prize in person. But then, two weeks ago, he wrote to the Swedish Academy saying that he would be unable to appear. He said:\n\n\"The hostile attitude toward my prize, as expressed in the press of my country and the fact that my books are still suppressed--for reading them, people are dismissed from work or expelled from school--compel me to assume that my trip to Stockholm will be used to cut me off from my native land, simply to prevent me from returning home.\"\n\nA Coda in English\n\nDr. Gierow, at the end of his prepared address in Swedish, delivered an unscheduled coda in English.\n\n\"The Swedish Academy regrets the reason why Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn has deemed it impossible to be with us today.\" He said \"in accordance with his own wish, the prize will be awarded at a place and a time to be agreed upon.\"\n\nLed by the King, the audience then stood and loudly applauded the man who was not there.\n\nIn any event, the authorities could not have arranged a more dramatic demonstration of Mr. Solzhenitsyn's hold on the creative imagination of the world than by discouraging him from going to the ceremony. This point was made in the closing speech by Prof. Arne Tiselius, the Nobel laureate in chemistry for 1948, who addressed the Nobel banquet in the City Hall.\n\n\"We sincerely regret that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn could not be with us tonight,\" Professor Tiselius said at the end of his speech. \"We appreciate, however, the motives which have prompted him not to attend. The homage just rendered is, if anything, reinforced by his absence.\"\n\nAnniversary of Nobel Death\n\nThe Nobel formalities, with the presentations in the afternoon followed by the dinner, always take place on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel in 1896. The Swedish munitions inventor and manufacturer left a fund for prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace.\n\nThe peace prize, which is awarded separately in Oslo by a five-member Nobel Committee appointed by the Norwegian Parliament, went this year to Dr. Norman E. Borlaug of the United States, for his research on improved grains. The other prize winners are chosen by the Swedish Academy, along with a Nobel Prize in Economics established in 1968 by the Central Bank of Sweden to honor Nobel. Each prize carries an award equivalent to $78,000.\n\nThose who were honored here today were as follows:\n\nIn physics, Prof. Louis Neel of the University of Grenoble and Prof. Hannes Alfven, a Swedish physicist now at the University of California in San Diego.\n\nIn chemistry, Prof. Luis Leloir, a French-born Argentine citizen who teaches at the Institute for Biochemical Research in Buenos Aires.\n\nIn medicine, three men shared the prize for research on nerve transmission: Dr. Julius Axelrod of the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md.; Prof. Ulf von Euler, of the Royal Caroline Institute in Stockholm, and Sir Bernard Katz, a German-born biophysicist who is a professor at University College, London.\n\nIn economics, Prof. Paul A. Samuelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Professor Samuelson was praised for doing more than any other contemporary economist \"to raise the level of scientific analysis in economic theory.\"\n\nAt the dinner, Professor Gierow read a message that he said had been received from Mr. Solzhenitsyn.\n\nThe writer said that he knew his \"involuntary absence\" would not \"darken the fullness of today's ceremony.\" He added that today was Human Rights Day and urged everyone participating in the ceremony to \"see in this a symbol.\""
