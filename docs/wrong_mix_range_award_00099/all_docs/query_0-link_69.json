        "text": "John Polanyi didn't believe it when a reporter telephoned one day in 1986 to tell him he had won the Nobel Prize in chemistry. \"I told him, `You're probably wrong.\"'\n\nBut as soon as he put the phone down, it rang again - and again and again. As the truth began to sink in, Polanyi's wife, Sue, went outside to tell the limo driver standing by to take them to the airport that they couldn't go after all: her husband had just won the Nobel Prize.\"Let's just say the driver was somewhat skeptical,\" Polanyi recalls.\n\nThe reaction was typical. The Nobel Prize is the award of awards, the biggest, most prestigious honor that any scientist, writer or statesman can receive. Nobel laureates become instant celebrities, courted by universities and corporations, sought after as public speakers, implored to lend their names to scores of worthy causes.\n\nHow did all this come about? What is the Nobel Prize? How did it come to eclipse all others in glory and cachet? And is it really worth all the attention?\n\nThe prizes are the child of Alfred Nobel - not, as is sometimes thought, a guilt-ridden arms manufacturer but the inventor of dynamite, which he wishfully believed would end war by making war too terrible to contemplate. The invention brought him an immense fortune.\n\nBut Nobel, who never married, had no heirs. So in his handwritten will he directed that his estate be invested in \"safe securities,\" with the proceeds to \"generate a fund, the interest of which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.\"\n\nNobel created five such prizes - for chemists, physicists, researchers in medicine and physiology, writers of literature and \"champions of peace.\"\n\n(But none, to the sorrow of those who slave over numbers, for mathematicians. Contrary to rumor, this was not because Nobel's mistress cheated on him with a mathematician. The Nobel Foundation, which oversees the awards, says Nobel just wasn't interested in math.)\n\nA sixth Nobel award, for economists, was established by the Bank of Sweden in 1968.\n\nSince the first awards went out in 1901, five years after their founder's death, more than 600 have been awarded by the Nobel Foundation, 29 of them to women and 17 to institutions such as the Pugwash Conferences, winner of last year's Peace Prize. The rest went to men.\n\nThanks to prudent investing by the foundation, the prizes are generous: about $1.5-million each, up from $100,000 25 years ago. But the allure of the Nobels goes far beyond money. Any winner joins a pantheon that includes Albert Schweitzer, Martin Luther King Jr. and Andrei Sakharov (peace), Albert Einstein and Enrico Fermi (physics), Linus Pauling and Frederick Sanger (chemistry), Alexander Fleming and Francis Crick (physiology or medicine), Paul Samuelson and Milton Friedman (economics), Rudyard Kipling and Alexander Solzhenitsyn (literature).\n\nThe status of the awards, Dr. Polanyi says, is \"an acknowledgment of that fantastic history.\"\n\nThe thoroughness of the selection process also lends weight to the Nobels. The selections are made by four separate bodies: the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (physics, chemistry and economics), the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute (medicine), the Swedish Academy (literature) and the Norwegian Nobel Committee (peace).\n\nEach begins its search in the year preceding the awards, sending out letters to thousands of scientists and professors, asking them to nominate suitable candidates. More than a few hopefuls have opened such letters with trembling hands, only to find they were being asked to nominate someone else.\n\nOn Feb. 1 begins the enormous task of whittling down the nominations to a short list. In the case of the most controversial prize, for literature, five members of the Swedish Academy labor from February through May to produce a list of names numbering six at most. In September, the academicians argue and haggle their way toward a final selection. The moment of truth comes on a Thursday morning in Stockholm when each member writes his or her choice on a piece of paper and places it in an antique silver tankard for counting.\n\nThe world does not always applaud the result. Some critics of the literature prize say the academy tends to hand out awards by region as much by merit. Thus someone may win the prize because it is, say, Latin America's turn.\n\nOthers say the academy prefers obscure writers to literary giants. Among those who have not won the prize are James Joyce, Graham Greene, Joseph Conrad, Thomas Hardy and Vladimir Nabokov.\n\nThe peace prize gets a similar rap. Nobel wanted it to honor those who promoted \"fraternity among nations,\" but in recent years it has often gone to human-rights campaigners. Witness this year's prize to Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo and Jose Ramos-Horta, both of East Timor.\n\nEconomists complain that the Academy of Sciences hands out the prizes by alternating ideological tendencies: one year to a Keynesian who likes activist government, the next to a free-marketer.\n\nAnd some scientists say the Nobels have overlooked the trench workers of discovery. Example: Charles Best, the young researcher whom many say should have shared the medicine prize with Frederick Banting and J.J.R. Macleod for the discovery of insulin.\n\nStill others say the Nobels favor some nations over others. Scandinavian writers, they note, received 14 literature prizes in the first 74 years of the awards. China and India, the world's two most populous nations, have been all but shut out, earning only two Nobels each.\n\nSome have been so disdainful of the awards that they have refused to accept them, as Jean-Paul Sartre did in 1964. But for most, the Nobel remains the pinnacle of achievement and the ultimate in recognition.\n\nOne hint to those who hope: Don't nominate yourself. Under the Nobel rules, it brings automatic disqualification.\n\n(Distributed by Scripps Howard News Service.)"
