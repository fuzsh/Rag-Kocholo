        "text": "KPIX Eyewitness News report from June 6th 1975 by John Lester featuring a press conference at Stanford University by novelist and Nobel Prize winner Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who is being made an honorary fellow of the Hoover Institute. Solzhenitsyn was working on a history of the Russian Revolution in the Hoover Institute's archives. Includes brief scenes from a speech by Solzhenitsyn (translated by Dr Richard F. Staar), who is grateful that: \"Here I have had open access to the richest archival material dealing with Russia. And I can work without any interruption or interference ... There is a Russian proverb that in every unhappiness, there is also happiness.\""
