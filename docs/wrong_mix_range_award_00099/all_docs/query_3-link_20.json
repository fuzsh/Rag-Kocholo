        "text": "tockholm, Oct. 8--Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, the internationally acclaimed Soviet author whose works are banned in his homeland, won the 1970 Nobel Prize for Literature today.\n\nThe writer of the novels \"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,\" \"The First Circle\" and \"The Cancer Ward\" was cited by the Swedish Academy, which makes the annual literature award, \"for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature.\"\n\n[Mr. Solzhenitsyn said he accepted the prize and would travel to Stockholm to receive it \"insofar as this depends on me.\" There was no indication in Moscow how the Soviet authorities would react.]\n\nThe award, to be presented formally at a ceremony here Dec. 10, carries prize money equivalent to about $78,000.\n\nMr. Solzhenitsyn, who was expelled by the Soviet Writers' Union earlier this year with the suggestion that he go into exile, was hailed today by Dr. Karl-Ragnar Gierow, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, as a \"son of the Russian revolution, of Lenin's revolution.\n\n\"He has never given up his spiritual heritage,\" Dr. Gierow added.\n\nMr. Solzhenitsyn, 51 years old, is the second controversial Russian to receive the award in the last 12 years. In 1958, Boris Pasternak, a poet, won the prize mainly for his novel \"Doctor Zhivago,\" but was compelled by the Soviet Union, then led by Nikita S. Krushchev, to refuse the award.\n\nIn 1965, the academy honored Mikhail A. Sholokhov, the Soviet author of \"And Quiet Flows the Don.\" Mr. Sholokhov, who enjoys official favor, made the trip to Stockholm to receive his award.\n\nThe award to Mr. Sholokhov was viewed at the time as an attempt to strike a balance with the prize for Mr. Pasternak, which had been assailed in the Soviet Union as a \"hostile political act.\"\n\nIn view of this controversy there had been some doubt whether the academy would now risk affronting Moscow again with the selection of an author who was in official disfavor. The vote today was a close one, with Patrick White, an Australian novelist, losing by a narrow margin.\n\nMr. White lost out last year as well, when the prize went to Samuel Becket, the French- Irish novelist and playwright.\n\nBased on Experiences\n\nThe novels for which Mr. Solzhenitsyn is best known stem largely from his own experiences in prison, to which he was sent in 1945 for having written a letter to a friend critical of Stalin. He was released in 1953 and deported for life from the European part of the Soviet Union. But in 1957, as a result of Mr. Khrushcehv's program of de- Stalinization, he was fully rehabilitated.\n\nThe publication in 1962 of his short novel about life in a Stalin labor camp, \"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,\" brought him wide attention. That book was first published in the Soviet Union, but the two that firmly established his reputation abroad were not.\n\nHowever, smuggled copies of \"The Cancer Ward,\" which details life in a prison hospital under Stalin, and \"The First Circle,\" which describes life in a Stalinist research center for detained scientists, have circulated among Soviet intellectuals.\n\nThese two novels were considered too critical of Soviet society to be allowed to appear.\n\nHis drama \"The Love-Girl and the Innocent.\" is scheduled to have its world premier in Minneapolis Oct. 13. The play, which is also scheduled for the 1971-1972 New York season, is described as a love story of two prisoners in a Stalinist labor camp.\n\nA collection of his short stories is being published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux early next year under the title \"For the Good of the Cause.\"\n\nThe announcement of the literature award came unusually early this year, as Nobel Prizes are not generally awarded before the middle of October, with the medical one leading the way. However, there is no fixed schedule."
