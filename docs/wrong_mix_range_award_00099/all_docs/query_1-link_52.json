        "text": "Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn[lower-alpha 1][lower-alpha 2] (11 December 1918 – 3 August 2008)[6][7] was a Russian author and Soviet dissident who helped to raise global awareness of political repression in the Soviet Union, especially the Gulag prison system. He was awarded the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature\".[8] His non-fiction work The Gulag Archipelago \"amounted to a head-on challenge to the Soviet state\" and sold tens of millions of copies.[9]\n\nQuick Facts Native name, Born ...\n\nClose\n\nSolzhenitsyn was born into a family that defied the Soviet anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and remained devout members of the Russian Orthodox Church. However, he initially lost his faith in Christianity, became an atheist, and embraced Marxism–Leninism. While serving as a captain in the Red Army during World War II, Solzhenitsyn was arrested by SMERSH and sentenced to eight years in the Gulag and then internal exile for criticizing Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in a private letter. As a result of his experience in prison and the camps, he gradually became a philosophically-minded Eastern Orthodox Christian."
