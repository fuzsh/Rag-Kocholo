        "text": "Our Notes & References\n\nFirst edition of Solzhenitsyn’s first published book: a celebrated “pirate” edition published abroad without the author’s consent.\n\nA very good example of the issue with the striking “bearded-man” cover, which Flegon used later in his own book about “the slanderer Solzhenitsyn”. There was another cover published, showing a watchtower instead; there is no priority firmly established, the watchtower being possibly the first.\n\nThe plot of Solzhenitsyn’s very first published novel is set in a Soviet labour camp in the 1950s and describes a single day of an ordinary prisoner, Ivan Denisovich Shukhov.\n\nThe novel was specifically mentioned in the Nobel Prize presentation speech when the Nobel Committee awarded Solzhenitsyn the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1970. After more than half a century since its publication the significance and influence of the deceptively simple story remains unsurpassed.\n\nThe novel first appeared in print in November 1962 in the Soviet literary magazine Novii Mir (New World). It was an extraordinary event in Soviet literary history since never before had an account of Stalinist repression been openly distributed. The editor of Novii Mir, Aleksandr Tvardovskiy, wrote in a short introduction for the issue, titled “Instead of a Foreword”:\n\nThe author chose an ordinary day in the life of a labour camp prisoner from a reveille until lock up. Still, this “ordinary” day can’t but touch the hearts of the readers and let them feel overwhelming sorrow and pain for the fate of the people, who become so close and familiar through the pages of this novel.\n\nEven though the characters are fictional the novel has a very personal feel. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1918-2008) had first-hand experience of the Gulag, having been imprisoned from 1945 to 1953 for writing a derogatory comment in a letter to a fellow officer about the conduct of the war by Joseph Stalin, whom he called “the whiskered one”.\n\nProvenance\n\nSignature to first leaf recto, dated 26.I. 1963; typed number to first leaf verso.\n\nBibliography\n\nT. Mathew, “A guide to the Russian editions of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s major works”, Rare Book Review."
