But now we are reminded with these nine short stories written shortly after his return to Russia and published posthumously in an excellent translation … The more experimental ‘binary’ or two-part tales, which dominate this collection, share the qualities of Solzhenitsyn’s finest prose: its precision and visual clarity; the subtle irony and humour of its tone; its moral truth; and the skilful crafting and shaping of the story for emotional effect”\n\nthe Times\n\n“Read these stories for a reminder of an extraordinary life, for the range of the interests they encompass and for a pugnacious moral energy that even the octogenarian writer was hard pressed to tame”\n\nguardian"
