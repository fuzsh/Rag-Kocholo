        "text": "Help for the politically persecuted is still a topic at the media company today. Fifty years ago, Axel Springer gave the expatriated Nobel Prize winner Alexander Solzhenitsyn journalistic asylum. There was only one direct encounter.\n\nAxel Springer found it difficult to hold back. After Soviet authorities stripped Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1918-2008), winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, of his citizenship in February 1974, and the dissident’s arrival in Frankfurt am Main, the published allowed a few weeks to pass. While he was curious about the author of worldwide renown, he was nevertheless shocked at how overeagerly reporters had “pounced” on Solzhenitsyn, Springer commented later. And he didn’t want to contribute even more to this turmoil.\n\nIn the previous fall of 1973, Solzhenitsyn had released the first volume of his work The Gulag Archipelago in Russian with an exile publisher in Paris. Still regarded today as one of the most influential books of the 20th century, it is a sharp reckoning with the Stalinist prison camp system that Solzhenitsyn himself experienced firsthand from 1945 to 1953 (after which he was ostracized until 1957). He had criticized Stalin in letters to a friend.\n\nThe Kremlin saw his Gulag book as treasonous. The book, a literary work of non-fiction, was the result of his many contacts with people who survived the gulags and had turned to the author after reading Solzhenitsyn’s novels and texts about this topic. In 1970, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in absentia for his vivid descriptions of everyday life in the gulag. This was also registered at Axel Springer Verlag. Solzhenitsyn’s name was also on the waiting list of the two in-house libraries in Hamburg and Berlin, as can be seen from a report in the in-house newspaper “Springer aktuell” from October 1970.\n\nHis release of TheGulag Archipelago and its worldwide success at the beginning of 1974 was something the Kremlin was no longer prepared to accept. In the middle of February, eight men, some in civilian clothing, others in uniform, stormed his flat and took the 55-year-old author with them. He assumed that they wanted to imprison him again. But instead, they put the now officially expatriated and therefore stateless author in a regular Aeroflot flight to Frankfurt am Main.\n\nAxel Springer writes a letter to Solzhenitsyn\n\nOn March 29, 1974, Solzhenitsyn — who was now living in Switzerland — was joined by his wife and their four children, allowing him to finish the second volume of The Gulag Archipelago with peace of mind. On the same day, Axel Springer wrote a four-page letter. “I have often written to you in my thoughts during the period when you had to fight and were in danger, and also when you came ‘over to our side’.” Springer was looking forward with interest to meeting the critical spirit from Moscow. The publisher sensed that Solzhenitsyn would not simply relinquish the unsparing way he looked at the world around him just because he was in the West. Which led him to write the following: “When you were forced out of your home country, I asked God not to let you doubt too much, or even despair when faced with the imperfections of our freedom.”\n\n© Photo: Unternehmensarchiv der Axel Springer SE\n\n© Photo: pa/dpa\n\nThis wasn’t the only letter Axel Springer penned. Before, when Solzhenitsyn’s problems in the Soviet Union following the release of The Gulag Archipelago became known, Irina Pabst, the daughter of a Russian officer who had fought against the Bolsheviks in 1917 and was sentenced to death, was able to flee and make her way to Paris. Together with her husband Pierre, head of the central editorial office at Axel Springer — both of whom were close friends of Axel and Friede Springer — she tried to set up relief efforts for dissidents in the French capital. They failed because of a lack of trust among the Russian emigrants they approached.\n\nThe new dissident magazine Kontinent\n\nIn October 1974, the Ullstein book publisher, which was part of the Axel Springer publishing house, introduced the new dissident magazine Kontinent at the Frankfurt Book Fair. Solzhenitsyn wished him every success from Switzerland. The literary magazine, with more than 200 pages, aimed to offer a platform for independent writers and journalists from the whole of Eastern Europe in an environment protected from Soviet censorship, and to present them to the West European public. This was underscored by Axel Springer in an interview in Kontinent published at the end of 1976 and beginning of 1977. Asked why he was supporting the project, he pointed out that it was only natural for him as a politically active Christian to help people who had been oppressed and persecuted. Dissidents, he added, were “companions in the struggle for freedom”.\n\nhttps://www.axelspringer.com/en/inside/an-ear-for-eastern-europe\n\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn was the big name in the first issue. He had given the magazine its name, supported it, and he wrote articles for the magazine, at least in the initial phase. Solzhenitsyn praised Kontinent in his foreword as the true voice of Eastern Europe. And he also warned Western Europe with the words: “Beware Western Europe, don’t let your ears remain deaf.”\n\n© Photo: Unternehmensarchiv der Axel Springer SE\n\n© Photo: Unternehmensarchiv der Axel Springer SE\n\nJust as Axel Springer had anticipated, Solzhenitsyn did not spare his new home either. In March 1976, he issued a drastic warning: “I just don’t understand how people can lose their intellectual strength, their willpower. How they can possess freedom and not appreciate it, let alone be prepared to make sacrifices for it.” He was not one to shy away from controversial topics out of consideration for others. “The West is standing on the brink of collapse. The Soviet Union does not need to carry out a nuclear attack to conquer the West. It can take the West with its bare hands. Why bother with atomic war when the other side is ready to capitulate with its hands up?”\n\nSpringer visits Solzhenitsyn in the USA\n\nIn October 1978, Axel Springer visited Solzhenitsyn at his house in the US state of Vermont, where the author had been living for two years. As far as we know, it was the only encounter between the two. Months before that, Solzhenitsyn had given a speech in Harvard, where he once again complained that the West had lost its courage and had become a prisoner of its own weakness. In response to Springer’s praise after the speech, the dissident followed up in a letter to the publisher, in which he wrote that the division of the world caused by the two irreconcilable powers, the USA and the Soviet Union, could not be resolved by a series of political upheavals, “but only if people in general take on a spiritual view of things”. This topic was very present during their meeting in Vermont.\n\nI just don’t understand how people can lose their intellectual strength, their willpower.\n\nAlexander Solschenizyn\n\nThe dissident, who invited his guests into a conference room in his “personal reference library”, had prepared for the meeting with Axel Springer. He was familiar with his interview in Kontinent and also with the speech the publisher gave in 1976 at the award ceremony for the Jakob Fugger Medal, which Springer received for his services to the freedom, independence and integrity of the news press. One quote from the speech, which was directed at the GDR, stated, “Where equality is understood as conformity of opinion, where there is no place for those who think differently—that is a place where freedom is at its end.”\n\nWhen they talked with one another on October 10, 1978, Solzhenitsyn described the West as vain, disinterested and “corrupted by material interests”. He also didn’t have a good word to say about the Western press, which he maintained simply accepted this fact, and he asked Axel Springer directly what he was doing to make the West aware of the danger that it was facing from communism and in particular from the Soviet Union. Axel Springer did not accept this criticism in relation to his own publishing house, and pointed to the four basic principles that guided the journalistic work at Springer, which Solzhenitsyn was familiar with.\n\nHowever, Springer did share the author’s criticism concerning the lax attitude of the West vis-à-vis the Soviet Union—he himself also being a sharp critic of West Germany’s ‘Ostpolitik’ (eastern policy). In a speech in 1972 in Stuttgart, he made public the statements of Czech military officers who had fled their country, maintaining that Moscow still considered the idea of regional wars a real possibility—also in Europe. And in a letter from March 29, 1974, Springer complained that the West had been doing its bit for a considerable time to speak the truth in order to encourage people “under the spell of Eastern tyranny”. But, he added, recently the situation had shamefully reversed, and now people needed the encouragement of dissidents like Solzhenitsyn to resist the opportunism “that threatens to suffocate our Western world”.\n\nThere are two cities where you must make a public appearance: Jerusalem and Berlin.\n\nAxel Springer\n\nIn Vermont, four years later, Axel Springer tried to persuade Solzhenitsyn to be more active. He understood, he said, that the author had to be strict about how many public appearances he gave, but nevertheless he should do one at least once a year, because that was the best way to get the necessary message across to the public in the West. Then Springer named two cities in which Solzhenitsyn should definitely make appearances: Jerusalem and Berlin.\n\n© Photo: Unternehmensarchiv der Axel Springer SE\n\n© Photo: Rowohlt Verlag\n\nBerlin had already been one of the main subject matters in his letter from March 29, 1974. He wrote that people who made the effort to escape into the free part of their home country thrived, and that tanks and armed soldiers paraded up and down in the Eastern part of the city only a few streets away from his publishing house. In the divided city, he added, it was “primarily and ultimately about the fight between truth and lies, between justice and injustice, between faith and demonism”. The publisher obviously hoped that Solzhenitsyn would understand his vehement arguments concerning the circumstances in Berlin, especially due to the author’s own experiences living under an unjust regime. Springer also emphasized that it would be presumptuous to compare the stresses of everyday life in Berlin “with the danger and suffering that you were exposed to in Russia and which your friends continue to be exposed to”.\n\nThe publisher hope to receive advice from the dissident\n\nAxel Springer, who suffered from the swing to the left that had taken place in West German society since 1967, and who was also repeatedly and fiercely subject to personal attacks in public, closed his letter of March 1974 with a request and an offer: “Please take us by the hand and, with God’s help, lead us out of the misguidedness that our world threatens to succumb to. Tell us what we can do to help your friends in Russia, and to help your great, suffering people without freedom to an extent that is within our power.”\n\nAfter their meeting on October 10, 1978, the publisher thanked the author for the long conversation in “friendship that came about suddenly but is a lasting one”. The fact alone that his publishing house is not in Russia “makes me hesitate to call it a paradise,” Springer continued. Solzhenitsyn and Springer did not agree on all the issues but did so in many essential matters. “Do you believe that every people has its own personality just as individuals do?” Solzhenitsyn asked him. “That’s exactly what I mean”, Springer replied. “In that we agree”, is the answer recorded in the 16-page minutes of the meeting left to the publisher’s estate. They maintained contact until the beginning of the 1980s, during which there were considerations to set up of a Russian cultural center in Paris. Axel Springer died in 1985.\n\nHelp for politically persecuted people and dissidents is still an issue for the media and technology company Axel Springer today. A year ago, it set up the Axel Springer Freedom Foundation. The non-profit organization supports dissidents, artists and media professionals as well as projects from authoritarian countries who stand up for freedom, human rights and democracy, often at great personal risk. It thus continues the tradition of the company founder, whose commitment to freedom was always the basis for his personal and entrepreneurial actions\n\nhttps://freedom.axelspringer.com/de/\n\nVery recent: On March 21, a solidarity evening took place on the Campus for Democracy in Berlin. The Freedom Foundation, the Robert Havemann Society and the Stasi Records Archive organized the event on the site of the former Stasi headquarters. A “Pathway to Freedom” handbook initiated by the Foundation for political prisoners and their relatives was presented with information and addresses."
