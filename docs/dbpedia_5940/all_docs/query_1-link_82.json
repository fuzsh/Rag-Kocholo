        "text": "When you talk about downloading a torrent file, it’s normally assumed that you’re looking to download some illegal and copyright protected content from the Internet. This belief is so popular that many companies have simply blocked access to torrents from their internal networks.\n\nThe question is, how do you download legal torrents while in your office where the entire torrent network is blocked? Well, that’s where the Transmission web interface comes into the picture.\n\nIf you don’t already know, the Transmission web interface is a torrent client that allows you to download torrents on your computers. It has a feature that lets you access the client installed on your computer from another machine on the internet.\n\nIn simple words, you can install the app on your computer and then control it from your office machine. This way you can download torrents even when you’re away from your machine.\n\nWhy To Use The Transmission Web Interface\n\nThere are various reasons as to why you may want to use the Transmission web interface. One of these is mentioned above where your office doesn’t allow access to torrents but you still wish to download them.\n\nOther scenarios may include the following:\n\nWhen you’re on the go and you want a file downloaded when you get back home.\n\nYou want to cancel a torrent download immediately as you found out it has a virus but you aren’t at your computer.\n\nYou’ve received a message from your ISP that you’ve exceeded your data limit and you’ll be now charged per MB/GB. You may want to cancel some of your torrent downloads.\n\nRegardless of why you want to use it, configuring and using the Transmission web client is fairly easy.\n\nDownloading And Configuring Transmission Web Interface\n\nTransmission by default doesn’t have the web client enabled in it. That means you’ll need to go into the settings menu and enable an option so your app can be accessed from anywhere on the internet.\n\nThe following procedure has been performed on a Mac machine. Steps should be similar for other platforms.\n\nIf you haven’t already, head over to the Transmission website and download and install the app on your computer.\n\nLaunch the app and you’ll get a prompt. Hit Open to open the app anyway.\n\nClick on the Transmission menu at the top and select the option that says Preferences. You’ll enable the web interface from there.\n\nWhen the preferences pane opens, click on the last tab that says Remote. It’ll help you set up remote access to the app.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is tick-mark the box that says Enable remote access to turn on the Transmission web interface.\n\nSecondly, you may want to add password protection to your web client. To do so, tick-mark the Require authentication box and then enter a username and password in the given fields. You’ll then need to use these logins to access the Transmission web interface.\n\nKeep the listening port as is unless it’s being used by other apps on your machine.\n\nIf you want the web interface to be only accessed by certain IPs, check the box for that and then use the + (plus) sign to add those IP addresses. You can use a wildcard as well.\n\nThen, click on the Launch web interface button to launch the Transmission web interface in your browser.\n\nIf everything goes well, you should see an interface that looks something like the following. It means the web interface has been successfully set up.\n\nThe Transmission web client can now be accessed from your other computers.\n\nConfiguring Your Router To Accept Connections\n\nWhile this may not be the case on all routers, some routers require you to set up port forwarding before you can access the Transmission web interface from a remote device. This can be set up from your router’s settings menu and the generic steps to do it are given below.\n\nFind the local IP address of your computer.\n\nOpen a browser and enter in 192.168.1.1. Log-in to your router’s settings menu. By default, logins should be admin and admin for both the fields.\n\nClick on Forwarding at the top to open forwarding options.\n\nSelect Port Forwarding on the following screen.\n\nEnter in 9091 in both Start and End port fields.\n\nEnter your computer’s local IP address in the IP field.\n\nTick-mark Enable and click on OK at the bottom.\n\nOpen a browser, go to Google, and search for My IP. Note down your IP address.\n\nUsing The Transmission Web Interface\n\nYou only need to access the IP from a remote device to use the Transmission web interface.\n\nOpen a browser on your remote computer/device and enter the IP address you noted down in step-5 in the above section followed by a colon and 9091. For example, if IP was 103.30.220.121, you’d type in 103.30.220.121:9091 and hit Enter.\n\nYou’ll see the Transmission web interface on your screen.\n\nMonitor Downloads And Uploads\n\nYou can see the progress on the downloads and uploads of your torrents. It’s on the main screen.\n\nPause And Resume Torrent Downloads\n\nYou can pause and resume your downloads as well. Select the torrent to pause and click on the pause icon at the top.\n\nTo resume a torrent download, select the torrent and click on the resume icon at the top.\n\nAdd New Torrents To Download\n\nTo add a new torrent for downloading, click on the first icon and then enter the URL for the torrent.\n\nIt’ll begin downloading on your computer where Transmission is installed.\n\nRemove Existing Torrent Downloads\n\nIf you no longer want to download a torrent, you can have it removed.\n\nSelect the torrent and then click on the second icon in the menu bar. Choose Remove on your screen."
