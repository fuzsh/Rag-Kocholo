        "text": "Iconic. Sonic. Bionic.\n\nThe S-1 merges retro spirit and advanced capabilities in a pocket-size package you can take anywhere. Our evolving Analog Circuit Behavior (ACB) tech provides the authentic tone and response of the SH-101, an iconic ’80s monosynth embraced for its characterful sound and simple, direct-access panel. Extending the original’s design with four-voice polyphony and a slate of innovative features for next-level music creation, the S-1 makes it easy for musicians at any level to explore the power of synthesis through a friendly, uncomplicated interface.\n\nTone tweaker’s paradise.\n\nLoaded with expressive tactile controls, the S-1 is a sound design and performance powerhouse in miniature. Create lavish tones with oscillator, envelope, filter, and LFO sections. Dive into deeper design tools with quick combo button presses. Adjust effects using dedicated knobs. And with 26 multi-function pads, you have access to a keyboard with a two-plus octave range, a step sequencer interface, and a wealth of creative options to spark fresh ideas.\n\nWild sound design.\n\nThe S-1 is primed to push classic SH tones into new dimensions. Build from square, saw, sub, and noise oscillators and mono, poly, unison, and chord modes. Or craft custom waveshapes on the step pads using the powerful OSC Draw function. OSC Chop unlocks even more harmonic potential, allowing you to cut waveforms into sections and explore a labyrinth of metallic timbres. Then top off your tones by using the noise oscillator as an independent riser to add sweeps and pulsing sound effects.\n\nInspired sequencing.\n\nCreate compelling music in moments with the S-1’s 64-step sequencer and 64 patterns. Record live with the onboard keyboard or switch to step mode for detailed note entry and editing. Use motion recording to animate patterns with panel control tweaks or set parameter values for individual steps. Then delve into probability settings for randomization, sub steps for rapid-fire rhythms, and other features like velocity, shuffle, portamento, and more to bring your music to life.\n\nPerformance playground.\n\nThe S-1 is packed with features to inspire dynamic performances. Get physical with D-Motion to create compelling sound changes simply by moving the synth. Pop on the arpeggiator for cascading musical moments. Trigger the Step Loop function for live fills and on-the-fly rhythmic improv. And transpose patterns with just a few quick touches to instantly add harmonic richness to your jams.\n\nImmortal effects.\n\nEnhance your sonic palette with a wide selection of classic Roland effects. Add shimmering dimension with lush choruses derived from the iconic JUNO and JX-3P synths. Introduce spaciousness and movement with manual and tempo-synced delays. Then envelop your sounds with studio-grade reverb effects and a variety of adjustable parameters.\n\nUnbound versatility.\n\nThe S-1 has all the connectivity you need to sync with your musical world. Link up with other AIRA Compacts like the T-8 Beat Machine, J-6 Chord Synthesizer, and E-4 Voice Tweaker to create a portable creative juggernaut. Interface with computer DAWS and mobile music apps via USB-C. Or use the S-1 and its MIDI I/O as a standalone sound module in a larger performance rig.\n\nEverywhere\n\nat once.\n\nThe S-1 is ready to deliver instant inspiration anytime and anywhere. The lithium-ion battery provides up to 4.5 hours of runtime per charge, while the rugged Roland build will support you through years of musical journeys."
