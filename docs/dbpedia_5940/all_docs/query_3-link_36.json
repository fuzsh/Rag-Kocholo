The torrent software is overloading the cable modem. A static IP address will not help. Your IP address is assigned when you connect to the network and renewed on a periodic basis - usually every 24 hours. The only solution is to not use torrent software or configure it so that it doesn't overload your cable modem.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: etresoft\n\nUser level: Level 8\n\n48,406 points\n\nTony.Andreoli wrote:\n\nForgive my ignorance, but what does the cable modem being overloaded, or even plugged in, have to do with my MacBook attaching to a WAP that is not the router?\n\nWell, it could be some other device too, maybe the Linksys. Torrent software is the most extreme environment that network equipment can encounter. It is almost like your are running a DDoS attack on yourself. In theory, your switch should isolate the rest of the network, but only for network activity that does not involve the internet.\n\nI would expect that I should be able to connect to the AEBS regardless of the state of my cable modem or the Linksys router.\n\nIf it were configured differently, you probably could. But that would mean it would be an access point for only local services. As soon as it tries to contact the internet via other equipment that is being beaten senseless with a rubber torrent, it will report that it has trouble contacting the internet.\n\nAs for this statement, \"A static IP address will not help. Your IP address is assigned when you connect to the network and renewed on a periodic basis - usually every 24 hours.\" It sounds as if you're mixing static IP and DHCP. True, the EXTERNAL address of the router/modem will get assigned and renewed, but the static address on the MacBook is just that, static. It doesn't send out a DHCP request for and address, nor does it expect a response back before connecting.\n\nWhat I am saying is that had you used DHCP, it wouldn't have made any difference. Having a static address only saves you from having to negotiate an IP address once a day or so. Except for those 200 milliseconds while DHCP is doing its magic, there is going to be no difference between a DHCP address and a static address.\n\nIt really feels more like the AEBS is flipping out due to the traffic on the wire, thereby not allowing the MacBook to connect via wireless.\n\nIt is connected to a switch, so it doesn't know there is any traffic on the wire. The switch hides all that. However, when the Airport Express tries to get past the switch, it doesn't get good responses and reports, correctly, that it can't connect.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: etresoft\n\nUser level: Level 8\n\n48,406 points\n\nIt is setup in bridge mode and the rest of its bridge is not functional so it reflects that status.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: etresoft\n\nUser level: Level 8\n\n48,406 points\n\nTony.Andreoli wrote:\n\nI guess I'm still confused. Why is the rest of the bridge not functional?\n\nIt is functional. It is serving up your torrents. But then you ask it to do some web browsing too and it just responds \"no mÃ¡s, no mÃ¡s\".\n\nConsumer-grade hardware was never designed for bittorrent. Your switch can handle it, but the cable modem and Linksys router are having trouble.\n\nLink\n\nUser profile for user: Asatoran\n\nUser level: Level 4\n\n2,532 points\n\n@Tony.Andreoli: For the moment, let's assume that what the other posts have stated is true, that the amount of torrent data is more than your cable modem and/or router can handle. Realize that \"No internet connection\" means that your Mac is trying to actually connect to something on the internet outside of your router and cable modem in order to give you that status. If you've used up all the bandwidth with torrents, then you Mac sees a traffic jam.\n\nThe obvious first workaround to try is to reconfig your torrent software to limit the amount of traffic it will handle. For example, I use uTorrent on a dedicated PC, similar to what you're doing. uTorrent has a preference for upload and download bandwidth, which defaults to unlimited. If you happen to have a very popular file, then you could easily use up all your cable modem's bandwidth. So limiting upload bandwidth would help there. And if you're downloading a lot of files simultaneously, then limiting the download bandwidth would reserve some bandwidth for your other computers. Yes, it will slow down the torrents, but that is why you have a PC dedicated to torrents, right? ðŸ˜‰\n\nThat may also help with the issue of a \"consumer grade\" router not being able to handle the bandwidth load. I've found that the Linksys consumer line is fine for general use, but I've had trouble with them on heavy use. I was using a D-Link but had trouble with my VPN working with it so I'm now using a Cisco Linksys RV042. Basically a router from their small business line. I've found that the reliability and uptime is better (much less resets of the router) and my speed is slightly better than with my previous consumer grade D-Link or Linksys WRT110N. The RV042 doesn't have built-in Wi-Fi, but I have enough access points around the house to make it less of an issue for me.\n\nSo try changing your torrent settings first. And if you can, limit the amount of active torrents. (e.g.: Seed less. Seed none, if possible. And don't download as many simultaneously.)\n\nLink"
