        "text": "Why Study Electrical Engineering?\n\nElectrical engineering jobs represent over 25% of all available jobs in engineering!\n\nIn India 30 % of the government jobs are from Electrical Engineering sector\n\nA EEE student can enter in to the job market of Computer engineering, Electronics & communication engineering, Instrumentation engineering, control engineering, robotics, mechanical engineering, VHDL, VLSI. But any branch of other engineering student can not enter in to the Electrical Engineering job market.\n\nOther than conventional Electrical Engineering jobs like power generation, distribution, transmission, manufacturing and utilization sectors, Electrical engineers are well positioned to address a variety of the crucial engineering issues facing societies today.\n\nThey cover wide variety of applications:\n\nEnergy: efficient lighting, buildings, computing, and communications; solar cells; low power devices and circuits; energy harvesting from the environment; smart power grids;\n\nInformation: security; communications; networks; machine learning;\n\nHealth: informatics; medical imaging, sensing, and diagnosis; brain imaging;\n\nSignal Processing—Transform a 3-kHz phone line into a 56 kb/s modem and 1.5-10 Mb/s ADSL.\n\nTelecommunications—Design and build the next-generation Internet.\n\nWireless Communications and Networking—Provide tools without tether.\n\nSensors, Microwave, and Image Processing—Map the surface of earth and planets or reveal the heart beat of a one-inch fetus.\n\nMicro-Electronics—Turn sand (yes, sand) into CPUs and memory.\n\nEnergy Systems and Power Electronics—Make small MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) and big motors run by controlling the power from picowatts to megawatts and voltage from nanovolts to megavolts.\n\nNano-Electronics and Nano-Optics—Create new materials and discovers novel phenomenon by manipulating atoms and molecules.\n\nPlasma Processing—Give energy to electrons and ions.\n\nLaser and Photonics—Tame photons and generates the most brilliant light.\n\nMEMS, CAD, and Microsystems—Design and predict performance of systems.\n\nBiomedical Engineering, Communication and Signal Processing, Control Engineering, Electromagnetic’s, Electronics and Microelectronics, Power Systems, Optical Engineering, Energy engineering, VHDL, VLSI, robotics etc.,\n\nThe discipline of electrical engineering is grounded in the sciences and in mathematics. If you enjoy these subjects, then you will find electrical engineering a fascinating and rewarding field of study with many opportunities to solve key engineering problems."
