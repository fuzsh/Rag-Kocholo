They are often influenced by comic books or manga and have been part of Japanese culture for decades. Japanese anime is built upon brilliantly-written storylines and often gains sizeable global followings.\n\nThe popularity of the genre in Western countries can be traced to the early 2000s when Americans started developing a keen interest in uniquely animated characters and storylines. Some, like Attack On Titan, have massive fan bases in the USA. As a matter of fact, Hollywood is reportedly attempting a movie adaptation of this popular series.\n\nIf you find yourself hooked on anime, you’re not alone. Yearly, tens of thousands of fans around the world throng conventions are organized to celebrate the culture. For some reason, the genre has a magical appeal across genders, ages, and nationalities. It doesn’t matter who or where you are — the right movie will rob you of all sense of time as you channel your attention to the suspense and the action-packed scenes. The satisfaction of allowing yourself to be dragged into the world of anime can be rejuvenating. Whether you’re a fan of the artistic visuals and creative storyline, or trying to relive your inner child with the battling superheroes, anime offers you a perfect channel to relax and de-stress. Once you’ve been drawn into one, you’ll be hooked and will be left wanting more.\n\nAnd, here’s the good news: for every mainstream movie that you watch, there are hundreds of equally brilliant anime series that are begging for your attention. For a clearer picture, hundreds of thousands of anime titles are released each year. But, just because a series hasn’t made it to the mainstream, it doesn’t mean that it’s of inferior quality. It just means that the competition for anime in Japan is fierce, and by limiting yourself to only mainstream, you could be missing out on some of the finest gems.\n\nTo fulfill your thirst for a more brilliantly made movie, we’re going to share our preferred list of torrenting sites where we managed to download and watch our favorite characters in action. But before you start visiting these sites, read on to learn what you’re getting into.\n\nAre Anime torrents illegal?\n\nWhile the act of sharing files on a torrenting platform isn’t illegal, uploading and downloading anime torrent files probably is. If the particular anime is copyrighted, and most are probably so, you’ll be flouting copyright laws.\n\nMost countries do have strict copyright laws. Although legal actions taken on torrent downloaders are relatively small in numbers, they do happen. In Japan, a 39-year-old man was arrested for downloading anime and other files on P2P software.\n\nIn some countries, users downloading copyrighted torrents may be issued a notice by their ISPs. Depending on the situation, legal charges may be issued.\n\nWhere to find Anime torrents\n\nWhile streaming services have gone mainstream, the torrenting community is still active. However, not all P2P communities are great for anime torrents. Anime fans tend to visit specific torrent sites that cater to genre lovers.\n\nIf you’re new to downloading anime torrents, you may end up searching at the wrong place. In this guide, we’ve created a list of highly-popular anime torrent sites. These sites boast huge collections of titles across different genres.\n\nInstead of ending up on a wild goose chase, just visit any of the sites on our list and you may find the title that you’ve been looking for.\n\nWhere to download old Anime torrents\n\nIf you’ve caught snippets of Great Teacher Onizuka, Fushigi Yuugi, or other exciting animes that were aired decades ago, you may have trouble streaming it on content providers like Netflix. To satisfy your curiosity about how the story develops, you’ll need to turn to alternative sources of anime.\n\nAsk any anime fans and they’ll point you to anime-themed torrent sites. We’ve listed some of the highly popular anime torrent sites in our guide. These sites often have a search feature that allows you to locate classic anime quickly.\n\nSome of these anime torrenting sites also provide filters that return the torrent results of animes within specific dates. Your chances of watching old movies on torrent sites are higher than tuning in to the mainstream streaming providers.\n\nHow to choose a torrent site for Anime\n\nYou’ll want to be cautious when choosing torrent sites to download your favorite anime. The harsh truth is: torrenting has been given a bad name by some sites that are filled with scam links and virus files.\n\nIt is senseless to have your computer or mobile phone messed up just because you’re keen to catch up with the latest episode of the monster-bashing movie.\n\nOf course, the best torrent sites should have a rich collection of animes across all genres. The number of users downloading or sharing the file is also important as torrenting speed increases when more users are sharing the same file.\n\nWhile some fans prefer subbed versions of the titles, others enjoy watching dubbed episodes of the anime. It helps if the torrent site has options of both dubbed and subbed versions to choose from.\n\nTorrent sites used to be a clutter of text and links. But some anime torrent sites are built with intuitive interfaces. You should be able to locate or browse titles easily.\n\nUltimately, you’ll want to stay safe when torrenting. Installing anti-virus software helps but you’ll want to visit torrent sites that are frequented by fans, instead of taking unnecessary risks with unknown sites.\n\nWhat’s the best Anime torrent site?\n\nThe fact is, there are various torrent sites where you can download animes. However, some sites may edge out others in terms of features, content, and accessibility. For example, Bakabt allows you to connect with fellow anime fans, but you’ll need to have your application approved before you get to download anime torrents.\n\nIf you’re looking for a user-friendly site with a reasonable amount of anime titles, you ought to try out AniRena. It features a list of anime titles accompanied by the number of seeders and leechers. There’s also no need to create an account to download the torrent.\n\nIf you prefer plain and simple torrent sites, the best option is Anime Tosho. It has an updated list of newly uploaded torrents. No fancy backgrounds but purely a large collection of torrents for anime fans.\n\nBest VPN for torrenting Anime\n\nIf you’re unable to access any of the anime torrent sites above or download the anime with a P2P client, you’re not alone. ISPs block torrent downloads in certain countries as some users have been abusing torrenting technology in sharing copyright-infringing content.\n\nBut there’s a way in getting around censorship, and it’s by installing a VPN on your device. The VPN or Virtual Private Network, allows you to connect to secure servers in countries with access to anime torrent sites. In other words, the device that you’re browsing from takes up the IP address of another country, therefore bypassing ISP censorship.\n\nIn all honesty, anime torrent sites aren’t the safest place to be. When you’re using peer-to-peer torrenting software, your IP address is exposed to other users on the platform. That makes you vulnerable to any attacks from hackers who happen to be targeting users from torrent sites.\n\nA VPN does more than cloak your presence: it encrypts information originating and heading to your device. Any hackers intercepting your data will have the impossible task of breaking the encryption.\n\nWith that said, not all VPNs are torrent-friendly. Some don’t support access to torrent sites or may have discouraging connection speed for torrenting.\n\nTo help you get started and enjoy downloading your favorite anime, we’ve compiled the top VPNs that provide great support for torrent sites.\n\nUse ClearVPN for torrenting Anime\n\nClearVPN is fast and beautiful VPN service with 45+ server locations.

The only thing you need to do, to start safe torrenting:\n\nGo to ClearVPN website and download the app for your device.\n\nCreate your account and log into the app.\n\nJust Tap on the main button, and you will be connected to the optimal server automatically. Yes, that’s all, it is so simple.\n\nNow you have a strong and secure connection, so you can use your torrenting client safely.\n\nWhy should you use a VPN when downloading anime torrents?\n\nAt this point, you might be wondering — is it really necessary to use a VPN to download anime torrents? As long as you don’t download any copyrighted content from the best anime torrent sites, then you should be fine right?\n\nWell, the thing is — it can be difficult for the average user to determine whether the torrent they’re downloading from the best anime torrent sites are copyrighted or not. Yes, you can download torrents without a VPN, but your ISP (internet service provider) and copyright trolls might get involved and this could lead to legal problems in the future.\n\nCopyright trolls, in particular, make their money by tracking down people who are downloading copyrighted content via torrents. They then send them letters asking for compensation, otherwise, legal action will be taken.\n\nThis is where VPN services come in — downloading torrents will be safer when you use a VPN to secure your connection and ensure your anonymity online. Only then can you take advantage of our list of the best anime torrent sites 2023 without having to worry that you might get in trouble down the line?

Even though P2P file-sharing technology is legal, many of the files exchanged via P2P are indeed copyrighted. Uploading these copyrighted files can put you at risk of a civil lawsuit. While these lawsuits are often class-action cases, some have been targeted at individual users in an attempt to make an example of them."
