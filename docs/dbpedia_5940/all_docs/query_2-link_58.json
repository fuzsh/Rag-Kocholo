        "text": "In uTorrent, press CTRL+P to open the Preferences dialog. Click on Bandwidth on the left sidebar. You should see three input boxes under Number of Connections. Try to halve the value in each. You may have to experiment with the values to strike the right balance.\n\nAlso, it is advisable to limit the number of running torrents to keep uTorrent from saturating your local network and Internet link. In the Preferences dialog, click on Queueing on the left sidebar. Halve the values inside Queue Settings (there are two).\n\nOne last thing to keep in mind is that uTorrent (or any other BitTorrent client) may irritate other users in your network because of clogged bandwidth and increased latency, so be prepared to receive complaints and compromise accordingly. I personally only run any kind of BitTorrent client late at night, before I go to bed when there is nobody using the Internet.\n\nThis is very possibly a dns issue?\n\nTorrent will be connected already so wont' be bothered by dns not working, but every request to connect to a website or ping a name eg ping google.comrequires a dns lookup.\n\nTry changing your DNS servers your machine uses in the properties of your network card. Details in link below.\n\nhttps://www.opennicproject.org/configure-your-dns/how-to-change-dns-servers-in-windows-7/\n\nChange them to different dns servers from the ones your using such as\n\nGoogle DNS Servers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n\nor\n\nOpenDNS IP Addresses 208.67.222.222 208.67.220.220"
