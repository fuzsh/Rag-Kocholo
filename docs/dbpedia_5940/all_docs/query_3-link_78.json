        "text": "Editor’s Note: On April 25, 2024, the FCC reclassified ISPs once again under Title II. That means net neutrality regulations have gone back into effect. These regulations were previously revoked in 2016 which is why ISPs could throttle your internet service over the past few years. Well those days are over and you should no longer be subjected to ISP throttling.\n\nIn a more digital world, slow internet speeds feel like being stuck in quicksand. It gets in the way of watching Netflix, researching for school work, or FaceTiming a friend from overseas. But, internet speeds are weird. They could be slow due to the place you live, the package you buy from your ISP, or your ISP might be throttling your speeds. Well, we tackle that last one here. And yeah, even though net neutrality is back, ISPs might still be throttling your internet.\n\nThere are a few ways you can get your ISP to stop throttling your speeds. So, we’ll take you through what ISP throttling is. We’ll also discuss how to tell if it’s happening to you, and how to get rid of it.\n\nFeel Like Your Network Is Throttled?\n\nOne way you can tell if your ISP is throttling your speeds is by using a VPN. In many cases, ISPs throttle you based on your IP address. A VPN changes the IP address your ISP sees when you use the internet. So, if your ISP is throttling you, your network speeds should get better when you change your IP with a VPN. Here are our top choices for VPNs we’ve tested that can help to combat throttling:\n\nEditor's Rating:\n\n9.7 /10\n\nEditor's Rating:\n\n9.5 /10\n\nEditor's Rating:\n\n9.4 /10\n\nSecurity.org expertise, powered by AI.\n\nAsk your VPN questions. We have answers!\n\nGive market insight\n\nWhat are some popular VPN brands?\n\nSummarize features\n\nWhat are the best VPN features I should look for?\n\nFind the best price\n\nWhich VPN is the cheapest?\n\nISP Throttling\n\nISP throttling, also called data throttling or bandwidth throttling, isn’t a super-complex topic, but it’s still a problem. It really gets annoying when your stream starts buffering while you watch the last episode of “Stranger Things.”\n\nWhat Is Throttling?\n\nThrottling is when your internet service provider, or ISP, slows down your internet speeds on purpose. This means they limit your bandwidth for some sites. You can think of your bandwidth as the amount of internet your ISP gives you. The bad news is that ISPs can throttle any site or use that they want, from live streaming and gaming to high-def video, downloading, and torrenting.1\n\nNOTE: Using a torrenting VPN can help you get around your ISP throttling. Learn how to torrent with a VPN.\n\nWhy Do ISPs Throttle?\n\nThere are a lot of reasons why ISPs throttle (no, it’s not to get on your last nerve):\n\nYou visit the same sites frequently. With net neutrality reinstated, ISPs can no longer legally throttle specific websites.\n\nThe ISP’s bandwidth has reached its limit.\n\nYou have reached the data cap of your internet plan.\n\nYour ISP has a proprietary streaming service and throttles its competitors. That’s why many people use VPNs for streaming. Learn how to watch Netflix with a VPN. This is now an illegal practice under net neutrality rules.\n\nHow to Tell If Your ISP Is Throttling Your Internet Speeds\n\nWhile all throttling slows down your internet speeds, there are a lot of other causes for slow internet speeds as well. So how can you tell if you’re a victim of your ISP throttling your speeds?\n\nInternet Health Test\n\nOne easy way to tell if your ISP is throttling you is to use the Battle for the Net’s Internet Health Test. This free test will send internet traffic outside of your ISP’s network and compare speeds to check your connection for a sign of your ISP degrading your speeds.\n\nWhen you use an open port to game online, you can cause your internet to throttle. This stems from your ISP blocking ports. To see if certain ports are blocked:\n\nBlocked Ports Test\n\nGo to portchecker.co.\n\nPut in your external IP address.\n\nChoose what port number you want to check.\n\nClick Check.\n\nIf you see the port as Rejected, you might have a throttling issue.\n\nTry port forwarding to fix it.\n\nYou can use a gaming VPN to check for a blocked port as well. A VPN encrypts your IP address and all websites you visit which blocks your ISP from slowing your speeds through blocked ports.\n\nInternet Speed Test\n\nOr you can do one of our favorite kinds of tests, an old-fashioned speed test. You’ll need a VPN for this test, by the way.\n\nGo to Ookla’s online speed test.2\n\nPress Go.\n\nWrite down your ping, download speed, and upload speed.\n\nOpen up your VPN app.\n\nConnect to a server.\n\nRepeat steps one through three. If you see your speeds go up on the same sites with the VPN on, then you have been throttled.\n\nSigns of Internet Throttling\n\nHere are a few signs that could mean your ISP throttles your speeds and that you might want to run a test:\n\nSome websites are blocked or don’t work right.\n\nDownload speeds have slowed.\n\nCertain websites or services are slower than others.\n\nStreams buffer or lag.\n\nYour internet speeds slow down from time to time.\n\nYour Wi-Fi connection breaks or gives a choppy signal.\n\nWhich ISPs Throttle?\n\nThere are a lot of ISPs out there that throttle. It would be easier to say the ISPs that don’t throttle than the ones that do. But, we don’t take the easy path. So, here are the ISPs with data caps:\n\nAT&T\n\nBuckeye Broadband\n\nCable ONE\n\nCenturyLink\n\nCox\n\nHughesNet\n\nMediacom\n\nViasat\n\nXfinity\n\nIf you want to fully avoid data limits, choose a high-speed ISP like Spectrum, Frontier, or RCN3 if they are in your area.\n\nOther Reasons Your Internet Is Slow\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for slow internet speeds aside from throttling. Here are a few of the most common reasons your internet might be slow:\n\nYou’re using the web during peak hours. This can cause what’s called network congestion.\n\nYou need to do some browser maintenance, like a software update.\n\nYou have too many tabs open (our own nightmare).\n\nYou do a lot of high-bandwidth things like video calls, torrenting, streaming, etc.\n\nYour modem or router is old.\n\nYou’re using Wi-Fi rather than Ethernet, which is generally faster.\n\nShould You Be Concerned About ISP Throttling?\n\nSo is ISP throttling that big of a deal? It depends on who you are. Some people think of it as a mere annoyance, while others see it as a form of internet censorship.\n\nBut there’s the larger question of getting what you pay for in terms of internet speeds as well. A study from Northeastern University found that almost all of the U.S. cellular providers throttle your speeds.4 Is that fair if your speed tests don’t meet the speeds you pay for? We don’t think so. But, your level of concern is your choice.\n\nHow to Stop ISP Throttling\n\nIf ISP throttling is a huge concern of yours, we can solve your problem: Use a VPN. And even if you don’t want to use one for any reason, we have some other ways you can get on a free and open internet.\n\nVPN\n\nA VPN is a virtual private network that hides your IP address and your browsing history from your ISP. If your ISP can’t see where you go online or who you are, then it can’t throttle sites. This keeps your ISP from singling you out. Learn how to set up a VPN to get started.\n\nProxy\n\nAnother way you can stop your ISP from throttling you is with a proxy server. This will hide your IP address too so your ISP can’t tell who you are. But unlike a VPN, a proxy server does not hide the way you use the internet. So, it’s not the best choice if you want full privacy.\n\nNew ISP\n\nIf you want, you can shop around to find a new ISP that gives you a higher or no data cap.\n\nMonitor Data Usage\n\nYou can get your ISP to stop throttling your speeds by monitoring your use of data. If you don’t hit your data limit, your ISP won’t throttle your speeds. Well, at least not for that reason.\n\nComplain to the Government\n\nIf all else fails, you can send a complaint to the FCC or your congressperson. To contact the FCC:\n\nEmail ecfs@gcc.gov.\n\nIn the body of the email, use the words “get form” and your email address.\n\nYou will get a form in your email that you can use to send a complaint.\n\nOr you can look up your congressperson’s email through the U.S. House of Representatives website.5\n\nIs Throttling Legal?\n\nIt might surprise you, but this is quite the contentious topic. In 2003, the concept of net neutrality first came into play which meant the FCC would treat the internet as an essential service. This gives them a lot more control over how ISPs conduct their business. One of the big parts of that regulation was limiting ISP throttling for specific sites. Theoretically, this creates a freer market on the internet since ISPs can’t slow down their competitors’ websites.\n\nWell, in 2016, those rules were repealed. That let ISPs throttle pretty much however they wanted. Things just changed again though at the end of April, 2024 with the FCC reclassifying ISPs once again and putting net neutrality back into play.6 Here’s when ISPs can legally throttle under Net Neutrality:\n\nYour internet contract includes a data cap and you reached your data cap.\n\nThe network of your ISP is overloaded.\n\nYour ISP explains why they are throttling your internet so long as the throttling is not directed at specific sites.\n\nBasically, as long as your ISP is throttling all sites and customers equally, it’s usually going to be legal. They just can’t pick favorites.\n\nDid You Know: Some states like California ban throttling, so for websites based in California, ISPs can’t throttle them.7\n\nDoes Bandwidth Throttling Affect Mobile Data?\n\nThrottling can occur on both mobile and wireless servers. But, most cable, DSL, or fiber does not let ISPs throttle. For those who are using mobile data on phones or tablets, throttling is more likely than on Wi-Fi networks. That’s why we suggest using an Android VPN or an iOS VPN to keep your cell provider from throttling your mobile data.
