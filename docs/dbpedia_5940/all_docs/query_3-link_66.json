This means that even after you sync, you won't see the item on your other eReaders or apps.\n\nSome USB-C hubs may not detect your Kobo eReader. If you use a USB hub, connect your eReader with a USB-C to USB-A adapter.\n\nWhenever possible, connect your eReader directly to your computer without a hub with the included USB cable. Note: If you're a Mac user running macOS Sonoma 14.4., connecting directly to your computer's USB port without using a hub may solve connection issues.\n\nTo add a non-protected PDF or ePub file to your eReader:\n\nTurn on your eReader.\n\nConnect the micro USB cable to your eReader and to your computer.\n\nOn your eReader, tap Connect when you see the 'Computer detected' window.\n\nNote: If you don't see the 'Computer detected' window, follow the steps in this article to see USB troubleshooting steps.\n\nOn your computer, look for a drive named 'KOBOeReader'.\n\nDrag the PDF or ePub files into the 'Kobo eReader' drive.\n\nEject your eReader:\n\nRight-click on the 'KOBOeReader' drive on your computer's desktop and click Eject.\n\nUnplug the USB cable from your eReader.\n\nYou'll see a \"Importing content\" message on your eReader.\n\nTo find the file you just added on your eReader:\n\nGo to your Home screen.\n\nTap My Books at the bottom of the screen.\n\nTap the name of the book you added to start reading.\n\nLearn more\n\nAdd books to your eReader using Google Drive\n\nAdd books to your eReader using Dropbox\n\nTurn pages, magnify, and rotate PDFs using your Kobo eReader"
