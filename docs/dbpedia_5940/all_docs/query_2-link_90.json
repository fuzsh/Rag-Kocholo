Remove traces of your submission\n\nIf you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.\n\nIn particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.\n\nIf you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion."
