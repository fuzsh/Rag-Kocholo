        "text": "Like many programmes, it arrived with a lot of hype, but the sun quickly set on BBC soap Eldorado as ratings dived. However, in a big plot twist, it is now back on TV three decades later.\n\nThe big budget show, which launched in 1992, is rumoured to have cost the broadcaster in the region of £10million to launch but, after having all that money ploughed into it, with plenty going on a purpose built 'mini town' set near Marbella, it was on screen for just 156 episodes, a fraction of the output of long-lasting BBC soap juggernaut EastEnders.\n\nWhat was meant to be a sun drenched success for the channel quickly became like the package holiday from hell as it was slammed by TV critics and ratings fell off a cliff, going down to just 2.8m, despite its prime time slot.\n\nREAD MORE: BBC soap Eldorado back on TV 30 years on from expensive flop\n\nSome Eldorado viewers still have fond memories of the show, with one telling ChronicleLive: \"...in the last few months it actually got really good. They had sacked all the worst actors and characters and the storylines were really strong.\n\n\"They only cancelled it because the BBC were embarrassed of it really. Anyway, I still watch it now and again and still enjoy it every time.\"\n\nAs the set stands as rack and ruin in Spain, many of the cast have left their acting days behind them but there are few still on screen. And they are now being seen on screen again, with Eldorado now on BritBox to stream.\n\nJesse Birdsall - Marcus Tandy\n\nEldorado's premiere wheeler dealer and shady lothario, Marcus was never far away from trouble in Spain and was given the honour of delivering the soap's final line before credits rolled for a last time.\n\nPreparing to sail off into the sunset, Marcus told girlfriend Pilar: \"you can't trust anyone these days, can you?\"\n\nSince being on Eldorado, Jesse went onto be a lead in often overlooked BBC adventure drama Bugs, before switching channels to play Roger Webb in Footballers' Wives.\n\nManager of fictional team Earls' Park, Roger was married to Gillian Taylforth's on screen alias Jackie Pascoe.\n\nJesse waved goodbye to Footballers' Wives as, after being shot and blinded, Roger fell down an elevator shaft to his death.\n\nMore recently, Jesse appeared as villain Fraser Black in Hollyoaks but was ,killed off in the Channel 4 soap as well.\n\nPolly Perkins - Trish Valentine\n\nOne of Eldorado's most colourful characters, cabaret singer Trish had an eye for the younger man and fans will remember her relationship with toy boy Dieter.\n\nPolly returned to the Eldorado set in 2013 and was left upset at its ghost town state, telling a BBC reporter: \"It's been let go to rack and ruin - I think it's a terrible shame, what a waste.\n\n\"It's not like it's just scenery - these are real homes.\"\n\nSince her Eldorado days, which famously saw her belt out Whitney Houston's I Wanna Dance With Somebody on a tiny stage, Polly, now 78, is best known for appearing on EastEnders as Dot's half sister Rose in 2011 and 2012.\n\nDerek Martin - Alex Morris\n\nSpeaking of EastEnders, many BBC viewers will have completely forgotten that Albert Square's very own Charlie Slater was in Eldorado.\n\nPrior to joining EastEnders as taxi driver and dad to the likes of Mo, Lynne and Kat, Derek appeared in many well known programmes including Upstairs Downstairs, Minder and Only Fools and Horses.\n\nNow 88, he made his debut in EastEnders in 2000 and, while axed in 2010, he later returned for numerous episodes in 2011, 2013 and 2016, with his final episode seeing Charlie die after having a heart attack.\n\nAway from the Square, Derek appeared on Celebrity Coach Trip alongside Nick Cotton actor John Altman in 2012.\n\nSandra Sandri - Pilar Montero\n\nSandra was only 20 when she shot to fame as Pilar on Eldorado, having appeared in film Boom Boom in 1990.\n\nHer last notable appearance according to IMDB was in 2004 film Searching for Love.\n\nRoger Walker - Bunny Charlson\n\nRoger was famous for playing Bunny who was in one of the most talked about early storylines from Eldorado, when he arrived in Spain with 17-year-old bride Fizz.\n\nPrior to Eldorado, Roger had appeared in countless shows including The Darling Buds of May, Bodger and Badger and Emmerdale and since it ended he has gone onto star in Casualty, Peak Practice, The Bill and EastEnders.\n\nLeslee Udwin - Joy Slater\n\nTrish's best friend and bar owner Joy didn't always have it easy on Eldorado.\n\nAway from Eldorado, Leslee set up her own production company - Assassin Films - with some notable successes to her credit, including East is East, Mrs Radcliffe's Revolution and West is West.\n\nEast is East won the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film at the BAFTA Awards, and was declared Best Comedy Film at the British Comedy Awards.\n\nAfter the release of her documentary, India's Daughter, in 2015, Leslee, now 62, was named the Number 2 Most Impactful Woman of 2015 by the New York Times, second only to Hilary Clinton.\n\nPatricia Brake\n\nPatricia played Gwen, the matriarch of Eldorado's Lockhead family, having already found TV fame in the likes of Porridge, its sequel Going Straight and BBC sitcom 2.4 Children.\n\nSince the sun set on Eldorado, Patricia has gone onto appear in fellow soaps EastEnders, Doctors and Coronation Street, as well as drama like Midsomer Murders and Casualty.\n\nCampbell Morrison\n\nPatricia's on screen other half, Drew, was played by Scottish actor Campbell, who like her, also had plenty of TV experience under his belt before Eldorado.\n\nGlasgow born Campbell appeared in the likes of Taggart and The Bill and, after Eldorado, returned to The Bill as well as appearing in Sky's cult favourite football drama Dream Team.\n\nCampbell sadly died in 2008 at the age of 55.\n\nJulie Fernandez\n\nJulie played Gwen and Drew's daughter Nessa Lockhead and, after Eldorado went onto play the on screen other half of EastEnders heartthrob Sean Maguire in BBC drama Dangerfield.\n\nSticking with the BC, she went into play Brenda in smash hit comedy The Office.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\n*Sam Ryder's UK Eurovision victory hopes boosted further as performance clip goes viral\n\n*The Games contestants on ITV including Max George and Olivia Attwood\n\n*UK Eurovision's Sam Ryder gets crucial boost as odds slashed\n\n*Ben Shephard and Susanna Reid at centre of GMB 'spoiler' backlash"
