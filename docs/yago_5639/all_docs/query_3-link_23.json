Then they split in 1992 when Jesse, who went on to star in Footballers' Wives, was at the height of his fame in Eldorado and Gwyneth was Rodney's wife Cassandra in Only Fools And Horses. The pressure of him working away in Spain was said to put a strain on their relationship.\n\nBut, like a storyline straight out of a soap, romance blossomed again for the couple.\n\nThey don't like to talk too much about their marriage, but Gwyneth now says: \"When we separated, we stayed good friends and were in constant contact because of the children.\n\n\"Then we got back together and married eight years ago.\n\n\"We met when Jesse was 19, so we've been together for a long time. We know that relationships need work.\"\n\nNow their children are grown-up - Oscar is 20 and Lottie is 17 - Gwyneth is fulfilling a long-held ambition by embarking on her first theatre tour, which is also her first musical.\n\nThe award-winning Our House, based on the music of Madness, kicks off its first UK tour at the Birmingham Rep from June 3.\n\nGwyneth, 48, will be on the road until December. She says: \"I always said to my husband that when the kids were grown up, I would go on tour. He said 'This is it, they're grown-up now'.\n\n\"If they can't cope without me now, they never will!\" With actors as parents, it wouldn't be surprising if Oscar and Lottie followed in their footsteps, but Gwyneth is delighted they haven't.\n\n\"We've done a very good job at convincing them that acting isn't an ideal profession,\" she says. \"They've seen the reality of how insecure our jobs are and fortunately they've never shown any interest in acting.\n\nIt's not the first profession a mother wants for her children.\n\n\"My daughter is into football and has been over in America on a soccer scholarship.\"\n\nGwyneth also plays a devoted mum in Our House, but feels less at home in a musical.\n\n\"My first thought when they suggested the role was 'Do they know I can't sing?'\" she says.\n\n\"Thankfully I don't really have to, it's more speak singing. I've left the singing to the professionals, which really is for the best. But I am loving being in a musical.\"\n\nThe question Gwyneth gets asked all the time by fans is whether Only Fools And Horses will ever return?\n\n\"I would say no, but I just don't know,\" she says. \"I can't say it's definitely finished, because I thought that before and it came back!\"\n\n[email protected]\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nGOING STRONG: Gwyneth and husband Jesse Birdsall"
