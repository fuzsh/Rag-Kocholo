        "text": "“Que haces el Jueves?” Azriel asks, but Gwyn doesn’t look up. She’s on a timed game on Duolingo. And it’s hard to hear him, anyway, over the construction outside.\n\nHe waits a moment, longer than most alphas would, before he asks again, more firmly, “Tienes algo el Jueves?”\n\nShe’s won sixty-five XP. An improvement from yesterday. “Voy a ir al ballet,” she says as she looks up.\n\nIt’s only when she sees the dark humor on Azriel’s face that Gwyn realizes he’d asked her in Spanish. They have a tendency to talk about clients in Spanish when they think they won’t understand, her and Emerie, and sometimes the whole tattoo parlor is filled with their liquid vowels and rolled r’s.\n\n“You speak Spanish,” she says weakly, her cheeks burning. Across the floor, Emerie glances up, tattoo gun in hand.\n\n“Enough.” Azriel leans one forearm onto her desk. It makes the muscles in his arms bulge. “Are you free, though?”\n\nIn English, she says, “I’m going to the ballet on Thursday. With Emerie.”\n\nHis hazel eyes are disconcerting. She’s read about war before, about a look men recently back from combat would have in their eyes. Hunted, haunted looks. Even when he smiles, like he’s doing now, there’s something altogether unhappy in his expression. “Which ballet?”\n\nShe smiles back, wondering if he can see her amorphous past written in her gaze, too. “Something modern, you’ve never heard of it.”\n\nAt this, something relaxes in Azriel’s face, and it loses that edge from before. “Try me.”\n\n“It’s just that you seem like a Swan Lake man,” she says. It’s mostly not an insult.\n\n“I saw Glass Pieces last year.”\n\nThat’s a more recent ballet than the one on Thursday, to be sure. “That’s got some nice music.”\n\nNesta would kill her. Nice music, to describe Philip Glass!\n\nAzriel hums, and silence falls between them. The construction has ended for the day, it seems; the workers are shouting at one another about something. It’s only half past five. There are still three and a half more hours of Gwyn’s shift.\n\n“Are you free…Friday?” He asks it in Spanish again, and there’s something so charmingly try-hard in it that makes Gwyn cave.\n\n“Why?” she asks, tilting her head. It exposes her throat, the scent glands there. Alphas like that sort of thing, even from betas. “Were you going to take me to the ballet?”\n\nAzriel’s beautiful white teeth flash in a smile. They’re looking a bit pointy, and he has a faint lisp when he says, “More interested in what happens after the ballet.”\n\nGwyn’s heart begins to pound.\n\nThere are rules, unspoken ones mostly, about how people should act. Alphas hold open doors; they are the best leaders and businesspeople. Omegas get the choicest bit of food at any meal, and they smell like Christmas or chicken noodle soup or whatever makes you feel like you’ve come home. Betas, like Gwyn, are kind and easily led, ready to help when an alpha needs them.\n\nAnd, in his strange way, Azriel does need her.\n\nShe clears her throat. “What time?”\n\nHis eyes slide away, to the lucky cat a customer had given them ages ago. He pokes at its waving paw, and its tail wags in time. “I’ll make you dinner. How’s seven sound?”\n\n“That’s late,” she says with a waggle of her eyebrows, even though she regularly eats dinner after nine. Her mother had always said that only poor people ate before six-thirty, and Gwyn, by this metric, must be a fucking millionaire.\n\n“I’ll pick you up.”\n\n“I’ll get there myself,” she replies sweetly. “I like salmon.”\n\nEmerie’s client is making elated noises over her new tattoo, and Azriel straightens. “Salmon, at seven on Friday, then.”\n\nAnd he leaves, just like that, like an extra in a movie after delivering his two lines. He hadn’t even tried to make an appointment. She watches him go, the wind pulling at his hair. He’s got nice shoulders. That’s what Emerie had said, the first time Azriel had come in.\n\nTattoo cover-up, it had been. A woman’s name, now covered with sweeping bands of black that trailed over his shoulders like a lover’s hand.\n\nGwyn rings out the girl with the new tattoo – an insanely cute, rainbow-colored ode to her pet chameleon, Felix – and turns to find Emerie beside her desk with a meaningful look on her face, cigarette pack in hand.\n\nWith a sigh, Gwyn puts the Be Right Back sign on the door before locking it to follow Emerie out into the alley. It’s gross outside; humid and petulant in a way that only Boston in late spring can be. There’s empty bottles of beer to keep them company.\n\n“Que queria?” Emerie asks. Her words escape with the smoke, and Gwyn imagines maybe that’s how praying works, words curling into the sky on updrafts of tepid wind. “Gwyn.”\n\n“He asked me if I was free Thursday.” Emerie purses her lips in disapproval before Gwyn hastily adds, “I told him we were going to the ballet.”\n\n“You didn’t invite him.” It’s not a question. Emerie’s not mean, exactly, but she doesn’t like many people, especially men. Especially alphas.\n\n“Claro que no. I told him he looked like he liked Swan Lake.”\n\nEmerie laughs, and it echoes around them, ricocheting off the brick walls. “Did he tell you he prefers The Nutcracker?”\n\nIt’s Gwyn’s turn to laugh. It had been Cassian’s opening salvo to Nesta when she said she danced professionally: I think The Nutcracker is the perfect ballet.\n\nThe Nutcracker is a beautiful ballet, Gwyn has to admit, but Nesta’s tastes have always run towards newer, avant-garde works. And anyway, it was June when he told her that, which had added to the mess.\n\nGwyn eyes a wad of what looks to be freshly-used toilet paper on the opposite side of the alley. Someone’s laundry floats on a line stretched between the buildings, and it covers Emerie’s face with strange, fleeting shadows. “Pero I said I’d go to dinner Friday.”\n\nEmerie says nothing at first, only takes another drag of her cigarette. “Is he going to ask you to…do some of that stuff again?”\n\nStuff: such a wonderful word, so all-encompassing and so vague. It could mean those quick long-toothed smiles. It could mean silk sheets on bare skin. It could mean sweet kisses, too: just here, and there, perhaps lower.\n\nBut she knows what Emerie means, and it makes her flush to think about. “Yes, I – I think so.”\n\nIt always feels like this when they talk about sex. How pedestrian, to be just shy of thirty and still blushing like a swooning girl fresh into the big city from the prairies. Maybe she’ll always feel this way, and she’ll be seventy-five, trying to explain the finer points of using candle wax during sex to her friends at the old folks’ home.\n\nAzriel doesn’t like candle wax, anyway. That was another of his tattoos – bright, lumpy flowers that twined over his burned hands. It had looked so painful, but Gwyn has never asked about them.\n\n“Where is he taking you for dinner?” They have a list, the three of them: places to go with men, places to go with alphas, places to go for maximum impact if they need to scream.\n\n“He’s making dinner at his place. Salmon.”\n\nEmerie narrows her eyes. An alpha’s apartment ranks quite low on their metrics for safe places. But Gwyn has been there before, and nothing had gone wrong. He hadn’t even had a freaky little sex dungeon like Nesta had suggested he might. “Fish wouldn’t be my first choice before sex.”\n\n“It’s full of fatty omega threes,” Gwyn supplies helpfully. “Google told me so.”\n\nEmerie drops her cigarette onto the uneven bricks and grinds it beneath her heel. “Bueno, si Google te lo dijo.”\n\nBut there’s a smile in her eyes, one that’s not worried, as Gwyn follows her friend back into the shop.\n\nThey call themselves the Dead Mom Club. It was a very unofficial thing, of course – no dues, no monthly meetings, no real qualifications to join except that you had to, at the very least, have a dead mother. Nesta had been an ally rather than a member until her mother had died two years ago.\n\nShe hadn’t been particularly motherly, though Gwyn would never say that to Nesta.\n\nThe three of them had met as teenagers in the Boston Ballet School. Nesta came from old, stuffy money in Beacon Hill; she told stories of meeting Yo-Yo Ma on the street outside Symphony Hall, how he greeted her mother by name. Emerie hailed from East Boston, one of the few non-white ballerinas in their cohort. She had practiced her frappes to the accompaniment of roaring plane engines from the nearby airport.\n\nGwyn, though, had grown up on the outskirts of Independence, Missouri, just as the countryside transitioned from eye-blurring flatness to pleasant rolling hills. Her ballet studio was barely air conditioned, and no one believed her when she said her mother was Mexican. With fair skin prone to sunburn and freckles and a head full of thick, red hair, she looked far more her father’s daughter than her mother’s.\n\nIt had been nice when they thought she was white. Less awful things said accidentally on purpose when she could hear them.\n\nBut she had shown them all up, anyway, winning a spot at the Boston Ballet School as a scrawny thing with dreams unfettered by reality. Boston was a strange place, full of meandering roads and too much car noise.\n\nThere was a skyline, though, which Independence didn’t have. And a whole ocean, waiting for Gwyn’s little face to smile on it.\n\nEmerie’s mother had died when she was little, so maybe she’s the founding member of their club. There’s a picture of Emerie’s mother in her locker, a real glamor shot, with her coy eyes peering over one shoulder in black and white. They look so alike they could be sisters.\n\nGwyn’s initiation happened when her mother and sister died in a car accident while she was gallivanting about Boston. Her laughter was free because she was sixteen and away from home for the first time, and her family was mangled nearly beyond identification a thousand miles from her.\n\nThe cop who had broken the news to her was an old family friend, an alpha with a condescending voice that cracked when he said her name. Emerie and Nesta were her roommates, and they had held her tightly. They even skipped classes to hold her hand as she walked to the dean’s office.\n\n“Do you want to take a leave of absence?” Dean Thistlewaite had asked, peering at Gwyn over her glasses. She was also a beta, as most female ballerinas are, and her voice had been so kind. Perhaps she belonged to the Dead Mom Club, too. “Do you have family in the area?”\n\nNo and no, Gwyn had answered. Her dad had disappeared shortly after Gwyn and her sister had been born, and Gwyn had never met her mother’s family except very brief international phone calls. The only people she knew – who knew her, inside and out – were the two girls waiting anxiously outside the dean’s office.\n\nIn the end, that hadn’t been what chased her out of ballet. It hadn’t been injury, either – well, not an injury the admin cared about. At least if she had torn her ACL, someone would have patted her hand and made noises about paying for PT and planning her triumphant return to the stage. That would’ve been simple. It’s very complicated to take classes with a man who raped you, though.\n\nShe doesn’t remember his face well, even though he’s a Big Name and Very Established in the ballet school and the ballet world as a whole. Gwyn, by contrast, is the daughter of some Mexican lady who doesn’t dance and an absentee father, and besides, there are eighteen girls who look just like her and don’t make up such vicious lies.\n\nThat’s what the dean had said, the same one who had so tenderly asked her five years before if she needed time away to grieve her family.\n\nEmerie left around the same time, too, for different though no less heartbreaking reasons. It’s hard enough to dye your pointe shoes from rosy pink to something darker, harder still when the school caps your pointe shoe allowance “to avoid you abusing the privilege.”\n\nNo one else had a cap on how many pointe shoes they could use in a week; the prima ballerinas sometimes went through two a night. But then, no one else had Emerie’s gleaming, dark brown skin, either.\n\nIt was an ugly year.\n\nBut it’s in the past – not ancient, not forgotten, but bandaged and occasionally ignored – though Gwyn can’t quite bring herself to forgive the dean. She has some empathy for the awkward position a beta could be put in by an alpha run amok, but if it had been her, she thinks she’d have quit rather than tell some girl she shouldn’t have let her scent glands show at a party.\n\n(It hadn’t been a party. It had been after class on a sunny Tuesday, when Nesta was in the next room, sweating through petite allegro while Gwyn cried silently.)\n\nStepping into the theater had been hard that first time as a civilian. Her feet splay outwards like every ballerina’s, but she was on the wrong side of the curtain. It felt a lot like an ex parading a new girlfriend in front of her.\n\nWhat was she supposed to do, though? Sit at home and imagine the heat of the stage lights while fearing she’d throw up the moment she saw That Man onstage? Forget all about the craft and beauty of the thing she loved even when it didn’t love her back? And anyway, Nesta wanted her there.\n\nShe didn’t want to be scared anymore, though her body hadn’t gotten the message.\n\nBut this show on Thursday promises no jump scares, at least. That Man is on sabbatical for six months to heal from a stress fracture in his ankle. She wasn’t aware that three girls’ rape accusations could cause a stress fracture, but these alphas, you know. The weight of the world on their precious shoulders, so fragile despite being so strong.\n\nEmerie slides into the seat next to her just as the lights dim after intermission. She smells of nicotine and peony perfume. It should be gross, but it just makes Gwyn want to curl up in Emerie’s lap and sigh with contentment. They’re just friends, though they had tried it once, just to see.\n\nThere is a speech – That Man makes a verbal appearance, because apparently everyone is very sad he’s not here, which makes Gwyn laugh quietly – and then the lights dim further.\n\nGwyn leans forward in her seat. She’d first seen clips of it in the weeks after her mother and sister’s deaths, and something about it reached inside her to hold her up. She hasn’t seen this ballet live before, and she doesn’t want to miss a moment.\n\nIt opens with an icy white spotlight covering all the stage. Angular, percussive music begins, but there is no motion onstage. Then two dancers step from the shadows, matching in black tights and dark teal leotards, and saunter to center stage.\n\nThere’s something delightfully androgynous about this ballet, no matter which production Gwyn has watched. Alpha, beta, omega, it all disappears into this duet between two bodies who move as if it’s only chance that’s brought them to this stage at the same time, even as they twine together. Each movement takes so much control and care to appear so uninterested. It makes Gwyn burn with envy.\n\nNesta’s hair whips across her face with each decisive turn of her head. It must be a wig, because she’d left the apartment that morning with her hair done up tidily in a bun like normal. Her legs are impossibly long; Gwyn knows every inch of them to a degree that would make Cassian jealous.\n\nBeside her, Emerie sighs happily.\n\nShe, like Gwyn, is interested in bodies, no matter their size or shape or gender, whether they’re meant for ballet or not. It’s hard to describe the strange intersection of pansexuality and body criticality wrapped up in Gwyn’s mind. You know more than you want to about your friends; you want to know more, anyway.\n\nThe piece ends to thunderous applause. Even though she knows it’s classless and gauche, Gwyn lets out a raucous whoop when Nesta bows.\n\n“God, she’s insane,” Emerie says into Gwyn’s ear as the lights come up and patrons get to their feet. She says it fondly, though. “As if it’s easy to just keep that arabesque – who does she think she is?”\n\nAnd that’s the thing about ballet, what makes it hard, what makes it memorable: that moment when a lesser mortal would collapse, but you’re holding on, holding, holding, until you release only as if you’re bored and not from necessity. That delicious tension before the plunge makes Gwyn breathless every time.\n\nThe temptation to go backstage is strong, especially because That Man is away. But Gwyn doesn’t think she could stand the recognition in people’s faces when they see her. She doesn’t need their pity.\n\nInstead, she waits in the alley by the rear stage door, her breath just slightly clouding in front of her in the unseasonable mid-May chill. She’ll miss it soon enough, when Boston returns to its swampy self. Emerie smokes next to her as dancers file out in bursts of chatter and pleased laughter. No one looks at either of them.\n\nAt last, Nesta emerges, a victorious smile on her mouth. Her hair during the performance had been a wig, just like Gwyn thought, and her natural hair cascades over her shoulders in waves. The bouquet she carries is crushed between them when Gwyn hugs her tightly.\n\n“I’m so glad you came,” Nesta says. Her stage makeup looks ridiculous in the weak streetlight. “God, that was so much fun.”\n\n“It looked like it,” Gwyn says. “I saw that smile you gave Eris, you wicked thing.”\n\nThere had been a moment when Nesta had glanced slowly, desultorily, over one shoulder, before a quicksilver grin had spread over her face. It’s uncommon for a ballerina to be an alpha, but there was no denying Nesta was an alpha in that moment, sizing up her prey.\n\nNesta shrugs, her hair slipping over her shoulder and says as she hugs Emerie, “I was caught up in the moment.”\n\nThat burning envy catches in Gwyn’s chest again. She wants to be caught up in a moment, any moment, that makes her feel half as alive as being onstage had. A mean, bitter part of her snarls that Nesta can be caught up in any moment she likes because she’s an alpha. Alphas are always believed.\n\nGwyn smiles as she shoves that thought very, very far down, and loops her arm through Nesta’s as the three of them walk towards the train station.\n\nThe choice to leave ballet had been made, and she wants to learn to live with it. It wasn’t her choice – would never have been her choice, really – but the ballet community in Boston has cut off any route for her to return to the stage. She’s a problem, that Gwyneth, running her mouth.\n\nThe creaky studio floors, splashed with sunlight; the windows in the break room that always got stuck halfway up as they revealed a small stretch of impossible blue sky, just waiting for her to look at it…well, those things are still there. In her memories, in the building, doesn’t matter.\n\nThey sway together on the train as it shrieks around the curves past Boylston Station. Since it’s a Thursday night, not quite baseball season yet, their fellow passengers are mostly quiet, only a couple drunks at the far end of the train car.\n\n“I wish I could come again tomorrow,” Gwyn says.\n\n“I’ll sneak you in, it’s not hard,” Nesta returns loftily, and a wisp of her hair gets into Gwyn’s mouth.\n\nEmerie laughs. “Gwyn has plans.”\n\nShe feels the flush creep over her cheeks when Nesta whips her head back towards her. “Is it someone new?”\n\n“It’s Azriel,” Gwyn says. “Again.”\n\nNesta eyes her speculatively for a moment before scoffing quietly. But she doesn’t say anything, and isn’t that a moment of real personal growth for her. That woman’s name on Azriel’s shoulder had been Nesta’s sister’s name, after all. It hadn’t ended particularly well. Very suddenly, too, if Gwyn remembers right.\n\nShe wonders, not for the first time, if Azriel had asked Elain to do what he asks Gwyn to do.\n\nAffecting nonchalance, Gwyn eases back in her seat. “I need to work off some tension, anyway.”\n\nNesta’s face creases in concern, and Gwyn curses herself for her careless words. “Did something happen? With – Him?”\n\nThe capital h is audible, as it always is.\n\n“I just…I miss ballet, Nesta.” The words are offered into the astringent light of the train, too honest by far. But it’s true. She misses control, she misses being in control.\n\nTheir conversation dies off abruptly in the wake of her honesty.\n\nThis moment isn’t supposed to be about Gwyn. It’s supposed to be about Nesta and her impossible legs and her high-arched feet and the way she’d looked so perfect onstage.\n\n“Sorry,” Gwyn offers quietly, but that only makes their silence heavier, more pitiful. It lasts until they reach their apartment by Symphony Hall.\n\nEmerie’s key clicks in the lock, and Nesta turns to Gwyn. “He’s gonna suffer, you know. They can’t deny what he’s done.”\n\nNo capital h this time. Gwyn’s mouth twists to one side. “I’ll believe it when I see it.”\n\nIt’s easy to be brave when she’s only Gwyn, receptionist at a hoity-toity tattoo parlor a stone’s throw from Fenway Park. That Gwyn doesn’t have history, unless you count her four hundred day Duolingo streak in Korean.\n\nIt’s harder when she comes home, to the same apartment she lived in when it happened. Every step she takes pushes her history into the spaces between the floorboards.\n\nNesta gives her a bone-cracking hug. She’s usually not the optimistic one, but she says stoutly, “Things are gonna change, Gwyn.”\n\nEmerie gives her a quick once-over and says in a stern voice, “Mañana me cuentas todo.”\n\nIt’s a kind threat, at least. Something else to look forward to on her busy Friday.\n\nThe clock on the living room wall ticks steadily into the next day, until the other two have closed their doors and the thin line of light beneath their doors goes out. Now it’s only Gwyn and the low hum of the refrigerator left awake.\n\nShe thinks about texting Azriel, moving up their appointment. More than that, though, she thinks about the unheard voicemail on her phone from a ballet school number.\n\nShe clicks on the offending voicemail and holds the phone to her ear.\n\n“Gwyneth, hi! This is Dean Thistlewaite from Boston Ballet calling. I want you to know that – well, things have progressed recently, and I remembered your story from a few years ago. About Mr. Atlas. I always believed that your accusation was credible, and we at the Boston Ballet - ”\n\nShe hits delete, and Thistlewaite’s voice disappears into the ether.\n\nAlways believed. Always believed.\n\nGwyn is a beta, and as such, was raised to behave a certain way. Be gentle, be kind – believe people when they say sorry.\n\nShe wants to believe the dean. She wants to believe she had misunderstood That Man’s motives, his actions. Hard to misunderstand a penis, though.\n\nShe taps her phone against her lips as the clock ticks further into the new day, and doesn’t fall asleep until sunlight is just peeking through the window.\n\nEmerie wakes her much too soon. “Levantante.”\n\nGwyn’s bleary eyes pick out the time on the cable box, despite the shaft of insistent sunlight cutting across the room. It’s past eight; she had only managed to doze for about an hour and a half.\n\n“You slept here last night?” Emerie asks softly.\n\nGwyn sits up, grinding her knuckles into her eyes to clear them. This is exactly what she didn’t want: another opening that would invite pity or worry when she simply wants to work through everything on her own. At least for a little while. “I didn’t mean to.”\n\nEmerie sits on the couch, and it makes Gwyn roll towards her. She doesn’t stop herself, though, and winds up in an awkward hug, her nose pressed against Emerie’s collarbone.\n\nShe knows better than to hope for silence, and Emerie asks slowly, “Did something happen?”\n\nAgainst the curl of tattooed ivy on Emerie’s collarbone, Gwyn says, “Thistlewaite called. She believes me. Apparently I’ve been credible this whole time.”\n\nDisgust rolls off Emerie in waves, but she doesn’t respond, only pulls Gwyn tighter to her, despite the awkward angle.\n\nAdversity makes you stronger, they say, but Gwyn would settle for a weaker, happier life in the background as some nameless swan to Nesta’s Odette, a life full of ballet instead of half-assed stretches in the living room while watching Hyunjin fancams on TikTok.\n\nBut adversity has, at the very least, showed her that not all soulmates are romantic. Sometimes they are friends with crooked teeth and kind eyes and vicious senses of humor.\n\nEventually, Emerie lets go of her to plant a wet, exaggerated kiss on her forehead. “Go get dressed, I’ll make you a smoothie.”\n\nPutting make-up on has always felt like preparing for war. A war against her own nerves, a war against disappearing into a wash of bright stage lights. Today’s war, however, is against the gnawing ache in her chest that Thistlewaite’s call had put there.\n\nGreen had always been Catrin’s color, and Gwyn still lets her have it, even though the only green her sister sees anymore are the roots of the grass above her grave. Instead, she puts on a dress in pale blue, a little too see-through to be professional, and curls her hair just so. Her eyeliner is black and sharp; she blots her blood red lipstick on a Kleenex.\n\nShe looks much the same as she always has. She could maybe even still pass for sixteen. Somehow, that makes everything hurt more.\n\nBut Gwyn has never been prone to wallowing in her grief, for better or worse, and she’s back to smiling and laughing when she and Emerie get off at Kenmore. The lights in the tattoo parlor flick on, peachy and gentle despite the sharp edges of the trendy furniture. Gwyn settles her purse beneath her desk with a clatter and blows a kiss to the photo she’d clipped up of her family: Katrin, in green, of course; her mother, in yellow; and Gwyn, mostly missing from the selfie, in eye-watering neon florals.\n\nShe invested some of the money from her mother’s life insurance policy after she and Emerie had left the ballet. The rent on this place is kind of a nightmare, but it is a place both of them consider theirs, and, better yet, there are no Big Men to loom over them.\n\nTwo hours after they open, Azriel texts. Still on for tonight?\n\nAfter a moment, she texts back, I’ve changed my mind about salmon. She sends him a recipe for a dish her mother used to make whenever Gwyn was able to make the long trip back to Missouri. Don’t skimp on the spice.\n\nI’m not eating that much spice before sex, he texts back, and she can hear the dry humor of his voice.\n\n“De que te ríes?” Emerie calls over in Spanish. They’re alone in the studio for a few more minutes.\n\n“Azriel le tiene miedo a lo picante,” she calls back, and Emerie laughs before returning her attention to her needles.\n\nPrep first, have it cook while we mess around, she types. Thought computer engineering attracted problem-solving brains?\n\nThree dots appear, then fade. They appear again, only to disappear once more.\n\nGwyn wonders if he’s laughing, if he’s offended, if he’s trying to find a gentlemanly way to let her down.\n\nI’ll prep dinner if you’ll prep me, he finally texts back.\n\nArousal courses through her in a near-painful wave. In Boston, there is less uproar over same sex couples, but there is still an undercurrent of dim horror whenever alphas renege on their status or when betas become too uppity. What he wants is wrong, deviant. Exciting.\n\nThe edges of her phone case dig into her palm as she imagines Azriel – all six feet and three inches of him, his brown skin covered in flowing tattoos – spread on the bed before her. His knees will be splayed to show her that small pucker of skin behind his balls, and she’ll plant her mouth on the inside of his thigh, right where his femoral artery is -\n\n“Girl.”\n\nEmerie’s voice echoes through the studio, and Gwyn flushes, this time from deep-set embarrassment.\n\n“Just thinking,” she offers weakly. She should act better than this, especially at work. “I’ll spray before your next appointment.”\n\n“What are you thinking about?” Emerie asks, a gleam in her eyes.\n\nGwyn debates what to say for a moment before simply holding out her phone. Emerie’s eyebrows lift as she reads, and Gwyn wants to squirm.\n\n“I read a book like this,” Emerie says as she hands back Gwyn’s phone, and Gwyn rolls her eyes. Of course she has. Gwyn has read the same one. “It was…good.”\n\nGood, of course, can encompass a lot of things – dense plot, gripping characters, erotica so potent it is impossible to read on public transport. A book about a book, y que no se que.\n\nGwyn clears her throat as she tries to shove her embarrassment deep down inside herself. “It’s very good. Clearly.”\n\n“Will you be leaving work early?” Emerie asks, her words accompanied by an impressively quick waggle of her eyebrows.\n\nPutting as much dignity into her voice as she can manage, Gwyn says, “Yes.”\n\nGwyn isn’t even that necessary to the tattoo shop, despite her money funding the initial start-up costs; Emerie could probably manage just as well without her. But it’s nice – it’s wonderful, actually - to be part of this, especially because Emerie imbues awkward sideways hugs with more feeling than anyone else in the world.\n\nIt isn’t until Emerie’s 12:30 shows that Gwyn pulls out her phone again. Azriel’s words are still there, waiting for her to read them and imagine again.\n\nQuite rude to leave the poor alpha waiting for so long. But then, that’s what he seems to want from her.\n\nSee you soon, she texts back.\n\nAzriel, as befits someone ambiguously involved in finance, lives in Seaport. The Atlantic pushes curiously at the beach just a stone’s throw from his building; in past winters, the water has started to spill over the seawall and into Seaport’s streets. It had flooded the basement of Azriel’s apartment building the year before she met him, damaging the building’s many Lexuses, Bentleys, and Maseratis.\n\nIt feels, Gwyn thinks, like justice, even though she likes Azriel well enough.\n\nShe dials his number in the call box just outside the building, and a moment later, the door buzzes to let her in. She laughs to herself at his speed; he must have been waiting by the buzzer.\n\nEvery line inside the building is smooth and sleek, chrome and white lines funneling her towards the bank of elevators. Azriel’s apartment is on the tenth floor, which, the first time she’d come over, she’d been strangely awed by how high up it was. But, it turned out, the apartments didn’t even really begin until the fourth floor, so he was more technically on the sixth floor.\n\nIt doesn’t matter, but sometimes finance bros need to be taken down a peg.\n\nHis door is a nondescript, black one with the number 702 on it. Some of his neighbors must be Asian, because there is still a red, diamond-shaped Lunar New Year decoration hanging off of 704’s door, despite it being mid-May. Azriel has never decorated his door, not that she’s ever seen, anyway.\n\nShe knocks twice. There is a studied beat or two of silence before Azriel opens the door. He was definitely standing there waiting, but she finds it terribly charming that he waited two extra seconds.\n\n“Hey,” he says. He looks a bit rumpled, as though he’s just woken from a nap. His voice is a little throaty too.\n\nHe smiles a little when she stutters out, “Hi.”\n\nThe door swings open wider in invitation, and she steps past him. The apartment smells like sandalwood and Azriel’s own scent, musky and heavy. It had frightened her that very first time. She’d gotten so used to soft, feminine scents that stepping into an alpha’s apartment that wasn’t Nesta’s was like diving headfirst into cold water.\n\nNow, though, it makes her heat up from the inside out.\n\nShe swipes her hair back once she reaches his living room, where a cream-colored sectional couch and a shaggy pale lilac rug greet her, and fishes in her purse for a clip. It exposes the scent glands there.\n\nHe steps in close, not quite touching her, except for his lips on her shoulder, near enough to her glands that it’s maddening. It would undo her if he put his mouth there, despite her best attempts to pretend otherwise.\n\n“How do I smell?” she murmurs, and Azriel inhales.\n\n“I like your perfume,” he says thoughtfully, and the words fan out over her skin. “It’s a different one than when I saw you earlier.”\n\nIt isn’t, but she appreciates him trying to tell the difference between her perfumes. “Touch me.”\n\nLips still pressed to her skin, he smooths one of his hands down the curve of her hips. She can feel him smile when he reaches the hem, much too high to be professional. It goes even higher as he slowly pushes his hand beneath it, and the warmth of his palm chases away the chill she’d worked up in such a scanty dress.\n\n“You like blue,” he says. “You’ve worn it every time I’ve seen you.”\n\n“I don’t wear it for you,” she says, and it’s true, but Azriel groans softly against her neck anyway. He’s already hard against the small of her back.\n\nShe turns, and Azriel, cheeky thing, pushes the hem of her skirt up over her hips as she goes. It reveals her underwear, which is also blue, and she can’t help grinning as she plants a hand on his shoulder.\n\nHe kneels without complaint, though she can see his eye teeth poking out just past his lips as they grow longer. Fangs come part and parcel with being an alpha, and Gwyn has always thought the ensuing lisp was adorable.\n\nAzriel presses his mouth to the inside of her thigh, right where she had daydreamed about earlier.\n\nA shiver works its way through her, and she steps back, tugging her hem down as she goes. He stays where he is. His throat bobs as he swallows.\n\nTalking about sex – its sounds and smells, the things that make her want so intensely she feels like she could ignite – is difficult. But the act of doing it has never really felt that way. In the end, it’s like ballet. It’s just bodies moving with one another.\n\nShe reaches the couch. Perched on the arm rest, she crosses her legs at the knee. Azriel’s hands clench, and she says, “Relax, cariño.”\n\nAzriel reacts instantly: his teeth shrink back into his mouth, his hands unclench, and he shows her his throat. She can’t pull her eyes away from the glands revealed there.\n\nShe waits, just to see what he’ll do.\n\nHe breaks after only a few moments. The poor thing isn’t used to waiting, and he’s not used to pretending to be good at it, either. “Do you want me to get on the couch?”\n\nIt would be nice to see a man crawl today, but she says, “Do you want to ruin your couch?”\n\nAzriel eyes it speculatively, like he’s actually considering it. He’d be able to replace it much easier than Gwyn would ever be able to. After a moment, he sits back on his heels. “I’d rather not.”\n\nOne step closer to that pretty image of Azriel on his back, splayed before her. “Then get in bed.”\n\nHis teeth are long again when he murmurs, “Yes, alpha.”\n\nShe closes her eyes as he stands and makes his way into the bedroom. It feels impossible to get used to someone else calling her that, and saying it with such deference, too. It makes her flush; it makes her want to cry.\n\nWhen she opens her eyes, she can just barely see into the bedroom. He’s shirtless now, and as she watches, he pulls his pants and underwear down. It reveals her favorite part of him: his soft lower belly, so at odds with the sculpted shoulders and chest. It quivers when she fucks him just so, shudders when he’s breathless and his pupils blown wide.\n\nHe glances over his shoulder at her. There’s nothing coy in the gesture, but it pulls her to her feet like a marionette. Elain’s name is on his left shoulder blade, covered up now by Emerie’s sure hand.\n\nHis past, like Gwyn’s, doesn’t really have a place here, or maybe the past takes up too much space to see clearly. She doesn’t want to look at it, anyway, as she steps into the room.\n\nIt smells so much like him, despite the underwhelming amount of visible personal effects in the room. There is a picture of Azriel and his brothers in a frame that’s just a little too big for it perched on his dresser; his Rolex is lovingly stowed in its box on one of the bedside tables. His sheets are a soothing sage green, all the better to highlight Azriel, sitting on his knees in the middle of the bed.\n\nShe traces the thin line of hair leading from Azriel’s belly button down to his cock with a nail. The muscles jump beneath her touch, even though Azriel seems to be holding his breath.\n\n“Do you want me to fuck you?” she asks quietly. That fine trail of hair prickles her finger as she drags it back up against the grain. “Or do you want something else?”\n\nHe kisses her without answering. His hands are still resting on his thighs.\n\nShe fists her own hand in the back of his hair just as she reaches down for his cock with the other. The gasp he releases into her mouth makes her want to bite him right on his glands, even though it’s not her place and she hasn’t got the teeth for it. He gasps again when she tightens her grip on his hair.\n\nHe still hasn’t answered her question, though that’s an answer in and of itself. She lets go of him all at once, and he follows her with a dazed look on his face. He’s reaching out for her, and she thinks about taking his hand in hers, putting his fingers in his mouth.\n\nShe reaches out for him, too, planting her hand on his chest and pushing him back on his beautiful green comforter. He bounces stiffly once, twice, before he seems to force himself into relaxation. His teeth are long again, and she says, “Put those away.”\n\nWith what looks like a lot of effort, mouth contorting, Azriel’s fangs shrink until they’re normal again. She leans over him to double check, one finger lazily pulling his cheek to the side. His chest works as if he’s been running. He doesn’t move, even when Gwyn pulls at his tongue.\n\n“Don’t do that again,” she says.\n\n“Yes, alpha.” The words are slightly garbled around her fingers, still in his mouth.\n\nThis bed is truly enormous, and she pauses for a moment on her knees, just past the crown of Azriel’s head. He has to tip his chin back to see her properly. His dark cheeks are flushed, but his teeth still seem dull.\n\nShe reaches out for Azriel’s hand that rests on his belly and guides it to the hem of her skirt. He pushes it up, just like he had done in the living room. He has to stretch to get it high enough, and the mattress bows inward as he presses his head into it for leverage.\n\nHis fingers ghost over the crotch of her panties.\n\n“Pull them aside,” she murmurs. He makes it so easy to feel at home in her body, borrowed as it may seem sometimes.\n\nHe does, with a surprising tenderness. For a moment, he stares at her cunt before he looks back up her. His eyes seem to burn her where they touch.\n\nWhen she arranges herself over his face, his breath shudders over her. He’s still waiting for instruction, bless him. She lowers herself wordlessly, hissing when he licks once over the heat of her.\n\nShe still remembers the first time someone had done this for her. It had been some girl Gwyn had met at a club when they were all barely nineteen and parading around with some of the worst fake IDs the bouncer had probably seen. It had felt so shocking that someone would put their mouth there, that someone wanted the world to narrow to the salty taste of a woman’s cunt, the press of her legs on either side of their head.\n\nAzriel groans against her just as she catches her reflection in the mirror of Azriel’s closet doors. Her skin is pink, perfectly complementing the blue of her dress. She looks beautiful, she looks powerful, with a man’s legs stretched out in front of her.\n\n“Finger me,” she says, not looking away from herself in the mirror.\n\nHe spreads her first, and she thinks he presses a kiss to her folds before one of his fingers presses in. What wonderful fingers – he had apparently been a cellist in his earlier life, and they still have that control and strength.\n\nThey move slowly, with a slight curve on the way out, just the way Gwyn wants. More moan than speech, Gwyn says, “Good, Azriel.”\n\nHe adds another finger, and her gaze drops, landing on that soft part of his belly, and she smoothes a hand over it. Not too heavy, or she might accidentally suffocate the poor man. Worse ways to go, she supposes.\n\nIt must be torture, for her to be more concerned with his stomach than his cock, which stands to painful attention just past the reach of her fingertips. But she hasn’t said he can touch himself, hasn’t said he can move his fingers or tongue from her cunt.\n\nThe dismount from Azriel’s face is awkward and she misses the stretch of his fingers as she pulls off them, but at last she’s kneeling by his side, observing her handiwork. Azriel’s face is red, his mouth and nose glistening as he puts his fingers in his mouth.\n\nAnother flood of heat washes over her at the sight, especially when Azriel’s teeth poke out from between his lips again. He looks up at her over his fingers, and there’s such insolence, such casual possessiveness, in that expression.\n\nShe taps his cheek, and he obediently opens his mouth and releases his fingers despite his expression. “I told you to put those away.”\n\nThe words are met with a quiet snarl from Azriel, and without thinking, Gwyn spits in his face. It shocks him quiet, to have her spit trailing down his cheek and into his hairline.\n\nBetas don’t spit on alphas. They avert their eyes, they show their throats, they say yes sir no sir and do what their alpha tells them.\n\nGwyn says, “Don’t act like that, Azriel. I don’t like it.”\n\nHe nods jerkily until Gwyn pokes his cheek again. He says, “Yes, alpha.”\n\nIt’s quiet, but it’ll do.\n\nShe eases off the bed, and Azriel sits upright, that smug look slipping into something more worried, more adjacent to their real world personas. “Do you still want to fuck me?” he blurts.\n\nGwyn cocks her head to one side and observes him. Between her legs, she is uncomfortably wet. The change in his voice threatens to bring in the concerns outside this apartment, and just like she’d done with Nesta last night, she has to work to shove down the anger that boils up in her.\n\n“Lie down,” she says eventually, when she knows her voice will be calm, and Azriel does, looking marginally less worried.\n\nHe draws his legs up, fingers clawed over his kneecaps, and waits. No, she won’t fuck him, Gwyn decides as she removes the clip from her hair. Not the way he wants, anyway.\n\nThere is lube, she knows, in both bedside table drawers, and she opens the one closest to her. A moment later, she presses her open mouth to the inside of his thigh, just where she’d imagined earlier. Azriel breathes hard once through his nose as his knees fall open even wider.\n\nThey tremble when she licks up the shaft of his cock in one slow, desultory sweep. Gwyn glances up, and the cords of muscle in Azriel’s neck strain from the way he’s craning to watch her. His teeth are long again, and Gwyn makes a face.\n\n“Sorry,” he grunts, and the teeth disappear again. He makes a valiant attempt to look contrite, but she can still see the lines of faint irritation in his face at being denied for so long.\n\nShe circles Azriel’s hole before pressing the pad of her finger flat against it. Slowly, knowing he likes the way her hair falls over her shoulder in a coppery wave, she lowers her mouth and takes him as far back as she can at the same time she pushes the tip of her finger in.\n\nHis whole body shudders, but he doesn’t try to push farther into her mouth. He’s always quiet to start.\n\nGwyn has worked three fingers into him, moving them in slow counterpoint to her mouth, when Azriel says, voice strained, “Are you going to fuck me or not?”\n\nThere’s a faint lisp to his words, and she sighs as she pulls her mouth off him. Just as she though, his teeth are down again. “You can’t even keep your teeth in your mouth, Azriel. I don’t think you have enough control for me to fuck you.”\n\nIt’s an effort, more than it seemed before, but Gwyn waits patiently for them to go, her fingers still buried in his ass. When they’re gone, she moves them again, and his eyes snap shut. He has unfairly long eyelashes, and she admires them for a moment before lowering her head again.\n\nShe knows what he wants if he can’t have a cock in him: he wants to be hurt a bit; he wants her to move inside him as fast as she can until he shoots over the edge. He won’t want her to be gentle, and that’s why she decides to give him that, anyway.\n\nHer fingers move in him at that same slow pace.\n\n“Gwyn,” he says, a bit petulantly, and she laughs around him.\n\nShe knows to wait until the moment his hands begin to move. They never stay in one place long, as if he needs to touch every inch of himself but there’s no way to touch himself just the way he wants. One lands on the crown of her head, trembling and tender as it strokes back her hair.\n\nJust past her lips, the base of his cock begins to swell.\n\nAzriel is making sounds that could be generously called moans, little weak things that make Gwyn just as wet as when his mouth had been on her. She pulls off him with a gasp.\n\n“Fuck me,” Azriel commands, and his teeth are out again, but it’s tempered by the way he whispers, “Please, Gwyn.”\n\nJust like her body wants to bare her throat when Azriel stands too close, she wants more than anything to do what this alpha is asking her to do. And she knows it would feel good – she’s no omega, but her body would be able to accommodate his knot anyway.\n\nShe wraps the fingers of her free hand around his swelling knot in answer, and Azriel cranes upwards, his mouth in a disbelieving shape. One of his hands is still in her hair while the other props him up, and she says, her fingers still moving slowly in and out of him, “Come for me.”\n\nHis eyebrows draw up in the middle as his hand fists in the bedsheets, but he does as she says with a long, drawn out whine.\n\nCum spurts over his chest, over his nipples, even the dip of his collarbone. His cock jerks in her grasp, and she tightens her fingers in response.\n\nHe’s sweaty and messy and he smells like Gwyn.\n\nHe’s staring at her with his pained mouth and eyebrows as he comes and comes.\n\nGod, that expression makes her want things she shouldn’t. It could be like this every time; she knows he would let her. Or maybe not every time, she’d let him sink his teeth into her as long as he would let her stay in her apartment, as long as he’d pay her grocery bill like he did once a year ago.\n\nShe pulls her fingers out of him at last and uses both hands to squeeze his knot.\n\n“God,” Azriel chokes out. His supporting hand slides out from under him as he collapses back onto the bed, and Gwyn tries not to feel any disappointment when it means his other hand is gone too.\n\nIt’s another awkward dance to crawl on top of him when he begins to soften in her hands. She reaches for the base of his cock as she eases it into her. His knot has mostly faded, and he slips fully inside her.\n\nAzriel’s face is screwed up from the over-stimulation as his breath hisses out of him, but he opens his eyes when she plants a hand on his cum-covered chest. One hand weakly traces her thigh as she grinds on him.\n\nSince she’d left the ballet, this strange dance between her and Azriel has been the closest she’d felt to the exhaustion from a job well done, a craft well-executed. Maybe it’s the performance of it all; maybe she just misses working her body until it aches.\n\nShe doesn’t want to beg, doesn’t really want to tell him what she wants, but she reaches for that hand on her thigh and brings it in between her legs.\n\nHis thumb swipes across her clit once, twice. “Keep still,” she murmurs.\n\nIt must hurt him, at least a little bit, for her to be riding him like this after he’s already come. There’s something delicious in hurting him like that. He looks so tired beneath her.\n\nShe comes, bright and swift, with her teeth biting deep into her lower lip. Azriel groans quietly beneath her.\n\nHer breath escapes her in a juddering whoosh as she picks up the hand from Azriel’s chest. It’s covered in cum, half-dried in a tacky mess. It had been so sexy to touch it, to see him covered in his own mess, but now she wrinkles her nose.\n\nJust beyond her fingers, Azriel watches her through slitted eyes. “Something wrong?” he asks. His voice echoes through her; his thumb is still on her clit.\n\n“Sticky,” she says softly, and he laughs. That echoes through her, too.\n\nShe pulls herself off, and his cock flops onto his lower belly. He winces when she can’t stop herself from dragging her fingers over it. “Please don’t.”\n\nGuilt pinches at her, and she says, “I’ll clean you up.”\n\nThe towels in his en suite are a charcoal gray, stowed in a towel heater. Just like the other times, she stands there with the warm towel in her hands, staring down at it and wondering what it would be like to live like this.\n\nThose fantasies belong in the same untouchable place as a world where Gwyn still dances for Boston Ballet.\n\nShe pads back into his room. He hasn’t moved except to pillow both his hands behind his head, and he watches her approach. He does that a lot. She thinks it’s less predatory and more that he wants to make sure he knows where any blows might come from.\n\nAzriel hasn’t said much about his past, but there are those scars on his hands. There’s always something in a person’s past to run from.\n\nHe sighs as she runs the wet towel over him first. She cleans his chest, belly, and thighs, but then she continues on: over his tattooed knees and down to his ankles before tracing up each arm. She brushes his hair off his face and swipes gently at his cheeks.\n\nThere is something terrifyingly powerful about this moment, more than anything that came before. It is in his nature, his very physiology, to take care of her, but she is the one who is tender now. She is the one who can make him feel good.\n\nShe hands him the dry towel, and his face disappears in a whirl of gray fabric.\n\nThe towels in the ballet school’s bathrooms were white. Easy to clean when things got on them, like blood. Like semen.\n\n“What’s wrong?” Azriel asks softly, and Gwyn realizes she’s chewing her lip.\n\nShe doesn’t want to bring That Man into this room. He’s already insinuated himself into this act; the very fact that she wants what Azriel has just given her is proof of that. He doesn’t deserve any more space.\n\n“I’m hungry,” she finally says, standing from the bed and returning to the bathroom to clean herself up.\n\nAzriel moves around in the bedroom, and she hears the drawers of his dresser open and shut, the metallic scratch of hangers being worked over the rod. He will leave out clothes for her, she knows, things so soft she marvels that such a fabric could even exist. He will wear something equally soft, and the edges of him will seem frumpy outside of his usual clean-pressed clothes.\n\nShe doesn’t leave the bathroom until she hears him step into the hallway. A moment later, there is a soft clang of pots in the kitchen.\n\nIn the closet’s mirror doors, she sizes herself up. She had thought she looked so powerful an hour ago. Really, she’s just herself in a man’s too-big t-shirt. Sometimes she worries she’ll see the marks That Man left on her hips if she looks in the mirror too long, but that worry is frustratingly never enough to make her look away. This happens every time after she hooks up with Azriel, and she wishes she could scoop out the vicious thoughts in her head and drown them in the bath tub.\n\nShe cannot cry. Her mascara isn’t waterproof. She misses her mother with a ferocity that astounds her.\n\nGwyn looks away from the mirror at last and breathes in once, twice, watching her hands clench and unclench in Azriel’s towel. Soon, after a couple more breaths, she will go into the kitchen and eat the meal Azriel prepared for her. She will be normal. She will be alright.\n\nHis kitchen is beautiful, airy and chic with its stainless steel appliances and shining brass hardware. Much easier to work in than the nearly-counterless galley kitchen that Gwyn is used to in her own apartment.\n\nHe takes a step back just as she steps around the kitchen island. She presses a hand to the small of his back as she says around a startled laugh, “Aguas!”\n\nIt takes him a moment, but he turns to give her a quizzical look. “Waters? Why would you say that?”\n\nHer mouth opens, but nothing comes out. She doesn’t actually know, just remembers her mother saying it while girls stampeded through backstage during quick changes. “I’ll Google it. You get chopping.”\n\n“It’s already finished.” A large splayed hand sweeps above the countertop, and Gwyn sees a slow cooker that smells heavenly. Nearby is a bowl of salsa verde. “I told you I’d prep.”\n\nThe corners of his eyes crinkle up when he smiles.\n\n“Good job,” she says, and a ghost of their earlier play curls between them.\n\nShe’s honestly a little sad she hadn’t gotten to watch him cook – occasionally, in between watching Stray Kids fancams, she watches the cringey thirst traps of men cooking with their shirts off, fingering their citruses and slapping their meat. It’s nice to see hot people look stupid sometimes.\n\nShe hefts herself up onto the island, and Azriel steps in between her legs. His hands slide past her waist until they nearly touch hers. He rests his cheek on her collarbone. He’s never done this before, and at first, she thinks that’s what has made her chest tighten.\n\nIt’s just like when That Man cornered her, she thinks wildly. No, that’s not right – she hadn’t been sitting on anything, but his forearms had landed on the wall on either side of her head.\n\nAzriel is not Atlas; she should be stronger than her memories. Her skin crawls anyway.\n\n“What’s wrong?” Azriel asks, his chin rubbing against her skin with every word. His voice is nothing like Atlas’s, deep and calm while Atlas’s voice had been strident and commanding.\n\nShe feels stranded halfway between memory and the present. “I’m fine.”\n\nHe peers up at her incredulously. He could make her say it, any alpha could if they just pushed hard enough.\n\n“Please move your arms,” she whispers after a long, strained moment.\n\nImmediately, he backs up until he stands against the other counter. Air returns to Gwyn’s world now that he’s a couple feet away, and she tries to swallow again. She can’t look at him. What would be worse if she looked up now, pity or sympathy?\n\n“I’m sorry,” she says. “Sometimes I – sometimes I just need space.”\n\nFrom men, she doesn’t say.\n\n“Gwyn,” he says, and there is an undercurrent of urgency in his voice, though still not any alpha command. “Look at me.”\n\nIt’s too hard to meet his eyes, which are angry, so she looks instead just past his right ear. The apartment smells so much like her childhood home in Independence, but she is alone, in a place more swamp than city.\n\n“I’m sorry,” she says again.\n\nIt takes her a long moment to realize that his anger wasn’t at her, not really. Her therapist – God, she hasn’t seen that woman in nearly two years since her health insurance changed – would be proud that Gwyn can tell the difference.\n\nAzriel hasn’t spoken, and when she finally summons the courage to look at him again, his arms are crossed and he’s observing the kitchen floor tiles like there’s a code to unlocking Gwyn’s strange behavior carved into the grout.\n\n“Are you hungry?” Gwyn asks awkwardly. It’s not her house, but it’s suddenly hard to turn off the part of her that says she has to please this alpha.\n\nHe meets her gaze. “Are you?”\n\nAfter a moment, she nods.\n\nThey eat standing up in the kitchen, which her mother would hate, and Gwyn laughs a little to imagine poor Azriel sitting on his ass after all that she’d done to him. He doesn’t try to stand next to her again.\n\nShe takes a bite of the pork. It doesn’t taste quite like she remembers – would it ever? – but it still makes her throat tight and her eyes burn.\n\n“That bad?” Azriel jokes quietly. He hasn’t taken a bite of his yet.\n\nGwyn wants, suddenly, to keep her mother to herself. It’s not an anniversary; there’s no reason for her to be feeling like this. She clears her throat and says hoarsely, “My mom used to make this when I’d come home from Boston. I haven’t had it in a long time.”\n\nUnderstanding flickers across his face. He takes a bite and says, as though surprised at himself, “It’s good.”\n\nHer throat is too tight to speak again, so Gwyn only nods and scoops up more of her own.\n\nThey eat in companionable silence. She should text Emerie, let her know that Azriel still doesn’t have a sex dungeon.\n\n“You don’t have to tell me what happened,” Azriel says suddenly, and this time his voice is threaded with an alpha’s command. “But you have to tell me when I do things that – that scare you like that.”\n\nHere, at last, they return to a power dynamic that she is familiar with. Maybe Azriel doesn’t mean to make her do it, but Gwyn is too tired to stop herself from baring her throat glands obediently.\n\nHe reaches out, swipes his thumb over one of the glands.\n\nParents do that. Sometimes as dominance, sometimes as comfort. No one has done it for her since she was very small.\n\n“Please stop,” she says, and his hand falls away. “I don’t want to cry into my dinner.”\n\n“Wouldn’t want to over-salt it,” he murmurs in response, and she laughs.\n\nShe eats seconds, he eats thirds. After she hops off the counter to put her bowl in his dishwasher, he asks, “Do you want a lift back home?”\n\nHe asks every time, and she has always said no. This time, though, daring grabs Gwyn. “I thought I could spend the night.”\n\nAzriel rocks back on his heels, surprise pushing his eyebrows up. “I think you overestimate my ability to fuck you again.”\n\n“I like that you’re so straightforward,” she says, laughing. “No posturing from an alpha is like - ”\n\n“Can I kiss you?”\n\nHe waits a split second after asking before leaning in and kissing her, close-mouthed. When he pulls away, his hands are behind his back, like he wants to prove to her that he won’t touch her unless she asks for it.\n\n“The dean of my old ballet company called and said she believed that my teacher raped me,” Gwyn blurts. The words burn her throat, matching the burn in her cheeks at Azriel’s confusion that blurs into shock. “I shouldn’t have said that.”\n\n“Was he an alpha?” Azriel asks, and the look on his face: she’s seen ones like it before, full of an ecstatic, budding violence at the prospect of hurting someone who’s hurt someone weaker, someone less-than, but Gwyn is not lesser than anyone, and she doesn’t need Azriel to take her pain and make it his own.\n\n“Stop that,” she snaps. “I just want you to understand. Don’t ruin this by making me feel like – like - ”\n\nShe can’t find the words in any language she knows. Azriel’s soft clothes feel too heavy on her skin. She is a fool.\n\nHe grabs her elbow, and when she jerks it away, he lets her go. There is still anger splashed across his face (again, not at her, she imagines telling her old therapist), but he only says, “I’m sorry. I won’t do it again.”\n\n“Good.” Her voice sounds shrill, even to her. Histrionic, Thistlewaite had called her. Prone to fits of anxiety and bouts of depression. She smooths a hand down her front before fisting it in the fabric above her stomach. “I should start over.”\n\nWhen he doesn’t speak, only nods to her to continue, she takes a deep breath. She doesn’t have to tell him everything.\n\nShe tells him, “My mom is dead,” and, well, that’s just not what she wanted to say. The history of her is coming out all wrong.\n\n“My mom is dead, too,” Azriel murmurs before she can backtrack again. His tattooed knuckles grip the edge of the counter.\n\nWould they recognize her, this wild, confused person standing in some man’s kitchen while she tries badly to explain herself? “How did she die?”\n\nAzriel purses his lips, taps one finger on the counter. “Murdered.”\n\n“That’s fucking awful.” He hums in agreement, and she continues, “You can join my club.”\n\n“Your what?”\n\nGwyn shrugs. “It’s a dead mom club. There’s more of us than you’d expect.”\n\nHe laughs, and it’s a nice one, fuller than she remembers hearing before. He’s still smiling when he says, “You don’t want to spend the night, Gwyn.”\n\nIt hurts, maybe more than it should, but he’s right. She scrubs a hand down her face, heedless of her makeup. the girls expect her home, anyway. “I hate to admit that you’re right.”\n\n“I won’t tell anyone.” His smile is mostly gone now, but his eyes are still crinkled at the corners.\n\nThey don’t speak the entire elevator ride down to the parking garage. She doesn’t say anything when she slips into his Beamer, but she does let herself sigh when the seat warmers turn on. Faint thrash metal serenades them from the car’s stereo.\n\nAt last he pulls up to the curb outside her building, and she turns to him, her blue dress unceremoniously balled up in her hands. He watches her expectantly, one wrist propped indifferently on the steering wheel, his face half-concealed in shadow.\n\nBefore she can speak, though, he says, “Thanks for telling me that stuff earlier.”\n\n“You, too.”\n\n“It doesn’t change anything.” His eyes are so serious. “Between us.”\n\nNo, she thinks sadly. It changes everything, no matter what they want to believe. “I want to get to know you better,” she says.\n\nA distant, bitter look crosses his face, but he says, “I’d like that.”\n\nThere is a beat of silence, and Gwyn nods once, decisively. “I’ll see you later, Azriel.”\n\nHe waits, like every good alpha should, until she’s into her building. She allows herself a wave, and his car roars off into the gathering night.\n\nShe checks the mailbox. Bill, bill, flyer, letter for Nesta from one of her sisters. She carries it all with her upstairs and slips her key into the lock.\n\nNesta, of course, is at the theater, but Emerie is home, and her head whips around the moment Gwyn steps inside. A wolfish grin spreads over her face. “Wey, apestas.”\n\nSomething about hearing it in Spanish makes Gwyn’s face crumple.\n\n“I’m fine, I’m fine,” she says, high and panicky when Emerie leaps to her feet. “It’s been a long day.”\n\nPlease, she thinks. Don’t ask me anything right now. Emerie is too keen an observer; she, after all, had been the first one to notice that Gwyn was different after That Man.\n\n“Go shower,” Emerie commands softly. Not an alpha’s command, but a welcome one nonetheless. “Then you’ll tell me everything.”\n\nGwyn leaves her balled-up dress on the couch and steps into the bathroom. She runs the shower much hotter than she needs to, and spends the moments before the mirror fogs up looking at herself in the mirror again. Catrin’s face looks back at her, growing fuzzy as steam overwhelms it.\n\nIt is Azriel’s face, though, that comes back to her as she stands under the spray of water. The way he had looked when he’d asked to kiss her, the astonished way his mouth fell open when she slipped his cock inside her.\n\nThere might be a future there, if she could just let herself get there.\n\nShe doesn’t put the too-soft clothes back on, instead returning to the living room in her towel. Her feet slap wetly with each step.\n\n“Neta, estoy bien,” she announces to Emerie.\n\nEmerie raises an eyebrow and pats the couch. “No te Hagas.”\n\nShe sits, the two of them rolling companionably towards each other on the defeated, worn couch cushions. “Braid my hair?” Gwyn asks.\n\nAccompanied by the sure and familiar touch of Emerie’s fingers in her hair, Gwyn begins to talk. It gets easier the longer she does. Nesta comes home from the theater eventually, and Gwyn starts over.\n\nShe is lonely, frequently, and misses her family – misses herself from those years before – but she is not alone.\n\nHer eyes burn as she gets into bed at some ungodly hour. Parts of her scalp are still damp, and she scratches them before reaching for her phone. What are you doing next Saturday?\n\nIt takes a moment, but Azriel responds, I thought I’d go to the ballet.\n\nShe checks the ballet schedule. I knew you were a Swan Lake man.\n\nHe responds, to her shock and delight, with a wink emoji, followed by three swans and some sparkles.\n\nShe locks her phone and plugs it in. After a long moment of grinning stupidly up at her ceiling, she picks it up again. You should be asleep.\n\nYes, alpha.\n\nShe smothers her laugh into her pillow. Nesta can get them good seats next week. The thought of him beside her, warm and adamant, carries her to sleep."
