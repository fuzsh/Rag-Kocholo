        "text": "Footballers' Wives instantly became must-watch television when it launched in 2002.\n\nDramatising the lives of soccer aces and their alluring partners, there was never a dull moment until the show finished in 2006.\n\nDuring its run we saw infidelity, nudity and attempted murder - and that was just in the first episode.\n\nSo have you ever wondered what happened to all your favourite cast members after the series ended?\n\nFrom Tanya and Chardonnay to Jason and Conrad, here's what the stars are doing now.\n\nZoe Lucker as Tanya Turner\n\nTanya Turner was the undisputed Queen of the WAGs.\n\nLike most queens, she was prepared to do pretty much anything to stay seated on her throne.\n\nWho could forget when she swapped her own baby just to keep star player Conrad Gates?\n\nOther storylines saw her plotting against her fellow wives and trying to take over Earls Park Football Club.\n\nAfter the show ended, actress Zoe Lucker bagged roles on EastEnders, Waterloo Road and Holby Blue.\n\nIn 2014 she was cast as Reenie McQueen on Hollyoaks, where she stayed until June 2016.\n\nCristian Solimeno as Jason Turner\n\nJason Turner was the ultimate bad boy.\n\nMarried to Tanya, he had very little shame about publicly cheating on his wife.\n\nThe womaniser even copped off with team mate Kyle Pascoe's mum - resulting in them welcoming a hermaphrodite child together.\n\nAfter pushing his luck as much as possible, Jason died after being shoved off a rooftop by Chardonnay in the finale of season two.\n\nActor Cristian Solimeno would feature in episodes of The Vicar of Dibley and Strictly Confidential after leaving the show.\n\nIn 2014, he briefly played Ray McCormick on Hollyoaks, appeared in Holby City and did a voice part in American Dad.\n\nHe went on to play DS Alex Bruno in the TV series Guilt before swapping the small screen for the silver screen and bagging a role in the Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts.\n\nGary Lucy as Kyle Pascoe\n\nKyle was the up-and-coming star player who was dating glamour model Chardonnay.\n\nThe pair featured in one of the most outrageous TV weddings ever as they got married with a fairytale theme.\n\nPoor Kyle was never the same after his wife died from anorexia and his life ended up spiralling out of control.\n\nHe became a gambling addict, lost almost everything and was carted off after suffering a nervous breakdown.\n\nActor Gary Lucy - also famed for his stint on Hollyoaks between 1999 and 2002 - went on to play Danny Pennant on EastEnders.\n\nHe also competed on Dancing on Ice in 2010, coming second to Hayley Tamaddon.\n\nHe married real-life girlfriend Nathasha Gray in November 2014, a decade after first dating her, and the pair now have three children together,\n\nThe hunky pin-up reprised his Hollyoaks role in 2017, returning to the soap as troubled footballer Luke Morgan.\n\nSusie Amy as Chardonnay Lane-Pascoe\n\nChardonnay was a glamour model who refused to quit her job just because she was marrying Kyle.\n\nUnfortunately her plans changed when she burnt her boobs during her hen night.\n\nChardonnay was constantly pushed to the edge by Jason and eventually killed him with a champagne bottle.\n\nAt the beginning of season three it was sadly revealed that she'd died from anorexia.\n\nActress Susie Amy has stayed in the limelight with roles on a number of high-profile shows.\n\nJust some of the gigs on her CV include The Royal, Coronation Street, Hotel Babylon and Doctors.\n\nShe briefly joined the cast of Coronation Street in 2007 as Lindsey Gordon, then played herself in the TV series Moving Wallpaper.\n\nA role in the 2009 film Lesbian Vampire Killers gave her a taste of Hollywood - but it was the call of the soaps that brought her back to the small screen in 2017 when she was signed to Hollyoaks.\n\nA Hollyoaks source told Mirror Online: \"It is a short-term contract but the door is very much open for a return if the fans like what they see.\n\n\"Getting these two back together is a result for Hollyoaks.\"\n\nGillian Taylforth as Jackie Pascoe\n\nJackie was the loving mum who just wanted the best for her son Kyle.\n\nBut she ended up getting sucked into all the drama - most notably after being charmed by Jason.\n\nShe also ended up marrying club manager Roger Webb before jetting off to live with Kyle in Australia.\n\nActress Gillian would later play Sandy Roscoe on Hollyoaks before reprising her iconic role as Kathy Beale on EastEnders in 2015, where she's been ever since.\n\nShe also competed on Strictly Come Dancing in 2008 and Celebrity Big Brother in 2013.\n\nJohn Forgeham as Frank Laslett\n\nFrank Laslett was the chairman of Earls Park.\n\nIn the first episode he got into a scuffle with Jason and Tanya - ultimately ending up with him a coma.\n\nWhen he awoke, all was (eventually) forgiven and he married Tanya.\n\nFrank died when scheming Tanya caused him to have a viagra-induced heart attack, but he had the last laugh by getting her pregnant in the process.\n\nActor John Forgeham was already well known for his film career before joining Footballers' Wives, playing Frank in the original Italian Job, Captain Bolvan in Star Wars and Max in Kiss Of The Dragon in 2001.\n\nIn 2012, viewers may have spotted him playing Nigel Whitely on Doctors.\n\nSadly, John died in March 2017 from internal bleeding after falling out of his bed at home and breaking his collarbone. He was 75.\n\nJesse Birdsall as Roger Webb\n\nManager Roger just couldn't separate business from pleasure.\n\nIt made things very difficult for him, especially after marrying Jackie.\n\nAfter trying to make the family work and get along with Jackie's son Kyle, Roger was killed by new chairman Garry Ryan in season five.\n\nA whole new generation now know actor Jesse Birdsall as gangster Fraser Black on Hollyoaks, which he joined in 2013 for a year.\n\nIronically, he was also romantically involved with actress Gillian Taylforth on that show too.\n\nAfter Footballers' Wives, Jesse went on to star in 2008's Foyle's War, Midsomer Murders and briefly joined EastEnders in 2012.\n\nBen Price as Conrad Gates\n\nConrad Gates was a blond, sexy and charming footballer. Sound familiar?\n\nThe Beckham-esque character reignited interest in the show when he debuted during season three.\n\nStorylines saw him explore his bisexuality and leave his wife Amber for Tanya.\n\nSadly Conrad took his final bow after shockingly being shot dead in season four.\n\nActor Ben went on to secure roles on The Bill, The Tudors and Casualty.\n\nSince 2009, he's played restaurateur Nick Tilsley on Coronation Street - and even did a Corrie special of The Jeremy Kyle Show in character, alongside Michelle Keegan, Jack Shepherd and Craig Gazey.\n\nAlison Newman as Hazel Bailey\n\nHazel was a ruthless sports agent who was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nGood friends with Tanya, she would often lie, cheat and steal just to get her own way.\n\nHazel eventually became the club's new chairman before resigning to try her hand as a tennis agent.\n\nActress Alison Newman has since starred on Doctors, Casualty and Call the Midwife.\n\nShe's also known for playing DI Samantha Keeble in EastEnders, which she did between 2008 and 2016"
