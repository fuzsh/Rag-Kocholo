        "text": "Lemar\n\nSupports: Barnardo's Hamara Project, east London.\n\nLemar visited Barnardo's Hamara Project in Walthamstow, east London, to pay tribute to the work done by volunteers for GMTV's coverage of National Volunteers' Week from 1 to 7 June this year. At the project, which provides a range of services to disabled children up to the age of 19, the singer was filmed by GMTV cameras as he met children, relatives and staff.\n\nThe Hamara Project also offers support for the families of disabled children, such as a sitting service, an integrated play scheme, a befriending service and a parent support group.\n\nLemar said: \"I had such a great day visiting Hamara. I've met some very inspirational volunteers who should be proud of the difference they are making. The Barnardo's staff have nothing but praise for the volunteers, and I now know why.\"\n\nWorld Cup-winning ex-England rugby captain Martin Johnson and the British and Irish Lions are supporting Schoolchildren for Children in encouraging schools to organise sponsored fitness events. The aim is to raise £1 per child at a series of events that will be held across the UK on 30 September. The idea is that each school should keep 50p of every pound to help develop its own sports facilities. The other 50p will go to schools in developing countries. Members of the Lions squad joined Welsh schoolchildren on 23 May in Cardiff to launch the event. Last year, £10,000 was raised for poorer countries.\n\nPremiership-winning Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho donated his 'lucky' jacket to an auction to raise money for tsunami relief, the African Foundation and Clic Sargent. The auction raised £545,000, with an anonymous bidder paying £22,000 for the coat.\n\nJesse Birdsall, who plays manager Roger Webb in Footballers' Wives, and Gwyneth Strong, who played Cassandra in Only Fools and Horses, attended a special NCH screening of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith.\n\nThe event raised more than £10,000.\n\nBlur front man Damon Albarn will be taking part in an event organised by Cafedirect on British Airways' London Eye to help raise awareness of African culture. On 21 June there will be performances of music, theatre and comedy in each of the 32 Eye capsules."
