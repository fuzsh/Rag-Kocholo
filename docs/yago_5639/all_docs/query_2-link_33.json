I don't really wear makeup.\"\n\n\"I feel my most beautiful when I am truly myself.\"\n\nPaltrow, who is married to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and mother to their two children, credited her workout routine for keeping her looking young and feeling strong.\n\nPaltrow takes the People title from her friend, singer Beyonc√© Knowles, named in 2012.\n\n\"I honestly thought someone was playing a joke on me,\" Paltrow said of first learning about her honour from the celebrity magazine.\n\n\"I had to reread the e-mail three times...It's a very iconic cover in American culture, so it's just amazing.\""
