Named left to right John Tumelty, Charles Wells, Buell Smith, Charles Chappell, & Alec Hartrick.\n\nJim and Gina Chappell, parents of the bride, Michelle and Dave's Wedding\n\nJames Birdsall Chappell\n\nJim Chappell, one of the most well-known personalities in the Kansas City area, lived in Keokuk, Iowa, from his birth in 1942 until he went to college at Drury University in Springfield, Missouri. At Drury he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree as an art major. Jim's parents were Charles Birdsall Chappell and Mary Pauline Simpson Chappell. His only sibling was his older brother, Charles Simpson Chappell.\n\nJim combined his knack for building long-lasting relationships with building a business – Chappell's Restaurant & Sports Museum in North Kansas City, Missouri. Chappell's has been the “go-to” place for sports and political personalities from all over the region – and beyond – for decades. Celebrated as one of the best sports bars in the country in numerous national publications and also picked by the newspaper, USA Today, as “the number one place in the country to watch the Super Bowl”, the restaurant has a welcoming bar, great food and a unique visual appeal with over a thousand football helmets covering the spacious ceiling and framed autographed photos and other memorabilia decorating the walls. The other extra ingredient for a fulfilling customer experience at Chappell's was, almost always, the opportunity to have an enlightening and pleasant interaction with the owner, Jim Chappell, who seemed to be omnipresent at lunch and dinner hours.\n\nChappell's Restaurant & Sports Museum has achieved national acclaim as well as an exceptional local reputation. It has received coverage in Sports Illustrated, Sport Magazine, the Chicago Tribune and USA Today was the repeated subject of coverage in countless newspaper and magazine articles as well as radio and television. In 2012 Jim Chappell co-authored a captivating book “Conversations at Chappell's” and Jim was featured in a 30 minute biographical documentary produced by the KC Chiefs network about his relationship with many Kansas City Chiefs' greats.\n\nWhile acknowledging the fame and success he has achieved, Jim gives credit to his wife of 50 plus years, Gina, their two daughters and five grandchildren. He says, “The only reason I have been successful is because of Gina and our family.” He gives credit also to the values shaped by his parents who gave him a great life growing up.\n\nIn addition to raising a family and running a business, Jim was involved in countless community and civic activities: Member and then Chairman of the Kansas City Planning Commission; Commissioner of the Kansas City Port Authority; Chairman of the Clay County Board of Election Commissioners. Since 1985, he has been on the Board of Directors of the First Bank of Missouri (now Security Bank of Kansas City) and, for 25 of those years, he served as Chairman of the Board. During this time, he also served on the Board of Directors of the Valley View Holding Company. Early in his career he made an unsuccessful attempt to be elected as a Missouri State Senator, with the support and endorsement of Kit Bond, a close personal friend and political advisor, who was a former Missouri Governor at that time and who eventually became a long-time U.S. Senator for Missouri.\n\nJim Chappell's family history offers examples of success that set a high standard. Charles Chappell was a prominent realtor and historian, known throughout the state of Iowa. At his death, he was listed as a Notable Iowan in the Annals of Iowa. He was the president of Midland Homes and owner of the Iowa Land Company, a successful real-estate brokerage, appraising and insurance business. He died unexpectedly at the age of 54, the same year Jim was to be enrolled as a Freshman at Drury University. According to one commentary, “(Charles) had a distinct and stimulating personality, an inquiring mind and was particularly well-read and informed with a strong interest in history.” These are attributes that friends of Jim would say apply to Jim as well. Jim's mother, Pauline, attended the University of Kansas City, the Cranston School of Music and studied ballet at the Kansas City Conservatory of music and danced for several years with the Kansas City Ballet. At 79 She earned a certificate for excellence in creative writing from Penn Valley Community College. She had high expectations and a determination for Jim to graduate from college, in spite of the personal setback of losing his father at a critical time in his life.\n\nCelebrities made sure they stopped by Chappell's when they were in Kansas City. The list of those included Dave Winfield, Marcus Allen, artist LeRoy Neiman, Warren Buffett and Vince Gill. Regulars included Hank Stram, Len Dawson, Hank Bauer, Joe Montana and George Brett. It was also a welcome hangout for federal judges, federal appellate judges, a United States Attorney General, United States Senators, Governors and countless federal and state representatives, and maybe, a few mobsters. The list of accolades and memberships associated with Jim Chappell include: member of the Sons of the American Revolution, Kansas City Police Retirement Board, graduate of the FBI Citizens Academy, named by the Kansas City Star as one of the “25 People Who Make Kansas City a Better Sports Town.”\n\nJim's personal appeal and credentials have been described in a variety of ways: successful entrepreneur; community leader; Author; doting husband of Gina; father of two daughters and proud grandfather of five; funny, warm and charming; world traveler – traveling all over the world plus the 50 states. The typical experience when a customer walked through the door was to see this tall, good-looking gentleman rise from his seat at the front of the bar and offer his wide smile and recognize an old friend. It seems that everyone knows Jim and Jim knows everyone. You could usually find him walking around, giving new and old friends tours of the place or going from table to table telling patrons a quick story of the times hanging on the walls around them. One comment was, “It would be like the President taking you on a tour of the White House or Elvis taking you on a tour of Graceland.”\n\nThe memorabilia on the walls and hanging from the ceiling were diverse, notable and interesting. Visitors could see John Wooden's 1930-31 Purdue All-Indiana trophy, Michael Jordan's autographed Olympic jersey, the boxing gloves Sylvester Stallone wore in “Rocky”, and home plate from Municipal Stadium signed by the 1955 Kansas City Athletics and several Monarchs. Chappell's was one of those places where you could eat a hundred times and be fascinated by a new photograph or trinket with each visit. It might be Tom Watson's putter or the signed photographs of baseball legends Jackie Robinson and Satchel Paige posing in Monarch's uniforms. One could say that football helmets from every college and professional team known to mankind were hanging from the ceiling. Jim could take you directly to almost any of those helmets you might ask about and tell you a story about the team it represents.\n\nAlong the way, Chappell the man has become somewhat of a celebrity. Too many times to count, he's been asked to tell someone “Happy Birthday” on a videotape or to sign Styrofoam baseballs that he gives to kids (the adults are the ones wanting the autograph). A few months ago, a man came into Chappell's and asked Jim to write a note to the man's father – the Chappell family's mailman back in Keokuk, who had cancer. “When a guy comes in and asks you to write a note to his dying dad that makes you feel good.” Chappell says softly, “I loved doing those things because it makes them feel special”\n\nFor any self-respecting sports fan in Kansas City, the feeling is mutual.\n\nMissouri Sports Hall of Fame\n\nChappell was enshrined into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame, Class of 2013. With his new place in the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame, Chappell's legacy is now sealed in sports history. For visitors to his restaurant and those who meet him, the impression of the man himself is to be just as enduring.\n\nSelected Timeline of Jim Chappell's Career Highlights:\n\n2024 Designated by United States Senator Eric Schmidt as \"Champion of Missouri\"\n\n2024 Chairman Snake Saturday Grand Marshall Selection Committee\n\n2023 Included in Marquis Who's Who in America\n\n2019 Member of Mercury Club\n\n1981 – 2018 President, Mitina, Inc.\n\n1989 – 2017 Chairman of the Board, First Bank of Missouri\n\n1986 – 2018 Founder (Retired) Chappell's Restaurant & Sports Museum\n\n1985 – 2017 Board of Directors, First Bank of Missouri\n\n1994 – 2017 Board of Directors, Valley View Holding Company\n\n2017 – Present Board of Directors, Security Bank of Kansas City\n\nMember of the Sons of the American Revolution (SAR)\n\nMember of the Native Sons & Daughters of Greater Kansas City\n\nListed by Drury University as a notable alumni\n\nMember, American Legion Post 58\n\nMember, Kansas City Club\n\nMember of St. Patrick Catholic Church\n\nAdvisory Council Clay County Sheriff's Office\n\n2002 – 2017 Clay County Board of Election Commissioners - Appointed by Governor Bob Holden\n\n2017 In a presentation by the Keokuk Public Library, was included as one of Keokuk's Most Famous People\n\n2014 Subject of Hometown Hero Produced by KMBC Channel 9 Larry Moore\n\n2013 “Conversations at Chappell's book published by Kansas City Star\n\n2013 Enshrined in Missouri Sports Hall of Fame\n\n2013 Subject of 30 minute Chief's Kingdom Film about relationship with the Kansas City Chiefs\n\n2011 – 2016 Kansas City Police Employee's Retirement Systems Board appointed by K.C.

Cole who designed and built the house for his own residence in the 1880s. At the time it was built it was one of the finest in the city. The Cole family lived in the house for 53 years until it was purchased by Jim’s father, Charles B. Chappell, in 1942. In addition to being an engineer and an architect, Mr. Cole and his brother owned and operated a successful stove business. Mr. Cole had also served as superintendent of the Carnegie Bridge which spanned the Mississippi River at Keokuk. The beautiful neighborhood Mr. Cole chose was one and a half blocks from the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River.\n\nIn 1963, three years after Mr. Chappell’s death, Jim, his mother and his brother decided to sell the house. Both Jim and his brother were in college at the time and Mrs. Chappell decided the house was too much for her. The next owners kept the house for about 10 years. By the mid-1970s and early 80s the economy in Keokuk was in steep decline and many fine old homes fell into disrepair, including the one at 216 High Street, and were demolished.\n\nThe three-story house at 216 High Street was a large brick house with stained brown shingles and beautiful decorative gray wood trim. It had five magnificent fireplaces. The interior was ornately decorated with beautiful oak throughout. All the doors and windows had detailed oak carvings. The designed doors all had glass, brass or wooden doorknobs and pearl button light switches. Inside the front door was a reception foyer that contained a welcoming fireplace, a large chandelier and a comfortable alcove with a hall seat. The ceiling was beautifully decorated with wood that was planked in a square pattern. The library was the most impressive room in the house. It had a large, curved bay window with beautiful stained glass windows and two side windows. An persian carpet covered the wood floor. The mahogany fireplace was detailed with intricate carvings, a small shelf and a beveled mirror. A marble button with a decorative wooden holder was pushed to call for service. All the walls had built-in wooden bookshelves that housed over 2,500 books. Two large elegant sliding doors with detailed carved oak led into the dining room. The dining room was stunning with a built-in china cabinet and fireplace. The china cabinet held the family’s Haviland china from France that was passed down for two generations. There was a large mahogany antique table with six chairs and Jim’s mother’s piano was in the corner. A very large living room also had a fireplace, a stained glass bay window, a wood floor and an oriental carpet. Four bedrooms were upstairs on the second floor, each with a large walk-in closet. Typical of the time for fine houses, one bathroom served the entire second floor. The Master bedroom had a fireplace, a walk out balcony and bookcases filled with books. There was a small alcove with a chair and lamp for reading. The kitchen was ordinary for the time. It contained a pantry room and service stairs, referred to as “backstairs”. The stairs led to a bedroom upstairs where the domestic help stayed. There was a third floor that had two bedrooms, but was mostly used for storage. It had a walk-out door to a roof patio which was enjoyed on hot summer evenings.\n\n​\n\nThe Chappell home is listed in a book Tales of Early Keokuk Homes by historian Raymond, E. Garrison.​\n\n(In the book the home 216 High St. is listed under 612 Exchange St. Mr. Cole previous home) page 25\n\nAbout the Owners of 216 High Street, Keokuk, Iowa:\n\nThe Cole and Chappell families were both descended from Revolutionary ancestry. An ancestor of John Cole was Col. Phillip Cole. He commanded the 4th Battalion of Northumberland County, a Pennsylvania regiment which was in the battle at Trenton, NJ. James Birdsall Chappell is a member of the Sons of the American Revolution (S.A.R.) and daughter Michelle Ann Chappell Pato is a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution (D.A.R.)\n\nExcerpts from the obituary of Mrs. John H. Cole:\n\nMrs. Leulia Warner Cole was born July 29, 1854 in Meshoppen, PA. She was married on December 23, 1873 in Emporium, PA to John H. Cole. Shortly afterward they moved to Keokuk. They had three daughters: Emma L, Ora Belle, and Iva Valentine. Two of the daughters were graduates of the University of Chicago.\n\n​\n\nExcerpts from the obituary of Mrs. Charles B Chappell:\n\nMrs. Pauline Simpson Chappell was born on May 12, 1901 in Kansas City, KS. She was married on March 20, 1940 in Lawrence, KS to Charles B. Chappell. Shortly afterward they moved to Keokuk, IA. She and Charles had two sons, Charles Simpson Chappell and James Birdsall Chappell. She attended the University of Kansas City and the Cranston School of Music and studied ballet at the Kansas City Conservatory of Music.\n\n​Lt. Andrew H. Simpson was the grandfather of Jim's mother, Pauline Simpson Chappell, and was an officer in the Civil War. He commanded the 93rd US Infantry, which were a colored troop. After the war, he became a well-known lawyer and, as member of the Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R). This was a fraternal organization of officers who served in the Civil War. As an organization, one of its objectives was supporting voting rights for black veterans.\n\nJoseph E. Simpson, Jr., Pauline's nephew and Jim cousin, served in World War II as a major and, ironically commanded the colored 847 Engineer Aviation Battalion. He said he was very proud of his command but, more importantly, he was proud of his troops and their service. President Harry Truman ended segregation in the US Military in 1948.\n\nThe Chappell Summer Cottage\n\nOverlooking the Mississippi river\n\nJim spent many of the finest days of his youth at the family's summer cottage on river road overlooking the Mississippi river thirty yards away, the cottage was the centerpiece of twenty acres of fun. Jim and his brother swam and fished in the river. They had three horses and a pet mule named \" Thunder.\" There was a shelter barn for the animals, who were stored off-site in the winter. On either side of the cottage was a creek, and every corner of the grounds told of a sense of mystery and excitement\n\nThe visitor was hit by a powerful splash of color. The cottage was nestled amid a gorgeous array of day-lilies, irises, honeysuckle, forsythia, rose of Sharon, hibiscus, lilac, and morning-glory. Blues rubbed shoulders with yellows, while reds and oranges and purples fanned out in a display studded with bursts of opaline. Jim never tired of reveling in the splendor, and it is clear that his artistic sensibility grew and took shape in the experience.\n\nJim's father had a treehouse built for the boys from which they could survey the wonders, as well as a log cabin that came in handy when they played cowboys and Indians. And he also had a barbecue pit built, where the family prepared delicious ribs. Surrounding the cottage were three porches, one screened-in and two outside with benches all facing the Mississippi river. One room featured the three double beds. Jim has fond memories of the classic furniture, the large round oak table in the kitchen, the icebox with its blocks of ice, the decorative fireplace with a large mounted deer head above and the radio--no television-- that brought the St. Louis Cardinals to the cottage.\n\nEvery variety of plant life could be found at the cottage. The vegetable gardens supplied their bounty, including watermelons that the family kept cool in a gunny sack down in the well. In every direction away from the river loomed a thick wood, which included maple trees that were tapped for syrup, Christmas trees that could be cut down for the Yuletide celebration at the family home, and a clearing with a large tree that had a tire attached for a swing. Deep in the wood was a clearing where Jim remembers a tree limb that was home to a tiny swallow. The cottage was only four miles from town, but it seemed like it was hundreds of miles away in a world of its own. Like Thoreau at Walden Pond, Jim was able to find an escape as well as the joy of nature on the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe Fourth of July was a highlight of life at the cottage. The family celebrated with cases of pop and a wide variety of sweets and desserts. The boys set off firecrackers during the day, while father arranged a powerful display of fireworks at night. The colors lighting up the sky would match the gorgeous palette supplied by nature in the flowers and shrubs below.\n\nAnother highlight was the hunt for a treasure chest that had been carefully prepared by Jim's father. The adventure of piecing together maps and clues and directions created a magic moment that one could look forward to all year. The hunt expresses the heart of the cottage and its captivating mystery. All around you was something to be explored, experiences to be savored, and memories to be treasured. Wherever he has gone later in life, Jim has enjoyed the inspiration of the cottage.\n\nThe Chappell-Swedenburg House\n\nIn Ashland, Oregon, also known for hosting the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, stands the Chappell-Swedenburg house, one of the most celebrated homes in the region. It was built in the early years of the twentieth century by Jim's ancestor Charles Church Chappell. Charles C. Chappell had been born in Jacksonville, Illinois and moved east for a successful career as a stockbroker in New York City, where he lived in his mansion on Fifth Avenue. In 1904, he moved his family to Ashland, a town he remembered from his early travels. Wherever he lived, he was surrounded by his collection of beautiful furnishings and art as well as antiques he had acquired on his European voyages. The remarkable house in Ashland was described by family friend Grace Miriam Flint in the Ashland Daily Tidings of January 29, 1966. This letter was one of the many letters of protest to save the house from demolishing it. As a result the house was saved and put on the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Department of the Interior. Charles C. Chappell's daughter, Charlotte, befriended Jim's mother Pauline, and Jim can remember her visiting the family home in Keokuk. Having grown up in the remarkable Ashland house, her visits to the carefully furnished and lovingly kept home at 216 High Street must have kept alive for Charlotte the Chappell family tradition of gracious living. The Chappell-Swedenburg house does indeed now stand on the grounds of Southern Oregon University, but it has been carefully preserved and renovated. In 1982, through the efforts of Jim's brother Charles S. Chappell and the Southern Oregon Historical Society, the house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Now a jewel of the campus, it hosts special receptions, and continues to be a source of inspiration and wonder for those privileged to visit it.\n\nMs. Flint's letter is as follows:\n\nThe Editor, Sir:​\n\n\"Edgar A. Guest said, \"It takes a heap of living in a house to make it a home.\" When I looked at the picture of the beautiful spacious old home on Siskiyou Boulevard, known as the Chappell-Swedenburg home, in tonight's paper and though of the years living that had been done in that home, I was filled with sorrow and anger to learn that it may no longer be a home. I grew up on Mountain Avenue. I was a little girl at the time that house was erected by Charley Chappell at the turn of the century. Mr. Chappell ,his young wife Lucy, and their three little daughters, Helen, Charlotte and Ruth, came here from New York City to reside in Ashland and make it their permanent home.\n\nMr. Chappell has been a wealthy stockbroker in New York City, but when the market panicked, Mr. Chappell sold his mansion on 5th Avenue and brought all its elegant furnishings to Ashland to live. Years before when a young man, he had traveled in the west and had been in Ashland and had fallen in love with it. Now he felt he no longer cared to live in the city and desired to rear his family in a small community in the West. When they came here he bought a small home to live in for awhile. It still stands almost as I remember it on the intersecting corner of the boulevard, Iowa St. and Morse St.\n\nMr. Chappell was a keen businessman and proceeded to purchase property here. He purchased the land where the house now stands, and orchard, then a small farm on one corner of which the high school now stands. The land on which most of the college now stands and other pieces of property became valuable. When he built his beautiful home in 1903 and 1904 in the middle of an apple and pear orchard, the townspeople thought it was folly to build such an expensive home in the middle of the orchard, way out on the edge of town. But he wanted a home worthy of his family and the exquisite furnishings that would go into it. He had traveled all over the world when young and had brought home beautiful and rare things for his home. He was still a bachelor then. We were all poor people in Ashland then, mostly railroad people, merchants and school teachers, which my father was, and it was hard to comprehend why anyone would spend such an exorbitant amount on a house or even had that much to spend.\n\n​Only the finest of materials went into this house and he practically watched every nail that was driven in each board. I can still see him standing up on the roof when the bricklayers were building the huge chimney. My father was so worried he would lise his balance and fall. Finally all the precious treasures were placed in this house. The family moved in and the house made the start of becoming a home. It was like being in Fairyland to wander through this house. Helen and I had become friends and playmates so I was in and out at all times whenever I wished. This my introduction to beautiful furnishings and antiques, fine Haviland China and crystal, gorgeous Persian and Oriental rugs and many other treasures too numerous to mention.\n\nHe also erected a barn as beautiful as the house was, fine box stalls and harness rooms; things no one here had ever seen in a barn. He being reared on a farm in New York state at Strawberry Point, if I remember correctly, longed to have livestock around him and have his children learn to love them too. They had a driving horse called Barney, a darling fat little Shetland pony called Belle, and the cutest little pony cart and a fat old white short-haired dog called Duke, even a Jersey cow for a short while. Those days were full of excitement and fun. But Mr. Chappell was not to enjoy his home and this new life with his family to whom he was so devoted for long. For suddenly one hot summer day in 1905, his heart worn out from the stress of the long move and the strength expended on his home, just gave up and ceased to beat anymore, and his beloved family left alone to live with his memory and the lovely home had built for them. The girls grew up in this, but times were not easy for the lovely mother. She sold the piece of land where the high school now stands to the school board and piece by piece other property. Many treasures were sold from the home to maintain a home for her girls.\n\nThrough all these trying years, Dr. Swedenburg was their family doctor and beloved friend. When Mrs. Chappell, who was then Mrs. George Wilson, found it was too much for her to maintain such a large home, disposed of it to Dr. Swedenburg and she moved to San Francisco. Dr. Swedenburg had purchased this house to be a permanent home fir his family and he and Mrs. Swedenburg also filled it with many treasures. His widow at the time of her death recently had specified and wished it still to be a home for her daughter, who was left. But such was not to be. It seems a state or college can move in and condemn a house that has had a \"Heap of Living in it\" and is now a \"home\" so that the loved ones who are now entitled to it, can no longer claim it as such. They call it progress, but I call it heartbreak and cruelty.\"\n\nSincerely,\n\nGrace Milam Flint\n\nAshland, OR\n\nJim's Mother: \"Painting With Words\"\n\nJim's gift for communication was shaped by the grace and wit of his mother Pauline Simpson Chappell. A ballerina and a writer, she impressed upon her son from an early age an appreciation of beauty and of proportion. From her he learned many of the skills of conversation, from the effective arrangement of words to the social power of wit and insight. When Jim read Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, the wisdom of that book bore fruit on ground that had been prepared by Pauline.\n\nA native of Kansas City, Kansas, Pauline attended the University of Kansas City and the Cranston School of Music. She studied ballet at the Kansas Conservatory of Music, and danced for several years with the Kansas City Ballet. Her devotion to the fine arts always informed her influence as a mother. Jim learned the importance of finding and channeling one's inspiration. In things big and small, she taught Jim the importance of careful arrangement and presentation. It was no surprise that Jim majored in the study of art at Drury University, or that he has always been known for his tasteful, elegant attire.\n\nPauline Chappell had a lifelong passion for the written word. Writing stories came naturally to her, and she looked at the world through a writer's eyes, alert to the complexities and the comedy of human nature. While raising a family in Keokuk, she belonged to two literary clubs, the Scribblers, who focused on writing, and Current Comment, which focused on books and the arts. Later in life she returned to school to work on creative writing at Penn Valley College, where at age 79 she won a certificate for excellence in creative writing. One of the peaks of her writing career came with her great success in writing acclaimed commercial jingles during what has been called the \"Contest Era,\" when American companies sponsored public competitions for advertising messages. This era coincided with the time her boys were growing up. Over those years she won, in addition to money, a vacuum cleaner, a refrigerator, a toaster, roller skates, cameras, radios, other appliances, and a bicycle which young Jim eagerly rode around town. But the commercial success never lessened her passion for poetry and for writing short stories. His mother taught Jim that there are many different kinds of success.\n\nJim has had a lifelong passion for art. One sign of that passion is his remarkable library of collectible books on art history. Jim can always cite the artist, or school, or technique behind a painting. He has a museum in his mind. Yet Jim's most impressive artistic achievement would have to be Chappell's Restaurant & Sports Museum, with its unmatched and elegantly arranged collection of sports memorabilia. People come back ten, twenty, a hundred times, to explore the collection. Overhead is the most impressive feature of all, more than a thousand football helmets from high schools, colleges, and pro teams all over America, many of them signed. In an instant Jim can find the precise location of any helmet and tell its story. He built the museum and also carries it in his head. The museum earned Jim a place in the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame, and that achievement was born in the life lessons imparted by Pauline Chappell.\n\nJim's wife Gina continues this family tradition. Gina carefully arranges the hunt for Easter baskets with a series of limericks indicating the clues to guide the grandchildren to their eventual destination. Thought-provoking and cleverly worded, the poems come naturally to Gina as they did to Pauline. Jim has truly been blessed by these two women and their gift for painting with words.\n\nAs an example of this family tradition, here are some of Gina's witty limericks:\n\nKANSAS CITY, MO, January 05, 2024 /PressRelease/ -- James B. Chappell has been included in Marquis Who's Who. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.\n\nMr. Chappell is one of Kansas City's most celebrated sports icons; along with the astounding collection of sports memorabilia he procured, he is the founder of one of the city's most treasured restaurant, Chappell's Restaurant & Sports Museum, which he established nearly 40 years ago and sold in 2018. Prior to opening the restaurant in 1986, he attended Drury University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in 1965; served on active reserve in the United States Army, with honorable discharge, from 1965 to 1971; and gained experience in the restaurant business, working at Arrowhead Lodge Restaurant and Lounge for several years.\n\nMoving forward in his career, Mr. Chappell worked for Mobil Oil Corporation, in a management role, and became a member of Platte County Business & Professional Association before becoming a partner of C.R. Tantillo & Associates Insurance Company, a position he held for nearly 20 years. While acting as partner, Mr. Chappell opened his restaurant and pursued a leadership role as president for Mitina Inc., which he held from 1981 to 2018.\n\nAlong with his various professional pursuits, Mr. Chappell continued on with his education and completed a course and received a certificate from the FBI Citizens Academy in 2011. His interest in the government processes led him to hold numerous roles in local government, starting in 1978 when he was a candidate for state senator. For nearly 50 years and counting, Mr. Chappell has served as a commissioner, vice chairman, governor's advisor, and board member across various sectors of local government and law enforcement organizations and boards.\n\nAs an active member of his local community and government, Mr. Chappell has volunteered for and participated in numerous civic engagements over the last several decades, starting in 1976 with his involvement with the Republican National Convention Host Committee and ultimately being selected as an at-large delegate to the 2008 Republican National Convention. Since then, he has sat on several boards and licensing bureaus and played a part in coordinating and fundraising efforts, including serving on the advisory council of the Clay County Sherriff's Office.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1995, Mr. Chappell devoted his time as a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics honorary coach and hosted the Jim Chappell Boy Scouts Golf Classic throughout the 1990s into the early 2000s. Furthermore, he served as chairman of the Clay County Board of Election Commissioners, appointed by Governor Matt Blunt, from 2005 to 2009. For his noteworthy contributions to the community, both as a public servant and restauranteur, Mr. Chappell has received several awards and recognitions, including the Northland Regional Chamber of Commerce Small Business of the Year Award in 2000 and being named one of 25 individuals who made Kansas City a better sports town by the Kansas City Star in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, Mr. Chappell received the honor of being Grand Marshal of the Snake Sunday Parade and was enshrined in the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in the class of 2013, among other recognitions. Along with his personal awards are those of his restaurant, which has received coverage by Yahoo and USA Today along with Sports Illustrated and the Chicago Tribune, where it was voted by both as one of the best sports restaurants in the nation. Since its debut on the restaurant scene, it has spent its time in the spotlight as a repeat subject of coverage in countless newspaper and magazine articles as well as radio and television shows.\n\nBeing known as an icon himself, and thus being afforded the opportunity to interact with and befriend other sports icons over the years, Mr. Chappell co-authored Conversations at Chappell's, a collection of stories shared by several local Kansas City sports icons, detailing their friendship with him. He was also featured in a short film produced by the Chiefs Network, called Chief's Kingdom, about his relationship with the Kansas City Chiefs. Mr. Chappell is also a past member of the Kansas City Chapter of the National Football League Alumni Association.\n\nAs a restauranteur, he held membership with the National Restaurant Association, the Missouri Restaurant Association, and the Kansas City Restaurant Association. His professional involvement also led him to serve as President of the North Kansas City Business Council. Mr. Chappell was also featured in the Hometown Heroes segment on local news station KMBZ, Channel 9. Outside of his professional affiliations, he is a patron of the arts and has maintained his membership with the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art since 1980 and with the Art Institute of Chicago since 1999.\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Chappell is a member of St. Patrick Catholic Church, the North Kansas City Hospital Auxiliary, the Kansas City Club, the American Legion Post 58, the Native Sons & Daughters of Greater Kansas City, and the Sons of the American Revolution, among various other organizations.

He won the prestigious Marconi Award for the large market personality of the year nationwide. Jim and Mike were good friends from Iowa and Jim was a regular on Mike's show. They referred to it at the “Southeast Iowa Show”. On occasion, Mike would do his show at Chappell's Restaurant. At one particular show, Mike got the idea to do a Chiefs Super Bowl Show (1969) and put Jim in charge of getting the players. The following is a quote from the Kansas City Star about the show:\n\n“Jim Chappell and Mike Murphy coaxed Otis Taylor, Len Dawson, Bobby Bell, Fred Arbanas, Ed Lothamer, Bobby Ply, Curt Merz, Bill Grigsby and other former Super Bowl Chiefs to join them at Chappell's Restaurant and Sports Museum in North Kansas City for Mike's Friday morning show. There is not enough space here to document, lies and love that filled those three hours. A more enjoyable use of the Marconi invention has yet to be invented.”\n\nKansas City Star\n\nJune 19, 1998\n\nMike said it was the best show they had ever had and immediately told Jim they should have a 1985 World Series Show. Jim got John Wathan, Danny Jackson, Jamie Quirk George Brett, Willie Wilson and several other Royals to do another great show at Chappell's.\n\nJim was a guest on several talk shows, but he always appreciated Mike's friendship and doing his shows best. He is still friends with Mike's nephew, Greg Schmidt (Meatsauce) as Mike nicknamed him. Some of the best times Jim, Mike and Greg had were the lunches after Murphy's show.\n\n​The Story of 98\n\nJim has long been known for his distinctive car with its distinctive license plate \"98.\" For four decades Jim has driven a succession of sleek black Jaguars. The story of that license plate points to Jim's role in the public life of Missouri and his standing as a champion of the state.\n\nTypically, Missouri license plates feature the formula of a total of six numbers and letters. The only exceptions are license plates that are simply numbered \"1\" through \"9999.\" These plates reflect the different levels of state government and are in principle assigned according to a set pattern. The single-digit plates are reserved for the Governor and other statewide officeholders. The two-digit numbers are controlled by the Governor, the three-digit numbers by State Senators, and the four-digit numbers by State Representatives. In practice the Governor plays the major role in assigning all two-, three-, and four-digit numbers. During the Governorship of Joe Teasdale these plates became lifelong possessions, regardless of changes in administration.\n\nIn his heyday in the first half of the twentieth century, Kansas City political boss Tom Pendergast used his connections to secure license plates 98, 99, and 100 for his personal use. At the time, the Missouri State Capitol was called \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" in reference to Pendergast's unparalleled political clout. When passers-by noted the characteristic license plate outside political offices in downtown Kansas City, or maybe outside Harry Truman's office on the Independence Square, they knew that Boss Pendergast was nearby.\n\nAs Jim rose in prominence in the public life of Missouri, he found himself in possession of Pendergast's old license plate \"98.\" This was a tribute to Jim's long career of public service and to his standing with state political leaders, especially Governor Christopher \"Kit\" Bond. Today Jim's license plate stands as a symbol of over a century of Missouri political tradition and also as a symbol of his own many decades as a pillar of the Show Me State. The distinctive \"98\" captures the spirit of Jim's keen sense of history and his long-standing dedication to public service.\n\n​CHARLES M. CHAPPELL & MacMURRAY COLLEGE\n\nIn 1850, my great great grandfather, Charles M. Chappell, gave for the time a sizable donation to the endowment of the Illinois Women's College. In appreciation, he was given a perpetual scholarship for all his heirs. The name was changed to MacMurray College in 1930 in honor of James E. MacMurray, who was an Illinois state senator, president of the Acme Steel Corporation in Chicago, and college trustee whose commitment led to a substantial increase in the college's facilities and endowment in the late 1920s and 1930s. The institution remained an exclusive women's college until 1955 when they accepted men.\n\nIn 2020, MacMurrray announced its plans to close at the end of the spring semester in May 2020. The college cited “declining enrollments, rising competitive costs and an insufficient endowment.”\n\nCharles M. Chappell's daughter, Amelia Chappell Rapp, graduated from Illinois Women's College. She was the only Chappell heir to use this scholarship in its 170 year history.\n\nAlice Birdsall: Legal Pioneer\n\nOne of Jim's (James Birdsall Chappell) most fascinating ancestors is the celebrated attorney Alice Mabeth Birdsall. Born in Waterloo, Iowa, in 1880, Alice had a prominent career in the law and public service in Arizona and California at a time when there were very few female attorneys. Her father and brother were attorneys, and she had worked as a legal clerk and stenographer before attending law school in Washington, D.C. at the Washington College of Law, which is now part of American University. She graduated from law school in 1912 after completing a three-year course of study in one year with the highest grade-point average in the school's history.\n\nThat same year Alice established her legal career in Arizona, where for years she was the only woman licensed to practice law. Later, in 1927, when she was licensed also to practice law in California, a story in the Los Angeles Times about her admission to the California bar identifies her as someone who had been considered for the governorship of Arizona. She served as treasurer of the Arizona State Bar Association, and served for over a decade as official reporter of decisions for the Arizona Supreme Court, a capacity in which she compiled and published 26 volumes of decisions by the court. In the courtroom, Alice was a wily and determined advocate. One prominent Arizona attorney is reported to have said he would just as soon be facing any other attorney besides Alice Birdsall. Her trailblazing work in bankruptcy law earned her an appointment to the American Bar Association Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy.\n\nIn addition to her legal practice, Alice was an important contributor to public life. She lobbied for decades to secure women's right to serve on juries in Arizona, with ultimate success coming in 1945. Early in her career she worked hard to promote women's suffrage, serving an instrumental role in Arizona's ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. During World War I, she served as chair of the Women's Liberty Loan Committee, and wound up raising fully half of all Liberty Loan money raised in Arizona. In 1920-one year after ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment-she served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, which nominated James Cox for president and Franklin D. Roosevelt for vice-president.\n\nHaving started her legal practice at the time Arizona entered the union as a state in 1912, Alice remained active in her legal career well into her seventies, retiring only a few months before her death in 1958. She is still remembered as a pillar of the legal world and an icon of women's achievement in professional life. In honor of her legacy she was enshrined in the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nJim can remember speaking with Aunt Alice over the phone when she would call the family in Keokuk from Arizona. She was a delightful conversationalist, and a source of encouragement and inspiration. She was especially careful to encourage Jim's education, and left a legacy to support Jim's studies at Drury University. In a tradition begun by Jim's mother Pauline and carried on at Drury by art professor Edith West, Alice Birdsall was one of those remarkable women whose inspiration and belief in Jim propelled him to pursue his dreams.\n\nThe contribution of the Birdsall family to public life is embodied in Roger Birdsall Memorial Park in Cedar Falls, Iowa, named after Alice's brother and fellow attorney Roger. The golf courses and gorgeous grounds of Birdsall Park offer testimony to the accomplishments of this family, which stands in the leading ranks of the legal profession and public life across several states. Today the tradition is carried on by Jim's daughter Michele Ann Chappell Pato in New Mexico, whose distinguished legal career spans work in government and in the private sector. Alice would be proud.\n\nLearn more here: Alice M Birdsall: Arizona Women Hall of Fame\n\nKeokuk YMCA State Basketball Champions\n\nIn 1960, the Iowa State YMCA recognized there were some good basketball players who did not play for their respective high schools. Because of this, they organized a YMCA state basketball tournament. Keokuk entered the tournament with Ronnie Hinman, Johnny Sammons, Richard Bell, Gary McLaughlin and Jim Chappell as their starting lineup. The first game was against Burlington, which had two all-state caliber players who were suspended from their high school team. We beat them in overtime and went on to win the rest of the games to become the YMCA State Champions. The trophy was displayed at the Keokuk YMCA for many years.\n\n​Jim Chappell: A Good Sport and Great Scholar\n\nApril 17, 2011 by Pete Dulin\n\n​\n\nSeated at a table, Jim Chappell opens a book of poetry and begins to read in a deep baritone. His finger scans the lines like a narrow spotlight illuminating the page. His voice warms to the words and revels in the rhythm and alliteration. The periphery of the room melts away, the banter of voices and drone of a television fade, and Chappell’s table transforms into a stage.\n\nOnce upon a midnight dreary,\n\nwhile I pondered weak and weary,\n\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping,\n\nsuddenly there came a tapping,\n\nAs of some one gently rapping,\n\nrapping at my chamber door.\n\n”Tis some visiter,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door –\n\nOnly this, and nothing more.”\n\nChappell’s impromptu recitation breathes vigor into Edgar Allen Poe’s famous poem, The Raven, which was published over 150 years ago. “Isn’t that a great line?” he asks, referring to the opening. He marvels at Poe’s choice of words with the delight of a scholar, then leans back in his chair.\n\nThe presence of the room seeps into the moment, filled with football helmets, pennants, trophies, and sports memorabilia collected over many years. At Chappell’s Restaurant in North Kansas City, guests dine on classic American fare, discuss politics and sports, or mind the television as it broadcasts a football game. Named after the owner, Chappell’s celebrated its twentieth anniversary on November 24, 2006. Both owner and restaurant have received ample recognition for the voluminous collection of sports memorabilia that covers the walls and ceiling. The Kansas City Star, USA Today, Sport Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and many other publications have written articles or bestowed awards on Chappell’s as one of the best sports bars in America. Or sports museum, as Chappell prefers to call his establishment. In fact, guests won’t encounter glaring wide screen televisions, a limited menu of cheap fried bar food, and numerous guys in T-shirts found in most sports bars. Chappell’s is an uncommon place that is easily miscast, much like the owner. While he has been heralded for this popular repository of sports artifacts and his vast knowledge of its contents, few people know about the other side of Jim Chappell.\n\nA Remarkable Mind\n\nBorn in Keokuk, Iowa, Chappell lived there during his young life until he left to attend college at Drury University in Springfield, Missouri and earned a degree in art. The young man grew up in a house filled with 5,000 books, supplying Chappell’s inquisitive mind with ample material to read every night as he still does today. His father, Charles, often strolled around the house and read poetry and literature aloud. “My dad would recite The Raven. I recited Tennyson’s Charge of the Light Brigrade for my grandmother,” he says.\n\nEven today, Chappell demonstrates the ability to recall a wide range of poetry, facts, and stories drawn from his extensive reading and travels. His library at home contains 2,500 books. He recently read Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln’s Killer by James L. Swanson. Chappell re-reads classic works of literature on a regular basis, but also consumes biographies and art books on figures in literature, art, politics, and history. He displays a fascination with people and places such as Dorothy Parker, the famed Algonquin Round Table, Gertrude Stein, and the ex-patriots that lived in Europe.\n\n“How would you like to be in Gertrude Stein’s living room with all these people from the Twenties? The Lost Generation of Fitzgerald, Pound, Woolf, Eliot, Hemingway…Stein named them ‘The Lost Generation’ after World War I and the Depression. These people were kind of lost and saw the horrors of war,” says Chappell.\n\nAs he speaks, Chappell looks like a tall, rugged scholar with close-cropped gray hair in casual attire. He pauses frequently to greet or bid goodbye to guests and local characters passing by the bar. A gold ring adorns his left hand as a symbol of his forty-year marriage to his wife Gina. They have two married daughters, Christina and Michelle.\n\nSports Man\n\nA commemorative ring from Super Bowl IV in 1970, when the Kansas City Chiefs prevailed over the Minnesota Vikings, sparkles on Chappell’s right hand. It is the only obvious reference to sports that he wears regularly. The restaurant itself serves as a visual embodiment of sports in all shapes and forms. Chappell is a life-long collector and curator of knowledge, objects, and anecdotes. The museum, which he decorated himself, is a testament to sports acquisitions, purchases, and donations assembled over two decades. Naturally, he selects his customers as his favorite “thing” about the place.\n\nAs an icebreaker, Chappell will sometimes ask a visitor where he or she went to school. If the college or university has a sports team, then Chappell can usually point at a piece of related memorabilia in the restaurant. Thousands of collegiate and professional football helmets hang from the ceiling. A quick glance at the rafters uncovers old boxing gloves, wooden golf clubs above the bar, a photo of Chappell with Joe Montana, historic images of Babe Ruth, and baseball jerseys for the New York Yankees, former St. Louis Browns, Washington Senators, and Philadelphia Athletics, a team that moved to Kansas City in 1955 and headed to Oakland thirteen years later. The late, great Buck O’Neil signed a panoramic photograph of the Kansas City Monarchs Negro League Baseball team displayed in the back dining room. The list of notable sports achievers, well-known and obscure, goes on––photos of Hank Aaron, Royal third baseman George Brett, and KC Monarch Alfred “Slick” Surratt. Another signed photo depicts All-Star Alice ”Lefty” Hohlmeyer, who pitched and played first base for the Kenosha Comets from 1946-51, was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988, and was one of the many women who inspired the Hollywood film, A League of Their Own.\n\nFood\n\nEven for non-sports enthusiasts, the establishment is an authentic slice of Americana that could never be reproduced like the faux historic hodge-podge décor of chain restaurants found across the metropolitan area. Chappell’s represents a history that lives beyond sheer statistics, controversies like drug use in sports, and the merchandising machine of the NFL, NBA, and MLB. If you don’t know or don’t care what those acronyms mean, it’s okay.\n\nChappell’s offers more than a stroll down sports memory lane. He launched the place as a political/sports bar in 1986, but eventually emphasized the sports aspect with a casual dining concept that has proven a winner ever since. The restaurant has grown from 65 to 235 seats and features a private banquet room.\n\nThe restaurant serves hearty, quality food from prime rib to all-American hamburgers. Chappell maintains that he couldn’t stay in business as a restaurant, especially for twenty years, if the food weren’t good. “I lot of people come for the memorabilia, but come back for the food. It’s more of a restaurant than a sports bar,” he says.\n\nFamilies dine here in droves, partaking of a menu diverse enough to handle hearty appetites, health-conscious diets, and the finicky taste of kids. The menu does not strive for fussy innovation or cutting edge culinary surprises. Guests can order down-home and familiar favorites like chicken Caesar salad, steak soup, charbroiled chicken or salmon, steamed vegetables, a 12-ounce Kansas City strip, London broil, burgers, tenderloins, chicken fingers, and Philly steak sandwiches, for example. Signature desserts include a Snickers bar ice cream pie, apple caramel walnut cobbler, and a classic old-fashioned root beer float.\n\nScholar\n\nAlthough his reputation for sports knowledge and memorabilia precedes him, the restaurant owner’s interest in arts and culture receives far less attention. Chappell exhibits a sense of satisfaction in mentally gathering and sharing a wealth of information about poetry, books, painters, and distant locales to people of like mind.\n\n“People look at me and would never guess I was into poetry. I’m an artist and I can tell you how many times Stan Musial won the batting title,” states Chappell. He waits a beat. \"seven” Moments later, he lists Emily Dickinson as his favorite poet, then recites the first stanza of a beloved poem, “Because I Could Not Stop for Death,” from memory.\n\nBecause I could not stop for Death,\n\nHe kindly stopped for me;\n\nThe carriage held but just ourselves\n\nAnd Immortality.\n\nChappell’s love for literature and poetry came from his family, but he nurtured a natural interest in art. ”Art came easy for me,” he says.\n\nChappell graduated from college with a degree in art. He continues to read and traveled extensively to sate his appetite for learning. The classic Greek and Roman art and modern conceptual works don’t impress him much, but he admires nearly all other major art periods. He has visited fifty states and forty-five countries, exploring museums and galleries such as the Louvre in Paris and Modern Museum of Modern Art in New York. Chappell does not simply spout information about an artist or period or poet. He offers a considered opinion and interpretation with the unassuming air of a friendly historian. ”I like the Renaissance, Pop Art by Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns, Baroque, and the Impressionists. Everyone likes Impressionism now, but back then, no one liked it. The artist started their own salons to exhibit work,” says Chappell.\n\nWhen asked what living artist or poet he would like to meet, Chappell pauses, flips pages in a book of poetry, and thinks. He muses out loud, truly contemplating the weight of his choice, and finally rationalizes an answer with keen insight. “I might be surprised by somebody, but would probably be disappointed. There are not going to be as good as their work,” says Chappell. “Dickinson was a recluse. I would like to meet her though. If I was guaranteed that they’d be like I thought they’d be, then I’d want to meet them.”\n\nOf course, there are no such guarantees in life or death. Chappell wrestles less with the next question that he proposes. If he could pick somebody to come back from the dead to meet again, who would it be? He answers with certainty and forethought, “My dad. He saw me as a brat. He died at 54 from a heart attack. I wished he could have seen what I have become. He would have been proud of me and this place,” says Chappell.\n\nThe admission is touching when it comes from this savvy businessman, family man, sports historian, and modest intellectual. Jim Chappell sees himself through a different prism than his loyal customers and a staff that wears commemorative shirts for the anniversary. He talks about his biggest regrets even when seemingly surrounded by the trappings of success.\n\n“I didn’t take more chances. When I took a big chance like opening this place, I succeeded,” says Chappell, gauging one measure of his life. “I’ve always taken the safe route. It’s a fear of failure. I still have it when I think about doing something else. It’s kind of odd because everyone sees me as successful. The truth is, no one sees himself as successful. I’ve done a lot, I guess.”\n\nThis last remark is an understatement, depending on how one looks at life. He jokes about his marriage of forty years being an accomplishment for his wife. Chappell is proud of his two daughters. He has served as chairman or member of numerous boards and commissions in politics, arts, and banking. He can rattle off a list of celebrities that he has met in this line of work––sports greats like George Brett, Joe Montana, Marcus Allen, Brooks Robinson; the artist Leroy Nieman; country music star Vince Gill; and countless state and local politicians that come through and shake hands with customers.\n\nChappell’s is the kind of place where athletes and aesthetes and politicians can cross paths with everyday folk. The restaurant owner still enjoys giving young kids a piece of memorabilia, like a signed foam baseball, to take home, only to see them come back as a grown adult, introduce themselves, and say, “I remember when…”\n\nStatistics and signed baseballs tell only part of the story in sports. Similarly, the living legacy of Jim Chappell is not easy to distill based on the colorful confines of his famous restaurant, the rankings as one of the top sports bars in the country, or the collective memories of his friends and patrons.\n\nChappell cites a poem by John Donne, Death Be Not Proud, as another one of his favorites that discusses how not to be afraid of death. The selection seems to reflect an important characteristic about this man. Despite his self-portrayal as someone that didn’t take more chances, a more fitting emphasis is his willingness to seek opportunities – in art, literature, travel, sport, politics, business, and family – as a champion of life.\n\n2018 SALE OF CHAPPELL'S RESTAURANT & SPORTS MUSEUM\n\nJim sold Chappell's Restaurant & Sports Museum in 2018 to David M. Block, a renown commercial real estate developer and broker. Although Jim sold the restaurant, he still remains extremely active and involved with the restaurant. You can find him there chatting with customers and giving tours of the memorabilia on almost a daily basis.\n\nFamily Biographies and Obituaries\n\nChappell Birdsall and Simpson Families\n\n​​CHARLES BIRDSALL CHAPPELL\n\nCharles Birdsall Chappell, 54, of 216 High Street, widely known Keokuk real estate broker, died in his sleep at about 1 o’clock this morning in his home.

The funeral will be held Thursday at 2 p.m. in St. John’s Episcopal Church with burial in Oakland cemetery. The body will remain at the Schmidt Memorial Home until time for the service.\n\n​ DEATH OF CHARLES M. CHAPPELL\n\n​ Among our older and highly respected fellow citizens, few are better known than Mr. Charles Chappell, and the news of his death will be a shock to all his friends, as it comes so unexpectedly. For over forty years, Mr. Chappell has been a resident of our city, and has always borne a most excellent character. He was a hard working, energetic, industrious man, whose business integrity was never doubted by anyone, whose Christian convections were firm, and character consistent. In religious matter, he was not of a demonstrative nature, but earnest and sincere.\n\n​ Although 68 years of age, having been born in Onondaga County, New York, December 23, 1808, he has almost up to the day of his death been actively engaged in business and has been in comparatively good health. He died at 1 o’clock in the morning after suffering from a fever. Funeral services will be held at the family residence on East College Avenue, conducted by the Rev. George Stevens, this morning at 10:00 o’clock.\n\n​ Mr. Chappell leaves a widow and six children of his own, and one step-son. (Jacksonville, Ill., newspaper. Died 05 February 1877)\n\nELIZA A. CHAPPELL\n\nMrs. Eliza Ann Church Chappell died at the residence of Mr. George B. Schureman, her son-in-law, on East North street yesterday afternoon at 4 o’clock of cancer, from which she had been suffering for many years. Mrs. Chappell had been a resident of Jacksonville since 1827, and was the sole surviving member of Centenary church, of those who participated in its organization. Mrs. Chappell was 72 years of age and was the mother of a large family of children. Further notice will be given of the time of holding the funeral. (Jacksonville, Ill., newspaper; 20 November 1884) (Died 19 November 1884)\n\nCHARLES CHURCH CHAPPELL FAMILY\n\nCharles Church Chappell was born in 1849, in Jacksonville, Illinois, the son of Charles M. and Eliza Ann (Church).Graves Chappell.\n\nHis father, Charles M. was born on 23 December 1808, in Onondaga County, New York, and came to Jacksonville, Illinois, around 1835. The origins of the Chappell family are unknown, but research indicates that Charles’ ancestors settled in New England in the early part of the 17th century, and his father and grandfather may have been members of the Chappell branch that migrated to Onondaga County, New York after the Revolutionary War.\n\nHis mother, Eliza Ann Church, the daughter of Thomas and Jane (Gibbon) Church, was born 18 April 1813, in Lexington, Kentucky, and came with her family to Morgan County, Illinois, in 1827. Her father was a soldier in the War of 1812. She married George W. Graves on 22 October 1829, and they had one son before his death.\n\nThe length of the courtship between Charles M. Chappell and the young widow is unknown, but they were married by John Barger, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church on 23 August 1836.\n\nChildren born to Charles and Eliza were:\n\nMary Jane, circa 1837;\n\nAlonzo Barger, 16 March 1839;\n\nFrancis C., 24 November 1842;\n\nSarah W., circa 1843;\n\nAmelia, 05 April 1847;\n\nand Charles Church in 1849.\n\nThe 1850 Morgan County, Illinois, census lists the senior Charles’ occupation as shoemaker, but he may have had varied business interests. He owned property in his own right and his name appears on several deeds with his brother-in-law, Levi Church. He was one of the founders of the Republican Party in Morgan County in 1853, and a contributor to the permanent endowment of the Illinois Conference Female College in 1857. The college is now known as MacMurray College, and this Chappell family holds a perpetual tuition scholarship as a result of this sizable contribution. Eliza Ann was also active in community affairs, and since she was one of the early organizers of the Centenary Methodist Episcopal Church, may have influenced the contribution.\n\nCharles M. Chappell died suddenly at the age of 68, on 05 February 1877, and Eliza Ann Chappell died of cancer on 19 November 1884 at the age of 71.\n\nYoung Charles received the affection and attention often enjoyed by the youngest child in a large family, and the paternalism that goes with it. His older sisters worried over his boyish ways and lack of interest in school work. His early years were spent in Jacksonville, but before he was of age he made a trip to the West, and spent some time in Idaho. His Western travels may have been influenced by his older brother, Alonzo who crossed the plains with a wagon train in 1861, and “located” about the mining camps at Deer Lodge, Butte and Virginia City, Montana, for four of five years.\n\nHow much time Charles spent in the West, or how long he remained in Jacksonville after this trip is unknown, but around 1875, he went to New York City where he became a successful stockbroker and businessman. A bachelor most of his time in New York, he continued to travel extensively in the United States and abroad. Presumably, the two brothers, Alonzo and Charles kept in contact, and visited each other. Alonzo wrote to his son, Jesse McKee Chappell, on stationary from the Petroleum Club in New York in the 1870’s.\n\nCharles was evidently the playboy of the family. Mary Birdsall Chappell related in later years that on one visit Charles brought a “lady friend” which upset his family a lot. On the other hand, Charles had picked up a good education and during one of these visits, he set his sisters right on grammar and other facts.\n\nWhatever the case, Charles’ bachelor years ended in 1892, when he married Lucy Worth Kline in New York City. The family lived in a mansion on Fifth Avenue and Charles continued to prosper. Three children were born to Charles and Lucy: Helen Eliza, in 1893, Charlotte on 09 August 1898, and Ruth Katherine in 1900.\n\nThe stock market was a risky business in the 1890’s, and the Chappell fortunes were adversely affected, because of the Panic of 1893, By the end of the century, Charles had decided to leave New York, and traveled all over the West seeking the ideal place for a permanent home.\n\nAfter visiting Ashland in Southern Oregon’s Rogue Valley, he wrote to his brother, Alonzo: “I have found the ideal spot which I have been seeking. It is Ashland, Oregon.” He sold his New York mansion on Fifth Avenue and brought all his elegant furnishings and moved to Ashland with his wife, and three young daughters.\n\nBy 1901, he had purchased fractional lots 21, 22, and 23, in Miner’s Addition of the City of Ashland, and the family lived in the house which still stands at the intersecting corner of Siskiyou Boulevard, Iowa Street and Mountain Avenue.\n\nCharles apparently believed in the future of Ashland, as he began purchasing property in 1903, which was then on the southeast edge of town. He also became active in politics, and promoted public improvements.\n\nIn 1903, Charles C. Chappell commissioned architect Frank Clark to build a beautiful home in the middle of an orchard, the result was the Chappell-Swedenburg House, which still stands on the corner of Siskiyou Boulevard and Mountain Avenue. It was placed on the National Register of Historical Landmarks in 1982. The cost of the home was exorbitant. Ashland residents thought it was folly to build such a expensive home in the middle of an orchard. The Ashland Daily Tidings wrote: “He built for himself the handsomest residence building, without doubt, in Southern Oregon.”\n\nMs. Grace Milam Flint, who lived on Mountain Avenue as a child, said, “It was like being in Fairyland to wander through this house.”\n\nIn a Letter to the Editor, published in the Ashland Daily Tidings in 1966, Ms. Flint wrote that Charles practically watched every nail that was driven in each board. “I can still see him standing up on the roof when the bricklayers were building the huge chimney. My father was so worried that he would lose his balance and fall.”\n\nOnly the finest materials went into the house, Ms. Flint wrote, and a barn was erected that was as beautifully built as the house. When the construction was completed, the exquisite furnishings, collected by Charles during his travels and brought from the New York home, were placed in the house. The family occupied the home in the spring of 1904.\n\nMs. Flint and the oldest Chappell daughter, Helen, were friends and playmates, and so she was able to wander freely through the house. She wrote that the house was her introduction to beautiful furnishings and antiques, fine Havilind China and crystal, gorgeous Persian and Oriental rugs, and other treasures too numerous to mention.\n\nThe family has a driving horse called Barney, a darling fat little Shetland pony called Belle, and the cutest little pony cart. The also had a fat old white shorthaired dog named, Duke. It was a time of fun and excitement for the Chappell family. The family was settled into their new home, and Charles was serving his second year as a City Councilman from the ward of South Ashland.\n\nBut it was not to last for Charles C. Chappell. On 31 July 1905, he died from heart failure. He had suffered from heart trouble for about two years, but it was not considered serious until three months before his death, when he was critically ill and had to be treated in San Francisco. He had been confined to his home three weeks preceding his death, and it was obvious the final week of his life that he was very sick. His wife, Lucy, telegraphed his brother, Alonzo, who arrived two days before his younger brother’s death. The brother’s arrival seemed to cheer Charles up, but on the evening of the 31st, Charles died while the two brothers were talking.\n\nHis death was a loss to both his family and the City of Ashland. At the time of his death, he had six valuable pieces of property, excluding the lots on which the house was built. This property included land on which Ashland High School and much of Southern Oregon State College now stands.\n\nLucy Cline Chappell was only 34 at the time of her husband’s death. She was attractive and described in the Chappell family as a very “genteel” lady. There isn’t any indication, however, that she had any experience in handling financial affairs, or was prone to economize since it had never been necessary. She was now faced not only with the responsibility of raising three young girls, but of maintaining a household and standard of living that required considerable resources by the standards of the time. Lucy petitioned the County Court and was appointed Administratrix for the estate and guardian of Helen, Charlotte and Ruth in September of 1905.\n\nIn her petition, Lucy requested a monthly sum to maintain the family, and exclusion of personal property, which under the law would be exempt, for the convenience and support of the family during the administration. She also petitioned the court for an order of the sale of real estate, and the intent to sell said real estate for cash was published in the Ashland Daily Tidings as prescribed by law beginning on 20 December 1905.\n\nWhether the financial matters could have been handled better, is a matter of speculation. Despite the descriptions of Mr. Chappell’s wealth, and his purchases of land, there isn’t any indication of his occupation, or sources of income, after arriving in Ashland, except for his position on the city council and investment income.\n\nLucy W. Chappell re-married. Her husband was George F. Wilson, manager of the Western Union Telegraph office in Ashland. They were married at Trinity Episcopal Church on 30 April 1908.\n\nWhile there was little mention of the social activities of the Chappell family in the local paper in the years preceding Mr. Chappell’s death, numerous items on the George Wilson’s and the Chappell girls appeared in the Ashland Tidings between the years 1905 and 1912.\n\nThe marriage, however, was not exactly happy, and the family’s financial fortunes were dependent upon the sale of real estate. Ms. Flint wrote that Lucy was forced to sell some of the household treasures to help meet expenses and maintain the home.\n\nBy the end of 1908, all of the real estate had been sold and the estate closed. The family continued to live in the handsome Georgian style residence since it and the household items were exempt from probate, and the lots were apparently deeded to Helen, Charlotte and Ruth in June of 1903. George Wilson and Lucy appear to have come to some kind of agreement in May of 1912. She began to refer to herself and Mrs. Lucy Wilson rather than Mrs.\n\nGeorge F. Wilson, and Mr. Wilson granted her power of attorney during the same month because of difficulties in acting together. Lucy had established a home in San Francisco, although the Chappell house in Ashland was maintained. The whereabouts of George Wilson, after he left the Western Union office in 1912, are sketchy, but he did not reside in the house on Siskiyou Boulevard after 1913.\n\nLucy eventually moved to San Francisco, where she maintained a spacious apartment, until about 1931, when she returned to Ashland to reside with the Victoria Taverner family. She had Paget’s disease, and had been staying with her daughter, Charlotte, who was a nurse, in San Francisco, but her sharp tongue and Charlotte’s strong willed husband, Dr. Stanley Mentzer, were bound to clash. He told her she could not stay with them. Lucy and Victoria Taverner had always been friends and so Lucy came back to Ashland for the last ten years of her life. She died on 20 October 1941, at the Taverner home, 912 Siskiyou Boulevard, and was buried next to her husband, Charles, in Mountain View Cemetery.\n\nThere is an element of tragedy in the story of Charles C. Chappell and his grand house on the Boulevard. After putting so much effort in constructing such a fine home for his family, he died within 18 months of its completion. The home was an enchanting place for young girls to live, and the social functions reported in the newspapers indicate that there were happy times. However, it was only seven years after Mr. Chappell’s death that the family began to reside part of the time in San Francisco and by 1919, the family spent more time in San Francisco and less in Ashland. Standing empty most of the time, maintenance was neglected.\n\nWhether it was Ruth’s marriage in June of 1919, or the impracticality trying to maintain an expensive, but seldom used home, that influenced the final decision is not known, but on 22 September 1919, the deed transferring the property to Dr. Francis G. Swedenburg and his wife was recorded at the County Court House. Less than 16 years after its construction, Charles C. Chappell’s house had passed from the Chappell family.\n\nWILSON FUNERAL PLANNED THURSDAY\n\nLucy Worth Kline Chappell Wilson passed away Oct. 20, 1941 at 912 Siskiyou boulevard. Funeral services will be held at the Episcopal church 10 a.m. Thursday, with Dr. C.E. Sayre in charge. Mrs. Wilson was well-known here, having lived in this community at various times throughout her life. She was born Oct. 14, 1869, in New York City, N.Y. She is survived by her husband George F. Wilson, and three daughters, Mrs. Charles Newton Lathrop of Newport, R.I., Mrs. Stanley Mentzer, of San Francisco, and Mrs. Frank B. Montanye of Tacoma Park, Maryland. She was preceded in death by her first husband, Charles Church Chappell. Mrs. Mentzer arrived yesterday and Mrs. Lathrop arrived by plane this afternoon. J.P. Dodge and Sons are the funeral directors in charge. (Ashland Daily Tidings, 22 October 1941)\n\nWILSON FUNERAL HELD THIS A.M.\n\nFuneral services for Lucy Wilson were held at 10 o’clock this morning in the Trinity Episcopal church. Dr. Claude E. Savre officiated.\n\nMrs. Stanley Mentzer of San Francisco and Mrs. Charles N. Lathrop from Newport, Rhode Island, arrived by plane last night to attend the funeral of their mother.\n\n​ Pallbearers were Homer Billings, Fred Engle, Clyde Dunham, and W.H. McNair.

(Ashland Daily Tidings, 23 October 1941)\n\nALONZO BARGER CHAPPELL\n\nAlonzo Barger Chappell, affectionately known as “Lon”, for 21 years a highly respected resident and business man of Independence, passed away Tuesday evening, May 20, at 9 o’clock at his home in the Third Ward.\n\nMr. Chappell had not been well for the past year. Early last winter he was very ill for a time, but recuperated and this spring was able to be out, at his place of business, felt better than he had for many months and attended to the planting of his garden, but three weeks ago he was taken with a cold and continued to decline until death came, though he was confined to his bed for only a few days before. His death was due to a general breakdown of the system. About 15 years ago, Mr. Chappell was operated on for cancer. Since that time, he had worried more or less and this condition doubtless impaired his health. Before that he had been a strong, rugged man. The funeral services were conducted this afternoon at 2:30 o’clock from the residence of the Third Ward. Rev. Henry L.A. Fisk, of St. James Episcopal church, officiated. Burial was in Oakwood cemetery. The pallbearers were Messrs. S.A. Wilson, L.B. Young, A.N. Todd, A.G. Rigby, W.C. Simpson and D.F. Logan.\n\nMr. Chappell was born in Jacksonville, Ill. He was the son of Charles and Eliza Chappell. The date of his birth was March 16, 1839. He lived in Jacksonville, until 1861, when he crossed the plains with a wagon train and was located in and about the mining camps at Deer Lodge, Butte, and Virginia city, Mont…for four or five years, then returning the Jacksonville. On July 9, 1867, he was untied in marriage to Miss Sarah Rebecca McKee of Keokuk, Iowa.\n\nHe is survived by his widow, Sarah McKee Chappell and two sons, Postmaster Harry Church Chappell of Independence and Jesse McKee Chappell of Iola, Kan. The latter arrived Tuesday morning and was at the bedside of his father when he passed away. In 1892, Mr. Chappell and family moved to this city and here he had since made his home. For a year after coming here he was engaged in farming south of the Hospital. Later, for several years he and Arthur Morgan, now of Chicago, were engaged in the livery business in the old Trask barn on Third Avenue, N.E. Afterward Mr. Chappell conducted a fair store at the stand now occupied by the McEwen drugstore. He was engaged in the real estate business here more or less all the time since coming to Independence, being associated with H.T. Lynch, practically all the time in one way or another. For several years he and his son; Jesse Mckee Chappell, comprised the Hawkeye Land company, with offices over the Tabor drugstore, and Mr. Chappell, Sr., conducted that business until his death. Besides his devoted widow and two sons, Mr. Chappell leaves to mourn his death two sisters, Mesdames Amelia Rapp and Mrs. James Craig, both of Woodson, Ill., and three grandchildren, Church Chappell, of this city, and Maybeth and Charles B. Chappell, of Iola, Kan.\n\nDuring his long residence here, Mr. Chappell won a wide friendship and acquaintance. He was a quiet, unassuming man, attended to his own affairs, was devoted to his home and family, fair and square in his dealings with his fellow man, and in all ways a good citizen, a real friend and neighbor. In politics, he was an ardent Republican. His familiar figure upon our streets, where he had for so long been seen, will be sadly missed by everyone who knew him, and they unite in extending to his sorrowing widow, children and other relatives a genuine sympathy. (Independence, Iowa, newspaper, May 1913)\n\nALONZO BARGER CHAPPELL\n\nAlonzo Barger Chappell dies at his home in the third ward Tuesday evening after an illness of but three days. Mr. Chappell had been ailing for about two years, and was taken worse early last winter, at that time being confined to his bed for several days. He rallied from this, and up to about two weeks ago has been quite well. He caught some cold at that time and since Saturday has been confined to his bed.\n\nAlonzo Barger Chappell was born in Jacksonville, Ill., March 16, 1839, which place was his home till 1867. He was one of the early pioneers who endured the hardships of crossing the country when it was new by wagon train about the year 1860. July 9, 1867, he was united in marriage to Sarah Rebecca McKee, at Keokuk, Iowa, and here he made his home till 1892 when he came to Independence. For a time he was connected in the livery business here with Art Morgan. Later he became interested in real estate, and has, for most of the time for the past 15 years been associated H.T. Lynch in this business. Mr. Chappell leaves a wife, two sons, and two sisters who have the heartfelt sympathy of all. The sons are Jesse M. Chappell of Iola, Kan., and Postmaster Harry Chappell of this city. The sisters are Mrs. Amelia Rapp and Mrs. James Craig of Woodson, Ill.\n\nMr. Chappell was a man of sterling traits of character, honorable, socialable, and a good man in the relations of life. He leaves many friends to mourn his death. The funeral will be held at the house on Thursday afternoon at 2:30 o’clock with burial at Oak Grove cemetery. (Independence, Iowa, newspaper, May 1913)\n\nALONZO BARGER CHAPPELL PASSED AWAY\n\nFormer Well Known Resident of Keokuk Died at His Home at Independence Iowa\n\nONLY MEAGER DETAILS\n\nVisited Keokuk Periodically and Always Received a Warm Welcome From All Classes\n\nFriends in the city have received the announcement of the death of Alonzo Barger Chappell, who will be well remembered as a former old citizen of Keokuk, and familiarly known as “Lon” Chappell. He was born in or in the vicinity of Jacksonville, Ill., and came to Keokuk many years ago. He was a man of many likeable qualities and he had a large circle of friends in the city. He married Miss Rebecca McKee of this vicinity. For a few years, he conducted a popular billiard hall on Main street, and then purchased a large farm near New Boston in this county which he conducted for two years and then returned to Keokuk, owning his residence property on Concert street. Later, he purchased a beautiful tract of land out on 2007 Grand Avenue and built an attractive resident on the end of the land nearest town, at about Nineteenth street. He sold a parcel of this tract at the farthest end of these holdings to Mrs. Cox, who built a summer home with other improvements. Later, Mr. Chappell removed to Independence, Iowa, where he continued to live until his death.\n\nThere have been no details received of his last illness, except that his friends in Keokuk knew he was suffering from a dangerous ailment. It seemed that the commencement of this of this sickness was a severe cold which produced a more dangerous illness, which prevented him from partaking sufficient nourishment to sustain life. For a time, he lingered, and at last death claimed him.\n\nMany old friends in Keokuk who know him so well will be pained to learn of this death. After going to Independence, he frequently returned to Keokuk and always found a warm welcome from all classes. He was prominent in the organization of the old Free-for-all church here which for a time was a popular and prominent institution in the city in the latter part of the 70’s in the past century. Rev. John Burgess conducted the services of the organization and was very successful in gaining the objects for which it was organized and the early organizers and attendants were very zealous in the promotion of its progress.\n\nMr. Chappell is survived by his wife and two sons, Harry Church and Jesse Mckee Chappell. He was past 75 years of age. It is believed the funeral and burial will take place at Independence, though nothing definite has been received here on that subject.

LATHROP DEAD ON VISIT TO COAST\n\nSocial Service Executive of the Episcopal Church Was a Friend of Roosevelt\n\nLEADER IN PRISON REFORM\n\nSuccumbs to Pneumonia While in San Francisco for Diocesan Convention Next Week\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 30, 1931 (AP) – The Rev. Dr. Charles Newton Lathrop of New York, one of the most prominent clergymen of the Protestant Episcopal Church, died of pneumonia here this afternoon in St. Luke’s Hospital. Dr. Lathrop, executive secretary of the Department of Christian Social Service of the Church, had come here to speak at the Diocesan Convention next week.\n\nHe was born in San Francisco Nov. 16, 1871, and was rector of the Church of the Advent here from 1904 to 1916. He was dean of All Saints’ Cathedral in Milwaukee from 1917 to 1920.\n\nHe married Helen Elisa Chappell Jan. 7, 1919. They had one son, Charles Robert Lathrop born October 24, 1919..\n\nOrganized Social Service Work\n\nDr. Lathrop came to New York in the Spring of 1920 after his election to the post in which he continued until his death. He organized the Department of Christian Social Service and later attained national recognition for his efforts to bring about, under church offices, closer relations between capital and labor. He was identified also with the promotion of church work in the rural and isolated sections of the country, the organization of a school of social service for the clergy and the reform of American jails.\n\nSeveral years ago during a conference on special service in Memphis, Dr. Lathrop had himself locked up in the city jail to acquaint himself with conditions from the inside, and produced a sensation at the General Convention at Washington, in 1928, when he declared publicly that “if a score of the Bishops of the Episcopal Church could be locked up in the average American jail for two or three weeks, I think there is no doubt that there would quickly follow needed reform in the administration of our jails.”\n\nBefore joining the staff of the Episcopal Church at national headquarters, Dr. Lathrop was closely identified with his friend Herbert Hoover in the work of Belgian relief in the early stages of the World War. From the outbreak of hostilities until the United States entered the conflict he was in charge under Mr. Hoover of the important work centering around Liege. Herbert Hoover who went on to be the 31st President of the United States.\n\nAt an earlier period he had been identified with Frances Heeney in the campaign against lawlessness in San Francisco. The Citizens League for Justice which did much to clean up conditions in San Francisco after the fire of 1908, was organized in Dean Lathrop’s study.\n\nHe was a close friend of Theodore Roosevelt. In the days of Roosevelt’s Presidency, Dr. Lathrop received one night after midnight, a special delivery letter from the hands of "
