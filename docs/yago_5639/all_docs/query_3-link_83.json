        "text": "A star of the beloved sitcom Only Fools and Horses looks like they’ve barely aged since the show ended over 20 years ago.\n\nFirst hitting screens in 1981, Only Fools was set in working-class Peckham in south-east London and starred Sir David Jason as ambitious market trader Derek ‘Del Boy’ Trotter and Nicholas Lyndhurst as his younger half-brother Rodney Trotter.\n\nOne of the other characters who debuted in the series’ sixth series in 1989 was Cassandra Parry, who was played by Gwyneth Strong.\n\nCassandra first met her future husband Rodney in the episode Yuppy Love and they eventually married just a few episodes later.\n\nAfter the couple battled break-ups for about a year after getting hitched, they then managed to patch things up and remained together by the time Only Fools and Horses wrapped in 2003.\n\nAlthough Gwyneth went on to appear in shows including Casualty, Doctors, New Tricks and Midsomer Murders, her last role was on EastEnders in 2016.\n\nThe actress doesn’t appear to have any active social media accounts, but fans have been able to get a rare glimpse of her after she was snapped taking a stroll around Soho in London this week.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cassandra was photographed walking with a friend but despite it being 35 years since she first appeared on the series, she didn’t appear to have aged.\n\nThe now 64-year-old has a similar haircut to the one her beloved character had, with a fringe and layered style.\n\nIn 2022, Gwyneth reunited with her former co-star Tessa Peake-Jones, who played Delboy’s wife Raquel, on Loose Women.\n\nDuring the appearance Tessa and Gwyneth revealed they were originally only set to star in one episode of the show in 1988 but were so popular they remained a part of the cast until its conclusion.\n\nOnly Fools and Horses ran for seven seasons and 16 Christmas specials until 2003, with the final episode attracting a record audience for a British sitcom of 24.3 million viewers.\n\nStarting her career as a child actor, Gwyneth’s first role was in the Royal Court Theatre’s production Live Like Pigs when she was 13 before going on to be a regular in the children’s TV series The Flockton Flyer between 1977 and 1979.\n\nShe married her long-term partner, former Footballers’ Wives and Eldorado star Jesse Birdsall, in 2000.\n\nThey share two children, son Oscar and daughter Lottie.\n\nOnly Fools and Horses is streaming on ITVX.\n\nGot a story?"
