        "text": "Only Fools and Horses has been a firm favourite for an incredible four decades.\n\nMany of us will have had our first proper laugh-out-loud TV-watching moment courtesy of Del Boy and Rodney and many of their catchphrases are a staple part of our vernacular.\n\n\"This time next year, we could be millionaires!\"\n\nCreated and written by the late great John Sullivan, the story focused in on the lives of Del Boy Trotter (played by David Jason) and his younger brother Rodney (played by Nicholas Lyndhurst) in their tireless quest to make a few quid as Trotter's Independent Traders.\n\nRead more: From Erinsborough to Summer Bay... all the Australian soaps that made it to UK shores\n\nMany of the stars of the show have sadly passed away but here we take a look at where some of the surviving cast members are now as well as pay tribute to those we've lost along the way.\n\nDel Boy (David Jason OBE)\n\nIt wouldn't be right to start this list in any other way.\n\nDerek \"Del Boy\" Trotter is the main character, played by David Jason and is the lovable wheeler-dealer we all had a soft spot for.\n\nDavid Jason's real name is actually David White.\n\nNow aged 82, his mother Olwen Jones was from Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorgan (Now Merthyr Tydfil, County Borough).\n\nDavid continued acting after Only Fools playing Jack Frost in A Touch of Frost, Granville in Open All Hours and Pop Larkin in The Darling Buds of May.\n\nHe was also the voice of Toad in The Wind in the Willows and the main character in Danger Mouse and Count Duckula.\n\nIn his personal life, he lived with long-term partner, Welsh actress Myfanwy Talog for 18 years until she died of breast cancer in 1995.\n\nHe became a father for the first time at the age of 61 when his girlfriend, 41-year-old Gill Hinchcliffe, gave birth to a baby girl, Sophie Mae.\n\nJason and Hinchcliffe married in 2005 and live in Buckinghamshire.\n\nRodney (Nicholas Lyndhurst)\n\nNicholas Lyndhurst played Del Boy's long suffering younger brother Rodney in the show. Often horrified by Del Boy's schemes, he would faithfully allow himself to be dragged along anyway and often would get called a \"plonker\" no matter what he did.\n\nNicholas Lyndhurst went on to have success in his role as Gary Sparrow in BBC sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart for which he one two National Television Awards.\n\nTragedy struck in September 2020 when Nicholas's son, Archie Lyndhurst died from a acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.\n\nIn a statement, Lyndhurst said he and his wife Lucy were \"utterly grief stricken and respectfully request privacy\".\n\nMarlene Boyce (Sue Holderness)\n\nIf you had to do a Boycie impression, chances are you'd say the word: \"Marlene\" in that well-known Boycie voice.\n\nMarlene was Boycie's wife in Only Fools played by Sue Holderness.\n\nHolderness regularly appears in The Vagina Monologues and is part of the case of the touring play Seven Deadly Sins Four Deadly Sinners.\n\nThe actress also played the role of Annie in the 2010 UK Tour of Calendar Girls as well as playing many roles in film and TV including Estelle in Eastenders on 2021.\n\nShe has two children with her husband Mark Piper to whom she's been married to since 1989.\n\nRaquel (Tessa Peake-Jones)\n\nRaquel was the longtime partner of the main character of Del Boy and actress Tessa Peake-Jones has continued to have a successful TV career elsewhere in things like: The Demon Headmaster, Midsomer Murders, Casualty, The Bill and Grantchester amongst many others.\n\nIn a strange TV quirk, Peake-Jones's real-life partner Douglas Hodge, even played her on-screen son Damien Trotter (as an adult) in the Only Fools and Horses episode \"Heroes and Villains\".\n\nThey have two children together and announced that they had split up in 2013 after 27 years together.\n\nDamien Trotter (played by numerous actors: Patrick McManus (1991), Grant Stevens (1991), Robert Liddement (1992), Jamie Smith (1993–96), Douglas Hodge (1996;
