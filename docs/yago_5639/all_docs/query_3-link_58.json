Yates\n\nLast Update: Wed Sep 28 08:07 EDT 2022\n\nRandom History Bytes 103: The Penn, Birdsall, Parker, Carr, Mott, Shourds and Allen Families\n\n----------\n\nTHE PENN FAMILY.\n\nIt is said that William Penn, the founder of Philadelphia, had a reprobate son, and from him have descended the Penns of Cumberland, Burlington and Ocean counties.\n\nJames Penn, Sr., emigrated from Cumberland county, N.J., to Washington township, Burlington county, N.J. He settled on the West Plains, where he lived until about the year 1840, when he died, aged about 88 years; therefore, he must have been born about the year 1752. He had brothers, William, Richard and Samuel, who remained in Cumberland county.\n\nIt is said by those who have seen the statue of William Penn the great, and are acquainted with the descendants of the above said James Penn, that the posterity of James Penn, at least some of them, have a striking resemblance to the statue, and other representations of the founder of Philadelphia.\n\nJames Penn, Sr., of the West Plains had children: William, James, Joel, Jonathan, Stacy, John, Elizabeth, Rhoda and Hannah.\n\nWilliam, son of James Penn, Sr., married Sarah Jenkins, and had children Jesse, Zepheniah, James, William, Susan and Lucy Ann.\n\nRhoda, daughter of James Penn, Sr., married Zachariah Jenkins.\n\nElizabeth, daughter of James Penn, Sr., married Lewis Rossell, and among their children were James, Ridgway, Champion and Samuel.\n\nJesse Penn married Rebecca, daughter of Jacob Headley.\n\nZephaniah Penn married Hope, daughter of Jacob Headley.\n\nThe posterity of James Penn, Sr., is quite numerous, but I cannot trace them, several of them went to the West.\n\nTHE BIRDSALL FAMILY.\n\nThe Birdsall's were settled on Long Island at an early date. In the year l713 William Birdsall, of Long Island, joined with John Mathis and Moses Forman in the purchase of Daniel Mathis' Island. William Birdsall sold out within a year after the contract and from a certain document it is evident that William Birdsall remained on Long Island. From what I have seen and heard I believe that Stephen and Nathaniel Birdsall came with John Mathis to Little Egg Harbor, and probably they were relations, as all writings prove that they had a considerable of friendly intercourse. I have a letter dated 17, 19-20, directed to Stephen Birdsall at Egg Harbor, and this seems to imply that he was a resident of that place. The Stephen Birdsall who in the year 1738 married Deliverance Willits, must have been the son of the above said Stephen Birdsall, and this second Stephen Birdsall was the first elder of the Barnegat Quaker meeting, established in the year 1767. Stephen Birdsall, Sr., must have had a daughter Phoebe who married a Havens, and some where near 1754 she married Joseph Bartlett, the first of the name in New Jersey. After settling in New Jersey Nathaniel Birdsall was called Nathan, and the Nathan's of Little Egg Harbor and Barnegat originated with Nathan or Nathaniel Birdsall.\n\nMary, wife of Timothy Willits, and Sarah, wife of Jarvis Hazleton, were the daughters of Stephen Birdsall, 2nd, and his wife Deliverance; and they also had a son Stephen, and there might have been other children. The Birdsalls are settled at Barnegat and Waretown.\n\nCharles Dingee was settled in Egg Harbor before the year 1724; he owned the farm now owned and occupied by Barzilla Atkinson, on the road from Tuckerton to West Creek. He sold this farm to Thomas Ridgway, Sr., who in the year 1724 bequeathed it to his youngest son Robert Ridgway.\n\nCharles Dingee and Moses Embro were both living in Egg Harbor before the year 1715, and it appears were members of the Friends' Meeting. In the year 1725 Moses Embro and his wife Mary got certificates for removal to Pennsylvania.\n\nJohn Stanton was here at an early date. He married Molly Wainwright, of Mannahawkin, and had a daughter Sarah, who married Henry Mott, Sr., and was the mother of James, Thomas, Enoch, Hannah, Elizabeth, Mercy and Christian.\n\nI think the first Gales were settled in Washington township a considerable time before the Revolutionary War. There was a Jacob Gale and a Cornelius Gale, Sr., and he must have been the father of Joseph, Abel and James Gale. Joseph Gale married Mercy Allen, and had children Cornelius, James and Samuel. The second wife was Hannah Mott, and the children Elizabeth, Mary, Henry, Joseph, Mercy, Abel, David, Hannah and Amy.\n\nAbel Gale, Sr., married ______ Smallwood, and had a daughter Margaret, who married Simon Peterson. Jarvis Gale, Sr., married Sarah Cranmer, and among his children were William, John and Hannah, and another daughter who married James Maxfield, Sr.\n\nTHE PARKER FAMILY.\n\nIn English History I have read of several persons by the name of Parker, who were distinguished characters, and tradition says that the Parkers of America are of English origin, and it further says that in early times there were four brothers by the name of Parker who came together to America. One of the brothers is said to have settled in New York, one in Monmouth county, N.J., and the other in Little Egg Harbor. In the year 1721, Joseph Parker came from Shrewsbury, N.J., to Egg Harbor, where in the same year he married Hannah, daughter of Edward Andrews, the first white settler in Tuckerton. The children of this marriage were Joseph, Peter, Samuel, Thomas, Alice, Sarah, Hannah and Elizabeth. Parker's first wife died, and in the year 1739, he married Hannah, daughter of Richard Osborn, 1st. She had no children, and after her death her husband married a woman by the name of Elizabeth - but her maiden name is not remembered among her posterity. She was the mother of Daniel, Ann, Temperance and Phoebe Parker. Joseph Parker,Sr., settled on what is now called Parkertown, having located a large tract of land. His descendants seem to have had a strong partiality for their ancestor's homestead, for here a greater part of several generations of them have resided and increased and built upon the old homestead farm, until it has become a village peopled almost solely by the posterity of Joseph Parker, and the great majority of them bearing the name of Parker.\n\nJoseph Parker, Sr., was a Friend and was twice married in the Friends' meeting at Tuckerton. He must have married his third wife in a distant section. For two or three generations, the Parkers were all Quakers, but at this date there is but a few families of the Parkers who possess the faith of their forefathers.\n\nI have not succeeded in collecting a very concise geneologieal list of the Parker family. I have searched out the dead and the living know their own history.\n\nFirst Branch of Joseph Parker, Sr.'s, Family. - Joseph, son of Joseph Parker, Sr., married Edith, daughter of Mordecai Andrews, Jr. Edith had one child, whose name was Kesiah, and she married Joseph Seaman, Jr. Edith Parker died, and her husband married Abigail Seaman, daughter of Joseph Seaman, Sr. The children of this union were William, Joseph, Mary and Hannah.\n\nWilliam Parker married Rebecca Woolston. Their children John, Benjamin, Joshua, Daniel, Woolston and Sarah.\n\nBenjamin Parker married Phoebe, daughter of Caleb Ogborn.

I am not able to name their children.\n\nDaniel Parker married Elizabeth, daughter of Alexander Thompson. Their children Bodine, Timothy, Margaret and Rebecca. Daniel Parker is the principal business man of Parkertown.\n\nWoolston Parker married Margaret, daughter of Alexander Thompson. Among their children are Nicholas, Joshua and Abigail.

Elizabeth Parker married Rockhill Shourds.\n\nThomas, son of Peter Parker, Sr., married Abigail, widow of Joseph Bartlett, and daughter of Timothy Willits, Sr. The children of this marriage were Willits and John.\n\nWillits Parker is a man of high respectability. He is a member of Quaker meeting, of which he is the principal elder.\n\nHe is one of the most enterprising farmers of his native place. Willits Parker married Phoebe, daughter of John Willits, Sr. Their children are Oliver, Ezra, Willits, Mary Ann, Jane, Martha, Naomi and Phoebe Ann.\n\nOliver Parker married Edith,. daughter of George M. Elkinton of Philadelphia.\n\nMary Ann Parker married George Collins of Barnegat. Jane Parker married William Brown.\n\nJohn, son of Thomas Parker and brother of Willits, married Beulah Cranmer. John Parker and his family reside in the State of Indiana.\n\nHannah, daughter of Peter Parker, Sr., married James Wright. No children.\n\nThird Branch. - Thomas, son of Joseph Parker, Sr., left Egg Harbor in his young days and settled in the upper part of Burlington county.\n\nFourth Branch. - Samuel, son of Joseph Parker, Sr., settled in the upper section of Burlington county, his wife's name was Elizabeth, and their children were Joseph, Sarah, Isaac, Hannah, Samuel, Edward and Elizabeth.\n\nFifth Branch. - Alice, daughter of Joseph Parker, Sr., married Samuel, son of Evi Belangee, Sr., and brother of James Belangee, Sr. They removed to a distant locality.\n\nSixth Branch. - Sarah, daughter of Joseph Parker, Sr., married Edward Havens.\n\nSeventh Branch. - Elizabeth, daughter of Joseph Parker, Sr., married Micajah Willits, Sr., of Mannahawkin.\n\nEighth Branch. - Hannah, daughter of Joseph Parker, Sr., married Jonathan Cox, Sr.\n\nNinth Branch. - Daniel, son of Joseph Parker, Sr., by his third wife, did not marry; he was a minister in the Society of Friends.

Job Carr was with Pulaski's guard, which was stationed on the Ridgway farm, where they were butchered by the British, and it is said Job Carr was among the slain. Thomas Carr married Letitia, a descendant of Samuel Shourds, Sr. They settled at Pemberton, N.J. James Carr settled at Manahawkin; his wife's name was Phoebe, and they were the progenitors of the Carrs of that place.\n\nTHE MOTT FAMILY.\n\nIn the year 1745, Ebenezer Mott and wife came from Rhode Island and brought their certificate to the Egg Harbor Monthly Meeting. It is said that they settled at Barnegat. John and Henry Mott, who must have been the sons of Ebenezer Mott settled in Egg Harbor. Henry Mott had a permanent residence there, he had a farm and a tract of valuable timber land. Henry Mott married Sarah, daughter of John and Molly Stanton. Henry's children were Thomas, James, Enoch, Hannah, Mercy, Christian and Elizabeth. Thomas Mott married Rachel ______ of the upper part of Burlington county. James Mott married Elizabeth Gale, and then Rebecca Rose, widow of Joel Rose. Enoch Mott married Elizabeth ______, of Cumberland county. Hannah Mott married Joseph Gale, Sr. Mercy Mott married Cornelius Gale. Christian Mott married Michael Bennet. Elizabeth Mott married Joshua Gifford, Sr.\n\nIn the year 1772, Stephen Birdsall, Jr., married Desire Mott, who must have been a daughter of Ebenezer Mott. About this time there was a Phoebe Mott living at Barnegat; she probably was a daughter of Ebenezer Mott.\n\nTHE SHOURDS FAMILY.\n\nA certain historian says: \"The Shourds family are descended from Cornelius Shourds, a stockholder of one of the provinces of Holland, who came to this country at the invitation of William Penn. He and his family arrived in Philadelphia, in the year 1684. They lived in a cave for a short period of time near Germantown. (It was quite common then for settlers on their first arrival, to seek temporary shelter in caves, generally on a river bank, until they could erect more desirable dwellings. Many of the original settlers of Philadelphia had temporary residences in caves on the banks of the Delaware.)\n\nThe maiden name of the wife of Shourds was Sophia Weimar, and most of their children were born in Holland. Their names were Samuel, Catharine, Esther, Sarah and Sophia. Sophia, the youngest, married Zebulon Gauntt. In 1716, Samuel, the son of Cornelius Shourds, married, and he and his wife had a large family of children.\"\n\nIt is probable that Samuel Shourds, Sr., came to Little Egg Harbor about the year 1735. Before emigrating to Egg Harbor, it is said he was settled at Bristol, Pa., where he owned a grist mill; and when he settled in Tuckerton, he purchased the grist mill built by Edward Andrews, and it is very probable that he purchased the said mill of Jacob Andrews. The above account states that Cornelius Shouerde (or as it has been since written, Shourds) had but one son, but it is likely he had another son, for there seems to have been Shourds who were not Samuel Shourds' posterity, for in the year 1768, there was a Thomason Shourds, and her four children, who brought their certificates from Chesterfield meeting, to the Little Egg Harbor meeting, and three or four years afterwards, got certificates to go back to the place from whence they came. My mother was a descendant of Samuel Shourds, and in all of her talk about Samuel Shourds' children, she never mentioned anything about a son of his who could have been the husband of Thomason Shourds, and it is evident that when Samuel Shourds came to Egg Harbor his children were small, and all of them grew up and married here. Samuel Shourds had four children by his first wife whose names were Joseph, Daniel, Susannah and Mary. Samuel Shourds, in his old age, married a second wife, a widow, by the name of Elizabeth Lunnan, by whom he had two sons, Stephen and Solomon.\n\nJoseph, son of Samuel Shourds, Sr., in the year 1759, married Keziah, daughter of Mordecai Andrews, Jr., and had children: Thomas, Joseph and Mary. There is no account of Joseph Shourds' marriage. It is said he left his native place. Mary, daughter of Joseph Shourds, Sr., married Captain Hammond, and had a daughter Fanny, who left her native place.\n\nThomas, son of Joseph Shourds, Sr., married Amy, daughter of Solomon Rockhill, Sr., and had children: Samuel Rockhill, John, Joseph, Susan and Mary. Joseph Shourds married Lydia Ridgway.\n\nThomas Shourds was captain of a vessel which was capsized. He and his crew clung to the wreck, but the weather was severely cold, and they soon perished.\n\nJohn, son of Thomas Shourds, Sr., married Jane, daughter of Caleb and Rachel Lane. Their children were Rachel, Ann, Mary Jane and John.\n\nJohn Shourds, Sr., was a seacaptain. He had just built a new vessel, and it was the month of December, before she was ready for sea. Captain Shourds was anxious to try the sailing qualities of his new craft, which he had named the Mary Jane, in honor of his wife and daughter. The vessel was loaded with oysters for the New York market, and left the new inlet, on the afternoon of Sunday, the 5th of December, 1830. At the time of her leaving the inlet, the wind and the clouds bore strong indications of a snow storm; and long before midnight one of the most severe snow storms ever known on our coast was spending its fury on the ocean, and it is supposed that Captain Shourd's vessel shifted her cargo, and went down in the ocean, somewhere between Egg Harbor and Sandy Hook. The crew consisted of Captain Shourds, James Sprague, Eli Gifford and Jonathan Gifford, all of them men of families. And thus were left four widows and four sets of orphan children. None of these widows married again, two of them still survive - Jane Shourds and Esther Gifford. Long and weary did these disconsolate widows look and wait for the return of their companions, as is usual in such cases, clothing their minds with the hope, that their friends had been picked up by some vessel which was bound to a far distant port.\n\nMonth succeeded month, and year rolled after year, but no tidings came from the missing vessel or her crew, and now nearly forty years have spent themselves since Captain Shourds and his crew left their homes in Tuckerton, and sailed out amidst the perils of the great deep, never more to return to their friends and homes. It is not known that the ocean ever gave up anything pertaining to this ill-fated vessel or her crew.\n\nRachel, daughter of Captain John Shourds married Amasa B. Mathis. Their children are Joseph, Margaretta and Henry.\n\nMary Jane, daughter of Captain John Shourds, married Chalkley Mathis.\n\nJohn, son of Captain John Shourds, married Rachel Engle.

Sarah Humphreys married ______ Unsles, and had at least two children: Susan and Letitia. Susan married a Gale of Mount Holly, and Letitia married Thomas Carr, and resided at Pemberton. The second daughter of Susannah Humphreys, whose name must have been Keziah, married Thomas Earling, of Pemberton. The posterity of the above named persons (if there is any) are the descendants of Samuel Shourds, Sr., of Tuckerton.\n\nTHE ALLEN FAMILY.\n\nIn the year 1716, Robert Allen, of Shrewsbury, Monmouth county, N.J., came to Egg Harbor and married Edith, daughter of Edward Andrews, of Tuckerton. They were married in the Friends' meeting house at Tuckerton, and were the second couple married in that primitive edifice. Allen settled at Bass River, on the west side of the river, at the place now called Allentown.

Sometimes he went a considerable distance from home for the purpose of killing deer, and at such times he put up in some rude hut in the wilderness, where he stored the game, which he procured on his last hunting expedition, he went from home with the intention of spending a week in the chase. The week passed away but did not bring back the hunter, but his friends supposed he was still pursuing his wild, but to him, pleasurable avocation; but after a considerable time had elapsed they became alarmed at his protracted stay, and went in search of him. After a long search they found an old log cabin which had tumbled down, and beneath the ruins they found the body of Peter Allen in a state of decomposition.\n\nJoseph, son of Peter Allen, in his time, was one of the prominent men of Bass River. He was a Justice of the Peace, and was usually spoken of as 'Squire Allen.
