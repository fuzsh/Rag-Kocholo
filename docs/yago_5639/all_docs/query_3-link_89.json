        "text": "Eldorado aired for only a year and was said to be a doomed soap.\n\nThe BBC pitched it as the antidote to EastEnders and spent more than £10million on the show.\n\nYet after just 156 episodes, it fell flat on its face and the set now lays abandoned in the hills of Marbella, in Spain's Costa del Sol.\n\nProducers based the storyline on a group of ex-pats living in Spain.\n\nLogistical difficulties of filming a twice-a-week show in Spain were thought to be its downfall and it was panned by critics - slumping to an audience of just 2.8 million.\n\nNow, almost 30 years on, this is where the cast have ended up since.\n\nMany are now in their 70s and enjoying a well-earned retirement but plenty are still acting.\n\nJesse Birdsall\n\nJesse played Marcus Tandy on the soap but after the demise of the entire show, he went on to appear in numerous other soaps.\n\nHe appeared in Footballers' Wives as football manager, Roger Webb between 2004 and 2006, and moved onto Fraser Black in Hollyoaks and villain Ron Gregory in a few episodes of The Bill.\n\nHe had the final line in Eldorado saying to girlfriend Pilar: \"you can't trust anyone these days, can you?\"\n\nSandra Sandri\n\nSandra Sandri was one of the few cast members actually from Spain.\n\nShe played Tandy's girlfriend Pilar Moreno.\n\nSandra is from Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. However, apart from film Searching for Love in 2004, it is not known what Sandra currently does.\n\nPolly Perkins\n\nPolly Perkins was born Gillian Nessie Arnold and initially rose to fame in the 1960s as a popstar, going on to regularly appear in theatre and cabaret throughout the UK.\n\nShe played Trish Valentine in Eldorado.\n\nShe is best known for playing Rose Cotton, the half-sister of Dot Branning (June Brown) in EastEnders between 2011 and 2012.\n\nPatricia Ann Brake\n\nPatricia Brake had plenty of shows to her name before she even approached Eldorado, appearing in the BBC sitcom Porridge, and its sequel Going Straight.\n\nHer most recent work was in 2015 when she guest-starred in Casualty and in Midsomer Murders for ITV. She has also appeared in EastEnders and Coronation Street as well as the West End.\n\nShe played Gwen Lockhead, married to Drew Lockhead with their daughter Nessa Lockhead.\n\nCampbell Morrison\n\nCampbell played one of the main characters, Drew Lockhead in the soap opera Eldorado and also appeared in EastEnders playing DCI Charlie Mason.\n\nMorrison was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company in the early eighties and sadly passed away in January 2008.\n\nJulie Mare Fernandez\n\nJulie is an actress and model, best known for her role as Brenda in Ricky Gervais' comedy The Office.\n\nShe played Gwen and Drew Lockhead's daughter Nessa.\n\nRoland Curram\n\nRoland Curram appeared as Julie Christie's travelling companion in her Oscar-winning film Darling and then went on to play expatriate Freddie Martin in Eldorado.\n\nIn the early 1990s, shortly after the demise of Eldorado, he quit acting to carve out a second career as a novelist.\n\nHe did appear in Emmerdale, when it was still called Emmerdale Farm.\n\nRoger Walker\n\nHe played the role of Bunny Charlson in Eldorado who caused drama as co-owner Georgios.\n\nSince then, he has guest-starred in shows such as Casualty, Peak Practice, The Queen's Nose, The Bill and Heartbeat.\n\nHe also played Bill Parrish in EastEnders in 2002.\n\nDerek Martin\n\nDerek Martin played Alex Morris in soap Eldorado.\n\nDerek Martin also played taxi driver Charlie Slater in Eastenders for a decade."
