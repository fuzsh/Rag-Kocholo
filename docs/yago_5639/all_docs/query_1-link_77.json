        "text": "Crewe Hall ♥ Louisa and Ryan\n\nA busy wedding this with lots of people, lots of travelling and a couple of celebrities thrown in for good measure.\n\nLouisa and Ryan both got ready for their big day at Crewe Hall in Cheshire, a magnificent building set in stunning grounds just on the outskirts of Crewe town. The ceremony was taking place at St Bertoline's Church in the nearby village of Barthomley and whilst most of the guests were transported by minibus, Louisa naturally had a much more elegant mode of transport befitting the beautiful bride, in the form of a lovely cream Beauford car.\n\nOnce the ceremony was over, it was back to the magnificence of Crewe Hall for drinks, photographs and the wedding breakfast.\n\nWhat of the celebrities I mentioned earlier you ask? The mother and father of one of the ushers are the well known actors Jessie Birdsall and Gwyneth Strong (aka \"Cassandra\" in \"Only Fools and Horses\").. photo below.\n\nAs usual, here are a small selection from the day.\n\nRyan and Oscar with Oscar's parents, Jessie Birdsall and Gwyneth Strong\n\nMore photographs from Crewe Hall in Cheshire and other venues can be found both in this blog and on our main wedding website at www.barrieneilweddings.co.uk"
