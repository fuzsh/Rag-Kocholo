        "text": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin were married for more than 10 years before they famously announced they were \"consciously uncoupling\" in 2014.\n\nThe pair first met in 2002 while hanging backstage at one of Martin's Coldplay concerts. They began dating and tied the knot a year later. Over the course of their decade-long marriage, Paltrow and Martin welcomed two children, Apple and Moses.\n\nWhile the Goop founder and Coldplay frontman may no longer be married, the two have remained close friends.\n\n\"I think Chris and I were meant to be together and have our kids,\" Paltrow said in 2019. \"But our relationship is much better like this: friends and co-parents and family.\"\n\nIn fact, after the Avengers star got remarried in 2018 to TV writer and producer Brad Falchuk, Martin — who's been dating actress Dakota Johnson since 2017 — joined them for a big family honeymoon over Christmas.\n\n\"My new husband and his children, my children, my ex-husband,\" Paltrow explained. \"It was a very modern honeymoon.\"\n\nFrom their first backstage meeting to their enduring post-split friendship, here's everything to know about Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's relationship.\n\nOctober 2002: Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin first meet\n\nPaltrow and Martin reportedly met backstage at a Coldplay concert in October 2002, just three weeks after the Oscar winner lost her father, Bruce Paltrow.\n\nNovember 2003: Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin spark wedding rumors\n\nA year after their first introduction, the couple began house hunting in north London in mid-November, according to PEOPLE.\n\nWhen asked during a BBC interview a few days later whether she and Martin were planning to tie the knot, Paltrow replied, \"I hope so. Ask him.\"\n\nDecember 3, 2003: Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin confirm they're expecting\n\nWith wedding rumors swirling, Paltrow's publicist Stephen Huvane confirmed in a December 2003 statement to the Associated Press that Paltrow and Martin were expecting their first child together.\n\nDecember 5, 2003: Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin get married\n\nJust a few days later, a source close to Paltrow told PEOPLE the pair had already gotten hitched in a secret ceremony on Dec. 5, 2003.\n\nThe surprise event went down in Santa Barbara, California, and no family members were in attendance — not even Paltrow's mom, Blythe Danner.\n\nMay 14, 2004: Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin welcome their first baby\n\nThe following May, PEOPLE exclusively reported that Paltrow and Martin had welcomed a new addition to their family: a baby girl named Apple Blythe Alison Martin.\n\nDuring an Instagram Q&A in April 2022, the Iron Man star revealed Martin was actually the one who suggested the name for their daughter.\n\n\"Her dad came up with the name and I fell in love with it,\" Paltrow told a fan, according to PEOPLE. \"I thought it was original and cool. I can't imagine her being called anything else.\"\n\nJanuary 13, 2006: Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin confirm pregnancy\n\nIn January 2006, Paltrow confirmed she was expecting her second child with Martin after a Screen Actors Guild screening of her movie Proof in January 2006.\n\nAccording to PEOPLE, the actress was introduced as \"a pregnant woman\" by moderator Lou Diamond Philips, who asked: \"How far along are you?\"\n\nPaltrow's answer: \"Far enough along to feel very cumbersome.\"\n\nApril 8, 2006: Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin welcome a son\n\nSix months later, Paltrow's rep confirmed to PEOPLE that the Oscar winner and rock star had welcomed their second child, a son, whom they named Moses Martin after the Coldplay song \"Moses\" that Martin wrote for Paltrow in 2003.\n\n\"Moses to me is just such an amazing name,\" Paltrow later told PEOPLE. \"Plus, he was born on the holiest Sabbath of the year, which is the Saturday before Passover. And he was born at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York … And it was my father's Hebrew name.\"\n\nApril 9, 2010: Gwyneth Paltrow credits Chris Martin for realizing she had postpartum depression\n\nJust after Moses turned one, Paltrow shared with Vogue UK that she had suffered from postpartum depression following his birth.\n\n\"At my lowest, I was a robot.
