I have decided to give it a go again.\n\n\"Not only because I believe I have found the man I was meant to be with, but because I have accepted the soul-stretching, pattern-breaking opportunities that (terrifyingly) are made possible by intimacy.\"\n\nThe 'Shallow Hal' star recently admitted she hasn't been very \"involved\" in planning her wedding because she's been too busy.\n\nShe said: \"I'm very busy so I'm actually not that involved in it. I have so much going on and I'm sort of outsourcing that. I'm probably the least bridezilla person probably to a fault that has ever come across my wedding planner's office doors.\"\n\nWhen Gwyneth tied the knot with Coldplay frontman Chris in December 2003, the pair missed out on a proper ceremony as they decided to simply elope, and so the 'Sliding Doors' actress was looking forward to keeping things more traditional the second time around.\n\nShe said: \"Chris and I eloped, so I've never actually had a wedding, or any of these fun bride kind of things. I'm really enjoying myself.\""
