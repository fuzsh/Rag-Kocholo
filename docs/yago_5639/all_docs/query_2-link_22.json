        "text": "This post contains mild spoilers for WeCrashed.\n\nThe G-word gets dropped about 20 minutes into the first episode of WeCrashed, which debuted Friday. “I’m a serious vegan—I write a column for my cousin Gwyneth’s wellness blog,” Rebekah Paltrow Neumann (played by Anne Hathaway) tells Adam Neumann (Jared Leto) on their first date. “Gwyneth…as in Paltrow?” he asks. Rebekah defensively replies, “She’s just a person, okay?”\n\nPaltrow never appears in the Apple TV+ series about the rise and fall of WeWork, neither as a character nor as herself. But her presence looms large in the psyche of Hathaway’s Neumann, who’s eager to break out of the Oscar winner’s shadow. (Through her representative, Paltrow declined to comment on the series to Vanity Fair.)\n\nThe show may be fictionalized, but Paltrow and Neumann really are first cousins. Neumann’s father, Bob, was the brother of late director Bruce Paltrow, Gwyneth’s dad. As seen in WeCrashed’s third episode, Bob pleaded guilty to tax evasion in 2014 and was later sentenced to six months in prison. In a 2016 Porter magazine piece, Neumann attempted to understate her upbringing, saying she grew up “off a dirt road in, like, a tree house.” But Paltrow, who was also interviewed, had a different take on her cousin’s Bedford, New York, adolescence. “They were well-off,” she said.\n\nNeumann (whose maiden name, of course, was Paltrow) attended Cornell University, where she studied business and Buddhism, according to Bustle. A college source told Business Insider that while rushing sororities, Neumann was eager to tie herself to her famous relative. Two minutes into meeting a Delta Gamma sister, Rebekah “sort of waved her hand and said, ‘Yes, Gwyneth is my cousin. Yes, I know Brad [Pitt, whom Paltrow was dating at the time]. Yes, we are close. And I am going to the wedding. Next!’ That’s a direct quote. My sorority sister was aghast.”\n\nPostcollege, Neumann dabbled in investment banking, but would eventually set her sights on acting. Raphael Sacks, who took an acting class with her, told Bustle that show business is “brutal” as it is, even without an A-list cousin to compete against. “It’s easy to imagine people in L.A. trying to use her to get to Gwyneth Paltrow,” he said.\n\nThis, too, is a source of tension for the fictional Neumann in WeCrashed. “Oh wait, is Gwyneth coming?” a guest at Rebekah and Adam’s October 2008 wedding asks in the show’s second episode. “She couldn’t; she’s busy shooting Country Strong. That’s the business we’re in,” Rebekah replies. Questions about Paltrow’s absence persist, and Rebekah is later seen dipping her toe back into acting. In another scene, she even compares her sparse IMDb page to that of her cousin’s.\n\nNeumann tells her father she’d like to pursue acting via flashback in the show’s third episode. “Like Gwynnie?” her father asks, adding, “You always had talent, more than Gwynnie. I never really believed her head was in that box”—a spoilery reference to Paltrow’s role in David Fincher’s Se7en. In reality, Neumann’s body of work was limited to a handful of projects, including Awake, a short film she cowrote, produced, and starred in alongside Rosario Dawson—it was shot in WeWork’s offices—and a production of Chekhov’s Three Sisters, which is depicted in WeCrashed.\n\nBut with Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey’s founding of WeWork in 2010, a new path to stardom began to materialize for Rebekah. She was listed as the company’s chief brand and impact officer, and described as Adam’s “strategic thought partner,” in WeWork’s S-1 filing, although the document claimed that Rebekah was never paid a salary. “[Adam] has a wife who wants to leverage this to be her own major character,” a source who’d interacted with Rebekah told Vanity Fair’s Gabriel Sherman in November 2019.\n\nAccording to a V.F. report from Rachel Dodes, Neumann “debated about whether to continue using her birth name” while still trying to be an actor in WeWork’s early days. Employees who worked there at the time told Dodes that she even “met in WeWork’s office with consultants to advise her about the issue” and “set up a Google alert for news about Paltrow.” By the time WeWork reached unicorn status (a $1 billion valuation), an internal memo had been sent declaring that the founder’s wife be known only as Rebekah Neumann, not Rebekah Paltrow-Neumann, or RPN, as reported in Vanity Fair.\n\nBy February 2018, Paltrow came calling. She sat down with her cousin to discuss the origins of WeGrow, the for-profit private school Neumann would launch later that year. A clip from their conversation can be found on WeWork’s Facebook, although a hyperlink leading readers to a corresponding article on Goop’s site is no longer functioning. “So you’re starting a school,” Paltrow says, a slight gleam in her eye. Neumann explains that WeGrow gets its name “because we think that we’re all students of life for life, and one of the most important things in life is to be in a constant state of personal growth.” (The school would close around the time Rebekah and Adam stepped down from their WeWork leadership roles.)\n\nThat same year, the Neumanns did not attend Paltrow’s wedding to producer Brad Falchuk. (Or if they were there, they weren’t spotted.) Just a few weeks earlier, Rebekah had found herself embroiled in controversy after stating, at WeWork’s summer camp retreat, that “[a] big part of being a woman is to help men [like Adam] manifest their calling in life.” (At the time, WeWork declined to comment to CNBC about Rebekah’s remark, only pointing out another quote of hers from the event: “The reality that I see today is that there is nothing bigger that women can do, in my opinion, than empower their partners—and that can be a man, a woman, a friend, it doesn’t matter, but empower others.”)\n\nIronically enough, it is through Apple’s new series (and last year’s Hulu documentary) that Neumann has edged ever closer to Paltrow’s level of fame. There are other references to Paltrow throughout WeCrashed, including talk of her rumored open marriage with ex-husband Chris Martin and Goop’s infamous yoni egg. At a 2022 Television Critics Association panel, executive producers Lee Eisenberg and Drew Crevello compared Paltrow’s presence in the show to that of the president in HBO’s Veep—buzzed about, but never seen. They felt it key to include her in their narrative because “her presence and the way she loomed in Rebekah’s life was very relevant to her character,” journalist Eric Goldman reported.\n\nWhile Leto told Vanity Fair that he had “an interesting meeting” with the Neumanns, Hathaway has mostly remained mum about any interactions with Rebekah—though she did say in one recent interview, “I realized I knew some people that knew her, and I spoke to them and I said, ‘So what’s she like?’ And they said, ‘She’s really sweet.’” At TCA, according to Goldman, Hathaway wouldn’t disclose whether she had spoken to Paltrow about playing her cousin. “Gwyneth Paltrow is someone who gets a lot of media attention & she’d probably prefer I just say ‘We’re good,’” the A.V. Club’s Saloni Gajjar tweeted, quoting Hathaway during the TCA panel.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nNotably, fellow Oscar winners Paltrow and Hathaway have never worked together—although they did both find themselves on an ill-conceived list of “most hated celebrities” published by Star magazine in 2013. (Paltrow was number one; Hathaway came in at nine.)\n\nFollowing the Neumanns’ departure from WeWork in late 2019, it’s difficult to decipher where Rebekah and Paltrow’s relationship stands. Vanity Fair reported in June 2021 that the Neumanns had sold at least three of their six homes, but had been spending time in the Hamptons village of Amagansett. They have a house there near a property owned by Paltrow and her mother, Blythe Danner.\n\nPerhaps the current state of Paltrow and her cousin’s behind-the-scenes allegiance can be determined through a pair of Instagram follows. Paltrow does follow Neumann’s private Instagram, @citizenofwe, which has only 88 other disciples. And @goop is following @solfl, the handle for Neumann’s latest educational endeavor, which stands for “student of life for life” (the acronym is pronounced “soulful”). However, that account hasn’t made a post since October 2019.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— Grimes on Music, Mars, and Her Secret New Baby With Elon Musk\n\n— An Exclusive First Look at the Lush Where the Crawdads Sing Adaptation\n\n— The Vanity Fair Oscar Party Returns: Fill Out Your Ballot and Watch the Livestream on March 27\n\n— The Dropout: The Truth About Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani’s Secret Romance\n\n— Jane Campion: A Candid Interview With a Master\n\n— Ally Sheedy Left Hollywood.
