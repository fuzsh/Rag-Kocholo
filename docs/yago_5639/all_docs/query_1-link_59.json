        "text": "Only Fools And Horses actress Gwyneth Strong can't believe she's starring in her first stage musical - because she admits she can't sing a note.\n\nBut it hasn't stopped her making the journey across London from the market stalls of Del Boy Trotter's Peckham to the heavy, heavy monster sound of Madness' Camden Town.\n\nGwyneth, 48, is appearing in smash hit Our House - the show based on the hits of Suggs and co. - in Glasgow and Edinburgh this summer.\n\nWhen I met her during rehearsals at Birmingham Rep she revealed the role is a real labour of love as she was a huge Madness fan as a teenager.\n\nShe told me: \"When I was 16 I was in the front row when Madness played to 200 fans at The Nashville Rooms in London, long before they hit the big time.\n\n\"I had the Madness look - the pork pie hat and Two Tone black and white checked skirt. I thought they were fantastic.\n\n\"I remember Carl Smyth - Chas Smash - doing that really iconic Madness dance at the front of the stage. Now, I get to do it in our curtain call.\n\n\"The kids in the Our House cast had to be taught how to do the dance but I did it first time around.\n\n\"Back then, I was cool. I went to see a lot of great bands before they made it including The Specials, Selecter and Fine Young Cannibals.\"\n\nIn the musical, Gwyneth plays Kath Casey - opposite 2004 X Factor winner Steve Brookstein as Dad - in the award-winning production.\n\nShe said: \"Kath lives in a house she inherited from her Irish ancestors and is very proud of the place but developers have moved in and they're trying to get her out.\n\n\"The story links beautifully with all those fantastic Madness songs. It's great to hear them again... they're like poetry.\"\n\nGwyneth admits she was nervous about doing her first musical. She said: \"I can't sing - if I could I'd have appeared in other musicals long before now.\n\n\"Thankfully the part of Kath is largely a nonsinging role but I do get to sing with the cast.\n\n\"On some numbers I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to be singing or not but I do it anyway.\n\nThose songs are so great it's very hard not to.\n\n\"It Must Be Love is a beautiful song and Baggy Trousers is so street.\"\n\nGwyneth is married to Footballers' Wives actor Jesse Birdsall and the couple have two children, Oscar, 20, and Lottie, 17.\n\nShe has been acting since she was a child and got her first big break aged 10 at the prestigious Royal Court Theatre in London.\n\nShe said: \"My parents were in the business but not as actors - dad was a TV director and mum worked at the BBC. I got the bug for acting so it was easy for me to make the first step.\n\n\"I didn't do stage school, I learned on the job.\n\nMy first job was a play called Live Like Pigs. I got a lot of work at the Royal Court after that.\n\n\"Then I did a big horror movie, Nothing But The Night with Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and Diana Dors which was great fun.\n\n\"It was really exciting as a teenager to walk on to a movie set. I can't imagine seeing all that then saying: 'I think I'll just go to university instead.'\"\n\nGwyneth also had a small role in Sir Richard Attenborough's epic 1987 movie Cry Freedom, the story of anti-apartheid campaigner Steve Biko.\n\nShe flew to Zimbabwe to shoot her solitary scene...but what a scene.\n\nShe said: \"It was the funeral scene with Kevin Kline and 25,000 extras. I thought, 'If I blow this I've had it.' So no pressure then. We did it and it was very moving.\"\n\nBut it was her role as Cassandra Trotter - wife of dip-stick Rodney - in Only Fools And Horses which rocketed Gwyneth to fame.\n\n\"In the nicest possible sense, I think Cassandra overshadows everything I've done,\" she admitted.\n\n\"If you play a role in one of the most popular television programmes ever - which just about everybody watches - people feel they know you.\n\nI'm pretty philosophical about it. It's something I'm very proud of.\"\n\nInitially Cassandra was only supposed to be in one episode but Only Fools' creator John Sullivan saw the comic potential in giving Rodney - played by Nicholas Lyndhurst - a permanent girlfriend.\n\nGwyneth said: \"I got an audition for the episode where Cassandra meets Rodney for the first time.\n\nThey decided at very short notice to extend their relationship by giving him a girlfriend.\n\n\"The chemistry between us really worked so they carried on writing for Cassandra which was lucky for me.\"\n\nGwyneth and I share something in common.\n\nOur favourite Only Fools' episode is where Rodney wins a holiday for three on the Costa del Sol in a painting contest.\n\nBut it turns out that Del Boy - immortalised by David Jason - had entered him in the under-14s category so his hapless brother has to pretend he's the teenage son of Del and Cassandra. At this point Del had yet to meet future wife Raquel (Tessa Peake-Jones).\n\nRodney has to spend his holiday skateboarding and going to discos with the Groovy Gang while his \"parents\" sun themselves and lived it up.\n\nGwyneth said: \"I loved the Spanish holiday edition - it's my all-time favourite.\n\n\"It was the first episode where I had a lot to do and Cassandra went into a different gear.\n\n\"I liked playing Cassandra because she played off so well against Rodney. It was a very popular relationship.\n\n\"What made her even better was it was great to play someone who I genuinely thought was quite a nice person.\"\n\nGwyneth has very fond memories of playing opposite David, Nicholas and the late Buster Merry field, who played old sea-salt, Uncle Albert.\n\nShe said: \"What's not to like about Del-Boy?\n\nYou've just got to love him...he's a classic comedy character.\n\n\"Nicholas was lovely too. He'd built up such a fantastic character - who I had loved just as a viewer of the show \"It was the first job I did where I'd been a big fan of the show. It was also fantastic to be working with such good writing and acting. That's as good as it gets.\"\n\nAnd would Gwyneth like to do it all again?\n\nShe told me: \"I'd do it in a second but I don't know if they'll ever bring Only Fools And Horses back. It's a hypothetical question and not something I know that much about.\"\n\nOur House is at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, from June 30 to July 5 and at The Playhouse Theatre, Edinburgh, from July 7-12.\n\n\"Thankfully my part is largely non-singing but I do get to sing along sometimes..the songs are so great it's hard not to\""
