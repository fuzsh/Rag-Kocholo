Also an extra with one line, (\"Watch it mate!\"), in an episode of Minder from 1980 entitled \"Don't Tell Them Willie Boy was Here\". In 1982 he starred alongside singer Hazel O'Connor in the TV drama series set in a nightclub called Jangles. He first came to wider public attention in the serial Annika in 1984, his first notable television role. He then subsequently appeared in the films Wish You Were Here (1987), directed by David Leland and co-starring Emily Lloyd, Getting It Right (1989), and Beyond Bedlam (1994). Another notable television role was his portrayal of slick playboy Marcus Tandy in the infamous BBC1 soap opera Eldorado, which ran for just one year from 1992–93 and gained a reputation as one of the biggest television flops of all time. Nonetheless, the amount of coverage the programme received for its perceived low quality and lack of success would gain Birdsall much exposure, and from 1995 to 1999 he played one of the lead characters in another BBC1 programme, the successful futuristic action/adventure series Bugs.\n\nHe played the part of John Barron in the last ever episode of 'Morse' in the episode 'The Remorseful Day' which aired on 15th November 2000\n\nIn 2002 he appeared in an episode of 'Murder in Mind', S2xE04, called 'Swansong'.\n\nHe guest-starred in Midsomer Murders, playing two separate characters, in the episodes \"Market for Murder\" and \"Small Mercies\". He also appeared in several episodes of the ITV police drama The Bill in 2003 as a character named Ron Gregory, and for the same network appeared as a regular in series 3-5 of the popular drama Footballer's Wives.\n\nHe had a small role in the BBC One soap opera EastEnders in August 2012, playing John Hewland, jilted fiancé of Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), in two episodes.\n\nHe played the role of Fraser Black in Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks but left the show in spring 2014 following a whodunit storyline in which he was murdered.\n\nPersonal life\n\nThe son of Penguin Books designer Derek Birdsall, Birdsall attended Hampstead School in north London. He has been married to Only Fools and Horses actress Gwyneth Strong, with whom he has two children, since 15 July 2000.\n\nFilmography\n\nActor\n\n2023\n\nRiot on Redchurch Street: The Director's Cut as\n\nJohn McKay\n\n2021\n\nThe Pebble and the Boy as\n\nAli\n\n2006\n\nHolby City (TV Series) as\n\nSteven Fletcher / Dillon Ellis\n\n- Best Christmas Ever (2018) - Steven Fletcher\n\n- Too Good to be True (2018) - Steven Fletcher\n\n- Stains (2018) - Steven Fletcher\n\n- Inscrutable (2018) - Steven Fletcher\n\n- Undoing (2018) - Steven Fletcher\n\n- One Man and His God (2018) - Steven Fletcher\n\n- Keep Your Friends Close (2018) - Steven Fletcher\n\n- Bargaining (2018) - Steven Fletcher\n\n- Bygones (2018) - Steven Fletcher\n\n- Child in Your Shadow (2018) - Steven Fletcher\n\n- Invasion (2006) - Dillon Ellis\n\n- Lead Us Not Into Temptation (2006) - Dillon Ellis\n\n2015\n\nEssex Boys: Law of Survival as\n\nHemp\n\n2013\n\nHollyoaks (TV Series) as\n\nFraser Black\n\n2013\n\nPat & Cabbage (TV Series) as\n\nTerry\n\n- Episode #1.3 (2013) - Terry\n\n2012\n\nRiot on Redchurch Street as\n\nDapper John McKay\n\n2012\n\nCrime Stories (TV Series) as\n\nRichard Booth\n\n- Episode #1.16 (2012) - Richard Booth\n\n2012\n\nEastEnders (TV Series) as\n\nJohn Hewland\n\n- Episode #1.4477 (2012) - John Hewland\n\n- Episode #1.4476 (2012) - John Hewland\n\n2011\n\nNew Tricks (TV Series) as\n\nTony Morgan\n\n- Object of Desire (2011) - Tony Morgan\n\n2011\n\nDoctors (TV Series) as\n\nSgt.
