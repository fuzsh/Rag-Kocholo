        "text": "If you’ve ever sat down with your girlfriends to ponder the relative benefits of skimpy underwear, wondered why your current romance has changed from lust and longing to personalised socks and a kitchen bin for Christmas, or danced through a night of ‘new shoe blisters’ at your favourite nightclub, then apparently, according to all the publicity, \"Girl's Night\" is the show for you!\n\nIt's also the show for Gwyneth Strong, who plays the role of Carol alongside Lucy Speed (EastEnders) and Donna Hazelton (winner of Channel 4's Musicality) in the musical comedy that was written in a Milton Keynes kitchen!\n\nFrom the pen of MK mum Louise Roche, this production follows five friends as they re-live their past on an hilarious karaoke night out and it's very likely that you’ll recognise every one of them! Carol was born to party, Anita says it like it is, Liza has ‘issues’ and Kate is boring but very handy for driving!\n\nIt's also packed with every girlie anthem you can think of including \"Dancing Queen\", \"I Will Survive\" and \"It’s Raining Men\".\n\nProbably best known for playing Cassandra, Rodney's long suffering wife in the hugely popular and long running \"Only Fools and Horses\", Gwyneth Strong made her stage debut at the Royal Court Theatre at the age of 10.\n\nSince then she has appeared in a variety of theatre, film and TV roles including Silent Witness, A Touch of Frost, Murder in Suburbia and Cry Freedom, directed by Richard Attenborough.\n\nShe is married to actor Jesse Birdsall [Footballers' Wives, El Dorado] and has two children, Oscar,18, and Lottie, 16.\n\nGwyneth told us all about her new role in the touching and funny ‘tell-it-like-it-is’ look at the lives of a group of female friends and revealed whether \"Only Fools\" was a burden or a blessing and how her children won't be following in the footsteps of their parents!\n\nWhat's your character Carol like?\n\nGwyneth: She's the life and soul of the party, the kind of girl I think that's in every girl gang. She's the one always on her feet, she loves dancing she loves partying and she's determined that everyone else will join in! I think she probably organises the evenings as well, she gets on the phone and says \"Are you coming?\", \"Get down there!\", \"Be there, or be square!\"\n\nDo people find her annoying or do they like her then?!\n\nGwyneth: I think they like it but she can be annoying too. Through the course of the evening as they have more drinks and have more life experiences I think she does get on some people's nerves a bit.\n\nHow would you describe Girls' Night then?\n\nGwyneth: A very warm, open, entertaining kind of piece really. When I read it I thought I'd really like to see this show! And a lot of the theatre I've done in the past is quite heavy and I think this is genuinely entertaining. And you've got this added bonus of the songs which are all these classics that are just so my era! I just love them, I think they're fantastic.\n\nAre you singing in it then?!\n\nGwyneth: [laughs] Only karaoke! I've made that very clear! Because everyone knows that karaoke is when you stand up when you're drunk and you howl a song out. That's what I'll be doing. Everyone else is a rather wonderful singer and they'll be doing the lovely singing!\n\nIs any thing in the show reminiscent of one of your nights out?!\n\nGwyneth: I haven't had a girls night out for many years now because I've gone very much the marriage and kids way and all that. But I think that the pattern of the dancing and the exuberance and then the tears and the row and then the making up, I think that all really rings true to me!\n\nIt's something that many women can identify with then?\n\nGwyneth: Yes, I think they will and I've been told that with the other productions that there have been of this show that the women just absolutely love it and it really lifts the roof.\n\nDo you like touring?\n\nGwyneth: Well, I've only ever really done it for three or four weeks at a time. This is my first time at a longer stretch and I am actually quite looking forward to it. Now that my kids are teenagers I think it's just about safe! But I'll be going back at the weekends to check on everything!\n\nI will miss home because I'm a bit of a home bird but it's worth it for the experience and it's good to go round different parts of the country.\n\nSo, do you prefer theatre to TV - what's your first love?\n\nGwyneth: I don't prefer one to the other particularly but I did start in the theatre. That was my first job when I was ten years old so I feel that I'm embedded in theatre really and I don't like to not go back to it, I don't like to leave it too long without going back.\n\nAnd there's always the excitement of the live reaction I suppose?\n\nGwyneth: Absolutely, and the more they keep telling me about this show I'm getting terrified. I think they shout out, dance and all sorts which is great because I haven't really done anything like that, anything as popular as that [in theatre]?\n\nBut you have done something that's VERY popular? Do you find \"Only Fools and Horses\" a burden or a blessing?\n\nGwyneth: I think it's both. Anybody who's in anything as popular as that as an actor will always have that sense of can I escape it? Can I get away from it? But at the end of the day I think you have to accept you can't. It was a great job, it was a good part, it was nicely written and there were really good actors in it, so there's all the plus side as well. You just have to take it on board. It IS a shadow as well though, over your work.\n\nBecause people like me keep asking you questions about it?!\n\nGwyneth: [laughs] Of course they do and that's fair enough, I accept that completely!\n\nBut you've got happy memories?\n\nGwyneth: Totally and that's the other thing, it's a piece of work I'm proud of so I don't mind being reminded of that!\n\nDo you think there'll be any more?\n\nGwyneth: I don't think so. I think it's finally been laid to rest!\n\nIs there anything you'd really like to do that you haven't done yet?\n\nGwyneth: I don't know. The thing I love about this business is that you never know what's coming next. I didn't know I'd be doing something like this and probably wouldn't have sat around thinking that I wanted to! Then when something comes along you think \"Oh what a great idea, I'd love to do that\". I like the not knowing what's coming. I don't hold out any great ambitions to do this or that, I just want to work really, and I want to do different work!\n\nAnd this character, Carol, is very different to anything I've played for a long time. She's quite ballsy - am I allowed to say that?! And the sort of character is much bigger than myself and parts that I've played. She's going to wear leopard skin for God's sake, so I'm going to have to rise to the leopard skin trousers, which I haven't even seen yet which is really worrying!\n\nCan you see any of her in you at all?\n\nGwyneth: In terms of when I'm with my girl friends I am quite bossy sometimes, I think I've got that quality but otherwise no, I think it will be me having to act!\n\nYour husband [Jesse Birdsall] acts as well, have you encouraged your children [18 and 16] into this profession? Do they want to follow you both?\n\nGwyneth: No! We've done a really good job and neither of them are remotely interested in acting or having anything to do with our business at all! We did it! They're going to be sensible and have jobs like normal people!\n\nHow did you manage that?\n\nGwyneth: I think the truth is that two actors in one family is enough! I think they've seen the reality of it which is that it's not glamorous and it's an insecure profession. My son is very clear that he wouldn't want that at all, he wants something steady. I think that's because he's been brought up by two parents that have a very changeable life and world.\n\nThey are very interested in what we do and the choices we make though, especially now they're older. They think it's great for us, they just don't want to do it themselves!\n\nDid you want them to act?\n\nGwyneth: No. I'm not so bad about it now but when they were younger I just thought \"Oh please let them do something else!\""
