        "text": "Only Fools and Horses star Gwyneth Strong is known for her portrayal of the iconic Cassandra Trotter.\n\nHer character went through many challenges with Rodney Trotter - with the two breaking up and making up many times due to cheating accusations as well as her ambitious nature. Cassandra first appeared in the episode Yuppy Love, where she attended the same adult education class as Rodney.\n\nThey met when he accidentally took her raincoat from the cloakroom. A few hours later, they crossed paths again and his pals Mickey Pearce and Jevon tried (but failed) to ask her for a dance. A confident Rodney even bet £20 that she would agree to dance with him and she did.\n\nDuring their relationship, she suffered a miscarriage before they went on to welcome a daughter named Joan - named after Del and Rodney's late mother. Gwyneth's last appearance as Cassandra in Only Fools and Horses was in the 2003 finale as well as the Christmas special titled Sleepless in Peckham.\n\nGwyneth's on-screen relationship came with endless drama but her real-life marriage is worlds away from Cassandra's marriage. She is married to soap star Jesse Birdsall, known for his roles in Footballers' Wives and Hollyoaks.\n\nGwyneth, 64, and Jesse got married in 2000 and went on to welcome two children - Oscar, born in 1988, and Lottie, born in 1991. He first gained recognition in the series Annika in the 80s and soon appeared in films Wish You Were Here and Getting It Right. The actor, 61, is also known for his portrayal of playboy Mascus Tandy in BBC1 soap Eldorado.\n\nBoth Jesse and his wife have had roles in EastEnders, but not at the same time. He played the fiancé of Sharon Watts in a small role in 2012 while she played Geraldine Clough, the leader of The Vic's competing darts team, in 2016.\n\nIn his personal life, Jesse had a few run-ins with the law, with the star getting a conviction for actual bodily harm in 1981 as well as a £1,000 fine in 1999 because of an unprovoked attack on a pub-goer in London. Meanwhile, Gwyneth had many roles in television including in Angels, Crown Court, Blood Kids, Casualty, Silent Witness, The Missing Postman, Midsomer Murders and The Great Train Robbery."
