        "text": "The UK has produced some of the most successful comedy shows of the last century.\n\nWhile American sitcoms are great for a bit of light-watching, they don't quite get you belly-laughing in quite the same way that British comedies do.\n\nFrom timeless classics such as Dad's Army and Fawlty Towers, to modern triumphs like Peep Show and The Office, UK comedy is golden.\n\nRead more: What happened to the cast of police drama The Bill\n\nBut arguably the best comedy show to have come out of this country is the iconic Only Fools and Horses.\n\nSet in Peckham, southeast London, John Sullvian's Only Fools and Horses follows market trader Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter and his younger brother Rodney on their mission to get rich quick.\n\nThe legendary show holds the record for the highest UK audience for a sitcom episode - with 24.3 million viewers tuning in for the episode 'Time on Our Hands' in 1996.\n\nOnly Fools and Horses was so popular it even had a number of spin-off shows, including The Green Green Grass, prequel Rock & Chips and a musical adaptation in 2019.\n\nThe original series came to an end in 1991 but the BBC produced a number of specials until it finally finished in 2003.\n\nThe success of the BBC series was undoubtedly made by its star studded cast, but what happened to the actors behind the characters we came to know and love?\n\nAs Only Fools and Horses approaches its 40th anniversary, KentLive takes a trip down memory lane to find out what the cast are up to now.\n\nDerek 'Del Boy' Trotter - Sir David Jason\n\nCharismatic, sweet-talking Del Boy was one of the most iconic characters in the history of television, but a horrifically bad salesman.\n\nNevertheless he was always out trying to scam someone into buying his dodgy goods, including 'Peckham Spring Water' which was just bottled water from his tap.\n\nSir David Jason had multiple roles before he took on the character of Del Boy, but it was Only Fools and Horses that really made his career.\n\nDespite being considered for the part late on, he made it his own - bringing in Del Boy's tacky gold jewellery and trademark camel coat.\n\nJason has won numerous awards for his acting career, including being knighted for services to acting and comedy in 2005.\n\nHis last major roles have included being Detective Inspector Jack Frost, which he retired from in 2010, and returning for Still Open All Hours in 2013.\n\nLife hasn't always been 'cushty' for Jason, whose long-term girlfriend Myfanwy Talog died of breast cancer in 1995.\n\nBut things started to look on the up for the actor after he became a father for the first time at the age of 61, when his 41-year-old girlfriend Gill Hinchcliffe, gave birth to baby Sophie Mae in 2001.\n\nThe pair married in 2005 and live as a family in Buckinghamshire.\n\nIn his free time, Jason is a patron of the Shark Trust, a regsitered charity working to advance the conservation of sharks through science, education, influence and action.\n\nHe is also Honorary Vice Patron of the Royal International Air Tattoo and a qualified helicopter pilot.\n\nIn 2017, it was reported that a \"credible threat\" was made to Jason's life, although it has not emerged why he was targeted.\n\nRodney Trotter - Nicholas Lyndhurst\n\nDel Boy's awkward and naïve younger brother Rodney was always eager to steer clear of his brother's get-rich-quick plans.\n\nThe innocent side kick, who acted as Del Boy's dogsbody, was often the punchline of the joke and, much like his older brother, never had much luck with the ladies as a result.\n\nBut he did eventually settle down with Cassandra, who he went on to marry.\n\nNicholas Lyndhurst has starred in a range of other popular sitcoms, a far cry from his Peckham character, including Goodnight Sweetheart, The Two of Us and After You've Gone.\n\nOutside the world of showbiz, Lyndhurst's hobbies include underwater diving, beekeeping and piloting his own aeroplanes.\n\nHe lives in West Wittering in West Sussex with his wife Lucy, a former ballet dancer, who he married in 1999.\n\nTheir son, Archie followed in his father's footsteps as an actor, appearing as Ollie Coulton in CBBC comedy series So Awkward.\n\nHowever the 19-year-old died in his sleep from a brain haemorrhage caused by acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukaemia earlier this year.\n\nLyndhurst shared the heartbreaking loss in a statement reading: \"Lucy and I are utterly grief stricken and respectfully request privacy.\"\n\nGrandad - Lennard Pearce\n\nUnfortunately the legendary character Grandad from the hit BBC series never made it to the end of filming, after he tragically passed away from a heart attack, aged 69, in 1988.\n\nDespite spending most of the show in his armchair, Grandad was a well-loved character, who was sadly missed after Pearce's untimely death.\n\nBut the actor had already had a successful career prior to the show, working alongside the likes of Laurence Olivier and Anthony Hopkins in theatre productions.\n\nUncle Albert - Buster Merryfield\n\nAfter Pearce's death in 1988, Uncle Albert was introduced to the Trotter household to replace him\n\nBuster Merryfield surprisingly didn't have much acting experience, only becoming a professional actor at the age of 57, but he was chosen based on his iconic white beard, which became fondly associated with the character of Unc.\n\nThe estranged brother of the Trotter's late Grandad, Uncle Albert could often be heard reminiscing about his career in the Royal Navy during the wartime.\n\nMerryfield was just as much the comedian in real life - in 1997 he fell over at the British Comedy Awards while walking to the stage to collect an award for David Jason.\n\nDespite cutting his forehead, he continued on and collected the award.\n\nSadly, Merryfield also never made it to see the end of Only Fools and Horses, tragically dying at the age of 78 in 1999 as a result of a brain tumour.\n\nHis death was written into the series as a tribute - possibly one of the only serious moments in the comedy's history.\n\nRaquel Turner - Tessa Peake-Jones\n\nThe character of Raquel was only meant to have a one-off appearance, as the writers wanted more female characters on-screen.\n\nBut she soon became a permanent character after the production team thought she'd make a good love interest for Del Boy.\n\nThe pair had their fair share of ups and downs, but they eventually settled down and had a son, Damien.\n\nThe actress has since gone on to appear in various British TV shows, including Midsomer Murders, Doctors, Casualty, Holby City and Doctor Who.\n\nShe made headlines recently after it emerged she married her on-screen son, who was played by Douglas Hodge.\n\nThe couple have two children together, Mollie Rose and Charlie, but unfortunately split in February 2013 after being married for 27 years.\n\nTrigger - Roger Lloyd-Pack\n\nThe 'village idiot' character Trigger was best known for always failing to get Rodney's name right - instead calling him Dave.\n\nRoger went on to get leading roles in an array of TV shows, including The Vicar of Dibley, Doctor Who and US drama The Borgias.\n\nHe also went on to star in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, in which he played the role of Barty Crouch Snr.\n\nLloyd-Pack was married twice - first to Sheila Ball and then to the poet and dramatist Jehane Markham.\n\nHe had a daughter, actress Emily Lloyd, and three sons, and lived in Kentish Town, north London.\n\nIn his spare time Lloyd-Pack supported Tottenham Hotspur - even voicing the pre-match build-up montage video shown ahead of all Tottenham Hotspur's home matches, which is still played today.\n\nSadly, the popular actor died from pancreatic cancer in 2014 at the age of 69.\n\nCo-stars David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst were amongst those who attended his funeral.\n\nBoycie - John Challis\n\nCar salesman Boycie was just as untrustworthy as Del Boy, but a lot less likeable.\n\nDespite spending most of the time boasting about his wealth, the character was so popular he went on to continue the role in Only Fools and Horses spin-off, The Green Green Grass.\n\nThe comedy show followed Boycie and his wife Marlene as they went on the run from a criminal gang.\n\nChallis has continued to pursue his actor career since the end of Only Fools and Horses and the subsequent spin offs.\n\nHe's since gone on to have roles in Doctors, Are You Being Served and Benidorm.\n\nChallis' personal life is almost as eventful as his characters - having been divorced three times and married four times.\n\nHe has no children but currently lives with his fourth wife Carol in Herfordshire.\n\nChallis is a patron of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society and an Arsenal supporter, when he isn't acting.\n\nHe recently wrote two autobiographies but had to cancel his book tour this year after his management revealed he had been living with a secret cancer diagnosis since 2019.\n\nMarlene Boyce - Sue Holderness\n\nBoycie's wife Marlene didn't appear on the show until 1985.\n\nIt was often implied that she might have been romantically involved with all of her husband's friends and there were even rumours that Del Boy was the father of the pair's child.\n\nActress Sue Holderness only appeared in 20 episodes of Only Fools and Horses but went on to reprise the role in the spin-off The Green Green Grass.\n\nShe has also appeared in a variety of UK shows, including Doctors, Casualty, Still Open All Hours and Cold Feet.\n\nShe recently joined the cast of EastEnders as newcomer Estelle.\n\nSue keeps her personal life relatively private, but has made regularly appearances in pantomime shows throughout her career.\n\nDenzil Tulser - Paul Barber\n\nLiverpudlian lorry-driver Denzil was a loveable character who was often the victim of Del Boy's scams.\n\nActor Paul Barber had a tough start in life after he was taken into care at the age of seven, following the death of his mother from tuberculosis.\n\nHis father died when Barber and his siblings were very young.\n\nWhilst he was in care, he was abused both physically and mentally - he noted that he has suffered like others, but channeled his emotions into acting.\n\nAfter Only Fools and Horses Barber went on to appear in a number of UK shows include Brookside, and the classic male stripper comedy film, The Full Monty.\n\nHe is still working today - recent credits include CBBC children’s show The Dumping Ground, Casualty and Death in Paradise.\n\nIn July 2011 Barber, who lives in Essex, was awarded an honorary doctorate from Liverpool John Moores University for \"outstanding contribution to the performing arts\".\n\nCassandra Trotter - Gwyneth Strong\n\nGwyneth Strong played Rodney's girlfriend Cassandra, who he eventually married at the end of series six.\n\nThe actress has since enjoyed success in the world of TV and film - appearing in Casualty and Doctors, while also playing the recurring role of Geraldine Clough on EastEnders since 2016.\n\nShe also has an impressive number of stage credits - including the role of Kath Casey in a 2008 West End production of Madness’s Our House.\n\nGwyneth has been married to Footballers’ Wives star Jesse Birdsall since 2000 and they have two children together, Oscar and Lottie.\n\nMickey Pearce - Patrick Murray\n\nMickey Pearce was famous for having a way with women - which often led to him running off with Rodney's girlfriends.\n\nThe arrogant character was prone to making exaggerated claims about his business success and prowess with the ladies.\n\nActor Patrick Murray landed a couple of big parts following the success of Only Fools and Horses, including in films Curse of the Pink Pather and The Firm, but he has since retired.\n\nMurray has pursued a range of careers since, including a cabbie in Kent, a builder for a period of time and even a professional poker player at one point.\n\nThe actor is a staunch supporter of Millwall F.C., often being recognised whilst sitting in the stands.\n\nIn September 2017, Murray made headlines after it emerged that he would be separated from his Thai wife and their daughter Josie following a visa row.\n\nThe Home Office had denied a visa to his wife and daughter on the grounds he didn’t earn enough money to support them.\n\nIn 2018, Murray was supposed to take part in a bus trip that would raise money for Demelza, a children's hospice in Kent.\n\nHowever, the trip was called off last minute after Murray revealed he is receiving treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nHe hopes to complete the trip later this year, which will see him entertain 70 fans while travelling from Leysdown-on-Sea in Kent to Margate.\n\nSid - Roy Heather\n\nSid owned a derelict cafe in Peckham in Only Fools and Horses, but eventually went on to become the landlord of local pub The Nag's Head.\n\nWhile fighting in the Second World War he was captured then escaped, only for his boat to be sunk by a Greek fishing trawler being steered by Uncle Albert.\n\nHe may have only appeared in 13 episodes, but Heather clocked up an impressive CV of TV credits following the show, including The Bill, My Family, Birds of a Feather and Bottom.\n\nSadly, Roy died on 3 September 2014 aged 79 of undisclosed causes.\n\nMike - Kenneth MacDonald\n\nDim-witted landlord of The Nags Head, Mike Fisher, was another character who was often subjected to Del Boy's scams and constantly struggled to get him to pay off his bar tab.\n\nActor Kenneth MacDonald, left school at eighteen to help support his mother Emily, taking a job at a Kellogg's cornflakes factory.\n\nDetermined to pursue a career in acting, during night shifts he would perform Hamlet and other Shakespeare plays that he had learned at school.\n\nHe also took on the role as Gunner \"Nobby\" Clark in BBC sitcom, It Ain't Half Hot Mum and appeared in the Channel 4 soap Brookside.\n\nUnfortunately Actor Kenneth MacDonald died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 2001 aged just 50 while on holiday with his family in Hawaii.\n\nOn hearing of MacDonald's death, Only Fools And Horses star David Jason said: \"It is a terrible shock.\n\n\"It is like losing a member of the family, because he was one of the warmest, kindest people that I have had the good fortune to meet in my career.\""
