        "text": "ONLY Fools And Horses’ Gwyneth Strong has told Scots fans she’ll go from Trotter to rotter when she stars in the legendary play The Mousetrap.\n\nThe actress, who played Rodney Trotter’s wife Cassandra in the classic BBC comedy, is cast as nasty Mrs Boyle in the production, which comes to Edinburgh on Monday.\n\nAnd she warns there will be nothing nice about her when she appears in the whodunnit.\n\nShe says: “Mrs Boyle is a very bad-tempered older lady — there’s certainly nothing bubbly about her.\n\n“But it’s rather good fun to come on stage and stomp about and be in a bad mood as I always have a lovely day afterwards — because I’ve totally got that out my system.”\n\nAgatha Christie’s murder mystery opened in London in 1952 and is still going strong — earning its place in the Guinness World Records for the longest- running West End show.\n\nLine of Duty star Martin Compston parties in Celtic dressing room after treble Treble win\n\nThe crime writer signed a strict contract which stipulated that only one production could tour the UK annually in addition to the residency at the UK capital’s St Martin’s Theatre.\n\nGwyneth adds: “It’s having an incredible response on the road, which I just find amazing considering how old the play is.”\n\nThe Londoner began her career on shows including The Adventures Of Black Beauty before going on to have numerous TV roles in the 70s and 80s.\n\nBut life changed in 1989 when she joined David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst.\n\nGwyneth, who has two grown-up children Lottie and Oscar to Footballers’ Wives star hubby Jesse Birdsall, recalls: “I had been a child actor, so I did used to get recognised a little bit for shows I’d done — but nothing like Only Fools And Horses.\n\n\"My first show went out on a Saturday night and when I walked out the front door with my six-month-old son that was it — anonymity over.”\n\nThe 59-year-old — who now has twin grandkids — remains a regular on the box, starring in the Great Train Robbery in 2013 with Jim Broadbent and Martin Compston.\n\nBut she’s delighted to be in The Mousetrap, she adds: “I just feel sorry for all the other poor actors because the only time they see me is when I’m shouting at them.”\n\nTHE Mousetrap will be at Edinburgh’s Playhouse from May 27 to 29 and Glasgow’s Theatre Royal from October 28 to November 2.\n\nmatt.bendoris@the-sun.co.uk"
