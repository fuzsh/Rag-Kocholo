        "text": "GWYNETH Strong still looks as youthful as she did when she starred in Only Fools and Horses 35 years ago.\n\nThe sitcom actress was shoehorned into the show as the character Cassandra Trotter after concerns that it was too \"blokey\".\n\nShe joined the cast alongside Tessa Peake-Jones, who was tasked with playing Raquel.\n\nThe women were so loved by fans that they ended up starring on the rest of the BBC series until it wrapped up in 2003.\n\nGwyneth then went on to surprise viewers with a guest appearance on EastEnders in 2016.\n\nShe was snapped going for a stroll along the streets of London today, and the actress looked strikingly similar to when she played Rodney Trotter’s long-suffering wife Cassandra.\n\nGwyneth had a youthful glow as she made adjustments to a large handbag while engrossed in a conversation with a friend.\n\nShe still has a similar hairstyle to the one she wore on Only Fools and Horses, sporting a fringe and layered hair.\n\nThe sitcom followed the story of two brothers who try to make more bang for their buck while reselling second-hand goods.\n\nIt was first broadcast on September 8, 1981, and ran for 64 episodes.\n\nGwyneth later shared that she developed a friendship with Tessa on set, but added: \"We were never really alone together because that wasn't the push of the storyline really, we were their partners.\"\n\nDuring its long run Only Fools attracted fans from all walks of life including the Royal Family.\n\nIt still holds the record for the most-watched comedy ever after 24.3million people tuned in to watch stars Del and Rodney finally become millionaires.\n\nNicholas Lyndhurst was first to be cast, as dopey Rodney. He was just 19.\n\nThe inspiration for the character came from writer John Sullivan himself."
