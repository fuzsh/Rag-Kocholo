And now it’s pretty great.\"\n\nMarch 1, 2024: Gwyneth Paltrow shares a birthday tribute as Brad Falchuk turns 53\n\nIn honor of Falchuk turning 53, Paltrow shared a photo of the two of them cuddled up on a beach on Instagram.\n\n\"Happy birthday @bradfalchuk,\" she wrote. \"You are my everything💙.\"\n\nOn her Instagram Story, Paltrow showed off a plate of hashbrowns with fried eggs on top, adding, \"Birthday #boyfriendbreakfast.\""
