        "text": "Agatha Christie’s record-breaking murder mystery ‘The Mousetrap’ will come to The Lowry Mon 13 – Sat 18 May and will star ‘Only Fools and Horses’ actor Gwyneth Strong as Mrs Boyle.\n\nThe legendary whodunnit from the Queen of Crime, Dame Agatha Christie, is directed by Gareth Armstrong.\n\nThis unstoppable West End hit has been delighting theatregoers for 67 years with its macabre murder mystery. Following a record-breaking 60th anniversary debut tour in 2012, this timeless thriller will travel the length and breadth of the country, stopping in Salford to give North West audiences the chance to discover theatre’s best kept secret.\n\nGwyneth Strong will perform as Mrs Boyle alongside David Alcock (Mr Paravacini), Geoff Arnold (Detective Sgt. Trotter), Nick Biadon (Giles Ralston), Lewis Chandler (Christopher Wren), John Griffiths (Major Metcalf), Harriett Hare (Mollie Ralston) and Saskia Vaigncourt-Strallen (Miss Caswell).\n\nGwyneth Strong is best known for her role in the BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses in which she starred in the role of Cassandra. The role gained Gwyneth mainstream recognition and she appeared in the hit comedy show as well as several Christmas specials between 1989 and 2003. More recently, she joined the cast of EastEnders in the role of Geraldine Clough. Other television credits include ‘The Great Train Robbery,’ ‘Silent Witness,’ ‘Casualty,’ ‘Doctors’ and ‘Murder in Suburbia.’ Gwyneth appeared in the UK tour of Our House, in which she played Kath Casey. Her stage credits also include ‘Stand’ (Oxford Playhouse/Battersea Arts) ‘Monkey Bars’ (Unicorn Theatre), ‘A Round-Heeled Woman’ (Aldwych), ‘When You Cure Me’ (Bush Theatre), ‘Ancient Lights’ (Hampstead Theatre) and ‘Care’ (Royal Court).\n\nFirst seen in Nottingham in 1952 starring Richard Attenborough and his wife Sheila Sim, ‘The Mousetrap’ went on to become the world’s longest running stage production following its West End transfer to The Ambassadors in 1952 and St Martins in 1973 where it has played ever since, continuing a record-breaking run with over 27,500 performances in London to date. The beloved murder mystery returns to the road following the success of the first ever UK tour in 2012.\n\nIn addition to this UK tour ‘The Mousetrap’ continues its open-ended run at St. Martin’s Theatre, London."
