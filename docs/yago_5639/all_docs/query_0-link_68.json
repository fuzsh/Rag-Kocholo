Never once did she wonder why God chose her to bear that cross, instead she asked, \"Why not me?\"\n\nShe was born in Iron Mountain, Michigan, to Ray and Jennie Saler. She married and spent 42 wonderful years with her loving husband Ken. Judy is survived by Ken, a son Kevin (Amy), a daughter Kerry (Matt) Lang, and grandchildren: Kassie, Danny, Erin, Collin, Delaney and MacKenzie, brothers: John (Renate) Saler and Robert (Cheryl) Saler and many nieces, nephews, cousins, other relatives, friends and her dog Libby.\n\nNothing was more important to Judy than her 6 grandchildren. They were the topic of most of her conversations. She kept her lawn chair and bleacher seat in the car so she was ready to attend any activity at any time. For the last few summers, Judy would have \"Camp Grandma\" sessions out at the lake entertaining the grandkids for hours with silly new games. She absolutely loved it!\n\nJudy was active in sports. An avid golfer, she had quite a knack for the game. She taught her children and grandchildren how to play the game as well. As a member of the Peptoes volleyball team, she went to the Senior Olympics where her team of \"old\" friends placed 5th nationally. Judy coached and played softball and tennis and was a well-rounded athlete.\n\nShe also enjoyed gardening and planted anywhere she could find an open spot of dirt. Each summer, it seemed like a new garden was added somewhere around the yard so she could plant all of the new varieties she would read about. Ken and Judy maintained the flower beds of St. Paul Church for many years. As the season changed, they would head for the warmer climate of Destin, Florida. She was happy to get away from the cold Wisconsin weather and the opportunity to continue her golf game. Judy learned a lot about the Bible with her friends in her Bible study group at Resurrection Catholic Church in Destin.\n\nOne of her latest passions was scrap booking. Between their travels and the many sporting events she had ample opportunity to gather new photos. Everywhere she went, her camera was always with her. She loved to take pictures and turn them into beautiful and meaningful scrapbook pages.\n\nJudy's mass of Christian Burial will be 4 p.m. on Monday, April 9, 2007, at ST PAUL CATHOLIC CHURCH, 410 E. Wallace Street, Combined Locks, with Fr. Jim Lucas officiating. Friends will be received at Church on Monday, from 2 p.m. until the time of service. All are welcome to join the family for a dinner following the mass. In lieu of flowers, a memorial is being established in her name. The Boettcher Family Funeral Home, Kaukauna, is assisting the family. 920-766-2099\n\nWe would especially like to thank the doctors, nurses and staff in both the Oncology Unit and Intensive Care Unit at Appleton Medical Center. In addition, we would like to thank our loving and caring neighbors who made the last 3 months easier for us\n\n4/8/2007 GBPG\n\nPosted April 8, 2007\n\nAlberts, Stella B.\n\nStella B.
