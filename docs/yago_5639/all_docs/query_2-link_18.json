        "text": "Addressing the audience, she confessed: “We never saw that coming at all.”\n\nHost Christine Lampard asked: “I think I'm right in saying that neither of you was fully aware of what the show was before you went to audition for it?”\n\nShaking her head, Tessa admitted before turning to her co-star Gwyneth: “I’d never seen it no, had you?”\n\nHer long-running cast mate replied: “My family were a fan of it, so I did.”\n\n\"We'd do big group scenes but we didn't really have anything together.\"\n\n\"I think we need a spin-off, don't we? Come on,\" Adil pleaded.\n\nThe acting duo first appeared in the comedy in 1988 and stayed on the show until the very last episode.\n\nThe show’s finale, titled Sleepless in Peckham, aired in 2003 and saw the Trotters face being evicted from their Nelson Mandela House after losing their fortune.\n\nHowever, in a surprise twist, the family land on their feet when an investment from late Uncle Albert saved the day.\n\nLoose Women airs weekdays on ITV at 12:30 pm."
