Cassandra Trotter, played by Gwyneth Strong, had her fair share of ups and downs in Only Fools and Horses.

This included multiple break-ups with Rodney - usually after being falsely accused of cheating, or for being too ambitious - and also suffering a miscarriage.

However, the couple got their happy ending in the end, later having a daughter Joan, named after Del Boy and Rodney’s late mother.

Although her love life was rocky in the show, in real life she is happily settled down with a fellow television star.

Gwyneth Strong, now 61-years-old, is married to Jesse Birdsall, star of Footballers’ Wives.

The pair got married back in 2000, after having two children together - Oscar, who was born in 1988, and Lottie, born in 1991.

Arsenal fan Jesse Birdsall starred in ‘notable flop’ Eldorado, a BBC soap set in Spain, following the lives of wealthy expats.

Despite the show only running for one year, his role as playboy Marcus Tandy gained him a lot of exposure, and he went on to secure a role in Footballers’ Wives.

Outside of the world of TV, Birdsall has twice been in trouble with the police. He was convicted of actual bodily harm after an altercation in 1981, and in 1999 was fined £1,000 following an unprovoked attack on a fellow customer at a pub in London.

On screen, both husband and wife subsequently went on to appear in EastEnders, though not at the same time as one another.

Jesse appeared in the soap in 2012 as jilted fiancée of Sharon Watts, with Gwyneth joining the square in 2016 as Geraldine Clough, head of The Vic’s rival dart team.
