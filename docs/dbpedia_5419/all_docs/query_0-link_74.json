Nasir is interested broadly in the fields of black popular culture, black political thought, and Caribbean Studies, especially in thinking about how culture becomes revolt. His research maps migrations of performances of \"badness\" in post-slave societies and employs a cultural studies approach to investigate the ways these “bad” personas have been reconstituted in the neoliberal context.

She obtained her BA in Anthropology and Law, History, and Society from Vanderbilt University in 2022. Her doctoral work will focus on the role of individual diet and community foodways in creating local and state identities, and how groups in the distant past utilized food to resist, mitigate, or reimagine encroachment from imperial entities. As an anthropologist, she aims to combine archaeological chemistry with traditional bioarchaeological methods to answer pertinent social questions about life in the prehistoric Peruvian Andes. Alyssa has also conducted bioarchaeological and forensic fieldwork in the continental United States and France and conducted bioarchaeological and forensic research projects for sites in Belize, Guatemala, and the UAE.\n\nLicelot Caraballo is a graduate student in the Department of Anthropology at Brown. Caraballo's primary academic research interest is in transnational mobility, particularly on the Dominico-Haitian border. Caraballo studies sites called border markets where the predominant working force are Haitian and Dominican women. Caraballo examines how these border markets allow for a suspension of the otherwise strict citizenship regulations in the Dominican state (where these markets are located). They maintain that through border crossing, Haitian women create spaces of solidarity and protection in a way that establishes agency as well as a sense of belonging. At Brown, they hope to build on this research through the extensive research opportunities that allow for one's intellectual and professional growth. Caraballo envisions working collaboratively with faculty and students on themes of migration, gender, and transnational labor, especially within the Center for Latin America and Caribbean Studies and the Cogut Institute for the Humanities. Their aim is to contribute through their dissertation to larger, more inclusive conversations regarding transborder mobility.\n\nBen Salinasis a graduate student in the Anthropology department at Brown University.

Using a paleoethnobotanical approach that involves identifying starch grains, phytoliths, and macrobotanical remains, his research aims to comprehend the combinations, cooking techniques, and ancient culinary preferences, along their social connotations. Lately, his research focus has delved into exploring how past ingredients and cooking activities may have stimulated sensory experiences, thereby influencing the daily lives of the Maya people. More broadly, he is interested by the intricate interplay between the senses, food, and agricultural production practices within ancient Maya society.\n\nDaiana Rivas-Tello is a graduate student in the Department of Anthropology.
