        "text": "Climate-related extremes characterized by higher temperatures and whiplash precipitation have been noted globally, compromising the reliability of water resources to serve agriculture, ecosystems, and population. Increased frequency and intensity of such hydrologic extremes has impacted both water infrastructure and access to usable water in California and many regions in Mexico alike.\n\nThe project “Water Resources Management in Agriculture and Ecosystems to Improve Climate Extreme Resilience in Mexico and the United States” aims to join efforts from academic, governmental and industry stakeholders to work collaboratively in four thematic areas to advance climate resilience namely: Climate Data Science, Integrated Water Resources Management, Groundwater Sustainability and Resilient Communities. Major project outcomes include student and research staff research infrastructure skill development, faculty and research staff academic exchange, refereed journal articles, research reports and policy briefs.\n\nA second Workshop of the UC Alianza MX – UC project “Water Management to Increase Climate Resilience in Mexico and the United States” was held on October 19 and 20 in Casa California, Mexico city. 40 attendees in person and virtually from the academy, governmental, industry and non-profit entities contributed to a highly productive discussion on water resources around our four core research areas: Resilient communities, Climate Data Science, Groundwater Sustainability, and Integrated Water Management. The event was organized by the UC Alianza MX staff and UC Merced Water systems management Lab.\n\nThe participants provided updates of on-going research endeavors and academic exchange experiences carried out during the last year. The original four concept thrusts mentioned above were discussed through individual presentations during the technical sessions and group brainstorming took place during the working sessions. Networking dinners were provided where it was once again expressed the enthusiasm and collaborative spirit of the group."
