        "text": "From structural design to on-site delivery, entire buildings can be manufactured at the Ternium Mexico plant located in the municipality of Ciénega de Flores, Nuevo León.\n\nTernium’s Metallic Buildings plant offers comprehensive solutions designed to meet particular customer needs in sectors such as high-specification construction, the automotive industry, white goods, and service centers.\n\nLocated in Ciénega de Flores, Nuevo León, the company’s Metallic Buildings Plant makes structures from Ternium steel to build distribution centers, self-service stores, conservation, and refrigeration warehouses, and hangars, to name just a few examples in the industrial buildings category.\n\nThese steel structures have also been used in the construction of the plants at the Pesquería I and Pesquería II projects.\n\nTernium's Metallic Buildings plant is located in the municipality of Ciénega de Flores, Nuevo León.\n\nThe plant is the first one in Latin America to be awarded the AC472 Metal Building Systems Inspection Accreditation certification, issued by the International Accreditation Service, a nonprofit organization that accredits businesses, governmental entities, and other organisms.\n\nThis certification guarantees the quality of the engineering and manufacturing standards according to customer specifications.\n\n“These certifications are highly prized by our customers, particularly those with foreign specifications. The qualification is recognized by most of them as it is a way for them to ensure the quality of the product they are purchasing,” commented Neftalí Barrios, Business Manager of Metallic Buildings.\n\nAlso on the roster of services offered by the Metallic Buildings plant is the supply of materials to build industrial warehousing or a pre-engineered or conventional building.\n\nBarrios added that the competitive advantages presented by buildings made from Ternium steel include quality, speed of engineering, design optimization, and the customized manufacture of structures, as well as a proprietary roof and façade lamination system.\n\n\"We offer our customers a comprehensive solution, providing the entire building, including value engineering as it is made to measure. It’s completed according to the customer’s requirements and the whole process is carried out as efficiently as possible. Our niche expertise complemented by our value engineering means that we continue to lead the field at the national level.”\n\nSome of the structures manufactured at the Ternium Metallic Buildings plant are customized to meet customer requirements.\n\nThe manager of Metallic Buildings explained that the challenges facing the company today are architectural, as well as developing new markets and continuing to meet customer expectations.\n\n\"The flexibility offered by Metallic Buildings today, compared with ten years ago, has completely changed the team’s outlook, shifting our customer focus, the approach taken by engineering, and the vision of all those of us working here,\" he added.\n\n\"This plant is known for its prompt and detailed attention to monitoring customer requirements throughout the different construction phases of its building process,\" said Gerardo Azuara, Head of Sales and Estimates of Metallic Buildings.\n\n\"Something that sets us apart from our peers in the industry is our experience in developing structural designs adapted to customer requirements of different complexities, including cranes,\" said Gerardo Zamora, Chief of Engineering at Metallic Buildings.\n\nMetallic Buildings has a staff of 150 employees certified and qualified in processes such as submerged-arc welding and micro-wire welding. These employees receive training on a constant basis.\n\n\"All our welders are certified and are members of the American Welding Society program,\" said Juan Manuel Martínez, Production Engineer.\n\n“In Metallic Buildings, we need large numbers of personnel as work is personalized and we make unique pieces. The plant has had zero accidents in the last two economic activity periods, thanks to the standards of our processes and the high level of training received by our people.”\n\n\"This plant is not only certified and qualified but also complies with all safety standards to offer completely safe workspaces,\" added Gloria Guajardo, Commercial analyst. \"Our ongoing challenge is to capitalize future investments in Metallic Building projects in Mexico in order to continue making operations as safe as possible,\" she explained."
