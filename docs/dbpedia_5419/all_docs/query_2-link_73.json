        "text": "As CEO of All4Spas, creator of Agave Spa product line, wellness expert and a recognized Latin American Wellness Leader, what can you tell us about your career journey that few people know?\n\nBefore becoming an entrepreneur, I was a preschool teacher, a storyteller, and I set up a library. In addition, I co-created a reading program with grandparents for the school where I worked, and alongside the Fondo de Cultura Económica, we expanded it to other parts of Mexico. I also wrote children’s stories.\n\nYou support various causes and organizations, which ones are you most passionate about and why?\n\nI support the Wellness for Cancer initiative, which has helped me gain awareness and participate in important associations such as FUCAM and Jóvenes con Cáncer. I have always cared a lot about animals, so we also support the Chacahua turtle camp and various dog shelters.\n\nRecently, you were honored with a Barbie doll created in your likeness. Has this impacted your professional and personal life and what can you share with us about the process and the importance of this?\n\nI think this honor helped me understand the importance of following my dreams. I was feeling hopeless, having just lost two important people, this grounded me and I realized giving up was not an option. If someone like me, without the profile of a Barbie doll, could be recognized for what I have achieved and overcome, then I must be aware of the value of what I created. Having a Barbie alongside people as prestigious as Shonda Rhymes empowered me and helped me understand that part of my legacy is to inspire and share the message that you can be anything you want to be, with endless possibilities.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone looking to start a business in this industry?\n\nTo have patience, tolerance, and openness. Focus on what you can offer, emphasizing your strengths without downplaying the competition. If we understood this as an industry in Latin America, we would be stronger and better positioned in the market, setting a good example. In the end, we are all wellness ambassadors.\n\nWhat other achievements do you hope to accomplish in the future?\n\nVery important things are on the horizon. I am about to celebrate my 50th birthday with almost 20 years dedicated to the world of wellness and I am leading a project that is my life’s dream. I will continue moving forward, staying positive, and sharing my experiences, both good and bad, and the joys of wellness, helping our industry to grow."
