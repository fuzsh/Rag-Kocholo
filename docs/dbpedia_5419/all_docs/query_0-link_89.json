        "text": "Caloxiphus chapulhuacan n. sp. Barrientos-Lozano & Rocha-Sánchez\n\n( Figs. 1–10 View FIGURES 1–9 View FIGURE 10 )\n\nurn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:0170D237-40DE-43CF-8D5E-2C46CE481C33\n\nExamined material. Type ♀. Mexico, Hidalgo, Chapulhuacán, Puerto El Zopilote, 1050 masl, 31.X.2010, 21°09.137’N 98°56.385’W, leg. L. Barrientos-Lozano & Aurora Y. Rocha-Sánchez. Paratypes. ♀ GoogleMaps , nymph, same data as type GoogleMaps .\n\nDiagnosis. C. chapulhuacan n. sp., may be compared with C. championi (see Cigliano et al., 2020; http://orthoptera.speciesfile.org/Common/basic/ShowAllImages.aspx). It may be distinguished of the latter species by its larger size (37.5 vs. 25 mm) ( Figs. 1 View FIGURES 1–9 , 10 View FIGURE 10 ). Tegmina are shorter (16.8 vs. 18.5 mm) –reaching about mid length of abdomen- the upper and lower margin looks almost linear -at rest- and the distal apex is broader ( Figs. 1 View FIGURES 1–9 , 10 View FIGURE 10 ). The pronotum ( Figs. 4–5 View FIGURES 1–9 ) is more densely granulated and granules are more conspicuous, the posterior margin is moderately produced and both, anterior and posterior margin possess each a small size tubercle about mid length. Cerci, carinae on ovipositor, and subgenital plate are also different ( Figs. 6–9 View FIGURES 1–9 ). These set of characters are not so in C. championi (see Cigliano et al., 2020; http://orthoptera.speciesfile.org/ Common/basic/ShowAllImages. aspx).\n\nMale. Unknown\n\nFemale description ( Figs. 1–10 View FIGURES 1–9 View FIGURE 10 ). General body color ( Figs. 1 View FIGURES 1–9 , 10 View FIGURE 10 ) brown to light brown with dark green marks on face, pronotum, legs, and abdomen. Fastigium of vertex ( Fig. 2 View FIGURES 1–9 ) subtriangular distally rounded, surpassing slightly the antennal sockets, broad and deeply sulcate along midline; fastigium frontalis ( Fig. 3 View FIGURES 1–9 ) yellowish subconical. Antennae brownish-crème with dark brown-black segments intercalated. Head ( Figs. 1 View FIGURES 1–9 , 10 View FIGURE 10 ) dorsally light to dark brown with two delicate postocular lateral crème bands, one each side. Pronotum ( Figs. 4–5 View FIGURES 1–9 , 10 View FIGURE 10 ) rounded, dorsally dark green-brown color, densely granulated, posterior margin weakly produced, anterior and posterior margin moderately emarginated bearing each a small tubercle about mid-portion; anterior margin’s tubercle smaller. The dorsal main sulci cuts deeply the lateral carinae and the lateral lobes. Lateral lobes of pronotum ( Figs. 5 View FIGURES 1–9 , 10 View FIGURE 10 ) light brown-creamy color with dark green areas, strongly emarginated, anterior angle almost rect posterior rounded obtuse-angulated. Tegmina ( Figs. 1 View FIGURES 1–9 , 10 View FIGURE 10 ) brownish color, short about mid-length of abdomen. Legs creme with darkgreen ornamentation. Femora spines: anterior inner face 2 spines, external face without spines; mid internal face without spines, external face 3 spines; posterior internal face without spines, external face 7 spines (5 large: 2 small). Tibiae spines: anterior inner face 7 small spines, external face 7 spines on lower margin; mid internal face 8 spines on upper margin and 8 on lower margin, external face 6 spines on lower margin; posterior internal face 18 spines on upper margin and 9 on lower margin, external face 13 spines on upper margin and 11 on lower margin. Cerci ( Figs. 6–9 View FIGURES 1–9 ) basally robust tapering gradually, distally curved inwards, apex like a broad black spine. Supraanal plate ( Fig. 6 View FIGURES 1–9 ) sub-quadrate. Subgenital plate and ovipositor as shown in Figs. 7–9 View FIGURES 1–9 .\n\nMeasurements (mm). Body length, from vertex anterior margin mid-portion to end of abdomen, 37.5. Pronotum length, along midline, 5.7. Femora length, anterior, mid, and posterior, respectively: 11.3, 10.8, 20.9. Length of tegmina, 16.8. Length of ovipositor, 16.4.\n\nDistribution (Fig. 31). This species is known only from its type Locality, municipality of Chapulhuacán at the Huasteca Region in the State of Hidalgo, Mexico.\n\nHabitat. C. chapulhuacan n. sp., inhabits the Biogeographical Province of the Easter Sierra Madre (ESM) at the Huasteca Region in Hidalgo, Mexico. The ecosystem this species lives on is tropical rainforest and oak forest; it is found usually on the foliage or trunk of trees. During the day, adults remain quiet and hidden, being active at night. Climate in the municipality of Chapulhuacán is warm-humid with rains all year, average annual temperature and precipitation are 24 °C and 2,270 mm, respectively.\n\nEtymology. Specific epithet refers to the type Locality “Chapulhuacán”, word of “Náhuatl” origin that means “Grasshoppers’ Place”."
