        "text": "The Wilson Center's Mexico Institute invites you to a book launch and discussion on Mexico's political system. Wilson Center Global Fellow Luis Rubio will present his book, The Problem of Power: Mexico Requires a New System of Government. After his presentation, leading analysts will discuss the system of governance and concentration of power in Mexico, as well as policy prescriptions to improve Mexico's political system.\n\nThe Problem of Power is a reflection of the internal and external causes of the weakness of the Mexican political system, as well as an analysis of the opportunities to transform it. As stated in the introduction, the main message of the book is the need to build institutions and strengthen the rule of law based on due process so that government and the political sector in Mexico is more responsive to its citizens’ needs and aspirations and less focused on preserving the benefits inherent in the status quo. This implies a need for the transformation and professionalization of all three branches of government at all three levels, municipal, state and federal.\n\nDownload the book (available in both English and Spanish)\n\nSpeakers\n\nLuis Rubio\n\nGlobal Fellow & Advisory Board Member, Mexico Institute, Wilson Center\n\nPresident, Centro de Investigación para el Desarrollo (CIDAC)\n\nVerónica Ortiz-Ortega\n\nPolitical Analyst, El Economista and Canal del Congreso\n\nOliver Azuara\n\nEconomics Specialist, Inter-American Development Bank\n\nModerator"
