        "text": "Introduction\n\nTaxation is at the core of the life of a business. The rate and way enterprises are taxed affect peopleâs propensity to start and close a business; business investments and, accordingly, business growth prospects; the decision of business owners to declare, fully or partly, their business income and to incorporate or not their own enterprise; or still the preference of entrepreneurs for certain sectors rather than for others, if sectors are not taxed effectively so as to minimize resource misallocation.\n\nIntuitively, high business taxation has negative effects on entrepreneurship and business investment, although estimates on the magnitude of these effects differ significantly (for a review of the literature, see Hasset and Hubbard, 2002). Furthermore, higher corporate taxation is associated with a larger informal sector, greater reliance on debt as opposed to equity finance, and lower investment, especially in manufacturing (Djankov et al., 2010). By way of example, Wasem (2018) reports how the introduction of a law in Pakistan that increased taxation for partnerships prompted more companies to report lower earnings, change type of legal entity or simply move into the informal economy. It is not just the tax rate that matters but also the way in which businesses are taxed. In particular, low compliance cost for business, certainty and simplicity of tax rules, and low administration costs for the government all matter in making the tax system friendly to businesses and easy-to-manage for tax authorities. For example, a recent study found that a reduction in the administrative tax burden by 10% leads to a surge in entrepreneurial activity by nearly 4% (Braunerhjelm et al., 2019).\n\nThis paper draws on a review of the literature to examine what role a specific type of small business taxation, i.e. preferential tax regimes (PTRs) for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) , play in encouraging enterprise formalization and enterprise growth . Enterprise formalization is defined here as the process by which an informal (unregistered) enterprise registers in the national business registry and/or submits an annual income tax declaration, which are the two most commonly used definitions in the reviewed literature .\n\nBefore moving forward, it is important to note that taxation is just one of the possible drivers of enterprise formalization and that successful formalization strategies are rather the outcome of both strong business environment conditions and a broad set of institutional policies that include but go beyond taxation. For example, in the context of Latin America, the ILO found that in the period 2002-2012, changes in the economic structure explained 60% of the reduction in informality, while public policies accounted for the remaining 40% (Infante, 2018) . Formalization policies will encompass tax simplification and tax incentives, including through PTRs for MSMEs, but also regulatory reforms, productivity policies (e.g. sector and value chain development, skills upgrading and innovation promotion at the firm level), and improved law enforcement (e.g. labour inspections and culture of compliance). While most empirical studies look at the impact of one single policy on formalization outcomes, something which is reflected in our literature review, better results in terms of formalization can be expected if governments adopt a multipronged strategy that combines different policy approaches together (Chacaltana and Leung, 2020) .\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the paper proceeds as follows. The first part briefly introduces the distinction between incorporated and unincorporated enterprises. The way these two legal entities are taxed is different and affects, among others, the access by MSMEs to PTRs. The second central part of the paper delves into PTRs for MSMEs and discusses their policy rationale, a typology, and evidence about their impact (especially presumptive regimes) on enterprise formalization and enterprise growth. Based on the operational aspects and evidence discussed in this second part, the paper draws the main policy takeaways for policymakers interested in introducing or reforming PTRs for MSMEs as part of their national formalization strategies.\n\nBox 1. ILO Conclusions and Recommandations on MSME taxation, formalization and business growth\n\nEnterprise formalization and enterprise growth are the core of the work and mandate of the International Labour Organization (ILO). The âConclusions concerning the promotion of sustainable enterprisesâ of the 2007 International Labour Conference (ILC) prioritised an enabling legal and regulatory environment and fair competition to promote sustainable enterprises, both of which imply sound tax policies. Beforehand, Recommendation 189 of the 1998 ILC stated that governments should create conditions that provide all enterprises, regardless of their size and legal type, with access to fair taxation.\n\nThe formalization of the economy is one of ILOâs priorities, as stated in Recommendation N. 204 of the 2015 ILC, which reiterates the importance of a conducive business environment and strong MSMEs to reduce the size of the informal economy. In particular, Recommendation N. 204 put forward a formalization policy framework that hinged on three main objectives: a) formal business and employment generation; b) policies to facilitate the transition from the informal to the formal economy, c) policies for preventing the âinformalizationâ of formal jobs.\n\nReasons in favour and against PTRs for MSMEs\n\nAgainst this general backdrop, preferential tax regimes (PTRs) are special fiscal regimes that offer a lower tax rate and simpler tax compliance requirements than the mainstream tax regime to their target group. While there are also other types of PTRs , those aimed at MSMEs are among the most common worldwide. Several reasons explain the large use of this policy.\n\nFirst of all, tax compliance comes with fixed costs, making it proportionally more expensive for MSMEs than for larger companies. Indeed, while total tax compliance costs are higher for larger companies in absolute terms, they are more burdensome for MSMEs when they are measured in relation to sales. A study from South Africa finds, for example, that companies with annual turnover up to ZAR 245,000 pay on average 4.7% of their annual sales to outsource tax payment to professional consultants and 3.1% to do the same with payroll duties. These figures drop to 1.4% and 1.9% for companies with annual turnover between ZAR 245,000 and ZAR 525,000, and become almost insignificant (0.3% and 0.1%) for companies with annual turnover above ZAR 3 million (Smulders et al., 2012). Governments may, therefore, decide to use PTRs for MSMEs to help them deal with higher-than-average tax compliance costs, thus levelling the playing field with larger companies.\n\nSecond, it is also well known that MSMEs find it more difficult than larger companies to receive external finance (Beck et al., 2008). For example, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that 40% of formal MSMEs, corresponding to 65 million firms, have unmet financing needs of 5.2 trillion US dollars every year, which is equivalent to 1.4 times the current level of global MSME lending. Moreover, about half of formal MSMEs do not have access to formal credit, with the financing gap getting even wider if informal enterprises are taken into account . Against this backdrop, preferential taxation reduces the need for MSMEs to obtain external finance by helping them retain a higher proportion of earnings. While addressing an enterprise financing problem through tax policy is not orthodox policy , this approach helps policy makers to mitigate a problem that otherwise requires much longer time to fix.\n\nThird, by the virtue of reducing the tax burden, preferential tax regimes, especially presumptive regimes (see following section), provide an incentive for some self-employed and micro-enterprises to operate in the formal economy. Participation in the formal economy can eventually trigger other productivity-enhancing dynamics, notably through access to larger markets and higher-skilled workers, although this positive cycle should not be taken for granted and is more likely to happen if newly formalized enterprises are also offered other support in the form of managerial training.\n\nFourth, the use of PTRs can simplify tax administration, broaden the tax base (i.e. increase the number of taxpayers) and raise additional tax revenues. In particular, presumptive tax regimes are expected to simplify the relationship between national tax authorities and the host of micro and small enterprises in developing countries, although additional tax revenues collected through these regimes are generally thin .\n\nWhile these are the most common arguments in support of PTRs for MSMEs, these regimes have also faced important criticisms. One of the main allegations is that they cause âthreshold effectsâ (i.e. also known as âbunching effectsâ or âgrowth trapsâ), that is to say, they create a disincentive for enterprises to grow beyond the size threshold after which the tax preference is lost. While this makes sense in principle, whether this really happens is an empirical question that research has tried to answer and that is discussed in greater detail in a following section of this paper.\n\nA second allegation, which is closely related to threshold effects, is that PTRs for MSMEs do not respect the principle of tax equity and may therefore lead to a misallocation of resources in the economy. In particular, companies just below and just above the size threshold may be subject to a very different effective tax rate despite similar levels of income. Similarly, it is also possible that more profitable companies will pay fewer taxes than less profitable companies if the threshold is not based on income but on another variable such as turnover or employment, which is the case with presumptive regimes.\n\nA third criticism goes under the category of frauds; for example, when large companies break into smaller entities to benefit from preferential taxation (i.e. horizontal company break-up) or when employers demand workers to register as self-employed within the framework of a presumptive regime not to pay their social contributions (i.e. disguised employment relationship). On the other side of the tax relationship, corruption among government officers in charge with tax collection is also a risk that would thwart the effectiveness of this policy .\n\nFinally, a less common claim is that PTRs for MSMEs distort occupational choices because more people are pulled into an entrepreneurial career even if they lack the talent and/or resources to grow their business. This thesis resonates with the more general argument that incentives for start-ups are bad public policy because they attract low-skilled people into an entrepreneurial career (Shane, 2009). While it is true that most businesses in presumptive regimes are in low value-adding sectors of the economy (e.g. personal services and retail trade), a full welfare analysis would have to consider the counterfactual situation in the absence of such a policy, which may well be higher unemployment and/or higher informality.\n\nFigure 1. Reasons in favour and against PTRs for MSMEs\n\nThe evidence on the impact of PTRs for MSMEs on enterprise formalization and enterprise growth\n\nBased on a review of the empirical literature, this section of the paper sheds some light on the impact of PTRs for MSMEs on enterprise formalization and enterprise growth. Given the focus on enterprise formalization, this section only takes into consideration the literature on developing and emerging economies, thus excluding studies on high-income economies where informality is less widespread. However, with a view to adding more nuances to the analysis, this section also covers some other size-contingent policies such as certain labour regulations, which de facto act as a payroll tax on business activity and whose impact can therefore be compared to that of other tax policies.\n\nAccording to the IMF, 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and 14 countries in Latin America operated a PTR for MSMEs in 2007 (IMF, 2007), which bears witness to the relevance of this policy in emerging and developing economies. While we do not have more recent statistics on the number of PTRs for MSMEs around the world, it is unlikely that this figure has dropped significantly in the last 10-15 years both because informality is still widespread (Medina and Schneider, 2018) and because these policies can be captured by vested interests once they are established. Given the diffusion of this policy worldwide, it is perhaps surprising that not many of these programmes have been properly assessed, although one possible reason is the lack in developing countries of the extensive firm-level data needed to undertake empirical assessments.\n\nBefore moving forward, it is worth noting that there is a small strand of the literature on presumptive regimes that has not looked at their impact on enterprise formalization and enterprise growth, but only at their capacity to collect additional tax revenues from the informal sector. This literature, which mostly draws on cases from Africa, is less relevant for the key research questions of this paper and is briefly summarised in Box 6.\n\nBox 6. The experience of Sub-Saharan Africa with presumptive regimes\n\nPresumptive tax regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa have mostly been used to collect some tax revenues from large domestic informal sectors, but they have not necessarily aimed to formalise the operations of the targeted companies, for example through the means of registration in a business registry. Therefore, also due to lack of firm-level data, the literature on these regimes has not involved empirical analyses to establish impacts on enterprise formalization or enterprise growth, but has rather looked at issues such as success in tax collection.\n\nTanzania\n\nIn 2004, the government introduced a turnover-based presumptive regime for enterprises earning less than TZS 20 million (about USD 20,000 at the time of the reform). Companies without accounting books were asked to pay a lump sum (patent), while companies with books were asked to pay a tax proportional to the turnover plus a lump sum. Four income brackets were established within the TZS 20 million threshold, subject to different rates and lump sums. Semboja (2015) reported an increase in the number of taxpayers registered with this regime from 322,000 in 2008 to 498,000 in 2012, although their relative proportion in the total number of taxpayers decreased from 66% to 42%. While this policy stirred the interest and participation of informal micro-entrepreneurs, it did not generate much additional tax revenues (i.e. less than 1% of the total). Most of these additional revenues came from informal companies keeping basic books, rather than from informal companies without books.\n\nZambia\n\nIn Zambia, the two main forms of presumptive taxation are a turnover-based tax levied at 3% on individuals and small firms with annual turnover up to ZMW 200 million (USD 50,000) and a withholding tax collected from cross-border traders at 6% of the value of imports exceeding USD 500. These two regimes have reportedly succeeded in increasing tax revenues from the informal sector, from ZMW 5.4 billion (USD 1.35 million) in 2004 to ZMW 90.9 billion (USD 22.7 million) in 2009. As a share of total tax revenues, the informal sectorâs contribution rose from 0.3% in 2004 to 1.8% in 2009 (Dube and Casale, 2016).\n\nGhana\n\nIn some cases, presumptive tax regimes have targeted specific professional categories. In Ghana, for example, the vehicle income tax is a lump-sum tax that applies to informal taxi drivers and that is proportional to the type and size of the vehicle (between USD 3 and USD 60 quarterly). In 2010, the compliance rate was estimated at 85.5%, making this policy quite successful (Dube and Casale, 2016).\n\nSource: Based on Semboja, H. (2015), âPresumptive tax system and its influence on the ways informal entrepreneurs behave In Tanzaniaâ, Tanzanian Economic Review, 5(1-2): 72â90. Dube, G. and D. Casale (2016), âThe implementation of informal sector taxation: evidence from selected African countriesâ, eJournal of Tax Research, 14(3): 601â623\n\nBased on these restrictions, we focus our literature review on a relatively small number of empirical papers (11) that specifically look at the impact of PTRs for MSMES on enterprise formalization and enterprise growth, including the eventual existence of threshold effects, in emerging economies. The main findings from each of these papers, all of them investigating presumptive regimes, are summarised in the Annex Table.\n\nThis shows clearly that most papers have looked at cases from Latin America, suggesting that it is mostly in this Continent that presumptive regimes have been used to foster enterprise formalization (see also Table 1 for an overview of presumptive regimes in Latin America). However, it is also possible that better data availability has made it possible more quality research in this region than in others where presumptive regimes are also common (e.g. Southeast Asia). In particular, Brazil stands out because it operates two large schemes: Simples Nacional for small companies with annual turnover below BRL 4.8 million and MEI (Individual Micro-entrepreneur) for self-employed people earning less than BRL 81,000 per year. The rest of this section organises evidence under two headings: âpresumptive regimes and enterprise formalizationâ and âpresumptive regimes and enterprise growthâ.\n\nTable 1. Selection of presumptive tax regimes from Latin America\n\nSource: Based on CetrÃ¡ngolo O. et al. (2018), âRegimenes Tributarios Simplificadosâ, in J. C. Salazar-Xirinachs & J. Chacaltana (eds.), PolÃ­ticas de FormalizaciÃ³n en AmÃ©rica Latina: Avances y DesafÃ­os, ILO Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nPresumptive regimes and enterprise formalization\n\nWith respect to enterprise formalization, the main message from the reviewed cases is that presumptive regimes encourage enterprise formalization, which is generally defined in the literature as the registration and/or tax payment of previously unregistered companies. However, this impact is often short-lived, in the sense that the increased number of enterprise registrations or business tax payments stabilises after a relatively short period of time from the introduction of the policy . This suggests that presumptive regimes may convince those informal entrepreneurs whose business practices are not too distant from the formal economy to register, but that this incentive alone is not enough to formalize a much larger number of less productive companies . This is consistent with the point stressed earlier that major advances in formalization are rather the outcome of structural changes in the economy and a broader set of institutional policies that include but go beyond taxation (Chacaltana and Leung, 2020; Infante, 2018). In addition, the reviewed presumptive regimes show sustained rates of participation over time, suggesting that self-employed and micro-entrepreneurs appreciate the low tax compliance costs and flexibility of this policy and that, if these regimes were not there, formal business creation would probably be lower. In particular, the experiences of Brazil (two presumptive regimes), Mexico and Argentina all point to sustained use of presumptive regimes over time, while the case of Georgia is a partial exception to this trend.\n\nTurning to some of the specific findings from the literature review, Rocha et al. (2018) find that Brazilâs individual micro-entrepreneur regime (MEI, profiled in Box 3) led to formalization effects in eligible sectors in the range of 4.3%, that is to say, eligible sectors experienced an increase of 4.3% in the number of registered firms, but this only after a programme reform in April 2011 reduced social security contributions from 11% to 5% of the minimum wage . Only then did MEI become really advantageous for most micro-entrepreneurs (those above the 25th percentile in the earnings distribution), who saw their tax liability halved compared to what they would have had to pay under Simples Nacional (flat tax rate of 4%), the more senior presumptive regime . The empirical analysis from this paper also shows that the rise in formal enterprise registrations was confined to the first 6 months after the programme change and stemmed from the formalization of existing informal businesses, rather than from the creation of new firms or greater survival of existing formal businesses . On the downside, based on this analysis, MEI did not show a major impact either on the aggregate proportion of formal/informal workers or on the unemployment rate. One note of caution about this study concerns the short period of observation, since data were collected only up to August 2012, thus limiting the analysis only to 16 months after the reduction of social contributions was introduced. Descriptive data from the Brazilian small business agency (SEBRAE) also point to a steady interest towards this policy, which counted 11.3 million active businesses at the end of 2020, about twice as many as in 2005 (5.5 million) .\n\nAzuara et al. (2019) confirm the positive results of MEI, including in terms of access to social protection. The authors estimate that, between 2009 and 2014, MEI attracted slightly over 1 million informal entrepreneurs into the formal sector in the 12 major urban areas of Brazil. However, this paper also shows that 40% of MEI were no longer enrolled in the regime 4 years after the initial registration. Based on data from the Social Security Institute on year-to-year transitions between social security regimes and the informal sector, the authors conclude that most of this 40% had moved back into the informal sector.\n\nIn addition to MEI, Brazil also operates another (larger) presumptive regime, called Simples Nacional, which has been in place since 1996. The programme applies to companies in eligible sectors (i.e. those that do not require the employment of professionals from regulated professions) whose annual turnover does not exceed BRL 4.8 million (as of end 2020). Simples Nacional consolidates several federal taxes and social security contributions into one single monthly payment, which corresponds to 3-5% of gross revenues for micro-enterprises and 5.4-7% for small enterprises. Findings on the formalization effects of Simples Nacional are mixed, although they appear to be on the whole moderately positive. Fajnzylber et al. (2011) find that Simples Nacional led to an increase in many dimensions of formality in the eligible sectors that did not occur in ineligible sectors (i.e. the control group). The largest âformalization effectâ was in enterprise licensing, which in eligible sectors increased by 50% in the 3 months following the introduction of this policy compared to the 3 months before. An increase of 30% was found with respect to tax payments, while a smaller increase was detected in the proportion of workers covered by social protection. Formalization effects were stronger for companies with employees and tended to increase with enterprise age. Similarly to MEI, however, these effects were not long-lasting. The authors find that the numbers of business licenses, tax registrations, tax payments, and social security contributions stabilised after the initial period .\n\nSimples Nacional is the most researched presumptive regime in emerging economies. Two other empirical studies on the same policy find partially different results. Monteiro and AssunÃ§Ã£o (2012) find that Simples Nacional led to an increase in licensing â the test for formalization in this paper â only in the retail sector (by a sizeable 13 percentage points). However, the impact was negligible in other eligible sectors, including construction, manufacturing and transportation. As to the second study, Piza (2018) finds no formalization effects at all, regardless of the sector, and argues that stronger effects in the other two studies were the result of seasonal shocks in the sectors covered by Simples Nacional. While it goes beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the different empirical strategies adopted in these three papers , the five most common sectors within Simples Nacional, as reported in Fajnzylber et al. (2011), were retail trade (26%), personal services (20%), construction (15%), technical and professional services (11%) and manufacturing (11%). Out of the five, only construction can partly be considered a seasonal industry, which raises some doubts on the conclusions of Piza (2018).\n\nTurning to Mexico, the federal government introduced in 2014 a new presumptive regime called RÃ©gimen de IncorporaciÃ³n Fiscal (RIF, profiled in Box 4) whose aim was the formalization of small businesses and which replaced two previous distinct regimes: REPECOS (i.e. small taxpayerâs regime) and Intermedio (i.e. intermediate taxpayerâs regime). Because RIF has been introduced relatively recently and its full benefits spread over 10 years, there has not yet been a formal impact evaluation of this policy. However, descriptive statistics reported in Azuara et al. (2019) show that by the end of 2017 RIF had already attracted more participants than REPECOS: in three years, more than 4.5 million business owners had enrolled in the RIF regime, although this figure might decline or stabilise when fiscal benefits become less generous as companies spend more years in the programme . In the same period (2014-2017), the number of companies paying social contributions for their workers had moved from about 540,000 to 620,000, which was however not enough to change the overall proportion of wage workers covered by the pension system. The number of self-employed people paying their own social contributions also grew, from about 20,000 before RIF to nearly 27,000 at the end of 2017, which in this case also entailed a drop in the rate of self-employed people uncovered by social security from 80.5% to 78%.\n\nStill in Latin America, Argentinaâs Monotributo (Single Tax) bundles together income tax, VAT and social security contributions in one single monthly payment, with the amount of this payment that changes according to annual revenues, size of the shop floor and electricity consumption (employment is not a criterion). The policy includes 8 income brackets, from up to ARS 84,000 to more than ARS 502,000. The ILO finds that, between 1998 and 2018, Argentinaâs Monotributo experienced a continuous growth in membership, from 640,00O business owners in the first years to 3.45 million in 2018, 65% of whom were in the services sector, 15.5% in retail trade and 19.5% in the so-called Monotributo Social, a âspecial regime within the special regimeâ reserved for very low-income households (Cetrangolo et al., 2018) . The policy has, therefore, generated a vast process of business registration; almost half (47%) are in the lowest income bracket (less than ARS 84,000) and, as noted before, about 20% operate within Monotributo Social (Cetrangolo et al., 2018). On the downside, Monotributoâs tax revenues only amounted to 1-1.2% of total tax revenues in the period 2011-2017, although it is not clear to what extent this is due to the low tax liability of this policy, the low tax revenues of Monotributoâs taxpayers or still noncompliance with tax obligations. In this respect, a previous analysis by the ILO shows that between 2009 and 2013, depending on the year, 80-90% of people enrolled in Monotributo were paying taxes and 50-60% were paying social contributions, which are considered good results overall (Cetrangolo et al., 2013).\n\nOne last case from our literature review comes from Georgia which, in 2010, introduced a turnover-based presumptive regime by which sole proprietors earning less than GEL 30,000 were income-tax exempt (micro-enterprises), while small companies with annual turnover between GEL 30,000-100,000 were taxed at 5% of their annual turnover (3% in case of sufficient documented expenditures). Bruhn and Loeprick (2016), using data from the Georgian Tax Authority, find that 10.8% of Georgian registered companies had opted for the micro-enterprise regime and 23.3% for the small-enterprise regime in 2012. Altogether, the new presumptive regime therefore attracted about 34% of the total stock of formal companies. Based on their empirical models (see Annex Table), the authors also estimate that the presumptive regime led to an increase of 27-41% in the number of newly registered firms below the eligibility threshold of GEL 30,000. However, this increase was limited to the year following the introduction of this policy (2011) â it was not observed in 2012 â and did not concern the other small business tax regime (GEL 30,000-100,000). The authors deduct that this increase was the result of enterprise formalization rather than new enterprise creation, as they assume that the growth in enterprise registrations should have otherwise been more sustained over time . While two years (2011-2012) are probably too short to draw final conclusions on the impact of this policy on enterprise formalization, findings are broadly in line with those from Brazil (see above), where researchers had also shown that the growth in new enterprise registrations stabilised after the initial post-reform period.\n\nPresumptive regimes and enterprise growth\n\nThe second question of our literature review is whether presumptive regimes favour small business growth (in terms of turnover, profits or employment) and, linked to this, whether they cause âgrowth trapsâ or âthreshold effectsâ, which occur when small business owners intentionally avoid growing beyond the legal threshold of the presumptive regime not to lose its tax advantage. The first main conclusion is that there are frequent examples of enterprise growth within the context of the reviewed presumptive regimes, especially in terms of turnover/profits (rather than employment), but that this growth typically happens within the size limits of the presumptive regime. In other words, few micro and small business owners mature from the presumptive regimes into the national mainstream tax regimes. However, per se, this is not a sign of threshold effects, since business owners may not grow simply because of structural limits to their business model or low managerial skills. In the empirical literature, threshold effects are rather observed when there is a break in the statistical power relation between the two variables of âfirm sizeâ (in terms of employment) and ânumber of companies in each firm size bandâ, i.e. when there is a gap or a break in the otherwise linear (inverse) relationship between these two variables . In this respect, based on the limited number of policies observed â 9 in total, some of which analysed by more than one paper â we can tentatively conclude that there is not strong evidence of threshold effects in the case of presumptive regimes, although these effects appear to be slightly more pronounced in the case of senior presumptive regimes (i.e. those with higher turnover thresholds), mostly because of an average larger difference in the effective tax rate between these regimes and the mainstream tax regime. On the other hand, there is stronger evidence of threshold effects in the case of size-contingent labour regulations, although in this case our literature review is really small and only limited to three cases, two from India and one from Peru . One possible reason is that moving back and forth a turnover size limit is probably less costly than doing the same with an employment size limit, since the latter implies hiring-and-firing administrative costs that do not incur in the first case.\n\nFigure 2. A visualisation of treshold effects in India and Peru (size-contingent labour regulations)\n\nNote: Both graphs are in logarithmic scale and have firm size (employment based) on the horizontal axis and number (or proportion) of companies in the vertical axis.\n\nSource: Amirapu and Getcher (2020) & Dabla Norris et al. (2018)\n\nTurning to some of the details of the reviewed literature, Fajnzylber et al. (2011), in their analysis of Brazilâs Simples Nacional, find that formalization led to better performance for newly-licensed companies both in terms of revenues and profits (compared to non-licensed firms); this was especially true for companies with employees. The main reason was not so much better access to finance or larger markets, as the possibility to have a permanent point of sale and to contract formal (higher-skilled) labour. Azuara et al. (2019), looking at the period 2002-2012, find that companies in Simples Nacional grew in terms of employment at a faster rate than companies outside Simples Nacional, although they never reached the average size of companies outside Simples and although faster growth rates were probably also the result of their smaller size . However, expectedly, companies that moved from Simples Nacional into the mainstream regime grew faster than companies that never left it . Azuara et al. (2019) also find that business entry rates are higher and business exit rates are lower in Simples Nacional than in the mainstream tax regime, which leads to higher survival rates in the presumptive regime. Finally, between 50,000 and 70,000 micro-entrepreneurs move every year from the junior presumptive regime MEI (max turnover BRL 81,000 per year) into Simples Nacional (max turnover BRL 4.8 million), which also points to a process of enterprise growth favoured by lower tax and regulatory compliance requirements (SEBRAE, 2016).\n\nThe experience of Monotributo in Argentina also points to signs of enterprise growth within this special tax regime. Cetrangolo et al. (2013) find that, on an annual basis, 80% of movements between the different income brackets of this regime were upward and only 20% were downward although, contrary to the case of Brazil, there were almost no cases of enterprises that matured from Monotributo into the general tax regime. The same paper also finds that there have been very few cases of companies that have moved from the mainstream tax regime into Monotributo, which suggests that there have not been major competition effects between these two fiscal regimes.\n\nRelated to the relationship between presumptive regimes and enterprise growth is the link between presumptive regimes and âthreshold effectsâ, which occur when companies intentionally avoid growing not to lose the fiscal advantage of the special tax regime. As noted earlier in the paper, this is one of the most common allegations leveraged at presumptive regimes.\n\nAmong the reviewed cases, Hsieh and Olken (2014) look at two examples of preferential tax regimes (Mexico and Indonesia) and one example of size-contingent labour regulations (India, see below). In the case of Mexico, the authors do not observe threshold effects for REPECOS, the preferential regime that preceded RIF until 2014. In other words, there were no signs of a break in the enterprise size distribution at the turnover cut-off of this policy (MXN 2 million), in spite of the strong difference in the effective tax rate before and after the threshold. By the same token, the authors do not find signs of threshold effects in the case of Indonesiaâs value-added tax (VAT), which does not apply to companies earning less than IDR 600 million per year. In this case, too, there was no break in the enterprise size distribution around IDR 600 million.\n\nAzuara et al. (2019) look in detail at three examples of size-based legislations from Peru: two presumptive tax regimes and a profit-sharing rule that applies to companies with 20 workers or more . In the case of the two presumptive regimes, the authors find significant threshold effects for the more senior presumptive regime â RER (Special Income Tax Regime) â which applies to companies earning less than PEN 525,000 per year and employing less than 10 workers. In this case, in fact, the âfiscal cliffâ with the mainstream tax regime is particularly steep, since companies exceeding the turnover limit move from being taxed 1.5% of their annual revenues to being taxed 28% of their annual net income. On the other hand, the authors do not find threshold effects for any of the monthly fee segments within the junior presumptive regime (NRUS, New Unified Simplified Regime), nor at the turnover threshold between NRUS and RER. This last point suggests that there are not competition effects between these two presumptive regimes.\n\nFinally, the case of Georgia (Bruhn and Loeprick, 2016) points to mixed threshold effects at the two turnover size limits of GEL 30,000 (micro-enterprise tax regime) and GEL 100,000 (small business tax regime). In 2010, the first year when the new presumptive regime was enforced, there was an increase of companies by the GEL 30,000 turnover cut-off compared to the previous year, from 4,082 to 4,762, which the authors interpret as a sign of underreported revenues. However, the authors do not find signs of underreporting in the following two years, 2011 and 2012. On the other hand, larger and more persistent threshold effects were found for the higher turnover cut-off of GEL 100,000. In this case, the leap between 2009 and 2010 in the number of companies at the turnover threshold was from 7,831 to 12,043 firms, with underreporting persisting in 2011 and then decreasing only slightly in 2012. The authors argue that the stronger threshold effects at the GEL 100,000 limit are the result of a steeper increase in the effective tax rate when business owners move from the small business tax regime into the mainstream tax regime than when they move from the micro-enterprise tax regime into the small business tax regime. This makes the case of Georgia similar to Peruâs, where threshold effects were found for the senior presumptive regime (RER) but not for the junior one (NRUS).\n\nEvidence on threshold effects for size-contingent labour regulations is also mixed. Hsieh and Olken (2014) and Amirapu and Getcher (2020) both look at the case of India, where costly labour regulations kick in at the thresholds of 10 and 100 employees. When Indian companies hire 10 employees (or more), they need to comply with a suite of labour regulations affecting workplace safety, insurance and social security taxes, and severance payment. At 100 or more employees, Indian companies need a government permission to dismiss workers or to shut down operations (i.e. Industrial Disputes Act). Both papers find no major evidence of threshold effects at the cut-off of 100 workers, although the cost of asking a government permission to downsize is probably relevant, if anything in terms of negotiation costs. On the other hand, Amirapu and Getcher (2020) find evidence of threshold effects around the 10-worker cut-off (see also Figure 2), which clearly affects a larger number of companies and may also influence the decision to run a business in the formal or informal economy. The authors estimate that this is due to a steep increase of 35% in the unit labour cost once the size limit is overcome .\n\nRelevant threshold effects are also found for another size-contingent labour regulation that applies to Peruvian companies that employ more than 20 workers, where employers need to share part of their profits with their workers. Dabla Norris et al. (2018), based on data from both the national economic census and the national tax authority, find evidence of threshold effects (see also Figure 2). Moreover, they also find that the use of non-salaried workers increase rapidly as companies approach the size of 20 salaried workers, which the authors take as a sign of recourse to informal or semi-formal labour (e.g. consultants and service provision contracts) among companies around the 20-employee limit. In this respect, the authors also find threshold effects with respect to âsales per workerâ and âprofits per workerâ, with the value of both variables dropping at the 20-employee cut-off. This may suggest underreporting of sales and profits â to avoid sharing a bigger slice of profits with workers â but also lower average productivity due to the contracting of a larger proportion of non-salaried workers . Concerning this profit-sharing rule in Peru, Azuara et al. (2019) find identical results to Dabla Norris et al. (2018).
