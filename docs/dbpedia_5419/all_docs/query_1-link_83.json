        "text": "Just don't ask for French fries. Eons ago, hosting the Olympics came with prestige and bragging rights. Over the past 50 years, however, hosting the games has been a money-losing proposition for host countries and cities, leaving them with large debts and maintenance liabilities. And that's also true for companies hoping to cash in on them. Delta is on the hook for more than $100 million in losses, and some travel companies are scrambling to break even by offering discounts and incentives to travelers. Flight bookings may be up 10%, but compared to the 115% increase for the 2016 Rio Games, that's not a lot of escargot. The big reason - travelers don't have much love for the City of Love because they want to avoid crowded streets, packed roads and even the political turmoil no less. Instead, many are choosing to visit other European countries or pushing travel until after the Olympics. All of this is turning into a money pit for travel companies, hotels, and the overall hospitality business. For travelers who aren't concerned about the Olympic atmosphere, that could mean scoring super low mileage fares and deeply discounted hotel rates. Hotels are already facing a 25% decline in revenue, which makes balancing discounts as delicate as baking a decent croissant. In addition, tourists willing to make the trip may even be able to score tickets to Olympic events themselves, which have the lowest bookings in 25 years for almost any sports event. Tourists willing to endure and overlook the issues that are keeping many away from Paris may actually find themselves with a unique and affordable experience https://lnkd.in/gE7Vp8v7 #travel #paris #olympics #airlines #airtravel #tourism #hospitalityindustry #hotels #restaurants\n\nEvents in Peru are far more accessible than many North American planners may believe. Direct flights to Lima are available from several major North American airports, including Miami, New York, Newark, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston, and Fort Lauderdale. Airlines such as LATAM Airlines, American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and JetBlue offer daily direct services from the U.S. to Lima. Upon arrival, MICE groups will find that traveling between Peruâ€™s MICE cities can be straightforward and seamless via planes, trains, and buses. Peruvian MICE cities are easy for attendees to navigate due to their compact nature, providing everything needed within their borders.

Planning a trip to France can be an exciting experience. To help you with your trip, I'll provide you with some general information and tips: Destinations: Paris: The capital city is famous for iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. Provence: Known for its lavender fields, charming villages, and beautiful landscapes. French Riviera: Enjoy the Mediterranean coastline in cities like Nice, Cannes, and Saint-Tropez. Loire Valley: Explore castles and vineyards in this picturesque region. Normandy: Visit historic sites, including the D-Day landing beaches and Mont Saint-Michel. Transportation: Consider the efficient and extensive train system (TGV) for inter-city travel. Public transportation in major cities is well-developed, and taxis and rideshare services are also available. Language: While many people in tourist areas speak English, it's helpful to learn a few basic French phrases to enhance your experience. Currency: The currency is the Euro (â‚¬). Credit cards are widely accepted, but it's advisable to have some cash, especially in smaller towns. Weather: France experiences a variety of climates. Check the weather for the specific regions you plan to visit and pack accordingly. Cuisine: French cuisine is world-renowned. Don't miss trying local specialties like baguettes, cheese, wine, escargot, and pastries. Cultural Etiquette: It's customary to greet people with a \"Bonjour\" (good morning) or \"Bonsoir\" (good evening). Tipping is generally included in the bill at restaurants, but it's common to leave small change. Attractions and Events: Check for any special events, festivals, or exhibitions happening during your visit. Consider purchasing tickets in advance for popular attractions to avoid long lines. #francetourisme #francevisa #francesareversa #francevisaservices #francevisainformation #francevisanearby #francevisaagent #francevisaagency #francevisaagentnearme"
