        "text": "By Manuel Azuara, Principal, Bridgepoint Consulting\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal article called “Tech Teams Rush to Catch Up as New Accounting Rule Looms,” cited the increasing challenges that finance and technology teams at some of the largest companies in the nation are facing with ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard. The article also points to results from a recent survey conducted by Ernst & Young LLP, which unveiled some interesting findings:\n\n“Almost a third of 300 finance and technology executives who were surveyed are at risk of lagging behind in their rush to comply with the new revenue recognition rules.”\n\n“More than a fifth of these executives were concerned that their finance and tech upgrades wouldn’t be complete by the end of the year, leaving only a partially functioning system in place, requiring manual workarounds.”\n\nThis is no surprise to us here at Bridgepoint, as we have been keeping a close eye on the developments around the new rev rec standard. In fact, we know firsthand that the complexity involved in implementing this standard is unprecedented for some industries and will test the efficiency, capacity and resources of companies.\n\nHERE ARE 3 KEY THINGS THAT STAND OUT TO ME:\n\n1. Whether public or private, companies are finally realizing assessing and implementing ASC 606 is a much larger undertaking than expected.\n\n• In fact, the new standard will require entities to disclose much more information about revenue activities and related transactions than they do currently. Consequently, they will need time to implement and test appropriate processes, internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures (including the identification of relevant personnel and information systems throughout the organization).\n\n2. Even if you believe these new rules will have no material impact on your organization, it will take your team a tremendous amount of time and internal resources to document and support that conclusion.\n\n• When implementing the new rev rec standard, some companies will need to make wholesale changes to their accounting policies due to the new recognition and measurement requirements. For other companies, the impact of those requirements will be less significant. However, all entities will need to carefully consider the standard’s new and modified quantitative and qualitative disclosure requirements.\n\n3. Companies with the best technology systems in place are still facing huge challenges and finding these changes taxing.\n\n• Think new technology will make this process easy? Think again. Even the newest technology systems must be modified to accommodate the new revenue recognition standard – and the reality is that you can’t change your systems, processes and controls overnight.\n\nSO, WHAT CAN COMPANIES DO TO GET AHEAD OF THE GAME?\n\nIn our experience, there are several steps that you can take to successfully navigate every twist and turn of the new rev rec standard:\n\n1. Start now!\n\n2018 will be here before you know it. Why not take advantage of summertime to get the ball rolling with assessing the potential impact of ASC 606 on your organization? Summer is generally a slower time for the business and luckily falls between after year-end and before annual budget cycles. A great place to start is with this 5-step assessment process.\n\n2. Put a strong project plan and process in place\n\nThese changes are very complex and could impact multiple aspects of how you run your business. Therefore, it’s critical that you develop a project plan with a designated project owner from day one and involve key departments in the process early and often.\n\n3. Don’t underestimate the impact on your organization\n\nUnder the new standard, organizations across many industries will need to carefully consider existing contracts, business models, company practices and accounting policies. In some cases, this could mean restating financial information going back two years and performing multiple years of audits. And remember, even if you believe there is no material impact to your organization, you will still have to dedicate a significant amount of time and resources to document and support those findings.\n\n4. Engage a trusted partner early on, so you can stay focused on your business\n\nOne of our biggest concerns is that companies are waiting too long to act, and there won’t be enough outside resources available to help them meet the looming deadline. If you need guidance around the financial and operational process, or help navigating your implementation from start to finish, leverage the right outside resources from the onset. This will help put your company on the right track—without wasting your valuable internal resources.\n\nBRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER\n\nMany businesses are slow-walking to implementing the revenue recognition standard, even as the effective date approaches next year. Don’t be one of them – act now! Remember, falling behind on the new rec rev standard is a perfect storm that will also lead you to fall behind with implementing the new lease accounting standards.\n\nIf you have questions about revenue recognition, I’m happy to chat.
