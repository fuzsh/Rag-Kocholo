        "text": "We help municipalities to manage their energy efficiently and economically.\n\nDiagnosis to improve the contract with the electricity supplier: get the cheapest energy and adapt it to sustainability requirements (Guarantee of Renewable Origin).\n\nEvaluation of the contracted power, in order to adapt it to the existing energy supplies and not to overpay.\n\nReactive power compensation: If reactive power overcharges are detected in electricity bills, it is necessary to check why they occur and compensate for them by installing condensing coils.\n\nDiagnosis for the incorporation of renewable energy: generate your own clean energy to save on electricity bills or diesel consumption and be more sustainable. Always according to the particularities of each client: available space, power required, with or without connection to the grid…\n\nCollective self-consumption is a type of self-consumption in which several consumers are allowed to be associated to the same generation facility or facilities. This means that several consumers can enjoy the photovoltaic energy produced in an installation that does not necessarily have to be on their own roof or land.\n\nThis has economic advantages, as less investment is required per consumer, which is amortised more quickly than in individual self-consumption.\n\nIn the case of municipalities, collective self-consumption is useful for municipal buildings to benefit from the production and use of their own energy. The photovoltaic installation can be placed in the most suitable available space (e.g. on top of the sports hall, on the roof of the schools…) and, depending on the installed power, municipal buildings within a 2 km radius can be part of the collective self-consumption, obtaining savings on their electricity bill.\n\nTo do this, it is necessary to carry out a study of the electricity contracts which are property of the City Council to determine the most suitable photovoltaic power and the savings that can be achieved on the electricity bills of:\n\nmunicipal buildings\n\nthe sports hall\n\nthe electricity contract for the municipality festivities\n\nthe swimming pools\n\nthe town lightings\n\nwater pumping\n\n…\n\nA renewable energy community is defined as “a legal entity based on open and voluntary participation, effectively controlled by partners or members who are natural persons, SMEs or local entities, which develops renewable energy, energy efficiency and/or sustainable mobility projects that are owned by that legal entity and whose primary purpose is to provide environmental, economic or social benefits to its partners or members or to the local areas where they operate, rather than financial gain”.\n\nIn other words, it is an initiative in which the partners agree to carry out various actions ranging from producing and sharing renewable energy in a photovoltaic installation to promoting the use of a fleet of electric bicycles.\n\nEnergy communities have certain legal advantages that make it easier for them to carry out this type of project, but it must be borne in mind that they must be constituted as a legal entity. The community must prepare a Work Plan that includes its operational plan.\n\nThere are different types of energy communities, depending on how they want to be managed. An example of a community is that formed by the neighbours of a municipality, who decide to set themselves up as such and produce their own renewable energy, no longer depending on the electricity supplier to do so.\n\nSome advantages of energy communities are:\n\nSavings on electricity bills\n\nCombating energy poverty\n\nStop relying on electricity companies\n\nEmpowering neighbours and municipalities\n\nEnvironmental benefits"
