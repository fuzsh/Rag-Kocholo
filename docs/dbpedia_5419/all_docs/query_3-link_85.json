        "text": "By Ian James, Staff Writer, LA Times\n\nSevere drought last year caused the California agriculture industry to shrink by 8,745 jobs and shoulder $1.2 billion in direct costs as water cutbacks forced growers to fallow farmland and pump more groundwater from wells, according to new research.\n\nIn a report prepared for the California Department of Food and Agriculture, researchers calculated that reduced water deliveries resulted in 395,000 acres of cropland left dry and unplanted — an area larger than Los Angeles. In estimating the costs, they factored in losses in crop revenue and higher costs for pumping more groundwater.\n\nCalifornia’s agriculture industry is the largest in the country, averaging $50 billion in annual revenue and employing more than 400,000 people. The researchers’ analysis shows that the past year of drought had significant economic impacts, and these costs are likely to accumulate as climate change intensifies drought, and as California implements regulations to curb the chronic overpumping of groundwater.\n\nThe report, part of a larger three-year study, did not examine how the elimination of some full-time and part-time jobs are playing out for farmworkers. The authors said some workers have turned to taking other jobs, driving longer distances or moving.\n\n“These farmworkers belong to the lowest-income group in the state, particularly in the Central Valley,” said Josué Medellín-Azuara, a water resources economist and associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at UC Merced. “So when climate hits, these communities are hit harder.”\n\nMedellín-Azuara and colleagues from UC Merced, UC Davis and the Public Policy Institute of California estimated changes in the acreage of irrigated farmlands last year as compared to 2018. They surveyed irrigation districts, analyzed water data and reviewed satellite data to track changes in croplands.\n\nIn addition to considering the direct effects on farming businesses, the researchers estimated the “spillover effects” in the broader economy and found that analysis pushed the total impacts to more than 14,600 lost jobs, both full-time and part-time, and $1.7 billion in gross revenue losses.\n\nThe state is now entering a third year of drought. Many reservoirs remain at low levels and the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada stands at 67% of average for this time of year. Federal water managers announced this week that many farmers should prepare to receive no water from the Central Valley Project.\n\nIf the state doesn’t get more precipitation in March, Medellín-Azuara said, “we are likely to see more severe cutbacks from water agencies to agriculture this year, and then the impacts can intensify.”\n\nThe past year was one of the driest and hottest on record in California, and comes during a larger 22-year megadrought in the West that research shows is being worsened by global warming.\n\nThe researchers found the economic effects on California agriculture last year were comparable to the impacts in 2014, in the middle of the last major drought, which ended in 2016.\n\nBut they also found that this time the drought has been more severe in the Sacramento Valley and North Coast regions, leading to an increase in dry farmlands and revenue losses in those areas.\n\nFor example, the Russian River Basin has suffered from drier conditions over the past year, Medellín-Azuara said, “so the map of the dry areas changed a little bit.”\n\nHis team found that the croplands left fallow included rice fields in the Sacramento Valley, cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley, as well as farmlands that had been producing grains and other field crops.\n\nThese shifts are occurring alongside other long-term changes in crops driven by the global market and other factors. Over the past decade, the acreage planted with wheat, cotton and alfalfa has decreased, while new orchards with high-value pistachios and almonds have expanded across vast stretches of farmland.\n\nThe report’s authors cited statistics showing milk remained the state’s top agricultural commodity in 2020, followed by almonds and grapes.\n\nThe research shows a substantial economic toll on agriculture, especially in the Central Valley, where the economy depends heavily on farming, said Alvar Escriva-Bou, a coauthor and senior research fellow with the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\n“It’s a lot of money, a lot of jobs,” Escriva-Bou said.\n\nThe study focused on revenue losses and pumping costs but didn’t estimate profits in the agriculture industry.\n\nFarming operations in the Central Valley have long turned to pumping more groundwater during droughts, and water levels have been dropping for decades. State lawmakers in 2014 passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, which established a framework for managing groundwater and required local agencies to develop plans to eliminate problems of chronic overpumping.\n\nLocal groundwater agencies have been developing plans to begin implementing the law between now and 2040, with state officials overseeing the process and reviewing plans.\n\nIn the meantime, declining water levels in farming areas have continued to leave more rural homeowners, including many farmworkers, struggling with dry wells. The state received reports of 975 household wells that ran dry in 2021, many in farming areas in the Central Valley.\n\nThe law is expected to gradually bring limits on groundwater pumping that will reduce the strains on depleted aquifers, and these limits will eventually force growers to leave dry a portion of the farmland in the San Joaquin Valley.\n\nEscriva-Bou and other researchers have estimated that at least 500,000 acres of farmland will probably have to stop being irrigated by 2040 to meet groundwater sustainability goals.\n\nHe and colleague Ellen Hanak have presented a list of proposals for improving implementation of the groundwater law. Their recommendations include accelerating “demand management,” or limits on pumping, while also planning how to convert some farmlands to other uses, such as solar farms and habitat restoration areas — a direction state officials have supported by budgeting $50 million for a land “repurposing” program.\n\nSteps to reduce groundwater pumping should speed up in areas where water levels are falling, Escriva-Bou said.\n\n“We need to accelerate that to be more resilient. Because if not, we are more vulnerable to droughts like this one,” Escriva-Bou said. At the same time, he said, “we have to think about alternative means of income for farmers and for communities.”\n\nAccording to state data, agriculture uses nearly 80% of the water that is diverted and pumped for human use in an average year in California.\n\nMedellín-Azuara and other researchers have written that they expect California agriculture will continue to use less water in the long term because of the groundwater law and other factors including expanding development. They’ve also said they expect the state’s agriculture industry will continue to make efficiency improvements and benefit from growing demand for its specialty crops.\n\n“Agriculture in California is very resilient and innovative,” Medellín-Azuara said. “Overall, we are weathering the drought and adapting to future droughts as well.”\n\nOpinion by John Kabateck – California state director, National Federation of Independent Business\n\nIn the entrepreneurial world, California is a hub of innovation. The state is home to roughly four million small businesses which employ more than seven million workers.\n\nOut of the Golden State, franchise businesses from Meineke Car Centers to Kiddie Academy have been conceived and grown into prosperous companies employing thousands and helping countless entrepreneurs achieve success. Not the least of these entrepreneurs are those who serve local communities up and down the state in the franchise restaurant community.\n\nToday, these independent franchise restaurant businesses are under attack. A revived bill, AB 257 (Holden) otherwise known as the Fast Recovery Act, seeks to diminish the role of these small business operators to state-managed functionaries.\n\nThe bill will impact the ability of operators and managers to run the business.\n\nWhile the bill has many flaws, its impact on individuals who strive to run their own business as a franchisee is especially egregious. The Fast Recovery Act needs to be rejected by the California State Senate. Here are five key reasons:\n\nFirst, the bill will impact the ability for operators and managers to work with employees. In the franchise model, it is imperative the franchise owner builds a winning team. However, under AB 257 the franchise operators will be relegated to a subordinate role under the authority of the franchisor and a newly formed, appointed statewide committee of 11 commissioners.\n\nWhat’s more, cities with more than 200,000 residents will be subject to a redundant local committee with similar jurisdiction. Under this structure, franchisees merely serve as an ineffectual go-between for the franchise and the councils while maintaining almost all the business risks. Team building and skills development are little more than an afterthought under AB 257.\n\nSecond, the bill will impact the ability of operators and managers to run the business. The political appointed councils will have unprecedented authority to draft and enact workplace rules, free of meaningful oversight by legislators or the governor. Even mundane decisions like which paper towels and cleaning supplies to order are subject to the whims of the appointed committees.\n\nOperators who set the course for the franchise and managers who run day-to-day operations will effectively become obey-following autocrats in their own business.\n\nAB 257 will exact harm on a large segment of restaurant owners including minority and women entrepreneurs\n\nThird, the bill will discourage franchises from being part of the community. Restaurants are an anchor in the community supporting many local civic groups and sports teams. Restaurant owners are highly involved in community events and financially support many non-profit organizations. With less authority over daily operations, franchise owners will be less likely, even discouraged, from participating in the local community.\n\nFourth, among the biggest risks associated with the bill is the possibility that it will discourage business owners from starting new franchise concepts. Franchises are incubators for other franchises.\n\nIn a study by industry group FRANdata of 1,600 new franchise concepts that started over five years, 25% of the founders of these businesses had previously worked in franchising either as a franchisee, employees of franchisees or employees of franchisors. If AB 257 were to become law, entrepreneurs with a franchise concept would be disincentivized from bringing the franchise forward.\n\nFifth, AB 257 will exact harm on a large segment of restaurant owners including minority and women entrepreneurs who seek to employ others and earn a living in the restaurant community. Sixty percent of California restaurants are owned by people of color. Restaurant franchises are also well known for providing opportunities to women, the LGBTQ+ community, and new immigrant business owners. This legislation would reverse decades of progress made by minority small business owners who have achieved success in the franchise model.\n\nOverall, AB 257 unfairly targets one type of business and creates a model that will be applied to other California businesses. Franchise owners or not, small businesses are watching this bill with the expectation, if it passes, more California regulation on their own business will soon follow.\n\nIn the aftermath of COVID, neighborhood businesses cannot endure more prolonged hardship. For these reasons, AB 257 the Fast Recovery Act should be rejected when it comes before the California Senate.\n\nArticle by Erik Chaloub, Gilroy Dispatch\n\nGracie Garcia was a world traveler, who has floated down a river in India while looking up at the stars in a houseboat, explored the Hermitage Museum in a Russian palace, and partaken in countless other adventures.\n\nShe not only took in the surroundings, but she always made sure to take a piece back with her, of all shapes and sizes. The lifetime collector was drawn to the beauty she found in paintings, furniture and anything else that caught her eye.\n\nHer next big adventure was scheduled for June, when she was set to travel to Budapest. But the Hungarian city will not have the opportunity to welcome her.\n\nGarcia, the owner of Gilroy Antiques for more than 30 years and a downtown icon, died on Feb. 10 following a stroke she suffered in December. She was 82.\n\nTika Burns, one of Garcia’s four children, said her mother was passionate about antiques for as long as anyone can remember. She rejected most newly made things, son David Garcia said, possibly because they could not match the beauty and quality of something that has been around for generations.\n\n“I don’t think in our entire life she ever went into a new furniture store,” he said. “She always bought beautiful used stuff.”\n\nEvery international trip would result in a new item, or multiple things, for her collection.\n\n“The world is her marketplace,” David said.\n\nGarcia was born in San Jose in 1939, growing up in Campbell and graduating from Campbell High School.\n\nThe family lived in San Jose until moving to Morgan Hill in 1969, where Garcia pursued her other love of animals. They moved to a home on Fifth Street in Gilroy in 1977, where Garcia lived up until her passing.\n\nWhile living in Gilroy, Garcia commuted to manage the Main Street Exchange in Los Gatos. But after the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake damaged the building, Garcia began floating around the idea of opening her own store, preferably closer to home.\n\nIt was about this time that the hardware store at 7445 Monterey St. in downtown Gilroy had closed up shop, leaving the building available. Garcia purchased the building, and Gilroy Antiques opened its doors.\n\nCountless people have walked through the doors to view and purchase Garcia’s eclectic displays of furniture, kitchenware, artwork, jewelry and any type of collectible imaginable, or just to chat with the proprietor herself. She was known to make friends with anyone who stepped foot into Gilroy Antiques, and she often invited people to view the large apartment upstairs that would make any collector swoon.\n\nMost of her store’s merchandise was acquired through private parties, according to a previous Dispatch article, where Garcia described herself as a collector first and dealer second. Her taste in goods definitely leaned toward the Victorian era, her children said.\n\n“I love that store. It’s like a cocktail party without the cocktails,” Garcia said in a 2015 interview with the Dispatch. “I meet people everyday of my life. I’m by myself and I’m never lonesome, because I get so much fulfillment in the store.”\n\nLiving life on her terms\n\nVeteran downtown retailer Dave Peoples said he knew Garcia long before she opened Gilroy Antiques, as the two met thanks to their combined love of antiques.\n\nPeoples said Garcia was a “wealth of information” who was the go-to person for anyone trying to identify a certain item. He added that Garcia was always excited to see her friends, and was quick to land a kiss, with Peoples joking that he always had to “wipe the lipstick off my cheek” before returning home to his wife.\n\n“There’s no question that Gracie was her own person,” he said. “Gracie was just one of those unique people that when you met her, you were friends.”\n\nThe two may not have seen eye-to-eye on certain things, and “there might have been a year when we didn’t talk,” Peoples recalled, but their friendship remained strong for more than four decades.\n\n“She had friends all over the world,” he said. “Wherever Gracie went, she had friends.”\n\nPeoples said he never got the chance to drop off bread and jam for Garcia to continue the longtime Christmas tradition this past December, as her store was closed when he stopped by, not knowing that she had the stroke just days before.\n\nHe added he still has that bread with her name on it in his refrigerator.\n\n“She was a wonderful person,” he said. “We are really going to miss her.”\n\nLinda Ashford of Ashford’s Heirlooms said she’s known Garcia for about 30 years, having met her at a business mixer, commenting on her “huge fur coat.”\n\nAshford said Garcia warned her that the antiques business was not something you pursued if you wanted to make money, but rather, you had a passion for beautiful things. It’s advice that Ashford has taken to heart.\n\nShe said Garcia would always stop by the store to chat, putting her “Be back in 20 minutes” sign on Gilroy Antiques.\n\n“She wouldn’t hesitate to lock the door up and come down to visit,” Ashford said. “She would always shop and she would always find something beautiful. She just loved beautiful things.”\n\nSince the 1990s, Kim Dorris Rossi of Leedo Art and Framing has framed numerous paintings and “little treasures” for Garcia.\n\nThe two became fast friends.\n\n“All you have to do is spend five minutes with her,” Rossi said. “I realized I want to be just like her when I grow up. She lived life on her own terms. She told you how it was, and you got to love a person for that. The honesty is paramount.”\n\nRossi said she last saw Garcia as she was walking to Old City Hall for dinner. The two hugged, with Garcia telling Rossi, “I love you more.”\n\n“You know, we’ve got the memories, we got the stories, those smiles, those red lips, that blonde hair,” she said. “She was beautiful inside and out.”\n\nA void in the family\n\nThe future of Gilroy Antiques remains uncertain. But passersby can still get a feel for Garcia’s taste in collectibles as well as her humor, as evidenced by a sign outside that notifies those who do not wear a mask inside the store must have their temperature taken, “and we only have rectal thermometers.”\n\nPlanning is underway for a celebration of life.\n\n“She was the most wonderful mom, and I’m going to miss her dearly,” David Garcia said.\n\nBurns said her mother was very happy with her life, and her caring personality always wanted to see others lead a great life.\n\n“She just loved her life and loved what she did,” she said, adding that she would call her mother nearly every morning as Garcia was doing her crossword puzzle. “She loved everybody she met. Everyone she knew in Gilroy will tell you they felt very close to mom after meeting her.”\n\nArticle by Don Thompson, AP\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California became the first state to formally shift to an “endemic” approach to the coronavirus with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s announcement Thursday of a plan that emphasizes prevention and quick reaction to outbreaks over mandated masking and business shutdowns.\n\nThe milestone, nearly two years in the making, envisions a return to a more normal existence with the help of a variety of initiatives and billions in new spending to more quickly spot surges or variants, add health care workers, stockpile tests and push back against false claims and other misinformation.\n\n“We are moving past the crisis phase into a phase where we will work to live with this virus,” he said during a news conference from a state warehouse brimming with pandemic supplies in Fontana, east of Los Angeles.\n\nThe first-term Democrat, who last year survived a recall election driven by critics of his governance during the pandemic, promised the state’s nearly 40 million residents that as the omicron surge fades, “we’re going to keep them safe and we’re going to stay on top of this.”\n\nA disease reaches the endemic stage when the virus still exists in a community but becomes manageable as immunity builds. But there will be no definitive turn of the switch, the Democratic governor said, unlike the case with Wednesday’s lifting of the state’s indoor masking requirements or an announcement coming Feb. 28 of when precisely schoolchildren can stop wearing face coverings.\n\nAnd there will be no immediate lifting of the dozens of remaining executive emergency orders that have helped run the state since Newsom imposed the nation’s first statewide stay-home order in March 2020.\n\n“This pandemic won’t have a defined end. There’s no finish line,” Newsom said.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and with omicron fading in many parts of the world some countries have begun planning for the endemic stage. But no state has taken the step Newsom did and offered a detailed forward-looking plan.\n\nRepublicans have been frequent critics of Newsom’s handling of the coronavirus and were quick to disparage his latest effort. State GOP Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson called it “an extra-large helping of word salad” and renewed the call to “follow the lead of other blue states and end his state of emergency or lift his school mask mandate.”\n\nNewsom’s plan sets specific goals, such as stockpiling 75 million masks, establishing the infrastructure to provide up to 200,000 vaccinations and 500,000 tests a day in the event of an outbreak, and adding 3,000 medical workers within three weeks in surge areas.\n\nNewsom’s administration came up with a shorthand acronym to capsulize key elements of its new approach: SMARTER. The letters stand for Shots, Masks, Awareness, Readiness, Testing, Education and Rx, a reference to improving treatments for COVID-19.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Klausner, an epidemiologist at the University of Southern California, said while some may argue these should have come sooner, he believes “the timing is right on.”\n\n“Surveillance, testing, vaccination and treatment make the context very different and make it appropriate to shift our response from a pandemic response of trying to do everything possible, to a more rational response to try to implement things that we have strong evidence that work,” Klausner said.\n\nThe plan includes increased monitoring of virus remnants in wastewater to watch for the first signs of a surge. Masks won’t be required but will be encouraged in many settings.\n\nIf a higher level of the virus is detected, health officials will determine if it is a new variant. If so, state and federal officials have a goal to within 30 days determine if it responds to existing tests, treatments and immunities from vaccines or prior infections.\n\nCalifornia’s health secretary, Dr. Mark Ghaly, said one of the goals is to avoid business closures and other far-reaching mandates. However, he said the state’s requirement that schoolchildren be vaccinated against coronavirus by fall remains in effect.\n\nThe plan includes new education, including “myth-buster videos” to fight misinformation and disinformation and help interpret ever-evolving precautions for a confused public whiplashed by safeguards that seemingly shift by the day and vary across county lines.\n\nIn coordination with the federal government, it calls for a first-in-the-nation study of the pandemic’s direct and indirect impacts long-term on both people and communities.\n\nAll this will cost billions, much of it already outlined in the pandemic response package Newsom sought as part of his budget last month. That includes $1.9 million that lawmakers already approved to boost staffing at hospitals and increase coronavirus testing and vaccine distribution, as well as existing money and anticipated federal funds.\n\nHis proposed budget also includes $1.7 billion to beef up the state’s health care workforce, with more investment in increased laboratory testing capacity, data collection and outbreak investigation.\n\nNewsom, who has faced criticism for sometimes failing to follow his own rules, defended keeping in place some of his executive emergency orders, which he said most recently have allowed the state to quickly bring in temporary medical workers and to quickly distribute more than 13 million home test kits to schools.\n\nThose orders have dwindled from 561 to fewer than 100 in recent months, he said, and his administration is working with legislative leaders to eventually make them unnecessary.\n\nAlthough Gilroy is a retail destination within our region, we are frequently asked why certain retailers are not interested in Gilroy as a business location. The process to attract retailers has, over the past decade, morphed into an exact science that requires a City to have not only a sufficient number of “rooftops” and appropriate sites, but must also meet the requirements of detailed market analysis. The information considered by retailers in making a location decision is now driven by what consultants in this industry refer to as “psychographics”.\n\nUtilizing data on demographic make-up and shopping habits of residents within a market area, consultants are able to segment certain groups based on such things as ethnicity, household income, age, and sales data for the region. The end result provides the ED organization with a match of possible retailers that would be interested in your community as a business location. Added to that, we utilize market intelligence from the retail industry that includes information on companies that are seeking locations to expand in various states throughout the nation.\n\nThe retail analysis provided by consulting companies such as Buxton and others, helps communities identify who their consumers are within a retail market area and match potential retailers for attraction efforts. For example, consider we have a couple of male consumers -let’s call them Bob and Joe. The two men have the same income, sex, age, live in the same area, and are both married with two children. If a retailer such as Bass Pro Shops evaluated them based solely on the demographic data, they might consider both of them a desirable customer. However, in reality Bob owns a boat and enjoys fishing and hunting. The only thing Joe likes about fish is eating them. Bob would drive 45 minutes to shop at a Bass Pro Shop; Joe wouldn’t drive 15 minutes to shop there. Targeting consumers like Joe is a wasted effort for this company.\n\nAdvances in technology and methods of research allow companies and ED organizations to better identify customers, not people. We can now utilize information that tells us which households eat at Burger King, shop at Home Depot, read the Gilroy Dispatch . . . you name it. According to the Buxton methodology, every U.S. household can be classified into one of 66 distinct segments based on that household’s lifestyle and spending habits. Buxton uses names to categorize these dominant segments, such as the “Upward Bound”, the “White Picket Fences”, and the “Park Bench Seniors”.\n\nWhile these studies can be beneficial in attracting retail to a community, they can be costly to complete. The Gilroy Chamber of Commerce & Economic Development currently relies on demographic data, sales tax revenue reports from the City, and consumer spending reports from other data sources. While we know we are a sales tax capture community within the region with leakage in only a couple of areas, identification of niche markets and unmet consumer demand will require additional analysis.\n\nThe Gilroy Chamber encourages you to shop local and support our Gilroy business community. Every dollar you spend in Gilroy also helps the City provide essential services, infrastructure improvements, park maintenance, programs for youth, and a better quality of life for all residents.\n\nDr. Rose applied to Gavilan College in 2008 for the position of Vice President of Instruction, due to a career progression in higher education that spanned 25 years and included positions in administration and as a faculty member. During her years at Gavilan, she appreciated the leadership opportunities available to serve students throughout the district and support the growth of new academic programs. The thought of becoming the Superintendent/President was not at the forefront until the opportunity to apply presented itself. Dr. Rose was proud to become the 7th Superintendent/President and the second woman to serve the district.\n\nDr. Rose loves the community spirit that is a natural element of Gilroy. She has observed that Gilroy is a community that commits to important initiatives, prioritizes support services for those in need, and demonstrates an ethos of care that impacts all who work and live in the community.\n\nThere have been numerous accomplishments during Dr. Rose’s tenure. She was instrumental in supporting many instructional programs and several state and federal grants to support major initiatives. She supported several facility projects, including the solar canopies and the modernization of the athletic complex. Business and industry partnerships were strengthened throughout the district during Dr. Rose’s presidency. Most notably, Dr. Rose led the process that resulted in the latest bond of 248M that will result in the new San Benito County Campus and several projects on the Gilroy Campus. Gavilan College celebrated its centennial under Dr. Rose’s leadership, that included a historic gala and other events throughout the district. Finally, Dr. Rose has led the college through the many challenges of the pandemic, providing basic needs to students with the help of dedicated staff and faculty.\n\nDr. Rose is very optimistic about the future of Gavilan College. New facilities In Hollister and Gilroy will welcome students to the post-pandemic world with innovative technology, internships, and cutting-edge instructional programs. The communities Gavilan serves will continue to benefit from a more educated and diverse workforce, and many industry partnerships will deepen, The Gavilan Promise will provide opportunities for all students to succeed and reach educational goals. Dr. Rose will be retiring in June 2022 but looks forward to witnessing these changes as the district moves forward in the next 10-20 years.\n\nCommunity Service is a core value of community colleges across the state, and Gavilan College is no exception. Dr. Rose is proud of the tradition of service learning, volunteerism and giving which has an impressive history at the college. Dr, Rose feels strongly that the students, professional support staff, administration and faculty will continue to seek ways to give back to the communities within the district, knowing the benefits of public service is the practice of a lifetime.\n\nTom Cline, immediate past president (2020-2021) of the Gilroy Garlic Festival, was named 2021 Spice of Life Man of the Year by the Gilroy Chamber of Commerce. The Man of the Year award goes to an individual who has a history of unselfish service to the community, contributing to Gilroy’s welfare and betterment.\n\nWhen told of this honor, Cline responded in his usual self-deprecating manner.\n\n“I was surprised because I like doing things under the radar and I don’t need the recognition,” he said. “I don’t do it to be recognized, I do it because I want to help and to be part of the solution.”\n\nCline, who has volunteered for the festival for the past eight years, four of those on the Board of Directors, was named president in 2019 and was to serve his one-year term in 2020 until the pandemic hit. He actually worked with other board members on planning and organizing elements of the festival in 2020 and served his “official” term in 2021, so he likes to think of it as a two-year term.\n\nCline, owner of Cline Glass Contractors since 2011, said the award actually reflects not so much on him, but the work of the festival board and volunteers as a whole.\n\n“This award is an affirmation, a recognition that says a lot about our work as an association,” he says, especially for a trying past two years. “I’m proud of the work everyone has done over the past two years, it’s a total team effort, that’s what it’s all about.”\n\nWith a lost 2020 and a scaled-back 2021, Cline says the festival has a lot of work to do and challenging times ahead for 2022, a task that nobody in the association is going to shy away from.\n\n“We started something and we really want to see it through,” he says about the festival’s sense of resolve to continue. “We’re seeking to be relevant again and to meet the needs of all of our volunteers and charities. It’s a process, a step forward to get where we once were.”\n\nBorn in San Jose, Cline was raised in Morgan Hill but moved to Gilroy 32 years ago to raise his two children with his wife Cindy. His son and wife have also volunteered for the festival.\n\nThe Spice of Life awards dinner, which will include Man of the Year, Woman of the Year, and Business of the Year, as well as other awards, has been set for March 26.\n\nArticle by MATTHEW J. ROBERTS, ESQ. CalChamber\n\nIn 2021, the California Legislature passed a paid sick leave law that supplemented the existing state paid sick leave law — it required employers with 26 or more employees to provide up to 80 hours of paid sick leave for qualifying COVID-19-related reasons. This supplemental paid sick leave (SPSL) mandate expired on September 30, 2021, and was not replaced by any additional leave.\n\nThis year, the legislature is revisiting SPSL by introducing Assembly Bill (AB) 84 as a new leave mandate for 2022. Although many details are similar to 2021’s leave, there are some differences. Please keep in mind that AB 84 is just a legislative proposal; no law is currently in place, and AB 84 may be subject to change.\n\nThe proposed 2022 SPSL covers employers with 26 or more employees and will provide a new bank of up to 80 hours for qualifying reasons. An employee’s leave bank is based on their ordinary scheduled workweek with a maximum of 40 hours. An employee qualifies for up to 40 hours of SPSL if they’re unable to work or telework due the following:\n\nThe employee is subject to a quarantine or isolation period related to COVID-19 as defined by an order or guidance from the State Department of Public Health, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or a local public health officer who has jurisdiction over the workplace.\n\nThe employee has been advised by a health care provider to isolate or quarantine due to COVID-19.\n\nThe employee is experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and seeking a medical diagnosis.\n\nThe employee is caring for a family member who’s subject to a government quarantine, isolation order or guidance; or who has been advised by a health care provider to isolate or quarantine.\n\nThe covered employee is caring for a child, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 245.5, whose school or place of care is closed or otherwise unavailable for reasons related to COVID-19 on the premises.\n\nAn employee may then qualify for up to another 40 hours if the employee tested positive for COVID-19 or is caring for a family member who tested positive. If the employee requests this second 40-hour bank, an employer may require testing on day 5 after the initial positive test. If an employee is caring for a family member and requests this second 40-hour bank, an employer may also require the employee to produce the family member’s positive test. If the employee refuses to test or disclose tests, they are not entitled to this second bank.\n\nAn employee may also qualify for SPSL if:\n\nThe employee is attending an appointment for themselves or a family member to receive a vaccine or a vaccine booster for protection against COVID-19.\n\nThe employee is experiencing symptoms, or caring for a family member experiencing symptoms, related to a COVID-19 vaccine or vaccine booster that prevent the employee from working or teleworking.\n\nAn employee may be limited to 24 hours of SPSL for these reasons — unless the employee provides a medical certification for more time. The limitation is for each vaccine or booster shot.\n\nSPSL most commonly will be paid at the employee’s regular rate of pay, but there is a second option to pay based upon a 90-day lookback method, which is consistent with California’s regular paid sick leave. SPSL may be capped at $511 per day and $5,110 in total for each employee. Unfortunately, at this time no tax credits are available to directly offset this leave.\n\nThe SPSL is retroactive to January 1, 2022, so an employee may retroactively request leave for any of the above qualifying reasons that have occurred since January 1, 2022.\n\nLastly, employers will be required to:\n\nCreate a separate line on an employee’s wage statement that reflects how much leave the employee has used thus far; and\n\nPost in the workplace a notice that will be released by the Division of Labor Standards within seven days of this law’s effective date.\n\nIf AB 84 is passed and signed into law, it will take effect 10 days from the signature date."
