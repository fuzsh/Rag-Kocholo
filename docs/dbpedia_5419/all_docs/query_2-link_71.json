        "text": "News 04/06/2012\n\nTalleres Azuara works with Brazil's Mater LNG SA de Brasil to build a refinery of COP in the town of Araquari, in the state of Santa Fe.\n\nThe refinery will be ready to produce 690,000 tons of bio-combustible (b100). The resulting product may be used neat or blended with diesel in proportions of 5%, 10%, 20%, or 50%.\n\nIn the refinery we will also produce the following products:\n\nDistilled Glycerin: 80,960 tons / month\n\nStearin: 220,000 tons / month\n\nCalcium Soap: 71,424 tons / month\n\nSodium Phosphate: 4,800 tons / month\n\nPotassium Phosphate: 3,000 tons / month\n\nBiomass: 15,000 tons / month\n\nThe plant will also rely on complementarian infrastructure, with which it will be able to reduce water consumption and the media-environmental impact that plant may cause. In this sense, the construction also includes the construction and commissioning of a desalination plant, a riles plant and an electric generation plant based on biomass.\n\nLast May 28th, in Barcelona, Talleres Azuara participated, along with various Spanish companies that also took place in the construction of the biomass plant, at the meeting for the launch of the project."
