The Azuara structure is a structural feature of about 30 kilometres (19 mi) diameter,[1] located in northeastern Spain, roughly 50 kilometres (31 mi) south of Zaragoza.[2] The name is attributed to the small town of Azuara located near the center of the structure. It has been subject to controversial, generally rejected claims that it represents an impact feature. It was formerly listed in the Earth Impact Database, but was subsequently removed.
