        "text": "By of the\n\nIt's generally agreed that \"Citizen Kane\" ranks among film's best. After that, there's generally a lot of disagreement.\n\nWho really wrote it — was it Orson Welles and veteran screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz, or did Mankiewicz do it all himself? Is the title character, Charles Foster Kane, really based on William Randolph Hearst? Howard Hughes? Welles himself?\n\nHarlan Lebo — who wrote a coffee-table book on \"Kane\" and was a historical consultant for the 1941 movie's 50th anniversary rerelease — does a pretty good job of answering those questions and others in \"Citizen Kane: A Filmmaker's Journey,\" due out April 26 to mark the movie's 75th anniversary this year.\n\nLebo tapped previously unpublished material, interviewed the last surviving members of the \"Kane\" cast and crew (several of whom have since died), and tracked down what may be the only copy of the \"lost\" final script of the movie.\n\nThe result is an engaging synthesis of just about everything written about \"Kane,\" with expertly drawn conclusions that feel like, when you read them, the arguments are over.\n\nWho wrote \"Kane\" has been debated for decades. Mankiewicz shared screen credit with Welles on the script, but detractors later claimed the writing was all Mankiewicz's.\n\nBut Lebo shows how Welles, a master at tuckpointing narrative from his years of shaping stage and radio scripts, extensively reshaped the screenplay, and the title character. As seen by Mankiewicz, Welles said, Kane was \"simply as an egomaniac monster\"; Welles pared back the dialogue to reveal the character's inner emptiness.\n\nBut Lebo shows that there was a cost to that approach: While it's the things left unsaid that make \"Kane\" brilliant, they also left some audiences and critics confused.\n\nLebo also takes a deep dive into the Kane/Hearst connection, showing that, while Hearst was a partial inspiration for the character, so were many others, including Hughes, and that Welles reworked the screenplay to eliminate elements that were a little too close to the real-life publisher.\n\nIronically, Lebo writes, it was Hearst's battle to kill the movie and wreck Welles' career that did more to lash him to Kane.\n\nLebo's exhaustive viewer's guide at the back of the book includes a scene-by-scene guide, itemized details of \"Kane's\" budget and the most detailed cast list you'll see this side of Internet Movie Database.\n\nAll of that makes \"A Filmmaker's Journey\" a definitive resource for anyone interested in Welles and \"Kane.\""
