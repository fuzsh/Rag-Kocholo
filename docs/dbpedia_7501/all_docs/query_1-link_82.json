        "text": "David Fincher’s 2010 film, The Social Network, is about the life and loves of Mark Zuckerburg, the inventor of Facebook. The film is masterfully done, to say the least, but one thing I thought of when rewatching it that never struck me before were the parallels to Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane, which is considered not only his best movie, but one of the best movies of all time (although I personally enjoy Touch of Evil a little more).\n\nThe obvious comparison is that both films feature a male protagonist, who begins the story young and naive about how the world works, but then slowly gets pulled down the rabbit hole of corruption and betrayal as his empire grows. Both stories feature a woman that the protagonist is in love with, who acts as the source of inspiration for a lot of his actions. But there are far more comparisons to be made than just that.\n\nFor one, both are (mostly) true stories. Kane was inspired not only by newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, but also Samuel Insull and Harold McCormick, and aspects of Welles’s own life. So, while not a literal biography, there’s a lot of real life in it.\n\nThe opposite can be said for The Social Network; despite its “authenticity,” the truthfulness of the film was called into question after its release. While nothing in the film has been disputed as an out and out lie, the film is said to be best viewed as a “dramatization” rather than a documentary. So there’s fact in the fiction and fiction in the fact.\n\nBoth movies are told out of sequence using a framing device. In Citizen Kane, we begin with Kane on his deathbed as he utters his famous last words, before meeting up with a reporter who then investigates Kane’s life through interviews of people he knew; in The Social Network, we go back and forth between the litigation meetings and showing the events leading up to them. In both cases, the story begins in media res — which means we get immediately dropped into the story with little exposition, and then details are filled in later. (Some movies forget to actually fill in the details at all, but thankfully that doesn’t happen here.)\n\nSpeaking of which, both movies essentially “spoil” their stories pretty early on. Citizen Kane does it in the literal way, via news reel footage, but The Social Network also lets us know pretty early on that things are going to go south for Zuck and co. It’s not any big plot twist that he and Eduardo end up enemies. In both cases, this kind of storytelling puts the focus on why and how these things happened and not simply what happened. This kind of storytelling is getting more and more rare as everyone shouts “spoliers!” whenever discussing even the most basic aspects of a movie these days. Everyone is convinced that knowledge and experience are the same thing — and yes, you can spoil some kind of big reveal and make it less shocking, but you can’t spoil a great drama; the power comes from the emotion of the moment, and not how clever shocking every twist and turn is. I can tell you exactly what happens in the two movies, but that’s not the same experience as watching them.\n\nNext, both movies make heavy use of special effects and technology, but do so in a way that is completely invisible. When you think of special effects heavy films, you think of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Avengers, etc. but these two films don’t have giant armies or battles in them, so what would they need effects for?\n\nOrson Welles made use of a technique called “deep focus” on Citizen Kane, wherein the foreground and background were able to be kept in focus at the same time, allowing for a much more dynamic visual style of filmmaking than your average studio picture, but that’s not all. Welles also used miniatures, wipes, forced perspective, make up effects, and optical compositing to create breath-taking images — and yet none of these techniques were “invented” by him. All of them had been done before, but not to the level Welles employed them. Deep focus had been done in silent films all the way back in the 1910’s.\n\nLikewise, The Social Network used CGI in invisible ways. Notably, the Winklevoss twins were played by the same actor. Now, this is hardly a new idea; as early as the 50s, films have used one actor in two roles, most famously in the The Parent Trap with Haley Mills. But the limitations of doing it optically meant scenes had to be shot in static ways that aren’t that interesting. The remake of The Parent Trap was done in 1997, and technology at that point provided a little more flexibility, but the effect is still pretty apparent. The Social Network was able to seamlessly create the illusion of identical twins inhabiting the same space without having to compromise the cinematography. Beyond that, the film uses matte paintings and other digital effects to make its imagery more appealing — again, in practically invisible ways.\n\nAnd yet, neither film was that expensive. The Social Network only cost $40 million dollars to make — and I know that sounds like a lot, but for blockbuster films, a price tag of $120 million is pretty common. Kane came in at just under a million, which was also not that much for the era.\n\nI guess that’s where the most glaringly obvious split is: Citizen Kane was poorly received and The Social Network was lauded, winning the Oscar for Best Screenplay and nominated for more. Despite the aforementioned controversy surrounding the factual basis of the script, The Social Network still came out to rave reviews and made several times its budget.\n\nBut when talking about the creative heads behind each film, once again, a comparison can be made. Both Welles and Fincher are known for their commitment to excellence, and are said to be perfectionists. As a result, both filmmakers never did that well within the studio system. Fincher’s most commercial film was Alien 3, which was an unmitigated disaster, both as a film and at the box office (though I do kind of like bits and pieces of it). Most of Fincher’s movies have not been hits, most notably Fight Club, which, like Citizen Kane, did poorly in its release and took years to garner a new appreciation.\n\nDue to the dynamite directorial supervision for both films, each displays a surprising amount of visual style for a story that largely amounts to people standing around talking. Neither film contains any significant action scenes, and yet through excellent pacing, editing, and structure, neither feels its length — although Kane is a rather slow film and can be hard for some modern viewers to get into. The lighting in both films owes more to film noir than your standard drama. It’s obvious that Fincher is a fan of Welles. Just look at what Fincher lists as one his favorite films of all time…\n\nHmm… big surprise."
