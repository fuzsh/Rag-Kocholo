        "text": "In which I try to answer the question, “Should I watch Mank?”\n\nSo, there you are, feet up, thumbing through the Netflix menu one evening, when up pops a movie called Mank. You read the capsule — the fictionalized story about the writing of an old black-and-white movie called Citizen Kane — and then see the names David Fincher and Gary Oldman, reputable names for sure. Your thumb crawls toward the OK button — but wait! First, I have an important question!\n\nHave you ever seen Citizen Kane? If you haven’t, I absolutely urge you to not watch Mank. If you do, I guarantee you’ll find it baffling, irrelevant, and dull. If you’re unacquainted with the Golden Age of Hollywood, it might seem as odd and alien to you as Star Wars is to those whose favorite science fiction movie remains Forbidden Planet. Most horrible of all, it might even put you off watching Citizen Kane, an intolerable thought.\n\nSo, what is this Citizen Kane? I‘m not speaking as one of those provincial fanboys who demand that you see all forty films in the DC/MCU universe before you even deign to snicker at Captain Spandex: Monsters from Turlock. (Oh, for the days when B movies were cheap, unpretentious, and fun.)"
