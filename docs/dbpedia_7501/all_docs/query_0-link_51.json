The Chairman of the Committee will please come forward and receive the credentials already handed in. If there are any other credentials to hand in before we proceed with the regular program turn them over to the Chairman of the Credential Committee now. MR. RODGERS, Chairman of the Credential Committee: The members of the Credential Committee will please retire with me now to the ante-room to act on the credentials presented. The CHAIRMAN: We are now ready to take up the reports of the Standing Committees and Specialists. The first on the pro- gram is the Report of the Committee on Cereals and Cereal Crops, J. Miles Derr, Chairman, Milton, Penna. This report was then read by Mr. Derr ns follows: REPORT OP THE COMMITTEE ON CEREALS AND CEREAL CROPS. By J. MIL'SS DERR, Chairman. The production of cereals and cereal crops may be considered the greatest industry of the present day. On account of its importance to all classes of people it should receive a great deal of considera- tion. We have in our country several million acres of as fine land as ever kissed by the sun or tickled with a hoe. One crop from tlie farms of our great country would pay for all the railroad property of the United States. Corn. Let us consider a few of the leading cereals produced in the United States: \"Com is King,\" and has been properly named on account of its importance as a feed and value of the product. It is by far the most valuable cereal we raise. Our corn crop is worth more every year than all we get from our gold, silver and lead mines. It has been estimated that our corn crop is worth more than twice as much as our wheat crop. Our annual corn crop averages more than two billion bushels of shelled com every year. Corn is raised in nearly every part of the United States. Ohio ha» the highest nvornpfo ]>or noro, nhont forty-fw'^o bushels; Pennsylvani.'i third 11 and Florida lowe«t, about eleven bushels per acre. More than one half of our corn crop comes from the seven great states : Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Indiana and Ohio. This is the greatest com patch on the face of the earth. It produces more than one billion bushels of corn every year, or more than one-half our com crop. Can we realize how much corn one billion bushels is. Suppose it would be loaded upon wagons, forty bushels of shelled com to a wagon, and driving the teams so that the noses of each team would just reach the tailboard of the wagon in front of it, making a continuous train of wagons more than one hundred and ftf ty thousand miles long, or long enough to reach six times around the world. These seven states produce about one-half of our corn crop, and if we want to know how many wagons it would take io carry a whole crop, multiply the number by two. WTiat is done with this immense crop of corn? About nineteen twentieth of it is fed to stock in this country. About one twentieth is shipped to Europe. Com is the chief food of about forty million bogs raised annually in this country. Wheat. Winter wheat may be considered second in value and importance. Wheat is one of the most important grains known to man. It has l)een used for ages by the people of the Old World. Wheat was not known in this hemisphere before the time of Columbus, and our continent now produces more wheat than any other grand divis- ion of the globe. The United States as a nation takes the lead in the production of wheat. A large percentage of the people of Europe eat bread made from our wheat. Millions of bushels of this grain every year cross the Atlantic, and, with the exception of cot- ton, we get more for our wheat from foreign countries than any other crop. Wheat is grown in nearly all parts of the United States, but our best wheat lands lie north of the Ohio and Missouri i-ivers. Let us note some facts about one of the largest wheat farms in our country: On a certain wheat farm in North Dakota there are two hundred and fifty pairs of work horses and mules, two hundred plows, one hundred and fifteen harvesting machines, and twenty threshing machines run by steam. When the grain is ripe, four hundred men are employed to harvest it, and at the time of threshing there are six hundred men at work. Some of the fields contain 500 acres each. The men working in them labor in companies, under mounted over seers. In plowing the ground, scores of sulky plows, driven by men who sit on the plows, will move across the field together, plowinjr several acres each round. Harvesting on these big farms is a wonderful sight. On such a faiTU as the one being described, the work of cutting and threshing is done at the same time by a combined harvester and thresher. Some of these great machines are drawn by steam engines ; others by teams of twenty-five to thirty horses or mules. A single machine with four men will gather and thresh from seventeen hundred to three thou sand bushels of wheat in a day. The next question is. How is the whent inred for nftei- it leavrs •''«fl«'^«'- Digitized by Google 12 This is almost as great a business as raising the wheat. At some of the railroad stations in the wheat belt, and at all the large grain ports of the United States, there are large elevators, or granaries, used for storing the grain until it is wanted for sale. A single elevator often has storage room for more than a million bushels of grain. The elevators at Minneapolis alone can hold almost thirty million bushels air one time. The great wheat crop and the location at the head of navigation on the Mississippi River has caused two thriving commercial citien to be built, knowTi as tJie \"Twin Cities of the Northwest\" — Minne- apolis and St. Paul. They contain some of the finest business blocks in our country. The two cities now almost join, although their business centers are about ten miles apart. I have just described fhe greatest belt in the United States, and yet their average yield per acre would not satisfy many of our Pennsylvania farmers who are accustomed to having average yields of twenty bushels per acre, and I have in mind plots of 15 acres and more yielding an average of thirty-two bushels per acre. Oats. The oats crop of the country ranks third in importance. We pro- duce about one billion bushels annually and it is worth three hun- dred million dollars. Oats are produced in every state and terntory in the United States. Iowa leads in the number of acres sown, Arizona the lowest. Utah leads in the average number of bushels per acre, being about forty-three bushels per acre, and Florida the lowest, with fourteen bushels per acre. Iowa produces the greatest number of bushels. Florida has the highest price per bushel, South Dakota the lowest. Other Products. Next in importance is barley. California leads in total number of bushels produced, with about thirty-seven million bushels. Cali- fornia also leads in the number of dollars to her credit. Rye comes next in importance. All but ten of the states and territories produce rye. Michigan leads in number of acres. Idaho produces most bushels per acre. Pennsylvania leads in total number of bushels. South Carolina has the highest average price per bushel, being one dollar and a quarter. Pennsylvanoa leads in the total value of rye, having to her credit about three and one-half million dollars. Buckwheat is a very important crop, for several reasons: It is a <iuick crop and is in demand as soon as harvested; it can be l)r()duced on land that will not produce wheat, corn or oats suc- cessfully. Buckwheat is grown in twenty-four states. New York leads with 321,552 acres. Maine has the highest number of bushels per acre, about twenty-seven bushels, and Iowa the lowest, twelve bushels per acre. New York is the banner buckwheat state, her crop annually being worth tliree and one-half million dollars, or about one-third of the value of the buckwheat crop of the United States. Flax, another important crop, is raised in this country for the seed which is manufactured into oil and meal. About two and one- half million acres are producing flax with an average of a little more than ten bushels per acre, lu some sections during 1910 tiaxseed was worth two and yne-hall* dollars per bushel. In the production of flax, North Dakota leads in number of acres, the total number of bushels -and value of its crop amounts to nearly fifteen million dollars. Rice IS produced in nine or ten slates, with Louisiana leading in number of acres, 308,000. the }a:reatest number of bushels and the largest total value, being nearly eight million dollars, which is about »me-half the value of our whole cro]). The Unite<l States Department of Agi'icuKure reports the total production of com at 3,125,713,000 bushels as compared with 2J72,- 376,000 bushels for 1909, 27.4 bushels average per acre for 1910 as compared with 25.5 bushels the ten year average. These figures seem large, and it is hard to realize how enormous they are, yet the latest census report showing the great increase in the population of our country,*and especially, tlie alarming increase in our cities, makes it apparent that the greatest problem before the farmers of our fair country at the present time is the conservation of soil fertility, and its economical increase. Another half century of the reckless «ind wasteful manner of using the soil, as has been done in nearly all sections of our coimtry, will see the highest cost of living that has ever afflicted any nation. The United Stales report gives a comprehensive view of the crop of this country. One of our local papers gives a little better idea of the intensive farming of Pennsvlvania. It is as follows: -GREAT FARM STATE. PENNSYLVANIA LEADS ALL THE OTHERS IN INTENSIVE FARMING. PRODUCED FIVE PER CENT. OF THE CROP VALUE ON LESS THAN FOUR PER CENT. OF THE ACREAGE. That the State of Pennsylvania is leader in intensive farming, the doctrine of which is being preached by the State College and the Pennsylvania railroad, is indicated by statistics just compiled by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for 1910 which show that Pennsylvania last year had 8,3S4,000 acres in <ultivation in corn, barley, buckwheat, hay, oats, potatoes, rye, to- bacco and wheat. This is 3.503 per cent, of the total of 239,3'43.800 acres under cultivation in these crops in the United States, and Ihe average value per acre in the State of Pennsylvania Mas f20.50 as compared with |14.53 for the average value per acre throughout the country. These figures are of special interest to the Pennsylvania Railroad, which in the past four years has been conducting an active campaign in the interests of scientific farming. Much instructive literature has l)een disseminated by the railroad company in pamphlet form, while farmers' special educational trains have been operated on various divisions from time to time. In this work the railroad com- pany is co-operating with the State Agricultural Department and the State College of Agriculture. The Pennsylvania railroad recently announced that it had found its farming campaign a profitable one and that it intended to prosecute it vigorously during the present winter. Arrangements are being made for demonstrati<ins and lec- tures to be given in various parts of the State r»f Pennsylvania. The country's total farm crop value of barley, buckw^heat, corn, hay, oats, potatoes, rye, tobacco and wheat in 1910 was $3,478,417,773 and Penn- sylvania's share of this was fl72,362,500, or approximately ^ve per cent, of the total, with only 3.5 per cent, of the a<?reager^ Ad^ad 14 interest is given to these tigures in view of the fact that in 1909 Penngylvania's acreage in the above crops w^s 3.547 per cent, of the total of the country, with the percentage of the farm crop value for Pennsylvania of 4.311, compared with 1910, Pennsylvania's per- centage of acreage decreased, but her percentage of the revenue in these crops increased. MR. J. A. HERR: Mr. Chairman, 1 move that the report be re- ceived and placed on file for publication with the proceedings of the Board. The motion was seconded and agreed to. The CHAIRMAN: The next on the program is the Report of the Committee on Roads and Road Laws, H. C. Suavely, Chairman, Cleona, Penna. The SECRETARY: Mr. Chairman, 1 have a letter from Mr. Suavely that came in just a little while ago. It is addressed to me personally. Shall I read it? The CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will please read the letter. The Secretary read Mr. Snavely's letter as follows: \"Cleona, Pa., Jan. 23, 1911. Hon. N. B. Critchfield, Harrisburg, Penna. Dear Sir: I have beeu confined to bed and to the house since Thursday night when I took sick rather suddenly. My coming to Harrisburg tonight or tomorrow will depend u[)on rhe advice of the doctor when he comes to see me this P. M. I wish also to say that I have not written a report as Chairman ;)f Committee of Roads and Road Laws. I had written to a number of members of the Board and others for their views, but receiving only a few replies I deferred the matter until my return home last week when I took ill. f would be very sorry if I would miss all the meetings this week. Yours trulv, HENRY C. SNAVELY. • The CHAIRMAN: Gentlemen, you have heard the communica- tion. What action will you take? If there are no objections we will proceed and enter it upon the journal of oui' proceedings. The SECRETARY: Mr. Chairman, I have another letter here from Mr. Cowan, also addressed to me personally. The CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will please read Brother Cow an's communication. The Secretary read Mr. (rowan's letter as follows: \"Brookville, Pn., Jan. 23, 191J. Hon. N. B. Critchfield, Secretary of Agriculture, Harrisburg, Pa. My dear Sir: Owing to the death of a dear sister, I will be uji able to attend the early sessions of the Stale Board of Agriculture, but will try to reach there some time Wednesday, 25. Trusting the meeting will be a pleasant and profitable one, I re- main, ir» The CHATKMA>«: Tlie euJiimuBicaliuii will be received nnd en- tered upon the journal of our proeeedin$2;s. The SECRETAEY: Mr. Chairman, I have also received a letter from Mr. Fenstermaker, addressed to me personally. The CHAIRMAN: The Secretary will please read Brother Fen- stermaker's letter. The Secretary read Mr. Fenstermaker's letter as follows: \"Allen town, Pa., Jan. 23, 1911. Hon. N. B. Critchfield, Harrisburg, Pa. My dear Sir: The very sudden and unexpected death of our be- loved daughter Anna, aged 22 years, has made it impossible for me to attend your great meetings. Overcome with grief and cares, allow me to predict that these meetings with your most excellent program of a feast of good things can not but help to produce results in creating a more intense interest for better agriculture. Kindly convey my regrets to the members of the State Board and oblige. Very sincerely vours, P. S. FENSTERMAKER.\" The CHAIRMAN^ The communication will be received and en- tered upon the journal of our proceedings. MR. HUTCHISON: Mr. Chairman, I move that the Secretary be directed to reply to the letter of Brother Fenstermaker, extending our sympathies in this said hour of bereavement. The motion was seconded and agreed to. The SECRETARY: Mr. Chairman, I have prepared a telegram in expectation of this. I felt every assurance that somebody would make the motion, and the telegram that I propose to send, if ap- proved, is as follows: \"The Hon. P. S. Fenstermaker, Allentown, Penna. At the Annual Meeting of the State Board of Agriculture, now assembled, the society unanimously voted that we extend to our co-workef, Hon. P. S. Fenstermaker, of Allentown, Pa., the expres- sion of our sympathy in the time of such bereavement that has so suddenly fallen upon his home.\" The CHAIRMAN: Without any further motion the Secretary, by direction of the Board, will forward that message. The CHAIRMAN: The next on the program is the Report of the Committee on Fruit and Fruit Culture, D. A. Knuppenburg, Lake Carey, Pa. Is Mr. Knuppenburg present? MR. HUTCHISON: I believe he is on the Committee on Cre- dentials. The BEGBETART: Mr. Hutchison, will you b% Und •nough^to $tik the Committee to excuse him imtll he makes hie report 7 ^ Ic 16 Mr. CHAIKMAN: While there is nothing before the Board, I wish to announce that it will be necessary for us at some time to have a report of the Memorial Committee, and I think possibly it might be well to appoint that Committee at this time, so that if the Committee wish to do so they can collect any facts that they wish to incorporate in their record. I don't want to make the motion, but if there is no objection, knowing that such Committee is needed, I cannot see why the Chairman cannot proceed to the appointment of such Committee and yet, if it be thought best, it will be all right to make the motion. I make this suggestion simply for the reason that it is so customary to make the originator df the motion the Chairman of the Committee that perhaps the members of the Board might hesitate to make the motion for that reason. The CHAIRMAN: Do I hear a motion to that effect? MR. WELD: Mr. Chairman, I move that the Memorial Cora mittee be appointed by the Chair. The motion was agreed to. MR. HUTCHISON: Mr. Chairman, I find Mr. Knuppenburg is not with the Committee and I cannot find him upstairs at the Horti- cultural meeting, though he is said to be about. The SECRETARY: Mr. Chairman, are you ready to announce that Committee while we wait? The CHAIRMAN: I will appoint as the Memorial Committee Mr. W^eld, Mr. Black and Mr. Hutchison. The SECRETARY: Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that in the absence of Mr. Knuppenburg, perhaps someone who is on the pro- gram for this afternoon to make a report can be heard now. The CHAIRMAN: Very good suggestion. Now, will some gen tleman who is on the progr(im for this afternoon volunteer to make his report now? The SECRETARY: I was jus( going to suggest that possibly Mr. Hutchison might go ahead. MR. HUTCHISON: I guess the best thing to do when a fellow has a bad job is to get rid of it. I have my report here but not (|uite classified as I wish to have it. Though I have not got it paged, I think I can go on with it, and if I get off at the wrong place when it gets to the printer I will endeavor to have it then in the proper shape. If you will take chances on it I will go ahead. The CHAIRMAN: We will now hear from Mr. Hutchison, on the Report on Feeding Stuffs. MR. HUTCHISON: Mr. Chairman, I am not going to read all of this report. I would just say before I read that this woi*k has de- veloped so largely ihsxi it is hu impossibility to make a report of all the work that is done by the Secretary, and by his assistants, or those employed by him. It would require a bulletin to make such a report to you. But I will refer in my report to a bulletin that is published that will give you a large proportion of the work accom- plished. Mr. Hutchison thereupon read his report as follows: Digitized by VjOOQIC 17 REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON FEEDING STUFFS. By GEORGE G. HUTCHISON. Chairman. To the Honorable Members of the State Board of Agriculture: As your Chairman of Committee on Concentrated Commercial Feeding Stuffs, I be^ leave to make you the following report for the year 1910: With our new law that was placed upon the statute books by the last Legislature, which went into effect August 1st, 1909, we were in a position to proceed with our work with new courage. As stated to you in our last report, the old law was declared unconstitutional by Judge Tressler of Lehigh county. Our determination was to rid the State as far as possible of all feeds that were adulterated and falsely guaranteed. 1 hope to show you in this report that wo have been in a measure successful, and that we hdve entered upon an epoch in the control of the sale of Concentrated Commercial feeds in Pennsylvania. I would first call your attention to the condition that exists amon^ the millers in our own State. Before the passage of a Feeding Stuff Law, a large number of them bought adulterants to adulterate their feeds, but at the present time, the majority of them are grinding whole grains, that is, corn, oats and rye. They do not compound OP mix to any great extent. Kather, they buy their concentratefl feeds from the large manufacturers in the West and sell them as they are received. The millers of our State still pursue the old pi'actice of grinding ear corn, but this is not considered as good a feed as it was in former years, as hogs will not eat the cho]) which contains corn cobs unless they are ground very fine. I do not want io lead you to believe that our millers in Pennsylvania are perfect, but they are doing a business that is nearer the honest dealer than they did in the past. Our great supply of commercial feeds comes from Ohio. Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kansas and other Western states. Each has a by-product to sell. As we are the great market for feeds, they are all busy looking after their interests, and in this. I do not blame them, if they will give our farmers and stock feeders the worth of their money. The business of the Department of Agri- culture, through its Secretary and his agents, is to see that this is done. The feeds sold in Pennsylvania showed a marked im])rove- raent. As stated in my previous report, / am still advocatinr/ the doctrine that all feeds should te sold on their protein and fat value and their low fiber constituency, or the higher the protein and fat and the lower the crude fiber, the more valuable the feed. rt Digitized by VjOOQIC IK Gentlemen, it is tiuje for vou to STOP, THl.XK and CONSIDER the great question of purchasing your feed supply on- the basis that I have laid down to you. For your information, and that it may be convenient for you to refer to when you receive this report printed in the proceedings of this meeting, I have compiled the following table: TABLE OF ANALYSIS.

This table gives ,vou the analysis of the cereals as nature produces them. It also gives you the analysis of the by-product as the chem- ists find them, and I hope that this table may aid you in becoming educated in regard to the feeds that go to make up \\he concentrated pure feeds that are on the market. I am often asked the question, \"What is the analysis of the adul- terants that are mixed with the feeds that are found on our mar- kets?\" I will give you a table of the adulterants that we have found on the markets of Pennsylvania: Name of Adulterant. Crude Protein. Crude Fat. Crude Fiber. Com cobs, ground. Oat hulls, Inekwbtftt hvUf. . Per cent.jPer cent., Per cent. 2.40 , 0.60 80-O S.OO 1.00 ; ».m 4.10 I 1.10 i 48.80 ) Digitized by GoO^lf 19 By referring to the law, you will tind tbat corn cobs can onlv be mixed with com products, such as corn meal, hominy and gluten. In our work for the year, we have not found any corn cobs mixed with gluten. We have found one tirm mixing corn cobs with hominy feed and another jSrm manufactures a feed, using corn on the ear and hominy, but the fiber in this feed has been kept at about 10 per cent, as the law requires, except in two samples, and in these cases your Secretary ordered prosecution. We secured conviction in both cases and the fine of fSO.OO and costs were paid, which w^ere covered into the State Treasury. Oat hulls are a common mixture with feed, but the law says that if used, they must be so stated in the composition, and that the fiber content of said feed shall not exceed more than 9 per cent, with a variation of 10 per cent, of the 9 per cent, which would make 9.90 per cent. We have had some trouble with the manufacturers who are using oat hulls in a mixture, to keep their fiber near the amount stated. They claimed that they had old goods on the market of Pennsylvania, and that we had secured samples of this. They also claimed that they had trouble in mixing their goods to comply with the law. After a few prosecutions were brought, this firm placed on our markets feeds that now comply with the law. One firm indi- cated that they were going to withdraw their goods from our mar- kets, and this is a matter which they will have to decide for them- .selves. The gi*eat trouble during the year that we have had to contend with, has been the molasses feeds that were found upon the markets of Pennsylvania. The law prohibits the mixing of weed seeds with any feeds sold in our State. A number of manufacturers of molasses feeds persisted in mixing all kinds of weed seeds in their feeds. Their attention was called to these violations, but they still continued to mix weed seeds with their feeds. The Secretary directed prosecu- tion against the said firms, and we have secured conviction in each case, and we believe that we will be able by constantly looking after the matter to prohibit the mixing of weed seeds with any concen trated commercial feeds sold in our State. We think it is time that some of the Eastern states that are consumers of feeds as we are, would endeavor to have passed a law similar to our own. The Pure Food Law protects the human race, and we as men should protect the animals that cannot say what they will eat, but have to eat what is given them or do without. There should be more educa tion on this subject. Six years ago, there was very little known about the analysis of feeds, in fact, very few knew what protein and fat were, and it was only four years ago that we had written in the law, directing the manufacturer should give the analysis for fiber. The question came up at once, What had fiber to do with the foods? Rut you are all coming to find out. I do not wish to criticize any of the educational departments of our State, but I was very sorry to see that at the last Farmers' Week at State college, there was not one person on the program to give any instruction on commercial feeds, and in looking over the list of lec- turers at Farmers' Institutes T can only find one who was scheduled to talk on this great subject. I believe the question is important enough to the farmers and dairymen of Pennsylvania to have some oBe OB each section of the Farmers' Institute force that could or Digitized by 20 would talk on comujercial feeds as they are found in Pennsylvania. Vou will find a large number of instructors who are able to tell you all about fertilizers and other subjects. By the last information that was secured in the Department of Agriculture in regard to the amount of fertilizers sold in the State, It was estimated between six and seven millions of dollars worth, and after consulting with men who I believe know, I am safe in say- ing there are more than thirty millicms of dollars worth of concen trated commercial feeding stuffs sold in Pennsylvania during 1010. This will give some idea of the importance of this subject. I hereby give you a table that gives the names of the county, town or city visited, number of samples taken in each town, number of samples taken in each county and numbej* of towns visited whe\\*e no samples were taken. This table shows that there were 1500 sami)les taken by our Special Agent in 1910. It also shows the number of towns that were visited in which there were no samples taken. The reason that there were no samples taken in these towns, was that the feed on .sale had been sampled in other towns near by. We could not visit near all the feed stores in each <ounty, as it would have consumed all the time of the agent, and it would have been impossible to visit all the counties of the Connncmwealtli. This matter will be referral to under the hea^ of \"Our Needs.'- TABULATED 8TATEMKXT. § s M M « « *» S s o, . a Sc S Nnmo of 4 ounty Visited.

This meal is compounded to be used in the raising of young calves where there is a scarcity of nature's feed of pure milk. The firms that are manufacturing these goods are making a legitimate feed, and we have failed to find any adultera- tion in the same, and in reports that have been received from farm- ers who are using the calf meals, we find that they are favorable to their use. I here give a table which will give the analysis of three of the leading brands of this meal: No. 1— Protein, 27 per cent. Fat, 5 per cent. Fiber, 5 per cent. Composition: Locust bean meal, wheat (lour, flaxseed, cottonseed meal, beans, peas and lentils. No. 2— Protein, 27 per cent. Fat, 7 per cent. Fiber, 5 per cent. Composition: Oat meal, barley, linseed and cottonseed meal. No. 3— Protein, 20 per cent. Fat, 9 per cent. Fiber, 3 per cent. Composition: Oat meal, wheat meal, ground flaxseed and casein. There is a large amount of chicken feed sold upon the markets oJ Pennsylvania. A few years ago they were not known in our mar- kets, but at the present time there are thousand of tons sold. They are compounded by reputable manufacturers through the Wont and Digitized by VjOOQIC 28 by a number of firms in our own State. These feeds are sold to the consumer at an average of about 2^ cents per pound. In some locali ties, they run a little less and in other sections, they retail at ^ cents per pound, or they retail at $45 to f60 per ton. I have pre- pared a table showing what these different ingredients would cost per hundred pounds. Wheat, |l.t)0 Oats, 1.20 Buckwheat 1.20 Barlev 1.10 Kaffir Corn, 2.00 Millet, 2.10 Corn 1.50 flO.70 Dividing this by the seven cereals of which it is composed, we find that they cost on an average of one dollar and fifty cents a hundred or 1^ cents per pound or $30 per ton. The cost of these cereals com pared with that of the different scratch grains that we find shows a large profit to the mixer or compounder of the same. Of course, there is one reason that might be given for this difference in cost and that is the profit that must go to the wholesaler also the profit that must go to the jobber. This table consists of the price of the feeds as they are on the market today, but there is one way that the manufacturer of the scratch grains can reduce his mixture and that is by mixing wheat screenings with the same. The larger ]>ei centage of the scratch grains that are found upon the market are made up of wheat screenings. T am not condemning the scratch grain as a feed. I am only calling your attention to the difference in price between that which can be mixed by poultryman or farmer and those that are bought in the convenient way from the dealer. A few years ago, the Department brought prosecution against a number of firms that w^ere manufacturing chicken feed or scratch grain which contained a large percentage of weed seeds, but after our new. law went into effect, these have been eliminated to a large extent and the chick feeds that have been found upon the market, with but few exceptions, comply \\iith the Feeding Stuff Law of Penn- sylvania. There are a number of inquiries come to the Department in regard to condimentals that are found upon our markets. These condi- mentals known as invigorators and blood purifiers, are all sold on the market as feeds for domestic animals. Tn analyzing a number of these preparations, we find that they contain drugs that can be pur- chased in any drug store, and if our farmers and dairymen will se- cure Bulletin 175, ])ages 147, 148 and 149, they will find the formula or composition of these different condimentals. I find that the farmers and poultry^ feeders are always more anx- ious to get something to feed in a convenient form, which they pay from 100 to 200 per cent, more for, than if they purchased the mate- rials and compound it themselves. This seems to be the natural way of doing things at the present time. We would all sooner have other people to do this work in a wholesale way than to be bothered with it ourselves, but that is a matter for each individual to iec\\de.i^ Digitized by VjOOQ Lc 29 The question is often asked, What are distillers' and brewers' grains or by-products. I here give a definition of the same taken from Bulletin No. 175 for the year 1008. This may be of some information to those purchasing feeds, and as it is in a condensed form, it may bo of more value than if a full definition were given. DISTILLERY AND BREWERY BY-PRODUCTS. Distillers' Grains Analyses on pages 58 and 59, Bulletin Xo. 175. 1908. Distillers' grains are obtained from the cereals in the manufacture of alcohol or whiskey. Usually corn and rye are used, but some times, we find that oats, wheat or barley are employed. Briefly, tho process is as follows: The grains are coarsely ground and treated with a malt solution which converts the starch into sugar. Yeast is then added, thus changing the sugar into alcohol, which can be distilled. Tho residue, consisting chiefly of the protein, germs and hulls of tho grains used, is dried and sold as food for cattle. Distillers' dried grains, having all the starch i^emoved, is consequently richer in pro tein and fat than the grains from which they are derived. These grains are considered valuable and economical food for dairy ani- mals. Three samples of corn distillers' grains were analyzed, showing an average of 33.69 per cent, of crude protein, 15.24 per cent, of crude fat and 12.17 per cent, of crude fiber. The collection also in eluded one sample of rye distillers' grains which carried less than one-half as much crude protein than was found in corn distillers* grains. The sample also carried nenrlv three per cent, more crude • fiber. BREWERS' (IR.VINS. Analyses on iiages 58 and 51), Bulletin No. 175. Brewers' grains are obtained from barley in llie mannfactnie of malt liquors. The barley is first placed under c<mditions favorable to germination, and during this process, the starch is converted into sugar. The sprouts are removed and sold as cattle food while the malted grains are crushed, the sugar is extracted, and the residue is dried and placed upon the market as brewers' dried grains. Dis- tillers' and brewers' grains are fairly disgestible. Four samples were analyzed during 1908 and the average results appear in the following table: ^ XVEMABE ANAL¥l»i'KS AND RBTAIL PRIGBS.

We have secured convictions in all of these cases but one, and that case has been appealed to court and will be tried at the March term in the Centre County Court. In the hearings of these cases before the courts, there never has come up a question. in the argument of the attorneys for the defense in regard to the constitutionality of the law, and I am led to believe, from the information I received from the attorneys, that our law is a good one and well drawn. The Secre tary has been very anxious that our law should not be the means of prosecution, that we should endeavor to educate and inform the manufacturers of concentrated feeds of the meaning of the law and have them comply with the law without bringing more prosecution-s than is necessary. The men who are engaged in the sale of feeds throughout Pennsylvania are reputable citizens, engaged in legiti mate business, and our experience with them is that they are anxious to handle pure feed and give their customers a fair return for their money. I would like to call your attention to one instance where a large firm in the West, that for years handled large quantities of mixed feeds, that have placed upon the market feed running very high in protein, high in fat and low in fiber, and they are endeavoring to have their customers buy this feed. They claim that it is more profitable to buy a feed high in protein and fat and low in fiber than to buy the low grade feeds that were formerly on the market. There is axiother section of this law that we are pleased to state the manufacturers or importers of feeding stuffs are complying with, and that is, that upon the request of the Department they shall file a registration, giving the analysis and composition of their feeds. We have received 378 registrations for the sale of commercial feeds in Pennsylvania, representing over 1200 brands. Many brands were alike in their composition, such as wheat by-products, distillers* and* brewers' by ])roducts and whole grain feeds. OUR NEEDS. I would like to call your attention to some of our needs for the proper enforcement of this law. The work has so grown and the large number of feed products placed upon our markets has become enormous, and it is impossible for one sampling agent to visit all the feeding stuff stores in Pennsylvania <mce a year, and we find that a visit should be made at least twice a year to each dealer, if pos- sible. Therefore, we need money to employ one more sampling agent. We also need in the oflice one clerk who should be a stenographer and also able to keep books, as each sample that is taken by the agent means just a given amount of work in the oflSce. There must be records kept of these samples, and after they are analyzed, re- portf5 of the analysis must be made to the Secretary, to the dealer. 31 . to tke manufacturer, and one to be kept on file in the office. Thus you will see that 2,000 samples taken, means eight to ten thousand reports to be made of each sample. We also sent out 6500 bulletins and a large number of copies of the law. This all requires clerical work besides the thousands of letters that come to the Department requiring answers. We have grown from a very small beginning to a Bureau of no small means. I have endeavored in the short space of time that has been allotted to me, to call your attention to some of the most important things connected with our work. We have here at the meeting samples of the different feeds that we find on the markets of Pennsylvania, as well as samples of the adulterants. You will find a gentleman in charge of the same, and we will be pleased to give you any information that it is in our power to give. The Laboratoi-y is situated on the fifth floor of the Capitol Building, and you will find those in charge delighted to give you any information that they can. As the General Agent of the Department of Agriculture, I wish to return thanks to Secretary Critehfleld for his courtesy and kind ness to me and for the confidence that he has reposed in me in carry- ing out his work. I also wish to thank the Chief Chemist, Mr. James W. Kellogg, for his kindness and for the able manner in which he has had conducted the laboratory work, and to Mr. John F. St. Clair, the Special Agent, for the care and courteous manner which he has met the dealers throughout the State of Pennsylvania. Any information that I can give to any member of this Board or any farmer in Pennsylvania, in regard to commercial feeds, I will be delighted to do it. You will find our bulletin covering the work of 1909, one of the best published in the United States. MR. HUTCHISON: The most important statement in my re port is: \"I am still advocating the doctrine that all feeds should be sold on their protein and fat value, and their low fiber constituency, or the higher the protein and fat and the lower the crude fiber the more valuable the feed.\" If you get nothing else out of ray report, I would like you to make that statement. A Member: I would like to know the analysis of com silage. MR. HUTCHISON: 1.07 per cent of protein, .80 per cent of fat and 6 per cent, of crude fiber. It is low, as you see, in protein, and low in fat, but the great value of the ensilage is that in the green state it makes a stimulating food in the winter. Of course, lots of good feeders add some high protein feed with the ensilage to bring it up. Is there any other analysis that you would like to have? A Member: Let us have the alfalfa, please. MR. HUTCHISON: The alfalfa hay meal is 14.3 per cent, of protein — some will run a little higher than that; crude fat, 2.20 per cent Now there is a difference in the fiber of alfalfa running acc<»rding to the large stems which you will find in the plants; some of it runs a little higher and some lower, but the average is about 25 per cent, of fiber. A M^nber: Please compare the wheat bran rightpj^fg-^yQoOQlc 32 MR. HUTCHISON : Wheat bran is fifteen, that is a little higher, in round numbers, in protein; 4 per cent, of crude fat comparal with -20 per cent; and nine per cent, of fiber. The wheat bran has less fiber than the alfalfa. The report that I get from the men who manu- facture the alfalfa meal is that we have to add corn or something with it to bring it up. Just feeding alfalfa alone the dairymen don't get the best results. MR. J. A. HERR: Mr. Chairman, I move that the report be re ceived and placed on file for publication with the proceedings of the Board. The moti(m was seconded and agreed to. The CHAIRMAN: Is there any further discussion on either of the reports read this morning. MR. GLOVER: I would like to ask a question in regard to roads, for information. Whether the roads that were contracted for two or three years ago will probably be completed now? Up in our county of Union there was a road started from MiflSin to Lewis- burg, a distance of about nine miles, and after they had built about three miles the work stopped. Our people would like to know whether this road will be completed now. The contractor seems ready to go tm with the work, but there appears to be a hitch somewhere hero at the Ilighwa.r Department. The CHAIRMAN: Is there any oue here who can answer that question? Perhaps no one but the Highway Commissioner can an swer it. MR. HUTCHISON: We have had the same experience, and hun <lred8 and hundreds of others have had it throughout the Common- wealth. The appropriation of money made was not large enough 1o complete this work. Now our county has a peculiar condition. We have surveys made for four and a half miles of road out of Ty- rone through our valley. The survey was made, it passed our County Commissioners, and passed up to the high officials, and we thought we were going to drive on a State road, but our good brothers in Huntingdon, under the little amendment that was put into the State law afterwards saying that boroughs could get the apppropriation to build roads, came down here and put us in a hole, and Huntingdon borough got the forty-four thousand dollars to build roads in Hunt- ingdon borough for farmers to hitch their horses on, and gentlemen to run their automobiles on, and that has been a great detriment to the good road laws of Pennsylvania. I just think it is something we should consider and think about, and if the new road law comes here let us see that it ])rovides that the boroughs shall build their o\\^Ti streets. When these two fellows built the roads they don't even leave the hitching posts up for the farmers to tie their hoi'ses on. This has been a detriment to getting money to build roads, and that is why ours is not completed. I would like to go on record here as a member of this Board, and one interested in the farmers of Penn- sylvania, against the boroughs getting the money that shauld grv to the farmers to build roads. Digitized by vjOOQ IC / 33 The CHAIRMAN: Are there any other questions on the subject gone over? We want to have the discussions now. We have some rime for this. MR. WITTMAN: I might add another thing to what Mr. Hutchi son says in his report. He says something about people paying too much for scratch feed for chickens. They are also loosing a lot of money, because the grains used generally in making up these com- pound feeda are shrivelled up and far from being first class grains, and people paying more than the prices of the good grain are paying too much for this inferior stuff. The hens cannot lay eggs on stuff like that. It is all husks and fiber. The analysis shows that it is not a good feed to get results. I ran across a man who was feeding this commercial feed and he says you see the way I am feeding, and they will not lay. That fellow had a half an inch of that feed in the pen. It was all waste stuff. They would not eat it. They could not lay eggs. It was up to me and I told him to buy the grains himself and get the befit, and feed that, and in a few weeks he was getting lots of eggs. He had been feeding this other feed for two months and getting nothing, and besides was paying too much for his wisdom. MK. HUTCHISON: A little discussion of that scratch grain now may save some money. The SECEETAKY: I should be very glad if it would be scratched clear. MR. WITTMAN: Mr. Hutchison does not make it strong enough. He says there are thousands of tons sold in Pennsylvania, where ten years ago there were practically none. That is not big enough. There are thousands of tons sold in southeastern Pennsylvania. It is almost universally used. People don't seem to know of anything else because it is handy and ready mixed. The farmer seems to think it is too much trouble to mix his own feed. In one way the law is wrong. On the other hand, I send to St. Louis and buy a particular brand of chicken feed just because it con- tains a lot of weed seeds. My chickens are weed seed hungry all win- ter and T get more eggs because I feed weed seeds. You take the* droppings and mix them up and pour on blotting paper, and examine them and see what happens. These weed seedp are just ground up fine. They don't do any harm. My hen manure does not give me any weeds on my lawn. MR. HUTCHISON: Go on and state that the chicken and sheep are the only two animals that have the means of grinding up these weed seeds. MR. WITTMAN: That is what the Vermont Station says. The chicken that has plenty of grit grinds up all of the weed seeds. A Member: Why do you buy that weed seeds? MB. WITTMAN: It is a cheap feed I am buying. I buy it be- cause the man does not make any secret that it does contain a lot of weed seeds, and because ray chickens like it and it i.«i good, and they are hungry for it all winter long. 3 Diaitized by Vj^OOQ IC 34 The SECKETARY: You are not selling any of it? MR. WITTMAK: No; I am buying it all winter long. I think the law is wrong in that respect. I think weed seeds ought to be allowed in chicken feed. MR. HUTCHISON: Will they eat cockel? MR. WITTMAN: No, there are three weed seeds they wonH eat. A Member: What are the cheap feeds that chickens would eat? MR. WITTMAN: Low grade of oats, a poor grade of barley, three or four kinds of wheat, screenings, just simply a lot of hu^k and fiber and poor cheap buckwheat. It is the poorest kind of grain that is what it is. A Member: Some of the wheat in our county is smutty. How would that do to feed chickens? MR. WITTMAN: They would pick out the good wheat first. When forced they will eat the others and it causes a lot of damage. MR. HUTCHISON: I am glad Brother Wittman came up on that. Now, under the Secretary's ruling, screenings are the small grains or broken grains of wheat, rye, buckwheat and things of that kind, that are not wheat seeds. He has been buying small grains of wheat and oats, and small grains of other cereals. That part is all right but now he is buying up weed seeds on the market. He is buy- ing a large amount of cockel that they will not eat. There are other weed seeds that the chicken can assimilate. They are high in protein, though bitter, yet they like tliem when ground up as they grind them they get the benefit, that is the two domestic animals mentioned. I was talking on the cheapness of the feed and the fraud the man is paying for. That is what I was bearing down on. I am glad to have this discussion. That is what will sharpen us on that line. I would like you to say something about this calf meal. Have you any experience on that? Let us have somebody talk on this and get something out of it. .Unless there is something else to come up I would like to hear something on this subject. This calf feed is a new thing to me. I have had trouble more or less with calves and have given them mill^ for a long time, and this is a new feed to me entirely. My experience is that the best grain, that weighs the most is the cheapest and will pay. The warehouse people are asking seventy- five cents for common screenings. You cannot afford to pay that for it when good wheat is only ninety cents a bushel. I am sure there is not over sixty per cent, of food value in the screenings compared with good wheat, so T say the best grain is the cheapest. A Member: Mr. Chairman, I have in the past eight years fed calf meal at different times, and I have always found it a very good help when milk was short. It does well, the calves thrive. On the road question I want to say that in our county we had some years ago, when the State was assisting the county to build some roads, a number of pieces of state road built, and considering Digitized by VjOOQIC 35 the wear and tear that has been on them since that time, Tv^ithout any repairs^ we think they were good roads ; but having had no effect in all that time we think it would be a great pity for the state to kt them go to destruction now. They need repairing now. A Member: Mr. President that brings to mind this fact, that we have had a state road in my county for fonr years, and only two years ago and the last summer the supervisors had to go over the road and put on a fine coating of crushed stone to keep it in order. The matter of keeping up the public roads is a burden after they are built, and if this state board would take some action whereby the state looks after the maintenance of those roads besides the building it will be a good help. The SECRETARY: I want to suggest that after a while we will have a Committee on Resolutions, and if any gentleman thinks of any legislation that he believes would he profitable and beneficial to agriculture, and will prepare the resolution and hand it to the Com- mittee on Resolutions, and the Committee re])ort favorably on it, they can go to the Legislative Committee of the State Grange as well as to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Represeii tatives and Senate. That will be n \"rood way to f^et it started. I make this simply as a suggestion. The Legislative Committee of the State Grange is in session in this city now. If the resolution is presented to the committee the regular or appointed Committee on Resolutions of this Board and is adopted by tlie Roard, and a copy sent to the Agricultural Committee of the House of Representatives and Senate, also to the State Grange, it certainly will stand a vi^vy good chance to get before the Legislature. The CHAIRMAN: If you have any resolutions on legislation please hand them to the Legislative Committee as it will have a session at 4:.% this afternoon. The Legislative Committee consists of H. G. .McCjowan, A. J. Kahler, Matthew Rodgers, S. S. Rlyholder and E. H. Dorset t. MR. HUTCHISON: I wish to state on the subject of calf meal that there are several brands on the market. We have the com- position of three of them in our bulletin. You will find full direc- ticms how to feed on the package. It is a high concentrate. In pre I'aring it for use mix it with a little milk to start with, and as you ^ gradually get to feeding a little more mix it with water, and after a while you will get to feeding it without milk. Yon can scald it be fore you mix it. Scald in the morning that which you are going to feed in the evening. You can get full directions for feeding on each package. I have had ex])erience in growing one calf with it. It IS a feed that is very high in protein. This calf is growing very rapidly, it is not yet a yearling and is as large as any I have. T am not advertising this feed, T am just telling you one of the things that is on the market. There is no adulterant used in the making of this feed; it is pure. A Member: We had a Jersey calf that we did not want to raise and we could not sell it to anybody, and we determined to feed it for the butcher without letting it snck the cow. By the use of the meal we sold it at four weeks old to the huckster for eight dollars. /[^ o 36 A MtmHer: I was struck with one thing in the statement of Mr. Hutchison, and that was this: The diverting of the funds on the building of boulevards in the boroughs and cities. T want to call attention to the fact that the same thing is working in our schools against the rural population. The schools of the towns are being built up and made first-class while the schools of the rural districts are neglected and robbed of the funds that should come to them but which are being used to support the schools of the boroughs and cities. A Member: I want to add that there will come before the Legis- lature a bill called the School Code, one of which went through the Legislature two years ago, and very fortunately was set aside by Governor Stuart. This one goes considerably further in some re spects than that one. It adds quite a number of things to the curriculum. T have been a school director off and on more or less for tw'enty years, and I feel thoroughly satisfied that should such a thing become a law the farmers of Pennsylvania will find them- selves very much embarrassed. I find further and T think there are a great many other farmers in this state that will agree with me. that we have now longer school terms than the people in the country can comfortably take care of; and they easily agree with me now that we have as much curriculum as our children can handle, and that the only thing that we need now is better teachers if we can get them. The CHAIRMAN: Any further remarks? If there is anything on that particular subject very urgent, put it in writing and present it to the Legislative Committee, because there are certain conditions in that that will come up in the regular work of that Committee. If there are no other remarks on that subject, what action will you take on the Report of Brother Hutchison? A Member: Mr. Chairman, I move that it be received and placed on file for publication with the proceedings of the Board. The motion was agreed to. The CHAIR:\\rAN: The further order is New Business and Un finished Business. We will take up the Unfinished Business first. The SECRETARY: 1 know of none, Mr. Chairman. MR. HERR: T would suggest that under the head of New Busi- ness we fix the time and place of our summer meeting. That is one item under the head of new business. ^tR. IIT^TCHTSON: T think the Committee on Credentials should reiK)rl fiist, because each one of those gentlenuMi would be entitled to a vo((\\ Could we iml have a ])nrtinl report of tju* Connnittei* on C'redentials. MR. 1IERI\\: >\\'c are all members of (he Board of Agricullure until the day fixed for the admission of new members and that will be tomorrow. Therefore, T guess my motion would be out of order. The SECRETARY: I think we had better wait for the Report of the Committee on Credentials until tomorrow, when the new mem bers can be received. The report could be received now so far as delegntes are concerned, but not as to members of the Board. ^ Mr. HUTCHISON: Is that the decision of the Secretarv or the hiw? The SEOKETAKY: 1 do uot kuow that the Setietarv has the right to rule upon that question, but certainly the old members that are present, whose term expires with this year, have a light to act until their places have been filled by the incoming members. We are in session today, just as we were last year, and there can be no new organization or new work done that pertains particularly to the newly constituted Board until after the <»lettion tomorrow. That day is fixed by Act of Assembly. The CHAIEMAN: The report of the Committee on Credentials heing received does not necessarily seat the members until tomorrow at the proper time. I think it is proper to have a Committee on Resolutions ap})ointe<l at this time, will somebody make n motion to that etl'ect. A Member: Mr. Chairman, 1 move that five members <if the Board \\*e appointed as a Committee on Resolutions. The motion was seconded, put and agreed to. The CHAIR: As a Committee on Resolutions the Chair appoints Messers. F. D. Kerrick, Bradford County; J. A. llerr, Clinton Coun- ty; Sylvester Shaffer, Lawrence County: W. K. l*erham, \\Vayne Coun- ty, and M. P. Shoemaker, Westmoreland County. MR. HUTCHISON: Mr. Chairman, 1 move that a Committee of three be appointed to wait upon the Governor. The motion was seconded, put and agreed to. The CHAIRMAN: The Chair appoints Messrs. Sylvester Shaffer, A. P. Young and J. H. Wilson as a Committee to wait upon the Governor and inform him that the Board is in session, and invite him to meet this convention. The CHAIRMAN: Anything further under New Business, gen tlemen? MR. HUTCHISON: I would suggest that the Governor be waited upon as early as possible so that he may be able to arrange his mat- ters to be with us this afternoon. If possible it would be excellent to wait upon the Governor this forenoon. The SECRETARY: Permit me to say that possibly the members would be very glad to have the opportunity to go over to Johnston's Hall and look at the exhibits a little while before dinner. The Gommittee has gone to a good deal of expense in gathering and placing these exhibits, and we mij>ht lake this opportunity of going over there and looking them over. MR. CLARK: I just came from the building, and it is almost impossible to finish the arrangement of the exhibits with the crowd in the house. MR. HUTCHISON: Why not ask Mr. Knuppenburg to report now? The tt«:CRETARV: Ue is not to be f^umi. Digitized by GoOglc 38 The CHAIRMAN: We will now have the Keport of the Com- mittee on Credentials, if thev are ready to report.

A Member: I would move that there be added to these members the Master of the Lackawanna County Grange, Mr. J. W. Ross. The motion was seconded, put and agreed to. The CHAIRMAN: What action will you take on the recommenda- tion that the members be received? A Member: I move that action on the members be deferred until tomorrow at the proper time. A Member: What is the proper time tomorrow ? MR HERR: Any time Wednesday. Wednesday is the day— any hour. I think their terms commence tomorrow, according to law. The motion was seconded, out and agi'eed to, to postpone action on the election of members until tomorrow. The CHAIRMAN: 1 think that the Chairman is ready to enter- tain a motion that visitors who are not regularly appointed by any society shall have the privilege of entering into the discussions. The Chair is ready to entertain a motion of that kind. A Member: I move you that visitors be received and be given the privilege of the floor as others to take part in the discussion. The motion was seconded, put and agreed to. The SECRETARY: Mr. Chairman, I believe there are and will be a number of visitors here who will take part in the discussion and help our work along and I would be very glad if such visitors will send their names to the desk in order that they may be entered upon our minutes. The invitation now is extended to any organiza- tic Ired character and these persons will have the privileges 40 of the floor. I would be very glad to know who accepts the invita- tion.

Vice President J. C. Weller in the Chair. The CH AIKMAN : The meeting will come to order. We will now haTe the report of the Committee on Fruit and Fruit Culture, by D. A. Knuppenburg, Chairman, Lake Carey, Penna. Mr. Knuppenburg then presented his report as follows: REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON FRUIT AND FRUIT CUL TURE By D. A. KNUPPENBURG, Chairman. The year that has so recently slipped out of the arena witnessed a decided march forward in many directions. Looking back over the record and weighing the importance of the different lines of progress, we naturally place at first, the phenomenal development in Agriculture. In the light of past events, I confidently believe that if the year 1911 sees advancement correspondingly as great as that of 1910 there will have been accomplished most marvelous results. In the march of progress those things that most closely concern the home, is the movement to make farm life more attractive and re- munerative ; the strong interest manifested in civic improvement and the Increasing demand that the public schools shall furnish an all-around education that fits our children for active, honorable and self-reliant life. All these and many other forward movements are good, and should enlist the interest and support of every right minded person. The Department of Agriculture is to be congratulated on the changes that have been wrought along this line; but we are only standing on the threshold of what must be accom- plished. This is not a result of second-hand information but a mat- ter of absolute personal knowledge. The people of the State of Pennsylvania have not fully realized the vastness and importance of the wonderful resources before them. Fruit growing has been profitable where near markets, but little has been done toward bringing the people to properly understand the great possibilities within their reach. However, we are prepared to report rapid progress. In proof of this, I wish to call attention to the display of fruits at Horticultural meetings, fairs, institutes, orchard meetings and Grange meetings, which sp^ak in terms too plain to be misunderstood of the advancement of fruit growing in Pennsylvania. It has been fairly demonstrated that a great per cent, of our cheap lands are admirably adapted to the growing of fruits if intelligent and up-to-date methods are used. New acres have been uppermost in the minds of the husbandman. They ae yet hare scarcelv begun to utilize them as thev mav and loill in future • • \" ' Digitized by J 4£ years. Fruit trees respond beyond the belief of the ordinary person even on what is called worn-out land. The roots penetrate deeper and feed on the fertility stored beyond the reach of the ordinary field crop. Fruit trees put on rapid growth if properly cultivated, fertilized and pruned, and the ever present insect pests held in check by use of improved spray methods, all of which must be followed up intelligently. The State is doing a great work in bringing the people to under- stand and practice the new way of growing trees, gathering, pack- ing and marketing fruit. In the model and supervision orchard work now carried on by the State through the Bureau of Zoology, the people are taught to select a proper site; next to prepare the soil for the planting; also how and where to buy stock, how to select varieties best adapted to each locality, how to plant, prune and fertilize; to know dangerous insect pests and how to suppress them. Among the most destructive of these are the San Jose scale, borers, codling moth, curculio, aphides, oyster shell scale^ scurfy scale, Put- nam scale and the caterpillars. Next comes the fungus diseases, blights, mildews, rusts and rots. Pennsylvania lost one million dollars in 1910 from the ravages of codling moth alone. We see apple, pear, peach, plum, cherry, blackberry, raspberry, gooseberry, strawberry and many other small fruits all in their natural state growing wild. What better proof can we look for as to the adapt- ability of Pennsylvania to fruit and fruit growing? What would we think to see a lumbering railroad train with an ancient wood burning engine and a man between each car twisting away at a cast iron break wheel, trying to manage the railroad business of today? This would be just as much in keeping with the times as to see people trying to grow fruit under the system that prevailed fifty years ago. As our young men and women become edu- cated, the fcirm home is left to the renter, and soon dissolution reigns. The work now in progress by the State of carrying practical informa- tion direct to the rural districts, is working out the problem to satis- faction. That is just what is happening on many farms in Penn- sylvania. The bounteous crops of fruit harvested where improved methods have been applied proves beyond a doubt that there still remains in Pennsylvania soil greater wealth than has ever yet been brought out. Thousands of people are encouraged and starting back to occupy the homes once left to the owls. Over 1100 orchards have been treated for insect pests with very marked results; seventy-five per cent, more fruit trees now growing in Pennsylvania than three years previous. Peach comes in profitable bearing the fourth year, apple four to eight years. Jonathan apple has given three bushels per tree the sixth year. The fruit crop of Pennsylvania in 1910 was not large, and good prices prevailed; prices of apples last fall ranged from seventy-five cents to one dollar and a quarter per bushel. Peaches from sixty cents to one dollar and a half a basket. The kinds of apples most favored for planting are principally, Northern Spy, Baldwin, Rhode Island Greening, Staynian Winosap, Grime's Golden, York Imeprial, Winter Banana, Stark, Delicious and Jonathan. There is a grow- ing demand for currants and gooseberries and a ready market for small fruits. The market calls for quality. The small things of earth confound the wise, and still there is room. ^ , Digitized by VjOOQIC 43 The CHAIKMAN: You have heard the report. What action will you take upon it? MR. BLYHOLDEK: I move that it be received mid phucd on file for publication with the proceeilinfrs of the Hoard. The motion was agreed to. The CHAIRMAN: The next on the program is the ReiK)rt on Forests and Forestry, by Robert Conklin, Harrisburg, Penna. The SECRETARY: Mr. Chairman, Mr. Conklin vnU not be able to be present at this afternoon's session, but he has .^ent as his substitute Mr. Robert E. Rupp, who belongs to his Department. The CHAIRMAN: We will be pleased to hear from Mr. Rnpp. Mr. Rupp then presented the report as follows: REPORT ON FORESTS AND FORESTRY By ROBERT CONKLIN, Harrisburg, Pa. It is the duty of a government to perpetuate itself, and in per- petuating itself there is a further duty to provide for the common welfare of its citizens. With these objects in view, it is wise for a .state to see to it that every square foot of soil, the source of wealth, be made to produce its highest revenue. Whenever elements of pro- duction are allowed to be wasted, the whole moral fiber of those in connection with the waste is lowered and general dissatisfaction follows. The state in turn, suffers from undesirable citizens, loss of industry, income, and at the same time outlay for remedial meas- ures, and a host of economic conditions which can hardly be followed. Pennsylvania stands high in the list of states, agriculturally, and we are all proud of ^er record, but as long as it remains true that at least 8,000,000 acres of productive soil are not paying interest on a low investment in them, to say nothing of taxes, and other miiliiWis of acres are not producing more than half of what they are capable, we can still bow our heads in shame and think on the matter seriously; When we grasp the enormity of this blot on our records we should be stirred to redoubled efforts to put Pennsylvania where she belongs — not high in the list, but the Keystone of the Arch. The fact is sometimes overlooked that trees grow on soil and that a wood crop is just as truly a crop as a crop of wheat. It is this fact that I want to recall to your minds today. Trees will grow on soil which is too rocky or too poor to grow any agricultural crop, be cause only a very small percentage of their make-up is taken from the soil. But it is also true that some trees will grow much more rapidly on moderately good soil than they will on poor soil. They will grow on hillsides too steep to farm, where erosion is taking place or is hard to prevent, along streams, roads and in undesirable comers. They require practically no attention after planting and arc* all the time growing into value financially and otherwise, r^^^^]^ ^ Digitized by VjOOQIc 44 Fifty j#arg ago a farmer in Eastern Pennsylvania planted Norway spruce and European larch along his fence rows. Today the trees alone are worth almost as much as his farm, and yet they have taken nothing from his annual crops, but rather increased them by re- ducing evaporation over the fields. At least 4,000,000 acres of cleared farm land in Pennsylvania are fit only* for growing trees. Why are they not being planted? Simply because the farmers do not know how, what or when to plant and the returns which may be had from planting. Education must be the keynote of our activity. The present schemes must be intensified, new schemes must be devised, and every means used which will bring economic farm education to every farmer and his family. There must be more co-operation on the part of the Departments concerned — principally those of Education, Agriculture, and For- estry. School gardens, elementary agriculture, agricultural clubs. Arbor Day, and so on must be gotten into the schools. The school buildings should be the social centers of the communities, and if necessary, the Government must send out social settlement workers. Agriculture and forestry must no longer be left out of county and local teachers' institutes, nor should a consideration of the schools and forestry be left out of farmers' institutes. There are no forestry institutes, but lectures, bulletins, sample plantings and all manner of assistance must be provided for. It behooves every member of our Departments to make each appropriation reach as far as pos- sible, but it is more important that results are obtained from what is done, and then the results themselves must and will speak for in- creased assistance from the Legislature. During the past year the activities of the Department of Forestry advanced steadily both along established lines and along new lines. There have l)een added to the reserve area 17,000 acres, making the total area of reserves now owned by the State 933,582 acres. There are thirty-nine t mined foresters and eighty-five rangers in charge of this large are«n, using every means available to develop it as rapidly as posvsible and to bring it up to the best economic production. The importance of protection, especially from fires, is appre- ciated, but only a small ])art of a perfect system of protection could be carried out. The survey, opening and matking of boundaries has been continued. Over 1000 miles of roads or trails have been opened this year, making possible the better management of M|e re- serves, and at the same time making them more accessible m^be citizens of the State. Old material which would otherwise become fuel for fires or a hindrance to young growth has been gathered and sold at a profit. A number of fire observatory towers have l)een built and should now be connected with the foresters' headquarters by telephone. Improvement cuttings have been made and some old and decaying trees manufactured into lumber, the object in all cases being to make room for good, sound, young growth yielding a liigli rate of interest instead of that whidi is decreasing in value. About 1| millions of forest tree seedlings have been planted this year on the reserves and several hundred thousand more were raised in the nurseries and sold at cost to people of the State. In addition to this, the Department gave assistance to many individuals who wanted to make plantations by making ]>lan<ing plans for them ami then superintending Mk* planling ilsclf. in tlic nurseries of llie re Digitized by VjOOQIC 45 M»ive« there are over 5,000,000 swdlings, niul llie area and production of our uursseries are being increased as rapidly as possible. The Dc- pai-tment aims at a planting record ol' 20,000,000 seedlings a year on State holdings alone, and that is none too few. The reserves have been open to the public as recreation grounds and during the year 3,550 persons have obtained camping permits, these being required when it becomes necessary (o build tires for cooking. The camps have been distributed in 22 different counties. There is absolutely no restriction in the matter of hunting and fish- ing on the Reserves, except what the game laws impose. The De- partment wants the people of the State to use the Reserves to their fullest extent, only asking that no needless damage be done to trees and birds, no game laws violated, and no fires built without per- mission. In addition to those obtaining permits, at least 10,000 per- sons have used the Reserves for hunting, fishing, or a day's outing not, however, including the thousands of people who frequently visit Mont Alto and Caledonia Parks on the South Mountain Re- serve. We have no notion of the number of people who go upon the Reserves annually for berries nor of the value of the crop which they harvest. The Forest Academy "
