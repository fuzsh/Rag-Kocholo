        "text": "Released in 1941, Citizen Kane is an old but treasured film that could teach the film enthusiast a thing or two. Mainly about the failure of a tycoon’s social aspirations in early America, it also is a film that can truly be appreciated if watched more than once.\n\nSet against the backdrop of a young America, the movie revolves around Charles Foster Kane, an aspiring newspaper publisher who leverages his fortune to create one of the biggest fictional dailies in the country. Although Charles Foster Kane is not a real person, it is commonly accepted that the film is a partial attempt at depicting the life of William Randolph Hearst, a prominent newspaper publisher who died ten years after this film was made.\n\nThe story of Citizen Kane begins innocuously enough. It is announced in various newspapers and reels that Charles Foster Kane, owner of The Inquirer, one of the biggest newspapers in America, passes away in his palatial residence, the Xanadu. This event sparks a rush among the media to find out everything about his life, mainly the meaning of his last words, Rosebud. Mr Rawlston, the head of a prominent newspaper, gives one of his reporters an assignment to interview multiple people close to Kane and to form a biography of sorts. This is what he finds.\n\nCharles Foster Kane is a young boy whose parents want to ensure financial stability and wealth for the rest of his life. So, they hand him off to Mr Thatcher, a private banker, along with the deed to a gold mine, the Colorado Lode, which is to be managed by his prudence until Charles is old enough to inherit the fortune.\n\nMr Thatcher dutifully manages the wealth and grows it into a huge net worth which gets handed off to Kane when he is of age. Kane defies his guardian at every turn, refusing to accept his advice of being prudent in managing his newly acquired wealth. Eventually he reveals his plans to Mr Thatcher, asking for just one business, a budding newspaper called The Inquirer.\n\nOver the rest of his working life, Kane carefully grows the newspaper into a large enterprise, unconcerned about making profits, instead carving out a public persona for himself. Alongside his newfound success, he also climbs the social ladder by marrying the niece of the US president.\n\nCracks start to appear in his professional life and personal life when distance grows between him and his wife. He also starts to lose pieces of his bond with his friend Jed Leland, a dramatic critic who writes for the Inquirer.\n\nKane starts to chase political aspirations, campaigning for the post of governor. But his chances of a political career are ruined when he is caught in an affair by his rival, Boss Jim Gettys. Kane divorces his wife and within two weeks marries his lover, Susan Alexander.\n\nFrom this point on, Kane starts to lose focus on his newspaper which is in decline. He devotes much of his energy to making his wife, Susan Alexander, a famous opera singer. She despises him for this and eventually leaves him after years of being locked up in an unhappy marriage at the Xanadu, his primary place of residence, where he becomes a recluse in the later years of his life.\n\nLooking for top-rated Anime Gear?

However, Mr. Thompson, the journalist tasked with finding the meaning of Kane’s final words, is left with no explanation as to what Rosebud means. He gives his conclusion to a crowd of people around him, presumably his colleagues, saying that Rosebud was probably a missing part of a symbolic puzzle in Kane’s life.\n\nWhat are the themes in Citizen Kane?\n\nThere are a lot of overlapping ideas in the film which make it a compelling watch. The first striking aspect is Kane’s dislike towards big business and corporate greed, despite becoming a newspaper tycoon himself.\n\nWhen Mr Thatcher and Kane start to clash in the first part of the movie, it’s very easy to see the values at combat here. Mr Thatcher is a conservative banker who wants to protect his and Kane’s money, while his protege is looking to spend it every chance he can get.\n\nIn one of the best scenes of the movie, he defies Mr. Thatcher, saying that if he were to make a loss every year on his newspaper, he would only have to close it down in sixty years. So, we can assume from this scene that he had been contemplating a life of largesse driven by social causes instead of conservative wealth.\n\nEven though he has big dreams, Kane repeatedly fails to achieve his aspirations in the movie. He fails in his political career and his relationships as well. But on the surface, he is still a successful publisher who holds big parties and rallies the public, still defying the idea of the conservative businessmen, i.e. Mr Thatcher.\n\nWe also experience the trajectory of a life, which inexplicably comes with loss. Kane sacrifices relationships for his own selfish needs, something he does out of a misplaced sense of love, either for his newspaper or his second wife, or for his self-image. This is why he is frequently criticized by people as being someone who can only love someone on his terms, which is perhaps the strongest theme in the movie, selfish love.\n\nWhat’s clear by the end of the movie is that Kane loves nobody but himself, only giving affection and support out of a need to fulfill his aspirations, in some cases mixing them with the dreams of other people. We see this the most when he tries to make his second wife a famous opera singer, forcing her even though she no longer wants to pursue her former dreams.\n\nFinally, the concept of Rosebud is something we see throughout the film. While Mr Thompson is unable to figure out what Rosebud meant, he is close in his guess, assuming that it was something missing from the prominent tycoon’s life. It also shows us that despite Mr Kane’s many ambitions in his life, his unconscious desires, at a base level, were simpler than most people would believe. This is another theme in the movie which is a loss of childhood.\n\nRosebud is a reference to the childhood he never had, a desire he held on to from the very beginning of his road to riches. Kane was separated from a happy upbringing and forced to think about his career from a young age.\n\nThis could have been the reason he chose to turn rebellious, marking another theme in the movie which is rebellion. Maybe he despised his wealth when he considered what he lost in terms of happy memories and because of that, decided to run his massive wealth into the ground by running a newspaper at a high cost.\n\nCinematography And Direction\n\nCitizen Kane was regarded as an innovative piece of auteur-powered filmmaking, revered for its unique take on cinematography.\n\nGregg Toland was in charge of cinematography and used many innovative techniques to drive the story of Citizen Kane forward, namely, deep focus, low angles, and innovative lighting techniques. Deep focus allowed certain scenes to have a strong clarity while low angles made actors look large and imposing on the camera because of the angle at which the camera was placed. The picture below is a great example of a low-angle shot.\n\nFinally, lighting techniques helped to lend a sense of mystique, especially to Kane. While all of these techniques are now common in the film industry, they were revolutionary at the time as they hadn’t been done before.\n\nAnother element that was considered unique at the time was the nonlinear style of storytelling. The film starts with a newsreel describing the life of Charles Foster Kane and the event of his death, and then immediately takes us to his childhood which is the chronological beginning of the movie.\n\nThe Final Take\n\nThe creative control Orson Welles had was unparalleled. He was the main actor, director, and writer of the film, making his film debut a classic piece of Auteur cinema. Although Orson Welles would go on to develop many films in the future, none stuck in the way that Citizen Kane did. The dialogue, story, cinematography, and acting make the film stand out as one of the best films in Hollywood.\n\nThe 1941 Academy Awards gave Best Picture to How Green Was My Valley, a romance film directed by John Ford. But Citizen Kane still impressed audiences at the time and is still revered and discussed today among film critics.\n\nLooking for top-rated Anime Gear?
