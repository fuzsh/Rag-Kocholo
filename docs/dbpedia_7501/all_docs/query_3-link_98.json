        "text": "Citizen Kane has so many beautiful stylistic qualities that enhance its viewing experience. With all the amazing costumes and lighting throughout the movie, its hard not to appreciate the aesthetic of the film. Orson Wells especially excels in the mise en scène department with his use of character blocking. Wells specifically uses the positioning and placement of each actor to display power. There are many scenes during the movie where Kane is actually not in control or the center of the universe. I will discuss these scenes in depth and analyze the ways in which character blocking is employed.\n\nThe image above is a still from early on in the film. This is the moment in the film where Kane’s mother is creating a trust fund for Kane after a gold mine was discovered on their property. Kane’s mother is also arranging to have Kane live with Thatcher so that he can be properly educated and live a better life. This still displays exactly who is in control and has the most influence/power. Although the whole scene is about Kane, his character has the least amount of control. Kane’s mother is actually the most powerful person in the scene, and her placement in relation to the camera emphasizes that. She is the most prominent in the shot, her face is the closest to the audience. Thatcher does not even try and converse with Kane’s father because he is just a bumbling idiot, which is why is placed far left side. Thatcher is the next most powerful character in the scene because he holds the future of Kane. Thatcher is placed closest to the center of the screen because of this importance, allowing the audience to almost always have a view of him. Lastly we have Kane himself, placed as far away as he possibly can while still being visible. Because Kane is still the focus of the scene, he is kept towards the center of the shot, but the audience, much like the characters themselves, can ignore him for the most part.\n\nThis still is from a scene that occurs much later in the film. This is the scene in which Kane’s affair with Susan is discovered by his political opponent and his wife. The same principals of power are being used with this character blocking. Emily is the most important character in this scene because his political opponent is discussing the consequences of continuing to run with her and not Kane. Emily might not be facing the camera and is off to the side, but she is the closest object to the screen to convey her importance. The political opponent also has a fair bit of control in this scene because he is the one black mailing Kane into dropping out of the race. He is not quite as close to the screen as Emily, but he is far closer than Susan and Kane. Throughout the scene Susan tries to explain the situation or interject with a point. Every time she does so, she also moves closer to the screen, displaying more power than even Kane. Similarly to the earlier scene, Kane is positioned farthest back, but also closest to the center. The scene revolves around Kane, but he is powerless.\n\nThis next still takes place right after the previous one. Emily and his opponent have finished their discussion and Emily agrees to have Kane drop out of the race. She then says goodnight to the opponent and tells Kane they are leaving. This moment is when Kane takes back power and control of the scene. He refuses to leave with Emily and refuses to back out of the race. He states, “There’s only one person in the world to decide what I’ll do. And that’s me.” Kane spent most of this scene hidden away in the back, but even without words the audience knows he has taken back control when he walks forward to the camera and positions himself dead center. Character blocking is used throughout the film for a number of stylistic and thematic purposes, but Welles’ use of it to display power is the most effective."
