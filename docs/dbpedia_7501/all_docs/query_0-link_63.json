Norton & Company has been independent since its founding in 1923, when William Warder Norton and Mary D. Herter Norton first published lectures delivered at the People’s Institute, the adult education division of New York City’s Cooper Union. The firm soon expanded its program beyond the Institute, publishing books by celebrated academics from America and abroad. By midcentury, the two major pillars of Norton’s publishing program—trade books and college texts—were firmly established. In the 1950s, the Norton family transferred control of the company to its employees, and today—with a staff of four hundred and a comparable number of trade, college, and professional titles published each year—W. W. Norton & Company stands as the largest and oldest publishing house owned wholly by its employees.\n\nThe publisher dedicates this edition to the memory of Jamie Vuignier (1967–2015) Copyright © 2016, 2004, 1996, 1990, 1981 by W.

They have come to occupy such a central position in our experience that it is unusual to pass even a single day without encountering them for an extended period of time, through either film or television. In short, moving photographic images have become part of the total environment of modern industrial society and, both materially and psychologically, have a shaping impact on our lives. Yet few of us have been taught to understand precisely how they work. Most of us, in fact, have extremely vague notions about how moving images are formed, and how they are structured to create the multitude of messages sent out to us by the audiovisual media on an almost continuous basis. If we made an analogy with verbal language, we would be forced to consider ourselves barely literate—able to assimilate the language form without fully comprehending it. We would, of course, be appalled to find ourselves living in a culture with a verbal literacy level of a three-year-old child. Most persons living with such limitations, like small children, would be easy prey to whoever could manipulate the language. They would be subject to the control of any entity that understood the language from the inside out and could therefore establish an authority of knowledge over them, just as verbally literate adults establish authority over children. Such a situation would be unthinkable in the modern industrial world, and our own culture has made it a priority to educate its children in the institutions of human speech, so that they can participate in the community of knowledge that verbal literacy sustains.\n\nImagine that a new language form came into being at the turn of the twentieth century—an audiovisual language form that first took the shape of cinema and then became, in time, the common currency of modern television. Imagine that because making statements in this language depends on an expensive industrial process, only a handful of elite specialists are trained to use it. Imagine that, although there was public anxiety about the potentially corrupting influence of the new language at its birth, it was perceived not as a language at all but as a medium of popular entertainment, and in this guise, the language has gradually colonized us as if it were the vernacular speech of some conquering foreign power. Finally, imagine waking up one day to discover that we had mistaken the language for a mode of dreaming, and in the process have become massively illiterate in what has turned into the primary language form, one that not only surrounds us materially but that, as language forms tend to do, also invades our minds. What would we do if that happened? We could choose to embrace our error and lapse into the anarchic mode of consciousness characteristic of preliterate societies, which might be fun but most certainly would be dangerous in an advanced industrial society. Or, we could attempt to instruct ourselves in the language form from ground up and from inside out. We could try to learn as much of its history, technology, and aesthetics as possible. We could trace the evolution of its syntactic and semantic forms from its birth through its present stages of development, and try to forecast the shapes it might take in the future. We could, finally, bring the apparatus of sequential logic and critical analysis to bear on the seemingly random\n\nxiii\n\nHISTNARR5_FM_i-xvii.indd xiii\n\n10/12/15 5:00 pm\n\nstructures of the language in order to read them in new and meaningful ways. This scenario conforms quite accurately, I believe, to our present situation in the modern world. The language of the moving photographic images has become so pervasive in our daily lives that we scarcely notice its presence. And yet, it does surround us, sending us messages, taking positions, making statements, and constantly redefining our relationship to material reality.\n\nxiv\n\nWe can choose to live in ignorance of its operations and be manipulated by those who control it. Or, we can teach ourselves to read it, appreciate its very real and manifold truths, and recognize its equally real and manifold deceptions. As a lifelong student and teacher of language forms, both verbal and audiovisual, I believe that most intelligent and humane persons in our culture will opt for the latter. It is for them that I have written this book.\n\nPREFACE\n\nHISTNARR5_FM_i-xvii.indd xiv\n\n10/12/15 5:00 pm\n\nPreface to the Fifth Edition\n\nI\n\nn the past decade, two trends have become abundantly clear—the persistence of blockbuster megapictures (or “tent poles”) that dominate the global market, and the renewed vitality of independent films, some of them art films. The advent of low-cost, high-end digital film equipment at the consumer level has meant that indie producers are no longer dependent on the technical resources of the majors. By the 2010s, thousands of small companies could produce films for a fraction of the cost of a Hollywood product. Postproduction was also rendered inexpensive by nonlinear editing software available for home computers. By 2005, about 15 percent of the U.S. domestic box office derived from independent films. In response to the digitization of production, distribution, and exhibition in the West, digital video increasingly became the medium of choice in the developing world. Recent developments in the cinemas of Nigeria, Turkey, Tunisia, and Romania testify to the increasing globalization of film beyond Hollywood’s force-feeding megapicture machine. This has been possible to a large extent because the technology of high-definition (HD) video has put the tools of classical Hollywood cinema into the hands of the world’s have-nots and disempowered, or at least those less powerful than America’s multinational media conglomerates. At the same time, American control of the world’s mass media has never been stronger. The American film industry in the early twenty-first century has become a crucible for the creation of franchises and brands that achieved nearly universal diffusion through the majors’ global distribution network. As film historian Stephen Prince puts it, “Understood in strict economic terms, production by the majors [is] about the manufacture and\n\ndistribution of commodities (not films) on a national and global scale.” Appropriately, the cover image of this edition is from Jean-Luc Godard’s 1996 film Made in U.S.A., which, in perfect irony, could not be shown in the United States until 2009 due to a threatened suit for copyright infringement. Moreover, by the mid-2010s, the United States had the great advantage of sustaining the largest home market for motion pictures in the world: with more than 40,000 screens, an all-time high, American audiences accounted for 44 percent of the global box office in 2014. This domestic market, saturated as it was, provided studios with an opportunity to amortize a film’s highest costs (those incurred in production) in the United States, and then derive pure profit from foreign and ancillary markets. Also by the mid-2010s, both mainstream and independent films had to grapple with the new economic and financial force of television. Increasingly, the vast majority of films that opened at the Sundance Film Festival and its counterparts found their audience not in a theater but on a video-on-demand system. This has meant a partial reconfiguration of film form toward the streaming nature of video.\n\nChanges in the Fifth Edition To improve the reader’s experience, the long lists of films in the previous editions have been moved to an extensive Filmography section online, which can be found at digital.wwnorton.com/narrativefilm5. Also moved online is the Selective Bibliography, while the lengthy footnotes that sometimes cluttered the text\n\nxv\n\nhave been deleted. Users of the Fifth Edition’s Ebook can find both the Filmography and the Selective Bibliography inside, after the Glossary. The design of the book has been similarly altered to provide fewer but bigger and bolder illustrations, now presented in a four-color format. A section on new Romanian cinema has been added to Chapter 16, as well as a section on digital 3-D to Chapter 21; information on various national cinemas has been updated through 2015; and finally, a new chapter (Chapter 22) has been added to address major developments since 2004, including the institutionalization of the megapicture, the rise of independent production and distribution, and the influence of video on both “slow cinema” and “long movies” (the frequently binge-watched formulations of serial television known as miniseries). Chapter 22 deals with new developments in the cinema of Nigeria, Turkey (including new material on Nuri Bilge Ceylan), and Thailand (including new material on Apichatpong Weerasethakul), as well as the rise and fall of “torture porn” and the advent of new auteurs in Hollywood— especially those specializing in dramatic comedy, or “dramedy,” such as David O. Russell, Spike Jonze, Alexander Payne, Wes Anderson, Richard Linklater, and Paul Thomas Anderson; and others, such as David Fincher, Steven Soderbergh, Joel and Ethan Cohen, and Christopher Nolan. Special attention also is paid to the work of Kathryn Bigelow, Sofia Coppola, Spike Lee, and Steve McQueen. While it is clear that Hollywood megapictures will continue to dominate the world’s theater screens, it is equally clear that motion pictures are no longer primarily consumed on theatrical screens. Mobile, online, and streaming consumption of motion pictures is increasingly common and tends to liberate the cinema from the blockbuster syndrome in the direction of independence. But the more things change, the more they stay the same: cinema is still fundamentally a narrative art whose major purpose is the telling of stories, and storytelling precedes every other form of organized human behavior but the burial of the dead. Its roots lie deep in our consciousness and preconsciousness, and its importance to us will not go away easily. So as the screens grow smaller, the importance of cinema looms ever larger, telling stories of valor and heroism, war and peace, and love and loss, as it always has done and will continue to do until narrative loses its fundamental place in our hierarchy of values.\n\nxvi\n\nOn Method For reasons that will become apparent in the course of this book, I believe that the history of film as we have experienced it to date is the history of a narrative form. Many of the greatest films ever made were created by artists seeking to break the constraints of this form as it is defined at different points in time, and there is much evidence to suggest that since the 1960s, cinema has been moving in an increasingly nonnarrative direction. But the fact remains, the language common to the international cinema from the last decade of the nineteenth century to the present has been narrative, both in aspiration and structural forms. For this reason, I have excluded documentary cinema, animated cinema, and the experimental avant-garde from consideration in this book, except when they have influenced narrative form to a demonstrable and significant degree. This is not to suggest that any of these forms is unimportant, but rather that each is important and distinctive enough to warrant a separate history of its own (many of which, in fact, already exist).\n\nOn Dates, Titles, and Illustrations Wherever possible, the date given for a film is the year of its theatrical release in its country of origin. Unless otherwise noted (as in the case of intermittent production or delayed release), the reader may assume a lapse of four to six months between the start of production and the date of release for features. This is important in correlating the history of film with the history of human events—for instance, many American films with the release date of 1942 went into production and were completed before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. As for the titles of films in languages other than English, those in French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and German are given in the original language, followed (in parentheses) by a literal English translation, and an alternate English-language release title, if one exists. After the initial reference, the original foreign-language title is used, except in the case of a film that is best known in the English-speaking world by its English title—for example, Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless (À bout de souffle, 1959). For Scandinavian, Eastern European, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African\n\nPREFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION\n\nHISTNARR5_FM_i-xvii.indd xvi\n\n10/12/15 5:00 pm\n\nlanguages, the convention is reversed: the initial reference is given in English, followed by the original title in parentheses (a transliteration is supplied if the original title is in an alphabet other than our own). All subsequent references use the English title, unless the film is best known by its foreign-language title—for instance, Akira Kurosawa’s Ikiru (Living/To Live, 1952) and Yojimbo (The Bodyguard, 1961). In the case of films for which the original foreign-language title is unavailable, only the English title is given. The photographs used to illustrate the book represent a combination of production stills and DVD frame grabs. Production stills, since they are taken on the set by professional photographers, yield a higher quality of reproduction; but since they are made initially for the purpose of publicity, they are sometimes “beautified” to the point of distortion. Frame grabs, on the other hand, are taken digitally from the films themselves and, therefore, represent the actual images as composed and shot by the filmmakers. Their quality of reproduction is often lower than that of production stills, since several extra steps of transference are involved in printing\n\nthem, but their correspondence with the film images is exact. I have tried to use frame grabs whenever shot sequences have been reproduced for discussion or when lengthy analysis accompanies an individual image or series of images. I have used production stills when less analytical procedures are involved. (Many films of the 1950s and most films of subsequent eras were shot in some type of widescreen process, with aspect ratios varying from 2.55:1 to 1.85:1. For reasons of typography and design, a few of the stills from such films in this volume have been reproduced in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio of the Academy frame.) Although photographs can never replicate cinema, lacking as they do the essential component of motion, they can be made to represent it. Throughout the book, I have attempted to integrate the stills with the written text in a manner that provides for maximum delivery of information. The reader is, therefore, encouraged to regard both photographic and verbal information as part of the same critical fabric, although neither, ultimately, can substitute for the audiovisual information contained in the films themselves.\n\nPREFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION\n\nHISTNARR5_FM_i-xvii.indd xvii\n\nxvii\n\n10/12/15 5:00 pm\n\nA la conquête de l’air (Conquest of the Skies; Ferdinand Zecca, 1901).\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 2\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\n01 Origins Optical Principles The beginning of film history is the end of something else: the successive stages of technological development during the nineteenth century, whereby simple optical devices used for entertainment grew into sophisticated machines that could convincingly represent empirical reality in motion. Both toys and machines depended on interactive optical phenomena known as persistence of vision and the phi phenomenon for their illusions. The former is a characteristic of human perception, known to the ancient Egyptians but first described scientifically by Peter Mark Roget in 1824, whereby the brain retains images cast on the retina of the eye for approximately onetwentieth to one-fifth of a second beyond their actual removal from the field of vision. The latter, whose operation was discovered by the Gestalt psychologist Max Wertheimer in 1912, is the phenomenon that causes us to see the individual blades of a rotating fan as a unitary circular form or the different hues of a spinning color wheel as a single homogeneous color. Together, persistence of vision and the phi phenomenon allow us to see a succession of static images as a single unbroken movement and permit the illusion of continuous motion on which cinematography is based. Persistence of vision prevents us from seeing the dark spaces between the film frames by causing “flicker fusion,” when the frequency with which the projection light is broken approaches fifty times per second. Without this effect, our eyes would perceive the alternation of light and dark on the\n\n3\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 3\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\nscreen as each projected image succeeded the next, as in fact was the case in the earliest days of the movies. Films became known colloquially as “flickers” or “flicks” for this very reason. The phi phenomenon, also known as the “stroboscopic effect,” creates apparent movement from frame to frame at optimal projection speeds of 12 to 24 frames per second (fps). This much is known, but perceptual psychologists still understand very little about the neural and cognitive processes involved in the perception of motion. The frames of a strip of film are a series of individual still photographs that the motion-picture camera, as it was perfected by the Edison Laboratories in 1892 and as it exists today, imprints one at a time. The succession of frames recorded in the camera, when projected at the same or a similar speed, creates the illusion of continuous motion essential to the cinema. Most motion-picture cameras today expose individual frames at the rate of 24 per second. The illusion of continuous motion can be induced in our brains at rates as low as 12 fps, yet speeds have traditionally been set at about 16 fps for silent film and 24 for sound. On the film strip itself, these frames are separated by thin, unexposed frame lines, but in projection a rotating shutter opens and closes to obscure the intervals between frames and to permit each frame to be flashed on the screen twice, thereby eliminating the flicker we would otherwise perceive by their movement. When we “watch” a film in a theater, we actually spend as much as 50 percent of the time in darkness, with the projector’s shutter closed and nothing before us on the screen, whether the film is digitized or not. Thus, the continuity of movement and light that seems to be the most palpable quality of the cinema exists only in our brains. Persistence of vision and the phi phenomenon were exploited for the purpose of optical entertainment for many years before the invention of photography. A popular child’s toy of the early nineteenth century was the Thaumatrope (from the Greek for “magical turning”), a paper disk with strings attached at opposite points on the perimeter so that it could be twirled between finger and thumb. A different image was imprinted on each face, and when the disk was spun the images seemed to merge into a single unified picture (a rider would mount a horse, a parrot enter its cage, and so on). Between 1832 and 1850, hundreds of optical toys were manufactured that used rotating “phase drawings” of things in motion to produce a crude form of animation. Drawings representing successive phases of an action would be mounted on a disk or a cylinder 4\n\nCHAPTER 01\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 4\n\nGeorge Horner’s Zoetrope.\n\nand rotated in conjunction with some type of shutter apparatus (usually a series of slots in the disk or the cylinder itself ) to produce the illusion of motion. Joseph Plateau’s Phenakistoscope (from the Greek for “deceitful view,” 1832) and George Horner’s Zoetrope (“live turning,” 1834) were among the most popular of these toys, which reached increasing stages of refinement as the century progressed. When still photography was invented by LouisJacques-Mandé Daguerre (1787–1851) in 1839 and perfected during the next decade, it was a relatively simple step to replace the phase drawings in the motion-simulation devices with individually posed “phase photographs,” as Plateau began to do in 1849. At this point, live action could be simulated photographically but not recorded spontaneously and simultaneously as it occurred. This required the drastic reduction in photographic exposure time from fifteen minutes to one one-thousandth of a second that was achieved between 1876 and 1881 by the replacement of collodion wet plates with gelatin dry plates and by the introduction of “series photography” by the Anglo-American photographer Eadweard Muybridge (1830–1904).\n\nORIGINS\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\nSeries Photography In 1872, Muybridge was hired by Leland Stanford (1824–1893), a former California governor and wealthy businessman, to prove that at some point in its gallop, a racehorse lifts all four hooves off the ground (a convention of nineteenth-century graphic illustration required running horses to always be pictured with at least one foot on the ground). After several years of abortive experiments, Muybridge accomplished this in the summer of 1877 by setting up a battery of twelve electrically operated cameras (later studies used twenty-four) along a Sacramento racetrack and stretching wires across it that would trip the cameras’ shutters. As a horse came down the track, its hooves tripped each shutter individually and caused the cameras to photograph it in successive stages of motion during the gallop.\n\nMuybridge demonstrated his results in 1879 on a mechanism he called the zoopraxiscope. This special kind of “magic lantern” projected colored, handdrawn images that were based on these photographs and placed along the outer rim of a circular glass disk. (The optical, or magic, lantern was a simple projection device invented in the seventeenth century, consisting of a light source and a magnifying lens; it enjoyed great popularity as a projector of still transparencies during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and became a major component in subsequent motionpicture projection.) Muybridge devoted the rest of his life to refining his process of series photography, but he was not “the man who invented moving pictures,” as a recent biography proclaims. He recorded live action continuously for the first time in history, but he did so with a series of twelve or more cameras. Until the separate functions of these machines could be incorporated into a single instrument, the cinema could not be born.\n\nEadweard Muybridge’s glass-plate series photographs.\n\nSERIES PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 5\n\n5\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\n”The Flight of a Heron”: images from Étienne-Jules Marey’s chronophotographic gun.\n\nEmulsion images from Thomas Edison’s “Record of a Sneeze” (or “Fred Ott’s Sneeze”; 1894).\n\n6\n\nCHAPTER 01\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 6\n\nIt was the French physiologist Étienne-Jules Marey (1830–1904) who recorded the first series photographs of live action in a single camera, which, as it happens, was also portable. Marey, a specialist in animal locomotion, invented the “chronophotographic gun” in 1882 to take series pictures of birds in flight. This instrument, a camera shaped like a rifle, took twelve instantaneous photographs of a movement per second and imprinted them on a rotating glass plate. A year later, Marey switched from the cumbersome plates to paper roll film, which had the effect of introducing the film strip to cinematography. Yet like most of his contemporaries, Marey was not interested in cinematography as such. In his view, he had invented a machine for the dissection of motion similar to Muybridge’s apparatus, but more flexible, and never intended to project his results. The next step was taken in 1887 in Newark, New Jersey, when an Episcopalian minister named Hannibal Goodwin (1822–1900) first used celluloid roll film as a base for light-sensitive emulsions. Goodwin’s idea was appropriated by the American entrepreneur George Eastman (1854–1932), who in 1889 began to mass-produce and market celluloid roll film on what would soon become an international scale. Neither Goodwin nor Eastman was initially interested in motion pictures, but it was the introduction of a plastic recording medium (in the generic sense of both durable and flexible), coupled with the technical breakthroughs of Muybridge and Marey, that enabled the Edison Laboratories in West Orange, New Jersey, to invent the Kinetograph, the first true motion-picture camera.\n\nORIGINS\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\nMotion Pictures Like his predecessors, Thomas Alva Edison (1847–1931) was not interested in cinematography in and of itself. Rather, he wished to provide a visual accompaniment for his vastly successful phonograph, and in June 1889, he assigned a young laboratory assistant named William Kennedy Laurie Dickson (1860–1935) to help him develop a motion-picture camera for that purpose. Edison, in fact, envisioned a kind of “coin-operated entertainment machine,” in which motion pictures made by the Kinetograph would illustrate the sound from the phonograph. Dickson “invented” the first motion-picture camera in a brilliant synthesis of already existing principles and techniques that he had learned from studying the work of Muybridge, Marey, and others. After some ineffectual attempts to record photographic images microscopically on phonographlike cylinders, Dickson began to experiment with the use of celluloid roll film in a battery-driven camera similar to Marey’s chronophotographic gun, and he arrived at the Kinetograph in late 1891. The machine incorporated what have come to be recognized as the two essentials of motion-picture camera and projector engineering: (1) a stop-motion device to ensure the intermittent but regular motion of the film strip through the camera, and (2) a perforated celluloid film strip consisting of four sprocket holes on the bottom edge of each frame. The former, adapted by Dickson from the escapement mechanism of a watch, permits the unexposed film strip, in its rapid transit through the camera, to be stopped for a fraction of a second before the lens while the shutter opens to admit light from the photographed object and expose the individual frames. In projection, the process is exactly reversed: each frame, now developed, is held intermittently before the projection lamp while the shutter opens to emit light through the lens and project the film image onto the screen. Without a stop-motion device in both camera and projector, the film image would blur. The synchronization of film strip and shutter (which ensures the exact regularity of this discontinuous movement) and the synchronization of the camera and the projector are accomplished by means of the regular perforations in the film strip—inspired by the perforated paper of the Edison automatic telegraph—which is pulled through both machines by a system of clawed gears.\n\nFrames from Rescued by Rover (Cecil Hepworth, 1905), illustrating sprocket holes.\n\nMOTION PICTURES\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 7\n\n7\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\nYet Edison was not interested in projection. He mistakenly believed that the future of moving pictures lay in individual exhibition, so he commissioned Dickson to perfect the small viewing machine he had already designed for private use in the laboratory. The first moving pictures recorded in the Kinetograph were viewed by the public individually through the magnifying lens of a boxlike peep-show machine, in which a continuous 40- to 50-foot film loop ran on spools between an electric lamp and a shutter. This device was dubbed the Kinetoscope. True to Edison’s original intention, Dickson had attempted to design both viewer and camera so that sound and image could be synchronized and recorded simultaneously. Yet, in fact, accurate synchronization proved impossible, and the very few Kinetoscope films made with sound (called “Kinetophones”) employed asynchronous musical accompaniment. Furthermore, when speculative emphasis shifted to projection a few years later, the reproduction of sound became doubly infeasible because there was as yet no means of amplifying it for a large audience. Edison applied for patents on his new machines in 1891 but decided against paying the extra $150\n\nto secure an international copyright, realizing that the Europeans had done so much of the essential mechanical invention of the apparatus that patent claims against them would not hold up. Soon after patents were granted in 1893, Edison began to market Kinetoscopes through several companies. On April 14, 1894, a Canadian entrepreneur named Andrew Holland opened the first Kinetoscope parlor in a converted shoe store at 1155 Broadway in New York City. Holland charged twenty-five cents per person for access to a row of five Edison peep-show viewers, each of which contained a single film loop shot with the Kinetograph. Others followed his lead, and soon Kinetoscope parlors were opened across the country, all supplied with 50-foot shorts produced for them exclusively by the Edison Company’s West Orange studio at the rate of $10 to $15 outright per print. This first motion-picture studio had been constructed by Dickson in 1893 for a little more than $600. Called the “Black Maria” (after contemporary slang for what was later known as a “paddy wagon”) because it was covered with protective tar-paper strips, Dickson’s studio was a single room measuring about 25 by 30 feet. A section of its roof could be opened to admit\n\nThomas Edison’s Kinetoscope.\n\n8\n\nCHAPTER 01\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 8\n\nORIGINS\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\nWilliam Kennedy Laurie Dickson’s studio “Black Maria” (c. 1893).\n\nthe sunlight—then the cinema’s only effective lighting source—and the whole building could be rotated on a circular track to follow the sun’s course across the sky. Here, from 1893 to April 1895, Dickson was the producer, director, and cameraman for hundreds of brief films distributed by the Edison Company to the Kinetoscope parlors. These first films seem extremely primitive today, in both content and form. The 50-foot maximum format (approximately 16 seconds at a speed of 40 fps; 60 seconds at the later standard rate of 16 fps) was not conducive to the construction of narratives but was eminently suitable for recording quick vaudeville turns, slapstick comedy skits, and other kinds of brief performance. Taken together, the earliest Kinetoscope shorts preserve a series of standard theatrical routines whose only requisite content is motion. Structurally, the films are even cruder, consisting of continuous unedited footage of what occurred in front of the lens of Dickson’s stationary camera. This stasis was partly the result of technological limitations—especially the small enclosure of the Black Maria studio and the cumbersomeness of the Kinetograph, which resembled a small icebox in shape and size and initially weighed more than 500 pounds. At this point in the history of film, the camera was never permitted to record more\n\nthan could be seen by a single individual standing in one fixed spot and focusing on a single event for a given length of time.\n\nProjection: Europe and America Eadweard Muybridge’s well-publicized presentations of his zoopraxiscope (in both Europe and America) during the 1880s did much to stimulate interest in perfecting the projection of a series of photographs. The basic requirements of projection engineering were (1) the enlargement of the images for simultaneous viewing by large groups and (2) a means of ensuring the regular but intermittent motion of the developed film strip as it passed between the projection lamp and the shutter (which would correspond with the discontinuous movement of the strip through the camera). The first requirement was easily and rapidly met by applying the principle of magic-lantern projection to film; the second proved more difficult, but was eventually fulfilled by the Maltese-cross system used in most projectors today.\n\nPROJECTION: EUROPE AND AMERICA\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 9\n\n9\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\nA.\n\nB. Pin\n\nDiagram of the Maltese-cross gear.\n\nThe Maltese-cross system was perfected by the German film pioneer Oskar Messter (1866–1943). As indicated by the diagram, it has two basic parts: (A) a gear in the shape of a Maltese cross connected directly to the sprocket wheels that pull the film through the projector, and (B) a circular disk attached to the projector’s drive mechanism, which carries a metal pin at its outer edge. The disk rotates continuously, and the pin is located so that it enters one slot of the cross per cycle and propels it through a quarter of a revolution, but when the disk makes contact again with the edge of the cross itself, the gear is tightly locked until the pin rotates around to the next slot. This ensures the regular stop-and-go motion of the film strip through the projector. It was actually the year 1895 that witnessed the most significant developments in projection technology, and these occurred almost simultaneously in every country in Western Europe and in the United States. By far the most important of these devices was perfected by two brothers, Auguste and Louis Lumière (1862–1954 and 1864–1948, respectively), who operated a factory for the manufacture of photographic equipment in Lyons, France—and whose family name was, appropriately, the French word for “light.” After a thorough study of the workings of the Edison machine, the Lumières invented an apparatus that could serve as camera, projector, and film printer and that was finally patented as the Cinématographe, thus coining the term that attaches to the medium of film to this day. The Cinématographe was built to run at a speed of 16 fps and established the standard for silent film. On December 28, 1895, the Lumières rented a basement room in the Grand Café, on the Boulevard des Capucines in Paris, to project a program of ten films for the first time to a paying audience. Some of the titles 10\n\nCHAPTER 01\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 10\n\nfrom that program were L’arrivée d’un train en gare de La Ciotat (Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station), which dramatically marked the beginning of the cinema’s long obsession with the Industrial Revolution; Déjeuner de bébé (Baby’s Lunch), Louis’s record of brother Auguste feeding his infant daughter; and L’arroseur arrosé (The Sprinkler Sprinkled), a bit of slapstick in which a young boy steps on a hose, which then squirts a gardener in the face when he peers at the nozzle. L’arrivée was a visual tour de force, and audiences are said to have dodged aside at the sight of the locomotive barreling toward them into the foreground on the screen. Due to its relative lightness, the Cinématographe could be taken out of doors more easily than the Kinetograph, and for this reason the early Lumière films have a much higher documentary content than do Edison’s (the Lumières called their films “actualités,” or documentary views). Structurally, however, the earliest Lumière and Edison films are precisely the same—the camera and the point of view are static (except when moved functionally, to reframe action) and the action continuous from beginning to end, as if editing “reality” was unthinkable to their makers. Admission to the Lumière program was 1 franc per customer, and the receipts for the first day totaled only 35 francs. Yet within a month, the Cinématographe showings were earning an average of 7,000 francs a week, and motion pictures had become, overnight, an extremely lucrative commercial enterprise. The most important aspect of the Cinématographe projections, however, was that they marked the end of the period of technological experimentation that had begun with Muybridge’s series photography in 1877: the two machines on which the cinema was founded had been perfected at last. In Germany, the Skladanowsky brothers, Max and Emil (1863–1939 and 1859–1945, respectively), developed almost simultaneously with the Lumières a projector for celluloid film strips called the “Bioskop” or Bioscope (a common term for many early cameras and projectors) and projected films of their own making in a public performance at the Berlin Wintergarten on November 1, 1895. Projection reached England immediately thereafter, in 1896, when a manufacturer of scientific instruments named Robert W. Paul (1869– 1943) patented the Theatrograph (later renamed the Animatograph), a projector based on the Kinetoscope— although the Lumière Cinématographe was soon to capture both the British and the Continental markets.

In September of that year, however, Edison learned that two aspiring inventors, C. Francis Jenkins (1867–1934) and Thomas Armat (1866–1948), had projected a program of Kinetograph shorts at the Cotton States Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia, with an electrically powered machine that incorporated a stop-motion mechanism superior to anything then under patent. Their projector also made use of a small but extremely important device employed earlier in the year by the Latham family (brothers Gray and Otway, along with their father, Woodville). The Lathams, who had made money showing fight films with Edison’s Kinetoscope, formed the Lambda Company to make motion pictures of prize fights and other sporting events and then project these on the screen. Their contribution, the Latham loop, merits special consideration here. One chief practical problem of early motion-picture production and exhibition was that of film breakage. At lengths greater than 50 to 100 feet, the inertia of the 12\n\nCHAPTER 01\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 12\n\ntake-up reel would frequently cause the film strip to tear or snap in the projector. Assisted by the engineerinventors Enoch Rector and Eugène Augustin Lauste, the Lathams had discovered that by placing a small loop in the film strip just above and below the projection lens and maintaining it with an extra set of sprockets, the stress could be redistributed in such a manner as to permit films of greater length in the magazine. Edison was so impressed with the features of Armat’s machine that he abandoned his own research project and bought the apparatus outright under a scandalous agreement whereby he himself would manufacture it and take full credit for its invention, while Armat would be allowed a small plate on the back crediting him with “design.” Edison dubbed the new machine the Vitascope and gave it its first public exhibition on April 23, 1896, at the popular Koster and Bial’s Music Hall in New York City, where it received top billing as “Edison’s greatest marvel.” Like their predecessors, Edison’s Vitascope films offered nothing more than unmediated glimpses of real action as it unfolded before the camera from a single point of view, but these rather crude “living pictures,” as they were soon labeled, proved novel and engaging enough to satisfy the public’s taste for several years to come. After all, the world had never seen their like before.\n\nORIGINS\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\nFor example, a writer for La Poste commented on the Cinématographe projections of December 28, 1895: The beauty of the invention resides in the novelty and ingenuity of the apparatus. When these apparatuses are made available to the public, everybody will be able to photograph those who are dear to them, no longer as static forms but with their movements, their actions, their familiar gestures, capturing the speech on their very lips. Then, death will no longer be absolute.\n\nThe original audiences for motion pictures did not perceive them as we do—as a succession of images linked together in a continuity of meaning—but rather as a series of discontinuous “animated photographs.” Conditioned by lantern slide shows, comic strips, and other serial presentations of images, these audiences saw individual scenes as self-contained and did not infer meaning from one scene to the next. The shift in consciousness from films as animated photographs to films as continuous narratives began around the turn of the century. The Vitascope and Cinématographe projections mark the culmination of the cinema’s prehistory. By 1896, all of the basic technological principles of film recording and projection had been discovered and\n\nThe Latham loop, redrawn from Thomas Armat’s 1901 patent application.\n\nincorporated into existing machines—which, with certain obvious exceptions, such as the introduction of light-sensitive sound, have remained essentially unchanged from that day to this. Thus, the history of cinema as an art form begins, for if our understanding of the machines was sophisticated, knowledge of how to use them was primitive indeed. Nevertheless, by the late 1890s, cinema was already on its way toward becoming a mass medium with the then-unimaginable power to communicate without print or speech.\n\nThe Evolution of Narrative: Georges Méliès During the 1890s, near the end of the decade, exhibitors often created multishot narratives that focused on such subjects as a fire rescue or the Spanish-American War. The showmen developed these stories by purchasing various one-shot films from production companies, then putting them in an order and delivering a narration, often combined with sound effects and lantern slides. Creative responsibility was thus divided between producer and exhibitor. By the turn of the century, however, producers were beginning to assume this editorial responsibility by making multishot films on their own. In the process, filmmakers took more control of the narrative, allowing for greater specificity in the story line. In many respects, therefore, producers began to resemble modern-day filmmakers. Such a development is most clearly apparent in the work of Georges Méliès (1861–1938), a professional magician who owned and operated the Théâtre RobertHoudin in Paris. Méliès had been using magic-lantern projections in his conjuring acts for years, and when he attended the first Cinématographe programs in 1895, he immediately recognized the vast illusionist possibilities of the “living pictures.” Accordingly, in early 1896, he bought an Animatograph projector from the English inventor Robert W. Paul for 1,000 francs and simply reversed its mechanical principle to design his own camera, which was constructed for him by the instrument maker Lucien Korsten. By April 1896, Méliès was showing his own productions in his own theater. In time, he would become the cinema’s first important narrative artist as well, but not before he had done some apprentice work in the manner of the Lumières and Edison by filming a series of actualités, comic episodes, and staged conjurer’s tricks for projection in his theater.\n\nTHE EVOLUTION OF NARRATIVE: GEORGES MÉLIÈS\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 13\n\n13\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\nAccording to Méliès’s memoirs, one afternoon in the fall of 1896, while he was filming a Parisian street scene, his camera jammed in the process of recording an omnibus as it emerged from a tunnel. When he got the machine working again, a funeral hearse had replaced the omnibus, so that in projection the omnibus seemed to change into the hearse. By this accident, Méliès came to recognize the possibilities of manipulating real time and real space inherent in the editing of exposed film. Although he went on to make hundreds of delightful narrative films, his model for them was the narrative mode of the legitimate theater, because it was what he knew best. That is, he conceived all of his films in terms of dramatic scenes played out from beginning to end, rather than in terms of shots, or individual visual perspectives on a scene. The only editing, therefore, aside from that used in optical illusions of disappearance and conversion, occurs between scenes, rather than within them. The scenes themselves are composed of single shots, taken with a motionless camera from a fixed point of view, that of a theater spectator sitting in the orchestra center aisle with an excellent eye-level view of the action, and the actors move across the film frame from left to right or right to left as if it were the proscenium arch of a stage. Normally, a viewer experiences no more narrative manipulation within a Méliès film than in watching a stage play of the same action; one sees a significant amount of stage illusion, of course, but changes in time and space coincide precisely with changes in scene, and the narrative point of view is rigidly static. Méliès was nevertheless the cinema’s first narrative artist. By adapting certain techniques of still photography, theater spectacle, and magic-lantern projection to the linear medium of the film strip, he innovated significant narrative devices such as the fade-in; the fade-out; the overlapping, or “lap,” dissolve; and stopmotion photography. To put his discoveries into effect, Méliès, in late 1896, organized the Star Film Company, and by the spring of 1897, he had constructed a small production studio on the grounds of his house in the Paris suburb of Montreuil. The building measured 55 by 20 feet and was glass-enclosed like a greenhouse to admit maximum sunlight, the cinema’s only effective lighting source until mercury-vapor lamps came into general use around 1907. Here Méliès produced, directed, photographed, and acted in some five hundred films between 1897 and 1913, when, like so many other film pioneers, he was forced out of business by his competitors because he had lost touch with 14\n\nCHAPTER 01\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 14\n\nthe rapid development of both the medium and the industry. His early work consisted of short “trick films,” by and large, whose impact depended on a single special effect, usually accomplished through photographic double exposure or superimposition. Soon longer films, approximately one reel in length, began to appear—for example, A Trip to the Moon (1902) and The Palace of the Arabian Nights (1905)—and by middecade Méliès was fully committed to narrative until the end of his career. Although he also made many films based on historical and contemporary events, Méliès’s most memorable productions concern the fantastic and the bizarre and are acted out before lush phantasmagoric backgrounds that he himself designed and painted. Many were released in color, because at the height of his very substantial success Méliès employed twenty-one women at the studio of Madame Tuillier to hand-tint his films individually, frame by frame. Although Méliès went bankrupt in 1923, due to his ruin at the hands of Pathé Frères and other rivals, his films had immense popular appeal at the turn of the century. Indeed, by 1902, Star Film had become one of the world’s largest suppliers of motion pictures, with offices in New York, London, Barcelona, and Berlin, and had nearly driven the Lumières out of production. By far the most successful and influential film Méliès made at Montreuil was Le voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the Moon). Produced in 1902, this film achieved international circulation within months of its completion, albeit through the unethical distribution of “dupes” by rival concerns as much as through Méliès’s own sales. Le voyage dans la lune, loosely adapted by Méliès from the Jules Verne novel of the same title, was 825 feet long (a little under 14 minutes at the average silent speed of 16 fps), or three times the average length of the contemporary Edison and Lumière products (one of Méliès’s achievements was increasing the standard length of fiction films). Utterly characteristic of both the strengths and the weaknesses of Méliès’s theatrical narrative mode, the film is composed of thirty separate scenes, which he appropriately called “tableaux,” all photographed from the same angle and connected by means of lap dissolves. The whole film very much resembles a photographed stage play, save for the inclusion of some of the optical tricks that were a Méliès trademark—the product of nineteenth-century stage illusion, pure and simple—and that serve to illustrate how very far Méliès really was from tapping the full narrative potential of the medium. The classic example of Méliès’s lack of\n\nORIGINS\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\nInterior of Georges Méliès’s studio at Montreuil.\n\nvision in this respect is that when he wished to show the astronomers’ projectile crashing dramatically into the face of the moon, he moved the papier-mâché moon on a dolly into the lens of the camera, rather than moving the camera into the moon—even though, as a practical matter, moving the camera would have been far simpler. Méliès, in fact, never moved his camera once in any of his more than five hundred films. Neither did he alternate the point of view within scenes or even between them by changing camera angles. His films were, as he once called them, “artificially arranged scenes,” or “moving tableaux,” and his camera functioned as the inert eye of a theater spectator from the beginning to the end of his career. Viewed today, these early films are bound to seem primitive because cinema is for us a highly integrated\n\nnarrative form. (In fact, primitive cinema is the term used by film historians—not in a pejorative sense—to describe the medium from the invention of its first machines to about 1910.) There is an increasing body of opinion, however, that their original audiences experienced these films very differently than we do—as a kind of performative spectacle, or “attraction,” whose function was to present, rather than to represent, to show, rather than to narrate. Film scholar Tom Gunning has called this phenomenon the “cinema of attractions” and suggests that it dominated the medium’s first decade (1895– 1906), after which the story film became dominant and the presentational mode went underground to become an important element of avant-garde cinema and certain narrative genres (e.g., the musical, science\n\nTHE EVOLUTION OF NARRATIVE: GEORGES MÉLIÈS\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 15\n\n15\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\nFrames from Le voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the Moon; Georges Méliès, 1902).\n\nfiction). In its earliest form, the cinema of attractions drew audiences to the technological display of its projection apparatus (the Vitascope was “Edison’s greatest marvel,” and so on) and, on-screen, solicited their attention by “direct address”—that is, the recurring look of the actors at the camera—or some other form of direct stimulation. In this view, to look for narrative continuity in such early films—even such clearly plotted ones as Le voyage dans la lune—is to miss the point that for filmmakers and audiences alike, early cinema was conceived as a series of displays providing spectatorial pleasure through all of the objects, views, and events it could show, whether fictional or documentary and whether in story form or not. This perspective has the distinct advantage of refusing to blame early cinema for what it was not—a stuttered and inarticulate version of what cinema would become during its so-called classical period, from the 1910s through the 1950s, or what we regard as its even more advanced state today. 16\n\nCHAPTER 01\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 16\n\nMéliès discovered, if he did not exploit, the enormous potential inherent in the editing of exposed film, and through his influence on contemporary filmmakers he pointed the cinema well on its way toward becoming an essentially narrative, rather than a documentary, medium, as Edison and Lumière cameramen had originally conceived it. Furthermore, Méliès was an artist of unique and individual talent, and his films endure every bit as much for their distinctive imaginative power as for their contributions to cinematic form. He had stumbled into the narrative dimensions of the cinema very much as cinema had stumbled into being—arbitrarily, almost by accident—and he appropriated a conventional and unimaginative narrative model because it was what he knew best; yet those who came after him would understand. Charlie Chaplin called him “the alchemist of light,” but D. W. Griffith, at the end of his own monumental career in 1932, put it best when he said of Méliès, “I owe him everything.”\n\nORIGINS\n\n23/11/15 11:20 AM\n\nEdwin S. Porter: Developing a Concept of Continuity Editing Méliès ultimately lost his audience to the practitioners of a more sophisticated narrative style, the origins of which are closely associated with the work of Edwin S. Porter (1870–1941). Porter had worked as a Vitascope projectionist in 1896, helping to set up the landmark Koster and Bial’s projection of April 23, and he subsequently operated his own equipment in such mainline theaters as the Eden Musée in New York City. In 1900, Porter joined the Edison Manufacturing Company as a mechanic and, in early 1901, he became production head of its new skylight studio on East Twenty-First Street, where for the next few years he served as director/cameraman for much of the company’s output. His first films were one-shot skits and actualités and brief multiscene narratives based on political cartoons and contemporary events. Porter also filmed the extraordinary Pan-American Exposition by Night (1901), which used time-lapse photography to create a circular panorama of the illuminated fairgrounds, by modifying his camera to expose a single frame every ten seconds. By 1901, Porter had encountered the films of Méliès and those of the two British pioneers, George Albert Smith (1864–1959) and James Williamson (1855–1933). Smith, a portrait photographer, and Williamson, a lanternist, had constructed their own motion-picture cameras and, between 1896 and 1898, had begun to produce trick films featuring superimpositions and interpolated close-ups (Grandma’s Reading Glass [Smith, 1900]; The Big Swallow [Williamson, 1901]). Smith would later develop the first commercially successful photographic color process (Kinemacolor, c. 1906–1908, with Charles Urban), while Williamson apparently experimented with intercutting between the interior and the exterior of a building as early as 1901 in Fire!—a film that decisively influenced the structure and content of Porter’s Life of an American Fireman (1903). By 1902, both Smith and Williamson had built studios in their native Brighton and, with their associates, came to be known as members of the “Brighton school,” although they did not really constitute the coherent movement that such a term implies. Yet it seems certain that Porter saw some of the earlier Brighton work, because it was occasionally sold by Edison, and also he may have seen that of the Yorkshire-based filmmakers James Bamforth (The Kiss in the Tunnel, 1899), who produced films with the Riley\n\nbrothers of Bradford under the banner of RAB (Riley and Bamforth), and Frank Mottershaw of the Sheffield Photo Company (A Daring Daylight Robbery, 1903). However, it may have been Porter’s experience as a projectionist at the Eden Musée in the late 1890s that led him to the practice of continuity editing in the period from 1901 to 1903. As he moved from exhibition to production, Porter began to apply many of the editorial skills he had learned to filmmaking. He was also clearly influenced by Méliès’s story films. Thus, Jack and the Beanstalk (1902) shows a strong debt to Méliès’s Bluebeard (1902). By his own admission, Porter was powerfully influenced by Méliès’s A Trip to the Moon (1902), which he came to know well in the process of duplicating it for distribution (again, illegally) by Edison in October 1902. Years later, he claimed that it was the Méliès film that had given him the idea for “telling a story in continuity form,” which resulted in Life of an American Fireman, produced in late 1902 and released in January 1903. The subject of this film—the dramatic rescue of a woman and child from a burning building by firemen— was a popular one, having been featured in lantern slide shows and other films many years previously. What was unusual was Porter’s idea of combining stock footage from the Edison archive with staged scenes of the rescue to create a uniquely cinematic form: a fiction constructed from recordings of empirically real events. On the basis of the standard print distributed by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) Department of Film, it was long thought that in the final sequence of the film, Porter intercut, or cut together, interior shots of a blazing room with exterior shots of a fireman climbing a ladder to rescue its occupants, creating a radically\n\nThe Big Swallow (James Williamson, 1901).\n\nEDWIN S. PORTER: DEVELOPING A CONCEPT OF CONTINUITY EDITING\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 17\n\n17\n\n23/11/15 11:21 AM\n\ninnovative effect—the illusion of separate but simultaneous and parallel actions, which was to become a basic structural element of cinematic narrative. Life of an American Fireman, however, was a lost film until 1944, when MoMA acquired a 35mm nitrate print from Pathé News Inc. Although MoMA has never claimed that this print, known today as the “Cross-Cut Version,” was the original, it conforms in principle to the editing continuity of the original, as it has been described by American film historians from Terry Ramsaye through Lewis Jacobs and beyond. Ramsaye’s description was based either on memory or on Porter’s own account of the film (more recently set forth by Budd Schulberg in Variety, May 9, 1979). Jacobs’s description was based on a combination of Ramsaye’s version, the Edison catalogue description, and a sequence of production stills made for copyright purposes by the Edison Company, which seem to suggest intercutting at the film’s climax. The Cross-Cut Version is 378 feet long ( just over 6 minutes at the average silent speed of 16 fps) and consists of 20 separate shots linked together by dissolves or straight cuts as follows: 1. The fire chief asleep, dreaming of his wife and child, who appear in a circular vignette at the upper right-hand corner of the screen, later called the “dream balloon.” 2. Close-up of a fire-alarm box and an anonymous hand pulling its lever (Porter’s first close-up to be completely integrated with its narrative context). All other shots in the film are long shots. 3. Interior of the firemen’s dormitory, with the men first asleep, then waking in response to the alarm—a slight temporal overlap from shot 2—dressing, and sliding down the pole. 4. Interior ground floor of the firehouse, actually an outdoor set, with the pole in the center on which no one has yet appeared; workers harness the horses to the engines, and the firemen finally slide down the pole from above at the conclusion of the scene, as the engine races off to the right. There is a significant temporal overlap and redundancy of action between shots 3 and 4, clearly establishing narrative space and time. 5. Exterior of the firehouse as the doors are flung open and the engines charge out, overlapping the action of shot 4. 6. Suburban street scene: Eight engines rush past the camera from right to left, passing a crowd of bystanders (stock footage apparently, since it’s snowing in this scene but nowhere else in the film). 18\n\nCHAPTER 01\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 18\n\n7. Street scene: Four engines rush past the camera, which pans (moves horizontally on its vertical axis) dramatically to follow the fourth and comes to rest on the front of a burning house, where a fireman (Edison actor/producer James White) jumps from the vehicle. 8. Interior of the house: A mother and a child in an upstairs room filled with smoke. 9. Exterior of the house: The mother approaches an upstairs window and calls for help. 10. Interior: The woman collapses on a bed. 11. Exterior: A fireman enters the front door. 12. Interior: The same fireman runs into the room through a door at the right and breaks the window (which was open in shots 9 and 11 but closed in 8 and 10). 13. Exterior: Firemen on the ground place a ladder against the broken window. 14. Interior: The fireman carries the woman to the ladder, which has appeared at the window. 15. Exterior: The fireman and the woman descend the ladder. 16. Interior: The fireman enters the window by the ladder and picks up the child. 17. Exterior: The woman becomes hysterical. 18. Interior: The fireman exits through the window with the child. 19. Exterior: The fireman descends the ladder with the child and reunites it with the mother. 20. Interior: Firemen enter the room through the window to extinguish the fire with a hose. By crosscutting (or, synonymously, intercutting) seven shots of an interior with six shots of an exterior to depict parallel actions occurring simultaneously, Porter seemed to have achieved—for the first time in motion-picture history—narrative omniscience over the linear flow of time, which the cinema, out of all of the arts, can most credibly sustain. No other medium permits such a rapid alternation of multiple perspectives without destroying point of view. (There were precedents for parallel editing, or crosscutting, of course, in late-nineteenth-century melodrama, fiction, magic-lantern projections, stereopticon slide shows, and newspaper comic strips.) During the 1970s, however, another print of Life of an American Fireman came to light that is based on the paper print filed for copyright at the Library of Congress by the Edison Company in 1903. This socalled Copyright Version is 400 feet long and contains nine shots—the first seven as described above, and then the entire interior sequence (shots 8, 10, 12, 14, 16,\n\nORIGINS\n\n23/11/15 11:21 AM\n\nThe editing sequence from the Copyright Version of Life of an American Fireman (Edwin S. Porter, 1903): two frames per shot, except shots 5 and 6.\n\n18, and 20 combined), followed by the entire exterior sequence (shots 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19), without any intercutting between them. In fact, this use of temporal repetitions and overlapping action can be found in such contemporaneous Porter films as How They Do Things on the Bowery (October 1902). Thanks primarily to the scholarship of Charles Musser, the Copyright Version was established as the original, and in the restored print circulated by MoMA since 1985, the two concluding scenes repeat the same rescue operation from interior and exterior points of view, depicting it as two completely autonomous actions. We know today that early filmmakers often overlapped events across their splices—as here and in the rocket landing in A Trip to the Moon—to establish spatial, temporal, and narrative relationships between shots. Yet although this kind of overlapping continuity clearly defines spatial relationships, it leaves temporal ones underdeveloped and, to modern sensibilities, confused. Where, for example, in Life of an American\n\nFireman, have the firemen been between the time they slide down the pole from their dormitory in shot 3 and appear on the pole on the ground floor in shot 4? For a while, at least, these questions did not trouble contemporary audiences. Conditioned by lantern slide shows, stereopticon presentations, and even comic strips, they understood a sequence of motion-picture shots as a series of individual moving photographs, or “attractions,” each of which was self-contained within its frame. If actions overlapped from shot to shot, it didn’t matter, because the temporal relationship between shots was assumed to be alinear—there was no assumption that time moved forward when cutting from one scene to the next. Yet spatial relationships in such preexisting forms as slide shows were clear because their only medium was space. Motion added the dimension of time, and the main problem for early filmmakers would soon become the establishment of linear continuity from one shot to the next. Modern continuity editing, on which the\n\nEDWIN S. PORTER: DEVELOPING A CONCEPT OF CONTINUITY EDITING\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 19\n\n19\n\n23/11/15 11:21 AM\n\nclassical Hollywood system was based (and which still predominates today), began when they realized that action could be made to seem continuous from shot to shot, and conversely, that two or more shots could be made to express a single unit of meaning. Porter himself moved toward this realization in The Great Train Robbery (December 1903), which exists in a single authoritative version and is widely acknowledged to be his finest achievement. The Great Train Robbery was simultaneously the cinema’s first Western and the first film to exploit the violence of armed crime. The most significant thing about the film for us, however, is its editing continuity. Yet although The Great Train Robbery contains no intercutting within scenes, Porter cut between his scenes without dissolving or fading and—most important—without playing them out to the end. In Méliès, and in early Porter, for that matter, dramatic scenes are played out to their logical conclusion and new scenes are begun in the studied and gradual manner of nineteenthcentury theater. No ellipses occur in the action of a continuous scene once it has begun, just as there would and could be none on the legitimate stage. Porter saw, however, that a filmmaker can in fact cut away from one scene before it is dramatically complete and simultaneously cut into another after it has already begun. This practice contains the rudiments of a truly cinematic narrative language because it posits that the basic signifying unit of film—the basic unit of cinematic meaning—is not the scene, as in Méliès, and not the continuous unedited film strip, as in the earliest Edison and Lumière shorts, but rather the shot, of which, as Griffith would later demonstrate, there may be a virtually limitless number within any given scene. In this respect, Porter anticipated the formulation of the classical Hollywood editing style. Written, directed, photographed, and edited by Porter, The Great Train Robbery is 740 feet long (a little more than 12 minutes at the average standard silent speed of 16 fps) and consists of fourteen separate non-overlapping shots—not scenes—of actions, which are themselves dramatically incomplete. These are connected by straight cuts in the following sequence: 1. Interior of the railroad telegraph office: Two bandits enter and bind and gag the operator, while the moving train, visible through the office window, comes to a halt. 2. Railroad water tower: The other members of the gang board the train secretly as it takes on water. 20\n\nCHAPTER 01\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 20\n\n3. Interior of the mail car with scenery rushing by through an open door: The bandits break in, kill a messenger, seize valuables from a strongbox, and leave. 4. Coal tender and interior of the locomotive cab: The bandits kill the fireman after a fierce struggle, throw his body off the train, and compel the engineer to stop. 5. Exterior shot of the train coming to a halt and the engineer uncoupling the locomotive. 6. Exterior shot of the train as the bandits force the passengers to line up along the tracks and surrender their valuables; one passenger attempts to escape, runs directly into the camera lens, and is shot in the back. 7. The bandits board the engine and abscond with the loot. 8. The bandits stop the engine several miles up the track, get off, and run into the woods as the camera pans and tilts slightly to follow them. 9. The bandits scramble down the side of a hill and across a stream to mount their horses; the camera follows them in a sweeping horizontal panning shot. 10. Interior of the telegraph office: The operator’s daughter arrives and unties her father, who then runs out to give the alarm. 11. Interior of a crowded dance hall: A “tenderfoot” is made to “dance,” as six-guns are fired at his feet; the telegraph operator arrives, and a posse is formed. 12. Shot of the mounted bandits dashing down the face of a hill with the posse in hot pursuit; both groups move rapidly toward the camera; one of the bandits is killed as they approach. 13. Shot of the remaining bandits examining the contents of the stolen mail pouches; the posse approaches stealthily from the background and kills them all in a final shoot-out. 14. Medium close-up (a shot showing its subject from the midsection up) of the leader of the bandits firing his revolver point-blank into the camera (and thus, the audience), a shot that, according to the Edison catalogue, “can be used to begin or end the picture.” In addition to cutting away from scenes (or shots) before they were dramatically concluded and avoiding temporal overlap, The Great Train Robbery contains other innovations. Although the interior sequences were shot in the conventional manner of Méliès, the camera placement in many of the exterior sequences\n\nORIGINS\n\n23/11/15 11:21 AM\n\nwas fresh and dynamic. Several shots, for example, were staged in depth: in shot 4, the camera looks down on the action in the engine cab from the coal tender as the train plunges through space, and in shot 6, an actor moves diagonally across the frame into the camera lens, rather than horizontally across it—a major departure from the frontally composed, theatrical staging of Méliès. There is what seems to be an effective use of in-camera mattes in shot 1 (the moving train coming to a halt, seen through the telegraph office window) and shot 3 (the landscape rushing past the express car door), but it is more likely double exposure or double printing. More significant, there are two authentic panning shots—a tilt following the bandits as they dismount the engine in shot 8, and an impressive pan following the sweep of their flight through the woods in shot 9. Finally, there is a suggestion of parallel editing reminiscent of the Cross-Cut Version of Life of an American Fireman when Porter cuts from the bandits’ getaway back to the bound telegraph operator in shot 10. Nevertheless, for all of its contributions to the medium, The Great Train Robbery was not an isolated breakthrough. As Charles Musser points out, The Great Train Robbery was well situated within the already popular subgenres of the chase and the railway travel film (a type of attraction popularized by Hale’s Tours, in which the audience was encouraged to assume the role of passengers on a moving train). All of its interior scenes are photographed in the stagelike fashion of Méliès: the actors move from left to right or vice versa across the “proscenium” of the frame. Furthermore, Porter never uses more than one camera angle or position in any one setting, and like those of Méliès, most of his shots are long shots showing the actors at full length. Conversely, by building up a continuity of dramatic action out of thirteen separate shots, not counting the final close-up, Porter had shown that cinematic narrative depends not so much on the arrangement of objects or actors within a scene (as does the theater and, to a large extent, still photography) as on the arrangement of shots in relation to one another. Contemporary audiences understood none of this, but they loved the dramatic excitement generated by Porter’s editing and by what amounted at the time to his “special effects,” including bursts of handtinted orange-yellow smoke during the gunfights. So spectacular was the commercial success of The Great Train Robbery that the film was studied and imitated by filmmakers all over the world. It is frequently credited with establishing the realistic narrative, as opposed to Méliès-style fantasy, as the dominant cinematic form from Porter’s day to our own and with temporarily\n\nstandardizing the length of that form at a single reel— 1,000 feet, or 10 to 16 minutes, depending on the speed of projection. Furthermore, The Great Train Robbery probably did more than any film made before 1912 to convince investors that the cinema was a moneymaking proposition, and it was directly instrumental in the spread of permanent movie theaters, popularly called nickelodeons or “store theaters,” across the country. More than fifty of Porter’s subsequent films have survived. These display a richness of storytelling within the representational system that he had helped to establish. He continued to practice overlapping action in such conventional productions as Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1903), a filmed play in fourteen tableaux linked together by descriptive intertitles (which he may have been the first to use), complete with painted backdrops and a cakewalk, and in the social-justice melodramas The Ex-Convict (1904) and The Kleptomaniac (1905), which are notable at least for their themes. Some of Porter’s later work has modest technical interest—he matched camera angles from shot to shot in Maniac Chase (1904); employed dramatic, one-source lighting in The Seven Ages (1905); used panning shots in The White Caps (1905); and experimented with model animation in Dream of a Rarebit Fiend (1906) and The “Teddy” Bears (1907), as well as animating the title sequences of a number of his other films. Yet Porter could not adapt to the new methods of filmmaking and the emerging system of representation that developed in response to the rampant growth of the nickelodeons, which by 1907 were drawing one million patrons per day. Their popularity had created a public demand for story films that forced the rationalization of production, which in his managerial capacity, at any rate, Porter initially encouraged. As production became ever more hierarchical and rigorous, however, he left Edison to form his own production company. This eventually became the independent Rex Film, which he sold to Universal Film Manufacturing Company in 1912 to join Adolph Zukor as director-general of the Famous Players Film Company. There he supervised the entire output and directed conventionally successful adaptations of novels and plays until he left the business in 1916. Like Méliès, Porter had a genius for constructing narratives that communicated with early audiences at a certain crucial point in their developing relationship with the screen. The overlapping continuities of How They Do Things on the Bowery (1902), Life of an American Fireman (1903), The Kleptomaniac (1905), and Rescued from an Eagle’s Nest (1908) told their stories in ways their audiences could comfortably understand.\n\nEDWIN S. PORTER: DEVELOPING A CONCEPT OF CONTINUITY EDITING\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 21\n\n21\n\n23/11/15 11:21 AM\n\nIronically, it was the work of Porter, as much as that of any other filmmaker, that had created the nickelodeon boom. Before the rise of these nickelodeon theaters (1905–1906), exhibition was carried out in a wide variety of sites: vaudeville theaters, summer parks, small specialized storefront theaters, lecture halls, churches, saloons, and between acts of plays by repertory companies touring the nation’s opera houses. With vaudeville theaters in major cities paying the largest fees and giving the greatest visibility to motion pictures, fierce competition existed among such houses by the turn of the century. These theaters hired and advertised the name of the exhibition service as much as or more than the films (“The Cinématographe,” “The Biograph,” and so on). During the novelty period (1895–1897), major exhibitors either made their own films (the Lumières’ Cinématographe) or were closely affiliated with a production company (the Vitascope with the Edison Manufacturing Company). The exhibition service would supply the theater with an “operator” and a\n\n22\n\nCHAPTER 01\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch01_002-023.indd 22\n\nshort (eight to fifteen minutes) program of films. At this point, then, the film industry functioned as a unit, with the producers leasing a complete film service of projector, projectionist, and shorts to the vaudeville houses as a self-contained “act.” By 1897, this pattern had changed, as producers began to sell projectors and films outright to itinerant exhibitors, who would travel with their shows from one temporary location—theaters, fairgrounds, circuses, lyceums, and the like—to the next, as the novelty of their programs wore off. Itinerant exhibition separated that function from production for the first time and gave the exhibitor a large degree of control over early film form, because he was responsible for arranging the one-shot films purchased from producers into coherent, crowd-pleasing programs. This process, which often involved the addition of narration, music, and sound effects, was effectively a form of editing, and the itinerant projectionists of 1897 to 1904 may be properly regarded as the first “authors” of motion pictures.\n\nORIGINS\n\n23/11/15 11:21 AM\n\nYet the practice of selling prints outright, which encouraged itinerant exhibition, simultaneously discriminated against the owners of permanent sites and inhibited their future growth. In 1903, in response to this situation, Harry J. and Herbert Miles, operating between offices in New York and San Francisco, functioned as middlemen between producers and exhibitors, buying prints from the former and leasing them to the latter for 25 percent of the purchase price. Later, rental fees would be set according to production costs and admission returns per film, but the exchange system of distribution quickly caught on because it handsomely profited everyone concerned. The new film brokers, or “distributors,” literally made fortunes by renting the same prints to different exhibitors over and over again; exhibitors found that they could vary their programs without financial risk and reduce overhead at the same time; and producers ultimately experienced a surge in demand so enormous that it forced the wholesale industrialization of production previously described. The most immediate effect of the rapid formation and rise of the distribution sector was the “nickelodeon boom,” in which the number of permanent theaters in the United States mushroomed from a mere handful in 1904 to between 8,000 and 10,000 by 1908. There had been such theaters in the United States since 1896, but few survived more than two or three years. Storefront theaters did not become very profitable over the long term until the exchange system of distribution created an economic context for them and gave birth to the nickelodeons. Named for the original “Nickelodeon” (ersatz Greek for “nickel theater”) that opened in Pittsburgh in 1905, these were makeshift exhibition sites lodged in converted storefronts that showed from ten to sixty minutes’ worth of shorts for an admission price of five to ten cents, depending on the amenities, such as piano accompaniment and cushioned seats, and the location. Although they were originally associated with working-class audiences, nickelodeons appealed increasingly to segments of the middle class as the decade wore on, becoming identified in the public mind with narrative. Their rapid spread across the country by the end of 1908 forced the standardization of film length at one reel, or 1,000 feet—about 16 minutes at the average silent speed of 16 fps—to facilitate new economies of production, distribution, and exhibition.\n\n(left) The original “Nickelodeon” in Pittsburgh (1905).\n\nRescued from an Eagle’s Nest (Edwin S. Porter, 1908).\n\nThis was the industrial system that Porter resisted and ultimately rejected. But before he left Edison in 1909, he did something that, by circumstance, was to prove immensely important to the history of cinema. His otherwise undistinguished melodrama Rescued from an Eagle’s Nest (1908) provided a needy young actor named David Wark Griffith with his first leading role in films and marked the beginning of a career that was to last forty years and bring the embryonic narrative cinema to a high point of development. A chain of rejected stories and failed plays led him inexorably to the Edison Corporation studios with a scenario based on a work by the French playwright Victorien Sardou (1831–1908), La Tosca. This Porter flatly rejected as having too many scenes, but he offered Griffith a salary of $5 a day to appear in a film of his own, whose improbable story was based on a real event. In it, Griffith, who was more than a little ashamed to have accepted work as a film actor, played a heroic woodcutter who rescues his infant child from the mountain aerie of a large and vicious eagle, wrestling the bird to its death in the process. When Rescued from an Eagle’s Nest first appeared on the screen in early 1908, Porter had already abdicated his position of creative leadership in film, but the technology of cinema had long been born and the rudiments of its narrative language evolved. The cinema now awaited its first great narrative artist, who would refine that language, elaborate it, and ultimately transcend it.\n\nEDWIN S.

In that year, there were 10,000 nickelodeons and 100 film exchanges operating in the United States, and they were supplied by about 20 “manufacturers” who churned out films at the rate of 1 to 2 one-reelers per director per week. A similar situation existed on the Continent and in Britain, and by the time Griffith entered the cinema, the studios (or “factories”) of the Western world could scarcely keep up with the public demand for new films. Furthermore, the novelty of the medium was such that almost anything the studios could produce, regardless of quality, was gobbled up by the international network of distribution and exchange. Although the introduction of mercury-vapor lamps encouraged several companies to construct indoor studios as early as 1903, films were generally shot out of doors in a single day on budgets of $200 to $500 and were rigorously limited to one reel of about 1,000 feet in length, with a running time of ten to sixteen minutes, depending on projection speed. Nearly all of the films were put together on an\n\n25\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch02_024-043.indd 25\n\n23/11/15 12:03 PM\n\nassembly-line basis, following the stagebound narrative conventions of Méliès and the overlapping continuities of Porter, with natural backgrounds and few, if any, retakes. Not surprisingly, industry emphasis on speed and quantity of production militated against creative experiment and demanded the detailed division of labor. Industrial conditions between 1907 and 1913 clearly motivated cost-efficient production practices and encouraged a trend toward centralization at the same time that they discouraged formal experiment, except in the service of increased narrative clarity. So from the nickelodeon boom to the advent of features, the main industrial tendency was toward centralization and standardization of production practice, and the uniform product was the one-reel film. Nevertheless, financial competition among rival production companies was fierce and frequently lawless. Though Thomas Edison claimed ownership of essential patents for the motion-picture camera, many companies were using versions of his machines without paying royalties. Hundreds of suits and countersuits were filed by Edison and his competitors during this renegade period of rampant growth. At the other end of the industry, relationships between distributors and exhibitors became increasingly strained. Because copyright law for motion pictures was still being defined by the courts and legislatures, and since in any case, most production companies did not bother to copyright their pictures, the majority of films were more or less in the public domain, and prints were often stolen, pirated, and illicitly duplicated, just as books had been before 1893.\n\nThe Motion Picture Patents Company The most powerful American production companies banded together under joint Edison-Biograph leadership in a protective trade association called the Motion Picture Patents Company, or the MPPC, on December 18, 1908. To ensure their continued dominance of the market, Edison, Biograph, Vitagraph, Essanay, Kalem, Selig Polyscope, Lubin, Star Film, Pathé Frères, and Kleine Optical (the largest domestic distributor of foreign films) pooled the sixteen most significant U.S. patents for motion-picture technology and entered into an exclusive contract with Eastman-Kodak for the supply of raw film stock. The MPPC, also known simply as the “Trust,” sought to control every segment of the industry through issuing licenses and assessing royalties therefrom. The use 26\n\nCHAPTER 02\n\nHISTNARR5_Ch02_024-043.indd 26\n\nof its patents was granted only to licensed equipment manufacturers, and film stock could be sold only to licensed producers; licensed producers and importers were required to fix rental prices at a minimum level and to set quotas for foreign footage to reduce competition; MPPC films could be sold only to licensed distributors, who could lease them only to licensed exhibitors; and only licensed exhibitors had the right to use MPPC projectors and rent company films. To this seemingly airtight system was added the General Film Company, which integrated the licensed distributors into a single corporate entity in 1910—the same year in which motion-picture attendance in the United States rose to 26 million people a week. Although it was clearly monopolistic in practice and intent, the MPPC helped stabilize the American film industry during a period of unprecedented growth and change by standardizing exhibition practice, increasing the efficiency of distribution, and regularizing pri"
