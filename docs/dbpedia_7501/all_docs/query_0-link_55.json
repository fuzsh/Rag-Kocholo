Fans are either worried, excited or in any case indifferent to this new instalment. Some find it hard to forgive everything that was in 'The Last Jedi'that caused them discomfort. I feel sorry for the actress Kelly Marie Tran who was attacked by misogyny and racism from angry fans. Her role has been downgraded in this movie because of the controversy. I began to question myself in joining a fan base that is consumed with hatred and prejudice. I have had the high expectations for 'THE RISE OF SKYWALKER' as it was a beginning of an end to a galaxy far, far away that is conceived by George Lucas. Unfortunately it was not the grand finale that I hoped it would be. I felt that Disney has broken our promises in concluding this saga in favour of a contrived ending to the movie.\n\nDirector J.J. Abrams has been brought back to restore the light that has seemed to have vanished in 'The Last Jedi'. This includes retconning the fan-divisive plot points that were already addressed in the predecessor film such as the identity of Rey's parents. While there are fans who hated Rian Johnson's unorthodox approach on 'The Last Jedi'they can thank J.J. for fixing those issues. However, there is a downside on 'THE RISE OF SKYWALKER' and that is that J.J. is losing his creative touch. The plot is derivative of 'Return of the Jedi' and is even convoluted, not helped at all is the sluggish pacing which also hurts the film.\n\nThere is nothing else added on 'THE RISE OF SKYWALKER' like character driven scenes and plot twists. My biggest complaint of the film aside from the story is that Emperor Palpatine being alive lessens the impact of his supposed defeat in 'Return of the Jedi'. This would have been better if the Emperor should have returned as either a Force ghost or a clone like in the 'Legends' series.\n\nThe visuals are still spectacular and there are some good moments in the film. The acting continues with original players that are added to return in this movie like Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. Ian McDiarmid hams it up in his reprisal as the evil aforementioned Sith Lord. While I admit that this instalment was an emotional send-off for Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia. Alas, it would have been better if she was still alive to complete her journey of the character.\n\n'THE RISE OF SKYWALKER' could have concluded in a emotional note with high intensity. I felt it would have gone in a different direction, like how Rian Johnson had done to 'The Last Jedi'. Some fans may not like 'THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, but that doesn't mean that they are nothing short of devotional to the 'Star Wars' series. The franchise will live on in all of our hearts as always, but what we got there instead is a movie that is neither good or bad.\n\nStar rating: (5/10) Average\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nIn Memory of Syd Mead (1933-2019)\n\nSyd Mead (1933-2019)\n\nI do apologise for this late obituary. Syd Mead, a conceptual designer and visual futurist whom is responsible for providing the artwork of films like 'Blade Runner', 'TRON'and 'Aliens'passed away on 30th December 2019 at the age of 86, due to complications of lymphoma. Prior to his death, he announced his retirement in September and is about to receive the Cameron Menzies award for his designs in the Art Directors Guild.\n\nStarting in 1979, he began his conceptual art career with 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture'. It was then followed by his work on 'Blade Runner'where he did the futuristic designs including the vehicles as well as the city of Los Angeles that is seen in his own unique perspective. It was many years later that Syd got to work with Ridley Scott again on the sequel 'Blade Runner 2049'.

While 'The Prisoner of Azkaban'was certainly a step up, 'GOBLET'is the most dark and gritty movie of the franchise. It is up to this point that the series had increased its shift and is no longer appealing to all ages. The later instalments are aimed at younger teens and adults and it focused the characters as they are now faced with adult situations. Mike Newell takes Alfonso Cauron's position as the director and it's incredible how he was able to pull off a simple task in this movie. The visuals are significant as always and it seems that the film has shown no signs of slowing down. But enough said, let's talk about the acting.\n\nI praise Ralph Fiennes for doing an extraordinary job of portraying Lord Voldemort. He certainly knows how to introduce a dark wizard who is already a villain at the start. Brendan Gleeson takes the role of 'Mad Eye' Moody and he seems to make his character look insane. Honestly, I came here for this movie because of its two supporting actors; David Tennant and Robert Pattinson. It's amazing that Tennant plays a Death Eater rather than portraying a certain doctor who wanders through time and space in the 'Doctor Who'series. Also, it is worth mentioning that Pattinson, who plays the ill-fated Cedric Diggory, also plays a vampire in the infamous 'Twilight' movies as well as Batman in a upcoming titular film in 2021. The music by Patrick Doyle is good but has the same notes that John Williams used in the previous instalments.\n\n'GOBLET OF FIRE'remains a bit fresh but still a gripping chapter to a film series that helps everyone believe in magic. This movie is highly recommended to all fans of J. K. Rowling's and stands to be one of the most famous series that was ever conceived in literature and film history.\n\nStar rating: (10/10) Best Movie Ever\n\n↧\n\nPokémon Detective Pikachu Review\n\nPokémon: Detective Pikachu\n\nRelease Date: 9th May 2019 - Australia\n\nProduction Companies\n\nWarner Bros.

Then I started watching the anime show on Channel 10 at Cheez TV and Cartoon Network respectively. I was excited to hear that a live-action film of the Pokémon franchise was in the works. Unfortunately, I wasn’t expecting that the movie would be based on a specific spin-off video game of the franchise called 'DETECTIVE PIKACHU'. I was sceptical about the movie which focuses on the titular Pokémon character who talks like a human because it seemed so weird. Needless to say, I had low expectations. Especially when Ryan Reynolds who many would know as the actor who played Deadpool was cast as the voice of Pikachu. My opinion shifted for the better when I read all of the reviews of the film showering it with praise.\n\nUnlike the other Pokémon features that received mixed reviews, critics were less caustic towards this one. Most video game movie adaptations don't have a good track record, with some turning out to be disappointments at the critical and box-office reception. Thankfully, 'DETECTIVE PIKACHU' turned things the right way around and is the best video game movie adaptation I have seen. The humour is very witty and offbeat and it makes the film extremely satisfying to watch. Reynolds' talking Pikachu was the central reason why the movie was so very funny. Another important layer to 'DETECTIVE PIKACHU' was the mystery that contains intrigue and twists to keep moviegoers watching.\n\nI must admit, Reynolds did a fantastic job of voicing the titular character with a lot of charm and comic timing. Reynolds was a blast for this movie but also has some heartfelt moments to his performance. I thought Justice Smith wasn't the best actor in Hollywood but did okay in his role as Tim. Bill Nighy was still Bill Nighy and it was unexpected to see him in a movie based on the Pokémon franchise. I felt the CGI visuals were good and it made the Pokémon characters come alive for this film.\n\nI have nothing more to say about 'DETECTIVE PIKACHU', but it is a must-see movie for all Pokémon fans of all ages. Some fans won't like it but that doesn't stop them from watching and enjoying the anime and playing the video games.\n\nStar rating: (10/10) Best Movie Ever\n\n↧\n\n92nd Academy Awards\n\n92nd Academy Awards\n\nBroadcast Date: 10th February 2020 - Australia\n\nIt's official moviegoers, nominations for this year's Oscar ceremony have been announced with 'Joker'leading 11 award categories including Best Picture.

While I still haven't revisited the original 'Jumanji'film, I imagined that the graphics wouldn't be as good as the new installments. The humour in the movie was plain and simple but still blends well with the action.\n\nAll four of the returning main cast gave quality comedic performances, with Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Kevin Hart being the standouts. The other actors featured added colour to the film, with Danny Devito and Danny Glover's characters (also portrayed by Johnson and Hart respectively) acting as a running joke. This maybe the main point of difference between 'THE NEXT LEVEL'and 'Welcome to the Jungle'. In other words, the action and antics stayed the same, but the performances were altered.\n\n'THE NEXT LEVEL'was a great sequel and enjoyable for audiences who have watched its predecessor. While this film may turn out as a tough act to follow, depending if the next instalment is going to turn out as not as good as we thought. Best of luck, movie viewers!\n\nStar rating: (8/10) Very Good Movie\n\n↧\n\nIn Memory of Terry Jones (1942-2020)\n\nTerry Jones (1942-2020)\n\nBritish comedian/writer Terry Jones has died on January 21st 2020 at the age of 77 following the complications of his dementia. He was one of the six members of the British comedy troupe, Monty Python, which are compromised of himself as well as others like John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and Graham Chapman. The group are responsible for its sketch show 'Monty Python's Flying Circus'and five of its movies including 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', 'Life of Brian' and 'The Meaning of Life'which all have influenced a new generation of comedians.\n\nThe group was formed in 1969, as all each of the founding members went on become to household names and have invented the phrase \"Pythonesque\" through the meaning of its absurdist style of humour. Like the rest of his fellow Pythons, Jones performed various characters in several of their comedies. Such of these roles include Sir Bedivere the Wise and Prince Herbert in 'Holy Grail', Brian's mother in 'Life of Brian'who has famously shouted \"He's not the messiah, he's a very naughty boy!\" and the morbidly obese Mr. Creosote in 'The Meaning of Life'. In addition to starring in these movies, Terry Jones was known to have co-directed 'Holy Grail'in his debut with Terry Gilliam and is also the sole director of 'Life of Brian'and 'The Meaning of Life'. Outside of his fame with Monty Python, Terry even wrote the script of 'Labyrinth'for Jim Henson. He even has directed a movie 'Absolutely Anything'which he reunites with the surviving Python members and features Simon Pegg and Robin Williams in his final role.\n\nIn 2015, Jones was diagnosed with a rare degenerative form of dementia that he is no longer able to speak. My thoughts and prayers are to his family and friends and he will sorely be missed.\n\n↧\n\nCitizen Kane Review\n\nCitizen Kane\n\nRelease Date: 23rd January 1942 - Australia\n\nProduction Companies\n\nRKO Radio Pictures\n\nMercury Productions\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 119 minutes\n\nBudget: $839,727\n\nBox Office Gross: $1,594,107 (Worldwide)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nWhen famous publishing mogul Charles Foster Kane dies, a reporter must investigate the shocking details of his personal life as well as the meaning of his final word \"Rosebud\".\n\nCast\n\nJoseph Cotten - Jedediah Leland/Screening Room Reporter\n\nDorothy Comingore - Susan Alexander Kane\n\nRay Collins - James W.

Others believed it was 'Vertigo'that outranked Orson Welles' classic masterpiece. I remembered to have seen bits of the movie such as the twist ending. I never got to watch its entirety all by myself until I came across it recently. The history of 'CITIZEN KANE'goes way back long before a new generation of filmmakers and movie buffs like us were even born, as this film was first released in 1941. Initially, the film was loved by critics, but it was unrecognised at the box office and pulled from theatres. Because of the influence of news baron William Randolph Hearst whom the movie has provided unflattering comparisons between him and the main character Charles Foster Kane.\n\nIt caused Hearst to actually detest it and he used his connections to try to get rid of the film before anyone can see it. 'KANE' didn't get resurfaced until the mid 50s when after Hearst's death and television became everyone's favourite pastime. Then decades later, the movie was vindicated and the rest is history.\n\nThere is so much talent and craftsmanship that has been poured all over into 'CITIZEN KANE'as it was Orson Welles' pet project. The way that Orson Welles has self-financed, co-wrote, produced, directed and acted in his very own movie that he couldn't be proud of. It's a shame that Orson had stopped making more movies prior to his death in 1985. The cinematography by Gregg Toland was magnificent as it had paved the way for modern movies to use his camera techniques.\n\nI'm not exactly sure if I want to see this classic again or that I had any interest in it whatsoever. 'CITIZEN KANE'is a great classic, but not one of the greatest movies in my opinion. Honestly, this film gets better as it ages and is more likely in need of transition for video streaming.\n\nStar rating: (8/10) Very Good Movie\n\n↧\n\nIn Memory of Kirk Douglas (1916-2020)\n\nKirk Douglas (1916-2020)\n\nHollywood acting legend Kirk Douglas has passed away from natural causes on 5th February 2020 at the ripe old age of 103 years. His legendary screen presence and indomitable spirit of acting were iconic and he has starred in over a dozen of feature films that maintained his charisma and celebrity status. He was one of the leading men of Hollywood and was one of the last surviving actors that lived through the Golden Age. He was also the father of Michael Douglas who still followed his acting footsteps.\n\nBorn to Russian parents that have emigrated to America, Kirk's real name was Izzy Demsky before he legally changed his name to Kirk Douglas prior to his enlistment in the United States Navy during World War II. Before his film acting career had begun Kirk had worked on radio, theater and commercials. He made his break through on stage in 'Kiss and Tell'when he took over a role that was originally portrayed by Richard Widmark. This led to other offers for Douglas and his career had blossomed and has later transitioned to movie roles, starting with his debut in 'The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'with Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nKirk's leading persona and tough guy image was established in 1949 when he was chosen by producer Stanley Kramer as a boxer in 'Champion'which earned him his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor. It was soon followed up by his other early films including 'Young Man with a Horn', 'Ace in the Hole'with Lauren Bacall and 'Detective Story'which brought him a Golden Globe nomination. Kirk then appeared in 'The Bad and the Beautiful'which he again was nominated for an Oscar for his role as a movie producer. In 1954, the same year he played the titular character in 'Ulysses', Douglas proved that he could perform in roles that have a comedic touch, that in Walt Disney's big-budgeted adaptation of Jules Verne's '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'in which he starred as the sailor Ned Land. In addition to starring in his movies, Kirk founded his own production company Byrna Productions which he named after his mother.\n\nKirk has played Vincent Van Gogh in 'Lust for Life'which grabbed him of his third Oscar nomination and has collaborated with a young unknown film director named Stanley Kubrick for the two films,'Paths of Glory'and more famously 'Spartacus'. It was the latter movie that featured Kirk in a role that defined his career as the title character who leads a rebellion among his fellow slaves. He was also the executive producer of that movie and was the producer of 'Lonely Are the Brave'which he also starred in. Throughout the decades, Kirk has continued to appear in more films like 'Gunfight at the O.K. Caroll', 'The Devil's Disciple', 'Seven Days in May', 'In Harm's Way', 'Saturn 3', 'The Final Countdown'(which is produced by his son Peter), 'The Man from Snowy River', 'Tough Guys', etc.\n\nIn 1963, Kirk starred in a stage version of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next'which he had bought the rights of the novel from its author and was later made into a movie by his son Michael who produced it and starred Jack Nicholson in Kirk's stead when he was considered too old for the leading part.\n\nPrior to his retirement from acting in 2004, Kirk had survived a helicopter crash in 1991 which nearly killed him, and suffered a stroke in 1996 which effected his speech. During that same year, he received an Honorary Award for his lifetime achievement in over 50 years. Kirk became a centenarian when he celebrated his 100th birthday and has appeared in 2018 Golden Globes at the age of 101 with his daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta Jones to help present the Best Screenplay award while receiving a standing ovation.\n\nI confess that I never got to see many of Kirk Douglas' movies and I would have respected him as an actor. My condolences to his family and friends.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWinners of the 92nd Academy Awards\n\nAnd The Oscar Goes To.....

However, its premise as convened by the DVD cover made me think that it might be worth-watching. Unfortunately, this B-grade film feels more like 'Halo' because it was mostly filmed in a perspective of a first-shooter video game being brought to life in cinematic vision. I just can’t get over how its weirdness is comparable to another film. This feature is called 'Doom' and although I haven't seen all of it, I have seen enough to know it uses the same point-of-view camera angle. The special effects are nice in 'KILL SWITCH' but they don’t add to the film.\n\nDan Stevens is the only notable actor in the movie and he tries to give a compelling performance in his leading role. Unfortunately for him, his faux American accent was bad and there were a very few scenes that showcase the main actor.\n\n'KILL SWITCH'could have been so much more to become a great sci-fi film, but nope, it just disappoints us. I would advise you not to come around and go looking for this movie as it is not worth-watching.\n\nStar rating: (3/10) Disappointing\n\n↧\n\nBirds of Prey Review\n\nBirds of Prey\n\nRelease Date: 6th February 2020 - Australia\n\nProduction Companies\n\nWarner Bros.

When walking to the cinema, I had no idea what I'm walking into. After Margot Robbie was praised for her scene-stealing performance as Harley Quinn in 'Suicide Squad', her character was so popular that she reprised her role in the follow-up 'BIRDS OF PREY'. While regarded as a typical DC movie with nothing else added to the film, it doesn't keep 'BIRDS OF PREY' from being ultra-violent and over-the-top.\n\nThe film was somewhat a cash-grab to profit off Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, but it had clever action sequences and colourful humor which are the highlights of the movie. On the negatives, the plot is underwhelming and scattershot. I really didn't like how the narrative was disjointed and had less depth and focus on characters that are need of development.\n\nAlongside Margot Robbie's performance, Ewan McGregor really digs an impression of a bad guy coming from roles as a Jedi Knight and other good characters which resulted in Black Mask really showing full colours.\n\nWhile campy, fun and all-too feminine, BIRDS OF PREY is an above average DC flick which is playful at times but comes across as a missed opportunity and ultimately could have been better.\n\nStar rating: (6/10) Fair Movie\n\nBack to Home\n\n↧\n\nThe Goonies Review\n\nThe Goonies\n\nRelease Date: 12th December 1985 - Australia\n\nProduction Companies\n\nWarner Bros.

It took me a long time to re-watch this nostalgic family adventure that I grew up with and it has cemented itself as an all-time classic. 'THE GOONIES'is not your typical childhood movie as it attracted a new age of youngsters while other films from this era haven't retained the contemporary appeal. Featuring the combined creative forces of director Richard Donner, writer Chris Columbus and collaborator Steven Spielberg, they've created something that could be considered one of the best family movies for young and old viewers. It was a launching pad for a few young actors like Sean Astin and Josh Brolin, who went on to have successful careers in the entertainment business as adults. Particularly Brolin who is an integral part of the MCU playing Thanos.\n\nDespite the actors being quite young, several of them did a fantastic job and have given performances of a lifetime. These standouts to me include Astin, Brolin, Corey Feldman and Jeff Cohen. The adult actors including Anne Ramsey, Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano acted very well against the child stars making for a great cast chemistry.\n\nThe film may well have been a inspiration for 'Super 8','Stranger Things'as well as many other works in the last thirty years. I defintely give 'THE GOONIES' a 10 out of 10 for best movie.\n\nStar rating: (10/10) Best Movie Ever\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSonic the Hedgehog Review\n\nSonic the Hedgehog\n\nRelease Date: 13th February 2020 - Australia\n\nProduction Companies\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nSega\n\nOriginal Film\n\nBlur Studio\n\nMarza Animation Planet\n\nDJ2 Entertainment\n\nParamount Animation\n\nSega Sammy Group\n\nStories International\n\nDistribution\n\nParamount Pictures Australia\n\nGenre: Family\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 99 minutes\n\nBudget: $95,000,000\n\nBox Office Gross: $216,430,382 (Worldwide - figure subject to change)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nSonic is the fastest hedgehog, who has lived peacefully and undiscovered on Earth for 10 years.

It has finally come true but not in the way you would expect. I've already reviewed one film that was based on the video game character which was actually a two-episode anime miniseries. I was skeptical of the new 'SONIC THE HEDGEHOG' movie which I thought would not work in live-action. This is because I looked at the teaser that featured an unsettling CGI design of Sonic which was too bizarrely realistic and many other fans felt the same way as I did. Fortunately, they re-designed it and fans were much happier with this design.\n\nA energetic and (no pun intended) fast-paced movie that manages to get the character right into the big screen. Unlike several video game movies with the exception of 'Detective Pikachu', this movie does justice to the original source material. There is one drawback from 'SONIC'that keeps it from winning over the critics which is the overly simplistic and predictable story-line.\n\nThe best aspect of this movie aside from the redesign of Sonic was Jim Carrey's performance as Dr. Robotnik. Carrey was back in comedic form as the over-the-top evil genius, it reminds me of his early roles back when he had the frantic energy to make audiences laugh. I also thought that Ben Schwartz was funny as the voice of the titular protagonist, and he played well against James Marsden's straight arrow performance of Tom which held the otherwise chaotic film together.\n\nI really think you should go see 'SONIC THE HEDGEHOG', some fans may not like it but that shouldn't stop the rest of you from going to see it.\n\nStar rating: (7/10) Good Movie\n\nBack to Home\n\n↧\n\nIn Memory of Max Von Sydow (1929-2020)\n\nMax Von Sydow (1929-2020)\n\nIt is with huge sorrow that the Swedish-born actor Max Von Sydow has died at the ripe old age of 90 on March 8th 2020. He was known in Sweden in 11 movies that were directed by Ingmar Bergman such as 'The Seventh Seal'and internationally in films like 'The Exorcist', 'Flash Gordon', 'Dune', 'Hannah and Her Sisters', 'Awakenings', 'Minority Report' and 'Shutter Island'.\n\nMax was a seasoned veteran and his career had spanned in almost seven decades. Starting in 1949 when he made his screen debut and in the mid 1950s, Max was approached by filmmaker Ingmar Bergman who was at the time, the chief director of Malmö City Theatre. Their first film together in 1957 was 'The Seventh Seal'in which Von Sydow was cast as a disillusioned knight from the 14th century who has returned to Sweden after fighting in the Crusades. The film featured an iconic scene of the character when he plays a game of chess with Death. Von Sydow's acting profile was progressing while he was working extensively in his homeland of Sweden. A number of times, he was approached for international roles like the titular antagonist in 'Dr. No'and Captain Von Trapp in 'The Sound of Music'but turned them down. It was not until 1965 that Sydow took up an offer from American director George Stevens when he was cast as the biblical figure Jesus Christ in the epic movie 'The Greatest Story That Ever Told'. While the film proved to be his international debut, it was not an instant success at the box office. In 1973, Sydow had gained international success for portraying Father Lankester Merrin in the William Friedkin's terrifying horror feature 'The Exorcist'. He later reprised his role in the sequel 'Exorcist II: The Heretic'.\n\nIn 1989, Von Sydow was nominated for Best Actor in 'Pelle the Conqueror' and again in 2012 for Best Supporting Actor in 'Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close'. Max had other notable film roles that were in his profile including 'The Reward' where he played a crop-dusting pilot, a reverend in 'Hawaii', and Ming the Merciless in the cult sci-fi movie 'Flash Gordon'. He also appeared in numerous films such as 'Conan the Barbarian', 'Dune', 'Hannah and Her Sisters', 'Ghostbusters II', 'Awakenings', 'Judge Dredd', 'Minority Report', The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, 'Rush Hour 3', 'Shutter Island', 'Robin Hood'and 'Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens'.

In fact, there were two more movies to come including 'On Stranger Tides'. However, this eventuality does not take away from the spectacle of 'AT WORLD'S END'. This instalment is a highly intricate though less daring adventure fantasy movie. Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer were the masterminds behind its reduced swashbuckling action and it felt like this episode of 'Pirates'was so convoluted it felt like it could sink into the depths of the ocean.\n\nLike 'Dead Man's Chest' before, it's not quite as entertaining as the first movie 'The Curse of the Black Pearl'. The second and third films are linked both in terms of the plot and being glamorously over-produced for definite success at the box office. Despite this, neither had the same charm as the original. Because of this, fans might find this film to be jarring and not the kind of fantasy adventure film that we've come to expect. This creates an inconsistent tone that drew the film onto a new path. The story-line was confusing and required a lot more concentration than viewers might have realised. The pirates have an implosion rather than a united fight against their adversaries.\n\nI thought that Keith Richards was interesting as Jack Sparrow's dad, which is fitting given that Depp famously modeled his Jack Sparrow on the musician himself.\n\n'AT WORLD'S END'is a decent movie but is short of eight pieces. I recommend this film to all audiences, but don't expect it to live up to the original.\n\nStar rating: (6/10) Fair Movie\n\n↧\n\nIn Memory of Andrew Jack (1944-2020)\n\nAndrew Jack (1944-2020)\n\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, I regret to inform you that Star Wars actor and dialect coach Andrew Jack has passed away of coronavirus on 31st March 2020, he was 76 years old.\n\nAndrew had starred in 'The Force Awakens'and 'The Last Jedi'playing Caluan Ematt, a major (now general) for the Resistance as well as providing the voice of Moloch in 'Solo: A Star Wars Story'. He has worked with over 200 actors, among them are Robert Downey, Jr., Pierce Brosnan and Chris Hemsworth.\n\nJack even worked as a supervising dialect coach on 'The Lord of the Rings'series where he taught the actors to speak in their Middle-Earth accents as well as Elvish and Black Speech. He also taught the cast members to speak in their Greek and Trojan accents that he created for the movie 'Troy'.\n\nBack to Home\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop Review\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop\n\nRelease Date: 19th March 2009 - Australia\n\nProduction Companies\n\nColumbia Pictures (presents)\n\nRelativity Media (in association with)\n\nHappy Madison Productions\n\nDistribution\n\nSony Pictures Australia\n\nGenre: Action/Comedy\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 91 minutes\n\nBudget: $26,000,000\n\nBox Office Gross: $183,348,429 (Worldwide)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nAll his life, mild-mannered Paul Blart has dreamed of becoming a state trooper but is instead a security officer in a local mall of New Jersey.

This fear of pandemic was widespread that it caused everyone to stay at home and began social distancing. Fortunately, it didn’t stop me from continuing to review movies. One of the films I did watch while being self-isolated was 'PAUL BLART: MALL COP'. I was supposed to review this comedy before 2020 and I ended up doing it anyway. The film has some great laughs, but the jokes were a hit-or-miss and the storyline is predictable. It feels like a stale lighthearted parody of 'Die Hard'only without the fun and gratuitous violence. I liked the moment when Paul gets drunk under the influence of alcohol and then makes a fool out of himself. Kevin James wasn't a bad comedian and though he had a knack for playing overweight characters. James' portrayal was decent but it won't save the movie of its shortcomings.\n\n'PAUL BLART: MALL COP' is not one of my favourite comedies and was an average movie at best. I was surprised that the film did have a sequel which is improbable because there is no way it could prove stronger than the original.\n\nStar rating: (5/10) Average\n\nBack to Home\n\n↧\n\nInto the Storm Review\n\nInto the Storm\n\nRelease Date: 4th September 2014 - Australia\n\nProduction Companies\n\nBroken Road Productions\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nRatPac-Dune Entertainment\n\nVillage Roadshow Pictures\n\nDistribution\n\nRoadshow Distribution\n\nGenre: Thriller\n\nRating: M\n\nRuntime: 89 minutes\n\nBudget: $50,000,000\n\nBox Office Gross: $161,702,194 (Worldwide)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nAn unprecedented onslaught of tornadoes begins to ravage the entire town of Silverton where a group of storm chasers are busy tracking the storms and a widowed vice-principal of a high school with two teenage sons is organising the graduation ceremony.

Sears\n\nMusic - Brian Tyler\n\nReview\n\nThere's a reason why 'INTO THE STORM'is not exactly the best disaster movie of the year. Probably because it's too similar to another disaster film 'Twister' which came out 18 years before this film. It's interesting that this movie is more different to what we expect from a Hollywood feature.\n\nIt was mostly shot in found footage which gives the film a natural look, in addition using plain and modern cinematography for additional effects. Unfortunately, the movie is much too reliant on bland characterisations and bad writing than each of its visual aspects. Director Steven Quale is known for directing 'Final Destination 5'was probably not bad at helming this feature, but his efforts are nothing special.\n\nOne thing that also bothered me in the film is that there are two characters who are amateur daredevils given that they chase these storms as the title suggests. They are misplaced and they should have been in a different movie. I believe that they weren’t really necessary in 'INTO THE STORM'and I also think that if the film had been directed by Michael Bay for example, these two characters would have worked as comic relief. If those hillbillies could have been killed by getting sucked into a tornado, they should have stayed dead, given how useless they were in the plot.\n\nThere are not many recognisable names in the cast except for Richard Armitage, Sarah Wayne Callies and Matt Walsh who were probably the only known actors in the film. Though Armitage does give in to a subdued performance in this movie than any of his co-stars.\n\nNot quite as bad as I hoped, 'INTO THE STORM'is a decent movie that does have its flaws. Its entertainment value will probably be best suited for average moviegoers.\n\nStar rating: (6/10) Fair Movie\n\n↧\n\nSmall Soldiers Review\n\nSmall Soldiers\n\nRelease Date: 17th September 1998 - Australia\n\nProduction Companies\n\nDreamWorks Pictures (present)\n\nUniversal Pictures (present)\n\nAmblin Entertainment (copyright holder)\n\nDistribution\n\nUniversal Pictures Australia\n\nGenre: Family/Action\n\nRating: PG\n\nRuntime: 106 minutes\n\nBudget: $40,000,000\n\nBox Office Gross: $71,743,823 (Worldwide)\n\nPlot Summary\n\nAlan Abernathy is a teenager whose dad runs the toy store is trying out a new line of action figures called The Commando Elite vs. The Gorgonites.

This film had a cool and creative concept of toys attacking humanity and each other that makes 'Toy Story'look kid-friendly and less violent. 'SMALL SOLDIERS'was not a kids movie that it was clearly advertised by DreamWorks, it was in fact originally intended for teens which explains that there are some dark scenes in the finished product.\n\nJoe Dante despite known for directing cult classics (apart from his only success with 'Gremlins') has never done something this similar to his hit film. The special effects are dandy but some of them didn't age well, particularly the CGI. The performances from the actors are first-rate, but they never stood out so well in the movie. I really like how Dante got to employ some of the surviving 'Dirty Dozen'members to voice the soldiers, while Christopher Guest and his fellow Spinal Tap players portray the friendly Gorgonites. The film even features a heartwarming dedication to the late Phil Hartman who plays Kirsten Dunst's fictional dimwitted dad.\n\nWhile smart, clever and funny, 'SMALL SOLDIERS'was almost as good as 'Gremlins'and is worth-seeing for everyone.\n\nStar rating: (7/10) Good Movie\n\n↧"
