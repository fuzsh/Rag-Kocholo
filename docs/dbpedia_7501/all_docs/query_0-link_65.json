T h e twentieth century's d o m inant art f o r m was b o r n o u t of the nineteenth-century predilection for machinery, m o v e m e n t , optical illusion and public entertainment. Film's prehistory is a labyrinth of discoveries, inventions, part-solutions and failures. S o m e w e r e accidental, others coincidental, but f e w w e r e devised w i t h the e n d p r o d u c t o f projected m o v i n g photographic images in m i n d . It was an evolutionary process in w h i c h each n e w device or discovery inspired a fresh w a v e of emulation and e x p e r i mentation, sometimes for the purpose of entertainment, but often in the cause of science alone. T h e majority of its pioneers always envisaged the m o v i n g picture as primarily a scientific aid, i n d e e d e v e n Louis L u m i e r e claimed that ' m y w o r k has b e e n directed towards scientific research. I have n e v e r engaged in w h a t is termed \" p r o d u c t i o n \" ' . H o w e v e r , the k e y scientific principle o n w h i c h m a n y o f these inventions was based was a false assumption. Persistence of vision had b e e n k n o w n to the ancient Egyptians, but in spite of the w o r k of Isaac N e w t o n and the C h e v a l i e r d ' A r c y , it was not until 1824 that it was satisfactorily defined, by Peter M a r k R o g e t , as the ability of the retina to retain an image of an object for Ao to A of a second after its r e m o v a l from the field of vision. H o w e v e r , it has since b e e n s h o w n that film seems to m o v e because the brain, and n o t the e y e , is accepting stimuli w h i c h it is incapable of p e r c e i v i n g as separate. T h e brain has a p e r c e p tion threshold, b e l o w w h i c h images exposed to it w i l l appear as continuous and film's speed of 24 frames per second is b e l o w that threshold. Persistence of vision or flicker fusion prevents us from seeing the lines b e t w e e n each frame, w h i l e the phi p h e n o m e n o n or stroboscopic effect, analysed b e t w e e n 1 9 1 2 and 1 9 1 6 by the p s y c h o logists M a x W e r t h e i m e r and H u g o Miinsterberg, provides a mental bridge b e t w e e n the frames to permit us to see a series of static images as a single continuous m o v e m e n t . C i n e m a is, therefore, the first art f o r m to rely solely on psycho-perceptual illusions generated by machine. l\n\nl\n\n7\n\nR o g e t ' s conclusions m a y h a v e b e e n inaccurate, but they still fostered the i n v e n t i o n of a n u m b e r of animating devices critical to the d e v e l o p m e n t of the m o t i o n picture. Despite its name, the first of these 'optical toys', the T h a u m a t r o p e (from the G r e e k for ' w o n d e r turning') was also the simplest. Based on Sir J o h n Herschel's spinning-coin principle, it was a cardboard disc w h i c h m e r g e d the pictures on each face into a single i m a g e w h e n spun on a piece of thread. A n o t h e r R o g e t observation, that a rolling w h e e l appeared stationary w h e n v i e w e d intermittently t h r o u g h vertical railings, gave rise to three similar toys p r o d u c e d independently in the early 1830s: M i c h a e l Faraday's W h e e l 1\n\n2\n\nof Life (1831), the B e l g i a n Joseph Plateau's Phenakistoscope and the Austrian S i m o n R i t t e r v o n Stampfer's Stroboscope (both 1832). T h e Phenakistoscope was a serrated disc w i t h series drawings about its outer e d g e w h i c h gave the impression o f m o v e m e n t w h e n rotated and v i e w e d t h r o u g h its teeth in a mirror. V o n Stampfer's d e v i c e c o m prised t w o discs, o n e slotted and the other bearing the drawings. W h e n v i e w e d t h r o u g h the slots the rotating drawings appeared to portray a continuous action, thus estabhshing the principle on w h i c h the m o d e r n shutter is based. G e o r g e H o m e r ' s D a e d a l u m , i n v e n t e d in 1834, replaced the discs w i t h a strip w h i c h g a v e an identical impression w h e n placed around the w a l l o f a spinning slotted drum. B y the time the d e v i c e was marketed as the Z o e t r o p e in the 1860s, an Austrian, B a r o n Franz v o n U c h a t i u s , had projected Phenakistoscope images o n t o a screen using a m a g i c lantern. S o m e historians trace the origins of light-projected images b a c k to the C a v e o f S h a d o w s described i n B o o k V I I o f Plato's Republic o r the s h a d o w puppets of C h i n a , India and Java. H o w e v e r , s h a d o w shows did n o t enjoy widespread popularity in E u r o p e until the E n l i g h t e n m e n t w h e n , amongst others, A m b r o i s e (or A m b r o g i o ) delighted 1770s L o n d o n and G o e t h e f o u n d e d a s h a d o w theatre at Trefurt in G e r m a n y a f e w years later.

H e r e the audience sat on a dais w h i c h r e v o l v e d as the canvas was illuminated by a battery of lanterns and shutters. J o h n Constable recorded his impressions of the R e g e n t ' s Park D i o r a m a in 1823: 'It is in part a transparency. T h e spectator is in a dark chamber, and it is v e r y pleasing and has great illusion. [Yet] it is w i t h o u t the pale of art, because the object is deception.

T h e 'lanthorn' display Samuel Pepys witnessed in 1666 was probably quite primitive, as candle-light only dimly illuminated the opaque colours of the coarse glass slides. W. J.

Y e t few w e r e w i l l i n g to c o n c e d e that film, w i t h its roots in pulp fiction, c o m i c strips, popular p h o t o g r a p h y and melodrama, was an art, dismissing it as a fairground attraction or a magician's prop. Ironically, it was a French illusionist, G e o r g e M e l i e s (1861—1938), considered by m a n y 'the father of the narrative film', w h o was to b e c o m e the screen's first true artist. B e t w e e n 1896 and 1906, his Star Film c o m p a n y made in excess of 500 films, of w h i c h less than 140 survive. Producer, director, writer, designer, cameraman and actor, Melies is attributed w i t h the first use of dissolves, superimposition, time-lapse photography, art direction and artificial lighting effects. His range of subject was equally impressive: trick shorts (or feeries), such as L'Homme a la tete de caoutchouc (1901), fantasies {Cinderella, 1899), historical reconstructions (Benvenuto Cellini, 1904), docudramas (The Dreyfus Affair, 1899), and science fiction adventures, the most famous b e i n g the thirty-scene A Trip to the Moon (1902).

S o m e accused h i m of p r o d u c i n g kitsch, others o f ' g e n t e e l p o r n o g r a p h y ' , but Melies's c h i e f failing was a paucity of imagination w h i c h p r e v e n t e d h i m from exploiting fully the cinematic techniques he had devised.

Porter (1870—1941). D u r i n g his time as an Edison projectionist, Porter had b e g u n to appreciate that the syntactic unit of the narrative film was not the scene but the shot. T h e version of Tlie Life of an American Fireman o w n e d by the N e w Y o r k M u s e u m of M o d e r n A r t suggests that he had acted on his theory as early as 1902. H o w e v e r , the c o p y r i g h t print, held at the Library of Congress, reveals that the film's dramatic rescue was originally s h o w n first from the point o f v i e w o f the trapped w o m a n and then from that o f the fireman and not as parallel actions. Nevertheless, the film remains significant for a n u m b e r of genuine innovations, including the depiction of o n screen t h o u g h t and the use of d o c u m e n t a r y footage for a fictional purpose, w h i l e the techniques o f ' c r o s s - c u t t i n g ' and 'creative g e o g r a p h y ' taught audiences h o w to m a k e mental associations b e t w e e n events w i t h o u t the benefit of a rigid chronology. Porter did incorporate parallel cutting into his next film, an e m b r y onic Western, The Great Train Robbery, in 1903.

T h e diagonal m o v e m e n t of the characters across the screen, in-camera 'matting' to g i v e the impression of the passing scene, the depth of framing to c o n v e y privileged information to the audience, and the use of 'pans' and 'tilts' to f o l l o w the action all added to the fluidity and intensity of the narrative. Regrettably, there was no intercutting w i t h i n scenes, the interiors (in stark contrast to the realism of the exteriors) w e r e w o e f u l l y synthetic and the acting highly theatrical; still, The Great Train Robbery established the basic principles of continuity editing and did m u c h to w i d e n the v o c a b u l a r y of film's universal language. Porter's r e v o l u t i o n gave c i n e m a a n e w spatial and temporal freedom, but like Melies he was unable to keep pace w i t h public demand and retired in 1 9 1 5 .

T h u s ran the full-page advertisement Griffith (1875—1948) placed in the New York Dramatic Mirror to mark his departure from the famous B i o g r a p h c o m p a n y for the n e w l y f o u n d e d M u t u a l i n 1 9 1 3 . F e w then w o u l d h a v e r e c o g n i z e d the earnest theatrical w h o , on seeing a m o v i e for the first time in 1905 declared, 'any m a n e n j o y i n g such a thing should be shot', and w h o , h a v i n g had his adaptation of Tosca rejected, acted in Porter's 1907 Rescued from an Eagle's Nest (as ' L a w r e n c e ' Griffith) solely o u t of penury. S u c h beginnings m a k e Griffith's a c h i e v e m e n t all the m o r e remarkable; indeed, it is unparalleled in the e m e r g e n c e of any art form. In the 4 5 0 - o d d films he directed or supervised b e t w e e n 1908 and 1 9 1 3 , he shaped the basic elements of film-making into the language and syntax that w o u l d serve cinema for o v e r half a century. In the w o r d s of E r i c h v o n S t r o h e i m , w h o graduated from extra to assistant director under Griffith, he 'put beauty and p o e t r y into a cheap and tawdry sort of entertainment'. Y e t for m u c h of this period Griffith was largely unaware that he was transforming filmic expression. C o n t r a r y to the above declaration, the 'father of film t e c h n i q u e ' was n o t an i n n o v a tor. Instead, he was an intuitive refiner and extender of existing c i n e matic methods, w h i c h h e c o m b i n e d w i t h the conventions o f V i c t o r i a n art, literature and drama in order to tell his stories in the most effective w a y . W i t h i n five years of his directorial debut, Griffith had c o m p l e t e l y mastered the film form. A l t h o u g h The Adventures of Dollie (1908) was an i n c o n g r u o u s m i x of realism and cliched melodrama, it had an 23\n\ninstinctive narrative fluidity and symmetry. Griffith c o m p o s e d c a r e fully to utilize the w h o l e frame and often used deep focus and l o n g shots to h e i g h t e n the drama. He cut on action t h r o u g h o u t , a l l o w i n g the narrative content to determine the placement of the camera and the timing of the cut, and the last-minute rescue ( w h i c h was to b e c o m e s o m e t h i n g of a trademark) was particularly notable for its r h y t h m and consistency o f screen geography. Griffith's h e a v y w o r k l o a d gave h i m ample opportunity to e x p e r i m e n t w i t h film grammar and rhetoric. In addition to e x p l o r i n g the potential of flashbacks, 'eyeline matches' and camera distances, his earliest pictures also s h o w e d that individual shots w e r e cinematic phrases that could be edited together into meaningful sequences w i t h o u t a c o n c r e t e dramatic l o g i c to link t h e m . The Lonely Villa (1909), for e x a m p l e , contained 52 separate shots in just 12 minutes, injecting pace and tension into M a c k Sennett's scenario. W h e n B i o g r a p h bosses questioned w h e t h e r audiences w o u l d be conversant w i t h such a narrative technique, Griffith replied, ' D o e s n ' t D i c k e n s w r i t e that w a y ? ' His depiction of parallel events and emotions in purely cinematic terms prefigured Eisenstein's ' m o n t a g e of attractions' and M u r n a u ' s 'subjective' camera (see p p . 76 and 60). Similarly, his visual metaphors anticipated S o v i e t theories of associative or intellectual m o n t a g e . E a c h film b r o u g h t a n e w sophistication. A Corner in the Wheat (1909) heralded an increasing c o n c e r n w i t h the content of the i n d i vidual frame, its mise-en-scene. To c o m p l e m e n t his naturalistic e x t e r i ors, Griffith disposed of painted backdrops and used domestic props to create angles and shape and d e e p e n the frame. W o r k i n g closely w i t h the cameraman G . W . ' B i l l y ' B i t z e r ( 1 8 7 2 - 1 9 4 4 ) , h e d e v e l o p e d Porter's tilts, pans and 'tracks' into decipherable forms of expression, e v e n cross-cutting b e t w e e n tracking shots in The Lonedale Operator ( 1 9 1 1 ) . Artificial lighting was used to suggest firelight in The Drunkard's Reformation (1909), but by Pippa Passes (also 1909, but 68 pictures later) he was e m p l o y i n g w h a t came to be called ' R e m b r a n d t lighting' as a narrative and characterization d e v i c e . Graphic t e c h niques, such as the dissolve, 'fade', 'iris' and 'mask', w e r e designated narrative purposes, w h i l e split screens and soft focus w e r e sparingly used for additional impact. Griffith also transformed the art of screen acting, right d o w n to instituting rehearsals. A w a r e that the camera c o u l d magnify e v e n the slightest gesture or expression, he insisted on restraint and an adhere n c e to a range of m o v e m e n t s and mannerisms w h i c h clearly d e n o t e d 24\n\ncertain emotions, personality traits and p s y c h o l o g i c a l states. He invariably cast to suit particular physical types, and assembled a c o m p a n y that comprised s o m e of the leading names of the silent era, including Lillian and D o r o t h y Gish, M a r y Pickford, B l a n c h e S w e e t , L i o n e l B a r r y m o r e , D o n a l d Crisp, H e n r y B . Walthall and Wallace R e i d . It is often o v e r l o o k e d h o w versatile Griffith was in his o n e - r e e l days. In addition to melodramas, thrillers and literary adaptations, he directed religious allegories (The Devil, 1908), histories (1776, 1909), morality tales (The Way of the World, 1910), rural romances (A Country Cupid, 1 9 1 1 ) , social commentaries (The Musketeers of Pig Alley, 1 9 1 2 ) , satires (The New York Hat, 1912) and Westerns (The Battle ofElderbush Gulch, 1 9 1 3 ) . In the process he gave cinema a n e w social and intellectual respectability, but despite his achievements Griffith remained largely u n k n o w n . By 1 9 1 3 , Griffith was c o n v i n c e d that his revelation of the truth c o u l d be satisfactorily e x p o u n d e d o n l y in the 'feature' film. H e r e again he was to build on the foundations laid by others. T h e w o r l d ' s first feature, The Story of the Kelly Gang, had b e e n made by Charles Tait in Australia in 1906, but Griffith's ambition had b e e n fuelled by the French film d'art, Queen Elizabeth (1912) and the Italian epic Quo Vadis? ( 1 9 1 3 ) . Furious that his 1 9 1 1 two-reeler, Enoch Arden, had b e e n released in separate parts, Griffith secretly began w o r k on a four-reel biblical spectacle, Judith ofBethulia, in 1 9 1 3 . C o s t i n g an unprecedented $18,000, the film underlines all Griffith's strengths and weaknesses as a director. Sets and costumes w e r e painstakingly authentic, the narrative d e v e l o p m e n t taut, and the acting exceptional. T h e editing, particularly of the battle scenes, in w h i c h mass action was never permitted to s w a m p the drama of the individual, p o w e r f u l l y a c h i e v e d w h a t Eisenstein was to call 'the shock value of colliding images'. Y e t in striving for scale and significance, Griffith discarded experimentation and e x p o s e d his intellectual shallowness. His vision overbalanced the rather contrived melodramas w h i c h he considered to be ' H i g h A r t ' . C o n s e q u e n t l y , sentimentality, p r e tentiousness and political naivety permeate m u c h of his later w o r k , including his b e s t - k n o w n films, Tlie Birth of a Nation (1915) and Intolerance ( 1 9 1 6 ) . A l l Griffith had learned during his apprenticeship w e n t into The Birth of a Nation, his adaptation of T h o m a s D i x o n ' s C i v i l W a r novels, The Leopard's Spots and The Clansman, and cinematically, there is m u c h to admire: the reconstruction of period, the historical tableaux, the night photography, the use of tint and the unparalleled p o w e r and 25\n\n16 D.

B u t audiences w e r e confused by the style and alienated by the sermonizing and Griffith spent the rest of his career paying for its failure. Suffocated by the studio system, his w o r k b e c a m e increasingly conventional, old-fashioned and, despite fine films from Broken Blossoms (1919) to Orphans of the Storm (1922), increasingly prone to repetition and sentimentality. Griffith's final film, The Struggle ( 1 9 3 1 ) , was a failure w h i c h forced h i m to endure a seventeen-year exile from H o l l y w o o d , snubbed by the m e d i u m he had done so m u c h to fashion. Suffocation by the strictures of the studio system was a fate shared by m a n y creative film-makers in the 1920s.

M a y e r (1885—1957), mostly first-generation J e w i s h immigrants from Eastern E u r o p e , had the a c u m e n and courage to e m e r g e victorious from the business wars of the 1910s. F o l l o w i n g the premiere o f the V i t a s c o p e i n N e w Y o r k i n A p r i l 1896, there was an instant and insatiable c l a m o u r n a t i o n w i d e for p r o j e c t e d m o v i n g pictures. To satisfy demand, producers and exhibitors flagrantly ignored m a c h i n e patents and exploited the absence of f i l m strip copyright. In 1897, armed w i t h the patent on the Latham L o o p , E d i s o n b e g a n to fight back, systematically suing e v e r y c o m p a n y that used the l o o p in its cameras or projectors. T h e n , furious at the w a y Edison had taken the credit for the V i t a s c o p e and appropriated its m e c h a n i s m for his o w n Projecting K i n e t o s c o p e , T h o m a s A r m a t also b e g a n issuing writs on the strength of the l o o p patent, including one against Edison himself. As the smaller companies folded, B i o g r a p h entered the fray, h a v i n g secured the A r m a t and Latham patents. Eventually, in excess of t w o hundred legal actions came before the U .

M o v i e s had b e e n part of vaudeville bills or fairground attractions before the o p e n i n g of the first permanent v e n u e , T h o m a s L. Tally's Electric Palace in Los A n g e l e s in 1902. T h e first 'store-front' theatre o p e n e d in 1905 and by 1910 there w e r e s o m e 10,000 of these ' n i c k e l o d e o n s ' across the U .

Previously, exhibitors had b o u g h t strips outright at so m u c h per foot depending on the p r o d u c t i o n costs and the fdm's b o x - o f f i c e p o t e n tial. H o w e v e r , audiences w e r e n o w d e m a n d i n g regular changes o f p r o g r a m m e and to facilitate such rapid turnover, a n e w player entered the industry. T h e distributor b o u g h t or leased films from the producer and then rented t h e m to the exhibitor, thus guaranteeing a market for the producer and cost-effective availability for the exhibitor. This three-tier system is largely still in effect today. Edison h o p e d to exploit the n e w c o m m e r c i a l structure to e x c l u d e the mavericks o n c e and for all. In 1908 he invited A r m a t , the distributor G e o r g e K l e i n e and the seven leading companies - B i o g r a p h , Vitagraph, Essanay, Selig, Pathe, L u b i n and K a l e m - to f o r m the 28\n\nM o t i o n Picture Patents C o m p a n y ( M P P C ) , t o w h i c h Melies was added the f o l l o w i n g year. P o o l i n g their patents, the m e m b e r s agreed n o t to lease or sell to any distributor w h o dealt w i t h any independent c o m p a n y . To strengthen their hand, they signed a deal w i t h Eastman g i v i n g t h e m exclusive access to perforated celluloid stock. Effectively, A m e r i c a n p r o d u c t i o n lay in the hands of just nine companies, w h i l e distribution was limited to the m e m b e r s of the General F i l m C o m p a n y , w h o charged exhibitors a w e e k l y $2 licence fee for the privilege o f renting M P P C pictures. T o protect their assets further from the moral backlash that a c c o m p a n i e d the m o v i e b o o m , the M P P C also f o u n d e d the N a t i o n a l B o a r d o f Censorship i n 1908 (renamed the N a t i o n a l B o a r d of R e v i e w in 1915) to establish a c o n sistent c o d e of standards and principles. B u t no sooner had the Patents W a r e n d e d than the Trust W a r b r o k e out. U n w i l l i n g t o b r o o k the M P P C m o n o p o l y , the distributors W i l l i a m S w a n s o n and C a r l L a e m m l e w e n t 'independent' and b e g a n t o p r o d u c e their o w n films. Others, including F o x and Z u k o r , f o l l o w e d suit and by 1910 they, and companies such as R e l i a n c e , Eclair, Majestic, P o w e r s , R e x , C h a m p i o n , Nestor, L u x and C o m e t , had united t o form the M o t i o n Picture Distributing and Sales C o m p a n y , w h i c h sued the M P P C under g o v e r n m e n t anti-trust laws. T h e M P P C responded v i o lently, e m p l o y i n g gangs to destroy e q u i p m e n t and intimidate casts and crews, but despite such strongarm tactics, the independents prospered and by the time the courts o u t l a w e d the M P P C in 1 9 1 7 most of its constituents had already folded. T h e last, Vitagraph, was taken o v e r by Warners in 1925. E n t r e n c h e d in H o l l y w o o d folklore is the tradition that the film industry settled there because its distance from the M P P C ' s N e w Y o r k offices and its p r o x i m i t y to the M e x i c a n border made it an ideal TrustW a r h a v e n . In fact, units had b e e n shooting in such suntraps as Jacksonville, San A n t o n i o , Santa Fe and C u b a since 1907 to maintain p r o d u c t i o n levels during the East C o a s t winter. B u t in addition to l o n g daylight hours, southern California also offered a diversity of scenery — mountains, valleys, islands, lakes, coastlines, deserts and forests — that c o u l d plausibly e v o k e locations a n y w h e r e in the w o r l d . M o r e o v e r , Los A n g e l e s was a thriving theatrical centre, w i t h a plentiful supply of casual labour, l o w taxes and an abundance of cheap land, w h i c h the companies b o u g h t for their studios, standing sets and 'back lots'.

( R K O was not founded until the sound era.)\n\n18\n\nT h e blueprint for successful studio m a n a g e m e n t was devised by T h o m a s Ince (1882-1924). Actor-turned-director, he made some t w o hundred shorts for Laemmle's Independent M o t i o n Picture C o m p a n y (IMP) before graduating to features in 1 9 1 3 . A pragmatic rather than an aesthetic director, Ince was n o t e d for his pace and pictorialism. Despite a k e e n eye for detail, he was primarily concerned w i t h c o n v i n c i n g narrative f l o w and edited simply to keep the action fast and clear. T h e French film theorist Jean M i t r y w r o t e : ' I f Griffith was the first p o e t of an art w h o s e basic syntax he created, o n e can say that Ince was its first dramaturgist.' Apart from the pacifist tract Civilization (1916), his b e s t - k n o w n films w e r e Westerns, particularly those starring W i l l i a m S. Hart. A major influence on J o h n Ford, they established m a n y of the genre's dramatic conventions and introduced its characteristically sharp, deep-focus photography. In 1 9 1 5 , Ince, n o w a partner in the Triangle Film Corporation along w i t h Griffith and Sennett, vacated his 'Inceville' studio for a vast n e w c o m p l e x at C u l v e r C i t y , abandoning directing for a purely supervisory role t w o years later. H o l l y w o o d ' s first e x e c u t i v e producer, Ince divided the studio's artistic and administrative functions and introd u c e d detailed shooting scripts, tight schedules and production notes to ensure that films came in on time and budget. He oversaw every stage of production, from story conference to final print, and his 'front office' m e t h o d resulted in a n u m b e r of expertly constructed features, 30\n\n18 Thomas lace, Civilization (1916), a parable in which Christ enters the body of an inventor to reveal the evils of war to a Teutonic king. Ince's death (allegedly, catching a bullet meant for Charlie Chaplin) was one of the many Hollywood scandals in the early 1920s.\n\nincluding The Patriot (1916) and Anna Christie (1923), as w e l l as imparti n g film craft to directors of the calibre of H e n r y K i n g , Frank B o r z a g e and Fred N i b l o . Ironically, Ince's fortunes declined under the system he had helped to create. A similar fate awaited another studio p i o n e e r and o n e of Griffith's most fervent disciples, M a c k Serinett (1880-1960), w h o s e frantic comedies o w e d as m u c h to his-mentor's editing techniques as they did to burlesque, p a n t o m i m e , the commedia dell'arte, circus and the chase f i l m s o f Z e c c a and M a x Linder. Sennett was the progenitor o f the most b e l o v e d and durable of all silent screen techniques — slapstick. W h e t h e r parodying popular styles (The Iron Nag and The Uncovered Wagon, both 1923) or treating caricatured humans as unbreakable props in a hostile w o r l d (The Rounders, 1 9 1 4 and The Surf Girl, 1916), Sennett had just t w o rules: that movies moved and that no g a g should be longer than 100 seconds. A master of location and improvisation, he made the camera the servant of the action, e n h a n c i n g the c o m e d y 31\n\nw i t h trick photography, 'undercranking' and the inspirational timing of his editing. He also had an instinctive nose for talent: Harry Langdon, B e n Turpin, Charley Chase, Chester Conklin, Billy Bevan and Fred M a c e all m a d e their names at his K e y s t o n e studio, as did Frank Capra, as a gag-writer. By the m i d - i Q i o s , Sennett c o u l d style himself the ' K i n g o f C o m e d y ' , w i t h his K e y s t o n e K o p s and troupe o f B a t h i n g Beauties r e n o w n e d t h r o u g h o u t the w o r l d . H o w e v e r , his pace, non sequiturs and zaniness did not suit the style of perhaps his most important discovery, Charlie C h a p l i n (1889—1977). Joining K e y s t o n e from Fred Karno's music-hall troupe in 1 9 1 3 , C h a p l i n was originally hired, at $150 a w e e k , as a foil for m o r e established performers, such as M a b e l N o r m a n d and R o s c o e 'Fatty' A r b u c k l e . After just t w e l v e shorts he was directing himself, as w e l l as w r i t i n g and editing m u c h of his material. He devised the tramp character that w o u l d m a k e h i m the screen's first international star for his second film, Kid Auto Races at Venice (1914), although his personality was to be continuously d e v e l o p e d and refined t h r o u g h o u t Chaplin's career. A r b u c k l e ' s trousers, M a c k Swain's moustache and F o r d Sterling's shoes, together w i t h the derby, cane and ill-fitting j a c k e t , w e r e allegedly selected at random, but their 'messy elegance' irresistibly recalls Linder's dapper dandy. C r u d e but romantic, fallible but resilient, the 'little f e l l o w ' was a cynic w i t h a poetic e y e , a rascal w i t h a prudish morality. A u d i e n c e s e v e r y w h e r e identified w i t h this outsider w h o yearned for comfort t h o u g h despising its shallowness. C o n s i s t e n d y r o o t e d i n the p o v e r t y o f his L o n d o n c h i l d h o o d , Chaplin's c o m e d y was always v e r y personal, c o m b i n i n g nostalgia w i t h a horror of social injustice. D e r i v i n g m u c h of his h u m o u r from character and locale, he used films like Easy Street and The Immigrant (both 1 9 1 7 ) to tackle such controversial topics as drug abuse, street crime and prostitution, w h i l e balletic comedies, including The Rink, The Floorwalker (both 1916) and The Cure ( 1 9 1 7 ) , w h i c h D e b u s s y admired for their r h y t h m and energy, a l l o w e d h i m simply to demonstrate his genius as a c l o w n . C h a p l i n s l o w e d Sennett's pace and r e d u c e d the gag c o u n t to exploit fully the c o m i c potential of each situation, so that scenes depended on the impact of the j o k e s and not on their m e r e existence. His use of props s h o w e d the range of his c o m i c ingenuity. A l t h o u g h they w e r e always unpredictable and likely to turn against h i m , as in One A.M. and The Pawnshop (both 1 9 1 6 ) , Chaplin's props w e r e e m p l o y e d to define character and express inner feelings, g i v i n g depth to the surface c o m e d y . B u t central to the success of all Chaplin's films w e r e the intelligence and grace of his o w n performance.\n\n19 The Keystone Kops. Mack Sennett's seven-man comic force made its first appearance in December 1912. Led by Ford Sterling's Chief Teheezel, the Kops became a proving ground for aspiring comics.\n\nT h e r e is an irony in the title of Chaplin's debut film, Making a Living (1914), for, as a founder of the star system, his value rose and his artistic i n d e p e n d e n c e g r e w e n o r m o u s l y w i t h each n e w contract. L e a v i n g K e y s t o n e in 1 9 1 5 , he j o i n e d Essanay to m a k e fourteen films a year at $1250 per w e e k , w h e r e he began his association w i t h R o l l i e T o t h e r o h , E d n a Purviance and Eric C a m p b e l l , respectively his regular cameraman, leading lady and adversary. He switched to M u t u a l in 1 9 1 6 , w h e r e he made t w e l v e films for a w e e k l y $10,000, before securing in 1918 a $ 1 - m i l l i o n deal to m a k e just eight pictures for First National, one of w h i c h , The Kid (1921), was his first feature. In 1 9 1 9 , he c o - f o u n d e d U n i t e d Artists w i t h Griffith, M a r y Pickford and D o u g l a s Fairbanks, through w h i c h he released all subsequent w o r k from A Woman of Paris in 1923. 33\n\n20 Charles ChapUn, Ttie Count (1916). Chaplin's comedy relied heavily on typage. Eric Campbell played Charlie's adversary in 11 shorts, while Edna Purviance personified the ideal woman in the majority of his films from 1915 to 1923.\n\nPeriods of inactivity b e g a n to l e n g t h e n and although The Gold Rush (1925), City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) are a m o n g his most famous films, C h a p l i n was increasingly seduced by h i g h b r o w acclaim from the m i d - i 9 2 0 s . As the T r a m p lost his c o m m o n t o u c h , C h a p l i n b e c a m e m o r e and m o r e self-conscious and fluency and spontaneity gave w a y to pretension and sentimentality. His directorial style had intimacy and a natural instinct for establishing the dynamic b e t w e e n camera and performer, but his methods w e r e highly conventional. W h i l e his seamless editing never detracted from the action, his prefere n c e for bright, flat lighting, carefully c o m p o s e d sets, l o n g shots and 'sequence takes' betrayed a technique still firmly rooted in the stage tradition. His limitations as b o t h director and intellectual w e r e ultimately exposed in his 'talkies', The Great Dictator (1940), Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight (1952), A King in New York (1957) and The Countess from Hong Kong (1966). 34\n\n21 Charles Chaplin's Modern Times (1936) borrowed heavily from Rene Clair's A Nous la liberie (1931) but its greater debt was to Soviet revolutionary cinema, causing it to be banned as Communist propaganda by Hitler and Mussolini. Chaplin took his revenge with The Great Dictator (1940).\n\nIf Chaplin's style remained largely theatrical, Buster Keaton's was w h o l l y cinematic, despite his o w n vaudeville b a c k g r o u n d . In 1 9 1 7 , K e a t o n (1895—1966) began w o r k i n g w i t h Fatty A r b u c k l e and o v e r the next t w o years p r o d u c e d fifteen two-reelers of increasing sophistication. In 1 9 1 9 he formed his o w n p r o d u c t i o n c o m p a n y and b e t w e e n 1920 and 1923 made nineteen supremely visual shorts, including One Week (1920), The Playhouse, The Boat (both 1 9 2 1 ) , Cops (1922) and Tlie Balloonatic (1923), w h o s e elaborate structure and fluid editing rank t h e m a m o n g the finest of the period. Beautifully photographed, w i t h meticulous attention to location and mise-en-scene, Keaton's features s h o w e d an e v e n greater awareness of the camera's ability to register c o m e d y , Sherlock Jr (1924) and Tlie Cameraman (Edward S e d g w i c k , 1928) actually exploring the cinematic process itself. U n l i k e other silent c o m i c s , K e a t o n required c o m p l e x and credible dramatic situations from w h i c h his h u m o u r c o u l d naturally emerge, 35\n\n22 A 1929 Soviet poster for The General (1927), with Buster Keaton as Johnny Gray and Marion Mack as Annabelle Lee.\n\nsuch as the family feuds in Our Hospitality (1923) and Steamboat BillJr (1928). O n c e the plot was established, he unleashed a series o f ' t r a j e c tory' gags, w h i c h impelled h i m t h r o u g h n u m e r o u s dramatically c o n nected incidents that culminated in hilarious pay-offs. Superbly constructed and timed, these energetic, y e t precise and often dangerous, gags pitted the stone-faced K e a t o n against such giant props as a train, a boat, a waterfall, cascading boulders and falling house-fronts, as w e l l as battalions of pursuers in chases w h o s e pace belied their intricacy. A l t h o u g h K e a t o n often shared the directorial credit w i t h E d d i e C l i n e , there is o n l y o n e creative force b e h i n d such pictures as The Three Ages (1923), The Navigator (1924), Seven Chances (1925), Battling Butler (1926) and College (1927). C h r o n i c l i n g the daring resue of a l o c o m o t i v e at the height of the C i v i l W a r , Tlie General (1927) is Keaton's u n d o u b t e d masterpiece. A dexterous b l e n d of period authenticity, glorious location photography, dramatic action and thrilling c o m e d y , the film was nevertheless a c o m mercial failure and K e a t o n was to m a k e o n l y t w o m o r e features for his o w n p r o d u c t i o n c o m p a n y before i t was b o u g h t o u t b y M G M i n 1928.

Personal and professional p r o b lems blighted the remainder of K e a t o n ' s career, although it was studio discipline, rather than the c o m i n g of sound, that s e e m e d to take the p o w e r and p o e t r y out o f his c o m e d y .

His whimsical, p a n t o m i m i c style required great subtlety, but such self-directed features as The Chaser (1928) disclosed Langdon's limited range, and his later appearances w e r e confined to m i n o r character roles. L a c k i n g the depth o f Langdon's c o m e d y o f emotions and responses, Lloyd's pictures had a compensatory pace andj'oie de vivre. He started as a Universal extra and spent t w o years playing the Chaplinesque hobos L o n e s o m e L u k e and W i l l i e W o r k , before creating the familiar, bespectacled b o y - n e x t - d o o r in Over the Fence ( 1 9 1 7 ) . Earnest, decent, y e t ruthlessly ambitious, L l o y d ' s character typified the 'can d o ' m e n t ality of 1920s A m e r i c a , although there was little social c o m m e n t a r y or 37\n\nsatire in such films as Grandma's Boy (1922), Girl Shy (1924) and The Freshman (1925).

Perfect physical foils, they q u i c k l y d e v e l o p e d the characteristics that parodied A m e r i c a n bourgeois pettiness and a m b i tion: H a r d y — p o m p o u s , boastful and bullying, Laurel — naive, i n c o m petent and vengeful. Perpetually b o w l e r - h a t t e d and d o w n on their luck, they w e r e the classical exponents of H e n r i Bergson's 'snowball' theory of c o m e d y , as seemingly harmless situations descended into 23 Harold Lloyd in Safety Last (Fred Newmeyer and Sam Taylor, 1923). Despite losing a thumb and part of a forefinger during the making of Haunted Spooks (1920), Lloyd invariably performed his own stunts.\n\n24 Olivet Hardy, Fay Holderness and Stan Laurel in Hog Wild (James Parrott, 1930). Only Laurel and Hardy could meet such an end in attempting to erect a radio aerial.\n\nchaos and destruction in such two-reelers as Two Tars (1929), Laughing Gravy ( 1 9 3 1 ) , The Music Box (1932) and Busy Bodies (1933)- Laurel devised m u c h of their business, in w h i c h props played a k e y part, w h e t h e r to throw, fall over, smash or simply hit each other w i t h . Features such as Pardon Us ( 1 9 3 1 ) , Sons of the Desert (1933), Our Relations (1936), Way Out West (1937) and Blockheads (1938) increased their popularity w o r l d w i d e , but their careers dipped after 1940, w h e n executives a t F o x and M G M curtailed the freedom they had enjoyed under R o a c h ; their later films w e r e essentially c o n t r i v e d vehicles for recycled routines.

S e d u c i n g w o r k i n g and middle class alike, the tawdry splendour of the 'dream palaces' mirrored that of the majority of the silent m o v i e s they exhibited, m a n y of w h i c h have b e e n lost for ever and m a n y m o r e l o n g forgotten. W h a t e v e r their quality, m o t i o n pictures represented a h u g e investm e n t that had to be protected: as the studios transmuted into film factories, art b e c a m e increasingly subservient to industrial and business practices. N o t h i n g was left to chance. Anticipating and pandering to public taste, the m o g u l s devised a diet of prestige pictures and p o t b o i l ers, all made a c c o r d i n g to p r o v e n formulae and b a c k e d by mass p u b l i c ity and advertising. Vital to the success of these marketing campaigns was the cornerstone of the entire studio set-up, the star system. T h e snobbery of theatricals and the miserliness of producers had k e p t screen performers in a n o n y m i t y until 1 9 1 0 , w h e n L a e m m l e lured the ' B i o g r a p h G i r l ' to his I M P studio and, by circulating fictitious reports of her death, turned Florence L a w r e n c e into a star. As w i t h the films themselves, the stars w e r e manufactured a c c o r d i n g to type. A m o n g actresses there w e r e vamps such as T h e d a Bara, P o l a N e g r i and V i l m a B a n k y , f l a p p e r s like Louise B r o o k s and C o l l e e n M o o r e , 'It' girls in the m o u l d of Clara B o w , w o r l d l y w o m e n such as Gloria S w a n s o n and N o r m a T a l m a d g e and serial heroines like R u t h R o l a n d and Pearl W h i t e , w h i l e a m o n g actors there w e r e Latin lovers like R u d o l p h Valentino, R a m o n N o v a r r o and R o d L a R o c q u e , soulful juveniles such as R i c h a r d Barthelmess and Charles R a y , 'It' boys along the lines of J o h n Gilbert, j a d e d playboys like A d o l p h M e n j o u and O w e n M o o r e and c o w b o y s like W i l l i a m S. Hart. In addition there w e r e child and animal stars like Jackie C o o g a n and R i n T i n T i n , and such indefinable stars as Greta G a r b o ( 1 9 0 5 - 9 1 ) , 'the cinema's first truly Existentialist figure', and L o n C h a n e y , 'the m a n of a thousand faces'. T h e biggest stars of the period w e r e M a r y Pickford (1893-1979) a n d D o u g l a s Fairbanks ( 1 8 8 3 - 1 9 3 9 ) .

Fairbanks made his name in smart social satires and genre parodies before finding his metier in swashbuckling adventures like The Mark of Zorro (1920), The Three Musketeers (1921), Robin Hood (1922) and The Tltief of Bagdad (1924). T h e entire process was punctiliously managed, w i t h the stars' private lives p r o m o t e d in terms of their screen personae; by 1 9 1 5 such fictionalized truths had turned m o v i e performers into p o w e r f u l c u l tural icons. M a n y b e l i e v e d their o w n publicity and the pressures and rewards of fame led to the excesses w h i c h earned H o l l y w o o d its B a b y l o n i a n reputation and the series of scandals w h i c h j e o p a r d i z e d its privileged position in A m e r i c a n life in the early 1920s. If M a r y Pickford's d i v o r c e from O w e n M o o r e and marriage t o D o u g l a s Fairbanks offended, it paled alongside the furore sparked by the i n v o l v e m e n t (and subsequent acquittal) of Fatty A r b u c k l e in a manslaughter case, the murder of the director W i l l i a m D e s m o n d T a y l o r and the d r u g - i n d u c e d death o f leading m a n Wallace R e i d . Faced w i t h a b o x - o f f i c e slump (partly caused by the spread of such n e w pastimes as m o t o r i n g and the radio) and fearing intervention by Congress, H o l l y w o o d opted for self-regulation and in 1922 appointed W i l l H. Hays as President of the M o t i o n Picture Producers and Distributors o f A m e r i c a ( M P P D A ) . T h e Hays O f f i c e was charged w i t h restoring the industry's positive image (by k e e p i n g deleterious stories from the press) and e n c o u r a g i n g producers voluntarily to submit films for pre-release scrutiny. T h e M P P D A ' s loose invigilation was turned to his advantage by one o f the screen's great s h o w m e n , C e c i l B . D e M i l l e (1881—1959). T h e director of the first feature Western, The Squaw Man (1914), De M i l l e had subsisted on adaptations (Carmen, 1915) and patriotic m e l o dramas (Joan the Woman, 1917) before latching o n t o the t w i n Jazz A g e preoccupations o f w e a l t h and sex, w h i c h h e exploited i n such c o medies of manners as Old Wives for New (1918), Don't Change Your Husband, Male and Female (both 1919) and Forbidden Fruit (1921). Straining for easy sophistication but o v e r w h e l m e d by 'Belasco staging', R e m b r a n d t lighting and stylized mise-en-scene, these vulgar comedies, located m o r e often in the b a t h r o o m than the d r a w i n g r o o m , c o u l d o n l y offer tantalizing glimpses of sin and decadence.

His later career was f o u n d e d on equally extravagant epics, including Cleopatra (1934), The Crusades (1935), Union Pacific (1939) and Tlie Greatest Show on Earth (1952). Theorists such as V a c h e l Lindsay and H u g o Munsterberg had b e e n paying cinema serious critical attention since 1 9 1 5 , but H o l l y w o o d in the 1920s was content to act as a barometer of A m e r i c a n social and political w e l l b e i n g rather than immerse itself in the M o d e r n i s t rebellion that was s w e e p i n g all other art forms (and, indeed, cinema elsew h e r e ) . As a consequence, w h i l e Paramount was happy to encourage De Mille's facile brand of spicy morality, Universal reined in the understated naturalism and intelligence o f Erich v o n Stroheim (1885-1957). 43\n\n26\n\nGriffith's former assistant and military adviser, v o n S t r o h e i m p o r trayed caddish Prussians that made h i m familiar to millions as 'the m a n y o u l o v e to hate'.

V o n Stroheim's obsession w i t h symbolic naturalism chillingly e x p o s e d the cruelty and ugliness of the worlds he satirized, but the intricacy of his detailed realism was dismissed as extravagance by the studio heads. T h e rhythmic m o n t a g e (with alternating tints and tones) of The Devil's Passkey (1919) and the vast sets constructed for Foolish Wives (1921) hoisted costs and p r o l o n g e d schedules.

C o m p l e t e d in 1924 at a cost of $500,000, the finished print of Greed ran to 42 reels w i t h a screentime of nine hours. V o n S t r o h e i m himself cut it to 24 reels and his friend, R e x Ingram, shaved another 6, b u t its reduction to 10 reels at the instigation o f T h a l b e r g , n o w p r o d u c t i o n c h i e f a t the n e w l y f o r m e d M G M , was a n act o f vandalism that corrupted v o n Stroheim's vision and destroyed m u c h o f the story's l o g i c .

S h o t w i t h a 'participatory camera', the scenic footage and dramatic reconstructions of Nanook of the North (1922) captured the spirit of the E s k i m o lifestyle t h r o u g h an inspired m o n t a g e of close-ups, 'reverse angles', pans and tilts. U t i l i z i n g 'panchromatic' stock and telephoto lenses, Flaherty's second feature, Moana (1926), was criticized for b e i n g a poetic fantasy on Samoan life rather than an anthropological study, but as J o h n Grierson, the British film-maker, pointed out, the v e r y purpose of the d o c u m e n t a r y film was to m a k e 'creative use of actuality'. H o w e v e r , Paramount saw Flaherty primarily as a talented photographer of exotic backgrounds against w h i c h it assigned W. S. V a n D y k e and F. W.

Achieving some glamour despite budgetary constraint, features such as Birthright (1924), The Exile (1931), God's Step Children (1938) and The Notorious Elinor Lee (1940) were hugely popular in black neighbourhoods and Latin America. Few, however, have survived.\n\n28\n\n29\n\nH o l l y w o o d , Flaherty emigrated to Britain w h e r e , after Man of Aran (1934), he again found himself confined to location w o r k on Z o l t a n Korda's The Elephant Boy (1937).

Marinetti, the founder of Futurism, called the cinema 'a n e w art, m u c h m o r e agile and vast than any other', y e t , he continued, ' e x c e p t for certain films on travel, hunting, wars, film-makers have d o n e no m o r e than inflict on us the most b a c k w a r d - l o o k i n g dramas, great and small. T h e cinema is an a u t o n o m o u s art. T h e c i n e m a must therefore n e v e r c o p y the stage.' H o w e v e r , too m a n y producers w o r l d w i d e misguidedly b e l i e v e d that by duplicating the theatre's m e t h o d on film, they c o u l d import its c u l tural respectability. In France, apart from the intricate courses comiques of Z e c c a , Linder and Jean D u r a n d , w h i c h c o m b i n e d parallel editing w i t h Meliesian trick photography, the majority of films betrayed theatrical influence. E v e n Fantdmas (1913—16), Judex (1916) and the other crime serials of 34 A poster for Louis Feuilkde's serial Fantomas (1913—14). Following the formula of Victor Jasset's Nick Carter series (1908), the serial (5 episodes of 4 to 6 parts each) was composed in depth and atmospherically photographed on location in Paris.\n\n34\n\nLouis Feuillade, in spite of their use of real Paris locations, w e r e essentially tableaux shot from the front w i t h a static camera. H o w e v e r , his films had a compositional depth and density that exploited the artificiality of their interiors to intensify mystery and excitement. M a n a g i n g to c o n v e y b o t h naturalism and fantasy, the atmospheric beauty of each episode derived from Feuillade's poetic imagination and his emphasis on the creative use of m o v e m e n t and space w i t h i n shots, rather than on their juxtaposition — w h a t the theorist A n d r e B a z i n was later to call mise-en-scene. N e g l e c t e d for some forty years, this great metteur-en-scene was lionized in the 1950s by the critics of the French film j o u r n a l Cahiers du cinema, and in many w a y s his singularly personal style qualifies h i m for their highest accolade, auteur. Feuillade's serial style, popular w i t h public and intelligentsia alike, was a conscious revolt against the conventions established in the ' h i g h art' productions k n o w n as films d'art. F o u n d e d in 1908, the Societe Film d ' A r t aimed to seduce the middle classes into cinemas by elevating the aesthetic and intellectual content of the m o v i n g picture t h r o u g h the staging of prestigious plays on the screen. Unfortunately, despite the participation of some of France's leading literary and dramatic luminaries, films d'art remained exactly that — screened plays. N o t w i t h s t a n d i n g a script by the A c a d e m i c i a n H e n r i Lavedan, a score by C a m i l l e Saint-Saens and a cast from the C o m e d i e Francaise, the first film d'art, The Assassination of the Duke of Guise (1908), stylistically predated M e l i e s . Imported from the theatre, the directors Charles Le B a r g y and A n d r e Calmettes had no filmic sense whatsoever, spurning the dramatic potential of intercutting in favour of capturing the action from a single angle in l o n g or m e d i u m shots. Initially acclaimed as a cultural landmark and emulated w o r l d w i d e , film d'art was to enjoy only a fleeting v o g u e , its technical limitations increasingly exposed as grandiose producers added ballets and operas to the repertoire of literary classics. H o w e v e r , it still had a n u m b e r of significant ramifications. Film d'art b r o u g h t cinema an unprecedented social and artistic respectability. It taught film-makers that the b o m bastic acting methods of the stage w e r e w h o l l y unsuitable for the screen and, thanks to pictures such as Louis M e r c a n t o n ' s fifty-minute Queen Elizabeth ( 1 9 1 2 ) , starring Sarah Bernhardt, it c o n v i n c e d p r o ducers of the viability of feature films.

Caserini's nine-reel 1913 remake of The Last Days of Pompeii was immediately outshone by G u a z z o n i ' s Quo Vadis? (1913). Featuring vast three-dimensional sets and m o r e than five thousand extras, Quo Vadis? was little m o r e than a series of impressive, if loosely b o u n d , set-pieces, y e t it made a twentyfold return on its budget. Based on o v e r a year's research, Pastrone's Cabiria (1914) was e v e n m o r e grandiose, its t w e l v e reels boasting s o m e of the most sophisticated special effects of the silent era. Pastrone made pioneering use of artificial light and 'process p h o t o g 53\n\n36 Cabiria (1914). Complete with a credit to the poet Gabriele d'Anmmzio.

W a r prevented Cabiria from eclipsing Quo Vadis? at the b o x office and, indeed, ended Italy's brief h e g e m o n y of w o r l d cinema. In fact, the First W o r l d W a r was virtually to decimate E u r o p e a n film p r o d u c t i o n for five years. W i t h g o v e r n m e n t s s l o w to appreciate the value of propaganda and m o r a l e - b o o s t i n g escapism, m a n y studios w e r e closed d o w n , their materials and finances diverted to the w a r effort, and their personnel conscripted to record newsreels or to fight. O n l y the film industries of neutral Scandinavia c o n t i n u e d to prosper, enjoying short-lived ' g o l d e n ages' that ended in decades of doldrums. R e n o w n e d for its artistry and controversial films such as H o l g e r Madsen's The Morphine Takers ( 1 9 1 1 ) , Danish cinema reached its peak in 1916 in order to m e e t the demands of G e r m a n theatres suffering from wartime isolation. Y e t , as normality b e g a n to return in 1 9 1 7 , the 54\n\nindustry spiralled into decline. N o r d i s k , founded in 1906 and still operating today, saw output drop from 124 features in 1 9 1 6 to just one i n 1928. T h e directors Stellan R y e (1880-1914) and U r b a n G a d (1879—1947) and the silent superstar Asta N i e l s e n (1883—1972, creator of the vamp) had already departed for G e r m a n y in 1 9 1 2 because of the limited resources generated by the small domestic market, and this n e w crisis p r o m p t e d a similar e x o d u s . B e n j a m i n Christensen (1879—1959) w e n t to S w e d e n , w h e r e he shot his b e s t - k n o w n film, Witchcraft through the Ages (1922), w h i l e C a r l T h e o d o r D r e y e r (1889—1968), already k n o w n for his abstract c o m p o s i t i o n and use of intimate close-up, sought opportunities in G e r m a n y and France. Swedish cinema also eventually fell prey to foreign competition, w i t h the leading directors V i c t o r Sjostrom (1879—1960) and Mauritz Stiller (1883—1928) and the latter's protegee Greta G a r b o all in H o l l y w o o d by 1925. T h e y had left a legacy of remarkable features that e x p l o r e d the expressive possibilities of film art. Sjostrom specialized in slow, serious studies of m o o d s and emotions, m a n y of them, like The Girl from the Marsh Croft (1917) and The Phantom Carriage (1921), adapted from the novels of Selma Lagerlof.\n\n37 Victor Sjostrom, The Phantom Carnage (1921). Sjostrom's use of natural landscape and stylized sets gave his films a unique texture and almost mystical atmosphere. Chaplin considered him 'the greatest director in the world'.\n\nA sensitive director of performers, Sjostrom also had great feeling for the natural landscape, w h i c h he used, along w i t h spare, stylized sets, to c o n v e y atmosphere and psychological states. His earliest w o r k , including Ingeborg Holm ( 1 9 1 3 ) , was noted for its mosaic narrative, poetic imagery, deep-focus photography and heightened perspectives, achieved by placing objects at 9 0 to the camera. As his technique b e c a m e m o r e assured, Sjostrom b e g a n h o l d i n g shots to reinforce the significant interaction of character and setting, and e x p e r i m e n t i n g w i t h structure. In Kiss of Death ( 1 9 1 6 ) , for example, he e x a m i n e d the central incident from several v i e w p o i n t s by means of flashback. Despite c o m p l e t i n g nine films for M G M , including acclaimed adaptations of The Scarlet Letter (1926) and The Wind (1927), b o t h w i t h Lillian Gish, Sjostrom ( k n o w n as Seastrom in H o l l y w o o d ) was unable to settle and returned to S w e d e n to resume his acting career, his most notable role b e i n g the tormented academic in Ingmar B e r g m a n ' s Wild Strawberries (1957). 0\n\nMauritz Stiller was as capable of p r o d u c i n g sombre, p o w e r f u l dramas as Sjostrom, although he too often sacrificed thematic range and emotional depth for technical ingenuity and epic scale. In films such as Sir Arne's Treasure (1919), Gunnar Hede's Saga (1922) and The Atonement of Gosta Berling (1924), he depicted the darker side of the soul by means of a symbolic fusion of m o o d and landscape. His detached style a l l o w e d h i m to j u d g e images in purely filmic terms, and his juxtaposition of k e y elements w i t h i n the mise-en-scene in m a n y w a y s anticipated S o v i e t associative m o n t a g e . As Thomas Graal's Best Film (1917) and the w i t t y c o m e d y of sexual manners Erotikon (1920) testify, Stiller was equally adept at c o m e d y , but his career, f o l l o w i n g disastrous spells at M G M and Paramount, was to be cut short by illness. He was 45 w h e n he died in 1928, the same year the Swedish film industry, b r o k e n by the c o m i n g of sound and an unfavourable c o p r o d u c t i o n deal w i t h the G e r m a n c o m p a n y Ufa, w e n t into l o n g - t e r m decline. T h e thematic and stylistic concerns of the Scandinavians had a considerable impact o n G e r m a n cinema, w h i c h had b e e n rendered still m o r e stagebound by the advent in 1 9 1 2 of Autorenfilme, the G e r m a n equivalent of film d'art. Intended by their producer, Paul D a v i d s o n , to raise standards and status, they w e r e chiefly n o t e w o r t h y for the introduction to film of the legendary stage director M a x R e i n h a r d t . F a m e d for his use of functional sets and chiaroscuro lighting, and his skilled c h o r e o g r a p h y of performers, R e i n h a r d t not only fashi o n e d the l o o k of G e r m a n silent cinema, but also discovered m a n y of\n\n56\n\nJ\n\nits leading personalities, including Ernst Lubitsch, E m i l Jannings, C o n r a d Veidt, Fritz Kortner, and A l b e r t Basserman. T h e first G e r m a n film to break w i t h the theatrical tradition was Stellan R y e ' s variation on the Faust theme, The Student of Prague ( 1 9 1 3 ) , w h i c h c o m b i n e d location shooting w i t h a n impressive array o f photographic illusions. Stylistically and thematically prefiguring the Expressionism o f the W e i m a r period, the f i l m s p a w n e d numerous imitations, including The Golem ( 1 9 1 5 ) , directed by R y e ' s leading man, Paul W e g e n e r , and the 1 9 1 6 serial Homunculus, but it failed to break the p r o s c e n i u m m o u l d . P r o d u c t i o n increased rapidly during the war, particularly after the m e r g e r i n D e c e m b e r 1 9 1 7 o f all branches o f the G e r m a n industry into U n i v e r s u m Film Aktiengesellschaft (Ufa), a single, state-subsidized c o n g l o m e r a t e , detailed by General L u d e n d o r f to upgrade output and counter a n t i - G e r m a n propaganda. T h e g o v e r n m e n t sold its shares in 1918 and for the next decade under E r i c h P o m m e r , Ufa's vast N e u b a b e l s b e r g studio operated almost as a collective of directors, p e r formers, cinematographers and designers, primarily e n g a g e d in the pursuit o f artistic excellence. A t h o u g h concentrating m o r e o n distrib u t i o n and exhibition than production, the films that U f a did sponsor w e r e , almost w i t h o u t e x c e p t i o n , classics. T h e same c o u l d not be said for the Aufkldrungsfilme ('facts of life films'), w h i c h f o l l o w e d the relaxation o f censorship i n 1 9 1 9 . W i t h titles such as Prostitution, Hyenas of Lust and A Man's Girlhood, they w e r e essentially pornographic and c o u l d n o t have b e e n m u c h m o r e d i v o r c e d from the Aufbruch ('departure'), the vibrant spirit of inteEectual radicalism that pervaded m u c h early W e i m a r art. A v a n t - g a r d e in style and Marxist in o v e r t o n e , it swept aside b o t h o u t m o d e d f i l m m a k i n g practices and h i g h b r o w prejudices against the m e d i u m . Ufa also capitalized on this n e w - f o u n d freedom, consciously c o u r t i n g overseas success w i t h its first peacetime productions, a series of Italianate Kostumfilme, b e g i n n i n g w i t h Joe M a y ' s Veritas vincit in 1 9 1 8 . H o w e v e r , the master of the genre was 'the great h u m a n i z e r of history', Ernst Lubitsch. Invariably starring Pola N e g r i and e m p l o y i n g lavish, period sets, Reinhardt-style lighting, b o l d camera angles and rapid cutting, films such as The Eyes of the Mummy Ma and Carmen (both 1 9 1 8 ) , Madame Dubarry (1919) and Anna Boleyn (1920) explored the sexual intrigues that simmered beneath the pageantry of the past. W h i l e he made dynamic use of c r o w d s , Lubitsch was n e v e r totally comfortable w i t h the epic scale, preferring the intimate detail or i n n u endo that illuminated a scene, a predilection that served h i m w e l l in 57\n\n38 Robert Wiene, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1919). To some critics the film's Expressionist designs were a conscious departure from the classical Hollywood style or a reflection of post-war national angst; to others they are early examples of self-reflexivity and cinematic deconstruction.\n\n38\n\n39\n\nhis cynical social satires The Oyster Pnncess and The Doll (both 1 9 1 9 ) .

H o w e v e r , through the addition of a framing story, devised by Fritz L a n g (1890-1976) as a means of increasing the Expressionist significance of the mise-en-scene, it was revealed that the narrator was an inmate of the director's institution, thus inverting the m e a n i n g or, at best, leaving it ambiguous"
