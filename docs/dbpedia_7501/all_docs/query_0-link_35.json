        "text": "Rajat Bhageria NETS 150 HW 3 March 26, 2015\n\nOverall: I used Jsoup to complete this assignment. In this readMe.txt file, I have detailed all the questions, all my answers, and the algorithms I used--in quite a lot of detail--to solve the problems. In terms of URL, I only hard-coded the main URL of the portal and then use relative links and hrefs to navigate to the various webpages. The answers to the theoretical part of my assignment is attached in a PDF. I additionally completed 1 extra credit assignment.\n\nProgram Structure: I have created two classes. I have created a \"Questions\" class in which each question (or extra credit question) is a separate method (with appropriate documentation and arguments). The Main class is called \"Main,\" and in this class I create a instance of the Questions object; I then call all the methods for the questions in the main class and do all the printing there. In the Main class, you can chang the instance variables that are then passed into the methods in Question to change the parameters (and thus represent the italicized words in the questions).\n\nPlease do note that some of the questions take some time to process; if it is taking a long time, it is probably still processing.\n\nPart 1: See attached PDF document\n\nPart 2: Programming\n\nQuestion 1: List all movies nominated for the Best Picture award for which one of the Production Companies was Disney.\n\nQuestion 2: For the Best Original Screenplay award, list the writers for the movie that was nominated/won titled Divorce, Italian Style\n\nQuestion 3: List all actors nominated for a Best Leading Actor award whose role was playing a King:\n\nQuestion 4: For the year 2006, list all actresses nominated for a Best Leading Actress award along with the movie and their age that year.\n\nQuestion 5: List all directors (with the corresponding movies) that have been nominated for at least 4 Best Director awards.\n\nQuestion 6: List the country (with the corresponding movies) that has been nominated the most number of times for Best Foreign Language Film award.\n\nQuestion 7: List all movies nominated for the Best Animated Feature award that starred Tom Hanks:\n\nQuestion 8: Wildcard: List the budgets (and the names) of each of the films that were nominated for Best Director award (in chronological order):\n\nPart 2 Extra Credit: Wildcard: The Average age of all the actors nominated for the Best Leading Actor in the year 1936 (variable) is:"
