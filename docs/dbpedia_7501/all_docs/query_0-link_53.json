        "text": "Let’s face it—there have been plenty of terrible movies through the years that were commercial successes at the box office. Even though it can be a fairly good indicator of quality, the amount of money a movie brings in on opening weekend doesn’t paint the complete picture about whether it’s a good movie that people will still be watching decades later.\n\nHowever, some films face the opposite problem—they flop when it comes to ticket sales and initial reviews, even though they might be truly unique and entertaining films. Luckily, that’s not the end of the story! Even though these movies might not have made anyone a millionaire, they still developed cult followings of devoted fans who would love and watch these “failed” films for years to come.\n\nIn this slideshow, we’re taking a look at some of the biggest movie underdogs of all time. They might not have started life with a bang, but some of these films are 70+ years old and still going strong! You might even be surprised to know that one or more of your favorite films tanked at the box office originally! The movie market completely underestimated the power of these movies! Read on to learn more!"
