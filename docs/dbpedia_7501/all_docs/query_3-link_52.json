        "text": "\"THE CITIZEN KANE OF BAD MOVIES\"\n\nAt the Ziegfeld Theater in NYC - the first time I met Tommy and Greg. That happiness cannot be faked.\n\nA FEW OTHERS\n\nused my quote to talk about the film. Charles Gibson did a piece on The Room and Greg Gutfeld on Fox Redeye joked, \"One professor called it the Citizen Kane of bad movies -- but f*** him!\" That's right, Fox News said the F-word about me. I still get chills...\n\nâ€‹\n\nCONNECTICUT COLLEGE FILM STUDIES\n\nhosted author and co-star of The Room, Greg Sestero, to read from his book The Disaster Artist. It was another one of the best nights of my life; I can't remember ever laughing so hard. My students would surely have thought me crazy - if they hadn't been laughing so hard themselves."
