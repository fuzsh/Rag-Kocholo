        "text": "There are many movies I wish I could see again for the first time, and Citizen Kane is one of them, but I’m fortunate to have kept a clear memory of my first viewing. It was 2001, when I was 12 years old and in the final weeks of sixth grade. I fancied myself a budding Movie Expert™, so I was aware that it was directed by Orson Welles (from The Muppet Movie), that it was the officially sanctioned Greatest Movie Ever Made™, and that Rosebud was a (spoiler alert) sled. Like a lot of people, I felt intimidated by its reputation. I worried it would be slow and obscure, and that I wouldn’t “get it.”\n\nEventually I rented it from the library and, six days later (the night before it was due), watched it. Here are a few things I remember about that first viewing. I was seriously impressed by the early “News on the March” newsreel, which seemed to lay out the entire plot in advance. (In fact, I even remember pausing the tape to go upstairs and tell my mom about it. I’m sure she was riveted.) Around the time of the famous Breakfast Montage, I realized that this stuffed-and-mounted Masterpiece was very entertaining. Around the time that Kane sat in the balcony for his wife’s opera debut, I realized that Welles, in addition to a great director, was also a great actor. And I remember the power of the closing scene at Xanadu, where the camera drifted over the many objects and artifacts accumulated over Kane’s life. It felt like I really had gone on a journey with this character. These are not groundbreaking insights, but they are pure and unaffected, so I try to hold on to them.\n\nCitizen Kane a great movie to watch when you’re young and interested in movies. Orson Welles was 25 when it was shot – wise and worldly beyond his years, but still 25 – and every scene has at least one unusual, playful, and/or surprising idea. There’s the newsreel, with its fake silent-movie footage scratched up from editor Robert Wise dragging the film across the floor. The way the camera tracks from the window to the table of Mary Kane’s house. The way the camera drifts through the sign and down the skylight to meet Susan Alexander. The cut between the young Charlie Kane saying, “Merry Christmas…” and his guardian, Mr. Thatcher, dictating, “…and a happy new year.” The dissolve from the photo of the Chronicle’s staff to the Inquirer’s party. The multiple perspectives on Susan Alexander’s opera debut. Kane walking towards his fireplace, revealing that the fireplace is much huger than it appeared at first glance. Kane walking past the mirrors. On and on.\n\nComplementing the film’s visual imagination is the grace, energy, and economy of its storytelling. Consider how the film depicts Kane’s gubernatorial campaign: we see Jed Leland (Joseph Cotton) standing in the backseat of car in an alley – laundry hanging on clotheslines above him – stumping to the small crowd for “the fighting liberal, the friend of the workingman” Charles Foster Kane to defeat “the evil domination of Boss Jim Gettys.” Kane “entered this campaign…” (*smash cut*) “…for one reason only!” Kane is now leading a massive rally at Madison Square Garden. He crows about his rise in the polls; brags that he “makes no ‘campaign promises’” before swearing his allegiance to “the working man and the slum child”; and finally makes a big promise to arrest and convict Boss Jim Gettys. We see Leland in the audience, looking on skeptically before finally rousing himself to applause. We hear Kane’s son ask his mother, “Is pop governor yet?” Everything you need to know about this campaign – its animating ideas; how and why it gained traction; why Kane is ultimately doomed to fail – is laid out in two minutes and 28 seconds.\n\nFor a budding cinephile, Kane encourages new ways of thinking about movies. A rare instance of a Hollywood studio granting a director complete creative control, it is certainly one of the pillars of auteurism. It introduces themes (the loss of an Edenic past; betrayals between longtime friends; a Great Man corrupted by power and humbled by circumstance) and visual ideas (long takes with complex movement; low-angle shots with actors towering over the camera) that Welles would continue to develop throughout his career. As the one untouched masterpiece that Welles completed with studio resources before a lifetime of compromise and frustration, Kane is the foundation for two competing narratives of Welles’ life: the self-destructive genius who never lived up to his potential, or the great artist who fought a valiant but quixotic struggle against know-nothing bureaucrats. More on this later.\n\nAt the same time, there is no better example of filmmaking as a collaborative enterprise. The film is unthinkable without Gregg Toland’s cinematography, Robert Wise’s editing, Bernard Herrmann’s music, Maurice Seiderman’s makeup, Van Nest Polglase and Darrell Silvera’s art direction, Vernon L. Walker’s special effects, the performances of the Mercury Players, and of course, Herman J. Mankiewicz’s writing. In the case of Toland, Welles was so grateful for his contribution that he made the unprecedented decision to give himself and Toland equal billing in the closing credits. The contributions of these artisans are enormous and easy to identify. No other Welles movie has a passage of dialogue quite like Mankiewicz’s monologue about the girl in the white dress. But it’s also true none of these artisans ever made another movie like Citizen Kane.\n\n*\n\nA few months after I saw Kane for the first time, it was finally released on DVD, and I found the two-disc Special Edition™ under the Christmas tree. That day, I listened to the commentary by Roger Ebert, who comprehensively explained how the film synthesized a decade’s worth of technical innovations, from deep-focus cinematography to various optical effects. Ebert was a great appreciator of Kane, but disc two contained a harsher counterpoint: The Battle Over Citizen Kane (1995), a feature-length documentary that compares Welles’ rise and fall with that of Kane’s alleged source: the media baron William Randolph Hearst.\n\nThe Battle Over Citizen Kane is pretty terrible, but a documentary about two fascinating people can’t help but be fascinating. It’s at its best laying out Welles’ origin story: a child prodigy who had already revolutionized theatre and radio by his mid 20s. Hearst’s story, meanwhile, is that of a yellow journalist whose papers directly incited the assassination of President McKinley. The documentary keeps cutting back and forth between these men – one a left-wing artist who spent his life struggling to finance his work, the other a right-wing oligarch who rested comfortably on his bully pulpit – as if they were somehow two sides of the same coin. Apparently they both had large egos.\n\nThe thesis of this Academy Award-nominated documentary is that Kane was both men’s undoing: Hearst would forever be defined by the film he tried to suppress, and Welles, by picking such a powerful enemy, stalled his own momentum. At the conclusion, the narrator says:\n\n“In later years, Welles was a vagabond, trying to patch together his low-budget films. He begged or borrowed from everyone he knew, including $250,000 from an old pal, Charlie Lederer—Marion Davies’ nephew. The money came from her estate. Welles never paid it back. He’d do bit parts for money—ads for airlines or Paul Masson wine—between fits of temper at the journeyman filmmakers or junior execs who were now directing him. Sometimes he was so overweight he had to be ferried about in a wheelchair. He hated the fat man jokes. He hated it worse when people asked him what had he done with himself after Kane.”\n\nWhile the makers of The Battle Over Citizen Kane certainly knew better, most people watching would have assumed that Welles had ceased to exist as an artist. Anyone with any knowledge of Welles knew that his follow-up, The Magnificent Ambersons, had been “butchered” by the studio – although there has never been a shortage of people willing to blame this artistic atrocity on Welles (for travelling on government assignment to Brazil to make a film for Pan-American wartime relations; for making a movie that was simply too downbeat for mainstream consumption; for being egotistical and too big for his britches, etc.). His subsequent Hollywood films carried a faint air of disrepute: The Stranger was a straightforward entertainment; Macbeth was shot in 23 days for a Poverty Row studio; Lady from Shanghai was a lurid, garish thriller, and a conspicuous flop; and Touch of Evil was released as a B-movie. His late movies (The Trial, Chimes at Midnight, F for Fake, Filming ‘Othello’) were low-budget, independent productions that received spotty releases. All of these movies chafed against the popular perception of what the maker of The Greatest Movie Ever Made™ ought to be doing. Meanwhile, most of the projects that occupied his creative energies in his last 20 years, notably The Other Side of the Wind, remained incomplete in archives scattered around the world. Even serious cinephiles would probably have been more familiar with Welles from his wine ads than his later films.\n\nEven when I started looking into him, only a few of his films were readily available on DVD. Sometime in 2002 I found a box set of three public domain Welles movies – The Stranger, Mr. Arkadin, and The Trial – in the Walmart bargain bin, released by a company called Delta Laserlight. The Stranger is a slick commercial enterprise that Welles made to prove he could deliver a film on time and on budget, but the other two are rough-edged independents, containing some of the visual and thematic motifs familiar from Kane but distorted and abrasive. Each DVD contained an unhelpful introduction by Tony Curtis, who read from a teleprompter and kept mispronouncing “Arkadin.”\n\nThe ensuing 18 years have seen a dramatic expansion of the availability of Welles’ work. We’ve had DVD box sets collecting multiple cuts of Touch of Evil and Mr. Arkadin, including versions assembled approximately to Welles’ specifications (revealing his artistic instincts to be consistently sharper than his financiers’). His once-neglected essay film F for Fake was resurrected by Criterion in 2005, and has since ascended to the canon. Almost all of his other major films have been given deluxe home-video releases, notably his extraordinary Shakespeare adaptation Chimes at Midnight, which was freed after decades of litigation. Most miraculously of all, Netflix put up the cash to complete his legendarily unfinished The Other Side of the Wind. The 2018 release of this state-of-‘70s-Hollywood time-capsule revealed a dense, challenging found-footage film that was the stylistic inverse of Kane, but also unmistakably the work of the same author. Other facets of his creativity – his radio and television work, his visual art, even his magic – have become more accessible. A steady stream of books have added new shading to his career: Joseph McBride’s What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?, Alberto Anile’s Orson Welles in Italy, Simon Callow’s Hello Americans and One-Man Band, Catherine L. Benamou’s It’s All True: Orson Welles’s Pan-American Odyssey, Gary Graver and Andrew J. Rausch’s Making Movies with Orson Welles, Josh Karp’s Orson Welles’s Last Movie, and Jonathan Rosenbaum’s Discovering Orson Welles, to name only a few.\n\nWhat has emerged is a broader, more nuanced understanding of Welles. It has become clearer how, having lost Hollywood resources, he built a new style from the ground up. Shooting in fragments over years in multiple countries with revolving-door casts, he was forced to invent a harsh, rapid editing rhythm that culminated with the collage-like The Other Side of the Wind. In later years he formed an important alliance with Gary Graver, an erstwhile B-movie cinematographer and Z-movie director whose rough-and-ready skills served the older Welles’ needs as comfortably as Gregg Toland did in 1941.\n\nThere is also now a better understanding of Welles as an independent artist. It is important to understand that if Welles couldn’t be allowed to complete The Magnificent Ambersons on his own terms, he eventually decided that he wouldn’t survive making more movies like The Stranger. Regarding the perception of Welles as a failure, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote: “The usual corollary of this attitude is a reading of Citizen Kane as a Hollywood picture rather than the first feature of an independent filmmaker that happens to use certain Hollywood resources.” Welles’ self-effacing quote “I started at the top… and have been working my way down ever since” has been often repeated, but more accurate is what he said when accepting the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award in 1975:\n\n“A maverick may go his own way, but he doesn’t think that it’s the only way, or ever claim that it’s the best one—except maybe for himself. And don’t imagine that this raggle-taggle gypsy is claiming to be free. It’s just that some of the necessities to which I am a slave are different than yours. As a director, for instance, I pay myself out of my acting jobs. I use my own work to subsidize my work. In other words, I’m crazy… but not crazy enough to pretend to be free. But it’s a fact that many of the films you’ve seen tonight could never have been made otherwise—or, if otherwise, well… they might have been better, but certainly they wouldn’t have been mine.”\n\nIn later years, his willingness to shill for cheap wine and act in the likes of Butterfly fueled his image as a trainwreck. If you’ve ever endured a soul-crushing day job while pursuing creative projects at night, you can relate.\n\nThis was not widely understood in Welles’ own lifetime. In 1970 and 1985, two critical biographies by Charles Higham seriously dented his reputation, built on the idea that Welles’ career had been ruined not by the philistines who butchered Ambersons, but rather by his own “fear of completion.” It is true that Welles left too many of his self-funded projects incomplete, although a more sympathetic analysis is that since he was paying for his own work, he could make it entirely on his own terms, and release it (or not) whenever he was ready. If, for example, he was embarrassed by The Deep (his unfinished adaptation of Charles Williams’ Dead Calm), he could simply put it away. This film, shot between 1966 and 1969 exists as an incomplete workprint in the Munich Film Museum, but has still never been commercially released. He apparently felt he couldn’t afford a critical drubbing, but it probably hurt his reputation more to have left it unfinished.\n\n*\n\nNow that Welles is better understood and appreciated, Kane has begun to lose its place as the focal point of his career, and the absolute centre of film culture. In 2012, it was finally dethroned from the #1 spot in Sight & Sound’s poll of critics to determine “the greatest movies of all time” – a position it had held every decade since 1962. An accompanying essay by Nick James noted, “Kane is no longer the immovable object of cinema appreciation,” and speculated that Chimes and Midnight and Touch of Evil might actually be superior, concluding: “Kane is dead. Long live Welles.” The same issue included an appreciative essay by Simon Callow on F for Fake, the film at the opposite end of Welles’ filmography, assembled largely out of repurposed footage and no less dazzling in its own way.\n\nI’ve seen Citizen Kane at least 20 times since that first viewing, and as with all great movies, it’s not the same as when I first saw it. As a 12-year-old, I interpreted it simply as a story of a dynamic young idealist corrupted by money and power (the turning point, it seemed, was when he grew a moustache). I must not have been paying attention to the part where Kane tells his hated former guardian Mr. Thatcher that, even while crusading against the fat-cats who run the Public Transit Trust, he still personally owned stock in the company. “You see I have money and property. If I don’t look after the interests of the underprivileged, maybe somebody else will, maybe somebody without any money or property and that would be too bad.” This bit of information is bookended by the speech Jed Leland gives Kane after the failure of his gubernatorial bid – a passage of dialogue whose contemporary relevance needs no elucidating…\n\n“You talk about the people as though you own them, as though they belong to you. Goodness! As long as I can remember, you’ve talked about giving the people their rights as if you could make them a present of liberty as a reward for services rendered. Remember the working man? He’s turning into something called organized labor. You’re not gonna like that one little bit when you find out it means that your working man expects something as his right, not your gift, Charlie. When your precious underprivileged really get together, oh boy, that’s gonna add up to something bigger than your privilege and I don’t know what you’ll do. Sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.”\n\nAdmittedly, we don’t see a lot of the “working man” in Citizen Kane. The closest we get is poor Susan Alexander, an ordinary girl whose life is hijacked by Kane’s and who lives much of her life as his private property. I anticipate that Kane will drop further in the rankings on the next Sight & Sound poll. In some ways, this movie about an oligarch who fancies himself a liberal is more vital than ever, but canonical movies about the souls of oligarchs are not exactly the flavour of the month.\n\nOne entity that does still have a vested interest in Kane’s centrality is WarnerMedia, the company that owns the RKO library. The official Warner Bros. “70th Anniversary Edition” Blu-Ray of Kane comes with a schlocky booklet that offers such pearls of wisdom as “The exuberance of the young director began to rapidly fade,” and, “Welles continued to work at the craft of filmmaking until his death in 1985, trying in vain to recapture the magic of his youth, not so unlike Charles Foster Kane.” Keep in mind that this unbelievably hacky sentence is from the film’s official Blu-Ray release. To WarnerMedia, Welles ceased to matter because he could not thrive in a company like WarnerMedia. It’s the system that’s correct, and it’s Welles’ fault for not adapting to it. Chimes and Midnight and F for Fake are not studio productions, and therefore do not exist.\n\nA digression: lately, I’ve found myself unexpectedly moved by the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut campaign. The subject of this genuinely grassroots effort is Justice League (2017), the misbegotten superhero buffet that was credited to director Zack Snyder but largely reshot by Joss Whedon. The version released to theatres is an obviously compromised mishmash of two competing sensibilities, and rumours circulated that a more coherent expression of Snyder’s vision still existed in rough-cut form. Fans of Snyder petitioned, protested, and spammed the WarnerMedia corporate Twitter accounts to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut, to the point that the stars of Justice League and even Zack Snyder himself joined in. Eventually they relented and hired Snyder back. Now Snyder is currently preparing not simply a rough cut but a dramatically expanded version of his original footage, with a budget of at least $70 million.\n\nIn my opinion, this is an unambiguously good thing. Compare the Zack Snyder fans to the Marvel fans who primarily value the rigorous, top-down quality control of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, wherein filmmakers ranging from Kenneth Branagh to Ryan Coogler all make movies that look and feel exactly the same. The business model of Marvel Studios and its parent company, Disney, is to minimize the human factor as much as possible. I respect these Zack Syder fans for standing up for an artist’s personal vision against a powerful corporation. By the way, I think Zack Snyder is a very bad artist, but that doesn’t matter.\n\n*\n\nHerman J. Mankiewicz’s contribution to Kane’s screenplay became the subject of scrutiny in 1971 when Pauline Kael published “Raising Kane” in The New Yorker. This two-part essay alleges that, despite sharing credit with Welles as co-writer, Mankiewicz was essentially the sole author of the Citizen Kane screenplay, and also that Welles conspired to remove Mankiewicz’s name from the film.\n\nAnyone familiar with Kael’s career would have understood the real agenda of “Raising Kane”: to debunk the Auteur Theory once and for all. The Auteur Theory was first proposed by Francois Truffaut in the pages of Cahiers du Cinema, and then brought to America by Kael’s arch-nemesis Andrew Sarris, and advanced the then-radical notion that certain Hollywood studio directors (Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, John Ford etc.) imposed consistent personal style and meaning on their films to the point where they could be considered “authors,” and even artists. In a time when critics praised European masters like Bergman and Antonioni for elevating film to an art form, Sarris argued there was plenty of personal art already happening from craftsmen in the Hollywood factory.\n\nIf Kael’s career can be boiled down to one line, it is this oft-quoted one: “Movies are so rarely great art that if we cannot appreciate great trash we have very little reason to be interested in them.” A seemingly populist sentiment on the face of it, Kael’s principle ultimately serves to uphold hierarchies of high and low – reassuring middlebrow readers that it’s okay to enjoy “trash” while also not needing to engage with it on any serious level. In my humble opinion, this attitude is a dead end. The limitations of the Auteur Theory are many and well-understood, but I’d rather be with Andrew Sarris looking for art in the crevices of a Phil Karlson movie than whatever Kael was doing.\n\nIn “Raising Kane,” Kael implicitly sought to debunk the Auteur Theory by revealing that Hollywood’s “greatest auteur” was not the sole or even primary author of his greatest achievement. Her first strategy was to position Kane not as an unusual case of an artist being given free reign at a studio, but actually as a studio product in the lineage of 1930s “newspaper comedies.” Her second and more serious strategy was the allegations about Mankiewicz. Kael’s claims were pretty thoroughly debunked when historian Robert Carringer interviewed surviving collaborators and studied drafts of the screenplay for his monograph The Making of Citizen Kane. To put it briefly: Mankiewicz wrote a sprawling first draft; Welles then revised it, streamlined it, and introduced the flashback structure. This is not even counting such intangibles as the conversations the two men would have had before and during the writing of Mankiewicz’s first draft.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Carringer was, on the whole, unsympathetic to Welles. The thesis of The Making of Citizen Kane is that Kane towers above the rest of Welles’ filmography because of the contributions of his skilled studio collaborators. Meanwhile, Kael’s discredited claims continue to live on: the aforementioned Kane Blu-Ray booklet includes the sentence, “How much help [Mankiewicz] had from Welles was open to debate.” This week sees the release of David Fincher’s Mank, a biopic of Herman J. Mankiewicz. I haven’t seen it yet, and so can’t speak to its quality. Those who have say that Welles is only a peripheral character, but that the movie still finds a small amount of time to repeat Kael’s allegations.\n\nTowards the end of The Battle Over Citizen Kane, editor Robert Wise observes that Charles Foster Kane’s fate was not unlike that of Orson Welles: both had a moment of great youthful promise, following by a protracted decline. Wise was one of the RKO employees tasked with shooting the incongruous “happy ending” of The Magnificent Amberson that was imposed while Welles was in Brazil, and Welles never forgave him. Wise eventually became a prolific and respected director in his own right, with such films as The Sound of Music, West Side Story, and Star Trek: The Motion Picture to his credit. He thrived in the studio system. Would you rather be the director of Chimes at Midnight or The Sound of Music? Or, for that matter, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo?"
