        "text": "A standoff over one of the most illustrious artifacts of American film, the Oscar won by Orson Welles in 1942 as the co-writer of ''Citizen Kane,'' ended yesterday when Christie's withdrew it from sale. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Hollywood trade group that sponsors the Oscars, had objected to its sale, claiming the right to buy back the statue for $1.\n\nThe Oscar was to have been the centerpiece of Christie's ''Entertainment Memorabilia'' auction on Friday and was highlighted on the catalog cover. It was among a large selection of Welles-related material and had carried an estimate of $300,000 to $400,000. The rest of the sale is to continue as planned.\n\n''The Oscar has been withdrawn,'' a Christie's spokeswoman said late yesterday afternoon, ''so we will not be able to offer it in the sale.''\n\nAlthough several major Oscars have reached the market in recent years, including Ronald Colman's best-acting award for ''A Double Life'' (1947), which sold at Christie's last year for $174,500, the academy has long imposed restrictions on how and where Oscars can be sold.\n\nBruce Davis, the academy's executive director, had said he was surprised that the Welles Oscar had been scheduled for sale because ''we have a letter from Christie's general counsel assuring us that the Oscar would not be offered for sale until the legal issues are resolved.'' He continued, ''We were extremely puzzled to hear on Friday that they intended to go ahead and put it on the block.''\n\nSince 1950 the academy has asked all Oscar recipients to sign an agreement stipulating that should the owner ever offer the Oscar for sale, the academy has the first right of purchase, at the nominal cost of $1. Mr. Davis said the agreement was evoked to stop the sale of the Kane Oscar, even though it was won eight years before the agreement came into being.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
