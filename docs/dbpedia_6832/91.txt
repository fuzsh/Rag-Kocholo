British director Andrea Arnold’s Jury Prize win for teen drama Fish Tank (shared with Park Chan-Wook for Thirst) has put a smile on the faces of its co-producers the UK Film Council (UKFC).

UKFC CEO John Woodward said, “Huge congratulations to Andrea Arnold. Winning the Jury Prize for Fish Tank only three years after her win for Red Road shows what an exciting and dynamic British talent she is.

“This is also great news for the UK Film Council, who helped develop and finance both Fish Tank and Red Road, as well as the Cannes-nominated Bright Star – further proof of how public funding for film can make all the difference.

“This award highlights just why the UK Film Council have been loyal supporters of such remarkable female filmmakers as Andrea Arnold, Gurinder Chadha, Jane Campion and Lynne Ramsey, all of whom are rightly getting the global recognition they so deserve.”

Arnold said, “It’s a small film and this gives it a great start in life.”

Along with the UKFC, the film was co-produced by BBC Films, Kasander Film Company and Limelight Communication. Artificial Eye is distributing the film in the UK, Cinéart in the Netherlands and MK2 Diffusion in France.
