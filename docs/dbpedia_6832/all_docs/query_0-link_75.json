        "text": "What makes a British film?\n\nMany British people tend to watch and enjoy Hollywood films a lot more than British films. This is because the public was so used to watching Hollywood films from a young age, and never really got the chance to see any great British films on their screen. Hollywood films showed the audience what they wanted to see, great visuals, exciting fairytales and happy ending whereas British films was not as successful due to the different styles and aspects.\n\nSeveral directors have now managed to changed this view and now have audience who generally love British films, for example; Shane Meadows, Danny Boyle, Noel Clarke and Joe Cornish who made successful films such as This is England, Slum dog Millionaire, Kidulthood, Adulthood and Attack the block.\n\nIn this article, I will be addressing the important elements that stand out in British films and from my recent research and analysis on UK film; I will be explaining what makes a British film?\n\nBudget and Funding\n\nFunding is very essential its what makes it happen, British films are commonly funded by Lottery, BBC films and UK film council that closed down and is now the BFI. These companies broadcast and promote the film ensuring the public and have the film and also covers the all the charges needed to make the film happen. British films generally have a low budget not like Hollywood films that have high budgets.\n\nFish Tank Directed by Andrea Arnold was funded by BBC Films and UK Film Council, with an 3million budget\n\nDead man’s shoes by Shane Meadows was funded by Film4 and Warp Films, with an £723,000 Budget\n\nFour Lions by Chris Morris was funded by Warp films, with an 2.5million budget\n\nThemes\n\nBritish films themes are usaully based around real life issue that occur in the UK. Unlike hollywood films that commonnly give unbelieveable storylines, British films bring reality into the film industry and tackle social issues such as youth crime, different lifestyles with different races,countries and religion, growth and idependence and many more. Beautiful Thing by Hettie MacDonald explores the issues of social frustration, domestic violence and abuse; Kidulthood and Adulthood theme is based on the lifestyle of London teenagers, Drugs, sex and violence. Four lions theme is based on Muslim terrorism/religion and has a very strong message. All of these themes are issues that continue to happen in the UK daily.\n\nBritish Actors and Location\n\nUnknown actors in british films are very common and important as it’s one of the main aspects what brings realism into the film. This is because the british cinema battle for authenticity, and using professional actors that we see on our tv screens daily would take away the realistic look, which could change the look and feel of what is trying to be shown. Seeing an unfamilair face could make you believe the film could also be true and help feel whatever emotionals the character is feeling which gives a better understanding of the film its self. In most british films the actors are unknown, for example ‘Attack the block’, majority of the actors was unknown which is one of the reasons why it was such a great successful, something different.\n\nUnlike hollywood films whos locations are usually set up in a studio, british films tend to use real locations such as council estates, parks, train stations, markets, buses etc. This comes back to the realistic look of the film, by using noticable locations it allows the viewers to relate more or possibly understand as there may have also lived the lifestyle in a council estate etc. The bristish cinema uses a range of different camera shots but uses wide shots and long shots a lot more to show the location and other things happening in the shot rather than forcusing on on thing whereas hollywood use a lot of close ups to show the actors facial expressions and to get a better understanding of whats happening. For example\n\nDirector\n\nMost directors base there films around their experience, thier lifestyle or someone they knows lifestyle for example joe cornish who grew up in hackey and now lives in south london, director of ‘ Attack The Block ‘a science fiction action\n\ncomedy horror film set in South London that pitches a gang of youths against an alien invasion I feel this film has alot of meaning behind it not just , so i feel he could have been referring to the youths and trying to show that everyone always thing a group of boys that live in counsil estate is in a gang and atomatically judges them not knowing there background history, but hes uses this film to get his point across.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Signifcant elements in what makes a british film; Budget, funding, themes, unknown actors, locations and directors and overall social realism. British cinema may not be as great as hollywood films with fancy cars and crazy explosions but they have a unqiue style, realistic look and leaves messages for the viewers.\n\nI feel througout the years british films will only get better and improve without using professional actors and creating locations in the studio or as they are now getting more recogition and love from the public."
