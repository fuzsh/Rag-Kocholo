        "text": "Andrea Arnold’s “Fish Tank” led the 12th annual British Independent Film Award nominations, which were announced today at Soho House in London. The film managed eight nominations, including best film, best director, best screenplay, and acting nods for Katie Jarvis, Kierston Wareing and Michael Fassbender. The film, which premiered at Cannes earlier this year, will be released Stateside via IFC Films this January.\n\nOther films that had a major presence within the nominations were Duncan Jones’ “Moon,” with seven nominations, while Lone Scherfig’s “An Education,” Armando Iannucci’s “In The Loop,” and Sam Taylor Wood’s “Nowhere Boy” each received six. Also notable is that three of the five best film nominees – the noted “Tank,” “Education” and “Boy” – were directed by women.\n\nOverall, it’s an impressive lineup of films, indicative of a great year for British independent cinema. It’s also suggestive of the influx of fresh blood in the UK – three of the five best film nominees were directed by first timers, while Abbie Cornish, Carey Mulligan, Katie Jarvis, Aaron Johnson, Andy Serkis, Peter Capaldi, Sam Rockwell, Tom Hardy, Anne-Marie Duff, Kerry Fox, Alfred Molina, John Henshaw, Christian McKay and Hilda Peter are all first-time acting nominees.\n\nThe five nominees for the awards’ foreign-made category included “Sin Nombre,” “The Hurt Locker,” “Il Divo,” “Let The Right One In,” and “The Wrestler.”\n\nThe BIFA Pre-Selection Committee of 70 members viewed more than 200 films, out of which they selected the nominations, decided by ballot. Daniel Day Lewis was additionally announced as the winner of the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film by an Actor.\n\nBIFA’s new jury is comprised of professionals and talent from across the British film industry including: Actress Jodie Whittaker, Actors Idris Elba, Liam Cunningham, Eddie Marsan and Peter Mullan, Directors Sarah Gavron and Eran Creevy, Producers Dixie Linder, Anita Overland and Adrian Sturges, Documentary Filmmaker Kate Blewett, Film Marketing Consultant Robert Mitchell, Projectionist Paul Speed and Head of Distribution and Exhibition at The UK Film Council Peter Buckingham.\n\nThe ceremony will take place on Sunday 6 December at The Brewery, Chiswell Street, in London and will be hosted by James Nesbitt.
