        "text": "2. FISH TANK- GENERAL INFORMATION Director: Andrea Arnold Writer: Andrea Arnold Producers: Kees kasander, Lisette Kelder, Christine Langan, Nick Laws, David.M.Thompson, Paul Trijbits. Genre: Drama Release date 21st June 2009 (Edinburgh International Film Festival)- UK\n\n3. GENERAL INFORMATION Box office Budget- $3 million Domestic Total Gross: $5,922,292 Profit: $2,922,292\n\n4. COMPANY CREDITS Production companies BBC Films (presents) UK Film Council (presents) Limelight Communication (in association with) (presents) (as Limelight) ContentFilm Kasander Film Company The funding came from BBC Films and UK Film Council Distributors Artificial eye Syrena Film IFC Films Cineart Alta Films Mongrel media MK2 Diffusion Canana Films SP Films Nutopia Entertainment Film 1\n\n6. MARKETING There is a trailer on IMDB and YouTube. Also there is several interviews on the internet.\n\n7. AUDIENCE The main target audience of this film is the UK. This is because the content shows UK in a negative way. Other countries especially America don’t recognize or see this side of the UK therefore would struggle to understand and relate to the film. The classification for this film is 15 because of the strong language and violence being used however in context. The film ‘Fish Tank’ was a critic film therefore targeting the age range of 30- 40 year olds.\n\n8. AWARDS- 20- WINS 22- NOMINATIONS BAFTA AWARDS- 2010 Won- Alexander Korda Award for the best British film- Kees Kasander, Nick Laws and Andrea Arnold. AFI FEST 2009 Won- New light competition- Andrea Arnold BODIL AWARDS 2011 Nominated- Bodil- Best Non- American Film- Andrea Arnold Won- British independent Film awards- most promising new comer- Katie Jarvis\n\n9. TECHNOLOGY\n\n10. ISSUES RAISED WITH NATIONAL AND LOCAL AUDIENCES – FISH TANK Fish tank’s targeted audience is a British audience this is because of where the film is set. The film is set in mainly Iavaering and Tilbury which are in London this is a location most British people are aware of. The main protagonist ‘Katie Jarvis’ house in the film is a council estate flat which is stereotypically a house for the working class this shows that British working class will find it easy to relate to this film. The reason Americans would not find this film appealing for them is because they know London for the sights and the Monarchy therefore in this film by teenagers wearing hoodies and tracksuits to be classified as a ‘Chav’ walking round fighting and using bad language for example ‘Cunt’ in London would shock Americans as they don’t know the negative side of London only the positive. There is also no well known actors/actresses in ‘Fish Tank’ where as Americans watch films because they know the cast very well."
