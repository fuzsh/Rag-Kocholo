        "text": "Watching, reading, listening … and writing Films\n\nDortmund school students present their own subtitles\n\nEarly evening in the middle of nowhere, UK. In the pub, Zoe is trying to revive the interest of a former lover while her four small children – stomachs rumbling – hang around outside. Wasp is a sensitive and critically astute milieu study.\n\nAt this year’s festival, we will be watching the original version of the film in English with German subtitles. What’s special is this: the subtitles were composed by Year 11 school students at Dortmund’s Max Planck Senior High School. The film was the subject of a special project during which the students analysed the film in detail and translated the English into German. In that process, they were supported by members of the Oberhausen-based Sehsternchen, a cultural education agency. The students themselves will present the eagerly awaited results to an audience made up of friends, co-students, relatives and other guests. An intriguing look into the significance of the spoken language for film and into the way subtitles are created.\n\nWith kind support of Kurzfilmagentur Hamburg.\n\nThe project is based on an idea of the Forum Filmbildung NRW.\n\nAwards for ›Wasp‹\n\nOscar, Best Live Action Short Film, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 2005\n\nAndrea Arnold\n\nAndrea Arnold began her career aged 18 as a roller-skating presenter of the British children’s TV show No 73, before studying directing at the American Film Institute in Los Angeles. She won numerous awards with her first short film Milk, and went on to receive an Oscar for Wasp in 2005. Andrea Arnold can look back on an outstanding body of work. Her first feature film, the thriller Red Road (2006), won the Jury Prize in Cannes, as did two other films Fish Tank (2009) and American Honey (2016). Fish Tank also earned the British Academy Award for Best British Film of the Year in 2010. Cow is Arnold’s first foray into documentary film-making.\n\nFilms by Andrea Arnold (Selection)\n\nBig Little Lies 2019 | American Honey 2016 | Wuthering Heigths 2011 | Fish Tank 2009 | Red Road 2006 | Coming Up 2003 | Wasp 2003 | Dog 2001 | Milk 1998 | Hotel Babylon 1996"
