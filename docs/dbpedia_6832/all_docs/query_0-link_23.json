        "text": "1. Fish Tank A Case Study\n\n2. The film had a budget of 2 million pounds and was shot in 30 days. The UK Film Council partly funded the film, they gave £70,000. • It is unknown how much actors get paid for being in an independent film but there are 3 known ways in which it can be approached: • Pay the actors up front • Give Credit Only or Credit and a Copy of the Film • No Upfront pay, but Deferred pay on the backend per certain conditions. Independent film Directors tend to get less money than big budget Directors. It varies on each film.\n\n3. • Director: Andrea Arnold • Writer: Andrea Arnold • Producers: Kees Kasander, Lisette Kelder, Christine Langan, Nick Laws, David M. Thompson, Paul Trijbits • Andrea Arnold has previously directed Red Road (2006). • Christine Langan and David M. Thompson have previously produced The Duchess (2008) • Paul Trijbits has previously produced This Is England (2006) and London To Brighton (2006).\n\n4. • Production Companies: • BBC Films • UK Film Council • Limelight Communication • ContentFilm • Kasander Film Company The funding came from BBC Films and the UK Film Council.\n\n5. • Distributors • Artificial Eye • Cinéart • MK2 Diffusion • Nutopia Entertainment • Syrena Films • Alta Films • Canana Films • Film1 • IFC Films • Mongrel Media • SP Films\n\n6. • There is a trailer for the film it is featured on IMDB and YouTube. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg1yMOdjy p0 • There are also video interviews on the internet http://www.cinemablend.com/new/exclusive- video-interview-fish-tank-s-michael-fassbender- 16514.html • http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueBcEWZ4_ eU\n\n7. • There is more than one poster promoting the film.\n\n8. • As you can see the main character Katie Jarvis who plays Mia Williams, is the main image of all these posters. This is obvious she is the main selling point of the film. • The film was shown at the Cannes Film Festival on the 14th May 2009 and gained great word of mouth and reviews. It was also shown at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on the 21st June 2009. It has also been shown Karlovy Vary Film Festival (10th July 2009), Jerusalem Film Festival (17th July 2009), Motovun Film Festival (27th July 2009), Sarajevo Film Festival (18th August 2009), Telluride Film Festival (4th September 2009), Toronto International Film Festival (11th September 2009), Helsinki International Film Festival (19th September 2009), Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival (25th September 2009), Pusan International Film Festival (9th October 2009), Warsaw Film Festival (10th October 2009), Mill Valley Film Festival (10th October 2009), Chicago International Film Festival (14th October 2009), Gent International Film Festival (15th October 2009), São Paulo International Film Festival (23rd October 2009), Vienna International Film Festival (28th October 2009), AFI Film Festival (2nd November 2009), Starz Denver Film Festival (19th November 2009), Stockholm International Film Festival (27th November 2009), Palm Springs International Film Festival (8th January 2010) and the Hong Kong International Film Festival (22nd March 2010). • The film got an arthouse release.\n\n9. • The tag line of the film is “Live, love and give as good as you get”. There are a few trailers that vary slightly that were released on the Internet and shown in the cinema. • Most of the websites I have looked at have given the film four out of five stars. • The film has been nominated and won many awards: • BAFTA Award (WON) for Outstanding British Film • British Independent Film Awards (WON) for Best Director Andrea Arnold • British Independent Film Awards (WON) for Most Promising Newcomer Katie Jarvis • British Independent Film Awards (NOMINATED) for Best Actress Katie Jarvis • British Independent Film Awards (NOMINATED) for Best British Independent Film\n\n10. • As you can see these are all the festivals above that it was shown at. This is one of the big ways independent filmmakers promote their film. • On the first opening weekend in the UK the film made £103,180. Then it made £254,248 (20th September 2009), after it made £346,666 (27th September 2009), Lastly it made £413,266(4th October 2009). These figures are for the first three weeks of the film’s release."
