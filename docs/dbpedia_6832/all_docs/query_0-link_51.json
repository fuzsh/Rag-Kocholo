        "text": "The Cinema Extreme short film programme will not be issuing any further calls for new applications .\n\nSince it launched in 2002 the scheme has been hugely successful and both the UK Film Council and Film4, the joint funders of the programme, are incredibly proud of all the filmmakers who have made films through the scheme including Andrea Arnold ( Wasp , Red Road , Fish Tank ), Duane Hopkins ( Love Me or Leave Me Alone , Better Things ) and Jens Jonsson ( A Changed Man, The King of Ping Pong) , and the hard work and support that has been provided by The Bureau in managing the Cinema Extreme programme and by Lifesize Pictures in managing it on behalf of the UK Film Council.\n\nThe New Cinema Fund of the UK Film Council will continue to support short filmmaking through short film schemes such as Digital Shorts, Digital Nation, Completion Fund and its support of the Virgin Shorts Competition and continues to work with first time feature filmmakers through its production funds. The UK Film Council's Development Fund offers support to first time filmmakers through the First Feature Film Development Programme.\n\nFilm4 and the UK Film Council will continue to work together to support new talent and short film makers, and Film4 remains committed to developing and funding short film making talent through its development budget."
