        "text": "#HealthEquality In 2017 I set out to transform a certain part of womenâ€™s health care; early intervention to perinatal mental health. We had three main goals. Let women know 1. They werenâ€™t going mad 2. Where to get help and 3. Connect them with peers It takes more to have a product that works, developed with healthcare professionals and technologists to make it in the entrepreneurial world! Itâ€™s takes capital, investment and a moment in time. Proud of my contribution to government, public health and industry policy and procedures at the time and the community of women who supported our mission. Most importantly for me was that we helped 10,000 women here in NI to get the knowledge and support they needed. We helped educate healthcare professionals on how they best support and treat women at this stage of life and at that time we made maternal mental health mainstream. All of this work was the outworkings of robust feedback and research of the challenges the system and stakeholders within it face to support women, the stigma associated with having a baby and not feeling on top of the world and ultimately to enable health care workers and women to get an evidence based plan to help and support. Funding. Knowledge. Understanding. That journey has inspired a lot of the work I do today and Iâ€™m delighted to finally see investment and focus on womenâ€™s health as a priority. Not just performative action. Fast forward to now we have more awareness, help and support for womenâ€™s health in general but the gaps are still huge. This survey below is so important to affect a holistic change in support of womenâ€™s health. We should not have to rely on marketing campaigns from celebrities to bring awareness to issues. So itâ€™s really important that initiatives like this from the Community Foundation Northern Ireland get answered. They need the data and the widespread diversity of it to be able to bring a womenâ€™s health strategy to government. This may not seem like progress but it really is â€¦. #womenshealth Thanks Nadine Campbell BA(Hons) DipM for sharing this with me.\n\nHelp create a statewide Direct Care Worker (DCW) credential to increase DCW career options!

Please consider sharing this opportunity with your network, or directly with people and organizations who have valuable insights to share, as their contributions will help inform advocacy and recommendations to improve services for rural families. This is particularly important in light of the fact that less than 30% of eligible rural children are benefitting from programs like the Canada Learning Bond, which is supposed to help them in their learning goals - yet, no one appears to have really spent a lot of time finding out why this is the case. If youâ€™re a rurally located, low-income parent or guardian, living anywhere in Canada, you could win a $50 Amazon Gift Card just for sharing your experiences saving for your childrenâ€™s post-secondary education.
