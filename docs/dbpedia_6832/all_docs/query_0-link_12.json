        "text": "Social realist genre:\n\nAims to show the world portrayed in the film in a realistic way.\n\nFish Tank shows the lives of poor working class people in a council estate.\n\nValues substance over style (hidden and deeper meanings in the film)\n\nBudget of only £3 million\n\nSet in unglamorous and gritty locations, to add to realism.\n\nFilm Form in opening scene:\n\nMise-en-Scene:\n\nCostume:\n\nMade by U.K. Film council- low budget studio, about the poorest people in England.\n\nCostume: Cheap, plain and baggy grey tracksuit. Shows how poor she and implies that she doesn't care about his appearance which is atypical to the assumption that women always care about their appearance.\n\nMia fulfils young council estate stereotype by wearing the tracksuit as well as the chain and earrings. She represents typical young person in council estate.\n\nLack of clothing in dance scene creates negative representation of lower class and higher classes my look down on them for wearing such revealing clothes and dancing in that manner in public.\n\nLighting and Colour:\n\nMia starts out of breath and alone- suggests that she is isolated also highkey lighting in background contrasted with low key lighting in the building that Mia's in. This suggests the highkey lighting represents the the world and the lowkey lighting represents the Mia and lower class. Implies that lower classes are kept in the background and aren't focused on by the rest of the world.\n\nWorld around Mia is light and whilst she is trapped in the dark room suggests that she will try to escape this \"Fish Tank\" and go to the light.\n\nActor placement and movement:\n\nMia shouts aggressively at her friends dad and this unelegant and rough sociolect isn't associated with upper middle classes and they may look down on this disrespectful behaviour.\n\nShe walks with her head down, this suggests she lacks confidence and is unhappy in her area.\n\nMakeup:\n\nMinimal make up used which makes film seem more real and edgier as we are seeing character directly not behind a face full of makeup.\n\nStereotype of lower class who don't care about their appearance.\n\nHair is tied up messily.\n\nProps:\n\nLack of props which suggests that Mia can't afford much\n\nCheap simple drawstring bag which shows. Lower class have a lack of income and therefore they have lower employment rates.\n\nUses stone to throw at the window, implies that lower classes are more aggressive in nature.\n\nSetting:\n\nDull, grey council estate.\n\nPlayground- associated with happiness and innocence yet there are girls who are dancing half naked suggests that lot's of immoral deeds take place in these estates.\n\nKids Sunbathing- usually done on holiday, shows that kids are trapped in council estates they can't afford to leave. They do everything in the estate.\n\nCinematography:\n\nMia's silhouette against the background of the city behind her shows that she in trapped in the dark room (the metaphorical 'Fish Tank').\n\nHandheld camera follows Mia which gives a documentary style to film. Shows that the film will examine Mia's life. Typical convention of social realist films.\n\nLong shot of dancing girls followed by medium shot of Mia, this implies that she is isolated by society and doesn't have many friends or that she is hostile to people in general (backed up by previous scene where she shout's at Katie's dad).\n\nSound:\n\nDiegetic sound- In the world of the film e.g. dialogue\n\nNon-Diegetic sound- outside of the world of fill added by editiors. e.g. narration\n\nLack of non-diegetic sound makes film seem awkward as we are encouraged to actively engage with the film by thinking about the social issues presented.\n\nAlso allows us to identify with Mia as we can hear and see everything she does clearly.\n\nLack of non diegetic sound makes spectators uncomfortable e.g Mia's heavy breathing.\n\nMain diegetic sound in opening of hip hop beat which foreshadows that dancing will be an important part of the film.\n\nTodorov's Theory:\n\nFish Tank doesn't fit Todorov's theory perfectly as there are multiple disequilibrium's throughout the story which fits with the aim of the film. It is a social realist film and it aims to portray life in the estate as realistically as possible. It does this by introducing many disequilibrium's because in life you are constantly faced with many challenges which have to be overcome. This is an effective way of showing life in the estates accurately yet the director Andrea Arnold runs the risk of losing spectators who wish to passively engage with the film as the lack of a clear equilibrium is unclear and therefore the film becomes more complicated as we don't know what Mia is trying to resolve precisely.\n\nTwo main Interpretations:\n\nInner Equilibrium when dancing alone in Building.\n\nDisequilibrium is her environment and her conflict with her mother.\n\nShe goes after Conor as he was making her life better\n\nAfter finding out truth about Conor she makes plans to leave estate with the boy\n\nOpen ending where she leaves for Wale"
