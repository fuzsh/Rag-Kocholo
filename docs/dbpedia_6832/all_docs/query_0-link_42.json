        "text": "On Monday it was announced that the UK Film Council will be abolished. Everyone in the UK film industry and most UK fans are heavily annoyed as it means film production in the UK might fall due to this huge cutback. In the 10 years they have been running the UK Film Council has funded 900 films, that's how much of an impact they have on the industry.\n\nI'm extremely shocked by the announcement, it just doesn't make much sense. There does seem to be a few petitions etc knocking around but whether they will actually make a difference is probably very unlikely.\n\nWhat do you make of the decision?\n\nI posted my rant in the \"Now Showing\" topic the other day, so here it is:\n\nYou may have heard about the UK Film Council being scrapped by the Government. I'm outraged. It costs the government only £15 million to operate as it is funded heavily by lottery funding, and they go scrap it?\n\nOk, it may not be the most \"needed\" of sectors (Heath and Education come first blah, blah..), but when it profits from £5 for every £1 put into it, why should such an important institution for the UK film industry be simply removed with little or no sense?! UK Film output is at it's highest ever and this is predominately due to the UKFC.\n\nThe UKFC has supported hundreds of great British films, established and reinforced waves of UK talent in both film-making and acting talent - Kiera Knightly and Shane Meadows for example. The decision has no logic, has little support from backbenchers, nor does it posses any future stability for the UK film industry. I'm quite angry and appalled.\n\n[/rant]\n\nI'm still quite pissed off.\n\nIf the UK Film Council was never set up, the chances are we would have never had the films:\n\nBend it like Beckham, Bright Star, The Constant Gardener, Fish Tank, Gosford Park, Happy-Go-Lucky, In the Loop, The Last King of Scotland, Man on Wire, Nowhere Boy, Red Road, St Trinian's, This is England, Touching the Void, Vera Drake ,The Wind That Shakes the Barley and Streetdance 3D.\n\nAdmittedly, I have not seen a few of these, but some of them are real gems and simply amazing films.\n\nI have tbh I cannot stand a lot of British films. I am sure if the film is good they could get backing like other film makers get.\n\nI watched Bend it Like Beckam, the film done well. Did they have to pay back the money that they used to fun the film? I did not like the film but many did.\n\nIn a way we are paying for the film to be made and then paying again to see the film.\n\nSeeing that many people have lost their jobs, taken pay cuts etc I am sorry but in a way this has to be cut\n\n£15 million a year can go towards more police, hospital care etc.\n\nmarc said:\n\n£15 million a year can go towards more police, hospital care etc.\n\nAccording to Slayed, they make £5 for every £1 spent so they're actually making money. I've not bothered to research further so I'll take his word cus he's clued up on this sort of stuff.\n\nI agree with Spicy, looking at the past films, it's not worth saving.\n\nBesides, if there are people that believe in it, perhaps they could club together and keep it running as a private business. There is no room for \"unnecessary\" ventures nowadays, even if it's making money, and a UK Film Council is unnecessary. The state should provoide only what is necessary, like telling parents that their kids are fat. :roll:\n\nI'm kind of with Ian on this one.\n\nWhile there is absolute value in producing films this way, and it can encourage the UK to produce new talent - £15 million to run and it makes £5 for every £1 spent?\n\nWell, it can run itself then surely? If it's making so much profit, then it can self fund? If not, ask the people backing this to invest some of their hundreds of millions into it? If it helped make Kiera Knightly, then she can give a bit back maybe?\n\nI think it's important, but not as important as keeping MP's moats clean!"
