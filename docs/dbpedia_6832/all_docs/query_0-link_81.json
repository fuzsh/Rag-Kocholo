        "text": "by Allan Fish\n\n(UK 2009 121m) DVD1/2\n\nGetting wasted\n\np Kees Kasander d/w Andrea Arnold ph Robbie Ryan ed Nicolas Chaudeurge art Helen Scott\n\nKatie Jarvis (Mia Williams), Michael Fassbender (Connor O’Reilly), Kierston Wareing (Joanne), Rebecca Griffiths (Tyler), Sarah Bayes (Keeley), Charlotte Collins (Sophie), Harry Treadaway (Billy), Brooke Hobby (London),\n\nThere’s a moment in Andrea Arnold’s Cannes success where the young protagonist, seemingly for want of anything better to do, states “let’s get wasted!” A common cry for a generation of what we have come colloquially to know as chavs and the usually depicted stereotypical attributes and accessories are there – attitude, language out of a sewer, hoodies, track suits, trainers, bling, daytime TV, cheap 12 inch portable TVs with built in DVD players and mothers not worthy of the title. In America they’re cheap white trash or trailer park class, over here it’s suburban council estates with the soul drained out of them till everyone is the same shade of grey as the vandalised one-time playgrounds round the corner. Any greenery there once was has turned to wasteland, and those who wander around this desolate place are wasted in more ways than one.\n\nTake Mia Williams, the fifteen year old seriously angry daughter of a mother who probably had her when she was Mia’s age and has been living for the next benefit cheque and temporary boyfriend ever since. Kids, they just get in the way, both Mia and her younger sister, Tyler, who has already (and she’s no older than 11) taken to smoking and drinking. Mia has but one escape and that’s a love of hip-hop dancing. Truth be told, she’s hardly anything special, but she’s never been taught, never had anyone take an interest in her to encourage her in anything. That is until mum gets a new boyfriend, Connor, who takes a shine to Mia initially in a protective way, only for things to then take a turn for the complicated.\n\nMuch has been said about Andrea Arnold’s debt to Ken Loach, but in truth it doesn’t feel much like a Loach film and there are larger debts owed to Alan Clarke and, more recently, Shane Meadows, but here we have a woman director with, as in her earlier success Red Road, a female protagonist. If there’s a bigger influence still than all of the above, however, it must surely be the Dardenne Brothers for, though the sex is more explicit than you’ll ever see from Jean-Pierre and Luc, the similarities other than that could not be more potent, especially the eponymous protagonist in Rosetta. Both central protagonists are caught in a prison cell, but as the title suggests Mia’s has a view. She knows she wants out, but not merely for the sake of getting out. She wants to be noticed, wants someone to care enough so she can care enough about herself.\n\nAll of which could so easily descend into cliché, and indeed its plot does navigate its way through some rather clichéd developments, and yet it’s shot through with such an arrow-straight sense of documentary realism that it cuts to the quick. Watching it is like watching Kes forty years ago. It’s a cry out, a despairing banging of the head against the prefab walls. It’s raw, explicit, and owes much to the art-house cinema than it does to home-grown product – take, for example, the disturbing child kidnap sequence along the Thames estuary, which so uncannily evokes the plot of Dorota Kedzierzawska’s Crows. As for the characters, there’s no black and white here, not least Fassbender’s Connor, a complex figure of both good and bad elements and somewhere in between, and giving Fassbender further opportunity to deepen the impression made in Hunger. Note also the tenderness of his scenes with newcomer Jarvis, who turns from feral to vulnerable at the drop of a hat, as likely to hug you as head-butt you, reduced to instinctive acts of retribution, starting with breaking into Connor’s home, dropping the trademark track suit to pee on his carpet and degenerating from there through the aforementioned fraught kidnapping to the inevitable breaking point in a field at night. Let’s have no more comparisons; Arnold isn’t another Ken Loach, she’s more than that; she’s herself."
