        "text": "‘Beyond The Box Office’ was a presentation and debate which addressed the cultural impact and relevance of film. The discussion centred around Stories We Tell Ourselves, a study conducted by the UK Film Council in June 2009. In 2007, the UK Film Council Board proposed that more material needed to be produced analysing the cultural impact of film, as a great deal of research into the value of film concerned itself with economic rather than cultural capital. The resulting study raised a number of significant questions, such as how we define ‘culture’ and ‘cultural impact’, and whether it’s even possible to measure abstractions of this nature.\n\nThe following speakers attended:\n\n(time of appearance in brackets)\n\nCaroline Norbury (00:00:17)\n\nCaroline Norbury has been Chief Executive of South West Screen since the agency’s launch in 2001 and has extensive experience in the Media industry as Producer, Director and Commissioning Executive.
