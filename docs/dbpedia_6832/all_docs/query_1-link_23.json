Fab day, such knowledgeable staff. No question was too much. The dive show was fantastic! Excellent work for a self funded charity.”\n\nSarah - Truro\n\n“I’ve been to a few aquariums and this was by far the best! Took us two hours to get round so well worth the money. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable! And you get to return for free within a year. My children are 8,10 and 15 and all were impressed.”\n\nSammi Jo - Cornwall\n\n“Britain’s biggest and in my opinion best aquarium! Really worth a visit if in Plymouth or grown ups and children. The staff are extremely knowledgeable and happy to share their knowledge and answer questions. The aquarium has the biggest tank and glass window of a tank that I’ve ever seen where you could sit and watch the fish all day long!”\n\nBecks - Swindon"
