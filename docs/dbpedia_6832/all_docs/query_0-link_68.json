        "text": "Tanya Seghatchian has resigned from her post as head of the Film Fund at the BFI, the UK's principal agency for the distribution of Lottery finance to film-makers.\n\nSince joining the UK Film Council as head of development in 2007, Seghatchian has overseen two major reorganisations: the merging of the UK Film Council's disparate development and production offices into a single unified Film Fund in 2010, and the subsequent transfer of the Film Fund's operation to the BFI when the UK Film Council was closed down in 2011.\n\nSeghatchian said in a statement: \"Having overseen the transition of the Film Fund from the UK Film Council to the BFI, I feel that it's time for someone else to be the public-sector champion for the remarkable film-making talent we have in the UK, and I wish the BFI every success in the future.\"\n\nSeghatchian's successes at the UK Film Council and BFI included providing backing for The King's Speech, Bright Star, Fish Tank, In the Loop, and Submarine. Amanda Nevill, CEO of the BFI, said: \"Tanya has made a huge contribution to the UK film industry. She brings a rare balance of independence of vision, commercial instinct and cultural understanding, and she has a real eye for backing talent.\""
