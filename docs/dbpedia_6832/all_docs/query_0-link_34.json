        "text": "I was on my way home from a meeting with David Thompson at Origin Films about a project called Granny Made Me an Anarchist when I got news of the government's intention to abolish the Film Council. My first thought was for the people at the Film Council who were going to lose their jobs – never a pleasant prospect and at this time a lot more unpleasant. My second thought – and it will be one shared by just about every writer, director and producer I know in the UK – was: what does this mean for my project? Because, put simply, if it hadn't been for the Film Council, the project wouldn't exist.\n\nAbout 18 months ago, my friend, the journalist Duncan Campbell, persuaded me that Stuart Christie's memoir Granny Made Me an Anarchist was ideal for making into a film. I travelled to New York, to the offices of a production company known not just for getting movies made, but for making films with a certain edge and risk: the kind of films studios tend to be nervous of. An executive at the company – a highly educated, movie-literate thirtysomething – had sounded me out on two previous projects and, although I'd passed on them, we got on well and stayed in touch.\n\nWhether they are made over lunch at a fancy restaurant or over the coffee table of an office, film pitches have their own ritual. They usually begin with some industry small talk, an anecdote or two about a director or actor you know in common, followed by mutual inquiries about things in the pipeline. Then there's a little mutual flattery – they say how much they liked your script for such-and-such; you say how much you admired one or more of their movies. Then, when everyone's relaxed, you settle down to business.\n\nSome writers would rather tear their toenails out than pitch. I wouldn't go that far. For most of us, how we feel during the pitch depends on how the idea seems to be going down. If it's going well, if you sense there is interest or excitement in the room, you tend to find your tongue. Conversely, apathy can make it seem like you are defending a very long and very lost war.\n\nThat afternoon in New York, I outlined the basics: \"This is a true story, set in the early 60s. It's about an 18-year-old boy from Glasgow who travels to Madrid to assassinate General Franco.\" I plunged on, ticking off the elements I thought would be part of the movie's appeal: we'd have a great soundtrack; it would be part-road movie, part-unusual coming of age story. There would be idealism, politics, humour, sex . . .\n\nIt wasn't apathy I sensed. It was something else. Confusion. The executive had started to look worried. He interrupted: \"This boy Stuart is going to assassinate who?\"\n\n\"General Franco.\"\n\nHe looked at me. There was a pause. \"Now I know I should know this,\" he began uncertainly, \"but who is General Franco?\"\n\nI explained that General Francisco Franco was one of three brutal fascist dictators who came to power in Europe between the wars. The other – Franco's friends Hitler and Mussolini – had been dealt with. Franco, however, lived on, his regime built on terror, torture, mass murder, and support from Britain, the US and the west. A handful of outlawed anarchist and communist organisations continued to resist Franco. Many of their supporters died horribly in Franco's prisons and torture chambers. In 1963, Stuart Christie, inspired by a mix of Orwell, the International Brigades and a grandmother who had drummed into him the importance of standing up for the underdog, got involved in a desperate and rather amateurish conspiracy to bring about regime change in Spain by blowing up its detested leader and figurehead.\n\nThe executive nodded slowly. \"What did you say this guy's name was?\"\n\n\"Franco.\"\n\n\"Franco. Right.\"\n\nI knew I was in the wrong room.\n\nBack in London, I called Tanya Seghatchian at the UK Film Council. Duncan and I met her a short time later in the Film Council's offices in Little Portland Street, along with her executives Chris Collins and Bradley Quirk. There was no need to explain to them who or what Franco was. What Tanya, Chris and Bradley wanted to know was how we would approach the underlying material in Stuart's book, how we would shape the film's narrative, how we would avoid exposition, how we would engage the audience. The usual things you talk about when discussing the viability of a film idea. Soon afterwards, we received a formal offer of development money from the Film Council. Duncan and I got writing, and the project now enjoys the healthy support of Tessa Ross at Film4.\n\nYesterday, however, within minutes of my latest meeting about the film ending, I was getting calls, texts and emails from friends and collaborators in the industry. Everyone was asking the same questions: what does the scrapping of the Film Council mean for us? What does it mean for our projects? What does it mean for the film industry in the UK? Everyone is stunned, and no one quite understands what's going to happen next. Will lottery money still be used to fund British film? If so, who will administer it and how? Or does the government intend to cut funding altogether?\n\nNo one I've spoken to is encouraged by the line in culture secretary Jeremy Hunt's statement that reads: \"The changes I have proposed today would help us deliver fantastic culture, media and sport, while ensuring value for money for the public and transparency about where taxpayers' money is spent.\"\n\nDo they take us for fools? This is doublespeak. Obviously I have personal reason to be grateful to the Film Council – indeed, I have a second project with it – but I am not alone. Every single writer, director and producer I know in this country considers the Film Council essential to film-making in the UK. Along with BBC Films and Film4, the Film Council was the main port of call for those of us trying to get feature films off the ground, especially if those films tended, like Granny, to be outside the mainstream.\n\nIt was staffed not by bureaucrats but by people who had made films, who loved film, who knew film-makers and understood their struggles. And they were good at what they did, as any rollcall of Film Council-supported movies demonstrates: Vera Drake, The Last King of Scotland, My Summer of Love, Bend it Like Beckham, Fish Tank, to name but a few. For everyone £1 of lottery money invested, British films are reckoned to generate £5 at the box office.\n\nOne criticism of the coalition's proposed spending cuts is that their severity will cause a double-dip recession. With the axing of the Film Council, the rug is being pulled out from underneath the industry. Economically, everyone from writers to caterers, actors to electricians, producers to taxi drivers will feel the impact. Culturally, this crass, narrow, bigoted move impoverishes us all.\n\n'I'm reeling from the shock'\n\nBritish film's leading figures react\n\nAlex Cox, director\n\nIt's very good news for anyone involved in independent film. The Film Council became a means by which lottery money was transferred to the Hollywood studios. It pursued this phoney idea that James Bond and Harry Potter were British films. But, of course, those films were all American – and their profits were repatriated to the studios in Los Angeles.\n\nJohn Hurt, actor\n\nThis has come as a huge surprise, and it will take time to comprehend all the implications. While it is important to pay tribute to the fantastic work the UK Film Council has done, I would hope we have the opportunity to continue that work by developing a positive and direct relationship with government.\n\nRebecca O'Brien, producer\n\nThis is going to affect not just new film-makers, but established ones too. The government is saying there will still be the lottery funding, but it's the distribution that is key. That is a dark art as it is, but to axe the current system with no idea how to go forward is outrageous.\n\nMike Leigh, director\n\nI'm reeling from the shock. This comes totally from left-field. I'm not only concerned for my own films, but as chairman of the governors of the London Film School. The Film Council has been very involved in aspects of what we do – and that, suddenly, is directly affected.\n\nMike Figgis, director\n\nI am deeply disappointed but not that surprised – we were just waiting for the axe to fall. I'm interested that the DCMS says it wants to build a more direct link between the British Film Institute and government – I thought its whole thing was detaching government from interfering with the running of our culture. They don't strike me as people who understand the film business, or even the culture business.\n\nInterviews by Patrick Kingsley"
