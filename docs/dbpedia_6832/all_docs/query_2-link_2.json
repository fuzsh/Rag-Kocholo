        "text": "Background\n\nThe UK Film Council was a non-departmental public body set up in 2000 to develop and promote the film industry in the UK. It was constituted as a private company limited by guarantee, owned by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, and governed by a board of 15 directors. It closed on 31 March 2011, with many of its functions passing to the British Film Institute.\n\nFilm Council\n\nLogo (2001-2003)\n\nVisuals: The vertical crack opens in the screen, and the name slides out in both directions, surrounded by blue rays. The \"FILM\" goes left and \"COUNCIL\" slides right. Then the glow fades.\n\nTechnique: 2D animation.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAvailability: It was seen on Bodysong and Intermission.\n\nUK Film Council\n\n1st Logo (2003-2011, 2012)\n\nVisuals: First, the National Lottery \"Awarding funds from\" sign appears on the bottom of the screen. Then the vertical crack opens in the middle and blue rays beam to the sides. The name slides from the crack like in the previous logo, only \"UK\" part is added. After this, the blue glow fades and the crack closes to the small mark.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn some trailers, the lottery mark appears next to the logo (as seen on the third picture).\n\nDuring the first year, the Awarding funds from The National Lottery disclaimer was not seen.\n\nTechnique: 2D computer animation.\n\nAudio: None or the opening theme to the movie.\n\nAvailability: Seen on some movies from this era. All future films now have the British Film Institute logo since 2011.\n\n2nd Logo (May 21, 2010-July 29, 2011)\n\nVisuals: Same as the previous logo, but with improved effects and the letters are in 3D now. The blue flash does not disappear but retains until the logo fades.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: The opening theme to the movie.\n\nAvailability: Only seen on two films Streetdance 3D and Horrid Henry: The Movie."
