        "text": "What do you mean you cannot see the point of joining the Documentary Film Council? You make documentaries! In 1992, 1993, and 1994, I produced one documentary feature film each year, all outside the established funding sources. Someone compiling statistics for the BFI on real independent films said that for that brief time, I was the most prolific UK producer of feature docs. One broke even, another one grossed almost ten times its budget (mainly from the VHS market), and even though I jointly carried out the distribution, the net was just over double the budget, which, because it was shared between seventeen people, the \"profit\" was tiny. The third film lost every single penny. The reality of going it alone. I was forced to stop because no investor would back me, given the poor odds of success. In those days, there was no soft money or tax breaks for docs. For whatever reason, of the 29 documentaries I have produced, only one had broadcast funding, but that had nothing to do with me. It was down to Jerry Rothwell Jonny Persey and Al Morrow. I just tagged along for the ride. Even when Gordon Brown changed the tax laws in 1997, and Sale & Leaseback made films attractive as a tax break for the alleged £6 billion put into British films, I do not know one single documentary film that benefitted. I know I tried. The tax deal was structured in such a way that only films costing millions were viable for all the lawyers and accountants I talked to. As one of them said to me, \"David, we can't take a £250,000 fee from a documentary with a budget of £250,000\". He meant it as a joke but it was also very true. Keith Williams, the former Head of Drama Plays at the BBC (he commissioned around 80 TV plays and films every year), was at a big drama event in the mid 1990s, and a leading UK industry figure remarked, \"David Wilkinson's career must be going badly. He is now having to do documentaries\". Second-class films. 30 years on, documentary feature films have become equal to drama. Although factual does not match fiction box office wise the impact of so many documentaries can be far greater. That said, several key people I spoke to did not think ERIC RAVILIOUS - DRAWN TO WAR would do well in the cinema. I have released over 100 feature films in the UK and I have never released film in the cinema that has come close to what that doc achieved. Documentaries have come of age, but those of us who make them still have to fight to be heard. We live in extraordinarily troubling times. Documentaries can be the voice of reason and education, and the world needs them more than ever now. In the 55 years I have been in this industry, The Documentary Film Council is the organisation I have always been looking for. It's only a pity it has come so late in my career. Join. It's only £24 per annum. (This must go up soon). #documentaries #documentaryfilmcouncil #drawntowar #margykinmonth"
