        "text": "Goldfish will need to be kept in a water temperature of 10-21Â°C.\n\nMost other fish need a tank heater with a thermostat set to the correct temperature for their species.\n\nTheir small size isn't big enough, for example, goldfish require at least 60 litres of water each. Small volumes don't provide a stable environment for the fish to live in.\n\nThere isn't enough space for an efficient filter, so waste products can't be removed.\n\nThe low surface area means that not enough oxygen will be absorbed into the water.\n\nTemperature levels can alter rapidly, which can cause stress and even death."
