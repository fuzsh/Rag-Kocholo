        "text": "Transcript\n\nInterview\n\nInterview with Alice Baber\n\nConducted by Paul Cummings\n\nOn Broadway in New York City\n\nMay 24, 1973\n\nPreface\n\nThe following oral history transcript is the result of a tape-recorded interview with Alice Baber on May 24, 1973. The interview took place in New York City, and was conducted by Paul Cummings for the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.\n\n[Throughout the interview, there is considerable traffic (and construction?) noise, diminishing the quality of this recording and hence my confidence in the accuracy of the transcription.]\n\nInterview\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It's the 24th of May, 1973, Paul Cummings talking to Alice Baber in her studio on Broadway. [That's not so bad. Let's not go back.] You were born in Illinois, right?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: To start with. [meaning to start the interview with]\n\nALICE BABER: To start with.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Where's Charleston?\n\nALICE BABER: Central Illinois. Where can I say? Sort of right in the middle state, but on [the] eastern border.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: All right. It's not a big town [all right], isn't it, not big?\n\nALICE BABER: No, Charleston was really not my home town. It was a town. It was a town that some of my mother's family had come from, but it was [not] the largest town to be born in.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] Well, you didn't grow up there, then?\n\nALICE BABER: I'm really from Kansas, Illinois.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, from Kansas, Illinois.\n\nALICE BABER: Kansas is a tiny town of 900 persons, but I really didn't grow up in Kansas either, I grew up in Miami, Florida. Sort of going back and forth between Florida and Illinois.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So, what were you, just born in Charleston?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yes. Born in Charleston, and then my family took me to a town which was the other side of Kansas, which is a town about the size of Charleston called [Catus], Illinois. We lived there for a couple of years, then we started going back and forth to Miami.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How old were you, about, when the Miami activity began?\n\nALICE BABER: When I was two.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, so it was right away. [chuckles]\n\nALICE BABER: Yes.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: And how long did you go back and forth?\n\nALICE BABER: Until the War. And then we couldn't go anymore.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So, you were what, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen?\n\nALICE BABER: Something like that.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, how did you like this, living in two places?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I liked it very much. First of all, when we went in the early days, we went by tent and that had a certain kind of romance. And later I always felt a bit like a nomad. I liked the.... [In a] way I liked the idea of uprooting myself every year, but I also had the slightly uncomfortable feeling of not belonging to any one place. But that had advantages too.\n\nBABER, ALICE\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Do you have brothers and sisters?\n\nALICE BABER: I have one sister who is [three, two] years older than I am.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: And why did your family travel all the time? Was it....\n\nALICE BABER: Well, it was really my fault because I was ill.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] Oh, really?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. And the doctor suggested that we go south.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: For the wintertime?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. Which, of course, doctors don't do now. But that was a long time ago.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So you summered up north and wintered in Florida?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, we did, except that eventually we started really living in the South. We lived in a part of Miami that was near the Everglades in those days.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Whereabouts was that?\n\nALICE BABER: It was near the [Hialeah] Race Track. It was 79th Street. Of course, it's now sort of the middle of Miami, but in those days it was right on the edge, in the middle of the avocados and.... [laughs]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Country still?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, very much so.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, how did that affect your school, your education? Or was it all in Florida as you grew up?\n\nALICE BABER: Most of it was in Florida. And in the third and fourth grade I went to school in the tiny little town where I come from, Kansas, Illinois. And the result of moving was that we were in a different school each year, more or less, so.... Or at least I had a feeling that there was no continuity, that I was always in a new school. And the main problem was that I was always studying South\n\nAmerica. Wherever I went it was on the agenda for the year. As a result, I don't know anything about South America.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: At one point, though, I knew very well how it looked, you know, the shape of it and what products come from the different parts, [and all that].\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's incredible. Well, if your sister was a couple of years older, she was still in school. Did that make any differenceÄthe fact that you were kind of both going through these different schools?\n\nALICE BABER: No, because we would usually go to the same grade school. Because this was all sort of grade school days. And the main result of my sister being treated as older was that when she learned to read, I was very competitive so I learned to read, too. And if she learned to recite a poem, I learned to recite it at the same time.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, [I] see.\n\nALICE BABER: So, I was slightly ahead of myself.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] Well, how old were you when you began reading, then?\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, very young, I suppose three. I remember reading at four, when I was supposed to be taking a nap. That sort of thing. But I don't remember when I couldn't read. I do remember learning the alphabet, because I loved the shapes of the letters. And most of it had to do with a kind of formal quality. I liked the letters when A through M went straight down, and then N through Z, that sort of thing, like all the forms.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, I see, the shapes and everything.\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. And I liked them.... When I studied them sort of in secret when I was not supposed to be reading, I would read them by the kind of yellow light that you get through blinds, and I was _____ _____.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] Well, now how did this affect you as a student? You were relating to a whole new group of students every year. Was that difficult or easy to....\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, yes, I was really unhappy. [chuckles]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It didn't work well?\n\nALICE BABER: Not too well.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Were there any friends from your home town that you got to know, or was that difficult too?\n\nALICE BABER: No. I don't remember having.... I do have childhood friends, as a matter of fact, that continue. But, in a way, I don't remember anyone sort of all the way through. Or I found them, and then I'd be friends for a few years and then I'd lose them. So I do have a very strong sense of friendship, and I do feel that there's a mystique involved in friendship. But there are sort of interruptions.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: In what way?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I think it's perhaps the only thing in life that really communicates, kind ofÄthe loyalty of friendshipÄbut I do think it is interrupted. Once in a while or fairly often.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, was there any art interest or literary interest, things of that nature, in your family, that you grew up with?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. When I was five years old, I decided that I would be either a poet or a painter. And I remember the day that I decided, and I'm sure that I really didn't know what it meant to be either one of those.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, what precipitated that, though?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I don't remember the sort of the epiphany just before the moment....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: ...but I do remember saying toÄprobably stamping my foot, you knowÄ\"I shall be\" or \"will be.\"\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: But had you seen them up close? Had you seen paintings?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, I was....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Did you know what the words meant?\n\nALICE BABER: ...I was very good at art. I could copy things. For exampleÄI think of this now when I have studentsÄwhen I went to kindergarten and they gave us all those horrible little blocks to use and they gave us Listerine ads to cut out and I could cut out the Listerine ad absolutely perfectlyÄyou know, the nose, the mouth, the gargle, everythingÄand the little kids who weren't good at art would be two or three inches off. They couldn't sort of zero in on the shape. But I don't know why that should make you artistic, you see. [laughter] That was my first clue. And then, as far as poetry was concerned, I wrote it all the time, and was encouragedÄmostly from my father, I think. In a way, I think my mother encouraged the painting more and my father the writing, but I think that was just because it happened to fall into their interests a little more.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Why, was your father literary?\n\nALICE BABER: He was a writer.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What kind of things did he write?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, he is a full-time writer now. In those days he had not started writing. He writes.... He is an authority on the [Hanks] family.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: On...?\n\nALICE BABER: On the [Hanks] family. Lincoln. Lincoln's material.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, really? Yeah. And that's his....\n\nALICE BABER: The reason that he started writing the material is because he read a great many books and he found errors in them that he knew were incorrect, and so he started doing his own research and writing his own books.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So you must have grown up with a lot of books around the house.\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, lots of books.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: All kinds of topics, or literary mainly?\n\nALICE BABER: All kinds, really. I liked the books enormously, and when we lived in Florida, there were no book stores in the town. In other words, a town.... Even now, you can go to the South and there's no book store at all.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right.\n\nALICE BABER: So I spent most of my time in the library, reading my way through. So I read almost anything I could get my hands on.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, what kind of things do you remember reading that were particularly provocativeÄeither in terms of subject or particular books?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare, which I then did my own plays from, and so forth, not realizing that I was really watering down the material considerably. [laughter] The library, which was on Biscayne Bay, was full of mold.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, really? [chuckles]\n\nALICE BABER: And so when I think of the books in those days, I smell this sort of enormous library full of moldy books. But it was a pretty good library, and they didn't object to a child wandering around, sort of reading almost anything.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, what about your mother's interest in art? Was she involved with it, or was it kind of an acceptable interest to have or....\n\nALICE BABER: Well, my mother, I think, looking back, must have taken art history in college. And we had on the walls of our home in Illinois, Madonna of the Chair and a Botticelli, and things like that, which I didn't like as a child, but they were there to look at. I did look at them. I didn't like them because they didn't look like the people that I knew, and that bothered me. It doesn't bother me now, but it bothered me then.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: They weren't real in other words. I mean, like the photographs in the magazine look like somebody.\n\nALICE BABER: No, no, it had nothing to do with a magazine. They didn't look like the people that I imagined. You see, I had already read the stories of the paintingsÄMadonna and ChildÄso I knew what that looked like, but it didn't look like the version that we had on the wall.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, I see.\n\nALICE BABER: I don't think that I ever wanted it to look like people that I knew.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, now, but it.... In other words, it didn't concur with the imagination.\n\nALICE BABER: Exactly.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, when did....\n\nALICE BABER: It also had something to do, I think, with the great refinement of the eyelid. I was very concerned with that somehow. I mean, looking at the eyebrows, the eyelids, and so forth, because I was not aware at that time that that would be such a good way to show form.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, right, because everything's [just so].\n\nALICE BABER: But I mean I spent a spent a great deal of time looking at them.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah. Well, what about the drawing which you have mentioned you had doneÄfrom the beginning almost? [chuckles] When did that start?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I always drew. And I don't remember when it started or why it started. But I was encouraged, which I think is very important. And I was obviously given paper to work with, which was also important.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Did you draw in school? Were there classes ever any place you were?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. I always had in art in school, and most of the time I think it was unfortunate. Not really because I was taught the wrong things, which is what everyone says nowÄyou know, we're always taught the wrong thingsÄbut I think.... It's interesting, I can't remember. So obviously all kinds of blocks about my relationship to art in school. But I do remember that I was kind of teacher's pet in the situation.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Did you do all the things they would do at Thanksgiving or Christmas?\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, yes, and I was always better than the other kids. And I remember once that I did the clouds for another child, and then when the teacher came and said\n\nthose were marvelous clouds, then I told the teacher I had done them. so, you see, I do have a serious problem remembering those things.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs hard] But it sounds as if your childhood was very active, with moving back and forth across the country and reading and....\n\nALICE BABER: You know, I always thought it had been very sedentary. [laughing]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Really?\n\nALICE BABER: The way you look at it, it does sound active.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah. Were you aware of the Depression at this point? You know, when you got to be ten or thereabouts?\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, yes. We were poor, properly poor. I remember that we would go for Sunday dinner at noontime to a restaurant where we got everything for thirty-five cents and it was one of those.... [telephone rings] Hang on a second please.\n\n[Interruption in taping to answer telephone]\n\nALICE BABER: What I started to say was that the restaurant was like a grotto. It was marvelous. It had waterfalls, and it had obviously fallen on evil days, having to serve people for thirty-five cents, lunches or dinners. But I think that may have been the average in those days. But I was aware of what it cost to go out and that it was a big event and so forth. And yes, I mean, you know, there was a certain amount of discussion about it, about the DepressionÄincluding the fact that it's not polite to talk about money.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right, right. [phone rings again]\n\n[Interruption in taping]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What about your sister? Did she have art interests, or culture interests?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, we were, both of us, offered lessons in anything that we wanted to do, but my mother always said if we wouldn't practice, then we wouldn't get the lessons. And the examples held up to us of children that were obviously behaving properly were a sister and brother who both played the piano something like fourteen hours a day....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right. [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: You've got to know someone like that. Well, my sister and I somehow didn't fit into that. So I'm not quite sure what areas my sister interested herself in up to a certain point, but I know that.... I was taken to a dance class, and I was not interested in practicing danceÄtap danceÄand a number of other things like that. And then, I was offered perspective lessons by a man who taught painting. This was in Illinois. He was our local famous painter, Paul Sargent. And he was really quite good. Looking back now, his painting was a combination of sort of Courbet, impressionism, and so forth. But enormously talented and very much, say, a product of some other time, some other place. But he taught me perspective and I adored it and I was eight years old and I took a lot of lessons and I practiced. I mean, I did all of my assignments in between. My sister didn't. By the time I was ten or twelve, we both went to have oil painting class lessons with the college class that he taught, and after one class she threw in her brushes, and I was very pleased because I grabbed them and I then had.... Again, back to the financial thingÄyou see, I was only allowed so many brushes, to see if I was interested, and I had double everything and I felt this marvelous largess.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] Right, right.\n\nALICE BABER: And I was very very pleased and then she went off and played the violin.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, where did you go to high school, and was that still traveling back and forth?\n\nALICE BABER: No. I was ready for high school when the War came. And then we had to decide, and we decided it would probably be better to stay in IllinoisÄfor a number of reasons and, including, amusingly enoughÄthe threat at that time was submarine warfare, Florida coast. We'd been through a certain number of blackouts and things like that, practice wars in Florida, and it was a question of gas rationing. I mean, you just couldn't move, so we decided, well, all right, we'd settle there in [Catus], back home, as it were.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right, and stay there. Well, did you have a house there in Illinois where you....\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, my great grandfather's house.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So it was kind of the family house?\n\nALICE BABER: It was always available. Well, it was empty because it was my great grandfather's house, so we stayed there whenever we wanted, and it's still there and it's where my father lives.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So you spent how many years, finally, really living in one place? Through high school?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, through high school. Then I went on to college.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, did you keep.... You kept painting and drawing through high school, right?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, but I didn't have classes. It was a very small high school. They didn't teach art.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Did you just do it.... You did it when you had an opportunity, right? Or did you have some kind of program?\n\nALICE BABER: I think I took a leave of absence. [laughter] In a way. You see, these painting lessons had somehow disappeared. I'm trying to think why. I don't know whether Mr. Sargent died, or what it was, but.... I didn't paint. I was sort of biding my time until I got into college and then I knew that I would be an art major and that I would start painting immediately.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, had you gotten to any museums by this time? I mean, had you gotten into anyplace or had you seen any....\n\nALICE BABER: Well, not completely innocent of museums. I remember the Ringling Brothers Museum, of all places....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, right, in Florida.\n\nALICE BABER: ...in Florida, which had some rather good things. And I remember that when I walked into that museumÄthis was not the first museum I'd been into, but I'm not quite sureÄnot a great many, actuallyÄand one of the books.... [telephone rings]\n\n[Interruption in taping]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: ...unfortunate. You were going to mention a book.\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, one Christmas two different people gave us the same book, which was Great Masters in Art, chosen, as I remember, by Rockwell Kent.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, that book, right. There is one.\n\nALICE BABER: Do you remember it? Did you have that?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It's a large book.\n\nALICE BABER: But it was the joy of my life for a couple of years, because I looked at each painting very carefully and.... Of course, it's funny, I didn't like the Van Gogh watercolorsÄI mean, the Van Gogh flowers, sunflowersÄbut I liked almost everything else in it. Of course, later I liked mostly the Van Gogh flowers. [laughter] But that's life. But when you're stuck in the middle of America, and you're not near a museum, books are very important.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, did you have any friends who were interested in art, or was this a sort of private activity that you pursued through to school?\n\nALICE BABER: I think it was private. That may have been a virtue. I never knew anyone that wrote or painted or anything else.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So it was like your own....\n\nALICE BABER: My friends were, I don't know, they were athletic, something I wasn't.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] You mean you didn't do all those Midwestern American things of running around?\n\nALICE BABER: Yeah, I played basketball. [chuckles] Not very well.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Good. And your family sort of approved of this, as you went through high school, that your interest maintained itself in the arts?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, they did. I don't think that they knew what being an artist meant, any more than I did, but they did believe it was a good thing.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Do you think there was any effect of the Depression on that kind of attitude? You know, because everything was so leveled that you really could do what you wanted to do, and potentials being so limited in so many ways that....\n\nALICE BABER: I'm not sure. I think that I received contradictory advice as a child. I remember being told because of the Depression that I would have to work my way through college, and that seemed perfectly normal. And this other point of view, that one would be an artist, seemed perfectly normal. But I think it was a combination of a number of attitudes, some of them from the nineteenth century. And I think it was totally without a consciousness that it was difficult for a woman to do it. And there was no suggestion that because I was a woman there would be a problem in getting a job or being an artist or anything else.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So that everything was really [unquestioned].\n\nALICE BABER: In the sense that you've just asked the question, yes. And for all I know the Depression might have made some difference.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Or possibly everybody really had to work?\n\nALICE BABER: But I mean it broke down sort of all the barriers. And I didn't feel that there was any one path that I was expected to takeÄexcept that I was expected, in a sense, to do something.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's very interesting, because that seems a rather typical pattern.\n\nALICE BABER: To do something, you mean?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, I mean that attitude coming out of the Depression period, when you were.... Because other people I've talked to around the same age area have said pretty much the same kinds of thing. You know, they knew they had to work because everybody had to work to survive.\n\nALICE BABER: Yes.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: And families didn't often impose, saying, \"You've got to do this,\" or \"You've got to do that.\" But that happened occasionally, too.\n\nALICE BABER: You'd think that the families, in their fear of the survival of the child, would have made suggestions. I remember at one point thinking that it would've been easier if there had been some kind of suggestion that was definite. There never was. So I could've at least reacted against it. [said tongue in cheek]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: But they really let you sort of....\n\nALICE BABER: Drift along.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah, and follow your own imagination and inclinations.\n\nALICE BABER: Yes.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Did you speak any.... Were there any languages at home? Did your parents speak a language other than English, or were there any around that....\n\nALICE BABER: Not in the sense of having any experiencesÄin the sense that immigrants have languages, you knowÄbut my mother had studied French in school and she was very proud of it, and she would often use it when an occasion would arise. My father spoke French from the First World War. Very badly. Except when I finally got to France, I found the expressions that I had learned from him were very useful.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] Yeah, I'll bet.\n\nALICE BABER: Yes.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's marvelous. Maybe there isn't as much change as one expects.\n\nALICE BABER: Exactly. On the other hand, living in Florida we were very, very aware of the Spanish as a second language, and I did study it in college.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Did you learn any languages before college or in college?\n\nALICE BABER: No, I didn't go to a school that taught it. I remember feeling that I was very poor because I couldn't go to a private school that would teach languages.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What is Lindenwood College? And what.... [chuckles]\n\nALICE BABER: Where'd you get that?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: My source is gone forever. [laughter]\n\nALICE BABER: It's in St. Charles, Missouri. It's quite beautiful. It was, when I went, a woman's college. I think it's now coeducational, or bordering on it, like many schools. And I had an absolutely splendid art teacher there.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Who was that?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, her name was Elizabeth Watts and I don't know where she is now, but she had come straight from Iowa, and she was full of the kind of information that I needed very much. And she taught us to understand and appreciate modern art and all those that you don't learn at home. Her painting style was probably a moderation of early [PhilipÄEd.] Guston, which was all right.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Early.... In what....\n\nALICE BABER: Well, the figures with the hats and the....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, you mean the, his early....\n\nALICE BABER: Yeah, early, early style.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: From the....\n\nALICE BABER: From the forties.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: ...forties, yeah. So that means he was....\n\nALICE BABER: But it was never [from] _____ Piero della Francesca and....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah, but she was very contemporary then, if she was doing that kind of thing.\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, yes, enormously.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How did you pick that school? Was it easy or handy, or what led you there?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, it was a woman's college that had a very high reputation in the Middle West. And it was the selection of my family, for the first two years.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: And you lived there then?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, because it's near St. Louis.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What was it, in a dormitory situation?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. It's a small college, completely enclosed by a high wall, as I remember. Probably a low wall, but, you know, that kind of feeling.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah. Well, how'd you like it? You know, moving away from home and surrounded by dozens or hundreds of other girls? [chuckles]\n\nALICE BABER: I was very pleased to be sort of starting on my own ventures, away from home. I wasn't sure that I really liked the woman's college, with its.... The atmosphere was.... It had one advantage: We all studied quite a bit. But the social life was such a problem for everybody, somehow. See, I had an advantage. My sister was then going to Washington University, which was only twenty miles away. I would not have gone there if I had not had sort of a way out of the situation, outside the cloistered walls _____....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: ...of the school. [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: And, of course, at the end of the second year I went to Indiana University.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Did you have other art instruction, besides the one woman you've mentioned?\n\nALICE BABER: No. She was the only one.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: She was the one.\n\nALICE BABER: And she encouraged me to leave as quickly as possible. I would actually have gone my sophomore year, but it was hard to get into schools right after the War, and so forth. So she said that I should go to a university. For one thing, we'd have nude models, which you weren't allowed to have at LindenwoodÄnot that that, of course, makes great art, but it's a stepÄand if I would just get to some place where there they had more teachers, more facilities.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: More people involved.\n\nALICE BABER: It's interesting. I've always been encouraged by people to move on, which has been my own inclination. I mean, no one's ever held me back, which I think is quite nice, now that I think about it.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's unusual.\n\nALICE BABER: Yeah, it is.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: There was no imposition of a particular idea or style?\n\nALICE BABER: That's right. I mean, if she had said to me, \"You must stay here so that you will paint,\" I would have left, but it would have made it harder.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah. Well, it's interesting, you mentioned her relationship to early Guston. Did you have art magazines? Were there many.... No, there were not very many art magazines then. But there was Art News, and [Arts, arts] was around and a few other things. Were you interested in what was going on in the immediate art world of contemporary things, or were you interested in art history, or....\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, I was very interested in what was going on. And I remember that my first trip to New York, when I was nearing the end of collegeÄor at least one of the trips to New YorkÄand I went to the Guggenheim Museum, and I was looking at a Klee show. No, I don't know, Klee or Kandinsky. Anyway, I was buying a book, and they said, \"Oh, you're from the Middle West. Have they heard of Kandinsky in the Middle West?\" and I was very enraged. So we had whatever publications there were.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Did you go to Chicago ever? Or was that not a place to go?\n\nALICE BABER: No, I didn't want to go to Chicago.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, really? [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: I had a feeling it was a trap.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] Well, that's [kind of odd]. It's interesting.\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I always had the feeling that if you went to Chicago from the Middle West, that you'd end up in Chicago, and that seemed to me to be a disaster. I mean, looking back, it probably would have been all to the good, but at the time no. But I had been to Chicago and I didn't find it a very appealing town. I still don't, as a matter of fact.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: For what reason?\n\nALICE BABER: I'm sure I'd like it better if I knew people there, if I'd ever gotten involved.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, I see; it's just a big town.\n\nALICE BABER: But visually I really like New York, strangely enough. In its own way, it's ugly, but there's a response.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: And you never found that in Chicago?\n\nALICE BABER: No. Not even going to the College Art Association two years ago. [laughter]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, didn't you go to the museum there ever? The Institute?\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, sure.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It's really quite a fabulous museum. [de Kooning]....\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, splendid. The Grand Jatte is not to be missed.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] And a few other things they have there.\n\nALICE BABER: And as a matter of fact, you see.... Of course, the museum in St. Louis is quite good, which I had for those first two years of college.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, how did you select Indiana University? Was that because it was there, again?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I always say it's because I was working my way east, but there was a problem in getting into colleges at the time, and if the college was bordering on your own state, you would be accepted. So it didn't occur to me to ask for colleges really far, far from my home. I did apply, I think, to New Mexico and decided not to go. I thought that was a little provincialÄI mean, even more so than where I was. But I liked the county in which Indiana University was; it's quite beautiful. And the atmosphere there is, from the point of nature, much superior to Illinois. Illinois looks like a sort of Dutch landscape; it's very flat with a few trees.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah. Well, how did you like this? Because this was now a large school compared to the other one, wasn't it? Did you find that _____ _____?\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, I thought that was all to the good. The bigger the better.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Greater variety.\n\nALICE BABER: My only complaint at Indiana was that I thought it wasn't a very intellectual place. I mean, the people there were....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Why was that, do you think?\n\nALICE BABER: The exceptions were the English department, the art department, and the anthropology department. And of course Kinsey* was very big on campus. But generally speaking it was a college that was not really concerned.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, what were their main activities there then?\n\nALICE BABER: The business school was quite important there, and they have a medical school, and I think most of the money went to these branches because, I mean, that was what was considered important.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Who was in the art department when you were there?\n\n____________\n\n*Alfred Kinsey, author of The Kinsey Report.\n\nALICE BABER: Well, Dr. [________ÄEd.] Hope was the chairmanÄand he's an interesting person and we always had this.... We always knew that Dr. Hope would defend any student in the art department. Any bohemian activity....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] Oh, really?\n\nALICE BABER: ...such as having beer on campus.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, really?\n\nALICE BABER: Yeah, it was marvelous. And the teacher that we all sort of gathered aroundÄthe group that I was involved withÄwas [Alton] Pickens, whom I have not seen for, what, twenty years or something, until the other day.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] Oh, really? Fantastic.\n\nALICE BABER: And then when.... Well, he's been teaching in the East, and finally old friends got us all together and it was really quite nice to see him again.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Who was in that group of students you referred to?\n\nALICE BABER: Well.... [pauses, thinking] I don't know, you see, I don't know that in a way that this whole, this group.... I mean, we don't really exist as a group of students the way you might say that, technically, the year that so and so graduated.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: No. Art students never do.\n\nALICE BABER: They never graduate.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah, but they never form a cohesive group that continues either.\n\nALICE BABER: Well, in one way we did. Most of us, because of Pickens, came to New York. You see, again, being encouraged.... I asked him, \"What do I do next?\" and he said, \"You must go to New York City,\" with some sort of poetic remark like, \"where the great ships go out to sea,\" which I thought was splendid and which keeps you going in New York. And then he said, \"Go there, and work until you have a group of paintings that are all one group, and this will be your start as a painter.\" So I did that, and some of the other students also came to New York, and for the first few years we would meet together and sketch and talk to each other about painting. And I advise my own students now to do this, to not get lost when they leave class, but to get each others' names and become friends, because you need some kind of peers or someone you can talk to [when you leave school].\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Also it's continuity, and so forth.\n\nALICE BABER: Exactly. And in a way you're working your way out of the same problems with style and whatever your background.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Who were some of the other people who came to New York with you, do you remember? [Pam]?\n\nALICE BABER: I'm trying to think, because there are....\n\n[Interruption in taping]\n\nALICE BABER: One of the other students was called Dick Ireland and he is now at the Maryland Institute, and there was a photographer called Bob Forth, and then he and another student called Barbara, who got married, are I think in Maryland, and there was a painter whose name was Ansel Chastine, who was from the hills of Indiana, who is now living outside of New York City and still painting. Everyone that I knew is still paintingÄone way or another.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So it means you had a very highly motivated group of people then?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, we did.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You know, so many of them....\n\nALICE BABER: I would say that many of them are still painting figuratively, because of their own inclination or the influence of [________ÄEd.] Pickens, who is a figurative painter.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How long did you study with him? One or two years?\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, three years.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Three years. With anyone else, or was he the main....\n\nALICE BABER: He was the main teacher. We had a number of other teachers. We had Arthur Deshaies, who taught graphics. He was very good. And we had an interesting man who was a sculptor, whose name was Leo Steppat, who later died. And I didn't take from [Rickey], who was thereÄGeorge Rickey. I was really.... Everyone thought he taught art history at the time, but I wish I'd known him better because I think he is a splendid artist at this point. There was a man called [________ÄEd.] [Engle, Engel] that I did not take fromÄhe taught drawingÄwho represented really the conservative element in the school. And of course we all took art history from Henry Hope. I think my favorite art history course was from Theodore Bowie who taught Oriental art. And I think it was the only class I ever made A+ in. I really enjoyed it enormously. And of course....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What was the appeal there?\n\nALICE BABER: ...I've been to India twice now and I keep looking at things that Bowie said to look up. I feel like I haven't forgotten a single word that he said. And he was brought up in the Orient so he was really an excellent teacher.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, I see. What was the appeal, do you think, in Oriental art, to you? I mean, at that point what was....\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I think I've always been interested in the Orient, and the esoteric quality.... Of course, we had all the books at home of travels through the Gobi Desert, and that sort of thing, and I decided at an early age I would do that. And India always represented to me a country that would be extraordinarily beautiful, which it is. I haven't been disappointed at all. I think I decided that I would always travel and that I would go to places that appeal to me. I talk to my students about this sometimes, the idea of what you're born with that interests you. Nobody influences you. You suddenly know that that's for you, the minute you hear it or see it. And the East always interested me. I remember, at Lindenwood, when they asked me to take the religion course and I didn't want to take the time out to do it, I said, \"Well, I'll say that I am a Buddhist.\" And I remember they were very upset about that.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [chuckles] Oh, really?\n\nALICE BABER: And I wouldn't say that now, because I'm almost a Buddhist, so I wouldn't sort of play with the idea, but I remember thinking that this would be my way out, and so maybe in some strange way, you see, I thought this was the escape from our world into something else better, more interesting and fuller.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Do you think that.... Oh, I don't know. Actually, what I wanted to say was, it's always intrigued me that in the middle of the country there's a line of people who seem to look towards the Orient as much as they look toward Europe. Were there other people around, or would you really get your interest from the books, do you think?\n\nALICE BABER: I think that people look to the Orient more from the West Coast, but I think you have a very good point, and I had never thought of it before.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, but even....\n\nALICE BABER: But it was my father's collection of books that I read. The travels of [St. Hedens] and so forth in the Orient. And in a way he had a kind of contempt for Europe, which you find in the Middle WestÄOr shall we say almost a feeling of separateness from Western European culture, which seems to have been almost a conscious decision, I think, somewhere in the late Edwardian period. You'd have to look into the.... But from the point of view of your question, I don't know. I think his position in our particular region was isolated. And I don't know where he got it. I must ask him sometime.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Anyway, going back to Indiana University, how did you cope with Henry Hope as an instructor, your professor?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I liked him very much as a chairman. I remember asking him for all kinds of recommendations through the years, and he was always very helpful. For example, I told him that I would be interested in being an art criticÄwhich I have never beenÄbecause I wanted to combine writing with art, and he encouraged me enormously. I've never been a critic because I don't really have a critical position, but I sometimes write things when I feel positive about the situation.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: A critical position, then... \"Position\" then being negative?\n\nALICE BABER: It seems to me that a critical position at least requires what Mary McCarthy called \"a cold eye,\" and I'm not sure that I'm willing to write about a cold eye. I frequently have one, but I think if I take the trouble to write, then I want to write positively.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So it has to be a more passionate engagement then?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, and this may be out of fear, too.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, did you have any other professors at Indiana who were of interest to youÄin literature or other areas?\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, yes. I had a splendid teacher of poetry. Let me think. A very good poet, if I can just remember his name, and I was sent to him by Alton Pickens, who was a good friend, because Alton sensed that we were very isolated in Bloomington, Indiana, from certain things that we wanted and needed, and he would tell me of other professors who were of interest. For example, the summer that I went on a digÄwe dug at Hopewell Mound, Alton suggested that I see the head of anthropology and I.... That was a fascinating experience and one which I recommend now to my own students, if they get into anthropology, go on a dig and possibly will be able to go and work abroad, if necessary.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, what do you think that did for you? And which summer was that?\n\nALICE BABER: That was the summer that I had graduated from college, but before I went back for a year of graduate work. What did it do for me?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah. I mean, where did you go and what was the....\n\nALICE BABER: Well, we went very close to where we wereÄthat is, it was a hundred miles from the UniversityÄdown in a region where, I don't know, where the various rivers meetÄMississippi merges into something elseÄand the Indians built a number of mounds in that neighborhood. They had not beenÄand I think they have not yetÄfound a village site connected with a mound, so that we are aware of the kinds of burials in the mounds. You know, a lot of mounds have been dug but a village site has not been found. That was our goal for the summer and we didn't succeed. We didn't find the village.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, there are a lot of mounds that are not near villages.\n\nALICE BABER: No, that's the problem, you see. What our professor had tried to do was decide where a village ought to be in relationship to a mound, and we didn't find one. [laughs] Well, the women were put to work on the disturbed burials in the sand, so that I dug for the whole summer. I was actually assigned as an artist, but it turned out that they really wanted photographic realism. None of us were trained in that or interested in that, so we were given a shovel, put to work. And I enjoyed it enormously.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Scrape and scrape and _____ _____.\n\nALICE BABER: Exactly. You obviously have done that, too.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah, I know, I was into those things.\n\nALICE BABER: When did you do that?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, when I was in high school one year I discovered one of those things. [laughter] But why do you recommend it to your students now? I mean, for what purpose? As just sort of a life exploration, or....\n\nALICE BABER: No, no. Because I think that sometimes you can get to Greece and Turkey and so forth on these digs, as a way of getting out of the country when you haven't got a penny. And of course they just feed you; I mean, you don't make any money.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right.\n\nALICE BABER: And I guess because I care passionately about it. I like anthropology, archaeology, and I like bones.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Do you think any of those things relate to your work, or influenced it in any way? Or is it a peripheral influence, so that a major interest....\n\nBABER, ALICE\n\nspellcheck done of draft??? YES\n\n38 pp. Courier\n\n..hm .66\"\n\nTape 1, side A (continued)\n\nTape 1, side B\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: ...influenced it in any way? Or is it a peripheral influence, a major interest?\n\nALICE BABER: I've never thought of it as having any influence. I would have to think about that. I don't know.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: But it's an interest that's continued obviously.\n\nALICE BABER: I think it's possible that anyone who's a painter or a sculptor might enjoy digging in the dirt and might enjoy the whole revealing of the bones as they emerge. And then even the very careful work, when you end up finally with a spoon, you know. The whole thing is related, really, to the process of painting.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: In what way, do you feel?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, you start with a big shovel, and then you get down to sort of refined [parts, portions].\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: The finer, finer, finer, finer, and pretty soon little.... Well, what was your painting like while you were at the university? What kind of things were you doing, or was there so much class projects to be done that....\n\nALICE BABER: No, I'm happy to say that I managed to go through school with.... And I probably was assigned no more than one or two projects the whole time. And I just painted. And I painted all kinds of things. I painted abstract paintings, semi-abstract paintings, figures, figures in environment, figures in flattened spaceÄyou know, whatever. And my move into color was related to trees. One spring I said to Pickens, \"I don't like the colors that I'm using. Aren't there any others?\" And he said, \"Yes, of course, if you'll just go and.... You know, there are other colors.\" And that's when I realized the limited palette that most students are given, and I bought all of the reds and purples and brilliant colors that I could find in any of the art supply stores, and from then on my palette pleased me.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: But did the subject matter change then?\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, no. Not really.\n\nBABER, ALICE\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: But it just became brighter and....\n\nALICE BABER: I think that the change in subject matter comes, with the use of color, in a tapering off of interest in rendering. Because you no longer have to gray down the forms or find ways of making a third dimension or reproducing reality in some fashion. And as your own sense of color approaches your own sense of poetry and fantasy, I think the priorities begin to change.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, when did that start for you then? Was that after school, or in graduate school? Or was it slow and then all of a sudden you saw it in retrospect?\n\nALICE BABER: I didn't do anything in any kind of continuity really. I tried lots of things. And as far as isolating one element in painting to be interested in, I didn't at all. Sometimes I'd be interested in line, sometimes form, sometimes color. And I would try to work with that to find an interest. But I was not the kind of student that found something immediately. I had to really search very hard, through everything.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, did you make sculpture there, too, or not?\n\nALICE BABER: I made one sculpture under Leo Steppat, and I decided that I would do a gibbon because I liked it in paintings, you see. And so, then I had to go and get a book on the great apes, and then I got all involved with the great apes....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: ...and I decided to do a series with great apes, and I started with my gibbon, which of course was quite abstract. And then, Mr. Steppat said, no, I couldn't do any more great apes, and so I discarded sculpture.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Like that.\n\nALICE BABER: Well, obviously, you know, I wasn't a sculptor at heart. I was easily discouraged. And so, when I take it up again, I will continue with my great apes. [laughter]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What about graduate schoolÄbecause you said you went back for a year of graduate school?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I knew it would be a good idea to continue painting in an environment that I knew. And I talked to Alton Pickens about it and he said, \"Fine,\" you know, \"but also going to New York,\" or whatever, and I did.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Did you just paint that year?\n\nALICE BABER: That was the year I took nothing but painting and Oriental art.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That sounds marvelous. [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: It was [probably] the happiest year of my life. [laughter]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, did you get involved in any student activities while you were there? Or were you so busy with painting that university life in general got lost?\n\nALICE BABER: Do you find any artists that admit that they were into activities?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, yes.\n\nALICE BABER: Name three. [laughs]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, three is a large number. [laughter]\n\nALICE BABER: Shall I take the fifth amendment? I don't know. Yeah, I did everything. But what I enjoyed the most was not an activity, because I thought that was a little bit superficial. I wrote for the newspaper, and I have always been sort of interested in journalism. I like the idea of going to press, and I like the idea of being able to describe things. Also, you see, if you have a press card you can stay out late and cross fire lines. Again, it's a feeling of freedom. It's like being a Buddhist; it's the same thing.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Opens up a lot of doors.\n\nALICE BABER: That's right. I never use it for that, but I think, you know, it's some kind of....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: The potential.\n\nALICE BABER: Exactly.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right, right. Well, you came to New York, what, 1951 or something, I had?\n\nALICE BABER: Right.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Why that particular year?\n\nALICE BABER: Incidentally, you didn't ask me the year I was born.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: In 1928.\n\nALICE BABER: Oh. You shouldn't have said that.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: No, because Colette Roberts started when she was working at my gallery, started sending out everybody's birthday, and I commented to her about it, and she said, \"Don't be silly,\" and she promptly sent it out for everybody. [laughter] So it's never been a secret.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] Anyway, but back to 1951. Was that the end of the graduate school year?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It was? So....\n\nALICE BABER: I went to Europe the summer after I had the graduate year, and I went to Fontainebleau [Ecole des Beaux-ArtsÄEd.], for which I got graduate credit.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So that would be the summer of '51 then?\n\nALICE BABER: '51, yeah. So I was in New York the fall of '51.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How did you go to Fontainebleau? Was that part of your school?\n\nALICE BABER: I was looking for a place to go in France, and apparently I had their brochures and so forth, and another art student also wanted to go and so we.... Well, actually, there were three of us, and then one of the three of us got draftedÄinto what would have then been the Korean War.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right. Well, Paris was very spartan then, wasn't it?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, it was.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Because it was still with a lot of signs of the previous war.\n\nALICE BABER: It was spartan, because I remember at a cocktail party that we had at Fontainebleau that the sort of elderly French that were attached to that school came, and they were very thin and they ate all the tarts very hungrily. I mean, there was a sense of sort of devastation in the land . . . wind or something. Very much so.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, you still saw it.\n\nALICE BABER: Absolutely.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I mean, you know, bomb sites and piles of rubble and things.\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. But Fontainebleau was back on its feet, and Walter Damrosch had started it or something, with American friendship to France, and it was run by a very powerful woman, whose name was Madame Boulanger,* who happened to be in music. But I mean the art department wasn't terribly important, but it was good for our purposes. And what I did actually, instead of just going upstairs in the chateau and paintingÄthat looked a little dull to meÄI joined the group that was touring France. I really joined the architects. And so we were given buses and we went all over France and that was quite nice.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, so you saw a lot of....\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I also asked Bowie what I should see in Europe, and he said that I should see London and Rome and Florence and Venice and Paris. So George and I went to London and Rome. We got as far as FlorenceÄwe didn't get to VeniceÄand then we went back to school, and then we took all these bus trips. So we did very well in Europe in terms of seeing things, except that it was many years before I'd seen the Prado and I wonder now why Mr. Bowie didn't tell me to see the Prado. I would probably have worked it in that first summer, if he'd said to.\n\n____________\n\n*Nadia Boulanger, teacher of many contemporary composers.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah. Well, that was also your first trip to Europe.\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, yes.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How did you like it? Did you know French? Did you speak any French?\n\nALICE BABER: No. Well, the last year of school I had taken beginning French, and then I tried to get the French teacher to teach me more and my French was very bad, of course, and I just struggled along like everyone does. But I tried to stay there and work, but I couldn't get a job. And in England I thought, \"Well, at least I can stay in England and work,\" but the English were not encouraging work permits.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Very difficult.\n\nALICE BABER: However, they would've given me a permit if I had gotten a job working at Harrod's Department Store, but I couldn't pass the test for picking out buttons. It was sort of an IQ test, and I flunked it.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Really? That's marvelous. [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: It had to do with matching, like.... No, I could match the green buttons and the red buttons, but I couldn't do it by size, or something, so it was all very embarrassing.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That's fantastic. That's wild.\n\nALICE BABER: And I was offered other jobs in London, but for something like two pounds a week, and you couldn't live on it.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right, no money, nothing....\n\nALICE BABER: Even the English couldn't have lived on it, living at home. They said, \"Well, it's for people living at home.\" So I really was forced to come back to America, and I thought.... Well, I mean, New York was all rightÄI mean, I didn't objectÄbut I did sort of try to stay there while I was there. Well, again, the adventure of travel.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So it was really the fall of '51 that you came here and set up.\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. Right.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Where did you come to in New York when you got here?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I had a very clever idea for getting a job, which I wouldn't have now. I looked in magazines, and if I saw a product that I thought was interesting I would call the company and say, \"Can I sell this product?\" And I got a number of people who were willing to hire me, but I ended up in a modern importing firm. It was Italian design: furniture, and _____. They said that I didn't have the strength of character to sell anything, but they did hire me, but not on the floor.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So what did you do? You worked for them doing what?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I was hired, amusingly enough, to do publicity, and I learned something about doing it. And I lasted about a year and a half, and then I decided I really couldn't do any more sales _____. So I quit and I painted for a few months, which I loved doing. I went home every evening and painted anyway. I mean, the job was simply a way to keep things, keep going.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Maintain, yeah.\n\nALICE BABER: And I had always believed, and I still do believe, that it's a good idea to avoid having an art job during the day.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, absolutely.\n\nALICE BABER: So my jobs have always really not had to do with art.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, were you living in the Village then, or [Uptown, uptown] or where about?\n\nALICE BABER: When I first came I went to the Chelsea Hotel, and I stayed there that first winter, and I had met Colette Roberts on the boat.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: In coming back?\n\nALICE BABER: Coming and going both, I think. She was on the same boat. And she taught a little class.... We were all very seasick. She taught a class for, I don't know.... She asked.... We could all ask questions and I said, \"Where are the galleries? What do artists do in New York?\" And so she could see I was interested, so as soon as I came back she invited me to go to an opening at the Hacker Bookstore.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, yes, I [remember].\n\nALICE BABER: So that was my first opening. And then that week I made the rounds of the galleries. I was also looking for jobs at galleriesÄI mean, I didn't know what else to doÄjust to see what the story would be. And one of the galleriesÄI've forgotten the name now; it's no longer openÄsent me to a person at the Chelsea Hotel who wanted to share the cost of her hotel room, and so that's how within a week or two weeks I was in the Chelsea Hotel, and I had met a number of people in the art world. And then in the late spring I found a place in the Village that I still have, in the West Village.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So that was '52. Well, did you paint in the Hotel Chelsea then, that first, say, winter that you were here?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. I had a little trouble getting started, as a matter of fact. Right, of course I did. It was a big apartment, as those Chelsea Hotel apartments are. And I was around other people who were painting. We were all painting.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So that it helped.\n\nALICE BABER: Um hmm. And there were all the ghosts of all these other painters there, too.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughter] That's a great tradition, that place.\n\nALICE BABER: It is.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, and you had worked.... What other kinds of things did you do? I mean, you couldn't come home and paint every single night, you know, and work every day.\n\nALICE BABER: Why not? [laughs]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, people do it, but not....\n\nALICE BABER: It sounds good. [laughter]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I mean, did you go to the galleries on Saturday, or the museums on the weekend, things like that?\n\nALICE BABER: Actually, you know, I don't.... We didn't go to the galleries on Saturdays then as much.... I mean, in the sense of.... That whole Saturday thing started a few years ago. I probably went to a lot of openings on Tuesday nights, go up from work. And I must say I don't remember. I mean, when you're in New York and you've just arrived, you do all kinds of things. You go to the theater, which you don't do later on, and, you know, you just generally indulge yourself. I spent a great deal of time in the Metropolitan looking at various artists. Sometimes I would look at Rubens, because although I didn't like RubensÄI didn't like many aspects of RubensÄI felt that there was a great deal about drawing that I could learn from looking at [him]. And I would sort of go from museum to museum. I think the museums in New York are part of the learning process as much as anything one ever does. And the Frick Museum is fantastic. There are a few things that I am still involved with from the Frick. One is Fragonard's The Swing, which I just love. I like the idea of something swinging through space. I don't think that's such a great painting anywayÄthat particular shoe, and the whole thingÄbut I like the idea of the swing, and I have made paintings with swings. And I think that The Blacksmith by Goya is probably the most complete painting of the figure that's ever been doneÄthe combination of a leg silhouetted against the red fire, the black lines, which are created both by the costume and also the artist just deciding to use a black line. In other words, I looked at that painting when I was trying to decide: Do you use line or don't you use line? You know, you have to decide at some time. And then, the.... Well, there are half a dozen key paintings in that museum. And of course the Modern Museum. I spent hours and hours there. The painting that was the biggest problem for me when I came is the Klee painting of the fish? I never remember the title of that.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: In the Modern, yeah.\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. And what I always wondered was, what is the backside? Each one of those shapes, what does the backside look like, if they're flat?\n\n[Interruption in taping]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Side two. Let's see, we now have you in 1953, roughly. You never studied in New York with anybody or anything, did you? There's no [institution] or school here [in the document PC is consultingÄEd.].\n\nALICE BABER: Well, by the time I arrived in New York, I felt that my student days were overÄnot my learning days. So I did a lot of drawing at the Art Students League. I'd go thereÄyou know, the dollar-a-model....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, right?\n\nALICE BABER: And some way or another, I stuck my head in one place or another around town. But, no, I didn't study with a master in New York.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: And you never got involved with any of the teachers at the League, particularly?\n\nALICE BABER: No. As a matter of.... And certainly not Hans Hofmann. He would have....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Why do you say that?\n\nALICE BABER: He would have been much too severe for me.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, really?\n\nALICE BABER: I could never have survived his teaching. I observed him teaching once. I think he was a great person. I admire most of his paintingsÄenormously. I mean, I think he had [a] great spirit, there's no doubt about it. But I observed one class that he taught, and I would have been very upset if someone had come and drawn over my drawing.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah, he would do that, wouldn't he?\n\nALICE BABER: And now I notice they're even doing shows of students of Hofmann that Hofmann drew over, and I still feel so strongly about it that even when I'm itching to put something on a student's workÄsimply because to show someone how to do it is easier than to say itÄI don't do it, because I think that it _____.... I know how I used to feel when a teacher would paint on somethingÄand it did happen to meÄI would have to destroy the painting. Oh, I have one painting to this day that Pickens painted on. And when I saw him after twenty years, I told him that the painting still existed and I would like for him to sign it, so it'd be the two of us.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: And he remembered it and he said he would be happy to.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, fantastic. That's marvelous. But it's very interesting that your reaction towards somebody else doing something to a surface that you have worked on is.... And it's fairly typical. There are some people who'd just say, \"Well, you know, the student, who cares about the student?\" But most people reject that kind of instruction. You know, it doesn't make something; it destroys something, it seems. That's really what happens.\n\nALICE BABER: I ran into an interesting problem last semester. I had a music student who was obviously very sensitive, who had had no art training, and he kept drawing things in the wrong direction. If the shoulder seemed to go to the right, he'd draw it to the left. And someone said to me, \"Well, maybe, you know, he has that particular vision where everything's reversed.\" And I sort of tested him in a number of ways, and he didn't, but I had this enormous desire just to even take his hand and say, \"Look, it goes that way.\" And I think the music student expected it, because many of them I'm sure that the music professors will say, \"Look, when you hold the bow of the violin, you hold it this way.\" And the only thing as a teacher of drawing that you can do is to demonstrate how to hold the chalk. I mean, you don't go up to someone, really and show them how.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, yeah.\n\nALICE BABER: I guess you could, but....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, a music teacher would bend your finger in the way....\n\nALICE BABER: That's right. Or hit them with a little hammer or something. [laughs]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: No, they really bend your fingers in the way....\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, really?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, yes, to hold the bow, because you have to hold it a certain way to control it. Otherwise, you don't....\n\nALICE BABER: That's right. Well, I discovered that some of my music students wanted me to literally bend their fingers, and they could not learn by copying.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, you, but you can't.... What if.... Holding a bow is a sense of feel....\n\nALICE BABER: Yes.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: ...and you can't get it by looking.\n\nALICE BABER: No, but, holding a piece of chalk is also a sense of feel....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right.\n\nALICE BABER: ...but the angle at which you hold it can be observed by looking, and you can't make somebody hold a chalk with the kind of delicacy that it requires to get that line. I think. Although I'm perfectly willing to try on somebody someday.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: But a bow is such a mechanical....\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. I think that the difference between performance and sort of trying to pull it outside, from the inside or something, must be different.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah, it is.\n\nALICE BABER: You obviously played, what, the violin?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Once, yeah, hmm.\n\nALICE BABER: [laughs]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: But I have a note here you did something at the Ecole des Beaux Arts at one point, but no dates. Is that fiction, or bad dates, or....\n\nALICE BABER: Well, that's interesting, because I didn't. Unless I.... I used to go to theÄI still do sometimesÄto the Cafe des Beaux Arts. [laughs]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: No, no, no. The other one's in Paris.\n\nALICE BABER: Or the Hotel des Beaux Arts.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: No, this is in Paris.\n\nALICE BABER: Ecole de Beaux Arts? You mean, the Beaux Arts verit‚, the real thing, huh?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah, in Paris, yeah.\n\nALICE BABER: No. Yeah, I think it might have been interesting to do that. Where'd you pick that up?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I don't know. I get all these bits of material some way; I don't always keep the source. You spent really quite a period of time in New York before you started to travel, didn't you?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. I was here straight through, I guess, until '58.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So it's like five years?\n\nALICE BABER: Umm.... Well, it was longer than that.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Roughly.\n\nALICE BABER: '52 to '58. Is that '59? Can you read that bio?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah.\n\nALICE BABER: Is that five years?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Seven, yeah.\n\nALICE BABER: It seems longer than five.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Seven. When did you start showing? Because the earliest thing that I've been able to find is in a Stable Annual of 1957.\n\nALICE BABER: That's right.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: That was the first kind of public adventure.\n\nALICE BABER: Um hmm.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How did that happen? Because those were....\n\nALICE BABER: Although, I think it.... I'd have to look at my biographical notes. I think I was in the Stable Annual before '57. Earlier. Somewhere along the line.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So you must've known somebody who'd been in it, because it was usually people....\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. I was selected by David Hare. Let me see what I have written here. This is for [last year], of course. Group shows. Here we go. That's what it says, '57. That must've been where you got it. Well, for whatever.... I think it was a little bit before that.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah.\n\nALICE BABER: I really should change that, that's true.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Should find out. Well, let's see, because you lived, where, on Leroy Street? [So you were _____ _____, Or were you already gone from].... Not Leroy Street?\n\nALICE BABER: No, I lived, and still do, on Bedford Street.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Bedford Street, right.\n\nALICE BABER: Bedford Mews, the courtyard behind Bedford Street.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right. I know lots of art people who've lived in that area.\n\nALICE BABER: I know very few. The Village by then was sort of depleted. All the artists [that] lived and worked on 10th Street.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah, but there were not a.... Well, there were literary people who lived over there, that's right. I knew writers.\n\nALICE BABER: Not that many.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: No, I mean, I knew writers who lived over there in that....\n\nALICE BABER: Well, let's see, on my block we have Elizabeth McCausland and.... Yes, there were and are a number of writers. But in a way, you see, it wasn't such a good neighborhood for painters, because those rooms are not....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: They're little.\n\nALICE BABER: ...and the ceilings aren't high enough for painting. My place happened to have a high ceiling, but it was small, and as soon as I could I got a studio on Thompson Street, I think it was, across from the church. Which I had for a number of years, until I was thrown out by the City Marshall, which is an interesting experience.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, really?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How did that happen?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, it was my own fault, because I didn't pay the rent for a monthÄI forgot to pay the rentÄand apparently they can come in and tear the door down and take out your stuff, anything that isn't on the bed. And I had removed the bed. So they did something that was illegal. They couldn't take the big paintings out, so they chopped them apart and destroyed them. And little paintings, though they took very carefully and painstakingly down to the garbage center where they preserved them, they would've sold them at auctionÄa week early, which would also have been illegalÄbut I did luckily find out in time, went down, retrieved my paintings. And the shock was pretty great, because I did lose some work [in that].\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Incredible. Yeah, that whole....\n\nALICE BABER: I paid my rent more faithfully.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah, that whole city marshal business is a real disaster.\n\nALICE BABER: You mean it's happened to you?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: No, but I know of so many people who have had problems.\n\nALICE BABER: It's happened to people, I think, who for one reason or another have gone to Europe, and their letter's gone astray, or whateverÄwhich was sort of my situation at the time. I wasn't here.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, what did you do those first few years, besides working and painting? You know, what was life like in New York for you?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I lived near a.... As a matter of fact, there was a sculptor from Indiana who moved in near me in the Cherry Lane property. His name is Jack Squier and he now teaches at Cornell. And Jack said to me one day, \"Why don't you go The Artists' Club?\" And I had been to one session a year before, and I hadn't known anyone, but someone had given me Peter Grippe's name, and I had called Peter Grippe. They knew Peter Grippe because he had been connected with.... Oh, who's the man who does the graphics in Paris? You know, the graphics man. But he'd had....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [StanleyÄEd.] Hayter.\n\nALICE BABER: Yes. They said, you know, Grippe's.... I don't know what the connection was, but it was connected in someone's mind. So Peter Grippe, of course.... A perfectly strange voice called him on the telephone, and he said, \"Yes,\" you know, I could come to The Club. So I did, but I really didn't know anyone. And I sort of observed and it was interesting, but I didn't go back for a while, and then Jack sort of said to me, \"Well, why don't you go up to The Club,\" and I did goÄquite faithfullyÄafter that.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: When would that have been?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, The Club sort of fell apart in one of those years, but I kept going anyway. Let's see, I went sort of all the way.... As soon as I started going I kept going.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Do you remember where it was when you first started really going to it?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, that first session was on 8th Street, and then the next time when I started going faithfully every week it was on Broadway. And then Philip [GustonÄEd.] quit, and then about that time we moved to 14th Street, and John was running it.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right.\n\nALICE BABER: And I did a lot of program planning at that time, with Irv Sandler. I did a program.... I suggested a program on color, and I did a panel in which I asked museum directors to come and speak, which was very amusing, [I must say]. I did a panel that I enjoyed enormously and some people did and some didn't. To this day, they still complain. It was a demonstration of a Noh play....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, really?\n\nALICE BABER: ...done in brown kimono, which is, you know, tuxedo for Japanese, with what [the] gestures mean and with an interpreter from the Japan Society. And naturally this was too far afield for some artists, and others remember it well. So I did do a lot of work, and I also helped do the mailings to get people to come and all that.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: What do you think The Club meant to you as a young artist coming to New York, having access to it in those days?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, as Wally Reese said to me once, it sort of proved that we existed for that week. You know, I mean, in the sense that you existed in terms of other people. He said, \"You know, there we are in our studios all day long and all night and it's fairly lonely, and then you come to The Club and you just say 'Hello' to somebody else and then you go home, but you feel that you've met some other people.\" And I liked it because, well, first of all, in those days all the artists that I had heard about or read about or whose work I admired went to The Club, so I could go and look at the face of the sage. It was one of my pleasures. And then people would get in [panels] and they would sort of scold each other, and it was very interesting. There was always that lively quality. Then there were a couple of people, like Louis Finkelstein and John Ferren, who would use expressions that I had never heard before, and I am not sure I've still heard them, but anyway....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: I was intrigued by this extension of my vocabulary. And then there was a way of talking that I had never heard, that Milton Resnick practiced, a kind of an ellipse of, you know, ideas. And I asked Marca-Relli once why so many of the artists did that, and he said, \"Because they got it from Picasso,\" which is really hilarious.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: Of course, de Kooning is I think one of the great speakers of all timeÄyou know, he's absolutely fabulous. He has a tendency to make abrupt statements, which have a certain life of their own. I don't know if other people were involved. I think everyone was just involved in their own language, really. And it was interesting to hear how they talked about art, or how they.... Or even how they felt about language, because sometimes they didn't want to talk about art.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right.\n\nALICE BABER: And then there were the ones who were drunk who would come in and insult other people, or.... Some of the younger artists who felt upset; I think they didn't feel that they were very important. I didn't suffer from that, because I had all this proper humility, you see. [laughter]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, did you get to know people like [LandesÄEd.] Lewitin?\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, sure.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: ...who, you know, [is some part of it].\n\nALICE BABER: And then of course Lewitin would always come to look at your work and to tell you what was wrong with it. I didn't have a tendency to invite people to my studioÄI either was shy or I didn't feel I was strong enough for that kind of thingÄbut I know my first show [________ÄEd.], on 10th Street, Landes came in and he looked at one of these paintings, and he said, \"Now, this is interesting, but....\" And he talked about the division of the space. He said.... It was, as a matter of fact, a cow's skull, which was sort of placed diagonally on the canvas, and he said, \"This space in the corner, of the horn on one side, and this space over here are too similar,\" or whatever. You know, we talked about that kind of thing, and [he,it] was very interesting. And he.... He's the one who said that you can't use green. I was very upset by this, and I asked Ray [Placewicz]. I was at Ray's studio and Ray was using green, and I said, \"Ray, do you know you're not supposed to use green?\" And Ray said, \"Oh, aren't you?\" So that was the end of that.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: But what I found out much later was that I think Landes got the idea of green from Mondrian himself, whom he must have known, or from reading Mondrian. Because Mondrian's the only artist I know who said, you know, green is not to be used. So there was all kinds of, you know, that kind of thing, where you were sort of pursuing other people's madnesses; it was always very interesting.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, did your first one-man show at the March Gallery, on 10th Street.\n\nALICE BABER: Right. Yes. That's the show that Landes criticized the cow's head.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right. And those are really kind of the high years of 10th Street, weren't they?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I caught 10th Street as it was going slightly down.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, I mean, but this was.... What was that, nineteen-fifty.... What was the year of the show? '58.\n\nALICE BABER: Well, let's say it was in its Golden Age then. [laughter]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Because I know by '61 or '2 it was pretty old.\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I was gone. The Tanager Gallery had been such an admirable place. And my only complaint about them now is that I feel that they did help destroy 10th Street, for purposes of their own, as they got more and more irritable with other galleries starting. Okay, so they accepted the Camino and the March and all these other galleries. But they finally would not open the same night, and if you don't have a kind of festive night there's not much point in it. Do you remember when they changed their night?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah, right.\n\nALICE BABER: And I think after that it just couldn't be the same.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: But I think also that the generation was changing, the economics were changing, that people who had struggled through 10th Street, who were being picked up by uptown galleriesÄthey were leaving New York, in some casesÄthat.... You know, the Tanager did exist for ten years, shoot.\n\nALICE BABER: Well, they were the pioneer, that's what I mean, you know.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah.\n\nALICE BABER: And they may have felt a little exaltedly. The other galleries I felt at the time were serving a very important function, and I think it's happened again in SoHo and I find it very exciting. I think that cooperative galleries are absolutely essential for an art scene, and I, like the others, I was just in the process of being asked to be in an uptown showÄout of 10th Street. But I believed in 10th Street, a lot more than most people did.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, I don't know. I think a more people did than really wanted to admit it.\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I never understood why they even had lip service against it. Because people do. They feel in some way that the whole thing was sort of murky. I don't know why.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, I don't think so. I think it served a great purpose, and I think the fact that they would do those Spring shows or Christmas shows, you know, and deKooning would always lend a little not-for-sale drawing, and things, you know....\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, right.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: ...brought a lot of people there.\n\nALICE BABER: Well, sure it did.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You know, because those festive nights the street was jammed with people. You couldn't go anywhere without running over somebody.\n\nALICE BABER: I think that the art world is alive as long as we have thatÄas long as we have a club, a night, a place to goÄand we haven't had it for a few years. And I think that we ought to have it again.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, one thing that's always intrigued me is that there's never been a cafe life in New York the way there has been in Paris, or even in London or Rome.\n\nALICE BABER: Right.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: And the Cedar Bar, which was the place.... [laughter]\n\nALICE BABER: The place, right.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: ...where everybody went, served a purpose, but it seemed to really cut off at a certain point.\n\nALICE BABER: The trouble with the Cedar Bar, as I look back on it, was that, unlike a cafe in Paris where if you're rather shy you can always go take the table in the corner and sort of sit there and it's all right....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You couldn't at the Cedar.\n\nALICE BABER: The Cedar Bar, if you walked in the door.... Like you made your grand entrance, complete with remarks. Friends had to come to your aid, your enemies hitting you, and whatever. But it was.... Because of one night I was brave enough to go and sit in the Cedar Bar, and sort of take my medicine by making myself sit thereÄI feel the same way about going to movies so.... you know, everyone else's pleasure is my pain. But, that was the night that Phillip sort of went round and asked all the people that he saw and knew if they'd like to be in the March Gallery. And I was very pleased. And then I asked [________ÄEd.] Zogbaum.... You know, we thought it would be nice to get some of the other artists who didn't have a gallery at that moment, or who did, or whoever would be interested in showing. And Zog asked Elaine de Kooning, and so forth. So it quickly, you know, increased. And of course our rent was thirty dollars a month, or something like that, so that your dues were three dollars a month. And I was.... Pat [Catalog] called me one Saturday and she said, \"Come over and help sweep the floor.\" And I had worked all week and I didn't want to sweep the floor on Saturday, I wanted to paint. So I worked out a scheme. I said I'll be treasurer. I knew it was the one job everyone hates. As a matter of fact, I'm terrible with figures, I can't keep my own books, but I did a very good job there. And I think I made both friends and enemies, because I sent out humorous notes about.... I can't imagine how they were humorous now, but they really were. You know, \"Pay up now, or else,\" that sort of thing.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: And everybody paid except Paul Georges, who was an honoraryÄbecause he couldn't help itÄmember of the March Gallery for about a year. And Felix [________ÄEd.] would not take him off the list, and I don't.... Maybe Paul finally paid.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, how could he be an honorary member?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, because he didn't send his dues.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, I see, that way. [laughter]\n\nALICE BABER: Yeah.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So by not paying you become honorary?\n\nALICE BABER: [laughter] Well, naturally.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Not honorable.\n\nALICE BABER: That's exactly.... There is a difference. [laughter]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, the March was, what.... Was that organized by Felix, then?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, absolutely. And Felix's energy did the whole thing, because it was in his building. He was sort of snooping around his own building one day, and he found this basement....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: The space, yeah.\n\nALICE BABER: ...that was filthy, that was thirty dollars a monthÄand everybody perked up at that. I mean, what could you get even then for thirty dollars a month? So when he called us all together, he said, \"Here's the deal....\"Äyou know, we all met in this horrible spaceÄand he said, \"All right, now we have to paint it and fix it up,\" and that had to do with sweeping the floor, too. Well, we all did. I mean, a few weekends were spent, the painting, fixing it up.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Putting it together, yeah.\n\nALICE BABER: And I remember Felix saying, with his particular way of speaking, complaining bitterly that he had collected together a bunch of intellectuals who couldn't hammer a nail. [laughter] But someone must've hammered a nail. We finally, we got it. It went very well.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How long did that exist then, with those people?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I don't know. It's funny, you see, I can't remember when it ended. It's sort of open-ended for me.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, you were associated with it how long?\n\nALICE BABER: I was associated I suppose two or three years. And then I was in Paris, but I was.... I mean, that's the kind of thing where I would have sent my dues if it was still going on. But I think the people who started it probably managed to stay with it for a couple of years. Felix then got disinterested at some point and later went off to Mexico and whatever. And I don't really know. But like all the galleries, you see, people who were in them changed fairly frequently.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right. Do you think that a similar kind of ambiance has developed in SoHo now? I mean, the galleries are larger and there's international.... I mean, there's a lot more money, which is about as different as you can be from 10th Street. [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: Yeah, right. Yes. That's what I like about SoHo now. As I said, I think....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: The community.\n\nALICE BABER: I think it's absolutely essential to be able to go out in the street, see other artists wandering around, buying their art supplies, or whatever they're doing. And the galleries that are somehow unofficialÄand even unsungÄwhere if you have a show and if you can get your friends and your peers to come, you can still have a show that people will remember and talk about. As a few friends still do about my show at the March Gallery. I mean, people will still say to me, \"I remember such and such a painting,\" and of course I think they're wonderful that they can remember, and I find it extraordinary. But I think it is true in SoHo. I wish there were more galleries. And I think the problem now of course is probably press coverage. We desperately need, I think, writing and press and small magazines printed on the same level as SoHo itselfÄnot magazines that have to be backed and, you know, whatever. And there isn't one and never has been.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, there was It Is at one point.\n\nALICE BABER: Well, sure, but It Is, you see, was in itself really a rather well done magazine.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Grand.\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, exactly. And so its intention was that it would be.... I have always thought that it would be good to get everybody writing, for better or worse, about each other. Artists writing about artists on a level where if the, we Xerox it, you see. Because I think that by the time it finally, the whole thing, gets in the magazineÄof course, right now the magazines are in crisis because.... Apparently they're in crisis, because they don't review very muchÄor the reviews are like three lines.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, either that or they review four people and they each get half a column and the rest of it's photographs.\n\nALICE BABER: Right.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Some of their _____ _____ production costs have gotten to be horrendous.\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, yes. I mean, and just the paper, that used to be the least expense, now when you get an estimate from a printer, it seems to cost more than anything else.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, I talked to an editor friend of mine this morning, and he said in the last year their paper prices have doubled, and they have to reserve paper now for books that they're going to print in October and November. [chuckles]\n\nALICE BABER: Well, yes, you see, in my January show I had a brochure that was done in Pennsylvania by a printer recommended to me [________ÄEd.] Sothegar and he had done all this research around town and he found a splendid printer. And I called the printer and I told him, \"Stand by for the brochure,\" and when the time came to print it he put it on coated stock on both sides, and I said, \"Well, my people don't like that because the stamps don't stick.\" And he said, \"Well, you either get that or nothing, because that's the paper that I have left over from something else, and I've ordered the other kind, but it hasn't come in.\" So now that I'm having a show in about a week, at another gallery, they said, \"Would please get hold of the printer,\" and so forth, because they had liked the brochure. So I called them up and, yes, the price had doubled for the whole thingÄin terms of quantity. I mean, I had like 3,000 in January, and for this show there's 2,000. And I think it's the paper cost as much as anything.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, paper and printing and everything.\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, everything.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: I mean, it's.... The art book for forty dollars, with lots of color plates, you've seen the last of them.\n\nALICE BABER: Not if they're remaindered.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, but they're not even possible to produce them anymore.\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, I know. I mean, the rumor is of course all around town that all art books are stopping. And I think that's terribly sad because....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Unless they're subsidized.\n\nALICE BABER: ...in a way we have had this art reproduction kind of world of art that we've lived [on]....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah, portable art world.\n\nALICE BABER: Portable art world, right.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It's terrible. I mean, through my activity with publishers, I'm astounded at what's happened to costs within the last three or four year. It's really incredible. And now with the devaluation of the money it's no longer cheaper to print in Japan, or Italy or....\n\nALICE BABER: Oh, really. Oh, is that's what's happening?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, sure, I mean, that's the other thing that's happening.\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I can tell you, a terrific printer up in [Lancaster], Pennsylvania, now.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: [laughs] Good. Anyway, getting back to the March Gallery here, what kind of reactions did you have from your first show? You know, what was it like, I mean, having....\n\nALICE BABER: Well, first of all, I think that my friends in the art world were very positive, and they were very pleased that I had a show, and there was that whole feeling that you have when you've done something, where you're getting enormous support and encouragement. And I was just very glad that I had had it. I found that it was hard work to have a show. You know, there were a lot of things, a\n\nspellcheck done of draft???\n\n...hm .66\"\n\nTape 1, side A (continued)\n\nlot of obstacles, but I was very.... I've been very lucky, and I really should knock on all kinds of wood. Generally speaking, I've had good criticism when I've shown. And I always feel terribly grateful that I've never gotten....\n\nTape 2, side A\n\n[The traffic noise on this tape side is substantially increased and some of the nuances of conversation are lost.ÄTrans.]\n\nALICE BABER: ...[severe or harsh criticismÄEd.] at least at any time when I'm particularly vulnerable, and I think one is usually vulnerable, you know, one way or another?\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: You sure are, sure. Because there's your life.\n\nALICE BABER: Yeah. And in a way, I mean, you're putting up these things and you're saying that this is what you do and this is what you care about, and so you're absolutely a sitting victim if anybody wants to let you have it. And so I've always been very grateful, really, that I've had people write about my work who often gave me an insight into what I had done. In other words, it had added a dimension to it in some way, rather than the business of saying....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Oh, really? That's interesting, yeah. That's unusual, because so many people seem bitter about the criticism they've gotten, even if it's good.\n\nALICE BABER: [laughs] Yeah, right.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: \"I only got two columns,\" you know, \"It should've been a full page.\" [laughs]\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I'm trying to think. I remember John Ashbery wrote something for me in Paris once, in which he described my colors, and he talked, I think, if I remember, about the cool.... Something like the cool blue and purples of the yeah, expressionist palette. And I didn't think of myself as an expressionist, and yet I've always like expressionism, I mean, you know, but I'm always sort of intrigued byÄparticularly of poet-writersÄby the kind of vision that they have of this.\n\nBABER, ALICE\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, just to kind of go through the exhibition aspects of all of this, you then went off to Paris, right, sometime? When did you go off to Paris?\n\nALICE BABER: In '58, I believe.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: '58. And you had exhibitions there at various places, right? You had one there?\n\nALICE BABER: I had one at the....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: '63.\n\nALICE BABER: Right. The English Library was the first one-man show. I had a four-man show at Carl [Flinger], and I was chosen to be in the [June] Biennale one year, when that was just getting started. It was the second year of that.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right. Second one. How did you like being a young American artist in Paris in those days? Because the New York art \"mafia\" were taking over the world by that time, almost, and my experience through correspondence and things is that European artists were very defensive about their position.\n\nALICE BABER: Well, that's interesting.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: ...and you were there, and you were exhibiting and sort of had become involved with the French arts world to some extent, and what happened, what was the kind of reaction about?\n\nALICE BABER: [You] didn't find them defensive, I mean if anything I was defensive. I mean, Paris was a very tough, strong town, and I felt like they were in it, you know, they had the barricades already there.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: No, but still you exhibited, you were in some of the important group exhibitions there.\n\nALICE BABER: We were always the etranger, there's no doubt about it. And the international art world there is very amusing, but you know that you're never part of, the sort of the French scene [because] the French scene is itself basically the bourgeois family life, which isn't leading anyway. So one always feels in many ways a kind of marvelous sense that you're outside of the society. And I think when you're not in your own country that it's quite pleasant in a way, to feel that you're your own person and that you're sort of untouched by all.... In France I think you always feel that they don't really want you, you see, but then you're not sure that you want to take on all the responsibilities that are involved with being one of them. So I think that this has always been the advantage of being in the so-called international world in Paris. And when I went, I suppose there was probably an advantage in the fact that American art had achieved some recognition because possibly we were reported to respect thatÄyou know, that at least we'd come of age in America, or something like that. But I didn't have quite the sense that you've described. I mean, I felt very much.... I was absolutely unknown and felt sort of unwelcomed. However, as soon as I did show, I remember getting a very nice critical article in Le Monde describing again the color in my work. And when I went back many years later with another showÄI think it was four or five years later, which in New York is a length of time where, you know, you might as well be deadÄand the critic from Le MondeÄanother critic, actually; I mean, a different set of initialsÄdescribed my work and described how the yellows were different from the yellows four years before or the reds were different.... I mean, it was incredible, this kind of precision and memory that was involved. So you see once you're established in Paris they don't forget you. And so it's well worth making this effort to be part of that scene, whatever it is. In New York, I mean, you constantly sort of have to keep showing up. But what I didn't like about Paris was that I thought I could never do anything there. I could never get a bunch of people together and start a cooperative gallery. You know, the activity always seemed limited to me. Except, one night, Pierre [Soulage, Soulange] also agreed that not enough was going on and that we ought to do something at one of the restaurants, like they used to have in the banquet years, kind of thing, something a little more on the cafe, where the artists could get together and perhaps.... Again, it was the American artists offering like the idea of the club night, and Pierre and a few artists who, like Pierre, were in favor of this. And we just sort of didn't get it done. But of course Pierre was also the person who was very instrumental in getting the big show of all the artists in for a time called [Les Siren de Pendon], which was a show like the [Salon de May], only it was a.... The museum was being used by artists nobody knew, and the show had no spirit or wasn't known about, so we all sort of took over and everybody put a painting in that show. And then it became a lively show. ]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Where did you meet Paul in all of this?\n\nALICE BABER: I met him in New York.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Soon after you were here?\n\nALICE BABER: No, no. Not until about '58.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: '58. [writes a note?ÄTrans.] I can't remember all those years. [laughter] But you know.... Well, he had been to Paris before, hadn't he, if I remember?\n\nALICE BABER: Yes.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: So that he knew people there. Was that advantageous? I mean, did it make life simpler, do you think? Or not?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, he had, he had already met and fought with Dubuffet. [laughter]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right.\n\nALICE BABER: So, yes, in a way, of course. He did know a number of people. But I don't think you ever know as many people in Paris as you know in New York.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Really? Why so?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I think that one's circle in Paris is always fairly small.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Maybe people aren't as gregarious, or something.\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, for some reason. I mean, in spite of the cafe life.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: It's more ritualistic, yeah.\n\nALICE BABER: That's freer, but.... New York is a continuous floating crap game, there's no doubt about it. And in Paris they have all these thingsÄclosing the doors at night, you know.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Lock up the city.\n\nALICE BABER: Um hmm.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Well, how'd you like living there? Because you didn't live there for one period, didn't you, and sort of going back and forth?\n\nALICE BABER: I didn't like it when I first went there, and then I liked it very much at the end. But I think for me Paris is a city that it's slow to get to know. I was never enamored of it as many people are when they go and they think it's very beautifulÄumm, compared to Venice, I mean, well, Paris is beautiful. [embarrassed chuckle] I mean, it doesn't seem extraordinary to me, Paris, it always seems.... It got so it felt like home, or a perfectly natural kind of place to be. And since New York is kind of monumentalÄI mean, everything here is so heavyÄthe buildings and the size and.... There's something sort of totally grandiose here, so that you tend to fall into it and then you don't think about [what has happened, what's happening]. In Paris, the fact that the buildings are only so high and there are a certain number of trees, seemed normalÄlike that's the way one ought to live. But I think have a bit of Mondrian in me. I really like the city. The country doesn't appeal to me. I think just because the place has trees is not enough. And after all those vistas in Paris [are from the] nineteenth century, so....\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Right.\n\nALICE BABER: I think I would've like Paris when it was all like the Marais, you know. [laughter]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Really early.\n\nALICE BABER: A mess. [laughter]\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: Yeah. Well, you had a show in London....\n\nALICE BABER: Yes, that was an interesting thing.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: ...at the New Vision Center, which was always a rather interesting place, I understand.\n\nALICE BABER: Very much so.\n\nPAUL CUMMINGS: How did that come about?\n\nALICE BABER: Well, I was in London for a show of American artists at the Embassy. And we had then a man in London who was superb, called Stephan Munsing. He still is. He still is involved with art one way or another at the State Department, and so forth. And sometimes he gets sent off and in sort of an ambassadorial something or other. I think he's back in Denmark at the moment. Usually he's involved with art. And I met him because [AdolphÄEd.] Gottlieb told me in Paris that.... He said, \"There's this wonderful man in London who is so helpful.\" He said, \"When I had a show in London, he helped me to do a lithograph that was in the Tube,\" o"
