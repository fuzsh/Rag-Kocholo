This document provides an overview of abstract expressionism, an American post-World War II art movement. It discusses how abstract expressionism put New York City at the center of the Western art world, surpassing Paris. The movement combined elements of German Expressionism and European abstract styles like Futurism and Cubism. Though the artists had different styles, from Pollock's action paintings to Rothko's color fields, they were all classified as abstract expressionists. The movement gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s due to the political climate after WWII. Key art critics like Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg promoted different abstract expressionist artists.",
