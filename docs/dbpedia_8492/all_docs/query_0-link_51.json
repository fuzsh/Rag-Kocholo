        "text": "From Art in Embassies:\n\nAlice Baber began painting at the age of eight, later studying art at Lindenwood College for Women in St. Charles, Missouri and Indiana University. She also traveled worldwide, studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Fontainebleau, France, and lived in Paris throughout the late fifties and sixties. She was a member of the March Gallery on Tenth Street in New York City and was art editor of McCall’s magazine. Baber was instrumental in organizing exhibitions of women artists at a time when women were still struggling to gain prominence in the international art world. Baber’s legacy is honored at the Baber Midwest Modern Art Collection of the Greater Lafayette Museum of Art in Indiana, and the Alice Baber Memorial Art Library in East Hampton, Long Island, New York. Her paintings are in major museum collections throughout the world. Baber’s work is recognized for its luminous, abstract shapes, particularly in stained canvases filled with clear, radiant color. Her compositions often consist of multiple round or ovoid shapes."
