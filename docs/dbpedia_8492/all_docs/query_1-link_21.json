        "text": "AFEW weeks short of his 77th birthday, Manuel Alvarez Bravo is being honored by a retrospective of his photographs at the Center for Inter‐American Relations, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street. The show, which runs through Feb. 4, numbers 185 prints, covering more than 50 years. It was organized by Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art and will travel to Tucson, Ariz., and Toledo, Ohio. It comes with an illustrated catalogue that also contains es says by Jane Livingston, the Corcoran's associate directo, and Alex Castro, who presides over the Hollow Press publishing house and is himself an artist.\n\nManuel Alvarez Bravo, a native and resident of Mexico City, grew up in “an atmosphere where art was breathed,” though not, apparently, prosperity, for he was already out to work at the age of 13 while also studying accounting. The accounting eventually ‘gave way to classes in literature, painting and music, and by his early 20's, the young man, still taking clerical jobs, had developed an interest in photography.\n\nA meeting, in 1927, with the fabulous Tina Modotti seemed to have been pivotal, for she not only suggested that he send examples of his work to Edward Weston (favorably received), but also introduced him to Diego Rivera. Two years, later, Bravo was teaching photography at the Escuela Central de Artes Plasticas, of which Rivera was director. Then, when Tina Modotti was deported from Mexico, Bravo inherited her job at Mexican Folkways magazine, which led to his meeting David Alfaro Siqueiros, Jose Clement Orozco and other artists engaged in freeing native art from Spanish colonial bondage. After a year working as a cameraman for Sergei Eisenstein, Bravo became a freelance specializing in the reproduction of works of\n\nOther high points of the 1930's included a show with Henri Cartier‐Bresson in New York and an encounter with Andre Breton and the Surrealist movement. After a long period teaching and practicing cinematography, Bravo helped start a Mexican foundation that publishes books on the fine arts. He is still a director of this organization and remains its chief photographer as well.\n\nAlex Castro points out that the very nature of Bravo's work is an impediment to its understanding, especially by non‐Mexicans hungry for the exotic. Certainly, Bravo is not easily placed in context with his contemporaries: Where their Mexico is muscular and sometime bloody, his is tranquil and sunlit.\n\nBoth Bravo and the muralists Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros were inspired by European modernism and applied it to their own specifically Mexican ends. In a way, they were replacing old colonialism with new. But while Rivera created out of this a militant social realism, Bravo seems to have blended European style and native imagery with a greater detachment.\n\nMaybe his approach results in a greater “truth”: There is undoubtedly something very real about his bloody “Striking Worker Murdered” of 1934, where death is presented as nothingness. More macabre but still unsensational is “Wineskins,” a 1969 photograph of cattle carcasses wrapped in cheesecloth and slung from a tripod in what appears to be a marketplace.\n\nNeither Cubism nor Surrealism enslaved this photographer, though he experimented with Cubism in some studies of folded paper and with Surrealism in such pictures as “Good Reputation Sleeping.” In this, a mysterious nude, partly bandaged, lies in the sun, her reputation “protected” by a still life of fruits like prickly pears beside her. Other photographers have affected Bravo, though, especially Edward Weston, and he has also produced his share of photographic perennials—pictures of carousel‐type horses, an tique store signs, store mannequins and the like. But in recent years, he has grown more interested in landscape, the play of light and shadow, textures and, most important, color.\n\nWhen the most striking pictures in each phase of the artist's career are gathered together, they are undatable except for technical reasons. No one, surely, could guess that 10 years or so separate a street scene with white laundry strung high like bunting (1932) from the later study of a young girl standing on a shaded balcony, one shoulder flecked with sunlight. These are in turn related to “Well‐Earned Sleep,” a 1966 print of a black‐andwhite dog sleeping in the sun beside a disused gate. And again, the same laconic atmosphere characterizes “Portrait of the Eternal” (1932‐33), where a beam of light catches the profile, the long dark hair, the hand holding a mirror and the lap of a young woman in an otherwise darkened\n\nIn addition to several landscapes studded with succulents and some richly colored city scenes, the show also features portraits. Remarkable among these is a study of young Mayan girl whose facial forms recall Olmec heads. Viewers may be amused by Bravo's version of Siquieros, looking very much the maestro with flared nostrils and an imperious stare. His Orozco looks more modest sitting in his studio bent over a ruler and some papers.\n\nThe picture of Bravo's that Weston liked best was among the least typical: a 1929 shot of a boy naked from the waste down and urinating, for some reason, into an enamel bowl. It more or less picks up where Weston's own 1925 torso of his son Neill, naked from shoulder to just above the groin, leaves off.\n\nWithout knowing Mexico, it is impossible either to confirm or question Jane Livingston's verdict that Bravo is his country's greatest photographer. But there's no doubt he's a major artist and a very exportable one, too.\n\nOther shows this week include:\n\nAlice Baber (Sachs, 29 West 57th Street): Using a triangular module that suggests glass weathered by water, Alice Baber repeats it in clusters and skeins on a white ground. Colors are gray, beige, blue, pink and yellow, and they are sometimes so faint as to be nearly imperceptible. Though the image is flat to all appearances, depth is occasionally and somewhat arbitrarily suggested by passages of dark blue and brown where the transparent forms overlap. A prominent colorist since the early 60's, Alice Baber has charted a course somewhere between Abstract Expressionism and Color Field painting. Her work has always been attractive, but in bulk it can become a little irritating for being so very refined and demure. However, this is her most interesting series to date. (Through tomorrow.)\n\n•\n\nJo Anne Schneider (Alonzo, 30 West 57th Street): Many of Jo Anne Schneider's canvases are about the way light hits the polished surfaces of aluminum and silver; “Silver Vase ‘With Leaf,” for instance, is a skillfully organized range of grays broken by the green of the leaf and its reflection. The artist enlarges her images a couple of times life‐size, but confines them within relatively small formats, sometimes washing the picture overall in red or purple glazes. The paint is uniformly thin, permitting the canvas grain to show through. So fascinated is she by the metallic that she tends to confer its properties on other materials, such as the canvas of mailbags or paper. The exhibition includes life‐size drawings in a gimlet line of other domestic items, including an ice cream scoop and a snarl of electric cord with plugs. There is a lonely, constricted feeling about the work, as if the artist needed an outlet grander than that provided by her domestic subject matter. (Through tomorrow.)"
