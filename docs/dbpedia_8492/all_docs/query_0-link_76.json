        "text": "The Abstract Expressionist movement is best known for its male superstars, but women were also pioneers of the genre. This exhibition showcases the work of artists such as Lee Krasner, Elaine DeKooning, Perle Fine, Joan Mitchell, and others—women whose artwork finds long overdue acclaim and new appreciation with a contemporary audience. We are also celebrating women whose work, while not abstract, is associated with the Abstract Expressionist era and are individuals who were part of the New York art scene, such as Mercedes Matter, Hedda Sterne, Jane Freilicher and Jane Wilson.\n\nThis exhibition features works that are both visually mesmerizing and technically complex. It offers the widest breadth of any private assemblage of this genre, featuring the works of 32 women artists. The artwork on display demonstrates the various ways these artists were pushing themselves in new directions as leaders and full participants in the Abstract Expressionism movement.\n\nAbstract Expressionism was the first specifically American style to achieve international influence, and, as a result, 1940s New York replaced Paris as the center of the art world. The style was characterized by experimental, gestural, and nonrepresentational painting. For some of the artists associated with the movement, abstract art and blurring the lines between representational and abstraction was a means of expressing ideas concerning nature, the spiritual, and the mind. For others, it was a way to explore formal and technical concerns.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1951, several Abstract Expressionists, among them Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Hans Hofmann, and Mark Rothko, developed their signature painting styles. During the following years, these artists, informally called the First Generation of the New York School, received growing recognition nationally and globally. Several groundbreaking women artists from this same period are featured in this exhibition, including Elaine de Kooning, Lee Krasner, Hedda Sterne, Helen Frankenthaler, Grace Hartigan, and Joan Mitchell. Heroines of the Abstract Expressionist Era also includes works by painters such as Perle Fine, Mary Abbott, Dorothy Dehner, Audrey Flack, and Michael (Corinne) West and sculptors Louise Nevelson and Louise Bourgeois.\n\nFor more than sixty years, the contributions these women made to the movement were all but forgotten while works by men such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning have been canonized in the history of American art. It has taken the dedication of scholars and curators—and the commitment of a handful of visionary collectors like Rick Friedman and Cindy Lou Wakefield—to restore these women artists to their rightful place in the history of American art.\n\nCOLLECTORS RICK FRIEDMAN AND CINDY LOU WAKEFIELD reside in Southampton on the East End of Long Island, NY, where many Abstract Expressionist painters lived and worked, dating back to the 1950’s. These artists, pioneering a new art genre, had indelible impact and presence that can still be felt today in this arts centric community of over 1,500 artists.\n\nIt was Wakefield, a popular Southampton educator who was freelance writing for the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center in East Hampton, who, on their first date, encouraged Friedman to explore and seek out work by these artists. Inspired after reading the book, “Hamptons Bohemia: Two Centuries of Artists and Writers on the Beach” written by Helen A. Harrison, Director of the Pollock-Krasner House, Friedman began to focus their collection on these 1948-60’s “local painters.” Since many of these local painters help ignite and champion the most significant art movement in America in the 20th century, Abstract Expressionism, Wakefield and Friedman realized that the importance of these regional artists expanded way past the pristine beaches and tony hamlets of the Hamptons, so much so that, the artists of the Hamptons were the artists of America.\n\nTheir earliest purchase together was Elaine DeKooning’s Cave #24, red oxide wall, Friedman still recalls the elation and strong emotion both felt hanging it seeing it on the wall of his home. Now bitten by the “collecting bug,” this launched them on an endless 16 year long journey in researching and acquiring both male and female artists of the AbEx era and so-called New York School.\n\nFor the last 17 years, Cindy Lou and I have enjoyed the never-ending journey of researching and assembling a collection “talented but underappreciated “women artists who helped pioneer 1950’s era AbEx movement, the so- called New York School, and their Subsequent migration to the East End.\n\nIn recent years, the art world has since embraced their contributions, resulting in several museum show, books, insatiable demand for their works.\n\nFeaturing 32 of the most acclaimed women artists of that NYC based movement, with over 100 pieces, this is perhaps the most comprehensive survey to date, produced in this genre.\n\nAlthough our collection was displayed prior at the Fenimore Art Museum and the Nassau County Museum of Art, we feel that SAC the most appropriate venue for this newly expanded survey. Over the past half century, many of the artists in this show, pioneers of the AbEx movement, proudly exhibited their work in this historic SAC building during their illustrious careers. So, this is sort of a “homecoming” show for them.\n\nThis Fall 2023 show provides guests a “rediscovery” of the break-though, and innovative midcentury art movement, considered by many to be America’s most significant art movement of the 20th century. It also provides new generation of viewers an opportunity to discover these important artists, many of whom lived and worked locally.\n\nWe have enthusiastically worked closely with Christina Strassfield over the years, and value her deep understanding, respect, and appreciation for these artists’ oeuvre and their important contributions to art in America. Her long experience helped guide this curation and display.\n\nWe are very enthusiastic to team up again with SAC, having produced the Hamptons Fine Art Fair on their grounds 2 years ago.\n\nWe are pleased to offer select pieces available for public acquisition, a portion of which benefits SAC ."
