        "text": "LOS ANGELES — On Tuesday, August 29 at noon Pacific time, John Moran Auctioneers will present its Summer Art & Design sale, featuring more than 300 lots. Absentee and Internet live bidding will be available through LiveAuctioneers. Likely top lots include works by artists Alice Baber, Raimond Staprans and Lê Phổ as well as furniture designer Adrian Pearsall.\n\nLeading the pack are works by a major woman artist of the Abstract Expressionist movement, Alice Baber (American, 1928-1982). In the past year, John Moran Auctioneers has continuously achieved phenomenal results for the artist — including setting her top three world auction records. With continued national and international interest, Baber’s market doesn’t show any sign of cooling off. The August 29 auction showcases three works by Baber, with the collection’s highlight, The Door To The Gate To The Bridge, dated 1975, carrying an estimate of $50,000-$70,000. Blue Leaf to Shell from her 1975 Tragedy of Color Series, and Red + Blue Deluge, both watercolors, will add to the breadth of Baber offerings with estimates of $4,000-$6,000 and $3,000-$5,000, respectively.\n\nRaimond Staprans (Latvian and American, b. 1926-), describes his paintings as “purely Californian.” They each carry his signature palette of saturated blues, oranges, greens and yellows, and all convey his style of color, light, geometry and perception. This sale will feature his 1995 oil-on-canvas A Study of Down-Rolling Oranges with a Staid Neon Apple, estimated at $40,000-$60,000. This painting exemplifies Staprans’s distinctly Californian sensibility. His mastery as an artist has also been compared to that of Paul Cézanne, whose still lifes emphasize the underlying geometric structure of objects arranged in compositions with slightly skewed perspectives. In A Study of Down-Rolling Oranges with a Staid Neon Apple, we see this comparison in the arrangement of the oranges, which are deliberately placed on a table with somewhat distorted perspectives. The orange motif comes up frequently in the artist’s work, as it is as engrained in the California landscape as much as Staprans is devoted to painting it.\n\nRepresenting the selection of international art is Les Tulipes Rouges et Blanches by Lê Phổ. Born in Vietnam in 1907, Phổ studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts of Hanoi between 1925 and 1930. His artistic mentor, Victor Tardieu, was a friend and companion of Matisse who encouraged Lê Phổ to paint with vibrant colors and expressive brushstrokes in a manner reminiscent of the noted Fauvist. The oeuvre of Lê Phổ is typically divided into three distinct periods, with the final period beginning in 1963 when his work was noticed by the American gallerist Wally Findlay, owner of the Findlay Galleries. Les Tulipes Rouges et Blanches is an example of the artist’s still lifes from this period and was originally sold by the Wally Findlay Galleries. It is estimated at $60,000-$80,000 and comes with a letter of authenticity from the Findlay Foundation.\n\nChoice furniture pieces include a Paul Evans-style cabinet by Adrian Pearsall. The Brutalist cabinet, made in the 1970s for Craft Associates, is estimated at $2,000-$4,000. This piece is after Paul Evans’s Goop cabinet design, having a four-door credenza with a wood carcass and applied bronze-colored, faux-patinated resin slathered onto the wood surface.\n\n[av_button label=’Click to view the auction catalog and sign up to bid’ icon_select=’no’ icon=’ue800′ font=’entypo-fontello’ link=’manually,https://www.liveauctioneers.com/catalog/298641_art-design/?keyword=&page=1′ link_target=’_blank’ size=’small’ position=’center’ label_display=” title_attr=” size-text=” av-desktop-font-size-text=” av-medium-font-size-text=” av-small-font-size-text=” av-mini-font-size-text=” margin=” margin_sync=’true’ padding=” padding_sync=’true’ av-desktop-margin=” av-desktop-margin_sync=’true’ av-desktop-padding=” av-desktop-padding_sync=’true’ av-medium-margin=” av-medium-margin_sync=’true’ av-medium-padding=” av-medium-padding_sync=’true’ av-small-margin=” av-small-margin_sync=’true’ av-small-padding=” av-small-padding_sync=’true’ av-mini-margin=” av-mini-margin_sync=’true’ av-mini-padding=” av-mini-padding_sync=’true’ color_options=” color=’theme-color’ custom_bg=’#444444′ custom_font=’#ffffff’ btn_color_bg=’theme-color’ btn_custom_grad_direction=’vertical’ btn_custom_grad_1=’#000000′ btn_custom_grad_2=’#ffffff’ btn_custom_grad_3=” btn_custom_grad_opacity=’0.7′ btn_custom_bg=’#444444′ btn_color_bg_hover=’theme-color-highlight’ btn_custom_bg_hover=’#444444′ btn_color_font=’theme-color’ btn_custom_font=’#ffffff’ btn_color_font_hover=’white’ btn_custom_font_hover=’#ffffff’ border=” border_width=” border_width_sync=’true’ border_color=” border_radius=” border_radius_sync=’true’ box_shadow=” box_shadow_style=’0px,0px,0px,0px’ box_shadow_color=” animation=” animation_duration=” animation_custom_bg_color=” animation_z_index_curtain=’100′ hover_opacity=” sonar_effect_effect=” sonar_effect_color=” sonar_effect_duration=’1′ sonar_effect_scale=” sonar_effect_opac=’0.5′ css_position=” css_position_location=’,,,’ css_position_z_index=” av-desktop-css_position=” av-desktop-css_position_location=’,,,’ av-desktop-css_position_z_index=” av-medium-css_position=” av-medium-css_position_location=’,,,’ av-medium-css_position_z_index=” av-small-css_position=” av-small-css_position_location=’,,,’ av-small-css_position_z_index=” av-mini-css_position=” av-mini-css_position_location=’,,,’ av-mini-css_position_z_index=” id=” custom_class=” template_class=” av_uid=’av-91kn3r3′ sc_version=’1.0′ admin_preview_bg=”]"
