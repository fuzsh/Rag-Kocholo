        "text": "PRESS RELEASE\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nBERRY CAMPBELL TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ARMORY SHOW 2024\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK, August 13, 2024–Berry Campbell is pleased to announce its participation in The Armory Show 2024. Located at booth 119 at the Javits Center, Berry Campbell Gallery will present a modern take on Women Choose Women (1973), the first large-scale museum exhibition devoted solely to women artists and curated by a committee of women artists at the New York Cultural Center, for The Armory Show 2024.\n\nRead More >>\n\n8 New Showrooms Bring Their Products to Life\n\nFrom New York to Paris, these spaces captivate with distinctive designs\n\nby Stephanie Chen\n\nInside, an art collection curated in partnership with Berry Campbell Gallery showcases works by Ethel Schwabacher, Yvonne Thomas, and Dan Christensen, all available for purchase. The pieces are complemented by a striking installation crafted from repurposed Lucifer lighting components. This sculptural work, visible from the street, transforms from a sphere into an array of suspended, illuminated elements as one moves closer. The ground floor also features a selection of artworks—curated by Lucifer Lighting director and former gallerist Suzanne Mathews—from the family’s collection, including pieces by Francisco Toledo and Jim Sullivan.\n\nRead More >>\n\nEthel Schwabacher, Woman: Red Sea, Dead Sea, 1951, oil on canvas, 31x37 in\n\nAction, Gesture, Paint: Women Artists and Global Abstraction, 1940 - 1970\n\nKunsthalle Bielefeld, Germany\n\nDecember 2, 2023 - March 3, 2024\n\nKunsthalle Bielefeld presents an extensive global show that for the first time in Europe focuses on the work of female artists and their role in the development of abstraction after 1945. The movement we now describe as “Abstract Expressionism” officially began in the mid-20th century in the United States. But around the world, artists* explored parallel approaches to abstraction through materiality, expressivity, and gesture, from Informel to Arte Povera, from calligraphic abstraction and Gutai in East Asia to experimental, deeply political practices in Central and South America, North Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nRead More >>\n\nNew York gallery Berry Campbell had a standout booth, a curated presentation of 12 postwar women artists. The gallery has a distinct focus on re-examining underrepresented women artists of the 20th-century. Gallery owner Christine Berry called it “an incredible day,” noting high demand for artists including Alice Baber, Bernice Bing, and Lynne Drexler.\n\nWorks by Drexler sold for $885,000 and $200,000; the artist, who has been drawing intense interest, will likely be the subject of a traveling institutional retrospective at some point in the near future. A work by Baber went for $200,000—Berry Campbell hopes to mount a solo show of the artist next year.\n\nLater on in the day, the gallery let Artnet News know that a painting by Ethel Schwabacher had been sold for $195,000.\n\nRead More >>"
