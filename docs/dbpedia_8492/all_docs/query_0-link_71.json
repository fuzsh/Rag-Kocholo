        "text": "The paintings in Alice Baber: Reverse Infinity at Berry Campbell are alive with color. The delightful paintings were created using thinned-down oils and acrylics to give the work a watercolor effect.\n\nOn one wall, the gallery has included the quote below in which Baber described her process-\n\n“When I first conceive of a painting‭, ‬I must feel it‭, ‬I hear it‭, ‬I taste it‭, ‬and I want to eat it‭. ‬I start from the driving force‭ ‬of color‭ (‬color hunger‭); ‬then comes a second color to provide light‭, ‬luminous light‭. ‬It will be the glow to reinforce the first color‭. ‬I then discover the need of one‭, ‬two‭, ‬three‭, ‬or more colors which will indicate and make movement‭, ‬establish the psychodynamic balance in midair‭, ‬allow freedom to take place‭, ‬add weight at the top and bottom of painting‭, ‬and create mythical whirlpools between larger forms‭.”\n\n‬Alice Baber‭, ‬Color‭, ‬1972‭\n\nThis exhibition closes 5/18/24.\n\nI am a writer and photographer currently living in Los Angeles. All photos taken by me unless otherwise stated.\n\nAlso check out my newsletter– a weekly recap of what I put up here and more.\n\nAny questions or comments? Drop me a line-\n\nlonglistshort@gmail.com"
