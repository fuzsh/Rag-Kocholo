        "text": "Ode to Kinshasa is named for the capital city of the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa, where Loïs Mailou Jones traveled in the early 1970s as a researcher and U.S. cultural ambassador.Jones’s ability to paint in a wide range of styles reflects both her extensive training and the profound impact that travel had upon her oeuvre…During her trips to Africa, Jones visited many museums and sketched objects she saw there. After returning to the U.S., she developed semi-abstract compositions inspired by the historical objects she had studied.\n\nIn Ode to Kinshasa, Jones adapted the triangle and diamond patterns painted onto traditional masks by artists in many West and Central African communities; the eye in the center of Jones’s composition refers to her source of inspiration. The intense colors and clean-edged forms in this painting are balanced by its nuanced surface texture, which incorporates pieces of gold foil and Japanese paper in Jones’s careful collage technique.\n\nA member of the American postwar abstract expressionist movement, Alice Baber achieved international recognition during the 1960s and 1970s. She is best identified with abstract staining, a technique most often identified with Helen Frankenthaler and Morris Louis, but also characteristic of Paul Jenkins, who Baber was briefly married to during the late 1960s.\n\nShe lived in France during part of the 1950s and 1960s and it was there that she painted Journeying Blue. Her work of this period shared with her husband’s an overall composition of colorful abstract forms noted for their glowing transparency. However, Baber worked with more controlled geometric shapes, usually ovoids, and applied the pigment by rubbing it into the canvas with her fingers rather than pouring the liquid in large gestural sweeps as did Jenkins. The energy of her paintings derived mainly from the congested yet orchestrated movement, often elliptical, of the shapes, which she referred to as “wind”; often the ovoids were directed towards a brilliant unstained white area near the center of the composition. Sometimes, as in Journeying Blue, her paintings tended toward the monochromatic.\n\nBaber is not as well known as the other exponents of stain painting because she died at a relatively young age of fifty-four and devoted considerable time to teaching throughout the United States (including at the University of California campuses at Santa Barbara and Berkeley), organizing exhibitions of women artists, and writing about art. Her work is in collections in the United States and abroad, including the Museum of Modern Art and Metropolitan Museum.\n\nCourtesy LACMA Collections\n\nDuring the mid-fifties, Lee Krasner created a number of collaged paintings using drawings and paintings she had previously discarded. Twenty-five years later she used the same technique for a series that was exhibited in 1980 at the Pace Gallery in New York under the title “Solstice”. Vernal Yellow is from that series. For this work the artist integrated cut-out fragments of figurative charcoals from the 1930s, as well as non-representational lithographs into the canvas. A great tension can be felt between the lines and colours, between abstraction and figuration, as well as between surface and space. And throughout the whole one can feel the strongly pulsating rhythms of the artist’s spontaneous brushwork and of the elements she collaged in."
