        "text": "Shipping. As a courtesy to buyers, Moran provides a list of preferred shippers who are in the business of transporting antiques and works of art. Buyers are responsible for arranging their own shipping estimates and deliveries. Moran, in its sole discretion and as a courtesy to buyers, may arrange to have purchased lots packed, insured, and forwarded by a third-party shipper at the request, expense, and risk of the buyer. In circumstances where Moran arranges for such third-party services, Moran may apply an administration charge of 15% of that service fee. Moran assumes no responsibility for acts or omissions in such packing or shipping by other packers or carriers, even if recommended by Moran. Moran also assumes no responsibility for any damage to picture frames or to the glass therein. Buyers are strongly encouraged to collect purchased items from the sale site at the time of the auction. Packing material and labor are provided free of charge at the sale site during the auction. Packing and handling of purchased lots is undertaken by Moran solely as a convenience to customers. If a buyer opts to use this courtesy packing and handling service, Moran is not liable for damage to property, regardless of cause. Following the auction, uncollected lots shall be relocated to and stored in Moran's warehouse. Moran shall retain possession of all purchases until full payment has been received from the buyer. Lots remaining uncollected after the fifth business day following the sale, regardless of payment status, are subject to a per-lot daily storage charge of $10.00. In addition to other remedies available by law, Moran reserves the right to impose upon delinquent buyers a separate 1% monthly charge (of the purchase price, or the maximum permitted by law) commencing on the sixth business day after the sale date. If a buyer fails to retrieve a purchased lot within thirty (30) days after the date of sale (the \"Retrieval Period\"), Moran may, without further notice, (a) continue to store the lot in Moran's warehouse, or at the warehouse of a third-party, subject to the storage charge described above; (b) deliver the lot to the buyer at the buyer's expense; or (c) sell the lot at auction without reserve at a place and time determined by Moran in its sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Moran has no duty to store any lot indefinitely. Any purchased lot that remains in Moran's possession sixty (60) days after the Retrieval Period (collectively, ninety (90) days) will be deemed abandoned (\"Abandoned Property\") and title to it will pass to Moran. Moran may, in its sole discretion, discard or sell any Abandoned Property and may keep any proceeds from any such sale. Moran may not be held liable for any claims related to Abandoned Property. Moran is not responsible for damage or loss that occurs to Abandoned Property and Moran is not responsible for insuring Abandoned Property after the Retrieval Period."
