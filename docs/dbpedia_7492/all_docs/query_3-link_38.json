        "text": "Right now, you’re about as likely to get your hands on an Xbox Series X or a PlayStation 5 as you are to see Half-Life 3 pop up for preorder on Steam—which is why we’re turning our sights on another console: the Xbox Series S.\n\nA new dawn for video games\n\nStarting in November 2020, the ninth generation kicked off with the release of the Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and PlayStation 5. As the most powerful consoles ever built, we’re entering a world of internal solid-state drives, support for real-time ray tracing graphics, 60–120 fps rendering speeds and 4K resolution. Not a bad time to get into gaming, in other words.\n\nXbox Series S specs: a svelte silhouette that packs a punch\n\nThe Xbox Series S console is a compact machine that bears more than a passing resemblance to the Xbox One S—but the specs are much improved.\n\nHow much storage does the S have? You can count on a 512 GB solid-state drive, which guarantees warp-speed loading times—although it’ll fill up quickly if you only play premium games. Don’t worry, though, as the Xbox Series S has an expansion slot.\n\nHow many teraflops does the Xbox Series S have? It comes in at 4 TFLOPS of RDNA 2 graphics. This is bolstered by 10 GB of RAM and an AMD Zen 2 8-core processor running at 3.6 GHz.\n\nCan the Xbox Series S do 4K 120 fps?\n\nNot exactly: 4K resolution isn’t native for this console; it’s capped at 1440p, though it can run up to 120 fps if you drop the resolution.\n\nAs for home entertainment, the Xbox Series S supports HDR, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. We live in a digital world now, so it has no physical disk drive.\n\nWhich is better: the Xbox Series X or the Xbox Series S?\n\nYou’re probably asking yourself: what’s the difference between the Xbox Series S and X? At the end of the day, both are super powerful machines that represent the next generation in gaming. Here’s a handy comparison of the Xbox Series S specs as well as the Series X, One X and PlayStation 5:\n\nXbox Series S\n\nMemory: 10 GB GDDR6\n\nStorage: 512 GB internal SSD\n\nResolution: 1440p\n\nXbox Series X\n\nMemory: 16 GB GDDR6\n\nStorage: 1 TB internal SSD\n\nResolution: 4K\n\nXbox One X\n\nMemory: 12 GB GDDR5\n\nStorage: 1 TB HDD\n\nResolution: 4K\n\nSony PlayStation 5\n\nMemory: 16 GB GDDR6\n\nStorage: 825 GB internal SSD\n\nResolution: 4K\n\nThe Game Pass – do you need it?\n\nAbsolutely. For a monthly fee, the Game Pass gives you access to a huge library of games along with exclusive deals, member discounts and release-day access to Xbox Game Studios titles. We recommend opting for the Ultimate subscription, because it rolls in Xbox Live Gold and allows you to stream games from cloud to PC, too.\n\nIs the Xbox Series S worth it?\n\nThe ninth generation of consoles is here and we’re ready to play. Is the Xbox Series S better than the PS5? No. Is it a good substitute for the X? Definitely. This is a zippy little gem of a console that’ll scratch your gaming itch. Beef up that storage, grab yourself a Game Pass and settle in for some premium next-gen action."
