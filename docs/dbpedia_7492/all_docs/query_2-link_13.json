Refunds will be issued within 5 business days back to the account you paid with Paypal, Credit Cards, Bank Account etc. Refunds cannot be sent to alternate accounts.\n\nWe do not accept returns for any of the following:\n\nNo cancellations, returns or refunds on PRESALE items. Any items sold BEFORE the release dates are considered PRESALE. We will not refund ratios (IE 1:10, 1:15, 1:20, 1:25, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:500 or any other type of ratio) for any reason. We will not refund any other PRESALE books. We place orders based on your orders. If you are ordering presale books we are paying for your books months in advance to secure copies specifically for you and we cannot return them for a refund. If you are ordering signed books, CGC/CBCS graded items that are preorder, please do allow plenty of time for delivery.\n\nNo Cancellations or refunds if you select our combined shipping option and do not qualify for a free shipment. Please review our SHIPPING POLICY for more details. Minimum purchase for free shipping is $100. Combined shipping orders must total over $100 to qualify for a free shipment.

We cannot promise 9.8s on every book, that's not realistic.
