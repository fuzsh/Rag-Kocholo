        "text": "AC Harlekin\n\n02 Aug 2022 08 Aug 2022 08 Aug 2022\n\n2 0 12\n\nThere are 3 possible ways to finish the game,\n\n1. Stellarch Ending\n\nThis ending requires you to have the Royalty DLC. You have to follow the royalty questlines and build up one colonist to a certain rank (Count/Countess). After that you have to beat a final quest for the \"stellarch\".\n\n2. Spaceship\n\nYou can also end the game by building and successfully starting a spaceship in your colony. You would have to make all the research for that, find a KI-persona core (random quest reward) and farm a lot of materials for the ship. Keep in mind that the reactor needs 15 days to start up.\n\nPersonally I didnt even try the first two variants because I think both would take to much time. So here is the third method, that worked perfect on my first try:\n\n3. Journey\n\nSome time after starting a new colony you will get a quest from an unknown AI which sends you the coordinates of an abandoned spaceship somewhere on your planet. You can travel there by creating a caravan. It's already built and you only have to start it up and wait the 15 days till it's ready.\n\nBefore you start the game set the difficulty to \"strive to survive\". You may also want to choose the small map size and maybe a higher temperature as well (I had some serious problems with freezing colonist while traveling). You can choose the scenario you want but rich explorer and naked brutality could be too hard. Choose a place in the middle of your world map, so the travelling route won't be too long.\n\nAs soon as the game starts you can change the difficulty back to peaceful, it won't impact the achievement as long as you put it back to \"strive to survive\" before launching the ship (Thanks to user Mystic Natsu for this information, it works for the \"Knowledge is Power,...\" achievement as well). Phoebe as the storyteller does also make it easier, I had no raider attacks while starting the spaceship!\n\nNow for the strategy. Focus on researching things like packaged survival meals, batteries, some weapons and clothing. You have to farm a lot of food and turn it into these survival meals that won't decay while travelling. You can try researching and farming some devilstrand and make clothes from it. Build your base like in a normal game, build some batteries and let them fill up, because you'll take them with you.\n\nWhen the AI finally shows you the place of the abandoned spaceship, you can check how long long the journey will be by creating a caravan starting on your homebase on the world map menu. If you get the possibility, tame or buy some horses since they increase your travel speed and inventory space.\n\nLet's say the journey takes your colonists ~20 days and the ship needs 15 days to start then you have to start travelling in the middle of your second year, the temperatures are better in summer as well. The journey itself shouldn't be difficult, you'll meet some traders on your way, but raiders shouldn't show up on lowest difficulty. Take some full batteries with you, as well as steel and components to build a tiny base near the spaceship. To reduce consumption of food you can send some of your colonists into the spaceships cryptosleep caskets. I also took some turrets with me, but since i never got attacked i didn't need them at all.\n\nDon't forget to change the difficulty back to \"strive to survive\" before you launch the ship.\n\nLt Davo\n\n06 Nov 2022 06 Nov 2022 07 Nov 2022\n\n1 1 0\n\nThis achievement is not hard and goes pretty quickly if you do it the right way, which I am going to share with you.\n\nGAME SETUP\n\nDLC: Currently, this game has only one DLC, Royalty. Nothing in it helps with what is essentially a speedrun. Disable it.\n\nScenario: Rich Explorer. Trust me...you want to be as lean as possible if you want to get to the spaceship quickly.\n\nStoryteller: Phoebe.\n\nDifficulty: Strive to Survive.\n\nSave mode: Reload anytime. This isn't critical, but it will be easier.\n\nWorld generation:\n\n- Globe coverage: Small. This makes it a shorter trip to the spaceship, and one that is less likely to be encumbered by impassable mountains, islands, or other gamestoppers.\n\n- Rainfall: don't know that it makes any difference. I went with Normal.\n\n- Temperature: Bit warmer. This should prevent the spaceship being placed on an ice sheet.\n\n- Population: This is probably not a big factor, but it could help a little to put it on High or Bit more.\n\nLocation selection: First, inspect the world for impassable mountain ranges. The spaceship will be placed around the edge, so check the edges for ice sheets or weird geometry. If you don't like the world, back out and enter a different seed. Second, use Advanced Options and set the starting season on Spring. Third, select a location well into the interior but away from the center. If you locate at or near the center of a small world, Charlon Whitestone may never contact you about the spaceship. Pick a temperate forest or other favorable biome that's on flatland and near a road. If you can put it near a friendly settlement (yellow tepee or purple house), that's even better, but don't worry if you can't.\n\nCHARACTER CREATION\n\nSince you only get one starting character, it's important to get a good one. The first thing you want to look for is the following skills: Shooting, Construction, Animals, and Cooking. If you can get passions and skill points in all four of those, fantastic. If you can get a decent number of points in all four, with passions in three of them, that's also pretty good. Next, look at anything that's disabled. It's fine if Artistic is disabled. My character had Firefighting disabled, which was a bit of a concern, but it worked out (Thanks, Phoebe!). You'll need all of the other skills, so don't choose someone who has any disabled. You'll also need to consider their traits and health status. Remember, this person must be able to survive on his or her own for a good while. This is one instance where negative social traits like Abrasive are unimportant.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nFirst part - waiting for Charlon Whitestone\n\nThe plan is to keep your \"colony\" down to one person throughout the first part, which is when you're waiting on Charlon Whitestone to offer the spaceship to you. You start off with 40 survival meals. Forbid them right away; they're for the caravan to the spaceship. Construct only the basic workstations: butcher block, stove, research desk. Rich Explorer can build a wood-burning generator right off the bat, so do that for lighting and your stove. Research pemmican and make it as soon as you learn how. After you've researched pemmican, you can deconstruct your research desk. Collect food and prepare only enough simple meals for your daily needs, so refrigeration isn't a concern.\n\nDO try to obtain a combat/hauling animal and a pack animal during this time. I started off with a labrador as a pet, which worked out great. He helped with the hauling, and the predators/lone raiders tended to go after him, leaving Rich Explorer free to fire his charge rifle from range and avoid injury. After I tamed a stallion, I was set. If you begin with a donkey as a pet, then be on the lookout for a combat/hauling animal you can tame, hopefully with some inspiration.\n\nDO NOT accept any more colonists! At all! For any reason! Those 40 packaged survival meals you crashed with are going to get you to the spaceship, but they're not for sharing!\n\nIf traders come by, consider selling some of your goods to keep your weight down. Do you really need to schlep 48 components with you across the world? No, you don't.\n\nIt's a little unpredictable when Charlon Whitestone will contact you. He (it) may contact you as early as 8 days into your game. Sometimes he waits a full season. Sometimes longer. If you don't hear from him within two seasons, it might be better for you if you start over, unless you really love how your game is going so far. For reference, I started on Spring 2 and heard from him on Summer 8.\n\nSecond part - getting to the spaceship\n\nWhen you hear from Charlon Whitestone, immediately check your travel time to the spaceship. 40 packaged survival meals will last you for 22 days, but that cuts it close, with no margin for raids, and nothing to eat when you get there. (This doesn't take foraging into account). On a small world, your trip will probably be around 12 to 18 days, so your 40 meals will make it.\n\nDon't forget about food for your animals. They can eat your survival meals or simple meals, but it's way more efficient to feed them pemmican, hay, kibble, or raw vegetables, such as rice or berries.\n\nI recommend making a save before you begin building your caravan. A lot of things can go wrong when planning a base relocation. Don't plan on taking furniture. Most of it, such as beds, is ridiculously heavy, and isn't hard to rebuild when you get there. In most cases, it's better to deconstruct and take the raw materials.\n\nIf you're traveling in cold weather or will be going through a cold biome, make sure your colonist is dressed for it.\n\nIf your route to the spaceship takes you near a yellow tepee or purple house, consider adjusting it so that you pass through those settlements to do some trading.\n\nThird part - starting up the spaceship\n\nOnce you get to the spaceship location, save your game.\n\nI'm going to give you two options here: the straighforward one, and the play-it-safe one. The straightforward one is to proceed with your one Rich Explorer all the way to the end. The play-it-safe option is to get a second colonist before you end the game. The reason is simply because some people have reported that the achievement didn't unlock unless they left one colonist on the rimworld while the other(s) went up in the spaceship. That was not the case for me; I added a second colonist, and it unlocked just fine when I launched both of them. But now you know, if you proceed, you may have to reload from the same you just made and play again after recruiting a second colonist.\n\nIt is important now to lower the difficulty. Once you start the ship's reactor, you're liable to receive raids, and on Strive to Survive, your one (or two) colonists have no chance. You can, and should, lower the difficulty all the way to Peaceful. Then start the reactor. (Note: you may lower the difficulty at any time in your playthrough after you've started, but it probably won't be a big factor before this point.)\n\nNow spend the next 15 days repairing the ship (to do that, simply add it to your home zone) and building a base to meet your basic needs. (You don't need to research anything.) Once the ship is ready, reset the difficulty to Strive to Survive, enter the cryosleep chamber, and launch. Viola!\n\nIf you do this, and the achievement doesn't unlock, then reload your save and start Part 3 again. This time, wait for an opportunity to recruit a colonist. Once you have them, switch difficulties, start the launch sequence, wait, load one colonist, switch difficulties again, and launch.\n\nThis was my schedule:\n\nStart game: Spring 2\n\nCharlon Whitestone event: Summer 8\n\nArrived at spaceship: Fall 6\n\nReactor started: Fall 14 (I waited for a second colonist)\n\nLaunched ship (with both colonists), achievement unlocked: Winter 14\n\nThat's 58 days."
