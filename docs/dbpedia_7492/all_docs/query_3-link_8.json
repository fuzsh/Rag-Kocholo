        "text": "‚ÄúWhy limp along on impulse power when you can jump to Warpspeed?‚Äù\n\nThe Warp Speed cartridge was Cinemaware‚Äôs answer to the Epyx Fastload. I can vividly recall reading the advertisements for this cart but I never knew anyone who had one. I finally picked one up and figured it might make an interesting video to explore it.\n\nOf particular interest are the fast I/O benchmarks. Here are the charts from my video. The benchmarking was done with the CBM Disk Transfer Benchmark tool. I‚Äôll update the benchmarks on that page after I finish posting this.\n\nThe load speed is a decent showing, but, note the save speed. I think this is the fastest speeder cartridge for saving files that I know of. In order to get faster than this (for save speed), you need to use DolphinDOS.\n\nYou can see where the Warp Speed cart fits in with other speed loaders here.\n\nHere‚Äôs the video:\n\nPlease excuse the slight hiss in the audio during the demonstration. I‚Äôm using a super-cheap USB adapter for a pretty good mic. I‚Äôll not make that mistake again.\n\nSome more details follow:\n\nThe Warp Speed was designed by Alien Technology group, also responsible for the V-MAX! copy protection system, which you have probably seen if you loaded original copies of games from companies like Cinemaware, Activision, Origin, etc.\n\nIt‚Äôs got a good feature list:\n\nDOS Wedge\n\nFast I/O (speed save and load) [we‚Äôll get timings and compare them to other carts]\n\nUtility menu\n\nML Monitor\n\nML Monitor that assembles, executes, and disassembles in the 1541 drive.\n\nHas modes for C64 and C128 (hardware switch selection)\n\nThe advertisement above uses ‚ÄúWarpspeed‚Äù while the manual and pretty much everything else says ‚ÄúWarp Speed.‚Äù It claims ‚Äúup to 10x faster.‚Äù My testing shows it is 8x faster on save and load. I am not sure how they count ‚Äú55 features‚Äù but I am sure if you included the monitor commands you could get there. üôÇ\n\nExternal links of interest:"
