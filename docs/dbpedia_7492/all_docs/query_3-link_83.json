        "text": "Despite what the trophy says, you only need to launch the ship on \"Strive to Survive\". You can play on peaceful for the whole run.\n\nHere's my strategy to get this done easily and quickly (30-40 minutes):\n\nTribal Colony - make sure each member has the role of Gatherer, this allows them to travel the map and not starve. This is the most important factor\n\nImmediately upon starting the game, make sure difficulty is on peaceful and go to the world map and send 4 caravans off to different edges of the world. One will have to be left behind.\n\nOnce all members are on the world map, highlight your colony and abandon it. This allows time to move faster.\n\nFrom here it is a luck game - eventually a ship will spawn somewhere on the world map. If your colonists reach their destination, just keep sending them walking up and down a small area so they keep getting berries.\n\nOnce a ship spawns from the quest Ship to the Stars, send the nearest colony member there asap. All others can be ignored from now on, they can die. (?)\n\nOnce arrived, start the ship up. Send your colonist to rest in the cryptosleep chamber.\n\nWait 15 uneventful ingame days. On peaceful there are no raids.\n\nOnce the ship is ready, pause the game, change difficulty to Strive to Survive. Resume and launch the ship. Trophy unlocked!\n\nDid you start the game on peaceful before starting or did you do it once you got into the map for the first time? Going step by step the only difference i have done is pick peaceful before landing on the planet so that might be why i cant get it to work. 2.5 years is like 150 days i think so i know i havent run out of time. Ill try one more time starting on strive to survive first then switching to see\n\nSo I've just got this to pop. Not as fast as the the way Nuzzgok mentioned. But it wasn't working for me so this is what I did.\n\nStart a new game with a small map.\n\nPicked crash landed, and selected a fairly balanced starting bunch of Members.\n\nPicked Pheobe Chillax and Strive to survive.\n\nPlayed normally for the first year. Prioritising getting survival meals unlocked and churning them out for the journey. Leaving the difficulty on Strive to survive (its not particularly difficult due to picking Pheobe and it being the first year)\n\nCreated a caravan (on 4th of Aprilmay 5501) and set off for the ship (13 day travel)\n\nOnce at the ship site SAVE THE GAME\n\nStarted the reactor still on Strive to survive. As soon as it started, paused the game and changed to peaceful.\n\nPut all my members in the cryo pods and waited the 15 days.\n\nOnce the 15 days were up, changed difficulty back to Strive to survive, then launched the ship.\n\nTrophie popped as I hit the credits screen.\n\nHope this helps someone. But still try the Nuzzgoks method first. This took me the better part of 6 hours to do.\n\nOn 9/10/2022 at 2:34 PM, Nuzzgok said:\n\nThanks for your guide. Do you think having strive to survive on when starting up the ship could be the differing factor? There is something up with this trophy I think, as we've both had peaceful on at different moments and had it pop, so there is a workaround here somewhere\n\nI wonder whether it has something to do with the game recognising the change in difficulties. When I followed your way, the game popped the trophie for launching the ship, but not for the difficulty (was still within 2.5 years)\n\nIt must be a variable within the save state that doesn't update quickly enough. Saving it at certain places may make a difference to force the game to acknowledge what difficulty you are on."
