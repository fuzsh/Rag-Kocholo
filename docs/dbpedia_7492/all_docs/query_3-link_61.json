        "text": "In Starbase, there is a maximum speed limit of 150 m/s. And since EA is getting closer and closer, more and more stations will appear and new things will be added that will be far far away. So a Warp/ Hyperdrive might be useful. The speed of warp is determined by the speed that goes above the speed limit. For example, 100 m/s above the speed limit is Warp 1 and 200 m/s is Warp 2 and so on. The maximum warp speed is warp 10. You go to warp by charging the thrusters for 2 minutes which will cause intense heat. And when you drop out of warp, there will be a 5-10 minute cooldown before you can warp due to the extreme heat.\n\nWhat Kind of Ships can have Hyperdrives / Warp Drives?\n\nFighters and small ships are too tiny to fit fast hyperdrives in Starbase, the most a fighter or small ship can have is most is about Warp 1 or maybe 2.\n\nWhat new devices would be used for Warp Drives / Hyperdrives\n\nMedium and Large Fuel Rods - Larger versions of fuel rods.\n\nMedium and Large Fuel Chambers - Larger versions of fuel chambers.\n\nMedium and Large Generators - Larger versions of generators.\n\nXilatrium - A new liquid element called that is a combination of Xhalium and Ilmatrium. Xhalium is used for it’s high energy and Ilmatrium for its energy storage and heat transfer. It is a very conductive liquid but is very efficient. If both Ilmatrium and Xhalium are in a Warp Chamber, they both melt and mix together creating the element.\n\nSmall, Medium, and Large Warp Chambers - Used for storing Xilatrium and lets Xilatrium flow through the Regulators. Powered by the medium and large fuel chambers and generators. Melts Xilatrium and Ilmatrium\n\nRegulators - This device is used to recycle the fuel and keep the fuel chamber from overloading and destabilizing and if it does, it will explode. They are powered by medium and large fuel rods, fuel chambers, and generators. This also is what converts Xilatrium into energy. It also radiates a type of radiation that degrades metals that are used for endoskeletons. You can either put the regulators on the outside of the ship or use radiators to radiate it so you have the Regulators exposed. Powered by the medium and large fuel chambers and generators.\n\nLarge Radiators and Radiator Extensions - Larger radiators that can radiate more and can be used to cool regulators and is optional. You only need these when the regulators are inside the ship.\n\nWarp Thrusters - Thrusters that allow ships to go to warp and are powered by Regulators.\n\nWarp Coolant - Each time you go to warp, a quarter of the warp coolant cell is taken away. And depending on how long you are in warp, more can be taken away. These are placed on Warp Thrusters. You can still go to warp without them but will cause damage to the ship and in some cases can explode the Hyperdrive.\n\nIsn’t this OP?\n\nNo, not at all. It is balanced. First of all you still need to pilot the ship and if you were to warp into an asteroid belt or a debris field, you would take large amounts of damage. And as I previously stated “You go to warp by charging the thrusters for 2 minutess which will cause intense heat. And when you drop out of warp, there will be a 5-10 minute cooldown before you can warp due to the extreme heat.” So you can’t just warp out of conflicts all the time. They are also unstable and if you don’t change your warp coolant or put enough Xilatrium in the Warp Chamber, things can become very unstable and can become catastrophic.\n\nWhat About Warp Gates?\n\nWarp gates are kinda boring ngl.\n\nEdit: I added \"Small, Medium, and Large\" to the Warp chambers section\n\nI will stand by, warp gate allow for infrastructure to be build and maintained / defended, I am completely against ships being able to just \"warp\" everywhere.\n\nIt does remove gameplay, if you want to mine somewhere in the belt, you better build a highway!\n\nSmall warpgates are the way!\n\nI rather have more stuff to do on your ship then fast travel being extremely easy.\n\nE.G.\n\n- I detect an player within 25km of me (rad detection), I jump drive a huge distance away.\n\n- What about the entire gameplay loop of building / maintaining Refuel stations / small warpgates. You might not like it, but others do.\n\n- Everything on a ship is going to make it a solo gameplay versus a community based gameplay.\n\nThe game as is, is already extremely \"safe\" there is almost no risk involved, with this implementation you only adding more safety and removing any risk involved.\n\nI can now jump to xhalium hotspots and be back before any pirate would have had time to even find me.\n\nIf other games are any indication of how it impacts PvP, any form of Warp, has broken PvP in many ways.\n\n====\n\nBelt is aprox. 17.5 km away from Origin, ship going max speed will reach this in: 117seconds.\n\nClass 9 & 10 roids are ~110km away from Origin, ship going max speed will reach this in: 16 minutes.\n\nXhalium is aprox. 500-750km out from Origin, ship going max speed will reach this in: 56 minutes (500km) / 83 minutes (750km)\n\nNow once you build a station over there travel time is reduced insanely. (Yes, station don't have the features implemented yet to stay there and don't even need to go back to origin)\n\nOnce the features are implemented warp gate is completely unneccesary.\n\n====\n\nI build my ships for speed and time of flight, to be able to do so. Yes I only can carry the contents of a C10 core, but I am able to do so with ease.\n\nDesign your ships for such a purpose and don't expect all ships to be able to do everything. In general All-purpose ships have been less effecient then ships designed with a single purpose in mind.\n\nI also don't use Mining Lasers, because they eat energy (fuel rods) I rather handmine over there without ever having to worry about running out.\n\nQuevin, shouldn't getting Xhalium and other rare ores be hard to do? Plus, if warp gates are to be added to multiple places, pirates can guard them which will cause players to not go to them making them pointless. You're not gonna be the only pirate when EA comes out and not everyone is going to have your style of piracy.\n\nIt does remove gameplay, if you want to mine somewhere in the belt, you better build a highway!\n\nWell I am not saying that all ships are required to have one. You probably would think warp drives are made for bigger ships which they are meant for.\n\nI am completely against ships being able to just \"warp\" everywhere.\n\nSo am I but warp gates are somewhat like that. If more are added people can just warp wherever. And I did say that warp is when you go above the speed limit and it's measured by every 100 m/s above the speed limit so nobody is not jumping for place to place in an instant.\n\nif warp gates are to be added to multiple places, pirates can guard them which will cause players to not go to them making them pointless.\n\nYes maintaining and defending those warp gates is gameplay, thanks for pointing out mechanic in the game worth fighting over.\n\nWell I am not saying that all ships are required to have one. You probably would think warp drives are made for bigger ships which they are meant for.\n\nThere is no design for ship size, everything is modular and dynamic, meaning the smaller the ship with a single purpose the better the use, It will be used by smaller ships no matter what you do. Unless they force small / large ship differential its never going to happen.\n\nSo am I but warp gates are somewhat like that. If more are added people can just warp wherever.\n\nYes and they have to be maintained / defended, otherwise they are risky. having such a system available on each ship only removes more gameplay than it adds.\n\n===\n\nAlso I never stated I would be the only pirate, I am stating that current gameplay is extremely safe, doesn't mean we should add even more safe gameplay mechanics. If you leave the SZ, its FFA meaning you should expect to lose everything, not suggest ways to make it even more safe. Ask/pay for protection, design your ship to be fully stealth against rad detection, don't use Warp gates instead travel to long distance.\n\nI stand against warp drives.\n\n- Something being expected to be useful doesn't make it necessary.\n\n- Something that is unnecessary does not justify the development of an entire machinery architecture, that is essentially existing structures of power and thrusters combined, just to circumvent the speed limit alone.\n\n- The 150m/s speed limit is not only a matter of balance but also a technical limitation for ships to appropriately interact with the environment.\n\n- Other games that use warp drives have them to move between already existing locations, and in many cases, that mechanic trivializes travel as such.\n\n- Warp drives directly interfere with the concept of warp gates, which are already in development and provide for the same purpose with associated requirements, that vastly outweigh such suggested here. There's no feasible way to balance warp drives and warp gates without making either one redundant.\n\n- In Starbase, conventional travel is meaningful. It takes time and resources, and everything works under the same limitations - this is what makes it meaningful, balanced, intuitive, and risky. Add the warp drive, and that balance will be destroyed. Asking for some Xhalium for it to run by will not change anything - it will just widen the rift of elitism between players using their warp-equipped mining haulers versus regular folk who will be unable to afford one and fall prey to pirates in their stead.\n\nDo you think massive miners are going to be the go to mechanism for mining? I really can't see that. Large miners (given current limits) are already unwieldy beasts. They also stand literally no chance against pirates currently due to the current borkness of turrets. The turrets we currently have can cause rapid unplanned disassembly at the site of the turret base because of problems with syncing and latency. There's a whole thread on this topic.\n\nSo while in a perfect world your guys idea of \"arm the miners\" is all nice and that, its not a tenable arrangement until the weaponry with multicrew ships is figured out.\n\nPlus, you have people like Quevin who literally build high speed endurance miner killers. What realistic counter is there to that, and in what way does it benefit to the miner player at all to have to blockade run every time they want to travel a good distance? It doesn't. Gate camping is not fun for the victim. I argue its not fun for the camper either, but hey, some people like to sit and wait. Its a yearly celebration where I live to spend days in the cold sitting and waiting.\n\nNow to be fair, we don't have a myriad set of features yet to even try out other ideas. There are no sensors. Just the Mk 1 computer screen. The amount of data needed to have a scanner work over large distances may not be all that large, and our 3D locations can be monitored and stored by the central server at all time. So getting a ping of someone being somewhere in range of a scanner (not a definite position) is a low tech possibility. However, the stealth and hunt dance is a hell of a lot more fun than \"poof, I appear at the moon, and all the pirates are there to welcome and subsequently extort me! Whoooo!\""
