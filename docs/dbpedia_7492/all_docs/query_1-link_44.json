        "text": "All of our games are cleaned up before shipment. All disc based games are ran through our disc machine and are in great shape. Any pre-owned games are not likely to have working digital codes. Cases will have a inventory tag. New games are still in plastic wrap. Below will give more details on selections:\n\n-Pre-owned game only, will come in a generic case and may have printed out cover art or none at all.\n\n-Pre-owned game, includes a case and the original cover art but it may or may not have a manual.\n\n-In terms of the cartridge based games if marked in good condition the label will be in tact etc. If cosmetically flawed the label might be damaged or some of the shell.\n\n-Pre-Ordered games will ship when we get the game in stock normally 1-2 days before release date. You will not receive the game before release date. Release date subject to change."
