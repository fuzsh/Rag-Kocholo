        "text": "A bit harsh. Maybe?\n\nI do get what you mean but I wasn’t quite looking for that level of over-simplification.\n\nIt may be that the rule of thumb to be deployed here (because the vast majority of single jumps do actually take the same time) is 45 seconds on average per jump. Thus a 17 jump route might be assumed to take around 12.75 minutes.\n\nWhat I was really looking for is what the warp figure is said for an any given ship.\n\nI’m assuming that CCP must have some kind of data on this, and it’d probably be common between groups of ships - all battleships of a specific type for example - and it might be cool to know what this figure was, whether this is 45 seconds or something else.\n\nThanks for posting a link for the EVE warp time calculator @Lis_Torin. This is really cool and almost exactly what I was looking for.\n\nI just tried it though (on a single jump for simplicity’s sake) and I’m not sure that it’s that accurate.\n\nI entered the following information for my ship:\n\nWarp Speed: 3.30au/s\n\nShip Max Velocity : 263.75m/s\n\nDistance: 12.65au\n\nThe time that the calculator offered up for this jump was 30.709431 seconds.\n\nFor the purposes of the test, this is what I did:\n\nI exited a station, and then immediately stopped my forward motion. The readout indicated that I was an orbit distance of 0m from the station.\n\nI then activated a stopwatch on my iPhone at the same time as selecting/releasing on ‘Warp to Within 0m’. and stopped this at the point where ‘Warp Drive Active’ disappeared indicating that the warp drive had stopped operation.\n\nThe time that it took was 42.51 seconds. I probably need to allow for +/- 0.1 second (the typical reaction time of most people) to allow for the time that it took for me to press the stopwatch stop button.\n\nIt’s also noteworthy that I observed (on the second run of the test) that forward motion continued for another 63.92 seconds (if I left the ship to stop of its own accord) or 43.25 (if I pressed the ‘stop the ship’ minus sign on the HUD, three times for urgency)\n\nBased on all this the total time for the jump (timed from start to the point where forward motion was 0.0m/s) was between 106.43 seconds to 85.76 seconds.\n\nIt’s possibly true that the math is complicated @Rekindle, although as the calculator that @Lis_Torin linked to shows, it should definitely be possible, assuming that there are some parameters (as I’m sure there are) that CCP has plugged into the game as standards (forward movement after warp drive shutdown being one of these for example).\n\nI’m not sure that that’s entirely true. After jumping into a system I timed the alignment time before warp drive activation started (from a point of no forward motion after coming through the warp gate) and it was 10.63 seconds"
