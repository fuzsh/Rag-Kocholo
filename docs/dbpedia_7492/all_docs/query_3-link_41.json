        "text": "Tomorrow the Stars—\n\nToday, World War III!\n\nDr. Neil Anson Clemons was born at the very moment that men first landed on the moon and always strived to become an astronaut and reach the stars. Becoming an astronaut and traveling to the stars are not easy tasks. Neil devoted his life to staying physically fit as any astronaut should be through martial arts and mentally fit by studying and becoming one of the world's foremost experts in quantum physics and gravitational theory. Now he and his team have achieved a breakthrough, both in building a warp drive, and finding a new energy source powerful enough to make the drive more than an interesting theoretical concept.\n\nWith the help of attractive and outspoken southern astronaut, US Air Force Colonel Tabitha Ames, the US Government is convinced to fund the Top Secret warp project, including assembly in orbit of the first faster-than-light probe. Unfortunately, forces working behind the scenes have much darker dreams, and have infiltrated the Top Secret program. They do not hesitate to blow up a space shuttle, attempt to kill Neil and Tabitha, and use the stolen warp technology to start what they expect to be a short, devastating, and victorious war with the United States.\n\nBut Dr. Clemons has ideas for using his warp drive technology completely unsuspected by America's enemies, and repelling the all-out attack is only the beginning of a titanic struggle to reach the stars.\n\nWarp Speed is lightning-paced science fiction adventure built upon authentic science in the grand tradition of Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and E. E. \"Doc\" Smith.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nTravis S. Taylor—\"Doc\" Taylor to his friends—has earned his soubriquet the hard way: He has a Doctorate in Optical Science and Engineering, a Master's degree in Physics, a Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering, all from the University of Alabama in Huntsville; a Master's degree in Astronomy from the University of Western Sydney, and a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Auburn University. Dr. Taylor has worked on various programs for the Department of Defense and NASA for the past sixteen years. He's currently working on several advanced propulsion concepts, very large space telescopes, space-based beamed energy systems, and next generation space launch concepts. In his copious spare time, Doc Travis is also a black belt martial artist, a private pilot, a SCUBA diver, races mountain bikes, competed in triathlons, and has been the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of several hard rock bands. He currently lives with his wife Karen, daughter Kalista Jade, two dogs Stevie and Wesker, and his cat Kuro, in north Alabama.\n\nTomorrow the Stars—\n\nToday, World War III!\n\nDr. Neil Anson Clemons was born at the very moment that men first landed on the moon and always strived to become an astronaut and reach the stars.
