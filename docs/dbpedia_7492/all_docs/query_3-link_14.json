        "text": "I ask this question because I see all this chat online of Xbox moving towards an all-digital gaming future at warp speed, Closing down their internal team, which deals with physical game releases, and ultimately doing away with Physical media, which makes me sad. I get that Game Pass is Xbox now, but I wouldn't say I like the idea of an all-digital future with no physical games. Imagine a future where you can't walk into a store and see many video games on display. It's grim, and I fear there may be no coming back once they are gone!\n\nAlthough the resurgence of Vinyl and CDs in the music realm gives me hope that people are just getting fed up with everything being digital and owning nothing! We see more and more stories in the media of digital content purchased by users being removed due to licensing issues and so forth at the end user's expense, which is very unfair. This often happens when old video games are de-listed and lost to time unless you are lucky enough to own a physical copy of the game!"
