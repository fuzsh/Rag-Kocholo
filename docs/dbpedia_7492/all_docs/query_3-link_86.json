        "text": "TREKCORE > GAMING > STAGE 9 > Manual\n\nUpon Loading:\n\nThe title screen provides options for watching the intro Sequence, changing settings, and launching the simulation. We recommend adjusting the settings (particularly on the Video tab) to an appropriate level based on your hardware before launching the first time. Note that you can always change your settings later if you pick incorrectly.\n\nWhen youâre ready to get started, hit Launch!\n\nLike most visitors to the Enterprise, you will start out in the Transporter Room (where you will find a familiar face!). Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the controls:\n\nThe Esc or Tab keys will bring up the Settings â note there are tabs on the left hand side, and there is a scroll bar on the right hand side for further options.\n\nPressing V will toggle between first person and third person mode.\n\nPressing Z will toggle between head-bob and static camera mode.\n\nW-A-S-D controls the standard walking movement.\n\nPressing Spacebar will cause the character to Jump.\n\nShift toggles between walking, jogging, and running.\n\nInteracting with the ship:\n\nThe little red dot (reticle) in the center of your screen is used for aiming.\n\nPressing Enter or the F key will allow you to pick up items. Press again to drop the item. Enter is also used to access interaction menus for many LCARS panels.\n\nThe left mouse button can be used to select items. Use this to interact with some panels, such as the turbolift or holodeck menus, replicators and the warp controls on the bridge helm console. It is also used to use items you have picked up, such as a phaser or hypospray. (Tip: Use the reticle to aim, but watch out for crew members!)\n\nThe right mouse button is a Zoom function.\n\nUsing the Holodeck:\n\nPressing H will toggle the arch (and the exit) within a holodeck program. Exit the holodeck before changing programs.\n\nUsing Shuttlecraft:\n\nBefore boarding a shuttle, you will want to open the shuttle bay door by hitting Enter on one of the freestanding consoles and then clicking on Open Shuttlebay Door.\n\nTo board a shuttle, look for the tiny control panel near the door and click on it to open the hatch. Hit enter on the pilotâs console to sit down and begin flying. The hatch will close automatically.\n\nPiloting uses the same controls as movement (W-A-S-D). You can also use Q and E to control your roll. For added fun, try pressing V while piloting to trigger 3rd person mode!\n\nTo exit a shuttlepod, simply press Enter (Warning: Donât try this in open space!). To exit the larger shuttles, stand up from the pilotâs chair with Enter, then open the hatch by clicking on the panel near the door. The runabout can be exited by simply approaching the doors.\n\nTractor Beams in the shuttle bays need to be controlled by the panel next to it. Press Enter on the console to activate options, then click on Activate Tractor beam. Once you have aimed with the mouse, click the left mouse button to turn on the beam. Use your mouse to control the item. Press W to push the item away from you, and S to pull it back towards you. Turn off the Tractor beam by left clicking. Press Enter to exit the Tractor beam control."
