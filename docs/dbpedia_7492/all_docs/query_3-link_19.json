I did everything on first or second try ;p\n\nACEs 8s 24\n\n23 Jun 2011 22 Jun 2011 22 Jun 2011\n\n13 4 3\n\nFor the Mount Vogel transporter i tried and tried to use the walkthroughs above but i only ever made it over that dang bridge once and fell through it 20 other times and the time i made it over i messed up elsewhere so i missed it by 3 secs.\n\nIm posting this video i found on YT which shows another way to do the run without using the bridge and it help me get it on the first try. all other short cuts are the same for the most part. this video skips one of the shortcuts used in the above solution so i kinda used them both together but this one shows the route if you are tired of falling through the bridge in the Free Fire Zone\n\nthe big difference is around the 3:25 point of the vid he takes the other route\n\nThis is not my video i just found it. All credit goes to DICKdeNORMATITY on youtube so stop by and show him some love if it works the way it worked for me\n\nThe second video is for the badlands 3:35 pro time in the dune buggy, for all of us who blew the crap out of the bridge that is used in the above solution\n\n<* I aim to misbehave *>"
