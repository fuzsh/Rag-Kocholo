Loading level ... please wait. arghhhh\n\nAs for disk swapping, that was the joy of having an Amiga and multiple disk games even with 2disk drives. Rise of The Robots AGA was tedious.

Just plug 'n' play. No waiting to play the game and playing it to death just so you didn't have to wait forever for the next game to load\n\nI used C120's to 'backup' my C64 tapes with a nifty device I bought from a magazine.
