        "text": "Old school arcade games and the ability to travel at warp speed? What more do you need to make a successful Candy Box type webtoy? Tom Medley has incorporated all this and more in Speed Warp. It's hard to say much, because discovery is half the enjoyment of the game, but the blank screen you begin with won't stay blank for long. A timer counts up, and as it does, more things will become available... including an arcade console. What happens next is up to you to uncover, but we will tell you that crafting and puzzling out secret potions is part of the deal.\n\nThough you have to work (or rather play) for many of your crafting components, Speed Warp is still easily enjoyed in bite size pieces. Your timer and coins continually count up, so it's a good idea to leave it open in the background as you go about your daily browsing, checking in when you have a few open minutes. Make sure you save and bookmark the game for later, as it would be tragic were you to unintentionally close your browser and lose all your progress. While it doesn't have quite the same whimsical charm as Candy Box, Speed Warp nonetheless offers up an enjoyable enigma of an experience that's worth spending some time with.\n\nPlay Speed Warp\n\nThanks to Mikk and Fredley for sending this one in!"
