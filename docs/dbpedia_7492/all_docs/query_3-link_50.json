        "text": "An interesting thing happened on Saturday. Someone in U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration used the words “my fault” and “I failed” when referring to an aspect of the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic response. No, it wasn’t Trump. It wasn’t Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. And it wasn’t the interior decorators responsible for the blood red Christmas trees in the White House during the 2018 Holiday season.\n\nIt was General Gustave Perna, the military leader and Chief Operating Office of Operation Warp Speed (OWS). And he alone.\n\nThis was in response to complaints from Governors of over 14 different states that their states had only received only a fraction of the promised number of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines. For example, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said on Friday, “We have Michigan hospitals and nursing homes ready to administer this vaccine and the bottleneck appears to be the White House,” according to Charles Crumm reporting for the Oakland Press. Covid-19 vaccines aren’t like avocado toast, as I mentioned yesterday for Forbes. You aren’t always naturally ready for them. Rather, you have to prepare for their arrival and in the meantime put other things on hold, meaning that delays in delivering vaccines can cause major disruptions.\n\nWhitmire continued by saying about the delays, “And I can’t get an answer why. I’ve put a call into Secretary Azar’s office and here’s what I would ask if I could get them on the phone. Where are our doses? What is holding them up? When can we expect them?” She added, “I’m angry because this virus is raging on in this country, and there is either corruption or ineptitude that is keeping us from saving lives and protecting people.”\n\nPerna addressed such questions in a press briefing yesterday by saying, “It was a planning error, and I am responsible.” The following tweet includes a video from the briefing:\n\nAs you can see, Perna explained, “Where I failed, I failed, nobody else failed, was to have a clear understanding of that cadence” of the way the vaccine supply chain is supposed to work. The vaccine supply chain is the complex system of vaccines, transport vehicles, storage locations, storage equipment, personnel, and processes that is supposed to be coordinated to deliver vaccines from their origins all the way to where they will be used. By cadence, Perna presumably didn’t mean a dance step like the Futsal Shuffle but instead meant the timing of when to ship different degrees of vaccines to the next level of the supply chain. “It was my fault,” said Perna, “I gave guidance. I am the one that approved the forecast sheets.”\n\nRunning a vaccine supply chain is a complex operation. It requires coordination and clear communication across everyone involved. This includes not only those running OWS but also other members of the Trump administration, the manufacturers, the Governors and other state leaders, local leaders, public health officials, and healthcare professionals. Everyone along the vaccine supply chain needs to know in advance how the whole system will work and whom specifically to contact and how (whether it’s via phone, text, instant messaging, charades, semaphores, or TikTok video dances) as soon as a problem emerges. Not getting a quick response would be like your coach ghosting you while you are playing in a championship football game.\n\nPerna’s willingness to take the blame did draw praise on social media. After all, accepting responsibility, as opposed to using a roulette wheel to figure out whom to blame each time something goes wrong, is a sign of leadership. For example:\n\nContrast this with many political leaders who instead accept blame about as readily as they would accept a live octopus stuffed down their pants. Some on social media did wonder, though, whether Perna was actually serving as the fall guy for the snafus and whether the problems to date represent deeper issues.\n\nFor example, there was an interesting exchange between Pfizer and Azar. Pfizer had said in a statement that they “have millions more doses sitting in our warehouse but, as of now, we have not received any shipment instructions for additional doses.” This was after Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar had suggested that Pfizer’s manufacturing process was to blame for delays, as Alison Durkee reported for Forbes on Friday. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had also blamed a Pfizer “production issue” for Florida potentially receiving fewer doses than expected, according to Kirby Wilson And Steve Contorno writing for the Miami Herald. Not exactly harmony and understanding, Age of Aquarius stuff.\n\nRunning a vaccine supply chain is all about the four C’s. No, not chocolate, cookies and cream, and cake. Instead, it requires careful planning, complexity awareness, coordination, and communication. Everyone along the supply chain needs to know in advance all of the plans and be apprised of any changes and the exact reason for the changes, as soon as they occur. As Perna did on Saturday, everyone involved in running OWS has to be willing to use words like “my fault” and “I failed” and then quickly help identify solutions. Otherwise, the vaccine delivery portion of Operation Warp Speed could end up being more like Operation Warped Speed."
