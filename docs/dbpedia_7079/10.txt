La Punilla is a multipurpose scheme now going ahead on the Ñuble river, for irrigation and hydropower. This paper discusses the complex management of the incoming and outgoing reservoir flows and summarizes the operating regime, which needs to take account of pre-existing water supply rights and irrigation water releases. The main results of a simulation of the scheme’s operation are presented, with a focus on the performance of the irrigation water release and power generation.
