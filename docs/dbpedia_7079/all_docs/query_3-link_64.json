Choose a book now, pay later room and lock in a great hotel room price in La Punilla now. PLUS WE PRICE MATCH and its easy. If you see a cheaper price after you have booked just let us know via your online confirmation.\n\nCheck Availability on Dallas Hotels with Balcony Rooms\n\nVarious sized balcony rooms can be found when you book a hotel in La Punilla. Each of the La Punilla hotels below mentions they have at least one room with a balcony, and we have tried to highlight this room in the description. If a balcony is a must have feature, please double check that the room description does in fact have a balcony. Sometimes the balcony will be referred to as a terrace, which could be on the roof of apartments or townhouses.\n\nThe smallest balcony is a Juliet balcony where you can open the window but you can't or you can't really step out onto it because it's too small, essentially not designed to stand on. The next sized up balcony rooms are big enough to get outside and for 1 or 2 people to sit down. You could in theory still smoke on the balcony but smoking is often banned in public places in many cities, there may still be an ashtray handy though. After that there are very large balcony rooms where you have a full set of seats for 4 or more and possibly a BBQ (weather dependant of course)."
