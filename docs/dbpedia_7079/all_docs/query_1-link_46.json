H: hypha.\n\nWhen we analyzed genes expressed and involved in the metabolism category (Table 1), 52 up-regulated and 14 down-regulated genes were found in T. frezii growth from teliospores to hyphae. Among up-regulated genes in teliospores, we found the cytochrome-C peroxidase gene (MW691239) transcript increased 14.08 times in teliospores, and GAPDH transcript (MW691253), its level is 8.40-fold higher in the teliospore stage, compared to the hyphal stage. In the same group, we observed an 85.75-fold increase in haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase (MW691229) in T. frezii teliospores, and a 19.74-fold increase was measured in this stage for glutaminase A enzyme (MW691236). The enzyme 2-methylcitrate dehydratase (MW691261) was observed in T. frezii teliospores, the transcription level experienced a 7.12-fold increase, compared to hyphae. The gene glycerol 2-dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) (MW691268), which plays a role in glycerol catabolism, exhibited a substantial 4.87-fold increase in expression levels within T. frezii teliospores compared to hyphae. Similarly, the RNA expression of UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (MW691270) was enhanced by 4.72-fold in teliospores of T. frezii.\n\nWithin genes down-regulated in teliospores, we found that the aldo-keto reductase yakc [NADP+] (MW691282), an enzyme from the reductase superfamily, exhibited a 1.63-fold decrease in T. frezii teliospores in relation to hyphae. Additionally, we observed down-regulation in two other gene expressions: Fer6, associated with ATP-binding cassette transporter protein (MW691283), showed a 1.91-fold decrease, while Fer5, linked to N6-hydroxylysine acetyl transferase (MW691284), exhibited a 2.74-fold decrease. A decrease in the expression of two additional genes was observed in teliospores of T. frezii. The gene related to 7 alpha-cephem-methoxylase P8 chain (MW691288) showed a significant 8.33-fold decrease, while the expression of the gene related to peroxisomal amine oxidase (copper-containing) (MW691292) was down-regulated by a substantial 18.86-fold.\n\nIn the TCC category (Table 2), we observed a total of 21 up-regulated genes and 20 down-regulated genes in T. frezii during the transition from teliospores to hyphae. Among the up-regulated genes, we identified the aspartic protease (MW691301) gene, which exhibited a substantial 9.34-fold increase in teliospore expression. Additionally, the genes probable MET22 – protein ser/thr phosphatase (MW691299) and related to putative monooxygenase (MW691314) were also found to be up-regulated in T. frezii teliospores, with fold increases of 13.65 and 1.13, respectively.\n\nOne of the most prominently down-regulated genes was the amino acid permease (MW691333), which exhibited a substantial 35.90-fold decrease in expression in T. frezii teliospores. Additionally, among the other down-regulated genes, we observed a decrease in expression for those related to acetate kinase (MW691315), to opsin-1 (MW691321), and an uncharacterized protein (um02763) (MW691322) with fold decreases of 1.59, 4.96, and 5.39, respectively. Furthermore, in relation to the autophagy-related protein (MoAtg14) (MW691320), T. frezii showed a significant 4.37-fold decrease in expression levels when comparing teliospores to hyphae.\n\nIn the categories of CCDP, CF, CRDV, DIC, EN, INNA, PBF, SDBCC and TPF (Table 3), 22 up-regulated genes were found (2, 0, 5, 1, 6, 1, 1, 4 and 2 respectively) and 13 down-regulated genes (4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 and 4 respectively) in T. frezii transition from teliospores to hyphae.\n\nTable 3.\n\nGenes involved in CCDP, CF, CRDV, DIC, EN, INNA, PBF, SDBCC and TPF.\n\nCategory GenBank accession number Gene description Fold change T → H (times) CCDP MW691335 Clb2 (b-type cyclin 2) 2.20 UP CCDP MW691336 Related to G1/S-specific cyclin 1.73 UP CCDP MW691337 Related to DAD4 – outer kinetochore protein (part of Dam1 complex) 4.96 DOWN CCDP MW691338 Hus1-like protein 4.97 DOWN CCDP MW691339 DNA repair protein RAD51 homolog 1 8.22 DOWN CCDP MW691340 Putative fimbrin 9.37 DOWN CF MW691341 Inhibitor of apoptosis-promoting Bax1 17.37 DOWN CF MW691342 Putative dioxygenase Ssp1 18.32 DOWN CRDV MW691343 lon protease homolog 2 36.83 UP CRDV MW691344 Putative chaperone ATPase 27.49 UP CRDV MW691345 HSP70 14.27 UP CRDV MW691346 Chitin synthase 13.01 UP CRDV MW691347 Peroxisomal membrane protein 7.36 UP CRDV MW691348 Taurine catabolism dioxygenase TauD 29.24 DOWN DIC MW691349 Erg11 (sterol 14 alpha-demethylase) 5.53 UP DIC MW691350 Cytochrome P450 94A1 6.97 DOWN EN MW691351 Putative glutamate dehydrogenase, NAD(+)-specific 47.90 UP EN MW691352 Enoyl-(acyl carrier protein) reductase 27.10 UP EN MW691353 Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 21.26 UP EN MW691354 Putative carnitine O-acetyltransferase 11.96 UP EN MW691355 Putative acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase 9.46 UP EN MW691356 Putative acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase precursor 8.42 UP INNA MW691357 Putative neutral amino acid permease 9.74 UP PBF MW691358 Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase 12.42 UP SDBCC MW691359 Related to CDC20 (cell division control protein) 25.06 UP SDBCC MW691360 Root hair defective 3 GTP-binding protein 6.48 UP SDBCC MW691361 Related to YSC84 (protein involved in the organization of actin cytoskeleton) 4.99 UP SDBCC MW691362 Related to chitinase A precursor 2.36 UP SDBCC MW691363 Related to GTP-binding protein Rab5c 1.98 DOWN TPF MW691364 S8 family peptidase 13.87 UP TPF MW691365 Serine carboxypeptidase S28 11.02 UP TPF MW691366 tRNA methyl transferase 4.53 DOWN TPF MW691367 Putative Rer1 family protein 5.13 DOWN TPF MW691368 Uncharacterized protein 5.69 DOWN TPF MW691369 Peptidase family M28 129.88 DOWN\n\nCCDP: cell cycle and DNA processing; CF: cell fate; CRDV: cell rescue, defense and virulence; DIC: detoxification involving CYP450; EN: energy; INNA: interaction of nutrients and nutritional adaptation; PBF: protein with binding function or cofactor requirement; SDBCC: stress, cell differentiation and biogenesis of cellular components; TPF: transcription; T: teliospore; H: hypha.\n\nIn the cell cycle and DNA processing category, two genes were shown to be up-regulated in T. frezii teliospores, Clb2 (b-type cyclin 2) (MW691335) and the gene related to G1/S-specific cyclin (MW691336) (fold increases of 2.2 and 1.73, respectively). In the cell rescue, defense and virulence category, the peroxisomal membrane protein (MW691347) was 7.36-fold up-regulated at RNA level in T. frezii teliospores. We also found a 14.27-fold increase in the Hsp70 protein (MW691345) in teliospores. With regard to the synthesis of chitin, one of the most important components of the fungal cell wall, we found that one of the genes that codes for chitin synthase (MW691346) increased 13.01-fold in teliospores, compared to the hyphal stage in T. frezii. In DIC category, we found just one up-regulated gene, the sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (MW691349), an essential enzyme in sterol biosynthesis, which was 5.53-fold up-regulated in T. frezii teliospores. In SDBCC category, some of the up-regulated genes in T. frezii teliospores were those related to CDC20 – cell division control protein (MW691359), to YSC84 – a protein involved in the organization of actin cytoskeleton (MW691361) and to chitinase A precursor (MW691362) (25.06, 4.99, 2.36 respectively). One of the proteins related to nutritional adaptation function, the putative neutral amino acid permease (MW691357), was found to be 9.71-fold up-regulated in T. frezii teliospores. In the energy category, we found the enoyl-(acyl carrier protein) reductase (MW691352), which is the last enzyme in the fatty acid elongation cycle19, its expression exhibited a 27.10-fold increase in T. frezii teliospores.\n\nIn our analysis of down-regulated genes in teliospores, we observed significant decreases in the expression of two genes belonging to the cell fate category: Ssp1 protein kinase (MW691342) and the inhibitor of apoptosis-promoting Bax1 (MW691341)9. These genes exhibited a remarkable 18.32 and 17.37-fold reduction, respectively. The gene that encodes for putative Rer1 family protein (MW691367) was also down-regulated in teliospores.\n\nRegarding the genes that participate in multiple pathways (Table S3), a total of 26 up-regulated genes and 9 down-regulated genes were identified. Notably, probable adenosylhomocysteinase (MW691399) exhibited a substantial 6.93-fold increase, while probable SMC2 – a chromosome segregation protein (MW691373) showed a modest 1.09-fold up-regulation. In contrast, PacC – a transcription factor (MW691404), experienced a remarkable 2.48-fold down-regulation. We also found three other up-regulated genes, TPM2 – tropomyosin isoform 2 (MW691380), mitochondrial porin (MW691376), and CipC homolog (MW691370), which were 7.40, 5.00, and 8.44-fold increased, respectively.\n\nIn the unclassified genes category (Table S2), during the transition from teliospores to the hyphal stage, a total of 13 up-regulated genes and 10 down-regulated genes were observed. Notably, the um10414 protein (MW691406) exhibited a significant up-regulation, with a remarkable 49.29-fold increase in gene expression. On the other hand, the genes encoding for um05276 (MW691418), um10868 (MW691421), um04575 (MW691424), and um10208 (MW691425) showed down-regulation, with their expression levels exhibiting 1.45, 1.72, 12.50, and 15.74-fold decreases, respectively.\n\nGenes that code for proteins involved in metabolism\n\nBy examining the expression patterns of specific genes, we identified the cytochrome-C peroxidase gene (MW691239) where the transcript showed a remarkable 14-fold increase in teliospores. It is noteworthy that in the fungus Candida albicans, this protein has been targeted for antifungal treatment using quinonemethide27, which effectively reduces its expression. Hence, considering this relationship, it could be proposed as a potential alternative for controlling T. frezii. Furthermore, our analysis of the expression levels of the GAPDH transcript (MW691253) revealed an 8-fold increase in the teliospore stage; this finding aligns with observations made in Penicillium marneffei11 where there was an impressive 20-fold increase in the expression of this gene. This gene is described to encode an enzyme that plays a crucial role in an adhesion factor for conidial attachment. We also made a discovery regarding haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase (MW691229) which has been previously identified as an important virulence factor in Pyrenophora teres f. teres10. Notably, the expression of this gene is substantially elevated in T. frezii teliospores. In U. maydis, the transcriptomic analysis revealed a 3-fold increase, while the protein analysis indicated a 2.0–2.2-fold induction3. Conversely, the glutaminase A enzyme (MW691236) exhibits a striking 85-fold increase in RNA levels in U. maydis, compared to a near 20-fold increase in T. frezii teliospores3. Furthermore, the enzyme 2-methylcitrate dehydratase (MW691261) exhibited a 1.81-fold increase at the protein level in U. maydis, coinciding with a nearly 7-fold increase in transcription levels in T. frezii teliospores17. Glycerol 2-dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) (MW691268) has been identified as a key player in glycerol catabolism under microaerobic conditions in U. maydis. Interestingly, in T. frezii teliospores, its expression level showed a significant nearly 5-fold increase compared to hyphae. This notable increase in protein expression was also observed in U. maydis3. Additionally, in our study, we found a consistent 5-fold increase in the expression of UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (MW691270) at the protein level both in U. maydis3 and T. frezii teliospores.\n\nAldo-keto reductase yakc [NADP+] (MW691282), nearly experienced a 2-fold decrease in T. frezii teliospores in relation to hyphae. This enzyme from the reductase superfamily, also showed a 1.97-fold decrease (at protein level) in U. maydis17. Both Fer6, which is associated with ATP-binding cassette transporter protein (MW691283), and Fer5, linked to N6-hydroxylysine acetyl transferase (MW691284), exhibited approximately a 2-fold downregulation in T. frezii teliospores compared to hyphae. In contrast, in U. maydis, the same genes demonstrated a much more pronounced down-regulation with 80.5 and 165.4-fold decrease (RNA) respectively. A decrease in the expression of those related to 7 alpha-cephem-methoxylase P8 chain (MW691288) was observed both in teliospores of T. frezii and of U. maydis (8 and 2 times, respectively)18. In the same article, the expression of those related to peroxisomal amine oxidase (copper-containing) (MW691292) was found to be down-regulated by 61-fold in U. maydis18 and we found a nearly 19-fold decrease in teliospores of T. frezii.\n\nGenes involved in transport and cellular communication\n\nDuring our gene expression analysis focused on proteins involved in transport and cell communication processes, we made a remarkable observation regarding the expression of aspartic protease (MW691301), known as a protein expressed during the early stages of sunflower cotyledon infection by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum21. In T. frezii, in the teliospore stage, the expression of this enzyme exhibited a significant 9.34-fold increase. Notably, in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis fungi, during the infection process, this gene was up-regulated by 9.5-fold5, suggesting its potential importance in the infection process. Comparisons in the expression levels of several genes with their orthologues of U. maydis are compiled in the work of Ruiz-Herrera et al.18 Among these comparisons, it was observed that the genes encoding for probable MET22 – protein ser/thr phosphatase (MW691299) and related to putative monooxygenase (MW691314) were up-regulated in both T. frezii and U. maydis, showing 13.65 and 1.13-fold changes in T. frezii, and 2.3 and 2.5 in U. maydis, respectively.\n\nIn terms of down-regulated genes, the authors reported that the genes related to acetate kinase (MW691315), related to opsin-1 (MW691321), and uncharacterized protein (um02763) (MW691322) exhibited down-regulation in the same direction in U. maydis. The fold changes observed were 1.59, 4.96, and 5.39 in T. frezii, and 10.9, 5, and 114 in U. maydis, respectively. One of the most significant down-regulated genes identified was the amino acid permease (MW691333), which plays a fundamental role in fluconazole resistance and is the target of plant secondary metabolites with antifungal properties. In U. maydis, it exhibited specific expression during budding6, while in T. frezii hyphae, its expression showed a 36-fold increase. With regard to the autophagy-related protein (MoAtg14) (MW691320), a study conducted by Liu et al.12, demonstrated that the deletion of this protein in Magnaporthe oryzae resulted in a complete loss of virulence and conidiation problems. However, contrary to our expectations, T. frezii, exhibited a decreased 4.37-fold expression during the fungi transition.\n\nGenes that code for proteins involved in CCDP, CF, CRDV, DIC, EN, INNA, PBF, SDBCC and TPF\n\nIn the cell cycle and DNA processing category, only two genes were shown to be up-regulated during the transition in both T. frezii and U. maydis, Clb2 (b-type cyclin 2) (MW691335) and those related to G1/S-specific cyclin (MW691336)18.\n\nIn the cell rescue, defense, and virulence category, the peroxisomal membrane protein (MW691347) exhibited a significant up-regulation of nearly 7-fold in T. frezii. Similarly, at the protein level, it showed a 2.31-fold up-regulation in U. maydis17. Another up-regulated gene encoding for the Hsp70 protein (MW691345) is considered essential for many cellular processes and plays a major role in various stress conditions. Its synthesis is induced by heat shock stress, as observed in U. maydis with a 5-fold increase in heating conditions8. It has also been observed to be up-regulated during plant pathogenesis32. Concerning the synthesis of chitin, we found that one of the genes that codes for chitin synthase (MW691346)30 is 13-fold up-regulated in teliospores of T. frezii. Interestingly, this gene has been previously reported to be exclusive to the hyphae stage in the fungus Mucor circinelloides14, highlighting its differential expression during the transition process. These findings support the existence of a multigene chitin synthase family, where expression varies according to the fungal stage. This suggests that different chitin synthase activities may play distinct roles in the dimorphic growth of M. circinelloides.\n\nAnother up-regulated gene expressed in T. frezii is sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (MW691349), which participates in sterol biosynthesis in eukaryotes and is a clinical target for antifungal azoles, and was also up-regulated in U. maydis18 (2.7 times). The authors also reported up-regulation of genes related to CDC20 – cell division control protein (MW691359), YSC84 (MW691361) and chitinase A precursor (MW691362) in U. maydis18 (with 2.5, 2.0, 6.7-fold increases, respectively). A notable virulence factor found in various fungi, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, is associated with a neutral amino acid permease (MW691357)16. Research reveals that these fungi possess twenty-four and twenty-seven genes, respectively, that encode for this protein, further contributing to their virulence.\n\nThe enoyl-(acyl carrier protein) reductase (ENRs), an enzyme that belongs to the energy category, was remarkably up-regulated in teliospores. This is interesting because this protein catalyzes the last step of the elongation cycle in the synthesis of fatty acids, whose biosynthesis is essential for survival in mammals, plants, fungi and bacteria19. The growing interest in ENRs is mainly due to the fact that a variety of antimicrobial compounds, such as triclosan, are shown to specifically target their activity.\n\nThe Ssp1 protein kinase (MW691342), identified as one of the down-regulated genes in the CF category, plays a crucial role in facilitating the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton following osmotic stress. In T. frezii, its expression increased by 18-fold in the hyphal stage compared to the teliospore stage. However, in U. maydis, during the transition from the budding to the filamentous stage, this increase was comparatively lower, at only 4-fold6. Putative Rer1 family protein (MW691367) is involved in the retrieval of endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins from the early Golgi compartment. In T. frezii, this gene expression was 5.13-fold decreased in teliospores, while in M. haptotylum knobs/mycelium transition, the down-expression was 1.361.\n\nMartínez-Soto et al.18, found many genes differentially expressed in the transition between spore and hyphae in U. maydis, particularly, three genes, two of which were up-regulated and one was down-regulated: probable adenosylhomocysteinase (MW691399), probable SMC2 – chromosome segregation protein (MW691373) and pacC – transcription factor pacC (MW691404) (2 (up); 10.3 (up) and 9.2 (down) fold, respectively). T. frezii orthologues genes were also differentially expressed and in the same direction (up- or down-regulated). Finally, three other genes were up-regulated in the U. maydis dimorphism17, TPM2 (tropomyosin isoform 2 (MW691380), a component of fungal filaments), mitochondrial porin (MW691376) (which allows the passage of small molecules across the mitochondrial outer membrane and is involved in complex interactions regulating organelle and cellular metabolism) and CipC homolog (MW691370) (5.95; 2.25 and 14.04-fold at protein level, respectively). Coincidentally, we observed that the orthologues of these genes in T. frezii were also up-regulated.\n\nAt least five uncharacterized proteins were differentially expressed in both T. frezii and U. maydis. In the transition of U. maydis, the variation of the transcripts of the um10414 protein was 3.5-fold increased; a trend that was also observed in its orthologous protein in T. frezii. In contrast, four other proteins, um05276, um10868, um04575 and um10208 displayed down-regulation with fold changes of 11.7; 2.7; 2.6 and 4.7-fold decrease, respectively. Similarly, the transcripts levels of their orthologous proteins in T. frezii (MW691418, MW691421, MW691424 and MW691425) were also down-regulated.\n\nIn conclusion, many cellular processes are involved in the morphological shifts from teliospores to hyphae of T. frezii, which makes it difficult to fully understand the intricacies of this complex process. For this reason, different approaches are necessary before we can explain this process at a molecular level. Consequently, we believe that our comprehensive analysis of the entire transcriptome during this transition serves as a fundamental step toward understanding this phenomenon and may lay the foundation for future studies of the molecular processes that occur during infection."
