Sloan, S. Reilly, J. Trappe & A. Giachini, Trappe 26378, holotype CANB 748741!, isotype in OSC.\n\nEtymology. The epithet is a combination of the prefix ‘austro-’ and the ending ‘-minimum’, meaning that this species corresponds to the Australasian specimens for which the name G. minimum has been used.\n\nDiagnosis — Exoperidium 17–35 mm diam in horizontal position, arched, with 6–11(–13) not hygrometric rays. Endoperidial body 5–10 mm diam, greyish cream to brownish grey. Mesoperidium as a dense layer of crystalline matter. Largest mesoperidial crystalline aggregates of COM scales 30–105 μm diam, often very abundant and densely covering the endoperidial surface.

The collection UPS F-127433 contains three basidiomata, all of them wellconserved and two of them with the pseudoparenchymatous layer in good condition, glued to a sheet of paper in different positions, and clearly showing both big crystals on endoperidial surfaces, and a whitish stalk. The collection UPS F-127434 consists of a single, well-conserved basidioma with big crystals on the endoperidial surface, being the stalk hidden by the pressing procedure, but if the endoperidial body is carefully lifted, a short, whitish stalk can be seen. This collection was additionally marked by C.G. Lloyd as “This is a type but the species = G. minimus”, and the number 317 is the one that Fuckel (1860) used for enumerating the species in the protologue. Finally, the collection Herbier Barbey-Boissier 2138 contains another three basidiomata, one of them rather young and the other two somewhat old, showing big crystals on endoperidial surfaces and whitish stalks as well. All these specimens are in full agreement with the concept of the species followed here. One of these collections can be selected as lectotype and, since Lloyd considered the collection UPS F-127434 as ‘type’, and the number 317 is the one used by Fuckel in the protologue of the species, we designate this collection as the lectotype for the species. Geastrum queletii was briefly described by Hazslinszky (1883) based on material collected by Quélet (1873), who named it as ‘Geaster umbilicatus’. There is one specimen at the Stockholm herbarium marked as ‘typus’ (S {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"F16394\",\"term_id\":\"4823691\",\"term_text\":\"F16394\"}}F16394) by a latter hand than that of Hazslinsky, and in the original label it is marked ‘Geaster Quéleti Hasz.’. It consists of a single, well-preserved basidioma, which shows big crystals on the endoperidial surface and a whitish stalk, collected from Jura by Quélet. This specimen has been designated as lectotype and, in agreement with our concept of G. granulosum, it is considered as a heterotypic synonym.\n\nGeastrum kuharii J.C.

Overseas, sine loc.; on soil; ex herb. M. J. Berkeley; Herbarium Mycologicum Berkeleyanum, presented by the Rev. M.J. Berkeley, 1879; K(M) 169190”, which consists of three more or less well-preserved basidiomata, in agreement with the protologue and with the concept of the species presented here. However, whether it is part of the original material studied by Vittadini or not is difficult to say with certainty, due to the absence of ecological and geographical data on the herbarium label. The description and the iconography from Vittadini (1842) suggest that the concept he used may be the same as considered here, but they are not detailed enough to clearly distinguish this species from the morphologically close G. granulosum, because crystals on the endoperidial surface and the stalk colour are not mentioned. For this reason, although f. VI of t. I in Vittadini (1842) is part of the protologue and has been designated here as lectotype, in absence of unambiguous original material, an epitype should also be chosen in order to fix the interpretation of this species. Therefore, we have designated as epitype one sequenced specimen from the Mediterranean basin, collected in sandy, siliceous soil, which consists of six well-developed and typical basidiomata. Geastrum cesatii (Rabenhorst 1851) was described from specimens collected by Cesati in Piedmont (near Vercelli). We have not been able to trace any original material, but there are two specimens in the Stockholm herbarium (S), and one in the Berlin herbarium (B), collected by Cesati near Vercelli after Rabenhorst’s (1851) publication, being part of the Erbario Crittogamico Italiano serie I, n. 590, in agreement with the protologue and with the concept of G. marginatum followed here. Thus, the name is considered as a heterotypic synonym of G. marginatum. In absence of original material, any of these collections may serve as a good neotype for the name. Geastrum minimum var. fumosicollum (Staněk 1958) is also considered as a heterotypic synonym, since morphological data agree with those of typical basidiomata of G. marginatum, and molecular data place the holotype within the strongly supported G. marginatum clade ( ). Geastrum juniperinum (Macbride 1912) was not described in detail, but according to the iconography of the protologue it could be possibly another heterotypic synonym. Since original specimens have not been studied by us yet, and considering that some species in G. subsect. Quadrifida are difficult to be distinguished, we prefer to indicate such synonymy with an expression of doubt.\n\nGeastrum quadrifidum Pers., Neues Mag. Bot. 1: 86. 1794; Pers., Syn. Meth.

Largest mesoperidial crystals of COD on the endoperidial surface (10–)15–50(–60) μm diam, bipyramidal, abundant. Mesoperidial crystalline aggregates of COM scales normally very scarce or inconspicuous, about 5–25(–30) μm diam. Peristome fibrillose, conical to papillate, rarely flat, mostly sharply delimited. Stalk often stout, (0.3–)1.0–2.0(–2.5) mm high, whitish to brownish grey.

Therefore, although in perfect agreement with the current concept of this species, it is to be superseded according to Art. 9.19(a) because original material (pl. XXXVII in Schmidel (1793)) exists. Protologues and original material of G. coronatum (Scop.) J. Schröt. (nom. illeg.), G. quadrifidum var. minus, and G. quadrifidum var. sabulosum agree with the concept of the species followed here, and are considered heterotypic synonyms.\n\nGeastrum subsect.

Exoperidium splitting in 6–11 more or less equal to unequal rays, 7–21 mm diam apparently, 12–24 mm diam when forced in horizontal position, arched, often more or less hygrometric. Mycelial layer thin, whitish to pale cream, strongly intermixed with debris from the substrate, more or less strongly adhered to the fibrous layer but sometimes peeling-off in some parts. Fibrous layer papyraceous to slightly coriaceous when denuded, whitish to pale-cream coloured. Pseudoparenchymatous layer pale cream to greyish cream, not or only superficially cracked, < 0.5 mm thick in dry state, about 1 mm thick when fresh, rather persistent. Endoperidial body subglobose to ellipsoid, rarely irregular, 3.5–6.5 mm diam, dark brown to blackish; endoperidial surface glabrous or almost so. Mesoperidium as a rather thick, more or less powdery, layer of whitish pruina. Peristome sulcate, with the same colour as the endoperidial surface, mostly narrowly conical, 0.5–1.5 mm high, distinctly or indistinctly delimited. Stalk present but often short, 0.5–1.3 mm high, greyish brown to brown, sometimes light coloured. Apophysis present or absent, with the same colour as the endoperidium. Columella intruding about 1/3–1/2 into the glebal mass, with a more or less rounded apex. Mature gleba brownish.\n\nMicroscopic characteristics — Basidia not seen. Basidiospores globose to subglobose, 4.0–5.5 μm diam, brownish to yellowish brown, with 0.3–0.6 μm high brown warts, ornamentation verrucose to irregularly pilate.

Endoperidium composed of 2.5–6.5 μm wide, pale yellowish to yellowish brown, aseptate, mostly unbranched, slightly sinuous, strongly intertwined, thick-walled hyphae, lumen visible; protruding hyphae not seen. Peristomal hyphae 2.5–7.5 μm wide, light brown, aseptate, mostly unbranched, thick-walled (1.0–3.0 μm thick), lumen visible or not, more or less straight to sinuous, narrowing at apex, tips mostly acute, some rounded. Mesoperidium present on the endoperidium and pseudoparenchymatous layer surfaces, consisting of very small, bipyramidal crystals, the largest 6.0–12 diam, intermixed with abundant 1.0–2.5 μm wide, more or less hyaline, branched, thin-walled, clamped hyphae. Pseudoparenchymatous layer of thin-walled (≤ 1 μm thick), hyaline to pale yellowish cells, variable in shape and size, about 12.5–65 × 9–35 μm. Fibrous layer with 1.5–4.0 μm wide, hyaline to very pale yellowish, aseptate, straight or slightly sinuous, intertwined, mostly unbranched, comparatively thick-walled (0.7–1.5 μm thick) hyphae, lumen visible.

Zamora, holotype MA-Fungi 69583!, isotypes K(M) 147057! and PC 0092573! Numerous paratypes were also cited by Zamora & Calonge (2007).\n\nSynoptic description (based on Zamora & Calonge (2007) and studied specimens) — Exoperidium (13–)19–47 mm diam in horizontal position, arched, divided in 5–12 non-hygrometric rays. Endoperidial body 5–16 mm diam, mostly dark brown to blackish. Columella with a rounded, rarely somewhat acute, rather deciduous apex. Mesoperidium very abundant, powdery. Largest mesoperidial crystals of COD on the endoperidial surface 5.5–12.5 μm diam, bipyramidal. Peristome sulcate, distinctly delimited or not, with 7–23 folds. Stalk 0.5–2.5(–3.0) mm high, mostly brownish to dark brown, rarely pale coloured. Basidiospores globose, (4.5–)5.0–7.0(–7.5) μm diam, with (0.4–)0.5– 1.0(–1.2) μm high warts, ornamentation verrucose to irregularly pilate. Broadest capillitial hyphae (5.0–)5.5–8.0(–8.5) μm diam. Pseudoparenchymatous layer of thin-walled (mostly ≤ 1 μm thick) cells.\n\nEcology & Distribution — This species grows in siliceous, calcareous and gypsiferous soils, under both coniferous and broadleaf trees, being known only from the central Iberian Peninsula (Zamora & Calonge 2007, Jeppson 2013). Those records belong to the ‘Mediterranean forests, woodlands and scrub’ biome of the Paleartic ecozone.\n\nAdditional specimens examined.
