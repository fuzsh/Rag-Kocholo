Suddenly we found in Internet the tour Marvelous Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. Addressed the Bookmundi and we think we were lucky that Anna answered us. She was so patient and communicative, helped as during the whole booking process and the main thing- gave us great discount. We felt attention and a warm attitude. Let's hope with her light hand we will get a good tour and everything that Bookmundi promised we will get from Indus company. If everything will go well we promise to write once more with our expressions on the tour itself.

Read more Maria was wonderfully supportive when she learned that the trip I booked would not be feasible to my abilities (prosthetic knees, bad joints), which only became clear to me through the passenger indemnity document from the other company involved - no lifts, no porterage, aggressive pace, potential to be left behind if not fast enough. By the time I had that clause it was too late to get ANY of my over$6000 refunded. Maria went all out on my behalf to work with the other company, called me on a weekend(!) to share the fantastic news that I would be refunded 90% of what I paid! She saved our long planned, once in a lifetime, overseas family trip. We were able to switch to a more reasonably paced, accommodating tour thanks to Maria! I am forever grateful and look forward to future trip planning with Maria ♥️ Read less\n\nJennie\n\nNow that our tour is over, I just wanted to take the opportunity to... Read more Now that our tour is over, I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for all your help in organizing this great experience! We would like to point out that we really liked the driver who picked us up from the train station on our first day! Of course we only interacted with him shortly but he left such a good impression that we wanted to share this with you. Also two little suggestions for improvement: 1. On day 5 of the tour, we agreed with our fellow travellers that we would leave out the visit of Tashilunpo Monastery in the morning and go straight to EBC. Despite leaving it out, we still arrived at EBC very late (around 8.30pm). We suggest that the monastery is removed from the itinerary as otherwise the day would be very, very long. 2. What is advertised as \"Everest Base Camp\" on the website is not the real EBC. We think that this should be made clear so that no one is disappointed. For future reference, there is definitely a public bus going from Rasuwa Ghadi to Syapru Besi (we are also pretty sure that it continues on to Kathmandu). We took the bus from just after the immigration office to Syapru Besi, it took about 45-60min and cost us 150 Rupees (about USD 1.13) per person.
