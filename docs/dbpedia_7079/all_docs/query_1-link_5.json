        "text": "‘punilla two’ by GOD Y | Swiss Instrumental DIY Project\n\nExclusive video premiere of ‘punilla two’ by GOD Y, a project by Manuel Clausen, founding member of the Swiss independent record label Ikarus Records based in Zurich.\n\nSince 2011 he runs the label with Rohan Olagamage and some other guys. Manuel Clausen does promo, booking and takes care of the bands. He was drummer for three Ikarus Records bands (The Pilot, Kid Ikarus and Davv). On social media he uses his alias Gody Schwendimann, that’s how the name GOD Y has been created (pronounced “god why”).\n\n‘punilla two’ is the second track by GOD Y. A year ago he released his first track ‘la falda one’. Manuel Clausen lived his first five years in the region Punilla, Argentina. That had a great influence on him. His parents were subsistence farmers. He had spent most of his time outside in the nature. At the moment he is living in the suburbs of Zurich with a beautiful garden.\n\nThe opening guitar arpeggio part is nearly 20 years old. During his college time he wasn’t allowed to study the drums so he had to start with classical guitar. Luckily GOD Y can now use this part for his second song. All instruments were played and recorded by GOD Y (guitar, bass, drums and synth) at “Cielo Malo” studio in Zurich. The powerful track can be classified as Post Rock/Instrumental Rock. The guitar on ‘punilla two’ was made by Rohan Olagamage, a member of Ikarus Records. Since some time Rohan builds his own guitars and basses made out of reused wood. He sells them as Rohan guitars. GOD Y recently received a Rohan bass, which will be heard on the next GOD Y track. Benjamin Schmid has done again the powerful mix. He is a member of another Ikarus Records band called Duara. All members of Duare are also founding members of Ikarus Records. Dan Suter of Echochamber in Zurich has done the mastering.\n\nThe video of ‘punilla two’ has been made by Yvonne Schmid and GOD Y. All scenes were filmed with only two smart phones."
