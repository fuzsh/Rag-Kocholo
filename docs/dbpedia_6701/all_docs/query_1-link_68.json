        "text": "President Reuven Rivlin of Israel has become an honorary citizen of Seoul. Since 1988, Reuven Rivlin has served as a member of the Knesset for Likud and served as Minister of Communications, chairman, Speaker of the Knesset twice before he was elected as the 10th President of Israel in July 2014. He has been performing his presidential duties for five years, and presidents serves single seven-year terms in Israel. President Reuven Rivlin of Israel, who officially visited Korea from July 14 to 18 following an invitation from President Moon Jae-in, was presented with an honorary citizenship of Seoul at Seoul City Hall before noon on the 18th. Mayor Park Won-soon toured around the Middle East and Europe for eight days and six nights in May 2019. During that time, the Mayor stayed in Israel for three days, drawing up solutions for boosting the economy, which is the focal task for governing the city of Seoul. The young generation in Israel is taking the lead for the innovative economic growth of the nation as they learn the practical knowledge surrounding information, communications, and science during the required military service term and begin businesses that grow into NASDAQ-listed companies. Therefore, during the tour, Mayor Park Won-soon visited Tel Aviv, the city that is called the mecca of entrepreneurship in Israel. There, he discussed with Israeli entrepreneurs, who were formerly the soldiers of the elite special units, Talpiot and 8200 Unit, different ways to create an ecosystem for the vicious cycle between investments and starting businesses. In addition, Seoul and Tel Aviv agreed on an MOU for an amicable relationship promising the ▴ development of a partnership to improve the ecosystem for start-ups and inspire innovative entrepreneurship, ▴ efforts to offer mentoring services, networking, and consultations for the start-ups that have entered or want to enter the other city, ▴ collaboration for interactions in the field of culture and tourism, and ▴ sharing of advanced cases and expertise in the fields of transportation, smart city, design, sustainable development, social innovation, sharing economy, IT, sports, education, and more. Mayor Park Won-soon said, “Both Korea and Israel have been developed into countries with strong economies in short periods of time based on excellent human resources, despite the physical limitations coming from a lack of natural resources and relatively small lands. I hope the honorary citizenship of Seoul bestowed to President Reuven Rivlin will become a catalyst to vitalize exchanges between Seoul and Israel. Hopefully Seoul can mark a new milestone of a leap in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution by introducing an excellent environment for investment and outstanding entrepreneurship, or the ‘chutzpah’ spirit, of Israel.”"
