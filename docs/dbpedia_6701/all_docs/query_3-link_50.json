        "text": "JERUSALEM — Benny Gantz, the centrist former army chief battling to depose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, on Sunday won the endorsements of a narrow majority of lawmakers, earning him a fresh chance to form a government and break Israel’s yearlong political deadlock.\n\nThe surprise majority for Mr. Gantz, 60, who earned the backing both of Arab lawmakers often accused of sympathizing with terrorists and from ultranationalist lawmakers often called rabidly anti-Arab, puts him in a stronger-than-expected position to try to pry loose Mr. Netanyahu’s 11-year grip on power.\n\nIsrael’s president, Reuven Rivlin, said he would formally assign Mr. Gantz, of the Blue and White party, the mandate to form a government at midday on Monday.\n\nBut Mr. Rivlin also summoned Mr. Gantz and Mr. Netanyahu, 70, to his residence Sunday night for an “urgent conversation” about the possibility of bringing their parties together in a national unity government to contend with the emergency posed by the coronavirus pandemic. After about 90 minutes, Mr. Gantz and Mr. Netanyahu emerged and promised that their aides would continue the talks.\n\nThe momentous goings-on came on an extraordinarily tumultuous day. With much of the country grinding to a halt or stuck at home, Israeli citizens were still absorbing news of draconian measures that Mr. Netanyahu’s caretaker government was considering to fight the virus, including an idea to deploy secret surveillance tools now used to hunt terrorists to identify people who should be quarantined.\n\nThen, early Sunday, came word that the court system had been effectively shut down in a middle-of-the-night decree by Mr. Netanyahu’s handpicked justice minister, and that, a few hours later, Mr. Netanyahu’s criminal trial on bribery and other corruption charges, which was set to open on Tuesday, had been pushed off at least until late May.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
