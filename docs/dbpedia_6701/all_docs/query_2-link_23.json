        "text": "JERUSALEM, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said on Tuesday that he has picked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to try to form a government.\n\nRivlin announced his decision in a televised statement following a recent election that ended with no clear winner.\n\nThe president noted that even though Netanyahu, the country's longest-serving leader now facing corruption charges, still runs short of the 61 seats needed to form a majority coalition in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, he holds the most support, 52 seats, and therefore has \"a slightly higher chance of forming a government.\"\n\nHowever, the president also admitted that \"no candidate has a realistic chance of forming a government that will have the confidence of the Knesset.\"\n\n\"I know the position held by many that the president should not give the role to a candidate that is facing criminal charges,\" Rivlin said. \"But according to the law and the decision of the courts, a prime minister can continue in his role even when he is facing charges.\"\n\nThe decision means that Netanyahu now has 28 days to put together a coalition government, with a possibility of a two-week extension before Rivlin tasks another candidate or asks the Knesset to choose one.\n\nNetanyahu, who has been in power since 2009, is facing a criminal trial over corruption charges in three separate cases. His trial in the Jerusalem District Court resumed on Monday with the prosecution's opening arguments.\n\nNo party gained enough votes to form a majority government in the March 23 elections. It was Israel's fourth election in two years amid a lingering political deadlock. Enditem"
