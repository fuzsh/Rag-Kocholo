        "text": "NEW YORK(CBSNewYork) -- Looking to strengthen ties between Israel and the city's Latino community, Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. welcomed the President of Israel on Wednesday.\n\n\"What Latinos need to understand is that we have this strong connection with the people of Israel with the Jewish community,\" Diaz said.\n\nThe visit came just two weeks after Israeli President Reuven Rivlin welcomed Diaz and Hispanic leaders to Israel, 1010 WINS' Al Jones reported.\n\n\"We have a lot of cooperation between the Americans and Israelis, and it should also come to the Bronx,\" Rivlin said.\n\nEarlier in the day Rivlin was as the United Nations marking the 70th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust.\n\nOn Sunday, Rivlin addressed a largely African American congregation in Brooklyn recalling a shared history of struggle between Jews and African Americans.\n\nSpeaking at the Christian Cultural Center of Brooklyn, Rivlin evoked the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"He knew that one cannot fight for his own freedom without fighting for the freedom of others,\" Rivlin said.\n\nRivlin said he is hoping to bridge cultural divides.\n\n\"That Jerusalem will serve as model of co-existence between different communities and religions,\" he said.\n\nHis appearance in Brooklyn was celebrated by churchgoers and dignitaries, including U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.\n\n\"I'm confident that our two countries will remain close and strong, and God bless you. Welcome to Brooklyn,\" he said to Rivlin.\n\nA planned meeting between New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Rivlin, originally set for Thursday, has been canceled due to a change in the Israeli President's schedule."
