Below are the Speaker's remarks:\n\nSpeaker Pelosi. Mr. President, it is an official honor as Speaker of the House to welcome you to the United States Capitol. It is a personal pleasure for me to do so, as one who has admired your leadership for such a time.\n\nThe last time we were together was in – right before COVID struck. We were in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. It was a historic event, attended by kings and presidents and prime ministers and the rest at your invitation – at your invitation. I was honored to bring a bipartisan delegation to be with you to pay our respects.\n\nOn the way, we stopped in Auschwitz, our delegation did, to make the experience even more – even more meaningful to us. Upon our return, we passed legislation to allocate more resources for the study of the Holocaust in America.\n\nThat was the last time we were together, but all along we have had a great friendship. The support for Israel in this Congress is – has always been strongly bipartisan, as you wish. And it will continue to be so, because of our shared values and because of our mutual security concerns.\n\nSo again, our bipartisan group looks forward to meeting with you, having conversation with you. We're honored to receive you in the Capitol. And thank you for the friendship and for your visit.\n\nMr. President.\n\n# # #"
