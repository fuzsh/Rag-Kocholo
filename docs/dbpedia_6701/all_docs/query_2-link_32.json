        "text": "Israel's President has asked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to assemble a new government after power-sharing talks with his strongest rival, Benny Gantz, failed following an inconclusive election.\n\nBut Mr Netanyahu, leader of Israel's right-wing Likud party, faces a looming indictment on corruption allegations he has denied and still has no clear path to clinch a record-fifth term after emerging from the September 17 ballot without an outright majority.\n\nThat ballot was designed to clear a political impasse following an earlier national poll in April which also produced no clear winner, and Mr Netanyahu — who became Israel's longest-serving leader in July — failed to corral a ruling coalition.\n\nAccepting the mandate from President Reuven Rivlin at a televised ceremony, Mr Netanyahu said his chances of success were only marginally higher than those of Mr Gantz, a former general who heads the Blue and White party.\n\nNetanyahu has 28 days to form a coalition\n\nLoading...\n\nIn his remarks, Mr Netanyahu seemed to envision a scenario in which he and Mr Gantz could attempt another power-sharing arrangement if it became clear there was no way out of the current deadlock, save for a third election that few in Israel wanted.\n\nMr Netanyahu will have 28 days to form a coalition and can ask President Rivlin for a two-week extension if necessary.\n\nMr Rivlin, in his remarks, pointedly noted that he is under no obligation to grant his prime minister-designate that two-week extension to establish a governing coalition — nor did he commit to turning to Mr Gantz if Mr Netanyahu failed.\n\nUnder the law, Mr Rivlin can assign the coalition-building task to any member of parliament he deems likely to succeed, or he can ask the legislature to pick someone.\n\nWith final results announced on Wednesday, Likud has the pledged support of 55 MPs in the 120-member parliament, against 54 for Blue and White.\n\nThe Israeli parliament, known as the Knesset, requires a numerical majority of 61 seats for parties to form government.\n\nThe two parties failed to reach a coalition deal in talks launched on Tuesday.\n\nHe told Israeli Army Radio that if Blue and White \"continues to rule out Netanyahu on a personal basis and continues to rule out certain parties from sitting in that same unity government, at the end we may head to elections for a third time.\"\n\nCorruption charges prevent unity Government\n\nBlue and White wants Mr Gantz to lead any unity government and refuses to sit in a coalition with Mr Netanyahu so long as he faces likely indictment for a series of corruption scandals.\n\nBlue and White also objects to sitting with the right-wing and conservative religious bloc that Mr Netanyahu says he's committed to bringing into any government he forms.\n\nNeither side can form a government without the eight seats held by former Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who supports bringing the two main parties into a unity government without Mr Netanyahu's traditional allies.\n\nMr Netanyahu has welcomed a unity government but has insisted on one that includes his conservative allies.\n\nLooming large over the political jostling is Mr Netanyahu's legal woes.\n\nIsrael's Attorney-General has recommended charging the Prime Minister with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in a series of scandals and the embattled leader is set to appear at a hearing next week on the charges.\n\nThe likelihood of an indictment is high and could be handed down within weeks, though his allies had previously promised to seek parliamentary immunity for Mr Netanyahu.\n\nAlthough Mr Netanyahu is not required by Israeli law to step down if charged, he will face mounting pressure to stand down to face charges."
