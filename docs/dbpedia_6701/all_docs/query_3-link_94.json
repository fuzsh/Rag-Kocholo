        "text": "Last Tuesday, my cousin “Ruby” Reuven Rivlin emerged from two rounds of voting in the Knesset to become the 10th president of the State of Israel. It is said that being president in Israel is largely a ceremonial office, but look at what Shimon Peres did with it! The president receives all visiting dignitaries, he travels in the world representing Israel; for all intents and purposes, he becomes the face of Israel. And so, my wish for “Ruvi” (his name within the family) is that he will represent ALL OF ISRAEL’S CITIZENS.\n\nCartoon by Ranan Lurie (also a Rivlin relative)\n\nSince Ruvi’s election, every Rivlin claims him as a cousin, so let me begin by saying Ruvi is truly my first cousin. His mother, my father’s sister Ray (Rachel) Rivlin was my favorite aunt. She was one of 12 children born to Jerusalemites Yosef and Alta Rivlin who left Palestine for England after W.W. I. The cholera epidemic in Jerusalem and the economic downturn made it a difficult city in which to raise children. (For more on my family, see my film “The Tribe.”) Yosef and Alta moved from England to Brooklyn, creating more children along the way, culminating in a dozen. I might add, that one son became a Conservative Rabbi. Suffice it is to say, my grandparents returned to Palestine in 1929, and some of their children followed. Rachel (Ray) was the first to return. In the early days of the Yishuv, especially in Jerusalem, marriages took place within the extended families. Ray married a distant cousin who died a few years later, leaving her a young widow with two children. Family matchmakers soon coupled her with Yosef Yoel Rivlin, also widowed, and not long after, Reuven was born. (We Rivlins are into genealogy, and if you want more history, here is a link to a recent article.)"
