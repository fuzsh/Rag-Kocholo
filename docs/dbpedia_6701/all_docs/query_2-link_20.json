        "text": "Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid has moved closer to unseating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he officially informed the country’s president that he has reached agreements with political allies to form a new coalition government.\n\nLapid, of the centrist Yesh Atid party, reached a historic deal with Mansour Abbas, head of the United Arab List, to form the coalition shortly before a midnight (21:00 GMT) deadline on Wednesday.\n\nLapid’s main partner is far-right nationalist Naftali Bennett, and the pair have reached an agreement to rotate the prime minister position.\n\nTheir coalition government includes parties from across the political spectrum, including for the first time in Israel’s history a party that represents the country’s 21-percent Palestinian minority.\n\nThe agreement still needs to be approved by the Israeli parliament, in a vote that is expected to take place as early as next week. If it goes through, Lapid and his partners will end Benjamin Netanyahu’s record-setting, 12-year rule.\n\nHere are the latest updates:\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 21:15 GMT\n\n‘Everything to unite Israeli society’: Lapid\n\nIn a statement on Twitter, Lapid said he has informed the country’s president of the deal.\n\n“This government will work for all the citizens of Israel, those that voted for it and those that didn’t. It will do everything to unite Israeli society,” he said.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 20:36 GMT\n\nBennett to serve as PM, Lapid will be alternate PM\n\nBennett, head of the right-wing Yamina party, is to serve as the next Israeli prime minister and Lapid will serve as alternate prime minister, the president’s office has said.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 20:28 GMT\n\nLapid notifies president he has a coalition: Statement\n\nLapid has informed Israel’s president that he has the votes needed to form a coalition government to remove Netanyahu.\n\n“Lapid informed the president of the state of Israel … that he has succeeded in forming a government,” his party said in a statement.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 19:50 GMT\n\nUnited Arab List joins coalition aiming to remove Netanyahu: Statement\n\nMansour Abbas has joined a coalition to remove Netanyahu at the eleventh hour.\n\n“The chairperson of Ra’am (United Arab List), Mansour Abbas, signed a document which allows the chairperson of Yesh Atid, Yair Lapid, to inform the president he has succeeded in forming a government after agreements were reached,” Lapid’s spokesman said in a statement.\n\n“Mansour Abbas and Yair Lapid signed a coalition agreement to form a unity government.”\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 19:28 GMT\n\nLapid manages to form coalition government: Spokesperson\n\nLapid’s Yesh Atid party has formed a coalition government, his spokesman has said, and he will inform President Reuven Rivlin later on Wednesday.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 19:20 GMT\n\nAbbas signs agreement\n\nUnited Arab List leader Mansour Abbas has signed the coalition agreement, Al Jazeera’s Hoda Abdel-Hamid has reported.\n\nThe move now allows for the formation of a coalition Israeli government “that would be headed by far Right Yamina leader Naftali Bennett”, Abdel-Hamid wrote on Twitter. “Israeli media (is) in a frenzy over this”.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 19:12 GMT\n\nYamina MK considers opposing government\n\nYamina MK Nir Orbach is considering whether to oppose the proposed government, Channel 12 news reported. The move “could very likely sink its chances of being formed”, The Times of Israel said.\n\n“Reports have previously said that Orbach has considered resigning rather than vote to back the government”, The Times of Israel reported.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 19:03 GMT\n\nTwo hours left until deadline\n\nOnly two hours remain until a deadline to form a new government coalition expires.\n\nLapid must inform Israel’s largely ceremonial president, Reuven Rivlin, by midnight if he has formed a majority coalition of at least 61 Knesset seats. The assembly would then have a week to hold a vote of confidence.\n\nIf Lapid misses the deadline, Israel will almost certainly have a fifth election in just over two years and Netanyahu would have yet another chance to hold onto his position as he stands trial for corruption.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 18:57 GMT\n\n‘Truly historic moment’\n\nAs Mansour Abbas, head of the United Arab List, arrived at the hotel in Ramat Gan for negotiations in the final hours, Israeli political correspondent Tal Schneider called it a “historic moment”.\n\n“For the first time in Israel history an Arab party will become a part of a coalition,” Schneider wrote.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 18:39 GMT\n\nAbbas authorised to sign coalition agreement\n\nThe Shura Council has given the green light for United Arab List leader Mansour Abbas to agree to Lapid declaring that he can form a government, Channel 12 news has reported.\n\nThe network said the go-ahead is on condition of continued negotiations over the Kaminitz Law – which gives authorities more power to enforce demolition and eviction orders, and which Palestinian citizens of Israel say unfairly targets them – and unrecognised Bedouin villages in the southern Negev (Naqab) region, The Times of Israel reported.\n\nThe Yamina and New Hope parties have not yet formally signed up for the government.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 18:20 GMT\n\nRight wing to be given justice, foreign, interior ministries in second half of rotation\n\nAn agreement has been reached that if a government is established, the second half of the rotation will have New Hope head Gideon Sa’ar as foreign minister, Yamina’s Ayelet Shaked as justice minister and Yamina leader Naftali Bennett as interior minister, Haaretz has reported.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 17:24 GMT\n\n‘Abbas expected to sign coalition agreement tonight’\n\nSources connected to the Shura Council meeting have said they expect United Arab List leader Mansour Abbas “to sign the coalition agreement tonight”. “The atmosphere is optimistic,” Kan public broadcaster has reported.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 17:08 GMT\n\nHundreds protest for and against government\n\nHundreds of people are protesting for and against the formation of the new government outside the conference centre in Ramat Gan, where Bennett and Mansour Abbas, leader of the United Arab List are meeting, Israeli political correspondent Tal Schneider has reported.\n\nIf Bennett and Abbas finalise issues, Lapid will call President Reuven Rivlin to update him.\n\n“Later on, he will call speaker of the Knesset and the plenum will convene within a week to swear in the new government,” Schneider wrote on Twitter.\n\n“However, it seems that some MKs from Yamina [Bennett’s party] do not want this to go forward, hence it may all collapse.”\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 16:30 GMT\n\nUnited Arab List MK ‘not optimistic’ a deal will be reached\n\nMazen Ghanaim, United Arab List Member of Knesset (MK) has told Kan public broadcaster that he is “not optimistic” that a deal will be reached to form a government, despite reports of progress, The Times of Israel reported.\n\n“We had the courage to say that we want to be a legitimate player in Israeli politics, but apparently our declarations won’t bear fruit in the end,” Ghanaim told Kan.\n\n“Mansour Abbas [head of the United Arab List] is attacked from all sides – from within the Arab community, also from the Israeli right. Despite this, he is sitting at Kfar Maccabiah for two days already to bring an achievement for the Arab community. From what is happening in the negotiations behind closed doors, I’m not optimistic,” Ghanaim said.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 16:12 GMT\n\nLess than five hours left to form government\n\nNegotiations are still under way to form a new coalition government to replace Netanyahu.\n\nLapid has until Wednesday at 11:59pm (20:59 GMT) to inform President Reuven Rivlin and Knesset Speaker Yariv Levin that he can form a new government.\n\nIf he cannot do so, any MK could then try to build a coalition with the support of a majority of 61 MKs.\n\nIf legislators cannot agree on another candidate for prime minister, Israelis could return, yet again, to the polls.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 15:55 GMT\n\nGovernment hinges on ruling of Shura Council\n\nWith less than six hours left until the deadline to form a new government, the “main thing holding things up is the disagreement between [United Arab List, also known as Ra’am] and the right-wing parties on the extent of retroactive permits for illegal buildings in the Arab sector,” Haaretz writer Anshel Pfeffer wrote on Twitter.\n\n“Ra’am’s Shura council currently convened to decide whether to go ahead.\n\n“This is the first time that the formation of a new Israeli government has hinged on the ruling of a Shura Council, so that’s something at least, whatever the outcome,” Pfeffer wrote.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 15:42 GMT\n\nLikud calls on protests\n\nLikud has called on its ministers and Knesset members to gather outside the convention hall in Ramat Gan where the coalition-building talks are taking place to protest against the formation of a new government, Israeli media has reported.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 14:55 GMT\n\nThree signatures missing to form new government\n\nIsrael’s new government coalition agreement is waiting for signatures from Bennett, Gideon Saar of the New Hope party and Mansour Abbas of the United Arab List, journalist Noga Tarnopolsky posted on Twitter.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 14:37 GMT\n\n‘Our demands are clearly known’: Abbas\n\nMansour Abbas, leader of the United Arab List has played down allegations that he changed his demands in negotiations with Lapid, Haaretz has reported.\n\nIn an interview with Channel 12, Abbas said his party “wants to achieve things for the benefit of Arab society. We have no disputes about roles and authority,” Haaretz reported.\n\nAbbas said in negotiations with Lapid he has “put forward demands regarding the Arab citizens of the country who want a solution to the housing crisis and the municipal status of unrecognised localities in the Negev”.\n\n“We stick to this principle and our demands are clearly known. They are not difficult,” he said.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 14:18 GMT\n\nDemands of United Arab List ‘are impossible’: Negotiator\n\nAccording to Kan news reports, Ze’ev Elkin of the New Hope party has told Likud MKs that demands of the United Arab List on construction for Palestinian communities “are impossible for me and for [Ayelet] Shaked. We will not agree to them under any circumstances,” The Times of Israel reported.\n\nElkin is one of the leading negotiators in forming a so-called change government, The Times of Israel said.\n\nMansour Abbas, leader of the United Arab List, also known as Ra’am, has aimed to revoke a law that has hardened penalties for illegal construction, which is seen to affect Palestinian communities disproportionately.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 10:38 GMT\n\nLabour veteran Herzog elected Israel’s 11th president\n\nIsrael’s parliament elected the even-keeled Labour veteran Isaac Herzog as its 11th president.\n\nHerzog, 60, beat former head teacher Miriam Peretz to replace President Reuven Rivlin, who was elected in 2014 to the largely ceremonial position decided by the Knesset.\n\nHerzog, who will assume his position on July 9, succeeded Peretz, 67, who lost two children in Israel’s wars and is known as “the mother of sons”.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 09:32 GMT\n\nWho is Yair Lapid?\n\nA centrist opposition leader, Yair Lapid was once known largely for his successful career as a journalist and popular television host.\n\nHe is the Tel Aviv-born son of the fiercely secular former Justice Minister Yosef “Tommy” Lapid, who also left journalism to enter politics.\n\nRead more here.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 08:45 GMT\n\nLapid’s coalition talks stall: local media\n\nYair Lapid’s negotiations to establish the so-called “coalition for change” appeared to have stalled, according to Israeli daily newspaper Yediot Ahronot.\n\nIts report cited sources familiar with the details of the talks saying that many outstanding issues have already been resolved, including ministerial appointments.\n\nHowever, there is still disagreement over a seat on the committee for judicial appointments, a position already promised to Labour leader Merav Michaeli.\n\nAnother obstacle appears to be the demand of Ra’am leader Mansour Abbas to reverse, or at least temporarily suspend, a law that facilitates the demolition of homes built in violation of code, most prevalent in Arab communities.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 08:29 GMT\n\nWho is Naftali Bennett, Israel’s potential prime minister?\n\nNaftali Bennett is close to replacing Israel’s veteran prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nBennett is a multimillionaire former tech entrepreneur who made a name in politics with right-wing, religious-nationalist rhetoric.\n\nRead more here.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 07:30 GMT\n\nLapid enlists Defence Minister Gantz\n\nIsrael’s opposition leader moved closer to unseating Netanyahu after agreeing to terms with several parties, including one led by Defence Minister Benny Gantz.\n\nYair Lapid’s Yesh Atid party and Gantz’s centrist Blue and White said in a joint statement they had “agreed on the outlines of the government and core issues relating to the strengthening of democracy and Israeli society”.\n\n2 Jun 2021 - 06:46 GMT\n\nIsraeli parties in race to build anti-Netanyahu coalition\n\nIsraeli politicians battling to unseat Netanyahu are racing against the clock on the final day of talks to build a governing coalition comprised of bitter ideological rivals.\n\nThey have until a minute before midnight (20:59 GMT) on Wednesday to cobble together an administration that would end 12 years of rule by Israel’s longest-serving prime minister."
