        "text": "Israel's President, Reuven Rivlin, has declared his society \"ill\".\n\nSpeaking this week at a conference on xenophobia, he told the audience: \"The tension between Jews and Arabs within Israel has risen to record heights, and the relationship between all parties has reached a new low. We have all witnessed the shocking sequence of incidents and violence taking place by both sides.\"\n\nHe said the \"epidemic of violence\" was everywhere - it \"permeates every area\". He elaborated: \"There is violence in soccer stadiums as well as in the academia. There is violence in the social media and in everyday discourse.\"\n\nHe then surprised his audience by stating: \"It is time to honestly admit that Israeli society is ill - and it is our duty to treat this disease.\"\n\nWhile Israelis are used to hearing such strong comments from some on the left, they are unaccustomed to hearing them from the right.\n\nThere is an epidemic of violence, which permeates every area Reuven Rivlin\n\nMr Rivlin, who became president this summer, is pigeonholed as right-winger due to his affiliation to Likud and his rejection of the two-state solution.\n\nHe wrapped up his critique by paraphrasing the philosopher Martin Buber, saying: \"'I do not ask, 'Have we forgotten to be Jewish?' But instead I ask, have we forgotten to be human?\"\n\nDavid Amitai, spokesman for the dialogue organisation Givat Haviva, called it \"very courageous.\" He praised the president for promoting \"values of tolerance and democracy.\"\n\nBut Ari Briggs, director of the right-wing activist movement Regavim, said: \"I think it gives ammunition to people looking for excuses to damn Israel.\""
