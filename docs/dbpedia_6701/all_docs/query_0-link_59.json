        "text": "Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said Palestinians should be granted Israeli citizenship should Israel annex the West Bank.\n\nSpeaking at the pro-settlement B’Sheva Jerusalem Conference on Monday, Rivlin said that “Zion is entirely ours,” including the territory where Palestinians hope to build a state, according to the Times of Israel.\n\nRivlin warned against a piecemeal annexation of settlements, like an upcoming bill that would annex the large Jerusalem-area settlement Maale Adumim. Instead, he gave cautious support to full annexation, so long as it included full citizenship rights to Palestinians.\n\n“Applying sovereignty to an area gives citizenship to all those living there,” he said. “There is no [separate] law for Israelis and for non-Israelis.”\n\nRivlin has been sharply critical of Israel’s newly-passed law that retroactively legalizes settlements built on private Palestinian land, saying it will make Israel look like an “apartheid state.”\n\nRivlin believes in one state under Israeli sovereignty, dismissing concerns from critics that Israel’s Jewish character will be compromised by absorbing several million Palestinians. In the past, he has floated the idea of an Israeli-Palestinian confederation as an interim step to one state."
