He also called Biden \"a very good friend\" and noted their longstanding personal relationship. More broadly, he emphasized that the U.S.-Israel relationship is based on shared values and strategic interests. \"We know that the friendship between the Americans and the Israelis goes beyond politics,\" he said.\n\nDownload a transcript of their conversation.\n\nWatch video of the conversation below.\n\nOpen image\n\nOpen image\n\nOpen image\n\nHis Royal Highness King Abdullah II of Jordan Congratulates President Rivlin\n\nOpen image"
