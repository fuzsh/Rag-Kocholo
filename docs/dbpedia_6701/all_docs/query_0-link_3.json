        "text": "Today, perhaps more than ever, many people feel as if different sectors of Israeli society are moving apart in unprecedented ways.\n\nIn 2015, Israel’s 10th president, Reuven (Ruvi) Rivlin, gave a prescient speech that became known as the “The Four Tribes Speech.” In it, Rivlin outlined four key sectors or “tribes” that comprise Israeli society: secular Jews, national religious Orthodox Jews, ultra-Orthodox Haredi Jews, and Arabs. Rivlin opined that unity and full integration of all Israel’s sectors into its society and economy is the necessary/best/only path forward for Israel, and he urged people to not let these sectors remain disconnected.\n\nThe Hamsa Aleinu exhibition was created by Beit HaNasi—The Office of the President of the State of Israel—and its flagship program “Israeli Hope,” in partnership with Vibe Israel, an organization that specializes in storytelling around Israel. The exhibition showcased a few of the many creative partnerships that exist within Israeli society and the sense of mutual responsibility felt between Israelis and Jewish people around the world. Each photograph tells a real story, one unfolding in Israel every day—mostly far from the media’s spotlight.\n\nThese stories, and the many more like them, are the sparks that result from bold, new, and innovative partnerships between and among Israel’s different groups and communities. Taken together, they represent not only the indomitable Israeli spirit, but also the joy, curiosity, vitality, and creativity that can flow from the encounter and cooperation between all of us.\n\n“Israeli Hope” was a program for strengthening and establishing the partnership between the various groups comprising Israeli society and represents the practical application of Rivlin’s call to action in the “The Four Tribes Speech.” The photos in the exhibition are based on special narratives developed by Vibe Israel that showcase the uniqueness of Israeli society. Together, they provide an amazing kaleidoscope of different colors, backgrounds, traditions, and religions. The past, present, and future are fueled by cultural diversity and shared destiny. Israel is full of contrasts and its people, of all backgrounds and identities, are all part of the story!"
