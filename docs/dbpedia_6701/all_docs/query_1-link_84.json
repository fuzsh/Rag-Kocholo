        "text": "JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief opponent, Benny Gantz, agreed Monday to begin talks for a possible power-sharing deal after last week’s election left Israel in political gridlock.\n\nAfter meeting for more than two hours at the office of President Reuven Rivlin, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz issued a joint statement saying that they had “discussed ways to advance Israel’s unity” at Mr. Rivlin’s behest, and that their negotiating teams would meet on Tuesday.\n\n[Update: Netanyahu is chosen to form Israel’s next government.]\n\nBut serious obstacles remain, not least the question of who would serve first as prime minister under a possible agreement to rotate the premiership.\n\nMr. Rivlin, who has been calling for a unity government, called the meeting “ a significant step forward.”\n\n“The people expect you to find a solution and to prevent further elections, even if it comes at a personal and even ideological cost,” he admonished the two candidates, adding: “A shared and equal government is possible. It can and it must express the different voices in society.”\n\nHe invited Mr. Gantz and Mr. Netanyahu to meet again at his residence on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Rivlin’s role is largely ceremonial, but after last week’s inconclusive vote it is up to him to decide who will get the first crack at forming a government and becoming prime minister. For now he appears to have deferred that decision in the hope that the two men, whose parties won the most votes in the election, can work out a deal on their own.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
