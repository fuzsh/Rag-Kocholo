        "text": "Mr. Reuven (Ruvi) Rivlin is the 10th President of the State of Israel. Rivlin started his political career as a member of the Jerusalem City Council alongside various public positions, including a member of the board of El Al – Israel’s national airline, chairman of the Israel Institute for Occupational Safety and Hygiene, and a member of the board of both the Khan Theater and the Israel Museum. In 1988, Rivlin was elected to the Knesset as a member of the Likud party, and was a member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. In 2001, Rivlin was appointed as a Minister, and took over the Ministry of Communications. Later on, and before being elected as President, Rivlin served as Speaker of the Knesset and acted to protect the values ​​of democracy and preserve the rights of minority groups in Israel. Additionally, during his tenure as Israeli President, Rivlin strongly supported sustainability initiatives and fighting climate change. He also spoke out on setting achievable and clear targets for fighting global warming.\n\nDuring his seven years as the President of the State of Israel, Rivlin faced increasing division and tensions among the ethnic groups that make up Israeli society. In light of the challenging reality, Rivlin made sure to stand firm and constantly call for reconciliation, human brotherhood and Israeli unity, as he continuously stated throughout his tenure: “We are not doomed to live together, it is our destiny."
