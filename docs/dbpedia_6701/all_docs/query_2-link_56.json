We’re committed to unwavering commitment to your self-defense. And today, we’re going to be discussing a broad range of challenges, including Iran. What I can say to you, Iran will never get a nuclear weapon on my watch, as they say. And and, you know, they I directed last night’s airstrikes targeting sites used by the Iranian-backed militia group responsible for recent attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq.” “Israel have no greater friend, ally, than the United States of America. You are our best friends, and we are sharing — we are best friends, and the balance between the people of Israel and the people of America is based on the understanding that we are sharing values, values of democracy and values of liberalism. According to a real friendship, can, from time to time discuss matters, and even agree, not to agree about everything. But we continue with your declaration just now that we really want the Israelis to understand that we have a great friend in the White House.” “You do.”"
