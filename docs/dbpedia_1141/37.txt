Abstract

Collapsin response mediator protein 1 ( CRMP1) is one of the CRMP family members that mediates signal transduction of axon guidance molecules. Here, we show evidence that CRMP1 is involved in Reelin ( Reln) signaling to regulate neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex. In crmp1(-/-) mice, radial migration of cortical neurons was retarded. This phenotype was not observed in the sema3A(-/-) and crmp1(+/+); sema3A(+/+) cortices. However, CRMP1 was colocalized with disabled- 1 ( Dab1), an adaptor protein in Reln signaling. In the Reln(rl/rl) cortex, CRMP1 and Dab1 were expressed at a higher level, yet tyrosine phosphorylated at a lower level. Loss of crmp1 in a dab1 heterozygous background led to the disruption of hippocampal lamination, a Reeler- like phenotype. In addition to axon guidance, CRMP1 regulates neuronal migration by mediating Reln signaling.
