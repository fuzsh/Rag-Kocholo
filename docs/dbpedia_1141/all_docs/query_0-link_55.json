        "meta_description": "Previous studies have shown that chronic cocaine administration induces SIRT1, a Class III histone deacetylase, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, and that such induction influences the gene regulation and place conditioning effects of cocaine. To determine the mechanisms by which SIRT1 mediates cocaine-induced plasticity in NAc, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq), 1 d after 7 daily cocaine (20 mg/kg) or saline injections, to map SIRT1 binding genome-wide in mouse NAc. Our unbiased results revealed two modes of SIRT1 action. First, despite its induction in NAc, chronic cocaine causes depletion of SIRT1 from most affected gene promoters in concert with enrichment of H4K16ac (itself a deacetylation target of SIRT1), which is associated with increased expression of these genes. Second, we deduced the forkhead transcription factor (FOXO) family to be a downstream mechanism through which SIRT1 regulates cocaine action. We proceeded to demonstrate that SIRT1 induction causes the deacetylation and activation of FOXO3a in NAc, which leads to the induction of several known FOXO3a gene targets in other systems. Finally, we directly establish a role for FOXO3a in promoting cocaine-elicited behavioral responses by use of viral-mediated gene transfer: we show that overexpressing FOXO3a in NAc enhances cocaine place conditioning. The discovery of these two actions of SIRT1 in NAc in the context of behavioral adaptations to cocaine represents an important step forward in advancing our understanding of the molecular adaptations underlying cocaine action.",

        "text": "ChIP-seq reveals transcriptional targets of SIRT1 in NAc\n\nTo explore the mechanisms by which SIRT1 mediates cocaine-induced plasticity in NAc, we performed ChIP-seq for SIRT1 on NAc extracts from chronic cocaine- or saline-treated mice. We used a treatment regimen (7 daily injections, with animals analyzed 24 h later), which has been shown to induce robust changes in gene expression in the NAc (Renthal et al., 2009; Maze et al., 2010; Feng et al., 2014). After preprocessing, normalization, and identification of SIRT1 binding sites using MACs peak calling software (Zhang et al., 2008), statistical analysis of genomic regions that displayed cocaine-induced increases or decreases in SIRT1 binding (i.e., differential sites) was performed using diffReps (Shen et al., 2013), which uses a sliding window strategy to generate a high-resolution differential binding profile of SIRT1. These analyses provided a genome-wide map of downstream SIRT1 targets under control and drug-treated conditions.\n\nResults from the average of three independent replicate SIRT1 ChIP-seq experiments identified 53,676 peaks in NAc of saline-treated mice and 72,373 peaks in cocaine-treated mice (Fig. 1A). The larger number of significant SIRT1 peaks under cocaine conditions is consistent with the global increase in SIRT1 expression seen in NAc under these conditions (Ferguson et al., 2013). The genomic binding profile for saline and cocaine conditions was very similar, with ∼70% of binding occurring in gene desert and intergenic regions and the other ∼30% binding in promoter and gene body regions (Fig. 1A). Gene annotation mapping revealed a relatively even distribution of peaks across various genomic regions (i.e., gene deserts, gene promoters, gene bodies, and intergenic regions) in both saline and cocaine conditions (Fig. 1A). Molecular pathway analysis using Ingenuity software on genes that display significant SIRT1 binding (Fig. 1B) revealed that many SIRT1 target genes are significantly (using Fisher's exact test) associated with signaling pathways previously linked to cocaine action (Robison and Nestler, 2011), for example, pathways related to CREB signaling in neurons (−log p value saline = 6.1 cocaine = 5.541), synaptic long-term potentiation (−log p value saline = 5.7 cocaine = 5.9), synaptic long-term depression (−log p value saline = 5.1 cocaine = 7.34), glutamatergic signaling (−log p value saline = 4.3 cocaine = 7.1), and ERK/MAPK signaling (−log p value saline = 4.2 cocaine = 2.0).\n\nWe observed a decrease in SIRT1 binding in NAc after chronic cocaine across gene regions genome-wide and particularly at the TSSs of genes. This reduction was surprising in light of the increased global levels of SIRT1 in NAc after cocaine treatment (Ferguson et al., 2013). First, MACs-based peak distribution analysis indicated that chronic cocaine induced a small decrease in the fraction of peaks that occur at or near gene-coding regions, from 34% in saline mice to 29.5% in cocaine mice (Fig. 1A). Additionally, plotting SIRT1 binding across all gene regions genome-wide, by use of ngs.plot (Shen et al., 2014), indicated that chronic cocaine causes a depletion of SIRT1 across entire gene regions compared with saline conditions (Fig. 2A, top). A differential site heatmap of SIRT1 binding after cocaine further supports the observed SIRT1 depletion and illustrates that this depletion is particularly dramatic around TSS regions after cocaine treatment (Fig. 2A, bottom). The differential site analysis of all genes that displayed altered SIRT1 binding after exposure to cocaine revealed that ∼84% of these genes showed a decrease in SIRT1 binding: 3620 showed decreased SIRT1 binding versus 781 that showed increased binding (Fig. 2B), supporting the relative depletion of SIRT1 from genic regions (Fig. 2A). A complete list of genes that show cocaine-induced changes in SIRT1 binding is available online (http://neuroscience.mssm.edu/nestler/nidappg/nacchroniccocaine.html). Genome-wide, diffReps analysis identified a total of 11,196 differential SIRT1 sites in NAc between saline- and cocaine-treated animals; 8949 were downregulated, whereas only 2245 were upregulated (Fig. 2B). Approximately 55% of these sites were present in intergenic and gene desert regions and the other 45% were present in promoter and gene body regions of the genome (Fig. 2B).\n\nTo test whether SIRT1 acts primarily as a transcriptional repressor in NAc in vivo, as observed in peripheral tissues and cultured cells (Luo et al., 2001), we mapped SIRT1 binding to genes based on their levels of mRNA expression using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data (Feng et al., 2014) derived from NAc, with genes grouped by their levels of mRNA expression: low, medium, and high. We observed dramatically higher levels of SIRT1 binding to genes that are expressed at low levels (Fig. 3A), a finding seen in NAc of both saline- and cocaine-treated mice. Among genes that show cocaine-induced depletion of SIRT1 binding in concert with increased mRNA levels is Bdnf. Indeed, independent quantitative qPCR and qChIP analysis of Bdnf in NAc of saline- and chronic cocaine-treated mice validated the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq results (Bdnf mRNA levels: 1.25 ± 0.10 relative to control; SIRT1 binding at Bdnf: 0.75 ± 0.13 relative to control; p < 0.05). Such findings are of particular note because of the well-known role of BDNF in NAc in regulating cocaine action (Lobo et al., 2010), and a recent study showing that SIRT1 indirectly regulates BDNF levels in hippocampus (Gao et al., 2010). Molecular pathway analysis of genes that display altered SIRT1 binding after cocaine, overlaid with those that show altered mRNA expression, reveals SIRT1 at the center of a major hub of biological regulation (Fig. 3B).\n\nOverall, our results suggest that exposure to chronic cocaine induces a more permissive environment for transcription via the displacement of SIRT1 from the promoter/gene body of numerous downstream gene targets. H4K16ac is a well-known, direct target of SIRT1 in other systems, whereby the deacetylation of H4K16 by SIRT1 contributes to SIRT1's repressive effects on gene expression (Vaquero et al., 2004, 2007; O'Hagan et al., 2008; Hajji et al., 2010; Peng et al., 2012; Neumayer and Nguyen, 2014; Noguchi et al., 2014). Consistent with this literature, we showed recently that overexpressing SIRT1 in NAc decreases total cellular levels of H4K16ac (Ferguson et al., 2013). We therefore examined how the genome-wide enrichment of H4K16ac in NAc correlates with SIRT1 enrichment. ChIP-seq revealed strong enrichment of H4K16ac in gene promoter regions in both saline and cocaine conditions, with ∼50% of peaks residing at promoters (Fig. 4A,B). Importantly, cocaine induced an increase in H4K16ac enrichment at gene body and promoter regions (TSSs), which complements the observed decrease in SIRT1 binding at these regions (Fig. 4C). To further explore the networks associated with genes that show both increased H4K16ac and decreased SIRT1 binding, we subjected this dataset (387 genes) to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Such evaluation of these 387 genes revealed significant enrichment in signaling pathways associated with gene expression (p = 1.74E-05), nervous system development and function (p = 4.28E-05), and behavior (p = 1.30E-04).\n\nFurther analysis of the ChIP-seq list of genes that show a corresponding increase in acH4K16 binding and decreased SIRT1 binding reveals several genes that have been previously shown to be regulated in the NAc by cocaine. Examples include the following: Mef2c (myocyte enhancer factor 2C) (Pulipparacharuvil et al., 2008; Host et al., 2011; Dietrich et al., 2012), Nlgn1 (neuroligin 1) (Tiruchinapalli et al., 2008), Kalrn (kalirin) (Ma et al., 2012), Ntrk2 (neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor, type 2) (Graham et al., 2009; Lobo et al., 2010), and Grip1 (glutamate receptor interacting protein 1) (Briand et al., 2014), among others. As well, we observed cocaine regulation of several additional neural genes that control synaptic function in other systems and might contribute to cocaine-induced behavioral and synaptic plasticity, such as Nlgn2 (neuroligin 2) (van der Kooij et al., 2014), Synpo (synaptopodin) (Korkotian et al., 2014), Neurl1 (neuralized ligase) (Timmusk et al., 2002), Nedd4l (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 4-like, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) (Ekberg et al., 2014), Striatin (a calmodulin binding protein (Chen et al., 2012), Ncam2 (neural cell adhesion molecule 2) (Bajor et al., 2012), Kif13b (kinesin family member 13B) (Yoshimura et al., 2010), Nf1 (neurofibromin 1) (Oliveira and Yasuda, 2014), Shank2 (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 2) (Schneider et al., 2014), Wasl (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome-like) (Wegner et al., 2008), Kif1a (kinesin family member 1A) (Lee et al., 2015), Kif5c (kinesin family member 5C) (Willemsen et al., 2014), Contactin 6 (a neural adhesion molecule) (Mercati et al., 2013), and Negr1 (neuronal growth regulator 1) (Pischedda et al., 2014). Also represented on the list of H4K16ac/SIRT1-affected genes were several whose products regulate chromatin, including Mll2 (an H3K4 methyltransferase), Kdm5b (an H3K4 demethylase), Prmt3 (a protein arginine methyltransferase), Atf7 (activating transcription factor 7), and Med27 (mediator complex subunit 27).\n\nGiven the fact that SIRT1 does not possess any intrinsic sequence-specific DNA-binding domains and is thought to be recruited to genomic regions through interactions with DNA-binding proteins, we speculated that SIRT1 might interact with transcription factors or related proteins to regulate gene expression in NAc. Therefore, we performed a de novo motif analysis of SIRT1-bound sequences within 3 kb of the TSSs from saline and cocaine conditions and compared these results to known transcription factor motifs. Of the 10 most significant SIRT1-associated motifs in NAc of either saline- or cocaine-treated mice, 30% corresponded to consensus binding sites for the FOXO family of transcriptions factors (motif: AAGTAAACA) (Fig. 5), which play important roles in numerous cellular functions (Brunet et al., 2004) but have not to date been studied in addiction models.\n\nSIRT1 regulates the FOXO3a signaling pathway in NAc\n\nBased on this motif analysis, we explored interactions between SIRT1 and FOXO proteins in NAc, focusing on FOXO3a, because it is the predominant family member expressed throughout the brain (Hoekman et al., 2006) and because several prior studies have demonstrated SIRT1-FOXO3a interactions in other systems (Tissenbaum and Guarente, 2001; Patterson, 2003; Brunet et al., 2004; Motta et al., 2004). First, we found that FOXO3a is a downstream target of SIRT1 in NAc: immunoprecipitation of total acetylated proteins followed by immunoblotting for FOXO3a revealed a significant decrease in acetyl-FOXO3a in NAc overexpressing SIRT1 (Fig. 6A). Because such deacetylation of FOXO3a would increase its transcriptional activity (Nemoto et al., 2004), we performed qPCR on two established targets of FOXO3a in other systems, Gadd45α (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein-45a) and Cdkn1b (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; also known as p27Kip1) (Nemoto et al., 2004), and observed a significant increase in expression of both targets in NAc overexpressing SIRT1 (Fig. 6B). Second, although chronic cocaine administration had no effect on FOXO3a mRNA levels in NAc (data not shown), we observed increased levels of FOXO3a protein in nuclear fractions of NAc after chronic cocaine, with no change observed in cytosolic fractions (Fig. 6C). Third, we demonstrated that chronic cocaine increased expression levels of both FOXO3a targets, Gadd45α and Cdkn1b, in NAc (Fig. 6E). These results support a scheme wherein cocaine activates the FOXO3a signaling pathway in NAc via the induction of SIRT1 and consequent deacetylation of FOXO3a, leading to FOXO3a's activation and transcriptional activation of downstream target genes. Note that, via this mechanism, induction of SIRT1 leads to the induction, not repression, of a set of genes through indirect activation of FOXO3a.\n\nTo provide further evidence for this scheme, we assessed whether chronic cocaine alters FOXO3a binding to the promoter regions of the Gadd45α and Cdkn1b genes as well as to several other genes inferred as FOXO3a targets from our motif analysis. As shown in Figure 7, Gadd45α and Cdkn1b, as well as most of the other investigated genes, showed cocaine-induced increases both in FOXO3a binding to their promoter regions (Figure 7A) and in mRNA expression levels (Figure 7B) in NAc. The other genes that displayed such regulation include Ddb1 (damage-specific DNA binding protein 1), Npy (neuropeptide Y), and G6pc (glucose 6-phosphatase). Interestingly, another inferred target, Fasl (Fas ligand), a known target of FOXO3a in other systems, did not show cocaine induction of FOXO3a to its gene promoter; rather, its mRNA expression was suppressed in NAc in response to chronic cocaine administration. We showed further that HSV-mediated overexpression of FOXO3a in NAc increased the expression of Npy and Fasl without influencing the other genes analyzed, compared with HSV-GFP injected control animals (Fig. 8A,B). Overexpressing a constitutively active mutant of FOXO3a (FOXO3a-TM) exerted equivalent effects, whereas expressing a dominant negative mutant of FOXO3a (FOXO3a-DM) had no effect. The fact that FOXO3a overexpression per se is not sufficient to mimic cocaine induction of Ddbl1, G6pc, Gadd45a, and Cdkn1b, but could induce Fasl, which is not induced by cocaine, indicates that other cocaine-induced factors are required, in concert with FOXO3a activation, to control the expression of these various genes in the NAc.\n\nIn any event, our data implicate FOXO3a in the transcriptional effects that cocaine exerts in NAc. To directly test the relevance of FOXO3a and its transcriptional actions in cocaine-related behaviors, we used HSV vectors to overexpress wild-type FOXO3a, FOXO3a-TM, or FOXO3a-DM in the mouse NAc and assessed cocaine CPP (Fig. 8C). We observed a dramatic increase in CPP scores to a subthreshold dose of cocaine in mice overexpressing FOXO3a or FOXO3a-TM relative to a GFP control vector (F(3,31) = 6.94, p = 0.001). In contrast, overexpression of FOXO3a-DM trended to decrease the small preference seen under control conditions. These data demonstrate that FOXO3a activity in NAc promotes rewarding responses to cocaine."
