        "text": "Useful For\n\nSuggests clinical disorders or settings where the test may be helpful\n\nEvaluation of neurological autoimmunity particularly that associated with small-cell lung carcinoma and thymoma\n\nReporting an end titer result from serum specimens\n\nTesting Algorithm\n\nDelineates situations when tests are added to the initial order. This includes reflex and additional tests.\n\nIf the indirect immunofluorescence pattern suggests collapsin response-mediator protein-5 (CRMP-5) neuronal IgG, then this test will be performed at an additional charge.\n\nClinical Information\n\nDiscusses physiology, pathophysiology, and general clinical aspects, as they relate to a laboratory test\n\nAutoantibodies specific for neurons, glia, and muscle are important serological markers of neurological autoimmunity. Most are highly predictive of specific neoplasms that are metastatic to regional lymph nodes when diagnosed, but usually limited in spread.(1,2) The target autoantigens identified so far include cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins and plasma membrane cation channels.(3)\n\nCollapsin response-mediator protein-5 (CRMP-5)-IgG is currently the second most common autoantibody predictive of small-cell lung carcinoma and, sometimes, occurs with thymoma.\n\nThe neurological presentation of CRMP-5-IgG seropositive patients is usually multifocal and can affect any level of the neuraxis. The presentation frequently mimics a stroke or multiple sclerosis. Syndromic manifestations encountered with lung carcinoma include subacute chorea, blindness, other cranial neuropathies (particularly loss of taste or smell), gastrointestinal dysmotility, myelopathy, and radiculoplexopathy. Fourteen percent of patients have thromboembolic phenomena. Seropositive patients who have thymoma (6%) usually present with neurological manifestations other than, or including, myasthenia gravis (eg, encephalopathy, disorders of continuous muscle fiber activity).\n\nReference Values\n\nDescribes reference intervals and additional information for interpretation of test results. May include intervals based on age and sex when appropriate. Intervals are Mayo-derived, unless otherwise designated. If an interpretive report is provided, the reference value field will state this.\n\nOnly orderable as a reflex.

CRMP-5 Western blot analysis will be done on request on stored serum (held 4 weeks). This supplemental testing is recommended in cases of chorea, vision loss, cranial neuropathy, and myelopathy. Call 1-800-533-1710 to request CRMP-5 Western blot.\n\nNeuron-restricted patterns of IgG staining that do not fulfill criteria for CRMP-5-IgG may be reported as \"unclassified antineuronal IgG.\" Complex patterns that include non-neuronal elements may be reported as \"uninterpretable.\"\n\nInterpretation\n\nProvides information to assist in interpretation of the test results\n\nDetection of IgG autoantibody specific for the neuronal cytoplasmic antigen collapsin response-mediator protein-5 (CRMP-5) in a patient's serum or spinal fluid confirms that the patient's subacute neurological disorder has an autoimmune basis and predicts a small-cell lung carcinoma or thymoma with 75% to 80% certainty.(1)\n\nCRMP-5-IgG titers generally fall after the neoplasm is treated, and a rising titer is indicative of tumor persistence or recurrence.\n\nCautions\n\nDiscusses conditions that may cause diagnostic confusion, including improper specimen collection and handling, inappropriate test selection, and interfering substances\n\nSeronegativity does not exclude the presence of a neoplasm.\n\nTesting for a single paraneoplastic autoantibody is not a sufficient screening test for neurological autoimmunity.\n\nCollapsin response-mediator protein-5 (CRMP-5)-IgG is not detectable by immunofluorescence screening if the serum titer is low (<1:120) or if coexisting autoantibodies (either neuron-specific or nonorgan-specific such as antinuclear and antimitochondrial antibodies) are present, which precludes identification of CRMP-5-IgG with certainty. Interfering antibodies can usually be eliminated by absorption with liver antigens. Western blot analysis using full length recombinant human CRMP-5 protein can detect CRMP-5-IgG at 1:30 dilution.\n\nAn autoantibody independently named anti-CV2 is the same entity as CRMP-5-IgG. Its antigen in adult brain was erroneously reported to be oligodendrocyte-restricted and was misidentified in 1999 as CRMP-3.\n\nClinical Reference\n\nRecommendations for in-depth reading of a clinical nature\n\n1.
