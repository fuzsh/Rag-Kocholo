        "text": "During development, immature neurons elongate their axons through a complex tissue structure to reach their appropriate synaptic partners located millimetres or even centimetres away. Diverse cellular and molecular mechanisms are adopted by embryos to guide the axons to their targets [66]. ECM molecules play a crucial role during this process through the involvement of either the ECM molecules or ECM-binding molecules [67]. CSs interact and cooperate with extracellular signalling proteins and receptors to modulate the axonal outgrowth. Removal of CSs by injection of chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) results in abnormal axonal outgrowth in zebrafish and rat embryos [68, 69] and disruption of retinal axons in mouse embryos [70]. Otherwise, CNS development and CNS injury share certain neural mechanisms including neural outgrowth, guidance and plasticity. Indeed, after CNS injury, the same molecules involved in development are up-regulated again, including CSPGs [71]. They form a chemical barrier, which inhibits axonal projection and regeneration [72]. Enzymatic removal of CSs using ChABC promotes functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) in adult rats [73, 74].\n\nECM in the CNS is a rich source of signalling molecules involved in different mechanisms of proliferation, differentiation, survival and migration of neurons. Activities and interactions of CSPGs with signalling molecules in ECM depend on many parameters: the core protein, the attached CS chains, their length, the degree and position of sulfates [75]. Composition of CSPGs varies in stages of development and physiological state, and this enables a large families of molecules, as described below, to interact with CSPGs via CSs chains to accomplish their functions (Fig. 3). The degree and position of sulfation on the CS chains confer different specific binding sites to various soluble factors in the ECM. Previous studies have reported an upregulation of CS-E unit and also chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase, an enzyme synthesising CS-C, after spinal cord injury [76, 77]. In the PNNs, CS-E are responsible for the binding of negative guidance molecule semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) and Otx2 [55, 57, 78, 79]. Recently, there are also studies describing the potential involvement of CS-C in epilepsy [80, 81]. These interactions lead to selective activation or inhibition of various signalling pathways. Here, we describe a families of proteins binding to CSs chain of CSPG to modulate the axonal outgrowth and guidance.\n\ni)\n\nGrowth factors (GFs)\n\nGFs are biomolecules which support proliferation, growth, migration and differentiation [82–84]. In addition, they are involved in regulating metabolism, tissue repair and maintaining tissue homeostasis in adult organisms [85]. Some members exist ubiquitously in all tissues but some are expressed in a tissue-specific manner [86, 87]. GFs are usually secreted by neighbouring cells or at nerve terminals into the ECM and act locally due to their short life [88]. The secreted GFs bind to specific receptors on the surface of target cells and induce intracellular signalling pathway. Proteoglycans in the ECM bind to the GFs, facilitate the access and presentation of GFs to the receptor for subsequent signalling pathways [89]. During CNS development, many growth factors are shown to interact with CS chains, which we shall discuss below.\n\nNeurotrophic factors\n\nare the family of GFs that promote survival, growth and differentiation of neuronal cells [90, 91]. Different neurotrophic factors, such as fibroblast growth factor, has been postulated to interact with heparin to promote the neurite outgrowth, hence their name “heparin-binding proteins” [92]. Interaction of neurotrophic factors with heparin/HS has attracted much attention similar to the involvement of HS in development [93]. However, these last decades more interest has been diverted to CSs notably in the CNS [94]. Here we describe heparin-binding proteins which interact with CSs in CNS.\n\nFibroblast growth factors\n\n(FGFs) are a large family of proteins, which exert a pleiotropic effects in different tissues. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or FGF 2 is a multi-functional growth factor including its effect on survival of neurons and stimulate neurite extension [95]. It has been shown that bFGF binding to HS-, Hp-, or HA-bound surfaces stimulates neurite outgrowth from hippocampal neurons while the binding to CS- or DS-surfaces does not lead to the same observation [96]. On the other hand, Karumbaiah et al. has reported the potential of CS-A hydrogel enriched in bFGF in creating an endogenous niche for neural stem cells [97]. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis shows that CS-A from bovine trachea binds with high affinity to bFGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and interleukin 10 [97]. Screening of different GFs including FGF-2, −10, −16, −18 and Hp-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) against CS-E using filter binding assay, resonance mirror biosensor IAsys and GAG microarrays showed that these GFs bind to the CS-E from squid cartilage in a dose-dependent manner [64, 65]. FGF-16, FGF-18, and HB-EGF binds to CS-E (Kd ≈ 47.2, 8.9 and 16 nM, respectively) in a comparable affinity to the binding to Hp (Kd ≈ 34.7, 10.8 and 4.7 nM, respectively), while the affinity of FGF-2 and FGF-10 toward CS-E was lower than Hp [64, 65]. Screening of these GFs with oversulfated CS/DS hybrid chain purified from hagfish (CS-H) showed no binding by SPR, suggesting that the binding of the GFs to CS-E is a specific interaction but not due to non-specific charge interaction [98]. The binding of CS to FGF2 is important for the formation of neural spheres, proliferation and self-renewal of neural stem cells through the FGF2/MAPK pathway [99]. Removal of CSs using ChABC reduces neuronal proliferation and differentiation, and on the contrary, it increases the proliferation of astrocytes [100].\n\nMidkine and pleiotrophin\n\nare two basic heparin-binding proteins localized in the radial glial fibres in embryonic brain, along which neural stem cells migrate [101]. They mediate neuronal cell adhesion and migration, and promote neurite outgrowth by interacting with cell surface heparin during development [102, 103]. It has been shown that CS-C inhibits the binding of pleiotrophin to its receptor 6B4 Proteoglycan/Phosphacan, which is an extracellular variant of receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) ζ/RPTP β (this receptor family will be discussed in the next section), in rat brain. The binding of CS-C reduces pleiotrophin-induced neuronal migration along radial glial fibres. It has been postulated that CS and a portion of RPTPζ/RPTPβ could constitute the binding site of pleiotrophin [104, 105]. Similarly, Ueoka et al. have also shown that the adhesion of embryonic cortical neurons to midkine in culture is specifically inhibited by CS-E [106]. The interaction of midkine to CS-E is as strong as the binding to Hp [106]. The specific and direct interaction between CS-E/CS-H and midkine/pleiotrophin has also been shown by filter binding assay, IAsys and SPR [64, 98, 107]. Midkine and pleiotrophin are involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Deposition of midkine and pleiotrophin has been observed in the pathological senile plaque and/or neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s brain [102, 108]. LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) is a receptor of midkine and pleiotrophin and it is genetically linked to Alzheimer’s disease [102]. CS-Midkine/pleiotrophin interaction could be a potential target to treat these diseases. Thus, further understanding of this interaction should be performed. These findings suggest that CSs could be a binding partner or co-receptor for neurotrophic factors in the central nervous system.\n\nii)\n\nReceptors\n\nReceptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs)\n\nare a family of receptor-enzymes that remove phosphate from tyrosine in a protein. RPTPs are commonly found on growth cones [109] and are involved in the control of axon growth, guidance, regeneration and plasticity during development as well as after injury [110–112]. Indeed, a deficit of O-mannosylated RPTP ζ contributes to congenital muscular dystrophies [113–115].\n\nMembers of class II A RPTP including RPTPσ, RPTPδ and LAR (leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase) bind with high affinity to CSPGs and HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) [116]. They are postulated to be the receptors of CSPG [117, 118]. RPTPσ knockout mice display a reduced CSPG inhibition after spinal cord injury and an enhanced regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury [112, 119]. Mimetic peptide of RPTPσ wedge domain releases CSPG-mediated axonal inhibition in vitro by binding to RPTPσ and improve the functional recovery after SCI [120]. Binding of CSPG to RPTPσ induces a dephosphorylation of tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), which leads to a down-regulation of dendritic spine formation [121]. TrkB is the BDNF receptor which, in contrast to CSPG, positively regulates the plasticity and spines formation in cortical neurons. Remarkably, binding of RPTPσ to CSPGs or HSPGs induces opposite effect on axonal growth. Cole et al. have shown that RPTPσ binding to HSPGs activates axonal growth while binding to CSPGs inhibits it [118]. The binding with CS chains inhibit the oligomerization of RPTPσ which are induced by HSPG [118].\n\nLAR is another CSPG receptor [122]. It has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that LAR interacts with CSPG directly. This interaction leads to an inactivation of Akt and an activation of RhoA, thus inhibiting axonal growth [122]. Moreover, LAR knockout mice or mice treated with LAR-targeting peptides show an improvement of locomotor function after SCI [122, 123]. PG-RPTPs interaction may be a potential therapeutic target for functional recovery after CNS injuries.\n\nNogo receptors NgR1 and NgR3\n\nbind to Nogo and induce neurite outgrowth inhibition [124]. It has recently been reported that apart from Nogo, they can also bind to CSPGs and act as CSPGs receptors [125]. Both NgR1 and NgR3 bind specifically to disulfated CS-B, CS-D and CS-E with high affinity. The binding of CSPG to NgR1 and NgR3 inhibit neurite outgrowth. Double knockout of NgR1 and 3 shows increased regeneration after injury, and this is further enhanced with additional ablation of RPTPσ [125].\n\niii)\n\nAdhesion molecules\n\nCell adhesion molecules (CAMs)\n\nare surface glycoproteins mediating cell-cell and cell-extracellular interaction. The established connections between cells are important for maintaining tissue integrity and for cell communications [126]. Moreover, CAMs are fundamental for cell migration, notably during development of the CNS [127] and after traumatic brain injury [128]. Neural-CAM (N-CAM) is an adhesion molecule specific to the CNS. It has been implicated in various neuronal mechanisms. Indeed, this molecule is required for motor neuron sprouting, having thus a beneficial role in recovery after SCI. NCAM−/− mice show a significantly reduced locomotor recovery comparing the WT after SCI [129, 130]. N-CAM and neuron-glia CAM (Ng-CAM) bind with high affinity (Kd ≈ 0.5 nM) to the CSPG phosphacan [131]. Treatment with ChABC only reduces this binding by ~15% suggesting that the binding is mostly due to an interaction with the phosphacan core protein. The interaction of phosphacan and N-CAM or Ng-CAM leads to an reduced neurite outgrowth and adhesion in vitro [131]. Neurocan, another CSPG in the CNS matrix, also binds to N-CAM and Ng-CAM, and inhibits the neurite outgrowth [132]. Unlike phosphacan, ChABC treatment of neurocan significantly reduces this binding suggesting the interaction is mainly mediated through the CS GAG chains [132]. These findings suggest that N-CAM and Ng-CAM could be the receptors for the two CSPGs phosphacan and neurocan.\n\nCAMs are also involved in other neuronal mechanisms in addition to neuronal migration. Contactin-1 is a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-linked membrane glycoprotein. It is a CAM and implicated in axonal growth, axonal and dendritic interactions of cerebellar interneurons and guidance [133]. With the use of SPR analysis, it has been shown that CS-E binds to contactin-1 with significant affinity (Kd ≈ 1.4 μM) and that this interaction is required for the neurogenesis mediated by CS-E [134].\n\niv)\n\nGuidance proteins\n\nGuidance of dendrites and axons to their appropriate targets is a critical process for building a functional CNS during development [135]. These guidance molecules come from different families of proteins including secreted or cell surface guidance molecules and they can be attractive or repulsive [136].\n\nSemaphorin\n\nis a large family of secreted and membrane-associated guidance molecules [137]. Initially being identified as repulsive guidance molecules, several studies in the last decades have reported a chemoattractive role of semaphorins [138–140]. Semaphorins guide the development of peripheral nerve projection and involved in synaptogenesis in the CNS [141, 142]. The persistence of their expression in adulthood suggests a role in the maintenance of pre-established connections and cerebral homeostasis [143].\n\nSemaphorin 3A (Sema 3A) is one of the most studied members in class III semaphorins, which are upregulated after CNS injuries [144]. Owing to its ability in inducing growth cone collapse, Sema 3A is also called collapsin-1 and is the first member being identified in the semaphorin family [138]. It is a secreted protein, signaling via neuropilin-1(Nrp-1) and plexin (Plxn) receptors located at synapses [145–147]. During development, Sema 3A is expressed in a gradient across the cortical layers. It acts as a chemoattractive protein to guide the radial migration of cortical neurons [148]. In adult CNS, Sema 3A is found in the PNNs [78]. It modulates synapse morphology and function [147]. ChABC digestion reduces Sema 3A staining on the PNNs, suggesting an interaction between Sema 3A and CSPG [78]. Further investigations have shown that Sema 3A interacts with CS-E with high affinity [57]. Moreover, Nrp-1 can be modified post-translationally by CS chains, and this modification affects its ability to one of its effector VEGF [149]. These studies suggest that CSPGs could be additional constituents in the Sema 3A–Nrp-Plxn signalling complex. Moreover, Sema 3A is one of the most potent inhibitors to neuronal sprouting after SCI. It inhibits the axonal sprouting induced by nerve growth factor after SCI [150]. Indeed, Sema 3A could be one of the mechanisms which CSPG modulates plasticity. Targeting Sema 3A or its interaction with CSs could be a strategy to improve the plasticity after CNS trauma.\n\nSemaphorin 5A (Sema 5A) is a membrane-associated semaphorin. Like other semaphorins, it is important in the development of the CNS [151]. Semaphorins class 5 is characterized by a specific domain containing two clusters of type-1 thrombospondin repeats (TSRs), which promote neurite outgrowth [152]. TSR displays a basic motif which can interact with the negative chain of HSPG and CSPG [153, 154]. Interestingly, the binding of Sema 5A to HSPG or CSPG triggers opposite responses. Sema 5A mediates neuronal attraction when it binds to HSPG and it becomes repulsive upon binding to CSPG [155]. This study indicates the proteoglycan-dependent function of Sema 5A.\n\nOther than Sema 3A and 5A, Conrad et al. have tried to identify other ECM proteins which interact with CNS GAGs to promote the growth and differentiation of embryonic sensory nerve fibres using SPR and microarrays. The results indicate a significant interaction between CS-A and various guidance molecules, including Sema 3E, Sema 6B, ephrin A3 and Robo 2 [156].\n\nCollapsin response mediator protein-4 (CRMP-4) is a 65 kDa phosphoprotein expressed in the CNS during development and in adulthood [157]. Dendrites extension of hippocampal neurons induced by Sema 3A is impaired in CRMP-4−/− hippocampal neurons, suggesting that CRMP-4 belongs to the Sema 3A signalling pathway which induces the growth cone collapse [158]. Moreover, CRMP-4 is identified as crucial protein that overcomes both axonal growth inhibition and scarring after SCI in adult mouse [158]. Interestingly, this intracellular protein interacts with CS. Indeed, CRMP-4 was purified using a CS affinity column [159, 160]. During early development in the CNS, active apoptosis which is essential for the normal development of CNS, causes the release of CRMP-4 into the extracellular space where it binds to CS [161, 162]. The downstream mechanism of the interaction between CRMP-4 and CS remains unknown but the above finding suggests an additional role of CNS ECM in sequestrating intracellular protein (s) released from apoptosis.\n\nOrthodenticle homeobox protein 2 (Otx2) is another intracellular protein found interacting with CS in the ECM. Otx2 is a non-cell-autonomous transcription factor involved in brain morphogenesis [163]. It has been shown to interact with CSs in postnatal development and control plasticity [79]. Indeed, the role of Otx2 in plasticity has been investigated in the visual system in mice during the critical period. During this period, Otx2 is transferred from choroid plexus into the visual cortex and accumulates on the PNN of PV-cells [164]. Otx2 accelerates PV-cells maturation and PNNs formation. In return, PNNs concentrate Otx2 into the surface of PV-cells to be internalized [55]. A positive feedback loop between Otx2 and PNNs, during critical period as well as in maintaining PNN in adulthood, has been proposed [165]. Considering the important role of Otx2 and PNNs in controlling plasticity, further experiments have been performed to characterize the binding site of Otx2 in PNNs. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments show that a specific basic sequence in Otx2, rich in arginine and lysine, interacts specifically and with high affinity with CS-E and CS-D, low affinity with CS-C and not with CS-A [55]. This finding indicates, once more, that the interaction CS-protein is sulfation pattern-dependent, not charge dependent.\n\nv)\n\nExtracellular matrix proteins\n\nA number of fibrillar and glyco- proteins are also key components of the neuronal ECM in addition to CSPGs. They consist mainly of elastins, collagens, laminins and fibronectins [166]. Despite their small proportion in CNS matrix comparing to CSPGs, these proteins impose significant influence on the growth cone of neurons and regeneration [167, 168]. An addition of laminin to neurons in culture results in a drastic acceleration of neurite outgrowth [168]. Similarly, fibronectin promotes the neurite outgrowth and axonal regeneration of adult brain neurons in vitro [169]. Collagen VI protects the brain from neurodegeneration in ageing [170]. CSPGs and fibrous proteins have a complementary functions. Both work on the maintenance of the ECM homeostasis and the surrounding neurons. An implantation of a collagen/chondroitin 6-sulfate (CS-C) hydrogel containing embryonic striatal neurons allows the reconstruction of matrix and glial repair after a lesion in rat striatum [171]. It is likely that CSPGs and fibrous proteins interact with each other to accomplish their function. Astrochondrin, a CSPG on astrocyte surface and is involved in cerebellar granule cell migration, has been shown to interact specifically with laminin and collagen but not with fibronectin. Implication of CS chain of astrochondrin in this interaction is demonstrated by analysis of the astrochondrin binding to collagen in the presence of soluble CS in a radioligand binding assay. Indeed, soluble CSs are able to compete with astrochondrin to bind to collagen [172]. Snow et al. have reported that laminin and fibronectin are responsible for the inhibition effect of CSPGs on the growth cone [173].\n\nPhotomedin is another brain ECM protein, interacting with CS, less known comparing to fibronectin and laminin because it is less abundant and its spatiotemporal expression is restricted [174]. Photomedin 1 and 2 are identified as novel members of the olfactomedin family (OLF) [174]. OLFs are glycoproteins expressed mainly in the ECM of olfactory neuroepithelium, while photomedins are expressed mainly in retina ECM. They contain a specific sequence in their C-terminal, called OLF domain which has crucial implications in many neuronal mechanisms, including axonal growth and differentiation of chemosensory cilia [175]. ELISA experiments have shown that photomedins bind to CS-E with high affinity [174]. This is yet another evidence that CS-E interacts with different growth factors involved in neuronal migration and axonal guidance. Taken together, it may suggest that photomedins and growth factors could compete to bind to CS-E. Photomedins are proposed as a reservoir of CS-E and facilitates the localized action of growth factors [174].\n\nvi)\n\nPathological protein\n\nAmyloid precursor protein (APP) is a transmembrane glycoprotein. APP undergoes a proteolytic processes giving rise to various peptides. Some of the resulting peptides are involved in neuronal plasticity and neurogenesis, but some of the others are pathological like amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) [176]. Indeed, Aβ is neurotoxic and found accumulated in neurons suffering from Alzheimer’s disease [177]. HSs and CSs have been reported to enhance the Aβ aggregation and the sulfate moieties on GAGs are the crucial key for this aggregation [178]. Recent study has reported that an overexpression of heparanase decreases the amyloid burden in vivo [179], and that PNN neurons resist neurotoxicity from Aβ and oxidative stress suggesting the neuroprotective role of PNNs [180, 181]. Otherwise, an interaction of APP and PG enhances the neurite outgrowth [182]. The direct interaction of CSPGs and APP has been demonstrated using solid phase binding assay. ChABC digestion of CS reduces the binding by 79%, this confirms the binding is through CS GAG chains [182]."
