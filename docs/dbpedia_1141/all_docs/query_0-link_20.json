        "text": "ABSTRACT\n\nObjective Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a large category disorder urging antibody characterization. The aim was to identify a novel AE related autoantibody targeting an intracellular synaptic protein.\n\nMethods Suspected AE patients had negative conventional antibodies screening but strong immunolabel signals on rat brain sections with the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were considered burdening unkown antibody. Immunoprecipitation from the rat brain protein lysate followed by mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify the targeting antigen. Western blotting and/or cell-based assay (CBA) with antigen-overexpressing HEK293T cells were used for antibody specificity, epitope and IgG subtype determination. Patients with similar immunostaining pattern on rat brain sections were retrospectively screened for the antibody.\n\nResults The antibody against collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), a synaptic protein involved in axon guidance, was identified in a patient with suspected AE. The patient samples reactivated with HEK293T cell overexpressed CRMP2, rather than CRMP1, 3, 4, and 5. The patient samples mainly stained neuronal cytoplasm of the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum Purkinje cells. This reactivity was eliminated by pre-immunoabsorption with CRMP2-overexpressing HEK293T cells. CRMP2 truncation experiments indicated that 536 amino acids at C-terminus was necessary for the epitope. Subtype analysis showed that anti-CRMP2 antibody was IgG4. Moreover, screening from 19 suspected AE patients led to identification of anti-CRMP2 antibody in another patient with a diagnosis of encephalomyelitis. The two patients responded to immunotherapy.\n\nConclusions This study discovered a novel anti-CRMP2 antibody associated with AE. Testing of the antibody might be promising for AE diagnosis and treatment.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAutoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a large category of inflammatory disorders mediated by immune responses against neuronal intracellular antigens, cell-surface or synaptic antigens, in some cases, accompanied by neoplasia. Intracellular antigens include Hu (anti-neuronal nuclear antibody type 1, ANNA1), Ri (ANNA2), and Ma2 in the nucleus, Yo (Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type 1, PCA1), amphiphysin, glutamate decarboxylase 65 kDa isoform (GAD65), and Kelch-like Protein 11 in the cytosol, which cause T cell mediated immune response and some cases respond to immunotherapy 1-4. Most AE caused by autoantibodies against antigens on the neuronal surface or synaptic proteins, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), leucine-rich gliomainactivated 1 (LGI1), contactin-associated protein 2 (Caspr2), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (A/B), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors, dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein-6 (DPPX), delta/notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER), dopamine-2 receptor (D2R), metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), voltage-gated calcium channel salpha-2/delta subunit (CaVα2δ), and glutamate kainate receptor subunit 2 (GluK2), respond well to immunotherapy1, 5-9. Thus, intensive testing of these antibodies in suspected AE patients plays an important role in guiding the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Despite this, the cause of many cases of AE remains unexplained because of limited known antibodies10-12. Searching for additional antibodies has been desperately needed.\n\nFamily of collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) consists five homologous members, CRMP1-5, which are cytosolic microtubule-associated phosphoproteins and play important roles in dendrite and axonal guidance, regulating migration and synaptic dynamics 13. Structurally, CRMP1-4 share 69-76% amino acids (aa) identity, while they share less identity to CRMP5, approximately 50% 14. Antibodies against CRMPs except CRMP2 have been reported in several encephalitis. Previously, eight cases of anti-CV2/CRMP5 sera from patients with autoimmune myelopathy were detected anti-CRMP3 antibody positive, and one of them also had anti-CRMP1 antibody, one had anti-CRMP1, 4 antibodies14-15. Antibodies to CRMP3-4 were found in a case with subacute limbic encephalitis and thymoma16.\n\nCRMPs antibodies also have been found in other disorders. Anti-CRMP1/2 antibodies are found in autoimmune retinopathy patients17. Antibodies to CRMP1/2 in maternal sera increased the occurrence of autism spectrum disorders in children18. Presence of antibodies to CRMP2 and/or GFAP in the acute phase of spinal cord injury increased the occurrence of neuropathic pain six months later 19. Here, we found CRMP2 as the specific autoantigen in a patient with intracranial Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M.P.) infection and possible secondary immune-mediated encephalitis.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nPatients and autoantibody testing\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Nanfang hospital, the Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China (No. NFEC-2021-001). All patients or their families signed the informed consents.\n\nPatients with suspected autoimmune encephalitis were hospitalized in our Neurology department between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020. Patients’ sera or CSF samples were screened for known autoantibodies, including anti-NMDAR, LGI1, Caspr2, GABABR, AMPAA/BR, DPPX, DNER, D2R, mGluR5, GAD65 and IgLON5 antibodies by cell-based assay (CBA), some patients tested anti-Hu, Yo, Ri, Ma2, PCA2, amphiphysin, and CRMP5 antibodies by blot assay according to reference1. The negative samples were further analyzed by tissue-based assay (TBA) of immunostaining on rat brain sections. CBA negative and TBA positive samples were considered with unknown antibodies and applied to antibody discovery process.\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC)\n\n5μm thick frozen tissue sections from the brain of adult SD rat or C57BL/6 mouse were prepared and performed IHC (or TBA) with CSF, sera, and secondary antibodies as previously reported20. Dilutions were used as CSF, 1:1, sera, 1:200, HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (bs-0297G-HRP, Bioss, Beijing, China), 1:3000, DyLight 488-labeled goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody (ab97003, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), 1:200. Immunostaining images were photographed under DM3000 microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) or LSM980 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For the absorption assay, the serum diluted 1:200 was pre-immunoabsorbed six times by incubated with acetone fixed CRMP2-overexpressing HEK293T cells for 1 hour at 37□ as reported6.\n\nWestern blotting, immunoprecipitation (IP) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)\n\nFresh whole brain protein lysate of adult SD rats and Western blotting were conducted as reported 20. The lysis buffer (20 mmol/l Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmol/l, 1% TritonX-100, 2 mmol/l EDTA, 5% glyserol, 1 mmol/l PMSF) was used. The protein lysate was mixed with the patient’s CSF at 4□ overnight, followed by adding protein A agarose beads and incubation for another 2 hours. The beads were washed and collected by centrifugation, then boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The antibody-protein complexes pulled down were separated by 10% SDS gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting or stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. Correlated band compared with Western blotting results from the gels was cut and sent for protein identification using LC-MS/MS analysis by Fitgene Biotech Ltd. (Guangzhou, China).\n\nCell culture and immunofluorescence (IF)\n\nPrimary cortical neurons were prepared from 18 to 19 days C57BL/6 mouse fetuses and cultured for 14 days as reported 21. Ice acetone fixed neurons were blocked with 10% goat serum at 37°C for 30 minutes and incubated with patient’ serum (1:200), rabbit anti-MAP2 antibody (1:200, 8707T, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) or rabbit anti-CRMP2 antibody (1:200, ab129082, Abcam) at 4°C overnight. DyLight 488-labeled goat anti-human IgG and Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (ab150092, Abcam) secondary antibodies (1:200) were used and fluorescence images were photographed under LSM980 confocal microscope (Zeiss).\n\nHEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids pcDNA3.1-CRMP1/2/3/4-Flag, pcDNA3.1-CRMP5-eGFP, pcDNA3.1-CRMP2 T1 (1-141 amino acids of isoform 1) / T2 (1-36 amino acids of isoform 2)-eGFP, and pcDNA3.1-CRMP2 T3 (142-677 amino acids of isoform 1)-Flag separately for 48 hours. Protein coding sequences in the plasmids referred to mRNA of CRMP1: NM_001014809.3, CRMP2 (isoform 1): NM_001197293.3, CRMP2 (isoform 2): NM_001386.6, CRMP2 (isoform 3): NM_001244604.2, CRMP3: NM_006426.3, CRMP4: NM_001197294.2, and CRMP5: NM_020134.4. Full length isoform 1 of CRMP2 was used unless illustrated. Transfected cells were fixed with ice acetone for 10 minutes, washed with PBST, and blocked with 10% goat serum, then incubated with patient’s serum or rabbit anti-CRMP2 antibody (1:200) overnight at 4°C. After wash, the appropriate secondary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, including DyLight 488-labeled goat anti-human IgG, DyLight 550-labeled goat anti-human IgG (ab96908, Abcam), FITC-labeled anti-human IgG1/2/3/4 (F0767/F4516/F4641/F9890, Sigma-Aldrich) and/or Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:200). The fluorescence images were taken by using LSM980 confocal microscope (Zeiss) or IX73 inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nRESULTS\n\nIdentification of an autoantibody specific targeting CRMP2 in a patient with suspected AE\n\nThe index patient (P1) was diagnosed as intracranial M.P. infection and possible secondary immune-mediated encephalitis. The known autoantibodies tests were negative. However, IHC of P1’s serum showed positive staining across the brain (Figure 1A). Immunofluorescence assay revealed neuronal staining in cortex, hippocampus, and especially Purkinje cells of cerebellum (Figure 1B). Further analysis of P1’s serum showed reaction with the cytosol compartments of cultured cortical neurons (Figure 1C).\n\nWestern blotting after IP revealed a band around 70 kDa, which was pulled down by P1’s CSF from rat brain protein lysate (Figure 1D). The correlated visible band from the Coomassie brilliant blue staining gel (Figure 1E) was elucidated and CRMP2 was identified as the possible target antigen by mass spectrometry (Figure 1F, Table S1 in the supplement).\n\nVerification of the anti-CRMP2 antibody in suspected AE patients\n\nNext, we confirmed that both P1’s serum and commercial anti-CRMP2 antibody detected a band near 70 kDa from the pulled-down protein complex by the P1’s serum from rat brain protein lysate (Figure 2A). With the CRMP2-overexpressing HEK293T cells, CRMP2 were pulled down by commercial anti-CRMP2 antibody and were recognized by P1’s serum (Figure 2B). There are three isoforms of CRMP2, isoform 1 (677 amino acids, 74kDa), isoform 2 (572 amino acids, 62kDa), and isoform 3 (536 amino acids, 58kDa), attribute to three transcript variants, and the observed molecular weight of CRMP2 bands in Western blotting might vary or be higher because of post-translational modification. Here we used the human full-length isoform 1 CRMP2 for further tests unless illustrated.\n\nAnti-CRMP2 antibody and P1’s serum immunostained the overexpressed CRMP2 in HEK293T cells and had well co-localization (Figure 2C). As expected, immunostaining of cultured neurons with P1’s serum also co-localized with anti-CRMP2 antibody signals (Figure 2D). When P1’s serum was pre-immunoabsorbed with the CRMP2-overexpressing HEK293T cells to rule out anti-CRMP2 antibody, a negative immunoreaction was found on the mouse brain section. It indicates that no other neuronal antibodies presented (Figure 1B).\n\nFurther, 19 suspected AE patients with negative known antibodies testing but similar immunostaining on rat brain sections were screened for anti-CRMP2 antibody by the CBA method. As indicated in Figure 2C, another patient, P2, was found having immunoreaction with CRMP2 in the serum. Moreover, the immunoreaction was disappeared in P2’s serum collected when the patient recovered completely and was reevaluated 1.5 years later. All the data verify that anti-CRMP2 antibody present in certain AE patients.\n\nThe antibody is IgG4 and specific to the C-terminus of CRMP2\n\nSince CRMP2 belongs to the highly conserved CRMPs family now with five members (Figure 3A), we further determined whether the antibodies in our patients are specific to CRMP2. Expression plasmids were constructed to express full-length CRMP1-5. P1’ and P2’ sera showed immunoreaction only in the HEK293T cells expression of CRMP2, rather than other CRMPs (Figure 3B).\n\nTo further determine which part of CRMP2 responsible for the antigen-antibody reaction, three expression plasmids (T1-3) carrying truncated CRMP2 were constructed as schematically indicated and applied to CBA assay (Figure 3C). T1 contained 141 amino acids N-terminus of isoform 1, T2, 36 N-terminus of isoform 2, and T3, 536 C-terminus which shared by three CRMP2 isoforms. The results indicate that the 536 aa C-terminus of CRMP2 is necessary for the immunoreaction (Figure 3D).\n\nWe also checked the IgG subtype of anti-CRMP2 antibody in the patients. As shown in Figure 3E, only IgG4 mediated anti-CRMP2 immunoreaction. Same results obtained with P2’s serum (data not shown). The results suggest that anti-CRMP2 IgG4 recognize the C-terminus of CRMP2 in our AE patients.\n\nClinical features of the two patients with anti-CRMP2 antibody\n\nP1 patient, a young adult female, was admitted due to persistent dizziness, visual rotation, recurrent nausea and vomiting and fever for 8 days, and unstable walking and blurred speech for one day. Fever was mild and the highest body temperature was 38.5L. Physical examinations revealed signs of cerebellum including poetry-like language, nystagmus, and bilateral finger-nose test instability. Slight neck stiffness was noticed.\n\nCSF examination revealed a normal opening pressure of 148 mmH2O with only slightly elevated white blood cell count of 38 cells/µl (90% monocytes). Screenings of paraneoplastic antigens and serological autoantibodies including anti-nuclear, anti-thyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were all negative. Serum anti-M.P. IgM tests were positive twice in one week after admission, and weak positive two weeks later. Serum anti-Widal’s O test was positive with a titer of 1:80 on admission and conversed to be negative two weeks later. Next generation sequencing (Vision Medicals, Guangzhou, China) of CSF sample detected 64 unique reads against M.P.. CSF test was negative for AE antibodies, but was positive by TBA.\n\nDuring hospitalization, the patient’s symptoms deteriorated with recurrent nausea and vomiting, also her mental status was changed to be apathy. Physical examination showed opsoclonus-myoclonus involving her head and both arms. She was diagnosed as intracranial M.P. infection and possible secondary immune-mediated encephalitis. Azithromycin, doxycycline, intravenous methylprednisone (MP, 40mg/day) and intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG, 0.4 g/kg/d) were prescribed. Levodopa and clonazepam were also given to control the myoclonus. With the treatment, the patient’s symptoms improved with mild dizziness and opsoclonus. Cranial MRI was repeated and the result was not remarkable with mild white matter degeneration (Figure 4A-F). She was discharged to a local hospital for rehabilitation. During the follow-up study, she recovered partially with dizziness and a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 2 at 3 months.\n\nP2 patient, a young adult female, previously healthy, was admitted due to chest pain, right arm fatigue for 10 days and headache, nausea, vomiting, numbness in both legs for 6 days. Physical examination was not remarkable except for hyperalgesia in the left chest and abdomen, decreased needle tingling on the back of the left hand, and numbness on the feet. Chest CT and electrocardiogram (ECG) were not remarkable. Spine MRI showed long-segment spinal cord lesions from medulla to C6 segment (Figure 4J-L). Lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 185 mmH2O, with moderately elevated WBC of 240 cells/µl (90% monocytes), decreased glucose of 2.64 mmol/l, normal chloride level of 123 mmol/l, and elevated protein level of 0.80 g/l. CSF pathogen screenings for tuberculosis (TB) culture, TB-SPOT, X-pert, bacteria and fungi cultures were all negative. Antibodies including autoimmune encephalitis panels, anti-aquaporin 4 (AQP4), anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) were all negative. Cranial MRI with contrast revealed multiple patchy abnormal signals in the white matter area of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres and brain stem (Figure 4G-I). TBA was negative for CSF, and positive for serum.\n\nPossible tuberculous encephalomyelitis and acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) were considered. The patient was given anti-TB regimen (Rifampicin 0.45 g qd, Isoniazid 0.3 g qd, Pyrazinamide 0.5 g tid, Ethambutol 0.75 g qd) and intravenous MP pulse therapy (1 g/day for 5 days, and tapered to oral 48 mg/d). With the treatment, the patient’s chest pain and numbness were improved gradually. Lumber puncture was repeated 20 days later and revealed that the WBC decreased dramatically to 20 cells/µl, the glucose and protein returned to normal. She was followed up regularly in our clinic and the steroids was tapered. Anti-TB therapy was discontinued after 6 month’s treatment. Repeated cranial MRI revealed that the abnormal signals in the white matter area of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres and brain stem decreased dramatically (Figure 4M-O). Cervical MRI revealed that the abnormal signals of her spinal cord disappeared (Figure 4P-R).\n\nThe clinical features of the two patients were summarized in Table 1.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we identified IgG4-autoantibody specifically against CRMP2 in the sera and CSF samples of two AE patients with acute disease onset. Two patients had various symptoms. P1 presented with fever, nausea, vomiting, apathy, opsoclonus-myoclonus of head and arm, cerebellar signs including dizziness, slurred speech, and unstable walking. P2 had headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, right arm fatigue numbness in both legs. Both patients showed increased number of cells in CSF, and P2 had low glucose and increased level of protein. P1’s CSF had unique reads against M.P.. MRI images showed abnormal signals in the white matter in the two patients and long segment lesions on the spinal cord in P2. P1 was first diagnosed as M.P. infection. However, treatment with antibiotics only did not improve the symptoms. TBA immunostaining strongly indicated a secondary AE. Indeed, in additional of immunotherapy achieved good improvement at discharge and had 2 score of mRS at 3 months. P2 was diagnosis as possible TB & ADEM. 20 days treatment with anti-TB and immunotherapy reached good outcome for the patient at discharge and had 0 score of mRS at 3 months. Based on the study, we may correct the diagnosis as possible TB and autoimmune encephalomyelitis. No neoplasm was found in these patients currently and will be continuously follow up in the future. Our study provide evidence for the diagnosis of AE, expanding anti-CRMP2 antibody to the AE spectrum and suggesting to test anti-CRMP2 antibody in suspected AE patients.\n\nCRMPs highly express during embryonic development and decreases significantly after birth, while each CRMP has a different subcellular localization 22. In adult mouse brain, CRMP2 is expressed in the soma, axons, and dendrites of neurons from the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, immature and mature oligodendrocytes 23, 24. It is thought that antibodies against intracellular antigen mediate T cell immunoreaction and impair cell function in the related area, while the antibodies themselves will not cause a pathogenic antibody-antigen interaction 25-27. Therefore, symptoms of the two patients are consistent with the subcellular distribution of CRMP2 in the brain, or probably in the spinal region. Indeed, sera /and CSF from the two patients with anti-CRMP2 antibody had robust staining of the cortex, CA3 region of hippocampus and Purkinje cells of cerebellum.\n\nM.P. encephalitis is one of the most severe extra-respiratory complications, which accounts for 5-30% of all of the reported encephalitis cases28. The latency period between the onset of respiratory symptoms and the development of neurological abnormalities varies. In some cases, there was not a previous, clinically evident respiratory episode at all 29. P1 had definite intracranial infection of M.P. and early onset of encephalitis evidenced by the presence of IgM antibody against mycoplasma in serum and presence of M.P. DNA in CSF. Presence of antibody to CRMP2 suggests that P1 had an immediately immune-mediated CNS inflammation, which was also evidenced by the solely treatment with antibiotics deteriorated the patient’s symptoms. However, additional of IVIG and MP treatment improved her symptoms gradually. We considered that the symptoms of the patient were more attributed to the secondary inflammation caused by the M.P. infection. Anti-ganglioside and galactocerebroside antibodies have been found in association with mycoplasma neurological disorders. Thus, these studies and ours provide direct evidence that infection of M.P. cause secondary immune-mediated inflammation 30.\n\nInfections by viral and bacterial pathogens are suspected to initiate a broad range of neurological inflammatory disorders particularly AE 31. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has reported to trigger some types of AE frequently more than others, including anti-NMDAR, GABAAR, mGluR5, Neure-xin3a, and D2R antibodies. Among of them, near 64% AE patients post-HSV had anti-NMDAR antibody in their serum or CSF, while the remaining had antibodies unidentified. TB was associated with a lot of autoimmune disorders32, 33. Whether TB is a trigger of anti-CRMP2 encephalitis in P2 patient, more studies are warranted.\n\nEach CRMP has distinct neuronal function. Crmp2 gene knockout mouse shows that lack of CRMP2 leads to defects in axon guidance, axon pruning in hippocampus and visual cortex and altered dendritic spine remodeling34. The C-terminal region of CRMP2 involves in the post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, SUMOylation, oxidation, and O-GlcNAcylation. Several critical phosphorylation sites locate in the C-terminus35-37. The phosphorylated CRMP2 inhibits its interaction with tubulin heterodimers and augments interaction with NaV1.738. CRMP2 binds to CaV2.2 and increases Ca2+ level on the cell surface, interacts with several receptors including NMDARs, Kainate, and NCX (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 3) to regulate Ca2+ and Na+ neuronal homeostasis39-40. Although immunoreaction of anti-CRMP2 in related neurons is supposed not a direct causative reason, it might lead to dysregulation of other receptors. Epitope studies of CRMP2 indicated that C-terminus is responsive for the antibody binding, implying that antigen-antibody reaction may affect the function of CRMP2. The pathogenic properties of CRMP2 antibody should be clarified by more studies.\n\nThe present study consists small samples data from a single clinic center, thus, the detail clinical features and information of immunotherapy of anti-CRMP2 AE will be obtained in a large cohort study in the future. Our study characterized anti-CRMP2 antibody in two AE patients, who responded well to immunotherapy. We suggest to test anti-CRMP2 antibody in suggested AE patients.\n\nData Availability\n\nData are available upon reasonable request.
