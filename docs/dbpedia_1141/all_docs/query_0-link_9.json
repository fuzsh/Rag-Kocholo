        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe intricate neuronal wiring during development requires cytoskeletal reorganization orchestrated by signaling cues. Considering that cytoskeletal remodeling is a hallmark of cell migration, we inquired whether metastatic cancer cells exploit the axon guidance proteins to migrate. Indeed, in breast cancer patients, we found a significant correlation between the mesenchymal markers and the expression of dihydropyrimidinase-like 2 (DPYSL2), a regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics in growing axons. Strikingly, DPYSL2 knockout in mesenchymal-like cells profoundly inhibited cell migration, invasion, stemness features, tumor growth rate, and metastasis. Next, we aimed to decode the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon and revealed an interaction between DPYSL2 and Janus kinase 1 (JAK1). This binding is crucial for triggering signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and subsequently expressing vimentin, the pro-migratory intermediate filament. Collectively, we identified DPYSL2 as a molecular link between oncogenic signaling pathways and cytoskeletal reorganization in migrating breast cancer cells.\n\nStatement of significance This study shows that the axon guidance adaptor protein DPYSL2 is essential for promoting breast cancer migration. Specifically, this protein interacts with JAK1 to govern STAT3 signaling and subsequently vimentin expression.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe guidance of developing neurons to their specific target region is regulated by a combination of signaling cues composed of ligand/receptor interactions (1). The axon guidance machinery includes distinct families of canonical guidance proteins, such as slit guidance ligand (SLIT) (2). This family of secreted factors induces changes in the newly developing axon through interaction with members of the roundabout guidance receptor (ROBO) family (3). Other axon guidance families include the semaphorins and their receptors, neuropilins (NRP) (4). The outcome of semaphorins/NRP and ROBO/SLIT activation is structural reorganization of the cell (5) mediated by cytoskeleton binding proteins (6), such as the collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) family (7). Thus, in development cytoskeletal rearrangement is a central process, which is necessary for the axons to navigate to their defined targets.\n\nEpithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was initially described as an early developmental program used by epithelial cells to trans-differentiate and gain mesenchymal-like properties (8). In tumors, this program is assumed to be the mechanism by which carcinomas gain aggressive features such as migratory capabilities, chemoresistance, and stemness (9-11). The activation of the EMT program by extracellular cues (12), such as the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) (13,14) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) (9), results in significant transcriptome changes. Among the differentially expressed genes are cytoskeletal elements that drive the carcinoma cells to gain mesenchymal-like morphology and migratory capacity (8). Mesenchymal cell migration involves several steps that are governed by the three cytoskeletal networks, actin filaments, microtubule, and intermediate filaments (IF) (15). One of the main IFs is vimentin, an established EMT marker (16), which serves as a key regulator of cancer cell migration (17) and aggressiveness (18). Vimentin expression is induced by signaling cascades such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (19) while its activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation (20), glycosylation (21), and ubiquitination (22).\n\nDuring development, the growing axon demonstrates cellular properties shared with those associated with cancer cell migration (23,24), including extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling using specific matrix metalloproteins (MMP) (25). These MMPs include the gelatinases, MMP2 and MMP9 (26), which are established targets of the EMT program (27). The similarity between neuronal cell development and cancer cell migration prompted us to systematically characterize the expression of axon guidance genes in tumors. We identified dihydropyrimidinase-like 2 (DPYSL2, also known as CRMP2) to be highly expressed in mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells and plays an essential role in their migration ability. In these cells, DPYSL2 interacts with the Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and mediates the JAK/STAT3 signaling, subsequently regulating the expression of the downstream target, vimentin.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nAnimal Studies\n\nMDA-MB-231 WT and DPYSL2-KO cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female NOD-SCID mice (1 × 106 cells per mouse). The tumors were monitored and measured weekly. After 6 weeks, the tumors were harvested and weighed. The obtained lungs were observed under SMZ18 Nikon Stereo microscope. The pictures were slightly edited (brightness) with Adobe Photoshop. All mouse experiments were carried out under The Hebrew University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved (IACUC) protocol MD-16-14939-5. The Hebrew University is certified by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)\n\nImmunoprecipitation\n\nCells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM pyrophosphate, and 1% NP40 alternative, in addition to 0.5 mM sodium orthovanadate, 16mM sodium fluoride and one tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche) per 50 ml). The soluble fractions of cell lysates were isolated by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 10 min) in a microfuge. Flag M2 affinity resins (Sigma-Aldrich) were washed with lysis buffer three times. 30 µl of a 50% slurry of the resins was then added to the cleared cell lysates and incubated with rotation for 2 h at 4°C. Finally, the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl. For elution of FLAG-tagged proteins, the beads were incubated in elution buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM pyrophosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40 alternative and 100 µg/ml FLAG peptide) for 1 h at 30°C with shaking. Immunoprecipitated proteins were denatured by the addition of 150 µl of SDS sample buffer (5X) and boiling for 5 min, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described.\n\nCRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Knockout Cell lines\n\nWe used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing to achieve gene knockout, using pLentiCRISPR v1 (Addgene Plasmid #70662) in which the sgRNA and Cas9 are delivered on a single plasmid. We also generated knockout cells using pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 (Addgene Plasmid #62988). Editing of the DPYSL2 locus in MDA-MB-231 cells was accomplished by either infecting cells with the “pLentiCRISPR” plasmid, or by transfection with the PX459 plasmid into which a sgRNA targeting the DPYSL2 locus had been cloned. Cells were then subjected to single-cell cloning by limiting dilution in 96-well plates. Editing of the DPYSL2 locus was confirmed by assessing protein level by Western Blot.\n\nGuide RNA sequences\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using the R (version 4.0) or GraphPad Prism (version 8.0) statistical analysis programs. If not indicated otherwise, all the p-values in the figures measured between the indicated samples were quantified using Student’s t-test.\n\nAnalysis of breast cancer data in cBioportal\n\nThe cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics is an open-access database, providing visualization and analysis tools for large-scale cancer genomics data sets (http://cbioportal.org). For gene correlation analysis we queried DPYSL2 or JAK1 in breast invasive carcinoma (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas project) (34), or the METABRIC (39) (containing 1,084 or 2,509 samples respectively). Then, we subjected the genes to co-expression analysis and downloaded the correlation plots. For gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), Spearman’s correlation coefficient between the gene of interest and the whole genome were computed, downloaded, and subjected to GSEA using the GSEA 4.1.0 version software (37). For the different analysis we selected the h.all.v7.2.symbole.gmt (Hallmarks) or C2.cp.kegg.v7.2.symbols.gmt (Curated) gene set databases.\n\nResults\n\nDPYSL2 expression correlates with mesenchymal markers\n\nWe sought to identify the axon guidance molecules that are differentially expressed in mesenchymal and epithelial samples. Previously, we segregated the cancer cell lines of the MERAV database into epithelial and mesenchymal groups (28) according to their transcriptome (http://merav.wi.mit.edu/) (29). We then analyzed these two groups for their expression of 126 axon guidance genes, as defined by the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) database (https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?pathway:hsa04360). We found ten axon guidance genes that were significantly upregulated (cut off ratio of Log2=1, Mesenchymal-UP) and five downregulated (cut off ratio of Log2=-1, Mesenchymal-Down) in mesenchymal cell lines (Figure S1A). The upregulated set included genes known to participate in cancer cell aggressiveness, including SLIT2, ROBO1 (30), NRP1 (31), FYN proto-oncogene (FYN) (32), and cofilin 2 (CFL2) (33) (Figure 1A and B), supporting our bioinformatics analysis. Since DPYSL2 exhibited the highest expression level in mesenchymal cells, and its function in cancer is not yet established, we decided to characterize its role in cancer cell aggressiveness.\n\nWe then assessed the DPYSL2 expression profile in patient-derived breast cancer samples. We analyzed the cancer genome atlas (TCGA, PanCancer Atlas project) data (34) available on cBioportal (https://www.cbioportal.org)(35,36), and found by gene set enrich analysis (GSEA) (37) that DPYSL2 expression significantly correlated with EMT, cell adhesion, and axon guidance molecules (Figure 1C). We found that in breast cancer, DPYSL2 significantly correlates with the axon guidance molecules ROBO, SLIT2, FYN, and NRP1 (Figure S1B). Moreover, it also significantly correlated with the EMT markers Snail Family Transcriptional Repressor 2 (SNAI2), zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1, 2 (ZEB1, ZEB2), and vimentin (VIM) that demonstrated the highest Spearman’s correlation coefficient (0.61) (Figure S1C). Whereas DPYSL2 expression anticorrelated with the epithelial markers keratin 18 (KRT18) and keratin 19 (KRT19) (38) (Figure S1D). Furthermore, by analyzing both the METABRIC (39) and TCGA databases (40), we found that samples highly expressing DPYSL2 (DPYSL2-high) are significantly enriched with high-grade breast cancer subtypes (basal and claudin-low), in comparison to DPYSL2-low samples (Figure 1D). Additionally, utilizing the Kaplan-Meier Plotter tool (http://kmplot.com/analysis/) (41), we identified a significant association between high DPYSL2 expression levels and poor relapse-free survival (RFS) rate (42) (Figure 1E).\n\nNext, we determined that DPYSL2 is upregulated in breast cancer-derived mesenchymal-like (basal B) cell lines relative to epithelial (luminal) cell lines (Figure 1F). Likewise, EMT induction in engineered human mammary epithelial (HMLE-Twist-ER) cells induced DPYSL2 expression. In this system, the EMT program is induced by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), which in turn, activates an ectopically expressed twist family BHLH transcription factor 1 (Twist1) conjugated to the estrogen receptor (28,43) (Figure 1G). This treatment also resulted in upregulation of vimentin (VIM) and downregulation of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin (E-CAD). Thus, we revealed that the EMT program regulates DPYSL2 expression, indicating its role in cancer cell aggressiveness.\n\nDPYSL2 loss inhibits cell aggressiveness in breast cancer cell lines\n\nTo further assess DPYSL2’s contribution to cancer aggressiveness, we knocked out DPYSL2 from the basal B breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 (DPYSL2-KO), using the Cas9-CRISPR system (Figure 2A). These cells were then subjected to comparative CEL-Seq analysis, which generated a list of significantly downregulated genes in the knockout relative to WT cells (Table S1). Based on Metascape analysis (https://metascape.org/) (44), we systematically categorized this gene list according to biological functions related to migration and cellular signaling (Figure 2B).\n\nNext, we applied in vitro functional readouts to assess the involvement of DPYSL2 in cancer cell aggressiveness. Using the Boyden chamber-based transwell migration assay (Figure 2C), invasion assay (Figure 2D), and the Incucyte Live-Cell analysis system (Figure 2E and S2A), we found that DPYSL2 loss significantly inhibited the migratory and invasive abilities of these cells without affecting the proliferation rate (Figure S2B). Additionally, we found that DPYSL2-KO cells, relative to WT, showed significant reductions in the extracellular CD44 levels (Figure 2F and S2C) and mammosphere formation ability (Figure 2G), which are well-established stemness indicators (45). Furthermore, restoring DPYSL2 expression in these KO cells (DPYSL2-KO+DPYSL2-FLAG) (Figure 2A) improved their migration, invasion, and stemness to levels comparable to WT (DPYSL2-WT) (Figure 2C, D, E, F, and G). Together these in vitro assays indicated the crucial role of DPYSL2 in maintaining the aggressive state of cancer cells.\n\nDPYSL2 expression promotes tumor formation and metastasis\n\nWe aimed to determine the role of DPYSL2 in tumor formation and metastasis in vivo. Accordingly, we injected GFP-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells (WT or DPYSL2-KO) into the mammary fat pads of female NOD-SCID mice and monitored the tumor growth for six weeks. We found that tumor growth rate in mice injected with the DPYSL2-KO cells was significantly lower than that in mice injected with WT cells (Figure 3A). Correspondingly, the average weight of tumors formed in the DPYSL2-KO-injected mice was significantly lower than those from WT-injected mice (Figure 3B and S3A). We also harvested the lungs of the injected mice, examined them for the presence of metastases, and measured the number of GFP-positive colonies. In comparison to WT, DPYSL2-KO-injeced mice had a significant reduction in the number of lung metastases (Figure 3C, 3D, and S3B), which was further validated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Figure 3E and S3C). Altogether, we found that DPYSL2 is a central player in tumor growth and metastasis.\n\nJAK1 interacts with the C terminal domain of DPYSL2\n\nDPYSL2 is a cytoskeleton-interacting protein that plays a vital role in axon guidance (46). This adaptor protein is regulated at its C-terminal domain (81 amino acids) (47) (Figure 4A) through posttranslational modifications (48). We performed an immunoprecipitation assay followed by LC-MS to identify DPYSL2-interacting partners in MDA-MB-231 cells, and then systematically categorized them using Metascape (Table S2). We found that the generated categories were associated with known DPYSL2 activities, such as folding of actin, axon guidance, and semaphorin interaction proteins (Figure S4A), which validates the capability of our assay. Interestingly, among the list of DPYSL2-interacting proteins, we identified JAK1, a crucial signaling molecule that mediates cancer cell aggressiveness (49). We found JAK1-DPYSL2 binding to be specific (DPYSL2-FLAG) since JAK1 did not interact with the control protein RAP2A (RAP2A-FLAG). In addition, this interaction is C-terminal dependent as JAK1 only binds the full-length protein and not the truncated form (DPYSL2-ΔCter-FLAG) (Figure 4B). This interaction was also observed in Hs-578-T cells, another basal B breast cancer cell line. To support these findings, we analyzed JAK1 expression in breast cancer patients and demonstrated a significant correlation with DPYSL2 (Figure 4C) and EMT markers (Figure S4B). In parallel, DPYSL2 levels significantly correlated with expression of cytokines and their receptors (Figure S4C), which are established targets of JAK1 (50). Together, these data show that DPYSL2 interaction is not exclusive to cytoskeletal proteins as it binds components of intracellular signaling pathways.\n\nDPYSL2 as a regulator of STAT3 signaling\n\nUpon its activation, JAK1 phosphorylates the transcription factor STAT3 on tyrosine 705 (51), which in turn translocates into the nucleus and induces the expression of selected metastatic and migratory factors, such as vimentin and MMP9 (19). After identifying DPYSL2-JAK1 interaction, we determined whether this adaptor protein plays a role in STAT3 activation. Indeed, compared to WT cells, the basal level of STAT3 phosphorylation was decreased in knockout cells (DPYSL2-KO) and increased in cells ectopically expressing the full-length DPYSL2 (DPYSL2-FLAG) (Figure 4D). In contrast, overexpression of the truncated form (DPYSL2-ΔCter-FLAG) did not affect STAT3 phosphorylation, thus indicating the importance of the C-terminal domain in regulating this signaling cascade.\n\nTo further establish DPYSL2’s role in STAT3 signaling, we treated both WT and DPYSL2-KO cells with Hyper-IL6 (52), a fusion protein of IL-6 and the soluble IL6-receptor (sIL6R), which is a potent inducer of STAT3 phosphorylation (53). We found that Hyper-IL6 substantially induced STAT3 phosphorylation in DPYSL2-WT cells, while this induction was lower in knockout cells (Figure 4E and S4D). Moreover, we verified activation of the IL6/JAK/STAT3 axis by co-treating the cells with Hyper-IL6 and ruxolitinib, a selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 (54), which abolished the STAT3 phosphorylation. Similarly, xenografts generated from DPYSL2-WT cells exhibited higher STAT3 phosphorylation than those from DPYSL2-KO cells (Figure 4F). Finally, in breast cancer patients, DPYSL2 expression significantly correlated with IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling (Figure 4G). Together these findings indicate that DPYSL2 is a critical factor in the activation of the JAK1-STAT3 signaling cascade.\n\nDPYSL2 mediates STAT3 induction of vimentin expression\n\nOur differential transcriptome analysis identified a group of 2,302 genes that are downregulated upon DPYSL2 loss (DPYSL2-DOWN). By analyzing the 48 STAT3 target genes’ distribution, we identified 16 that are significantly enriched in the DPYSL2-DOWN group (Figure S5A and S5B), including vimentin. Next, we assessed the vimentin protein level by immunoblot and immunofluorescence and found that DPYSL2-KO cells expressed less vimentin relative to WT (Figure 5A and S5C). Moreover, overexpression of the full-length DPYSL2 (DPYSL2-FLAG), but not the C-terminal truncated form (DPYSL2-ΔCter-FLAG), resulted in elevated vimentin expression level in knockout cells (Figure 5A). To further determine that DPYSL2 functions upstream of the STAT3-vimentin axis, we ectopically expressed the constitutively activated STAT3 (A662C, N664C, V667L, (CA-STAT3)) (55) in DPYSL2-KO cells. We found that in these cells, CA-STAT3 promoted vimentin expression (Figure 5B) and migration capability (Figure 5C and S5D). Furthermore, CA-STAT3 induced its known target IL-6 (51), which validated its activity (Figure S5E). Finally, we clarified DPYSL2’s role in cell migration, as its loss disrupted the actin-based structures known as filopodia at the edge of the migrating cells (Figure 5D). Together these results demonstrated that DPYSL2 governs cancer cell migration through its essential role in the JAK1/STAT3/vimentin axis.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe established the axon guidance adaptor protein DPYSL2 as a key factor in breast cancer cell aggressiveness. We found a significant correlation between the expression of DPYSL2 and mesenchymal markers in breast cancer patients and in cell lines. Moreover, DPYSL2 loss had a substantial impact on cell motility, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. We demonstrated that DPYSL2 regulates cancer cell migration through its binding to JAK1. This interaction induces STAT3 signaling, which upregulates the expression of migratory factors such as vimentin (Figure 5E). These findings indicate a novel cellular regulatory mechanism, where adaptor proteins serve as a direct link between cytoskeletal molecules and oncogenic signaling kinases. In this study, we demonstrated that cancer cells utilize components from the neuronal axon guidance machinery, including DPYSL2, to migrate efficiently. However, despite the similarities between cancer cell migration and axon guidance, these cellular systems regulate DPYSL2 expression differently. For instance, during axon growth, DPYSL2 is expressed at a relatively constant rate, but undergoes a diverse set of posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, and SUMOylation (7). Nevertheless, DPYSL2 demonstrates a differential gene expression pattern in various tumor types. In colorectal carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), DPYSL2 expression is upregulated in tumors relative to surrounding normal tissues (56-58), whereas epithelial breast cancer samples exhibited the opposite expression pattern (59). These cancer types also differ in their DPYSL2 expression pattern throughout tumor progression. In colorectal carcinoma and NSCLC, DPYSL2 expression does not vary between low-and high-grade samples, while in lung cancer, it demonstrates a progression-dependent phosphorylation pattern (57). However, in breast cancer, DPYSL2 level is upregulated in highly aggressive subtypes including basal and mesenchymal-like (60). This reported pattern correlates with METABRIC and TCGA databases, as our analysis shows that high DPYSL2 is enriched in normal, basal, and claudin-low samples (Figure 1D). Hence, these expression variations among diverse tumors suggest that DPYSL2 serves a cancer type-dependent function that is yet to be resolved.\n\nBy applying the CRISPR-Cas9 knockout system, we found that DPYSL2 expression is essential for the breast cancer cells to maintain their high-grade characteristics. However, a recent study, in which DPYSL2 expression was manipulated by overexpression or short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown, suggested that this gene suppresses breast cancer aggressiveness (60). Here, we suggest that a defined expression level of DPYSL2 is crucial for its efficiency, as any variation may interfere with its stoichiometric interaction with JAK1 and consequently affect cell migration. The different experimental tools used in the two studies resulted in different DPYSL2 expression levels, which could generate dissimilar outcomes.\n\nIn neuronal development, DPYSL2 guides axons through direct binding with numerous cytoskeletal proteins, including actin and tubulin (61). Here, we identified that in breast cancer, DPYSL2 interacts with signaling factors as an additional mechanism to modulate cell migration. Specifically, we found that this adaptor protein plays an essential role as a regulator of the JAK1/STAT3 signaling cascade and subsequently governs vimentin expression. Thus, we predict that future studies will establish a similar regulatory role of DPYSL2 in developing neurons’ signaling cascades.\n\nIn addition to their role in development, many axon guidance genes, including DPYSL2, function in the neuronal injury response machinery (62,63). However, the function of DPYSL2 in neuronal regeneration is still an enigma. Upon neuronal injury, a set of pro-regenerative factors are released, including the cytokine IL-6 (64), which activates the JAK/STAT3 signaling cascade (65). Since we determined that DPYSL2-JAK1 interaction is a regulator of STAT3 signaling in cancer cells, we suggest that the same mechanism applies to neuronal injury response. Thus, identifying factors that enhance DPYSL2-JAK1 interaction in cancer cells can be potentially used as drug targets to improve neuronal injury repair.\n\nAuthor contribution\n\nA.A.R and Y.D.S designed the study.
