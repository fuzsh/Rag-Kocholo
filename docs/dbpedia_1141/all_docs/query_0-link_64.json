Examples of nucleotide binding proteins include Ca proteins, which act as coupling factors in association with certain receptors;\n\nprotein kinases, which transfer a phosphate group to target proteins; non-protein kinases, such as hexokinase, which are involved in the metabolic pathways within cells;\n\nproteins utilizing the energy stored within nucleotide-based molecules such as ATP; ete.\n\n[0004] Protein kinases are the enzymes responsible for catalyzing the transfer of a Â°y phosphoryl group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine, threonine or tyrosine residues in peptides, polypeptides, and proteins in a process known as \"phosphorylation.\" Protein phosphorylation is a ubiquitous regulatory mechanism in eukaryotic cells, where it is of central importance in controlling cell function, growth and differentiation. A\n\nprotein kinase that phosphorylates, for example, tyrosine residues in its substrates is termed a protein-tyrosine:ATP phosphotransferase, or, more commonly, a tyrosine (or Tyr) kinase. The eukaryotic protein kinases make up a large superfamily of related proteins.\n\nThey are related by virtue of their kinase domains (also known as catalytic domains), which consist of approximately 250-300 amino acid residues. The kinase domains that define this group of enzymes contain 12 conserved subdomains that fold into a common catalytic core structure.\n\nSee, e.g., Hanks and Hunter, FASEB J. (1995) 9(8):576-96.\n\n[0005] Eukaryotic protein kinases can be classified on the basis of their sequence, substrate specificity and regulation. One major subdivision is between Ser/Thr kinases and the Tyr kinases. Yeast have numerous Ser/Thr kinases, many of which have readily recognizable counterparts in all higher organisms, but very few dedicated Tyr kinases (an example of a yeast Tyr kinase is Swe1 from Saccl2arornyces cerevisiae and its homolog in S. pombe Weel). By contrast, many signaling pathways of multicellular organisms depend on two large and important Tyr kinase families, the receptor-Tyr kinases which have intracellulaa- Tyr kinase domains, and the Src family of cytoplasmic Tyr kinases. There are also dual-specificity enzymes, present in both unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (1VIAPI~I~s).\n\n[0006] Overexpression and/or mutation of certain kinases in tumor cell is believed to upregulate a wunber of cell cycle and anti-apoptosis pathways leading to subversion of cell cycle checkpoints and enhanced cancer cell survival and metastatic potential.\n\nConversely, inhibition of these kinases may reverse the aberrant signaling in receptor-overexpressing cells and may result in growth arrest and/or tumor cell death.\n\nThus, it is no surprise that kinases have been considered important targets for the identification of therapeutics. See, e.g., Bishop et al., Trends Cell Biol (2001) 11(4):167-72.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0007] The present invention provides compositions and methods for assessing protein profiles in biological samples. In various embodiments, one or more samples, most preferably one or more complex protein mixtures as defined below, are contacted with one or more probes, referred to herein as \"tagged acyl phosphate probes\" or \"TAPPs.\" These probes, have the following general structure:\n\nO O\n\nTAG L C O P X\n\nO-wherein TAG is a detectable label, L is a linker moiety covalently bound to the carbonyl through a carbon atom, and X is an affinity moiety for directing the binding of a TAPP to a set of target proteins. In preferred embodiments, X is linked through a carbon to form an aryl phosphonate, but is most preferably linked through an oxygen to form an acyl phosphate. The skilled artisan will understand that the activated aryl group of such a structure readily forms protein-bound adducts by reaction with nucleophilic groups such as an amino group on target protein molecules.\n\n[000] TAPPs are described herein in terms of nucleotide binding protein-directed affinity probes\" or \"hiBAPs,\" comprising: a nucleotide or nucleotide analogue covalently bound tluough the terminal phosphate of a 5' mono- di- or tri-phosphate to an acyl group, which is itself further covalently bound to a detectable tag via a linker moiety. As described hereinafter, the nucleotide portion directs the binding of an NBAP to nucleotide binding proteins, or proteins intimately associated with nucleotide binding proteins.\n\nBut the skilled artisan will understand that the affinity moiety X of a TAPP may be varied widely to provide probes directed to a number of proteins or protein families.\n\n[0009] The binding selectivity of the probes) may be selected to allow the skilled artisan to analyze the presence, amount, and/or activity of a selected portion of the nucleotide binding proteins present in a sample, thereby simplifying the analysis of complex protein mixtures.\n\n[0010] One or more TAPPs are combined with a protein-containing sample under conditions for binding and reaction of the TAPP(s) with target proteins that are present in the sample. The resulting products are then used to assess the target protein profile of the sample, and can be correlated to the presence, amount, or activity of one or more target proteins present in the original complex protein mixture.\n\n[0011 ] In a first aspect, the present invention relates to methods and compositions for determining an enzyme profile in a complex protein mixture. These methods comprise contacting the complex protein mixture with one or more distinct TAPPs, each of which specifically reacts with one or more target proteins, preferably target nucleotide binding proteins, and most preferably target kinases. The labeled protein profile can then be analyzed by the screening andlor identification methods described hereinafter.\n\n[0012] In preferred embodiments, the TAPP-protein conjugates can be separated from other components of the complex protein mixture, for example by sequestering one or more conjugates (e.g., by binding to a receptor that binds the T~ICa portion of the Td~PP or by using a \"tethered\" TAPP), by chromatographic methods, by mass spectrographic ' methods, and/or by other means such as electrophoresis. Thus, in related aspects, the present invention also relates to purified polypeptides (e.g., proteins or protein fragments) bound to TAPP(s). In these aspects, the labeled polypeptides have the following structure:\n\nO\n\nTAG L C Polypeptide wherein the polypeptide is covalently bound to the carbonyl through an amide, ester, or thioester linkage.\n\n[0013] In various embodiments, following reaction of the complex protein mixture with one or more TAPPs, the resulting TAPP-protein conjugates may be proteolytically digested to provide TAPP-labeled peptides. This digestion may occur while the protein conjugates are sequestered to a solid phase, or while free in solution. In preferred embodiments, TAPPs are selected such that each target protein forms a conjugate with a single TAPP, most preferably at a single discrete location in the target nucleotide binding protein; thus, each conjugate gives rise to a single TAPP-labeled peptide.\n\nEnrichment separation, or identification of one or more TAPP-labeled peptides may be achieved using liquid chromatography and/or electrophoresis. Additionally, mass spectrometry may be employed to identify one or more TAPP-labeled peptides by molecular weight and/or amino acid sequence. W particularly preferred embodiments, the sequence information derived from the TAPP-labeled peptides) is used to identify the protein from which the peptide originally derived. variations of these aspects can involve the comparison of two or more proteomes, e.g., with TAPPs having different TAGS, or, when analysis comprises mass spectrometry, having different isotopic compositions.\n\n[0014] In yet another aspect, the instant invention relates to methods for comparing the presence, amount, or activity of one or more target proteins in two or more complex protein mixtures using the methods and compositions described herein. In various embodiments, these methods comprise one or more of the following steps:\n\ncontacting one or more complex protein mixtures) with one or more TAPPs, where the TAPP(s) specifically bind to one or more target proteins present in each complex protein mixture;\n\ncombining the complex protein mixtures following this contacting step to form a combined complex protein mixture; prior to and/or following this combination, removing one or more non-sequestered components of the complex protein mixture(s). The labeled protein profile can then be analyzed by the screening and/or identification methods described hereinafter.\n\n[0015] In preferred embodiments, the methods and compositions described herein are applied to determining the nucleotide binding protein profiles of cancerous and other diseased tissue by obtaining one or more samples of diseased tissue, and determining the nucleotide binding protein profile of the tissue sample(s). In particularly preferred embodiments, the nucleotide binding protein profile of diseased tissues can be compared to that of normal tissue samples) to determine differences in the enzyme activity profiles of the two tissue samples.\n\n[0016] In still another aspect, the present invention relates to methods and compositions for detecting disease in a test sample. In preferred embodiments the test sample will be a cell or tissue sample. In particularly preferred embodiments, the tissue sample will be a neoplasmic sample and the disease is a cancer. The methods involve determining the target protein profile of the test sample using one or more TAPPs;\n\ncomparing the labeled protein profiles of the test sample with the labeled protein profiles) of one or more known non-diseased sample and/or with the labeled protein profiles) of one or more known diseased samples; and determining whether the test sample is in a state of disease. !1 \"non-diseased\" sample is a sample of cells or tissues that is known to not have the disease being tested for. It is preferably a normal, healthy sample of the cells or tissue.\n\n[0017] W another aspect the present invention provides methods of determining the inhibitory potency of a test compound against one or more target proteins. The methods involve contacting one or more TAPPs with a test sample containing the test compound and the target protein(s); allowing the TAPPs to react with proteins contained in the test sample;\n\nand detecting a signal that indicates the level of TAPP binding to the target proteins) in the test sample.\n\n[0018] In preferred embodiments, this level of TAPP binding is compared to the level of TAPP binding to the target proteins) in the absence of the test compound. By such methods, the inhibitory and/or stimulatory potency of the test compound against the target proteins) can be determined. The \"inhibitory potency\" is the extent to which the presence of the compound causes the inhibition of TAPP binding, while \"stimulatory potency\" is the extent to which the presence of the compound causes an increase in TAPP\n\nbinding.\n\n[0019] hi yet another aspect, the present invention provides kits for performing the methods described. The kits contain one or more of the materials described for conducting the methods. The kits can include TAPPs in the solid phase or in a liquid phase (such as buffers provided) in a package. The kits also can include buffers for preparing solutions for conducting the methods, and pipettes for transferring liquids from one container to another.\n\nBy \"package\" is meant material enveloping a vessel containing the TAPPs. In preferred embodiments, the package can be a box or wrapping. The kit can also contain items that are not contained within the package but are attached to the outside of the package, for example, pipettes.\n\n[0020] The smnmary of the invention described above is not limiting and other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, as well as fiom the claims.\n\nSRIEF DESCRIPTI~1oT ~F THE FIGURES\n\n[0021] Fig. 1 shows exemplary acyl phosphate probes of the invention.\n\n[0022] Fig. 2 shows an exemplary synthesis scheme for preparing acyl phosphate probes of the invention.\n\n[0023] Fig. 3 shows an alternative exemplary synthesis scheme for preparing acyl phosphate probes of the invention.\n\n[0024] Fig. 4 shows exemplary BASES for use in preparing acyl phosphate probes of the invention.\n\n[0025] Fig. 5 shows exemplary affinity moieties for use in preparing acyl phosphate probes of the invention.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n[0026] The subject methods and compositions provide enhanced simplicity and accuracy in identifying changes in the presence, amount, or activity of proteins in a complex protein mixture using TAPPs. As described hereinafter, preferred TAPPs are NBAPs that bind to target nucleotide binding proteins) and proteins that interact with nucleotide binding protein(s). The profiling methods described herein can have a number of steps leading to the identification of, or determining the presence or amount of, target proteins) in a complex protein mixture. A complex protein mixture, and preferably two or more complex protein mixtures, e.g., a sample and a control, can be used as obtained from a natural source or as processed, e.~-., to remove interfering components and/or enrich the taxget protein components. Each complex protein mixture to be analyzed is combined under reaction conditions with at least one TAPP to produce conjugates with target nucleotide binding protein(s). The TAPPs used in two or more complex protein mixtures can differ as to the choice of TACT moiety, linl~er moieties, affinity moieties, and/or isotopic composition.\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the labeled complex protein mixtures may be directly compared (e.g.., in the same capillary of a capillary electrophoresis apparatus or lane in an electrophoresis gel, or in a mass spectrometer).\n\n[0027] The analysis platforms described herein can differ as to the methods of enrichment and analysis using liquid chromatography and/or electrophoresis, and/or mass spectrometry for identification and quantitation. The choice of the platform is affected by the size of the sample, the rate of throughput of the samples, the mode of identification, and the need for and level of quantitation.\n\n[0028] Of particular interest as target proteins in the present invention are nucleotide binding proteins, and most preferably protein kinases. The term \"nucleotide binding protein\" refers to proteins that bind nucleotide mono-, di- and/or tri-phosphates. Exemplary nucleotide binding protein families include kinase families described below;\n\nguanine nucleotide binding proteins (e.g. in G protein-coupled receptors); motor-related proteins (e.g., myosin, actin, tubulin, dynein, kinesin, etc.); nucleic acid polymerases; UspA and related proteins; P2 receptors; etc. This list is not meant to be limiting.\n\n[0029] Protein kinases are the enzymes responsible for catalyzing the transfer of a ~y phosphoryl group from ATP to the hydroxyl group of serine, threonine or tyrosine residues in peptides, polypeptides, and proteins in a process known as \"phosphorylation.\" Protein kinases have been identified in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and in both plants and animals. The list of identified kinases is extensive, including the following families of proteins: cyclic nucleotide regulated protein kinase (PKA ~ PKG) family;\n\ndiacylglycerol-activated/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) family; kinases that phoshorylate G protein-coupled receptors family; budding yeast AGC-related protein kinase family;\n\nkinases that phosphorylate ribosomal protein S6 family; budding yeast DEF2120 family;\n\nflowering plant PVPKl protein leinase homolog family; kinases regulated by Caz+/CaM and close relatives family; KIN1/SNF1/Niml family; cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and close relatives family; ERK (MAP) kinase family; glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) -family; casein kinase II family; Clk family; Src family; Tec/Atk family; Csk family; Fes (Fps) family; Abl family; Syk/ZAP70 family; Tyk2/Jakl family; Ack family;\n\nfocal adhesion kinase (Fak) family; epidermal growth factor receptor family; Eph/Elk/Eck receptor family;\n\nAxl family; Tie/Tek family; platelet-derived growth factor receptor family;\n\nfibroblast growth factor receptor family; insulin receptor family; LTK/ALK family;\n\nRos/Sevenless family; Trk/Ror family; DDR/TKT family; hepatocyte growth factor receptor family, nematode KinlS/16 family; Polo family; MEK/STE7 family; PAK/STE20 family;\n\nMEKK/STE11 family; NimA family; weel/mikl family; kinases involved in transcriptional control family; Raf family; activin/TGFb receptor family; flowering plant putative receptor kinases and close relatives family; PSK/PTK \"mixed lineage\" leucine zipper domain family;\n\ncasein kinase I family; and PKN prokaryotic protein kinase family.\n\n[0030] The compositions and methods described herein find use for the most part with biological samples, which may have been subject to processing before reaction with the TAPPs. \"Biological sample\" intends a sample obtained from a cell, tissue, or organism.\n\nExamples of biological samples include proteins obtained from cells (e.g., mammalian cells, bacterial cells, cultured cells, human cells, plant cells, etc.), particularly as a lysate, a biological fluid, such as blood, plasma, serum, urine, bile, saliva, tears, cerebrospinal fluid, aqueous or vitreous humor, or any bodily secretion), a transudate or exudate (e.g. fluid obtained from an abscess or other site of infection or inflammation), a fluid obtained from a joint (e.g. synovial fluid obtained from a normal joint or a joint affected by disease such as rhetunatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout or septic arthritis), or the like.\n\n[0031] Biological samples may be obtained from any organ or tissue (including a biopsy or autopsy specimen) or may comprise cells (including primary cells, passaged or cultured primary cells, cell lines, cells conditioned by a specific medium) or medium conditioned by cells. In preferred embodiments, a biological sample is free of intact cells. If desired, the biological sample may be subj ected to prior processing, such as lysis, extraction, subcellular fractionation, and the like. See, Deutscher (ed.), 1990, Methods in Enzymology, vol. 182, pp. 147-238.\n\n[0032] Of particular interest are samples that are \"complex protein mixtures.\"\n\nAs used herein, this phrase refers to protein mixtures having at least about 20, more usually at least about 50, even 100 or more different proteins, where the particular distribution of proteins is of interest. An example of such a complex protein mixture is a proteome, as defined hereinafter. Complex protein mixtures may be obtained from cells that are normal or abnormal in some particular, where the abnormality is informative as to treatment, status, disease, or the like, can be analyzed using the methods of the subject invention.\n\n[0033] The teen \"proteome\" as used herein refers to a complex protein mixture obtained from a biological sample. Preferred proteomes comprise at least about 5% of the total repertoire of proteins present in a biological sample (e.g., the cells, tissue, organ, or organism from which a lysate is obtained; the serum or plasma, etc.), preferably at least about 10%, more preferably at least about 25%, even more preferably about 75%, and generally 90% or more, up to and including the entire repertoire of proteins obtainable from the biological sample. Thus the proteome may be obtained from an intact cell, a lysate, a microsomal fraction, an organelle, a partially extracted lysate, biological fluid, a tissue, an organ, and the like. The proteome will be a mixture of proteins, generally having at least about 20 different proteins, usually at least about 50 different proteins and in most cases 100 different proteins or more.\n\n[0034] Generally, the sample will have at least about 1 x 10-11 g of protein, and may have 1 g of protein or more, preferably at a concentration in the range of about 0.1- 50 mg/ml. For screening applications, the sample will typically be between about 1 x 10-11 g of protein and about 1 x 10-3 g of protein, preferably between about 1 x 10-6 g of protein and 1 x 10-4 g of protein. For identification of labeled active target kinases, the sample will typically be between about 1 x 10-9 g of protein and about 1 g of protein, preferably between about 1 x 10-4 g of protein and 1 x 10-1 g of protein. The term \"about\" in this context refers to +/- 10% of the amount listed.\n\n[0035] The sample may be adjusted to the appropriate buffer concentration and pH, if desired. One or more TAPPs may then be added, each at a concentration in the range of about 1 nM to 20 mM, preferably 10 nM to 1 mM, most preferably 10 nm to 100 ~.M. After incubating the reaction mixture, generally for a time for the reaction to go substantially to completion, generally for about 0.11- 60 minutes, at a temperature in the range of about 5 -40Â°C, preferably about 10Â°C to about 30Â°C , most preferably about 20Â°C , the reaction may be quenched.\n\n[0036] In one aspect of the invention, the methods and compositions provide for qualitative (e.g., relative comparison between two samples) and/or quantitative measurement of target nucleotide binding protein(s)in biological fluids, cells or tissues.\n\nMoreover, the same general strategy can be broadened to achieve the proteome-wide, qualitative and quantitative analysis of target protein(s), by employing TAPPs with differing target specificities. The methods and compositions of this invention can be used to identify labeled target proteins) of low abundance that are present in complex protein mixtures and can be used to selectively analyse specific groups or classes of proteins, such as membrane or cell surface kinases, or kinases contained within organelles, sub-cellular fractions, or biochemical fractions such as immunoprecipitates. Further, these methods can be applied to analyse differences in expressed target proteins in different cell states. For example, the methods and reagents herein can be employed in diagnostic assays for the detection of the presence or the absence of one or more target proteins indicative of a disease state, such as cancer.\n\n[0037] The subj ect methods and compositions can be used for a variety of purposes, such as the diagnosis of disease, the response of cells to an external agent, e.g. a drug, staging diseases, such as neoplasia, identifying cell differentiation and maturation, identifying new proteins, screening for active drugs, determining side effects of drugs, determining selectivity of drugs, identifying responses to drugs specific to certain genotypes (e.g., allelic differences in individuals), identifying useful probes from combinatorial libraries, etc.\n\n[0038] The system uses TAPPs that are typically directed to an active site on target protein(s). However, many proteins may be labeled, not as a result of their own interaction with a TAPP, but by their proximity to a second protein that does interact with a TAPP. For example, numerous nucleotide binding proteins (e.g., kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, etc.) are members of multisubunit complexes. An NBAP may be selected for its ability to interact with the nucleotide binding site of a particular kinase; but may bind to one or more members) of the complex that lie sufficiently close to that nucleotide binding site, even though the other members) do not themselves bind to the NEAP.\n\n[0039] This ability to bind members of the complex may also be related to various physiological states, as it may be that the other members) of the complex are only sufficiently close to that nucleotide binding site under certain circumstances (e.g., when the kinase is phosphorylated, or when a cofactor is present). Similarly, different sites on a target protein may be differentially labeled in different physiological states, as when the target protein changes three-dimensional conformation under similar circumstances.\n\n[0040] In certain embodiments, a plurality of TAPPs may be combined for use in a labeling method, depending on the specificity of the TAPPs and the variety in the group or groups of proteins to be assayed. In the present invention, it is not necessary that there be no reaction of a TAPP with non-target protein(s). Rather, a TAPP is defined as being \"specific for,\" as \"specifically reacting with,\" or as \"specifically binding to,\" target proteins) if the TAPP provides at least about twice the amount of signal from TAPP labeling of target proteins) when compared to an equivalent amount of non-target protein.\n\nPreferably the signal obtained from target proteins) will be at least about five fold, preferably 10 fold, more preferably 25-fold, even more preferably 50-fold, and most preferably 100-fold or more, greater than that obtained from an equivalent amount of non-target protein.\n\n[0041] The term \"target protein\" as used herein refers to one or more protein(s), a residue of which specifically reacts with, and becomes covalently labeled by, one or more TAPPs. Preferred targets are kinases generally classified under the Enzyme Commission number 2.7.1.X. Particularly preferred kinases are protein kinases, classified under the Enzyme Commission number 2.7.1.37. The reaction mixture can provide conditions under which the TAPP(s) react substantially preferentially with functional target proteins, preferably functional target kinases. Particularly preferred target kinases include .\n\nphosphorylase b kinase; glycogen synthase a kinase; hydroxyalkyl-protein kinase;\n\nserine(threonine) protein kinase; A-kinase; AP50 kinase; ATP-protein transphosphorylase;\n\n[3IIfI~C; [3-andrenergic receptor kinase; calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase;\n\ncalcium-dependent protein kinase C; CAMP-dependent protein kinase A; CAMP-dependent protein kinase; casein kinase; casein kinase I; casein kinase II; casein kinase 2; cGMP-dependent protein kinase; CIA-2; CI~I; CI~II; cyclic monophosphate-dependent protein kinase; cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase; cyclic AMP-dependent protein lcinase A;\n\ncyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase; cyclin-dependent kinase; cytidine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-responsive protein kinase; s PI~C; glycogen synthase kinase; Hpr kinase;\n\nhydroxyalkyl-protein kinase; protein kinase (phosphorylating); casein kinase (phosphorylating); MAPK; mitogen-activated protein kinase; mitogen-activated S6 kinase;\n\nM phase-specific cdc2 kinase; p82 kinase; phosphorylase b kinase; PKA; PKC;\n\nprotein serine kinase; protein kinase A; protein kinase p58; protein phosphokinase;\n\nprotein glutamyl kinase; protein serine-threonine kinase; protein kinase CK2; protein-aspartyl kinase;\n\nprotein-cysteine kinase; protein-serine kinase; Raf kinase; Raf 1; ribosomal S6 protein kinase; ribosomal protein S6 kinase II; serine kinase; serine-specific protein kinase; serine protein kinase; serine/threonine protein kinase; T-antigen kinase; threonine-specific protein kinase; twitchin kinase; and type-2 casein kinase.\n\n[0042] The term \"functional target protein\" refers to a target protein that is in its native conformation and is able to interact with an entity with which it normally interacts, e.g. enzyme with substrate and/or cofactor, receptor with ligand, etc., e.g.\n\nphosphorylated active form as compared to unphosphorylated inactive form and vice versa.\n\nPreferably, the functional target protein is in the form in which it can carry out its biological function.\n\n[0043] The term \"inactivated\" as used herein refers to a sample that has been treated so that at least a portion of target proteins) that were functional in the original sample are rendered unable to interact with those entities with which it normally interacts. For example, an \"inactive nucleotide binding protein\" can result from various mechanisms such as denaturation, inhibitor binding, either covalently or non-covalently, mutation, secondary processing, e.g. phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, etc.\n\n[0044] The term \"untreated\" as used herein refers to a sample that has not been exposed to one or more conditions as compared to a second sample not exposed to such conditions. An untreated sample may be a sample that has not been inactivated;\n\nalternatively, an untreated sample may be one not exposed to one or more molecules (e.g., drug lead compounds) in a screening assay. Thus the compositions and methods described herein may comprise comparing a complex protein mixture obtained from cell(s), tissue(s), or organisms) treated with one or more compounds (e.g., lead compounds in drug discovery) to a complex protein mixture obtained from cell(s), tissue(s), or organisms) not so treated. TAPP-labeled proteins and/or peptides from the two samples may be compared for relative signal intensity. Such methods may indicate alterations in active protein content due to the treatment regimen. Additionally, such methods can also differentiate between treatments that act by direct inhibition of specific proteins (\"primary effects\") versus treatments that affect active protein content upstream, e.g., by altering expression of proteins) (\"secondary effects\").\n\n[0045] As used herein, the term \"purified\" in reference to labeled target proteins or polypeptides does not require absolute purity. Instead, it represents an indication that the labeled target proteins or polypeptides are relatively more pure than in the environment in which the proteins or polypeptides were labeled. A \"purified\" labeled target protein or polypeptide is preferably at least 10% pure. A \"substantially purified\"\n\nlabeled target protein or polypeptide is preferably at least 50% pure, more preferably at least 75%\n\npure, and most preferably at least 95% pure.\n\n[0046] An \"active site\" of a protein refers to an area on the surface of a protein, e.g., an enzyme molecule or surface membrane receptor, to which a binding molecule, e.g.\n\nsubstrate, reciprocal ligand, allosteric modulator, ete., is bound and results in a change in the protein and/or ligand. For a receptor, the conformation may change, the protein may become susceptible to phosphorylation or dephosphorylation or other processing. For the most part, the active site will be the sites) of an enzyme where the substrate and/or a cofactor bind, where the substrate and cofactor undergo a catalytic reaction;\n\nwhere two proteins form a complex, e.g. the site at which a G protein binds to a surface membrane receptor, two kringle structures bind, sites at which transcription factors bind to other proteins; or sites at which proteins bind to specific nucleic acid sequences, etc. The skilled artisan will understand that an active site need not be presently performing a catalytic function, but may still bind a TAPP. For example, numerous kinases may bind to adenine nucleotides, but the catalytic function of the kinase may be inhibited due to phosphorylation state, etc.\n\n[0047] Structure of TAPPs [0048] The term \"tagged acyl phosphate probes\" or \"TAPPs\" refers to molecules having the following general structure:\n\nO O\n\nTAG L C O P X\n\nO-[0049] wherein TAG is a detectable label, L is a linker moiety covalently botmd to the carbonyl through a carbon atom, and X is an affinity moiety for directing the binding of a TAPP to a set of target proteins. A detailed description of a design strategy that can be adapted to the preparation of TAPPs in which a fluorescent moiety can act as a TAG is provided in PCT Application No. PCT/LTS02/03808, entitled \"Activity used Probe Analysis\" (Attorney Docket No. 063391-0202), filed February 5, 2002, PCT\n\nApplication No. PCT/LJS00/34187, ~~ 01/77684, entitled \"Proteomic AW alysis,\" and PCT\n\nApplication No. PCT/IJS00/34167, W~ 01/77668, entitled \"Proteomic Analysis,\" each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, including all tables, figures, and claims.\n\nGoals of a design strategy are to provide NBAPs that are able to react covalently with a targeted group of nucleotide binding protein(s), while minimizing non-specific labeling.\n\n[0050] The term acyl refers to the structure:\n\nO\n\nR C-----where the carbonyl carbon is bound to a carbon in R.\n\n[0051] The term \"linker moiety\" refers to a bond or chain of atoms used to link one moiety to another, serving as a covalent linkage between two or more moieties.\n\nSince in many cases, the synthetic strategy will be able to include a functionalized site for linking, the functionality can be taken advantage of in choosing the linking moiety.\n\nThe choice of linker moiety may alter the specificity of a TAPP. See, e.g., I~idd et al., Biochemistry (2001) 40: 4005-15. For example, an alkylene linker moiety and a linker moiety comprising a repeating alkyleneoxy structure (polyethylene glycols, or \"PEG\"), have distinct specificities and provide distinct protein profiles. Thus, one of skill in the art can select the linker moiety of the TAPP in order to provide additional specificity of the TAPP for a particular protein or protein class.\n\n[0052] Linker moieties include among others, ethers, polyethers, diamines, ether diamines, polyether diamines, amides, polyamides, polythioethers, disulfides, silyl ethers, alkyl or alkenyl chains (straight chain or branched and portions of which may be cyclic) aryl, diaryl or alkyl-aryl groups, having from 0 to 3 sites of aliphatic unsaturation. V~hile normally amino acids and oligopeptides are not preferred, when used they will normally employ amino acids of from 2 - 3 carbon atoms, i.e. glycine and alanine. Aryl groups in linker moieties can contain one or more heteroatoms (e.g., N, ~ or S atoms).\n\nThe linker moieties, when other than a bond, will have from about 1 to 60 atoms, usually 1 to 30 atoms, where the atoms include C, N, ~, S, P, etc., particularly C, N and ~, and will generally have from about 1 to 12 carbon atoms and from about 0 to 8, usually 0 to 6 heteroatoms. The number of atoms referred to above are exclusive of hydrogen in referring to the number of atoms in a group, unless indicated otherwise.\n\n[0053] Linker moieties may be varied widely depending on their function, including alkyleneoxy and polyalkyleneoxy groups, where alkylene is of from 2 - 3 carbon atoms, methylene and polymethylene, polyamide, polyester, and the like, where individual monomers will generally be of from 1 to 6, more usually 1 to 4 carbon atoms.\n\nThe oligomers will generally have from about 1 to 10, more usually 1 to 8 monomeric units.\n\nThe monomeric units may be amino acids, both naturally occurring and synthetic, oligonucleotides, both naturally occurring and synthetic, condensation polymer monomeric units and combinations thereof.\n\n[0054] Linker moieties provide a covalent linkage between a TAG and the carbonyl of the aryl group; thus, the final atom of the linker moiety that is covalently linked to the carbonyl must be carbon. A linker moiety may form a branching structure, whereby additional groups, such as a second TAG, may be included in the TAPP\n\nstructure.\n\n[0055] The term \"TAG\" as used herein refers to a molecule that can be used to detect and/or capture the TAPP in combination with any other moieties that axe bound strongly to the TAG, so as to be retained in the process of the reaction of the reactive group with the target active protein. The TAG may be added to the linker moiety combination after reaction ~f the aryl-nucleotide with the target protein, to form the complete TAPP.\n\nFor this purpose, the linker moiety will include a chemically reactive group, normally not found in proteins, that will react with a reciprocal functionality on the TAG, e.g. viccinal-diols with boronic acid, photoactivated groups, such as diazo, aide with an alkene or alkyne, o-alkyl hydroxylamine with a ketone or aldehyde, etc. The TAG portion permits capture of the conjugate of the target protein and the TAPP. The TAG may be displaced from the capture reagent by addition of a displacing TAG, which may be free TAG or a derivative of the TAG, or by changing solvent (e.g., solvent type or pH) or temperature or the linker may be cleaved chemically, enzymatically, thermally or photochemically to release the isolated materials (see discussion of the linker moiety, below).\n\n[0056] Examples of TAGS include, but are not limited to, detectable labels such as fluorescent moieties and electrochemical labels, biotin, digoxigenin, maltose, oligohistidine, 2,4-dintrobenzene, phenylarsenate, ssDNA, dsDNA, a polypeptide, a metal chelate, a saccharide, and/or a solid phase. Examples of TAGS and their capture reagents also include but are not limited to: dethiobiotin or structurally modified biotin-based reagents, including deiminobiotin, which bind to proteins of the avidin/streptavidin family, which may, for example, be used in the forms of strepavidin-Agarose, oligomeric-avidin-Agarose, or monomeric-avidin-Agarose; any vicinal diols, such as 1,2-dihydroxyethane (HO-OH), and other 1,2-dihyroxyalkanes including those of cyclic alkanes, e.g., 1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane which bind to an alkyl or aryl boronic acid or boronic acid esters, such as phenyl-B(OH)Z or hexyl-B(OEthyl)Z which may be attached via the alkyl or aryl group to a solid support material, such as Agarose; maltose which binds to maltose binding protein (as well as any other sugar/sugar binding protein pair or more generally to any TAG/TAG binding protein pairs that has properties discussed above); a hapten, such as the dinitrophenyl group, to which an antibody can be generated; a TAG which binds to a transition metal, for example, an oligomeric histidine will bind to Ni(II), the transition metal capture reagent may be used in the form of a resin bound chelated transition metal, such as nitrilotriacetic acid-chelated Ni(II) or iminodiacetic acid-chelated Ni(II);\n\nglutathione which binds to glutathione-S-transferase. In preferred embodiment, the TAGS will be haptens that bind to a naturally occurring receptor, e.g. biotin and avidin, or an antibody or will be a detectable label, that is also a hapten.\n\n[0057] One may use chemical affinity resins, e.g. metal chelates, to allow for digestion of proteins on the solid phase resin and facilitate automation. One example of this is the use of immobilized nickel (II) chelates to purify peptides that have six consecutive histidine residues (His-6 tag) (as described in the Invitrogen product brochureProBond TM\n\nResin (Purification) Catalog nos. 8801-O1, 8801-15 Version D 000913 28-0076), which could be adapted to include non-peptidic chemical linkage coupling a series of imidazole-containing moieties. Alternative chemical attachments include phenyldiboronic acids (described in Bergseid, M. et al. Biotechniques (2000) 29(5), 1126-1133), and disulfide reagents (described in Daniel, SM et al., Biotechniques (1998) 24(3), 484-489).\n\nAdditionally, chemical affinity tags that are useful in combinatorial synthesis could be adapted for modified peptide purification (reviewed in Porco, JA (2000) Comb.\n\nChem. High Throughput Screening 3(2) 93-102 [0058] The term \"fluorescent moiety\" (\"Fl\") refers to a TAG that can be excited by electromagnetic radiation, and that emits electromagnetic radiation in response in an amount sufficient to be detected in an assay. The skilled artisan will understand that a fluorescent moiety absorbs and emits over a number of wavelengths, referred to as an \"absorbance spectrum\" and an \"emission spectrum.\" A fluorescent moiety will exhibit a peak emission wavelength that is a longer wavelength than its peak absorbance wavelength.\n\nThe term \"peak\" refers to the highest point in the absorbance or emission spectrum.\n\n[0059] The fluorescent moiety Fl may be varied widely depending upon the protocol to be used, the number of different TAPPs employed in the same assay, whether a single or plurality of lanes are used in the electrophoresis, the availability of excitation and detection devices, and the like. For the most part, the fluorescent moieties that are employed as TAG\n\nwill absorb in the ultraviolet, infrared, and/or most preferably in the visible range and emit in the ultraviolet, infrared, and/or most preferably in the visible range.\n\nAbsorption will generally be in the range of about 250 to 750 nm and emission will generally be in the range of about 350 to 800nm. Illustrative fluorescent moieties include xanthene dyes, naphthylamine dyes, coumarins, cyanine dyes and metal chelate dyes, such as fluorescein, rhodamine, rosamine, the BODIPY dyes (FL, TMR, and TR), dansyl, lanthanide cryptates, erbium. terbium and ruthenium chelates, e.g. squarates, and the like.\n\nAdditionally, in certain embodiments, one or more fluorescent moieties can be energy transfer dyes such as those described in Waggoner et al., U.S. Patent no. 6,008,373. The literature amply describes methods for linking fluorescent moieties through a wide variety of linker moieties to other groups. The fluorescent moieties that find use will normally be under 2kDal, usually under lkDal.\n\n[0060] Preferred fluorescent moieties Fl can include elaborated conjugated pyran molecules, including xanthenes. Such molecules include eosin, erythrosin, fluorescein, Oregon green, and various commercially available Alexa Fluor ~ dyes (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Structural examples of such dyes include:\n\nH03S ~ ~ (CHz)o-\"-COOH\n\nHO\n\n[0061] Particularly preferred fluorescent moieties are the rhodamine dyes.\n\nThese molecules typically have the general structure:\n\nY\n\nZ Z\n\n[0062] Where K is -COZH, or -S03H; Y is -H, -CH3, or together with R forms a six-membered ring; Z is -H or together with R forms a six-membered ring; and R is H, -CH3, -CH2CH3, or together with Y or Z forms a six-membered ring. Rhodamine molecules such as tetramethylrhodamine, 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, carboxyrhodamine-6G, rhodamine-B sulfonyl chloride, rhodamine-red-X, and carboxy-X-rhodamine are well known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products, Molecular Probes, Inc., 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Advantageous properties of rhodamines include high quantum yields, low sensitivity of fluorescence over a pH range of from about pH 3 to about pH 8, advantageous water solubility, good photostability, and absorption of light in the visible spectrum. Particularly preferred fluorescers are 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine.\n\n[0063] Other preferred fluorescent moieties Fl include the BODIPY dyes, which are elaborations of a 4-bore-3a,4~a-dia~a-s-indacene structure. Exemplary structures are provided below:\n\n~~(CHz)o-aCQOH\n\n/N\\ /N\\ /N\\ /N\\\n\nB B\n\n(CFIz)o-aCOOH CBHs F~ \\F\n\n[0064] Yet other preferred fluorescent moieties include the cyanine dyes, conjugated structures comprising a polymethine chain terminating in nitrogen atoms.\n\nTypically, the nitrogens are themselves part of a conjugated heterocycle. An exemplary structures is provided below:\n\nFI or or H\n\n[0065] Also of interest for use as TAGs are matched dyes as described in U.S.\n\nPatent No. 6,127,134, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, including all tables, figures, and claims, which is concerned with labeling proteins with dyes that have different emissions, but have little or no effect on relative migration of labeled proteins in an electrophoretic separation. ~f particular interest are the cyanine dyes disclosed therein, being selected in '134 because of their positive charge, which matches the lysine to which the cyanine dyes bind. In addition there is the opportunity to vary the polyena spacer between cyclic ends, while keeping the molecular weight about the same with the introduction of an alkyl group in the shorter polyene chain dye to offset the longer polyene.\n\nAlso described are the ~~I)IP~ dyes, which lack a charge. The advantage of having two dyes that similarly affect the migration of the protein would be present when comparing the native and inactived samples, although this would require that in the inactivated sample at least a portion of the protein is monosubstituted.\n\n[0066] In each of the foregoing examples of preferred fluorescent moieties, carboxyl groups can provide convenient attachment sites for linker moieties. In the particularly preferred 5- and 6-carboxyrhodamine molecules, the 5- or 6- carboxyl is particularly preferred as an attachment site:\n\nY\n\nCOOH / COOH\n\nO\n\nO ;O\n\nO\n\nWhile the following preferred embodiments and exemplified compounds are generally described using only the 5-carboxyrhodalnine molecules for the sake of brevity, in each case the 6-carboxyrhodamine version of the indicated molecule, or a mixture of the 5- and 6- carboxyrhodamine molecules should also be considered as an exemplified preferred e111bodlnlent.\n\n[0067] In general, any affinity label-capture reagent commonly used for affinity enrichment, which meets the suitability criteria discussed above, can be used in the method of the invention. Biotin and biotin-based affinity TAGs are particularly illustrated herein.\n\nOf particular interest are structurally modified biotins, such as deiminobiotin or dethiobiotin, which will elute from avidin or streptavidin (strept/avidin) columns with biotin or under solvent conditions compatible with ESI-MS analysis, such as dilute acids containing 10-20% organic solvent. For example, deiminobiotin tagged compounds will elute in solvents below about pH 4.\n\n[006] In certain embodiments, TAPPs can be immobilized on a solid phase to form a \"tethered\" TAPP in which the TAG is represented by the solid phase. In preferred embodiments, a plurality of different TAPPs may be tethered to different regions of one or more solid phases to form a patterned array. Such a patterned array having two or more regions comprising TAPPs that differ in structure andlor reactivities from each other could be used to simultaneously measure the presence, amount, or activity of a plurality of target nucleotide binding proteins. The term \"solid phase\" as used herein refers to a wide variety of materials including solids, semi-solids, gels, films, membranes, meshes, felts, composites, particles, and the like typically used by those of skill in the art to sequester molecules. The solid phase can be non-porous or porous. Suitable solid phases include those developed and/or used as solid phases in solid phase binding assays. See, e.g., chapter 9 of Immunoassay, E. P. I~iamandis and T. I~. Christopoulos eels., Academic Press:\n\nNew York, 1996, hereby incorporated by reference. Examples of suitable solid phases include membrane filters, cellulose-based papers, beads (including polymeric, latex, glass, and paramagnetic particles), glass, silicon wafers, microparticles, nanoparticles, TentaGels, AgroGels, PEGA gels, SP~CC gels, and multiple-well plates.

Lett. 11: 2997 (2001).\n\n[0069] The specificity and affinity of a TAPP may be affected by the choice of the affinity moiety, the linker moiety, the TAG, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the affinity moiety X may be deleted; in these embodiments, L can provide an affinity moiety either inherently in its own structure, or by means of a branched L linking both a TAG and a separate affinity moiety. One or more TAPPs may be designed that exhibit specificity for a single target protein, or that exhibit specificity for a plurality of targets that may be structurally or functionally related.\n\n[0070] TAPPs ofthe present invention may comprise any affinity moiety that directs a TAPP to target proteins of interest. Suitable affinity moieties include small molecules, such as combinatorial libraries or therapeutic lead compounds;\n\nhormones, such as steroids, peptide hormones, etc.; cofactors; vitamins; enzyme substrates;\n\nlipids;\n\nprostaglandins; receptor ligands; nucleotides and nucleotide analogues, optionally substituted naphthyl groups, etc. As used herein, the term \"small molecule\"\n\nrefers to compounds having molecular mass of less than 3000 Daltons, preferably less than 2000 or 1500, still more preferably less than 1000, and most preferably less than 600 Daltons.\n\nExemplary alternative affinity moieties are shown in Fig. 5. All that is required of an affinity moiety is that it comprises an available alcohol for attachment of the aryl phosphate; or an available carbon atom for attachment of the acyl phosphonate.\n\n[0071] Exemplary acyl nucleotide NBAPs [0072] Exemplary TAPPs described in detail below are those in which the affinity moiety N is selected to provide an aryl-nucleotide structure. Referred to herein by the team \"nucleotide binding protein-directed affinity probes\" (\"NBAPs\"), these preferred TAPPs comprise a nucleotide or nucleotide anlogue covalently bound through the terminal phosphate of a 5' mono- di- or tri-phosphate (or 2' or 3' mono-, di-, or tri-phosphate) to an acyl group, which is itself further covalently bound to a TAG via a linker moiety.\n\n[0073] The term \"nucleotide\" as used herein refers to a purine or pyrimidine base linked glycosidically to ribose, 2' or 3' deoxyribose, or 2',3' dideoxyribose;\n\nand which comprise a 5' mono- di- or tri-phosphate. Preferred bases include adenine, thymine, uracil, guanine, cytosine, and inosine. Nonnaturally occurring bases such as 5-bromouracil, 5-fluorouracil, 2-aminopurine, N6-cyclohexyl adenine, l,lV6-ethenoadenosine; 8-azaguanine, and 5-fluorocytosine are also well known in the art. This list is not meant to be limiting, and any purine or pyrimidine base is within the scope of the present invention.\n\nThe general structure of nucleotides is as follows:\n\nnucleotide monophposphate O O\n\n-O-~~-O ~~-O-CHZ BASE\n\n- O~ nucleotide diphposphate ~3 ~2 -O-P-O-P-O-P-O\n\n~- ~- ~' nucleotide triphposphate [0074] where RZ~ and R3~ are independently H or OH, and where BASE is a purine or pyrimidine.\n\n[0075] The term \"nucleotide analogue\" as used herein refers to a nucleotide-like structure in which the purine or pyrimidine BASE is replaced with a non-purine or non-pyrimidine structure (e.g., substituted or unsubstituted triazine, pyridazine, pyrazine, pyrrolopyrimidine, or pyrrazolopyrimidine); in which the ribose is replaced with a non-ribose structure; in which the oxygen lying between adjacent phosphates is replaced (e.g., with NH, S, or methylene); in which RZ~ and R3~ are other than H or OH or in which the 2~\n\nphosphate moiety or moieties is at the R2~ or R3. position; and which binds to a nucleotide binding site of at least one nucleotide binding protein. See, e.g., U.S.\n\nPatents 6,255,292;\n\n6,043,060; and 5,215,970.\n\n[0076] The term \"BASE\" as used herein refers to a S- or 6-membered unsaturated heterocyclic ring comprising from 1 to 3 utrogen heteroatoms; attached through a ring heteroatom to the 1' position of a ribose, wherein the 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring may comprise a 6-membered unsaturated carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring comprising from 1 to 2 nitrogen heteroatoms. Each carbon position in the BASE may be optionally substituted by a substituent independently selected from the group consisting of -H, -F, -Br, -Cl, -SCH3, -C(O)N(R)(R), -CN, -NOZ, -N(R)(R), =O, acetoxy, -C(R)(R)(R), -OCH3, -OCHZCH3, methylene dioxy, trihalomethyl, trihalomethoxy, or -(CHZ)\"OH, where each R is independently H or -C1_6 alkyl straight or branched chain, and n is 0-6.\n\nExemplary BASE\n\nstructur es are shown in Fig. 4.\n\n[0077] In preferred embodiments, a nucleotide or nucleotide analogue of the present invention comprises a base (preferably a substituted or unsubstituted purine or pyrimidine) linked glycosidically to ribose, and R2~ and R3. are independently selected from the group consisting of -H, -OH, -F, -Br, -Cl, -SCH3, -C(O)N(R)(R), -CN, -NOa, -N(R)(R), benzoyl, benzoylbenzoyl, azido, acetoxy, -C(R)(R)(R), -OCH3, -OCH2CH3, methylene dioxy, trihalomethyl, trihalomethoxy, -(CHa)\"OH, or -(CH2)ri phenyl where phenyl is optionally substituted with -F, -Br, -Cl, -SCH3, -C(O)N(R)(R), -CN, -NO2, -N(R)(R), acetoxy, -C(R)(R)(R), -OCH3, -OCH2CH3, methylene dioxy, trihalomethyl, trihalomethoxy, -(CHZ)\"OH; where each R is independently H or -C1_6 alkyl straight or branched chain, or optionally form an optionally substituted fused carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring structure, and n is 0-6, or where one of R2~ and R3. comprises a phosphate moiety or moieties, e.g., a mono-, di-, or tri-phosphate moiety as is linked at the ribose 5'-position in conventional nucleotide mono-, di-, and tri-phosphates respectively as illustrated above.\n\n[0078] In preferred embodiments, the NBAP(s) of the present invention have one of the following general formulae:\n\nTAG-L-II-O-II Z- O-CHZ BASE\n\nO\n\nO- O-I\n\nR3 R~\n\n[0079] Preferably, each RZ~ and R3~ is independently selected from the group consisting of -H, -~H, -F, -Br, -Cl, -SCH3, -C(~)IV(R)(R), -CIV, -~T~2, -N(R)(R), acetoxy, -C(R)(R)(R), -~CH3, -~CH2CH3, methylene dioxy, trihalomethyl, trihalomethoxy, -(CH2)\"~H, or -(CH2)\"-phenyl where phenyl is optionally substituted with -F, -Br, -Cl, -3, - (~)N(R)(R>, - , - 2, -N(R)(R>, a~et~~y, -C(R)(R)(R)7 ~CH3, -~CH2CH~7 methylene dio~y, trihalomethyl, trihalomethoxy, -(CH2)\"~H; and each R2. and R3~ are most preferably independently H or ~H;\n\n[0080] each Z is independently ~, S, NH, or methylene;\n\n[0081] n is between 0 and 6 inclusive;\n\n[0082] BASE is a substituted or unsubstituted purine, pyrmidine, triazine, pyridazine, pyrazine, pyrrolopyrimidine, orpyrrazolopyrimidine, and is most preferably selected from the group consisting of include adenine, thymine, uracil, guanine, cytosine, and inosine;\n\n[0083] TAG is a detectable label or solid phase;\n\n[0084] L is an optionally present alkyl or heteroalkyl groups of 1-40, 1-30, or 1-20 backbone atoms selected from the group consisting of -N(R)-, -O-, -S- or -C(R)(R)-, which may include a carbocyclic or heterocyclic moiety, e.g., a triazole ring; and [0085] each R is independently H or -C1_6 alkyl straight or branched chain, or optionally form an optionally substituted fused carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring structure.\n\n[0086] 111 certain embodiments, the NBAP(s) are as described for the immediately preceding structure, except that the moiety shown above attached at the ribose 5' carbon is instead attached at R~,~ or R3~, and is replaced at the ribose 5' carbon with a group RS~.

The use of such click chemistry in the preparation of certain activity-based probes is described in Shreder et al., International Application PCT/LJS03/07898, WO 03/079014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, including drawings. Additional useful descriptions of \"click chemistry\" are available, for example, in I~olb et al., Agraew Clzerra. Irat. Ed. Efzgl. 40:\n\n2004-21 (2001); Seo et al., .I. ~yg. C'herrt. 68: 609-12 (2003), both of which are incorporated herein in their entireties.\n\n[0091 ] An exemplary triazole linker moiety formed using \"click chemistry\" is shown below. The first structure shows the linker extending to the nitrogens that further link the dye and the acyl phosphate/affmity moieties. The second structure is focused on the formation of the triazole ring, for example, using an azide/alkyne reaction.\n\n[0092] Another example of ligation chemistry that has been applied to proteomic samples and is useful in forming the present probes is the Staudinger reaction between a phosphine and an azide (Bertozzi et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125: 4708-4709 (2003)) which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In this reaction a stable amide bond is formed between the two components.

The TAPPs may be analyzed by separating into components, e.g., by electrophoresis, for example gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis or microfluidic electrophoresis; mass spectrometry, e.g., MALDI-TOF, microcapillary liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem MS, or other technique. To enhance the analysis, the conjugates may be deglycosylated using an appropriate glycosidase, such as PGNaseF, under conventional deglycosylation conditions indicated by the enzyme supplier. Labeled target proteins can be identified based on a variety of physical criteria, such as apparent molecular weight, peptide sequence composition, enzymatic activity (e.g., kinase activity), or a combination of such criteria.\n\n[0098] The term \"separating\" as used herein refers to methods that enrich the concentration of a molecule of interest in a particular location or container relative to other molecules originally present. For example, gel electrophoresis enriches the concentration of molecules that migrate at a particular rate relative to other molecules originally present that migrate at different rates; sequestration methods enrich the concentration of molecules capable of being sequestered (e.g., by binding to a receptor) relative to other molecules not so capable (e.g., removed by washing out molecules that do not bind to a receptor).\n\nNumerous additional analytical procedures are known to the artisan for separating and analyzing complex protein mixtures (e.g., chromatographic methods such as HPLC, FPLC, ion exchange, size exclusion; mass spectrometry; differential centrifugation).\n\n[0099] In preferred embodiments, the TAPP-labeled products are analyzed by electrophoresis, e.g., slab gel, capillary or microfluidic, optionally using a gel for separation of the different components. In particularly preferred embodiments, SDS-PAGE\n\nis used, including 2D PAGE. The sample composition may be preliminarily separated using isoelectric focusing, followed by using bands or regions for further electrophoretic separation. Conventional conditions can be employed for the electrophoresis, using a denaturing medium, so that the active sample and the inactivated sample are both denatured in the gel. Numerous patents have issued for performing electrophoresis for the separation of proteins. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,415,655; 4,481,094; 4,865,707; and 4,946,794.\n\nTexts describing procedures include Laemmli, Nature 227:680-685 (1970);\n\nSambrook et al., \"Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.\" 3rd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. (2001).\n\n[00100] Using the TAPPs of the present invention, labeled target proteins) may be identified by excitation and detection of light emitted upon excitation of the fluorescent moiety, e.g., in electrophoresis gels. In certain embodiments, such as when the TAPP labels a plurality of target proteins or when the identity of a labeled target protein is unknown, the labeled target proteins) present in various electophoretic bands may be further assayed to identify the specific proteins to which the TAPP(s) bound, e.g., by fragmentation and mass spectrometric analysis. In particular, the sequence of proteins can be determined using tandem MS (MS\") techniques. By application of sequence database searching techniques, the protein from which a sequenced peptide originated can be identified.\n\nExemplary methods for performing such analyses are described in U.S. Patent Application hTo.\n\n601446,960, entitled \"Macromolecule Identification Made by Mass Spectroscopy and Database Searching,\" filed February 11, 2003, Atty Docket No. 11267-003-888, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, including all tables, figures, and claims.\n\n[00101] In designing a gel-based analysis system, the artisan may balance various considerations, such as speed, resolution, sample volume, choice of fluorophore, detection methods, etc., in order to arrive at an optimal solution. For example, for simple screening analysis (i.e., when gel bands are not to be identified by means of eluting proteins from the gel matrix for further analysis), very thin gels may be run quickly.\n\nAdditionally, such thin gels are amenable to the use of laser-induced fluorescence scanning systems and narrow gel lanes, as laser focusing and confocal detection optics permit the detection of very small amounts of TAPP-labeled protein in a sample. Conversely, thicker gels may be advantageous in protein identification analysis, as a sufficient amount of material must be obtained from a gel band to permit further manipulations.\n\n[00102] For rapid screening analysis, a suitable gel electrophoresis platform would consist of a glass sandwich gel format of from 15-40 cm in width, 20-40 cm in length, and from 0.6 to 0.2 cm in thickness. A partciularly preferred format is from about 30-35 cm in width, about 25-30 cm in length, and about 0.4 mm in thickness. The term \"about\" in this context refers to +/- 10% of a given dimension. The gel format is preferably combined with a laser-induced fluorescence detector apparatus comprising detection optics that permit sampling of the gel without removal from the gel plates, as such thin gels may be extremely fragile. Typically, such an instrument uses confocal optics for detection. By matching the thickness of the gel to the thickness of the confocal \"slice,\" signal detection can be matched to a minimal amount of sample.\n\n[00103] The spacing between sample wells is limited only by the amount of sample necessary to obtain a sufficient signal for measurement. Appropriate spacings are between 1 and 4 mm, most preferably about 2.25-3 mm. The term \"about\" in this context refers to +/-10% of the spacing between wells. Selecting a spacing between wells of about 2.25 mm as an example, a gel platform 25 cm in width could accommodate as many as 96 individual samples.\n\n[00104] After completing the electropherogram, the bands may then be read using any convenient detection means (e.g., a fluorescent reader, e.g., Hitachi FMbio Flatbed Fluorescence Scanner, when the TAPP comprises a fluorescent moiety), where the intensity of each band may be transferred to a data processor for processing. Depending on whether one or more lanes are involved with the analysis, the data may be compiled from a single or multiple lanes to establish the bands associated with active target proteins that are absent with the inactive sample, the different target proteins that reacted with different TAPPs as evidenced by the different fluorescence emission for each of the TAPPs, and any cross-reactivity between the TAPPs. The bands that are obtained in the gel are sharp and provide for excellent resolution. Particularly, much better resolution and sensitivity may be obtained than when biotin-labeled TAPPs are used, followed by complex formation with labeled avidin, and Western blotting.\n\n[00105] The results obtained from analyzing the nucleotide binding protein profiles may then be organized in a manner that allows for ready comparisons and differentiation between samples. One technique that finds utility is cluster analysis. One applies a hierarchical clustering algorithm to the samples using the Pearson correlation coefficient as the measure of similarity and average linking clustering (Cluster program:\n\nRoss et al., Nat.\n\nGenet. 24:227-35 (2000); Eisen et al., PfÂ°oc. Natl. Aead. Sci. USA\n\n95:14863-68 (1998)). For each enzyme activity, averaged cell sample values are compared to identify the cell sample that expressed the highest level of a particular enzyme activity. The activity levels may then be expressed as a percentage of this highest activity to normalize the data sets. As data sets are built up from cell samples, the cluster analysis can be modified in light of new data that provides a new maximum for a particular enzyme, so that one may have cluster analysis within a given group of samples as well as cluster analysis extending over many samples and groups of samples. Cluster analysis can also be applied as to the individual fractions and pair-wise combinations, so as to maximize information from the cell samples in relating the samples to each other and standards. For large numbers of samples, clustergrams can be used to rapidly identify the similarities between samples, for example, in terms of origin of the cells, aggressiveness and invasiveness, diagnosis, prognosis, preferential therapies and how the tumor has responded to a course of treatment.\n\n[00106] Following TAPP labeling of target nucleotide binding protein(s), protein digestion may be employed to produce both unlabeled and TAPP-labeled peptides.\n\nThe denaturant, and/or to provide suitable buffer conditions for digestion. In particularly preferred embodiments, buffer exchange is performed by gravity flow gel filtration.\n\n[00109] Digestion will be carried out in an aqueous buffered medium, generally at a pH in the range of about 4 to 10, depending on the requirements of the protease. The concentration of the protease will generally be in the range of about 6 x 10-g M to about 6 x 10-6 M, more preferably in the range of about 1.8 x 10-g M to about 2 x 10-~\n\nM, and most preferably about 6 x 10-~ M (e.g., 150 ng / 10 ~.L). The term \"about\" in this context means +/- 10% of a givem measurement. The time for the digestion will be sufficient to go to at least substantial completion, so that at least substantially all of the protein will have been digested. Digests may be performed at a temperature that is compatible with the protease(s) employed, preferably from 20Â°C to 40Â°C, most preferably about 37Â°C. Where the digestion takes place in solution, the protease may be quenched by any convenient means, including heating or acidification of the sample. Alternatively, quenching can be achieved by sequestering the fragment conjugates with a receptor for the TAG bound to a surface, or by addition of a protease inhibitor (e.g., E64, DIFP, PMSF, etc.). there the proteins are bound to a surface, the proteases may be washed away before the bound digested protein is released.\n\n[00110] Following protein digestion, peptides can be sequestered, e.g., by binding to receptors for the TAG of one or more TAPP-labeled peptides. Preferably, sequestration relies on receptors bound to a solid support that can be easily manipulated during wash steps. The support may be beads, including paramagnetic beads, prepared from various materials, such as Bioglas, polystyrene, polyacrylate, polymethylmethacrylate, polyethylene, polysaccharides, such as Agarose, cellulose, amylose, etc., polyurethane, and the like. Desirably, the support surface will not interfere with the binding of TAG to its cognate receptor, and the receptor may be linked to the support by a hydrophilic bridge that digestion may be performed wlule the proteins are in solution or when the conjugates are sequestered, e.g., by receptors bound to a solid support. Digestion preferably employs only one protease; however, two or more, usually not more than three, proteases may be used.\n\nThe proteases may be in solution or bound to a surface. The proteases may be combined in the same reaction mixture, or the sample may be divided into aliquots and each of the aliquots treated with a different protease. Digestion may also occur before binding to the conjugate to a support andlor a after the conjugates are bound to a solid support. Enzymes that find use include, but are not limited to, trypsin, chymotrypsin, bromelain, papain, carboxypeptidase A, B and Y, proteinase A and I~, chyrnopapain, plasmin, subtilisin, clostripain etc.\n\n[00107] In particularly preferred embodiments, additional steps can be used to reduce the complexity of the analysis to be performed. For example, the complex protein mixture can be denatured following labeling, e.g., by the addition of urea, guanidinium salts, detergents, organic solvents, etc., in order to reduce or eliminate unwanted proteolysis from endogenous proteases present in the mixture. Additionally, cysteine residues can be reduced and alkylated to maintain the homogeneity of cysteine-containing peptides and to prevent refolding of endogenous proteases following removal of the denaturant.\n\nMoreover, proteases can be combined with additional enzymes, such as glycosidases, phosphatases, sulfatases, etc., that can act to remove post-translational modifications from proteins.\n\nExamples of such post-translational modifications include, but are not limited to, glycosylations, phosphorylations, sulfations, prenylations, methylations, amidations, and myristolations. Such steps can be mixed and matched by the skilled artisan, depending on the requirements of a particular analysis.\n\n[0010] Prior to digestion, a buffer exchange step may be employed, e.g., by gel filtration, dialysis, etc. This step may be used to remove excess TAPPs, to remove allows for the receptor to be removed from the surface. When beads are employed, the beads will generally have a cross-dimension in the range of about 5 to 100~.m.\n\nInstead of beads, one may use solid supports, such as slides, the walls of vessels, e.g.\n\nmicrotiter well walls, capillaries, etc. There is an extensive literature of receptor bound supports that is readily applicable to this invention, since the sequestering step is conventional. The sample is contacted with the support for sufficient time, usually about 5 to 60 min, to allow all of the conjugate to become bound to the surface. At this time, all of the non-specifically bound components from the sample may be washed away, greatly enriching the target proteins as compared to the rest of the sample.\n\n[00111] Following separation by sequestration, TAPP-labeled peptides may then be released from the receptor. The particular method of release will depend upon the TAG-receptor pair. In some instances, one may use an analog of the TAG as a \"releasing agent\"\n\nto release the conjugate. This is illustrated by the use of deimino- or dethiobiotin as the TAG and biotin as the releasing agent. Where this is not convenient, as in the case of many fluorescent moieties as TAGs where there may not be a convenient analog, conditions such as high salt concentrations, chaeotropic agents (e.g., isothiocyanate or urea) low pH, detergents, organic solvents, etc., may be used to effect release. Once the conjugate has been released, dialysis, ion exchange resins, precipitation, or the like may be used to prepare the conjugate solution for the next stage.\n\n[00112] Where the migration rates in various separation procedures provide the necessary identification of the peptides) generated and, therefore, the protein from which they are obtained, no further analysis may be required. However, where further identification is desired or the earlier results do not provide certainty as to the identification and amount of a particular component, an identification method using mass spectrometry (MS) can be employed. See, for example, WO 00/1120. The use of mass spectrometry will be described below. Such identification methods potentially provide greater information, but requires greater sample size in comparison to, for example, capillary electrohoresis, and has a lower throughput.\n\n[00113] Chromatographic and/or electrophoretic separation methods as described herein may be used to simplify the mixtures introduced into the mass spectrometer, allowing for a more accurate analysis. For TAPP-labeled peptides, the use of fluorescent moieties as TAPP TAGs can permit the use of an online fluorescence detector to trigger ESI-MS data collection or fraction collection for subsequent analysis, e.g., providing sample on a MALI?I plate. In this way, only fractions and bands that contain TAPP-labeled peptides will be selected for further processing, thereby avoiding using the MS with certain fractions.\n\n[00114] In particularly preferred embodiments, the identification methods described herein can be combined with one or more separation methods to develop a \"separation profile\" that can be used to identify peptides without the need for MS\n\nanalysis. In these methods, a sample (e.g., material from a chromatography column) is divided into at least two portions9 one portion is used for MS analysis, and the other portions) are used for one or more separation methods (e.g., a single CE run, or two or more CE runs using different separation conditions). The peptide identification obtained from the MS\n\nanalysis can be assigned to the observed separation profile (e.g., the elution time of the peptide observed in the CE run(s)). ~bservation of this separation profile in subsequent samples can then be correlated to the peptide known to exhibit that separation profile.\n\n[00115] The identification methods described herein may also utilize TAPPs that differ isotopically in order to eWance the information obtained from MS\n\nprocedures. For example, using automated multistage MS, the mass spectrometer may be operated in a dual mode in which it alternates in successive scans between measuring the relative quantities of peptides obtained from the prior fractionation and recording the sequence information of the peptides. Peptides may be quantified by measuring in the MS mode the relative signal intensities for pairs of peptide ions of identical sequence that are tagged with the isotopically light or heavy forms of the reagent, respectively, and which therefore differ in mass by the mass differential encoded with the TAPP. Peptide sequence information may be automatically generated by selecting peptide ions of a particular mass-to-charge (fnlz) ratio for collision-induced dissociation (CID) in the mass spectrometer operating in the MS\"\n\nmode. (Link, et al., (1997) Electrophoresis 18:1314-34; Gygi, et al., (1999) idid 20:310-9;\n\nand Gygi et al., (1999) Mol. Cell. Biol. 19:1720-30). The resulting CID\n\nspectra may be then automatically correlated with sequence databases to identify the protein from which the sequenced peptide originated. Combination of the results generated by MS and MS\"\n\nanalyses of affinity tagged and differentially labeled peptide samples allows the determination of the relative quantities as well as the sequence identities of the components of protein mixtures.\n\n[00116] Protein identification by MS\" may be accomplished by correlating the sequence contained in the C~ mass spectnun with one or more sequence databases, e.~., using computer searching algorithms (Eng. et al. (1994) J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrum. 5:976-89; Mann, et al., (1994) Anal. Chem. 66:4390-99; Qin, et al., (1997) ibid 69:3995-4001;\n\nClauser, et al., (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:5072-76); see also, U.S.\n\nPatent Application No. 60/446,960, entitled \"Macromolecule Identification Made by Mass Spectroscopy and Database Searching,\" filed February 11, 2003, Atty Docket No.\n\n003-888. Pairs of identical peptides tagged with the light and heavy affinity tagged reagents, respectively (or in analysis of more than two samples, sets of identical tagged peptides in which each set member is differentially isotopically labeled) are chemically identical and therefore serve as mutual internal standards for accurate quantitation. The MS\n\nmeasurement readily differentiates between peptides originating from different samples, representing different cell states or other parameter, because of the difference between isotopically distinct reagents attached to the peptides. The ratios between the intensities of the differing weight components of these pairs or sets of peaks provide an accurate measure of the relative abundance of the peptides and the correlative proteins because the MS\n\nintensity response to a given peptide is independent of the isotopic composition of the reagents. The use of isotopically labeled internal standards is standard practice in quantitative mass spectrometry (De Leenheer, et al., (1992) Mass Spectrom.\n\nRev. 11:249-307).\n\n[00117] The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation.\n\n[0011 ~] In the following examples, iH-1VMR spectra were recorded using deuterated DMSO as the solvent mless otherwise indicated. Preparative HPLC was carried out on a reverse phase Polaris C1$ column (5 ~ column; 150 mm x 21 mm; Metachem/Ansys;\n\nTorrance, CA) using a binary system of water and acetoniti-ile with TFA as a modifier (water 0.1 %, acetonitrile 0.1 %). Analytical LC-MS was carried out on a Polaris C 1 ~\n\ncolumn (5 ~, column; 50 mm x 4.6 mm; Metachem/Ansys; Torrance, CA) using a binary system of water and acetonitrile with TFA as a modifier (water 0.1%, acetonitrile 0.1%).\n\nAll compounds were obtained from the Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, WI) unless indicated otherwise. Fmoc-4-(aminomethyl)benzoic acid was obtained from Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, Kentucky); the mixed 5- and 6-succinimidyl ester of tetramethylrhodamine was obtained from Molecular Probes (TAMRA-SE; Eugene, OR);\n\nand fluoroacetyl fluoride was obtained from ProChem, Inc (Rockford, IL).\n\n[00119] Example 1- Preparation of acyl-nucleotide NBAPs [00120] Exemplary general reaction schemes for the formation of acyl-nucleotide monophosphate NBAPs; and for the fomnation of acyl-nucleotide diphosphate and triphosphate NBAPs; are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.
