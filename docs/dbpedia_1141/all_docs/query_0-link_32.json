        "text": "In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), neurodegeneration is characterized by distal axonopathy that begins at the distal axons, including the neuromuscular junctions, and progresses proximally in a “dying back” manner prior to the degeneration of cell bodies. However, the molecular mechanism for distal axonopathy in ALS has not been fully addressed. Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), a repulsive axon guidance molecule that phosphorylates collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs), is known to be highly expressed in Schwann cells near distal axons in a mouse model of ALS. To clarify the involvement of Sema3A–CRMP signaling in the axonal pathogenesis of ALS, we investigated the expression of phosphorylated CRMP1 (pCRMP1) in the spinal cords of 35 patients with sporadic ALS and seven disease controls. In ALS patients, we found that pCRMP1 accumulated in the proximal axons and co-localized with phosphorylated neurofilaments (pNFs), which are a major protein constituent of spheroids. Interestingly, the pCRMP1:pNF ratio of the fluorescence signal in spheroid immunostaining was inversely correlated with disease duration in 18 evaluable ALS patients, indicating that the accumulation of pCRMP1 may precede that of pNFs in spheroids or promote ALS progression. In addition, overexpression of a phospho-mimicking CRMP1 mutant inhibited axonal outgrowth in Neuro2A cells. Taken together, these results indicate that pCRMP1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of axonopathy in ALS, leading to spheroid formation through the proximal progression of axonopathy.\n\nGlaucoma is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a cause of glaucoma. However, glaucoma often develops with normal IOP and is known as normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). Glutamate neurotoxicity is considered as one of the significant causes of NTG, resulting in excessive stimulation of retinal neurons via the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The present study examined the phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2), a protein that is abundantly expressed in neurons and involved in their development. In two mouse models, NMDA-injection and glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) mutant, CRMP2 phosphorylation at the cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (Cdk5) site was elevated in RGCs. We confirmed that the decrease in the number of RGCs and thickness of the inner retinal layer (IRL) could be suppressed after NMDA administration in CRMP2KI/KI mice with genetically inhibited CRMP2 phosphorylation. Next, we investigated GLAST heterozygotes (GLAST+/-) with CRMP2KI/KI (GLAST+/-;CRMP2KI/KI) and GLAST knockout (GLAST-/-) mice with CRMP2KI/KI (GLAST-/-;CRMP2KI/KI) mice and compared them with GLAST+/- and GLAST-/- mice. pCRMP2 (S522) inhibition significantly reduced RGC loss and IRL thinning. These results suggest that the inhibition of CRMP2 phosphorylation could be a novel strategy for treating NTG.\n\nThe mammalian cerebral cortex is characterized by a 6-layer structure, and proper neuronal migration is critical for its formation. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) has been shown to be a critical kinase for neuronal migration. Several Cdk5 substrates have been suggested to be involved in ordered neuronal migration. However, in vivo loss-of-function studies on the function of Cdk5 phosphorylation substrates in neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex have not been reported. In this study, we demonstrated that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of collapsing mediator protein (CRMP) 2 is critical for neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex with redundant functions of CRMP1 and CRMP4. The cerebral cortices of triple-mutant CRMP1 knock-out (KO); CRMP2 knock-in (KI)/KI; and CRMP4 KO mice showed disturbed positioning of layers II-V neurons in the cerebral cortex. Further experiments using bromodeoxyuridine birthdate-labeling and in utero electroporation implicated radial migration defects in cortical neurons. Ectopic neurons were detected around the CA1 region and dentate gyrus in CRMP1 KO; CRMP2 KI/KI; and CRMP4 KO mice. These results suggest the importance of CRMP2 phosphorylation by Cdk5 and redundancy of CRMP1 and CRMP4 in proper neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex and hippocampus.\n\nSince 1995, more than 100 transgenic (Tg) mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been generated in which mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) or APP/presenilin 1 (PS1) cDNA is overexpressed ( 1st generation models ). Although many of these models successfully recapitulate major pathological hallmarks of the disease such as amyloid β peptide (Aβ) deposition and neuroinflammation, they have suffered from artificial phenotypes in the form of overproduced or mislocalized APP/PS1 and their functional fragments, as well as calpastatin deficiency-induced early lethality, calpain activation, neuronal cell death without tau pathology, endoplasmic reticulum stresses, and inflammasome involvement. Such artifacts bring two important uncertainties into play, these being (1) why the artifacts arise, and (2) how they affect the interpretation of experimental results. In addition, destruction of endogenous gene loci in some Tg lines by transgenes has been reported. To overcome these concerns, single App knock-in mouse models harboring the Swedish and Beyreuther/Iberian mutations with or without the Arctic mutation (AppNL-G-F and AppNL-F mice) were developed ( 2nd generation models ). While these models are interesting given that they exhibit Aβ pathology, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment in an age-dependent manner, the model with the Artic mutation, which exhibits an extensive pathology as early as 6 months of age, is not suitable for investigating Aβ metabolism and clearance because the Aβ in this model is resistant to proteolytic degradation and is therefore prone to aggregation. Moreover, it cannot be used for preclinical immunotherapy studies owing to the discrete affinity it shows for anti-Aβ antibodies. The weakness of the latter model (without the Arctic mutation) is that the pathology may require up to 18 months before it becomes sufficiently apparent for experimental investigation. Nevertheless, this model was successfully applied to modulating Aβ pathology by genome editing, to revealing the differential roles of neprilysin and insulin-degrading enzyme in Aβ metabolism, and to identifying somatostatin receptor subtypes involved in Aβ degradation by neprilysin. In addition to discussing these issues, we also provide here a technical guide for the application of App knock-in mice to AD research. Subsequently, a new double knock-in line carrying the AppNL-F and Psen1 P117L/WT mutations was generated, the pathogenic effect of which was found to be synergistic. A characteristic of this 3rd generation model is that it exhibits more cored plaque pathology and neuroinflammation than the AppNL-G-F line, and thus is more suitable for preclinical studies of disease-modifying medications targeting Aβ. Furthermore, a derivative AppG-F line devoid of Swedish mutations which can be utilized for preclinical studies of β-secretase modifier(s) was recently created. In addition, we introduce a new model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy that may be useful for analyzing amyloid-related imaging abnormalities that can be caused by anti-Aβ immunotherapy. Use of the App knock-in mice also led to identification of the α-endosulfine-K ATP channel pathway as components of the somatostatin-evoked physiological mechanisms that reduce Aβ deposition via the activation of neprilysin. Such advances have provided new insights for the prevention and treatment of preclinical AD. Because tau pathology plays an essential role in AD pathogenesis, knock-in mice with human tau wherein the entire murine Mapt gene has been humanized were generated. Using these mice, the carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (CAPON) was discovered as a mediator linking tau pathology to neurodegeneration and showed that tau humanization promoted pathological tau propagation. Finally, we describe and discuss the current status of mutant human tau knock-in mice and a non-human primate model of AD that we have successfully created.\n\nWe previously developed single App knock-in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) harboring the Swedish and Beyreuther/Iberian mutations with or without the Arctic mutation (AppNL-G-F and AppNL-F mice, respectively). These models showed Aβ pathology, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment in an age-dependent manner. The former model exhibits extensive pathology as early as 6 months, but is unsuitable for investigating Aβ metabolism and clearance because the Arctic mutation renders Aβ resistant to proteolytic degradation and prone to aggregation. In particular, it is inapplicable to preclinical immunotherapy studies due to its discrete affinity for anti-Aβ antibodies. The latter model may take as long as 18 months for the pathology to become prominent, which leaves an unfulfilled need for an Alzheimer's disease animal model that is both swift to show pathology and useful for antibody therapy. We thus utilized mutant Psen1 knock-in mice into which a pathogenic mutation (P117L) had been introduced to generate a new model that exhibits early deposition of wild-type human Aβ by crossbreeding the AppNL-F line with the Psen1P117L/WT line. We show that the effects of the pathogenic mutations in the App and Psen1 genes are additive or synergistic. This new 3rd generation mouse model showed more cored plaque pathology and neuroinflammation than AppNL-G-F mice, and will help accelerate the development of disease-modifying therapies to treat preclinical AD.\n\nRecent studies have shown that mutation at Ser522 causes inhibition of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) phosphorylation and induces axon elongation and partial recovery of the lost sensorimotor function after spinal cord injury (SCI). We aimed to reveal the intracellular mechanism in axotomized neurons in the CRMP2 knock-in (CRMP2KI) mouse model by performing transcriptome analysis in mouse sensorimotor cortex using micro-dissection punching system. Prior to that, we analyzed the structural pathophysiology in axotomized or neighboring neurons after SCI and found that somatic atrophy and dendritic spine reduction in sensorimotor cortex were suppressed in CRMP2KI mice. Further analysis of the transcriptome has aided in the identification of four hemoglobin genes Hba-a1, Hba-a2, Hbb-bs, and Hbb-bt that are significantly upregulated in wild-type mice with concomitant upregulation of genes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal pathways after SCI. However, we observed substantial upregulation in channel activity genes and downregulation of genes regulating vesicles, synaptic function, glial cell differentiation in CRMP2KI mice. Moreover, the transcriptome profile of CRMP2KI mice has been discussed wherein energy metabolism and neuronal pathways were found to be differentially regulated. Our results showed that CRMP2KI mice displayed improved SCI pathophysiology not only via microtubule stabilization in neurons, but also possibly via the whole metabolic system in the central nervous system, response changes in glial cells, and synapses. Taken together, we reveal new insights on SCI pathophysiology and the regenerative mechanism of central nervous system by the inhibition of CRMP2 phosphorylation at Ser522. All these experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Waseda University, Japan (2017-A027 approved on March 21, 2017; 2018-A003 approved on March 25, 2018; 2019-A026 approved on March 25, 2019).\n\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by impaired motor symptoms induced by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Many factors are speculated to operate in the mechanism of PD, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal protein handling, and PD induced apoptosis. Besides, researchers have recently shown that inflammatory secretions may engage neighboring cells such as astrocytes, which then induce autocrine and paracrine responses that amplify the inflammation, leading to neurodegeneration. In the present study, we analyzed the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4) deletion in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-injected male mice, as well as its effects on motor impairments. Our findings indicated that the deletion of CRMP4 could maintain the TH-positive fibers in the striatum and the TH-positive cells in SNc, attenuate the inflammatory responses, and improve motor coordination and rotational behavior. Furthermore, based on our findings at the early time points, we hypothesized that primary differences between the Crmp4+/+ and Crmp4-/- mice may occur in microglia instead of neurons. Although further work should be carried out to clarify the specific role of CRMP4 in the pathogenesis of PD, our findings suggest that it could be a possible target for the treatment of PD.\n\nProper migration and positioning of Purkinje cells are important for formation of the developing cerebellum. Although several cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) substrates are known to be critical for ordered neuronal migration, there are no reports of mutant mouse-based, in vivo studies on the function of Cdk5-phosphorylation substrates in migration of Purkinje cells. We focused on the analysis of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), one of the Cdk5 substrates, because a previous study reported migration defects of cortical neurons with shRNA-mediated knockdown of CRMP2. However, CRMP2 KI/KI mice, in which Cdk5-phosphorylation is inhibited, showed little defects in Purkinje cell migration and positioning. We hypothesized compensatory redundant functions of the other CRMPs, and analyzed the migration and positioning of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum in every combination of CRMP1 knockout (KO), CRMP2 KI/KI, and CRMP4 KO mice. Severe disturbance of migration and positioning of Purkinje cells were observed in the triple mutant mice. We also found motor coordination defects in the triple CRMPs mutant mice. These results suggest the importance of both, phosphorylation of CRMP2 by Cdk5 and the redundant functions of CRMP1 and CRMP4 in proper migration and positioning of Purkinje cells in developing cerebellum.\n\nParkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Levodopa (L-Dopa), the current main treatment for PD, reduces PD symptoms by partially replacing dopamine, but it does not slow neurodegeneration. Recent studies have evidenced that neuroinflammatory processes contribute to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc under cytopathic conditions, while other lines of inquiry have implicated phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) as a causal factor in axonal retraction after neural injury. We recently reported on the therapeutic effect of lanthionine ketimine ester (LKE) which associates with CRMP2 following axonal injury in the spinal cord. In the present study, we report that LKE protects SNc dopaminergic neurons after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) challenge, a common model for PD, and reduces the number of activated microglia proximal to the damaged SNc. The results also show that MPTP-induced motor impairment was suppressed in LKE treatment. Furthermore, the results show that LKE inhibits the elevation of CRMP2 phosphorylation in dopaminergic neurons in the SNc after MPTP injection. These data suggest that modification of CRMP2 phosphorylation and suppression of microglial activation with LKE administration may represent a novel strategy for slowing progress of pathological processes in PD.\n\nAxonal degeneration occurs in various neurological diseases and traumatic nerve injury, and axonal regeneration is restricted by inhibitory factors in the central nervous system. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) are activated by one of those inhibitors, and collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is phosphorylated by both kinases. We previously developed a CRMP2 knock-in (CRMP2 KI) mouse line, in which CRMP2 phosphorylation at Ser 522 is inhibited. Because CRMP2 KI mice showed promotion of axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury, we hypothesized that CRMP2 KI mice would show higher axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury. In this study, we first show that depolymerization of microtubules after optic nerve crush (ONC) injury was suppressed in CRMP2 KI mice. Loss of retinal ganglia cells was also reduced after ONC. We found that protein level of GAP43, a marker of regenerative axons, was higher in the optic nerve from CRMP2KI than that from wild type 4 weeks after of ONC. We further observed increased numbers of axons labeled by tracer in the optic nerve after ONC in CRMP2 KI mice. These results suggest that inhibition of phosphorylation of CRMP2 suppresses axonal degeneration and promotes axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurological disease characterized by the selective degeneration of motor neurons leading to paralysis and immobility. Missense mutations in the gene coding for the Cu2+/Zn2+ superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) accounts for 15-20% of familial ALS, and mice overexpressing ALS-linked SOD1 mutants have been frequently used as an animal model for ALS. Degeneration of motor neurons in ALS progresses in a manner called \"dying back\", in which the degeneration of synapses and axons precedes the loss of cell bodies. Phosphorylation of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is implicated in the progression of neuronal/axonal degeneration of different etiologies. To evaluate the role of CRMP2 phosphorylation in ALS pathogenesis, we utilized CRMP2 S522A knock-in (CRMP2ki/ki) mice, in which the serine residue 522 was homozygously replaced with alanine and thereby making CRMP2 no longer phosphorylatable by CDK5 or GSK3B. We found that the CRMP2ki/ki/SOD1G93A mice showed delay in the progression of the motor phenotype compared to their SOD1G93-Tg littermates. Histological analysis revealed that the CRMP2ki/ki/SOD1G93A mice retained more intact axons and NMJs than their SOD1G93A-Tg littermates. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of CRMP2 may contribute to the axonal degeneration of motor neurons in ALS.\n\nCRMP2, alternatively designated as DPYSL2, was the first CRMP family member to be identified as an intracellular molecule mediating the signaling of the axon guidance molecule Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A). In Sema3A signaling, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) primarily phosphorylates CRMP2 at Ser522. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) subsequently phosphorylates the residues of Thr509 and Thr514 of CRMP2. Previous studies showed that CRMP2 is involved in pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, hyper-phosphorylated forms of CRMP2 are accumulated in the paired helical filaments. To get insight into the possible involvement of the phosphorylation of CRMP2 in pathogenesis of neurological disorders, we previously created CRMP2 S522A knock-in (crmp2ki/ki) mice and demonstrated that the phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Ser522 is involved in normal dendrite patterning in cortical neurons. However, the behavioral impact and in vivo signaling network of the CRMP2 phosphorylation are not fully understood. In this study, we performed behavioral and proteomics analysis of crmp2ki/ki mice. The crmp2ki/ki mice appeared healthy and showed no obvious differences in physical characteristics compared to wild-type mice, but they showed impaired emotional behavior, reduced sociality, and low sensitivity to pain stimulation. Through mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, we found that 59 proteins were increased and 77 proteins were decreased in the prefrontal cortex of crmp2ki/ki mice. Notably, CRMP3, CRMP4, and CRMP5, the other CRMP family proteins, were increased in crmp2ki/ki mice. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analyses identified 14 pathways in increased total proteins and 13 pathways in decreased total proteins which are associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases. We also detected 20 pathways in increased phosphopeptides and 16 pathways in decreased phosphopeptides including \"inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels\" in crmp2ki/ki mice. Our study suggests that the phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Ser522 is involved in the signaling pathways that may be related to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and pain.\n\nEndoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is believed to play an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The accumulation of misfolded proteins and perturbation of intracellular calcium homeostasis are thought to underlie the induction of ER stress, resulting in neuronal dysfunction and cell death. Several reports have shown an increased ER stress response in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin1 (PS1) double-transgenic (Tg) AD mouse models. However, whether the ER stress observed in these mouse models is actually caused byADpathology remains unclear. APP and PS1 contain one and nine transmembrane domains, respectively, for which it has been postulated that overexpressed membrane proteins can become wedged in a misfolded configuration in ER membranes, thereby inducing nonspecific ER stress. Here, we used an App-knockin (KI) AD mouse model that accumulates amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide without overexpressing APP to investigate whether the ER stress response is heightened because ofAβ pathology. Thorough examinations indicated that no ER stress responses arose in App-KI or single APP-Tg mice. These results suggest thatPS1overexpression or mutation induced a nonspecific ER stress response that was independent of Aβ pathology in the double-Tg mice. Moreover, we observed no ER stress in a mouse model of tauopathy (P301S-Tau-Tg mice) at various ages, suggesting that ER stress is also not essential in tau pathology-induced neurodegeneration. We conclude that the role of ER stress in AD pathogenesis needs to be carefully addressed in future studies.\n\n© 2018 Elsevier B.V. Social recognition memory is crucial for survival across species, underlying the need to correctly identify conspecifics, mates and potential enemies. In humans the hippocampus is engaged in social and episodic memory, however the circuit mechanisms of social memory in rodent models has only recently come under scrutiny. Work in mice has established that the dorsal CA2 and ventral CA1 regions play critical roles, however a more comprehensive comparative analyses of the circuits and mechanisms required has not been reported. Here we employ conditional genetics to examine the differential contributions of the hippocampal subfields to social memory. We find that the deletion of NMDA receptor subunit 1 gene (NR1), which abolishes NMDA receptor synaptic plasticity, in CA3 pyramidal cells led to deficits in social memory; however, mice lacking the same gene in DG granule cells performed indistinguishable from controls. Further, we use conditional pharmacogenetic inhibition to demonstrate that activity in ventral, but not dorsal, CA3 is necessary for the encoding of a social memory. These findings demonstrated CA3 pyramidal cell plasticity and transmission contribute to the encoding of social stimuli and help further identify the distinct circuits underlying the role of the hippocampus in social memory.\n\nCyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is recognized as a unique member among other Cdks due to its versatile roles in many biochemical processes in the nervous system. The proper development of neuronal dendrites is required for the formation of complex neural networks providing the physiological basis of various neuronal functions. We previously reported that sparse dendrites were observed on cultured Cdk5-null Purkinje cells and Purkinje cells in Wnt1(cre)-mediated Cdk5 conditional knockout (KO) mice. In the present study, we generated L7(cre)-mediated p35; p39 double KO (L7(cre)-p35(f/f); p39(-/-)) mice whose Cdk5 activity was eliminated specifically in Purkinje cells of the developing cerebellum. Consequently, these mice exhibited defective Purkinje cell migration, motor coordination deficiency and a Purkinje dendritic abnormality similar to what we have observed before, suggesting that dendritic growth of Purkinje cells was cell-autonomous in vivo. We found that mixed and overlay cultures of WT cerebellar cells rescued the dendritic deficits in Cdk5-null Purkinje cells, however, indicating that Purkinje cell dendritic development was also supported by non-cell-autonomous factors. We then again rescued these abnormalities in vitro by applying exogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Based on the results from culture experiments, we attempted to rescue the developmental defects of Purkinje cells in L7(cre)-p35(f/f); p39(-/-) mice by using a TrkB agonist. We observed partial rescue of morphological defects of dendritic structures of Purkinje cells. These results suggest that Cdk5 activity is required for Purkinje cell dendritic growth in cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manners. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is caused by a mutation in methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MecP2), a transcriptional regulator that recruits protein complexes involved in histone modification and chromatin remodeling. However, the role of Mecp2 in Rett syndrome remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the function of Mecp2 in neuronal development using zebrafish embryos. Mecp2 expression was detected ubiquitously in the central nervous system and muscles at 28 h postfertilization (hpf). We injected an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (AMO) to induce Mecp2 knockdown phenotype. In mecp2 morphants (embryos with Mecp2 knockdown by AMO) at 28 and 72 hpf, we found an increase in abnormal axonal branches of caudal primary motor neurons and a decrease in motor activity. In mecp2 morphants at 24 hpf, we observed an increase in the expression of an mecp2 downstream candidate gene, brain derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf). In mecp2 morphants at 72 hpf, the presynaptic area stained by an anti-SV2 antibody was increased at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Interestingly, the size of SV2-positive presynaptic area at the NMJ was also increased following bdnf mRNA injection, while it was normalized in a double knockdown of mecp2 and bdnf. These results imply that Mecp2 is an important functional regulator of bdnf gene expression during neural circuit formation in zebrafish embryo. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop Neurobiol 77: 1101-1113, 2017\n\nThe molecular pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BPD) is poorly understood. Using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to unravel such mechanisms in polygenic diseases is generally challenging. However, hiPSCs from BPD patients responsive to lithium offered unique opportunities to discern lithium's target and hence gain molecular insight into BPD. By profiling the proteomics of BDP-hiPSC-derived neurons, we found that lithium alters the phosphorylation state of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2). Active non-phosphorylated CRMP2, which binds cytoskeleton, is present throughout the neuron; inactive phosphorylated CRMP2, which dissociates from cytoskeleton, exits dendritic spines. CRMP2 elimination yields aberrant dendritogenesis with diminished spine density and lost lithium responsiveness (LiR). The \"set-point\" for the ratio of pCRMP2: CRMP2 is elevated uniquely in hiPSC-derived neurons from LiR BPD patients, but not with other psychiatric (including lithium-nonresponsive BPD) and neurological disorders. Lithium (and other pathway modulators) lowers pCRMP2, increasing spine area and density. Human BPD brains show similarly elevated ratios and diminished spine densities; lithium therapy normalizes the ratios and spines. Consistent with such \"spine-opathies,\" human LiR BPD neurons with abnormal ratios evince abnormally steep slopes for calcium flux; lithium normalizes both. Behaviorally, transgenic mice that reproduce lithium's postulated site-of-action in dephosphorylating CRMP2 emulate LiR in BPD. These data suggest that the \" lithium response pathway\" in BPD governs CRMP2's phosphorylation, which regulates cytoskeletal organization, particularly in spines, modulating neural networks. Aberrations in the posttranslational regulation of this developmentally critical molecule may underlie LiR BPD pathogenesis. Instructively, examining the proteomic profile in hiPSCs of a functional agent-even one whose mechanism-of-action is unknown-might reveal otherwise inscrutable intracellular pathogenic pathways.\n\nAdult neurogenesis attracts broad attention as a possible cure for neurological disorders. However, its regulatory mechanism is still unclear. Therefore, they have been studying the cell proliferation mechanisms of neural stem cells (NSCs) using zebrafish, which have high regenerative potential in the adult brain. The presence of neuroepithelial-type NSCs in the optic tectum of adult zebrafish has been previously reported. In the present study, it was first confirmed that NSCs in the optic tectum decrease or increase in proportion to projection of the optic nerves from the retina. At 4 days after optic nerve crush (ONC), BrdU-positive cells decreased in the optic tectum's operation side. In contrast, at 3 weeks after ONC, BrdU-positive cells increased in the optic tectum's operation side. To study the regulatory mechanisms, they focused on the BDNF/TrkB system as a regulatory factor in the ONC model. It was found that bdnf was mainly expressed in the periventricular gray zone (PGZ) of the optic tectum by using in situ hybridization. Interestingly, expression level of bdnf significantly decreased in the optic tectum at 4 days after ONC, and its expression level tended to increase at 3 weeks after ONC. They conducted rescue experiments using a TrkB agonist and confirmed that decrease of NSC proliferation in the optic tectum by ONC was rescued by TrkB signal activation, suggesting stimuli-dependent regulation of NSC proliferation in the optic tectum of adult zebrafish.

Develop Neurobiol 77: 474-482, 2017.\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive impairment with neuronal loss. The number of patients suffering from AD has increased, but none of the present therapies stops the progressive symptoms in patients with AD. It has been reported that the activation of microglial cells induces harmful chronic inflammation, leading to neuronal death. Furthermore, the impairment of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus has been observed earlier than amyloid plaque formation. Inflammatory response may lead to impaired adult neurogenesis in patients with AD. This study examines the relationship between adult neurogenesis and neuroinflammation using APPswe/PS1M146V/tauP301L (3xTg) mice. We observed a decline in the proliferation of neural stem cells and the occurrence of severe inflammation in the hippocampus of 3xTg mouse brains at 12 months of age. Previously, our research had shown an anti-inflammatory effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in the 3xTg mouse brain. We found that ATRA has effects on the recovery of proliferative cells along with suppression of activated microglia in the hippocampus. These results suggest that the inhibition of microglial activation by ATRA leads to recovery of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus in an AD mouse model. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nThe mammalian central nervous system (CNS) has limited regenerative ability after injury, largely due to scar formation and axonal growth inhibitors. Experimental suppression of neuroinflammation encourages recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI), yet practical means for pharmacologically treating SCI have remained elusive. Lanthionine ketimine (LK) is a natural brain sulfur amino acid metabolite with demonstrated anti-neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic activities. LK and its synthetic brainpenetrating ethyl ester (LKE) promote growth factor-dependent neurite extension in cultured cell and suppress microglial activation in animal models of neurodegeneration. Thus far however, LKE has not been explored as a potential therapy for SCI. The present study investigated the hypothesis that systemic LKE could improve motor functional recovery after SCI in a mouse model. Intraperitoneal administration of LKE (100 mg/kg/d) after near-complete transect of spinal cord at the T7 level significantly improved motor function over a 4-week time course. Vehicle-treated mice, in contrast, demonstrated negligible functional recovery. In terms of histology, LKE treatment reduced pro-neuroinflammatory microglia/ macrophage activation evidenced by quantitative Iba1 labeling and shifted the microglial phenotype toward a more neurotrophic M2 character evidenced by changes in the M2 marker arginase-1. This was correlated with less dense scar formation and more extensive axonal regrowth across the transection site demonstrated by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) immunolabeling of raphespinal tract axons. These data provide evidence that LKE or similar compounds have potential therapeutic value for recovery after certain forms of SCI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Several lines of evidence suggest that neurodegeneration in PD is accelerated by a vicious cycle in which apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons triggers the activation of microglia and harmful inflammatory processes that further amplify neuronal death. Recently, we demonstrated that the deletion of collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4) suppresses inflammatory responses and cell death in a mouse model of spinal cord injury, leading to improved functional recovery. We thus hypothesized that Crmp4-1 mice may have limited inflammatory responses and a decrease in the loss of SNc dopaminergic neurons in an 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. We observed CRMP4 expression in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia/macrophages following the injection of 25 mg/kg MPTP. We compared the number of dopaminergic neurons and the inflammatory response in SNc between Crmp4+I+ and Crmp4 l mice after MPTP injection. Limited loss of SNc dopaminergic neurons and decreased activations of microglia and astrocytes were observed in Crrnp4-1 mice. These results suggest that CRMP4 is a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of PD patients.\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the best known neurodegenerative diseases; it causes dementia and its pathological features include accumulation of amyloid beta (A beta) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. Elevated Cdk5 activity and CRMP2 phosphorylation have been reported in the brains of AD model mice at the early stage of the disease, but the significance thereof in human AD remains unelucidated. We have recently reported that A beta accumulation in the cerebellum of AD model APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, and cerebellar dysfunctions, such as impairment of motor coordination ability and long-term depression (LTD) induction, at the pre-A beta accumulation stage.\n\nIn the present study, we found increased phosphorylation levels of CRMP2 as well as increased p35 protein levels in the cerebellum of APP/PS1 mice. Interestingly, we show that pioglitazone, an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, normalized the p35 protein and CRMP2 phosphorylation levels in the cerebellum. Impaired motor coordination ability and LTD in APP/PS1 mice were ameliorated by pioglitazone treatment at the pre-A beta accumulation stage. These results suggest a correlation between CRMP2 phosphorylation and AD pathophysiology, and indicate the effectiveness of pioglitazone treatment at the pre-A beta accumulation stage in AD model mice.

Cdk5 and its activators play an important role in brain development as well as higher functions like synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Reduction in p35 was reported in postmortem schizophrenia brain, in which reduced dendritic spine density was observed. Previous in vitro experiments have shown that Cdk5 is involved in dendritic spine formation, although in vivo evidence is limited. We examined dendritic spine formation in inducible-p35 conditional knockout (p35 cKO); p39 KO mice. When we deleted the p35 gene either during early postnatal days or at adult stage, we observed reduced spine densities of layer V neurons in the cerebral cortex and CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. We further generated CA1-specific p35 conditional knockout (CA1-p35 cKO) mice and also CA1-p35 cKO; p39 KO mice in which have specific deletion of p35 in the CA1 region of hippocampus. We found a greater reduction in spine densities in CA1 pyramidal neurons in CA1-p35 cKO; p39 KO mice than in CA1-p35 cKO mice. These results indicate that dendritic spine formation and neuronal maintenance are dependent on Cdk5 activity.\n\nCentral nervous system (CNS) regeneration is restricted by both the lack of neurotrophic responses and the presence of inhibitory factors. As of yet, a common mediator of these two pathways has not been identified. Microtubule dynamics is responsible for several key processes after CNS injuries: intracellular trafficking of receptors for neurotrophic factors, axonal retraction by inhibitory factors, and secondary tissue damages by inflammation and scarring. Kinases regulating microtubule organization, such as Cdk5 or GSK3 beta, may play pivotal roles during CNS recovery, but the molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) stabilizes cytoskeletal polymerization, while CRMP2 phosphorylation by Cdk5 and GSK3 beta loses its affinity for cytoskeleton proteins, leading to the inhibition of axonal growth. Here, we characterized CRMP2 phosphorylation as the first crucial factor regulating neurotrophic and inhibitory responses after spinal cord injury (SCI). We found that pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 beta enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced axonal growth response in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. DRG neurons from CRMP2 knock-in (Crmp2KI/KI) mice, where CRMP2 phosphorylation was eliminated, showed elevated sensitivity to BDNF as well. Additionally, cultured Crmp2KI/KI neurons exhibited suppressed axonal growth inhibition by chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG). These data suggest a couple of new molecular insights: the BDNF/GSK3 beta/CRMP2 and CSPG/GSK3 beta/CRMP2 pathways. Next we tested the significance of CRMP2 phosphorylation after CNS injury in vivo. The phosphorylation level of CRMP2 was enhanced in the injured spinal cord. Crmp2KI/KI mice exhibited prominent recovery of locomotive and nociceptive functions after SCI, which correlated with the enhanced axonal growth of the motor and sensory neurons. Neuroprotective effects against SCI, such as microtubule stabilization, reduced inflammation, and suppressed scarring were also observed by inhibiting CRMP2 phosphorylation. Therefore, inhibition of CRMP2 phosphorylation demonstrates the unique potential to repair SCI by both enhancing sensitivity to BDNF and reducing inhibitory responses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a major pathological hallmark of AD, are composed of tau protein that is hyperphosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta). NFTs also contain Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin-homologous protein 1 (WAVE1) and collapsin response-mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). Although Cdk5 is known to phosphorylate tau, WAVE1, and CRMP2, the significance of this with respect to NFT formation remains to be elucidated. This study examines the involvement of phosphorylated (p-) CRMP2 and WAVE1 in p-tau aggregates using a triple-transgenic (3xTg; APPswe/PS1M146V/tauP301L) AD mouse model. First, we verified the colocalization of p- WAVE1 and p-CRMP2 with aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau in the hippocampus at 23 months of age. Biochemical analysis revealed the inclusion of p-WAVE1, p-CRMP2, and tau in the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of hippocampal homogenates. To test the significance of phosphorylation of these proteins further, we administered all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) to the 3xTg mice, which downregulates Cdk5 and GSK3b activity. In ATRA-treated mice, fewer and smaller tau aggregates were observed compared with non-ATRA-treated mice. These results suggest the possibility of novel therapeutic target molecules for preventing tau pathology.

Several reports have demonstrated that VPA functions as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. While VPA is known to cause teratogenic changes in the embryonic zebrafish brain, its effects on neural stem cells (NSCs) in both the embryonic and adult zebrafish are not well understood. Results: In this study, we observed a proliferative effect of VPA on NSCs in the embryonic hindbrain. In contrast, VPA reduced cell proliferation in the adult zebrafish optic tectum. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors showed a similar inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in the adult zebrafish optic tectum, suggesting that VPA reduces cell proliferation through HDAC inhibition. Cell cycle progression was also suppressed in the optic tectum of the adult zebrafish brain because of HDAC inhibition. Recent studies have demonstrated that HDAC inhibits the Notch signaling pathway\n\nhence, adult zebrafish were treated with a Notch inhibitor. This increased the number of proliferating cells in the adult zebrafish optic tectum with down-regulated expression of her4, a target of Notch signaling. Conclusions: These results suggest that VPA inhibits HDAC activity and upregulates Notch signaling to reduce cell proliferation in the optic tectum of adult zebrafish.\n\nNeuronal migration is crucial for development of the mammalian-specific six-layered cerebral cortex. Migrating neurons are known to exhibit distinct features; they form a cytoplasmic dilation, a structure specific to migrating neurons, at the proximal region of the leading process, followed by nuclear elongation and forward movement. However, the molecular mechanisms of dilation formation and nuclear elongation remain unclear. Using ex vivo chemical inhibitor experiments, we show here that rottlerin, which is widely used as a specific inhibitor for PKCδ, suppresses the formation of a cytoplasmic dilation and nuclear elongation in cortical migrating neurons. Although our previous study showed that cortical neuronal migration depends on Jnk, another downstream target of rottlerin, Jnk inhibition disturbs only the nuclear elongation and forward movement, but not the dilation formation. We found that an unconventional cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk5, is a novel downstream target of rottlerin, and that pharmacological or knockdown-mediated inhibition of Cdk5 suppresses both the dilation formation and nuclear elongation. We also show that Cdk5 inhibition perturbs endocytic trafficking as well as microtubule organization, both of which have been shown to be required for dilation formation. Furthermore, knockdown of Dcx, a Cdk5 substrate involved in microtubule organization and membrane trafficking, or p27(kip1), another Cdk5 substrate involved in actin and microtubule organization, disturbs the dilation formation and nuclear elongation. These data suggest that Cdk5 and its substrates, Dcx and p27(kip1), characterize migrating neuron-specific features, cytoplasmic dilation formation and nuclear elongation in the mouse cerebral cortex, possibly through the regulation of microtubule organization and an endocytic pathway.\n\nCdk5 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) family. In contrast to other Cdks that promote cell proliferation, Cdk5 plays a role in regulating various neuronal functions, including neuronal migration, synaptic activity, and neuron death. Cdks responsible for cell proliferation need phosphorylation in the activation loop for activation in addition to binding a regulatory subunit cyclin. Cdk5, however, is activated only by binding to its activator, p35 or p39. Furthermore, in contrast to Cdk1 and Cdk2, which are inhibited by phosphorylation at Tyr-15, the kinase activity of Cdk5 is reported to be stimulated when phosphorylated at Tyr-15 by Src family kinases or receptor-type tyrosine kinases. We investigated the activation mechanism of Cdk5 by phosphorylation at Tyr-15. Unexpectedly, however, it was found that Tyr-15 phosphorylation occurred only on monomeric Cdk5, and the coexpression of activators, p35/p25, p39, or Cyclin I, inhibited the phosphorylation. In neuron cultures, too, the activation of Fyn tyrosine kinase did not increase Tyr-15 phosphorylation of Cdk5. Further, phospho-Cdk5 at Tyr-15 was not detected in the p35-bound Cdk5. In contrast, expression of active Fyn increased p35 in neurons. These results indicate that phosphorylation at Tyr-15 is not an activation mechanism of Cdk5 but, rather, indicate that tyrosine kinases could activate Cdk5 by increasing the protein amount of p35. These results call for reinvestigation of how Cdk5 is regulated downstream of Src family kinases or receptor tyrosine kinases in neurons, which is an important signaling cascade in a variety of neuronal activities. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.\n\nCdk5 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) family.

Dynamic remodeling of cytoskeletons is required for all of these processes. Cdk5-p35 phosphorylates many cytoskeletal proteins, but it is not fully understood how Cdk5-p35 regulates cytoskeletal reorganization associated with neuronal migration. Since actin filaments are critical for the neuronal movement and process formation, we aimed to find Cdk5 substrates among actin-binding proteins. In this study, we isolated actin gels from mouse brain extracts, which contain many actin-binding proteins, and phosphorylated them by Cdk5-p35 in vitro. Drebrin, a side binding protein of actin filaments and well known for spine formation, was identified as a phosphorylated protein. Drebrin has two isoforms, an embryonic form drebrin E and an adult type long isoform drebrin A. Ser142 was identified as a common phosphorylation site to drebrin E and A and Ser342 as a drebrin A-specific site. Phosphorylated drebrin is localized at the distal area of total drebrin in the growth cone of cultured primary neurons. By expressing nonphosphorylatable or phosphorylation mimicking mutants in developing neurons in utero, the reversible phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reaction of drebrin was shown to be involved in radial migration of cortical neurons. These results suggest that Cdk5-p35 regulates neuronal migration through phosphorylation of drebrin in growth cone processes.\n\nBackground: Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is essential for brain development and function, and its deregulated expression is implicated in some of neurodegenerative diseases. We reported earlier that the forebrain-specific Cdk5 conditional knockout (cKO) mice displayed an early lethality associated with neuroinflammation, increased expression of the neuronal tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), and neuronal migration defects.\n\nMethods: In order to suppress neuroinflammation in the cKO mice, we first treated these mice with pioglitazone, a PPAR gamma agonist, and analyzed its effects on neuronal loss and longevity. In a second approach, to delineate the precise role of tPA in neuroinflammation in these mice, we generated Cdk5 cKO; tPA double knockout (dKO) mice.\n\nResults: We found that pioglitazone treatment significantly reduced astrogliosis, microgliosis, neuronal loss and behavioral deficit in Cdk5 cKO mice. Interestingly, the dKO mice displayed a partial reversal in astrogliosis, but they still died at early age, suggesting that the increased expression of tPA in the cKO mice does not contribute significantly to the pathological process leading to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss and early lethality.\n\nConclusion: The suppression of neuroinflammation in Cdk5 cKO mice ameliorates gliosis and neuronal loss, thus suggesting the potential beneficial effects of the PPAR gamma agonist pioglitazone for the treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n:Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity is dependent on its association with 1 of 2 neuron-specific activators, p35 or p39.

The Brown-Norway (BN) inbred rat presents a higher frequency of PDA. A previous study reported that 2 different quantitative trait loci on chromosomes 8 and 9 were significantly linked to PDA in this strain. Nevertheless, the genetic or molecular mechanisms underlying PDA phenotypes in BN rats have not been fully investigated yet. Methods and Results: It was found that the elastic fibers were abundant in the subendothelial area but scarce in the media even in the closed ductus arteriosus (DA) of full-term BN neonates. DNA microarray analysis identified 52 upregulated genes (fold difference &gt\n\n2.5) and 23 downregulated genes (fold difference &lt\n\n0.4) when compared with those of F344 control neonates. Among these genes, 8 (Tbx20, Scn3b, Stac, Sphkap, Trpm8, Rup2, Slc37a2, and RGD1561216) are located in chromosomes 8 and 9. Interestingly, it was also suggested that the significant decrease in the expression levels of the PGE2-specfic receptor, EP4, plays a critical role in elastogenesis in the DA. Conclusions: BN rats exhibited dysregulation of elastogenesis in the DA. DNA microarray analysis identified the candidate genes including EP4 involved in the DNA phenotype. Further investigation of these newly identified genes will hopefully clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the irregular formation of elastic fibers in PDA.\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (A beta) protein and tau deposition in the brain. Numerous studies have reported a central role of A beta in the development of AD, but the pathogenesis is not well understood. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), an intracellular protein mediating a repulsive axon guidance molecule, Semaphorin3A, is also accumulated in neurofibrillary tangles in AD brains. To gain insight into the role of CRMP2 phosphorylation in AD pathogenesis, we investigated the effects of A beta neurotoxicity in CRMP2 phosphorylation-deficient knock-in (crmp2(ki/ki)) mice, in which the serine residue at 522 was replaced with alanine. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of A beta(25-35) peptide, a neurotoxic fragment of A beta protein, to wild-type (wt) mice increased hippocampal phosphorylation of CRMP2. Behavioral assessment revealed that i.c.v. injection of A beta(25-35) peptide caused impairment of novel object recognition in wt mice, while the same peptide did not in crmp2(ki/ki) mice. In electrophysiological recording, wt and crmp2(ki/ki) mice have similar input-output basal synaptic transmission and paired-pulse ratios. However, long-term potentiation was impaired in hippocampal slices of A beta(25-35) peptide-treated wt but not those of crmp2(ki/ki). Our findings indicate that CRMP2 phosphorylation is required for A beta-induced impairment of cognitive memory and synaptic plasticity.

Ceramide synthases (cers) reside in the center of sphingolipid metabolism by producing ceramide through de novo synthesis or degradative pathways. While the six mammalian cers family members have been extensively studied in cell culture and in adult tissues, a systematic analysis of cers expression and function during embryogenesis is still lacking. Results: Using bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis, we identified nine highly conserved homologs of the vertebrate cers gene family in the zebrafish genome. A systematic expression analysis throughout five developmental stages indicates that, whereas until 48 hours post fertilization most zebrafish cers homologs are expressed in distinct patterns, e.g., in the intermediate cell mass and the pronephric duct, they show a highly overlapping expression during later stages of embryonic development, mostprominently in the developing brain. Conclusions: In this study, the expression of the cers gene homologs is comprehensively analyzed for the first time during vertebrate embryogenesis. Our data indicate that each embryonic tissue has a unique profile of cers expression during zebrafish embryogenesis suggesting tissue-specific profiles of ceramides and their derivatives. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nCyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is a serine/threonine kinase, and its kinase activity is dependent upon its association with either of the activating subunits p35 or p39, which are mainly expressed in neurons. We previously reported that Cdk5 knockout (KO) mice exhibit perinatal lethality, defective neuronal migration, and abnormal positioning of neurons in the facial motor nucleus and inferior olive in the hindbrain and Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellum. In this study, we focused on the analysis of the role of Cdk5 in cerebellar development. For this purpose we generated midbrain-hindbrain-specific Cdk5 conditional knockout (MHB-Cdk5 KO) mice because the cerebellum develops postnatally, whereas Cdk5 KO mice die perinatally. Histological analysis of the MHB-Cdk5 KO mice revealed a significant size reduction of the cerebellum. In addition, profound disturbance of inward migration of granule cells (GC) was observed in the developing cerebellum. A normal dendritic development of the Purkinje cells (PCs) was disturbed in MHB-Cdk5 KO mice. Cultured Cdk5-null PCs showed similar dendritic abnormalities. These results indicate that Cdk5/p35 plays an important role in neuronal migration of PCs and GCs and dendrite formation of PCs in cerebellar development. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons mainly receive input from the axons of CA3 pyramidal neurons in this neural circuit. A CA1 pyramidal neuron has a single apical dendrite and multiple basal dendrites. In wild-type mice, most of CA1 pyramidal neurons extend a single trunk, or alternatively, the apical dendrite bifurcates into two daughter trunks at the stratum radiatum layer. We previously reported the proximal bifurcation phenotype in Sema3A-/-, p35-/-, and CRMP4-/- mice. Cdk5/p35 phosphorylates CRMP2 at Ser522, and inhibition of this phosphorylation suppressed Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. In this study, we analyzed the bifurcation points of the apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in CRMP2KI/KI mice in which the Cdk5/p35-phosphorylation site Ser522 was mutated into an Ala residue. The proximal bifurcation phenotype was not observed in CRMP2KI/KI mice; however, severe proximal bifurcation of apical dendrites was found in CRMP2KI/KI;CRMP4-/- mice. Cultured hippocampal neurons from CRMP2KI/KI and CRMP2KI/KI;CRMP4-/- embryos showed an increased number of dendritic branching points compared to those from wild-type embryos. Sema3A increased the number of branching points and the total length of dendrites in wild-type hippocampal neurons, but these effects of Sema3A for dendrites were not observed in CRMP2KI/KI and CRMP2KI/KI;CRMP4-/-hippocampal neurons. Binding of CRMP2 to tubulin increased in both CRMP2KI/KI and CRMP2KI/KI:CRMP4-/- brain lysates. These results suggest that CRMP2 and CRMP4 synergistically regulate dendritic development, and CRMP2 phosphorylation is critical for proper bifurcation of apical dendrite of CA1 pyramidal neurons.\n\nThe activities of CDK5 and p35 are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). We studied the effect of p35 deletion in Tg2576 mice, which is an AD animal model. To obtain the desired mice, we crossed p35-/- with Tg2576 mice. The resulting p35-/-/Tg2576 (KO/Tg) mice displayed higher mortality rates and exhibited impaired spatial learning and memory at 6 months of age. Using immunohistochemical and biochemical approaches, we observed a reduction in the expression of pre- and post-synaptic markers such as NMDAR1, synaptophysin and GluR1. In addition, the intensity of MAP-2-positive dendrites extending from neuronal cell bodies was significantly decreased in KO/Tg mice compared with KO/WT and WT/Tg mice. We also detected increased neuronal cell death in the hippocampus, along with thinned and collapsed morphological changes in the alveus region and a dramatic increase in the number of microglial cells. Microglial infiltration in the hippocampus could result in the increased secretion of the soluble high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1). The secretion of HMGB-1 is increased by Aβ, and secretion of HMGB-1 promotes neuronal cell death. Moreover, we found that HMGB-1 secretion induced by Aβ in KO/Tg mice gave rise to ER-mediated cell death. In summary, during the stages of KO/Tg mice model, the microglial infiltration and secretion of soluble HMGB-1 were significantly increased in the hippocampus. These conditions promote neuronal death, synaptic destruction and behavioral deficits. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.\n\nDpysl2 (CRMP2) and Dpysl3 (CRMP4) are involved in neuronal polarity and axon elongation in cultured neurons. These proteins are expressed in various regions of the developing nervous system, but their roles in vivo are largely unknown. In dpysl2 and dpysl3 double morphants, Rohon-Beard (RB) primary sensory neurons that were originally located bilaterally along the midline shifted their position to a more medial location in the dorsal-most part of spinal cord. A similar phenotype was observed in the cdk5 and dyrk2 double morphants. Dpysl2 and Dpysl3 phosphorylation mimics recovered this phenotype. Cell transplantation analysis demonstrated that this ectopic RB cell positioning was non-cell autonomous and correlated with the abnormal position of neural crest cells (NCCs), which also occupied the dorsal-most part of the spinal cord during the neural rod formation stage. The cell position of other interneuron and motor neurons within the central nervous system was normal in these morphants. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of Dpysl2 and Dpysl3 by Cdk5 and DYRK2 is required for the proper positioning of RB neurons and NCCs during neurulation in zebrafish embryos. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\n\nDpysl2 (CRMP2) and Dpysl3 (CRMP4) are involved in neuronal polarity and axon elongation in cultured neurons.

In the adult teleost optic tectum, most of the proliferating cells are distributed in the caudal margin of the periventricular gray zone (PGZ). We found that the PGZ is largely divided into 3 regions: 1 mitotic region and 2 post-mitotic regions-the superficial and deep layers. These regions are distinguished by the differential expression of several marker genes: pcna, sox2, msi1, elavl3, gfap, fabp7a, and s100 beta. Using transgenic zebrafish Tg (gfap:GFP), we found that the deep layer cells specifically express gfap:GFP and have a radial glial morphology. We noted that bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the mitotic region did not exhibit glial properties, but maintained neuroepithelial characteristics. Pulse chase experiments with BrdU-positive cells revealed the presence of self-renewing stem cells within the mitotic region. BrdU-positive cells differentiate into glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons and oligodendrocytes in the superficial layer and into radial glial cells in the deep layer. These results demonstrate that the proliferating cells in the PGZ contribute to neuronal and glial lineages to maintain the structure of the optic tectum in adult zebrafish. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The prolonged or repeated seizures are known to cause neuronal death\n\nhowever, the mechanism underlying seizure-induced neuronal death remains to be elucidated. An essential role of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in brain development has been demonstrated in Cdk5-/- mice, which show neuronal migration defects and perinatal lethality. Here, we show the consequences of Cdk5 deficiency in the postnatal brain by generating Cdk5 conditional knockout mice, in which Cdk5 is selectively eliminated from neurons in the developing forebrain. The conditional mutant mice were viable, but exhibited complex neurological deficits including seizures, tremors, and growth retardation. The forebrain not only showed disruption of layering, but also neurodegenerative changes accompanied by neuronal loss and microglial activation. The neurodegenerative changes progressed with age and were accompanied by up-regulation of the neuronal tissue-type plasminogen activator, a serine protease known to mediate microglial activation. Thus age-dependent neurodegeneration in the Cdk5 conditional knockout mouse brain invoked a massive inflammatory reaction. These findings indicate an important role of Cdk5 in inflammation, and also provide a mouse model to examine the possible involvement of inflammation in the pathogenesis of progressive cognitive decline in patients with neuronal migration disorders.

In the adult teleost optic tectum, most of the proliferating cells are distributed in the caudal margin of the periventricular gray zone (PGZ). We found that the PGZ is largely divided into 3 regions: 1 mitotic region and 2 post-mitotic regions-the superficial and deep layers. These regions are distinguished by the differential expression of several marker genes: pcna, sox2, msi1, elavl3, gfap, fabp7a, and s100beta. Using transgenic zebrafish Tg (gfap:GFP), we found that the deep layer cells specifically express gfap:GFP and have a radial glial morphology. We noted that bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the mitotic region did not exhibit glial properties, but maintained neuroepithelial characteristics. Pulse chase experiments with BrdU-positive cells revealed the presence of self-renewing stem cells within the mitotic region. BrdU-positive cells differentiate into glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons and oligodendrocytes in the superficial layer and into radial glial cells in the deep layer. These results demonstrate that the proliferating cells in the PGZ contribute to neuronal and glial lineages to maintain the structure of the optic tectum in adult zebrafish.\n\n:Doublecortin (DCX) is expressed in young neurons and functions as a microtubule-associated protein. DCX is essential for neuronal migration because humans with mutations in the DCX gene exhibit cortical lamination defects known as lissencephaly in males and subcortical laminar heterotopia (or double cortex syndrome) in females. Phosphorylation of DCX alters its affinity for tubulin and may modulate neurite extension and neuronal migration. Previous in vitro phosphorylation experiments revealed that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylates multiple sites of DCX, including Ser332, (S332). However, phosphorylation at only Ser297 has been shown in vivo. In the present study, we examined phosphorylation of S332 of DCX in the Cdk5-/- mouse brain and results found, unexpectedly, indicate an increased DCX phosphorylation at S332. We found that JNK, not Cdk5, phosphorylates DCX at S332 in vivo. To examine the physiological significance of S332 phosphorylation of DCX in neuronal cells, we transfected cells with either GFP, GFP-DCX-WT, or GFP-DCX-S332A and analyzed neurite extension and migration. Introduction of GFP-DCX-WT enhanced neurite extension and migration. These effects of DCX introduction were suppressed when we used GFP-DCX-S332A. Treatment of neurons with JNK inhibitor increased the amount of DCX that bound to tubulin. Interestingly, amount of DCX that bound to tubulin decreased in Cdk5-/- brain homogenates, which indicates that phosphorylation of DCX by JNK is critical for the regulation of DCX binding to tubulin. These results suggest the physiological importance of phosphorylation of DCX for its function.\n\nThe dysfunction of proteasomes and mitochondria has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. However, the mechanism by which this dysfunction causes neuronal cell death is unknown. We studied the role of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)-p35 in the neuronal cell death induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyrinidinium ion (MPP(+)), which has been used as an in vitro model of Parkinson disease. When cultured neurons were treated with 100 mu M MPP(+), p35 was degraded by proteasomes at 3 h, much earlier than the neurons underwent cell death at 12-24 h. The degradation of p35 was accompanied by the down-regulation of Cdk5 activity. We looked for the primary target of MPP(+) that triggered the proteasome-mediated degradation of p35. MPP(+) treatment for 3 h induced the fragmentation of the mitochondria, reduced complex I activity of the respiratory chain without affecting ATP levels, and impaired the mitochondrial import system. The dysfunction of the mitochondrial import system is suggested to up-regulate proteasome activity, leading to the ubiquitin-independent degradation of p35. The overexpression of p35 attenuated MPP(+)-induced neuronal cell death. In contrast, depletion of p35 with short hairpin RNA not only induced cell death but also sensitized to MPP(+) treatment. These results indicate that a brief MPP(+) treatment triggers the delayed neuronal cell death by the down-regulation of Cdk5 activity via mitochondrial dysfunction-induced up-regulation of proteasome activity. We propose a role for Cdk5-p35 as a survival factor in countering MPP(+)-induced neuronal cell death.\n\nHuntington's disease (HD) is a polyglutamine [ poly(Q)] disease with an expanded poly(Q) stretch in the N terminus of the huntingtin protein (htt). A major pathological feature of HD neurons is inclusion bodies, detergent-insoluble aggregates composed of poly(Q)expanded mutant htt (mhtt). Misfolding of mhtt is thought to confer a toxic property via formation of aggregates. Although toxic molecular species are still debated, it is important to clarify the aggregation mechanism to understand the pathogenesis of mhtt. Weshow Cdk5/p35 suppresses the formation of mhtt inclusion bodies in cell lines and primary neurons. Although we expressed the N-terminal exon 1 fragment of htt lacking phosphorylation sites for Cdk5 in COS-7 cells, the kinase activity of Cdk5 was required for the suppression. Furthermore, Cdk5/p35 suppressed inclusion formation of atrophin-1, another poly(Q) protein, raising the possibility that Cdk5/p35 generally suppresses inclusion formation of poly(Q) proteins. Microtubules (MTs) were a downstream component of Cdk5/p35 in the suppression of inclusion formation; Cdk5/p35 disrupted MTs, which were required for the formation of inclusions. Moreover, stabilization of MTs by Taxol induced inclusions even with overexpression of Cdk5/p35. The formation of inclusions was also regulated by manipulating the Cdk5/p35 activity in primary rat or mouse cortical neuron cultures. These results indicate that Cdk5-dependent regulation of MT organization is involved in the development of aggregate formation and subsequent pathogenesis of poly(Q) diseases. This Cdk5 inhibition of htt aggregates is a novel mechanism different from htt phosphorylation and interaction with Cdk5 reported previously.\n\nThe rat granular retrosplenial cortex (GRS) is a simplified cortex, with distinct stratification and, in the uppermost layers, distinct modularity. Thalamic and cortical inputs are segregated by layers and in layer 1 colocalize, respectively, with apical dendritic bundles originating from neurons in layers 2 or 5. To further investigate this organization, we turned to reelin-deficient reeler mouse and Shaking rat Kawasaki. We found that the disrupted lamination, evident in Nissl stains in these rodents, is in fact a patch-matrix mosaic of segregated afferents and dendrites. Patches consist of thalamocortical connections, visualized by vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2) or AChE. The surrounding matrix consists of corticocortical terminations, visualized by VGluT1 or zinc. Dendrites concentrate in the matrix or patches, depending on whether they are OCAM positive (matrix) or negative (patches). In wild-type rodents and, presumably, mutants, OCAM(+) structures originate from layer 5 neurons. By double labeling for dendrites (filled by Lucifer yellow in fixed slice) and OCAM immunofluorescence, we ascertained 2 populations in reeler: dendritic branches either preferred (putative layer 5 neurons) or avoided (putative supra-granular neurons) the OCAM 1 matrix. We conclude that input-target relationships are largely preserved in the mutant GRS and that dendrite-dendrite interactions involving OCAM influence the formation of the mosaic configuration.\n\nThe mammalian cerebral cortex consists of six layers that are generated via coordinated neuronal migration during the embryonic period. Recent studies identified specific phases of radial migration of cortical neurons. After the final division, neurons transform from a multipolar to a bipolar shape within the subventricular zone-intermediate zone (SVZ-IZ) and then migrate along radial glial fibres. Mice lacking Cdk5 exhibit abnormal corticogenesis owing to neuronal migration defects. When we introduced GFP into migrating neurons at E14.5 by in utero electroporation, we observed migrating neurons in wild-type but not in Cdk5(-/-) embryos after 3-4 days. Introduction of the dominant-negative form of Cdk5 into the wild-type migrating neurons confirmed specific impairment of the multipolar-to-bipolar transition within the SVZ-IZ in a cell-autonomous manner. Cortex-specific Cdk5 conditional knockout mice showed inverted layering of the cerebral cortex and the layer V and callosal neurons, but not layer VI neurons, had severely impaired dendritic morphology. The amount of the dendritic protein Map2 was decreased in the cerebral cortex of Cdk5-deficient mice, and the axonal trajectory of cortical neurons within the cortex was also abnormal. These results indicate that Cdk5 is required for proper multipolar-to-bipolar transition, and a deficiency of Cdk5 results in abnormal morphology of pyramidal neurons. In addition, proper radial neuronal migration generates an inside-out pattern of cerebral cortex formation and normal axonal trajectories of cortical pyramidal neurons.\n\nThe serine/threonine kinase p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) modulates actin and microtubule dynamics. The neuronal functions of Pak1, despite its abundant expression in the brain, have not yet been fully delineated. Previously, we reported that Pak1 mediates initiation of dendrite formation. In the present study, the role of Pak1 in dendritogenesis, spine formation and maintenance was examined in detail. Overexpression of constitutively active-Pak1 in immature cortical neurons increased not only the number of the primary branching on apical dendrites but also the number of basal dendrites. In contrast, introduction of dominant negative-Pak caused a reduction in both of these morphological features. The length and the number of secondary apical branch points of dendrites were not significantly different in cultured neurons expressing these mutant forms, suggesting that Pak1 plays a role in dendritogenesis. Pak1 also plays a role in the formation and maintenance of spines, as evidenced by the altered spine morphology, resulting from overexpression of mutant forms of Pak1 in immature and mature hippocampal neurons. Thus, our results provide further evidence of the key role of Pak1 in the regulation of dendritogenesis, dendritic arborization, the spine formation, and maintenance.

Using double-transgenic mice, we have previously shown that these two signaling pathways lie in parallel fashion and have a genetic interaction. Disabled-1 (Dab1), an adapter protein, mediates Reelin signaling and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated on the binding of Reelin to its receptors. Several isoforms of Dab1 are expressed in embryonic mouse brain, and p80 [Dab1(S55)] is the major protein translated. In the present study, we investigated whether CdkS-mediated phosphorylation of Dab1 modulates Reelin signaling. Cdk5 phosphorylates p80 Dabl at multiple sites in its carboxyl terminal region, and tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 Dabl by Fyn tyrosine kinase is attenuated by this Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation in vitro. Tyrosine phosphorylation. of p80 Dab1 induced by exogenous Reelin is enhanced in Cdk5-deficient neurons, corroborating the inhibitory effect of Cdk5-mediated Ser/Thr phosphorylation on tyrosine phosphorylation of p80 Dabl. Another isoform, p45 Dabl [Dabl(271)], however, is phosphorylated by CdkS at one serine residue within a unique carboxyl-terminal region, and its serine phosphorylation enhances tyrosine phosphorylation. by Fyn and results in progressive degradation of p45 Dabl. These results indicate that Cdk5 modulates Reelin signaling through the Ser/Thr phosphorylation. of Dabl differently in an isoform-specific manner. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Present treatments to reduce hyperglycemia mainly target the ATP-sensitive K+ (K-ATP) channel of pancreatic beta cells to increase insulin secretion. These current approaches are often associated with the side effect of hypoglycemia. Here we show that inhibition of the activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) enhanced insulin secretion under conditions of stimulation by high glucose but not low glucose in MIN6 cells and pancreatic islets. The role of Cdk5 in regulation of insulin secretion was confirmed in pancreatic beta cells deficient in p35, an activator of Cdk5. p35-knockout mice also showed enhanced insulin secretion in response to a glucose challenge. Cdk5 kinase inhibition enhanced the inward whole-cell Ca2+ channel current and increased Ca2+ influx across the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel ( L-VDCC) upon stimulation with high glucose in beta cells, but had no effect on Ca2+ influx without glucose stimulation. The inhibitory regulation by Cdk5 on the L-VDCC was attributed to the phosphorylation of loop II-III of the alpha(1C) subunit of L-VDCC at Ser783, which prevented the binding to SNARE proteins and subsequently resulted in a decrease of the activity of L-VDCC. These results suggest that Cdk5/p35 may be a drug target for the regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.\n\nCocaine, a drug of abuse, increases synaptic dopamine levels in the striatum by blocking dopamine reuptake at axon terminals. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and its activator p35, proteins involved in phosphorylation of substrates in postmitotic neurons, have been found to be up-regulated after chronic exposure to cocaine. To further examine the effects of Cdk5 and p35 induction on striatal dopamine signaling, we generated two independent transgenic mouse lines in which Cdk5 or p35 was overexpressed specifically in neurons. We report here that increased Cdk5 activity, as a result of p35 but not of Cdk5 overexpression, leads to attenuation of cocaine-mediated dopamine signaling. Increased Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, molecular mass 32 kDa (DARPP-32) at Thr-75, was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr-34. Increased Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 at Thr-286 was accompanied by decreased activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. These effects contributed to attenuation of cocaine-induced phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein as well as a lesser induction of c-fos in the striatum. These results support the idea that Cdk5 activity is involved in altered gene expression after chronic exposure to cocaine and hence impacts the long-lasting changes in neuronal function underlying cocaine addiction.\n\nCollapsin response mediating protein-2 (CRMP2) has been identified as an intracellular protein mediating Semaphorin3A (Sema3A), a repulsive guidance molecule. In this study, we demonstrate that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) plays a critical role in Sema3A signalling. In In vitro kinase assay, Cdk5 phosphorylated CRMP2 at Ser522, while GSK3beta did not induce any phosphorylation of CRMP2. Phosphorylation by GSK3beta was exclusively observed in Cdk5-phosphorylated CRMP2, but barely in CRMP2T509A. These results indicate that Cdk5 primarily phosphorylates CRMP2 at Ser522 and GSK3beta secondarily phosphorylates at Thr509. The dual-phosphorylated CRMP2, but not non-phosphorylated or single-phosphorylated CRMP2, is recognized with the antibody 3F4, which is highly reactive with the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease. 3F4 recognized the CRMP2 in the wild-type but not cdk5(-/-) mouse embryonic brain lysates. The phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Ser522 caused reduction of its affinity to tubulin. In dorsal root ganglion neurones, Sema3A stimulation enhanced the levels of the phosphorylated form of CRMP2 detected by 3F4. Over-expression of CRMP2 mutant substituting either Ser522 or Thr509 to Ala attenuates Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse response. These results suggest that the sequential phosphorylation of CRMP is an important process of Sema3A signalling and the same mechanism may have some relevance to the pathological aggregation of the microtubule-associated proteins.\n\nAn impressive body of evidence has been accumulated indicating that local protein synthesis is implicated in navigation of neurite extension induced by guidance cues, such as semaphorin3A (Sema3A). We found previously that a Src type tyrosine kinase Fyn and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) mediate Sema3A-signaling. We also showed that Sema3A elicits axonal transport through neuropilin-1, a receptor for Sema3A, located at the growth cones. Here, we investigate the relationship between Sema3A-induced local signaling, protein synthesis, and axonal transport. Lavendustin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and olomoucine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, suppressed Sema3A-induced facilitation of anterograde and retrograde axonal transport in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron with and without the cell body. Sema3A-induced facilitation of axonal transport was attenuated in DRG neurons of fyn- (fyn(-/-)) and a Cdk5 activator, p35 (p35(-/-))-deficient mice when compared with those of wild-type or heterozygous mice. Inhibition of protein synthesis suppressed Sema3A-induced facilitation of axonal transport in the DRG neuron with and without the cell body. Sema3A enhanced the level of immunoreactivity of phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) within 5 min in growth cones in a time course similar to that of the facilitated axonal transport. This enhanced signal for phospho-eIF4E was blocked by lavendustin A or olomoucine and was not detected in the fyn(-/-) and p35(-/-) neurons. These results provide evidence for a mutual regulatory mechanism between local protein synthesis and axonal transport."
