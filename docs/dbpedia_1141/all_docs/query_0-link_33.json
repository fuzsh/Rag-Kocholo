In search for novel substrates of Cdk5 in the brain we performed quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis, isolating phosphoproteins from whole brain derived from E18.5 Cdk5+/+ and Cdk5−/− embryos, using an Immobilized Metal-Ion Affinity Chromatography (IMAC), which specifically binds to phosphorylated proteins.

MARCKS is known to be phosphorylated by Cdk5 in chick neural cells while Grin1 has not been reported to be phosphorylated by Cdk5. When these proteins were overexpressed in N2A neuroblastoma cell line along with p35, serine phosphorylation in their Cdk5 motifs was found to be increased. In contrast, treatments with roscovitine, the Cdk5 inhibitor, resulted in an opposite effect on serine phosphorylation in N2A cells and primary hippocampal neurons transfected with MARCKS.

        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe complexity of cell functions derives not only from the particular content of individual proteins at a given time, but also from their post-translational modifications. The most common post-translational modification of proteins is the phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. This is particularly important to cellular mechanisms that integrate extracellular and intracellular signals through selective phosphorylation of proteins leading to specific functional outcomes. Protein phosphorylation plays a key role in many cellular functions such as cell signaling, apoptosis, cell migration, cytoskeletal dynamics and brain development. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is an atypical member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family of which most of the members are key regulators of the cell cycle [1], [2]. Although Cdk5 is ubiquitously expressed, it is mainly active in post-mitotic neurons, where it is activated by neuron-specific activators p35 and p39 [3], [4]. Cdk5 belongs to the proline-directed serine/threonine kinase group, and it phosphorylates many proteins possessing a canonical consensus sequence (S/T)PX(K/H/R) or at least a minimal consensus sequence (S/T)P [5]. Cdk5 is known to phosphorylate cytoskeletal proteins, signaling molecules, ion channels and regulatory proteins that participate in the normal function of the brain and also during neurodegenerative disorders [1], [2], [4], [6]. A detailed analysis of Cdk5−/− mice, which display perinatal lethality and extensive neuronal migration defects, revealed that Cdk5 serves as a key regulator of neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and axonal path finding and dendrite development [7], [8].\n\nGiven that a large number of the key cellular processes involve Cdk5 activity, suggesting that with the advent of new proteomic techniques many more Cdk5 substrates will be discovered. Interestingly, in the last few years many reports have indicated that Cdk5 also has extra-neuronal functions, such as regulating gene transcription, vesicular transport, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and migration in many cell types and tissues [2], [9]. In the past, most of the Cdk5 substrates were discovered by classical biochemical and molecular approaches. However, there have been some efforts to identify Cdk5 substrates using high throughput screening (HTS). For example, Gillardon and colleagues used two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to study the protein phosphorylation patterns in cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons treated with Indolinone A, a Cdk5 inhibitor. Although these researchers did not find any specific substrates directly phosphorylated by Cdk5, their study demonstrated the changes in the phosphorylation status of certain proteins. Some results suggest that inhibiting Cdk5 activates stress proteins that may protect neurons against subsequent injurious stimuli [10]. Gillardon and colleagues also analyzed global changes in protein phosphorylation and gene expression in cultured cerebellar granule neurons by (32P) orthophosphate labeling after the administration of a Cdk5 inhibitor. They found that Indolinone A treatment regulated protein phosphorylation and gene expression of candidates involved in neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic functions [11]. More recently, using high-density protein microarrays of Indolinone A-treated cerebellar granule neurons the same group identified two other potential Cdk5 substrates: Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 14A and Coiled-coil domain containing protein 97 [12]. Another phosphoproteomic study using a solid-phase capture-release-tag approach identified and suggested that Tau and MAP2 contain a Cdk5 phosphorylation motif [13].\n\nIn this study, we carried out systematic phosphoproteomic analysis of the Cdk5+/+ and Cdk5−/− mice brains. We analyzed E18.5 mouse brain lysates using IMAC followed by iTRAQ and mass spectrometry. We discovered forty proteins with decreased phosphorylation at Cdk5 motifs in the Cdk5−/− brain. These proteins contained one or more phosphopeptides containing the canonical consensus phosphorylation motif for Cdk5 [5]. From the list of 40 protein candidates derived from HTS, we selected two proteins related to neurite outgrowth for further analysis. They were MARCKS (Myristoylated Alanine-Rich C Kinase Substrate) and Grin1 (G-protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth). MARCKS was originally discovered as the main PKC substrate in the CNS [14], [15], but it is also phosphorylatable by proline-directed kinases [16]. Interestingly for the purpose of this study is the fact that Cdk5 phosphorylates MARCKS at Ser25 in chick neuroblasts in vivo (Ser27 in mammals) [29]. Grin1 is highly expressed in the nervous system during development and it has been suggested that it has an important function in neuronal migration and brain formation [17]. The results presented here confirmed that chick MARCKS is phosphorylated by murine endogenous Cdk5 when it, was overexpressed in neuroblastoma N2a cells, altogether with p35. For the first time, we also show that Grin1 is a substrate for this kinase in analogous experimental conditions. Both proteins were not phosphorylated when Cdk5 was inhibited by roscovitine.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAnimals\n\nCdk5 knockout mice (Cdk5−/−) were generated as previously described [7]. Female Cdk5+/− mice pregnant were euthanized at E18.5 with a lethal injection of Ketamine/Xilacine mix. The genotype of each mouse was determined by PCR from DNA obtained from tail biopsies. For primary culture of rat hippocampal neurons, female rats Sprague-Dawley pregnant were euthanized at E18.5 with a lethal injection of Ketamine/Xilacine mix. These studies were performed in compliance with the National Institutes of Health's Guidelines on the Care and Use of Laboratory and Experimental Animals. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIH, and the Bioethical Committee of the Faculty of Sciences, University of Chile, according to the ethical rules of the Biosafety Policy Manual of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT).\n\nPhosphoprotein enrichment\n\nTen whole brains of E18.5 from Cdk5+/+ and Cdk5−/− mice were homogenized using the buffer provided in the PhosphoProtein Purification Kit (QIAGEN #37101, Valencia, CA, USA), in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, protein extracts were loaded in columns, washed, eluted, and quantified by the Bradford method [18].\n\nProtein digestion\n\nOne mg of phosphoprotein obtained from brain lysates was dried in the SpeedVac (ThermoSavant, Farmingham, NY, USA) and then dissolved in 8 M urea, 0.4 M NH4HCO3 for reduction by dithiothreitol and alkylation by indole acetic acid. After dilution into 2 M urea, 0.1 M NH4HCO3, tryptic digestion was performed as described before [19].\n\nQuantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) of phosphoproteins\n\nThe identification and quantitation of phosphoproteins obtained from Cdk5+/+ and Cdk5−/− mice were performed as previously described [20]. Briefly, we performed an iTRAQ procedure which is a non-gel based technique that incorporates isotope-coded covalent labeling of the N-terminus and side-chain amines of peptides with tags of varying mass (114.1; 115.1; 116.1; 117.1) (Absciex, Foster City, CA, USA). The samples were combined and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). In order to identify the labeled peptides and corresponding proteins, we used SEQUEST (http://fields.scripps.edu/sequest/) to quantify the low molecular mass reporter ion generated by the fragmentation of the attached tag and consequently the peptides and proteins from which they originated.\n\nLC/MS/MS analysis\n\nSamples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS on LTQ XL (linear trap quadraplole) with 2 Surveyor MS Pump plus HPLC pumps and Micro AS (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and they were equipped with an Advance ESI (electrospray ionization) source (Michrom Bioresources Inc., Auburn, CA, USA). The equipment was used with an instrument configuration, columns, gradient, and source conditions as previously described [19]. The LTQ XL was set up to acquire a survey scan between m/z 400–1400 followed by a PQD MS/MS spectrum on each of the top 10 most abundant ions in the survey scan. Source conditions were as previously described and are listed here as follows: capillary temperature, 165°C; sheath gas flow, 2 U; spray voltage, 1.6 kV. Key optimized PQD instrument parameters (32) were as follows: CE, 35%; isolation width, 3 m/z; activation Q, 0.700; activation time, 0.100 ms; minimum signal threshold, 10,000 cts; dynamic exclusion, repeat count 2, repeat duration 30 s, exclusion duration 60 s; MS/MS target, 4.0 X e4; maximum fill time, 100 ms; 4 microscans.\n\nData analysis and iTRAQ quantitation\n\nPQD MS/MS spectra were searched in the mouse database utilizing BioWorks 3.3.1 SP1 (Thermo Scientific) for site-specific phosphopeptide identification and iTRAQ quantification. The search parameters were set and data analysis was done as previously described [19]. Briefly, the search parameters were set as follows: static modifications: C = 57.0215, N-term = 144, and K = 144; differential modifications: S, T, Y = 79.9799 and M = 16. The search results were reported in descending order of the X correlation (XC) score subject to the default charge vs. XC filter: 1+ = 1.50, 2+ = 2.00, and 3+ = 2.50. Sequence assignments including the specific phosphorylated residue, were based on the selection of the phosphopeptide with the highest XC score, which is concurrent with the second ranked peptide displaying a ΔCn (the difference in the normalized XC score between the top scoring sequence and the next highest scoring sequence) of 0.1. MS/MS spectra were manually reviewed for spectral quality and the assignment of most major ions.\n\nTransient transfection of N2A cell line\n\nMouse neuroblastoma N2A cells (ATCC#CCL-131) were transiently co-transfected with pBC12/pCMV-60k plasmid (chicken MARCKS) from Dr. Perry Blackshear [21] and pBI-p35/EGFP vector [22] and tTA vector in Opti-MEM with Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in DMEM. After 4 h of transfection, the solution was changed for DMEM plus 10% FBS, and the cells were treated with roscovitine (20 µM) during 20 h until protein extracts were made.\n\nTransient transfection of primary hippocampal neurons in culture\n\nRat primary hippocampal neurons were performed as described before [23]. Briefly, hippocampal neurons from Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (E18.5) were dissociated after treatment for 20 min with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin (Gibco). 3×105 cells were plated in coverslips previously coated with poly-D-lysine 1 mg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich) in Neurobasal medium (Gibco) including 10% horse serum and Glutamine (Gibco). Then, neurons were transiently transfected with 0.6 µg of plasmid DNA (0.3 µg of CMV-GFP vector and 0.3 µg of chicken MARKCS vector) for 2 h and then the medium was replaced with Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and Glutamax (Gibco) in the absence of serum. Cells were kept in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C during 48 h and half of the covers were treated with roscovitine 10 µM. After 24 h neurons were fixed for posterior immunofluorescence against phosphor Ser25 MARCKS and DAPI.\n\nWestern Blot\n\nProtein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay [18]. In brief, 30 µg of protein were loaded and run in 10% or 12% polyacrylamide gels at 100 V. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in 120 mM glycine, 125 mM Tris, 0.1% SDS and 20% methanol, at 200 mA for 1 h. Then, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS1X-0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS1X-0.1% Tween-20 at 4°C. The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with the following antibodies: mAb 3C3 (mouse monoclonal anti-S25p-MARCKS [24]) diluted in blocking solution; Polo52 (rabbit polyclonal anti-MARCKS antibody, serum diluted 1∶2000 [25]); anti-β-actin 1∶2000 (sc-69879, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-p35 (sc-820, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); α-tubulin (T9026) and phospho-serine (P5447) antibodies were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA); Phospho-MAPK/CDK Substrates Rabbit mAb #2325 (Cell Signaling Technology, Denver, MA, USA); anti-Grin1 116 was obtained from Dr. Tohru Kozasa from Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago USA. Secondary antibodies horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA, USA). Secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (31430, Thermo Scientific) used at a dilution of 1∶10000 in blocking solution. Nitrocellulose membranes were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 15 min and then the labeling was visualized with ECL reagent (32106, Thermo Scientific). All of Western blot data are representative of at least three independent experiments.\n\nImmunoprecipitation assays\n\n500 µg of protein from the whole mouse brain or the transfected N2A cells were immunoprecipitated in 500 µl of TPER buffer (Pierce) with 1–2 µg of Grin1, MARCKS, or Cdk5 antibodies overnight at 4°C in a shaker. Then, 30 µl of Protein A/G (Sigma) was added and incubated for 4 h at 4°C in a shaker. The immunocomplexes were centrifuged at 4°C during 5 min at 1000×g and washed 4 times in cold PBS1X. The loading buffer 5× (tris-HCl 62 mM, Glycerol 25%, SDS 2%, β-mercaptoethanol 10%, bromophenol blue 0.1%) was added into the beads and samples, and they were boiled at 95°C for 5 min and ran in SDS-PAGE gels.\n\nGene ontology analysis\n\nThe PANTHER (Protein analysis through evolutionary relationships) Classification System was used to classify proteins. The proteins were classified according to family and subfamily of molecular function, biological process and signaling pathway [26], [27]. The Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) software was also used to analyze the data [28].\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nAll experiments were performed at a minimum of three times. A statistical evaluation was performed with GraphPad Prism software, version 5.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). The significant differences between experiments were assessed by an unpaired Student test where α was set to 0.05.\n\nDiscussion\n\nCdk5, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is involved in many important cellular processes associated with brain development and function. It is also implicated in disease processes associated with neurodegeneration. Cdk5 brings about its effect by phosphorylating a large number of target substrates, resulting in their activation or deactivation. These substrates play key roles in hippocampal neurogenesis, neuronal migration, cytoskeletal dynamics and synaptic plasticity [35]. It is therefore not surprising that novel substrates of Cdk5 that are being identified have important functions in both CNS and PNS [6], [36]. In the present study, we carried out comparative quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of E18.5 Cdk5+/+ and Cdk5−/− brains to search for new Cdk5 substrates. We carried out phosphoprotein enrichment using the IMAC procedure and utilized iTRAQ for peptide labeling and quantification. We found decreased phosphorylation in 55 Cdk5-consensus sites in 40 phosphoproteins from Cdk5−/− brain as compared with Cdk5+/+ brains. The phosphoproteins found in our study are involved in different signaling pathways and regulate several cellular processes in the nervous system such as cytoskeletal regulation, axonal growth, axonal guidance and synapse formation. Cdk5 is known to regulate these biological processes through the phosphorylation of key substrates such as PAK1, β-catenin, Src, Nudel, synapsin, MUNC18, and amphyphysin among others proteins [1], [35].\n\nMARCKS and Grin1 were two phosphoproteins among the total of 40 identified in our HTS phosphoproteomic analysis of Cdk5−/− brain. We further characterized the Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of MARCKS and Grin1 in N2A cell line and mouse brain. MARCKS plays a pivotal role during neural development, since the inactivation of MARCKS gene results in abnormal brain development and perinatal death [37]. The functional role of MARCKS has been associated with regulation of growth cone adhesion, axon pathfinding [38] and dendritic spine morphology [39]. Interestingly, the defects found in mice lacking MARCKS were restored by the expression of certain mutated non-phosphorylated form of MARCKS, suggesting that some of the MARCKS functions were independent of its phosphorylation by PKC and possibly involved another phosphorylation sites phosphorylated by other kinase(s) [40]. In support of this suggestion, MARCKS phosphomutants which were used to restore the expression in null mice were indeed in a specific PKC region. MARCKS is also phosphorylated by MAPK and Cdks [32] and its Ser27 is phosphorylated in vitro by the Cdk2-cyclin E complex [41]. The phosphorylation of Ser27 (corresponding to Ser25 in chicken) is dependent on the integrity of actin cytoskeleton [42] and it has been found only in post mitotic neural cells during chicken embryo development [43], [44] thus suggesting an important role in brain morphogenesis. In our study, we found decreased phosphorylation of MARCKS at three different sites: Ser27, Ser138 and Thr143 in Cdk5−/− brain. Interestingly, it was previously suggested that Ser27 (or Ser25 in chicken) could be phosphorylated by Cdk5 [25] and the bioinformatics analyses using a Cdk5 specific PSSM [5]. The NetphosK [31] tools confirmed that Ser27 had the higher probability to be phosphorylated by Cdk5. To further confirm this Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation at Ser27 site in MARCKS, we overexpressed chicken MARCKS and p35 into N2A cells and then evaluated Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of Ser25 using an specific antibody [25]. Our results clearly indicated that phosphorylation of Ser25 was increased in N2A cells over-expressing p35 and it was decreased with the treatment with roscovitine of N2A cells and rat hippocampal neurons, suggesting that the phosphorylation of this residue is dependent of the Cdk5 activity. Additionally, MARCKS phosphorylation by PKC is regulated by PP2A, PP1 and PP2B [25]. We hypothesize that the Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of mouse MARCKS at Ser27 can positively regulate the binding of MARCKS to the plasma membrane and actin filaments. In this context, it was reported that the non-PKC phosphorylated MARCKS (membrane-bound) is involved in memory formation and contributes to stabilization of synaptic morphology [45]. Because Cdk5 is also involved in learning and memory processes [46], [47] we speculate that Cdk5 plays an important role in these processes through phosphorylation of MARCKS at Ser27 (Figure 4A).\n\nA) Phosphorylation of MARCKS by Cdk5 could modulate its interaction with actin filaments leading to stabilization of actin cytoskeleton. B) Involvement of Grin1 phosphorylation by Cdk5 in actin dynamics and neurite outgrowth. GPCR stimulation activates MAPK signaling pathway with increased of Egr1 and p35 expressions and subsequent increases in Cdk5 activity, which in turn phosphorylate Grin1. Additionally, GPCR stimulation promotes neurite outgrowth possibly mediated by the phosphorylation of Grin1 by Cdk5 and Cdc42-PAK-LimK-Cofilin pathway.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090363.g004\n\nWe also found that Grin1 displayed decreased phosphorylation in two residues Ser369 and Ser691 in Cdk5−/− brain. Ser369 corresponds to Cdk5 SPXK motif [5] whereas Ser691 corresponds to the Cdk5 KSP motif [34]. Moreover, Grin1 has two more sites which include a minimal consensus motif for Cdk5 phosphorylation, Ser519 and Ser622. Although Ser519 and Ser622 sites in Grin1 were previously reported to be phosphorylated in brain [48], [49], our phosphoproteomic analysis found significant decrease only in the phosphorylation of Ser369 and Ser691 sites. This suggests that the phosphorylation of Ser519 and Ser622 could be dependent on other kinases. Since we used an antibody that specifically detects phosphorylation by Cdk5 on the SPXK motif, Ser369 is the epitope in Grin1 phosphorylated by Cdk5. When we overexpressed p35 in N2a cells, we observed a significant increase in the serine phosphorylation of Grin1. This was recognized by the same antibody, while roscovitine treatment restored phosphorylation to the basal level. This indicated that phosphorylation of Ser369 on Grin1 is dependent on the Cdk5 kinase activity Grin1, Gap43 and Gαi/o protein are part of a G-couple receptor signaling pathway that regulates neurite growth in neural cells [50]. Interestingly, Gap43 is another protein which is differentially phosphorylated in Cdk5 null brains (Table 1). Grin1 does not contain conserved protein-protein interaction domains, however, it was reported its interaction with the activated subunits of Gz/Gi and Go [51] which are the proteins associated with G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Grin1 is located mainly at neuronal growth cones and when it is co-expressed with Go in N2A cells induces neurite elongation, suggesting that Grin1 is an effector of Go [52]. Besides, the co-expression of constitutively active Go and Grin1 are related to increase Cdc42 activity [17]. It was reported that Cdk5/p35 complex have been associated with motility and stabilization of growth cone during the axon elongation [53], [54]. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of Ser369 on Grin1 could be part of a network signaling controlled by Cdk5, regulating the elongation and maintenance of axons as well as the stability of growth cones. The stimulation of some GPCRs caused MAPK cascade activation [55]. Also, the signal transduction activated by second messenger-dependent kinases and the crosstalk between GPCRs and tyrosine kinases can induce ERK1/2 activation [56]. Interestingly, the ERK1/2 signaling pathway is a major regulator of Cdk5 activity through control of Egr1 and p35 expression [57]–[59]. Therefore, we suggest that extracellular signals that stimulate GCPRs with a subsequent activation of ERK1/2 can induce the expression of p35 increasing Cdk5 activity and maintaining a sustained response in time, reinforcing a potential signaling cascade through Grin1 necessary for axonal growth (Figure 4B).\n\nAmongst the candidates identified to be potential Cdk5 substrates there is a group of proteins involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. This group encompasses Collapsin response mediator protein 1 (crmp1), Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (crmp2), Collapsin response mediator protein 4 (crmp4), microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B), microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2), tau, doublecortin (DCX) and stathmin. It has been previously shown that crmp1, crmp2 and crmp4 are phosphorylated by Cdk5 [60]–[62]. MAP1B is the first MAP expressed during nervous system development [63]–[64]. When phosphorylated by proline-directed protein kinases, such as gsk3β [65], JNK [66] and Cdk5 [67], becomes highly enriched in the axonal compartment. Currently; antibodies directed against phosphorylated MAP1B are insensitive to Cdk5 inactivation. Therefore, it is likely that epitopes found differentially phosphorylated in this study may serve to identify novel MAP1B phosphorylation involved in axon formation. DCX is a microtubule-associated protein involved in neuronal migration [68]. Phosphorylation of Ser297 in DCX is mediated by Cdk5 and regulates neuronal migration [69]. However, other DCX phosphoepitopes had been described including Ser339 found in this study [70]. It will be interesting to address the consequences for Thr336 and Ser339 phosphorylation upon microtubule dynamics and neuronal migration, the canonical DCX functions. MAP2 is a novel potential Cdk5 substrate. Previously, it was shown that MAP2 can be phosphorylated in CAD cells displaying increased Cdk5 activity [71]. However, the functional role for Cdk5-dependent MAP2 phosphorylation still remains elusive. It is tempting to speculate that such phosphorylation may be related with changes in dendrite formation and plasticity. Tau, is an axonal microtubule associated protein widely expressed in the nervous system. It is abnormally phosphorylated in brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease [72]. Amyloid-β peptide induce tau phosphorylation by activating protein kinases such as gsk3β [73] and Cdk5 [74]. Therefore, decreased tau phosphoepitopes here presented may serve as molecular markers for neurodegeneration associated to Cdk5 functions.\n\nIn summary, our phosphoproteomics analysis of Cdk5 null brain identified decreased phosphorylation in several potential Cdk5 proteins that are involved in neuronal morphology, metabolism and signal transduction. These phosphoproteome data may provide a basis for identifying new Cdk5 substrates; however, further work is required to determine how the novel substrates or sites identified in our study regulates process such as cytoskeleton dynamics, neuronal migration and synapses formation and stability."
