        "text": "Materials\n\nAnti-HA (Y-11) and anti-β-actin (C4) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-CRMP2 (C terminus)γ was from ECM biosciences. Anti-α-tubulin, anti-γ-tubulin, anti-polyhistidine, anti-FLAG, anti-FLAG M2 beads, and epothilone B were from Sigma. Anti-Glu tubulin was from Millipore. Anti-β-tubulin was from Cell Signaling. The MuLV RT enzyme was from New England Biolabs, and RNase inhibitor was from Roche Applied Science. A Cdk1 inhibitor RO3306 was from Tocris, and taxol (Paclitaxel, semisynthetic) was from Calbiochem. Purified bovine brain tubulin (TL238) was from Cytoskeleton Inc. HRP-coupled secondary antibodies blot were from Dako. Secondary antibodies used for indirect immuno-fluorescence were from Molecular Probes.\n\nCell Culture and Synchronization\n\nCOS7, OLDN-93, NIH3T3, and N1E-115 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. NIH3T3 or OLDN-93 cells were synchronized overnight with 9 μm RO-3306. The synchronized cells at G2/M phase were released with three washes of media. To determine the effect of taxol/epothilone B on mitotic spindle-bound CRMP2, 25 min after release, 100 nm epothilone B or 200 nm taxol was added to the media, and cells were fixed 15 min later. To determine the effect of the drugs on midzone MT-bound CRMP2, 50 nm epothilone B or 100 nm taxol was added 80 min after release and then fixed 15 min later.\n\nGeneration of CRMP, MAP6, Stathmin, and Tau Constructs\n\nConstructs encoding the ORF of rat CRMPs 1–4 and MAP6 were cloned into pXJ-HA via HindIII/XhoI restriction sites. The respective primers are documented in supplemental Table S1. The C-terminal CRMP1(480–572), CRMP1(491–572), and CRMP2(480–572) were cloned into pXJ-GST with 5′-HindIII and 3′-XhoI cloning sites. Full-length CRMP1 was cloned into a modified pET21D His6 vector for expression in bacteria. CRMP1(491–572) was cloned into pGEX4T1 using introduced 5′-BamHI and 3′-XhoI restriction sites. Mouse stathmin was amplified from total cDNA and cloned via 5′-BamHI and 3′-XhoI restriction sites into pGEX4T1. The C-terminal fragment of Tau was amplified from total cDNA and cloned via 5′-BamHI and 3′-XhoI restriction sites into pQE30. The primers employed are listed in supplemental Table S1.\n\nReverse Transcriptase-PCR\n\nTotal RNA was obtained from cells according to standard protocol (RNeasy mini kit, Qiagen). The RNA was quantified, and 2 μg was subjected to each reverse transcription reaction. Synthesis of the cDNAs was performed with MuLV RT under standard conditions. The primers employed are given in supplemental Table S1.\n\nDNA and dsRNA Transfection\n\nCells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (3 μl) and 1 μof g DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed 24 h after transfection. For RNAi, the ratio of 20 pmol to 3 μl of the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent was used. The siRNAs were synthesized by Invitrogen. Double-stranded CRMP2 siRNA sequences contained 3′-dTdT overhangs: CRMP2 SiA (5′ACUCCUUCCUCGUGUACAUdTdT-3′) and CRMP2 SiB (5′CCCACUCCAGAAUGGUGAUdTdT-3′). Cells were typically used 48 h after transfection.\n\nRecombinant Protein Purification\n\npGEX4T1-CRMP1(491-572) or pGEX4T1-stathmin plasmid was transformed to Escherichia coli BL-21 and induced with 10 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 25 °C. Bacteria were harvested at 6,000 rpm (10 min at 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by adding 1 mg/ml lysozyme (4 °C, 30 min). The supernatant (13,500 rpm, 30 min at 4 °C) was added to glutathione-Sepharose (GenScript, 20 ml of lysate to 1 ml of beads) and washed with lysis buffer. The GST fusion proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced l-glutathione (Sigma) and dialyzed against PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8). Protein concentration was measured using a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). His6-CRMP1 and His6-Tau CT constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21. The protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Qiagen). Briefly, the bacteria pellet was resuspended in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Lysis was performed as above for pGEX constructs. The supernatant fractions containing His6-tagged proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's conditions. Recombinant His6-tagged proteins were eluted from the beads with 300 mm imidazole and dialyzed against PEM buffer.\n\nWestern Analysis\n\ndsRNA transfected cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate and protease inhibitor mixture. The lysates were spun in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein sample buffer was added into the supernatants and boiled before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All the protein samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk in 0.05% Tween 20, PBS buffer for 30 min and incubated with primary and secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies diluted in 1% milk, 0.05% Tween 20, PBS buffer for 2 and 1 h, respectively, at room temperature.\n\nIn Vitro Microtubule Co-sedimentation\n\nPurified tubulin was made up to 5 mg/ml in 10% glycerol-PEM buffer. The tubulin was preclarified by high speed centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C (100,000 × g, TL100 centrifuge, Beckman). The tubulin solution was polymerized at 37 °C for 30 min with 1 mm DTT, 1× protease inhibitor, 1 mm GTP, and the recombinant proteins (GST, His6-CRMP1, and His6-Tau at 0.2 mg/ml), with or without 10 μm taxol. The final tubulin concentration was 2 mg/ml. Microtubules were spun down at 65,000 rpm for 15 min at 25 °C. The pellets were washed with warm PEM buffer. The pellets and supernatants were diluted with SDS sample buffers and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.\n\nSurface Plasmon Resonance Measurements (BIAcore 2000)\n\nCM5 chips and HEPES-buffered saline were used for analyte (GE Healthcare) with a flow rate of 15 μl/min. A reference flow cell contained immobilized GST protein. Dialyzed recombinant GST CRMP1(491–572), His6-CRMP1, and GST-stathmin were precleared at 90,000 rpm, 10 min (TLA100, Beckman) before coupling to the CM5 chip, and unreacted sites were blocked with 0.1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Pure bovine tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc.) dissolved in PEM+T (80 mm PIPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 6.8) was preclarified at 90,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The sensor chip was regenerated with 30 μl of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 300 mm KCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. Traces were corrected with respect to the GST control sensorgram.\n\nNocodazole Stability Assay and Immuno-fluorescence Analysis\n\nCOS7 cells were treated with 2 μm nocodazole for 45 min, and fixed in a stabilizing buffer (0.15% Triton X-100, 1% paraformaldehyde-PEM buffer) for 5 min, and transferred to 3% paraformaldehyde/PEM (10 min). To inhibit GSK3, cells were serum-starved for 3 h and treated with 20 mm LiCl or 20 mm NaCl for 2 h before adding nocodazole. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min and blocked with 1% FBS in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min and then blocked with 10% FBS/PBS. Primary antibodies were diluted in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS and incubated with the cells at 32 °C and then washed with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS. Secondary antibodies (anti-mouse/rabbit Alexa Fluor-488 or Alexa Fluor-546; 1:500) were incubated and washed under similar conditions. Far-red phalloidin and Hoechst dye were added in during the secondary antibody incubation step. Cells were mounted and viewed by Zeiss Axioplan2, and images were collected on a CoolSNAP HQ (Roper Scientific) camera using a 63× 1.4 NA oil lens. Confocal imaging was performed using Olympus FluoView 1000 using a 60×/100× oil lens. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop and Image J. Deconvolution was performed using the Huygens professional software (Scientific Volume Imaging).\n\nBoth CRMP1 and CRMP2 Localize to Mitotic Microtubules\n\nCRMPs 1–5 are the products of five genes, some of which are highly expressed during neuronal development, but some of which are also ubiquitously expressed (27, 28). CRMPs are abundant proteins that exist as cytosolic tetramers (14, 29, 30), of which CRMP2 is the best studied as an essential mediator of growth cone collapse induced by Sema3A signaling (2, 3). CRMP2 itself accumulates in growth cones and also promotes multiple axons when ectopically overexpressed (21, 31). CRMP2 is suggested to play this role through tubulin (dimer) transport along axons by binding to kinesin-1 (22). This might allow proper MT assembly at the growth cone (22). CRMP1 and CRMP2 have been at the mitotic spindle and midzone MTs, but the biochemical basis for this localization has not been described (18, 19).\n\nTo investigate further the relationship between endogenous CRMP family proteins and MTs in mitotic cells, we first examined CRMP isoforms 1–5 in several cell types using RT-PCR and then CRMP1- and CRMP2-specific antibodies. COS7 (monkey large-T transformed fibroblast line), mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, oligodendrocytic OLDN-93, and normal mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts all expressed CRMP2 ( A). CRMP1 protein was not detected in the fibroblastic COS7 and NIH3T3 lines. All these cell lines express CRMP2 and CRMP4 mRNA at comparable levels; CRMP4 has recently been investigated in the context of cell mitosis (32).\n\nOLDN-93 cells had the highest relative amounts of CRMP2 protein ( A), facilitating staining of the endogenous CRMP2 by indirect immuno-fluorescence. Here CRMP2 was present in mitotic structures and in puncta along the mitotic spindle at metaphase and on the midzone MTs in late telophase ( B). Exogenous HA-tagged CRMP1 was similarly localized on the mitotic spindle and midzone MTs in these cells (data not shown). CRMP2 puncta were also detected on astral MT ( B, white arrows; anaphase). In summary, we find that both CRMP1 and CRMP2 proteins closely associate with mitotic structures that are enriched for MTs, suggesting that this is a general feature of CRMPs.\n\nMicrotubule Binding Determinants Lie outside the Dihydropyrimidinase-like Domain\n\nThe shorter ∼65-kDa isoforms of CRMP1 and CRMP2 are polypeptides of 572 residues ( B). Structural analyses of CRMP2 (residues 13–490) reveal the secondary structure of the tetrameric dihydropyrimidinase-like domain, but not of the flexible C-terminal 82 residues (5, 33). It has been reported that central residues 323–381 within the dihydropyrimidinase domain function to promote MT assembly by binding to tubulin dimers (21). However, HA-CRMP1(1–490) failed to bind to midzone MTs in vivo ( , A and B), instead implicating the C-terminal region (residues 490–572) in this interaction. We generated a series of C-terminal truncated proteins to delineate the requirements in this region ( B). Microtubule association tolerated the deletion of 12 C-terminal residues (i.e. CRMP1 1–560), but not the further deletion of 10 residues (CRMP1 1–550) ( , A and B).\n\nCRMP2 Depletion Affects Astral Microtubules in Mitosis\n\nThe mitotic spindle allows proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division, a function targeted by a number of drugs that affect MT dynamics. It is assembled as an anti-parallel array of MTs with their “minus” ends fixed onto the centrosomes and their dynamic “plus” ends projecting toward the chromosomes. Because CRMPs were clearly localized to mitotic MT arrays, we reasoned that these proteins could contribute to their dynamics. In the course of this work, a new study showed that loss of CRMP4 disrupts chromosomal alignment and mitotic progression (32). We investigated siRNA-mediated knockdown of CRMP2 in OLDN-93 cells, in which it is abundantly expressed ( A). After siRNA treatment (supplemental Fig. S1A), ∼60% of the cells showed no detectable CRMP2 by immuno-staining (data not shown), allowing us to pinpoint affected cells. Consistent with a cell cycle effect, we noted that cells without CRMP2 took more time to go through mitosis (from cell rounding to re-attachment, data not shown), although we did not observe an effect on chromosome attachment as reported for CRMP4 in HeLa cells (32).\n\nTo examine the effects of CRMP2 knockdown, mitotic CRMP2-depleted OLDN-93 cells were stained for tubulin (α and γ), endogenous CRMP2, and F-actin (with phalloidin) ( ) In control OLDN-93 cells during anaphase, CRMP2 exhibited punctate staining around the area of the centrosome (stained for γ-tubulin, A) and along the elongating central MT spindle (stained for α-tubulin, B). In mitotic cells stained for α-tubulin, MTs that emanate from the spindle away from the plane of division, termed astral MTs, are detected (using deconvolution image analysis; Huygens Professional software). In CRMP2 knockdown cells, there was significant reduction in the density of astral MTs ( B), and the spindle lies closer to the cortical cell membrane at anaphase ( A and schematic in C). Quantification of this spindle pole-to-cortex distance, stained respectively with γ-tubulin antibody and phalloidin, revealed an ∼37% reduction in this distance in CRMP2 knockdown cells (mean = 1.25 μm) versus control cells (mean = 1.95 μm). There was also a diminished density of astral MTs (compare B, inset), which probably reflects a general effect on integrity of MT structures. A similar effect on the spindle pole-to-cortex distance was also observed in NIH3T3 cells with CRMP2 knockdown (data not shown) suggesting that this is a general role of CRMP2. Thus, CRMP2, perhaps in the context of hetero-dimers with CRMP1 or CRMP4 (1), promotes MT stabilization during mitosis, and this is manifested in knockdown cells as a reduction in astral MTs. This is also consistent with the need for CRMP4 in proper chromosomal alignment (32).\n\nCRMP Binds Exclusively Assembled Microtubules in Vitro\n\nCurrent models of CRMP function include an interaction with tubulin dimers to regulate their intracellular (axonal) transport (22) or promote their assembly (21). To test whether CRMP could bind directly to polymeric MTs assembled in vitro, we generated full-length purified CRMP1 in bacteria, to avoid co-purifying MAPs. Purified recombinant His6-tagged protein was added to pure tubulin dimers assembled in GTP (without MAPs) and tested for binding by co-sedimentation. Tau C-terminal fragment (Tau CT) containing MT binding repeats (a positive control) and CRMP1 were each efficiently co-sedimented with MTs into the pellet fraction ( A), but not recombinant GST protein.\n\nTo re-assess the binding of CRMP to soluble tubulin (21), we carried out immuno-precipitation of overexpressed FLAG-CRMP1 or FLAG-CRMP2 from cellular lysates, under conditions to stabilize the tubulin (in buffer containing 5% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT). After high speed centrifugation to remove all assembled MTs, FLAG-CRMP1 and FLAG-CRMP2, which were easily visible even in total cell lysates ( B, arrows), were recovered on M2-Sepharose ( B, left side). No tubulin was detected in CRMP1 or CRMP2 pulldown, although >5 μg each of CRMP was loaded (compare Coomassie Blue staining).\n\nWe next immobilized recombinant full-length His6-CRMP1 and GST-CRMP1(491–572) C terminus on a CM5 chip (BIAcore) and tested pure tubulin binding by surface plasmon resonance ( C). Parallel assays were performed with stathmin as a positive control (34). In contrast to a previous study (25), injections of freshly clarified assembly-competent tubulin dimers (with E-site charged with either GDP or GTP) failed to generate any signal with either full-length CRMP1 or its C terminus when compared with stathmin. These results based on purified recombinant proteins indicate that CRMPs do not bind unassembled tubulin dimer. The experimental differences with earlier literature are unclear, although in our study, high speed ultracentrifugation was used to remove all the assembled tubulin from lysates, and buffers were selected to stabilize the tubulin during immuno-precipitation ( B). Sepharose is reported to non-specifically retain multiple cytoskeletal proteins including tubulin (35).\n\nCRMP1 and CRMP2 Can Associate with Interphase Microtubules\n\nTo assess whether CRMPs are MT-associated in interphase cells, cytosolic proteins were first removed through a brief pre-permeabilization step before cell fixation (see “Experimental Procedures”). In OLDN-93 cells, endogenous CRMP2 was observed concentrated in the perinuclear region and in thin processes, which are MT-rich (supplemental Fig. S1B, red arrows); this anti-CRMP2 staining was reduced by 48 h of siRNA treatment. In the same way, interphase COS7 cells showed HA-tagged CRMP2 concentrated around the MT-organizing center ( A); in the enlarged area, one can see that there is excellent colocalization between HA-CRMP (red) and anti-tubulin staining (green). The control HA-GST protein was only retained in the nucleus. We conclude that CRMP1 and CRMP2 show significant interactions with both mitotic and interphase MTs in vivo.\n\nTo test whether the isolated C-terminal sequences could function as an autonomous MT binding domain, we expressed GST-CRMP1(491–572) and carried out the same protocol. This protein was retained on the interphase MT network (supplemental Fig. S2). We conclude that the C-terminal domain is sufficient to associate with assembled MTs in vivo. We refer to this conserved region as the C-terminal MT binding domain (CMBD) of CRMPs.\n\nMicrotubule-stabilizing Agents Displace CRMP from Microtubules\n\nWe noted that CRMP2 was absent from mitotic spindles in cells synchronized by taxol treatment (data not shown). Indeed, in cells synchronized with the CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 and then treated with taxol or epothilone B for 15 min, CRMP2 was consistently lost from all mitotic spindles ( B) and midzone MTs (supplemental Fig. S3). Taxol and the epothilones stabilize MTs through binding to an overlapping binding site on tubulin, which is thought to induce a GTP-like state (36). Thus, in vivo CRMP appears to be sensitive to the tubulin conformation induced by these drugs, in contrast to MAPs, which interact with the acidic C termini of tubulins (37–40). An alternate explanation is that taxol-induced MT stabilization signals to pathways that negatively regulate CRMP binding. The weaker in vitro association of CRMP1 with assembled MTs in the presence of taxol, however, does support a direct effect (supplemental Fig. S4). CRMPs may therefore have an opposite MT binding selectivity to plus-end tracking proteins binders such as EB1, which bind GTP-tubulin (41, 42).\n\nA recent study suggests that GSK3 activity is needed for CRMP4 to bind the mitotic spindle (32). To assess whether the well described CRMP2 modification by GSK3β (32) is similarly required, we investigated CRMP2 in synchronized and mitotic OLDN-93 cells treated with LiCl to inhibit GSK3 (43). CRMP2 association with the mitotic spindle was unaffected under these conditions ( C). These data support our subsequent findings that GSK3 activity blocks CRMP2 (and CRMP1) binding to MTs (as described below).\n\nCRMP Expression Generates Stable Interphase Microtubules\n\nIn view of the ability of CRMPs to bind to MTs, we sought a quantitative cell-based assay to measure the outcome of such binding and to investigate cell signaling events related to the phosphorylation of CRMPs. Microtubule co-sedimentation assays were not suitable because these rely on taxol-mediated stabilization of cellular MTs. We also found that CRMP1 expression has no overt effect on overall MT disposition or density in non-mitotic COS7 cells (data not shown). In most cultured cells, only a small subset of MTs (primarily those near the MT-organizing center) are stable with t½ of <15 min (44). However expression of some MAPs can generate extensive arrays of stable MTs, also described as “cold stable.” Such MTs are marked by detyrosinated tubulin (termed Glu-tubulin) and appear in the direction of cell migration (45). In cells expressing HA-CRMP1, we observed increased Glu-tubulin staining on the MT network ( A), clearly indicating that CRMP1, like other MAPs, prolongs the lifetime of cellular MTs.\n\nStable MTs also show resistance to depolymerization by nocodazole, a simple test of their stability. Both CRMP1, which can form filaments that partially map to the MT network, and CRMP2 (which does not) caused a striking increase in the number of cells exhibiting nocodazole-resistant stable MTs ( , B and C, and supplemental Fig. S5). By contrast, CRMP1(1–490) had no effect on MT stability on nocodazole treatment, consistent with its inability to associate with mitotic MTs. This smaller CRMP1 construct also formed filament-like structures independent of MTs. As expected, transfection of the stable tubule-only polypeptide (STOP), or MAP6, which is extremely potent in conferring nocodazole resistance (46), caused a striking increase in nocodazole-resistant MTs. We quantified the fraction of cells expressing moderate levels of CRMPs and containing significant levels of nocodazole-resistant MTs ( C). Full-length CRMP1 was consistently a better MT stabilizer than CRMP2 in this assay (∼50% of expressing cells).\n\nThe CRMP1-stabilizing activity on MTs was highly robust in this assay on nocodazole-treated cells. The number of cells exhibiting stabilized MTs was >10-fold higher in cells expressing full-length CRMP1 when compared with the inactive truncated mutants ( C). This allowed more detailed mutational analysis of the C-terminal CMBD. Finer CRMP1 C-terminal truncation constructs ( B) were tested, as illustrated in supplemental Fig. S6. Although CRMP1(1–565) retained low activity, CRMP1(1–550) was completely without activity, as were larger deletions (supplemental Fig. S6). Thus, we find striking correlation between the capacity for mitotic MT localization of CRMP1 deletion mutants ( , A and B) and their ability to stabilize interphase MTs ( C and supplemental Fig. S6).\n\nWe have shown that CRMPs associate directly with MTs in vitro ( A) and that the in vivo mitotic spindle association and activity of CRMP on nocodazole-treated interphase MTs correlate well with each other. The nocodazole assay has the key advantage over in vitro binding in that the transfected CRMP proteins can undergo post-translational modifications that occur in mammalian cells. Although the in vivo function of CRMPs is likely to extend beyond MT binding, this MT stabilization in vivo provides a semiquantitative measure of their functional MT association. Similarly, CRMP2 overexpression in primary neurons can generate multiple axons, and this has been used as a functional read-out (21).\n\nGSK3β Phosphorylation of CRMP Negatively Regulates Microtubule Binding\n\nThe C-terminal CMBD is highly conserved among the CRMP isoforms (see A) and across species (47). Phosphorylation of Ser-522 (present in CRMP1, CRMP2, and CRMP4), which is a target of CDK5 and other proline-directed kinases, primes the adjacent sites for GSK3β phosphorylation (4, 48). Subsequent GSK3β phosphorylation of CRMP2 at Ser-518, Thr-514, and Thr-509 (all within the CRMP2 CMBD) is necessary for Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse (4). We therefore determined whether the MT-stabilizing activity of CRMP in COS7 cells was affected by GSK3 inhibition. Inhibition of GSK3 by LiCl treatment (43) had a dramatic effect on MT stability in this assay, as has been reported for in vivo activities of Tau (49–51). As LiCl enhanced the region of stable MTs emanating from the MT-organizing center for almost all cells ( A) in comparison with control NaCl treatment, we modified the analysis to count as positive only those cells with extensive arrays of stable MTs (arrays emanating from MT-organizing center to the cell edge). Neither GST nor the dihydropyrimidinase-like domain of CRMP1 (residues 1–490) exhibited activity significantly above background in the presence of LiCl ( B). Full-length CRMP1 or CRMP2 were moderately enhanced by LiCl treatment. In contrast, the GST-CMBD (compare residues 480–572) showed much greater enhancement (>5-fold) of activity in the presence of LiCl ( B) to a level equivalent to the full-length protein. This suggests that GSK3β phosphorylation of the GST-CMBD fusion in vivo is more efficient. Intramolecular interactions between the dihydropyrimidinase-like N-domain and the CMBD might inhibit its phosphorylation. These experiments with the GST-CMBD fusions also suggest that the difference in activities between CRMP1 and CRMP2 (with respect to their efficiency of MT stabilization) relate directly to sequences in the CMBD.\n\nThe effect of LiCl treatment illustrates the importance of GSK3β in antagonizing MT stability in general and points to CRMP as one of several MT-associated proteins that are direct negative targets of GSK3β. To date, these include MAP1b, Tau, ACF7, and CLASP2 (49, 50, 52, 53). It has been suggested that the polarized migration of cells in general requires local GSK3β inhibition at the leading edge (52, 54, 55). Our model ( B) illustrates how different classes of MT-associated proteins are coordinately regulated by GSK3β. Further evidence for this is that the priming kinases CDK5 and dual-tyrosine-regulated kinase (DYRK) are involved in regulating CRMPs (56), Tau, CLASP2, and MAP1b. Interestingly, phospho-CRMP2 is normal in the cortex of GSK3α−/− mice, but not detectable in those lacking GSK3β (57)."
