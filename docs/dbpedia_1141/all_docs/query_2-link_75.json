        "text": "Preprints with The Lancet is part of SSRN´s First Look, a place where journals identify content of interest prior to publication. Authors have opted in at submission to The Lancet family of journals to post their preprints on Preprints with The Lancet. The usual SSRN checks and a Lancet-specific check for appropriateness and transparency have been applied. Preprints available here are not Lancet publications or necessarily under review with a Lancet journal. These preprints are early stage research papers that have not been peer-reviewed. The findings should not be used for clinical or public health decision making and should not be presented to a lay audience without highlighting that they are preliminary and have not been peer-reviewed. For more information on this collaboration, see the comments published in The Lancet about the trial period, and our decision to make this a permanent offering, or visit The Lancet´s FAQ page, and for any feedback please contact preprints@lancet.com.\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal human malignancies worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying have not been fully understood. The roles of Collapsin Response Mediator Protein 1 (CRMP1), which is an intracellular mediator of the semaphorin signal pathway in pancreatic cancer is largely unknown.\n\nMethods: Bioinformatics analysis, immunohistochemistry, real-time qRT-PCR were used to study the expression of CRMP1. Xenograft model, cell growth, migration, and invasion assays were performed to evaluate the function of CRMP1 on cancer cells. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to explore the relationship between CRMP1 expression and the prognosis of human pancreatic cancers. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation assays were applied to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism.\n\nFindings: A reduction of CRMP1 expression was identified in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and a low CRMP1 was correlated with a poorer prognosis. CRMP1 was observed to exert suppressive roles on tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, our mechanism study showed that CRMP1 inhibited the activation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway through stabilizing AXIN1 protein, which could interact with CRMP1 directly. Clinically, the expression of CRMP1 was correlated with AXIN1 expression and the activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling. CRMP1, active-β-catenin (A-β-catenin), and AXIN1 expression patterns combine to predict overall survival in pancreatic cancer patients.\n\nInterpretation: Our findings clarified an inhibitory function of CRMP1 on pancreatic cancer via suppressing the activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling in an AXIN1 dependent manner, which may provide promising therapeutic targets for PDAC treatment.\n\nFunding Information: This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81802352, 81772555, and 81902428), the National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China (No. 81625016), the Shanghai Sailing Program (No. 17YF1402500), the Scientific Innovation Project of Shanghai Education Committee (2019-01-07-00-07-E00057) and the Clinical and Scientific Innovation Project of Shanghai Hospital Development Center (SHDC12018109).\n\nDeclaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests.\n\nEthics Approval Statement: Informed consent of the patient was obtained and all performances were under the approval of the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of FUSCC."
