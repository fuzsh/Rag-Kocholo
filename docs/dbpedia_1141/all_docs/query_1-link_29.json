        "text": "Axonal pathfinding and outgrowth are tightly regulated during central nervous system development, and allow neuronal tracts to be properly established. Axonal growth and guidance involve many signaling pathways triggered by various guidance cues such as semaphorins, netrins, and ephrins (Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011; Raper and Mason, 2010). These signals are transduced by transmembrane receptors to regulate intracellular effectors which then affect cytoskeleton dynamics, leading to axonal outgrowth modulation. Dysregulation of these signaling cascades results in neuronal connectivity defects, and sometimes cognitive or psychiatric disorders. In this study, we focused on the signaling pathway mediated by semaphorin-3E (Sema3E) and its role in the development of the post-commissural fornix. The post-commissure of the fornix is the major output of the hippocampus and is mainly composed of subicular axons that primarily terminate in the mammillary bodies (Witter, 2006). The post-commissural fornix belongs to a set of limbic connections, including the Papez circuit, involved in memory, emotion, personality, and navigation (Bubb et al., 2017). Disruption of the fornix is associated with several psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (Koshiyama et al., 2020; Nowrangi and Rosenberg, 2015).\n\nThe attractive effect of Sema3E on subicular neurons is crucial for fornix development and is enabled by a tripartite receptor complex composed of plexin-D1 (PlxD1), neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) (Bellon et al., 2010; Chauvet et al., 2007). Some receptors involved in semaphorin signaling pathways, such as Nrp1, have been shown to localize to detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains (including lipid rafts) (Guirland et al., 2004). Cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched DRM domains are involved in axonal growth and guidance, acting as platforms for ligand-induced receptor activation and recruitment of intracellular actors (Simons and Sampaio, 2011). For example, kinases downstream of semaphorin signaling, such as Akt or glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), can be recruited to DRM domains where they are activated (Gao and Zhang, 2009; Sui et al., 2006). One of the major substrates of GSKβ is the collapsin response mediator protein family (CRMPs) (Charrier et al., 2003; Hou, 2020). The five CRMPs members have been implicated in numerous neuronal processes including neurite outgrowth (Ji et al., 2014; Khazaei et al., 2015), dendritic arborization (Niisato et al., 2012; Niisato et al., 2013), axonal regeneration (Alabed et al., 2007; Alabed et al., 2010; Leung et al., 2002), and axonal transport (Kimura et al., 2005; Tsuboi et al., 2005). Within this family, CRMP2 was the first to be implicated in Sema3A-dependent growth cone collapse in higher vertebrates (Goshima et al., 1995) and continues to be the most extensively studied. Sema3A stimulates CRMP2 phosphorylation through GSK3β activation which regulates the interaction between CRMP2 and the cytoskeleton (Fukata et al., 2002; Khazaei et al., 2014). Although repulsive Sema3A signaling has been well described in recent years, the molecules involved in Sema3E signaling and therefore in the growth of subicular neurons remain to be fully characterized. Recently, we showed that microtubule-associated protein 6 (MAP6) was crucial for fornix development due to its role in regulating axonal elongation induced by Sema3E (Deloulme et al., 2015). Here, we found that although MAP6 interacts with CRMP1, -2, and -4, only CRMP4 is required for Sema3E axonal outgrowth. In mice, knockout (KO) of Crmp4 is associated with defective development of the post-commissural fornix. The results presented here show that CRMP4 binds the tripartite Sema3E-receptor complex in a DRM domain-dependent manner. Disruption of DRM domains blocks Sema3E-mediated axonal growth and affects CRMP4 phosphorylation by GSK3β. The integrity of DRM domains is thus critical for downstream activation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway by Sema3E. Furthermore, we found that Sema3E signaling triggers a reduction of GSK3β-driven phosphorylation of CRMP4, and that the interaction of CRMP4 with the cytoskeleton is necessary to transduce Sema3E signaling.\n\nTaken together, our results establish CRMP4 as a new specific downstream effector of the Sema3E signaling pathway, exerting its activity through DRM domains and phospho-regulated interactions with the cytoskeleton.\n\nIn this study, we characterized CRMP4 as a new specific effector of Sema3E-mediated axonal growth. This pathway is necessary for the development of the fornix, an essential brain structure. We have previously proposed that MAP6 acts as a scaffold protein within subicular neurons, facilitating the interaction of Sema3E pathway receptors and downstream SH3-containing actors (Deloulme et al., 2015). Building on this knowledge, we identified CRMPs as additional effector candidates, thanks to their interactions with MAP6.\n\nHere, we showed that CRMP4 knockdown suppresses axonal growth in subicular neurons in response to Sema3E stimulation. Axons from these cells mostly constitute the post-commissural part of the fornix. In addition, CRMP4-KO mice had defects in fornix development that were identical to those reported in Sema3E-KO mice (Chauvet et al., 2007). Finally, analysis of the fornix in Crmp4/Sema3E double heterozygote animals compared to single heterozygote animals revealed that Crmp4 and Sema3E cooperate to allow the correct establishment of the fornix.\n\nTaken together, these findings identified CRMP4 as a new effector of Sema3E-dependent axonal outgrowth implicated in fornix development. The involvement of CRMP4 in neurite outgrowth mechanisms has also been reported in the Sema3A pathway in another hippocampal neuron subtype. Thus, Sema3A stimulates the development of dendrites in a CRMP4-dependent manner (Niisato et al., 2012). In addition, Crmp4 and Sema3d genetically interact to promote axonal growth from some peripheral neuron populations in zebrafish (Tanaka et al., 2011). These observations suggest a general role for CRMP4 in the attractive function of semaphorins. This property appears to be shared by other CRMPs, as both CRMP4 and CRMP1 are required to orient cerebral pyramidal neuron dendrites, and to position Purkinje cells in the developing mouse brain (Takaya et al., 2017; Yamazaki et al., 2020). Similarly, CRMP2 can rescue the inhibitory effects of CRMP4 knockdown on axonal development in cultured hippocampal neurons (Tan et al., 2015). Thus, CRMP1, CRMP2, and CRMP4 share some cellular functions and may have redundant roles that could be related to their extensive sequence homology, which ranges from 74% to 76% (Charrier et al., 2003).\n\nHowever, our results show that downregulation of CRMP1 or CRMP2 does not affect the growth-promoting activity of Sema3E. These results suggest that CRMP4 plays a specific role in this signaling pathway. Interestingly, we found that knockdown of CRMP4 using siRNA stimulated basal axonal growth in cultured subicular neurons. This observation suggests that CRMP4 alone can repress axonal outgrowth in these particular neurons. Conversely, other authors report that CRMP4 promotes growth of axons as well as dendrites from neurons in the hippocampus or olfactory bulb (Cha et al., 2016; Cole et al., 2004; Khazaei et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2015; Tsutiya et al., 2016). Our research thus contributes to a growing body of work proposing that CRMP4 function is regulated by the molecular context of the neurons where it is expressed (Alabed et al., 2007; Duplan et al., 2010; Girouard et al., 2020; Niisato et al., 2012). Alternatively, it has been suggested that the antagonistic roles of CRMP4 observed in distinct neuronal populations could be due to differences in its phosphorylation state (Tanaka et al., 2012).\n\nCRMP4-KO mice display dendritic arborization defects in hippocampal CA1 and cortical pyramidal neurons, mispositioning of Purkinje cells, and olfactory bulb lamination defects (Takaya et al., 2017; Tsutiya et al., 2016; Yamazaki et al., 2020). Here, we additionally show that a KO of CRMP4 is associated with a defect in post-commissural fornix development, leading to a reduction of this tract associated with fasciculation defects persisting into adulthood. This tract is crucial for cognitive functions, and in line with this role, recent investigations of white matter microstructure by diffusion tensor imaging across psychiatric disorders have highlighted alterations of the fornix in patients suffering from both schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Koshiyama et al., 2020). Moreover, a de novo variant of Crmp4 was recently identified in an adult males with ASD, and CRMP4-KO mice show a decrease in social interaction as well as a severe alterations to their sensory responses (Tsutiya et al., 2017). It is therefore possible that the fornix alterations we observed in CRMP4-KO mice here may contribute to these behavioral defects.\n\nThrough this study, we demonstrated that CRMP4 interacted with the Sema3E tripartite receptor complex, specifically interacting with Nrp1 and PlxD1. Complex formation between CRMP1, CRMP2, and CRMP4, and PlxA1 – a Sema3A co-receptor – has been known for several years (Deo et al., 2004; Schmidt et al., 2008). More recently, a study showed that the direct interaction of CRMP2 with PlxA3 was involved in dendritic growth under the control of Sema3A (Jiang et al., 2020). Binding of CRMP2 to the Ngr1 receptor and PlxA2 induced by Nogo-A was also demonstrated to limit axonal regrowth after injury (Sekine et al., 2019). In our study, we demonstrated that CRMP4 and Sema3E receptor interaction occurs only in DRM domains, despite the fact that these domains contain only small amounts of these proteins.\n\nIn this context, DRM is used as a broad term for a family of membrane domains resistant to high detergent concentrations, which includes lipid rafts. Thus, according to the methods used (sucrose gradients after solubilization in 1% Triton X-100 and following MβCD treatment), we opted to use the broad term DRM. Here, we show that MβCD, by destabilizing DRM, inhibits the stimulation of Sema3E-dependent axonal growth and blocks downstream activation of the Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway. Our results are consistent with studies highlighting the involvement of DRM/rafts in the Sema3A signaling pathway. For example, in leukemic T cells, Sema3A/Fas-dependent apoptosis requires Nrp1 and plexin-A1 to co-localize within lipid rafts (Moretti et al., 2008). Lipid rafts are also involved in Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse in neurons following the recruitment of Nrp1 to the rafts (Guirland et al., 2004). The presence of CRMP4 in membrane domains has been implicated in the maintenance of growth cones, suggesting that this localization places CRMP4 in an environment containing specific signaling proteins and cytoskeletal elements (Rosslenbroich et al., 2003). Furthermore, cerebral ischemia induced by occlusion led to CRMP4 and Nrp1 recruitment to lipid rafts, which hints that these molecules play a role in mediating signal transduction in response to neuronal damage triggered by ischemia-reperfusion (Whitehead et al., 2010). Other effectors of the Sema3E signaling pathway, such as Akt, are involved in a myriad of cellular processes and have also been localized within DRM. Indeed, for particular cellular processes like axonal growth, Akt must localize to regions enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol (Gao and Zhang, 2008). Our results support the idea that DRM/lipid rafts regulate the spatiotemporal recruitment of Sema3E-specific receptors in order to recruit ubiquitous effectors such as Akt or GSK3β to specific membrane compartments (Averaimo et al., 2016; Lingwood and Simons, 2010). Sema3E axonal growth-promoting activity relies on the PI3K/Akt pathway, as it leads to downstream phosphorylation-induced inactivation of GSK3β (Bellon et al., 2010). In line with this hypothesis, we also observed that Sema3E increased phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK3β, to produce an inactive form of the latter, and thus decreased CRMP4 phosphorylation on Thr509, one of the three GSK3β phosphorylation sites (Cole et al., 2004). Conversely, Sema3A’s repulsive activity was associated with sequential phosphorylation of CRMP2 by Cdk5 and then by GSK3β, blocking interaction between CRMP2 and microtubules in DRG-derived neurons (Uchida et al., 2005).\n\nTherefore, GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation of CRMPs can be considered to be a mechanism regulating CRMP activity in response to the attractive or repulsive effects of the guidance molecules. However, results from our rescue experiments in CRMP4-KO neurons tend to suggest that the phosphorylation state of CRMP4 has little direct impact on axonal growth in response to Sema3E. Indeed, CRMP4-4A and CRMP4-4D constructs both restored the response to Sema3E in CRMP4-KO neurons. One explanation for this result could be that CRMP4 phosphorylation alters its localization rather than its cytoskeleton modulatory function. This phosphorylation-dependent localization could have been bypassed following electroporation of CRMP4 plasmids, resulting in ubiquitous overexpression of CRMP4 mutants. This hypothesis has previously been proposed for the response to Sema3D (Tanaka et al., 2012). In contrast, the construct deleted for the region comprising the cytoskeleton domain (CRMP4ΔCyt) did not allow recovery of axonal-growth stimulation by Sema3E, reflecting the importance of the regulatory role played by CRMP4 on the cytoskeleton.\n\nIn summary, we propose that CRMP4 is the terminal downstream effector of Sema3E in axonal-growth induction, modulating cytoskeletal dynamics to mediate axonal growth. The results presented here thus identify CRMP4 as a major new player in the growth-promoting activity of Sema3E, a signaling pathway that is much less well characterized than the repulsive role played by Sema3E in axon guidance."
