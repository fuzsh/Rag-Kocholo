        "text": "CalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable. We are the only journalism outlet dedicated to covering America’s biggest state, 39 million Californians and the world’s fifth largest economy.\n\nTo improve California’s democracy by making its government more transparent and accountable and giving Californians the information they need to understand and engage with that government.\n\nStaff: We believe that a more diverse news team helps us to better accomplish our mission and serve people across the state. We are actively working to build a team of people who represent the community across race and ethnicity, ideology, socioeconomic status and gender. We are also actively committed to building an inclusive workplace where various viewpoints are included and welcomed in order to improve our work. We also work on maintaining equity across our staff.\n\nLeadership: We are firmly committed to diversity among our board of directors and internal leadership. Organizational leadership positions matter, as these people have greater influence over the work that we do and how we do it.\n\nContent: Our journalists are committed to diversifying our sources along with carefully considering the words, phrases and labels we use in our writing.\n\nAudiences: We can only truly serve the people of California by focusing on reaching many communities across racial and ethnic backgrounds, language preferences, socioeconomic status, and other factors.\n\nAccessibility: We are committed to making our organization accessible to people with a variety of mental and physical capabilities internally and externally. We maintain an office in Sacramento that is physically accessible. We understand that hiring people across the accessibility spectrum can help improve the work that we do. And we understand that improving the ways in which people use our content includes careful consideration of people with different physical abilities.\n\nCalMatters was founded in 2015 to fill the gap left by a shrinking press corps: to empower people to engage on key issues, hold the powerful accountable and create a better California.\n\nWe are now the trusted source for information and analysis on complex statewide policies and politics.\n\nOur office is in Sacramento, but our team is spread out across the state. Our diverse team includes more than 50 experienced journalists along with product and revenue professionals.\n\nWe reach 1 in 10 people across the state by distributing our work, at no cost, to more than 250 media partners. We have readers and listeners in every major metropolitan area and throughout the state’s nearly 500 cities.\n\nOur team has been recognized and honored with top state, regional and national awards from the National Press Club, the Online News Association, the Society of Environmental Journalists, the Public Media Journalists Association, the Institute for Nonprofit News, the Edward R. Murrow Award, the Society of Professional Journalists, Best of the West and California News Publishers.\n\nWe’re supported by a diverse and growing group of members, major donors, media, community and family foundations, and institutional supporters.\n\nOur work has inspired changes across the spectrum of issues we cover including environment, education, public health, public safety, governance, natural disaster response, campaign finance, housing, jobs and more."
