        "text": "We're all familiar with the saying “it's better to give than receive”. What might surprise you is that this is actually backed up by research.\n\nThose of us who are kind and compassionate experience clear benefits to our well-being and happiness. We may even live longer. Kindness also helps reduce stress and improve our emotional well-being.1,2\n\nWe all have so much going on in our lives - competing strains and stresses – not to mention the recent coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns. This has sometimes pushed kindness to one side, in favour of what is urgent now.\n\nIt can be easy to show kindness when posting online, but when it comes to reality it's harder to commit to kindness in our real-life words and actions.\n\nBy taking the time to be kind to others, we can benefit from emotional upsides. It really does make a difference, especially for people who are vulnerable or struggling.\n\nWith everything that's going on in the world, now is the time to help make a kinder society that improves our mental health.\n\nKindness should be built into business decisions, government policy, and other official systems in a way that supports everyone’s mental health and also reduces discrimination and inequality. That can start with individual commitments to showing kindness in our words and our actions.\n\nThis guide is written to demonstrate the positive effect that helping others can have on your own mental health, including some suggestions that will inspire you.\n\nTake a few minutes, have a read, and think about doing something kind for a friend or a stranger today.\n\nMark Rowland, CEO of the Mental Health Foundation\n\nWhat do we mean by kindness?\n\nKindness is choosing to do something that helps others or yourself, motivated by genuine warm feelings.\n\nKindness, or doing good, often means putting other people’s needs before our own. It could be by giving up our seat on a bus to someone who might need it more, or offering to make a cup of tea for someone at work.\n\nEvidence shows that helping others can also benefit our own mental health and wellbeing. For example, it can reduce stress as well as improve mood, self-esteem and happiness.1–3\n\nThere are so many ways to help others as part of our everyday lives. Good deeds needn’t take much time or cost any money.\n\nSmall changes can make a big difference.\n\nThis guide gives you tips on how to bring kindness into your life.\n\nWe will look in more detail at:\n\nVolunteering\n\nDoing something for a good cause\n\nActs of kindness\n\nWhat are the health benefits of kindness?\n\nHelping others feels good\n\nStudies have found that acts of kindness are linked to increased feelings of well-being.1 Helping others can also improve our support networks and encourage us to be more active.4 This, in turn, can improve our self-esteem.5 There is some evidence to suggest that when we help others, it can promote changes in the brain that are linked with happiness.2\n\nIt creates a sense of belonging and reduces isolation\n\nHelping others is thought to be one of the ways that people create, maintain, and strengthen their social connections.\n\nFor example, volunteering and helping others can help us feel a sense of belonging, make new friends, and connect with our communities.5,6\n\nFace-to-face activities such as volunteering at a food bank can also help reduce loneliness and isolation.6\n\nIt helps to keep things in perspective\n\nMany people don’t realise the impact a different perspective can have on their outlook on life.\n\nThere is some evidence that being aware of our own acts of kindness, as well as the things we are grateful for, can increase feelings of happiness, optimism and satisfaction.7,8\n\nDoing good may help you to have a more positive outlook about your own circumstances.\n\nIt helps to make the world a happier place – one act of kindness can often lead to more!\n\nActs of kindness can make the world a happier place for everyone. They can boost feelings of confidence, being in control, happiness and optimism.8\n\nThey may also encourage others to repeat the good deeds they’ve experienced themselves – contributing to a more positive community.9\n\nThe more you do for others, the more you do for yourself\n\nThe benefits of helping others can last long after the act itself, for those who offer kindness, and those who benefit. This, in turn, can improve our self-esteem.5\n\nTips to remember before you start\n\nDo something you enjoy\n\nAt times like this we are learning to adapt to the requirements needed to prevent the spread of coronavirus. As a result we have had to rethink the way we do our hobbies, and pursue our interests.\n\nYou might have treated a friend to a trip to the cinema or for dinner, but today, you can watch something on a streaming service and keep in touch by phone or gift them a takeaway instead. You could even gift a subscription to an entertainment service, magazine or drop off (safely) a simple care package.\n\nYou can share your skills, such as offering to help with technology, sharing recipes, or sewing masks or scrubs for key workers. These are all great ways to bring your skills and interests to others.\n\nKeep others in mind\n\nAlthough acts of kindness for other people can make us feel good, we need to also keep in mind why we’re doing it – which is for their benefit, not ours.\n\nPart of being kind is considering the feelings of others, so it is very important that your kindness is something which others will find helpful. Kindness is something that needs to benefit both parties.\n\nSee what you can do that others are not doing already. For example, if you want to donate to a foodbank, see what they need before buying things. If you want to support key workers, check that there is a need where you are. It may be that others in your community need help more urgently.\n\nDon’t overdo it\n\nIt’s important to make sure we don’t overdo it!\n\nIf we find we are giving too much of ourselves or have gone beyond our means, it’s probably time to take a step back. It’s very easy to give away all of our energy, especially if we are finding things hard ourselves and want to focus on others. Leave enough for you – kindness has to start with yourself.\n\nWe recommend starting small, so we do not become overwhelmed or give more than we are financially able.\n\nHelping others doesn’t have to cost money or take a lot of time. It could start with calling a friend we haven’t spoken to in a while or donating a small amount of money monthly to a charity close to our heart and within our budget.10\n\nGet involved with volunteering\n\nVolunteering is a great way to help others and research shows that it benefits people of all ages, by increasing feelings of self-esteem, social connection, and well-being.5\n\nIf you have friends or neighbours who are finding things difficult at the moment, see what you can do to help.\n\nIf you have time, especially if you are furloughed from work, you could volunteer in your community if it’s safe for you to do so.\n\nHere are some ideas about getting involved:\n\nVolunteer for a local community organisation\n\nOffer your expertise and support as a mentor for those who are struggling\n\nCheck-in safely with a neighbour\n\nSee if there’s anything you can do to support your children’s school or nursery – offer to read stories for example\n\nInvolve your friends and neighbours in community projects\n\nOffer to skill-share with a friend - you could teach guitar, dance or a new recipe\n\nCall a friend that you haven’t spoken to for a while\n\nTell a family member how much you love and appreciate them\n\nOffer a listening ear to someone who simply wants to talk\n\nTo find out more about volunteering opportunities, check out our suggested organisations at the end of this guide.\n\nDo something for a good cause\n\nGetting involved with a cause that is close to your heart can be hugely beneficial for both the cause and your own sense of well-being.4,10\n\nFor example, if you want to help protect the environment, you could get involved in a local tree-planting scheme. You could start by identifying a few local organisations to contact about how they can use volunteers.\n\nThere are lots of other ways you can get involved:\n\nFollow your chosen charity on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram and join in the conversation\n\nSign-up to receive your charity’s newsletter and keep up to date with the work they’re doing\n\nPlan a fundraising event in your local community or at work – you could try our Tea & Talk event, or a challenge event\n\nRaise money by taking part in a fun active challenge, such as a 5k run or walk in fancy dress, or maybe a themed sports day\n\nWhatever you decide to do, make sure you have fun with it! We have lots of ways to get involved with the Mental Health Foundation.\n\nYou can [email protected] \" rel=\"nofollow\"> [email protected] or call 020 7803 1121. You can also follow us on Facebook and Instagram @mentalhealthfoundation and Twitter @mentalhealth.\n\nActs of kindness\n\nActs of kindness have the potential to make the world a happier place.1,7,8\n\nWe want to see a world where kindness is built into business decisions, government policy and official systems. However, we can start by individual commitment to showing kindness in our words and our actions.\n\nYou might want to do something for someone else or take note if you experience an act of kindness.\n\nNot sure where to start? We’ve put together some suggestions to help you out...\n\nAt home and in your community\n\nCall a friend who you haven’t spoken to for a while\n\nPost a card or letter to someone you've been out of touch with\n\nSend flowers to a friend, out of the blue\n\nFind out if a neighbour needs any help with shopping\n\nRing someone who is on their own\n\nSend someone a handwritten thank you note\n\nTell your family how much you love and appreciate them\n\nHelp with household chores\n\nOffer to help an elderly or vulnerable neighbour\n\nCheck on someone you know who is going through a tough time\n\nAt work\n\nRemember to say \"hi\" to colleagues and ask how they are – whether that’s face-to-face, or virtually if you are working from home\n\nOffer to support colleagues who may not be familiar with videoconferencing or new software that you have already used\n\nSet up a coffee or lunch club – with your regular colleagues and with new ones\n\nHave a conversation with a colleague you don’t normally talk with\n\nGet to know a new member of staff – it is hard to join a new workplace\n\nLend your ear – listen to your colleague who is having a bad day\n\nSay thank you to a colleague who has helped you\n\nPraise a colleague for something they have done well\n\nIn public places\n\nWish a passer-by a good morning or afternoon\n\nBe a considerate cyclist/driver\n\nPick up some rubbish lying around in the street\n\nSmile and say hello to people you may pass every day, but have never spoken to before\n\nOn social media\n\nTake time to contact people you haven’t seen for a while\n\nWrite something nice or encouraging on a post you appreciate\n\nAcknowledge and validate someone’s story – if they are having a difficult time you don’t have to have all the answers, sometimes a like or a brief ‘I’m sorry to hear this, is there something I can do?’ is enough to make them feel heard\n\nThink about what you share – look at the source of the post, and the tone. If it isn’t kind, think twice. If something could upset others and you feel you need to post it, use a trigger or content warning\n\nThink about your comments and replies. Try not to say nasty things, or pile on where somebody questions another person’s actions\n\nEvidence shows that being kind really does improve your wellbeing1\n\nWhile we know that we don't do things for others for what we can get out of it, we also know that the more we do for others, the more they are likely to do for us.11\n\nWith this in mind, try to help others once a day for a week and see if it makes a difference in how we feel.\n\nYou can take joy in being deliberately kind – whether by recognising the time you have for your kids or partner, speaking more to family or volunteering in your community.\n\nTry to keep track of:\n\nany volunteering that you’ve done\n\nsupport you’ve given to friends and family\n\nany random acts of kindness that you’ve carried out\n\nwhat others have done for you.\n\nRemember to make a note of how they made you feel. You could even keep a diary! Write down three things you are grateful for each day, or simply say these to yourself as the day draws to a close.\n\nIt’s important to be kind to yourself as well\n\nWhatever you can manage today is good enough. Some people feel that the lockdown is giving them the time and chance to learn new skills or try new things. That may be you, and if so, enjoy and celebrate that.\n\nIf this isn’t you, don't beat yourself up about it. If things are hard for you right now, try and find some small things to celebrate each day. Getting up and washing your hair can be just as much of an achievement as someone else posting about a 5k run on Instagram.\n\nTry to tune out the voice of judgement and comparison and tune in to the voice that says you are enough.\n\nBe kind to yourself\n\nPrioritise some 'me' time, so you can relax and think about how you’re feeling and how your day or week has been so far\n\nTune out of your social media channels for a day, or even a week\n\nTreat yourself to something. It doesn't have to be a big thing. Remember, good things come in small packages\n\nDo something you enjoy, like listening to a favourite song or dancing in your kitchen\n\nSpend some time with nature. It's great for our mental health\n\nFurther information\n\nMental Health Foundation - Our vision is of good mental health for all.
