        "text": "Our reporting is based on sources. They can be officials, witnesses, records — essentially anyone or anything that can offer information on a particular topic. When we don’t disclose a human source by name, that person is considered an anonymous source. Under our guidelines, these sources should be used only for information that we believe is newsworthy and credible, and that we are not able to report any other way.\n\nBut why does The Times shield the identity of some sources? We recognize that the use of anonymous sources is sometimes crucial to our journalistic mission. It can give readers genuine insight into the uses and abuses of power — in Washington, on Wall Street and beyond. In sensitive areas like national security reporting, it can be unavoidable. Sources sometimes risk their careers, their freedom and even their lives by talking to us.\n\nWhat we consider before using anonymous sources:\n\nHow do they know the information?\n\nWhat’s their motivation for telling us?\n\nHave they proved reliable in the past?\n\nCan we corroborate the information they provide?\n\nBecause using anonymous sources puts great strain on our most valuable asset: our readers’ trust, the reporter and at least one editor is required to know the identity of the source. A senior newsroom editor must also approve the use of the information the source provides.\n\nTraveling with police officers, firefighters and search-and-rescue teams can also be essential in helping readers understand the urgency and severity of a storm. Their insight can help reporters piece together the damage the storm caused, and understand what it will take for a hard-hit community to come back from it.\n\nOur reporters and editors reach out to emergency service agencies and forecasters as a disaster is unfolding, checking in hourly at times to let readers know where the most damage is occurring, and if they need to evacuate. But being at the scene, interviewing the people experiencing the brunt of the disaster, is how we can bring readers stories of survival, resilience and tragedy.\n\n“It’s difficult to convey the panic and the immediacy of what people are feeling unless you get into the details,” said Shawn Hubler, a National desk reporter who has covered California floods, wildfires and earthquakes for 40 years. “They’ll say it was terrifying. And by terrifying, you don’t know what they mean until you drill down a little bit and you find out there were embers the size of baseballs slamming into their car as they tried to wind their way down some two-lane highway.”\n\nThe on-the-ground reporting can also lead to some of the most important stories The Times can tell, seeking to hold decision makers accountable when warnings aren’t issued or heeded, when poor choices put people or communities in harm’s way, or when long-term planning or infrastructure has been insufficient or neglected, making the outcomes of extreme weather even worse.\n\nFor our journalists back at the office, the pace during an ongoing weather story can be frenetic. Editors on the National and Express desks field reports from several locations while also monitoring the course of a storm, the problems it is causing — including evacuations, power outages and flight cancellations — and how those affected can seek help.\n\nFor events such as blizzards, typhoons, hurricanes and severe weather that could produce tornadoes, our weather data and graphics teams step in early with forecasts and graphics that show the likely path and intensity of the storms.\n\nOur Weather Data team is led by John Keefe and anchored by the meteorologist Judson Jones. For this team it is data, data, data. “Because we are looking at it all the time, it’s easier for us to explain when there are weird quirks,” Keefe said. This allows the team to alert editors to a coming weather system.\n\nThe team uses data primarily from the National Weather Service, augmented by other branches of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And Jones keeps in close touch with scientists at these agencies, and with academics who research weather. His expertise allows him to speak their language and interpret their jargon for readers. “My job is to translate that into terms that matter,” he said, “and sometimes that’s filtering out what doesn’t matter.”\n\nOur Graphics desk, led by Archie Tse, takes this information and turns it into maps that track a storm’s path; animated time loops that give readers the scale of the storm; and graphics that show rainfall, wind speed and storm surge. The goal is to create weather trackers that focus on the aspects that threaten to cause the most damage. Tse said that a combination of news judgment and design expertise goes into every graphic. “Our maps and visualizations are tailored for our readers to give them the information they need in a clear and concise way,” he said.\n\nBecause the science establishing a direct link between extreme weather events and the rapid warming of the planet is increasingly clear, our Climate desk, which includes more than a dozen journalists, joins in our coverage to provide data, visual explanations and insights.\n\nHere are some of the sources we use for extreme weather events.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center, the Weather Prediction Center, the National Hurricane Center and other divisions within the National Weather Service.\n\nThe European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (E.C.M.W.F.).\n\nThe National Weather Service for the number of people under storm watches, warnings and advisories across the United States.\n\nPowerOutage, a website that collects and aggregates data on the number of utility customers without power in the United States and other parts of the world.\n\nFlightAware, which displays the cancellations and delays of commercial airline flights around the world.\n\nThese are all available to the public, but we sometimes subscribe for access to more data.\n\nWe also provide guidance for those in the paths of storms, offering ways they can prepare for and survive hurricanes, flash floods and tornadoes.\n\nWeather is news. We cover it with the understanding that it has an impact on readers’ lives. And while extreme events may begin as breaking news, they often become stories of survival, tragedy, science and accountability.\n\nTo create a consistent count of mass shootings in the United States, we have updated our definition of “mass shooting,” to include any shooting where four or more people are killed with a firearm — not including the assailant — in a public place and the shooting is not connected to another crime or circumstance, like a robbery, a drug deal or domestic violence. This definition, which was created by the Congressional Research Service, is based on the F.B.I.’s definition of mass murder. This definition is also used by the most comprehensive database on the subject: the Violence Project.\n\nOur count of mass shootings is based on data from both the Gun Violence Archive and the Violence Project. We use data from both sources in order to make sure our database is as up-to-date and comprehensive as possible.\n\nHow we report on the crime\n\nWhile we often rely on the reports given by law enforcement officials in control of a crime scene during a mass shooting, we let readers know what we can’t confirm, what we can and where and how we got the information.\n\nWe use the name of the suspect sparingly, and take special care to avoid it in headlines or social media posts.\n\nWe avoid descriptions that are cinematic, or lack attribution and sourcing.\n\nWe consult with our photo and standards editors before publishing graphic images or photographs of the suspect.\n\nWe focus on the victims’ and survivors’ experience of the shooting, while also reporting on the crime and the attacker.\n\nWe verify any information from a witness or victim found on social media and reach out to the person who posted it before we publish it.\n\nWe publish the suspect’s name when it is confirmed by authorities. But we do not want to give the person excessive prominence. There is evidence that media coverage can be a factor motivating future mass shootings.\n\nWe generally avoid publishing images in which the suspect is seen brandishing weapons. We will explain any ideology that might have influenced the gunman’s actions, but we do not typically publish or link to manifestoes that contain rationales for the attack.\n\nOur reporters try to find out as much as they can about the suspect and approach anyone who might have crossed paths with the person. We supplement interviews with a thorough examination of public records. We want to give readers a sense of the human tragedy, so calling the loved ones of those who died in such circumstances is necessary."
