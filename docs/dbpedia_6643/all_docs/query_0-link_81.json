        "text": "After calling Time magazine’s long interview with Donald Trump “shocking” and “reprehensible” earlier today, Joe Biden this evening doubled down on his predecessor’s dystopian second term plans.\n\n“Trump did a long interview with TIME magazine,” the president told an Asian American Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander fundraiser at Washington DC’s Mayflower Hotel on Wednesday. “It’s coming out, you gotta read it. It’s a mandatory read.”\n\n“This election is about competing values and competing visions for America,” Biden added to a crowd that had Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai among the attendees. “Trump’s values and visions are ones of anger, hate, revenge, retribution.”\n\nIn case his audience didn’t take his advice, the incumbent then cited a couple of the topics in the wide ranging “How Far Would Trump Go?’ piece like letting the states control abortion rights, monitoring pregnant women, and whole scale pardoning of January 6th insurrectionists, according to White House Pool reports.\n\nIn that sense, Trump’s talk with Time’s Eric Cortellessa, a rare sit-down with a non-conservative outlet, was both a coup for the former Celebrity Apprentice host and the once venerable magazine. Often garnering negative reactions, both Trump and Time got more attention than certainly the once omnipotent mag has received in years out of the interview.\n\nEver since the interview, which contains a full transcript and fact checking section, dropped on April 30, pundits and talking heads up and down the cable channels have been raging even more than usual than ever about the threat to democracy Trump embodies and the horrors he’s said out loud.\n\nWhile more focused than in 2016 and 2020 campaigns or during his White House years, Trump’s vows of mass deportations, civil service gutting, political retribution and a more accommodating relationship with Vladimir Putin are pretty standard stuff for Trump. Still for many who haven’t been paying a lot of attention to the rematch with Biden this year so far, they could be blindsiding. Even then, the ease by which he told Cortellessa in two conversations last month how he would abandon Europe and NATO if he feels they are not paying their fair share and activate the military in the streets of America are truly chilling — as Public Enemy’s Chuck D said today:\n\nTouching on his ongoing court cases, Ukraine, Covid-19 origins, violence if he loses again to Bien and unrest in the Middle East, Trump’s most breathtaking line may be at the very end of the lengthy article. “I think a lot of people like it,” Trump tells Time and Cortellesa of his American dictatorship talk.\n\nOut on the stump today in battleground states Wisconsin and Michigan while his Stormy Daniels hush money trial went dark Wednesday, the much-indicted Trump declared to his rallies that “people are absolutely thrilled” by conservative SCOTUS justices killing Roe v Wade and Red States imposing strict limits on abortion access\n\nOf course, staying in their pugilistic mode of late, the Biden/Harris campaign responded earlier this week to Trump’s Time Q&A with a hastily produced video and social media swipes.\n\nRegardless of how many swing votes the interview gets or repells, you can be sure this won’t be the last you heard of Trump’s revelations."
