        "text": "Description. The Jewish Advocate was first printed in Boston, 1909, by Jacob deHass, executive secretary to the founder of modern political Zionism. With the intention to serve and unite the booming Jewish community throughout New England, The Jewish Advocate was formed to instruct on matters of the Jewish faith and to champion the establishment of a Jewish state. Briefly, the newspaper was also published as The Jewish Home Journal and The Boston Advocate. The pages of The Jewish Advocate gave voice to the publication’s staunch support for the appointment of Louis Brandeis as the first Jewish Supreme Court Justice in the U.S, and nearly thirty years later for the foundation of Brandeis University in Waltham, MA. In the years leading up to the World War II, the newspaper was also a rare voice in the media to warn of Hitler’s rise to power in Europe, and the threat it posed for Jewish people. Following the war, organizations formed to rebuild the lives of Jewish refugees found support and a forum for discussion and debate in the weekly publication. The Jewish Advocate continues to be a primary source of regional, national and international news and information for subscribers in New England and across the U.S., as well around the world. This digital newspaper archive (1905-1990) provides an in-depth historical perspective on issues and events pertaining to the rise of Zionism and the development of Jewish-American culture. Description. The Jewish Exponent first hit the presses in 1887, founded by a group of 43 prominent Philadelphia businessmen. This stock ownership was meant to ensure the newspaper represented the entire community while serving in its coverage of local, national and international news. Charles Hoffman, a native Philadelphian lawyer and rabbi, as well as an ardent Zionist, served as the publication’s first editor and publisher. He penned a weekly column, “Men and Things” as a platform to explore issues of conservative Judaism. From the early days of the worldwide Zionist movement, The Jewish Exponent staunchly supported the establishment of a Jewish homeland and carried news of developments in Israel. Other topics the publication championed and brought to the attention of readers in the early and mid-20th century included Jewish immigration and the expanding influence in American public life. Over the decades The Jewish Exponent has not only been a primary source of news and information, but also a forum for stimulating discussion and debate. The publication has received annual awards from the American Jewish Press Association for excellence in Jewish Journalism."
