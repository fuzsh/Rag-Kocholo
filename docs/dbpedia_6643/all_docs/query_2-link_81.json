        "text": "Timed to its 100th anniversary on March 3, TIME launches its year-long centennial celebrations with an editorial project on the impact of TIME covers since 1923 and looks ahead to its next century\n\nNEW YORK, Feb. 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, TIME begins the year-long celebration of its centennial with the release of A Century of Impact, a new multi-platform editorial project that both commemorates the enduring power of TIME's iconic red border and looks toward the next century by exploring the voices, ideas, and innovations that will drive global progress for the future.\n\nSince its first issue on March 3, 1923, TIME has told the stories of the people who shape, challenge, and inspire the world. Today, TIME reaches the largest audience in its history—more than 100 million people around the world across its platforms—and its iconic magazine, with more than 1 million subscribers, remains the largest U.S. print title in news.\n\n\"We are proud and energized to enter our centennial year with the largest and most engaged audience in our history and a powerful brand built on TIME's legacy of 100 years of trust and impactful storytelling,\" said TIME Chief Executive Officer Jessica Sibley. \"Now, as we celebrate this milestone, we are focused on cementing TIME's position for the future by continuing to accelerate our digital transformation, while reaching new customers and audiences and driving relevancy.\"\n\nSibley and TIME Editor-in-Chief and Executive Chairman Edward Felsenthal write in a special letter to readers: \"This issue is, for all of us at TIME, an extra­ordinarily special one. Publishing 100 years since our brand came to life as a 32-page weekly, it is a marker of ­constancy and change. Constancy in our unwavering commitment to trusted journalism that tells the world's story through the people who shape it. Change in so many ways, but most importantly in the stories themselves and the ways we tell them.\"\n\nThey continue: \"TIME's co-founder Henry Luce saw business as an exercise in foresight, and the company he launched was from the start an innovator. Out of TIME's pages sprang numerous new businesses and brands, from Fortune and Sports Illustrated to, decades later, People and HBO.... As we begin our second century, that spirit of innovation and disruption inspires us every day. At this moment of massive transformation in our industry and the world we cover, we are more committed than ever before to ensuring that our company and our journalism thrive in the decades to come.\" https://bit.ly/3xX3WIf\n\nTIME's A Century of Impact project features reflections on 100 years of making history through the eyes of the people who lived it, including interviews with prominent TIME cover subjects, as well as original essays and new reporting on the remarkable history of TIME's most memorable covers.
