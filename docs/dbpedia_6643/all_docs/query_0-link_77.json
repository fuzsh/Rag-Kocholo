These databases have varying year coverage, so pay close attention to the information under the links to find the year you need. If you are off-campus you will be asked to log-in using your NetID and password.\n\nIf you are searching for older articles via the links on this page and are prompted to pay for an article use the Contact Us options in the box on the left for assistance.\n\nUse the Journal Article Locator to find issues of a specific magazine to which the University Library has digital access.\n\nTo access magazines using the Journal Article locator, follow the steps below.\n\nGo to the Library homepage.\n\nScroll down and click the Journal & Article Locator.\n\nOnce you're on the Journal Article Locator page, type the name of a magazine into the \"Journal Name\" search box.\n\nThen, click the \"Look for Journal Title or Article\" button at the bottom of the form.\n\nNote: You can search for a magazine using the full title (for example, \"The Economist\") or omit the initial word and just search for \"Economist.\"\n\nAfter you search for a magazine title, you will see a Discover page with your search results. Under the \"Journal Title Matches\" section, click \"Start of Title Matches.\"\n\nAfter you click \"Start of Title Matches,\" you will see different publication titles.\n\nUnder the second result, \"The Economist,\" you will notice that there are links to different databases. These databases have varying year coverage, so pay close attention to the information under the links to find the year or issue you need.\n\nNote: Sometimes the magazine you need is not the first search result. In our example, \"The Economist\" is the second result. You can always verify that it is the magazine you want by looking for the magazine ISSN.\n\nNavigate into the database and locate the issue you need!\n\nDo you have more questions? Ask a Librarian!"
