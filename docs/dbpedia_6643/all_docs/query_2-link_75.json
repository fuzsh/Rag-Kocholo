        "text": "An important part of gathering and evaluating sources for research projects is knowing the difference between popular, scholarly, and trade publications. â€‹\n\nPopular magazine articles are typically written by journalists to entertain or inform a general audience,\n\nScholarly articles are written by researchers or experts in a particular field. They use specialized vocabulary, have extensive citations, and are often peer-reviewed.\n\nTrade publications may be written by experts in a certain industry, but they are not considered scholarly, as they share general news, trends, and opinions, rather than advanced research, and are not peer-reviewed.\n\nThe physical appearance of print sources can help you identify the type of source as well. Popular magazines and trade publications are usually glossy with many photos. Scholarly journals are usually smaller and thicker with plain covers and images, In electronic sources you can check for bibliographies and author credentials or affiliations as potential indicators of scholarly sources.\n\nPopular Magazines Scholarly (including peer-reviewed) Trade Publications Content\n\nCurrent events; general interest articles\n\nResearch results/reports; reviews of research (review articles); book reviews\n\nArticles about a certain business or industry Purpose To inform, entertain, or elicit an emotional response To share research or scholarship with the academic community To inform about business or industry news, trends, or products Author Staff writers, journalists, freelancers Scholars/researchers Staff writers, business/industry professionals Audience General public Scholars, researchers, students Business/industry professionals Review Staff editor Editorial board made up of other scholars and researchers. Some articles are peer-reviewed Staff editor Citations May not have citations, or may be informal (ex. according to... or links) Bibliographies, references, endnotes, footnotes Few, may or may not have any Frequency Weekly/monthly Quarterly or semi-annually Weekly/monthly Ads* Numerous ads for a variety of products Minimal, usually only for scholarly products like books Ads are for products geared toward specific industry Examples on Publisher Site Time; Vogue; Rolling Stone; New Yorker Journal of Southern History; Developmental Psychology; American Literature; New England Journal of Medicine Pharmacy Times; Oil and Gas Investor Magazine Examples in Library Databases Time; Rolling Stone; New Yorker Journal of Southern History; Developmental Psychology; American Literature; New England Journal of Medicine Pharmacy Times; Oil and Gas Investor Magazine\n\n*Ads will not be visible when viewing articles through a library database\n\nPeer review is a process scholarly articles go through before they are published. Scholarly articles are sent to other experts in the field (peers) to ensure that they contain high-quality, original research important to the field. This is a measure of quality control other types of literature don't go through."
