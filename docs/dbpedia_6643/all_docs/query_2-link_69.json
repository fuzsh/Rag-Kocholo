        "text": "The New York Times Times Magazine on Tuesday won three National Magazine Awards, for articles in the categories of Public Interest, Essays and Criticism, and Reporting. The Times won more awards than any other magazine, with the New Yorker and The Atlantic each winning two. Jamie Lauren Keiles, a contributing writer for the Magazine, also won an ASME Next Award for standout journalists under 30.\n\nThe Public Interest Award went to Azmat Khan, a contributing writer for the Magazine, for “The Civilian Casualty Files,” her two-part December project that made public Pentagon records revealing the patterns of failure that resulted in thousands of civilian deaths in the air wars in the Middle East, and documented the human toll. (Last month, this reporting from Azmat was also part of The Times’s Polk Award in Military Reporting.) It was the second National Magazine Award for Azmat, who won the award for Reporting in 2018, with co-writer Anand Gopal, for their Times Magazine story about a family killed by an airstrike in East Mosul. It was that story that led Azmat to undertake the four-year reporting project that led to “The Civilian Casualty Files.”\n\nIn the category of Essays and Criticism, Carina del Valle Schoerske, a contributing writer, won the award for “Bodies on the Line,” her September cover story about going dancing in New York City last summer after the first wave of Covid lockdowns lifted. The essay became a profound meditation on loneliness during the pandemic and the way that social dance can be used to process and overcome trauma.\n\nMatthieu Aikins won the award for Reporting for his epic December cover story “Inside the Fall of Kabul,” a nearly 20,000-word account of the collapse of the Afghan government as the Taliban closed in. Matt was one of the few American journalists to remain continuously in Kabul last summer and fall, and his reporting was vital not only to the magazine but to our daily news coverage, to which he contributed frequently.\n\nEveryone at the Magazine was deeply honored to work with these journalists and help them bring their visions for these stories to life. Each one of them exemplifies the essence of great magazine journalism in their own way, and I’m so proud of their accomplishments.\n\nI’m also immensely proud of the many people on the Magazine’s staff who contributed in myriad ways to each of these three stories. Last year was a tough year to do the kind of collaborative, creative work that goes into any magazine story. Without the innumerable quiet acts of editorial brilliance and dedication of the staff of the Magazine, most of them performed alone, from home, these awards would not have been possible. I also want to recognize the tremendous work from beyond the Magazine that went into Azmat’s project, which included important contributions from Graphics, Visual Investigations and Washington, and editing from Matt Purdy and Paul Fishleder.\n\nThe Magazine was also a finalist in General Excellence, which the Atlantic won, and in Feature Writing, for both “I Feel Like I’m Just Drowning,” a powerful story about teenage mental health during Covid by Susan Dominus, and “Searching for Gayl Jones,” a profile of the reclusive author by Imani Perry. The winner in that category was our former colleague Jennifer Senior, for her remarkable story in The Atlantic about a family’s loss on 9/11.\n\nThank you to everyone who worked so hard on these stories. What a great honor for The Times. Here’s the list of winners and finalists."
