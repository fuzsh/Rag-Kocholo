        "text": "This paper explores the possibility of reasoning about law, using a particular category: the reflexivity. By one side, with this expression I refer to a mirror and to its feature: the inversion. By an other side, I mean the possibility to act rationally, that is to reflect (reasoning) in order to find the rule for moving in the world of a mirror. A particular example of reflexivity comes by Carrollâ€™s novel, Crossing the mirror, whose main character was Alice. In the world of the mirror, characterized of the rule of inversion, Alice needs to look for a rational rule.\n\nI want to discuss the issue of violence in relative to philosophical dialogue not only as a text or genre of writing, but as current practice developed in different contexts of public life in Italy and other European countries. The reflection on the meaning of violence, the relationship between r ationality and language, the relationship between language and philosophy, will be developed in light of this thematization. So puts in evidence few words-values (violence, reason, philosophy, dialogue) what can form an essential es tructure."
