To address this issue, scientists have developed organic semiconductor nanoparticles (OSNs) by incorporating organic semiconductors into a stable framework or self-assembled structure. OSNs have shown excellent performance and can be used as high-resolution biosensors in modern medical and biological research. They have been used for a wide range of applications, such as detecting small biological molecules, nucleic acids, and enzyme levels, as well as vascular imaging, tumor localization, and more. In particular, OSNs can simulate fine particulate matters (PM2.5, indicating particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 μm) and can be used to study the biodistribution, clearance pathways, and health effects of such particles. However, there are still some problems that need to be solved, such as toxicity, metabolic mechanism, and fluorescence intensity. In this review, based on the structure and design strategies of OSNs, we introduce various types of OSNs-based biosensors with functional groups used as biosensors and discuss their applications in both in vitro and in vivo tracking. Finally, we also discuss the design strategies and potential future trends of OSNs-based biosensors. This review provides a theoretical scaffold for the design of high-performance OSNs-based biosensors and highlights important trends and future directions for their development and application.

Through the fat extraction, REDOX reactions and halogen exchange, as well as the optimized experimental conditions, a colorimetric sensing method was established to determine the peroxide number of milk powder samples. The integrated process of milk powder fat extraction and the REDOX process greatly shortened the determination time. This colorimetric method has a good linear correlation in the range of the peroxide number from 0.02 to 1.96 mmol/kg, and the detection limit was found to be 3 μmol/kg. This study further deepens the application prospect of wavelength-shift-based colorimetric sensing using CsPbBr3 NCs.

In order to achieve such detection with high accuracy, up to now, various types of biosensors have been developed. Among those biosensors, enzymatic biosensors have shown excellent sensing performances via their highly specific enzymatic reactions with small chemical molecules. As techniques used to implement the sensing function of such enzymatic biosensors, electrochemical and fluorescence techniques have been mostly used for the detection of small molecules because of their advantages. In addition, through the incorporation of nanotechnologies, the detection property of each technique-based enzymatic nanobiosensors can be improved to measure harmful or important small molecules accurately. This review provides interdisciplinary information related to developing enzymatic nanobiosensors for small molecule detection, such as widely used enzymes, target small molecules, and electrochemical/fluorescence techniques. We expect that this review will provide a broad perspective and well-organized roadmap to develop novel electrochemical and fluorescent enzymatic nanobiosensors.

The AuNPs were produced through an eco-friendly method utilising plant extract, eliminating the need for severe chemicals, and remove the requirements of sophisticated fabrication methods and tedious procedures. In addition, rGO-AuNP serves as a dispersant for the CNT to improve the dispersion stability of CNTs. The composite material, rGO-AuNPs/CNT, underwent characterisation through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy (UV–vis), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The electrochemical performance of the modified SPE for estradiol oxidation was characterised using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques. The rGO-AuNPs/CNT/SPE exhibited a notable improvement compared to bare/SPE and GO-CNT/SPE, as evidenced by the relative peak currents. Additionally, we employed a baseline correction algorithm to accurately adjust the sensor response while eliminating extraneous background components that are typically present in voltammetric experiments. The optimised estradiol sensor offers linear sensitivity from 0.05–1.00 µM, with a detection limit of 3 nM based on three times the standard deviation (3δ). Notably, this sensing approach yields stable, repeatable, and reproducible outcomes. Assessment of drinking water samples indicated an average recovery rate of 97.5% for samples enriched with E2 at concentrations as low as 0.5 µM%, accompanied by only a modest coefficient of variation (%CV) value of 2.7%.

Currently, traditional virus screening methods such as plate culturing and real-time PCR are considered the gold standard with accurate and sensitive results. However, these methods still require sophisticated equipment, trained personnel, and a long analysis time. Alternatively, with the integration of microfluidic and biosensor technologies, microfluidic-based biosensors offer the ability to perform sample preparation and simultaneous detection of many analyses in one platform. High sensitivity, accuracy, portability, low cost, high throughput, and real-time detection can be achieved using a single platform. This review presents recent advances in microfluidic-based biosensors from many works to demonstrate the advantages of merging the two technologies for sensing viruses. Different platforms for virus detection are classified into two main sections: immunoassays and molecular assays. Moreover, available commercial sensing tests are analyzed.

Although various COR sensors have been reported in recent years, previous ones can only exhibit single-signal output (turn ON or turn OFF) with poor reliability and anti-interference ability. Therefore, exploring novel platform with dual-signal response for COR detection is urgently needed. Herein, we reported the first ratiometric fluorescent platform for highly sensitive and selective COR detection by integrating G-quadruplex (G4) and Pyrene (Py) as signal probes and harnessing A-COR-A interaction. In the absence of COR, the platform shows a low fluorescence signal of PPIX (F642) and a high one of Py monomer (F383). With the addition of COR, two delicately designed poly-A ssDNAs will hybridize with each other via A-COR-A coordination to form complete G4, yielding the increased fluorescence signal of PPIX and the decreased one of Py due to the formation of Py excimer. Based on the above mechanism, we constructed a simple and efficient sensor that could realize the ratiometric fluorescent detection of COR with high sensitivity and selectivity. A linear relationship between F642/F383 and COR’s concentration is obtained in the range from 1 nM to 8 μM. And the limit of detection of COR could reach to as low as 0.63 nM without any amplification, which is much lower than that of most COR sensors reported so far. Notably, the logical analysis of COR can be carried out under the control of a “YES-NOT” contrary logic pair, enabling the smart dual-channel response with an adequate S/N ratio and improved reliability and anti-interference ability. Moreover, this system also presents satisfactory performance in fetal bovine serum (FBS) samples.

The indiscriminate usage of pesticides poses a massive threat to food, environmental, and human health safety. Hence, the fabrication of a sensitive and reliable sensor for the detection of pesticide residues in agro products and environmental samples is a critical subject to be considered. Recently, the graphene family including graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been frequently employed in the construction of sensors owing to their biocompatibility, high surface-area-to-volume ratio, and excellent physiochemical, optical, and electrical properties. The integration of biorecognition molecules with GO/rGO nanomaterials offers a promising detection strategy with outstanding repeatability, signal intensity, and low background noise. This review focuses on the latest developments (2018 to 2022) in the different types of GO/rGO-based biosensors, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and electrochemical-based techniques, among other, for pesticide analysis. The critical discussions on the advantages, limitations, and sensing mechanisms of emerging GO/rGO-based biosensors are also highlighted. Additionally, we explore the existing hurdles in GO/rGO-based biosensors, such as handling difficult biological samples, reducing the total cost, and so on. This review also outlines the research gaps and viewpoints for future innovations in GO/rGO-based biosensors for pesticide determination mainly in areas with insufficient resources.

Herein, a facile pyrolysis strategy is reported for the synthesis of the iron–nitrogen–carbon (Fe-N-C) SAzyme using ferrocene trapped within porous zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8@Fc) as a precursor. The as-prepared Fe-N-C SAzyme exhibited exceptional oxidase-mimicking activity, catalytically oxidizing 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) with high affinity (Km) and fast reaction rate (Vmax). Taking advantage of this property, we designed two colorimetric sensing assays based on different interaction modes between small molecules and Fe active sites. Firstly, utilizing the reduction activity of ascorbic acid (AA) toward oxidized TMB (TMBox), a colorimetric bioassay for AA detection was established, which exhibited a good linear range of detection from 0.1 to 2 μM and a detection limit as low as 0.1 μM. Additionally, based on the inhibition of nanozyme activity by the thiols of glutathione (GSH), a colorimetric biosensor for GSH detection was constructed, showing a linear response over a concentration range of 1–10 μM, with a detection limit of 1.3 μM. This work provides a promising strategy for rationally designing oxidase-like SAzymes and broadening their application in biosensing.

First, a conductive ink was formulated by homogenously dispersing carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (cMWCNTs) in a stable emulsion of terpineol and an aqueous suspension of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). The ink, labeled C5, was coated onto paper substrates to fabricate C5@paper conductive electrodes. Thereafter, a magnetic bead (MB)-assisted supersandwich DNA hybridization assay was optimized against the porA pseudogene of N. gonorrhoeae. For this purpose, a pair of specific 5′ aminated capture probes (SCP) and supersandwich detector probes (SDP) was designed, which allowed the enrichment of target gonorrheal DNA sequence from a milieu of substances. The SD probe was designed such that instead of 1:1 binding, it allowed the binding of more than one T strand, leading to a ‘ladder-like’ DNA supersandwich structure. The MB-assisted supersandwich assay was integrated into the C5@paper electrodes for electrochemical analysis. The C5@paper electrodes were found to be highly conductive by a four-probe conductivity method (maximum conductivity of 10.1 S·cm−1). Further, the biosensing assay displayed a wide linear range of 100 aM-100 nM (109 orders of magnitude) with an excellent sensitivity of 22.6 kΩ·(log[concentration])−1. The clinical applicability of the biosensing assay was assessed by detecting genomic DNA extracted from N. gonorrhoeae in the presence of DNA from different non-gonorrheal bacterial species. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a highly sensitive, cost-effective, and label-free paper-based device for STI diagnostics. The ink formulation prepared for the study was found to be highly thixotropic, which indicates that the paper electrodes can be screen-printed in a reproducible and scalable manner.

The hydrogel film, which contains glycine and N-acetylcysteine, reacts with OPA to produce a reductive isoindole derivative. The derivative is then oxidized for OPA determination using cyclic voltammetry. The proposed sensor achieves an optimal detection time of 20–30 s and requires only a small analyte volume of 5 µL. It exhibits good precision (10%) and sensitivity (3.3 μA/cm2 mM) in a phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7.6), with excellent linearity (R2 > 0.97) and precision (<3%) in the detection range (0.2–0.6%) required for clinical OPA solutions. Moreover, the sensor demonstrates good concentration verification of Cidex-OPA disinfection in healthcare institutes, with high sensitivity (18.28 μA/cm2 mM) and precision around the minimum effective concentration (0.3%). Overall, the proposed sensor offers a promising and practical solution for accurate and reliable OPA detection in clinical disinfection practices.

For the correct interpretation of diffractograms of phthalocyanine films, structures of CoPcCl4 and FePcCl4 single crystals were determined for the first time. Films were tested as active layers for the determination of low concentrations of NO (10–1000 ppb). It was found that the best sensor response to NO was observed for the films of chlorinated derivatives MPcCl4 (M = Co, Fe), while the lowest response was in the case of MPc(tBu)4 films. FePcCl4 films exhibited the maximal response to NO, with a calculated limit of detection (LOD) of 3 ppb; the response and recovery times determined at 30 ppb of NO were 30 s and 80 s, respectively. The LOD of a CoPcCl4 film was 7 ppb. However, iron phthalocyanine films had low stability and their sensitivity to NO decreased rapidly over time, while the response of cobalt phthalocyanine films remained stable for at least several months. In order to explain the obtained regularities, quantum chemical calculations of the binding parameters between NO and phthalocyanine molecules were carried out. It was shown that the binding of NO to the side atoms of phthalocyanines occurred through van der Waals forces, and the values of the binding energies were in direct correlation with the values of the sensor response to NO.

In order to solve the problem of complicated and expensive operation procedures for clinical diagnosis of sleep apnea, here we propose a small and low-cost wearable apnea diagnostic system. The system uses a photoplethysmography (PPG) optical sensor to collect human pulse wave signals and blood oxygen saturation synchronously. Then multiscale entropy and random forest algorithms are used to process the PPG signal for analysis and diagnosis of sleep apnea. The SAS determination is based on the comprehensive diagnosis of the PPG signal and blood oxygen saturation signal, and the blood oxygen is used to exclude the error induced by non-pathological factors. The performance of the system is compared with the Compumedics Grael PSG (Polysomnography) sleep monitoring system. This simple diagnostic system provides a feasible technical solution for portable and low-cost screening and diagnosis of SAS patients with a high accuracy of over 85%.

This can be addressed by using air-diffusion-type bilirubin oxidase (BOD) cathodes, and thus the further development of the hierarchical structure of porous electrodes with highly effective specific surface areas is critical. In this study, a porous layer of gold is deposited over magnesium-oxide-templated carbon (MgOC) to form BOD-based biocathodes for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Porous gold structures are constructed via electrochemical deposition of gold via dynamic hydrogen bubble templating (DHBT). Hydrogen bubbles used as a template and controlled by the Coulomb number yield a porous gold structure during the electrochemical deposition process. The current density of the ORR catalyzed by BOD without a redox mediator on the gold-modified MgOC electrode was 1.3 times higher than that of the ORR on the MgOC electrode. Furthermore, the gold-deposited electrodes were modified with aromatic thiols containing negatively charged functional groups to improve the orientation of BOD on the electrode surface to facilitate efficient electron transfer at the heterogeneous surface, thereby achieving an ORR current of 12 mA cm−2 at pH 5 and 25 °C. These results suggest that DHBT is an efficient method for the fabrication of nanostructured electrodes that promote direct electron transfer with oxidoreductase enzymes.

Early diagnosis of BC oncomarkers is considered the most effective strategy for detecting and treating BC. Finding the type and stage of BC in women as soon as possible is one of the greatest ways to stop its incidence and negative effects on medical treatment. The development of biosensors for early, sensitive, and selective detection of oncomarkers has recently attracted much attention. An electrochemical nano biosensor (EN) is a very suitable option for a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis. This comprehensive review provides information about the prevalence and pathobiology of BC, recent advances in clinically available BC oncomarkers, and the most common electrochemical nano biosensors for point-of-care (POC) detection of various BC oncomarkers using nanomaterial-based signal amplification techniques.

The pattern of DBS (e.g., the electrode pairs used and the intensity of stimulation) is usually optimized by trial and error based on a subjective evaluation of motor function. We tested the hypotheses that DBS releases glutamate in selected basal ganglia nuclei and that the creation of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced nigrostriatal lesions alters glutamate release during DBS in those basal ganglia nuclei. We studied the relationship between a pseudo-random binary sequence of DBS and glutamate levels in the STN itself or in the globus pallidus (GP) in anesthetized, control, and 6-OHDA-treated rats. We characterized the stimulus–response relationships between DBS and glutamate levels using a transfer function estimated using System Identification. Stimulation of the STN elevated glutamate levels in the GP and in the STN. Although the 6-OHDA treatment did not affect glutamate dynamics in the STN during DBS in the STN, the transfer function between DBS in the STN and glutamate levels in the GP was significantly altered by the presence or absence of 6-OHDA-induced lesions. Thus, glutamate responses in the GP in the 6-OHDA-treated animals (but not in the STN) depended on dopaminergic inputs. For this reason, measuring glutamate levels in the GP may provide a useful feedback target in a closed-loop DBS device in patients with PD since the dynamics of glutamate release in the GP during DBS seem to reflect the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc.

As MOFs have the advantages of high porosity, large specific surface area, controllable pore size, etc., they are widely used in gas storage, catalysis, adsorption, separation and other fields. SERS substrate based on MOFs can not only improve the sensitivity of SERS analysis but also solve the problem of easy aggregation of substrate nanoparticles. By combining MOFs with SERS, SERS performance is further improved, and tremendous research progress has been made in recent years. In this review, three methods of preparing MOF-based SERS substrates are introduced, and the latest applications of MOF-based SERS substrates in biosensors, the environment, gases and medical treatments are discussed.

In this context, the study of the effectiveness of different methods for sensory training on panel performances represents a new trend in research activity. With this purpose, wearable sensors are applied to study physiological signals (ECG and skin conductance) concerned with the emotions in a cohort of volunteers undergoing a short, two-day (16 h) sensory training period related to wine tasting. The results were compared with a previous study based on a conventional three-month (65 h) period of sensory training. According to what was previously reported for long panel training, it was seen that even short, intensive sensory training modulated the ANS activity toward a less sympathetically mediated response as soon as odorous compounds become familiar. A large-scale application of shorter formative courses in this domain appears possible without reducing the effectiveness of the training, thus leading to money saving for academia and scientific societies, and challenging dropout rates that might affect longer courses.

A conjugate of the analyte with a fluorophore based on a fluorescein derivative (tracer) was synthesized, and its interaction with specific anti-OA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was tested. A MAbs–tracer pair demonstrated highly affine immune binding (KD = 0.8 nM). Under optimal conditions, the limit of OA detection in the FPIA was 0.08 ng/mL (0.1 nM), and the working range of detectable concentrations was 0.4–72.5 ng/mL (0.5–90 nM). The developed FPIA was approbated for the determination of OA in real matrices: river water and seawater samples. No matrix effect of water was observed; therefore, no sample preparation was required before analysis. Due to this factor, the entire analytical procedure took less than 10 min. Using a compact portable fluorescence polarization analyzer enables the on-site testing of water samples. The developed analysis is very fast, easy to operate, and sensitive and can be extended to the determination of other aquatic toxins or low-molecular-weight water or food contaminants.

In this study, a multifunctional platform featuring dual-mode detection channels (colorimetric-fluorescence) combined with polymer chain reaction (PCR) was proposed for the sensitive and rapid detection of Salmonella. Additionally, the colorimetric measurements were achieved by color changes induced by methylene blue (MB) insertion into the double-stranded DNA, and the fluorescence measurements were performed by internal filter effect (IFE)-induced fluorescence quenching of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) by MB. The results showed that the IFE and PCR amplification processes improved the sensitivity of the sensor towards Salmonella detection, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 21.8 CFU/mL. Moreover, this colorimetric-fluorescence dual-mode PCR biosensor was applied to determine Salmonella in food samples, such as chicken, egg, and fish, which produced satisfactory results. Overall, the present study results demonstrate the potential for combining PCR amplification with IFE to develop an efficient and reliable dual-mode analysis platform to safeguard food security.

These include disease diagnostics and prognostics, environmental monitoring, public health, and food safety. Aptamer recognition (DNA or RNA) has gained extensive attention for biomolecular detection due to its high selectivity, affinity, reproducibility, and robustness. Concurrently, biosensing with nanoparticles has been widely used for its high carrier capacity, stability and feasibility of incorporating optical and catalytic activity, and enhanced diffusivity. Biosensors based on aptamers and nanoparticles utilize the combination of their advantages and have become a promising technology for detecting of a wide variety of biomolecules with high sensitivity, reliability, specificity, and detection speed. Via various sensing mechanisms, target biomolecules have been quantified in terms of optical (e.g., colorimetric and fluorometric), magnetic, and electrical signals.

Among the new detection proposals, the use of peptides mimetics has surged as an alternative to avoid the use of antibodies, of which there has been a shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the use of peptides in detection systems still presents some questions to be answered, mainly referring to their stability under different environmental conditions. In this work, we synthesized an ACE2 peptide mimic and evaluated its stability in different pH, salinity, polarity, and temperature conditions. Further, the same conditions were assessed when using the ability of the peptide mimic to detect the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a biotin-streptavidin-enzyme-linked assay. Finally, we also tested the capacity of the peptide to detect SARS-CoV-2 from patients’ samples. The results indicate that the peptide is structurally sensitive to the medium conditions, with relevance to the pH, where basic pH favored its performance when used as a SARS-CoV-2 detector. Further, the proposed peptide mimic was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 comparably to RT-qPCR results. Therefore, the present study promotes knowledge advancement, particularly in terms of stability considerations, in the application of peptide mimics as a replacement for antibodies in detection systems.

This sensor enables the detection, sizing, and quantification of biological nanoparticles (bioNPs), such as extracellular vesicles (EVs), viruses, and virus-like particles. The selectivity of bioNP detection does not require biological particle labeling, and it is achieved via the functionalization of the gold sensor surface by target-bioNP-specific antibodies. In the current work, we demonstrate the ability of SPR microscopy sensors to detect, simultaneously, silica NPs that differ by four times in size. Employed silica particles are close in their refractive index to bioNPs. The literature reports the ability of SPR microscopy sensors to detect the binding of lymphocytes (around 10 μm objects) to the sensor surface. Taken together, our findings and the results reported in the literature indicate the power of SPR microscopy sensors to detect bioNPs that differ by at least two orders in size. Modifications of the optical sensor scheme, such as mounting a concave lens, help to achieve homogeneous illumination of a gold sensor chip surface. In the current work, we also characterize the improved magnification factor of the modified SPR instrument. We evaluate the effectiveness of the modified and the primary version of the SPR microscopy sensors in detecting EVs isolated via different approaches. In addition, we demonstrate the possibility of employing translation and rotation stepper motors for precise adjustments of the positions of sensor optical elements—prism and objective—in the primary version of the SPR microscopy sensor instrument, and we present an algorithm to establish effective sensor–actuator coupling.

Herein, achiral Au/p-aminothiophenol (PATP) substrates were prepared to link the enantiomers via coupling reactions for constructing the enantioselective discrimination system. The resultant Au/PATP/enantiomer systems displayed charge-transfer (CT)-induced surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra that offered distinguishable information for the systems with different chirality. The differentiated spectral signal can be amplified by regulating the applied electrode potential, leading to great enantioselective discrimination performance. Moreover, the relationship between the discrimination performance and the potential-regulated CT process was revealed by SERS, which enabled an accurate and effective enantiomeric determination for various chiral molecules, including aromatic and aliphatic small molecules. The aliphatic molecule with the shorter chain was discriminated with a higher resolution, since the longer-chain molecule in the discrimination system may cause a change in the molecular electronic structure of the PATP. In addition, the aromatic chiral molecule can be distinguished easier than the aliphatic molecules, which means that the generation of the conjugation of electrons in the aromatic molecule-involved enantiomeric systems facilitates CT-induced SERS discrimination. Our work provides guidance for the design and development of an effective enantioselective discrimination strategy with high discrimination performance in diverse application fields.

Real-time stress monitoring via wearable sensor systems can aid in the prevention of stress-related diseases by allowing stressors to be controlled immediately. Physical tests, such as heart rate or skin conductance, have recently been used to assess stress; however, these methods are easily influenced by daily life activities. As a result, for more accurate stress monitoring, validations requiring two or more stress-related biomarkers are demanded. In this review, the combinations of various types of sensors (hereafter referred to as multiplexed sensor systems) that can be applied to monitor stress are discussed, referring to physical and chemical biomarkers. Multiplexed sensor systems are classified as multiplexed physical sensors, multiplexed physical–chemical sensors, and multiplexed chemical sensors, with the effect of measuring multiple biomarkers and the ability to measure stress being the most important. The working principles of multiplexed sensor systems are subdivided, with advantages in measuring multiple biomarkers. Furthermore, stress-related chemical biomarkers are still limited to cortisol; however, we believe that by developing multiplexed sensor systems, it will be possible to explore new stress-related chemical biomarkers by confirming their correlations to cortisol. As a result, the potential for further development of multiplexed sensor systems, such as the development of wearable electronics for mental health management, is highlighted in this review.

They have been widely used in intelligent wearable devices, electronic skins, and biological analyses and have shown broad application prospects in intelligent medical detection. Field-effect transistor (FET) sensors have high sensitivity, reasonable specificity, rapid response, and portability and provide unique signal amplification during biochemical detection. Organic field-effect transistor (OFET) sensors are lightweight, flexible, foldable, and biocompatible with wearable devices. Organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) sensors convert biological signals in body fluids into electrical signals for artificial intelligence analysis. In addition to biochemical markers in body fluids, electrophysiology indicators such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and body temperature can also cause changes in the current or voltage of transistor-based biochemical sensors. When modified with sensitive substances, sensors can detect specific analytes, improve sensitivity, broaden the detection range, and reduce the limit of detection (LoD). In this review, we introduce three kinds of transistor-based biochemical sensors: FET, OFET, and OECT. We also discuss the fabrication processes for transistor sources, drains, and gates. Furthermore, we demonstrated three sensor types for body fluid biomarkers, electrophysiology signals, and development trends. Transistor-based biochemical sensors exhibit excellent potential in multi-mode intelligent analysis and are good candidates for the next generation of intelligent point-of-care testing (iPOCT).

To achieve this objective, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), which can catalyze silver reduction and deposition, were used as the carrier of the aptamers tagged with a positively charged tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). Due to the mutual attraction of positive and negative charges, the TAMRA attracted and retained the silver lactate around the AuNPs. Thus, the chance of AuNP-catalyzed silver reduction was increased. The charge effect-assisted silver enhancement was verified by tagging different base pair length aptamers with TAMRA. Under optimized conditions, the as-prepared OTA aptasensor had a working range of 1 × 102–1 × 106 pg mL−1. The detection limit was as low as 28.18 pg mL−1. Moreover, the proposed aptasensor has been successfully applied to determine OTA in actual samples with satisfactory results.

These sensors have been historically used and have not undergone many changes in terms of the involved electrochemical processes. In this work, we propose a new approach on the immobilization and enhancement of the electrochemical properties of the sensing layers through the control and bioconjugation of hemoproteins (hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome C) on anisotropic gold nanoparticles (gold nanotriangles (AuNTs)). The hemeproteins and the AuNTs are mixed in a solution, resulting in stable bioconjugates that are deposited onto the electrode surface to obtain the biosensors. All the systems proposed herein exhibited direct well-defined redox responses, highlighting the key role of the AuNTs acting as mediators of such electron transfers. Several protein layers surrounding the AuNTs are electroactive, as demonstrated from the charge measured by cyclic voltammetry. The retention of the stability of the hemeproteins once they are part of the bioconjugates is evidenced towards the electrocatalytic reduction of hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, and nitrite. The parameters obtained for the proposed biosensors are similar or even lower than those previously reported for similar systems based on nanomaterials, and they exhibit attractive properties that make them potential candidates for the latest developments in the field of sensing devices.

They can result in pathologic lesions when deposited in human organs. Various types of amyloid protein can be routinely identified in human tissue specimens by special stains, immunolabeling, and electron microscopy, and, for certain forms of amyloidosis, mass spectrometry is required. In this study, we applied Raman spectroscopy to identify immunoglobulin light chain and amyloid A amyloidosis in human renal tissue biopsies and compared the results with a normal kidney biopsy as a control case. Raman spectra of amyloid fibrils within unstained, frozen, human kidney tissue demonstrated changes in conformation of protein secondary structures. By using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), Raman spectroscopic data were accurately classified with respect to each amyloid type and deposition site. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time Raman spectroscopy has been used for amyloid characterization of ex vivo human kidney tissue samples. Our approach, using Raman spectroscopy with machine learning algorithms, shows the potential for the identification of amyloid in pathologic lesions.
