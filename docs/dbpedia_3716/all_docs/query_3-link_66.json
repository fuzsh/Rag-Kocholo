GENESIS OF COLLEGE LIFE Dean Marsh Takes Job With Special Enthusiasm The summer of 1966 seemed to be \"turnover time\" in the faculty and administration. One of the new additions to the administrative staff is Professor Thad Marsh, the new Dean of the College. From student reactions and the filtered impressions of the faculty to his past visits, Dean Marsh is a very welcome addition to the campus. The enthusiasm and hopes of the college community seem to be reflected in the special kind of enthusiasm with which the Dean regards the position. It's a most exciting prospect,\" Dean Marsh said. The kind of challenge that exists at Centenary happens to lie in an area which is of primary interest to me — the job of taking a faculty which is already top-flight and building it into an even better one.\" Prof. Marsh was the past dean of the College of Muhlenberg, a renown liberal arts college in Al- lentown. Pa., and prior to that he was assistant to the president ar Rice University. As these positions indicate, although Prof. Marsh is an alumnus of a large university, and he has served as administrative officer at large universities, his heart has been, and still is, with the small liberal arts colleges. \"I am aware,\" said Dean Marsh, \"that there has been a great deal of faint-heartedness in recent times concerning the future of the small, independent college, but it is my impression that this has already begun to subside as the defenders of liberal arts education took up the challenge. Far from having outlived its use- fulness, liberal arts — and I emphat- ically include the sciences — are the vcrv heart of the whole educational enterprise, and are absolutely nec- essaty to education for leadership. I consider that education has a primarily moral aim — to inculcate wisdom as well as knowledge — and the small liberal arts college can do this far better than the mass- production uuniversir^'. I feel about the liberal arts col- lege as Voltaire felt about God — that if it didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent it.\" He was a Sullivan Scholar at the Universit)' of Kansas, a member of Phi Beta Kappa and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, where he studied DEAN THAD MARSH on two different occasions. During both of Prof. Marsh's sojourns at Oxford his research field was the intellectual and literar)' history of l6th and early 17th Century Eng- land, with much of his documenta- tion in the travel literature of the day — especially that dealing with travel in the New World, and its impact on Old World thought. These days he finds his thoughts occupied more and more with the philosophy of higher education, and most of his recent writing and speechmaking has been in this vein. He also speaks and writes fluently concerning contemporary theology, another special area of interest. Dean Marsh is a member of the Rhodes Scholarship selection com- mittee and as associate member of the advisory council of the Dan- forth Foundation. He is also a fel- low of the Royal Geographical Society and a member of the mod- ern language Assn. of America, the American Assn. of University Pro- fessors and the Association of American Rhodes Scholars. Total Enrollment Nearing 1500 As Centenary Begins Its 141st Year A record number of the '66 High School graduating class entered Centenary this fall along vnth a sizeable increase in the number of returning students to boost the total enrollment near the 1500 mark. Along with the mrlux oi students came a rash of headaches and hopes. President Wilkes announced September 13 that as of that date approximately 1500 students were registered for the Fall semseter. He pointed out these were nebu- lous figures and that Registration does not close until Septcrhber 24. The figures broke down as fol- lows: approximately 1,125 full- time students of which over 400 are freshmen, over 300 night school students and the balance in special students. There are several interesting and encouraging facts about the growth of the college when these and last year's figures are com- pared. Last year there were only 976 full-time students. Another comparison shows that the num- ber of students who returned to Centenary increased by 25-30^y. This year there were 625 as op- posed to 450 last year. These enrollment figures follow Dean Announces New Orientation Program Dean Forrest has recently an- nounced a new program initiated to introduce all new Centenary students to the college. All incom- ing freshmen and transfers are re- quired to attend the informative series of lectures. The programs will be held each Tuesday at 10:30 beginning September 20th and concluding November First. The first two sessions, to be held in assigned classrooms, will be devot- ed to testing the new students in rhe fields of interest and personal- ity. These national standardized tests will be conducted by Dr. Touchstone, member of the psy- chology department. The next five sessions will be held in the Brown Memorial Cha- pel featuring the top administra- tors of the college speaking on various phases of college services and activities. The first of these programs will concern itself with the history and purpose of the college in an address by President Wilkes. This program will be fol- lowed by a series of programs on rhe business policies and services of the college by Dean Forrest, Mr. Austin, business manager of the college and Dean Marsh, new Dean of the College. Another address will be given on the expectanons of the future by Mr. Delaney, head of the Centenary advance- ment program. This newly initiat- ed series of programs should pro- vide the answers to many of the ques'-ions faci.ig the new students of the college, concluded Dean Forrest. closely the plan of increase of full time students as laid out in the 10 year plan of the college. This plan calls for a full-time enrollment of 1500 by 1975. When asked about the enroll- ment figure President Wilkes pointed out that more interesting than the increase in numbers is the fact that the student body itself has changed. He said that in 1963 only 272 students lived on campus while this year over 575 will be on campus. He pointed out this change has had profound ef- fects on the college. Whereas in 1963 campus life was nil, this year interest is already growing about the activity series and other One of the headaches caused by this influx of dorm students has been lack of space. Although most of the problems have been straight- ened out in the boys' dorms many rooms in the girls' dorms still have three girls. There had been dis- cussion among the administration of plans to increase dormitory space however. Dr. Wilkes stated that the financial picture did not look very encouraging for a radical increase in the near future. One of the problems of the past has been students who make dorm reservations and then dropped them too late for a student wishing space to be accepted. In order to decrease the number of persons making room reservations and then dropping them, the room deposit will rise to SlOO.OO next fall. All students in school this spring and who will continue in the fall of '67 must pay their additional S50.00 by March 15, 1967. Perhaps the most obvious in- dication of the \"space squeeze\" to campus students is the Cafeteria. Although the Cafeteria staff is working to try to minimize the problem the fact remains that the facilities are entirely inadequate. At the present the Cafeteria is feeding twice as many as it was built for. Pres. Wilkes stated that Cafeteria plans are hinging on Dorm plans which, as stated above, are bogged down. Dormitory Space and the Cafe- teria are not the only things that are beginning to show rhe space squeeze, the classroom situation is beginning to show the strain. Af- ter discussing with Mr. Austin, the Comptroller of the College, the situation on campus he revealed that an additional seven classrooms and twelve offices were being presently constructed in the base- ment of the library. The planned completion date for\" the new home of the History Department is around Nov. 1. Another aspect of the crowded conditions was the start, at the re- quest of the Student Senate, of the parking regulation system. on campus. Although there were many complications initially, the plan seems to finally be taking effect. All of these are problems of a growing school and although there are inconveniences there is rhe con- solation that the college is attract- ing more students which in turn means that a degree from Centen- ary is in more demand. Beginning with this issue, the Conglomerate will be featuring its own classified section for the benefit of rhe Centenary stu- carry sections for announcc- dent. CAFETERIA LINE HOW AfUCH LONGER?

Wilkes President of Ceacenary College Letters Editor, Conglomerate: I am returning to Centenary af- ter an absence of one semester, ex- pecting to vent part of my energies in that never-ending movement to- ward reform. I find a great deal of change, to say the least. I find an administration which is to me essentially a question mark, and faculty and student body in which many of the old faces — ones which really counted in student government — are gone. But perhaps even more surpris- ing — or rather deflecting — I find a great deal that has not changed. And that \"great deal\" is the problem confronting such work as the Ad Hoc committee is now engaged in. These problems have been sounded out in the Co7i- glomerate for the past two years at least, and we are all tired of hear- ing about them. They certainly don't need another repetition here. Perhaps a good part of these problems will be solved with the coming President's Conference. It was last year, at least so far as communication between the actual participants in student government and the administration goes. But there is a vast majorin^ of the stu- dent body which for valid reason does not, and cannot participate. Communication between these stu- dents and their representatives in student government, and their pol- icy-makers in the administration is almost nil. This must be remedied if the coming constitutional reforms are to be understood and intelligently voted on. Two opportunities for such an improvement of commun- ications come to mind immediate- ly. Obviously there is th»- Con- glomerate, which can, and should, do more informing and less de- manding that it has done under previous editors, myself included. It cannot, of course, guarantee any improvements, but it can certainly offer the opportunity for a great many. There is also the President's Conference, which, in spite of the publicity it received last year, was actually poorly covered. Students there were much too involved in the discussions to hope to make any objective report to the student body about what was and was not accomplished. I would therefore like to suggest that some steps be taken by those planning the con- ference for the recording and print- ing of the discussions held there. A tape recording of the confer- ence, or some other method by which the student body could see nor only what was discussed, but also which of their representatives actually contributed to the con- ference, this would of course be ideal: would aid tremendouslv in improving the aualitv of student government. But at the very least some printed record of rhe con- ferenre — and others like it — should be made available to the student body. The reforms are ^oin^ to be m^idf*. and student government will continue to exist. But without an informed student body, and for rh^*- marter an informed faculty and administration, the existence of ^^'^ He rather ooint'ess. David Hoskins, Chairman,. Ad Hoc Committee EDITORIAL FOR LEASE: One Bag Of Beans In a far off land there are two stories told about a young man, a clerk, a store, and some beans. In the first story there was a young man who wanted to get rich, but he was told that in his society he had to grow beans if he wanicv* to be a success. He went to the store to buy some beans. It was a nice, flashy-looking store, something like a super market, (it aimed for vol- ume). The clerk was very friendly, and the young man didn't have to pay much for the bag of beans. He spent a little time in the store looking around, then ran home very happy. He put the bag in a glass case and put k on a shelf and then sat back and waited for success, and sat, and sat, and sat, and sat. He didn't get rich. He didn't succeed, and he blamed it on the store. The store wasn't worried, it still sold a lot of beans. The clerk didn't feel bad, he had been very nice. The boy would have been better off if he hadn't gone to the store. The second story is about another young man in the same far-olt land. He too wanted success and he too went to a store, but this store was different. It was not as gaudy nor flashy, not as many pretty cartons or cans, but ir was nice. He asked the clerk if he could buy a bag of beans. In a gruff voice the clerk said NO! \"I will LEASE you a bag of beans.\" \"Wfhat terms?\" asked the young man. \"That you work and cultivate these beans so that when you leave to go home the bag of beans I lease to the next young man will be better.\" \"OK,\" said the young man, \"but I don't know how to grow beans.' 'Til help you,\" said the clerk. So they worked side by side, and grew the beans, the clerk teaching the young man to cultivate, dig, water and fertilize the beans, the young man working, sweating, getting his hands dirty. The beans grew, and grew, and grew, and grew. It was dark before the young man left but he was proud-happy. He had a wheelbarrow of large beans he knew he would have no trouble selling, and he had left the clerk the better bag of beans to lease again. The clerk? He was tired. It had not been easy. Now, after watching the man grow the beans, he felt — well, he felt something only another clerk would understand. Centenary — Which are you? Faculty — Which are you? Students — Which are you?

College is an institution of higher learning. Education IS what it exists for; and if that isn't the reason you are entering or returning to Centenary, then save yourself the trouble of packing your clothes. College may be the door to success, but it isn't standing open Just being in the vicinity of it isn't going to do you any more good than joining the Marines.

Friday, September 23, 1966 CENTENARY CONGLOMERATE Page 3 September 19, 1966 Dear Centenary Students: A hearty welcome — to those who are new students ajid to those who are returning. I invite the returning students to help us welcome the new ones. You will find our faculty to be friendly, and eager to help you. Success in college requires hard work and diligent study. I hope that together we can enjoy Centenary as \"an academic community where excellence is encouraged and individuality is respected.\" To achieve this purpose involves us all: students, faculty, and adminis- tration. To that end we are planning another \"Conference on Student Life\" for faculty and student leaders. This give-and-take discussion is one of the ways in which we try to learn of the student's needs and interests, in order that we may help to make his college experience meaningful and worthwhile. We are interestd in you as a person. May this year be your best; with your cooperation I know it will be one of the best years in Centenary's long history. Again, welcome. I look forward to seeing you soon. Sincerely yours, Jack S. Wilkes President Letters Dear Centenary Students, Wow, at last I get the time to send a few lines. First, I want to thank you all for your assistance and help during my stay at Cen- tenary College, and for the oppor- tunity that Dr. Pledger and others provided me to study in Shreve- port. I learned a lot during my time there, both in school and outside school,and now, after I have come home, I realize even more how much it meant for me. After school was over, I traveled through the U.S. for a month and a helf and during that trip I got to see and experience many things. When I now have had time to think things over at my home and in a bit different and perhaps more quite surrounding, I have got a more clear view of the Unit- ed States, and been able to form mv opinions about your countrv better than I was ever able ot do going to spell it all out here, but when I was over there. I am not to sav it briefly: in some cases Icertainly enw the Americans, but I think that I pity them in even more aspects. There are too manv things which the average Ameri- can never realizes concerning all aspects of humanity and society. It concerns both political, civic and purely human affairs. Manv Americans do live in a very pleas- ant life. However, what they need to do is to check whether they are surrounded by stable and strong walls, or if they live in glass houses, as many do. This glass is by now getting so thin that it surprises me that they have not yet looked through it. Enough of that! I also want you to know that I personally thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the U.S. I had a very nice time and I do hope to be able to get back some day. Sincerely yours, Leif Talskog The public outcry against the Supreme Court's recent attempt to clarify obscenity is now reaching a crescendo. And no one is more outraged than Mr. Homer T. Pettibone, one of the most widely read writers of our times. (Under various noms de plume.) \"Confusing! ObfuscatingI Unworkable!\" cried Mr. Pettibone, a look of pain on his finely chiseled features. \"The chaotic opinions of these senile old men have imposed an unbearable burden on us crafts- men. \"It couldn't be as bad as all that,\" I said. \"I am seriously considering laying aside my pen forever,\" he said, adjusting his paisley Ascot with his long, tapered fingers. \"For it has become all but impossible for a modem author, even one of my caliber, to write smut.\" \"Good Heavens!\" I coudn't help but exclaim. \"Take my latest work, 'Playthings of Lust',\" said Mr. Pettibone, staring moodily into his brandy snifter. \"The reviews were marvelous. 'Hard core pornography,' 'Absolutely vile,' 'Pure slime.\" Those are only some of the phrases lavished on it. And not one found an iota of litreary merit.\"\" That\"s important?\" \"Crucial. It must be totally without literary merit to qualify as smut. Never had I written more poorly. And then this one idiotic critic from the Baptist Seminary Bulletin had to call it, 'A perfect example of the filth contaminating our society.\" '\"What's wrong with that?\" \"Redeeming social importance,\" said Mr. Pettibone gloomily. \"You see, the Court lifted the ban on 'Fanny Hill' solely because it was a per- fect example of 18th Century pornography. And here, all unknowingly, I'd written a f>erfect modern example of pornography. How can society ban smut if it has no examples of what smut is? Thus my socially im- portant work was no longer smut.\" \"Most unfair. Was there nothing you could do?\" \"'I tried. I went to my publisher, 'Dirty, Inc.,' and demanded a hard-hitting titilating advertising campaign. This would redeem it under Justice Brennan's opinion that a work promoted by titilating ad- vertisements is obviously smut.\" \"Ingenious.\" \"Yes. The blurb on the jacket said: 'The dominat theme of this material taken as a whole will appeal to your prurient interest!' But was anybody titilated? No. In the end, not a single book dealer would sell it under the counter. It was a complete flop.\" \"A tragedy,\" I said. \"And now, thanks to the Supreme Court, you have renounced pornography and I assume you will turn to writing good, clean, socially acceptable novels?\" Mr. Pettibone looked aghast. \"Good gracious,\" he said. \"I just explained how difficult it is to guess what the Supreme Court thinks smut is. I couldn't even begin to guess what they think it isn't.\" Ak)i7 cmse^ Cf POLICE mbJ FOCUS eRien/Ajuces OF iwe comvm^.

This performance will take place on the evening of October 3, and will run for one night only. The much anticip)ated Reader's Theatre, directed by Miss Alexander, will be a reading of the Broadway ver- sion of \"The World of Carl Sand burg.\" This will run three nights, from Thursday, October 20 through Saturday, October 22. On his return to the States, Mr. Corey will direct the world pre- miere production of \"Widow's VClalk, ' a drama by the Texas play- wright, Ramsey Yelvington. The dates for the presentation are De- cember 2, 3, and 8, 10. Following this on February 16-18 and 23-25.

The site of the two hour concert will be the new Shreveport Civic Theater on the evening of November 19- This concert will be presented as part of the Senate's Activity Fee pro- gram and all students will be admitted free. Since their first recording, Romantic composers, and make it \"Bach's Greatest Hits,\" the fantas- tically popular seven French singers and their American leader. Ward Swingle, have viraially been in orbit on the concert stage. And what do the Swingle Sing- ers do.** Mr. Swingle and his ex- traordinary singers take the music of Bach, and other Baroque and swing. The most remarkable fea- ture, perhaps, is that the notes are left exactly as the composer wrote them — there are no deletions, changes, or additions. The only ad- justment necessary is the use of bass and drums to set the fugues, preludes, and other compositions in 4 A time and, to repeat, make ir swing.

Dittie No. 1 : Speaking of orientation, good Freshman Follies on this campus come few and far between. From all indications this class could produce a real winner. \"Proof\"??? Dittie No. 2: Your yearbook is called the Yoncopin. A yoncopin is a water lily. This flower disappeared with the \"sleepy silver bayou.\" Conclusion: Both were obsolete. Of course, nothing else at Centenary is outdated. Dittie No. 3: Speaking of Registration, the Physics Department wishes to announce that they are not in competition with he English Department for the initation of Computerized Departmental Program- ming. We are lucky that Mr. Staff was hired. We understand that he is IBM's busiest representative. Dittie No. 4: Speaking of staff, here is a nursery rhyme which you could use to depress any upperclassman with any memory at all: Hickory Dickory Dock The P.R. Man ran up the clock — The clock struck one, down he run. Hickory Dickory Docked. Dittie No. 5: Speaking of Mother Goose, you have undoubtedly been advised to write home often. We submit to you a vocabulary de- signed to confuse the most discerning parents. a. My roommate has three pair of helitroope underwear. I'm afraid she is nouveau-ricity. b. I had a medtokra time at the ball park last night. My date was just plain burgoisee. c. Mrs. Hazzard tapped a keg of our favorite Kool-Aid today — statutorri grape. Dittie No. 6: Speaking of statutorri grape, congratulations to the zoo animals who performed with Wilson Pickett after 11. Dittie No. Last: The cafeteria line seems to be growing every day. Brace yourselves for long waits. Expansion of the facilities is not on the agenda. (\"This is a very familiar story; I know these people. I don't like familiar stories.\") Mandrake Speaks Dear Incoming Freshman: Wecome to Centenary College, home of the BMOK ( Big Mandrakes on Klampus) Fraternity.

Active in all phases of campus life, from professional fraternities to student government affairs, the choir members strive to upohld the group s reputation of being well-rounded citizens of Centenary. The choir's reputation and traditions stem from a history of twenty-five years of outstanding organizations under the able direction of Dr. A. C \"Cheesy\" Voran. The Choir began in 1941 as of show business. small group of interested singers whom Cheesy had brought together with the idea of presenting choral concerts on campus and in the Shreveport area. The popularity of the group eventually led them to engagements ranging from New York City to the faraway shores of Okinawa. The choir has par- ticipated in the pageantry of nine conventions of the Lions Club In- ternational. These trips alone have taken the singres from Miami to Chicago, from New York to San Francisco. In the summer of 1961, the choir was the featured choral group for the stage show at the famed Radio City Music Hall. While fulfilling the contract in the famed palace of show business, the signers presented four shows a day, each time to an audience of over six thousand people. Operating on a swing-shift basis, the singers each had one week off in which to see the sights of the fabulous met- ropolis. Perhaps the greatest com- pliment given the group during the run was the respect and ad- miration accorded them bv sta^e managers and orchestra members of the Music Hall, the real critics CAMPUS CLASSIFIED \" Classified Advertising for the Conglomerate will be accepted until Tuesday at 4 p.m. prior to each Friday's issue.

The choir also made two notable trips to the Far East; in the spring of 1957 and again in the spring of 1958, to sing for United States military installations in Korea. One of the most memorable moments DR. A. C. XHEESV VORAN of the second trip was the singing of the Easter service as the sun rose over the Pacific on Okinawa. While in Korea, the choir traveled by military air transport planes and the indefatigible work-horses of the armed services. Jeeps. Perform- ing in blistering heat and freezing rain, in airplane hangars and open- air theatres, the young singers earned the reputation of being some of the best troupers ever to tour the U.S. bases. Closer to home, the choir par- ticipates in a yearly tour of South Louisiana and Southwestern Texas in the period between the fall and spring semesters of college. The tour this year will begin on Janu- ary 20th approximately two hours after the last final examination of the fall semester. At that time, the choir will board its chartered bus to go to its lodge at Hodges Gar- dens for \"R & R\" the group's term for rest and relaxation. The tour will continue on its itenerary of Louisiana cities, closing on Januar>' 30th. The singers will arrive back at Centenary just in time to begin the spring semester's work. One of the most spectacular events during the year for the choir is the annual \"Rhapsody in View.\" the debut concert of the year. This year's Rhapsody will be November 15th and l6th in the Shreveport Civic Auditorium. The concert features the choir's repertoire along with solo numbers by certain mem- bers of the group. Aiso featured will be the choir's two excellent accompanists, Ga>ie Boucher, a junior from Springhill, Louisiana, and David Blodgett, also a junior, from Mt. Pleasant, Texas. Gayle and David have proved their out- standing abilities as both fine accompanists and fine pianists in countless performances with the choir. THE 1966-67 'SINGING AMBASSADORS PICTURED AT HODGES GARDENS — Photo by Jim Hampson Hodges Gardens Was Scene of Work and Play In preparation for the busy year ahead, the choir members were at Hodges Gardens near Many, Louisiana for their annual training camp. During the ten days the group was rehearsing and planning for the many appearances they will make. The members were assisted this year by one of the world's leading authorities on English diction. Miss Madeline Marshall from the faculty of ]ulltard in New York. Miss Marshall, or \"Mad\" as she is affectionately known to the choir members, has limited her work with college group exclusively to the Centenary group. As she puts it, 'If I didn't think they were one of the best choral groups in the United States, I woudn't be here.\" This was \"Mad's\" fourth visit to choir camp. In addition to working on the problem of diction in individual sessions each morning. Mad works with Cheesy and the singers during the actual musical rehearsal to study the particular problems of this years repertoire. Her expert advice, the product of many years of ex- perience of working with singers in both popular music and grand opera, is on display each time the choir performs in public. She savs, \"I have yet to be disappointed with the results of our work here. I'm really proud of mv association with the Centenary Choir.\" Along with the work at choir camp goes an equal amount of fun. The choir members have full use of the spacious lodge buiJt for their use by Mr. A. J. Hodges, the re- markable man whose imagination and love of natural beauty caused the creation and development of the famous \"Garden in the Forest.\" The lodge is situated on a beauti- ful lake which, fortunately for everyone, is perfect for swimming and skiing. The recreation of the lake and the quiet beauty of the gardens themselves tend to make the training camp a memorable time for all who participate in the organization. The choir is also featured in tegular, commercially sponsored television programs on KTBS-TV, Channel 3, in Shreveport. South- western Electric Power Company is beginning its fifteenth year of sponsorship of the choir's monthly programs. The programs, which are planned by a committee of choir members, generally require the memorization of eight additional numbers for each broadcast, thus adding still more to an already impressive repertoire. Working on the belief that good music is not the only requisite for an enjoyable program, the choir strives to present an appearance that is equal to its singing. The members are aided in this by the fabled $10,000 wardrobe. Unlike most college choral groups, the Centenary College Choir very rare- ly appears in robes. The choir ladies are presented with the choice of rose taffeta formals, blue chiffon gowns cut along Grecian lines, or white satin dresses featuring a watteau train and removable sheer sleeves. The gentlemen's wardrobes are chosen to compliment the ap- parel worn by the feminine mem- bers of the group, with a brown full dress outfit, stripped trousers and black morning coats, and sum-, mer tuxedoes being called into ser- vice. When a performance does call for robes, the choir dons emerald green vestments with white satin collars. These are used mostly for the choir's frequent appearances in the chapel services at the col- lege. As Cheesy says, \"We are not trying to make a professional musician out of anyone; we just want to develop solid people — real human beings.\" Each choir member is impressed with the per- sonal responsibility he has of being a good representative of both the choir and the college. Though the schedule is busy and the work often ouite difficult, threats and pressure are never used to accomplish the end result. \"We try to love our oeople into doing their work,\" is a favorite expression used to des- cribe both the goal and the \"modus operandi\" of the Centenary College Choir. The results of this theory- are clearly seen in the daily actions and the performance standards up- held bv the members. NEW MEMBERS In addition to the \"old heads,\" people who have been in the choir previously, fifteen new faces were present at choir camp this year. Penny Atwood of Havelock, North Carolina, and Bill Stowe from To- peka, Kansas are traveling the greatest distance to join the ranks of the singers. New members from Texas are Cheryl Mafesh from Daengerfield, and Karen Smith, who hails from St. Augustine. The remaining are all Louisiana res- idents. They are Mary Frances Backstrom and Doug Koelemay, both of New Orleans; Scott Boat- riglit, from New Iberia; Suzette DeW'ese and Linda Garrett, resi- dents of Lafayette; Angie Hoff- pauir, Franklin; Carol Mittelstaedt, Metairie; Mary Jane Price and Al- bert Probst, natives of Shreveport: and Patricia Verlander from Ham- mond.

Few changes were made in the old rules as stated in the college manuel nad \"Gentlemanly Speak- ing\". The only major change was an extension of the warning system used by the resident counselors. As the rule stands now, five warn- ings warrant the student to be brought before the dormitory coun- cil. This council will advise Dean Forrestas to proper punishment or time of social probation. Warrants are given for breakage of any of the rules in the manual. Examples of these are failing to make beds, noise and liquor on campus.

ACTIVITY FEE RECEIPTS: Senate Budget Set At $25,000 This Semester At Its last meeting on Tuesday night, the Student Senate studied the budget plan submitted by Treasurer Alton McKnight and accepted it tentatively. Covering an expenditure of approximately $23,000.00, the budget furnishes the money for all areas of student activity. The money from this semester's groups in the Senate budget. Senate budget will come from three $2,200.00 has been budgeted for main sources: Student Activity Fee, the entire Orientation Program. Yoncopin Fee, and certain fees The main expense for this year included in the tuition charge, was the Wilson Pickett dance in the gym. The Playhouse will be presented approx. $1,000.00 to re- fund their box office for the tickets that students are expected to obtain in seeing plays during the coming year. Treasurer McKnight reported that the Senate would have $3,- 436.25 in the General Fund for this semester to cover any inciden- tal expenses and expenditures over the assigned budgets. This is the first year that the Senate has handled an amount so large covering so many areas of campus life. Last year the Senate budget amounted to $1,200.00 the first semester. The Senate had no control of publications, and for- ums entertainment, and orienta- tion were all budgeted from this fund along with incidental ex- penses. The Playhouse Program is also new this year and is to some extent, like the entire activity fee, a result of last fall's President Con- ference. These fees for the first semester totaled $24,311.25. Money from this general sum will be budgeted to six main groups or committees. The enter- tainment committee will receive approximately $5,000.00 this se- mester to cover costs for \"Big Name Entertainment.\" This com- mittee has already alloted about half of their money to contract \"The Swingle Singers\" who are to perform November 19. Plans are now being formulated to contract a second performer. Another committee to be bud- geted money will be the Forums Committee. For this semester's pro- gram it has been alloted S2.000.00. This semester's Forums plans* are fairly complete. The two student r»ublicati'>ns. the YONCOPIN and THE CON- GLOMERATE, are to receive the majority of the budget. The YON- COPIN will be budgeted wMth $6,800.00 this semester to be fol- lowed in the Spring with another $1,100.00. THE CONGLONfER. ATE will be working on a budget of $3,875.00 this semester. Both of these budgets cover the printing costs, photographic cost, and sup- plies. The Orientation Program and the Playhouse are the last two The special meeting of all graduating Seniors will be held in Mickle Hall 114 on Tuesday, October 4, at 10:30 a.m. the group of 16 adults and 28 students will leave from James Dorm at 2:30 p.m. Ten cars of 4-5 person each will be used to transport the group to the Hodge's special camp within the Garden's limits. This camp, also used by the Choir during their stay at the gardens, has sleeping accommoda- tions, a conference room, a kitchen, and a wonderful view of the lake and gardens. All the major activ- ities, discussions, and meals will be held in the conference room of this camp. The schedule of events calls for five discussion periods, each two hours long, to be held within the Forums Set For Semester The Forums Committee of the Student Senate met Monday, Sep- tember 12, and discussed the plans for the year's Forums program. Those present were Will Finnin, committee chairman, and members Janelle McCammon, Charles Wil- liams, Mike Deare, Taylor Caf- fery, Kay Koelemay and John Wal- ker. The committee has adopted the theme \"Perspectives in a Revolu- tionary Age\" for the year. This framework will allow for speakers in a number of areas, all of which should reflect the turmoil and rap- id change of the mid-20th century. Already contracted for the first semester are Kay M. Baxter for October 20, Kahlid Babaa for Oc- tober 25, and Saul Alinski for November 8. Miss Baxter, a Dan- forth Visiting Lecturer, will speak on \"Man Alone: the Soliloquy in Modern Dramatic Literature.\" Soc- iologist Saul Alinski of Chicago will sDeak on \"The Social \"^evolu- tion in Larg«- Cities\". Kahlid Ba- baa, who has been obtained throu^^h a Shreveport men's orqanizarion, will lecture on Arab-American re- lations. As a fourth speaker for the first semester, the commi«-tee has invited Roy Wilkins. Executive Secretary of the NAACP. Chances are excellent that the committee will be able to get Mr. Wilkins for an early December date. The Forums Committee has two speakers presently planned for the spring semester. They are Dr. Henn' G. Buebee. noted philo- sopher who will speak on existen- tialism, and Richard Hofstader, Pu- litzer Prize winning historian. a thirty minute worship period. Some of the topics that have beer suggested as suitable for discussion this year are: Centenary's History, Purpose and Goals The Student's Role in College Government Student Profile and Admission Policies Athletics at Centenary Student Publications Student Aid Student Services Results of Past President's Con- ferences Forums Committee Student Culture and Academic Climate Chapel, Lyceum, Assemblies, and Convocations Minority Student Groups Campus Mysteries Curriculum and Educational Programs Campus Housekeeping This list is by no means complete and subjects will probably be added and discussed once the conference begins. The schedule also allows ample time for the participants to get together and informally discuss certain problems or even more im- portant just to meet each other and thereby open a channel for future communication. Whether this be done while hiking over the gardens, feeding the ducks, fishing, or playing bridge, it is one of the most enjoyable parts of the con- ference IS to be one of informality. The dress is informal and the entire attitude is one of rested peace. The administration seems to enjoy the vacation from the strain, as well as the faculty and students. In a letter sent to all partici- pants in the conference. President Wilkes suggested that everyone read the following brief articles: NEW YORK TIMES MAGAINE (September 18, 1966), p. 56. LOOK MAGAZINE (October 4, 1966), p. 23. He also suggested the reading of the hisrory and the purpose of the college on pages 8 and 9 of the college catalogue. Any student can benefit from these readings. Following last years conference there was another short meeting held in town last spring. At this meeting the participants in the fall conference met and discussed the progress that had been made since their fall meeting. It is ex- pected that there will be a similar meeting to follow this spring. NOTICE The gumnasium will be open on weekends during the following hours: Saturdays — 1:00-6:00 p.m. Sundays — 1 : 30-5 : 30 p.m. At these times intramural equipment will be available to check out and use.

Time for another tee-vee visit with the rootin*, tootin' Jay Family, starring ol' Elbie Jay, who don't fret about what the polls say any more. Nor any less, either. As we join up with ol' Elbie today, he's a-pacin' back and forth in his study, trying to control himself. As his faithful aide, Wild Bill Moyers, enters, he looks up with a manful smile. W^ll, a kind of sickly, manful smile. Elibie: Well, Bill, ha-ha, what's one little old poll? So it, ha-ha, shows Bobby's now a mite more popular than me. Who, ha-ha, cares what the polls . . . (pausing, thunderstruck) WHERE DID YOU GET THAT THERE LABEL BUTTON? BILL (proudly): From the Avis Rent-a-Car people, sir. I thought they's boost staff morale. Would you care to wear one, sir? ELBIE (grimly): I don't need a button to make me try harder (attempting to recover his good humor) Besides, as the nation's best- dressed man . . . BILL: Excuse me, sir, second best. A new poll's been taken. ELBIE ( glumly ) : He's first in that, too? BILL: But I'm sure you're a strong second, sir. Just as you are in the Most Winning Smile Poll, Sponsored by Dental Health Monthly; the Best Haircut, sponsored by the Barber Poll; and the Man I'd Most Like to Be Marooned With, sponsored by Radcliffe history majors. No, excuse me, Tab Hunter copped second in that one. ELBIE (gloomily): Second in war, second in peace, second in the hearts of my countrymen. W'ell, at least, I got my lovin' family. BILL: Yes, sir. Here's a letter from your youngest daughter saying you'll always be first in her heart. Second, of course, to him. ELBIE (clutching his stomach) Him again? BILL (hastily): No sir, she means Pat. ELBIE: Oh. And I got my loyal aides, like you. (reverently): Yes, sir. I'll always worship you. Second to Him. ELBIE Him? You're fired! Oh, you mean Him. BILL: Yes, sir. In my book, John Lennon comes third. ELBIE: Well, we got to do something about this Bobby. BILL: Shall I send him the poisoned apple? ELBIE: You been reading too many fairy tales. That's not the Christian way. Like I always tell you. Bill, you got to love your enemies. Get him on the phone. BILL (blanching): Yes, sir, but do you think he deserves your love? He isn't really a bad sort. ELBIE (humming happily to himself): Hush, now. Hello? Howdy, there, Bobby. Angry? 'Course not. Nothing I respect like a young man who gets ahead. Even by two percentage points. And to show there's no hard feeling, I want to put your popularity to good use. Now, how'd you like to be in charge of the Vietnam Wiar? Oh. Well, there's other jobs for you. Take your pick: Mediator of Race Riots? Director of Inflation? Ambassador to Cuba? Yes, sir, Bobby I can't tell you how much I want you at my side, out here on the firin' line. WELL, TUNE in again, folks. And meantime, as you mosey down the long trail of life, remember what Elbie's ol' granddaddy used to say: \"If'n a feller's doin' better than you, make him your friend.

Short term sparks mdemm Independent study, concentrated effort, and personal satisfaction made the short term a substantial success. With trips off campus, visiting professors, and experi- mental methods, variety was added to the schedule of class meetings. While some students found themselves quite unoc- cupied, others were burdened with unwieldy, indigest- able assignments. It was encouraging to note, however, that most students were suddenly transformed into ''students\" — perhaps for the first time. The short term was no time for ''spoon-feeding,\" for \"bite-size\" daily assignments from a syllabus. It was a time for feeling responsibilities as comparatively inde- pendent students. It was a time of adventure for both faculty members and class members. An extra-rigorous term paper and final exam sched- ule made the last two weeks of the long term torturous. With careful review and planning ahead, these prob- lems can be eliminated, and probably will be. The system, then, must be evaluated as well worth the trial. The benefits seem to outweigh the detriments by far. A long term with only three-fourths of a sem- ester load, a Christmas vacation with no assignments, a short term with opportunities for real scholarship — these are definite advantages for everyone. Future years will see smoother long terms and ever more diversified programs in the short terms. Wesleyan is functioning in a new dimension of effective liberal education.

The infirmary has been changed to Jackson Hail where a second language lab will be opened soon. The old infirmary building has been renovated and named East Colonial Hall and houses the bas- ketball players. Such changes are the result of the combined efforts of the Dean of the College T. N. Marsh and Dean of Students Aubrey Forrest, both of whom had just settled down to office routine in the Adminis- tratir»n Rnilf^ing when registration beg.i! Dean ALirsh, the academic dean, has announced plans for the open- ing of seven new classrooms and 12 faculty offices in the basement of the library on November 1. Seventeen new teachers have been hired for this semester, 14 of whom are fulltime. The 6'!\", blue-eyed dean lists his main concern as the faculty, the student body and curriculuum. He is intent on strengthening the ex- isting faculty with better salaries and benefits for further study. In the area of admissions, he says the college is geiring a competent ad- missions staff to make the admis- sions requirements more selective. He foresees that as the co' ege grows, the proportion of resident students will rise as the admission staff searches for students who live greater distances from the college. He stated that the \"mixture of backgrounds is of educational val- ue.\" The new dean himself came here from quite a distance, Muhlen- berg College in Allentown, Psu, where he served .i< D' m r College. When asked whchcr iic ch.)Ui;ht the new LSU here, which will open in Sept., 1967, will hurt the en- rollment at Centenary, he replied that he does not think the nvo will compete as thry <or\\r r^-ffrrm^ constituencies Concerning ihl i .i^ .mucc .i>p:- rations for his new home, the dean passed since the two new deans at ir positions, but already changes are \"We are never going to be a large college. This means inevitably that in spite of excellent support we get, we are always going to be limited in our resources. My ideal is that we try to be the best pos- sible liberal arts college, but not all things to all men. I want Cen- tenary to concentrate all its artillery on doing the best possible job of what it does well and that is being a private college devoted to the liberal arts and sciences.\" DEAN FORREST Perhaps the person who has the most direct contact with students is \"their dean,\" Dean of Students. Dean Forrest's new programs have already had an effect on almost all students. Orientation classes began Tues- day, Sept. 20, for all new students and will continue through Novem- ber 1. The mandatory programs are held during the \"break,\" once a week. Each week resident students will receive a calendar in their mail- boxes for the week at Centenary printed on a small card from the Dean of Student's office. The cal- endar will be in the boxes on Monday and will cover events through Sunday. Town students, as well as resident students, will re- ceive a monthly calendar at the first of each month. A new system of discipline is being enacted in the bovs' dormi- tories under the direction of rhe ^l-year-old dean. After three warn- ings in the dorm, the student will come before a house council com- posed of the resident assistants in the dorm. The council makes rec- ommendarions to the dean concern- ing special probation. The new dean expressed his ap- proval of Greek organizations, which are also under his supervis- ion. \"They provide,\" he said, \"the opportunity for students to learn social skills and to organize social activities and give the student a closer knit group to identify with SEARCHING QUESTION REVEALING ANSWER DRAMATIC TRASH Have You Seen Fred Yet? BY MARY HENGY Have you seen Fred yet? You couldn't have missed him, although he is new on campus. His face has that \"Yes, I need some C-O-M-P-O-Z\" look. As a matter of fact, his general appearance resembles a bassett hound the morning after. This will all clear up in time, however. At least it always has in the past. This poor boy is Fred Freshman. Many things have happened to is a three-inch sign, \"I-Z.\" Fred Fred since he drove through the gates of Centenary. He is still wait- ing for something good to happen. Up to now his college life has been strictly confusion and frustration. Fred's first trial came when he tried to move into Cline Hall, only to find Mrs. Pollard didn't have his name on her list. Consequently, he is sleeping on a cot outside the men's room until further notice. Because of the location of his sleeping quarters, he overhears many upperclassmen conversations. One of the topics is the 'Sub.* What can this be? Fred wonders and wonders. It seems this is t/je place to go. Finally someone feels sorry for him in his loneliness and asks him to \"go get some suds.\" Thinking the boy had said 'Sub,' Fred agrees to go. Now he can find out what it is. He is taken to a place some distance from the campus. The place is dark and noisy and doesn't look very safe, but when he sees a merry-go-round Fred decides it can't be too bad. Nevertheless, he does feel awfully uncomfortable; especially when he asks for a choc- olate milk and everyone laughs. The smoke-filled room makes his eyes water. Suddenly his stomach sinks! \"Could this be one of those places Mother warned me about?\" he asks himself. Fred hurries out the back way hoping no one will see him. He wanders back to the dorm to plan his schedule for registration the next morning. He gets there an hour early. He can almost see Mickle Hall from the end of his line. When his turn finally comes up he is told to please get in the correct line. \"Can't you read?\" screams the haggard professor. There, at the bottom of the door they promote the same goals as the Dean of Students' offices does, including social life and ad- justment to college.\" As his office is closely connected to the students, Dean Forrest said he is \"intent on finding out what the students want and making a judgment on what they want.\" When asked why he left Kansas Wesleyan University in Salina, Kans., after serving there as Dean of Students also, to come to Cen- tenary, he said the two most im- portant aims of life are to learn and to be of service. At Centen-^.r/ he feels both of these desires can be satisfied. is an F. Around 10 p.m. Fred is through with registration. Really through. Not only has he missed Barman, Superman, and Rin Tin Tin, but the only classes left for him to take were Japanese Watercoloring, Chinese Rice-growing, Indian Bas- ket-weaving, and Homemaking in the Sudan. Things go fairly well in his first class, Japanese Wlatercoloring, un- til the time for the assignment. He is instructed to write to the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce for a bro- chure on the latest technological advances in coloring brushes. Fred finds his professor is totally un- sympathetic with an inefficient mail system that would need three weeks to deliver something. Events continue to happen in the same vein. He goes to an all- convocation chapel and waits and waits for it to start. Naturally he had assumed Chapel was held in the chapel. Out of the kindness of the janitor's heart, the young man learns it was held in the gym- nasium. He also learns there is no excuse for a chapel cut. In view of all this, one would think a group of wise, self-assured, and dignified upperclassmen would help Fred out. They remain heart- less, however. They are secure in their superiority. Perhaps they do have the right idea. For these up- perclassmen were Fred Freshmen once and only by being Fred Fresh- man have they become what they now are, but that would be another story.

Even in a culture where tradition is zealously guarded against progress, the Noh drama is unique. This art form was born in Japan in 1333 and has descended to the 20th century relatively unchanged. An acgtor begins his training The company will present two at five or six years of age and of the Nohs finest pieces: Kayoi reaches his professional and artistic peak at about sixty or sevenr^^ years of age. So instilled are truth, beau- ty, worship and the soul in this art that it is believed an entire lifeti me is needed to master the subleties. The company that is to come to Centenary is from the Hosho School of Noh, founded in the fourteenth century. The head of the com- Dany, Fusao Hosho, is the direct descendent of the founder. This man, although only in his forties, represents six centuries of theatrical tradition and forty years of train- ing. CAMPUS classified\" UP WITH PEOPLE!

There will be only one perform- ance; at the Marjorie Lyons Play- house, 8:15 Monday, October 3rd. The box office will be open from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. September 26, 27, and 28. Tickets are $3.00. The name Noh, or No (pro- nounced no or know) means \"field-music performance,\" and comes from the earlier title Denga- ku no No. The present form of Noh drama was also influenced by another ancient form called Saruga- lu or \"scattered music.\" These two, Sarugaku and Dengaku, plus recita- tion and mime forms such as the Kowaka and the chanted dance, Kuse-Tnai. are the foundation for the Noh. In its simplest form, the Noh play consists of a dance preceded by a dialogue which explains the movement. The chanting and reci- tation are done by a chorus of ten or twelve men to the accompani- ment of a flute, r^'o hand-drums, and occasionally a stick-drum. All of the movement is done by the lead dancer, called Shite, and his assistants, and bv the secondar\\' performer, called Waki. who (as implied by his name.) SIGMA TAU DELTA Members and pledges of Sigma Tau Delta, honorary English fra- ternity, met for the first time this semester at 6 p.m., Sunday, Sept. 25th. After preliminary business. Pres- ident John Goodwin op>ened dis- cussion on the possibility of a literary contest for the spring. The members decided that the fraternity would plan to sponsor the contest again this year. It was also suggested that the fraternity and the Jongleurs plan a combined meeting in December to hear Mr. Ramsey Yelvington, Tex- as playwright, who will be at Cen- tenary for the opening of his play Widow's Walh, on December 4. Pat Ewing was elected temporary secretary during the absence of Paula Stahls. Paula Stahls, Joe Loupe and Dav- id Hoskins read selections of their writing and discussion followed. Present were Paula Srahls, Joe Loupe, Pat Ewing, Mike Deare, Nelrose Anderson, Martha Pickens, David Hoskins, John Goodwin, Jim Montgomery, Frances Victory, and faculty sponsor Tom McNair. FIRST LYCEUM When young Jorge Morel and his gifted guitar appear here on Thursday, Oct. 13 in the chapel, he may offer an exciting South American medley of \"WIest Side Story\" tunes. He may create a Villa Lobos Prelude. He may adapt from de Falla or Gershwin, Albeniz or Torroba. He may give to the audi- ence an exquisite and melodic work he himself has written. Whatever his repertoire, listeners here will be as thrilled by his virtuosity as were the buffs in the capital cities of South America or the enthu- siasts at the Village Gate and the Embers Club in New York. Morel mixes his classic with his modern, his warmth and lyricism with his Spanish flamboyance and excitement, his brilliance in instru- mentality with his appeal for the average music lover ... in the man- ner of a master far beyond his years. CHOIR T-V SHOW Wednesday, Octboer 12 is the date of the first telvised program of the year for the Centenary Col- lege Choir.

Senate Abolishes The Freshmen Cheerleaders The student senate held its regular meeting Tuesday night. President Dick Grisham introduced Joe Loupe as the new I.F.C. representative to the senate. Early in the meeting a motion was made to abolish freshmen cheerleaders, after extensive deliberation the motion passed by a unanimous decision. The basic reason for the decision stemmed from the lack of attendance at freshmen games. It was pointed out that the near total absence of spectators was discouraging enough without having cheerleaders calling attention to the emptiness. Several designs for the activity card were presented, but none were decided on. The activity card that will be used for playhouse productions, entertainment, voting registration, and other activities, sponsored under the new activity fee, will be issued to all students in the near futuure. Freshmen senator elections will be held on October 12, 13, and 14. The candidates will have an opportunity to speak at the I and O to he held the week before the elections on Thursday, October 6, at the break. The senate would like to take this opportunity to invite any student who wishes to meet with them to come to the regular meet- ings which, for the time being, will be held at 6:30 on Tuesdays in the senate room on the second floor of the SUB. Varsity Tennis To Play Match The Centenary tennis match will play its first match of the season tomorrow at 10 a.m. Two new players have joined the squad, Terry Gomila and Andrew Bards. Others playing will be Gary Sutton, Robert Strayer, Bud Ham- mond, Pete Willcox and Jimmy Davis. DERRIS' BARBER SHOP 134 East Kings Hwy. Phone 868-9225 V2 BLOCK EAST .

DISCUSSION OPEN MINDS . . RESULTS Zaher To Organize Discussion Groups On Philosophical Questions A need for campus discussion groups on \"philosophical questions\" has come to the attnetion of Mr. George Zaher, Centenary faculty mem- ber. Mr. Zaher, who is teaching at Centenary under the Woodrow Wil- son Foundation's Teaching Internship Program, called attention to this need in a recent letter to the Conglomerate. In his letter, Mr. Zapher emphasiz- If God does not exist, should ed the philosophical nature of the discussions. He wrote, . . these discussions would have as their aim self-knowledge, rather than know- ledge of the objective universe. Thus any topic can be dealt with, in so far as that topic would en- able the student to gain a better understanding of himself, of his moral needs, and of his place in the world.\" The groups would be composed of about six students who would meet regularly to discuss a topic of their own choosing. The first meet- ing of each group will involve stu- dents only, and at this meeting the participants would decide when and where to meet, what topics would be discussed and for how long, and whether the group should re- main entirely student or involve faculty members also. Thus the pfo- gram for each group would be strictly in the hands of the students. Any students who are interested in participating in one of these groups shuold complete the fol- lowing form and return it by Cam- pus Mail to George Zaher, Box 244, no later than Wednesday. October 12. Specify which topics you are in- terested in, in order of preference Write in topics that you think should be included: What does it mean to die? The pros and cons of organized religion we (can we) be good? May a man disobey legally constituted authority? Can we determine a universal code for moral behavior? The \"back to nature\" move- ment. Good or bad? Please indicate the day of the week and the time which would be most convenient for you to attend a dis- cussion group. Be sure to sign your name, address, and phone number below: Name: Address: Phone No. Notice Centenary students interested in singing with the Shreveport Symphony Chorale have been in- vited to attend rehearsals of the group on Monday evening from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. in Room 201 of the Hurley Mus"
