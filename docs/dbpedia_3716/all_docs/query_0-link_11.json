Embassies off-limits? they ask Efforts by reporters to question Dare after the hearing were blocked by .Pierre Lamontagne, lawyer for the RCMP. • Samson hung over RCMP security like ‘sword of Damocles'. Page 10 Michael Dare, director-general of the Security Service, testified that there is “some question” whether the Mounties. even with a judicial warrant to do so. can bug embassies without violating the treaty. The treaty, ratified by Canada in the eariy 1970s, aims at protecting diplomatic personnel. “Am I going to knock on an embassy door and ask 'Please may I come in’?” the 62-year-old chief of counterespionage in Canada growled. Dare himself raised the subject of embassies as\" he was questioned about the legalities of bugging. He said security service operations have become difficult as a result of “increased sensitivities in re¬ cent months,” an apparent reference to the spotlight cast on the service by public inquiries. He gave the embassy situation as an example. Dare gave no indication which embassies have been bugged and when. He said the RCMP hasn’t yet received a reply on whether or not the practice is legal. Government lawyers were cheeking with Washington and London to find how their counterespionage agencies handled the problem.

Guard downs planes Colonist wire services MANAGCA — Nicara¬ gua's National Guard (army) on Wednesday shot dow n four planes reported to be flying arms and ammuni¬ tion to Sandinisla guerrillas, a senior parliamentarian said. Luis Fallals Debayle. Na¬ tional Assembly vice-presi¬ dent and a cousin of Presi¬ dent Anaslasio-Somoza. said two of the aircraft, both downed 19 kilometres south of Managua, were carrying arms from Costa Rica for the guerrillas. Fallals said the other two aircraft were downed near guerrilla-held Leon and Ma- tagalpa in the north. Military sources said one pilot was captured and was being interrogated. Meanwhile, Somoza sent .National Guard reinforce¬ ments to southern Nicara¬ gua where his troops are caught between two guerril¬ la forces, one entrenched along the Costa Rican border and the other battling for control of the provincial capital of Rivas, where un¬ confirmed reports said the rebels held all but the guard headquarters. A government source said, \"Realistically, we're looking to another three months of fighting.\" He said President .Somoza. who is under heavy pressure from the Organization of .American States—including the United States—to resign, had reaffirmed his vow not to step down until he wins a military victory. Carter suddenly cancels tonight's energy speech THl'RMONT. Md. (UPf) - Presi¬ dent Carter abruptly cancelled his na lionwide energy address Wednesday , catching top aides by surprise. A se¬ nior official said the president was apparently unhappy over the draft of the speech. The speech was originally sche¬ duled for tonight. Press secretary Jody Powell tele¬ phoned a terse cancellation message to reporters from Camp David. Carter telephoned Vice-l’residenl Walter Mondale during the afternoon, apparently to explain the cancellation, but not Energy Secretary James .Schlesinger, Treasury Secretary Mi¬ chael Blumenlhal or domestic affairs aide .Stuart Eizenstat. all heavily in¬ volved in preparing the address. The New Democratic Party has called for an inde¬ pendent investigation into allegations (hat Deputy At¬ torney-General Richard Vogel interfered with the judicial process by telephon¬ ing a judge. Stu Leggatt (NDP—Co- quitlam-.Moody). a lawyer, said an inquiry should be held into charges by Judge Phil Govan of Richmond that he had been been asked to di.squalify himself from a case because a ruling he had made would be an adminis¬ trative inconvenience to the attorney-general's depart¬ ment. Vogel said in an interview that the judge misinterpret¬ ed his' intentions. The call to Govan was to inform him what action his department was taking, he said.

A Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) spokesman said chances were ‘'gottd\" that the effort would eventually succeed though “we don’t have a time limit. It depends on many factors.” WASHINGTON (L'PI) — The United States will pro¬ pose a ban on all commercial whaling at an international conference next week, offi¬ cials said Wednesday. They said the U.S. delega¬ tion planned to ask the Inter¬ national Whaling Commis¬ sion. at its July 9-13 meeting in London, to impose a mora¬ torium until about half a dozen conditions were met. The conditions include a end to \"pirate\" whaling— that done by ships of non¬ member nations in disre¬ gard of IWC quotas, often using ships purchased from IWC nations. Officials said the United States al.so wanted a new plan on which to base whale kill quotas, better estimates of whale populations and a doubling of the IWC budget. In addition, the Americans want nations to be required to provide commission sci¬ entists with information on whale stacks they have been withholding. On the other hand, the U.S. government is also expected to request continued clear¬ ance for Eskimos to kill the endangered bowhead .whale off Alaska, pending a 1981 review of bowhead popula¬ tion data. The Eskimos say the hunt is essential to their nutrition and culture. The United Stales needs a three-quarters vote fur ap¬ proval of its commercial moratorium proposal. The commission will also be considering Australia's call fur a complete ban on commercial whaling.

Andy Stewart, president of the 180,Out)- member Public Service .Alli¬ ance of Canada, said Wed¬ nesday. After meeting Treasury Board President Sinclair Stevens. Stewart reported: \"1 think there is more flexi¬ bility.\" The jobs are to be elimin¬ ated by attrition over three years, but the government has not said when the three years will start, and may even lengthen the period, Stewart said. Ilowiwer, it was clear the government still intended to cut 60,000 jobs, and Stewart repeated earlier warnings that this \"will seriously im¬ pede operations of the public service. \" Stevens has said 10,000 jobs will be cut by attrition in the regular public service and another 20.000 jobs will be elmiinated by gelling crown corporations to the private sector. The government was to announce later this week a number of crown corpora lions to be turned over to the private sector. Stewart said. Held 14 years, Ben Bella free ASHDOWN. Ark.

The tall, athletic intellec¬ tual started his campaign for Algeria's independence from France in 1949. hut spent most of the bitter seven-year rebellion in a French prison. He became president in 1963. Boumedienne, who suc¬ ceeded him after the virtual¬ ly bloodless 1965 coup, died last December. Ben Bella had been report¬ ed living under strict mili¬ tary guard at a villa 40 kilo¬ metres south of Algiers, with his wife and two adopted children. .Stewart and other P.SAC exeeulises went into Wed- nesda.t 's meeting demand ing full disclosure of the gov¬ ernment's future staffing plans. He would not say later whether he got it. \"I can only report that there were some positive aspects \" to Stevens' respon.se. Stewart would not elabo¬ rate. but he said progress was made on two other issues: job security for pub¬ lic service and a PSAC de¬ mand that all employees on long-term contracts be made permanent public service employees. He would not give any de tails, but reported that \"we had a ver.\\ reasonable ex¬ change w ith the minister and 1 believe something positive will come of it.\" The PSAC demanded that the government immedi¬ ately end a two-month hiring freeze which is to end in August. The freeze was im¬ posed to give departments lime to decide where cuts can be made. The alliance wanted the government to give perma¬ nent employment to persons on long term contracts be¬ cause in many cases they are doing the work of full-time public servants, Stewart said. The P.SAC also wanted the government to cease contracting work out to pri¬ vate companies. Stewart said morale in the public service was at its lowest level ever. The BT,OB It dwarfs whole clusters of galaxies and we may collide with it some eon LONDON (Reuter) — Two Brit¬ ish astronomers say they have discovered evidence of a mysteri¬ ous blub of matter deep in outer space. lOtimeslargerthan the big¬ gest cluster ff galaxies yet per¬ ceived by scientists. Andy Fabian of Cambridge Uni¬ versity and Bob Warwick of Lei¬ cester University said X-rays de¬ tected by a British satellite. Ariel 5, indicate the existence of a huge, unexplained mass located perhaps 10 billion light years from Earth. Our galaxy’s nearest neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy, is two million light years away. The mystery object might be pulling our own and our neighbor¬ ing galaxies toward it by the force of its gravity, the astronomers say in a report in Nafure maga¬ zine. The report says a hitherto unlo¬ cated galaxy, much closer to earth than the supposed blob, might be the source of the X-rays. But other recent evidence, from scientists at the University of Cali¬ fornia at Berkeley, suggests that Earth is moving relative to back¬ ground microwave radiation from space. The gravitational pull of the blob would oxplain this. Will the Earth collide with the mystery object, or \"inhomogen- ity\" as the researchers call it? Fabian said this would depend on the nature and duration of the universe. If it did happen it would not be for millions of years. ( / ...

Sotheby’s turns to game trophies Wing-slat breakaway iJot helped save airliner BEST FOOD BUYS! TWO LOCATIONS: WASHINGTON (AP) — An airline pilot who saved his plane and 87 passengers and crew members from a nosedive crash in April by lowering his landing gear might have gotten crucial help when a wing slat broke off, a safety investigator said Wednesday. The slat on the leading edge of the right wing of the Trans World Airlines jet sheared off under the tremendous pressure of the plane's accelerating dive over Mich- t n, said Leslie Kampschror. in charge of U.S. National Transportation Safety ard investigation. The plane, on a flight from New A'ork to Minneapolis April 4, suddenly went into twb barrel rolls and plummeted about 10.- 000 metres before the pilot, Capt. Har¬ vey Gibson, managed to lower the landing gear. Gibson then recovered control of the Boeing 727 and made a safe landing at Metropolitan Airport in Detroit. Three of the persons aboard suffered minor in¬ juries. In a telephone interview, Kampschror said simlilations of the harrowing inci¬ dent showed it was “still possible\" but questionable whether Gibson could have averted a crash simply by lowering the landing gear to provide a drag on the plane's rapidly building speed He said il was more likely that the airliner was saved by a combination of the landing gear manoeuvre and the breaking away of the slat. The slat was extended for unknown reasons and this caused the plane to go out of control, he said. 5124 CORDOVA BAY RD.

Bond said he would have to decide wheth¬ er the slat malfunction was a freak occur¬ rence or one which might happen again. The wing slats extend on takeoff and landing to provide greater lift. In the May 25 crash in Chicago, one slat extended but the one on the left wing did not. creating unequal lift. Five in bike gang slain in ‘July 4tb massacre' CHARLO'TTE, N.C. (UPI) — Five members of the Out¬ laws motorcycle gang, one of them a woman, were shot and killed Wednesday in a \"July 4th massacre\" that an investigator said might spread a biker's war across the nation. Police said it appeared most of the five were slain in their sleep in their tiny, two- room clubhouse in northeast Charlotte. Four of theqj were found inside the house while the fifth was found outside with a shotgun across his chest. One of the bodies had been mutilated. Authorities said shell cas¬ ings from a revolver and an automatic rifle were found on the floor of the club¬ house. \"You've heard of the St. Valentine's Day mas¬ sacre?\" asked a police offi¬ cer in reference to the 1929 slaying of seven gangsters in a Chicago warehouse. \"Well, this is the July 4th mas¬ sacre.\" The group's self-acknow- ledged leader, who called himself \"Chains” (police identified him as William Kincaid Flamont) said the house was full of blood when he found the bodies at 5:30 a m. Wednesday. Police officer Waller C. Hilderman III. the force's expert on the motorcycle gangs, said he was certain the shootings were part of an ongoing fight between the Outlaws and the Hell's Angels gang over control of Charlotte's massage parlors and drug traffic. \"The shoot-out was just a matter of time,\" he said. The two groups also have been fighting each other in Canada this summer, he said, and a least two bikers have died there. “A lot of the local Outlaws had gone to Canada and got¬ ten into the festivities up there and I suppose this is a way (for the Hell's Angels) to pay them back.\" he said. \"If it (the violence) has got¬ ten this far it could go na¬ tionwide.\" City police identified the woman killed as Bridgette Benfieid. 17. of Mount Nolly and one of the men as Wil¬ liam Franklin Allen, 22, of Charlotte, Island Saw Co. 617 Chstham StfMl 365-SSOO BEEMAID 2 lbs.

DUVUIRI THE PURE WORLD THE COLONIST, Thurs., July 5, 1979 3 Basques continue charming bating comfort U.S. antitrust suit sets OPEC boiling Bizarre story ColonUt-Loft An«tias Timts $«rvict Threats of devastating economic re- prisais were ieveiied at the United States Wednesday in response to an antitrust suit filed in Los Angeles against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The threats came from an attorney who said that he had OPEC connections and that the 13-nation oil cartel could impose another oil embargo on the United States and withdraw more than $300 billion in¬ vested in U.S. treasury notes. He said these actions would have a cata¬ strophic effect on the United States, piung- ing the nation into economic calamity un¬ matched since thg Great Depression. But the threats were dismissed by one of the lawyers who brought the suit. He said the reprisals were \"not reasonably pos¬ sible.” Moreover, he said, OPEC’s U.S. invest¬ ments did not even approach $300 billion. The antitrust suit was filed in U.S. Dis¬ trict Court last December by the Interna¬ tional Association of Machinists and Aero¬ space Workers. It accuses OPEC of price fixing, a practice forbidden by U.S. anti¬ trust law. The machinists contend OPEC countries engage in price fixing every time they get together and agree on what to charge for petroleum.' The plaintiffs seek money damages and an injunction that would prevent any por¬ tion of OPEC oil prices traceable to price fixes from being passed on to U.S. consum¬ ers. None of the OPEC nations has answered the suit. The matter comes up next for hearing on Aug. 20. Khalid Al Monsour, a San Fmacisco attorney who said he represented OPEC interests informally, told The Associated Press in London that OPEC nations had not answered the suit because they consid¬ er it \"illegal.” ‘Tf there Is a judgment against them,” he .said, \"they say they will definitely withdraw the funds (invested in U.S. trea¬ sury notes) and place at least a partial embargo on the United States.” Al Mansour said he conferred with OPEC leaders at their price-setting meet¬ ing last week in Geneva. He said President Carter would be wise to intervene \"and make sure the case is not heard.” Al Mansour said he had filed a brief in Los Angeles federal court, asking that the suit be dismissed. f-Shoot only— troops told JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli soldiers on an inva¬ sion of .southern Lebanon last year were apparently ordered to shoot suspected guerrillas and not to take prisoners, an Israeli parliamentarian claimed Wed¬ nesday. The a.ssertion by Meir Pail of the leftwing Sheii party came during a debate of no-confidence in Prime Minister Menachem Begin's government in the context of new allegations of misconduct during the Litani Operation—the three-month occupation of southern Lebanon that began in March, 1978. The Knesset, or parliament, defeated the motion by a 54-to-4 vote with 25 abstentions. Pail's party had demanded the government’s ou.ster for failing to fire army Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Raphael Eytan after he reduced the sentence of a lieutenant convicted of murdering Arab prisoners. Pail said Eytan had not exceeded his legal author¬ ity by reducing the iieutenant's eight-year prison term to two years but he charged the army com¬ mander had used poor judgment in a case of d war crime. ‘ Pail told the Knesset: \"If I put this on the back¬ ground that orders have been given, apparentiy ai.so during the Litani Operation, not to tak& prisoners, meaning to kill them, and if it is true that during the Litani Operation orders were given that every armed person should be shot at once and not taken prisoner,” then the government is not enforcing standing orders \"and is not fit to govern.” Mrs. Linda Mahan, found Wednesday at bottom of 21-metre cliff at Bodega Bay, Calif., is hoisted in litter up to safety.

MADRID (AP) — Basque separatists spread terror through Spain Wednesday, bombing two tourist hotels in I he south and three agencies of a French automaker in the northern Basque region. . Nobody was reported hurt in the bomb blasts as warn¬ ings were given beforehand. But hotel keepers said fear was ruining business, and ihe government ordered extra plainclothes police to Ihe Mediterranean coast to reassure tourists, who are Spain's- No. 1 revenue pro¬ ducer. The government also or¬ dered police protection for members of a parliamen- lary commission on Basque autonomy after four gunmen ambushed and seriously wounded Gabriel Cisneros, a 38-year-old commission member, in Madrid on Tues¬ day, Cisneros, press spokes¬ man for Premier Adolfo Suarez' Centre party, was shot in the stomach as he was parking his car outside his apartment. Suarez told reporters that witnesses heard the gunmen shout the Basque Nation and Liberty (ETA) slogan as they escaped. Now, some beaches arc re¬ ported deserted at the height of the season, and cancelia- tions are piling up. The campaign is causing some concern in Pamplona, where an annual eight-day fe.stival of drinking, dancing and bull-running begins Fri¬ day. CrA, which wants inde¬ pendence for the Basque provinces near the French border in the north, has waged a terror campaign that has taken 43 lives this year. Cisneros was the first politician to be attacked. A chief object of the terror campaign has been tourism, and hotel operators were re¬ porting business at half ca¬ pacity Wednesday.

IS THE FIRST OBLIGATION of a hospital board to patients or to the provincial health ministry? The board chairmen of Victoria’s two general hospitals have delivered radically different answers to this critical question. Chairman Alan Patterson spoke for all the board at Victoria General Hospital last week when he said that hospital has gone as far as directors are prepared to go in cutting funds for patient care. If need be, he said, the hospital will deliberately operate at a deficit to main¬ tain the quality of care at what the board sees as an essential level. For this the trustees were called “irre¬ sponsible” by Health Minister Robert McClel¬ land. Terry ftAntice, board chairman at Royal Jubilee Hospital, says that hospital is deter¬ mined to stay within the operating budget assigned it by the health ministry, even if it means closing down wards or reducing medical services. He tells us that the hospital's problems would be solved if people took better care of themselves because then fewer of them would get sick. Hardly profound — and not likely to influence the rate of admissions. Jubilee will try to discourage unneces¬ sary operations, says this chairman. “If we could reduce the number of requests for operations, we could bring our costs into line,” says Mr. Prentice. He says there are alternative methods of treatment available. Now that’s irresponsible. Mr. Prentice is sH^ing in effect that doctors using Jubilee are now performing needless operations. That is a very serious charge. Which doctors? Where is the proof? Jubilee, like every other major hospital, has a sophisti¬ cated routine for monitoring all surgery to guard against just this sort of abuse. The board chairman makes no mention of this. Instead he has indicted the doctors who voluntarily serve in this monitoring role and has cast a shadow over all the surgeons on staff, not to mention the general practitioners who recommend sur¬ gical treatment for their patients. Specifically Mr. Prentice notes that doc¬ tors at Jubilee want to increase open heart surgery from six to eight cases a week. “That would increase our costs. I don’t see how we could afford that. This is an example of the kind of pressure we face,” he says. But doctors advise that two patients died in the past two weeks while awaiting this expen¬ sive but immensely successful surgery. They were family men in their fifties who probably would have returned to active, productive lives.* Humanity apart, that is also a part of the economic question. To return to the original question: is the first obligation of a hospital board to patients or the provincial health ministry which funds the hospital? First, we should never forget where the ntoney really comes from. Not the health min¬ istry but from all of us, patients and potential patients. Hospital trustees are laymen for the most part, elected or appointed as the voice of the community. They find themselves sandwiched between the provincial bureaucracy, the doc¬ tors and the patients. They have obligations to all — but their first obligation should be to their patients. The board of Victoria General Hospi¬ tal has recognized that. The chairman of the board at Jubilee has not. COMMENT/BRCKGROimD ( From a doctor a profile in courage TORONTO — Of all human virtues, courage is perhaps the most attrac¬ tive. And (here are different types of courage. Straight physical courage is the cheapest, the most common; moral courage the hardest, the rarest. Cour¬ age is often confused with absence of fear, which is entirely dif¬ ferent. A “fearless” person is not necessar¬ ily a courageous one. In order to have true courage, there must be the quality of fear to overcome. And courage re¬ quires stamina. That ', used to distinguish the British soldier. As General Slim, com¬ mander in Burma, once remarked: “The British soldier is not braver than other soldiers, he is just braver longer.” A profound observation. The greatest courage I've wit¬ nessed in recent years involves Dr. John MacDonald, a Toronto surgeon whom 1 knew mostly as a fellow-tennis player at Moore Park. He and his family dominated tournaments and so¬ cial activities. In 1975 John shocked all who knew him by having open-heart surgery. Quietly, unobtrusively, matter-of- factly he went into St. Mike's one weekend and underwent what most of us considered an appalling and dan¬ gerous operation. Those who knew him were awed by his spirit and grit. It seemed so unfair that one so fit should Peter Worthington be striken. But it turned out well. He rebounded with remarkable speed and cheerfulness. Then we learned that John had terminal lung cancer — word was that he diagnosed it himself from his X- rays. His chest was opened again. The results couldn't have been worse for a man in his mid-forties, in blooming health, happy with his second wife, Madeleine, whom he married in 1971 after his first wife died of, you guessed it, cancer, leaving him the sole parent of seven kids, the oldest in his young teens. Madeleine and John added a child of their own to this tennis-playing brood. It was a family such as you rarely see — tight-knit, loyal, con¬ cerned, cheerful, courteous, friendly, self-reliant, bright — everything you'd want of kids. And this is where the courage comes in. John MacDonald overflowed with it. He was given six months to live. So he adapted his philosophy to live one day at a time. He relaxed, got out of the rat-race, and was like a sponge with life. He absorbed every¬ thing, was concerned about everyone, radiated enthusiasm, made no secret of his plight, talked openly, eagerly about his fears, his new philosophy, his fate. He adopted a “policy of hope\" and had a remarkable effect on everyone. He wrote a remarkable, sensitive book that McClelland & Stewart published \"Eureka! I've found it — take an ounce of gold and convert it into a pint of gasoline!\" A century after Custer fell the Sioux are down, not out RAPID CITY, S.D. — It has taken more than a cen¬ tury for history to catch up with the rights and wrongs of the conflict with the Sioux Indians over possession of the gently ,. rolling' . \\ Black Hills, which are an oasis of sorts ff- Marquis Childs in the long sweep of the plains of .South Dako¬ ta. General George Armstrong Custer met defeat and death from the Sioux at the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876, and thereby became a na¬ tional folk hero. Custer had earlier led the expedition that discovered gold in the Black Hills. That led to a rush of gold seekers Invad¬ ing the lands that the Sioux claimed were their tribal heritage. The government in Wash¬ ington secretly ordered that the food supplies they had promised the Sioux be cut off as a form of blackmail to force them to lay down their arms. From then on the rec¬ ord consisted of a long series of court wrangles, with the Indians derhanding compen¬ sation for the lands that had been taken and the gold that had been mined out of the hills. It ended the other day with a dramatic deci¬ sion answering the promises made .so long ago. The U.S. Court of Claims found that the Sioux were entitled to more than $100 million in satisfaction of their claims. The actual amount of the claim — $17,- 553,474 — is comparatively small. But the question the court was called on to decide was whether the governnient's acquisition of the land in 1877 was a \"taking\" as de¬ fined under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitu¬ tion. The court found that it was a “taking,” and there¬ fore the Sioux were entitled to interest on the amount of the claim, the court esti¬ mated that the century of interest would be between $90 and $1 IS million, and that made the award a record for an Indian claim. The glitter of that gold for the estimated 60,000 Sioux who would be eligible to share it is a promise that, like so many promises made to the Indians, is in the dis¬ tant future. The Claims Court decision may be ap¬ pealed to the Supreme Court. And — equally important — the money must be appro¬ priated by Congress and at a time when sentiment against the Indians is growing. Those in Congress who represent states with an In¬ dian population are acting to abrogate treaties and cut back benefits. It is part of the money pinch as state legislatures scurry around to try to make ends meet with drastic reduction in tax levies. The Bureau of Indian Af¬ fairs claims to have the whole business compu- (c) united Feature Syndicate. Inc. last February and which is now to be published in the U.S. — When Cancer Slikes. It outlines how he and his fam¬ ily coped with the reality that he was on borowed time. He tried to help others similarly afflicted. John MacDonald's courage and elan are obvious and exceptional. As impressive was the attitude of his family — the kids, now young adults down to young John, who was born a couple of weeks before his mother died, and Hilary, his and Madeleine's daughter, now five and the family pet. All knew John could die anytime. All lived with it, were prepared by their wise father and equally remar¬ kable Madeleine, to accept death as being as natural and inevitable as birth. They exuded optimism and healthy fatalism and- poise through difficult months when fear gnawed at their souls, and their inner anguish knew no solace. Yet John defied predictions. His six-months life expectancy in 1975 ex¬ tended to three-and-a-half years. At times he seemed to flourish. He still played tennis and — even ravaged by cancer and his by-passed heart— won more tennis trophies to clog the family home. John seemed a walking mira¬ cle; newspapers wrote feature articles about him and his exceptional fam¬ ily. This tennis season John Macdonald was absent. I went to see him on the eve of the general election. He was finishing another book — Facing the Scalpel. It is a unique view of surgery from the patient doctor perspective. A month ago John seemed frail, but vital. Friends worried — but his cour¬ age was infectious. Late last month John Alexander MacDonald died at his home. He was 49. Therq are conventional obituaries which describe his achievements as a surgeon and professor at St. Mike's and University of Toronto. Others can as.sess his research papers. In a way. Dr. MacDonald wrote his own obituary in the last words of his book When Cancer Strikes: “I believe that death . . . may be the most impor¬ tant part of life. I believe that life is infinitesimally short in relation to the immensity of eternity. I believe, be¬ cause of my religious faith, that 1 shall ‘return to the Father' for eternity in an afterlife that is beyond description. I believe unequivocally in life after life. “I believe that though my life was short in years, it was full of experi¬ ence, joy, love and accomplishment; that my own immortality will reside in the memories of my loved ones left behind, mother, brother, wife, sons and daughters, relatives and dear friends. I believe that I will die with love close by and, one hopes, achieve that great gif t of God — death in peace and death with dignity.\" How can one remain immune lo such an example? (c) Toronto Sun Syndicate A rigid sentencing system wouldn’t solve the problem SASKATOON — Public concern about crime in this country is mounting. Some people feel that sentences handed out by our courts are too lenient and encourage crime. .Some advocates of tougher sentencing call upon our legislators to pass laws requiring mandatory jail terms for more offences. They feel that giving courts discretion in determining sentence is only a licence for lenient sentences. According to the \"get tough school” more jail terms and fewer suspended sentences equals less crime. Donald J. Purich of cigarettes from the corner grocery store? Should they also get a two-year sen¬ tence? Criminal laws must be drafted In general terms; it would be impossible to draft laws spelling out in detail each possible combination of circumstances. The task of judging the severity of each offence and distinguishing the professional criminal from those who have fallen into crime by inadvertence is best left to the judges. terized so that within a year it will be possible — other uncertainties having been resolved — to start paying the claimants. The computer will record each individual's measure of tribal 'inherit¬ ance and blood origins. The bureau's claims are taken with a great deal of skepti¬ cism here, notably on the part of the Indians who have had many unhappy encoun¬ ters with that bureaucracy. The great majority of the Sioux live on reservations in South Dakota, and their plight could hardly be worse. Unemployment runs from 70 to 80 per cent and gainful work is often nonexistent. The alternative is welfare. Far more than any other minority, these Native Americans live on a margin that is a blurred semblance of the tribal past, with little or no relation to the contem¬ porary world. Geography, has a lot to do with it. The Pine Ridge reservation is 60 miles from Rapid City, with roads and communication at a mini¬ mum. Anyone venturesome enough to start a small fac¬ tory, largely on a handwork basis, would find that his first problem would be to organize sources of raw ma¬ terial. So. often, after a year or two, these ventures have faded away. Yet Pine Ridge has its pride out pf the proud past. The tribal chairman and the chiefs have declared that they do not want to accept any part of the claim money. The Black Hills are not for sale. The indifference of the Sioux to the electoral pro¬ cess is understandable. Presidents and Congresses come and go, making little or no change in their abys¬ mal lot. Their average in¬ come is $1,900 a year, well below the poverty line; and while the glory of the sky and the wide sweep of the land may be some compensation, that is very litUe money for existence. The move to tougher man¬ datory sentences is evident in the United States. A 1975 Massachusetts gun control law requires a one-year Jail term for possession of a gun without a permit. A New York law requires a 16-year Jail term for certain drug offenders. A California law (recently ruled unconstitu¬ tional by the courts) re¬ quired a jail term for anyone committing a crime with a weapon. In some states pa¬ role board powers have been severely curtailed and in a few states parole boards have been abolished. Criminal law and the sen¬ tences imposed for criminal offences are a matter of fed¬ eral jurisdiction. In a coun¬ try as diverse as Canada, with social, economic and political conditions and crime rates varying from region to region, sentencing laws must be general enough to allow courts to tailor sen¬ tences to local conditions. Harsher legislated sen¬ tences have their advan¬ tages. If there were a law requiring a mandatory Jail term for theft more people might be discouraged from stealing. Disparities in sentencing arc reduced by mandatory minimum sentences. If there were a law requiring a six- month jail term for theft, thieves in both Rankin Inlet, Northwest Territories and Hamilton, Ontario would get six months. Such a law would also mean that a thief who took $900 and one who took a package of cigarettes would both get at least six months. If the law required a jail term for theft and you be¬ lieve that vengeance has a role in sentencing, the know¬ ledge that a judge must send a thief to jail will cause more satisfaction than if the jud¬ ge has the option of giving a jail term, a fine or a suspend¬ ed sentence. But the advantages of laws which require mandatory minimum sentences must be weighed against the injus¬ tices which can result from such laws. There are cases where an accused deserves a break; mandatory minimum sentences mean that no one gets a break. The severity of each crime varies - the theft of $900 is more serious than the theft of a package of cigarettes. Mandatory sen¬ tencing laws treat each case alike. For example: a law can be passed requiring that any¬ one planning a crime with another person be given a minimum two-year jail term. When the organized pro¬ fessional criminals got caught planning a credit card fraud no one would think the law was unduly harsh. But what of the two high school students caught planning a heist of a cartoon Speaking at a recent sen- tcncing conference in Saska- toon. Mr. Justice Calvin Tallis of the Northwest Ter¬ ritories Supreme Court pointed out that in sentenc¬ ing in the NWT a judge has to take into account the level of sophistication and under¬ standing of the law in each community. As well, he said, the reali¬ ties of northern living had to be taken into account in de¬ termining .sentence. With hunting a way of existence for some northerners it would be impossible to pro¬ hibit an accu.sed from ever using a gun, he said. Thus, while a law prohibit¬ ing anyone convicted of a criminal offence from hav¬ ing a gun might not cause difficulties in Toronto it cer¬ tainly would In the NWT. One of the reasons for sen¬ tencing criminals Is to deter others from committing the same type of offence. With crime rales higher in some parts of the country than others, deterrence is ob- t iously more necessary in some parts of the country. Crime rates have dramati¬ cally increased in Alberta (particularly in Edmonton and Calgary) in the last few years. The crime rale in Prince Edward Island has not increased in the same manner. Obviously, sen¬ tences in Alberta should re¬ flect the need to deter others from committing crime, more so than in Prince Ed¬ ward Island. In the opinion of many lawyers, sentences in Alberta are much touger than in other parts of the country. A law requiring a manda tory minimum would not allow such variances in sen¬ tence from one part of the country to another. A law passed by Parliament in Ot¬ tawa prescribing minimum sentences might produce loo harsh sentences in Prince Edward Island and too leni¬ ent sentences in Alberta. Certain crimes are more prevalent in some parts of the country than in other parts. Cattle rustling has been a major concern In rural Saskatchewan for a number of years. Drugs are a major problem in Vancou¬ ver. Organized crime is much more prevalent in To¬ ronto and Montreal. Surely sentences should be tailored lo provide deterrence to crimes of major concern in a particular area. Tailoring sentences to local conditions can best be achieved by the judge hearing the case: not by legislators trying loenacl one standard across the country. (Mr. Pur/ch fs d iawver and author ) Alberta’s arrogant Conservatives Edmonton Journal The Lougheed government displays Its arrogance in many ways, and sometimes the petty incidents are most revealing. Speaker Gerry Amerongen warned the legislature this week that certain MLAs might breach parliamen¬ tary rules if they voted on a piece of legislation which directly affects them. The bill allows MLAs lo accept pay for serving on government boards and agencies, and 22 government members had already been given appointments either to the boards mentioned in the bill or to similar government agencies. So the majority of those Tory MLAs quite correctly left the chamber. But four of the Tories stayed and voted fur the legislation. With the huge Tory majority, there was no question of the bill failing: the four simply didn't bother to leave. Later, under some pressure, they wrote letters lo the Speaker requesting their votes be stricken from the recoil. But they remained recalcitrant. Insisting they had done no wrong; they were backtracking simply to \"play it safe.” Half-hearted retractions aside, the four MLAs deli¬ berately defied parliamentary tradition. If the govern¬ ment had a code of ethics they would have broken the code as well. But this government doesn't have a code of ethics because the Tories say they don't need one. They may be right. If they don't obey the rules we do have, why bother with new ones? iMk THE COLONIST, Thurs., July 5, 1979 5 LETTERS/OPimON I GORDE HUNTER one man's opinion It all depends whose ox is gored and right now it’s my ox. . u ^ I am one of those patients awaiting open heart surgery and when I hear that the medics’ request to increase that surgical procedure from six to eight per week, has been branded as “cost increasing,” then I get mad as heil. I get mad as hell at an engineer. Royal Jubilee hospital board chairman Terry Prentice, when he says costs will rise as citizens \"demand” more medicai services. Demand? I wonder if engineer Prentice’s slide- ruie brain can absorb the fact 1 — and ail the other open heart patients on the back burner — didn’t exactly welcome that first heart attack and we certainly didn’t twist our doctors’ arms demanding this medicai service? Doesn’t Prentice realize that such an operation can be the difference between life and death? This is something removed from a cosmetic thing like put¬ ting blobs of silicon into miniature breasts. And| doesn’t he realize that two extra operations per week will save lives and isn’t that what tiie whole medical idea is all about? Make no mistake Mr. Prentice, there are those on waiting lists who do indeed die before their turn on the table comes up. HEAL'rH MINISTER Bob McClelland and I have had our differences in the past, mainly in the site selection for the new Helmcken hospitai, but I guess you could call it a friendly difference of opinion. But this is no longer a friendly battle. Bob McClelland would hold hospital costs and thereby endanger my life and the lives of others. That makes him no friend of mine nor theirs. What monumental kind of rank stupidity is this? What kind of fiscal irresponsibility is Bill Bennett guilty of? He casually spends $20 million on the distribution of BCRIC shares and at the same time, says we can’t spend more to keep two extra people alive per week— 104 people per year. Mr. Bennett, this adds up to horsebleep igno¬ rance and on this basis alone, you do not deserve to lead this province. What kind of fiscal irresponsibility is it, Grace McCarthy, to promise millions of dollars support for an Olympic Games, when you refuse to look after the physical needs of British Columbians? Your Igno¬ rance is every bit as alarming and just as shame¬ ful. Whatever cultural expenditures you have on the book. Mr. Bennett, should be junked until such times as we can afford them, and we damned well can’t afford them if we can’t afford to keep people alive. McClelland has his orders from Bill Bennett and while it would be nice if McClelland would stand up and fight for what he must surely know is right, I realize that as a team member he isn’t about to do this and so the final blame can not be dropped on his porch. ’ Bennett must shoulder the blame and Bennett must accept the responsibility for any deaths that might occur because of his callous bookkeeping approach to human suffering. YOU, BILL BENNETT, are a healthy man. You have no idea of the mental traumas experienced by the physically sick every day. if you had been forced to sit on that open heart surgery waiting list, I have no doubt your approach would be completely differ¬ ent today. 1 wonder. Bill Bennett, if you realize this particu¬ lar waiting list can be three, four and five months long? 1 wonder if you have any real inkling of the fear experienced by these people — fear that comes at any time of any day or night? Every little chest pain can be magnified to the onset of another heart attack. Every arm pain becomes immediately sus¬ pect and if you’ve never been gripped by the cold sweat engendered by such fear, you therefore have no idea what these people go through, what they suffer. One doctor told me the mental punishment is far greater than any physical ache or stab. Mr. Bennett, try to understand what living with such fear means. Try to think that these people are never without this fear. And finally, another quote from Terry Prentice, chairman of that Royal Jubilee Hospital board. \"If people would live better they wouldn’t get sick so’often.” Marvelous, Terry, marvelous — a tremendous grasp of the obvious — but no consola¬ tion whatsoever to those who are sick (some of whom lived by most of the good health tenets,) and who cringe at the cold calculations produced by your engineering thought process. I pray, Terry, that your own good fortune con¬ tinues. Priority on arms rather than child This year has been declared by the United Nations to be the International Year of the Child. What have the people of Victoria (indeed of Canada) done to observe this year? There have been international, art shows, school programs dedicated to lYC, conferences and exhibi- tidns with lYC themes. All these are commendable. But are they doing anything to improve the lot of the world’s children (including our own)? We have all read, heard and perhaps seen the poor, inadequate conditions in which children of the under¬ developed countries live. But what about Canadian children? In our own country thousands of children are under¬ nourished; adequate housing is becoming difficult to at¬ tain for many: education and medical facilities are be-' coming less than satisfactory. Examples can be seen among our native Indian population — infant mortal¬ ity is 26.1 per 1,000 as compared with 14.3 for the rest of the population; more than 70 per cent of their homes have no indoor toilets. While our government Is reducing its social services expenditure by $2.3 billion, the 1979 arms budget is $4.4 billion and in addition $2.3 billion has been designated for new fighter planes. And our new government has pledged to increase the arms budget. It seems our priorities are backwards. Instead of spending our tax dollars to Improve our lives, the gov¬ ernment is wasting the money and perhaps bringing us closer to annihilation. During this lYC what bet¬ ter way can there be to give our children a future than to demand that the government of Canada reverse its priorities by cutting the arms budget in half and use the funds thus .set free to give our children a chance.

Is it possible for a moment to conceive of the events of the world as action taking place within a vast cosmic script, the actors assuming they have some control over that action, but in fact in spite of free will, being sub¬ ject to destiny and to d necessary law of action and reac¬ tion that fulfills itself both in the collective and individ¬ ual experience of man? If we thus view the present energy crisis, we may find a metaphor that will enable us to benefit from the pressure of this event. Let me explain. Western industrialized man has for a long time exploited nature for his own material needs. It is as if man has assumed natural resources exist in an infinite supply and are there to be used in proportion to man’s desires for comfort, for satisfying the requirements of his lifestyle. This without any sensitivity to the natural balance or relationship that exists between exploitation and its effects on the earth. Now in terms of the script. Western man is being confronted by the sense of isolated egohood that made him believe he could live on this planet without feeling any sense of appreciation for how that planet served, nourished, supported him — the feeling that would hum¬ ble him. and partially create the sense of interrelated¬ ness that would link him to the mystery of his origin, to the mystery of his own unfathomable existence. After all he is made of the elements of the earth, is the most intelligent resource of nature, the one creature capable of affecting the universe so as to transform that universe — bo^reatively and destructively. The Overseas Petroleum Exporting Countries natu¬ rally relish the power they can exert on the ihajor in¬ dustrial nations, and no doubt act out of a sense of enjoying that pressure they can bring to bear on coun¬ tries whose egos have never before been subject to the whims of smaller countries. Rather than condemning their actions, however, and pouting or lashing back, we should understand this action to be part of the script, that they are the instru¬ ments of our fate, and ultimately we can, because of their response, learn to restructure our relationship with the earth, restructure it in such a way so as to insure our prosperity, but within a design that drives us into a more profound sense of that relationship, that makes us work more creatively to maintain the ecology of our own beingness — that is, the reality of ourselves as a species of life fully responsive to the miracle of possessing a nervous system capable of experiencing a sense of \"I”, the sense that makes us responsible for our destiny, or at least for doing justice to the poetic freedom we have, as a result of the script, to decide whether we are free or determined. We are \"evolution made aware of itself,” and as such must demonstrate to nature our willingness to change our habits of ego-separateness, when such separateness places us in the predicament we now are in. It is thus a tremendous challenge we face now in developing new sources of energy, in conserving our present sources of energy; but instead of lamenting this fact, we should perhaps consider our present condition as but the reminder of our place in the scheme of things, and the physical fact that expresses a much more powerful truth: that we must be more thoughtful, unselfish, and creative in order to deserve the miracle of our existence. ROBIN CARLSEN, 1225 Sunnyside Ave., Victoria. Planning shifts inspire humor As the big spending starts on the hospital planned so no one can get to it without miles of driving in a car, Saanich and the region catching each other out on regional planning is almost humorous. Why does the region now hint at going back on its promises and allowing more intense development around the hospital? Why does Saanich want another big shopping centre for the area? Who gains? Perhaps there is nothing wrong with getting as much traffic as possible onto that new highway to secJiow quickly we can bring more of the interchange way of life here. But is this 1930 or 1980? Let us hope tlie region maintains its own commit¬ ment at Helmcken and establishes a sensible conclu¬ sion with Saanich at Tillicum. And let us hope these solutions establish both the region’s rights and Its abili¬ ties at regional planning. CLAUDE MAURICE, 2200 Lome Terrace, Victoria. Napping in the gallery? ICBC and the Socred cabinet are coming under veiled accusations for not giving more publicity to changes on March 1 to put impaired drivers under the gun. It obviously was not to their advantage to hush this up. It is probably the case where a civil servant had not yet awakened from a long winter nap. (I am-still waiting, after nearly 11 months, for a reply I was told I would receive within a week.) What of Her Majesty’s Loyal Op¬ position? Were they so busy telling everyone how many bathroom walls they were going to paper with BCRiC shares that they did not have time to keep up with their homework and read the B.C. Gazette where this informa¬ tion was apparently published? Of course, we cannot expect too much from either the government or the Opposition because they both owe their positions to the vagaries of the voters, who at times make the most incredible choices, ignoring complete¬ ly past performance and logic. What is really disa|)pointing, and a bit frightening, is that none of the media picked this up from the B.C. Gazette. We have come to depend on them to keep us informed of these things, and in turn to keep the vari¬ ous governments honest. They have their positions through hard work and the ability to dig out news, and not from sweet talking some voters. Perhaps the two largest B.C. dai¬ lies being on strike had lessened the competition so some' of the Press Gal¬ lery have joined the civil servants in a nap! ALF FLETT, 6216 Shoreline Dr., Nanaimo. Civic Scene by Hubert Beyer With the summer sun beating the brains of our local body politic to a pulp, things aren’t moving too swiftly at city hall these days and the time is opportune for a bit of election talk. Who will be doing what to whom next November and with whose help? Unless Mayor Michael Young suffers sunstroke between now and November, he will step down. No ifs, no buts. Anyone interested in a job with long hours, medio¬ cre pay and guaranteed criticism? You bet. The mas¬ ochists are lining up. First in line are the two favorites. Aid. Wil¬ liam Tindall and Murray Glazier, but someone else is waiting in the wings. Aid. John Hayes thinks it might not be a bad idea to take run at the mayor’s job. It was Aid. Robert Wright who put Hayes up to it. Wright has his own reasons for wanting Hayes to run and his logic is compelling. NEXT TO A WORLD without killer whales, nothing scares Wright more than the prospect of Glazier be¬ coming mayor of ’Victoria. So why doesn’t he take Glazier on at the polls? Wright may not want to be mayor himself or he may not feel confident enough to knock off Glazier. At any rate, he isn’t going to oppose him. Someone else has to do the job for him and it doesn’t much matter who. Tindall would do fine, as far as Wright is concerned, but he says he believes that Glazier, would clean Tindall’s clock in a two-way fight. And he may be right. When it comes to stalking the political corridors, Tin¬ dall is no match for Glazier. But Wright says a third candidate would be able to run away with it. And that’s where Hayes comes in. « That isn’t to say Hayes is being manoeuvred by Wright. Hayes has put in four years as an alderman and his civic duties cut heavily into his job. Another term as alderman doesn’t look all that enticing to Hayes. The mayor’s job is something else. Hayes may go for broke and run for mayor. If he loses, he’ll be out, which is all right with him. If he wins, so much the better. AND JUST WHAT WOULD Hayes’ chances be of becoming mayor, and how certain is It that both Glazier and.Tindall will run? The latter is fairly certain. Glazier can’t afford to wait for another two years. Although he wouldn’t have any trouble being re-elected as alderman, he wouldn’t get enough support to get him back into his job as chairman of the Capital Region Board. And without that. Glazier would be deprived of his most effective platform. Already he’s using that position to turn himself into a sort of roving ambassador protecting the local beaches against the disasters of potential oil spills. If he waits two more years before taking a stab at the mayor’s office, he’ll also have to deal with his colleagues Robin Biencoe and William McElroy, both of whom have higher political ambitions, and eitluT of whom could count on the New Democratic Party ma¬ chine for support. So, Glazier has to make his move this time. Tindall, on the other hand, finds himself in much the same position as Hayes. He’s been around as an alderman for eight years and unless hecan snare a bigger catch, he’s ready to call it quits. He, too, will run almost certain¬ ly- THAT GETS US BACK to the third candidate and. yes, his chances of beating both Glazier and Tindall ^ would be good. He woiAdn’t be a guaranteed winner, but then, he won’t have to be. The way Wright looks at it. Glazier and Tindall would draw from the same Base, the conservative, business-oriented crowd. Hayes would get a lot of community support. He’s done a good job looking after things, such as the Neighborhood Improvement Pro¬ gram and he’s made a lot of friends in the process. Hayes would also get support from the NDP ma¬ chine, albeit in a more reserved fashion than would Biencoe or McElroy. And he would get Wright’s support. Or would he? Wright wouldn’t encourage Hayes to run, expecting him to split the vote in favor of Tindall. Or would he?
