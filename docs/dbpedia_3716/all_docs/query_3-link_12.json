Since 2015 he is a permanent collaborator of Sanpapié as an actor, playwright, and vocal performer. With Sanpapié he realises, among others, the shows 24 times per second, Amartés – Il Viaggio di Caino, Orpheus Reloaded and Mémoire. From the collaboration between Sanpapié and Teatro della Contraddizione is born the theatrical format Balerhaus, which after having made its debut at the TDC goes on to be performed in Festivals and Theaters such as OrienteOccidente, Granara, Elfo Puccini Theatre, Teatro della Tosse, LAC.\n\nHe writes text and scripts and as a dramaturg, he is involved in numerous performing art projects and site-specific shows for organizations and companies such as the National Foundation of Dance / Aterballetto, the Estense Gallery of Modena, the Municipal Theatre of Carpi, the Crono Eventi association, the Festivaldellafilosofia. For several years he has been carrying out research that investigates the relationship between music, poetry, and performance. The show A Minute of Silence, of which he is the author and interpreter, made his debut at Teatri del Cimone Festival in August 2018. Since 2008 he has been involved in theatre training.\n\nDancer / performer\n\nBorn in Magenta, in the province of Milan, he trained as a dancer with the Padova Danza company directed by Gabriella Furlan Malvezzi, with which he performed in Italy and abroad (Paris, Dubai, Cannes, Beijing); and as an actor under the guidance of Roberto Innocente. After moving to Milan in 2003, he completed his artistic training by attending workshops with Mamadou Dioume and Danio Manfredini. Since 2010, he has been advancing the visual and performing art research project Elektromove | Visual and performing art: more of a space for sharing than a theatrical company, it thrives on the fusion of various artistic languages and draws inspiration from diverse sources (nighttime animation, physical theater, video mapping, electronic music, and digital scenography), participating in national and international festivals.\n\nSince 2013, he has been a part of Sanpapié, where he has danced in 2+2=5 (2013), En haut en bas (2015), Ode all’olio (2015, of which he is a co-author), and has taken part as a performer in Memoire. Storie di bellezza nascosta (2017) and Balerhaus (2017).\n\nPerformer, dancer, teacher, creator of multimedia events, videomaker\n\nBorn in Rome in 1956, he has lived in Genoa since 2011.\n\nHis basic training was in sport, he then cultivated a passion for movement, following study and work paths that were decidedly more related to gesture as language. In 1981, he obtained a degree in motor sciences at the Higher Institute of Physical Education in Rome, and from the late 1970s to the present day, he has taught and collaborated in various contexts: artistic, educational, in public institutions, in mental health centres and in prisons. It is in all these contexts that his research takes place; an experience fundamentally of relationships, which has influenced his working methodology, characterised by educational, pedagogical and social aspects. This methodology is inspired by the sense of play, improvisation and real-time composition.\n\nOf great importance for his training were his work experiences with Jerome Savary, Robert Wilson, Amy Luckenbach, Bill T. Jones, Boris Vecchio, Studio Azzurro and Patrice Chereau. He has lived in several Italian cities and abroad, collaborating as dancer/performer with Teatro alla Scala in Milan, L’Opera National De Paris, Staatsoper Berlin, The Place Theater of London, Fringe Festival of Edinburgh, Music Theater festival of Pakistan, Festival musica y ideas Mexico City, Studio Azzurro Milan, Accademia di Brera Milan, Yale University USA, Millenium Stadium Beijing.\n\nThe interest in the performative act as a social fact, shared with other artists and with people of different ages, backgrounds and cultures, has gradually materialised in various interventions carried out on the territory, with the people who live it: “Iblu del Lago” Festival (Trevignano R., Rome 2002-2004), “un Po blu” Festival (Tresigallo, Ferrara 2004-2007); “sinfonia di parole” (Genoa 2012 – Milan 2014); “l’isola sonora” (Genoa 2013); “dame” (Naples, Ferrara, Rome, Genoa, from 1995/2016); “il caffè sospeso” (Genoa 2017).\n\nIn recent years, his attention has turned towards the everydayness of urban contexts, conceiving blitzes, or surprise collective performances, aimed at suddenly subverting the rhythms and habits of a place, creating disorientation and spontaneous reactions, in the casual spectators/actors.\n\nIn 2015, he graduated in History/Anthropology, at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy of the University of Genoa.\n\nPress Office\n\nBy passion, study and personal attitude, I have been involved in communication and media relations for dance and theatre for several years.\n\nI started in 2004 as a production assistant for the Fondazione Mantova Capitale Europea dello Spettacolo for the Arlecchino d’Oro Festival, and two years later I became general manager of the Italian-Swiss dance association and company Ariella Vidach – AiEP, dealing with the organisation of press conferences, festivals, and performances.\n\nSince 2010, I have been working as a freelancer. The focus of my work is in Milan, where I have taken care of the institutional press office for the PimOff and Leonardo da Vinci theatres and regularly collaborate with associations, companies and private individuals for the communication of events in the city’s main cultural venues (Teatro Elfo Puccini, Triennale, Mudec, Fabbrica del Vapore, Casa dei Diritti) or at special events such as Fuori Salone.\n\nI have had the opportunity to collaborate with many artists and companies over the years: Fattoria Vittadini, for which I have been press office manager since 2010 – receiving the 2019 Critical Network Award for Communication Strategies -, Daniele Albanese, Compagnia Abbondanza/Bertoni, CampoverdeOttolini, Teatro dei Lupi, Lyra Teatro, Antonella Ferrari.\n\nI also collaborated with the Centro Servizi Culturali Santa Chiara in Trento as national press office.\n\nSince 2013 I have also been PR Advertising Manager for Danza&Danza, Italy’s leading dance industry magazine.\n\nHe began studying dance in 2005 at the Centrodanzasavona Training Centre; during his training he took part in various performances with Ensamble Cendasa. He deepened his study of contemporary dance and improvisation techniques at Nuova Officina della Danza (Turin). Selected to participate in the Biennale Dance College 2021, under the direction of Wayne McGregor (Venice). Since September 2021 he has been a permanent dancer with the company Sanpapié (MI), for which he has taken part in various productions, performing at the Teatro Elfo Puccini, Fonderia Aterballetto and other prestigious theatres. Since May 2022, he has been working permanently for the company Lost Movement (MI). At the same time he is teaching dance theatre and contemporary dance at the Sanpapié training courses.
