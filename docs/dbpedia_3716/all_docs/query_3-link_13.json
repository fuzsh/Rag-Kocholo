        "text": "Feature Film\n\nDirected by Marlin Darrah\n\nA rejected husband. A beautiful stranger. A dangerous liaison.\n\nFor two couples enjoying a spectacular Egyptian adventure,\n\ntreachery and deception cruise the Nile along with them.\n\nThis 83-minute adventure-thriller involving love, deception, betrayal and redemption was recently filmed on-location and features breathtaking panoramic views of desert Egypt and the Egypt of the pharaohs. AN EGYPT AFFAIR unfolds on an exotic riverboat cruising up the great Nile River between Luxor and Aswan. Shot in 2022, Marlin Darrah assembled for his movie a cast of accomplished veteran actors including Yolanthe Cabau (\"Pain and Gain\"), Massi Furlan (\"Jumanji, the Next Level\") and Alfonso DiLuca (CW-\"Jane the Virgin\") and features three talented and emerging younger actors, Jarred Harper (\"American Housewife\"), Nick Dreselly Thomas (\"Amazon Queen\"), Lesley Grant (\"Paradise Hills\") and Stacey Marie Williams (\"The Cake\").\n\nAnimation/Music Video/Short\n\nDirected by Mythravarun Vepakomma\n\n\"Dance You Are Alive\" represents a unique fusion of my passions — Dance, Music, Animation, and Lego — into a single, transformative Music Video. Thanks to my late uncle, who used to get me valuable cartoon cassettes at a time when we couldn't access or afford them. Drawing inspiration from these childhood cartoons and their imparted life wisdom, this project signifies a personal dream realised.\n\nDespite moments of disillusionment in my career upon recognizing commercial animation's toy-centric focus, childhood memories of impactful cartoons propelled me forward. They showcased the potential to sow seeds of positive change in young minds and motivate a brighter future.\n\nIn 'Dance You Are Alive,' I aspire to ignite inspiration for the freedom of choice we all have to empower innate peace within us. Harnessing the influence of uplifting messages, this video aims to leave a lasting imprint, fostering hope for a better tomorrow.\n\nDocumentary/Feature\n\nDirected by Keyonda Smith\n\nIn northeastern North Carolina, Bertie County is one of the largest counties in the state and is classified as a \"rural\" food desert resulting from \"Food Apartheid.\" As a predominately African American population, there is only ONE grocery store to cover the county's entire 741 square miles.\n\nShopping for junk food is more convenient and economically feasible due to mere accessibility and affordability. Bertie County's economic deprivation has resulted in 100% of all children receiving free school lunches. The area is economically deprived, with few employment opportunities. In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau reported the unemployment rate in Bertie County was 10 to 12%.\n\nDeserted in Bertie examines the County's residents' personal experiences and recommends potential solutions to reduce and alleviate food insecurity.\n\nShort Film\n\nDirected by Lara Britton\n\nTrapped in the trauma of her past and haunted by the voice of her abusive partner, a woman sorts through a wall of boxes in an old, rusty shipping container. With each box she discards, the voice gets louder, the effect of chronic abuse, until she uncovers a long-hidden artifact that sparks long-suppressed memories of who she once was, forcing her to confront her past in order to move on to the future.\n\nFeature Film\n\nDirected by Ryan Smith\n\nELDRITCH, USA features sibling rivals Geoff and Rich Brewer, who have competed all their lives over family, career, and love with Rich coming out on top and Geoff trailing in his shadow. Tragedy strikes and a backwoods cult rumored to have supernatural powers is enlisted to set things right. The cult's bumbling ritual unleashes forces beyond their control and creates mayhem for the quiet, Midwestern town.\n\nFeaturing 13 original songs cowritten by members from the band “Fox Royale”, ELDRITCH, USA’s pop/rock centric melodies carry the audience along the path of this darkly comedic adventure.\n\nFeature Film\n\nDirected by Phil Peel\n\nWhen an old ex RAF wartime pilot rescues an injured woman from a car accident. She says she's a sex worker and their cultures clash as he’s shocked by her feral in-your-face sexuality and she’s exasperated by his mannered irritating routines, but as she slowly recovers they learn to accept each other ..until her violent past returns to threaten both their lives.\n\nDocumentary/Feature\n\nDirected by Guldana Talgat\n\nThis film began as my thesis several years ago. It is a personal look at the local history in my father's hometown as well as an environmental catastrophe that took place there and the natives who struggled to end it. It was a pleasure reconnecting with my father's hometown and the people living there and giving them a forum to share their memories and testimonies.\n\nShort Film\n\nDirected by Iraj Habashi\n\n“Azar “is a taxi driver in Tehran.
