        "meta_description": "In this essay, we examine music and its performative power by engaging in issues such as the localization of global cultural practices, the embracing of cultural practices based on a shared sense of marginalization and peripheralization, as well as the appropriation and resignification of “odd” cultural practices for global consumption, resulting in a cultural mutation of such practices and their objects from “low” to “art.” Our approach to analyze música tribal, a specific type of Mexican “tribal” electronic dance music that partially originated in Monterrey cumbia and, correspondingly, appealed to youths situated outside the mainstream, is to understand musical practices as related to the re-territorialization of foreign cultural practices that give a voice of social legitimacy to historically marginalized individuals.",

        "text": "Era un gran rancho electrónico\n\ncon nopales automáticos,\n\ncon sus charros cibernéticos\n\ny sarapes de neón.\n\nEra un gran pueblo magnético\n\ncon Marías ciclotrónicas,\n\ntragafuegos supersónicos\n\ny su campesino sideral.\n\nTribal Guarachero: Roots and Routs\n\nFig. 1: 3BallMonterrey DJs at a live performance. (Screenshot)\n\n7The appearance of the pointy boots fashion coincided with and contributed to the rising popularity of tribal guarachero music in 2009 in the north-central state of San Luis Potosí, in the small town of Matehuala, just three hours south of Monterrey. Young men and boys wearing pointy boots formed all-male crews to compete in dance-offs at local nightclubs to tribal music. Participants in the dance contests spent weeks on coordinating their dance moves and fabricating their boots. They used plastic tubes, leather, screws, and decorative sequins, flashing LED lights, and other material to craft the pointiest long-toed boots—up to 5 feet long. Matching western shirts and skinny jeans to accentuate the footwear complemented their dance outfit.\n\nFig. 2 and 3: Tribaleros from Matehuala. (Photographs by Edith Valle)\n\n8The success story of this new music and dance style, however, is much more complex than what this brief introduction may suggest. Tribal guarachero is a transnational and global music phenomenon rather than a genre in a strict sense. As such it calls for a deeper social and cultural analysis that considers shifts in meaning for both music producers and consumers. We will thus first take a closer look at the multifaceted identity negotiations and constructions of its actors, their sociocultural affiliations, aspirations of upward mobility, and contested identity politics that include articulations of ethnic, racial, class, local, national, and transnational identifications.\n\nPointy Boots: Contested Identities\n\nFig. 4: Pointy boots. (Photograph by Edith Valle)\n\n17The inventiveness of local youths to fashion their own dance outfit, however, was soon contested as the following myth-making story about the origin of the boots illustrates:\n\n19It was those unusual, “comically proportioned” pointy boots that caught international attention and caused a frenzied debate about identity, Mexican identity in particular, that was mainly carried out on the Internet. Within a couple of years, the boots had become the most contested symbol of tribal identity.\n\n— This phenomenon is one of many that pay tribute to the absurd amount of lead in your candy, and the stupidity that is known as Mexico. Seriously, you’re going to try to give credit to Mexico for inventions from other countries. I’m hoping the borders will be closed soon, no thinking true American would even consider these “fashion.” You need to get a brain wet back [“wetback” is a derogatory term used to describe Mexicans who have immigrated illegally to the United States by swimming or wading across the Rio Grande]!\n\n39 Unedited comments, posted on YouTube in response to the VICE documentary.\n\n— Irrefutable one of the most stupidest trends that I have witnessed. How do these fags run from the Zetas [drug cartel] in these stupid looking boots?\n\nSome felt compelled to write in defense of Mexican culture at the sight of this new fashion, based on a presumption that taste is connected to class, and class to geography:\n\n— Those boots are not cool in Mexico. They are ridiculous and useless, and are usually worn by “Nacos” which are the most poor, outcast, and worthless social group in Mexico. This is not part of our culture, and it’ll never be.\n\n— Not everybody in Mexico is doing this stupidass shit is just one state called san luis potosi … bunch of fucking hill billys. … im guessin only the NORTH EASTERN mexican states … the NORTH WEST states we hate them and laugh at their stupidity.\n\nFor sure, localized transnational music styles have their own distinct histories of migration and racialized class articulations. But it was nevertheless startling to see the aggressive verbal outbursts against the pointy boots fashion posted on the Internet. Some commentators reacted to the frenzy calling for tolerance:\n\n— What is low about this? These people wear what they want, do what they want, and seem to have a great life. I am an European, who loves Mexico and has lived in La Condensa. We all know Mexico is huge and quite diverse, and that tribal is a minority. Mexico is very lucky to (also) have them.\n\n— I think this is so “cool” a little crazy but what the hell.. and they’re not hurting anyone.. why all the bitching.. I’d go see them perform.. and have you seen some of the shoes for women in France?? long tipped with a thick cross shape at the toe... now that was whack… Andale Muchachos!!\n\n— Fabulous. And the self-security of the way they assume they wear what they want is very refreshing. More power to them!\n\n— I can see Lady Gaga, one of the most prolific characters of our modern era, wearing this pointy boot trend, why not the average person? They are specifically worn for partying, not everyday use, I think it’s awesome the type of vision, whether crappy or not, people can come up, it’s their take on creative. The music grew on me and I like it, pretty genius if you think about it.\n\n“Play Hard”: Taking the Mixing and Fashion a Step Further\n\nFig. 5 and Fig. 6: “Play Hard” music video. (Screenshots)\n\nKinda stupid to try to justify the lousy taste that was used to create this video clip. This video clip does not represent Mexico at all. SHAME!\n\n25To which a viewer from Dallas responded:\n\nAgreed, it doesn’t represent Mexico at all. However, it’s quite accurate at representing Mexicans from Dallas (where I live). Most of the stuff in this video is real… exaggerated, but real. I’m not offended, I’m just terribly confused as to what the whole purpose of this video is. I’m clearly missing the point.\n\n26A more differentiated opinion was expressed in the following comment:\n\nIt has become apparent though that the pointy boots (and did I see a unibrowed beauty contestant in there?? Possibly a Frida Kahlo reference…) and some of the newer trends have gona past Mexico’s borders and caught international attention, so like it or not, the video does represent Mexico’s current infatuation with the ugly pointy boots, I mean there are a large number of Mexicans IN Mexico wearing those things, as ugly as they may seem, they have caught the media’s attention to the point that a French producer/DJ is featuring them in his video. I was lost as to what the point was of the video, but hey, I ain’t hating, I’m just left scratching my head…\n\n47 David Guetta, “Play Hard (Behind the Scenes),” http://www.vevo.com/watch/david-guetta/play-hard-beh (...)\n\nThis is a video I was waiting for so many years. I think this is super funny; it’s cultural, because it is talking about a subculture in Mexico that is real: the pointy boots, tribal. I love to show people that have an obsession, have passion and want to be the best at what they do. A lot of people would say: What? Pointy boots? What’s the point? Are they crazy?—No, they are not crazy. I thought it was fun to show it to the world and do it with a sense of humor.\n\n28The video footage was shot in two days in the picturesque neighborhood of Santa María la Ribera, located in the Cuauhtémoc district of Mexico City, just west of the historic center, and the Rodeo “Santa Fe.” Altogether one hundred people—crew members, actors, and dancers—and an additional 85 extras for the rodeo audience on the second day of shooting were enlisted. African American R&B recording artist Ne-Yo and Senegalese American R&B and hip hop recording artist Akon collaborated with Guetta on the song; the dance parts included Guadeloupean French hip-hop new style dancers and choreographers Laurent and Larry Bourgeois, an Internet sensation known as Les Twins, as well as the Mexican crews Los Socios and Tribal Matehuala, and teenage tribal dancer Ariel Ruiz. Despite the apparent Mexican theme, the main cast was truly international, and they obviously had a lot of fun acting for this video. Guetta’s interest in the tribal subculture, however, was rather selective: it was the exotic pointy boots that caught his attention, not the tribal music. The young 3Ball DJs found their own way to “go global.”\n\nTribal Goes Global: Internet and Social Media\n\n30The idea to produce tribal music, its expansion and the success of 3BallMTY, the acceptance and impact of this music all depended largely on the use of technology. The networks of electronic music distribution had already been established by DJs in Monterrey and the city’s urban alternative music scene had enjoyed a growing popularity. 3BallMTY was riding with the tide. However, before their music was “discovered” by producer and remixer Toy Selectah (Toy Hernández) who aided them with their first official release, a free EP with five tracks of tribal guarachero music, the teenage DJs had gradually built relationships and networks amongst kindred spirits. According to DJ Erick Rincón:\n\n49 Erick Rincón, “Pepsi 3BallMTY – El comienzo de todo,” http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6sXtNy3D60, p (...)\n\nThe same way as tribal Monterrey became known, through the social networks, we [the members of the group] too found each other through social networks […] There I met Sheeqo Beat [Sergio Zavala] and we agreed to meet in person because we only knew each other online and by sharing music. We decided to play together at a party. When I heard him, I discovered that we liked the same kind of music: tribal […] We started to think that it would be grand to have a project where we could play tribal together.\n\n54 Interview by LA Remix.TV, “Entrevista a Eric Rincon 3ballmty en Pepsi Clasico de Calle,” http://www (...)\n\nIt is a single chosen by the listeners, right? [Well,] Inténtalo came out, “Besos al aire” and ten more songs. And the ones I liked most were “Inténtalo” and “Besos al aire.” So we uploaded “Inténtalo” as the first single and then “Besos al aire.” A fan uploaded it to YouTube without video and it got over one million hits. And then it was removed because of copyright issues […] Right now the official video is out. In four days it got half a million hits.\n\n— I believe that today there is an important relation between the Internet and the artist. In reality, the future of what can happen between the Internet and an artist is here already! That is, an artist can be much more in touch [with his/her audience] than any time before. You can do twitcams, tweet, answer via Facebook, or use Instagram to post photos of your house, what you eat, such things. I believe the Internet is the closest contact an artist can have with his/her fans.\n\n56 Rincón and Alberto Presenda (DJ Otto), “Pepsi 3BallMTY.”\n\n— We only recently started to use Facebook and Twitter. These are two really big media for diffusion because there are many people who do not watch television but are online instead. The mayority of the youth uses Twitter or Facebook. That’s why it helps us a lot to interact with our public, with the people who follow us. We always keep track. In fact, my cell phone is right next to me and I’m always on Twitter and Facebook, responding to people that follow me.\n\n35According to Fouce, virtual audiences expect musicians to maintain close contact with them and respond to their demands. Communication via Internet and the social media networks makes such an intense and immediate contact possible. To attract and keep a virtual audience interested involves several activities by the artist, such as maintaining a profile, facilitate access to one’s music through the Internet, “cuddle the audience” and “offer something special.” Besides uploading material regularly, artists also post photos of their performances, update their profiles and comment on their current activities, send greetings, dedicate songs, or write blurbs to keep contact with the public.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\n43The trajectory to global fame for the Matehuala pointy-boot tribal dancers had started with the VICE video, watched by millions of viewers since it was put on the Internet. Despite scorning and hateful, racialized reactions posted online, it was the inventive boots that caught the eye of international artists, music video directors, shoe designers, and marketers of tourist products alike. In an ever more global, competitive music and business world, consumers desire products that are perceived as new. The perceived newness of the pointy boots was due to changes in just one attribute of the product: the exceedingly elongated toe. The product per se was frivolous or, in Guetta’s words, “super funny.” Some of those who attributed cultural meaning to it, however, perceived the innovation as “horribly ridiculous.”\n\nFig. 7: “Terrestrial” by Cindy Santos Bravo, in collaboration with pointy boot producer Alberto Sánchez Garza, Monterrey. (Used with permission of the artist.)\n\n46Accelerated by new communication media and new socializing practices, the various appropriations of the pointy boot and the mixing and remixing of tribal guarachero, the constant reinterpretation and resignification of images and sounds, both locally and globally, not only challenge our relationship with cultural objects and practices but also urge us to consider shifting and diversified perspectives to understand such practices."
