        "text": "What types of businesses operate in New York State?\n\nTypes of businesses that operate in New York State are:\n\nBusiness Corporation\n\nNot-for-Profit Corporation\n\nLimited Liability Company\n\nGeneral Partnership\n\nLimited Partnership\n\nSole Proprietorship\n\nCan I incorporate nationally?\n\nNo. There is no mechanism in the United States to incorporate on the federal level. A company interested in incorporating (or forming a partnership or limited liability entity) must contact each state's licensing authority individually.\n\nWhat is a business corporation?\n\nA business corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the individual(s) who compose the business. It has rights and abilities similar to those of a natural person. Principal features are perpetual duration, limited liability and easy transferability of interests. A corporation may be formed for any lawful business purpose or purposes. The Department of State cannot offer advice about the choice of business formation and strongly recommends consulting with legal and financial advisors before making the decision.\n\nHow do I form a business corporation?\n\nA business corporation may be formed by filing a Certificate of Incorporation pursuant to Section 402 of the Business Corporation Law. The Department of State has prepared instructions intended for use by first-time domestic incorporators. It includes answers to commonly asked questions, names and addresses of other government agencies that a corporation may need to contact, instructions for completing a Certificate of Incorporation, tax information, and fee information.\n\nAre There Any Special Responsibilities Associated With Forming a Corporation?\n\nThe existence of the corporation begins upon the filing of the Certificate of Incorporation with the Department of State. After the corporate existence has begun, an organization meeting of the incorporator or incorporators must be held for the purpose of adopting by-laws, electing directors and transacting any other business. (See Section 404 of the Business Corporation Law.) The initial by-laws of a corporation are adopted by its incorporator or incorporators at the organization meeting. (See Section 601 of the Business Corporation Law.)\n\nThe corporation is required to keep correct and complete books and records of account and must keep minutes of the proceedings of its shareholders, board of directors and executive committee, if any. The corporation must also keep a record containing the names and addresses of all shareholders, the number and class of shares held by each and the dates when they respectively became the owners of record thereof. (See Section 624 of the Business Corporation Law.)\n\nIn addition, a meeting of shareholders must be held annually for the election of directors and the transaction of other business on a date fixed by or under the by-laws. (See Section 602 of the Business Corporation Law.)\n\nPlease note by-laws and corporate books and records are not filed with the Department of State or any other state agency. These are internal documents maintained by the corporation. The Department of State cannot provide legal advice regarding the preparation of these documents.\n\nWhat is a Professional Service Corporation?\n\nOne or more professionals may form, or cause to be formed, a professional service corporation (P.C.) for pecuniary profit for the purpose of rendering the professional service or services that the professionals are authorized to practice. A P.C. is formed by filing a Certificate of Incorporation pursuant to Section 1503 of the Business Corporation Law. “Profession,” as defined in Section 1501(b) of the Business Corporation Law, includes the occupations regulated by Title VIII of the Education Law plus any practice as an attorney and counselor-at-law, or as a licensed physician. A form for filing the Certificate of Incorporation for a P.C. may be obtained from the Department of State’s website.\n\nHow do I determine if the name I want to use is available?\n\nThe Division of Corporations is required by statute to reject for use any corporate, limited partnership, or limited liability company name that is not \"distinguishable\" from existing names on file. The only avenue to determine whether a name is available for a corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company is to make a name availability inquiry. The Corporation and Business Entity Database online search is intended for status inquiries of entities already on file with the Department of State. Customers are cautioned to avoid interpreting database search information as an indication that a name is or is not available for use.\n\nThe records of the Division of Corporations may be searched for availability of name by submitting a written request to the Department of State, Division of Corporations, One Commerce Plaza, 99 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY 12231. The written inquiry should state that you wish to determine the availability of a name and list the name or names to be searched.\n\nAlthough it is not required, it is recommended that a copy of the name availability response be attached to the document you are submitting for filing.\n\nA finding that the name is available is not an approval of the name by the Department of State and is not a determination that the proposed name satisfies any particular requirement of law. No expenditure or other commitment should be made in reliance upon the availability of a name.\n\nPursuant to Section 96 of the New York State Executive Law, the fee for searching the records for availability of name is $5 per name submitted. Please note that the Department's determination regarding the availability of a name applies only to the date and time that the name search was completed. Requests for name availability cannot be handled by telephone.\n\nHow does a foreign corporation apply for authority to conduct business in New York State?\n\nA foreign business corporation may apply for authority to do business in the State of New York by filing an Application for Authority pursuant to Section 1304 of the Business Corporation Law.\n\nWhat is a \"backer\" or a \"cover sheet\"?\n\nThe word \"backer\" or the phrase \"cover sheet,\" as used in filings made with the Division of Corporations, describes a page of information that must accompany each certificate submitted for filing. The backer/cover sheet contains the following: (1) the name of the document (e.g., Certificate of Incorporation of ABC Inc.); (2) the statute under which the certificate is submitted for filing; and (3) the name and address of the filer of the certificate. The filer's name and address are used as the mailing address for the filing receipt (the only routine documentation issued upon a certificate filing) or rejection letter (describing changes and/or additions required to meet guidelines for filing). For filers using preprinted forms, the backer is provided on the last page.\n\nWhere can I get my corporate kit or corporate seal?\n\nCorporate kits may be purchased from a legal stationery store. A corporate kit usually contains a corporate seal, blank stock certificates and forms for the adoption of by-laws and recording the minutes of meetings. Rather than composing their own forms, some may find it easier to use the preprinted forms provided in a corporate kit. Please note that New York State law does not require a corporation to have a seal. Your telephone book's yellow pages or a yellow pages information operator (your area code + 555-1212) may be helpful in locating a legal stationery store.\n\nHow do I obtain copies of documents filed with the Division of Corporations?\n\nFor more information on requesting copies of corporation or business entity documents, visit the following page: https://dos.ny.gov/copies-corporation-or-business-entity-documents\n\nHow do I obtain a Certificate of Status?\n\n(Also referred to as a Certificate of Good Standing or Certificate of Existence)\n\nA Certificate of Status may be obtained by submitting a written request to the New York State Department of State, Division of Corporations, One Commerce Plaza, 99 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY 12231.\n\nThe written request must include the following information:\n\nA specific statement requesting a Certificate of Status.\n\nThe exact name of the corporation or other business entity.\n\nThe DOS ID number or the exact date of formation or authorization, if known.\n\nA statement as to whether the request is for routine processing or expedited processing.\n\nThe mailing address where the Certificate of Status is to be mailed.\n\nThe fee for a Certificate of Status is $25.\n\nCertificates of Status cannot be ordered through this website, by email or over the telephone.\n\nThe Division of Corporations will accept written requests for Certificates of Status by fax. Fees for written requests by fax must be paid using your credit card/debit card. To pay for a fee using your credit card/debit card, simply complete and sign the Credit Card/Debit Card Authorization Form and submit it to the Division of Corporations with your written request. Written requests for Certificates of Status may be faxed to (518) 473-1654.\n\nThe large volume of submissions and requests received each day by the Division makes it impracticable for Division staff to verify receipt of individual customer submissions. Please do not call the Division for verification of receipt after submitting a certificate or request by fax. If you do not receive correspondence from our office after a reasonable period of time has elapsed, you may contact the Division at (518) 473-2492 for further instructions.\n\nPlease note that a Certificate of Status will be returned by first-class mail. We do not provide these documents by fax. You may request that your certificate be returned to you by overnight delivery service by including a prepaid shipping label with your request. The Department of State will not accept prepaid shipping labels with the Department of State listed as the sender. The prepaid shipping label must list yourself as the sender and the receiver.\n\nHow do I file a Certificate of Assumed Name?\n\nCorporations, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies are required by statute to conduct activities under their true legal name. If a corporation, limited partnership, or limited liability company desires to conduct activities under a name other than its true legal name, a certificate complying with Section 130 of the General Business Law must be filed with the New York State Department.\n\nAre Framing Certificates Available?\n\nFraming Certificates are available from the NYS Department of State, Division of Corporations for those entities on file with the Department. Each certificate is printed on 11\" x 14\" parchment paper and is suitable for framing. The fee is $25.00 per certificate (check or money order payable to \"NYS Department of State\").\n\nSend your request to:\n\nNYS Department of State Division of Corporations\n\nOne Commerce Plaza, 99 Washington Ave.\n\nAlbany, New York 12231-0001\n\nFor additional information: (518) 473-2492\n\nDoes the Division of Corporations accept payment by Credit Card/Debit Card?\n\nThe Department of State's Division of Corporations accepts MasterCard, Visa and American Express for the payment of fees and services. Requests for copies of documents, certificates under seal, name availability, service of process and all documents submitted for filing may be paid by credit card or debit card.\n\nWith the exception of service of process, which must be made in person, all documents submitted for filing and written requests for other services may be faxed or otherwise delivered to the Division of Corporations. To pay for a fee by using your credit or debit card when not appearing in person, simply complete and sign the Credit Card/Debit Card Authorization Form and submit it to the Division of Corporations with your request. You may fax a document submitted for filing to the Division of Corporations at (518) 474-1418. Written requests for copies of documents, certificates under seal and name availability may be faxed to (518) 473-1654. Biennial Statements may be faxed to (518) 486-4680.\n\nPlease note that filing receipts, copies, certificates under seal and responses to name availability requests will be returned by first-class mail.

The Department of State will not accept prepaid shipping labels with the Department of State listed as the sender. The prepaid shipping label must list yourself as the sender and the receiver.\n\nMay I fax a request to the Division of Corporations?\n\nThe Division of Corporations will accept requests for filings of documents, copies, certificates under seal and name availability by fax. Fees for requests by fax must be paid by charges to your credit card/debit card. To pay for a fee by using your credit card/debit card when not appearing in person, simply complete and sign the Credit Card/Debit Card Authorization Form and submit it to the Division of Corporations with your request. You may fax a document submitted for filing to the Division of Corporations at (518) 474-1418. Written requests for copies of documents, certificates under seal and name availability may be faxed to (518) 473-1654. Biennial and LLP Statements may be faxed to (518) 486-4680.\n\nPlease Note: With faxes, we recommend that you submit your certificate or request only once. Sending multiple submissions of the same certificate or request may result in duplicate filings or multiple performance of the same service with an applicable and non-refundable fee charged. The Division of Corporations, State Records, and Uniform Commercial Code receives a large amount of submissions throughout the day which makes it unlikely that a duplicate submission will be recognized as such prior to its processing. Therefore, there exists the possibility of duplicate filings or services occurring on the same day with associated fees being charged.\n\nThe large volume of submissions and requests received each day by the Division makes it impracticable for Division staff to verify receipt of individual customer submissions. Please do not call the Division for verification of receipt after submitting a certificate or request by fax. If you do not receive correspondence from our office after a reasonable period of time has elapsed, you may contact the Division at (518) 473-2492 for further instructions.\n\nPlease note that filing receipts, copies, certificates under seal and responses to name availability requests will be returned by first-class mail by the United States Postal Service.

The records of corporations that went out of existence prior to December 5, 1977, are contained in manual inactive files at the Department of State. Although still maintained, a written request must be made for these records.\n\nCustomers are cautioned to avoid interpreting database search information as an indication that a name is or is not available for use. The Department of State is required by statute to reject for use any corporate, limited partnership, or limited liability company name that is not \"distinguishable\" from existing names on file.

Any Certificate of Status or status letter obtained from the New York Department of State will reflect that the corporation or LLC is past due in the filing of its Biennial Statement.
