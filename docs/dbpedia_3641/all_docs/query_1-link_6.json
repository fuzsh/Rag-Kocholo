DED accepts applications from Nebraska cities, villages, counties, or Tribal Government Areas that wish to apply for an Enterprise Zone designation.\n\nDED may designate no more than five areas as Enterprise Zones based on eligible applications. There are currently designated Enterprise Zones in Omaha, South Sioux City, and Otoe County. DED is accepting applications for up to two more Enterprise Zones.\n\nThe Nebraska Enterprise Zones Act requires that no more than one zone shall be located inside the boundaries of a city of the metropolitan class (population 300,000 or greater), and no more than one shall be located inside the boundaries of a city of the primary class (population greater than 100,000, but less than 300,000). All Enterprise Zones located within a single county shall not exceed a total of sixteen square miles in area. Each area designated as an Enterprise Zone following an application period shall meet all eligibility criteria.\n\nFor questions about Enterprise Zone applications, please contact DED at800-426-6505"
