        "text": "2 - 5 MW Landowner and Community Owned\n\nSolar Farms\n\nFast Track Community Solar Farm Development and Interconnection\n\nEnterprise, Utah\n\nCommunity Solar Farms in Enterprise, Utah​ can now be owned by landowners and the local community.\n\nOur 2 – 5 MW Fast Track Landowner and Community Owned Solar Farm Development Program is designed for the community members and landowners of Enterprise, Utah.\n\nOur primary goal is to bring power, profits, and jobs back to the people who live and work in their communities. After carefully analyzing Federal Energy Regulation Committee guidelines, Solarcollab has identified a low-cost, fast-track model to develop, fund, and build 2 – 5 MW solar farms across Washington county, Utah.\n\nWhy only only 2 – 5 MW?\n\nPrimarily because we can get them constructed and interconnected to the grid in record time, at minimal cost, and with fewer regulatory requirements.\n\nThis solar energy investment program is completely unique… a first of its kind, developed by Solarcollab. The program is designed to allow landowners to earn income from leasing their land AND to also participate in the OWNERSHIP of the solar farm.\n\nWe apply for rural grants to reduce the total cost of each solar farm and raise the money for each solar project using several Financial Technology models on the Solarcollab Investment Platform. We use blockchain technology to digitalize the community solar farm that allows us to sell shares of the Community Solar Power Plant to members of the local community. This is the first program of its kind designed to redistribute the profits back to the people where each solar project is located by crowdselling shares of ownership for each solar farm.\n\nFour Easy Steps To Develop A Community Solar Farm\n\nin Enterprise, Utah\n\nSite Assessment\n\nEvaluate the land for solar farm suitability.\n\nCommunity Engagement\n\nInvolve local stakeholders and residents.\n\nFinancing and Fundraising\n\nLeverage DeFi, grants, and community funding.\n\nWhat makes a good Solar Farm site location?\n\nSolarcollab’s Fast Track Landowner and Community Owned Solar Farm program in Enterprise, Utah leverages Fintech protocols on the blockchain that allows us to be able to develop these solar projects in a low cost model so that we can offer equity shares of the solar project to the landowner and local community. Profits that would normally go to a large corporation are now redirected back to the landowner and local community. Check to see if your land meets the following criteria:\n\nLand located inWashington County, Utah\n\nYou need at least 10+ acres of cleared unobstructed land.\n\nLand should be within two miles of a utility sub-station.\n\nLand should be flat with front road access.\n\nLand should have no environmental zoning restrictions.\n\nDemocratizing Solar Farm Ownership in Enterprise, Utah\n\nBringing Renewable Energy to Your Community in Enterprise, Utah. Through the Internet Computer framework, we offer a transparent, secure, and efficient way to fund and manage community solar farms. Shares are tokenized on the blockchain, allowing community members in Enterprise, Utah to invest and participate in governance through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This ensures that profits are distributed equitably among participants.\n\nHost A Solar Farm Application Form\n\nJoin our community solar Initiative in Enterprise, Utah. If you're a landowner in Enterprise, Utah, and want to host a community solar farm, fill out the application form to get started.Complete every field in this form and we will start the process to see if we can bring a community owned solar farm to your local area. Every field in the form needs to be filled in for us to be able to begin our evaluation process to see if your land qualifies for our community solar development program.\n\nStep 5 - Join Our Next Community Conference Call for Enterprise, Utah.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nThese are the most common questions we receive about our 2 – 5 MW Fast Track Landowner and Community owned solar farm program for Enterprise, Utah​.\n\nEnterprise, Utah Landowners and Solar Farm Ownership.\n\nA solar land lease is a contract between the property owner and Solarcollab that allows us to build a solar farm on your property in exchange for lease payments to the landowner. Each land lease contract is different, but generally the contract is for 20 years and sometimes there may be an option to extend the term for an additional number of years.\n\nThe power generated by the solar farm will be sold to your power grid. This could be a local co-op, large energy company, or individual company.\n\nWith the current process involving city planning, permits, and navigating the average 4-year USA interconnection queue bottleneck, the installation of a solar farm can typically take several years. However, our community solar program is designed to be prioritized at the top of the interconnection queue, significantly reducing the timeline. As a result, our solar farms can be installed and operational within six to twelve months. During this time, you’ll be free to continue using your land.\n\nSolarcollab will contract out the operations and maintenace for the solar farm during its life, and will remove all equipment and reclaim your property once the project has ended.\n\nThe presence of a solar farm on your property can affect property taxes, but the specifics depend on local tax laws and regulations. Generally, property taxes may increase due to the added value of the solar infrastructure. However, in many areas, there are tax incentives, exemptions, or reductions available for renewable energy projects that can offset these increases.\n\nAs for who pays the taxes, it typically depends on the lease agreement between the landowner and the solar farm operator. In most cases, the solar company leasing the land will cover any additional property taxes resulting from the installation of the solar farm. It's important to clearly outline tax responsibilities in the lease agreement to ensure there are no unexpected costs for the landowner.\n\nThe amount of land required for a typical solar farm depends on the scale of the project and the desired energy output. On average, it takes about 5-10 acres of land to generate one megawatt (MW) of electricity. For smaller community solar projects, you might need 1-5 acres for a few hundred kilowatts of capacity. Larger utility-scale solar farms can require hundreds of acres to produce multiple megawatts of power.\n\nFactors such as land topography, shading, and local zoning regulations can also impact the land requirements. It's essential to conduct a site assessment to determine the suitability and optimal size for your specific solar farm project.\n\nChoosing the right solar developer is crucial for maximizing your land's potential. Our Community Solar Energy Farm Program uniquely offers multiple revenue streams that no other developer provides, ensuring you make the most money.
