Brooks write about the history of Washington County, Utah for the Utah Centennial County History Series. \"When Utah was granted statehood on 4 January 1896, twentyseven counties composed the nation's new forty-fifth state. Subsequently two counties, Duchesne in 1914 and Daggett in 1917, were created. These twenty-nine counties have been the stage on which much of the history of Utah has been played.\" Published by the Utah State Historical Society and the Washington County Commission."
