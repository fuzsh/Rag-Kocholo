        "text": "As of August 17, 2021, the City of Brighton reviews all submitted Metropolitan Districts with the City of Brighton’s Model Service Plan.\n\nOverview of Metropolitan Districts\n\nWhat is a Metropolitan District (Metro District)?\n\nKnown as Metropolitan Districts, Metro Districts and sometimes known as Special Districts.\n\n“A quasi-municipal corporation and political subdivision of the State of Colorado formed pursuant to the Special District Act, Article 1, Title 32, of the Colorado Revised Statutes.”\n\nDistrict boundaries are mainly concentrated in or designed for a specific subdivision.\n\n“Subject to most state statutes that apply to other governmental entities, such as open meetings and public record laws.”\n\nWhy are there Metropolitan Districts?\n\nDevelopers utilize them to:\n\nAcquire tax-exempt rates to finance public improvements.\n\nAcquire funding over a longer period of time.\n\nLower the costs to themselves.\n\nHave increased amenities and or aesthetics for their subdivision.\n\nPotential benefits to the City include that:\n\nStreet, water, sewer, storm drainage, parks, and recreation facilities get funded.\n\nThe costs of the new development are localized to the area of new development and not put on the backs of other areas and residents.\n\nPreferable to some residents over HOAs.\n\nWhat Can Metropolitan Districts Do?\n\n1.) Finance, construct, operate, and maintain public improvements, such as:\n\nStreetsParks and Recreational FacilitiesTrailsWater and Sanitary Sewer ServicesWallsTransportation SystemsFencingMosquito ControlSignsTelevision Relay and TranslationLightingFire ProtectionDrainage FacilitiesSafety Protection (traffic related)\n\n2.) Levy and collect ad valorem (property) taxes.\n\n3.) Issue debt – bonds, notes, loan agreements, certificates of indebtedness or other obligations, both tax-exempt and taxable.\n\n4.) Acquire, dispose of and encumber real and personal property necessary to the functions and operation of the Special District.\n\n5.) Impose fees, rates, tolls, penalties, or charges for services, programs, or facilities furnished by the Special District.\n\n6.) Create enterprises pursuant to Section 20, Article X of the Colorado Constitution.\n\n7.) Furnish covenant enforcement and design review services in certain circumstances.\n\nHow are Metropolitan Districts Formed?\n\nStep 1: A service plan is submitted to the approving municipality or county by the property owner(s).\n\nStep 2: The approving jurisdiction conducts a public hearing on the service plan.\n\nStep 3: If approved, a Petition for Organization is filed in District Court. This sets up an election for the initial Board of Directors and the authority of the district.\n\nStep 4: The court has a hearing and orders an election (TABOR date).\n\nStep 5: Election results are certified and an Order and Decree is issued officially organizing the district.\n\nWho Governs Metropolitan Districts?\n\nElections regarding the issuance of debt, imposition or taxes and spending of revenues are limited to the taxpayers of the district.\n\nThe Board will initially usually be members of the development team, but over time they are generally replaced by new residents.\n\nService Plans and Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) serve as the guiding documents.\n\nService Plans Must Include:\n\nDescription of services\n\nFinancial information\n\nPreliminary engineering or architectural survey showing how the services are to be provided\n\nMap of boundaries\n\nEstimated population at build-out\n\nEstimated assessed valuation at build-out\n\nGeneral description of facilities to be constructed\n\nEstimated costs of land acquisition, engineering, legal and administrative costs, and costs related to the organization and initial operation of the district\n\nDescription and form of any proposed IGAs\n\nOther information set by State Statutes or required by the approving jurisdiction(s)\n\nMetropolitan Districts in Brighton:\n\nThere are 40 Metro Districts in Brighton as of April 2022\n\nThe Metro Districts are Comprised of 10 Development Groupings:\n\nAdams Crossing\n\nBrighton Crossing\n\nBrighton Ridge\n\nBromley Park\n\nCase Farms\n\nPlatte River Ranch\n\nPrairie Center\n\nRidgeline Vista\n\nBrighton Lakes / Farmlore / Indigo Trails Phases 3-6\n\nVillage at Southgate\n\nAs of April 2022, these districts covered 4,569.68 acres within the City Limits (City is 13,833.26 acres)\n\n33.03% of land in Brighton is in a Metro District\n\nMetro District Map PDF\n\nTo Submit a Service Plan for a New or Amended Metropolitan District in Brighton:"
