        "text": "My experience at Enterprise High has been unforgettable. I have taken classes with my best friends and had the best time. I really liked my experience here. I have one more year here and then I'll graduate and go out to the real world, but I will miss high school and all the fun times I had here. I was a member of a state champion softball team in 2023, and this year in 2024 our boys basketball team also won state. It has been a really great time and although we are a small school and don't have as many resources as a bigger school would. We still have had all the resources I need. I feel like this school has prepared me for college. Some things I would change about this school would be I wish he had more clubs and activities. We have clubs but I wish they had a bigger involvement in the school culture. I wish they did more and tried to involve more students and do more activities.\n\nMy experience at Enterprise High School has been great. Like many school it has had its ups and downs but the community and small town keeps us going. The sports are great! They are competitive but the athletes work as a team. The students show up to every game to support their fellow peers. The academics are good. They could be improved but they are up to standards. Overall the environment is great and is a safe place."
