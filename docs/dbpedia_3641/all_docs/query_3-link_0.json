        "text": "County in Oregon, United States\n\nCounty in Oregon\n\nWashington County is one of 36 counties in the U.S. state of Oregon and part of the Portland metropolitan area. The 2020 census recorded the population as 600,372,[1] making it the second most populous county in the state and most populous \"Washington County\" in the United States. Hillsboro is the county seat and largest city,[2][3] while other major cities include Beaverton, Tigard, Cornelius, Banks, Gaston, Sherwood, North Plains, and Forest Grove, the county's oldest city.[4] Originally named Twality when created in 1843, the Oregon Territorial Legislature renamed it for the nation's first president in 1849 and included the entire northwest corner of Oregon before new counties were created in 1854. The Tualatin River and its drainage basin lie almost entirely within the county, which shares its boundaries with the Tualatin Valley. It is bordered on the west and north by the Northern Oregon Coast Range, on the south by the Chehalem Mountains, and on the north and east by the Tualatin Mountains, or West Hills.\n\nMajor roads include sections of Interstate 5 and 205, the Sunset Highway, Oregon Route 217, 47, 10, 6 and 8. Public transportation is primarily operated by TriMet and includes buses, the Westside Express Service commuter rail, and MAX Light Rail. Other transportation includes air travel at Hillsboro Airport, private airfields and heliports, and heavy rail cargo on rail lines.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Provisional Legislature of Oregon created the county as Twality District on July 5, 1843. Twality was one of the original four districts of the Provisional Government of Oregon in Oregon Country along with Clackamas, Champooick (later Marion), and Yamhill counties. Columbia, later known as Hillsboro, was selected as the county seat in 1850. Washington County lost significant portions of its original area when Columbia and Multnomah counties were created in 1854. The county area was increased by 160 acres (65 ha) in 2014 when a section of Multnomah County was attached to Washington.[5] The area was returned to Washington County to allow for property development.[6]\n\nThe construction of Canyon Road to Beaverton helped Portland to consolidate its position as the primary port of Oregon, and defeat the rival efforts of settlements such as Oregon City and Milwaukie.\n\nIn November 2004, the County and the City of Beaverton agreed to a plan where the city would annex both unincorporated residential neighborhoods as well as high-value areas of land. This would result with Cedar Hills, Garden Home, Raleigh Hills, West Slope being incorporated by 2010, and the communities of Aloha, Bethany, and Cedar Mill at some point after that.\n\nThose plans have since been put on hold after Beaverton attempted to annex Nike, Inc.'s World Headquarters, which would have increased Nike's taxes substantially. Nike successfully lobbied the legislature for a law that would prohibit their annexation for 99 years. Since that decision, annexation plans have been halted, and Washington County started urban planning to provide city-level services to the unincorporated urban areas in the county.[7]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 726 square miles (1,880 km2), of which 724 square miles (1,880 km2) is land and 2.2 square miles (5.7 km2) (0.3%) is water.[8] It is located approximately 20 miles (32 km) to the west of Portland. The Portland Metro Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) bisects the county. The county's highest point is South Saddle Mountain at 3,464 feet (1,056 m) above sea level in the Northern Oregon Coast Range.[9]\n\nMost of the county is in the Tualatin Valley, formed by the Tualatin Mountains to the east and north, the Chehalem Mountains to the south, and the Northern Oregon Coast Range to the west and north. The Tualatin River, located almost entirely within the county, flows through the Tualatin Plains. The northern and western portions of the county are forested, while the remainder of the county includes urban areas, agricultural lands, and floodplains.[10]\n\nWaterways\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Tualatin River is the main river in Washington County. Henry Hagg Lake, southwest of Forest Grove, is the largest lake. The Willamette River lies to the east, the Columbia River to the northeast, and the Pacific Ocean to the west of the county.\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nNational protected areas\n\n[edit]\n\nTualatin River National Wildlife Refuge (part)\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18502,652—18602,8015.6%18704,26152.1%18807,08266.2%189011,97269.0%190014,46720.8%191021,52248.8%192026,37622.6%193030,27514.8%194039,19429.5%195061,26956.3%196092,23750.5%1970157,92071.2%1980245,80855.7%1990311,55426.7%2000445,34242.9%2010529,71018.9%2020600,37213.3%2023 (est.)598,865[11]−0.3%\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 529,710 people, 200,934 households, and 134,323 families residing in the county.[16] The population density was 731.4 inhabitants per square mile (282.4/km2).

Males had a median income of $54,417 versus $40,254 for females. The per capita income for the county was $30,522. About 6.7% of families and 9.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.5% of those under age 18 and 6.7% of those age 65 or over.[19]\n\n2000 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2000 census, there were 445,342 people, 169,162 households, and 114,015 families in the county. The population density was 615 people per square mile (237 people/km2). There were 178,913 housing units at an average density of 247 units per square mile (95/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 82.19% White, 1.15% Black or African American, 0.65% Native American, 6.68% Asian, 0.30% Pacific Islander, 5.86% from other races, and 3.17% from two or more races. 11.17% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 17.2% were of German, 9.9% English, 8.2% Irish, and 6.7% American ancestry. 81.7% spoke only English at home, while 9.6% spoke Spanish and 1.2% Vietnamese.\n\nThere were 169,162 households, out of which 35.60% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.50% were married couples living together, 9.00% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.60% were non-families. 24.70% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.70% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

The median age was 33 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.10 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.00 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the county was $52,122, and the median income for a family was $61,499. Males had a median income of $43,304 versus $31,074 for females. The per capita income for the county was $24,969. About 4.90% of families and 7.40% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.30% of those under age 18 and 5.30% of those age 65 or over.\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe county is governed by an elected board of five commissioners. The county is divided into four commissioner districts. One commissioner sits for each district, and the fifth commissioner is at-large and is the chair of the board.[20]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nLike all of the Yankee-influenced Willamette Valley and Oregon Coast, Washington County was in its pre-Depression history strongly Republican. After Oregon achieved statehood in 1859, Washington County voted for the Republican presidential nominee in every presidential election from 1860 to 1928, except in the 1912 presidential election when the county supported Progressive Party candidate and former Republican president Theodore Roosevelt.[21] In 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt became the first-ever Democrat to win the Washington County vote, and he repeated this success in 1936 and 1940. Between 1944 and 1988, Washington County was never won by a Democrat except in Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide victory in 1964. As recently as 1976, Washington County was the second-most Republican county in the state behind Malheur County in southeast Oregon.[22] Gerald Ford's 17,529-vote margin of victory in the county was decisive in narrowly carrying the state of Oregon during that year's presidential election.\n\nSince the 1990s, the increasing drift of the Republican Party nationally towards the South and evangelicalism, along with urbanization, has resulted in Washington County shifting strongly towards the Democratic Party. No Republican presidential candidate has carried Washington County since George H. W. Bush did so in 1988, and in three of the past four presidential elections, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden all prevailed the county by over twenty percentage points. The last Republican to win a statewide election in Washington County was Gordon H. Smith in the 2002 Senate contest.

In 1997, orchards covered 8,403 acres (34.01 km2) of the county's lands and 1,163 acres (4.71 km2) were devoted to vineyards.[citation needed] Agriculture is still a major industry in Washington County, as are lumber, manufacturing, and food processing.\n\nThe development of a large electronics industry during the 1980s and 1990s is the dominating factor of the county economy, and contributing to the creation of Oregon's Silicon Forest. California-based Intel, Oregon's largest private-sector employer,[25] has its largest concentration of employees in the county, mainly in Hillsboro.[26] Other technology companies include Electro Scientific Industries, FEI Company, Qorvo, Tektronix, SolarWorld, Planar Systems, and EPSON.[27]\n\nNike, one of two Fortune 500 corporations based in Oregon, has its headquarters in Washington County. Until it was acquired by IBM, Sequent Computer Systems was headquartered near Nike. Other companies with headquarters in Washington County include optical instruments manufacturer Leupold & Stevens, Columbia Sportswear, and Reser's Fine Foods.\n\nCommunities\n\n[edit]\n\nCities\n\n[edit]\n\nCity 1990 population 2000 population 2010 population 2020 population Incorporated Notes Banks 563 1,286 1,777 1,837 1921 Beaverton 53,310 76,129 89,803 97,494 1893 Cornelius 6,148 9,652 11,869 12,694 1893 Durham 748 1,382 1,351 1,944 1966 Forest Grove 13,559 17,708 21,083 26,225 1872 Gaston 563 600 637 676 1914 Hillsboro 37,520 70,187 91,611 106,447 1876 County seat King City 2,060 1,949 3,111 5,184 1966 Lake Oswego 30,576 35,278 36,619 40,731 1910 Small portion, most in Clackamas County[28] North Plains 972 1,605 1,947 3,441 1963 Portland 437,319 529,121 583,776 652,503 1851 Small portion, most in Multnomah County[29] Rivergrove 294 324 289 545 1971 Small portion, most in Clackamas County Sherwood 3,093 11,791 18,194 20,450 1893 Tigard 29,344 41,223 48,035 54,539 1961 Tualatin 15,013 22,791 26,054 27,942 1913 Wilsonville 7,106 13,991 19,509 26,664 1969 Small portion, most in Clackamas County[30]\n\nCensus-designated places\n\n[edit]\n\nUnincorporated communities\n\n[edit]\n\nHelvetia\n\n[edit]\n\nHelvetia is a small unincorporated community in Washington County, Oregon.
