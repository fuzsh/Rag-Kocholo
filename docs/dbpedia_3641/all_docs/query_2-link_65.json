        "text": "The Illinois Enterprise Zone Program is designed to stimulate economic growth and neighborhood revitalization in economically depressed areas of the state through state and local tax incentives, regulatory relief and improved governmental services. Businesses located or expanding in an Illinois enterprise zone may be eligible for the following state and local tax incentives:\n\nExemptions are available for companies that make minimum statutory investments that either create or retain a certain number of jobs. These exemptions require a business to make application to, and be certified by, the Illinois Department of Commerce.\n\nIn addition to state incentives, each zone offers local incentives to enhance business development projects. Each zone has a designated local zone administrator responsible for compliance and is available to answer questions. To receive a Certificate of Eligibility for Sales Tax Exemption, you must contact the local zone administrator of the zone into which purchased building materials will be incorporated."
