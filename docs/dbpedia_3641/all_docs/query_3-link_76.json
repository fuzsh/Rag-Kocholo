        "text": "ᎡᎶᎯ ᏓᏟᎶᏍᏛᎢ\n\nMaps\n\nCherokee Nation exercises tribal jurisdiction over a 7,000 square-mile reservation in northeastern Oklahoma. This reservation was established more than 180 years ago, when the Cherokee Nation was relocated to Indian Territory. Oklahoma’s 77 counties were established when the territory officially became part of the United States in 1907, many years after the Cherokee Nation’s land base was established. Today, Cherokee Nation’s Reservation encompasses all or parts of 14 Oklahoma counties, including Adair, Cherokee, Craig, Delaware, Mayes, McIntosh, Muskogee, Nowata, Ottawa, Rogers, Sequoyah, Tulsa, Wagoner, and Washington.\n\nThis interactive map is intended to give a general idea of where the Cherokee Nation’s boundaries are located. For information regarding a specific location or address with regard to tribal service eligibility or district, please contact the service directly to verify.\n\nInteractive Maps\n\nCherokee Nation\n\nCherokee Nation Council Districts\n\nFish and Wildlife Map\n\nExternal Map Resources"
