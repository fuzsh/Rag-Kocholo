        "text": "NOTICE: There are two embedded maps on this page which may take a few moments to load\n\nSee technical notes for geography and poverty definitions\n\nRegion\n\nRegions and Health Reporting Areas (HRA) were created to examine geographic patterns below the county level. Four regions—South, Seattle, East and North—are defined either by combined postal ZIP codes or by city-based Health Reporting Areas (below). The city-based boundaries are used whenever possible; ZIP code-based boundaries are used when data are only available by ZIP code (examples include hospitalization data or data from some surveys).\n\nSome slight discrepancies occur in what areas are covered between the HRA and ZIP code based Regions (contact us at data.request@kingcounty.gov for a map), with the major differences in the North and Seattle Regions. Two ZIP codes (98177, 98133) span the Seattle—North Region boundary and are included as part of the North Region ZIP-based area. However, the HRA boundary has a clean delineation between Seattle and North Regions. Along the East-South Region boundary, two ZIP codes (98056, 98059) overlap both Regions. 98056 is assigned to South and 98059 is assigned to East.\n\nNorth Region includes the areas of Bothell, Cottage Lake, Kenmore, Lake Forest Park, Shoreline, and Woodinville. East Region includes Bellevue, Carnation, Duvall, Issaquah, Kirkland, Medina, Mercer Island, Newcastle, North Bend, Redmond, Sammamish, and Skykomish. South region contains Auburn, Burien, Covington, Des Moines, Enumclaw, Federal Way, Kent, Maple Valley, Normandy Park, Renton, Tukwila, SeaTac, White Center/Boulevard Park, and Vashon Island.\n\nView larger map\n\nHealth Reporting Areas\n\n61 Health Reporting Areas (HRAs) were created based on Census 2020 population counts and geographies for reporting health metrics for King County. Where possible, neighborhoods are defined within large cities, and unincorporated areas of King County are delineated. For confidentiality and data reliability, some areas were combined. HRAs are used whenever we have sufficient sample size to present the data. A map of city-based Health Reporting Areas.\n\nBelow is a list of HRAs. Neighborhood-level HRA are grouped under the city of which they are a part:"
