        "text": "County in Tennessee, United States\n\nCounty in Tennessee\n\nWashington County is a county located in the U.S. state of Tennessee. As of the 2020 census, the population was 133,001.[2] Its county seat is Jonesborough.[3] The county's largest city and a regional educational, medical and commercial center is Johnson City. Washington County is Tennessee's oldest county, having been established in 1777 when the state was still part of North Carolina.[4] Washington County is part of the Johnson City, TN Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson City–Kingsport–Bristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area, commonly known as the \"Tri-Cities\" region.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nWatauga and the Washington District\n\n[edit]\n\nWashington County is rooted in the Watauga settlements, which were established in the early 1770s in the vicinity of what is now Elizabethton, in adjacent Carter County. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War in 1776, the Wataugans organized the \"Washington District\", which was governed by a committee of safety. North Carolina initially refused to recognize the settlements as legal, but finally agreed to annex the district after the settlers thwarted an invasion by hostile Cherokees. The settlements were governed as the Washington District, which originally included all of what is now Tennessee. The district was reorganized as Washington County in 1777.[5]\n\nWashington County, North Carolina and Franklin\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom 1777 until 1784, North Carolina held nominal control over the county, but did little for the residents, at least in their eyes. So the area citizens formed, in 1784, the State of Franklin to meet their needs. Franklin was an early attempt to create a fourteenth state prior to Kentucky and Vermont's admissions into the union. The county reverted to North Carolina control, however, following the failure of the Franklin state government in 1788.\n\nPart of Tennessee\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1790 the area became part of Southwest Territory, and afterward it was admitted to the Union in 1796 as the 16th state.[5] Jonesboro, the county seat of Washington County, is Tennessee's oldest town. With many buildings restored, it comprises one of the nation's most authentic historic districts of the period 1790–1870.\n\nWashington County was divided between pro-Union and pro-secession sentiments at the outset of the Civil War. In Tennessee's Ordinance of Secession referendum on June 8, 1861, Washington Countians voted 1,445 to 1,022 in favor of remaining in the Union.[6] One of the bridges targeted by the East Tennessee bridge-burners in November 1861 was located in what is now Watauga near the Washington-Carter county line.[7] Landon Carter Haynes, a Confederate senator, hailed from Washington County.[5]\n\nJohnson City, originally known as Johnson's Depot, was a major railway center for the southeastern states, connecting the region for freight transportation and passengers. It was the headquarters for both the standard-gauge Carolina, Clinchfield, and Ohio (Clinchfield Railroad), which required the excavation and blasting of 17 tunnels during its construction; and the narrow-gauge East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (Tweetsie). Significant restoration is underway, as well as publicizing the railroad heritage of the Johnson's Depot Historic District. Other historic properties are being restored as representative of Johnson City's late nineteenth and early twentieth-century era as a railway center.\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 330 square miles (850 km2), of which 326 square miles (840 km2) is land and 3.3 square miles (8.5 km2) (1.0%) is water.[8] The western portion of the county is situated in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, which are characterized by long, narrow ridges roughly oriented northeast-to-southwest. The county's most prominent Ridge-and-Valley features rise in the vicinity of its northwestern border with Hawkins and Sullivan counties. The eastern portion of the county lies within the Blue Ridge Mountains, specifically the Bald Mountains (south of the Nolichucky River) and the Unaka Range (north of the Nolichucky).[9] Buffalo Mountain, a long ridge that straddles much of Washington's eastern boundary, contains the county's highest point, 3,520-foot (1,070 m) Pinnacle Knob. The Cherokee National Forest protects much of the extreme eastern part of the county. Sampson Mountain, which rises in the southeastern part of the county, is home to a designated national wilderness area.\n\nThe Nolichucky River flows through the southern part of Washington County. The Watauga River flows the northern part of the county, and forms part of the county's border with Sullivan County. The lower section of the Watauga River is part of Boone Lake.\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nSullivan County (north)\n\nCarter County (east)\n\nUnicoi County (south)\n\nGreene County (west)\n\nHawkins County (northwest)\n\nNational protected area\n\n[edit]\n\nCherokee National Forest (part)\n\nState protected areas\n\n[edit]\n\nChester Inn (state historic site)\n\nTipton-Haynes State Historic Site\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 17905,872—18006,3798.6%18107,74021.3%18209,55723.5%183010,99515.0%184011,7516.9%185013,86118.0%186014,8297.0%187016,31710.0%188016,181−0.8%189020,35425.8%190022,60411.1%191028,96828.2%192034,05217.6%193045,80534.5%194051,63112.7%195059,97116.2%196064,8328.1%197073,92414.0%198088,75520.1%199092,3154.0%2000107,19816.1%2010122,97914.7%2020133,0018.1%2023 (est.)138,420[10]4.1%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nWashington County racial composition[17] Race Number Percentage White (non-Hispanic) 112,606 84.67% Black or African American (non-Hispanic) 5,511 4.14% Native American 289 0.22% Asian 1,980 1.49% Pacific Islander 53 0.04% Other/Mixed 6,426 4.83% Hispanic or Latino 6,136 4.61%\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 133,001 people, 55,817 households, and 33,838 families residing in the county.\n\n2000 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the census[18] of 2000, there were 107,198 people, 44,195 households, and 29,478 families residing in the county.

No National Democratic candidate has won the county since 1856,[19] though Lyndon Johnson came within 359 votes of Barry Goldwater in 1964 and Jimmy Carter came within 819 votes of Gerald Ford in 1976. Franklin Roosevelt is the only other Democrat to even cross the 40 percent mark. The only time the Republicans have failed to win the county since 1868, the first election it competed in Tennessee, came in 1912, when the Bull Moose Party divided the Republican vote and won a plurality.\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Washington County, Tennessee[20][21][22] Year Republican / Whig Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 40,444 67.18% 18,638 30.96% 1,121 1.86% 2016 34,252 68.85% 13,024 26.18% 2,474 4.97% 2012 32,808 68.30% 14,325 29.82% 899 1.87% 2008 32,341 66.03% 15,941 32.54% 700 1.43% 2004 29,735 66.07% 14,944 33.20% 327 0.73% 2000 22,579 59.51% 14,769 38.93% 594 1.57% 1996 18,960 54.42% 13,259 38.06% 2,621 7.52% 1992 18,206 51.31% 13,071 36.84% 4,206 11.85% 1988 19,615 65.63% 10,087 33.75% 185 0.62% 1984 21,762 69.38% 9,452 30.13% 154 0.49% 1980 17,457 57.71% 11,599 38.35% 1,193 3.94% 1976 14,770 50.87% 13,951 48.05% 311 1.07% 1972 17,343 74.79% 5,284 22.79% 561 2.42% 1968 12,882 56.66% 4,930 21.68% 4,925 21.66% 1964 10,612 50.86% 10,253 49.14% 0 0.00% 1960 14,851 69.93% 6,283 29.59% 102 0.48% 1956 13,471 71.23% 5,314 28.10% 127 0.67% 1952 12,023 69.31% 5,245 30.24% 79 0.46% 1948 7,056 61.04% 4,023 34.80% 480 4.15% 1944 6,485 61.17% 4,060 38.29% 57 0.54% 1940 4,719 56.67% 3,565 42.81% 43 0.52% 1936 4,788 51.52% 4,448 47.86% 58 0.62% 1932 3,691 51.71% 3,345 46.86% 102 1.43% 1928 4,887 76.00% 1,543 24.00% 0 0.00% 1924 3,243 62.87% 1,839 35.65% 76 1.47% 1920 4,858 68.21% 2,260 31.73% 4 0.06% 1916 2,723 59.69% 1,831 40.14% 8 0.18% 1912 1,134 26.58% 1,531 35.89% 1,601 37.53% 1908 2,254 58.77% 1,574 41.04% 7 0.18% 1904 2,120 61.63% 1,268 36.86% 52 1.51% 1900 2,488 61.51% 1,496 36.98% 61 1.51% 1896 2,807 61.98% 1,661 36.67% 61 1.35% 1892 2,056 51.58% 1,722 43.20% 208 5.22% 1888 2,008 55.13% 1,534 42.12% 100 2.75% 1884 1,815 53.79% 1,559 46.21% 0 0.00% 1880 2,104 57.17% 1,576 42.83% 0 0.00% 1876 1,739 55.03% 1,421 44.97% 0 0.00% 1872 1,458 63.53% 837 36.47% 0 0.00% 1868 1,217 94.63% 69 5.37% 0 0.00% 1860 0 0.00% 62 2.63% 2,298 97.37% 1856 0 0.00% 1,334 61.70% 828 38.30% 1852 565 39.84% 853 60.16% 0 0.00% 1848 862 45.90% 1,016 54.10% 0 0.00% 1844 881 41.83% 1,225 58.17% 0 0.00% 1840 892 45.16% 1,083 54.84% 0 0.00% 1836 439 36.61% 760 63.39% 0 0.00% 1832 0 0.00% 735 100.00% 0 0.00%\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Tennessee\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
