        "text": "In addition to our industry-leading standards, we provide grants and technical assistance to advance high-quality affordable housing development, partner with researchers to improve the health and quality of indoor environments, and engage federal, state and local leaders on polices that further green affordable housing development.\n\nMany of those living in areas most vulnerable to climate change are communities of color, which is why we’re committed to advancing racial equity while promoting economic and environmental justice. All of our capital tools, technical assistance, programs and policy solutions are designed as a response to the legacy of systematic racism in housing and the increasing racial wealth gap in America.\n\nGreen Communities Criteria\n\nImage\n\nOur cost-effective, above-code green building program includes integrative design, site considerations, water, energy, healthy building, operations/maintenance and resident engagement. It is applicable for new construction, substantial and moderate rehabilitation, historic properties and adaptive reuse across both multifamily and single-family affordable housing projects.\n\nIn partnership with the International Well Building Institute and their WELL Building Standard, we’ve leveraged the best of these impactful programs, and created a path for affordable housing developments in the United States to create best-in-class healthy, efficient and environmentally responsible homes. Projects that achieve certification with the 2020 Criteria are recognized as certified under both Enterprise Green Communities and the WELL Building Standard.\n\nBenefits of Our Approach\n\nProvides strategies to help developments move closer to zero emissions\n\nOutlines resilience criteria that helps better prepare homes to withstand local climate hazards\n\nIntegrates healthy living practices, from ventilation to healing-centered design\n\nDelivers a dual certification with the WELL Building Standard\n\nIncludes water standards that promote efficiency and protect against lead poisoning\n\nUses an integrative design approach to establish collective priorities, giving residents a voice in the process\n\nPromotes economic and environmental justice\n\nLearn more about our criteria and eligibility requirements.\n\nEnterprise recently modified its Green Communities criteria to simplify how developers pursuing our highest level of certification, Certification Plus, can align their projects with the Department of Energy’s newly released National Definition of Zero-Emission Building. As a result, housing providers now have more opportunities to access valuable funding and incentives through the Inflation Reduction Act, while supporting energy and emissions goals for the sector. In another recent update, the criteria now offer housing providers embarked on deep energy retrofits a clear course to Certification Plus, giving existing buildings an on-ramp for IRA opportunities, as well as funding through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and the Community Development Block Grant – Disaster Recovery.\n\nReady to Get Started?\n\nWe are passionate about turning our best practices into standard practices and are here to support you on this journey. To make things easy, we’ve created a certification portal with everything you need to complete your application.\n\nIn addition to a comprehensive overview of our application process, the portal has customizable templates, tools and calculators for your green building certification submittal. We also host regular office hours to answer your certification questions.\n\nAdvancing Green Affordable Housing Development\n\nImage\n\nIn addition to our industry-leading standards, we partner with researchers and government organizations to advance the field of green affordable housing development.\n\nOur practice-informed guidance leverages more than four decades of successful advocacy at all levels of government and experience executing programs to create actionable policies. At the national level, we work with affordable housing institutions including HUD, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to associate more favorable financial incentives for housing that achieves green building standards.\n\nOur team is always working to deepen our understanding of how green building, policies and practices can lead to more equitable development. Throughout our history we have partnered with a variety of leading institutions on research projects designed to advance the field, for example, “Studying Optimal Ventilation for Environmental Indoor Air Quality” with the National Center for Healthy Housing.\n\nLooking to Implement a Green Program in Your State?\n\nMore than 30 states currently include Green Communities Criteria as part of their Qualified Action Plans for the distribution of Low-Income Housing Tax Credits – and many more include some level of green and/or energy incentive(s). We provide guidance on best practices to housing finance agencies and other organizations to help continually move the needle on green building and work nationwide with coalition partners to advance green building across the country. Learn more about the certification offerings in your state’s QAP.\n\nImage\n\nContact us to learn more about how we can help you advance green building for affordable housing in your area."
