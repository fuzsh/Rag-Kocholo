        "text": "Land Acknowledgment\n\nThe land that we know as Port Townsend was first known as a thriving village of the S’Klallam People; this village was called qatáy (“kuh‐tai”). The S’Klallam’s well‐known chief, čičməhán (“cheech‐muh‐hann”), or Chetzemoka, was born at qatáy in 1808. While this area belonged, and still belongs, to the S’Klallams, it is acknowledged that other local tribes camped along the beaches as they visited or moved along in their travels. The City of Port Townsend honors the sovereignty and treaty rights of the three S’Klallam/Klallam Tribes that are tied to this area and continues to strive in partnership for the betterment of our local Indigenous Peoples.\n\n\"City of Dreams\"\n\nThe City of Port Townsend is a beautiful, small town with a rich history and thriving arts scene, set against the backdrop of uniquely preserved Victorian buildings, the Olympic Mountains, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Port Townsend Bay. Port Townsend was founded in 1851 by European settlers and incorporated as a city in 1860. The new city saw a sharp rise in shipping commerce and population density from the 1870s through the 1890s as the Customs Port of Entry for Puget Sound. Named the City of Dreams, Port Townsend had high hopes for a regional rail system that would connect this remote outpost with the bustling ports of San Fransciso, Seattle, and Tacoma. Those dreams abruptly ended in 1893 with a national economic crisis, and the population today is similar to what it was during its 19th century boom period. A thriving paper mill and military fort were major contributors to the stability of the community from the 1910s through the 1950s. This quiet development period coupled with the remote geography of the city are major reasons why the architecture of the city remains largely preserved from the Victorian era.\n\nOur current population of just over 10,000 residents work primarily in local government, the maritime and fishing industries, the Port Townsend Paper Mill, our school and hospital systems, and at many of the small businesses and non-profit organizations that help our community thrive. Port Townsend is the only incorporated city in Jefferson County, and is the county seat, home to the beautifully preserved 1890 County Courthouse and clock tower. The geography of Port Townsend is distinctive as it sits at the tip of the Quimper Peninsula and is approximately seven square miles, rimmed on three sides by water and towering bluffs. The largest neighboring city is Seattle, approximately 112 miles driving distance to the southeast.\n\nWhether you are here on business, looking for information about our local government, seeking employment, or exploring a getaway, we invite you to enjoy our small-town community.\n\nBrowse our website using the search bar or main menu links.
