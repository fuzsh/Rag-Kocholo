With this API, developers can easily access and customize Fair Market Rents and Income Limits data for use in existing applications or to create new applications. To create an account and get an access token, please visit the API page here: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/dataset/fmr-api.html.\n\nFair Market Rents (FMRs) are used to determine payment standard amounts for the Housing Choice Voucher program, initial renewal rents for some expiring project-based Section 8 contracts, initial rents for housing assistance payment (HAP) contracts in the Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy program (Mod Rehab), rent ceilings for rental units in both the HOME Investment Partnerships program and the Emergency Solutions Grants program, maximum award amounts for Continuum of Care recipients and the maximum amount of rent a recipient may pay for property leased with Continuum of Care funds, and flat rents in Public Housing units. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually estimates FMRs for Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defined metropolitan areas, some HUD defined subdivisions of OMB metropolitan areas, and each nonmetropolitan county. 42 USC 1437f requires FMRs be posted at least 30 days before they are effective and that they are effective at the start of the federal fiscal year (generally October 1). Fair Market Rents, as defined in 24 CFR 888.113 are estimates of 40th percentile gross rents for standard quality units within a metropolitan area or nonmetropolitan county.\n\nFair Market Rents: Overview (*.pptx, 1.66MB), (*.pdf, 706KB)\n\n2024\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\nYear\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n2014\n\n2013\n\n2012\n\n2011\n\n2010\n\n2009\n\n2008\n\n2007\n\n2006\n\n2005\n\n2001-2004\n\n2000\n\nHistory\n\nSurvey Information\n\nFMR HISTORY\n\nFMR History 1983 - Present: Read Me (*.doc, 39 KB)\n\nFMR History 1983 - Present: 2-Bedroom Unit data in MS EXCEL (.xlsx, 2.2 MB)\n\nFMR History 1983 - Present: 2-Bedroom Unit data in CSV (.csv, 4.3 MB)\n\nFMR History 1983 - Present: All Bedroom Unit data in MS EXCEL (.xlsx, 6.1 MB)\n\nFMR History 1983 - Present: All Bedroom Unit data in CSV (.csv, 7.8 MB)\n\nFMR History 1983 - Present: All Bedroom Unit data Zip file (.zip, 8.0 MB)\n\n2000 Census Rent Data Used in Calculation of FY 2005 FMRs\n\nTrend Notice\n\nTrend Notice, published March 9, 2011 (*.pdf, 164KB)\n\nComments on Trend Notice, in Proposed FY 2012 FMRs, published August 19, 2011 (*.pdf, 86KB)\n\nQuery Tool\n\nDocuments\n\nData\n\nFY 2024 Fair Market Rent Documentation System\n\nThis system provides complete documentation of the development of the FY 2024 Fair Market Rents (FMRs) for any area of the country selected by the user.
