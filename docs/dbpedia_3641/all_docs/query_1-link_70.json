For more information, please click the link below:\n\nDepartment of Resource Management Operational Overview\n\nThe Planning Division serves as the land use information center for the County. The Division functions as a professional staff to the Board of Supervisors, the Planning Commission, and the Airport Land Use Commission. The Division is responsible for the maintenance and implementation of the County General Plan, the County Zoning Plan, and implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).\n\nPlanning Division staff is available to review and discuss questions relating to land use matters such as zoning, general plans, land divisions, and use permits, and to direct the public to other County and outside agencies that review Planning Division applications. The Planning Division maintains and/or hosts on-line copies of various County codes, regulations, and related maps which can be used for reference.\n\nWhen seeking preliminary information on a potential project or answers to land use questions, it is highly advisable to furnish a detailed project description and, if possible, a preliminary site plan, and location information such an assessor's parcel number(s) or address for the property. Such information will help ensure a faster and more complete response from the Planning Division. In certain instances, the Planning Division may request the submittal of Written Land Use Verification, Planning Directorâ€™s Zoning Interpretation, or Pre-Application if a request for preliminary information or feedback is complex, requires a more official response, and/or when the potential applicant would like formal written feedback.\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to inform interested parties that a particular project being suggested does not satisfy County development standards and, therefore, cannot be recommended for approval. In these situations, staff endeavors to suggest alternative development sites, design modifications, and/or application processes that would make a prospective project consistent with County standards.\n\nThe Department Director and staff welcome suggestions that may add greater efficiency to our review and processing of proposed development projects. The Department's objective is to provide efficient and courteous service to all citizens and property owners seeking our assistance."
