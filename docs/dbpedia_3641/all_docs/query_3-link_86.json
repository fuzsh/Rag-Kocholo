        "text": "Washington State is situated in the far northwestern corner of the United States, and with a land mass of 71,299 square miles, it is the 18th largest state in the US in terms of surface area.\n\nThe US Census Bureau 2015 estimate shows Washington's population has reached 7,170,351, up from 6.72 million recorded during the 2010 census. Washington is currently enjoying a healthy growth rate of 1.27%, which ranks 8th in the country.\n\nIn order to gauge any current population within Washington State, it is necessary to refer back to the last nationwide census which was carried out in 2010. At that stage, it was confirmed that there were 6,724,540 people in the state, and that represented an increase of just over 14% on the numbers declared in 2000.\n\nWashington State Area and Population Density\n\nCurrent estimates now show a population of 7.17 million in the state of Washington, and rapid growth is expected to continue. This population places Washington as the 13th most populous state in the country, but only 25th in terms of population density. Within its total area of 71,299 square miles, there is an average of 101.2 people for every square mile of Washington State territory.\n\nSeattle is the largest city in the state with a population of 684,451, with a density of 7,962 people per square mile. The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area has a population of 3.73 million, however, and encompasses nearby cities like Kent, Tacoma, Bellevue and Everett. It accounts for more than half of the state's population. The most populated counties in Washington State are King and Pierce counties with respective populations of 2,188,649 and 876,764\n\nWashington State Gender and Religion Statistics\n\nThe median age across the state of Washington is 37.6 years of age. In terms of the ratio of females to males, 50.1% of the population is female and 49.9% male.\n\nIn terms of preferred religions among the residents of the state, 61% of the population is affiliated with a Christian based faith, 6% are affiliated with non-Christian faiths, and 32% are not affiliated with any faith in particular.\n\nWashington State Boundary, Census, and Statehood History\n\nAfter a period when Great Britain also claimed it, Washington was definitively acquired in 1846 and was included in Oregon Territory, established in 1848. Washington became a separate territory in 1853, acquired essentially its present boundaries in 1863, and was admitted as a State on November 11, 1889.\n\nThe 1850 population is that of Clark and Lewis Counties, Oregon Territory; census coverage extended only to the southwestern part of present-day Washington. In 1860 census coverage included nearly the whole present State, and some persons in present-day northern Idaho and northwestern Montana.\n\nWashington State Population History\n\nLike many areas in the far western United States, Washington State began life with a very small population and back in 1850, the population was recorded at 1,201. Ten years later, however, that had increased significantly by nearly 900% to 11,594 and it sparked a population explosion within the state to the extent that by the end of the 1800s, the population had grown to 518,103.\n\nThe Census of 1910 revealed that the Washington State population had exceeded one million for the very first time and the pattern throughout the 1900s was one of continued substantial growth.\n\nWashington State Population Growth\n\nGrowth has continuously progressed through the present day where the population of Washington State in 2016 has surpassed 7 million. The overall picture in the state is clearly one of sustained growth and there is really nothing to indicate that this factor will change at all for the foreseeable future.\n\nPopulation Projections for Washington State\n\nLooking at percentage increases for the last few censuses, it is safe to assume that the population of Washington State will be well on its way to another major milestone through 2020, when the population is estimated to surpass 7.5 million.\n\nAccording to current projections, Washington's population will reach 8.9 million by 2040, with migration contributing 59% of this increase, while the remaining 41% will be contributed by natural increases (or the number of births minus the number of deaths). While 14% of Washington's total population is now over the age of 65, this percentage will climb to 21% by 2040, which will have serious impacts on planning and policy-making for the state as a whole."
