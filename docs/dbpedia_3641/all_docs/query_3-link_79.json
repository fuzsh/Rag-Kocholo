        "text": "divisions.(key).alsoKnownAs[] list Any other valid OCD IDs that refer to the same division.\n\nBecause OCD IDs are meant to be human-readable and at least somewhat predictable, there are occasionally several identifiers for a single division. These identifiers are defined to be equivalent to one another, and one is always indicated as the primary identifier. The primary identifier will be returned in ocd_id above, and any other equivalent valid identifiers will be returned in this list.\n\nFor example, if this division's OCD ID is ocd-division/country:us/district:dc, this will contain ocd-division/country:us/state:dc. offices[].levels[] list The levels of government of which this office is part. There may be more than one in cases where a jurisdiction effectively acts at two different levels of government; for example, the mayor of the District of Columbia acts at \"locality\" level, but also effectively at both administrativeArea2 and administrativeArea1.\n\nValid values include:\n\ninternational -- International governments, such as the United Nations or European Union.\n\ncountry -- National-level governments, such as the US Federal Government.\n\nadministrativeArea1 -- Governments of the top-level administrative subdivision of a country, such as US states.\n\nregional -- Regional governments whose jurisdiction may cross standard administrative subdivisions; these are uncommon in the US but are common around large cities in other countries.\n\nadministrativeArea2 -- Governments of the second-level administrative subdivision of a country, such as US counties.\n\nlocality -- City or municipal governments.\n\nsubLocality1 -- Governments of the top-level administrative subdivision of a city, such as Washington, DC's wards.\n\nsubLocality2 -- Governments of the second-level administrative subdivision of a city,such as Washington, DC's Advisory Neighborhood Councils.\n\nspecial -- Local districts that exist only for special-purpose governments, such as soil and water conservation districts."
