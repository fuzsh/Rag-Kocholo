        "text": "Congress has appropriated additional funding for new HUD-VASH vouchers every year since 2008:\n\nEach year, HUD and VA have collaboratively awarded HUD-VASH vouchers based on current geographic need and public housing agency (PHA) performance. Since 2017, the allocation process for awarding HUD-VASH vouchers has changed to allow PHAs to self-identify their interest in the program. HUD publishes an annual HUD-VASH Registration of Interest Notice containing detailed instructions that PHAs must follow if they are interested in receiving a portion of the available HUD-VASH vouchers. PHAs must have the support of a partnering VA facility and meet any utilization threshold requirements to be eligible for an award. After the registration period has closed, HUD and VA use a formula to determine relative need, and ultimately invite eligible PHAs to apply for a specific number of HUD-VASH vouchers. The associated funding awarded for HUD-VASH vouchers is determined by the actual average per unit cost (PUC) at each PHA.\n\nThere is at least one PHA currently administering HUD-VASH in each of the 50 states, in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.\n\nHUD-VASH vouchers are renewed based on actual PHA leasing along with all other housing choice vouchers (HCV). Details of annual renewal funding and potential set-side fund opportunities can be found in the annual HCV Funding Notice."
