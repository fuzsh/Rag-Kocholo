2 - 5 MW Landowner and Community Owned

Solar Farms

Fast Track Community Solar Farm Development and Interconnection

Enterprise, Utah

Community Solar Farms in Enterprise, Utah​ can now be owned by landowners and the local community.

Our 2 – 5 MW Fast Track Landowner and Community Owned Solar Farm Development Program is designed for the community members and landowners of Enterprise, Utah.

Our primary goal is to bring power, profits, and jobs back to the people who live and work in their communities. After carefully analyzing Federal Energy Regulation Committee guidelines, Solarcollab has identified a low-cost, fast-track model to develop, fund, and build 2 – 5 MW solar farms across Washington county, Utah.

Why only only 2 – 5 MW?

Primarily because we can get them constructed and interconnected to the grid in record time, at minimal cost, and with fewer regulatory requirements.

This solar energy investment program is completely unique… a first of its kind, developed by Solarcollab. The program is designed to allow landowners to earn income from leasing their land AND to also participate in the OWNERSHIP of the solar farm.

We apply for rural grants to reduce the total cost of each solar farm and raise the money for each solar project using several Financial Technology models on the Solarcollab Investment Platform. We use blockchain technology to digitalize the community solar farm that allows us to sell shares of the Community Solar Power Plant to members of the local community. This is the first program of its kind designed to redistribute the profits back to the people where each solar project is located by crowdselling shares of ownership for each solar farm.

Frequently Asked Questions

Enterprise, Utah Landowners and Solar Farm Ownership.

A solar land lease is a contract between the property owner and Solarcollab that allows us to build a solar farm on your property in exchange for lease payments to the landowner. Each land lease contract is different, but generally the contract is for 20 years and sometimes there may be an option to extend the term for an additional number of years.

The power generated by the solar farm will be sold to your power grid. This could be a local co-op, large energy company, or individual company.

With the current process involving city planning, permits, and navigating the average 4-year USA interconnection queue bottleneck, the installation of a solar farm can typically take several years. However, our community solar program is designed to be prioritized at the top of the interconnection queue, significantly reducing the timeline. As a result, our solar farms can be installed and operational within six to twelve months. During this time, you’ll be free to continue using your land.

Solarcollab will contract out the operations and maintenace for the solar farm during its life, and will remove all equipment and reclaim your property once the project has ended.

The presence of a solar farm on your property can affect property taxes, but the specifics depend on local tax laws and regulations. Generally, property taxes may increase due to the added value of the solar infrastructure. However, in many areas, there are tax incentives, exemptions, or reductions available for renewable energy projects that can offset these increases.

As for who pays the taxes, it typically depends on the lease agreement between the landowner and the solar farm operator. In most cases, the solar company leasing the land will cover any additional property taxes resulting from the installation of the solar farm. It's important to clearly outline tax responsibilities in the lease agreement to ensure there are no unexpected costs for the landowner.

The amount of land required for a typical solar farm depends on the scale of the project and the desired energy output. On average, it takes about 5-10 acres of land to generate one megawatt (MW) of electricity. For smaller community solar projects, you might need 1-5 acres for a few hundred kilowatts of capacity. Larger utility-scale solar farms can require hundreds of acres to produce multiple megawatts of power.

Factors such as land topography, shading, and local zoning regulations can also impact the land requirements. It's essential to conduct a site assessment to determine the suitability and optimal size for your specific solar farm project.
