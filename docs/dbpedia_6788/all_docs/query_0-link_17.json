His father, Parameshwaran Namboodiri,died when he was a child. He\n\nwas educated in the Victoria High school and Victoria College ; Palakkad, and St.Thomas college, Thrissur.\n\nDuring his college days he was greatly influenced by the speches and writings of Gokhale, Gandhi and Tilak. He participated in the freedom movement launched by\n\nGandhiji in the early 1920's . While he was studying for his Graduation he was arrestedand sentenced to three years imprisonment and later released when\n\nGandhiji withdrew the satyagraha movement.\n\nThe meeting with Kamalnath Tiwari and Sengupta Chakravarthy and Acharya of Anshilan group from West Bengal in the Kannur Central jail was a milestone in\n\nNamboodiripad's life. The seed for the communist party was sown there.\n\nHe was a founder member of the congress socialist party when it was formed at Patna in 1934. he was one of its joint secretaries. The congress became a mass organization in kerala under his leadership. He was also elected as a member of the All India Congress Committee and head of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee.\n\nNamboodiripad got elected to the Madras Assembly on a Congress ticket in 1937.

In 1957 he headed the first democratically elected communist ministry in Kerala, the first of its type in the world. Till then Communists came to power through armed struggle. But his ministry did not last long and was brought down by the congress achanisation. It took Namboodiripad eight turbulent years to return to power.\n\nIn 1967 he again became the Chief Minister by forming a coalition, which included the CPI. The govt. fell in October 1969 when the CPI outsmarted the CPI-M. For the rest of his life CPI was his beatnik.\n\nEven though he ruled only for a short period, EMS laid the foundation for whatever achievement the state made in the socio-economic front. The land reform and education policy he pursued brought revolutionary changes in the state."
