        "text": "Article 164 of the Indian Constitution deals with the appointment of the Chief Minister and other Ministers by the Governor. The Governor is the state's de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the Chief Minister. In simple words, the Chief Minister of an Indian state is the head of the Government.\n\nIn 1947, after India's Independence from the British Raj, the states' monarchs of Travancore and Cochin instituted a representative government, headed by a Prime Minister and his Council of Ministers. On 1 July 1949, Travancore and Cochin were merged to form Travancore-Cochin state. The Malabar District and Kasaragod region of South Canara, together constituting more than half of the present state of Kerala, had their representatives in the Madras Legislative Assembly.\n\nOn 1 November 1956, with the implementation of the States Reorganisation Act, present-day Kerala was created by merging Cochin, Malabar, and Travancore regions, and the Kasaragod region of South Canara. Since then, the state has been ruled by twelve Chief Ministers.\n\nPrime Ministers of Travancore (1948-1949)\n\nS.No. Prime Minister Tenure Party 1. Pattom A.
