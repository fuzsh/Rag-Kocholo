        "text": "Born in 1919, in the Pattanakkad village of Alappuzha, the political journey of Gouri Amma remains distinct even today. She was an integral part of the group of communists who defied adversities to build the party and remained a part of the party’s history for several decades.\n\nThe Kerala government has announced a year-long birthday celebration in the state for Gouri Amma. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, on Friday, inaugurated a centenary conference to celebrate her 100th birthday. In fact, the ongoing session of the Kerala Legislative Assembly did not convene on Friday so that the legislators could be a part of the celebrations.\n\nShe is the longest-serving MLA of the state after KM Mani of the Kerala Congress (M). She contested the Assembly elections 11 times, tasting victory on eight occasions. She was a minister holding an array of portfolios in the various Communist governments in the state - in 1957, 1967, 1980 and 1987.\n\nShe was first elected to the Travancore Council in 1952 and 1954. Gouri Amma also holds the distinction of being the first woman from the Ezhava community to hold a degree in Law.\n\nHolding the plum portfolio of Revenue, Gouri Amma presented the revolutionary Land Reforms Bill in 1957 when the EMS Namboodiripad government came to power. She was the only woman in the first democratically elected Communist government, led by Communist stalwart and Kerala’s first Chief Minister EMS Namboodiripad.\n\nThe Land Reform Ordinance was later made into an Act. It set the ceiling on the amount of land a family could own, paving the way for the landless farmers to claim excess land, which in turn sowed the seeds of destruction of the feudal system.\n\nGouri Amma is the daughter of KA Raman and Parvathy Amma. Although her father helped her get an education, she was attracted to politics because of her elder brother Sukumaran, who was a political activist then.\n\nRaman, who used to take land on lease for cultivation, was particular about educating his daughter and had even supported her as she practised law at a court in Cherthala.\n\n\"After the death of my father, Annan (her brother) would come to my house for lunch. One or two comrades would also come with him for lunch. They used to work with Annan in various trade unions. The Communist party did not have many people from the middle class and upper class who were educated at the time. Hence, Annan had to head several trade unions. Annan would stay back for some time after lunch and would talk about Communist and labour movements,” her autobiography says.\n\nShe also described the time when she had to distribute pamphlets promoting party principles. Since the Communist party was banned then, she had to do this covertly.\n\nGouri Amma was jailed in 1948, the year she joined the Communist party. The party was banned at the time for its 'hostile' stance against the government. She was jailed on a number of other occasions as well for her political activities.\n\n“I first met TV at the Travancore committee meeting held at my house. This was after TV and other leaders were acquitted in the Punnapra Valayar case as there was no evidence against them,” she wrote in the autobiography, adding, “But there were already rumours that TV and I were in love with each other even before the Punnapra-Valayar agitation. Prior to this, I had met him only once at the Maharaja’s college in Ernakulam; but not as TV but as the brother of my friend, Thresyamma.”\n\n“I had taken leave from the party at the time and lived with TV at the house in Chathanad, Alappuzha. We had decided not to let members from both the parties inside our house and that TV could do his party work outside the house. It was like life had become peaceful after a long time. TV gifted me a Kashmiri silk sari. It was the first time he gifted me a sari, which I have treasured even today,” she had later said in an interview.\n\n“In 1967, they left their house in Chathanad, Alappuzha to assume charge as ministers in Thiruvananthapuram. We were allotted separate official residences, which were in the adjacent compounds. We literally destroyed the wall between the two houses and built a door to reach each other’s house. But the CPI shut that door, which came as a huge shock for me. That (door) separated us. I had a heart attack and was in the hospital for a month,” Gouri Amma said.\n\nGouri Amma was touted to be the next Chief Minister during the 1987 Assembly elections, which would have made her the first female CM of Kerala. The Assembly elections were fought with the slogan “Keralanaattil KR Gouri Amma bharikkum” (KR Gouri Amma will rule Kerala). But she was denied the CM post. It’s alleged that the senior leaders of the party sidelined her at the time when the final decision had to be taken.\n\nIn a major twist to her political career, she became part of the United Democratic Front (UDF), the rival group of the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) the same year. This ended her comradeship with the party, which lasted for over 45 years. She even became part of the UDF ministry from 2001 to 2006."
