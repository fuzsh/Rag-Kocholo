Floral tributes were paid to the legendary leader amidst shouting of slogans.\n\nA B Bardhan: Champion of Left Unity\n\nCOMRADE A B Bardhan belonged to that generation of Communist leaders who came into the Communist party during the last decade of the struggle for independence. Bardhan joined the party in 1940 at the age of 15. The student movement during the anti-imperialist struggle and the post-war upsurge of mass struggles in the country shaped the political outlook of the young Bardhan. Like many young Communists in Bombay province at that time, he became an organiser of the working class after his militant role in the student movement.\n\nMuzaffar Ahmad Birth Anniversary\n\nCPI(M) leaders called upon Party workers to strengthen movements to change the existing political situation.

Pandit Nehru represented the mainstream vision for a ‘secular democratic’ India, while the Left vision was for a ‘secular, democratic and socialist’ India. The third was for converting independent India into a rabidly intolerant ‘Hindu Rashtra’. This vision originated with the formation of the RSS in 1925. The Muslim League was a ‘twin brother’ of the RSS.\n\nM B Centenary Meeting in Kolkata\n\nA BARBARIC ruling party like the Trinamool Congress is helping in the growth of another barbaric party BJP in West Bengal, CPI (M) general secretary Prakash Karat has said in Kolkata. The TMC regime, based on corruption and lumpen domination, has helped RSS and its outfits to sow the seeds of communal politics in the state."
