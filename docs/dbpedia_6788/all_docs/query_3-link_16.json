He was a prolific writer, whose insights on Marxist theory, the international communist movement, caste, womenâ€™s struggle, and national liberation, continue to shape theoretical debates and practical activity in our day. This presentation will introduce his life, in its historical and political context.\n\nThis event is co-hosted by 1804 Books, Tricontinental Institute, and LeftWord Books."
