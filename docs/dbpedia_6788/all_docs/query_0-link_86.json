        "text": "This essay looks at two early texts by a Hindu religious figure, Chattampi Svamikal (1853–1924), from Kerala, the southwestern region of India. Kristumatachhedanam (1890) [A Refutation of Christianity] and Pracina Malayalam (1899) [The Ancient Malay-alam Region] draw upon a variety of sources across space and time: the echoes of contemporary debates across India and Empire as much as the detritus of the Enlightenment contest between rationalism and religion in Europe. Does the location of the text in \" colonial India \" exhaust the space-time of its imagination? The essay argues for a porous rather than a hermetic understanding; the \" text \" was a supplement to the actual verbal confrontation on street corners and arguments in ephemeral print. The real question is how can historians write postnational histories of thinking? How should we engage with times other than the putatively regnant homogeneous, empty time of empire or nation? I argue that there is an immanent time in texts (arising from the conventions and protocols of the form, the predilections of the thinker, and imagined affinities with ideas coming from other times and places) that exceeds the historical time of the text. South Asian history after the subaltern studies moment has moved to a writing of the intellectual history of colonial India. Although at one level this represents an attempt to take seriously forms of intellection by indigenous intellectuals, in its form and method it may signify a return to an elite history that privileges elite thought, national identity, and a hermetic understanding of writing and texts over the contextual and miscegenated spaces of the historical imagination. The dichot-omy of writing about elite thought and subaltern action, instituted by subaltern historians, continues. Thinking, as Borges once said, is the normal respiration of the intelligence. I suggest we need to integrate intellectual history, the history of ideas, and social history; destabilize the idea of a text through emphasizing the circular relation between texts and the oral contexts of public debate and intel-lection; and stress the necessarily transnational space of intellection. To argue for the putative \" integrity \" of a text or of an author's thought does not reflect sufficiently on the fact that texts are constructed in an imagined dialogue with a constituency of auditors as much as readers. This is so particularly in the largely illiterate but information-rich context of colonial Indian society. As Karin Barber puts it evocatively: how can we engage with addressing \" an imagined world and an imagined public that is simultaneously very local, and of\n\nThis chapter explores the relation between colonialism, Malayali reform movements and the transformations occurred in the domestic shpere and in middle-class trajectories of mobility more broadly. It discusses specifically the historical context in which the ‘Yoka Kshema Sabha’ (YKS) developed to voice reformist ambitions of young Nambudiris. The YKS ethos will be discussed in relation to colonial de-legitimation of indigenous kinship and to the broader history of kinship reform that marked middle-classes in Kerala and India. Analysis of the YKS documents will highlight how the debate on kinship expressed the intention to draw a ‘divine elite’ into the arena of inter-community competition. Differently from other contexts of colonial India, ‘the domestic’ was not identified as the inviolable domain of Indian authenticity but as the symbol of community corruption and generational decline. The chapter will suggest how the YKS remained an ‘elitist movement within the elite’, and failed to gather the support of Brahmins from different sub-castes. The second part of the chapter will connect the analysis of colonial family changes to the one of postcolonial developments such as land reforms, family planning and mass emigration. This will introduce the reader to the final part of the chapter which discusses changes in material practices and entitlements of kinship that occurred due to the YKS and to subsequent reforms. In tracing collective trajectories of revolution, decline and renewed social mobility this chapter sets the context for the analysis of the political implication of contemporary memories.\n\nThis paper attempts to study the formation of a dalit community and identity in Kerala. Recent years have seen a spurt of dalit writings in Malayalam literature. Our interest in these writings arose with the publication of several writings in Malayalam periodicals. These writings advocated the existence of a dalit identity and community in Kerala. Here we approach this debate through a study of identity politics and community formation and in the emerging \" dalit literature \" of Kerala. We discuss the relationship of dalit identity formation, politicization in their representation in literature and my focus is on dalit and adivasi debates in Kerala. The debate on the dalit of Kerala has an important relationship with discussion on the Maharashtra dalit literature. We outline the debates on dalits and dalit writings in Kerala. Issues like identity formation, community formation and other issues have been taken for study. In his pioneering work, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, Benedict Anderson defined a nation as \"an imagined political community [that is] imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign\". 1 An imagined community is different from an actual community, because it is not (and cannot be) based on ordinary face-to-face interaction between its members. Instead, members hold in their minds a mental image of their likeness. A nation is an imagined community, Anderson says, because regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may succeed in each, the nation is always imagined as a deep, parallel comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings 2. In this chapter I see how the neo-dalit writers read the story on their own past to create a common identity which hides the differences within lower caste and class communities. We show that through a reinterpretation of history, these writers create an imagined dalit community in Kerala.\n\nThis article explores inter-caste/religious (ICR) marriages in Kerala (South India) and focuses on the meanings and experiences of biological kinship when the latter is devoid of its expected emotional and relational substance, to become a 'public fiction'. With this expression, I refer to kinship relations accepted in the public sphere, but which lack foundations in the everyday realm of relatedness. ICR marriages hold an important socio-political role in Kerala as symbols of the State's development, and family ostracism is scrutinised as a form of backward communalism. However, relatives are not always willing to build affective relations. This makes ICR families managing situations where public kinship tolerance co-exists with the negation of its real emotional and intimate possibilities. The article maps how the reality of ICR marriages is turned into a fiction by persisting unspoken norms. It suggests the importance of linked discussions on fiction/ reality in the domestic sphere to the public/political role that kinship and families hold in modern postcolonial societies.\n\nInterrogating the cultural roots of contemporary Malayali middle classes, especially the upper caste Nambudiri community, The Fall of Gods is based on a decade-long ethnography and historico-sociological analyses of the interconnections between colonial history, family memories, and class mobility in twentieth-century south India and in the diaspora. It traces the transformation of normative structures of kinship networks as the community moves from colonial to neo-liberal modernity across generations. The author demonstrates how past family experiences of class and geographical mobility (or immobility) are retrieved and reshaped in the present as alternative ways of conceiving kinship, transforming the idea of collective suffering and sacrifice, and strengthening the felt necessity of territorial, caste, and religious mingling. Rich in anthropological detail and incisive analyses, the book makes original contributions to the understanding of connection between gendered family relations and class mobility, and foregrounds the complex linkages between political history, memory, and the ‘private’ domain of kinship relations in the making of India’s middle classes."
