        "text": "A crucial meeting was being held at room number 43 of Hotel Maruti in Ernakulam, Kerala, immediately after the Assembly elections of 1965. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) had won 40 seats, the Kerala Congress State Committee (KC) had won 23 seats and the Indian National Congress (INC) had won 36 seats.\n\nThere were only 3 people in the room – CPM leader EMS Namboodiripad, Kerala Congress leader KM George and Surendra Mohan, leader of the Samyukta Socialist Party (SSP). The SSP had won 13 seats and these three parties together made up 76 seats of the 133-strong Kerala Assembly, enough to form government.\n\nWho would be the Chief Minister, was the question. Veteran leader Namboodiripad, or EMS as he was better known, agreed to KM George’s candidature to the post but with two conditions – he had to make an open declaration against the arrest of CPM members and their branding as anti-nationals by the Jawaharlal Nehru government which toppled the Left government in 1959, imposing President’s Rule and forcing elections on the state. The second condition was that the state Assembly would pass a resolution against the arrest of CPM leaders in its very first meeting.\n\nKM George dithered. Having been witness to the crackdown on the only non-Congress state government in the country by the powerful INC at the Centre, he did not want to openly defy them. He asked EMS to soften his stance. With that, the possibility of forming the government ceased to exist.\n\nThis, in effect, say political analysts characterises the legend that is EMS – a visionary, firebrand Communist leader who put party and ideology uncompromisingly above all else.\n\nElamkulam Manakkal Sankaran Namboodiripad, the legendary Communist leader, was not a mere politician. He belonged to a highly orthodox family of aristocratic Brahmins. A radical, even in his teens, he joined campaigns for inter-caste marriage, widow remarriage and the eradication of untouchability.\n\nEMS and the Communist party are synonymous in the minds of many. Though he is now remembered as a colossus among Communists, his political life started in the Indian National Congress as he joined the freedom movement, spending a year in prison after the civil disobedience movement. At the age of 27, he became the Secretary of the Malabar Congress Committee. Disillusionment set in when the Congress supported its British rulers during the Second World War and he threw in his lot with the Communist party.\n\nPost Independence, the Communist party was outlawed and EMS was forced underground for three years, with a prize of Rs 1000 on his head, not a small sum in those days.\n\nIs EMS Relevant Today?\n\nAs a temporary and opportunistic peace is brokered between the two warring factions of the Kerala CPM just ahead of a crucial election in May this year, EMS is remembered wistfully by the younger idealistic Communist party hopefuls.\n\n“If only he were alive now, EMS could have handled the complex political problems faced by the party with ease,” stated M Swaraj, State Secretary of the DYFI (Democratic Youth Federation of India, a students’ union). “EMS not only had a great understanding of ideology but was loyal above all else to the party. The current crop of leaders who behave as if they are greater than the party should learn from his disciplined working style. The party to date, has not been able to fill the vacuum created by his death,” he said.\n\nPractised hands at the roiling and often violent intra-party power struggle within the CPM, like Thomas Isaac, admit that EMS is a fond memory of a bygone era, remembered but not followed.\n\nA Reformer\n\nThe younger breed of politicians feel keenly a vacuum in ideology, with leaders rarely sticking to or speaking of core beliefs. They continue to turn to the textbook called EMS, a leader who, they say, was unafraid to take a stand contrary to electoral compulsions.\n\n“During the Iran-Iraq war he openly declared his position stating – ‘We are with Saddam, who are you with?’” said JKC Thomas, state president of the SFI (Students’ Federation of India, a students’ union). “He had also publicly declared his stand on the need for reforms in Sharia laws, despite opposition from the Muslim community,” he said. EMS had also famously derided Mahatma Gandhi as a “Hindu fundamentalist”.\n\nAs a fractious Left party – still boiling with bitter personality clashes – heads reluctantly into polls, the distaste of having been a weak Opposition in the past five years is showing. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sniffing blood, is circling in for the kill, tying up with the influential SNDP (Sri Narayana Dharma Paripalana Movement), a prominent voice for the majority Ezhava (OBC) caste in the state, the traditional votebank of the Left parties. The ruling Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) hopes to brazen out corruption charges in the polls with popular welfare schemes introduced by the government.\n\nIt is at this crucial juncture that the very frank and no-nonsense EMS is missed the most.\n\n(The writer is a journalist based in Ernakulam, Kerala)\n\nAlso read:\n\nUDF Confident of Facing Assembly Elections, Says Oommen Chandy\n\nFour Big Takeaways from Kerala Civic Poll Results"
