        "text": "Freedom fighter and social reformer; Communist and anti-imperialist leader; Marxist theoretician, social and political historian; radical thinker and public intellectual; journalist and columnist; master polemicist, political tactician and party strategist; party worker, organiser, mass leader and chief minister—Elamkulam Manakkal Sankaran Namboodiripad (1909-1998) popularly known by the moniker ‘E.M.S.’, wore many hats in the course of his long and eventful life. While there will necessarily be differences and disagreements about his politics, even his harshest critics will concede to E.M.S. the credit for nurturing and institutionalising parliamentary communism in modern India.\n\nTo understand E.M.S. Namboodiripad’s contribution and role, we must examine his life against the historical and political background of especially his home state, Kerala. His public involvement and experience undoubtedly contributed to both the formation of his personality and his progressive social and political outlook.\n\nadvertisement\n\nE.M.S. first joined public life through the Yogaskshema Sabha, a caste-based organisation committed to bringing about reforms within the Namboodiri community. Soon influenced by Gandhian leadership, he joined the Congress struggle for national independence. Disillusioned with both Gandhian methods and pace to achieve freedom and social transformation, like many of his contemporaries, he slid towards the Congress Socialist Party. He was one of the founding members of the All India Kisan Sabha and played a key role in the peasant movement in Malabar.\n\nIn the late ‘30s, he formally moved to the Communist Party of India. There is a consensus among scholars of the Communist movement in India that within the party, E.M.S. was respected for his theoretical understanding, organisational experience and his commitment to the cause of the people. His centrist position during the inner-party tussle allowed the left wing more traction, and when the party split in 1964, he moved to the CPI(M) (Communist Party of India-Marxist).\n\nIt was this active engagement in the social reform movement of his community, the freedom struggle, the peasant movement, the internal politics of the party and later, the government, that gave him an exceptional vantage position to explore the central interface between theory and practice from both sides.\n\nTo appreciate E.M.S., one must recognise the twin challenges he grappled with, for which there is probably no historical parallel. First, to shepherd and anchor a party with a revolutionary agenda and proclivity for violent methods as well as sabotage in a democratic institutional space. Second, to extend and expand democracy under inhospitable conditions in a poor, backward, feudal, agrarian society with an abysmally low level of industrialisation. Moreover, all this was taking place under highly uncertain circumstances, with his party making quick changes, quite unsure of how to move forward.\n\nThe failure of the Telangana line of insurrection highlighted the inadequacies of revolutionary Marxism as a vehicle for social and economic transformation. In this context, the challenge for E.M.S. was not to appear to be going against the established theoretical vision, which suggested that representative institutions should be discredited from within, so as to diminish the masses’ faith in reformist policies. At the same time, he was alive to the charges of compromise and collaboration and conscious of the limitations of the parliamentary line. E.M.S. wisely chose the Aristotelian middle path; instead of attempting to wreck parliamentary institutions from within, he attempted to try and transform the government, by making and implementing policies that could bring about a social and economic transformation. As many perceptive observers have noted, it was the leadership of E.M.S. that allowed the Communist Party to learn how to operate within a diverse and fragmented society; exploit the institutions of representative government—both in the government and the opposition spaces—to offer respite to the problems of the people. As leader of the first elected communist government in Kerala, E.M.S. demonstrated how parliamentary procedures could be used to draw attention to the concerns of the people and thus strengthen the party’s support base. The party came to power promising a host of socio-economic legislation and policies that could curb discrimination, political patronage, wastefulness and potentially ameliorate the conditions of the poor. This included far-reaching agrarian, educational and administrative reforms, changing the role of the police in labour, property, and political disputes and introducing constructive labour policies. The government and party stood firm on their commitment to radical transformation in the teeth of fierce opposition of the so-called liberationists during the period 1957-59. Despite the fact that his government began drafting the agrarian relations bill immediately after it came to power, the third reading took place only a couple of days before its dismissal. The long-drawn-out process helped highlight the dogged commitment of the party and government to the cause of the people. The same holds good for the educational reforms bill. His government held steadfast, refusing to negotiate with its challengers and preferred to go out a martyr rather than compromise its position. Though short-lived, the E.M.S.-led government opened a new space for parliamentary communist parties showing how legislative politics could become the foundation for mass politics. It was E.M.S. who ensured that the party did not become an anti-system party. The CPI(M) included the tactic of participation in state governments in its party programme only at his insistence.\n\nThis acceptance of representative democracy by E.M.S. should not be surprising since he was essentially an autodidact. His socialist linkages came from the interaction with freedom fighters from different parts of the country when in jail. The exposure and learning of the principles of Marxism, therefore, came late in life when he was already in the thick of political action. It was his immersion in the politics of the day that made him alive to the existing societal conditions, gave him the depth, sharpened his analytical tools and also underlined the value of thinking on one’s feet. He therefore quickly moved away from the dogmatic positions recognising that the changing historical and societal conditions required continual revision of theoretical positions.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWithout directly criticising the central tenets of Marxism, he set aside certain ideas when he found them inadaptable to the conditions that prevailed in Kerala. For instance, the parliamentary line was recognition of the inadequacies of the dominant methods of transition to a democratic, classless society. Similarly, while the dominant strategy spoke of a united front of classes, the Communist Party in Kerala experimented with a united front of parties. This united front of parties’ strategy not only anticipated a multi-party system but more importantly recognised that parties could form around distinctive identities. The representative breadth and depth of the first ministry in terms of region, community, as well as different units of the party, put in place an unwritten consociational practice that continues to be used in Kerala even today. These modifications he believed were necessary to solve the immediate problems of the people and also help the party expand its support.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAt the same time, he also used theoretical insights from Marxism to understand and interpret contemporary issues and events. His dissent note to the report of the Malabar Tenancy Enquiry Committee in 1939is an exemplary illustration of the use of the Marxist framework to comprehend agrarian relations. Similarly, in Keralam: Malayalikalude Mathrubhumi (Kerala: The Motherland of Malayalis) published in 1948, he used the Marxist method of historical materialism to make a case for a linguistically united Kerala. The Aikya Keralam movement which sought to bring together the Malayalam speaking territories drew from his ideas. In this same work, he also did not shy away from engaging with the then rising Dravidian movement and its Aryan invasion thesis. He suggested that regional cultures were more likely to be formed by a synthesis between different cultures rather invasion and displacement alone.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSimilarly, in The Mahatma and The Ism, published in 1958, he presented a sophisticated critique of the role of Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom movement. Going beyond the binary of hagiography and vilification, EMS argued that while the Gandhian movement and its methods were prisoners of the dominant class interests of the time, Gandhi himself identified with the masses and their aspirations. Finally, the now famous ‘Kerala model’ of development was also in many ways inspired by the philosophical and political direction of his writings and practice.\n\nWhile anniversaries and milestones are moments of celebration, they also serve as useful markers to assess and take stock of events. While we credit E.M.S. with institutionalising parliamentary communism in India, it is an opportune moment to ask what ails his party. The party has without a doubt failed to respond to the wide-ranging social and economic changes that have taken place since the inauguration of the post-Congress polity. It has refused to engage with contemporary theoretical debates and at the same time not come out with new formulations of its own suitable to current requirements. It is here the party misses E.M.S. He continually engaged with both issues of the day and with contemporary social and political thought, which helped him fine-tune his political strategy. Alas, they do not make them like him anymore.\n\nK.K. Kailash is with the Department of Political Science, University of Hyderabad."
