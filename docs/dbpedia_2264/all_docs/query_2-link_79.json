        "text": "Asserting that the University of Rochester was committed to unbiased scrutiny of applicants for enrollment, the school's president said yesterday that he planned to meet with officials of the Eastman Kodak Company to discuss a ''very troubling'' incident involving the company and the university.\n\nLast week, the university's business school confirmed reports that it had rescinded the enrollment of an employee of Fuji Photo Film Inc. of Tokyo, a business rival of Kodak. The Rochester-based company had expressed concern that some of its managers would share classes with the Fuji employee.\n\nAddressing the intrusion of corporate competition into university life, Dennis O'Brien, the university's president, said the school remained ''an open institution - open not only to all races, faiths and ideological persuasions, but to business rivals.''\n\nMr. O'Brien said the decision, although ''very troubling,'' was ''so very peculiar to Kodak, the university, and the business school that I don't think it's a national issue, nor is it likely to happen again.''\n\nThe ''extraordinary case,'' he said sprang from the university's ''special relation'' to Kodak.\n\nMr. O'Brien's comments followed a report last week that the William E. Simon School of Business had reversed its acceptance of the Fuji employee after Kodak officials pointed out that he worked in the new products imaging division. Fuji and Kodak are fierce rivals.\n\nThe business school arranged for the Fuji employee to be admitted to the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
