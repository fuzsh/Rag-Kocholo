In order to free these measurements as far as possible from uncertainties in atmospheric transmission it has seemed desirable to attempt them from high-altitude sounding-balloons working well into the stratosphere. At present we are using filters to isolate a wave-length region slightly longer than the Hartley band of ozone, so that there are no uncertainties in atmospheric transmissions due to fluctuation either in the amount or vertical distribution of the ozone.In connection with this program we have completed a subsidiary development which is of interest in upper-air exploration with sounding-balloons. The development involves a procedure and instruments for the continuous triangulation upon a balloon while in flight, and the transmission of the balloon's position to a pick-up car, or cars, in the field, in order to expedite the recovery of valuable apparatus. The development is not completed in all respects, but that part pertaining to the continuous triangulation and plotting during the balloon's flight is complete, and has been through successful field-tests. In principle it is, of course, very simple. In detail, however, it has required the development of two unusual balloon-theodolites of great telescopic power, and a mechanical plotting-instrument of accuracy comparable to the theodolites to permit minute-to-minute determination of the coordinates of the balloon in space. The scheme has proved workable, even with very small sounding-balloons, up to distances of 100 km or more and provides a powerful tool for this class of work.",
