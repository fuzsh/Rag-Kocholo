        "text": "Khue Nguyen’23 (Psychology and Chemistry)\n\nHi, I’m Khue, but my friends call me Katie. I am a double major in Psychology and Chemistry and I’m hoping to become a mental health professional. The friendships I’ve made here have helped me grow into the person I am today. I can’t wait to bring everything I’ve learned back home to my people in Vietnam. I love how Roberts encourages both social and natural sciences. My Track and Field teammates are my support system and I value being a part of something greater than myself.”\n\nRead more to hear what I’ve learned in both majors!\n\nBrian Ellis’22 (Adolescence and Special Education, M.Ed)\n\n“Thanks to my graduate degree, I can finally chase my dreams of becoming a teacher. My education at Roberts has been absolutely phenomenal. As a “career changer” who is leaving behind over a decade of retail leadership, chasing my passion for education has been my dream for many years. I couldn’t have done it without the support and wealth of knowledge from my professors at Roberts.”\n\nRead more to learn what was my favorite class!\n\nMykenzie Burnett’24 (Education)\n\nI’m Mykenzie and I’ve never been more excited about my academics and athletics at Roberts. I would not trade it for the world and I am so grateful to be a part of the bowling team. Being on such a close-knit team is exactly what I was looking for in college. I love that the Roberts community knows my name and that I am not just a number. As a student in Education, I enjoy being around people who are passionate about the same things as me, like teaching and having a positive impact on children. I’ve already learned how to create lesson plans for my future career!\n\nRead my story of my favorite memory on campus!\n\nAutumn Dillow’23 (Biology)\n\n“I feel that I have a better sense of who I am and who I want to be, thanks to my time at Roberts.\n\n“Over the past four years, I have been able to cultivate meaningful relationships with my peers and my professors which has deeply impacted my passion for learning and becoming a Physician’s Assistant.”\n\nRead more to learn what I love most about studying biology!\n\nKhual Mung’23 (Ministry)\n\n“I am here to serve the Lord. Roberts helped me learn about Jesus and how to be a better ministry worker! I’ve joined the worship team and I now mentor young people in my community. Being a student here has strengthened my faith in Christ.”\n\nClick here to listen to me sing!\n\nLily Sluk’22, ‘24 (Childhood and Special Education, Literacy\n\n“One thing I love about Roberts undergrad program is how incredibly practical the courses are. Almost every class gave me hands-on experience practicing the concepts I was learning about. [In my classroom,] I consistently lean on what I learned at Roberts. I love that the program is fully online and I’m loving it so far.”\n\nRead more to learn the most helpful thing I’ve learned here!\n\nSamuel Carducci’22 (Homeland Security and Applied Intelligence)\n\n“Roberts showed me what it’s really like to work in this field. [All of my professors have] been in the field before… they give us opportunities such as to practice using software we’d actually use in our careers.”\n\nRead my story to find out about my two exciting projects!"
