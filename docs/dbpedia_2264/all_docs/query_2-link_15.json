        "text": "Rochester came up just short in its bid to upend Washington University in St. Louis as the Bears held on for a 16-14 win.\n\nThe Yellowjackets fought back from a 16-7 deficit, pulled within two points, and recovered an onside kick with less than 1:40 to play in a thrilling battle in less than favorable conditions in St. Louis.\n\nSophomore QB Aaron Molisani drove Rochester 73 yards in a dozen plays after Washington took that 16-7 lead. Starting at his own 26, he missed two passes, then hit a wide open Brian Ferris at midfield. Ferris evaded tacklers and weaved his way down to the 18, but a penalty flag was thrown at the Bear 40.\n\nThe Yellowjackets were penalized for a block in the back at the 40 and the ball was moved back to midfield. Molisani found Pat O'Brien for six yards in the right flat. His deep pass to Pat Manuel at the goalline was incomplete. On third down, he found Patrick Roman for nine yards, moving the ball to the Bear 35 with 3:10 left in the game.\n\nHis first down pass was nearly picked off. Molisani scrambled for 10 yards and a first down at the 25 (2:47 left), then gained eight more down to the 17 with 2:20 left.\n\nHe went back to Ferris and the senior managed to catch the ball and get out of bounds at the Bear 3 with 2:15 remaining. O'Brien rammed into the center of the line and got within 18 inches of paydirt. On second and goal, he plowed through for a score, pulling Rochester within 16-13 with 1:47 left.\n\nChris Johnston's PAT was good, but the Yellowjackets were penalized five yards for illegal procedure. The ball moved back to the seven and Johnston nailed it again. It was 16-14 with 1:42 remaining.\n\nJohnston played another big role. On the ensuing kickoff, he hit a pooch-kick to midfield and Ferris covered it there, giving Rochester the chance it needed with 1:39 to play.\n\nMolisani scrambled under pressure down to the Washington 33 with 1:29 left. The Bears turned up the heat - blitzing on three straight plays - and Molisani couldn't connect on his first three passes.\n\nThe Yellowjackets went for it on 4th and 10 with 1:14 left. Manuel broke free from his defender but Molisani's pass to him was just out of reach.\n\nWashington took over and was able to run out the clock to earn the win.\n\nO'Brien's two-yard TD run in the first quarter gave the Yellowjackets a 7-0 lead. Washington blocked a Yellowjacket punt and eventually punched in the tying touchdown. The Bears kicked a field goal in the third period for a 10-7 lead and took the 16-7 edge with 4:35 left. The extra point after the final WU touchdown was blocked by Sam Snowden.\n\nRochester's defense did a sound job against Washington. The Yellowjackets produced three turnovers, including a takeaway on Washington's first two possessions of the game.\n\nThe Yellowjackets outgained the Bears, 296-281."
