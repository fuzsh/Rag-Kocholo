FRIDAY, DECEM BER 9, 1077 15c SIMOLE COPY 85c PER WEEK DELIVERED Son Evicts Parents Out Of ‘Their’ Home SEATTLE (UPI) When Tom Rhodes and his wife were evicted, the only possessions they left behind in their $50,000 house were photographs of their son taped across the fireplace mantel. It was their son, police Sgt. T J. Rhodes Jr.. w ho obtained the court order for their eviction. “Now he is just Sgt. T J Rhodes,” said Mrs. Rhodes, 58, who wept softlv as a neighbor placed Rhodes Sr., 60, who had vowed he would have to be carried out of the house, gave way to the persuasive talk of Robert Lindquist, chief of the civil division of the King County police, and walked out peacefully At the bottom of the stairs, Rhodes paused to remove an American flag. “That stands for justice,” he said bitterly. His son has steadfastly refused to respond to questions about the eviction. His only public comm ents are in the cold legal language of court records. “ He has not talked to me in four years,” the father said “ He will talk to his mother but not to m e.” The couple said their home was placed in their son's name to protect it from the financial trouble the elder Rhodes had years ago Mon­ thly payments and taxes were paid by the father to the son. who forwarded them to the bank, the father said Later, w hen their son and his wife separated for 18 months, there was concern about who, legally, would own the home, Rhodes said, but those difficulties apparently were resolved. Then the younger Rhodes went to court to claim ownership of the house, saying he had rented it to his parents since 1968. In September, a judge ruled the son was the owner because all the legal papers for the house were in his name The parents went back to court to fight the eviction notice, but won nothing more than an extra 30 days to live in the house. “I still think this is my house,\" Rhodes Sr. said as he left it. Making Ends Meet ★ * * * * County Officeholders, Commissioners Argue Over Budget Priorities By ANDRE SHASIIATY (First in a series) LISBON — As the end of the budget year approaches and Columbiana County officials begin to think about the 1978 budget, the county’s financial status is becoming an import­ ant issue once again. County finances were the center of controversy in the months during the introduction of a “ piggyback” sales tax and vehicle use tax and their over­ whelming defeat at the Nov. 8 general election. Without the revenue which would have come from the piggyback taxes — $800,000 a year by one estimate — the co m m issio n e rs have been forced into a financial juggling act to meet expenses for the rest of 1977 and there is general agreement that the 1978 budget will be tight. On Dec. 1 the countv commis- Plan Is Drafted To Bail Out WASHINGTON (UPI) Two key m em bers of the House and Senate have drafted a compro­ mise plan to bail out the Social Security program, and today they were trying to sell it to other mem bers of Congress. Indications arc they w ill have an uphill fight. Sen. R ussell Long. D-La., chairman of the Senate Finance C o m m itte e , an d Rep. A1 Ullman, D-Ore., chairm an of the House Ways and Means Committee, worked out the proposal in recen t p riv a te talks. House and Senate negotiators try in g to settle d iffere n ce s between separate bills recently passed by the House and Senate were meeting today to consider it and other proposals. Ullman and Long have not yet announced their plan, but its main thrust was said to be: Each house would give up a n u m b er of costly special benefits, such as a Senate proposal to increase disability payments for the blind and a House proposal to repeal the provision that causes some elderly persons to lose Social Security benefits when they marry. Savings Iron» those and other cuts would be used to reduce tax increases over the next d e ca d e below levels proposed in either pending bill. A compromise would be struck between differing House and Senate formulas for allow­ ing elderly persons to earn more in wages without losing benefits. The Senate would give up its plan to tax employers more than employees, following the House philosophy of taxing them equally as has been the Turn To PLAN Page 8 Train Involved In 2 Mishaps 28th Road Death Recorded In Crash Near Liverpool LISBON — A 57-year old East Liverpool man became the 28th traffic victim of the year at 4 :25 p.m. Thursday in an accident on old Route 30 near Cannons Mill The death of Paul H. V’ill nave, of 812 Dresden Ave., E ast Liverpool, brought the county’s highway toll to 28 for the year compared to 22 for all of last year. The State Highway Patrol said the accident involving V illn av e’s northbound 1975 Chevrolet Nova two-door and the southbound 1966 four-door of Sheila M Harpold, 21, of East Liverpool, remains under investigation Officers said the cars collided almost head-on seven-tenths of a mile south of Route 7 and one- filth of a mile north of the Cal­ cutta-Smiths Ferry Road The road was snow-covered and Violence Continues In Utah Coalfields United P ress International The mood was described as ugly in the Utah coalfields Thursday following three days of violence, and striking miners exchanged shots with m anage­ ment personnel at an Ohio mine, while the attention of miners in the heavily unionized Appalachian coalfields turned to critical” health care needs A wooden bridge to the Plateau mine near Price, I tah, was burned by United Mine Workers pickets before dawn Thursday, leaving 50 miners stranded. Some 400 pickets were diverted 25 miles away to the Soldier Creek mine when deputies circulated y.ord that non-striking m in ers w ere changing shifts The shift change was a red herring, and bulldozers out a temporary road to the Plateau mine while pickets waited at Soldier Creek Police said the road to the Plateau looked like a battleground, with 500-pound boulders rolled onto the pave­ m ent and four-inch spikes driven into the < oncrete \"You couldn’t drive a tank up •hat road, one deput ^ s a i d ¿Lottery Winners) Winning nu m b ers in this week's Ohio lottery are Gold 3: White 92 Blue 962, and Extra Cash 928216 UMW pickets reportedly were arm ed with guns, blasting caps and dynamite. Striking miners and supervi­ sory personnel at the Southern Ohio Coal Co. in Meigs County exchanged shots Thursday in the first outbreak of violence in Ohio since miners across the nation walked out at 12:01 a m Tuesday. Meigs County Deputy sheriff Gary Wolfe said no one was hit by the gunfire, which occurred as the second shiit attempted to enter the coal company office. Wolfe said deputies were on the ‘-cene most of Thursday. In West V irg in ia ’s coal hollows, frozen by record- setting cold, the thoughts of striking miners turned to their homes and families Picketing was minimal, as most of the state’s non-UMW n mes shut down at the beginning of the strike out of fear of reprisals ‘T h e re ’s just nobody going to work in this a rea ,” said an official at an independent West Virginia mine “Nobody’s going to lake the chance.

Now no more a p ­ propriations can be made to meet remaining 1977 expenses unless the county budget com­ mission comes up with addi­ tional money when the county’s incom e is calcu la te d this month. Opponents of the piggyback tax measures, including Board of Commissioners President John Ursu, argue that services can be maintained and the gov­ ernment can be run more ef­ ficiently without the additional tax income. “As long as you’ve got piles of money,” Ursu has said, “There isn’t going to be any efficiency at all ” Cutbacks Eyed Other county officeholders anticipate cutbacks in the next year, and several county offices are having trouble making ends meet for the rest of this year There also, is disagreement among elected officials over budget priorities. Several of­ ficials have said the commis sioners cut too much off their original budget req u ests, forcing them to request more funds to finish the year The commissioners, on the other hand, have indicated some d e p a rtm e n t h ead s w ere requesting too much money But the county’s financial problems didn’t happen only recently.

But Miller did not attend a negotiating session called by chief federal mediator Wayne Horvitz Thursday. Another ses­ sion was scheduled today The union chief was present at the Capital Hilton Hotel Thursday at the time set for the session in mid afternoon. But when coal operators failed to show up and a one-hour delay was announced. Miller left the hotel and did not return As he left, M ille r told reporters the financial status of the union's health care fund “is the biggest problem as far as we are concerned ” “There are people who try to distort the facts and say that is not the real issue,\" Miller said ‘That is the real issue,\" Just before the strike was calk'd at midnight Monday, Miller advised the union mem­ bership that health benefits would he cut off at the same time a strike occurred The u nion's health and pension programs are nearly bankrupt due to m ism anagem ent of funds in the past and unauthorized “ w ildcat” strikes, which cut coal production Negotiators for the union and Bituminous Coal Operators ot America met for just over an hour Thursday, exchanged proposals, and then recessed Horvitz said “the parties have exchanged some ideas and proposals.** “ Each side wants some time,” to consider those propo­ sals.

The Queen City is a city without bus service. Some 770 drivers and me­ chanics for the Queen City Metro transit system continued their wildcat walkout for a second day today, shutting down the system’s operations and leaving som e 130,000 Cincinnatians without bus ser vice. But Metro officials gave some indication they would seek a court injunction today ordering the strikers back to work Metro General Manager Ed Harvey said late Thursday he did not attempt to get an in­ junction on the first day of the walkout in order to give union leadership time to meet and discuss the situation with their membership The drivers and mechanics are members of the Am al­ gam ated Transit W orkers Union, Local 627. The union and management held no bargain­ ing talks Thursday. Negotia tions have stalled in disputes over proposed wage increases and demands for improved medical insurance coverage. “We have not sought a court injunction yet because the problems that exist are wildcat in nature,” Harvey said. “To that extent we re allowing the union some time and an op­ portunity to solve their own problems before we get into it .” With snow, sleet and freezing rain falling on the Cincinnati area, transportation problems caused by the strike became more difficult. Cincinnati Public School officials reported attendance w>as off 60 percent Thursday. Retail merchants, especially those downtown, said business was down con­ siderably from regular, pre- Christmas shopping days. As resident! struggled through the transit strike’s first day, Harvey expressed frustra­ tion with the walkout, which was not sanctioned by union leadership “It’san unfortunate situation that we have, but there is virtually no one to talk to whoT can assure us the stoppage will end.” Laundry Ignites At Area Trailer Firemen from the Winona- Butler department were on the scene for about 45 minutes after a spark from a malfunctioning drier ignited laundry at a trailer owned by John Hoien at 2449 Woodsdale Rond Thursday morning M rs Hoien had taken clothing from the drier and laid • it on a bed when she noticed it was smoldering, according to Fire Chief Robert Walton She ran next door to the home of Russ .lanofa, who called fire­ fighters at 9:45 a.m. Janofa returned to the trailer with M rs Hoien and carried the laundry outside, w here firemen extinguished the blaze.

In fact the taxes you save could be as much as two additional exemptions every year! It can happen either one of two ways: (1) our Individual Retirement Account, or (2) our Keogh Plan. With either plan, you do not pay a penny in taxes on the amount of your income set aside for retirement until you retire, when your tax bracket will probably be much lower.

Survival And New Values By JACQ l ESCOUSTEAU Twenty years ago I wanted to foeus my at­ tention permanently on the oceans. I was naively convinced that the oceans were teeming with life, rich in resources of all sorts. During long crossings on the Indian Ocean or the Atlantic, I spent many hours day and night looking through the Calypso's underwater observation chamber dreaming of Captain Nemo in the Nautilus But soon I had to face the evidence: the blue waters of the open ocean were mostly desert. Dike the deserts on land, they were alive. But the live ingredient, plankton, like haze, was barely visible and very thinly spread Then occasionally the sea churned into a feast at night Close to shore, around reefs and wrecks, fish would gather in spectacular displays of beauty Years of diving revealed the same situation at the ocean bottom, where en­ dless deserts are spotted with rare but exuberant oa ses Discovering these oases was my first step towards understanding that the ocean is in fact a very small world. Resources are at least as limited as those on the dry land; the ocean is extremely fragile and at our mercy. From the sea, I learned too of the fragility of man, especially in the face of catastrophe Constant changes, slow or abrupt, are likely to counter or destroy human projects when men are too proud to admit the probability of these changes. The overconfidence of technocrats was demonstrated to me once more last year when I was diving at the wreck of the S.S Britannic, sister of the Titanic. She was sunk as a hospital ship by the Germans in 1916 in the Aegean Sea. You remember the Titanic was built to be the largest and the safest ship afloat, It was declared unsinkable by its builders It went down during its first crossing T IIE BRITANNIC was then under construc­ tion and, after the Titanic disaster, it was modified to be even more unsinkable. Yet she sank in the first year of her operation How can we believe what we are told, that the nuclear enterprise, military or peaceful, could safely survive wars, revolutions, natural catas trophes, when the by-products are lethal for millions of years? When drums containing nuclear wastes are dumped in the sea with the blessing of governments, and already are gaping open, releasing their eternal poison in the ocean? When more than 200 tons of uranium have vanished during a ship transfer? When more than 2,000 pounds of enriched nuclear uranium and plutonium cannot be accounted for in the United States alone? Ocean life has been assaulted by catastrophies of still another kind. In this area of the world you have been privileged not to know too many Oil spills. This year, the Argo Merchant has awakened your attention. But did vou know that m layears there were 216 such accidents all over the world? When you think about the causes of these oil spills, are you not frightened to see that greed is the primary reason? And underlying the problem is the fact that today industries are allowed by governments to act as their own policemen. The sea has become the universal sewer where all pollutants end up and hide out as rainfalls wash the air on the continent. HI H W O RLD is dangerously sic k, but we have all the technical know-how to cure it. We know how to purify gases at the source and liquid ef­ fluents mf c ities and factories We know how to recycle most raw materials and how to replace overfishing by aquaculture We can protect wildlife and rare plants. We know how to spread communication faster for mass media and how to use publicity techniques for good purposes. Iri other words, we have the technology to stop immediately and even to reverse the-extension of these damages. But these answers arc- on the technological level only. Much more important, and more complicated, are the economic and political levels. Here, the fight for survival calls for in­ dividual education, self-sacrifice, complete sociological and political revolution. The fight for survival also calls for a switch without delay from our concept of expansion in quantity to the coccept of expansion in quantity to the concept of expansion in quality. It calls for a stable society of tomorrow where science and the arts would grow without necessarily expanding the economy, without necessarily using more energy or more material. I would like to give you an example of “ what might have been” in such a different society. IH R E E \\ EARS AGO, the Calypso was one of four ships participating in an enormous and costly survey to determine the feasibility of a natural gas pipeline to extend from Tunisia across the sea to Sicily and on to Italy. Diving in saucers, we reached bottom at 800 feet. There by pure chance, in the middle of the Mediter­ ranean, we fell upon the splendid, well preserved wreck of a Phoenician war ship, dating at least four or five centuries B.C. Several merchant vessels from antiquity have been found - but never a war ship. In the stable society of tomorrow, the pipeline would certainly have been abandoned to pursue our understanding of that ancient civilization But m our industrialized society of today, it was tfie fantastic archeological find that was abandoned m order to finish the survey so more gas could be burned in Sicily. So let us all become involved, and begin to turn to the civilization of tomorrow. WASHINGTON (NEA) His name is Matthew, and he is 17 years old. His occupation, on official records, is listed as “ student.” What that really means, at this stage of his life, is that Matthew is in the test-taking business The high school senior from suburban Long Isla id, N Y., wants to become a dentist. To achieve his ambition, he must first go to college. And to gain admission to col­ lege almost any college Matthew and millions of other youngsters his age must compete for good scores on the national Scholastic Aptitude Tests, the exams which in­ creasingly determine w ho shall enter the halls of higher educa­ tion. So Matthew has been takine the SATs over and over again, aiming for scores that will please the admissions officers. Before long, millions of Matthews throughout the country are likely to find them­ selves taking similar standard­ ized achievement tests at a far younger age. And that could have enormous ramifications for public education in America. Alarmed by a 14-year decline in SAT scores, parents, politicians and educators are currently clamoring for a renewed emphasis on the fundamentals of reading, writing and arithmetic in the public schools IN WASHINGTON Martha Angle and Robert Walters At the same time, they are seeking reassurance — through sta ndardized ach ievement tests that the “ back-to-basics\" movement will pay discernible dividends. A total of 26 states have already created “ basic com­ petency' tests to measure stu­ dent achievement, while all the rest except for Montana are planning such programs. The big question now looming is whether such tests should be national in scope, devised and distributed by Uncle Sam. or whether each state should develop its own. It is tempting to opt for na­ tional exams, for uniform yard­ stick- that would permit parents in South Carolina to compare scores in their school system against those of students in, say.

I enjoy solitude Besides, they say you have two noisy little children.** Those who pric'd were poor detectives. No one saw the man after hours. They knew he had a small apartment with shabby furniture left by his mother They also knew that he saw a movie now and then because the theater manager left passes. He told everyone that he would not buy a television set \"Instead,” he said, “ I have a library card.” Young Axelsen shook his head “ What do you do with your salary?” In- said Clement sniffed “ I buy sound slocks.” lie became the man nobody know. The hank examiners arrived at irregular intervals The veterans knew that it was a waste of time going over Clement's hooks because he was always balanced within a few cents. In fact, the most exciting moment m 18 > ears occurred when an examiner dropped a Itniger on a secretary's foot The current year w as different The trees outside the bank were being stripped of russet and yellow leaves by a cold wind Clement had watched the examiners at work At noon, he took his sandwich to the back room and asked Leif Axelsen to watch his cageandcash drawer until he returned The young man was happy to pretend he was a teller W ben Clement returned, he barely liad time to remove the Next Window, Please” sign before he opened tin* cash drawer and emitted a shriek “ Somebody ,” he y elled, \"has robbed I he hank Quick,” he shouted to the policeman “ l|obody m or out \" I ran tic ( minting Customers tro/e Bank offi cers came running So did the examiners They said that they had examined the cash, and it was intact. A little frantic counting, and it was obvious that almost $4,000 was gone. It couldn’t have been Clement. Everyone knew that He hadn’t left the premises. After much shouting of, “ Be calm. Everybody quiet down,” suspicion fell on Leif Axelsen. Clement moaned, “ The truth is that the cash was all right when 1 left here for the back office. I asked Leif to watch this cage for me.” He sighed. “ He is the only one The police were called Axelsen burst into tears. \"Clement is right,” he said “ I never stole a dime in my life and I haven’t taken anything now But it’s true. I was the only person in that cage.” The young man was booked on suspicion of grand larceny, A lieutenant said, “ I believe that Axelsen boy. I don't know why. He practically handed himself up to us.’’ The lieutenant hung around the bank for days. One afternoon he walked into Clement’s cage grinning. “ The case is solved,” he said. “ I thought you’d like to know.” ('lement hung his bald head. “ I feel so sorry for his wife and children,” he murmured. “ No.\" the cop said \"Save your pity for yourself.

Berry’s World (ED ITO RS NOTE< Second in a series of special reports by our Washington Bureau Chief who has just completed a tour of NATO bases.) Ry RICHARD J.M ALO Y Salem News Washington Bureau C R ET E — The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been serving as a melting pot for a generation of European military officers and men. The alliance has blurred national identities, especially among high ranking officers Just as the European Com­ mon Market has erased trade barriers and created a new generation of businessmen and government officials who regard themselves as Europeans instead of Germans, Italians or British; so the NATO alliance has begun to forge a m ilitary machine without national hangups. There were repeated examples of this trend evident to a group of A*merican correspondents who toured NATO military bases in Italy, Greece and Turkey. Typical is the NATO Missile Firing Range here on this island in the middle of the Medi terra nian. THE RANGE is run by the Greeks; but it trains missile­ men from Britain, the US, Holland, Belgium and Ger­ many, as well as Greeks. More than 90,000 soldiers have come here in the past nine years to fire computer -guided Hawk, Sidewinder, Sparrow. Nike and other missiles at drones flying high over the azure sea Purpose of the training missions is to sharpen the shooting skills of the missile units from throughout Europe who would help repel a possible Soviet attack. Units using the $100 million NATO missile range are flown in by their own national air force; but while here are housed, fed, and trained by the Greeks who operate the firing range. The drone planes used as targets for the deadlin Hawk missiles are operated for NATO by Northrup Aviation under a contract arrangement. Other examples of how NATO has begun to blue national identities among the military include: —The Susa Battalion of crack Italian Alpine troops which has been assigned to the NATO mobile force in Central Europe and regularly engages in tough mid-winter maneuvers in frigid Norway with other troops accustomed to cold-weather fighting. —THE U N IV ERSA L use of English as the second language by NATO officers and men, enabling soldier^ and airmen from all the nations to com­ municate easily in tactical situations. Lt. Gen. Ragip Ulugby, who has just taken command of the Turkish Army’s \"West Point” hut who previously had spent four years in top jobs with a European outlook; first as deputy commander of the NATO Central European Army and then as a member of the staff of NATO’s supreme commander. While NATO has helped accelerate the trend toward P^uropean unity, the ancient rivalries still exist The most notable current example in­ volves Greece and Turkey who are bitterly at odds over issues which have their roots in centuries-old disputes. Greek-Turk«? disputes over Cyprus and the Aegean Sea have seriously hindered NATO defense planning on the Southern flank and threaten to diminish the effectiveness of the bulwark against the Soviets. (N E X T : NATO.) Problems facing f^What They're Saying What Ohio Newspapers \\re Saying Ry United Press International \"What if nobody shows up to our party? It'll be like another CAIRO C O N F E R E N C E !\" The Elyria Chronicle-Telegram It is difficult to see how any school system could be in a bigger mess than Cleveland is in today. Judges at different levels are quarreling over their respec­ tive rights to intervene in operation of the sy stem. Money has run out, some schools already are closed because disgruntled teachers are reporting “ sick,” and the teachers at this writing are voting on whether they all should walk off the job. This harrowing situation came about originally because the courts decided the Cleve­ land Board of Education had not gope far enough in desegregating the schools. In fact, they held officials had actively worked against inte­ gration. So federal Judge Frank J. Battisli got Into the act. His original assignment was to suporv tse orderly integration of the system, which over the short haul, at least » meant busing. Transporting thousands ol children across a town the size of Cleveland costs a great deal of money - money which the school board didn't have. But the plans went forward anyway. When officials said the sy stem faced a $19 2 million deficit if the schools stayed open, Judge Battisti ordered them not to repay $15 million due local hanks in December. This, of course, ignored the rights of the banks and their shareholders to the money, to say nothing of the fact that it placed a large question mark on the possibility of any bank loaning the school system money in the future The hanks appealed and the Ohio Supreme Counrt ordered the school board to repay the hums on schedule.. Regardless of one’s \\ jews on the desegration plans or on imancial acumen of school officials, this diaplay of judicial interference is troubling Elect ed officials have little or no say in what's right or w rong for the system ami for the thousands of children w ho are m i posed to be getting an education there We don’t know what can be done for Cleveland at this point State legislation granting some kind of relief could set a dangerous precedent, and refusal of Cleveland voters to raise their school taxes would not be very surprising under the circumstances... Judicial interference only leads to more of the same and, no matter how right the judges think they are or how many legal precedents they can cite, the end result is usually chaos. Mansfield News Journal As nearly everyone in this part of Ohio know's by now, state Sen Thomas Van Meter iR Ashland) would like to be lieutenant governor. The 34-year-old conservative, however, insists he’ll seek the job only if Gov. James Rhodes asks him to be his running mate. Van Meter has built a statewide reputation as a leading cheerleader for the Republican Party, and he isn’t a bit shy about letting people know about his attributes. In his own words he has youth, is a tireless campaigner, has the ability to excite people and has a strong desire to rebuild ihe GOP.In the words of some of his foes he is blunt, arrogant, brash, abrasive, self- righteous, insensitive and reac­ tionary He is even known to buck the party brass on oc­ casion. Some political pundits see Van Meter eventually getting a shot at Congress. There is even reson to believe that when Ashbrook decides to step down as 17th District congress­ man, Van Meter will have the inside track on the job. He managed Ash brook’s campaign last year. In the meantime, the young state senator has a slew of political IOU’s from the Ohio GOP campaigners and that could work in his favor in getting Gov. Rhodes’ attention. The Pawtucket ( RJ J Times The nation’s governors are meeting out in Detroit ... in Detroit's new and elegant Renaissance Center. This is not to say that the governors are insensitive. No doubt they feel for their states’ poor. One wonders, though, whether they might not feel even more deeply for the un­ fortunate if they met in some dilapitadted hovel for their business sessions and subsisted on watery soup and rubbery hamburger. Sleeping ac­ commodations could be arranged in some crowded ghetto with tiered bunk beds, broken springs and worn-out mattresses. If nothing else, the governors would dramatize a way of life with which millions are saddled but which millions of others, more fortunate, have heard about but really don’t worrv too much about. But there are some serious pitfalls to such an approach, as HEW Secretary Joseph A Califano Jr. warned in a recent speech in San Francisco. This is a big country with an incredible diversity of cultures and lifestyles How do you write test questions that would be (“qually comprehensible to a sharecropper's kid in rural South Carolina and an urban tenement dweller in Boston? Can a test which is useful in measuring individual student progress over a period of years also help pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of the curricu­ lum in a particular school system? And most of all, what would federally imposed national achievement tests do to our cherished local control of schools? It seems inevitable that every school in the country would soon be gearing its curriculum to the national exams, “ teaching to the tests,” as the educators say, if such a uni­ form testing program were instituted. “ In its most extreme form,” Califano has warned, “ national control of curriculum is a form of national control of ideas. We should be very wary of treading in that direction ...” Parents and teachers, politicians and taxpayers have every reason to be concerned about the apparent decline in academic achievement of American youngsters It is a national scandal that our high schools are granting diplomas to students who cannot even read the “ help wanted” ads, let alone fill out a job application. But unless we want Big Brother deciding what our children should study, and how they should be taught, all of us should think twice about the wisdom of national achieve­ ment tests. There are better ways of learning why Johnny can’t read. Readers Speak Dear Editor: A brief U PI article in the Dec. 6 edition prompted me to write. In 1972at Stockholm, Sweden, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment urgently recommended the acceptance of a worldwide 10- year moratorium by all whaling governments; 10 successive years would pass during which all commercial killing of whales would cease. The moratorium was rejected by a majority of the Inter­ national Whaling Commission (IWC). The IWC is made up of 15 member whaling nations. Members Russia and Japan take about 80 percent of the world’s total whale catch between them The com­ mission’s purpose is to provide for the proper conservation of w hale oopulations, thus making possible the orderly develop­ ment of the whaling industry. It was evident from the article I mentioned that the IWC is not upholding its responsibilities. The original 1978 (northern Pacific) sperm whale catch quota of 763 animals proved to me that a drastic reduction in kills was considered essential to their survival. (Last year’s northern Pacific catch quota was 7,200 sperm whales.) Manipulation by the powerful IWC members Japan and Russia was responsible for the revision of that 1978 quota to nearly 6,500 whales. As concerned humans we must act on the whales’ behalf. Every 12 minutes a whale is slaughtered to keep the world well supplied with shoe polish, car wax and margarine At that 1972 United Nations conference in Sweden, Jimmy Carter gave his support to the 10-year moratorium I urge everyone to write the President to remind him of that com­ mitment. Your letter would be an important plea for the whales — in danger of ex­ tinction at our own hands when we have hardly begun to know and admire them. Anyone interested in learning more about present con­ servation efforts might write to Project Jonah, a non-profit, international society.

M ARY DAVIDSON 2193 Southeast Blvd., Salem Sonta Clous Speaks Up Anthropologist Margaret Mead is tracking down the ancestry ot a new tribe the Claus clan In a Red book in­ terview with Santa, she cleared up some of the confusion regarding his origin. “ What in the world did St. Nicholas have to do with Christmas and giving presents?” asked Mead \"You see,\" said Santa. “ St. Nicholas' birthday was in December the* sixth of December by our calendar .and people celebrated his birth­ day with a feast. The night before, the children in lots of places put out little bundles of nay for the white horse or donkey he rode of course, it was really one of his descend­ ants, one of our clan, u ho came \\nd the children put out a shoe or hung up a stocking, and the members of mv clan were kept busy, 1 can tell you, filling them up with fruit and candy and little cakes celebrating b> giving presents instead ol receiving them But we had lots ol trouble, too \"They say that in some places, parents didn't think children should be given pres­ ents just lor nothing. They wanted good children to be re­ warded and bad children to be punished So >ome of our clan had to pretend to be scary creatures tliat came along with St Nick The most famous I guess was Knecht Rupreeht, who had a black lace and carried a switch. Another one was called Klaubach, a kind of shaggy monster with horns and fiery eyes and a long red tongue and chains that clattered There were lots of others, equally fearsome, but I ’ve always thought this was done to impress the grownups. I ’ve never heard that children were actually punished or didn’t get their presents And nowa­ days we’ve given all that up. All our clan want to be the chil­ dren’s friend.” Santa forgot to add that nice is still better than naughty in his book Quote ”1 here is no measurable I FO evidence such as a piece ot metal, flesh or cloth We don’t even have any radio signals A photograph is not a measurement.\" —Dave Williamson.
