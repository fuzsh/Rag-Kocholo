Students learn various modeling, texturing, and lighting techniques that apply to animation and digital cinematography. Students' model, texture and light three-dimensional environments.\n\nSOFA-215\n\n3D Animation I\n\n3 Credits\n\nThis course is an introduction to three-dimensional computer animation and character rigging. The basic principles of animation will be addressed in relation to three-dimensional animation. Character rigging techniques are presented and will include skeletons and animation controls. Students produce a series of short 3D computer animations and some basic character rigs. Students will become familiar with a variety of 3D computer animation techniques.\n\nSOFA-216\n\n3D Animation II\n\n3 Credits\n\nIn this course students will learn the mechanics of motion within characters. Complete character-rigging techniques will be discussed and demonstrated. Students will gain further knowledge of a variety of three-dimensional computer animation techniques and will produce a series of short 3D computer animations using a pre-rigged character.\n\nSOFA-599\n\nSOFA Independent Study\n\n1 - 6 Credits\n\nSOFA Independent Study will provide students with the ability to study in a specialized area with an individual faculty member. Students, with the assistance of a faculty adviser, should propose a course of study or project with clearly defined deliverables. Students must obtain permission of an instructor and complete the Independent Study Permission Form to enroll. Student must have a minimum of a 3.0 GPA to apply.\n\nSOFA-615\n\n3D Animation Fundamentals\n\n3 Credits\n\nThis course will provide a fundamental understanding of computer-generated three-dimensional imagery and world-building. Using top industry-standard software Autodesk Maya, students will explore the technology and processes of professional world-creation and animation. Students will experience the creation of completed digital animations and display skills in 3D modeling, animation, lighting and rendering.\n\nSOFA-620\n\n3D Modeling Mastery\n\n3 Credits\n\nIn this advanced three-dimensional modeling course, students will refine their knowledge and skills by creating objects and characters in 3D space. Students will build and create on their previous modeling knowledge and will be introduced to digital sculpting. Modeling concepts such as edge-loop placement for proper animation deformation will be emphasized.\n\nSOFA-790\n\nResearch and Thesis I\n\n4 Credits\n\nThis is the first of two courses designed to advance a student towards completion of their thesis. Students will work independently on their approved plan of work for their thesis while meeting on a regular basis with their committee chair. They are required to meet at least twice with their full committee during the semester.\n\nSOFA-799\n\nFilm and Animation Graduate Independent Study\n\n1 - 4 Credits\n\nFilm and Animation Graduate Independent Study will provide students with the ability to study in a specialized area with an individual faculty member.
