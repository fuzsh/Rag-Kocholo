        "text": "Administrators at the University of Rochester have been fighting over efforts to reshape undergraduate education and cut back on graduation programs, exposing differences over the university's priorities.\n\nAt the same time, faculty members say the administration is indifferent to their opinions.\n\nThe most severe repercussion came last Tuesday, when the university's president, Dennis O'Brien, announed the dismissal of the dean of the College of Arts and Science, Jack Kampmeier.\n\nIn a letter to the college faculty, Mr. O'Brien said he had to ask Mr. Kampmeier to step down, effective immediately, because \"the dean's perception of the university's priorities and strategies could not be reconciled with those of the central administration and the trustees.\" Plan for a New College\n\nMr. O'Brien's decision came less than a week after Mr. Kampmeier summoned department heads and members of the Faculty Council of the College of Arts and Sciences to meet on March 1 to reaffirm their confidence in him."
