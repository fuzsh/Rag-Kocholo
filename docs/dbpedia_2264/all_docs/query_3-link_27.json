        "text": "New leadership roles and a flurry of prominent hires headline a slew of changes to the faculty roster in RIT’s College of Art and Design for the 2021-22 academic year and beyond.\n\nWith the college already boasting a litany of top practitioners in their respective fields, the moves are reflective of an ambitious vision and growing demands at RIT’s intersection of technology, art and design.\n\nProfessor Elizabeth Kronfield takes over as the School of Art and School for American Crafts director, replacing Associate Professor Glen Hintz, who is returning to teaching full-time. Professor Christye Sisson is the new School of Photographic Arts and Sciences director after Professor Therese Mulligan, Ph.D., also decided to return to full-time faculty responsibilities. Hintz and Mulligan held their director posts since 2013 and 2008, respectively.\n\nThe School of Film and Animation is also under new leadership with the appointment of Shanti Thakur as director. She replaces the interim quartet of Professor Jack Beck, Associate Professor Ricardo Figueroa, Professor Tom Gasek and Associate Professor Brian Larson.\n\nKronfield is an internationally-exhibiting sculptor who has been invited to present on her cast iron art at numerous industry conferences. She is a contributor to the international cast iron art community, teaching workshops, exhibiting work, serving on panels and mentoring emerging artists. Her work ranges from small-scale sculptures to large outdoor public works and installations.\n\nShe has taught Sculpture at the undergraduate level and previously served the graduate director of RIT’s Fine Arts Studio MFA program.\n\n“The Schools of Art and American Crafts house some amazing undergraduate and graduate programs that support art knowledge and development,” Kronfield said. “I am excited to work closely with the faculty, staff, and students to maintain the excellence achieved in the classrooms and studios while also searching for new directions and opportunities for growth.\n\n“It is an exciting time to be a maker, develop skills and create while focusing on incorporating technology with tradition. This is what our schools do: study, discuss, and produce. I look forward to what comes next.”\n\nSisson started teaching Photographic Sciences at RIT in 1997 and has served as the program director for the last 11 years. An expert in ophthalmic imaging, she holds a visiting faculty designation at the University of Rochester’s Flaum Eye Institute.\n\nSisson’s research includes an appointment as principal investigator for a U.S. Government-sponsored project to help develop an algorithmic-based platform that precisely detects image manipulation. She also conducts investigations in color variability in retinal fundus photography. In May 2021, she received a patent pending for her invention of the Fundus Imaging Color Checker — a device with representative retinal colors designed for fundus camera calibration.\n\n“The last decade has been transformative for photography, imaging technology and media, and the School of Photographic Arts and Sciences (SPAS) is on the leading edge of that transformation with our innovative curriculum, faculty and alumni, as well as our newly renovated facilities,” Sisson said. “I am so proud to honor the outstanding legacy of SPAS while fostering the innovative, artistic and industry leadership that is such an integral part of the DNA of RIT’s Photo School.”\n\nThakur is an award-winning fiction and documentary filmmaker — writing, directing, producing and editing her own work. Her films have screened at more than 200 international film festivals and museums, including the Cannes Film Festival and Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Thakur’s genre-crossing work has won dozens of honors and been broadcast in 22 countries.\n\nThakur has directed films at the National Film Board of Canada, as well as through her own company, Lucida Films, LLC., which has informed her teaching over the last 19 years. She comes to RIT from Hunter College, City University of New York, where she taught both graduate and undergraduate students in the Department of Film and Media Studies for 14 years. She previously held full-time faculty roles at Hofstra and Temple.\n\nThakur said she aims to promote an environment of diversity, inclusion and collaboration.\n\n“I’m excited to have students and faculty think about how they can collaborate in everything from theater to music to dance to the performing arts,” Thakur said. “Film and animation are platforms to tell stories, and technology allows us to harness our need to expand our understanding of the world. During all stages of production, artists must learn how to collaborate with others’ expertise in order to be more creative — and successful in the industry.\n\n“In the School of Film and Animation, we must break boundaries not only across technology, but also in terms of the diversity of voices we embrace. I look forward to nurturing and amplifying voices we haven’t yet heard.”\n\nThese three leaders, along with School of Design Director Peter Byrne, will guide the acclaimed faculty in the College of Art and Design, including a series of fresh hires that underscore the college’s commitment to providing students an unmatched educational environment.\n\nThe new faculty hires include:\n\nSchool of Art\n\nJeff Harter, Assistant Professor\n\nHarter’s background includes stints as an animator for Walt Disney Animation Studios and illustrator for American Greetings.
