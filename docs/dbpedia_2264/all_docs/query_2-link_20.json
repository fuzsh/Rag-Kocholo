O’Brien brings years of hockey operations, scouting, and coaching experience to the position with the Crimson squads.\n\nO’Brien served as the Vice President of LEGACY Global Sports from 2011 – 2016, overseeing the Selects Hockey boy’s and girl’s programs globally, including the launch of both Selects Academy programs in South Kent, CT (Boy’s) and Rochester, NY (Girl’s). Under O’Brien’s guidance, Selects Academy quickly developed into a national power and at the U16/U18 age levels.\n\nPrior to his time at LEGACY Global Sports, O’Brien co-founded and served as President/GM of the Portland Jr. Pirates junior hockey organization, where he managed all day-to-day operations of the organization, including coaching, recruiting, administration, and skill development. During O’Brien’s time with the organization, the Jr. Pirates placed over 100+ players into NCAA programs, including Harvard alumni, P.O. Michaud (2007 – 2011).\n\nO’Brien started his career in hockey, after playing one season in Germany for EC Pfaffenhofen, as an NHL Scout with the Florida Panthers. He worked full-time for the Panthers over four seasons, from 1999-2003. O’Brien was responsible for scouting amateur players from the United States, Canada, and Europe in preparation for the annual NHL Draft in June.\n\nA 1997 graduate of New England College with a degree in Business Administration, O’Brien earned a Juris Doctorate degree from the Massachusetts School of Law in 2002. While at NEC, he captained the hockey team (1996 – 1997), earning ECAC East/West league honors. He is a member of New England College's 100-point club.\n\nO’Brien is a resident of Norwell, Mass., with his wife Keri, and their three children: Jack, Kate, and Will."
