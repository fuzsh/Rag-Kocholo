        "text": "I started in retail at 18 years old- now turning 35 I spent almost 14 years at Walmart, moving up the ladder. Never once interviewed for a job up the climb. The challenge of working and planning such a complex company was exciting and rewarding. Never did I see myself leaving Walmart but life happens. Joining Ollies as a Store manager after needing to relocate back to Pa and again tried to climb the ladder. An Ollies Store Manager their mission is simple and clear. Plan your manifest, make room for the freight, crush it in 2 days, easy lets roll. I grew bored and moved over to District LP. Covering four states worth of stores and endless travel, this became clear I should of stayed running a store. Me sitting still and searching for internals was not my thing. Petco Store Manager- before training was over it knew it wasn‚Äôt for me. Took a jump based on the pay specifically. I knew this was not for me. As an animal lover the idea of being over animals sounded great, till you as the gm are the one cleaning the cages. Very limited hours due to volume size, with a stock price hovering under $2.00 Gabes Store Manager- Great bigger box than Ollies so time to roll again. More money so lets make the jump again. Five trucks a week, perfect lets plan some freight. If only it was that simple. Inconsistency with processes would be an understatement. I‚Äôm not sure if retail management is getting stale, or once you work for the giants of the world everything else seems less rewarding. Retail and retail management is surely changing.\n\nHmm why don't we hear more about these things? ü§î A great example from Molson Coors Beverage Company on hiring for potential by scrapping the CV altogether. The results are encouraging, as candidates with the right mindset and values seem to be quickly thriving in their new roles. There has been a rather strong support for \"hiring for potential\" for more than a couple of years. It seems as if most people, at least in the talent acquisition community, can see the benefits of the approach to adress both talent shortage and to improve the diversity outcome of a hiring process. I think this is a wonderful picture of a couple of people who landed new jobs as a result of a future-looking (potential) rather than backwards-looking (direct experience) process. Hope we can see more examples like this. ü§ó Please like or share if you agree! #HiringForPotential #Innovation #FutureOfWork #TalentAcquisition #EmployeeDevelopment\n\nA few things I‚Äôve learned while working at Costco Wholesale is that I have to stay consistent, focus on working, and finish all my tasks. The reasoning for all this is to leave a good impression on managers and supervisors so you can be their first pick for anything that can come up. I think I would be happy with my performance if I was my manager, because I am always trying my hardest to do my work. Three career goals I can set for myself is to continue working hard, help out the company in a positive way, and influence those around me to do better. Some things I can consider doing to go above and beyond at my job is to push more carts, see if there‚Äôs any other job positions I can use training in, and do my best work. #RiverRidgeWBL #GeorgiaWBLworks\n\nOne key tip for getting promoted at Costco: build strong relationships within the company. - ü§ù Network with colleagues and leaders. - üå± Seek opportunities to learn and grow. - üèÜ Show willingness to take on new challenges. #CareerGrowth #Networking #PromotionTips - üìà Building relationships helps you stay informed about new opportunities. - üí° Learning from others can inspire new ideas and perspectives. - üîÑ Taking on new challenges demonstrates your commitment and adaptability. - üß© Networking provides support and mentorship. - üöÄ Being proactive in your development leads to quicker advancement.
