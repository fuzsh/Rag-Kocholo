        "text": "Michele O'Brien will enter her third season at the helm of the Blue Demon's women's soccer program in 2023, after being named head coach of the program on June 28, 2021. O'Brien assumed the position as the Blue Demon's fourth head coach in program history after serving as associate head coach since 2014. O'Brien first joined the Blue Demons staff in 2009.\n\nO'Brien led the Blue Demons to a 7-11 record in her first year as head coach in 2021, posting a 4-6 record in BIG EAST play. O'Brien claimed her first career win on Aug. 26, 2021 in DePaul's 1-0 victory against Oakland in Rochester, Mich. O'Brien and the Blue Demons reeled in the first conference win of the season on Oct. 3 versus Villanova in a 3-2 contest at Wish Field.\n\nThe New York native was named associate head coach in May of 2014 after helping lead the Blue Demons to the BIG EAST Conference tournament in four of her five seasons at DePaul. She was instrumental in DePaul advancing to its first BIG EAST title game and in 2013 along with securing a berth in the NCAA tournament.\n\nShe helped guide the Blue Demons on a record-breaking ride in 2014 with a program-best 16-1-4 overall record that was the fifth-best winning percentage in the country. DePaul set a school record with a 20-game undefeated streak, and by the end of the regular season was one of only two programs (No. 1 UCLA) to remain unbeaten. The Blue Demons attained their highest national ranking when Soccer America ranked them at No. 7.\n\nDePaul's high-powered attack was No. 21 in the nation in assists, No. 29 in points and No. 34 in scoring offense on the way to winning its first BIG EAST regular-season and tournament titles. Seven players were named to the All-BIG EAST Team led by BIG EAST Rookie of the Year Alexa Ben and first-team selections Rachel Pitman and Elise Wyatt. Ben, Sarah Gorden, Alex Godinez and Most Outstanding Player Amber Paul were chosen for the BIG EAST All-Tournament Team. DePaul advanced to its second-straight NCAA tournament, falling 2-0 at Wisconsin.\n\nThe Blue Demons led the BIG EAST in scoring offense, fewest goals allowed and goals-against average (GAA) while finishing second in assists and points. Their 130 points was the second-highest single season total in school history while the 44 goals and 42 assists were also second in program history. Head coach Erin Chastain, associate head coach Michele O'Brien and assistant coach Sarah Stanczyk were honored as the BIG EAST Coaching Staff of the Year.\n\nAs a Blue Demon assistant coach, O'Brien successfully recruited standout Ashleigh Goddard and 2013 All-BIG EAST Third Team defender Rachel Pitman from England.\n\nO'Brien joined the women's soccer program on Feb. 16, 2009 as an assistant coach and brought along elite-level playing and coaching experience to the sidelines of Wish Field as a member of Ireland's National Team since 2003. O'Brien helped lead Team Ireland to the 2011 European Championships. Ireland has been ranked 27th in the FIFA World Rankings out of 116 national teams from around the globe.\n\nIn addition to her national team experience with Ireland, O'Brien played seven seasons in the United Soccer Leagues W-League and played with the United Kingdom for the Arsenal Ladies Football Club. Arsenal, the most successful team in the U.K., competed in world-class events such as the European Cup and FA Cup.\n\nIn the USL, she played for the Long Island Rough Riders and with the New Jersey Sky Blue. O'Brien retired from competitive soccer in 2012 after playing internationally for 10 seasons.\n\nO'Brien served as an assistant coach at Columbia University from 2005-07 and was an assistant at New York University from 2004-05. She played collegiately at Florida International University from 1998-2001 where she was a two-time Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year. She also earned first-team All-Sun Belt Conference honors twice and was a two-time All-Sun Belt Tournament selection. O'Brien graduated as FIU's all-time leader in shots (288), goals (58) and points (134) and is second in program history in assists (18).\n\nOâ€™Brien and her husband Blair Banwart, who works for the DePaul Athletics facilities department, have a daughter, Addison, and son, Wyatt.\n\nO'Brien Head Coaching Career"
