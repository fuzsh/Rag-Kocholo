        "text": "In the book \"The Art of Fiction\", John Gardener talks to us about the *Fictive Dream*. The reader enters a dream when they start reading. And it is our job as writers **not to wake them up** from this dream. If we bore them or break the suspension of disbelief, boom, they wake up. > \"In bad or unsatisfying fiction, this fictional dream is interrupted from time to time by some mistake or conscious ploy on the part of the artist. We are abruptly snapped out of the dream, forced to think of the writer or the writing.\" > **John Gardener** This problem, obviously, goes beyond fiction. In video games we call it **retention**. What is interesting to highlight is that retention poses different scales. There is an element of retention in that we call moment-to-moment gameplay. This retention has to do with the gameplay being satisfactory at all times. The player has to have a more or less clear intention horizon, and achieve effects and progress through their movements in the game space. All of this has to feel satisfying. As Gardener would say, we must not bore them, or they wake up. But we also have other types of retention. We have elements of extrinsic motivation: achievements, unlockables, events, etc. These types of retention are more long-term, the player returns to play our game driven by that extrinsic motivation. When I think about how the Fictive Dream manifests in games, I specifically think about moment-to-moment gameplay. All extrinsic retention tools necessarily break the Fictive Dream and have a more gamey nature, separate from storytelling: the story disappears and the focus is on the game. Maintaining the Fictive Dream must be the first item to keep an eye on during playtesting. If you are making a narrative game, you have to treat the rupture of the Fictive Dream as a high-priority bug. Otherwise, you are leaving your players without what they came to seek. #gamedevelopment #gamedesign #writingtips #writing\n\nWhat an empowering, effective (and thoroughly nerdy) way to frame the importance of alt-text! When writing alt-text, I've noticed that I, like many others, have a tendency to try to remove my editorial voice out of concern that I may be \"manipulating\" the response of the person reading. However, in doing so, I realize I am depriving the reader of the emotional impact that the sighted person is provided by omitting so many details. This article does a wonderful job of demonstrating how important the content and structure of alt-text is to ensuring that a piece of content's message and impact are maintained. https://lnkd.in/gzw6n2cd\n\nHaving just finished Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, I want to talk about the lessons that can be learned from the game from the narrative side. (NO SPOILERS). This isn't a review; I'm not giving notes; I'm simply appreciating something really wonderful and giving my perspective as to why I think it's so great. There is a palpable magic to the story of Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth. The character writing is excellent and offers some really emotional moments. The cutscenes are breathtaking, both in technical excellence and direction. But my favorite thing is the way the game balances tone. Here's a spoiler-free example. You are in the midst of a war, a world-ending conflict, a revenge plot, and on your journey, you stop at Lower Junon looking to find a way to progress to the city. The weight of the conflicts surrounding Cloud, your party, and the global conflict is significant, but... you find a silly sidequest about frogs. I'm not going to go in-depth into the side quest, but the gist of it is that you need to help a group of kids with a silly task. Seems like a distraction amidst this conflict, but the game roots this in an aspect of the story that's incredibly heartfelt- making the children at the center of the conflict feel just a little bit better. That's the lesson here. Your town can shift, adapt, and change, moment to moment, so long as you do one thing: Root that tonal shift in the same emotional and thematic backbone as your overarching narrative or of your character. Another good example of this is the Yakuza games, particularly the most recent one, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth. Anyway, great game with a lot of wonderful lessons to teach and experiences to uncover. Congratulations to the team! #FinalFantasyRebirth #Writing #GameWriting"
