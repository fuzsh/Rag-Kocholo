Mr. O'Brien said he wanted to allow his successor to take part in filling those posts.\n\nThe 143-year-old University of Rochester is highly regarded for its electronics research, and for its Institute of Optics.\n\nIts faculty and alumni have included five Nobel Prize winners and 10 Pulitzer Prize winners. Most recently, Christopher Rouse won the Pulitzer for music in April.\n\nMr. Jackson, who will be the university's ninth president, was dean of the University of Virginia law school from 1988 to 1991. He was a law professor at Harvard from 1986 to 1988 after serving a decade on the Stanford faculty.\n\nA native of Kalamazoo, Mich., Jackson earned his law degree from Yale in 1975, and, over the next three years was a clerk for Judge Marvin E. Frankel of Federal District Court in Manhattan and later for Justice William A. Rehnquist of the United States Supreme Court."
