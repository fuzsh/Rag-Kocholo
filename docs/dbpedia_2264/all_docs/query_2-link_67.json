Notre Dame softball head coach Deanna Gumpf and her five-year old daughter, Tatum, recently presented a check for $12,046 to the pediatric oncology unit of the South Bend Memorial Hospital. The Irish softball program raised more money than any other school in the nation this past season as part of the NFCA’s Strikeout Cancer initiative. Notre Dame’s Strikeout Cancer game was played against Louisville on April 17. Louisville even auctioned off its game-worn jerseys and donated the money to Notre Dame’s cause. Tatum, who was diagnosed with leukemia last summer, threw out the ceremonial first pitch of that contest. “It was very emotional for all of us, because that was the first game she was able to attend since she was diagnosed,” said Gumpf, whose team advanced to the regional round of the 2011 NCAA Softball Championship. “It was very cool, and Tatum loved every minute of it.” The Gumpf family recently returned from its “Make a Wish” trip in Orlando.

From her experiences on Notre Dame’s first varsity women’s basketball team to her current career as one of the top eye physicians in the nation, it seems only fitting that Dr. Carol Lally Shields be described as a visionary. For her pioneering efforts in the classroom, on the playing court, and in her professional work, Lally Shields was inducted into the Capital One Academic All-America ® Hall of Fame during a ceremony last week at the Marco Island (Fla.) Marriott Resort & Spa, inconjunction with the College Sports Information Directors of America’s (CoSIDA) annual workshop. Lally Shields becomes the sixth former Notre Dame student-athlete to be inducted into the Capital One Academic All-America ® Hall of Fame, as selected by CoSIDA members. Since the Hall of Fame’s inception in 1988, 112 individuals have been distinguished with the honor. After accepting the award from CoSIDA president Larry Dougherty, Lally Shields sat down for an onstage interview session with event emcee and ESPN personalityRece Davis. In addition to discussing her work as an ophthalmologist, Lally Shields spoke about the art of balancing academics and athletics during her time as a student-athlete at Notre Dame and how crafting the skills of time management and self discipline prepared her for a career in medicine. “I worried that being an athlete at Notre Dame would take away from my studies, but, in fact, it was the exact opposite,” Lally Shields said. “When I came back from practices, I felt good about myself and I was able to put mymind to my work. It helped me academically and led me to develop a sense of pride in myself. I believed that I could accomplish anything.” Lally Shields was joined at the gala by four other inductees as members of the Class of 2011, including Wabash College basketball player Peter Metzelaars (’82), track and field star Dr. Randall Pinkett from Rutgers University (’94), women’s volleyball standout Dr. Julie Bremner Romias (’94) of UCLA and NCAA champion diver Dr. Megan Neyer (’86) from the University of Florida. Lally Shields becomes the first female Notre Dame student-athlete to be inducted into the Capital One Academic All-America ® Hall of Fame. The other Fighting Irish inductees have been former football players Bob Burger (a 2006 inductee), Robert Thomas (a 1996 inductee), Dave Casper (a 1993 inductee) and Joe Theismann (a 1990 inductee) as well as basketball standout John Paxson (a 2005 inductee).

As a junior, she led the Fighting Irish in scoring at 10.7 points per game in the first year of the varsity program at Notre Dame and averaged 12.8 points per game during her senior campaign. Lally Shields was the team’s most valuable player in 1978-79 and also was the winner of the ’79 Notre Dame Club of St. Joseph Valley Rockne Student-Athlete award for excellence in academics and athletics after earning Dean’s List recognition all eight semesters.

GrassrootSoccer staff, coaches and participants last week had the honor of meeting First Lady Michelle Obama along with Archbishop Desmond Tutu during Mrs. Obama’s visit to South Africa. The First Lady met with Tommy Clark, M.D., the founder and CEO of Grassroot Soccer. Clark is the eldest son of Notre Dame men’s soccer head coach Bobby Clark. Grassroot Soccer (GRS) is an international non-governmental organization that uses the power of soccer to educate, inspire and mobilize communities against the spread of HIV. To date, GRS has educated 400,000 young Africans in HIV prevention towards a goal of one million youth by World Cup 2014. As part of her mission to inspire young people, Mrs. Obama paid a special visit to Cape Town Stadium, home of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, where she addressed a group of 100 youth and participated in HIV prevention activities led by GRS coaches. During a briefing with Dr. Clark and Mphakiseng Molefe (the assistant master coach), Mrs. Obama and Archbishop Tutu learned about the history and mission of GRS. Mphakiseng told her story of growing up in a risky environment and how GRS enabled her to overcome the challenges she faced as a young South African woman. Her experience with GRS now allows her to teach young people to make the best decisions for their future. She also shared how GRS has given her unique opportunities to become a youth leader in her community. Mrs. Obama and Archbishop Tutu participated in two Grassroot Soccer Skillz activities designed to teach HIV prevention and life skills to young people. They cheered on the students and dribbled a soccer ball alongside them, demonstrating their enthusiasm for youth education and empowerment.\n\n11. The 2010 Notre Dame football game programs were voted best in the nation among all NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision institutions.\n\n12. The Notre Dame fencing program has promoted Gia Kvaratskhelia to the position of associate head coach, it was announced by Irish head coach Janusz Bednarski. Kvaratskhelia will continue to work primarily with the foilists in terms of his coaching responsibilities on the strip, but he will now also be the primary assistant to the head coach in terms of recruiting, scheduling, public relations, compliance, academic services, summer camps, and administration of the overall program.

It marked the second-straight gold medal for the Irish in foil, as Gerek Meinhardt took home the title in 2010. In addition, he has helped guide 14 foilists to All-American status. Kvaratskhelia came to Notre Dame following 10 years as the coach of the Kanza Fencing Club in Salina, Kan. He transformed the club from a small recreational club into one of the nation’s top foil centers, earning 2002 USFA National Developmental Coach of the Year honors.Kanza fencers appeared in the national finals on 15 occasions, receiving nearly 50 national medals. Kanza also produced Notre Dame’s Steve Kubik and Teddy and Grant Hodges. A native of Tbilisi, Georgia, Kvaratskhelia graduated from the Georgian State Physical Training Institute in Tbilisi and was pursuing a graduate degree in journalism from Tbilisi State University in 1993 before immigrating to the United States. He became a U.S. citizen in 2004 and is fluent in Georgian, Russian and English. He and his wife, Dani Edson, have one daughter, Maya.\n\n13.
