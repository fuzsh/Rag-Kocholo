        "text": "Is it mandatory to follow the style guide? Well, yes and no. Style and usage rules exist to help communicate messages clearly for particular audiences. There will be times when—due to the design or purpose of a publication or to achieve a certain look or feel—it makes sense to deviate judiciously from the style guide. Decorative or formal presentations often need a particular treatment. Signs and banners often have space constraints that need to be factored in when composing materials for those formats. In such situations, keep in mind that consistency is essential to presenting a polished presentation.\n\nAlso keep in mind that all style guides are just that, guides. As the Chicago Manual notes, such references are intended to help direct writers in achieving their goals of communicating clearly, but are not intended to be so constricting that they close off all flexibility:\n\n“We have come to understand that even in the case of somewhat arbitrary rules, writers and editors tend to look to this manual for the most efficient, logical, and defensible solution to a given editorial problem. On the other hand, none of our recommendations are meant to foreclose breaking or bending rules to fit a particular case, something we continue to do ourselves. Once again, we have looked to what has become a maxim (from the first edition of the manual in 1906): ‘Rules and regulations such as these, in the nature of the case, cannot be endowed with the fixity of rock-ribbed law. They are meant for the average case, and must be applied with a certain degree of elasticity.’ ”"
