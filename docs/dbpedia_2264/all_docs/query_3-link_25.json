UR's student athletes also excelled in the classroom, with 31 players being honored by the Liberty League All-Academic selections.\n\nLast season, the Yellowjackets posted their best record since 2015, finishing 5-5 (2-4 Liberty League) against one of the top-10 toughest schedules in the country. 10 'Jackets earned All-Liberty League honors, including two first-teamers who also earned D3football.com All-Region honors, while 22 were named to the Liberty League All-Academic squad.\n\nIn 2022, Rochester finished 3-7 (1-5 LL) and had one of the best ground games in the country, led by junior running back Daniel Papantonis '24, who was named a 2nd Team All-American by the AFCA. Two players were named All-Region by D3football.com, and eight were All-Liberty League. The Yellowjackets eclipsed the 2,000-yard rushing total for just the 11th time in the history of the program. Additionally, 30 individuals were honored as Liberty League All-Academic, eight were College Sports Communicators (formerly CoSIDA) Academic All-District and seven garnered Hampshire Honor Society awards.\n\nThe 2021 season saw the Yellowjackets finish with three wins and have seven All-Liberty League performers, with senior Nicholas Petruzziello being named to the D3football.com All-Region team and a CoSIDA Academic All-American.\n\nPrior to joining Rochester, Martinovich served as the head coach at MIT for nine seasons (2009-17). During that time, he steadily built the MIT program into a successful unit. MIT won the New England Football Conference (NEFC) Championship in 2014, earned its first NCAA Division III playoff berth, and advanced to the second round after a first-round win at Husson University. The final record was 10-1.\n\nFollowing the 2014 season, he was named NEFC Coach of the Year, New England Football Writers College Division Coach of the Year, ECAC Coach of the Year, and the American Football Coaches Association Region I Division III Coach of the Year.\n\nIn the 2017 season, he directed MIT to success on both the gridiron and in the classroom. MIT was 7-3 overall, 5-2 in the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC). The Engineers were tied for third in the nation in fewest sacks allowed (five). The team averaged 26.8 points per game and almost 400 yards of total offense per game.\n\nDuring his nine years in Cambridge, MIT football players earned 17 CoSIDA Academic All-America® awards, including seven selections to the First Team. The MIT quarterback was named the 2017 CoSIDA Division III Football Academic All-American of the Year.\n\nFrom a football standpoint at MIT, he coached two All-Americans, 16 All-Region players, four All-New England performers, and 63 All-Conference players.\n\nHis arrival at Rochester brings him back to roots in Western New York State. Martinovich graduated from Hobart College in June, 1994 where he played football. He had coaching stops at Bucknell University (1994-95), Hamilton College (1995-97), and the University at Albany (1997-98). In July, 1998, he joined the coaching staff at Swarthmore College as Offensive Coordinator and remained there until April, 2001.\n\nMartinovich returned to Hamilton College in April 2001 for a three-year stint as Offensive Coordinator and Quarterbacks Coach. He also served as an assistant professor of physical education.\n\nHe moved to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in June, 2004. He was the Offensive Coordinator for one season before being named the Defensive Coordinator and Defensive Backs coach in December, 2004. His RPI defense ranked first in the Liberty League for three straight years. RPI played in the 2007 NCAA Division III tournament and was crowned an ECAC Bowl Champion on three other occasions.\n\nMartinovich currently resides in Brighton with his wife Erin, and their children, Hailey (20) and Tyler (17).\n\nTwitter: @ChadMartinovich\n\nYEAR BY YEAR COACHING RECORD OVERALL CONFERENCE YEAR SCHOOL WIN LOSS WIN LOSS POSTSEASON 2009 Mass.
