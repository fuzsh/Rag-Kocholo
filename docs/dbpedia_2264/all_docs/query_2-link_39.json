As someone who is partial to X, I think I'll miss them.\n\nAuburn is a long way from good, but Gazoo touched on what's important. They're donig what they need to do to in the short run to maximize their long term potential.\n\nI'll say one more thing, and it will sound like an insult, but I really do not mean it to be....\n\nNow that the tournament is over, I think I'm most impressed by the game UD didn't win. UD has been traditionally awful at identifying their own strengths and weaknesses, and identifying their oponent's strengths and weaknesses. They often played away from their own strengths, and to the strengths of their opponents.\n\nIt's still early, and not much is known about a Colorado team with six new players, but it isn't too big of a leap to think that Colorado will be (and is) good this year. Dayton was prepared. They didn't win, and the game was sloppy, but they seemed to know who they were playing against. The fact that they scouted and prepared for a team like that with so little information to scout and prepare with is a good sign. Colorado excited no one in the preseason, but so far they're more accomplished and have looked more impressive than anyone else in the Pac Twelve.\n\nIt's hard to scout teams midway through the year. It's almost impossible to scout teams early in the year that have so many new players.

We saw glimpses of it last year, but I don't think coach had the \"Jimmie's and the Joe's\". Forwards who can put the ball on the deck and finish at the rim! It just feels like we have ways of manufacturing baskets that we haven't had in a very long time. Long way to go of course and teams will start scouting us much better as well but so far so good. Defense still needs to improve, it seems the guys fall asleep from time to time.\n\nxubrew;281754 wrote:\n\nIt's still early, and not much is known about a Colorado team with six new players, but it isn't too big of a leap to think that Colorado will be (and is) good this year.

I feel he is only at Dayton because it is a good stepping stone job, not because he has any particular affinity for the school or community. For him to get to where he wants to be, he needs to win and that is what most every fan wants as well. So its a good pairing right now, but I do not see it lasting more than than one trip to the NCAA tournament. I get the feeling Archie will take a decent BCS conference job at the first opportunity ala a Travis Ford or Keno Davis. There won't be any \"turning down Depaul twice\" with Archie. Hope I'm wrong about that.\n\nArchie said that Dayton is a great place \"and I hope to be here a long time\". I know that people say things but saying that he wanted to be at UD for a long time didn't need to be said and probably wouldn't have been said if he didn't mean it. Of course the university will need to pay him appropriately but I won't be surprised if he is at UD for an extended period.\n\nConcerning the skills I am always more impressed with a great pass or great shot than a dunk.

Hopefully he's as good a recruiter as BG and a much better coach.\n\nYou know over the years of posts, I typically don't give props ahead of scheduled, due to the fact, they often times don't deliver...in terms of staff, players, freshman, etc...\n\nNotice I didn't say anything about future results, just being excited for the potential for a new ceiling. From last season to the start of this year, I don't feel like it is groundhog day.\n\nIn my opinion, BG recruited better athletes. The state of the program did not allow him to recruit better basketball player athletes. Most of the athletes he recruit had deficient basketball skills that prevented them from playing in higher levels arenas (BCS).\n\nHaving said that his success had made it EASIER for Archie to recruit higher caliber players. OP did the same for BG. So look at the long term direction since mid Purnell. It has gone up and Archie is the next step up the ladder.\n\nArchie will aspire to go higher. Don't fool yourself into believing that BG was here for the long run. he turned down offers that he considered more lateral waiting for the right one. I think he jumped to GT because of the terrible last season (JS and BS) and the administration's impatience.\n\nFinal comment about skills. Josh worked all summer on that mid range jumper. He shot lots of Js when he was limited in some knee rehab. So far, his mid range J looks ugly. Air balls and clanks.. Developing skills while already in college is a lot harder. I am not sure you how far you could improve the handles for CW and LW. Both shot from the palm.\n\nIt is a lot easier to build skills if you already have some good habits ingrained. Ask the golfers who can't hit 6 foot putts.\n\nHaving said this, I think Archie is a better skill development coach and EVERY basketball player must constantly work on their skills. The best golfers in the world practice thousands of those 6 foot putts.\n\nParis;281833 wrote: Archie said in an interview that he actually knew three or four of the very young Colorado players well because he recruited them out of high school (when he was an asst at Arizona).

Hope I'm wrong about that.\n\nUD is already a better situation than schools like BC, Providence, Auburn, Northwestern, Washington State, etc. We may not necessarily pay as well at the top end, but the ability to succeed is better, the likelihood of stagnation is less. We have the resources, the history, the fan base, and the intangibles to be successful for a hard charging coach.\n\nPut a different way, look at what his brother did at X. Jimmy Kimmell didn't jump at the first BCS job he could land, he stayed until he could get one of the primo gigs in college hoops. There's no guarantee Arch will do the same, he could jump ship when Purnell can't resurrect the moribund Blue Demon program. However, he could wait it out here until a Syracuse-like position comes open, rather than making a lateral move to a middling BCS coaching trap (see Keno Davis, Dan Monson, John Pelphrey, etc).\n\nRegarding the skills of many bg recruits. I think that BG saw the potential of each player that he recruited if certain skills were improved. CJ is a perfect example, if he good handles he would be in the nba right now.\n\nI realize I am in the minority here regarding skills development. To say that a great athlete cannot improve his shooting or ability to dribble a basketball is nuts imho. I think that when a player has a deficiency it is partly because the skill wasn't as easy to master as another skill and partly because the player enjoyed exercising another skill. As an example CJ loved to shoot and he was really good at it. Chris Wright loved to dunk and he was really good at it. Instead of working on their deficiencies they continued to get even better at what they did best.\n\nI remember BG talking about players at Michigan State and how much they improved after arriving and how hard they worked. I also remember a player in the A10 that BG talked about who they didn't guard on the perimeter because he couldn't make a shot. The next year the guy was leading the A10 in three point shooting. BG said something to the team like \"can you imagine how much time he spent in the gym to improve like that?\"\n\nIf a player wants to improve his handles I believe that HUGE improvement would occur if someone put in an hour or even half an hour per day working specifically on ball handling. Finding out how to do it is easy, just buy Pete Maravich's stuff. Then the hard part comes, you have to work on something that you are not good at.\n\nUDBrian;281929 wrote: I realize I am in the minority here regarding skills development.

The best athletes can get better at what they do. It takes guidance and the will to get better. If what you say regarding player development is true, then things make sense as players got better at their strong suits and rarely improved elsewhere. Under BG, players got better defensively and became better rebounders. They never really got much better at offensive facets of their game unless it was something they were already fairly proficient in. LW, got better at going to the hole, but couldn't shoot. CW could get to the rack, but wasn't a good shooter. CJ was a good shooter, but couldn't dribble to his right. LF and JB could shoot when they received the ball in a certain position, but were limited elsewhere. This could be said for a majority of guys that played during this time frame.\n\nI can't buy the fact that the guys that played so hard on the court for BG, didn't work hard off the court. This leads me to believe it was due more to direction, than work ethic. Our guys busted their butts with the weights, etc...but didn't get much better at their weak points? Something wasn't there, and we may never know what, but I have a tough time placing that on the backs of the players that worked so hard in the public eye."
