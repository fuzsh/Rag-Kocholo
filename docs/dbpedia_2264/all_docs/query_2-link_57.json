Preschoolers from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville's\n\nEarly Childhood Center visited the SIUE School of Engineering's Department of Civil Engineering on Feb. 17.\n\nFor about an hour and a half, 16 youngsters, supervised by staff from the Early Childhood Center, including teacher Stephanie Henschen, assistant teacher Mary Blain, undergraduate student worker Elaina May, volunteer Courtney Gibson and student teacher Monica Venhaus, were introduced to some basic civil engineering concepts:\n\n• An open-channel flow demonstration, which shows how people can get caught in turbulent water and unable to get out;\n\n• How water flows around objects in a stream and causes erosion using a stream table;\n\n• Sand-sieving to show that it is made up of different sizes;\n\n• Soil-rolling to find soil plasticity, or, how water influences the look and behavior of soil.\n\nThe children were given SIUE souvenirs, including bottles of bubbles and piggy banks, courtesy of the SIUE Foundation. SIUE Professor of Civil Engineering Susan Morgan, who is chair of the department and the mother of one of the preschoolers, worked with Brent Vaughn, a lab specialist and Trisha Youngquist, a graduate student, to create a memorable experience for the youngsters.\n\n\"Most engineering outreach, including in the School of Engineering, is focused on middle and high schools,\" Morgan said. \"This was an opportunity to introduce engineering to preschoolers, who are such a terrific audience-enthusiastic and not only willing to get wet and dirty, but excited about it.\n\n\"We had a great time showing them a few basic engineering concepts, and they had a lot of fun playing with the water and soil.\"\n\nClick here for a picture of preschooler Jayden Johnson, 5, of Edwardsville, sieving sand during a recent visit to the SIUE School of Engineering.\n\nClick here for a picture of (from left to right) Kathryn Morgan, 4, Jayden Johnson, 5 and Sofia Muller, 4, all of Edwardsville, and Isabelle Leyba, 4, of Granite City, learning about erosion and other civil engineering principles at a stream table.\n\nClick here for a picture of (from left to right) Kyle Peery, 3, of Collinsville, and Vyla Hupp, 4, of Edwardsville, use water to learn about soil plasticity.\n\nBack to top\n\n2/26/09\n\nFaculty Recital To Showcase SIUE Music Department Talent\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.)

Melissa Ford of Ozark, an accounting graduate student in the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville School of Business, recently was honored with the Enterprise Rent-A-Car Foundation Student Leader of the Semester Award. The Enterprise Foundation award recognizes SIUE business students who are nominated by student organizations for outstanding participation and responsibility.\n\nFord's award recognizes her work as president of the SIUE chapter of Beta Alpha Psi, the national honor society for top accounting majors. The organization strives to foster relationships with fellow accounting majors as well as faculty and future employers. Ford was chosen for this award because of her hard work and dedication to the society. She has achieved numerous accomplishments so far this year including competing in the national Beta Alpha Psi case competition and participating in the Planning Committee for Relay for Life on behalf of Beta Alpha Psi.\n\nIn addition, Ford has organized two very significant events for the honor society: the inaugural Meet the Firms event, which allowed students to network with 12 potential employers, and the Accounting Fall Awards Banquet in which employers, faculty and students joined to celebrate the accomplishments of accounting students. \"Melissa also has excelled in willingly leading the officers and members in a constant effort at improving organization and performance in her Beta Alpha Psi chapter,\" said Allen Hunt, assistant professor of accounting and faculty advisor to the SIUE chapter. Adding to these accomplishments, Ford also has maintained a 4.0 in the School's master's accounting program\n\nThe award carries with it a $100 stipend and certificate. In addition, Ford will be recognized at a reception in the spring that will honor all Enterprise Rent-A-Car Foundation Award recipients, while providing SIUE business students an opportunity to network with Enterprise executives.\n\nThe SIUE School of Business is among an elite 10 percent of business schools worldwide that have earned the prestigious seal of approval from the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International). The School has been AACSB International accredited since 1975. This assures that students receive the highest quality in strategic resource management, interaction with faculty and achievement of learning goals. In addition, the SIUE Accounting Program also is accredited through AACSB International. Less than 33 percent of AACSB-accredited business schools hold an accounting accreditation.\n\nClick here for a photo of the award presentation: Shown here are Melissa Ford (at center holding award certificate) along with Lee E.

As a high school student, Ralph Axtell trapped snakes to make money to buy books about reptiles.\n\nAlways fascinated with animals, the young man-now a professor of biological sciences at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville-recalls catching rattlesnakes and other types of snakes in the early 1950s and selling them to Snake King-a business in Brownsville, Texas that then sold the reptiles to zoos and individuals across the United States.\n\n\"I was interested mainly in snakes at the time,\" said Axtell who holds a bachelor of science each in zoology and geography; a master's each in zoology and botany and a doctorate each in zoology and paleontology, all from The University of Texas at Austin.\n\nAxtell first became interested in reptiles while searching for snakes under metal, wood and cardboard lying in backyards in Texas City, Texas. After moving to the small town of Bishop in South Texas, he noticed some unusual looking lizards running across a road about one mile south of Bishop.\n\n\"I didn't know what they were,\" he said.\n\nCaptivated by these small beasts, Axtell's discovery turned out to be an unidentified southern subspecies of the spot-tailed earless lizard, which first had been found in Central Texas, and identified as Holbrookia lacerata in the 1800s. The new subspecies, which became known as Holbrookia lacerata subcaudalis, was found living in South Texas and Northern Mexico. Axtell made the study of the animals his life's work, spending more than 50 years searching for and cataloguing the creatures, and chronicling their distributions, behaviors and habits.\n\nToday it is rumored that these creatures are facing extinction, a rumor that Axtell hopes to clarify by traveling, along with a team of other scientists, to Texas this spring and summer-during the months when the creatures are most active. The team plans to locate populations of these unique lizards. The spot-tailed earless lizard's distinctive characteristics make it difficult to mistake for any other, he said. While he believes the species might be gone from many locations it previously inhabited, he does not think it is endangered.\n\n\"I think a number of populations still exist, but they are missing from a broad area in Texas where they used to occur,\" he said. All the known localities for this lizard have been placed in a publication, An Interpretive Atlas of Texas Lizards, which includes \"all museums and collection in the United States where they are kept, as well as in private collections.\"\n\nMeasuring up to about six inches in total length, the creature is named for the prominent dark spots under its tail. Because it outwardly appears to have no ears, it is referred to as an earless lizard.\n\nAxtell and other scientists on the team will conduct their investigation through The Nature Conservancy, which is a leading, global conservation organization dedicated to protecting ecologically important lands and waters. The Conservancy has more than one million members and protects more than 18 million acres in the U.S. It has helped preserve more than 117 million acres in Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific.\n\nThe Nature Conservancy in Texas protects roughly 250,000 acres of wild lands and, along with partners, has conserved 750,000 acres for wildlife habitat across the state.\n\nThe project on which Axtell is working is being funded by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's Texas Horned Lizard License Plate Fund. More information on the lizard is available online: www.nature.org/texas, including a form for lizard-spotters that may be downloaded, a map of historic locations, photos, video and a poster. For more information, contact Axtell by e-mail: raxtell@siue.edu, or by phone, (618) 650-3405.\n\nBack to top\n\n2/20/09\n\nSt. Louis Television Meteorologist To Speak At Social Work Gala\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.)

The Southern Illinois University Board of Trustees today awarded contracts worth nearly $850,000 to seven Metro East companies for expansion projects at the SIU School of Dental Medicine in Alton and in one of two buildings housing the SIUE School of Pharmacy in University Park, a research park on campus. The project at the SDM will add four oral surgery stations at the School's Main Clinic, while the expansion at Pharmacy includes added gathering and common study space at 220 University Park Drive.\n\nThe Board made the awards at its regular meeting conducted today at SIU Carbondale. However, before awarding the bids for the Pharmacy project, the Board was asked to increase the budget for the construction from $350,000 to $800,000 because bids came in much higher than expected. The original estimate did not include furniture costs. The project will be paid through University Operating Funds.\n\nPharmacy project bids were awarded to: GRS Construction of Columbia, $405,300, for general work; Pyramid Electric Contractors Inc. of Fairview Heights, $51,875; and France Mechanical Corp., $41,500, for ventilation work. Since approving a Pharmacy curriculum in 2003, changes have been made that now allow for three years of study on campus in Pharmacy rather than only two. This change has, with the program finishing its fourth year, resulted in an increased focus of on-campus training which in turn has created the need for additional space.\n\nIn the School of Dental Medicine's project, a contract worth $132,000 was awarded to general contractor Morrisey Construction Co. of Godfrey; a $119,177 contract was awarded to Wegman Electric of East Alton; a $72,631 contract was awarded to Bel-o Sales & Service of Belleville, for plumbing; and a $26,320 contract was awarded to JEN Mechanical Inc. of Alton, for ventilation.\n\nFunding for the SDM project will come from existing donated funds, equipment use fees and local operations funds. The budget for the project was originally set at $1.1 million but the bids came in substantially lower. The project is expected to be complete by the end of summer.\n\nAn increased demand for care has created a long waiting list for oral surgery. This renovation will provide the ability to accommodate the increase in patient volume and enhance the education of students and residents in the area of oral surgery. The renovation project also will include installation of an emergency backup power system for three oral surgery operatories, four regular operatories and support systems for these areas. In the event of a power outage, the emergency backup system would provide temporary power to safely complete any patient procedures in progress.\n\nIn other business today, the SIU Board approved planning for one project and approved another project, both at the SIUE National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC). The Board gave planning approval for laboratory expansion and gave project and budget approval for renovation of the NCERC's distillation and dehydration systems, which is estimated to cost $1.5 million. The latter will be funded through a grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. Costs are still to be determined for the lab expansion. The lab expansion plans call for adding fermentation wet labs, analytical wet labs, additional office area and support space. The renovation of the distillation and dehydration systems calls for boosting the capacity of the systems by replacing and upgrading several of the system's components.\n\nToday, the Board also approved planning for resurfacing of South University Drive from Stadium Drive to the existing overlay north of Parking Lot No. 1. In addition, the Board approved a $1.68 million increase in SIUE's advertising budget in the Office of Marketing and Communication to add additional print marketing as well as increased cable television, radio and network television spots as well as additional billboard marketing. Actual costs will be dependent on the competitive bids solicited and awarded in accordance with University purchasing policies.\n\nBack to top\n\n2/11/09\n\nSIUE's Black Theater Workshop To Be Presented Feb. 20-22\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.)

Anton Chekhov was a gifted playwright who created memorable characters in four major plays, none of which could be considered comedies (except, perhaps, Uncle Vanya, which usually is referred to as a tragicomedy). But Chekhov never met playwright Jane Martin, either.\n\nAnton in Show Business, the next offering in Southern Illinois University Edwardsville's 2008-09 Main stage season, has been called a \"savage, savvy backstage comedy\" and is Martin's take on a troupe of actors performing Chekhov's Three Sisters in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nMartin's Anton first burst on the scene in 2000 at the Humana Festival of New American Plays in Louisville, Ky., where most of the playwright's works have premiered over the years. SIUE offers its version of the madcap comedy at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday, Feb. 25-28, and at 2 p.m. Sunday, March 1, all in the theater at SIUE's Katherine Dunham Hall.\n\nIn 2001, the play won the American Theatre Critics Steinberg New Play Award. Critics have called it a \"remorseless\" look into life in the theater as Martin skewers all the usual stereotypes and, as one critic put it, the playwright \"satirizes, celebrates, and challenges the importance of theatre as an art form today.\"\n\nDirector Peter Cocuzza, who is putting together SIUE's production, says the \"play within a play\" uses several theatrical conventions that promise a delightful evening of comedy. \"First of all, women play all the roles, which makes a statement about how the theater industry is so male dominated,\" Cocuzza said. \"Martin also pokes fun at funding for the arts from corporations or the lack thereof. Also, someone in the audience keeps interrupting the play, which is very funny. In fact, the play breaks the 'fourth wall' quite a bit.\"\n\nCocuzza said he was looking for a comedy to direct and decided on Anton because of the number of female students in the department who are very talented. \"We have so many talented women in our performance major and this play had the most promise. It has wonderful character roles.\"\n\nHe explains the three characters playing the sisters are quite interesting-one is an actress who is trying to make a comeback, one is a Hollywood starlet who has been told her career will be enhanced if she does more theater, and the third has no experience whatsoever. \"They all have similar hopes and dreams,\" Cocuzza said, \"but there are many twists and turns in this play. For those in the audience who are Chekhov aficionados, they will find plenty of parallels between this play and the works of Anton Chekhov. But the play also appeals on basic levels to all audiences,\" he said.\n\nCocuzza also pointed out that the play will be presented without \"blackouts\" and will occur in continuous action. \"There will also be what we're calling 'ninjas,' members of the crew dressed in black coming off and on stage, bringing in set pieces and props as the action keeps continuing. For example, if a character is sitting down, a chair will suddenly appear in place. The play has a Brecht-Ian feel to it in that way. And, if we do it well, it will be seamless and a joy to watch.\"\n\nTickets are $10; senior citizens and SIUE retirees, $8; SIUE faculty and staff, $6; non-SIUE students, $6; and SIUE students with a valid Cougar ID, no admission charge. Contact the SIUE Fine Arts box office, (618) 650-2774, for tickets or more information.\n\nClick on numbers at right for photos suitable for print: Photos 1 | 2 The cast of Anton includes (in Photo No. 1) Sarah Jones (seated at the table), of St. Louis, who plays three characters, and (above) the three actresses who play the sisters (from left): Anna Skidis, of Glen Carbon, as Casey; Emily Reutebuch, of Granite City, as Lisabette; and Angie Svec, of Belleville, as Holly.

Margaret A. \"Peg\" Simons, professor of philosophy and chair of that department, and Leah C. O'Brien, professor of chemistry, are each recipients of the 2009 Distinguished Research Professor Award from the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Graduate School. The award is an academic rank awarded to SIUE faculty members to recognize outstanding and sustained contributions to research and creative activities.\n\nSimons has sustained an extraordinary record of research activities since her promotion to professor in 1990 and brings national and international recognition to her department. She has maintained the highest level of professional development and has steadfastly pursued her scholarly research independently and through internally and externally funded projects, including two from the prestigious National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nShe has been acclaimed one of the most important scholars writing about the philosophy and life of Simone de Beauvoir. Since 1990 she has given 15 international, 35 national, 10 regional and eight local presentations. Simons' academic record clearly demonstrates that her research and publications have had a tremendous impact on the field, her students and the public. External reviewers of Simons' credentials have provided unequivocally strong evidence of the high quality of her work. These reviewers stated that \"Beauvoir scholarship in the United States owes more to Peg Simons than to any other individual.\"\n\nCarlin Romano, writing in The Philadelphia Inquirer, refers to Simons as \"America's leading Beauvoir scholar.\" Many of these reviewers say she is a \"pioneer … to whose writings over the past 20 years all philosophers taking part in the current [Beauvoir] renaissance are deeply indebted.\" Her work is called \"path breaking\" and \"fundamental\" in Feminist Studies, a highly respected interdisciplinary journal in the broad areas of theory, philosophy, culture, history and literature.\n\nSimons continues to publish, most recently a 2008 article appearing in France and a 2009 book publication, her edition of Beauvoir's Wartime Diary. Her continuing enthusiastic commitment to her research on Beauvoir's philosophy promises to continue to bring advances in knowledge within the discipline of philosophy and international recognition for SIUE.\n\nO'Brien was promoted to professor in 2001 and has brought broad acclaim to her department. Like Simons, O'Brien has pursued her independent research activities through both internally and externally funded projects that have earned her national and international recognition. She has received research funding from two of the most prestigious research agencies in the field of Chemistry: the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the American Chemical Society. She is highly respected in the international field of gas-phase spectroscopy and her work has relevance to many broader areas of science. O'Brien also regularly publishes in mainstream international journals.\n\nSince 2001, O'Brien has published 15 articles, all in pre-eminent journals in her field, and presented at the most prestigious conferences in all of chemistry. She has been asked to use her expertise in chemistry and science in general to review articles submitted to the Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy, the Journal of Physical Chemistry and to review proposals submitted to the NSF. Her academic record clearly demonstrates her research and publications have had a tremendous impact on the field, her students and the public.\n\nExternal reviewers of O'Brien's credentials have provided unequivocally strong evidence of the high quality of her work. One reviewer stated, for example, that \"she has become one of the leading experts in the spectroscopy of small metal containing molecules and has made many important contributions to the field. She has maintained a steady and consistently high level of quality research and is widely known and respected in the international spectroscopy community.\"\n\nAnother review stated that \"her research is on the cutting edge of her profession.\" Noting the exceptionally outstanding NSF panel reviews of her proposals, another reviewer stated: \"this level of commendation is the highest praise a scientist in this country can hope to achieve.\"\n\nBack to top\n\n2/10/09\n\nG. Pelekanos Wins Annual Hoppe Research Professorship\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.) George Pelekanos, associate professor of mathematics and statistics at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, is this year's winner of the Hoppe Research Professor Awards made annually to SIUE faculty members to recognize and support individual programs of research or creative activities. These awards recognize faculty members whose research or creative activities have the promise of making significant contributions to their fields of study.\n\nPelekanos, who has been with SIUE since 1998, received the Hoppe Award for his research project in the area of computational electromagnetics, \"On the Development of a Fast and Efficient Reconstruction Algorithm in Computational Electromagnetics.\" Computational Electromagnetics is the science of numerically solving a complex set of Maxwell's equations using limited computer resources. These solutions describe the physical interactions and phenomena between charged particles and materials. A fundamental understanding of these phenomena are critical in the design of many devices such as radar, computer chips, optical fiber systems, and mobile phone systems.\n\nThe Hoppe project will lay the foundation for long-term research that will result in the development of fast and efficient codes capable of resolving many of the current and future computational electromagnetic problems faced by the U. S. Air Force. Overall, this interdisciplinary work brings together computer science, applied mathematics and electromagnetic theory, and it portends the creation of a new and important technology not previously available.\n\nPelekanos earned a doctorate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Delaware in 1997. During the following year, he was a postdoctoral research associate at the Center of Computational Electromagnetics in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He has published more than 20 articles in the areas of inverse scattering, computational electromagnetics and mathematics education. His research has appeared in leading journals in his field. His main research interests include solving forward and inverse problems in elastodynamics, electromagnetics and acoustics, and he is currently working on fast algorithms for solving electromagnetic scattering and inverse problems.\n\nSIUE's Hoppe Research Professorship Awards, administered through the SIUE Graduate School, are designed to support a significant and discrete portion of a faculty member's larger research agenda. The Hoppe Research Professor is appointed for a two-year period, during which he or she receive 50 percent assigned time for research each academic year, the services of a one-quarter time graduate assistant and $1,000 in support.\n\nBack to top\n\n2/9/09\n\nSchool Of Education To Co-Sponsor Math-Science Summer Camps\n\n(EDWARDSVILLE, Ill.)
