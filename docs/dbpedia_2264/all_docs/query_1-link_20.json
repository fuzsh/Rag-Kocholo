        "text": "Highland Hospital, Rochester, NY\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Archive of the Highland Hospital provides a documentary and photographic record of the Highland Hospital (Rochester, N.Y.), its predecessor the Hahnemann Hospital, and the hospital’s School of Nursing. The bulk of the material in this collection spans the years 1890 to 1980. The archive was transferred from the John R. Williams Library of the Highland Hospital to the Edward G. Miner Library of the University of Rochester Medical Center in the summer of 2015. Processing the collection was completed in June 2016. The Archive of the Highland Hospital is arranged in three series described below in the organization summary. It is contained in 74 boxes and 57 volumes occupying sixty-six linear feet. Researchers will also find material on the Highland Hospital among the papers of John Ralston Williams, M.D., who headed the Division of Medicine at Highland between 1906 and 1936.\n\nHighland Hospital circa 1900-1910\n\nEarly History\n\nHahnemann Hospital was established in 1889 in Rochester, N.Y. by physicians belonging to what might be termed the purist faction of American homeopathy, i.e., those who strictly adhered to therapeutic principles strictly defined in Samuel Hahnemann’s Organon, first published at Dresden in 1810. These disciples of homoeopathic orthodoxy were opposed locally by a more eclectic group of homeopathic practitioners who incorporated any form of medical treatment that proved effective.\n\nLong denied consulting and admitting privileges at Rochester City Hospital, the city’s principal hospital in the 19th century, both divisions of Rochester’s homeopathic medical community sought to establish their own institutions. Thus, by by the end of the 19th century, Rochester had two homeopathic hospitals. The Hahnemann Homoeopathic Hospital was organized by the purist faction and opened its doors in April 1889 on the site of the Selden homestead on Rockingham Street near Highland Park. (In 1891 it was renamed Hargous Memorial Hahnemann Hospital, and in 1902 again renamed the Hahnemann Hospital.) In September 1889, the eclectic faction opened the Rochester Homoeopathic Hospital on Monroe Ave. (In 1926 this became the Genesee Hospital.)\n\nBoth institutions prospered. Both expanded their physical facilities, introduced new technologies (e.g., x-rays, improved surgical units), and established training schools for nurses. Both hospitals adopted innovations in laboratory medicine, radiography, pharmacotherapeutics and surgery that not only narrowed the distinctions between homeopathic purists and eclectics, but between homeopaths and the regular medical profession. This dissolution of the differences between homeopathic and regular medicine was evidenced at Hahnemann Hospital by the appointment in 1906 of an allopathic or regular physician, John Ralston Williams, to head the hospital’s Division of Medicine. The hospital’s final link with homeopathy was severed in 1921 when the Board of Directors voted to change the institution’s name to the Highland Hospital.\n\nThe expansion of the Hospital’s patient care, research and educational programs is reflected in the institution’s steady structural growth, especially from 1902 to 1913, from 1924 to 1940, from 1960 to 1978, and from the 1990s to the present. The Training School for Nurses provides an excellent example of growth within the institution. Established in 1891 as a two-year program, the curriculum was extended to three years when the school was registered with the Board of Regents of the State of New York in 1904. A new Nurses’ Residence was built in 1912 to accommodate an increasing number of students. Additions were made to the residence in 1927 and 1930, and the entire structure was replaced with a new building in 1960. The previous year, the Nursing Education Building with classrooms and modern teaching laboratories was completed. These facilities served the Highland Hospital School of Nursing until its final class graduated in 1979.\n\nIn the late 1990s the Highland Hospital became affiliated with the University of Rochester Medical Center. This more recent period of the Hospital’s history is not documented in the collection.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE HIGHLAND HOSPITAL ARCHIVES\n\nThis collection is arranged in three series:\n\nFirst Series: Documents generated by the Hahnemann Hospital and its successor the Highland Hospital\n\nSecond Series: Documents generated by the Highland Hospital School of Nursing\n\nThird Series: Photographs of the Hospital and its nursing school from the late 19th- through the late 20th-centuries\n\nDietary, circa 1918-22\n\nFIRST SERIES: HAHNEMANN HOSPITAL & HIGHLAND HOSPITAL\n\nHahnemann Hospital: Miscellaneous Documents (1st Series, Box 1)\n\nThis single box contains a variety of documents of historical interest, most notably: drafts of essays on the early history of the Hahnemann Hospital (Folders 1-2); documents pertaining to its incorporation (Folders 4-5, 11); the first annual report (Folder 10); a pamphlet published pre-1920 describing the Training School for Nurses (Folder 21), etc.\n\nHighland Hospital: Miscellaneous Documents (1st Series, Boxes 2-7)\n\nIt would be difficult to easily categorize these documents, as they do not represent any continuous record series generated within the Highland Hospital. Nonetheless, there is much material of historical interest in these six boxes, the content of which is arranged alphabetically by department or by topic.\n\nBoard of Directors Minutes (Vols. 2-38)\n\nThe minutes of the Board of Directors (and the several committees that reported directly to the Board) are the longest continuous subseries in the Highland Hospital archive. They provide an invaluable summary of the issues facing a private hospital in the United States over the sixty-plus years chronicled in these documents. The minutes of the Board of Directors are contained in twenty-three bound volumes (1932-1985) and fifteen three-ring binders (1982-1994). They include the minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors, its Executive Committee, the Joint Conference Committee, the Finance Committee, and committees established later as the operation of the hospital became increasingly complex (e.g., the Property Committee, the Long-Range Planning Committee, etc.). Included with the minutes are agendas, internal reports, departmental reports, correspondence, financial summaries, service statistics, etc.\n\nMinutes of Administrative Committees in 3-Ring Binders (Vols. 39-54)\n\nThese sixteen three-ring binders include the minutes of two committees designated as “administrative committees” not directly responsible to the Board of Directors: i.e., the Operations Committee (1979-1978) and the Patient Care Committee (1968-1992).\n\nMiscellaneous Administrative, Planning & Financial Documents in 3-Ring Binders (Volumes 55-59)\n\nThese four binders include Price Waterhouse audit statements (1967-1988), a decade of President’s reports (1980-1990), the Long-Range Plan issued in 1985, and the certificate of need for the Highland Living Center (1992).\n\nDepartmental Objectives & Annual Reports (1st Series, Boxes 8-10)\n\nA collection of departmental annual reports issued between 1971 and 1984.\n\nHighland Hospital Publications (1st Series, Boxes 11-20)\n\nBy far the largest portion of the publications subseries is represented by newsletters intended to provide both staff and the public information regarding developments and events within the Hospital. As a chronicle of the Hospital’s long history, they remain an essential resource for historical research. It is possible to trace an almost unbroken series of Highland newsletters from the end of the 19th century to the present. These newsletters underwent title and format changes, but remained essentially unchanged in purpose – beginning with the Hahnemann Advocate (1891-1921) and continuing with the Highland Advocate (1921-1927), the Highland Hospital Newsletter (1937), the Highland Hospital Bulletin (1941-1947), Highland Highlights (1951-1959), Highland Hilites (1960-1976), Highland Highlights again (1979-1984), Highland Highlites (1985-1987), Highland Hospital Highlites (1988-1991), and Highland Highlights once more (2004-present).\n\nOther newsletters include the Nursing Newsletter (2005-present) and several staff only newsletters. The publications subseries also includes “other publications” in Boxes 19-20, e.g., annual reports, employee handbooks, recruitment brochures, and patient-oriented material.\n\nNewspaper Clippings (1st Series, Boxes A-D)\n\nThe five flat boxes in this subseries consists of clippings regarding Hahnemann Hospital, the Hahnemann Hospital Training School for Nurses, Highland Hospital, and its School of Nursing that appeared in the Rochester, N.Y. newspapers between 1890 and 2000.\n\nOversize Paper Miscellanea (1st Series, Boxes E-F)\n\nMen's Ward, 1906\n\nSECOND SERIES: SCHOOL OF NURSING\n\nSchool of Nursing Annual Bulletin (2nd Series, Box 1)\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, every nursing, medical, dental and pharmacy school in the United issued an annual bulletin or catalog that announced the upcoming academic year and provided essential information regarding faculty, the curriculum, admission requirements, fees, etc. The earliest annual bulletin for the Hahnemann Hospital Training School present in this collection was issued just after World War I (Folder 1). There are no bulletins published earlier in the collection, and there may have been none – apart from the undated pamphlet in the 1st Series, Box 1, Folder 21. Bulletins issued during the 1920s are rather spotty. The collection is fairly complete between 1930 and 1979.\n\nSchool of Nursing Committee Minutes (2nd Series, Boxes 2-4)\n\nDocumentation regarding the earliest decades of the Training School for Nurses is lacking in this and the other subseries. The earliest documents describing the operation of the nursing school are the minutes of the School of Nursing Committee, 1932-1938 (Box 2, Folders 1-7). Post-World War II, this documentation continues in the minutes of the Nursing School Council, 1946-49 (Box 2, Folders 8-9), the School of Nursing Education Committee, 1949-55 (Box 2, Folder 10), the School of Nursing Advisory Committee, 1956-63 (Folder 11), and the faculty meeting minutes, 1959-77 (Box 2, Folder 12-Box 3, Folder 2). Other committees in this subseries include minutes of the Admissions Committee, the Curriculum Committee, the Nurses Residence Committee, etc.\n\nSchool of Nursing Documents Arranged Alphabetically by Name of Corporate Entity (2nd Series, Boxes 5-8)\n\nThese four boxes contain documents pertaining to the School of Nursing’s interactions with various corporate entities. These include material on the accreditation of the School of Nursing by the National League for Nursing, 1954-76 (Box 5, Folder 10-Box 6, Folder 9), reports and correspondence with the New York State Department of Education (Box 7, Folder 1-Box 8, Folder 6), affiliation agreements with various local institutions (e.g., Rochester State Hospital, Monroe Community College), etc.\n\nSchool of Nursing Documents Arranged Alphabetically by Topic (2nd Series, Boxes 9-10)\n\nThese two boxes contain internal documents on the operation of the School of Nursing arranged alphabetically by topic. Notable among the documents in this subseries are the annual reports of the Director of Nursing, 1930-55 (Box 9, Folders 1-3), and the monthly logs of the School of Nursing, 1957-63 (Box 9, Folder 15-Box 10, Folder 5).\n\nSchool of Nursing Graduates Card File\n\nThis two-drawer steel card file contains hundreds of 4” x 6” cards for students who graduated from the School of Nursing from the late 1890s into the 1970s. Each card includes the student’s name (and often her married name), year of graduation, pin number, address, religion, prior education, etc. These cards comprise the most complete record extant of the hundreds of students who graduated from the Hahnemann Hospital Training School for Nurses and the Highland Hospital School of Nursing.\n\nAlumnae Association Card File\n\nThis single-drawer steel card file contains 4” x 6” cards for nursing school graduates who belonged to the Alumnae Association. These cards are useful for tracking down the maiden name of a graduate when only her married name is known.\n\nSchool of Nursing Student Records, A-C (2nd Series, Boxes 11-14)\n\nThis subseries represents what remains of what must have been a complete collection of student records for the Highland Hospital School of Nursing. These four boxes contain the records of students whose surnames at time of enrollment began with the letters A, B and C. The bulk of these records span the years 1940-1970, though there may be some records earlier and later. It appears that even this partial alphabetical series is incomplete. A student’s records in these files might include her application for admission to the School of Nursing, her secondary school records, the essay she wrote to explain why she wanted to pursue a career in nursing, student progress reports, reports from institutions where the student may have done affiliate hospital work during training, post-graduation correspondence regarding transcripts, etc.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: THE STUDENT FILES IN BOXES 11-14 ARE CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC UNTIL 2025\n\nAnatomy class, 1940s\n\nMiscellaneous Documents Pertaining to Specific Class Years (2nd Series, Boxes 15-16)\n\nThese two boxes contain documents pertaining to specific classes and their graduation, e.g., graduation invitations, programs for graduation ceremonies, lists of class members, etc.\n\nSchool of Nursing Yearbooks (2nd Series, Boxes 17-19)\n\nThese boxes contain a complete or nearly complete collection of School of Nursing yearbooks issued under varying titles between 1928 and 1979. It is assumed that some classes did not issue a yearbook.\n\nHighland Fling (2nd Series, Box 20)\n\nThe Highland Fling was an internal newsletter composed, typewritten and prepared by nursing students between October 1944 and June 1949. Issued monthly during the academic year, this in-house publication contains brief articles on academic and social activities, brief news items about individual students (e.g., engagements, news about fiancés or boyfriends in the military), humorous poems, reflections on student life, etc.\n\nNursing Student Photo Albums and Scrapbooks (2nd series, Boxes 21-29)\n\nThis is visually one of the most engaging collections in the second series. It consists of fourteen photo albums or scrapbooks maintained by student nurses between 1917 and 1949. No other material in this collection more accurately reflects the lives of these young women than this collection of photographs and ephemera. The content of each album is described in detail in the container list.\n\nSchool of Nursing Diplomas, Uniforms and Memorabilia (Boxes G-M)\n\nStudent nurses circa 1900-1910\n\nTHIRD SERIES: COMBINED PHOTOGRAPHIC COLLECTION\n\nPhotographic Portraits (3rd Series, Boxes 1-4)\n\nArranged alphabetically by subject’s name, this series contains portraits of medical, nursing and other hospital staff. Most of the photographs in this subseries were taken between 1950 and 1980, though some images date before or after this period.\n\nPhotographs Arranged Alphabetically by Topic (3rd Series, Boxes 5-11)\n\nThe photographs in this subseries are arranged alphabetically by subject, e.g., Aerial Views, Dietary, Exterior Views of Hospital, Laboratories, Nurses’ Residence, Patient Care, Surgery, etc. Included in this series are group photographs for graduating classes (Box 9, Folder 3-Box 10, Folder 3).\n\nHighland Hospital Oversize Photographs (3rd Series, Box 12)\n\nThis box contains photographic prints too large to file in the topical subseries.\n\nSchool of Nursing Oversize Photographs (3rd Series, Box 13)\n\nThis box for the most part contains oversize class portraits.\n\nContainer List\n\nFIRST SERIES – HAHNEMANN HOSPITAL & HIGHLAND HOSPITAL\n\nFirst Series, Box One – Hahnemann Hospital Miscellaneous Documents\n\nFolder 1: History of Hahnemann Hospital by Isabel Dale (undated manuscript)\n\nFolder 2: Various notes on the history of Hahnemann Hospital\n\nFolder 3: “An appeal to the friends of homoeopathy” [circular printed late 1880s]\n\nFolder 4: Incorporation of the Hahnemann Hospital (Feb 1889)\n\nFolder 5: Articles of incorporation (Apr 1889)\n\nFolder 6: Miscellaneous correspondence (1889)\n\nFolder 7: List of patients who have occupied the Hargoss free bed (1889-90)\n\nFolder 8: Notebook on property (1889-1914)\n\nFolder 9: Report of Executive Committee (Apr 1890)\n\nFolder 10: First annual report (1890)\n\nFolder 11: Hargoss Memorial Hahnemann Hospital.

The earliest, largest and perhaps most interesting of the pre-1930 student photoalbums, this volume includes mounted photographs taken between 1914 and 1916 of buildings, operating rooms, house staff, nursing staff, and nursing students in both casual and working situations. Obituaries and other newspaper clippings through the 1960s are pasted alongside the photos.\n\nScrapbook and photo album of Sabra E. Andrews, Class of 1925 (46 leaves; 19 x 29 cm.). Compiled between 1925 and 1930, this album includes newspaper clippings, ephemera, photographs, and numerous poems on romantic themes handwritten in white ink against the the album’s black leaves.

This album was donated in June 2000 by Mrs. Jeanne Cooper, Merritt Island, Florida. It had belonged to her aunt Lucy H. Robbins, Class of 1925, who in turn may have received it from classmate Lucy J. Wilson. The provenance is confusing, because Wilson graduated in 1923, yet printed name cards for ten members of the Class of 1925 are pasted on a leaf midway through the album. The album is comprised of numerous unlabeled photos of nursing students, as well as buildings, classrooms, and photos taken at the Infants’ Summer Hospital in Charlotte, N.Y.\n\nFolder 7: One of two photo albums donated by Mary Braman Wilson, Class of 1926 (19 leaves; 15 x 20 cm.).
