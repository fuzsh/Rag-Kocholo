He speaks English, Igbo, and Ibibio. Chidi has three siblings. Having lost his mother to surgery for fibroid, he became passionate about medicine, especially as it relates to women and children.

Codesigned with youth, new immigrants, and working families, Jahn’s civic-scale projects have engaged millions both on the street and at venues such as the Museum of Modern Art, the Venice Biennale of Architecture, the United Nations, Tribeca Film Festival, and Obama’s White House. Her public artwork, civic media tools, films, architectural and urban-scale collaborations have been supported by The New York Times, the BBC, PBS, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, Univision Global, Hyperallergic, Art in America, Architectural Review, CNN, and hundreds more. She has received grants and awards from National Endowment for the Arts, Rockefeller Foundation, Creative Capital, Open Society, Tribeca Film Institute, Anonymous Was A Woman, and more. In 2008, she embarked on creating the artwork / literacy movement “Bibliobandido” (Book Bandit) with a community in rural Honduras. This project centers around the eponymous character, a bandit who EATS stories and whose fame rivals Santa Claus. As a living legend still active today, Bibliobandido has transformed the lives of 20,000 young believers in Central and North America. In 2022, Jahn and award-winning filmmaker Benjamin Murray began shooting their Sundance-supported documentary film chronicling the impact of the beloved, story-hungry villain. For another civic-scale artwork called “CareForce” (2010-present), Jahn collaborated with the National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA) to create a social practice artwork including a PBS film that amplifies care workers' voices. This movement for domestic workers’ rights has contributed to new laws in 10 states and a federal bill underway. NDWA co-founder Ai-jen Poo writes, “CareForce harnesses the catalytic power of art, architecture, and storytelling to dream bigger, dream futures into being that we’ve never experienced and create new protagonists.” In 2020, “CareForce” informed the creation of “Carehaus,” an artwork that is also the U.S.’s first care-based co-housing building designed with architect Rafi Segal. The Biden administration and U.S. Congresspeople interviewed Jahn regarding the possibility of proliferating the “Carehaus” model across the country. With Segal, Jahn co-authored the related book “Design & Solidarity” (Columbia University Press, 2023). Jahn has taught at Columbia University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (her alma mater), and Parsons/The New School, where she is the Director of Integrated Design. She was a 2022 Sundance Fellow a Senior Researcher at MIT, and an artist in residence at the National Public Housing Museum.\n\njessica susan oler is an Black American Conceptual artist. oler was born and raised in Davis, California. She attended Sacramento City College where she earned three Associates Degrees in Social Science, Liberal Arts, and Sociology. In addition to this she earned her Bachelor's Degree in Sociology from San Francisco State University in 2014 and her Master's Degree in Fine Arts from California College of the Arts in 2019. As of late oler has earned admittance into the Doctoral Gender Studies Program at Queen's University under the supervision of Dr. Katherine Mckittrick come Fall 2023. oler's work has been shown at California College of the Arts; Chautauqua and Brooklyn, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Miami, Florida; Lawrenceville and Atlanta, Georgia; Alameda, Oakland, and San Francisco, California; and Alexandria, New South Wales, Australia. jessica oler produces artworks in two-dimensional conceptual abstract format, video, photographic series, installation, and time-based work. As her practice shape shifts and expands she continues to lean into conceptual abstraction. Her process of constructing, deconstructing, and reconfiguring her original photographic prints continue to prove to be a way to work through the literal and figurative magnitude of the concepts that are approached. oler's multidisciplinary practice grapples with larger systemic quandaries that address patient narrative, medical racism, and black geography. As her work weaves in and out of the personal and political, the intrinsic interconnectedness of both are apparent. In oler's 2019 Untitled 12' x 12' photographic installation, she explored the inseparable history of American lynchings with a specific focus on the lynching of Mary Turner. During the summer of that year, oler built the first iteration of Big Bodies, a photographic installation built with her original photography in conversation with the Atlantic Slave Trade. This work was particularly significant as it was built alongside live double bass instrumentation. In 2021, oler was invited by Harvard Medical School to write her narrative surrounding her diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. This invite proved to be an expansive, groundbreaking invitation that opened the door to ethnography for her practice. As oler continues to move forward with her personhood, politic, and artistic practice the vastness of multi-disciplinarity continues to be a guiding force.\n\nKean O’Brien is a transgender, chronically ill, and disabled artist living between Chicago and Los Angeles.
