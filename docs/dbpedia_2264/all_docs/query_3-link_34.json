        "text": "WALTER T. PARKES\n\nChairman of the Board\n\nWalter Parkes has nearly 60 years experience in the electrical construction business. Through his extensive industry knowledge, strong leadership, and entrepreneurial vision for future opportunities and growth, Mr. Parkes has helped build O’Connell Electric into the successful organization it is today—one of the largest, highest ranked electrical contractors in the country. He has held the position of Chairman since 2006.\n\nWalter started as a teenager, working the stockroom at T.H. Green, an electrical construction company founded by his grandfather, Thomas Green. Walt worked his way through the ranks to become chief estimator of the company, and in 1968 attempted to buy the business. Outbid by a competitor, Walt turned his sites to O’Connell Electric, which he purchased that same year from John O’Connell. Some years later, O’Connell Electric purchased the assets of T.H. Green.\n\nToday, Mr. Parkes remains highly active in the construction industry as well as in the community. His services include being board member of the Pluta Cancer Center, board member of the Electrical Licensing Board for the City of Rochester, past president of the Rochester Builders Exchange, past president and governor of the Finger Lakes New York Chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA), past governor of the Northeastern Line Constructors Chapter, former vice president of NECA District 10 where he represented all line contractors within the national association, former chairman of the Electrical Contracting Foundation from 1996 to 1998, and being co-chair for the Council of Industrial Relations.\n\nIn recognition of his business achievements and contributions to the community, Mr. Parkes has been honored to receive induction into the Rochester Business Hall of Fame in 2006, the National Electrical Contractors Association’s (NECA) prestigious James H. McGraw award in 1995, the Comstock award in 2005, the Electrical Contracting Foundation Wendt award for exemplary leadership and service, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from Rochester Builders Exchange in 2003.\n\nTHOMAS W. PARKES\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nAs Chief Executive Officer, Tom Parkes is responsible to oversee and lead the company in executing strategic initiatives, general corporate decision-making, growth of divisions, management of financial decisions and responsibility for the well-being of the company’s workforce. Among his list of critical short- and long-term priorities is to build on our success in recruiting and training top talent by establishing more strategic and creative recruiting programs to attract employees to the firm.\n\nMr. Parkes draws on 48-plus years of experience in the electrical construction industry to manage operations at O’Connell. A fourth generation construction professional, Tom worked his way up through the ranks of the company, beginning as an electrician’s apprentice, advancing to journeyman electrician, master electrician, and eventually project manager.\n\nMr. Parkes’ hands-on design, planning, construction, and management experience spans electrical construction projects of all types and sizes across every industry. Tom demonstrated his proficiency as a project manager across a range of jobs in diverse markets through the 1980s and 90s—industrial plants and manufacturing facilities, military bases, prisons, colleges and universities, hospitals, airports, water treatment plants—from electrical construction work to fire and security systems, to transmission and distribution work. In 1999, Tom managed the $30 million Franklin Correctional Facility project, that required the orchestration of over 150 electricians.\n\nTom is a trustee of the Apprentice Committee of IBEW Local 1249 and board member of the YMCA.\n\nMichael PARKES\n\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer\n\nA fifth-generation electrical construction professional, Michael serves as President and Chief Operating Officer of O’Connell Electric Company. Michael is responsible for focusing on long-term strategy, external relationships, and high-level decision making as well as maintaining oversight of day-to-day operations and execution of projects.\n\nBefore assuming the role as president and COO at O’Connell Electric, Michael spent more than ten years serving as General Manager of the Power Group where he led the company through exponential growth while expanding O’Connell’s services and capabilities. Before coming to O’Connell Electric, Michael spent time in supervisory roles as an electrical engineer for O’Brien & Gere, and TRC Power Delivery.\n\nMichael received his degree in electrical engineering from Clarkson University and is a licensed professional engineer in the state of New York. He serves as a Kitchen Cabinet Member as well as a High Priority Topics Committee Member for ELECTRI International.\n\nNotable projects O’Connell’s Power Group has completed under Michael’s leadership include Gardenville Substation and the Auburn Transmission Project, both of which won NECA Project Excellence Awards, and the Nik Wallenda highwire acts at Niagara Falls, the Grand Canyon and downtown Chicago.\n\nSUSAN PARKES MCNALLY\n\nExecutive Vice President\n\nMs. McNally fulfills several key management capacities in her varied roles as Executive Vice President of O’Connell Electric. Susan has more than 35 years of construction accounting experience. She manages all of O’Connell’s HR service provisions, policies, and programs as well as the administration and reception departments. In addition to supporting O’Connell’s corporate strategic initiatives, Susan organizes all corporate events and heads-up the company’s philanthropic initiatives. Her contributions in the accounting department, establishing satellite offices, and audit coordination have been instrumental to the O’Connell Company’s success.\n\nMs. McNally is a chief proponent of an underlying principle that embodies O’Connell—commitment—commitment to the company’s core corporate values being realized by our employees, customers, vendors, and the community at large. Through Sue’s leadership and support of the Company’s employee wellness initiative, O’Connell was awarded the Rochester Wealth of Health Award for 2010.\n\nSusan is a founding family member and board member of The Mary M.

Sue was recently named to the board of directors for the University of Rochester Medical Center and is serving on their Quality Care Committee.
