        "text": "Professor John O’Brien leads the Old Age Psychiatry Research Group which is part of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge. His own research focusses on the study of dementia, especially Lewy body dementia, and uses a number of methodologies to try to improve the diagnosis and management of these disorders. In particular, utilising multi-modal imaging with MRI, MEG and novel PET and fluid markers to study pathophysiological processes and develop biomarkers for diagnosis and disease progression, and conduct clinical trials to improve patient management. We study the common cases of dementia in later life, so as well as Lewy body dementia we study Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, and their prodromes and preclinical stages, as well as closely related conditions like late life depression. We have close links with other departments in Cambridge, especially Clinical Neurosciences, and the Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre as well as Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust. We collaborate widely with other groups, including within the UK and internationally, through many routes including the Dementias Platform UK, the NIHR Dementia Translational Research Collaboration, the European DLB Group and the International DLB Consortium."
