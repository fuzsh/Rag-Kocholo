The MPCC has agreed to affiliate with UIC, a new American-style liberal arts college on the Chinese mainland near Hong Kong.

While Kwok is on campus there will be opportunity for interested faculty, staff, and retirees to meet with him at 9:30 a.m. Monday, May 21, in the Office of International Education.

Everyone interacted beautifully with the public and the media. The College received extensive national and regional media coverage equivalent, I'm told, to thousands of dollars. (Details are in this issue's In the Media section.) And, going back well before the bloom, Brian O'Brien's blogs and the webcam images were fascinating for thousands of remote learners around the globe. In fact, the corpse flower website drew more than 150,000 page views.\n\nWe had little warning that the flower would bloom at this busy time of year, yet you all pulled together quickly to make it work. There is not room to acknowledge every essential effort, so thank you each for the indispensable role you played. You are, collectively, incredible.\n\nFinally, a big thanks to \"Perry,\" who is now officially a member of the Gustavus community.\n\nThanks so very much,\n\nJim Peterson\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nChapel Schedule...
