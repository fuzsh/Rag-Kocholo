Assessing the potential of sharing and repairing consumer items as a path to sustainability\n\nThe “sharing and circular economy” has influenced practices in many sectors over the past decade. For example, there has been a growth in the sharing and repairing of consumer products, through various mechanisms, e.g. tool libraries and repair cafes. While these models have been viewed by many as sustainable alternatives to productivism and consumerism, the costs and benefits of have not been assessed.\n\nThe purpose of this project is to quantify and compare the social, economic and environmental impacts of producing, owning, sharing and repairing common consumer items, in order to assess the sustainability potential of the sharing economy.\n\nIs there a business case for family-friendly career paths?\n\nThis project will investigate the business case for more diverse career paths for professionals in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields. Specifically, the project will explore how flexible work arrangements (including part-time work and career breaks) affect career opportunities, and under what conditions flexible work arrangements provide benefits in business (to employees and employers) and academic (to staff, research groups, faculties and universities). A range of methodologies are available to the candidate, including interview methods, surveys, data analysis, implicit bias assessment and mathematical/systems modelling. An honours undergraduate degree or masters in science, economics, engineering, social science, psychology or another suitable field is essential. Applicants must have excellent critical thinking skills, demonstrated expertise in quantitative research, and ability to analyse and synthesize information from across a range of disciplines. The successful applicant must obtain a UQ scholarship for domestic students, International Postgraduate Research Scholarship (IPRS) or equivalent, and will receive $ 5 000 per annum top-up scholarship. This scholarship will be awarded for 3.5 years.\n\nRecalcitrant resilience: barriers to sustainability in socio-ecological systems\n\nResilience is the ability of a system to bounce back after disturbance such that core structures and functions are not lost. Resilience is often presumed to be desirable, but that’s not always the case: many entrenched problems are difficult to resolve because the current (unsatisfactory) state is resilient. The health of social and ecological systems is therefore dependent on both their current state and their future trajectory, i.e. their resilience.\n\nThis project explores two intractable problems which exhibit “recalcitrant resilience”, i.e. where change is desired but the status quo is resilient. This approach is based on the recognition than many of the complex challenges facing the world are “wicked problems”, i.e. are complex, contested and subject to high uncertainty. Traditional technocratic solutions are insufficient to address such problems: finding a “solution” and implementing or communicating it is ineffective when key stakeholders have contested certitudes and conflicting world views.\n\nThis project will use participatory modelling and engagement with stakeholders to examine how resilience in social systems inhibits progress in two social-environmental issues: catchment management in the Great Barrier Reef and ocean plastics pollution. Five aspects of resilience will be used to synthesize barriers to sustainable practices: Diversity; Resistance; Recovery; Adaptability and Responsiveness. These attributes of resilience synthesize current knowledge of socio-ecological resilience in a form in which they can be assessed in social systems which are “stuck”. Through analysing five key components of resilience, the project will characterize what makes each situation so “sticky”, and how change might become possible. From this regional issue, the insights will then be applied to a global environmental problem.\n\nThe project will be co-supervised by Dr Angela Dean (UQ/QUT Environmental Social Scientist). Dr Paul Maxwell and Dr Tracy Schultz from Alluvium Consulting will act as external advisors on the project.\n\nModelling sustainable water extraction in Northern Queensland\n\nFreshwater flow and nutrient inputs from catchments into the Gulf of Carpentaria effect estuarine productivity, with flow-on effects on fisheries species, and endangered species. Thus sustained water extraction has the potential to impact the estuaries, and associated ecosystems and economies. Water development is underway in some of these catchments, with plans for further development. In river systems worldwide, unsustainable water extraction has had major impacts on water quality and quantity.\n\nThe purpose of this PhD is to assess how water development in surrounding catchments will affect the health of socio-ecological systems associated with the Gulf of Carpentaria. The project will have four key components: 1. Charactering the system through analysis and synthesis of existing data from the three river catchments and estuaries; 2. Development of a conceptual model for the estuary which includes key processes for health and productivity of socio-ecological systems, including interactions and feedbacks affecting resilience; 3. Engagement with a variety of stakeholder groups, using participatory modelling to collect knowledge from diverse sources; 4.Quantifying critical thresholds for health, productivity and resilience of key socio-ecological systems. Where current knowledge is insufficient to identify thresholds, a method to collect that information will be identified.\n\nThe project will engage with a team of experts from Griffith University (Professor Michele Burford) and Queensland Government agencies"
