        "text": "President's Message\n\nDear Fellow Mohs College members,\n\nIt is an eventful year. The Mohs college board of directors had a productive meeting Sunday, November 13th, in Chicago. Our finances are in good order. The annual meeting next May in Chicago is on track and should be excellent. Progress is being made on obtaining a digitalization system for glass pathology slides to expedite slide review for members who request it. The transition from Mohs College supervision of fellowships to ACGME is moving along with requests for minor adjustments being addressed by the fellowship training committee. Some issues require more attention, see below.\n\nRAC Audits\n\nIt appears that the work-a-round of restrictions on sending tissue on the same day as Mohs surgery is effective. Specifically, if you need to stage a tumor by depth, (melanoma or SCC come to mind) make sure the tissue is removed prior to Mohs surgery, and noted as a biopsy in a separate note in the chart. Your operative note should not say that the debulking layer was sent out for pathologic exam. If a final excision is taken and sent to an outside pathologist, make sure this is not billed for as a stage of Mohs surgery, (in fact it cannot be billed for because of the correct coding initiative) and make sure there is a separate operative note documenting that this tissue was not derived from Mohs surgery. If tissue or slides from a Mohs case need to be reviewed to diagnosis a rare tumor, make sure that your consulting pathologist uses codes 88321, 2, or 3, which are pathology consultation codes for slides or tissue already prepared or examined. These codes should not trigger a RAC audit.\n\nThere are also audits by multiple private carriers over using the -24 and -25 modifiers. Make sure you have at least two chief complaints, with intensity and duration of symptoms, in the chart each visit along with multiple ICD-9 diagnoses.\n\nThere is also a movement afoot by Anthem to cut evaluation and management pay by 50% when a Dermatology procedure is done on the same day. This is inappropriate because the small procedure codes have already been cut by the RUC with this overlapping time factor in mind. The health care Finance Committee and staff are working on a response to this.\n\nAppropriate Use Criteria\n\nThe indications for Mohs surgery went out for review. It is expected very small, uncomplicated, basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, in low risk areas, and in non-immunosuppressed hosts, will not be considered appropriate for Mohs. It is time to start billing destructions, malignant excisions, or malignant excisions with frozen sections for such tumors now, since it will be useful to have a Medicare profile established. Suggested formats for operative notes for excisions with frozens are available at the Mohs college website (http://www.mohscollege.org/acms/AUC/). Excisions with frozens are not just Mohs surgery under another name. You will need a separate log system, different operative notes, and will probably excise and gross them in differently (http://www.mohscollege.org/president/Medicare_utilization_of_the_Mohs_codes.pdf).\n\nThe board will consider the final draft of appropriateness criteria this spring, and assuming they are reasonable, they will be published this summer in the JAAD and online. Appropriate use criteria should hurt our membership little, and will give us much greater credibility when arguing the merits of Mohs surgery with the Relative Value Update Committee, insurers, congress, and bureaucrats.\n\nRelative Value Update Committee\n\nOur efforts to have the Mohs codes pulled from CMS's hit list of expensive codes for RUC review failed. Every specialty in medicine has their most expensive codes on there. We will have to resurvey the 17311 and 17312 codes this spring, or hopefully later in the summer. We will need as many accurate, thoughtful, surveys filled out as is possible. The worst response is to dash through a RUC survey and not give it careful consideration. I recall a memorable example from several years ago, where a Mohs College member insisted he could take a 2.5 cm basal cell carcinoma on the face, do a debulking layer, followed by an entire first stage, map and gross it in, and read the pathology all in 15 minutes. This would result in a valuation of about $75 dollars for the first stage of Mohs. This sort of rushed response drags the results down for everyone.\n\nWhenever a code is reviewed by the RUC, it is usually cut, so be braced for that probability. The worst case scenario would be a 15-20% for the head and neck codes, however, if these codes are cut, expect the trunk and extremity codes to be reviewed and cut next year.\n\nThe laser psoriasis codes are currently being reviewed. If you do these codes, let me know and I will have AAD staff email you a RUC survey.\n\nThe family of complex closures is being surveyed this winter for presentation in April and many of you will be asked to participate. This is an array survey of all the codes and will be tedious. You must make sure all of your colleagues at your institution who do complex closures fill it out as well.\n\nThe 17000 actinic keratosis is also being surveyed, possibly in April.\n\nDermatology has been targeted as overpaid. In truth, we are underappreciated for the cost effective work we do. We must accurately explain our work, via RUC survey, and stand strong against the attacks.\n\nFlorida Mohs Fellowship Only\n\nThe last issue is a thorny one which I wish to meet head on. As you may have heard the Florida Medicare carrier director is considering reimbursing only Mohs surgeons with \"formal\" fellowship training for Mohs surgery. Initially, this would seem to be cause for celebration, but several contrary details have become apparent to the board. You must realize, if this stands, it could be picked up by other carriers, and become \"nationwide\".\n\n1) This policy is directly contrary to the original Medicare law, in which all physicians may bill for any service, and specialty training is specifically not a criterion in the definition of physician. So it probably is illegal. It will very likely be overturned if it is adopted. The ACMS would look self-serving to no good end.\n\n2) The other society also claims to have a \"fellowship\" and they issue certificates, so any restriction will hinge on the word \"formal\". Thus, realistically the only Mohs practitioners to be affected would be billing for Mohs who are not of either society. I don't think there are many of these. These outliers would then join the other society, (because they can't join ours!) increasing their numbers.\n\n3) We have existing over 100 members in good standing in our organization that currently practice Mohs surgery, and never did what could be considered a \"formal\" fellowship, joining the ACMS prior to 1982. These are most of your past presidents, and many of your current fellowship directors. They would be disenfranchised by such a decision.\n\n4) If we support restrictions by training on one procedure, why can't another specialty come back at us and make the same claim against us? Who should be allowed to do complex flaps, grafts, liposuction, and eyelid surgery?\n\nSo at this point in time, I and your board have decided to watch and wait.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBrett M. Coldiron, MD, FACP\n\nPresident, American College of Mohs Surgery\n\n2012 Annual Meeting Preview\n\nGo online in early January to view the following Annual Meeting info\n\nhttp://www.mohscollege.org/annualmeeting/\n\nOnline registration (opening January 12th)\n\nHotel info & links to online booking\n\nRegistration: including Early-Bird reduced registration (through February 20th)\n\nPreliminary programming for the 2012 Annual Meeting\n\nPlanning is well underway to offer a star-studded 2012 Annual Meeting\n\nThanks to the hard work of Chair, Dr. Deborah MacFarlane and the rest of the Scientific Program Committee, there will be numerous guest speakers featured at the Annual Meeting:\n\nThursday\n\nScott E.

A variety of new breakfast session topics will be introduced this year–Improving your publication track record: Editors' recommendations, Dermpath Challenges: An interactive session. Several new plenary sessions have been added: Masters' Pearls, Anatomy of a Lawsuit and Mohs Frozen Section Challenges. A few of the old favorites will be back such as Masters Reconstruction, Coding and Documentation Update, and The Undesirable Result.\n\nThis is shaping up to be an Annual Meeting that you won't want to miss!\n\nThe abstract submission deadline is just around the corner\n\nThe submission deadline is Tuesday, January 10, 2012 at 11:59 pm PST.\n\nTo make your submission visit the ACMS abstract submission website at http://mohscollege2012.abstractcentral.com/ for detailed instructions on how to proceed. Only electronic submissions will be considered for review.\n\nFor research abstracts to be considered, research must be underway at the time of submission and completed in advance of the meeting. Industry, institution, and author(s) names must not be used in the title or body of the abstract(s). Importantly, all accepted abstract authors and presenters must disclose commercial conflicts of interest in the application. Failure to do so will result in forfeiture. Use of institution names will disqualify the abstract for consideration, as this compromises blinded review.

You may access this page at: http://www.mohscollege.org/president/.\n\nThe most recent communications include:\n\nSeptember 2011\n\nUSA Today Article (9/14/11) \"Lack of training can be deadly in cosmetic surgery\"\n\nResponse to USA Today Article from 9.14.11\n\nACMS September RAC Audit Update\n\nAugust 2011\n\nACMS' Response to CMS Regarding Medicare Program; Payment Policies under the Physician Fee Schedule and Other Revisions to Part B for CY2012\n\nAUC on Paraffin Sections in Mohs Surgery\n\nPosition Statement on Appropriate Uses of Paraffin Sections in Association with Mohs Micrographic Surgery\n\nHighlights from the Literature\n\nPhase II study of cetuximab as first-line single-drug therapy in patients with unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Maubec E, Petrow P et al. J Clin Oncol 2011; 29 (26): 3419-3426.\n\nInterest in targeted molecular inhibitors for treatment of advanced skin cancers has surged in recent years. In particular, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, cetuximab, has gained considerable attention as a potential treatment for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC).\n\nThe purpose of this multicenter study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cetuximab as first-line monotherapy in patients with unresectable cSCC. This open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter phase II study was conducted in 10 French medical centers. 36 patients with pathologically confirmed cSCC were enrolled, all with locally advanced surgically unresectable cSCC or metastatic SCC of the skin with documented progression, and all with strong or moderate EGFR expression on immunohistochemistry. Patients received cetuximab IV at an initial dose of 400 mg/m², followed by weekly infusions of 250 mg/ m². The drug could be continued as long as clinical response persisted, even beyond 48 weeks, which was the end of the per-protocol study.\n\nThere were two patient groupings, a per-protocol (PP) group, including patients treated for at least 6 weeks and radiologically evaluable for tumor response, and an intention-to-treat (ITT) group, which included all patients in whom missing an evaluation was defined as failure. There was a male predominance (58%), and the median patient age was 79 years (range 32 to 95 years). 86% of tumors were located on the trunk or extremities. 47% of patients had unresectable local disease, 44% had regional lymph node involvement and 8% had distant metastases. 58% had a history of previous surgery or radiation treatment. High EGFR expression was observed in 72% of patients. No patients with underlying malignancy or other causes of immunosuppression were enrolled.\n\nThe median number of cetuximab infusions administered was 15 (range 1-47 infusions). 3 patients (8%) received only one infusion, 21 patients (58%) received between 6 and 18, and 12 (33%) received more than 18. One patient was still receiving the study drug at week 48 and ultimately received it for 21 months.\n\nThe overall disease control rate in the PP group was 81% and in the ITT group was 69%; their distribution of responses was similar. Half of responses occurred between weeks 6 and 18. In the PP group, 2 patients (6%) had complete responses (CR), 8 (26%) had partial responses (PR), and 15 (48%) had stable disease. The two CR patients maintained their responses 2.5 years after stopping treatment. The median response duration for the patients who achieved a CR or PR was 6.8 months. The most frequent adverse event was an acne-like rash (87% of patients). There was a tendency for prolonged progression-free survival and overall survival in patients who developed an acne-like rash. Of the 61% of patients who reported serious adverse events, 62% were unrelated to cetuximab, 28% were not assessable, and 10% were related to cetuximab. Grade 3 to 4 drug-related serious adverse events led to discontinuation in 4 patients.\n\nThis is the first reported prospective trial of cetuximab in patients with unresectable cSCC. It is notable in that it shows the efficacy of this drug as a single agent first-line treatment in a significant number of patients, including documented cases of long-term response or prolonged stabilization. Larger studies with more standardized dosing protocols are now warranted to confirm that cetuximab may be considered as a therapeutic option for advanced or unresectable cSCC, particularly for elderly patients in whom standard chemotherapy regimens are not appropriate.\n\nDésirée Ratner, MD\n\nColumbia University Medical Center\n\nViewpoints with Jerry Brewer, MD\n\nDr. Jerry Brewer was born and raised in Vernal, Utah, a small town on the Colorado border. Dr. Brewer was raised in a single parent household and attributes most of his accomplishments to the lessons he learned from his mom at an early age. Dr. Brewer attended college at BYU studying Human Biology and Chemical Engineering. After performing a two year religious mission in Brazil, Dr. Brewer attended medical school at Wayne State University School of Medicine and among other things, was student body president and awarded the Penfel Award, the highest award offered at the school given to a medical student that in the opinion of his peers and mentors had mastered the art of excellence in patient care as a medical student. Dr. Brewer then finished an internal medicine internship at Yale and then residency and fellowship at Mayo Clinic. As a resident, Dr. Brewer was awarded the Mayo Brothers Distinguished Fellow Award which is the highest award given to a resident at Mayo Clinic in celebration of excellence in patient care. Dr. Brewer currently practices at Mayo Clinic with a research focus on lymphoma associated skin cancer, supported by a Dermatology Foundation Career Development Award.\n\n1. What sparked your interest in Mohs surgery?\n\nThe precision and detail orientation required.\n\n2. Tell us about your current practice.\n\nI perform surgery 2 days weekly, see patients in clinic 2 days weekly and have 1 day of research protected time currently being sponsored by the dermatology foundation.\n\n3. What do you enjoy most about your practice?\n\nI love being able to cure cancer daily. I love the interactions and relationships with my patients. I am also extremely lucky to have incredible colleagues, and I love the collegiality we share and being able to bounce ideas off of them every once in a while.\n\n4. What do you enjoy least about your practice?\n\nThe blizzards in the winter!\n\n5. Clinically, what do you find challenging at this point?\n\nFinding the best way to manage severely immunosuppressed patients with chances of death due to cutaneous malignancy.\n\n6. What challenges do you foresee the Mohs College and its members facing in the future?\n\nThe formulation of a procedural dermatology board examination that is sanctioned and accepted.\n\n7. What advice would you give fellows just starting practice?\n\nThere are so many great examples of how to practice procedural dermatology in an incredibly efficient, patient oriented, and ethical manner. These people that are giants in our field are so giving of their time and willing to share time and expertise with those of us that are new. My advice would be to build a network of some of the more experienced procedural dermatologists, and then don't hesitate to reach out to them when you struggle with a decision or clinical scenario. Valuable lessons are learned that way that cannot be taught in the classroom!\n\n8. What do you enjoy doing outside of work (professionally)?\n\nPlaying the violin and volunteering at the local prison.\n\n9. What do you enjoy doing outside of work (personally)?\n\nExercising (especially with Jeremy Bordeaux), cooking, learning foreign languages, traveling with my wife, and spending time with my children.\n\n10. What would people be surprised to know about you?\n\nI am a big practical jokester that matured a lot in college. If I had retained some of my teenage spunk, I would probably be the Ashton Kutcher of the Mohs College, finding ways to \"punk\" the prominent Mohs surgeons.\n\nJeremy S. Bordeaux, MD, MPH\n\nPractice Tips and Efficacy Corner\n\nICD-9 Updates\n\nEffective October 1, 2011\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have revised and updated the coding and reporting structure for malignant neoplasms of the skin and other codes pertaining to dermatology in the 2012 International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification 9th Revision (ICD-9-CM).\n\nOut of about 250 changes to the ICD-9-CM codes, there are 40 new codes for malignant neoplasms with new descriptors. These include type specifications such as:\n\nFifth Digit is \"0\" for \"unspecified;\"\n\nFifth digit is 1 for \"basal cell carcinoma;\"\n\nFifth digit is \"2\" for \"squamous cell carcinoma;\"\n\nAnd fifth digit is \"9\" for \"other specified.\"\n\nAbout 10 codes were also deleted to accommodate the new codes, which are more specific in their descriptors. For skin neoplasms of unspecified site, 173.9x is the reserved category.\n\nFor example, previous to this new switch, one would report 173.0 (other malignant neoplasm of skin of lip) for any non-melanoma malignant neoplasm of the lip. But with the new ICD-9-CM, effective on October 1, 2011, it should be:\n\n173.00 - Unspecified malignant neoplasm of skin of lip\n\n173.01 - Basal cell carcinoma of skin of lip\n\n173.02 - Squamous cell carcinoma of skin of lip\n\n173.09 - Other specified malignant neoplasm of skin of lip.\n\nAdditionally, 173.0 is now an invalid diagnosis code. The changes in the other skin cancer categories follow this pattern, with the fifth digit of \"0\" referring to an unspecified malignant neoplasm, \"1\" denoting a basal cell cancer, \"2\" referring to a squamous cell carcinoma,\" and \"9\" describing another specified malignant neoplasm.\n\nFor a list of all of the ICD-9 updates, visit the AAD website.\n\nHot Topics of Interest: The Importance of Assessing Knowledge and Practice Gaps\n\nThe American College of Mohs Surgery has many important roles and not the least of them is providing high quality, continuing medical education at our Annual Meeting. Members, now more than ever, need these CME credits to satisfy licensing agencies at the time of license renewal. In the distant past of ten years ago, CME accreditation (to make CME acceptable for license renewal) was relatively simple and required a minimum of work by the organizing group. That is no longer the case. Changes are the result of heightened concerns about conflicts of interest as well as the requirement for \"meaningful\" education that improves patient care. This has led us to the need to identify \"gaps\" and construct programs that fill the \"gaps\".\n\nWhat is a gap? The Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME, the body that holds the ultimate responsibility for shaping CME programs) initially spearheaded the identification of \"practice gaps\", or \"holes\" in the ability to care for patients. In the beginning, knowledge gaps were not considered as criteria for program development. However, at this point it is accepted that knowledge is the key missing element when there is a gap, thus allowing us to define gaps both as practice gaps and knowledge gaps.\n\nHow does all of this affect our meetings? To receive ACCME approved CME, we must construct our program around knowledge or practice gaps and this makes it mandatory that we identify areas qualifying as gaps. No longer can we justify our program by statements such as, \"We all benefit from exposure to many ways of closure\". We must demonstrate that attendees have identified flaps as a practice gap. This can be done by utilizing an audience response system where closure options are shown and there is a wide array of responses to the closure method. This would demonstrate that there is sharing or learning to be done on this topic. It can also be achieved by members identifying flap closures as a practice gap. Similarly we can show a knowledge gap about new treatments for nevoid BCC syndrome by wrong answers on an audience response quiz, or by members identifying this as an area where they need more knowledge.\n\nThis may, at times, feel like an artificial exercise. In reality, through this process, we actually have been able to identify areas that bring new or controversial sessions to the membership. The CME & Education Committee has worked hard to weed its way through new requirements and reams of paperwork. However the committee cannot do this alone. The College needs the membership to be very open about their own personal learning needs. Whether it is the basic science of new treatments for melanoma or a review of dressing materials, let us know what your gaps may be. It will enrich our meetings and help us maintain our meeting accreditation with the ACCME.\n\nMary E. Maloney, MD\n\nCME & Education Committee, Chair\n\nNews from the Derm RRC\n\n3rd Quarter 2011 News items for Program Directors\n\nUpdated ACGME On-line Case Log System went Live the first week of September 2011.\n\nFellows are expected to enter all indexed procedures into the ACGME case log system.\n\nProgram Directors are expected to instruct fellows in appropriate use of the ACGME case log system and review case log entries during formal fellow reviews and submit summative reports at the end of each academic year.\n\nInstructions on how to use the new system are available at the following:\n\nhttp://www.dermatologyprofessors.org/pdf/TutorialsandGuidelinesACGMECaseLogSystem-ProceduralDermatologyFellows.pdf\n\nProposal for how case log data will be used to review fellowship programs.\n\nThe Resident Review Committee is proposing that case log data now be used to evaluate programs.\n\nThe proposal encourages programs to provide procedural experiences that result in fellow's annual totals for index procedures being within 2 standard deviations of the national mean.\n\nA program would receive a citation only if in any 2 out of 3 years the average for more than any 6 index procedures falls below two standard deviations of the national mean.\n\nFellowship programs would still be required to provide opportunities for fellows to meet case number targets in Mohs surgery (Procedural Dermatology PR's IV.A.2.a).(2).(c)).\n\nThe proposal would allow programs more flexibility when developing a curriculum in cosmetic and laser training.\n\nThe proposal was endorsed by surgical directors who attended the 2011 annual meeting of the Professors of Dermatology and the RRC seeks comments from the Procedural Dermatology program directors.\n\nNew Chair of the Dermatology Resident Review Committee\n\nStan Taylor, MD, who has served as Chair of the Review Committee since July 2010, has assumed the Chief Medical Officer post at the University of Texas Southwestern and has decided to step down one year early. He will use his remaining time on the Committee to mentor the new chair.\n\nThe Committee has selected Nicole M. Owens, MD, to serve as its next Chair. Dr. Owens is a colonel in the United States Air Force, and is Deputy Chief, Dermatology Service, at the San Antonio Military Medical Center, is a program director and assistant professor of the Uniformed Services University Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nStan Taylor, MD\n\nDermatology RRC, Chair\n\nThe Occasional Reader\n\nMatterhorn by Karl A. Marlantes\n\nThe Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien\n\nThis issue of ACMS Membership Bulletin contains my seventh \"Occasional Reader\" column. As I sit at my desk pecking away at my computer crafting this essay, an enticement for you to read two excellent novels–Matterhorn and The Things They Carried–I am acutely aware that this is a personal column. My intention has been to describe books that may have escaped best-seller lists but more importantly, describe books I have read, enjoyed and recommend. However, I know not everyone shares my tastes in literature. (As I would suppose, we also might not agree upon politics, choice of films, wine, or suture). So it is with some trepidation and humility I discuss my favorite literary war novels–a term some might even suggest is an oxymoron.\n\nWhile I confess a life-long passion for reading novels concerning men (and women) at war, my motivations have changed. As a young boy I was enamored by the adventures of British sea captains, Horatio Hornblower and Jack Aubrey. Growing older, I lost my romantic infatuation with triple-masted warships and began reading more complicated war novels. Novels like Joseph Heller's Catch 22, Tolstoy's War and Peace, James Jones' A Thin Red Line, and Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead presented war, particularly modern warfare, as the multi-layered destructive monstrosity that it is.\n\nWhile I enjoy an occasional military history or policy analysis or even a biography of a general, I remain fascinated by the stories of common combat soldiers. I'm the guy who views all ten hours of the HBO series Band of Brothers every Memorial Day and have bought so many war memoirs and novels that the local bookstore reserves a copy of new releases knowing I'm good for the purchase. But I can't help myself; these vivid stories are so full of paradox: men grappling with the abstractions of honor and duty in the particular circumstances of muck, deprivation, blood. Not to mention the cost to the human psyche produced by the daily decision to kill or be killed. But, can these novels really be considered literary?\n\nAuthor Brett Lott defines a literary novel as, \". . . fiction that examines the character of the people involved in the story, [while] popular fiction is driven by plot. Whereas popular fiction, I [Lott] tell them, is meant primarily as a means of escape . . . literary fiction confronts us with who we are, and makes us look deeply at the human condition.\"\n\nFor readers interested in policy issues of the Vietnam War, I would recommend Andrew Krepinevich's seminal work, The Army and Vietnam. But for those readers fascinated with examining the workings of the human heart, especially when the realities of war have removed civilization's rational veneer, then Karl Marlante's Matterhorn and Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried are fantastic novels.\n\nBe forewarned, these books are not romantic and certainly not plot driven stories with tidy conclusions; both authors explicate scene and violence in realistic and often revolting detail. But these authors are masters at creating well-drawn and complex characters. It is these character's recognition of and wrestling with fear and doubt that holds the primacy of place. Encased in these character's narratives are the not so subtle questions concerning the human capacity and desire for violence. Perhaps because both authors are Vietnam survivors, they are at great pains to map the wreckage rent upon the survivors in addition to the war's massive loss of life.\n\nBoth novels create word images of the human heart that exhibit unusual complexity, ambiguity and paradox. Both authors draw unflinching portraits containing dark and ugly features: racism, hate, cowardice and murder exist within soldiers who also practice uncommon bravery and sacrifice for their fellow soldiers.\n\nEach novel also unfolds a strange kind of grace and honor. This is not a sterile creedal grace or abstract nationalistic honor. Rather, both novels outline a grace tenuously contained in broken and filthy vessels; human beings bearing only the faintest whiff of redemption, redemption encrusted by doubt and chaos and death. Marlante and O'Brien's characters forge an honor that has little to do with dreams of glory or dress swords or medals. The honor noted is an unspoken but palpable commitment made by disparate and imperfect men, soldiers willing to lay down their lives for their comrades and even for strangers who wear the uniform. Marlante and O'Brien note this is the same kind of honor found in the Illiad or in Shakespeare's Henry V: \". . . We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he to-day that sheds his blood with me; Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile. .. \"\n\nMatterhorn, released in 2010, was Karl Marlante's first novel. Marlante, a Yale graduate who attended Oxford, is also a decorated Marine lieutenant whose personal history in Vietnam is strikingly similar to that of the book's main protagonist, second lieutenant Waino Mellas. Although Matterhorn is a fictional account–the story of Bravo Company, 1st. Battalion, 24th Regiment, Fifth Marine Division actions during 1969–the battle scenes are closely drawn from an actual prolonged assault on Hill 44. The fight over Hill 44 resulted in the loss of over a third of Marlante's company and his being awarded the Navy Cross.\n\nBut conquering the hill, both real and fictional, is not really the point. Control of the fictional Matterhorn hill or the actual Hill 44, like so many Vietnam campaigns, proved to be of little utility, an antiquated strategy against an enemy fighting a new kind of war. Long before Lt. Mellas and his men reached the Matterhorn summit we learned–as the grunts of Bravo Company acknowledged long before they started the assault–that the almost unthinkable endurance and courage and death required to complete \"the mission\" would not be worth it–by anyone's reckoning.\n\nThis novel grabbed me like few books in my recent memory. I couldn't bear to put it down until I knew the ending. Great authors, like installation artists, put the reader inside a three-dimensional world. Marlante inserted me into a Southeast Asia hell; I stood single file on a dirty jungle trail with fellow grunts, fingered the trigger of my M-16, listened intently for unusual sounds, a dissonance marking the presence of someone I wanted to kill before they killed me. The author's prose caused me to feel sweat rolling down my back, words that induced pain where the leech sucked blood from my leg and a scene filling my mouth with bitter bile.\n\nHowever, it was a quiet moment long after the big battle that has stayed with me. The character, Lt. Mellas, a man by age and upbringing like me, had an epiphany. Reflecting on the assault of Matterhorn, he realized that he, \"enjoyed killing people.\" I sat silent in my peaceful home and realized that I too was capable of taking a human life and worse, might do so without remorse.\n\nTim O'Brian's book, The Things They Carried, does not employ a standard story line or narrative arc and is described by critics as a \"lyric novel.\" By labeling O'Brien's book as a lyric novel, the critics meant to identify the novel as employing a prose \"collage\" form, a style far more unique and controversial in 1990 when The Things They Carried was published than it is today.\n\nThe Things They Carried is a collection of loosely connected short stories concerning a combat infantry platoon stationed in the Republic of Vietnam. O'Brien's combat narrative, like Matterhorn, allows the reader to enter a new world, a world filled with equal parts of fury, fatalism and bravado. This tale is, at times, confusing and disorienting; a non-linear story resembling a slide down Alice's rabbit hole into a surreal, hallucinogenic world. O'Brien describes a trip that coveys the narrative described by many young soldiers who left the sun-drenched \"summer of love\" in the United States, the \"real\" world of 1967 filled with hippies, Gracie Slick and Jimmy Hendrix. They were, in the blink of a cramped twelve-hour plane ride, transported from California to a violent, random, and death-filled Hell.\n\nWritten in 1990, O'Brien's book is now considered by many experts as one of the \"classic\" Vietnam War novels. This well written memoir/fiction reminded me of my other favorite Vietnam literary novels: Tobias Wolff's In Pharaoh's Army and Michael Herr's Dispatches. All three of these books exhibit superb readable prose that provokes revulsion, disorientation and a kind of hopeless sadness.\n\nI suppose sadness might seem an unusual emotion. Perhaps like most Americans entering late middle age, I have childhood friends whose names are chiseled into that black granite wall in Washington, D.C. Like phantom pain from an amputation, the Vietnam War is for my generation–those who went and those who did not–a time that can never quite be \"gotten over\" or \"put behind.\" Reading Matterhorn caused me to remember and ponder the many twists and turns that allow me now to worry about my grandchildren while my dead high school classmates cannot.\n\nBut reading books about the Vietnam War, even superbly written volumes like Matterhorn and The Things They Carried provokes in me a newer kind of sadness. I finished Marlante's novel at 3:30 A.M. Rather than enjoying a contented sigh, the usual expression of bittersweet satisfaction after turning the last page of a great novel, I felt a futile dread-the old man's dread. The autumn wind blew aspen leaves against the house, the breeze's crinkly chatter serving as surety for the coming winter. But, the wind also whispered an ominous promise: there will be no lack of future war novels.\n\nThe more than ten years of United States' combat in Iraq and Afghanistan guarantees another bumper crop of literary war novels-a new generation of talented returning combat veterans will craft stories that need telling. Yet, this prospect gives me no joy. Despite have enjoyed literary war novels all my life, I would gladly give them up. Frankly, the cost of this new prose is too high. I do not wish to read another iteration of war novels, stories of our children and grandchildren retracing well-trodden and blood soaked paths.\n\nSince Vietnam, our nation has not really wanted to know the truth, not wanted to count the terrible costs of war, not wanted to recognize that war for the survivors doesn't end when the treaties are signed. Too many brave men and women return permanently injured; too many courageous acts of honor and sacrifice have gone unnoticed and altogether too many flag draped coffins have been ignored. Perhaps, that was Marlante's and O'Brien's point for writing these excellent books: there is much, even after forty years, that we as individuals and a nation should not forget.\n\nDavid P.
