This is the longest tenure of any director of athletics at Rochester since Dr. Edwin Fauver, who served in the role for 29 years from 1916 to 1945. Both VanderZwaag and Fauver arrived at Rochester from Princeton University. After VanderZwaag, Louis Alexander Sr. served as head of the department for 21 years.\n\nSince his arrival in 1999, the Yellowjacket athletic teams and recreational programs have experienced tremendous growth. Teams have won over a combined 3,900 games and have finished inside the top-100 in the Division III Directors Cup Standings 17 times. In 2023-24, Rochester produced 31 All-Americans and five Academic All-Americans®. In addition, ten programs sent teams or individuals to compete in national championship competition, with both five teams (squash, softball, women’s indoor track & field, women’s outdoor track & field and golf) winning conference titles. The recreational programs at Rochester have also doubled in size in his time at the helm.\n\nIn all, 264 athletes have earned All-America honors in a variety of sports. 89 athletes have been named to the Academic All-America Team® as chosen by the College Sports Communicators (CSC). 236 teams and countless individuals have been cited by their respective coaching associations for academic prowess.\n\nVanderZwaag has overseen a number of major capital projects, including a complete renovation of the Goergen Athletic Center, design of the 11,000-square foot Bloch Fitness Center, replacement of the turf, lights, and track in Fauver Stadium, installation of artificial turf and lights on Towers Field and enhancements to the baseball, softball and tennis facilities.\n\nIn January of 2014, VanderZwaag and the University announced a major gift from alumnus Brian F. Prince (‘86) which created the Prince Outdoor Athletic Complex. New playing fields, a new track, renovations to Fauver Stadium and the creation of the Boehning Varsity House were all key elements to this extensive capital project which was completed in 2023.\n\nVanderZwaag established the Friends of Rochester Athletics program in 2000, to ensure the highest quality intercollegiate and recreational athletic opportunities at the University.\n\nHe implemented a strategic plan to provide a quality athletics experience for students. This plan reaffirmed the important educational role of athletics within the overall mission of the University.\n\nIn September, 2002, his achievements were recognized by the University when he received the Goergen Award for Distinguished Contributions to Undergraduate Learning.\n\nVanderZwaag has served as a member of the Community Service Network Advisory Board, the Genesee Waterways Center Board of Advisors, and the University United Way Cabinet.\n\nHe has held leadership roles in both of Rochester’s athletic conferences. VanderZwaag served as the President of the Liberty League (formerly the Upstate Collegiate Athletic Association [UCAA]) and as the treasurer for the University Athletic Association (UAA), serving as a member of the UAA Executive Committee. He currently serves as treasurer of the Liberty League. VanderZwaag led the UCAA effort to expand membership in football and also led the branding project that resulted in the renaming of the UCAA as the Liberty League. He has also served on the NCAA Committee on Women’s Athletics.\n\nVanderZwaag currently serves as an advisory board member for the Sports Law & Business Program in the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University.\n\nHe arrived at Princeton in 1991. During his eight year tenure as Senior Associate Athletics Director, the Tigers experienced unprecedented competitive success, capturing 18 national championships and 81 Ivy League titles. Princeton won the Ivy League’s unofficial all-sports standings all eight years.\n\nVanderZwaag graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. in 1986 with a bachelor’s degree in economics. He was an offensive lineman for the football team and a member of the golf team. He earned his Master of Science degree in sport management from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. In 2016, he was recognized by UMass Amherst with its Distinguished Alumni Award. From 1989-91, he was an assistant to the athletic director for student services and operations at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nHe and his wife, Kathleen, are the parents of three boys, G.W., Michael, and Jacob. G.W. graduated as a member of the Class of 2016 at Rochester and played varsity golf. Michael completed his degree at the University of Michigan and Jacob graduated from Georgetown University. VanderZwaag also has one grandchild, Libby, born in August of 2021.\n\n(Updated 8/2024)"
