        "text": "Dam depths\n\nThe average depth of a dam is the ratio between the volume and surface area of the dam. Deeper dams are better than shallow dams as they lose a lower proportion of their water to evaporation. The Berg River and Wemmershoek Dams are the deepest in the WCWSS.\n\nEvaporation\n\nAll dams lose water through evaporation to the atmosphere. The amount lost to evaporation shows a strong seasonal pattern and is much higher in summer than in winter. The amount of evaporation is affected by a number of factors such as air temperature, water temperature, wind speed, humidity and the elevation of the sun.\n\nThe graph shows average monthly evaporation and rainfall for the Theewaterskloof dam and it can be seen that evaporation exceeds rainfall for eight months of the year.\n\nSource: South African Atlas of Agrohydrology and Climatology\n\nComparison of dam capacities\n\nThe largest dams in the Western Cape are much smaller than large dams elsewhere in South Africa. This means that even when full, the volume of water stored in these dams is less than the capacity of the Vaal dam, for example.\n\nThis graph ranks the 100 largest dams from largest to smallest. The Western Cape dams are highlighted in yellow."
