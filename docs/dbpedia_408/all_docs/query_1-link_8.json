DWAF Report No P WMA19/000/00/0304.\n\nTopography\n\nThe Berg River rises in the Franschhoek and Drakenstein mountains at an altitude of 1500 m. It\n\nflows northwards past Paarl, Wellington, Hermon and Gouda, where it is joined by the Klein Berg\n\nand Vier-en-Twintig rivers. The Berg River Catchment covers an area of almost 9 000km2 and is\n\nthe largest catchment in the Western Cape Province. Berg River Baseline Monitoring Programme\n\nFinal Report: Volume 1, September 2007\n\nThe river then flows westwards past Porterville,\n\nPiketberg and Velddrif where it finally discharges into\n\nSt. Helena Bay on the west coast. Based on geographic\n\nand topographic characteristics, the catchment can be\n\ndivided into three distinct areas, namely the broad, flat\n\nextensive western portion west of Moorreesburg and\n\nKoringberg, the river valley portion east of Koringberg\n\nto just south of Paarl, and the upper mountainous\n\nsource area south of Paarl.\n\nMajor towns in the western portion include Saldanha, Vredenburg and Hopefield while key\n\ntowns in the central river valley area include Piketberg, Porterville, Paarl and Wellington.\n\nFranschhoek is found at the base of the Franschhoek Mountains some 6 km north east of the\n\nproposed Berg River Dam site. The total population of the catchment is in the order of 200 000,\n\nmost of whom live in the urban areas.\n\nMuch of the catchment area is flat, with an average topographical gradient between Paarl and\n\nthe mouth of the Berg River at Laaiplek of 0.001. Topographically, a north-trending ridge of\n\nmountains (Piketberg, Swartberg) divides the catchment in two, with the Berg River flowing\n\nthrough a poort between Koringberg and De Hoek. Mountains that reach in excess of 1 000 m\n\nelevation flank the north trending valley in the eastern part of the catchment, including the\n\nGroot Winterhoek Mountains, Kasteelberg, Perdeberg, Paarl Mountain and the Wemmershoek\n\nMountains.\n\nThe profile of the Berg River (from the origin near Franschhoek to the mouth at Velddrif)\n\nis illustrated below:\n\nGeology\n\nThe Berg River Catchment comprises sequences of\n\nrocks of the Malmesbury Group, the Cape Granite\n\nSuite, the Klipheuwel Group, the Table Mountain\n\nGroup and younger Cenozoic sediments in the western\n\npart of the catchment. The Malmesbury Group and\n\nKlipheuwel Group essentially comprise soft, erodible\n\nrocks that form flat plains in low lying areas. In general,\n\nthese areas have moderate to high agricultural\n\npotential. The Malmesbury Group is steeply folded\n\nalong a north west striking axis (Visser 1989). Berg\n\nRiver Baseline Monitoring Programme Final Report:\n\nVolume1, September 2007\n\nThese metasediments form part of the Saldania Subprovince and have been subdivided into three\n\ntectono-stratigraphic domains, i.e. the Tygerberg, Swartland and Boland domains. These domains are\n\nseparated by two major north-northwesterly striking fault systems, namely the Franschhoek- Saldanha\n\n(Colenso Fault) and Wellington-Piketberg Faults (Visser 1989)\n\nOutcrops of Cape Granite Suite rocks occur in the west,\n\nsouth and south east of the catchment. This series of\n\ngranitic plutons, of late Precambrian to early Cambrian\n\nage, intruded into Malmesbury Group. Older intrusions\n\noccurred between 610 and 560 Ma, while the younger\n\nphase occurred between 540 and 500 Ma (Timmerman\n\n1988). In places they form prominent features like the\n\nPaarl Mountain.\n\nThe Table Mountain Group comprises hard resistant quartzitic sandstones that form the mountain\n\nranges that flank the north-trending river valley in the east. The rocks have been folded and faulted,\n\ngiving them their secondary water-bearing features.\n\nUpper Berg River: Table Mountain Group (quartzitic sandstone), Sandy sediments\n\nUpper Middle Berg River: Table Mountain Group (quartzitic sandstone), Malmesbury Group\n\n(shale), Cape Granite Suite, Sandy sediments\n\nLower Middle Berg River: Table Mountain Group (quartzitic sandstone), Malmesbury Group\n\n(shale), Klipheuwel Group, Sandy sediments\n\nLower Berg River: Table Mountain Group (quartzitic sandstone), Malmesbury Group (shale),\n\nCape Granite Suite, Sandy sediments\n\nSoils\n\nThe siliceous Table Mountain Group (TMG) produces soils that are acidic and infertile.\n\nSoils derived from the Cape Granite are also more fertile and finer textured than those derived from the\n\nTable Mountain Group\n\nHydrology\n\nThe Berg River has its source in the Drakenstein and\n\nFranschhoek Mountains south of Franschhoek and\n\ndischarges into the Atlantic Ocean near Velddrif, some\n\n285 km away. Major tributaries of the Berg River\n\ninclude the Franschhoek, Wemmershoek, Dwars,\n\nKompagnies, Klein Berg, and Twenty-four Rivers. A\n\nstriking characteristic of the catchment is the low\n\ndensity of drainage channels in the western parts of\n\nthe catchment underlain by unconsolidated sandy\n\nrecent deposits. Significantly higher drainage densities\n\nare observed in the central and eastern parts underlain\n\nby weathered and fractured rocks, mostly of the\n\nMalmesbury and Table Mountain Group.\n\nTwo major dams have been built in the catchment. The Wemmershoek Dam south east of Paarl has a\n\nsurface area of 3 km2 and a storage capacity of 66 million m3. The Voëlvlei Dam west of Tulbagh\n\ncovers an area of 15 km2 and has a storage capacity of 170 million m3. Numerous smaller farm dams\n\nare found throughout the east part of the catchment. Total natural runoff from the Berg River\n\nCatchment amounts to 931 million m3/a. These three catchments make up only 7% of the total area of\n\nthe Berg River catchment. The estimated size of the catchment area of the Berg River Dam is about 70\n\nkm2, which is less than 0.8% of the total area of the Berg River Catchment. DWAF (1993) estimated\n\npresent-day annual runoff of the Berg River amounted to 682 million m3/a, with the modified flow\n\nattributed to direct abstraction from the river for irrigation, storage and abstraction for urban water\n\nsupply, development of forestry within the basin, irrigation return flow, and releases from the Voëlvlei,\n\nWemmershoek and Theewaterskloof Dams (the latter via the Berg River Syphon).\n\nFlow and quality characteristics of the Berg River have\n\nbeen severely modified by abstraction from the river\n\nand the release of some 17 million m3/a of summer\n\nirrigation water from the Theewaterskloof Dam into the\n\nupper Berg River at the Berg River Syphon upstream of\n\nthe proposed Berg River Dam site (1993 data; current\n\nreleases amount to between 50 and 60 million m3/a).\n\nThis water is used to supply irrigators downstream as\n\nfar as Zonquasdrift. Downstream of Zonquasdrift,\n\nirrigation water is released from Voëlvlei Dam.\n\nIt is of interest to note that in the geological past, the Berg River flowed from Assegaaibos past the\n\nposition of the present tunnel siphon, straight past Robertsvlei camp and northeast down the\n\nRoberts River into the Franschhoek River. A mountain landslide resulted in blocking the upper\n\nreaches of the Robertsvlei gap, thereby causing the river to change its course to the present course\n\nthrough the proposed Berg River Dam site (Forbes, Dick and Associates 2001).\n\nThe Berg River catchment falls within the winter rainfall region of the south-western Cape. Rainfall\n\nin the catchment increases from west to east.\n\nRef 2: STATE-OFF-RIVERS REPORT RIIVER HEALTH PROGRAMME BERG RIVER SYSTEM – 2004\n\nRef 3: Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, South Africa. 2004.

DWAF Report No P WMA19/000/00/0304.\n\nEcology\n\nOverview\n\nUPPER BERG RIVER and TRIBUTARIES - Habitat integrity and water quality in the Berg\n\nRiver deteriorate downstream as a result of alien vegetation encroachment (Acacia sp.), the\n\ninterbasin transfer of water and river modification. Urban and agricultural development\n\naffect the water quality at Franschhoek (municipal and wine farm effluent). The lack of\n\nenvironmental flow releases from Wemmershoek Dam results in a severely altered flow\n\nregime and habitat downstream.\n\nUPPER MIDDLE BERG RIVER and TRIBUTARIES -River health is reduced in the\n\ntributaries as a result of alien vegetation infestation and agricultural development (river\n\nmodification, water abstraction, runoff). Water quality and habitat integrity in the Berg\n\nRiver and lower reaches of these tributaries are reduced due to urban development.\n\nLOWER MIDDLE BERG RIVER and TRIBUTARIES- Diversion weirs in the Klein Berg and\n\nVieren-Twintig rivers have altered flow patterns. Alien fish (bass and banded tilapia) are\n\nwidespread and have led to the disappearance of indigenous fish (Berg River redfin and\n\nwhitefish). River health is also reduced by the effects of agriculture (levees and pesticide\n\nresidues). Water quality and habitat integrity near Tulbagh are poor.\n\nLOWER BERG RIVER and TRIBUTARIES- Farming practices (riparian vegetation removal,\n\nbed modification, water abstraction) and alien vegetation (black wattle, river gum) impact\n\non the habitat integrity and flow of the rivers. Flow releases are made from the bottom of\n\nMisverstand Dam and reduce water quality. Alien fish (banded tilapia and carp) prey on or\n\ncompete with indigenous fish.\n\nVegetation\n\nSpatial distribution and variation of vegetation is strongly correlated with geology, and to a\n\nlesser extent rainfall and other climatic variables. The siliceous Table Mountain Group\n\n(TMG) produces soils that are acidic and infertile, resulting in areas with low agricultural\n\npotential (Schloms et al. 1983). In general, fynbos is prominent in these areas, but forest can\n\ndevelop in moist sheltered ravines (Cowling and Holmes 1992).\n\nRocks of the Malmesbury Group are regarded as being moderately high in nutrients. These\n\nrocks are generally finer textured than those of the TMG and include phyllite, schist,\n\ngreywacke and shales. Soils derived from the Cape Granite are also more fertile and finer\n\ntextured than those derived from the TMG. Renosterveld dominates the vegetation on\n\nthese soils, but may give way to fynbos in areas with higher rainfall (Rebelo 1996). Along\n\nthe West Coast, soils derived largely from coastal processes can broadly be divided into\n\ncalcareous sands and limestones, and non-calcareous (neutral to acidic) sands. These soils\n\nsupport a number of coastal vegetation types such as Strandveld and Sand Fynbos. Much\n\nof the natural vegetation in the catchment has been destroyed to make way for\n\nurbanisation and agriculture. It is only in the higher lying areas and areas with low\n\nagricultural potential that natural vegetation prevails. The vegetation coverage was\n\nobtained from the National Botanical Institute (Mucina and Rutherford 2005.). Berg River\n\nBaseline Monitoring Programme Final Report: Volume 1, September 2007\n\nUPPER BERG RIVER: Fynbos (Sandstone, Alluvium, Afromontane Mires)\n\nUPPER MIDDLE BERG RIVER: Fynbos (Alluvium, Afromontane Mires, Sand, Sandstone),\n\nRenosterveld (Shale, Granite)\n\nLOWER MIDDLE BERG RIVER: Fynbos (Sandstone, Shale, Alluvium), Shale Renosterveld\n\nLOWER BERG RIVER: Fynbos (Sand, Sandstone, Alluvium), Renosterveld (Shale, Granite,\n\nSilcrete, Alluvium)\n\nClimate\n\nTemperature\n\nThe mean annual temperature varies between 16°C in\n\nthe east to 18°C along the West Coast, with an average\n\nof 16°C. Maximum temperatures are experienced in\n\nJanuary (average daily max = 29,4°C) and minimum\n\ntemperatures usually occur in July (average daily min =\n\n4,5°C). Temperatures along the coast are a few degrees\n\ncooler than in the interior.\n\nRainfall\n\nThe majority of the rainfall occurs between the months of May and September and hence it\n\nis referred to as a winter rainfall region. Rainfall is of a frontal nature, generally moving\n\nfrom the Atlantic Ocean to the north-west over\n\nthe Western Cape. The orographical influence\n\nof the high mountain ranges in the Cape\n\nPeninsula and on the eastern side of the water\n\nmanagement area, introduces a large spatial\n\nvariability in the mean annual precipitation\n\n(MAP). In the high lying areas of the Upper\n\nBerg River, the upper reaches of the Eerste\n\nRiver and the Steenbras River, the maximum\n\nmean annual precipitation exceeds 3 000mm\n\nper annum.\n\nIn the lowlands, the precipitation is between 600mm\n\nand 400mm per annum, being greater in the small\n\nmountain outcrops and hills and reducing to 300mm\n\nper annum in the north-west , where the Berg River\n\nflows into the sea. The average potential mean annual\n\nevaporation (measured by S-pan) ranges from 1\n\n400mm in the south to 1 700mm in the north.\n\nThe Berg River Catchment experiences a\n\nMediterranean climate with warm dry summers and\n\ncool wet winters. Rainfall is of a cyclonic nature,\n\nextending normally over a few days with significant\n\nperiods of clear weather in between. Little rain falls\n\nduring summer, with the rainy season extending from\n\nApril through to October.\n\nLand-use\n\nAgricultural\n\nWine grapes: Viticulture is an important agricultural activity practice in the southern part of\n\nthe Berg River catchment and centered around Paarl, Wellington and Franschhoek.\n\nWheat: The Swartland is one of the major wheat producing areas in South-Africa. The main\n\ncentres are Malmesbury, Moorreesburg and Piketberg.\n\nOther: Deciduous fruit is the backbone of\n\nthe economy in the Berg River catchment.\n\nNorth of Wellington, dryland grain farming\n\nand sheep farming predominate. Commercial\n\npine forests occur near the headwaters,\n\naround Franschhoek. The major industries in\n\nthe Berg River basin are agriculturally based\n\nand include wineries, canneries and other\n\nfood processing factories.\n\nNature Conservation, Reserves, Tourism\n\nIndustries\n\nFishing: Velddrif, St Helena Bay\n\nKWV Industry\n\nPopulated places\n\nVelddrif:\n\n•West Coast District Municipality\n\n•Bergrivier Local Municipality\n\nVelddrif is located approximately\n\n145 kilometres (90 mi) north\n\nof Cape Town, and is connected\n\nto Cape Town by the R27\n\nroad.[ The R27 joins the R399 at\n\nVelddrif. It is situated near the\n\npoint that the meandering Berg\n\nRiver flows into the sea at St.\n\nHelena Bay. This estuary is an\n\nimportant bird habitat, home to\n\naround 30,000 birds, including up\n\nto 80 species which are endemic\n\nto the Cape coast.[ Well over 350\n\ndifferent species of birds can be\n\nseen here as it is a habitat for\n\nsea, river and land birds.\n\nThe name Velddrif is derived\n\nfrom a local farmer, Theunis Smit,\n\nwho took his stock through a\n\ndrift in the field (Afrikaans: veld),\n\nto find grazing across the river.\n\nIn 1899, a pont (pontoon ferry)\n\nwas built to cross the Berg River\n\n(Wikipedia)\n\nLaaiplek:\n\nWest Coast District Municipality\n\nBergrivier Local Municipality\n\nThe heart of Laaiplek lies on the\n\nBerg River, its pier a hive of\n\nactivity, particularly last thing in\n\nthe afternoon as fishing boats\n\nsail alongside, and proceed to\n\nthrow out their catch of the day\n\nwhere it is weighed and then\n\npicked up by whatever market\n\nhas bought today's catch.\n\nHopefield:\n\nWest Coast District Municipality\n\nSaldanha Bay Local Municipality\n\nHopefield is a settlement in West Coast District Municipality in the Western Cape province\n\nof South Africa on the R27 between Malmesbury and Vredenburg.The town is east\n\nof Saldanha Bay and Langebaan, 40 km southeast of Vredenburg and 120 km north of Cape\n\nTown. The Dutch Reformed congregation (Zoutrivier) was established December 1851 and\n\nthe town was founded in 1852 on the farm Langekuil, it became a municipality in 1914.\n\nNamed after two people who laid it out, Major William Hope, Auditor-General, and a Mr Field.\n\nThe Air Force Base Langebaanweg,[ 22km west from town, as well as the West Coast Fossil\n\npark 25km west from town, falls within town limits. There are two schools in town, Hopefield\n\nPrimary, presenting Gr1-7, a fully state sponsored school and Hopefield High,presenting Gr1-\n\n12, a semi-state school with minimal sponsorship from government. The pre-1994 coloured\n\narea of the town is called Oudekraalfontein with a population of 2903 (2001 census). In\n\nearlier years this, now small, town was considered the capital of the West Coast. With banks,\n\nfilling stations and multiple other shops and businesses. The only access to the towns of\n\nVredenburg, Langebaan and Saldanha was through Hopefield. With the re-routing of the R27,\n\npassing the town on the outside and the construction of the R45 (West Coast Road) the infra-\n\nstructure of the down gradually shrunk till the point were the town is today.\n\nPaarl:\n\nCape Winelands District\n\nMunicipality\n\nDrakenstein Local Municipality\n\nPaarl is a town with 191,013\n\ninhabitants in the Western\n\nCape province of South Africa. It is\n\nthe third oldest town\n\nand European settlement in the\n\nRepublic of South Africa (after Cape\n\nTown and Stellenbosch) and the\n\nlargest town in the Cape Winelands.\n\nDue to the growth of the Mbekweni\n\ntownship, it is now a de facto urban\n\nunit with Wellington. It is situated\n\nabout 60 kilometres (37 mi)\n\nnortheast of Cape Town in\n\nthe Western Cape Province and is\n\nrenowned for its haunting scenic\n\nbeauty and deep viticulture and\n\nfruit growing heritage.\n\nPaarl is the seat of the Drakenstein\n\nLocal Municipality; although not\n\npart of the Cape Town metropolitan\n\narea, it falls within its economic\n\ncatchment. Paarl is unusual in\n\nSouth Africa in that the name of the\n\nplace is pronounced differently in\n\nEnglish and Afrikaans. An unusual\n\nfeature of the name of the town is\n\nthat Afrikaners customarily attach\n\nthe definite article to it: people\n\nsay in die Paarl (\"in the Paarl\"),\n\nrather than in Paarl.\n\nOther populated places along the Berg River\n\nMoorreesburg\n\nPiketberg\n\nRiebeeck West\n\nGouda\n\nPorterville\n\nWellington\n\nSimondium\n\nTulbagh\n\nFranschoek\n\nPniel\n\nDe Hoek\n\nFranschoek\n\nTributary Tributaries\n\nNotes\n\nKlein Berg River (from the Voelvlei Dam)\n\nTwenty Four Rivers Draining the Groot Winterhoek Mountains\n\nKrom River Draining the Swartland between Piketberg and\n\nthe Olifants River Mountains\n\nBoesmans River Draining the Piketberg Mountains\n\nSoutrivier Draining the Swartland west of Moorreesburg\n\nFranschoek River\n\nWemmershoek River\n\nKompagnies River\n\nDwars River\n\nDams\n\nWEMMERSHOEK DAM\n\nMax.
