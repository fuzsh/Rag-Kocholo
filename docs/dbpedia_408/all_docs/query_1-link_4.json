        "text": "ENVIRONMENT\n\nCape Town is edging closer to ‘Day Zero’, the long-feared time when the city will run out of freshwater. (Geographical and the Los Angeles Times)\n\nWhere does Cape Town get its water supply? Use today’s MapMaker Interactive map to find out.\n\nTeachers, scroll down for a quick list of key resources in our Teachers Toolkit, including today’s MapMaker Interactive map.\n\nDiscussion Ideas\n\nWhere does Cape Town get its freshwater? Take a look at today’s MapMaker Interactive map for some help.\n\nCape Town, and South Africa’s entire Western Cape province, is primarily supplied by six big dams:\n\nThe Steenbras dams (upper and lower), collect water from the Hottentots Holland Mountains.\n\nThe upper Steenbras reservoir is the fullest of Cape Town’s reservoirs, at 90.2% capacity.\n\nThe lower Steenbras reservoir is at 45.5% capacity.\n\nThe Berg River dam dams the Berg River to the east of Cape Town. Its reservoir is at 55% capacity.\n\nThe Wemmershoek dam dams the Wemmershoek River. Its reservoir is at 52.3% capacity.\n\nThe Voëlvlei dam collects water from the Cape Fold Mountains. Its reservoir is at 18.6% capacity.\n\nThe Theewaterskloof dam dams the Sonderend River. Its reservoir is at 14.2% capacity.\n\nWhy are the Western Cape’s dams not at capacity?\n\ndrought. The Western Cape has experienced three dry winters in a row.\n\nWhat are some other factors are contributing to Cape Town’s water shortage?\n\nrapid population growth. The city’s population has doubled since 1999, and is currently approaching 4 million residents.\n\nfailure to develop alternate water systems. The city is scrambling to develop other water supply systems, including four desalination plants, two groundwater wells, and a facility that would purify reclaimed water.\n\nWhat steps are being taken now to combat the water shortage? Take a look at the handy image above, or download the PDF here to get started.\n\nindividual or family conservation. Residents are encouraged to take shorter showers, restrict their toilet use, and stop washing vehicles, among other cutbacks listed in the graphic above.\n\ncommunity conservation. All community pools, fountains, and showers have been closed.\n\nwater restrictions. Residents are encouraged to limit their water use to 23 gallons per day, and that number will shrink to 13 gallons in February. This program is voluntary, and only 39% of Capetonians are adhering to the limit.\n\nWhat are some definite or possible water limits once Cape Town reaches “Day Zero”?\n\nwater rationing. People will line up at one of 200 water stations around the city to collect 6.6 gallons per person, per day.\n\ncommunity cutbacks. Municipal water supply may be turned off for all but essential services, such as hospitals.\n\nevacuations. Capetonians may become urban climate refugees if the government is not prepared for “Day Zero.”\n\nThe Los Angeles Times says “a number of details of the crisis plan remain unclear.” What questions remain?\n\nHow would one person carry 26 gallons of water for a family of four?\n\nHow would the elderly and disabled cope?\n\nWhat about the fact that officials expect there will be insufficient water to flush the city’s toilets?\n\nWhat impact will this have on Cape Town’s primary industry, tourism?\n\nHow will cutbacks impact agricultural areas?\n\nWhere will Capetonians relocate, and are those areas prepared to adapt to an influx of new residents?\n\nIs there rain in the long-term forecast for Cape Town?\n\nThere may be some temporary relief before “Day Zero,” but most long-term climate models are leaning toward redefining the region’s climate zone. “There is good evidence to expect similar, possibly more severe, and likely more frequent drought events in the future.”\n\nTEACHERS TOOLKIT\n\nGeographical: Drought forces Cape Town to the brink of ‘Day Zero’\n\nLos Angeles Times: In Cape Town, ‘Day Zero’ is coming very soon — the day the water runs out\n\nQuartz: Cape Town’s drought and water shortage has officially escalated to disaster levels\n\nNat Geo: Cape Town at ‘Day Zero’ map\n\nCity of Cape Town: Day Zero\n\nNat Geo: What is a drought?\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
