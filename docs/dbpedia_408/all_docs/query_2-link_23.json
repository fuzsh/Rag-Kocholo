        "text": "The City of Cape Town plans to spend around R2 billion to upgrade its water treatment plants as part of a broader strategy to secure water supply for a growing population.\n\nIn its Water Outlook 2024 report, the city cautions that its traditional water sources remain under pressure, even though the water levels of dams supplying the metro have risen by more than 6% in the past week.\n\nRead: Distressed cargo ship off the Cape coast being salvaged\n\nAccording to an infographic shared on social media platform X, the city’s dams – Steenbras and Wemmershoek – are currently 74.1% full compared to 97.8% in the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nSince the threat of a ‘Day Zero’ scenario at the beginning of 2018, where Cape Town would have been the first major city in the modern world to run out of water, the metro has monitored water supply and usage carefully with a target of total daily water use of no more than 950 million litres.\n\nRead:\n\nCape Town faces earlier `Day Zero’ for water supply [Jan 2018]\n\nCape Town residents told water supply likely to be cut off [Jan 2018]\n\nThe Western Cape is currently experiencing heavy rainfall with widespread flooding across the province, including the City of Cape Town.\n\nIn its Water Outlook 2024 report, which analyses the city’s future water needs, the city says climate change is expected to result in extreme weather events, such as the severe drought experienced from 2015 to 2017.\n\nRead: Climate change blamed as record rains flood Western Cape\n\nWater treatment plants\n\nClimate change also leads to rainfall intensifying and becoming more erratic and uncertain with consequent flooding, the city notes. This will require maximising water storage and infrastructure to ensure flooding does not threaten water security.\n\nIn September 2023, Cape Town also experienced severe flooding, with dams filling up and overflowing. Significant wash-aways occurred in the catchments of the Western Cape Water Supply System dams, resulting in a deterioration of raw water quality.\n\n“There is a risk that the raw water quality fluctuations experienced in 2023 may become more frequent, or in the worst case, the norm,” the city says.\n\nFor this reason, the city must upgrade its 12 existing water treatment plants to ensure they can manage any future flood-related impacts.\n\nThe city estimates that refurbishing these water treatment plants will cost approximately R2 billion over the next decade.\n\nRead: Nedbank adds R3.5bn to Cape Town’s infrastructure pool\n\nIts current available water treatment capacity is around 75% of the design capacity of 1 600 mega-litres a day. Through the refurbishments, the city wants to ensure all existing plants can operate at their design capacity.\n\nWestern Cape Water Supply System under pressure\n\nAnother factor putting pressure on the water supply is the significant population growth Cape Town has experienced in the past decade.\n\n“The City’s total water demand has increased steadily and will carefully monitor water demand over the next twelve months to see whether the growth in water demand tends towards the population growth rate,” the report notes.\n\nShould the growth in demand remain above what was projected, it will be necessary to revise the timing of the new water programmes or accept a higher risk of restrictions.\n\nCape Town’s primary water source is the Western Cape Water Supply System, consisting of six major dams, several connecting pipelines, and supplement schemes.\n\nRead: Cape Town gets a positive outlook from Moody’s\n\nThe city owns and manages the Steenbras and Wemmershoek dams, while the Department of Water and Sanitation, a national competency, manages the other dams.\n\nThe Western Cape Water Supply System relies on surface water from the Theewaterskloof, Wemmershoek, Voëlvlei, Berg River, and Steenbras Upper and Lower dams.\n\nDiversifying water sources\n\nThe city warns that supply from the Western Cape Water Supply System could become constrained again in future in the event of periods of lower rainfall and droughts.\n\nThrough the city’s New Water Programme, which is part of a more comprehensive water strategy, the target is to ensure 300 million litres of extra water supply from various sources by 2030, says Zahid Badroodien, mayoral committee member for water and sanitation.\n\nNew, more diversified water sources include:\n\nWater reuse through purified recycled wastewater, which will add 70-100 million litres a day;\n\nThe clearing of invasive plant species, adding 30 million litres a day;\n\nExtracting groundwater by drilling boreholes and tapping springs, which will contribute an extra 100 million litres a day; and\n\nDesalination by extracting salt from seawater, which will yield an extra 50 million to 70 million litres a day.\n\nThe city is investigating the possibility of developing a desalination plant with the Faure New Water Scheme through a public-private partnership (PPP).\n\nRead: V&A Waterfront to commission R184m desalination plant early 2024\n\nPossible desalination sites include Melkbosstrand and Witzands near Atlantis. An assessment of possible desalination facilities will also take into account the requirements for related infrastructure, such as reservoirs, pipelines, and pump stations, the report says."
