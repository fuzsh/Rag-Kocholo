I've also heard there's an entry fee plus a rod fee...not sure 'bout the entry fee, but the rod fee's supposedly something like R35 per rod?!!\n\nCan anyone confirm if there's any truth in this?\n\nI have fished in Milnerton lagoon on a few occasions and in my opinion it is not really worth the effort! You go in through the gates where all the boats launch from and they will tell you where to fish, there is only one section that is open for fishing and they have pre marked sort of borders between each section, so i think they only allow 6 groups of guys fishing at any one time! As far as i remember you need a freshwater fishing permit and then every time you go fishing there you need to pay 30 odd bucks per person! The Carp bite like no tomorrow at times but big ones are few and far between, and at times you can catch them 2 at a time but they are no bigger than your hand. You also catch Kurper and harders at the same spots!\n\nIt is a great place to go if you want to have a family outing and have a braai too! But in my opinion if you want to catch nice carp there are far better places to go and you dont have to pay to get in. Another spot close to there is in the river that runs under blouberg road up towards the Killarney hotel! I have fished in there with my ski and caught some nice big carp, i have also seen a few guys fishing from the side!! You can get there from the Cape Town side of Koeberg road behind Mc Fearsons nursery, but i dont think that it is the safest of places to fish with the squatter camps so close by."
