        "text": "Western Cape dam levels have risen to 87.5% capacity following a week of severe storms across the province.\n\nThe City of Cape Town said its dams increased by 20% in a week.\n\nDespite the rising dam levels, residents were urged to use water sparingly.\n\nAfter a week of heavy rains, the Western Cape's dam levels have increased dramatically.\n\nThe Department of Water and Sanitation said a number of the province's dams were already above 100% capacity, including Berg River Dam, Buffeljags Dam, Ceres Dam, Tierkloof Dam and Steenbras Dam.\n\nIt added that in just one week, the province's dam levels rose from 75.5% to 87.5% capacity.\n\nAt this time last year, they were at 89.6%.\n\nThe City of Cape Town said its dam levels had increased by 20% in a week and were at 95.2% as of Wednesday. This time last year, dam levels were at 99%.\n\nREAD | 'Rain not bullets': Cape Flats residents say storms have kept gangsters off the streets\n\nIn the first two weeks of July, Wemmershoek Dam received more rainfall (460mm) than the previous record of 433.5mm for the month of July since 1992, the City said.\n\nCape Town Water and Sanitation MMC Zahid Badroodien urged Capetonians to continue using water sparingly.\n\nHe said:\n\nWe appreciate the heavy rain that has been filling our dams, but we cannot allow this to give us a false sense of water security in the future. Cape Town has learnt that we cannot solely rely on dams for water security, so the City is busy investing in its New Water Programme. This includes projects such as desalination, groundwater schemes and reuse, which are at various stages of progress.\n\nBadroodien said through these projects, the City was working toward increasing supply by an extra 300 million litres of new water everyday by 2030.\n\nAccording to the South African Weather Service (SAWS), cold and wet weather can be expected to persist for the rest of the week, with cold fronts bringing rain between Wednesday and Saturday.\n\nAccumulated rainfall of between 10mm and 20mm is expected, but the SAWS said that could increase to between 30mm and 35mm in mountainous areas such as Paarl and Stellenbosch.\n\nA Yellow Level 2 warning has been issued for disruptive rainfall and damaging winds.\n\nData provided by the City of Cape Town\n\nThe series of storms that lashed the province last week resulted in widespread flooding in Cape Town, the Cape Winelands and the West Coast.\n\nIn Cape Town, authorities estimated that 158 097 people were affected and 47 663 structures flooded or damaged over two weeks of heavy rain.\n\nIn just one weekend, the City of Cape Town issued 1 090 flood kits in various informal settlements."
