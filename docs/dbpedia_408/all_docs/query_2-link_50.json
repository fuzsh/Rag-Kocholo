        "text": "From 2015 to 2017, South Africa’s Southwestern Cape region faced three consecutive years of historically low rainfall, gradually depleting its water reservoirs. By the summer of 2017/18, there was a significant risk for the region, particularly Cape Town, to face water scarcity if substantial reductions in water usage were not implemented.\n\nThis would have made the City of Cape Town the world’s first major metropolis to run out of drinkable water. Among other factors, the water shortage Cape Town was caused by global warming and poor water management in the Western Cape region.\n\nThe three-year insufficient rainfall period led to dam levels falling to 25% capacity by late January 2018, with water anticipated to plummet to a critical 13.5% by April 12, 2018. As the crisis peaked, the government announced that water supply might only be allocated to essential services like hospitals, while municipal taps would be turned off.\n\nThis marked the concept of “Day Zero,” a period where residents would have been compelled to queue for daily water allowances of 25 liters per person at one of 200 designated collection points. The concept was introduced to signal the commencement of stricter regulations, as waiting until reservoirs reached 0% capacity would have been too late to prompt action from residents.\n\nFortunately, after being pushed back from mid-April to mid-July 2018, “Day Zero” was never declared due to aggressive water conservation and efficiency campaigns and increased rainfall by June 2018. In September 2018, dam levels were close to 70%, causing the city to relax water restrictions and signaled an improvement in the water crisis.\n\nBy 2020, substantial rainfall had effectively ended the drought and subsequent water scarcity, with dam levels reaching 95%.\n\nBut what prompted the water shortage Cape Town, and what were the government’s and individual efforts to curb it? Most importantly, how can humans prevent this water crisis from occurring in other risk-prone cities worldwide? We’ll discuss these and many more in this blog post.\n\nBackground\n\nOver 4 million residents of Cape Town, one of Africa’s wealthiest cities, enjoy a Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, arid summers and winter rainfall. The Western Cape Water Supply System, the water supply system in the Western Cape region of South Africa, heavily depends on rainfall collected and stored in 14 dams located in the mountainous areas. The main dams are six and include:\n\n● Theewaterskloof Dam\n\n● Wemmershoek Dam\n\n● Steenbras Lower Dam\n\n● Steenbras Upper Dam\n\n● Voëlvlei Dam, and\n\n● Berg River Dam\n\nThese dams contribute 99.6% of the total storage capacity, with Theewaterskloof dam (the largest) contributing 41%. Meanwhile, the eight minor dams contribute 0.4%.\n\nRain in the catchment zones replenishes the six main dams, primarily during the cooler winter from May to August. Conversely, dam levels decrease during the dry summer months from November to April, coinciding with increased urban water consumption and agricultural irrigation activities.\n\nOut of the water supplied by the Western Cape Water Supply System, urban and agricultural usage accounts for about 70% and 30%, respectively, with notable seasonal fluctuations.\n\nBefore 2015, similar droughts have occurred in the City of Cape Town, such as in the late 1920s, early 1970s, 2000–2001, and 2003 to 2004. In 2003, the City collaborated with the then Department of Water Affairs and Forestry to build the Berg River Dam and Supplement Scheme and initiated water demand management strategies.\n\nBy 2009, the storage capacity of Cape Town’s supply dams was boosted by 17%, reaching 898 million cubic meters upon the completion of the Berg River Dam and Supplement scheme.\n\nIn 2015, Cape Town earned international recognition for its Water Conservation and Demand Management (WCWDM) efforts.\n\nWhat Caused The Water Crisis in the City of Cape Town?\n\nClimate change due to global warming\n\nThe water crisis stemmed directly from an intense drought that lasted from 2015 to 2017, surpassing the planning parameters set by the Department of Water and Sanitation.\n\nGraph showing Cape Town’s dam levels between 2000 and 2017\n\nThe dependable yield of the South Western Cape water system was originally calculated based on the assumption of a constant climate. Specifically, the supply infrastructure for Cape Town and its surrounding areas was built to sustain uninterrupted water provision without imposing restrictions 98% of the time, which averages out to approximately 49 out of every 50 years.\n\nMeanwhile, extensive research conducted by the Climate System Analysis Group at the University of Cape Town on long-term weather patterns revealed that global warming was the main culprit behind Cape Town’s water shortage.\n\nAlso, based on the various statistical models used in the research, the group estimated that the likelihood of a drought of this magnitude reoccurring has multiplied by just over three times.\n\nConsequently, global warming, particularly in the South Western Cape region, has compromised the fundamental assumption of a stable climate used in designing the water supply system.\n\n2. Population growth vs water supply\n\nBetween 1996 and 2017, the population of the City of Cape Town surged from 2.4 million to an estimated 4.3 million, marking a 67% increase in over two decades. However, dam water storage only rose by 15% during the same period.\n\nThis rapid population growth has significantly impacted water demand, with many underestimating its effects due to inadequate forecasting that fails to consider indirect water usage through food and consumer goods production.\n\n3. Government failure\n\nIn South Africa, the responsibility for managing the water supply is divided among the local, provincial, and national governments. Meanwhile, the National Water Act of 1998 designates the national government as the “public trustee” of the country’s water resources.\n\nThis division of responsibility has led to tensions between the majority party-led national government (African National Congress, ANC) and the opposition-led local and provincial government (Democratic Alliance, DA).\n\nEach party blamed the other for the water crisis, with the DA criticized for lacking foresight in developing new water sources and infrastructure and the ANC accused of withholding funding to undermine the DA-led administration.\n\nReports by the South African Water Caucus suggested that issues such as mounting debt and corruption within the Department of Water and Sanitation hindered effective efforts to address the crisis.\n\nImpact of The Water Shortage Cape Town\n\nThe water crisis had far-reaching effects on the economy, public health, and safety.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe water crisis in the Western Cape Province led to the termination of 37,000 jobs and forced about 50,000 individuals below the poverty threshold due to job cuts, inflation, and rising food prices. Analysts projected tens of thousands of jobs were lost in the service, hospitality, and food industries.\n\n2. Public health\n\nHealth experts raised concerns regarding the potential spread of diseases through fecal-oral contamination due to decreased hand-washing practices. Given Cape Town’s population of over 4 million and a high population density of around 1500 km², there were fears that diseases like cholera could rapidly spread in impoverished neighborhoods without proper sanitation.\n\nIn addition, officials cautioned that waterborne illnesses such as typhoid fever, hepatitis A, and cholera could become more prevalent as residents stored water in contaminated containers.\n\n3. Agriculture\n\nAgriculture plays a crucial role in the Western Cape’s economy. Despite this, the agriculture sector had to reduce its water usage by 60% from 2017 to 2018. This resulted in decreased yields, an estimated economic loss of R5.9 billion (US$400 million), the loss of more than 30,000 jobs, and a 13–20% decline in exports.\n\n4. Tourism\n\nCape Town is a prominent tourist hub, welcoming the most long-haul visitors across the continent. However, the tourist industry faced significant challenges in January 2018, witnessing declines in arrivals, occupancy rates, and visitor traffic compared to the same period in 2017. The accommodation sector, in particular, experienced a 10% drop in occupancy.\n\nOther impacts of the Cape Town water crisis include fire risks, occupational hazards, and hydrological poverty.\n\nGovernment Initiatives to Mitigate the Water Crisis in Cape Town\n\nWhile the water shortage Cape Town persisted, efforts were made to augment water supply and reduce water demand from the Western Cape Water Supply System. The water crisis prompted exploration and investment in alternative water systems, which could help prevent other cities from experiencing the same level of water scarcity.\n\nThe City of Cape Town undertook significant initiatives to improve water supply, which included:\n\n● Purchasing an additional 2 million and 5 million liters of water per day from the Molteno Reservoir in Oranjezicht and the Atlantis Aquifer, respectively.\n\n● Commissioning three temporary desalination plants (operating under 2-year contracts) with capacities of two plants at 7 megaliters per day and one plant at 2 megalitres per day, located at Monwabisi, Strandfontein, the V&A Waterfront, and Cape Town Harbour.\n\n● Implementing the Zandvliet water recycling project.\n\n● These projects aimed to collectively generate an extra 144 million liters per day between February and July 2018. However, logistical and financial challenges plagued many of these initiatives, resulting in delays.\n\n2. The City enforced a reduction in water usage as follows:\n\n● The City initiated the ‘Save Like a Local’ campaign in October 2017 to engage tourists in city-wide drought interventions.\n\n● The limit for personal water usage was constantly reduced, with the lowest limit set at 50 liters per day per person, effective February 1, 2018.\n\n● Urban residents were urged to adopt water-saving measures such as refraining from flushing toilets after urination, using rainwater or greywater for flushing after defecation and reducing the shower time and frequency.\n\n● Hand sanitizers were available in offices and public buildings as an alternative to normal hand-washing methods.\n\n● Municipal water usage for activities like swimming pool refilling, lawn irrigation, or surface hosing was strictly prohibited.\n\nIt is estimated that approximately 50% of households complied with these water restrictions. The City implemented various measures to ensure compliance. These include:\n\n● They developed an online map that displayed green dots to highlight houses effectively conserving water.\n\n● City officials conducted neighborhood drives, using a bullhorn to address excessive water usage publicly.\n\n● Published the names of the highest water consumers.\n\n● Installed water-management devices in the houses of non-compliant residents, limiting consumption to 350 liters per day.\n\n● Increased law enforcement efforts to monitor and prevent water wastage.\n\n● Implemented increased water tariffs, particularly targeting residents consuming large amounts of water for non-essential purposes.\n\nIndividual and Organizational Efforts to Curb the Water Crisis in Cape Town\n\nIn its report, the World Economic Forum highlighted how individuals and businesses tried to reduce their dependence on municipal water sources to protect their water reserves.\n\n● During the peak of the drought in February 2018, the Groenland Water User Association, representing farmers in the Elgin Grabouw agricultural region near Cape Town, released an additional 10 million liters of water from their Eikenhof Dam for free. This water was diverted to the Upper Steenbras Dam, allowing the City to extend the projected “Day Zero” from April 16 to May 11.\n\n● Hotels implemented measures such as removing bath plugs, providing hand sanitizer to guests, installing shower suppressors, and draining pools entirely or filling them with salt water.\n\n● Some cafes opted to use disposable plastic and paper cups and plates to minimize the need for dishwashing.\n\n● Farmers embraced agricultural precision technology to enhance their understanding of water utilization on their farms. This includes researching wild plants that thrive with minimal water to transfer these traits to food crops through conventional breeding methods and biotechnology.\n\n● Locals resorted to collecting water from mountain streams and natural springs across the City.\n\n● Residents installed water storage tanks for rainwater collection and drilled private boreholes.\n\n● In the latter part of 2017, Shoprite (Africa’s largest retailer), Stellenbosch University, Cape Talk radio, and Bridgiot collaborated to launch an initiative aimed at conserving water through a combination of maintenance efforts and behavioral change programs implemented in schools.\n\nOther Cities in the World That Could Suffer Water Crisis in the Next 10 Years\n\nWhile several cities worldwide face the risk of running dry, none has experienced the rapid onset of this threat as Cape Town. However, as urbanization, population growth, and climate change continue to upset the balance between water use and supply, urban cities from North America to South America and from Australia to Asia increasingly face threats of severe drinking water shortages.\n\nBelow are 11 other cities that could run out of drinkable water in the next 10 years:\n\nLondon, UK\n\nSão Paulo, Brazil\n\nNew Delhi, India\n\nBeijing, China\n\nHarare, Zimbabwe\n\nCairo, Egypt\n\nMoscow, Russia\n\nKabul, Afghanistan\n\nCalifornia, USA\n\nSydney, Australia\n\nIstanbul, Türkiye\n\nPossible Ways Humans Have Contributed to Water Crisis Globally\n\nWater crisis does not develop overnight. While freshwater has always been a limited resource, inadequate management practices have significantly contributed to the ongoing water challenges worldwide. In essence, a lack of awareness about impending water shortages has led many of us to use water without consideration for its conservation.\n\nWays humans have contributed to the global water crisis include:\n\n● Water wastage\n\n● Poor water infrastructure\n\n● War and conflict\n\n● Inequality and power imbalance\n\n● Agriculture\n\n● Neglecting natural water systems\n\n● Water pollution\n\n● Lack of cooperation among nations regarding shared water resources.\n\nAs the global population continues to increase, the water demand also rises. In addition, the impacts of climate change are causing water stress in previously abundant regions worldwide. A major concern is that if current patterns of water overuse persist, by 2030, there could be a 40% deficit between water supply and demand.\n\nHow We Can Prevent Global Water Crisis\n\nIn its global water crisis management report, the United Nations Environment Programme outlined 7 ways we can save world cities from experiencing a water crisis. These include:\n\nProtect and restore natural spaces\n\nBe more water-efficient, especially while farming and save energy\n\nReduce water leaks\n\nExploit alternative water sources like wastewater recycling and saltwater desalination.\n\nTrack water quality to help policymakers emphasize measures to clean up water sources.\n\nCombine smart water management with climate change policies\n\nApply integrated approaches in decision-making\n\nWorldwide Efforts to Combat Water Crisis\n\nAccording to World Vision, a leading NGO provider of clean water in developing countries, the number of individuals lacking clean water dropped from 1.1 billion in 2000 to 703 million in 2022. Despite this decrease, significant challenges persist. However, world organizations have taken several actions to combat the global water crisis.\n\n1993: Every year, on March 22, the United Nations commemorates World Water Day to acknowledge the pressing need to tackle the worldwide water crisis.\n\n2000: The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were established by U.N. member states to outline development objectives. One of the MDGs aimed to halve the number of people lacking sustainable access to safe drinking water by 2015.\n\n2003: UN-Water was established as a central coordinating platform for addressing sanitation and improving access to freshwater resources.\n\n2005–2015: During the International Decade for Action, themed “Water for Life,” United Nations member states made developing water and sanitation initiatives a top priority.\n\n2008: The International Year of Sanitation, recognized by the United Nations, emphasized the importance of health and dignity as its main priorities.\n\n2010: The clean water access goal of the MDGs was accomplished five years earlier than anticipated. Since 1990, over 2 billion individuals have accessed safe drinking water.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly acknowledged the fundamental right of every individual to access sufficient water for personal and household needs, which must be physically available, distributed fairly, safe, and affordable.\n\n2013: November 19 was marked by the United Nations as World Toilet Day, aimed at bringing attention to the ongoing global challenge of billions of people lacking access to adequate sanitation facilities.\n\n2014: UN-Water introduces its Strategy for 2014–2020 in alignment with the goals of the 2030 Agenda.\n\n2015: The United Nations member states committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which succeeded the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) aims to ensure universal access to clean water and sanitation by 2030.\n\n2018: In response to the escalating challenge of water scarcity, the U.N. General Assembly inaugurated the Water Action Decade (2018–2028) on March 22, 2018, aiming to catalyze efforts to revolutionize water management practices.\n\n2018: United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, issued a worldwide appeal for Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) implementation in all healthcare facilities, emphasizing their pivotal role in disease prevention and mitigation.\n\n2020: UN-Water introduces the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework and the SDG 6 Action Space.\n\n2021: The 2021 Summary Progress Update was published by UN-Water.\n\n2023: The first U.N. Water Conference was held to mobilize Member States, the U.N. system, and stakeholders to actively work towards bringing successful solutions to a global scale.\n\n2024: The United Nations Environment Assembly approved a resolution advocating for improved management of aquatic ecosystems and enhanced international cooperation on water issues to promote sustainable development. In addition, World Environment Day 2024, hosted by Saudi Arabia, will prioritize building drought resilience.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough Cape Town may have recovered from severe water shortages, the City is still on the verge of another drought. The WEF predicts that water demand in South Africa could soar to 17.7 billion m³ by 2030, surpassing the country’s allocation capacity.\n\nThe Cape Town water crisis highlights three crucial lessons: the importance of engaging in water-efficient practices, establishing a resilient water supply infrastructure, and better integrating climate change factors into water management strategies. These, alongside water-efficient behavioral practices, will help better prevent water crises in different cities worldwide.\n\nPlease share this article with all your friends and family to sensitize that we should be alert and spread awareness about water conservation to avoid this kind of a situation."
