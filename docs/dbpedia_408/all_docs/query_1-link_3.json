        "text": "In what has been described as a significant oversight by the City of Cape Town’s water management authorities, the River Farm Trust blames the late opening of sluices at Wemmershoek Dam for the catastrophic flood damage in 2023, with losses estimated at more than R100 million.\n\nAnd now, with the 2024 rain season here, the River Farm Trust, representing various property owners along the Wemmershoek and Berg Rivers, has issued a formal complaint to the City of Cape Town, highlighting a series of mismanaged actions and the urgent need for policy revision.\n\nThe controversy centres around the City’s refusal to pre-release water from the dam unless it reaches full capacity—a policy that has been under scrutiny for more than two decades.\n\nAccording to the Trust, proactive water management could have prevented the extensive damage caused in mid-June 2023, when the dam’s sluice gates were opened to levels unseen in 35 years due to predicted heavy rainfall.\n\nThe decision not to pre-release water, despite the dam’s not being full and substantial rain forecast for the winter months, has been criticised as short-sighted and harmful. The trust argues that a modest pre-release of just 5% in the days leading up to the storms could have significantly mitigated the impact of the floods.\n\nCity officials retain their policy of maximising water storage for consumer use, which prohibits any pre-release of water. However, this does not account for flood abatement or reduction of downstream damage, which has now resulted in significant economic loss and environmental impact.\n\nFurther complicating matters, weather reports from the Cape Town Weather Office have predicted disruptive rainfall in the Berg River area. With the dam levels currently at 71% and rising, there is a real threat of repeated flooding unless the city revises its approach to dam management.\n\nThe River Farm Trust is calling for an urgent review of the administrative actions under the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, 2000, citing failures to consider relevant factors and the irrational connection between the policy and the substantial damage incurred.\n\nIt argues that the policy not only neglects the constitutional rights of property owners but also lacks rationality in the face of predictable rainfall patterns.\n\nIn an effort to resolve the issue without resorting to litigation, the trust has requested an urgent meeting with the Mayor, the Director of Bulk Services and the Manager of Bulk Water. Its goal is to discuss immediate measures to prevent future flooding and to establish a long-term policy that includes the possibility of pre-releasing water under similar circumstances.\n\nAs the situation develops the community remains on high alert, with hopes that the City of Cape Town will take swift action to prevent further damage and reconsider its water-management strategies in light of the changing climate and community needs.\n\nIn response to these demands, Mayco Member for Water and Sanitation Zahid Badroodien said the department had interacted with landowners along the Wemmers River regarding the operation of the dam.\n\n“The operating rules at Wemmershoek Dam were established to ensure water security for, among others, residents and businesses in the Drakenstein, Stellenbosch and Cape Town municipal areas and that discharge flows do not exceed the natural flows, that is, should the Wemmershoek Dam not have been built.”\n\nThe City has indicated it will set up a meeting with landowners to try and resolve this dispute without going to court."
