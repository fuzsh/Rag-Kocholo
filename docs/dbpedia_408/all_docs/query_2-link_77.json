        "text": "As with drylands globally, there has been limited effort to map and characterize wetlands in the Western Cape interior of South Africa. Thus, the study assessed how probable wetland occurrence and type in the predominantly arid to semi-arid interior of the Western Cape relate to key biophysical drivers and physiographic zones, and, through modelling, to predict spatially their likelihood of occurrence. The study further aimed to qualitatively assess the vulnerabilities of the identified wetland types to human impacts. Field-verified test areas were selected to represent the aridity gradient, rainfall seasonality, hydrogeomorphic (HGM) types and physiographic zones encompassed in the study area. The Little Karoo and Great Karoo plains physiographic zones, which were predominantly arid, had: (1) a low (0.7%) proportional area of wetland; (2) an almost complete absence of seepage slope wetlands; and (3) much of the wetland associated with valley bottoms confined within a channel. The three mountainous physiographic zones, which were semi-arid to sub-humid, had: (1) a much higher (2.6 to 5.2%) proportional area of wetland; and (2) wetlands being predominantly hillslope seepages. A spatial probability surface of wetland occurrence was generated based on the statistical relationship of verified wetland presence and absence data points with a range of catchment-scale predictor variables, including topographic metrics and hydrological/climatic variables. This layer was combined with raster images of most likely HGM type within the landscape to provide a final product of wetland occurrence, attributed by HGM type. Vulnerabilities of the wetlands to human impacts were identified based on key attributes of the different wetland types, and recommendations were provided for assisting with future mapping and HGM type identification for the Western Cape interior and for predominantly arid to semi-arid areas generally.\n\nInvasive alien plant species can be a major cause of ecosystem degradation in South Africa, and ecosystem recovery may require restoration interventions beyond controlling the target alien species. Active restoration interventions are usually required if legacy effects result from the invasion. Legacy effects may induce regime shifts when thresholds to autogenic recovery are breached. In such cases, active restoration interventions will be required to manipulate the ecosystem along a trajectory to recovery. In some cases, alien control measures may be sufficient to restore a structurally and functionally representative ecosystem, provided that implementation occurs early in the invasion process and that the control methods do not hamper spontaneous regeneration. It is important that key stakeholders discuss and set realistic restoration goals at the project planning stage. Studies on the costs and benefits of ecological restoration indicate that when important services are improved, benefits outweigh the costs of alien clearing (assuming spontaneous regeneration of the native ecosystem). The costs of moderate, active restoration interventions are economically viable, whereas the costs of fully restoring ecosystem structure, functioning and composition in highly degraded ecosystems are rarely deemed economically justifiable. Valuations of specific biodiversity components, such as threatened ecosystems and species, remain problematic to assess, and these components could be under-valued in such studies. South African researchers have made significant contributions to the theory and practice of restoration ecology globally and have produced local guidelines for ecological restoration. However, there has been limited uptake in implementing active restoration projects at larger scales. This apparent knowing-doing gap may have three causes: firstly, insufficient co-production by all stakeholders in planning restoration projects, including prioritisation and goal setting; secondly, shifting beyond clearing invasive alien species to restoring ecosystems; and thirdly, insufficient resources to implement active restoration projects at the necessary scale. To achieve Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, interventions must shift from controlling invasive alien species alone to restoring native ecosystem structure and functioning.\n\nEffective policies to protect groundwater-dependent ecosystems require robust methods to determine the environmental flows and levels required to support species and processes. Frameworks to support groundwater management must incorporate the relationships between hydrology and species and ecological processes. These hydro-ecological relationships can be used to develop quantitative, measurable thresholds that are sensitive to changes in groundwater quantity. Here we provide a case study from a group of fens in central Oregon, USA, that are used for cattle watering, but also support numerous sensitive species. We developed quantitative relationships between the position of the water table and wetland indicator plant species and the process of peat development, to propose groundwater withdrawal thresholds. A maximum depth to water table of –0.9 to –34.8 cm for fen plants and –16.6 to –32.2 cm for peat accretion can be tolerated in these wetlands. Defining hydro-ecological relationships as thresholds can support management decisions. Editor D. Koutsoyiannis; Guest editor M. AcremanCitation Aldous, A.R. and Bach, L.B., 2014.

Groenvlei is one of a series of 5 brackish coastal lakes along the Southern Cape coast of South Africa, but is the only one disconnected from the sea. It has been hypothesised that discharge from the underlying Table Mountain Group Aquifer sustains Vankervelsvlei, which in turn discharges into Groenvlei. This paper critically reviews the conceptual model and information on which the hypothesis was based. It is argued that the conceptual model is flawed as it does not take account of topographical and geohydrological conditions prevalent in the area. Analysis of limited hydrochemical data did not explore other possible water sources, and the electrical conductivity characteristics used to confirm the link between the wetlands and the deeper secondary aquifer also apply to 56.3% of boreholes located in a variety of aquifer types across the Western Cape Province. No information is available that supports a link to the Table Mountain Group. Rather, it appears that Vankervelsvlei is sustained by direct rainfall and there is no hydraulic link between Vankervelsvlei and Groenvlei.\n\nThe focus of this study was to determine whether coastal wetlands in lowland settings could be dependent on groundwater from the deep circulating confined Table Mountain Group (TMG) aquifer. Groundwater interactions with wetlands are normally perceived to be limited to primary aquifers. A comparative study was done between two endorheic coastal wetlands in the southern Cape. Earlier reports stated that these groundwater dependent wetlands were fed by discharges from the fixed dunes surrounding them. On the basis of a three-dimensional electrical conductivity (EC) interpolation for Groenvlei, a hydrological link between the TMG aquifer and Groenvlei and Van Kervelsvlei was investigated by measuring water level and quality of groundwater and surface water. Water quality parameters used were EC, pH, Na+, Fe2+ and Cl−. The results from this, and an accompanying study, on the basis of water quality and plant nutrient cycling assessments, indicated direct groundwater discharges from the TMG to at least Van Kervelsvlei, with Groenvlei receiving secondary discharges from the TMG via Van Kervelslvlei. These findings significantly affect the current knowledge on which water balance models are based for the determination of groundwater availability for the area.\n\nIntroduction Groundwater has recently received increased attention especially in arid and semi-arid regions due to its potential to serve as an alternative water source. The potential for groundwater resources to be a sustainable source of water is affected by various factors, e.g. recharge rates, hydraulic properties, groundwater quality, etc. Quantification of groundwater recharge is one of the key challenges in determining the sustainability of aquifers in arid and semi-arid regions. Recently the key focus has been to improve recharge quantifications by reducing the uncertainties associated with recharge estimation techniques. The aim of the study was to identify preferential flow paths in the unsaturated zone (Figure 1) in a fractured rock environment. This involves using 2D resistivity tomography to identify preferential flow in the subsurface, possible flow conducting structures (Figure 2) and interflow. The study was conducted in the Oudebos Catchment within the Kogelberg Bioshpere Reserve (Western Cape, South Africa, Figure 3). The geology at the site is dominated by the fractured Table Mountain Group (TMG) sandstones (Table 1). Figure 4 illustrates the location of the geophysical survey, which is interpreted to be representative of fractured TMG dominated areas. Experimental set up Borehole information Boreholes were drilled in the study area during a previous Water Research Commission project (Colvin et al., 2009). The borehole log (Figure 5) of a borehole in the immediate vicinity of the transect was use to correlate the resistivity images with the measured subsurface data (geological layering). Geophysical set up Acquisition The method used to identify preferential pathways is 2D resistivity tomography (Lund Imaging System), which is a geophysical method based on injecting current into the ground (Figure 6) and measuring the potential difference over a certain distance (Loke, 2001). . For each survey a Wenner array was used with 64 electrodes spaced 2 m apart. A total of 392 subsurface sample points were used with an acquisition time of 0.3 s and an acquisition delay time of 0.1 s. Process Processing of the data involves using software (RES2DINV) to do a least square inversion on the data. After a model is obtained , Time-Lapse analysis is performed on the data. Conclusion The results show distinct zones of changes in electrical resistivity which are interpreted to be associated with preferential flow paths. These zones exhibit a vertical \"fingering\" like pattern. The results of this investigation suggest that preferential flow may have a large effect, in terms of volume and temporal distribution, on groundwater recharge. Results also suggest that TLERT is a suitable method for identifying and potentially quantifying preferential flow. Recommendations The resolution of the images is directly related to the electrode spacing and the number of sample points taken. It is therefore recommended to use smaller electrode spacing and more data points. To enhance the resolution further it is suggested that one uses induced polarization.\n\nThe City of Cape Town (CCT) came close to running out of water during the 2015–2017 “Day Zero” drought, which would have had enormous societal and economic impacts. The CCT initiated its “New Water Programme “ in earnest in early 2018 to diversify its water supply to improve long-term water security and resilience against future droughts, by implementing alternative bulk water supply options to augment its potable water supply. Three main alternative bulk water supply options were identified, including desalination, water re-use and the abstraction of groundwater from three major aquifer systems that the city has access to, namely the Cenozoic coastal primary Atlantis Aquifer and Cape Flats Aquifer, and the Palaeozoic fractured Table Mountain Group aquifers. The planning and rapid implementation of municipal bulk water supply groundwater schemes under such extreme circumstances, compounded by the hydrological uncertainties associated with contemporary climate change in a region considered highly susceptible to future recurrence of extreme drought conditions, poses several geoethical issues. Because of the great local inequalities of Cape Town society, in which the poorest communities generally suffered most under the drought crisis, a “no-regrets approach” (which is essentially a geoethical approach) was adopted by the CCT. The CCT’s response to climate change and the optimisation of scarce resources therefore provides valuable lessons for other cities and municipalities, around South Africa and beyond its borders."
