        "text": "While the Western Cape has recently been blessed with a deluge of rain that has allowed dam levels across the province to rise significantly, the City of Cape Town has reminded residents of the vital importance of water and the need for responsible consumption.\n\nIt stated that by adopting water-saving habits, each individual can play an important role in the City’s joint mission of water conservation, ensuring a sustainable water future for Cape Town.\n\nAlso read: SA Agulhas II celebrates World Oceans Day with guided ship tours\n\nThe most recent update on Western Cape major dams shows a positive trend in water levels compared to the same period last year. Berg River, Steenbras Lower, Steenberg Upper, Theewaterskloof, Voelvlei and Wemmershoek dams now have a total storage capacity of 72.2%. This is an increase from the previous week’s 63.6% and a higher percentage than the combined percentage of 64.8% recorded a year ago.\n\nTheewaterskloof is the largest of these dams, accounting for more than half of the province’s total dam capacity, with 480,188 megaliters out of the total 898,221 megaliters. It is currently operating at 69% of its maximum capacity. With a capacity of 164,095 megaliters, the next significant dam, Volvlei, is at 45.6%.\n\nWhile these figures are encouraging, the City of Cape Town emphasised the importance of ongoing water conservation efforts, encouraging residents to continue their daily water-saving practises in order to ensure the longevity of the water supply and play an important role in securing Cape Town’s shared water future.\n\nCape {town} Etc discount: Enjoy a luxurious coastal getaway for two for R1 499 (valued at R2 400).
