        "text": "Disruptive rain and extreme weather conditions continue to wreak havoc on infrastructure and livelihoods across South Africa.\n\nThe Northern Cape, North West, Free State, Eastern Cape interior, and Western Cape provinces of South Africa have been experiencing wet, cold, windy conditions with light snow.\n\nA series of cold fronts is hitting the country, bringing widespread and disruptive snowfall over the southern and western high ground.\n\nThe extreme weather conditions are also leading to damaging winds over the interior and coastline and high seas along coastal areas.\n\nAt the Cape of Storms\n\nThe Western Cape has seen severe disruptions and damage, including loss of shelter in informal settlements, fallen trees, and road closures due to snow or flooding.\n\nDamaged electricity infrastructure is causing power outages, and municipalities are struggling to dispatch refuse collection trucks because of flooded roads.\n\nThe South African Weather Service (SAWS) updated weather warnings for Thursday 11 July from Level 6 to Level 8 for disruptive rainfalls in Western Cape municipalities as another intense cold front hit the region.\n\n“The Western Cape faces another cold front as the rest of the country gets a bit of a break from the hectic weather we’ve faced over the past few days. Strong interior winds are still forecast,” the SAWS said.\n\nAn additional 40-50mm of rain was predicted for the West Coast, Cape Winelands and Overberg municipal districts of the Western Cape.\n\nThe City of Cape Town’s Human Settlement Directorate has already issued more than 6,500 flood relief kits to affected residents in informal settlements across the metro, where feasible.\n\nSchool closures across the Western Cape because of extreme weather\n\nAccording to reports on Tuesday, the inclement weather in the Western Cape affected 7,000 structures in informal settlements across Cape Town after 70 neighbourhoods were flooded.\n\nThe Liesbeek, Lotus and Eerste rivers in Cape Town have all burst their banks.\n\n“We’re still expecting a lot of strong wind and rain this week. Please stay safe. City teams are addressing each localised flooding situation,” said Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis.\n\nElsewhere in Africa\n\nKenya: Water rationing in Nairobi after flood destroys infrastructure\n\nThe Western Cape Education Department (WCED) closed schools on Thursday 11 July in certain districts after consultation with the Provincial Disaster Risk Management Centre and the SAWS.\n\nSchools in the remaining districts will remain open unless approval for closure is granted on a case-by-case basis, as the WCED default position is to keep schools open.\n\nWestern Cape Minister of Education David Maynier said that so far, 20 schools have been granted permission to close across the province, most of which are in the Cape Winelands district.\n\n“Over the past few days, 137 schools have reported some form of damage to infrastructure, either as a result of flooding or heavy winds. The majority of the cases are minor, while 49 cases require our urgent attention.\n\n“I am extremely proud of our infrastructure team who are rapidly addressing the reports coming through. It is not easy in these continued extreme conditions; however, they are determined to reduce further damage and ensure structural safety.\n\n“Schools are expected to open on Friday, 12 July 2024. We will, however, evaluate the weather prediction for the end of the week to determine whether any individual school closures are necessary on Friday,” said Maynier.\n\nFire warnings in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN)\n\nMeanwhile the KwaZulu-Natal Province is dealing with extremely high fire danger conditions with the Fire Danger Index Value for Thursday 11 July sitting in the red at 75.\n\nWind conditions are expected to exceed 65km/h. Coupled with dry and warm to hot weather conditions forecast for the northern part of KZN, this creates conditions highly favourable to the development and rapid spread of fires.\n\nThe KZN Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs confirmed veld fires in uMlalazi Local Municipality in Eshowe, where a 67-year-old was tragically burnt to death when his house caught fire.\n\nKing Cetshwayo District is said to be one of the most affected areas, with uMfolozi, uMlalazi, Mthonjaneni and Nkandla being the hardest-hit municipalities.\n\nWeather-related paper of interest to you\n\nWhite paper: Analyse the impact of weather on your energy planning\n\nAccording to the provincial department, 144 people in the district were affected, leaving 53 people homeless after 48 homes were partially damaged and 27 destroyed.\n\n“The department is working closely with the municipality to ensure adequate support and relief for the affected families, with social partners setting up soup kitchens.”\n\nEastern Cape weather damage\n\nIn the Eastern Cape strong winds damaged houses and disrupted traffic flow on the roads as vehicles have been toppled over, on the N2 near Dutywa.\n\nThe Eastern Cape Transport Department said: “Road users, motorists in particular, are urged to be extra cautious or avoid being on the road completely if their travelling is not essential.”\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the provincial department finally reopened the Barkly Pass on the R58 Road between Barkly East and Elliot to traffic, after it was closed for 30 hours, due to heavy snowfall, on the morning of Monday.\n\n“Graders had to be used to clear off the thick blanket of snow that stubbornly covered the road surface.”\n\nSign up for our premium, curated insights and news\n\nExtreme weather and dams in South Africa\n\nThe DWS says dam levels across the Western Cape province are rising. By 5am on Tuesday morning the unverified levels reported were:\n\nTheewaterskloof Dam – 71%\n\nBerg River Dam – 97%\n\nClanwilliam Dam – 94%\n\nWemmershoek Dam – 83%\n\nThe Department of Local Government, CoCT and Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) met on Tuesday to discuss the controlled release of 50m3/second water from the Wemmershoek Dam into the Berg River as a proactive and precautionary measure.\n\nThis started on Tuesday and would last until at least Friday morning.\n\nThe controlled release of water would create a buffer to absorb some of the expected inflow from Thursday’s rain, reducing the risk of flooding downstream.\n\nMeanwhile, DWS called for the wise, sparing, and conservative use of the available water as water levels continue to drop in the listed dams, water management areas (WMA), and districts of the Mpumalanga Province.\n\nAccording to current predictions, SAWS expects the disruptive rain and stormy weather to last until Sunday, July 14.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about extreme weather in South Africa\n\nWhat is a Level 8 warning?\n\nA South African Weather Service (SAWS) Level 8 warning indicates the impact of the weather could be severe but there is a low likelihood of it occurring.\n\nWhat does a Level 8 storm warning mean for the Western Cape?\n\nThis means disruptive rain, leading to possible flooding and mudslides, specifically for the City of Cape Town, Drakenstein, and Stellenbosch municipalities in the Western Cape.\n\nIsn’t cold and wet weather normal for winter in Cape Town?\n\nDuring winter (May to August), Cape Town usually has cool, wet weather, with temperatures ranging from the mid-teens to the low-20s Celsius.\n\nDoes South Africa get tornados?\n\nSouth Africa has experienced extreme weather events in recent months. These include floods and an uncommon tornado in KZN, flooding in the Eastern Cape and mid-latitude cyclones in the Western Cape."
