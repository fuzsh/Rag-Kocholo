        "text": "[imagesource:wikimediacommons]\n\nFolks in the Western Cape need no reminding of life during the ‘Day Zero’ water crisis that did a number on us from mid-2017 to mid-2018.\n\nIn February this year, UCT News warned residents and visitors to keep their water usage down and implement water-saving measures in preparation for another possible water shortage situation. At the time the city’s water supply was fast dwindling because of the summer heat, shoddy rainfall, and inglorious use of one billion litres of water per day.\n\nIf the region was to receive lower-than-average rainfall for the year, Cape Town would not have been able to avoid water restrictions again. But the good news is that thanks to all the rain we’ve received in the past weeks, the dam levels are looking lekker.\n\nSA People noted that according to the City of Cape Town’s latest stats, the Western Cape dam levels have skyrocketed in recent weeks. That is, the six major dams in the province – the Berg River, Steenbras Lower, Steenberg Upper, Theewaterskloof, Voëlvlei, and Wemmershoek – are cumulatively more full compared to how they were in a similar period last year.\n\nTheewaterskloof, which accounts for more than 50% of the province’s total dam capacity (480 188 MI of a total of 898 221 MI) is at 77.2% of capacity, while the next biggest dam, Voëlvlei (164 095 MI), is at 53.9%.\n\nThe stunning stats show the six dams are at a combined 79,6% of total storage, which is up from the 70,5% in the previous week. A year ago the combined percentage stood at 64,8%, nogal.\n\nEven more good news is that the rain isn’t stopping anytime soon, with a significant amount of heavy rain forecast for the Western Cape in the coming days.\n\nHowever, this also means that flooding, landslides, and other such waterlogged disasters are on the rise. Cape Town ETC has a series of videos showing the flooding that has occurred in the last few days across Cape Town.\n\nThe South African Weather Service (SAWS) has sent out an Orange Level 6 warning, per News24, for disruptive rain, leading to major disruption of traffic:\n\n“This may result in the flooding of roads and settlements, as well as damage to property and infrastructure,” SAWS said. The City’s Disaster Risk Management Centre (DRMC) said their teams were still assessing the situation to determine the extent of the overnight damage and any assistance that may be required.\n\nThe bursting of river banks has already led to flooding at the Johnson & Johnson factory in Tokai, and the Lourens River flooding had affected the Somerset West Eskom substation.\n\nA host of informal settlements in Philippi, Strand, Gugulethu, Mfuleni, Masiphumelele and Khayelitsha have also been flooded, while various roadways were also affected by temporary stormwater overflows, uprooted trees, and mud on the road surface.\n\nStay safe out there, folks."
