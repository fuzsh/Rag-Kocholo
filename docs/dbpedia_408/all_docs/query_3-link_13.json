For access to the interactive Dam Level Model, click here to download. For the Dam Level Model User Guide, click here. Although some dam levels are increasing with rainfall, the Western Cape is still at risk and therefore the South African Weather Service (SAWS) has recommended that drought measures continue for the foreseeable future. As such businesses need to plan for a new normal.\n\nFor the most updated Water Dashboard showing dam levels for the City of Cape Town click here. All the drought-related updates from the City of Cape Town can be found here.\n\nWhile many businesses are based in Cape Town, operations and supply chains may be located in other parts of the Western Cape. Thus it is critical for businesses to be aware of the water situation across the province."
