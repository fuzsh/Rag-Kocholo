        "text": "In this study, the Fish Assemblage Integrity Index (FAll) was applied on three rivers within the southwestern Cape. This index uses fish as indicators of biological aquatic integrity and is based on indigenous species expected to be present in biological fish habitats. Fish integrity classes were calculated for each of the sites in the three rivers studied. Sites 2 and 4 within the Lourens River were rated as Class C, whereas sites 1 and 3 were rated as Class F and Class D respectively. Sites 1, 2 and 4 within the Palmiet River were rated Class F, whereas sites 3 and 5 were rated as Class E and Class D respectively. Site 1 within the Hout Bay River was rated as a Class F site, in addition to sites 2 and 3 been rated as Class A. It is however, suggested that the FAll needs to be adjusted to accommodate the general low species richness experienced in the southwestern Cape. In addition to the FAll been applied, the effects of long-term exposure to subtle water quality changes associate...\n\nThe major rivers of the South African ‘Lowveld’ (low-latitude savanna) suffer numerous impacts from upstream economic activities. Whereas monitoring these rivers is required to detect biodiversity losses, record pollution events and devise mitigation strategies, current monitoring programmes are inadequate. In 2009, the South African Earth Observation Network initiated an intensive long-term research programme on the Lowveld reaches of the Olifants River. Physico-chemical parameters, aquatic macroinvertebrates and fish abundances were recorded at four Lowveld sites in the Olifants River. We review six years of this programme. The results suggest deterioration in the ecological condition of the Olifants River with no discernible improvement through protected areas. Trends could not be detected. The parameters measured, sampling methods and/or sampling frequency might be responsible for the limited trends observed, or alternatively the results simply reflect stable conditions despite on-going pollution. Real time monitoring and an expansion in the parameters monitored would add value to the monitoring programme.\n\nThe Ecological Reserve (environmental flows) as defined under the South African National Water Act 36 of 1998 was designed to equitably manage water for river sustainability while maximizing economic and social welfare. We investigated the climate change impacts on the Ecological Reserve targets for a seasonal river in an agricultural catchment in the Western Cape region using the Habitat Flow Stressor Response method (which integrates hydrology, hydraulics, water quality, and ecological data) under projected climate scenarios (2041–2070). Current Ecological Reserve model outcomes for 3 sites on the Doring River were compared with the future hydrology using Global Circulation Models associated with four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6–8.5). Climate predictions reflected reduced future flows, but the uncertainty band of predicted future flows overlapped with present day flows. Flood flashiness following heavy rains and the increased length of dry periods that are predi...\n\nFreshwater conservation planning, while lagging behind terrestrial conservation planning, is beginning to be implemented in a complementary manner to the latter. Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife is currently preparing an aquatic conservation plan for the freshwater systems of KwaZulu-Natal. The development of a freshwater conservation plan requires an initial understanding of the broad characteristics of the resource and associated biodiversity. Within KwaZulu-Natal, which is water-rich relative to the remaining provinces in South Africa, there are approximately 585 000 ha of mapped freshwater wetlands, 17% of which fall within protected areas. At the 1:500 000 scale, there are in excess of 18 400 km of perennial and ephemeral rivers mapped, and just over 1 000 km (5.6%) of these fall within existing formal protected areas. The river systems feed into 79 estuaries covering a mapped area of over 30 600 ha, of which 41% amounting to almost 12 400 ha are found largely within protected areas, although this does not reflect the actual number protected. These freshwater resources provide over 28% of South Africa’s total average MAR. Protection of this resource requires the protection of freshwater biodiversity, and the processes which maintain these ecosystems. Currently the greatest threats to this resource are river regulation and land transformation.\n\nAs a major tributary of the Nyl River, and ultimately for the Nylsvley wetland, the Olifantspruit, Limpopo province, South Africa, was investigated during the summer (high flow) and winter (low flow) of 2007 at three sites. This preliminary study used physical and biological indicators to determine the quality of the water that ultimately flows into Nylsvley. Significant seasonal differences were found. The observed differences relate to habitat structural differences and human activities in the catchment. Key findings included higher water temperatures during the high-flow period than during the low-flow period. The higher temperatures were accompanied by lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen at all sites. In total, 13 fish species were recorded, with most being found in the pool biotopes. The Nantes site, located nearest to the Nylsvley wetland, had the highest number of fish species, possibly indicating a linkage between these two systems. The most common macroinvertebrate families were the Baetidae, Aeshnidae and Coenagrionidae. It can be assumed that this river acts as an important refuge area for fish and macroinvertebrates from the Nyl River, and therefore it is important to conserve the Olifantspruit.\n\nThe use of rapid assessment protocols for bioassessment of streams and rivers is gaining prominence all over the world. In Africa, biotic indices are limited and only the South African Scoring System Version 5 (SASS5) has been validated for use in southern Africa. However, the popularity of SASS5 has seen its adoption for use in many countries in southern and eastern Africa, with modifications now available for Tanzania and Ethiopia. In Kenya, efforts are being made to adopt and modify SASS5 to suit local conditions. This study aimed at determining the suitability of the SASS5 protocol in the Mara River, Kenya. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected from different biotopes during the wet season to generate qualitative presence-absence and quantitative data. There were no significant differences between field-and and laboratory based site scores based on paired t-tests (p&gt;0.05). There were significant differences in the number of taxa and ASPT Scores among sites for both field- ...\n\nMonitoring on the Lowveld reaches of the Olifants River, Limpopo River System, and its Steelpoort, Blyde, Klaserie and Selati tributaries was initiated in 2009. Analysis of the 2009–2015 data from four Olifants River sites showed deterioration in the river’s ecological condition between where it enters the Lowveld and where it enters the Kruger National Park, with a slight recovery within the Kruger National Park. Physico-chemical, aquatic macroinvertebrate and fish data collected in 2009–2015 at six sites on the Steelpoort, Blyde, Klaserie and Selati tributaries of the Olifants River corroborated the ecological condition of these tributaries. The Selati was the most polluted and was in a critically modified condition, whereas the Klaserie and Steelpoort were in fair condition and the Blyde was in good condition. The Selati appeared to have a significant negative impact on the water quality, macroinvertebrates and fish of the Olifants River within the Kruger National Park."
