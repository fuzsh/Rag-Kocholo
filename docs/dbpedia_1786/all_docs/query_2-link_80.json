        "text": "Police were recently able to apprehend a 24-year-old Oak Harbor man, a convicted domestic abuser, who illegally possessed five guns, court documents state.\n\nDavid Grose pleaded not guilty in Island County Superior Court April 22 to unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun, four counts of unlawful possession of a firearm and possession with intent to deliver marijuana.\n\nOfficer Patrick Horn with the Oak Harbor Police wrote in his report that a 26-year-old W. Whidbey Avenue resident called 911 April 10 to report her boyfriend, Grose, was angry and throwing her things out the back door. She was worried that he would hurt her.\n\nOfficer Horn wrote that he smelled marijuana in the bedroom. The woman told him that Grose sells pot, which she thought he kept in a gun safe, the report states.\n\nHorn got a search warrant and returned to search the safe. Inside the safe, the officers found three bags of marijuana, a shotgun with a sawed-off barrel, a .30-.30 Marlin rifle, a .22-caliber revolver, a .40-caliber Glock handgun, a scale and a wallet with $1,070 in cash, the report states.\n\nAccording to court documents, Grose had previously been convicted of a domestic-violence-related charge of assault in the fourth degree, which makes possession of a firearm illegal."
