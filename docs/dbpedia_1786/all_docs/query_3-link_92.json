        "text": "Paleontology is the scientific study of fossils to understand non-human ancient life and its history. Individuals who practice paleontology are called paleontologists. Many people think that paleontologists only study dinosaur fossils. Some do, but most paleontologists do not.\n\nMicropaleontologists study tiny fossils like foraminifera that are difficult to see without a microscope; they use these fossils to document ancient climates and compare the ages of rocks found in different regions.\n\nInvertebrate paleontologists study fossils of animals that lack backbones. Examples include trilobites and shells of brachiopods, clams, snails, and ammonites. Invertebrate fossils have been used to document ancient mass extinction events.\n\nVertebrate paleontologists study fossils of animals with backbones. Dinosaurs like T. rex were vertebrates, as were Megalodon (shark), Tiktaalik (fishapod), and the wooly mammoth (mammal).\n\nFinally, paleobotanists study ancient plant life. Their research helps us to reveal what ancient ecosystems on land looked like, as well as to document ancient climate."
