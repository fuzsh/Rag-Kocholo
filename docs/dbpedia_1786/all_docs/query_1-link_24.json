        "text": "A major in classics is excellent preparation for a wonderful variety of professions including business, government, medicine, law, management, and publishing. A degree in classics is especially valuable for jobs requiring refined analytical skills, including sciences. The classics major also prepares students for graduate work in all areas of classical studies, including archaeology, language and literature, ancient history, and museum studies. Students of archaeology have opportunities in the fields of historical preservation and cultural resources management. Careers in teaching Latin at the high school level are particularly rewarding, and skilled teachers are very much in demand.\n\nCareers for Classicists, by Ken Kitchell, is an excellent resource for further information.\n\nA sampling of jobs held by recent graduates of the UMass Amherst classics department:\n\nPrimary Faculty Assistant, W.E.B.
