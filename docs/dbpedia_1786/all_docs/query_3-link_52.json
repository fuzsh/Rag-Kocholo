        "text": "Archaeologists study the history of the human settlement through the examination of material remains of the past such as pottery, tools, landscape features and buildings. Such studies may focus on sites, buildings, landscapes and the general environment. They seek to understand the landscape, vegetation and climate of previous times as they affected, and were affected by, past peoples. Archaeologists work in survey and excavation, in environmental impact assessment, in heritage conservation projects and tourism initiatives.\n\nFieldwork involves taking part in excavations and identifying, recording and conserving objects. Other work can involve laboratory analysis, research, heritage management and giving planning advice. The study crosses science/arts boundaries and a wide range of scientific techniques are used.\n\nWork activities\n\nAssessing the impact of proposed developments on archaeological remains.\n\nPlanning and undertaking excavation/archaeological testing and monitoring projects.\n\nCollecting and analysing archaeological data.\n\nPreparing and writing reports.\n\nNegotiating between archaeological services and developers.\n\nPerforming artefact work (usually museum based).\n\nResearching, lecturing and administration.\n\nWork conditions\n\nTravel: during working day is frequent while absence from home at night is occasional.\n\nWorking hours: varies greatly depending on type of work and location. Occasionally weekend / evening work may be required.\n\nLocation: work is mainly outdoors and opportunities exist throughout the country.\n\nOpportunities for self-employment: possible.\n\nTypical employers\n\nThere are numerous employment opportunities in Ireland outside of academia:\n\nCommercial archaeological companies.\n\nStatutory bodies such as the National Roads Authority.\n\nThe state heritage sector.\n\nCentral government bodies such as the National Monuments Service.\n\nLocal authorities and planning offices.\n\nCareer development\n\nGood in private sector but promotion in state and university sector is slow due to the lack of recruitment in either of these areas.\n\nSalaries\n\nSalaries vary depending on employer size and location.\n\nEntry requirements\n\nA minimum of an archaeology degree is the most common qualification if one wants to become a licensed archaeologist. Licenses are granted by the Director of Monument Services, Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to those who pass a competency interview.\n\nOther relevant degree subjects\n\nAnthropology\n\nArchaeology\n\nArchive and museum studies\n\nBotany/Plant science\n\nClassics/Greek and Roman civilisation\n\nGeography\n\nHistory\n\nLife and medical sciences\n\nPhysical/Mathematical/Applied science\n\nTextile technology.\n\nPostgraduate study\n\nA pre-entry postgraduate qualification is not a requirement but can be beneficial.\n\nTraining\n\nSome training may be provided after entry, in terms of excavation techniques, digging, recording and surveying, otherwise one learns by experience with different organisations.\n\nInformal training can be in the form of reading journals or attending conferences and workshops.\n\nTips for applications\n\nPre-entry experience is desirable.\n\nSkills and qualities\n\nCuriosity about the past combined with patience and an eye for detail.\n\nAbility to logically piece together information from findings.\n\nGood practical skills to excavate carefully and to handle delicate objects.\n\nHigh levels of motivation, physical stamina and a willingness to work in all weather conditions.\n\nGood communication, organisational and interpersonal skills.\n\nKnowledge of industry specific tools and such as Total Station (EDM) and AutoCAD.\n\nLabour market information\n\nCommercial archaeology is a growing sector in Ireland, servicing the requirements of various development agencies."
