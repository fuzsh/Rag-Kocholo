        "text": "Election Science, Administration, & Research Conference: Call for Proposals\n\nProfessor Christian Grose of the USC Political Science and Public Policy Department and Mindy Romero, founder and director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy (CID), are set to co-chair the upcoming Election Sciences, Reform, and Administration (ESRA) conference at the University of Southern California (USC) in May 2024.\n\nChristian Grose, who is the Academic Director of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, brings a wealth of experience in political science and public policy. His commitment to bridging academic research with real-world policy solutions is evident through his leadership at the institute.\n\nMindy Romero, a political sociologist with a Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of California, Davis, is renowned for her work in understanding political behavior and race/ethnicity. As the founder and director of CID, part of the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy, Romero focuses on explaining patterns of voting and political underrepresentation, particularly among youth and communities of color.\n\nThe ESRA conference, a flagship event dedicated to election science, reform, and administration, is a testament to the duoâ€™s dedication to advancing the understanding of elections. Drawing together election experts from academia, government, non-profits, and research institutes, the conference aims to develop empirical approaches to studying how laws and administrative procedures impact the quality of elections in the United States.\n\nWith a collaborative atmosphere at its core, the ESRA conference serves as a crucial platform for participants to engage with cutting-edge research on election administration. Past presenters and attendees have included senior academics, junior scholars, election administrators, poll workers, nonprofit organizations, computer scientists, developers, and technology organizations.\n\nThe 2024 conference, currently in the planning stages, promises to continue this tradition of excellence. It provides an opportunity for professionals and experts to connect, fostering dialogue and discussions on the challenges faced by state and local election officials. Individuals interested in participating or staying informed about the conference can sign up for the mailing list through the conference website.\n\nCall for Proposals\n\nThe Election Science, Reform, and Administration (ESRA) invites participation from scholars and election administrators/officials to participate as panelists in the 2024 ESRA conference in Los Angeles, California. This call for proposals is open through February 16, 2024 at 5pm Pacific Time. Find more information and submit your proposal below or click HERE for more information:"
