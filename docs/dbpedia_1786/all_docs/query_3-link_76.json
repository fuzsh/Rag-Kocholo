        "text": "Classic blockbuster movies like Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider and The Mummy paint a pretty spectacular picture of archaeology, but is it really all whips, hair flips and battling the undead?\n\nIn reality, archaeologists spend more time collecting data and recording findings than they do wielding revolvers and pioneering dangerous expeditions into the jungle. But we still think delving into history, uncovering past civilisations and protecting heritage sites is exciting work.\n\nAnd what about the less titillating (but very important) aspects of pursuing archaeology as a career? We're talking about job security, career progression, salary and work environment, to name a few. These things need to be considered when weighing up if the field of archaeology is right for you.\n\nWe talk to two UQ graduates working in archaeology about their jobs, how they broke into the industry, what makes a good archaeologist and the common myths about this frequently romanticised career that they’re keen to debunk.\n\nArchaeology career paths\n\nWhat skills do you need to be an archaeologist?\n\nHow to get a job in archaeology\n\nArchaeologist salary\n\nArchaeology career paths\n\nLet’s clear something up from the get-go: archaeology isn’t just about archaeological digs.\n\nKate Moody, a UQ graduate and archaeologist with the Tasmanian Government, wants you to know that there’s much more to the role than getting your hands dirty, even though this can be an exciting part of it.\n\n“There’s often a general misconception of what archaeology is (it’s not just excavation!) and this translates into confusion or misunderstanding about a career in archaeology,” says Kate.\n\nSo, what types of jobs can you do after studying archaeology?\n\nThere are many career paths you can explore with a university degree in archaeology. The type of job you choose may rely heavily on your focus during your studies. For example, you may be interested in a specific time period in history, or a certain civilisation, or perhaps you’re more fascinated by maritime archaeology as a sub-field. Whatever the case, there are a variety of roles you can choose from, in a diverse range of organisations including government departments, consulting firms, universities, museums and large corporations such as mining and resource companies.\n\nYou may find yourself working as a:\n\nconservationist\n\nacademic researcher\n\narchaeologist\n\nheritage consultant or manager\n\nmuseum curator\n\nmuseum education officer.\n\nIn Australia, many graduates tend to go down the cultural heritage path with their career, which involves protecting sites of historical significance affected by development projects, such as mining and construction.\n\nWhat’s it like to work in the field of archaeology?\n\nTony Miscamble is a senior heritage consultant with NGH Consulting, and despite many people’s assumption that careers in archaeology involve predominantly solo work during excavations and documentation stages, Tony is quick to point out that his role is very people focused.\n\n“Our clients include Aboriginal parties, proponents and government agencies,” says Tony.\n\n“My role involves interacting with representatives of these different groups to ensure development projects comply with our legal and moral obligation to not harm our cultural heritage.”\n\nIn fact, Tony reveals that one of the things he loves most about his job is the opportunity to learn from different groups of people.\n\n“I love working with Aboriginal people and walking on Country with them,” he says.\n\n“Every day has the potential for discovery and for learning from each other.”\n\nA day in the life of a senior heritage consultant\n\nTony’s role includes a combination of office and field work. His day-to-day duties in the office include:\n\nwriting and/or reviewing tender proposals, safety documents and survey reports\n\ncompiling, analysing and mapping field data\n\nmeeting with clients and colleagues\n\norganising logistics.\n\nWhen Tony’s in the field, his day usually looks a little something like this:\n\nAssemble a field team of up to 12 individuals for a safety pre-start meeting.\n\nDiscuss the objectives and methods for the day.\n\nDrive to the site to excavate or survey.\n\nUse tablets to record archaeological data and images, and track logs.\n\nMake observations and field notes.\n\nMonitor the health and safety of the field crew throughout the day.\n\nProvide navigation back from the site.\n\nCheck, clean and upload data collected.\n\nArchaeologist responsibilities can vary depending on the nature of the role, but many are expected to take on leadership duties as their career progresses. On top of industry-specific training, archaeologists working in the field are often required to undergo first aid and 4WD training.\n\nIs it hard to be an archaeologist?\n\nThere are two ways to view this question – is it difficult to study and work in archaeology, and is it a competitive industry to break into?\n\nLet’s firstly address the question so often asked by popular media: is archaeology a dying field?\n\nHere’s what the Australian Archaeological Association have to say about it:\n\n“Archaeology is an employment growth area, and this is likely to continue. The rapid expansion of the cultural heritage management industry over the last three decades has created demand in the private sector for graduates with archaeological skills.”\n\nTony agrees with this viewpoint, further explaining how the Australian and global economies can impact career opportunities in archaeology.\n\n“Most working archaeologists in Australia are employed in the private sector, and the majority of them would be working in resources, infrastructure and renewable energy,” he says.\n\n“Well-paid career opportunities will continue to grow and follow the trajectory of the Australian economy, particularly as the global economy decarbonises.”\n\nWhat skills do you need to be an archaeologist?\n\nWhether your strengths and soft skills are suited to a career in archaeology will certainly dictate how difficult you will find studying and working in the field.\n\nSo, archaeologist skills: what are they?\n\n“I think patience and attention to detail are helpful skills, as well as a genuine interest in and appreciation of cultural heritage and history,” says Kate.\n\nTony emphasises again that archaeology – and cultural heritage management in particular – focuses on people, so strong interpersonal and communication skills are a huge asset. An aptitude for, and love of, working collaboratively will also make any job in this area much more enjoyable.\n\nHow to get a job in archaeology\n\nBecause archaeology is so heavily based in research and focuses on building a specific skillset, university level studies are required to break into the industry.\n\nMost archaeologists undergo 4 years of undergraduate study, including an honours year which gives individuals the chance to hone in on their areas of interest.\n\n“My honours year in particular, with its focus on conducting, analysing and communicating a small research project, developed important skills and introduced me to a variety of archaeologists conducting research in Australia,” says Tony.\n\n“Those connections in turn helped me develop a platform of skills and experience relevant to my career in cultural heritage management.”\n\nBut when considering how to get into archaeology, Kate says you need to go above and beyond your structured studies.\n\n“In addition to my university classes, I also had the opportunity to be involved with a number of exciting and enriching archaeology projects and excavations, both overseas and within Australia.”\n\n“This not only gave me invaluable experience when I went to apply for roles, but it also helped me identify which aspects of archaeology I particularly enjoyed and was interested in,” she says.\n\nKate encourages anyone studying archaeology to look into volunteering and fieldwork, to further their skills and increase their employability when searching for archaeology graduate jobs.\n\nTony agrees, adding that taking every opportunity to expand your network of contacts within the industry is vital. He also recommends developing your own ‘unique selling proposition’ to help you stand out from other graduates.\n\n“For me that was an interest in drones and the ways aerial imagery and photogrammetry could help solve archaeological problems, record and present archaeological findings,” says Tony.\n\nFor those interested in pursuing a career in cultural heritage management, Tony’s advice is straightforward.\n\n“Focus on developing good GIS literacy and reliable stone tool identification skills, as these will serve you well almost every day in your future career.”\n\nDo archaeologists get paid well?\n\nAn archaeologist’s salary depends on many factors, with the sector they’re working in and their level of experience being two of the most impactful. On average, archaeologists in Australia make around $71,000 a year (based on 69 salary profiles on Payscale.com).\n\nEntry-level positions generally start at around $60K and mid-career archaeologists tend to earn around the $80K mark, while archaeologists with over 20 years of experience can be earning $145K.\n\nDo archaeologists get to travel?\n\nTravel is a key component of a career in archaeology, both within Australia and abroad. Depending on your specialisation, specific role and areas of interest, you may find yourself seeking employment around the globe. But there’s some pretty cool stuff right here on our doorstep too.\n\n“In my current role, I am lucky enough to undertake fieldwork in some stunning wilderness areas of Tasmania, which is a privilege as many of these areas are quite remote and are not easily accessible,” says Kate.\n\nTony speaks honestly about the nature of travel in his work, outlining both the exciting and challenging aspects of it.\n\n“The nature of cultural heritage work in Australia involves travelling to remote and regional locations, so there is a lot of fly-in-fly-out (FIFO) and drive-in-drive-out (DIDO) work – good for frequent flyer points but challenging for relationships,” he says.\n\n“You will get to see places and meet people way off the main street. If you are drawn to the challenge and adventure of that, then you’ll thrive.”\n\nWorking with likeminded, passionate people\n\nThose who pursue a career in archaeology are often passionate people with a real love for what they do. There are many challenging aspects to being an archaeologist, but also countless rewarding experiences. Many of these experiences revolve around collaborating with others.\n\n“Moments of shared excitement about finds and the many laughs enjoyed in the field are among the greatest joys in the job,” says Tony.\n\nHe shares some tips for moving in archaeological circles and being part of a relatively small industry.\n\n“In general, be honest, consistent and authentically yourself. Be someone that others will want to work with, whether that is in an air-conditioned office or long, hard days in difficult conditions,” he says.\n\n“Be good at what you do and have a sense of humour. Archaeology is a small community, and your reputation is important because it not only follows you, but also arrives before you.”\n\nThink a career in archaeology is for you? Before you leave to explore your study options, let’s return to that all important question: is archaeology all it’s portrayed to be in the movies? Tony has some parting advice."
