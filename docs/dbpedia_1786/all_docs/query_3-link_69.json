        "text": "Archaeologists study artifacts from recent and distant human history to learn more about human culture and how people who came before us lived. They learn ancient languages and sometimes explore far corners of the earth. Archaeology can be a rewarding career for history enthusiasts who do not mind getting dirty in the field.\n\nArchaeology can be a rewarding career path for history buffs who like to get their hands dirty. Archaeologists work in many different settings — outside of the field, in museums and even colleges as teachers — and the study and time it takes to become one may seem daunting. But for the right kind of person, it can be a challenging journey.\n\nWhat Is an Archaeologist?\n\nAn archaeologist is someone who specializes in the study of the near and distant past. They use this study to help learn more about earlier cultures and societies.\n\nWhat Does an Archaeologist Do?\n\nArchaeologists wear many hats, but their primary role in our society is to help understand humanity’s past. They use material remains — the things people from the past created, modified or used — to study cultures and learn how people lived in specific times and places.\n\nWhen we think about archaeology, the immediate picture that comes to mind is probably someone like Indiana Jones, a swashbuckling type who travels the world and excavates vast historic structures to find and save exotic artifacts.\n\nWhile it can be an exciting field of study for the right person, the job involves a lot of research, planning and collaboration. Archaeologists work with professionals in other disciplines, like linguists and historians. That means less adventure and more reading.\n\nArchaeologists perform archival research, which involves uncovering written records that deal with the culture they want to study. They seek primary historical documents in libraries, courthouses or even people’s homes.\n\nOf course, the most common image of an archaeologist is of the one digging in the field. And that is a crucial part of the job. Archaeologists use all kinds of equipment to uncover their findings. These tools include:\n\nTrowels\n\nDustpans\n\nToothbrushes\n\nTape measures\n\nScanning Electron Microscopes\n\nSteps To Become an Archaeologist\n\nThinking about becoming an archaeologist? The requirements for this job involve a lot of studying and field work. For someone unafraid of spending time in the classroom, the undergraduate and graduate requirements can take several years.\n\n1. Attend a Field School (Optional)\n\nField schools are often a fantastic introduction to the daily work of archaeologists. More importantly, many programs recommend attending one before doing the lion’s share of undergraduate study.\n\nAt a field school, future archaeologists receive exposure to excavation and artifact processing techniques. They also see a taste of public speaking roles by explaining dig sites and archaeology to visitors. In return, most field schools offer college credit toward completing archaeology or anthropology degree programs.\n\nAttending a field school and completing work there is a necessary step for professional archaeologists, per historic preservation guidelines and standards provided by the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n2. Obtain a Bachelor's Degree\n\nArchaeology students must earn their bachelor’s degree first, which means attending an accredited university for a four-year Bachelor of Arts (BA) in archaeology. In some cases, an anthropology or sociology degree may also suffice.\n\nArchaeology programs are actively hands-on, severely limiting the ability to take online courses. Though they are rare, some do exist.\n\n3. Find an Internship\n\nA hands-on internship between academic years allows prospective archaeologists to gain practical skills and network for future career growth. Depending on a person’s interest and focus of study, they can intern with the National Park Service, prestigious museums like the Smithsonian Institution or even other universities with archaeological projects.\n\n4. Earn a Master's Degree\n\nA master’s degree is often the next step in pursuing an archaeology career because those without are usually limited to field or lab assistant roles. The Register of Professional Archaeologists (RPA) requires postgraduate study as part of its professional qualifications.\n\n5. Decide on a Doctorate\n\nWhile a master’s degree opens many doors, some students continue their education for a few more years to achieve a doctoral degree in a specific study area. Those with PhDs in archaeology can work as principal investigators or academic archaeologists who teach others.\n\n6. Join an Archaeology Organization\n\nArchaeologists who join professional organizations and take advantage of networking opportunities enjoy many benefits, including the ability to learn from peers. The RPA and other groups like the Society for American Archaeology (SAA) and Archaeological Institute of America award grants, too, to help support archaeological studies throughout the country.\n\n7. Create an Impressive Resume\n\nThe best way to find work as an archaeologist is to build an impressive resume that showcases work ethic, knowledge and skills. By partnering with experienced mentors and organizations through internships and entry-level positions, an archaeologist can find their first role in this exciting field.\n\nFieldwork is one of the essential qualities prospective employers look for, so take the opportunity to find those experiences throughout the whole course of an undergraduate and graduate career.\n\n8. Find Employment\n\nAfter obtaining the requisite education, it is time to find that first job. Many archaeologists start as field or lab assistants. Some jobs require physical stamina and strength to reach research sites with equipment, while others focus more on the research side.\n\nTypes of Archaeologists\n\nArchaeologists fulfill many different roles for institutions and companies, which means different areas of specialty exist.\n\nClassical Archaeologists\n\nClassical archaeologists study the material culture of the ancient Mediterranean world. Their work typically focuses on Ancient Greece and Rome, although their studies can also include other epochs and cultures in the surrounding area, including Egypt and Roman Britain.\n\nHistorical Archaeologists\n\nHistorical archaeology uses oral histories, artifacts and documentaries to interpret the past. It relies on material culture to help inform race, class, gender, ethnic identities and other qualities.\n\nUnderwater Archaeologists\n\nUnderwater archaeologists use their skills to recover information from shipwrecks and other underwater sites to help understand the cultures of sea-faring societies from the past. These archaeologists put great care into preserving the delicate artifacts found beneath the sea. Underwater archaeologists must be diligent when removing or exploring these aquatic sites.\n\nEthnoarchaeologists\n\nThe work of ethnoarchaeologists is unique because they study today’s technologically primitive people to understand the past. In many cases, they can provide a window into how ancient civilizations in these geographical locations functioned.\n\nAviation Archaeologists\n\nAviation archaeologists fill a unique niche in that they focus exclusively on seeking out and documenting airplane crash sites. They perform this role to help better understand how and why crashes happen. They also seek to preserve the sites and the history surrounding them.\n\nEnvironmental Archaeologists\n\nEnvironmental archaeology studies how past humans interacted with the natural world, including plants, animals or landscapes. They explore people’s impact on the world and how their surroundings affect them. Several subcategories of environmental archaeology exist, including those focusing on animals, plants and the soil that early humans relied on.\n\nSkills Needed to Become an Archaeologist\n\nArchaeologists rely on several skills to do their jobs well. While some professionals may use different skill sets depending on their focus, many high achievers in this field use some combination of the following to excel.\n\nAttention to Detail\n\nArchaeologists look for minute details in artifacts and the surrounding area. They must be capable surveyors and be able to see the hidden story behind the items they handle.\n\nCommunication\n\nArchaeologists need excellent writing skills, especially when sharing their findings. They must be able to speak to a broad audience, including the public and their colleagues.\n\nComputer Skills\n\nComputer skills may sound like a strange choice for a field that spends quite a bit of time in the dirt, but archaeologists devote much time to researching and writing on the computer. Some archaeologists may also use computer modeling to help reconstruct artifacts or texts they need to reference.\n\nPhysical Fitness\n\nBecause archaeological sites can exist in the far corners of the world and the tools required often involve heavy lifting, archaeologists must be physically fit.\n\nCritical Thinking\n\nWhat do the findings tell archaeologists about the story of human history? What could the hieroglyphics in an ancient tomb mean? Archaeologists make careful observations but must also think critically about why and how ancient peoples interacted with the environment. They must be able to ask deep questions and be resourceful in looking for the answers.\n\nHow Much Do Archaeologists Make?\n\nLike any job, archaeologists’ salaries differ by location and experience. The Bureau of Labor Statistics lumps their work with anthropologists and estimates a median annual salary of $61,910.\n\nWhere Do Archaeologists Work?\n\nArchaeologists perform their jobs in many different places. Some work in the field through hands-on excavation, while others work for historical societies or sites. Many universities, colleges and museums employ them to help train the next generation of archaeology professionals and engender enthusiasm for the career. The National Park Service even uses archaeologists to work in parks and regional offices.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Becoming an Archaeologist\n\nArchaeology may seem like a niche field but exploring human history firsthand can be a rewarding career. Archaeologists can work in many different settings and for various companies or organizations, making studying it more flexible than one might think.\n\nThe first step in discovering a career in archaeology is visiting a park, historic site or museum where archaeologists work. Ask questions about their areas of expertise and show excitement about what they do. Chances are, they will be more than happy to share their experiences.\n\nTop Takeaways\n\nHow To Become an Archaeologist\n\nArchaeologists study culture and explore how past humans interacted with their environment.\n\nArchaeologists attend school for at least six years and fulfill various purposes for museums, parks and organizations.\n\nArchaeology involves multiple skills, including critical thinking and attention to detail.\n\nDifferent types of archaeology focus on unique questions, from airplane crashes to ancient Greek and Roman life."
