        "text": "Archaeology is the study of things that people made, used, and left behind. The goal of archaeology is to understand what people of the past were like and how they lived. Scientists who study archaeology are called archaeologists.\n\nAn archaeologist’s work begins with finding a site to study. Some archaeological sites, such as ancient cities, are visible on the surface. Other sites are buried deep beneath the ground.\n\nAfter finding a site, an archaeologist digs slowly and carefully. This work is called excavation, or a “dig.” Archaeologists use spoons, knives, picks, brushes, and other tools in their work. They try to uncover buildings, tools, weapons, art, and anything else that people made. These items are called artifacts.\n\nThen archaeologists study the objects. They want to know when an artifact was made, what it was made from, and what it was used for. Archaeologists have several methods for figuring out an artifact’s age. One method is called carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 is a chemical found in all organisms, or living things. After an organism dies, the amount of carbon-14 decreases at a certain rate. An archaeologist measures this decrease to find out how long ago the organism died.\n\nArchaeologists also try to understand the culture from which artifacts came. For example, tools such as arrow tips, knives, and grinding stones can tell an archaeologist how people got and prepared their food."
