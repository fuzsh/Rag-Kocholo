        "text": "Here are some of the most common archaeology specializations:\n\nPrehistoric archaeology\n\nAs the name suggests, prehistoric archaeology is the study of human life in the time before historical records began. Because of this, prehistoric archaeologists need to work harder to attempt to fill in the blanks of the historical and cultural significance of past civilizations based on the remnants of their monuments and artefacts. This specialization would suit you if you’re interested in the earliest origins of human beings (at points overlapping with scientific studies of evolution). You may learn how to analyze human or animal bones, as well as exploring what landscapes and environments can tell us about our prehistoric past.\n\nClassical archaeology\n\nStaying in the ancient world, classical archaeology is an ideal specialization for students interested in exploring ancient civilizations such as the Ancient Greeks and Romans. (You may be able to specialize further in one particular civilization.) You’ll increase your understanding of these classical societies by analyzing the art and material culture of the ancient world. This specialization is also available alongside art, ancient history and a range of languages – there may be an opportunity to learn a language such as Latin or Greek.\n\nMedieval archaeology\n\nMore commonly found at master’s level, a specialization in medieval archaeology examines the remnants of societies from the end of the classic period to the beginning of early modern history. It can often be studied alongside medieval history, allowing you to examine evidence from sources in both subjects to make interpretations and arguments. Modules in a medieval archaeology specialization include battlefield archaeology, medieval castles and nautical archaeology, as well as specializations in particular medieval societies.\n\nArchaeology and art history\n\nA specialization in archaeology with art history will interest students who want to further their understanding of the contexts in which the art and material culture of past cultures were created. You’ll focus on studying the themes of art and archeology in particular regions and time periods, drawing on a range of archaeological tools and techniques to build up a contextual understanding and interpretation. This option is likely to involve less fieldwork and more classroom-based learning."
