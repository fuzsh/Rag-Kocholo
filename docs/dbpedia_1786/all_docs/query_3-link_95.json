Graduates of the UC Bachelors in Archaeology program who choose to continue their study in MA or PhD. programs will be well prepared for graduate level work.\n\nThere is a critical need in the U.S. for individuals trained in archaeology to address the demand created by development and infrastructure expansion. In addition to cultural resource management and environmental assessment firms, many local,state and national government agencies employ archaeologists (ex. Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management, US Army Corps of Engineers, National Park Service, the US Forest Service, the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Ohio Department of Transportation, among others.\n\nWebsites that highlight employment opportunities in archaeology worldwide include the following:\n\nAmerican Anthropological Association\n\nAmerican Association of Museums\n\nAmerican Cultural Resources Association\n\nArchaeological Institute of America\n\nThe Archaeology and CRM Professionals Resource\n\nCentral States Anthropological Society\n\neCultural Resources\n\nMidwest Archaeological Conference\n\nSociety for American Archaeology\n\nSociety for Historical Archaeology\n\nThe University of Cincinnati has strong relationship with community partners such as the Cincinnati Musuem Center, the Archaeological Research Institute, and local CRM firms, that offer opportunities to enrich students' training in field methods, public archaeology, curation, and other areas of archaeological practice.\n\nStudents in the UC College of Arts and Sciences (A&S) enjoy many benefits afforded through study at a research-intensive institution ranked among the nation's top 25 public research universities. UC's urban, Tristate location offers exciting opportunities for global education, research and service learning, while its student-centered focus includes an 11:1 student-faculty ratio, a nationally recognized Center for Exploratory Studies and a highly successful First Year Experience program that teaches critical skills for first-year students and provides connections with important campus resources.\n\nThe University of Cincinnati Center for Field Studies (UCCFS) is an off-campus resource located on 17.6 acres of South Shaker Farm in Miami Whitewater Forest, Hamilton County, Ohio. It is connected administratively to the UC College of Arts and Sciences and the Departments of Anthropology, Biological Sciences, Geography, and Geology and the School of Enviornment and Sustainability. Designed to serve the Greater Cincinnati region, the UCCFS provides a base of operations for on-site and regional field research, a protected area for long-term environmental research and a training center for interdisciplinary research and education activities.\n\nAdmission to A&S is generally available for any off-campus student who was admissible directly from high school and has 2.0 GPA cum and a 2.0 in the most recent institution.\n\nStudents who were not admissible directly from high school must have:\n\n24 semester (36 quarter) hours earned\n\nat least a 2.0 GPA cum and a 2.0 at most recent institution\n\nFor more information, Pathways Advising and Student Success\n\nTransfer students should apply using our transfer student online application\n\nAdmission to A&S is generally available for University of Cincinnati students enrolled in other colleges if they were admissible directly from high school, have a cumulative 2.0 GPA and a 2.0 in their most recent UC college.\n\nStudents who were not admissible directly from high school must have:\n\nat least a 2.0 GPA in all college-level courses (both at UC and at other institutions)\n\nsuccessfully completed one semester of English composition or its equivalent\n\nsuccessfully completed one semester of math with a grade of C- or higher that minimally meets on of the following:\n\nMathematical Literacy (MATH 0029)\n\nIntermediate Algebra (MATH 0034)\n\nAlgebra for College (MATH 0039)\n\nStudents may also take the UC Math Placement exam, but must score an MPT of 420 or higher\n\nWhile midyear admission is possible, fall semester is generally the best time to enter the college, since many course sequences begin in that semester.
