        "text": "How do we know about people who lived in ancient times? If people didn’t leave behind any written records, how do we know what gods they worshiped, what food they ate, or what clothes they wore?\n\nOne of the ways we know about people who lived long ago is through archaeology : the study of past life through what’s been left behind.\n\nAn archaeologist might find a pot, a grave, or the remains of a building. Each discovery is like a piece of a puzzle. The archaeologist works to put these pieces together to create a picture of what life was like long ago.\n\nAnthropologists study people and cultures, both in the past and in the present. Archaeology is a special branch of anthropology that focuses on the past.\n\nLike all scientists, archaeologists start with a question they want to explore, such as “Why was this ancient city abandoned?” Then, they gather evidence by digging in the field. Back in the lab, they analyze their evidence. Finally, they share their results with others.\n\nIt’s not easy finding the remains of an ancient culture. As years pass, buildings and artifacts get buried under dirt, rubble, or even other settlements. Archaeologists have to dig underground to find these remains. But finding the right place, or “site,” to dig is the first challenge.\n\nArchaeologists don’t just dig anywhere. They look for a site they think will help answer their questions about the people or time they are studying.\n\nThis takes a lot of planning and research. Before digging begins, archaeologists survey the site, and then create a map of it to help them decide where to dig.\n\nThere are many kinds of evidence that teach us about the past: majestic pyramids, the ruins of an ancient city, pieces of pottery, even a simple trash pit.\n\nEvery piece of evidence has one thing in common—it’s lasted a long time.\n\nMost things from the past, like fabric, wood, and food, decay over time. Things made of clay, metal, and stone survive much longer. What survives also depends on the environment. In a rain forest, a wooden spear would rot and decay. But in a desert, the same spear might be preserved by the dry air.\n\nWhen a site is excavated , it is also destroyed. That’s why it’s so important to keep accurate, detailed records of everything on a site.\n\nWhen archaeologists dig, they create a grid to keep track of where they find things. They also draw pictures and take photographs of everything they find.\n\nAll this information helps archaeologists re-create a picture of the site later. These records will be shared with other scientists interested in that site. They’re also left for future generations of scientists, like you!\n\nWhen archaeologists complete an excavation, work in the lab begins. This is where they analyze their findings by carefully measuring, weighing, drawing, and comparing. They try to answer questions about when it was made and how it was used. They can learn even more by looking at objects found together as a group.\n\nArchaeologists publish what they’ve learned in books and articles. They might support or challenge other theories. Most importantly, they’re bringing new ideas to the debate. And that’s what science is all about!\n\nMany places, like the American Museum of Natural History, collect artifacts from around the world. The artifacts on display at the Museum are only a fraction of these huge collections. Rows of cabinets are filled with thousands of artifacts, like bowls, tools, masks, and textiles.\n\nScientists use the collections like a library. They come to observe objects for their own research.\n\nThese collections give people a chance to see artifacts from faraway places and ancient cultures that disappeared long ago."
