        "text": "Anthropologists and archeologists held about 7,500 jobs in 2021. The largest employers of anthropologists and archeologists were as follows:\n\nResearch and development in the social sciences and humanities 28% Federal government, excluding postal service 22 Management, scientific, and technical consulting services 19 Engineering services 6 Self-employed workers 6\n\nThe work of anthropologists varies according to the specific job. Although most anthropologists work in offices, some analyze samples in laboratories or work in the field.\n\nArcheologists often work for cultural resource management (CRM) firms. These firms identify, assess, and preserve archeological sites and ensure that developers and builders comply with regulations regarding those sites. Archeologists also work in museums, at historical sites, and for government agencies, such as the U.S. Department of the Interior’s National Park Service.\n\nAnthropologists and archeologists often do fieldwork, either in the United States or in foreign countries. Fieldwork may involve learning foreign languages, living in remote areas, and examining and excavating archeological sites. Fieldwork usually requires travel for extended periods—about 4 to 8 weeks per year. Those doing fieldwork often will have to return to the field for several years to complete their research.\n\nDuring fieldwork, anthropologists and archeologists must live with the people they study to learn about their culture. The work can involve rugged living conditions and strenuous physical exertion. While in the field, anthropologists and archeologists often work many hours to meet research deadlines. They also may work with limited funding for their projects.\n\nWork Schedules\n\nMany anthropologists and archeologists work full time during regular business hours. When doing fieldwork, however, anthropologists and archeologists may be required to travel and to work many and irregular hours, including evenings and weekends.\n\nTo enter the occupation, anthropologists and archeologists typically need at least a master’s degree in anthropology or archeology. Experience doing fieldwork in either discipline is also important. Those with a bachelor’s degree may find work as assistants or fieldworkers.\n\nEducation\n\nAnthropologists and archeologists typically qualify for positions with a master’s degree in anthropology or archeology. Master’s degree programs usually take 2 years to complete and include field or laboratory research.\n\nIn graduate programs, anthropology and archeology students typically conduct field research in a local community or working abroad. Students also may attend archeological field schools, which teach them how to excavate historical and archeological sites and how to record and interpret their findings and data.\n\nAlthough a master’s degree is sufficient for many positions, a Ph.D. may be needed for jobs that require leadership skills and advanced knowledge. Anthropologists and archeologists typically need a Ph.D. to work internationally in order to comply with the requirements of foreign governments. A Ph.D. takes additional years of study beyond a master’s degree. Also, Ph.D. students must complete a doctoral dissertation, which typically includes between 18 and 30 months of field research and knowledge of a foreign language.\n\nThose with a bachelor’s degree in anthropology or archeology and experience gained through an internship or field school may work as field or laboratory technicians or research assistants.\n\nOther Experience\n\nGraduates of anthropology and archeology programs usually need experience in their respective fields and training in quantitative and qualitative research methods. Many students gain this experience through field training or internships with museums, historical societies, or nonprofit organizations while still in school.\n\nAnthropologists and archeologists typically have an interest in the Building, Thinking and Creating interest areas, according to the Holland Code framework. The Building interest area indicates a focus on working with tools and machines, and making or fixing practical things. The Thinking interest area indicates a focus on researching, investigating, and increasing the understanding of natural laws. The Creating interest area indicates a focus on being original and imaginative, and working with artistic media.\n\nIf you are not sure whether you have a Building or Thinking or Creating interest which might fit with a career as an anthropologist and archeologist, you can take a career test to measure your interests.\n\nAnthropologists and archeologists should also possess the following specific qualities:\n\nAnalytical skills. Anthropologists and archeologists need knowledge of scientific methods and data, which are often used in their research.\n\nCritical-thinking skills. Anthropologists and archeologists must be able to draw logical conclusions from observations, laboratory experiments, and other methods of research.\n\nInvestigative skills. Anthropologists and archeologists must seek and explore all facts relevant to their research. They must be able to combine pieces of information to try to solve problems and to answer research questions.\n\nWriting skills. Anthropologists and archeologists need strong writing skills because they often write reports detailing their research findings and publish results in scholarly journals and public interest publications.\n\nThe median annual wage for anthropologists and archeologists was $61,910 in May 2021. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $37,870, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $99,830.\n\nIn May 2021, the median annual wages for anthropologists and archeologists in the top industries in which they worked were as follows:\n\nFederal government, excluding postal service $80,910 Engineering services 64,650 Management, scientific, and technical consulting services 60,540 Research and development in the social sciences and humanities 50,230\n\nMany anthropologists and archeologists work full time during regular business hours. When doing fieldwork, however, anthropologists and archeologists may be required to travel and to work many and irregular hours, including evenings and weekends.\n\nEmployment of anthropologists and archeologists is projected to grow 6 percent from 2021 to 2031, about as fast as the average for all occupations.\n\nAbout 800 openings for anthropologists and archeologists are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.\n\nEmployment\n\nCorporations will continue to use anthropological research to gain a better understanding of consumer demand within specific cultures or social groups. Anthropologists also will be needed to analyze markets, allowing businesses to serve their clients better or to target new customers or demographic groups.\n\nArcheologists will be needed to ensure that builders, museums, and other organizations comply with federal regulations pertaining to the preservation and handling of archeological and historical artifacts.\n\nBecause anthropological and archeological research may depend on research funding, federal budgetary decisions can affect the rate of employment growth in research."
