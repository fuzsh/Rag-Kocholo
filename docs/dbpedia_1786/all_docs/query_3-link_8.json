        "text": "What does an archaeologist do? Graduate salaries | Typical employers | Qualifications and training | Key skills\n\nArchaeologists excavate, date and interpret objects found at historical sites. They implement excavation projects, informally known as digs, preserve archaeological remains and collect data that informs their understanding of the past.\n\nTypical duties include:\n\nusing a variety of methods, including surveys and aerial photography, to locate suitable excavation sites\n\nexcavating sites using specialist equipment, and supervising the work of others involved in excavation\n\ncleaning, sorting and cataloguing finds\n\ncarrying out tests on artefacts to understand more about them\n\nusing computer-aided design (CAD), geographical information systems (GIS) and similar software to record and interpret sites and findings\n\nusing specialist software to produce simulations of how sites might have looked in the past\n\nproducing, compiling and maintaining written, photographic and drawn records and electronic databases\n\ndocumenting and preserving artefacts\n\ncollecting, analysing and interpreting data\n\ncarrying out research on artefacts\n\nwriting reports, papers and other articles for publication\n\nmathematical, statistical and computational modelling\n\nassessing planning applications for building developers.\n\nArchaeologists tend to specialise based on their practical expertise and study of particular periods of the past. For example, you could focus on underwater archaeology or management of artefacts. Teaching opportunities are also available, both at universities and local archaeological groups.\n\nDue to the nature of the work, itâs common to work on temporary contracts .The job is likely to involve spending a lot of time outside, potentially in bad weather. Youâre likely to need to work unsociable hours if a dig needs to be completed to a deadline (for example, if a housing developer is working to a schedule). You may also have to travel to sites (which may be difficult to access) and stay away from home.\n\nGraduate salaries\n\nStarting salaries for archaeologists tend to be around Â£18,000, according to Glassdoor, a job comparison site, depending on location and the exact nature of the work. Your salary will rise as you gain experience: average salaries for archaeologists are around Â£22,000 and can increase to Â£28,00.\n\nTypical employers of archaeologists\n\nLocal authorities seeking advice on the archaeological impact of planning applications\n\nNational heritage organisations such as English Heritage, National Trust, Historic Scotland and Cadw (the historic environment service of the Welsh Assembly)\n\nMuseums\n\nProfessional and commercial developers and consultancies\n\nConstruction firms\n\nEducational or research institutions\n\nArchaeological field units or trusts, which could be attached to universities, local authorities or commercial organisations\n\nArchaeological societies and organisations\n\nGovernment agencies such as the Highways Agency.\n\nExcavations, job vacancies and volunteer roles are advertised by the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists (CIfA) and the Council for British Archaeology, and on specialist job sites such as British Archaeological Jobs and Resources. Look for jobs in government agencies on gov.uk and for work at local authorities at jobsgopublic.com.\n\nAlthough archaeological fieldwork usually takes place in teams, it is possible to work as a consultant on a self-employed basis.\n\nQualifications and training required\n\nMost paid employees have an archaeology degree or one in a closely related field such as history. Many careers in archaeology lead to academia, for which outstanding undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications are usually necessary due to the fierce level of competition.\n\nIf you donât have a relevant degree, you can complete a postgraduate qualification. Postgrad courses are also available in laboratory analysis or reconstruction and restoration projects. Previous study in historical subjects will be helpful, while knowledge of modern or historical languages, such as Latin or ancient Greek, may be useful when interpreting finds.\n\nWhatever area of archaeology youâre interested in, archaeological experience is essential. This is often voluntary or you may need to pay a fee to take part to cover accommodation. Look for details on the Council for British Archaeologyâs website.\n\nItâs a good idea to become a member of a professional archaeological body, such as the British Archaeological Association. As well as providing grants and prize funds that could help with work experience and research costs, they also allow access to research centres.\n\nIf youâre a school leaver considering a career in archaeology, aim to gain as much experience as possible by joining the Young Archaeologists Club or a local archaeology society. Also look for archaeology apprenticeships.\n\nKey skills for archaeologists\n\nSuccessful archaeologists will usually have:\n\nmeticulous attention to detail\n\nexcellent written communication skills\n\naccurate recording and reporting skills, including writing, drawing and photography skills\n\nan ability to extract and analyse data\n\npresentation skills\n\nspecialist IT skills (or the ability to learn) such as computer-aided design\n\ngood time management\n\nteamwork skills.\n\nNext: search graduate jobs and internships"
