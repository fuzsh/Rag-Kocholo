        "text": "Archaeology tells us where we have come from and how long we have been around. It is like unravelling the mysteries of the past through dense forest, secluded land, under the hot sun in search of something unknown. It is a dig to find unexpected wonderful things. The thrill of archaeological discovery is unimaginable.\n\nTo put it simply, archaeology is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of artefacts. Artefacts that remained from the past tell us much more than just being visual evidence of existence. Archaeology answers our questions about humans, animals and cultural landscapes. We can’t help but admit that the past blows your mind. It holds all the keys to who we are and where we come from.\n\nWhy study Archaeology?\n\nOne discovery made by archaeologists may change the narratives of history. It is a field where moments of shared discovery are celebrated. Those narratives help us understand a little more about our existence today. Studying the history of the world tells us how we discovered everything we know about the world. As we uncover stories of the past, placing scientific discoveries in the context of historical events is important to understand the big picture painted by archaeologists. We also understand the influence of culture on science.\n\nIf you think archaeological studies are just about digging and finding some remains of the past. Hold on, it does not end there; what follows this is even more important and interesting. The discoveries of the past are thrilling and when on dig site – you are in for a big surprise. Let the past fascinate you and bring you closer to the existence of beings and structures in a way you have never imagined before.\n\nDomains in Archaeology?\n\nArchaeology is an interdisciplinary field. This subject studies human activities through discovered artefacts. Individuals from diverse backgrounds such as history, sociology, chemistry, biology and palaeontology work together to analyse the remains obtained from the dig site and interpret them to bring lost stories to the surface.\n\nAs we move ahead, we will discuss what an archaeologist does and how to become one.\n\nWhat does an archaeologist do?\n\nMany seek, some discover!\n\nIt’s the possibility of finding something that keeps them going. The work of archaeologists is never about one thing or one find. It’s about what it means as a whole. It’s always about setting your find into context for a fuller picture of the past. Sure they find some unexpected things on the dig. While doing so, they are also creating a little bit of history for everybody to use.\n\nA career in this field allows you to become a part of discoveries that shed light on human civilization. Through their research studies on artefacts, building ruins, tools and paintings they explain how human civilisation has evolved.\n\nWhere do archaeologists work?\n\nArchaeology has always been a fascinating subject as it tells us how the world has evolved for hundreds of years. Most of us has this impression of Archeologists working at a dig site. They get the experience of different cultures, different environments and different countries.\n\nHere we describe some of the work settings where one may work as an Archaeologist:\n\nFieldwork at dig site:\n\nArchaeologists participate in the excavation activities. The dig sites may be at different locations as per the national and international projects. Often archaeologists may have to travel; frequently and stay at the dig site till the excavation project completion. These excavation and preservation projects are backed by national and international organisations for preserving, discovering and decoding ancient artefacts and inscriptions.\n\nTeaching at university:\n\nOne can become an archaeology professor at the University post completing the PhD degree. Postgraduate archaeologists can opt for lectureships in universities and colleges. One could be into archaeological research and teach students at the institute when possible.\n\nResearch in the laboratory:\n\nArchaeologists analyse the recovered artefacts and remains from the dig site in a laboratory setting. They study and document their findings to get the relevant information.\n\nGuide at the museum:\n\nAs a guide, one describes artefacts on display, helping visitors see ancient history through their eyes. A guide can also be involved in writing scripts for tours and various other presentations.\n\nOffice:\n\nThe deskwork of an archaeologist consists of assessing the feasibility of an excavation site, checking historical records and making recommendations based on them which help understand whether the site under consideration contains important artefacts. One can work for a private company or government regulatory body.\n\nHow to start preparing for a career in archaeology?\n\nBecoming an archaeologist takes formal education, reading, training, patience and persistence. If you are inclined towards archaeology, you need not wait until you enrol yourself in an archaeology course.\n\nAspiring archaeologists can start right now through their schooling and college years. Now you may be wondering how is that possible? It is possible by studying relevant subjects such as history, anthropology, civics, geography, chemistry, biology and even languages. The knowledge gained by studying these subjects will only help you when you start your journey in the archaeology field.\n\nAlong with education and training, there are some skills one shall try to instill if being an archaeologist is on one’s mind. Here we present some ways to help you gain skills such as attention to detail, teamwork skills, patience and observation skills that will prove to be your asset as an archaeologist. One of the important things is to be excessively curious and keep learning all the time.\n\nBegin archaeology\n\nIntroductory resources talk about what an archaeology career looks like. This section also has resources on the opportunities and challenges in this field. The listed YouTube channels keep you updated about ongoing work from the world of archaeology. If you wish to pursue archaeology as a career, it is advisable to opt for Humanities in Class 11th and 12th. To build a foundation for a career in the archaeology field, knowledge of subjects such as Sociology, History and Anthropology, etc., is required.\n\nRead\n\nOur collection of Books talks about forgotten things, stories from lost cities and introductory lessons of archaeology. Some books may inspire you to learn more and some may give you a head start to enter this field. You can also browse through these Magazines and Periodicals to keep yourself updated about this interdisciplinary field.\n\nConnect\n\nAs an archaeologist, one needs to collaborate with fellow archaeologists.
