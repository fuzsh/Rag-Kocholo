An archaeologist may work on anything from recent decades to ancient civilizations.\n\nArcheologists have been responsible for some of the most significant discoveries in human history, and a career as an archaeologist allows you to be a part of such discoveries.\n\nThis article will explain what an archaeologist does, how much they make, and how to become one.\n\nThis Blog Includes:\n\nWho is an Archaeologist?\n\nWhat does an Archaeologist do?\n\nHow to become an Archaeologist?\n\nTypes of Archaeologists\n\nWhat is it like to work as an archaeologist?\n\nArcheologists Average Salary\n\nWho is an Archaeologist?\n\nThe majority of people's knowledge of archaeology is derived from television episodes such as Indiana Jones. Unfortunately, archaeology is devoid of Indiana Jones-style adventure. Although archaeologists get to visit interesting locales, what they are truly seeking is information rather than wealth.\n\nArchaeology is one of the most important sources for uncovering the history and piecing together the people and civilizations that have shaped us into who we are today. It is one of the four sub-fields of anthropology and involves the scientific study of the human past.\n\nArchaeologists investigate the origins, development, and behaviour of humans and their cultures in the past and now. They study people's cultures, languages, behaviours, archaeological remnants, and physical features from all around the world. They pose inquiries and construct hypotheses.\n\nWhat does an Archaeologist do?\n\nArchaeologists employ scientific sample procedures to determine where they should dig on a site. They observe, document, categorise, and evaluate their findings before sharing them with other scientists and the general public.\n\nArchaeologists investigate the methods of prehistoric communities around the world, using knowledge from the humanities, social, physical, and biological disciplines. They also investigate diverse civilizations' habits, values, and social trends.\n\nThe archaeologist divides history into eight distinct time eras. Many archaeologists have dedicated their life to studying only one type of archaeology:\n\nBefore 4000 BC, there was the Stone Age.\n\nChalcolithic Period: 4000-3150 BC\n\nThe Bronze Age lasted from 3150 to 1200 BC.\n\n1200 - 300 BC (Iron Age)\n\nHellenistic Period: 330–37 BC\n\n37 BC - 324 AD Roman\n\nByzantine: 324 - 636 AD\n\nIslamic: 636 AD – present\n\nMany archaeologists work using sophisticated tools and technologies. Although materials vary by expertise, digging tools, laboratory equipment, statistics and database software, and geographic information systems are frequently used (GIS).\n\nRecommended Read: How to become an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer\n\nTypically, an archaeologist will do the following:\n\nAnalyze data, laboratory samples, and other sources to find patterns in human life, culture, and origins.\n\nCreate data collection methods that are specific to a speciality, project, or culture.\n\nGather data via observations, interviews, and documents.\n\nPlan research initiatives to answer questions and test theories about human behaviour using historical environmental data.\n\nObservations made in the field should be recorded and managed.\n\nReports and presentations on study findings are required.\n\nProvide organisations with advice on the cultural implications of planned plans, policies, and programmes.\n\nHow to become an Archaeologist?\n\nGo through the following points which will help you to become a successful Archaeologist:\n\nEarn an undergraduate degree\n\nNearly all archaeological jobs need a bachelor's degree in anthropology, history, or linguistics. Learn how to analyse historical relics and how to excavate them throughout your education properly. This education shows that you can be trusted to participate in an archaeological project, where mistakes could lead to the loss of historical knowledge and artefacts.\n\nParticipate in a dig\n\nArchaeology theory doesn't ensure you'll appreciate the physical part of the profession. Students should engage in an open excavation through an internship, fellowship, or similar arrangement. This gives you supervised experience and lets you examine your fit for the profession to make sure it's the best decision.\n\nEarn an advanced degree\n\nMost archaeologists prefer to get a master's or PhD before entering the profession. Professional performance improves with advanced degrees because they give a deeper grasp of the area, improving professional performance. Higher degrees are typically necessary for further career progression, making them a soft requirement.\n\nJoin archaeological groups.\n\nArchaeology is a competitive field, so any advantage you have is helpful. Joining a national or international organisation shows a prospective employer your devotion and worth.\n\nCreate a resume\n\nA formal CV shows hiring managers your finest qualities. Your CV may be the only item seen for competitive employment before the first cut. Focus on archaeology-related tasks when listing previous jobs. Teaching assistant experience is more valuable for an archaeology professor's application than digging experience.\n\nTypes of Archaeologists:\n\nLandscape archaeologists scour the landscape for signs of ancient sites.\n\nArchaeological surveyors plan and document earthworks, structures, and excavated sites.\n\nField technicians — perform the difficult labour of excavation and relic extraction.\n\nArchaeological photographers - Photograph the site before, during, and after excavation, as well as individual artefacts.\n\nArchaeological conservators are responsible for preserving artefacts for future generations.\n\nFinds experts - dates, analyses, identifies and interprets objects.\n\nArchaeological illustrators finish item drawings, work on publication plans, and design and typeset archaeological books and publications.\n\nEnvironmental scientists investigate and reconstruct the connections between previous societies and the surroundings in which they lived. They try to determine these societies' diets, health, and living conditions.\n\nHuman Bones experts- Experts in identifying and interpreting human skeletal remains\n\nFind curators - plan long-term storage and care for artefacts\n\nRecommended Read: Air Traffic Controllers and 8 secrets you did not know about them\n\nWhat is it like to work as an archaeologist?\n\nAlthough some archaeologists work in offices, the majority work in laboratories or the field. Fieldwork sometimes necessitates travel. During regular business hours, the majority work full-time.\n\nArchaeologists collaborate at various levels with research organisations, colleges and universities, museums, consulting businesses, private corporations, and government agencies. They can also work for companies that specialise in cultural resource management (CRM). Archaeologists frequently conduct fieldwork, either in their own country or in other countries. This could include studying foreign languages, living in rural areas, or inspecting and excavating archaeological sites. This occupation frequently necessitates long periods of travel and may need labour in distant regions. Archaeologists may work in difficult conditions and require hard physical exertion.\n\nArcheologists Average Salary\n\nArchaeologists usually work full-time jobs. In the United States, an archaeologist makes an average of $64,982 per year.\n\nArcheologists can make anywhere from $21,000 to $132,000 per year, depending on where they work, what kind of work they do, and how much experience they have.\n\nIf you have a knack for History and everything dainty, archaeology might be exactly what you enjoy.
