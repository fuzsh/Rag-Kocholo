        "text": "Annissa’s research specializes in Egyptology, Nubian archaeology, and Museum Studies. Her doctoral thesis investigates the ceramic production and trade industry during Meroitic Nubia and its potential far-reaching networks linking the Nile Valley to Iron Age West African cultures. She also investigates and highlights provenance for object-based research in museum collections. She has worked with collections at the Royal Ontario Museum in the Department of Arts and Culture: Global Africa and in Ancient Egypt and Nubia, the Arts of Africa collection at the Brooklyn Museum, as well as with the Bioarchaeology of Nubia Expedition at Arizona State University and the International El-Kurru Archaeological Project. Annissa's academic and curatorial work has been supported by the Ontario Graduate Scholarship, the Association of Art Museum Curators, the Council for Museum Anthropology, the American Alliance of Museums, and the American Society of Overseas Research.\n\nEducation\n\nMMSt, Master of Museum Studies, Faculty of Information, University of Toronto\n\nB.A., Near and Middle Eastern Civilizations, Anthropology, History (Caribbean), University of Toronto\n\nCurrent Supervisor(s)\n\nMary-Ann Pouls Wegner\n\nDissertation Title\n\nThrough the Sahara, Across the Red Sea: Trade Networks of Meroitic Fineware and their Impact on Modern Museum Collections\n\nPublications\n\n\"Exhibiting Africa: State of the Field in African Art and the Diaspora: Symposium Proceedings”.
