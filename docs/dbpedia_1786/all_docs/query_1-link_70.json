        "text": "“Growing political polarization is a problem that keeps me up at night,” writes Jessica Grose in The New York Times. But in the work of CBI’s Ona Ferguson and David Fairman with the Convergence Collaborative on Supports for Working Families, Grose finds some better possibilities.\n\nGrose’s conclusion: “We don’t know what unexpected alliances and priorities might arise in national politics in the coming years. But because these professionals have spent a lot of hours together talking about their deepest values, giving and getting clarity about their beliefs, they may find unexpected sources of support for specific ideas that aren’t yet mainstream.”"
