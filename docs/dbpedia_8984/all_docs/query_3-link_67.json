        "text": "Many people believe William Shakespeare is the best British writer of all time.\n\nThe world famous writer's First Folio, containing 36 of his plays, turns 400 years old on 8 November.\n\nThe folio was published shortly after he died.\n\nWhy is the first folio so important?\n\nThe First Folio is the closest thing to the plays as Shakespeare wrote them. The writer's original handwritten works were lost long ago.\n\nPutting his works into print meant they were preserved. Without the First Folio, 18 plays, including Macbeth, Twelfth Night and The Tempest might have been lost forever.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, England in 1564.\n\nNobody is exactly sure which day he was born, but we do know he was baptised on 26 April that year.\n\nIn 1582 he married Anne Hathaway and the couple went on to have three children.\n\nShakespeare lived in London for 25 years and wrote most of his plays there.\n\nHe died at his home in Stratford-upon-Avon on 23 April 1616, aged 52.\n\nShakespeare wrote 37 plays (though some experts think it may have been more). He wrote three different types of plays:\n\nHistories - about the lives of kings and famous figures from history\n\nComedies - which end with a marriage\n\nTragedies - which end with the death of the main character\n\nShakespeare also wrote plenty of poetry and in 1609 published a book of 154 sonnets.\n\nWe know his work was popular at the time because he earned enough money to live in a smart area of London, where he wrote some of his most famous plays."
