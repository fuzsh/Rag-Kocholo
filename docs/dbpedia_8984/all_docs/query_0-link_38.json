He continued to write prolifically during the late 1590s and early 1600s. In 1606 Shakespeare wrote King Lear and Macbeth, which were both influenced by contemporary politics. By 1609, about half of Shakespeare’s plays had been printed. Shakespeare continued to write plays until 1613, three years before his death.\n\nShakespeare is known for his exploration of human nature. As Samuel Johnson states in his famous “Preface to the Works of Shakespeare”, \"His persons act and speak by the influence of those general passions and principles by which all minds are agitated, and the whole system of life is continued in motion. . . .Shakespeare has no heroes; his scenes are occupied only by men, who act and speak as the reader thinks that he himself should have spoken and acted on the same occasion.\"[4]\n\nThe Works of Shakespeare: In Eight Volumes was published in 1740 during a time when Shakespeare was enormously popular in England. In addition to his plays, it includes multiple elegies written about Shakespeare, his will, and biographical documents that provide a background of his life.\n\nEvidence for Inclusion in Wythe's Library\n\nListed in the Jefferson Inventory of Wythe's Library as \"Shakespeare by Theobald. the first 6.v. 12mo.\" and given by Thomas Jefferson to his granddaughters, Ann and Ellen Randolph. The precise edition of the incomplete set inherited by Jefferson is unknown. George Wythe's Library[5] on LibraryThing indicates as much, adding \"Duodecimo editions were published in seven volumes at Dublin in 1739; in eight volumes at London in 1740, 1752, 1757, 1762, 1767, and 1773; and in twelve volumes at London in 1772.\" The Brown Bibliography[6] lists the first edition, seven volume set published in London in 1733. The Wolf Law Library found a copy of the London second edition (1740) eight volume set and purchased it for the George Wythe Collection.\n\nDescription of the Wolf Law Library's copy\n\nEight volumes bound in contemporary full calf with raised bands, red title labels and gilt decoration to spines. Purchased from Wadard Books.\n\nImages of the library's copy of this book are available on Flickr.
