        "text": "Today we watch stories through TV, computers or on phones. But 450 years ago, people could only watch stories acted in front of them on the streets or in theatres.\n\nPeople loved watching plays. They were as popular then as TV shows are now and some of the actors became just as famous.\n\nOne of these actors was William Shakespeare.\n\nHe's still famous today. Not for acting but because he was, and still is, one of the best known writers in the English language.\n\nShakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. He went to school there and learned Latin and Greek. He got married at 18 and had children.\n\nShakespeare moved to London, and became a rather famous actor there.\n\nHe also wrote plays which everyone, rich and poor, even royalty, paid to watch.\n\nSoon Shakespeare was rich enough to help build a new theatre, called âThe Globeâ.\n\nShakespeare wrote many different types of plays. Sad tragedies like Romeo and Juliet, funny comedies like A Midsummer Night's Dream and important histories about kings like Henry V.\n\nThey were fun, scary, exciting and serious!\n\nHe also wrote poetry and invented new words like 'eyeball' and 'bedroom'. He truly changed the way we speak English!\n\nWilliam Shakespeare lived over 450 years ago, but his name, plays and poetry are still known all over the world today.\n\nStudents learn about him at school and at university. People come from many countries to see where he lived and his plays are just as popular now as when they were first performed all those years ago!"
