In many cases, he turned nouns into verbs (like gossip, elbow and friend) he added the \"un-\" prefix (unaware, undress, unreal), he put words together (bedroom, lackluster) or created funny descriptors \"green-eyed\" (jealousy) and \"wild-goose chase\" (a hopeless quest).⁣\n\n⁣He also \"invented\" a few female names along the way. These six names mostly owe their use to the Brilliant Bard.⁣\n\n⁣𝗢𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗮 \"𝗣𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗲\" - from 𝘛𝘸𝘦𝘭𝘧𝘵𝘩 𝘕𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵 - the lovely young Illyrian Countess whose wealth and beauty attract the pursuit of many would-be suitors; historians believe Shakespeare wanted an exotic-sounding name for his Illyrian noblewoman, and drew upon the Greek ελαία (“elaia”) “olive tree”, itself a universal symbol of peace.⁣\n\n⁣𝗠𝗶𝗿𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗮 \"𝗟𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗹𝘆 & 𝗔𝗱𝗺𝗶𝗿𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲\" - appropriately named, the ever-lovely and admirable character of Miranda is the beautiful fifteen year old daughter of Prospero in 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘛𝘦𝘮𝘱𝘦𝘴𝘵.⁣\n\n⁣𝗜𝗺𝗼𝗴𝗲𝗻 \"𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻, 𝗚𝗶𝗿𝗹, 𝗗𝗮𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗲𝗿\" - the lovely heroine of Shakespeare's play 𝘊𝘺𝘮𝘣𝘦𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦 whose name comes from the ancient Irish-Gaelic inghean “maiden, daughter, girl” (Imogen is the daughter of Cymbeline, Celtic King of the Britons, and the embodiment of all that can be admired in a woman).⁣\n\n⁣𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮 \"𝗔𝗹𝗹-𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘁\" - from 𝘒𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘓𝘦𝘢𝘳, Cordelia is the daughter who proves faithful to her father in the end and is thus regarded as the one pure of “heart” (from Latin 𝘤𝘰𝘳𝘥𝘪𝘴). ⁣\n\n⁣𝗩𝗶𝗼𝗹𝗮 - the heroine of 𝘛𝘸𝘦𝘭𝘧𝘵𝘩 𝘕𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵, Viola is the flower that most symbolizes \"𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘆 & 𝗳𝗮𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀.\"⁣"
