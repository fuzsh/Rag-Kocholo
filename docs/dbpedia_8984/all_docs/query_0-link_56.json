        "text": "What did one of history’s great authors, William Shakespeare, mean when he penned the following sentence?\n\n“There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” – William Shakespeare\n\nThe line occurs in his play, Hamlet, during an exchange between the characters Hamlet, Guildenstern, and Rosencrantz. At the time of the quote Hamlet has called the country of Denmark a prison and the three are in a disagreement over whether or not Denmark really is a prison. Hamlet believes it is, while the other two disagree.\n\nWhat does it mean for there to be nothing good nor bad, but for things to be made good or bad by the thinking mind?\n\nFor millennia, philosophers have repeated this same wisdom in different words, with the hopes of empowering us with wisdom that can help us to live more peaceful, happier, and fulfilled lives.\n\nThe quote, “ignorance is bliss,” by Publilius Syrus is also apt as a synonymous quote to Shakespeare’s.\n\nThe modern-day philosopher, Eckhart Tolle also shares an anecdote that illustrates how what we think of as good or bad cannot really be labeled as such.\n\nOne day a wise man won an expensive car as a result of a lottery.\n\nHis family and friends were very happy for him and wanted to celebrate the good happening. “You’re so lucky!”’ they cheered.\n\nThe man simply smiled and said ‘Maybe.’\n\nFor a little while, he enjoyed driving the car. Then one day a drunken driver crashed into his car and he ended up in the hospital. His family and friends came to see him and lamented, ‘That was really unfortunate.’\n\nThe man simply smiled and said, ‘Maybe.’\n\nOne night while he was still in the hospital, there was a landslide and his house on the hill suddenly crashed into the sea. Again his friends and family came and exclaimed, ‘Weren’t you lucky to have been here in hospital?’\n\nOnce more, the man simply smiled and said, ‘Maybe.’\n\nThe reality that William Shakespeare, Publilius Syrus, Eckhart Tolle, and countless other philosophers point to is that we really don’t have the knowledge to say that certain events really are good or bad, and moreover that labeling things as good or bad and getting worked up about the “goodness” or “badness” really isn’t conducive to living more peaceful, happier, and fulfilled lives.\n\nHuman society invented such labels with helpful intentions. Establishing a common understanding of what is helpful and not helpful to human society helped establish laws, norms, values and mores that were aimed at reducing the occurrences of what we commonly label as good and bad.\n\nThat said, labeling events cannot control the world and make only good things happen or prevent bad things. However helpful in some cases, there will be others where the act of labeling in others will create life-limiting, obsessive behaviors in others. How does labeling limit our ability to live more peaceful, happier, and fulfilled lives?\n\nThis is because the act of subjective labeling events carries with it a risk: once we label something as good or bad, it’s hard to focus only on the objective learning from the experience. Rather, we tend to just think about the goodness or badness of the event.\n\nIf someone on the street bumps into you and calls you a name before hurrying on, are you more likely to think about walking more carefully in the future, or do you spend the rest of the day simply being upset about that encounter?\n\nIf you fail a test, what’s the likelihood that you will acknowledge your failure and take it in stride by making a plan to better prepare before the next test and then go out to dinner with friends, having applied the lesson? How many hours will you spend beating yourself up and lamenting the fact that you failed? Does that change the fact that you failed or help motivate you to do better next time?\n\nIf you get into a fight with your significant other, how prone to keeping the fight going in your mind are you? Does it make you more or less likely to tell your partner you’re sorry or forgive them and talk through why the fight happened to understand the other better? Isn’t it more interesting for your mind to make the other person - or yourself - a bad person, and to play a movie reel in your mind about the fight and cast a hue of badness over everything they do for the next week?\n\nThe perceived goodness/badness of the event is like the dessert of the event: very tasty and not healthy for our growth. The learning or takeaway is like the vegetable of the event: not the tasty part, but healthy for our growth.\n\nFor the human mind and the ego, subjective labels are quite fun to play with and very sticky. Our minds much prefer to eat the dessert and ignore the vegetables; our egos love to obsess about good or bad things that happened in the past, or imagine good or bad things that may happen to us in the future. Unless we eat the vegetables and focus on what the event taught us, we are unlikely to engage in mental behavior that can actually help us to create more peace, happiness, and fulfillment.\n\nJust how many hours and calories of energy that could be spent exploring new directions in life end up being spent thinking about the good and bad things that happened in the past or might happen in the future?\n\nRather than admit mistakes, create space for stress and pain to be released, or change our behavior we prefer to complain, rehash why we don’t need to change, and endlessly replay events in our mind’s eye. Our egos prefer to create innumerable obsessive thoughts and emotions that keep us mired in the past or anxious about the future, and distract us from focusing on what we can do in the present to actually make our lives better.\n\nWe cannot prevent or guarantee good or bad events from happening, but we can decide whether or not to label events good or bad, and furthermore whether or not we can let those events go and keep living here and now. We can learn to redirect energy away from obsessive, entangling thoughts and towards enlightening, productive thoughts.\n\nThat’s not to say that we should become cold and emotionless. When we experience loss or pain, it’s normal to experience a negative reaction and to wish that loss or pain didn’t happen. The key is to let those negative reactions go before they become entrenched and obsessive, and to not come up with new ones. Obsessing will block us from seeing the goodness that can come after what we perceive as bad events, and in extreme cases can blind us to all the good that still exists in our lives, making us feel miserable because we have been harmed by a bad event that we believe never should have happened to us."
