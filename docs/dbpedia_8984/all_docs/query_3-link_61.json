        "text": "Top 10 facts\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in April 1564.\n\nShakespeare’s wife’s name was Anne Hathaway.\n\nShakespeare had three children: Susanna, Hamnet and Judith.\n\nShakespeare worked as actor with the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, later called the King’s Men.\n\nShakespeare wrote 154 sonnets and around 40 plays.\n\nOne of Shakespeare’s first plays was Henry V.\n\nShakespeare’s plays were performed for both Queen Elizabeth I and King James I – James I was the patron of Shakespeare’s theatre group.\n\nShakespeare’s theatre group performed in the Globe Theatre and the Blackfriars Theatre.\n\nSome phrases that Shakespeare wrote in his plays are things we still say today.\n\nTimeline\n\nDid you know?\n\nWe don’t know the date that William Shakespeare was born – we just know the date that he was baptised.\n\nShakespeare had three children named Susanna, Hamnet and Judith. Hamnet and Judith were twins.\n\nBefore Shakespeare wrote plays, he worked as an actor with the Lord Chamberlain’s Men.\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain’s Men changed its name to the King’s Men in 1603, which is when James I was crowned king and became the group’s patron.\n\nShakespeare wrote both poems and plays – he started out by writing poems first.\n\nMost of the poems Shakespeare wrote are called sonnets. He wrote 154 sonnets!\n\nShakespeare is sometimes called ‘The Bard of Avon’ – a bard is another word for a poet.\n\nShakespeare wrote almost 40 plays; someone who writes plays is also called a playwright.\n\nNot a lot of people could read and write in Shakespeare’s time, so the Globe Theatre hung different coloured flags to let people know when a play was going to be performed, and what kind of play it was going to be (if it was sad or funny).\n\nThe Globe Theatre was shaped like an octagon – it had eight sides.\n\nWomen didn’t act in Shakespeare’s time, so boys would have to play the roles of women. That means that Juliet in Romeo and Juliet would have been played by a boy!\n\nLook through the gallery and see if you can spot all the following:\n\nWilliam Shakespeare\n\nAnne Hathaway's Cottage\n\nA statue of Shakespeare\n\nMary Arden was Shakespeare's mother; visitors can still see her childhood home today\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s birthplace\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s grave (Photo Credit: Elliott Brown)\n\nA drawing of what Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre would have looked like\n\nA replica (copy) of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre, which was built in London in 1997\n\nThe stage in the Globe\n\nThe Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford\n\nGallery\n\nAbout\n\nEven though they lived in Stratford-upon-Avon, William Shakespeare and Anne Hathaway were married in a village called Temple Grafton. At some point between 1585 and 1592, Shakespeare moved to London. His wife and children were still in Stratford-upon-Avon, and Shakespeare didn’t move back there until 1611.\n\nShakespeare mostly wrote plays and sonnets, which are a kind of poem. Sonnets have 14 lines with 10 syllables in each line.\n\nShakespeare’s theatre group, The King’s Men, worked in two theatres, the Globe and the Blackfriars. The Globe Theatre didn’t have a roof on it, but the Blackfriars Theatre did so it could be used when the weather got cold. Seeing a play at the Globe Theatre was comfortable if you could pay for a seat with a cushion, but if you paid just one penny you could stand in the middle.\n\nActors in Shakespeare’s time had a bad reputation – people thought they weren’t very nice people, and couldn’t be trusted. So, groups of actors – called troupes – tried to get someone rich to sponsor them. This sponsor would give them money and things that they needed. Shakespeare’s theatre group would have had to show people a piece of paper with their sponsor’s name written on it if they wanted to be welcomed somewhere.\n\nShakespeare was part of The Friday Club, a group for actors, poets, authors and playwrights (like Shakespeare). The explorer Sir Walter Raleigh began the group in 1603, and they all met in the Mermaid Tavern, so they sometimes called themselves the Mermaid Club.\n\nShakespeare wrote three different kinds of plays – comedies (funny plays), tragedies (sad plays) and histories (plays about a real person). A different colour flag would be flown from the top of the theatre so people would know which play was about to be performed – white meant a comedy would be performed, red a history, and black or dark colours meant a tragedy.\n\nShakespeare’s comedy plays are: All's Well That Ends Well, As You Like It, The Comedy of Errors, Cymbeline, Love's Labour's Lost, Measure for Measure, The Merchant of Venice, The Merry Wives of Windsor, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Pericles, Prince of Tyre, Taming of the Shrew, The Tempest, Troilus and Cressida, Twelfth Night, Two Gentlemen of Verona and A Winter's Tale.\n\nShakespeare’s tragedy plays are: Antony and Cleopatra, Coriolanus, Hamlet, Julius Caesar, King Lear, Macbeth, Othello, Romeo and Juliet, Timon of Athens and Titus Andronicus.\n\nShakespeare’s history plays are: King Henry IV Part 1, King Henry IV Part 2, King Henry V, King Henry VI Part 1, King Henry VI Part 2, King Henry VI Part 3, King Henry VIII, King John, Richard II and Richard III.\n\nShakespeare wrote his sonnets and plays around 400 years ago, but some of the phrases he wrote have become a part of our everyday language. For instance, you might have heard someone in trouble say that they’re ‘in a pickle’, or heard being jealous described as ‘the green-eyed monster’.\n\nFamous friends:\n\nSir Walter Raleigh (c.1552 – 1618) – Sir Walter Raleigh visited America and helped start colonies there, and some people think that he was the first one to bring tobacco and potatoes into England. He also founded the Friday Club in 1603, which was a group for poets and playwrights that Shakespeare belonged to.\n\nBen Johnson (1572-1637) – Ben Johnson wrote plays and poems around the same time that Shakespeare did. Both he and Shakespeare belonged to the Friday Club that Sir Walter Raleigh began. Ben wrote a poem in the introduction of Shakespeare’s First Folio, which is the collection of works that was published a few years after Shakespeare died.\n\nHenry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton (1573-1624) – Henry Wriothesley was a wealthy man, and the patron of William Shakespeare. He loved the theatre and plays.\n\nRichard Burbage (1568-1619) – Richard Burbage was a famous actor, and part of William Shakespeare’s theatre group. He often played the lead role in Shakespeare’s plays.\n\nChristopher Marlowe (1564-1593) – Christopher Marlowe was born the same year as Shakespeare, and also famous for writing plays. Shakespeare didn’t start writing plays and having them performed until after Christopher Marlowe died.\n\nRelated Videos\n\nJust for fun...\n\nFind Shakespeare wordsearches, comic strips, puppet-making, worksheets and more on the Shakespeare Week website\n\nWatch Horrible Histories Shakespeare songs: List of Plays 'wot I've Written and Shakespeare and the Quills Song\n\nGo Totally Shakespeare with CBBC!
