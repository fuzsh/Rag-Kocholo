        "text": "William Shakespeare is widely considered the greatest dramatist of all time as well as the most influential writer in the history of the English language. He originated hundreds of words and phrases that English speakers use to this day. His impact on literature is so massive that one could make an argument that every one of his works deserves a spot on this list, but these seven plays and one poetry collection are undoubtedly among his most important achievements.\n\nRomeo and Juliet (c. 1594–96)\n\nAlthough not usually considered among his greatest plays, Romeo and Juliet remains one of Shakespeare’s most popular works. This tale of two star-crossed lovers who both meet tragic ends has been adapted countless times for the stage and screen. The universality of the story of young people in love trying to be together in an uncaring world has resonated with audiences and readers from across the globe for centuries.\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing (c. 1598–99)\n\nWhile Shakespeare’s best-known plays are his tragedies, he also wrote a number of comedies, including this tale of a woman falsely accused of being unfaithful. The plotline—centered on the couple Claudio and Hero—involves humorous misunderstandings and bumbling supporting characters. Much Ado About Nothing is also notable for its secondary plot, in which Hero’s cousin Beatrice and her potential romantic interest, Benedick, trade witty insults and express skepticism about love throughout the play. Their “merry war” ends with the two on equal footing, admitting their love for one another.\n\nJulius Caesar (c. 1599–1600)\n\nThe majority of Shakespeare’s history plays concern events that occurred in his native England, but he did occasionally explore historical eras in other parts of the world. The most notable example of this is Julius Caesar. In Shakespeare’s drama Caesar, the leader of Rome, is conspired against and eventually assassinated by his former republican allies, including his trusted friend Brutus. The play is famous for Mark Antony’s speech that begins “Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.” The speech is one of the best-known of Shakespeare’s monologues.\n\nHamlet (c. 1599–1601)\n\nHamlet is arguably the greatest drama ever written. In it Hamlet, the prince of Denmark, struggles with the recent death of his father and with his mother having married Claudius, his father’s brother and successor. Claudius is later revealed to have murdered Hamlet’s father. A visit from his father’s ghost spurs Hamlet to seek revenge. One of the most notable aspects of the play are Hamlet’s soliloquies, which beautifully express the character’s inner turmoil.\n\nKing Lear (1605–06)\n\nThe play opens with King Lear deciding to divide his kingdom among his three daughters in proportion to their love for him. He disinherits Cordelia, the daughter who actually loves him but refuses to falsely flatter him. His other two daughters, the deceitful Goneril and Regan, take over his kingdom. They then turn on Lear and cast him out. Lear descends into madness but is eventually reconciled with Cordelia, who is later hanged before Lear himself dies. King Lear is one of Shakespeare’s most pessimistic works. Hope, however, can be found in the character of Cordelia, who displays an enduring moral strength in the face of injustice.\n\nMacbeth (c. 1606–07)\n\nAlong with Hamlet and King Lear, Macbeth is the third of Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies. It is the story of a Scottish nobleman who, following the prophecy of three witches, becomes the ruler of his country after killing Duncan, the reigning king. Macbeth continues to kill potential political rivals. The guilt drives his wife, Lady Macbeth, mad. Ultimately, Macbeth is killed as a consequence of his political ambitions. The tragic rendering of Macbeth’s downward spiral and the iconic depiction of Lady Macbeth’s descent into madness make this one of Shakespeare’s major works.\n\nSonnets (1609)\n\nWritten in the 1590s when Shakespeare’s theatrical career was paused during an outbreak of plague, the sonnet cycle was finally published in 1609. The possibly autobiographical sonnets are divided into two sections. The first and much larger group of sonnets address an unnamed “Fair Youth,” a male friend of the poet’s. The second set focuses on a “Dark Lady.” As a narrative, the sonnet sequence tells of strong attachment, of jealousy, of grief at separation, and of joy at being together and sharing beautiful experiences. The Dark Lady sonnets end the sequence on a disturbing note of sorrow and self-loathing.\n\nThe Tempest (1611)\n\nThe plot of The Tempest centers on Prospero, a magician and former duke of Milan, and his daughter, Miranda. The pair are stranded on a deserted island after Prospero was usurped from his dukedom by his brother, Antonio. Prospero uses his magic to create a storm that strands a group of people, including Antonio, on the island. Among that group is also Ferdinand, who falls in love with Miranda and helps precipitate the actions that lead to reconciliation among the main characters. Although not Shakespeare’s final play, The Tempest seems like his farewell to the theater. It contains moving passages of reflection on what his powers as artist have been able to accomplish."
