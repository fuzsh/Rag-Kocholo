        "text": "EN 333: Shakespeare - From Stage to Page\n\nFulfillments: Upper level English Major requirements\n\nFour hundred and eight years after his death, William Shakespeare remains by far the world’s most produced playwright, and it is estimated that the play Hamlet alone is being staged somewhere in the world every moment of every day. Similarly, no word on IMDB.com returns as many hits as “Shakespeare,” as there are dozens of films based on his work. Therefore, this summer we will study Shakespeare and performance by learning about the process that takes the written word to the stage and then back again to the page. In other words, students in this course will read Shakespeare and study productions of Shakespeare at the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford, the Globe Theatre in London, and perhaps others within the context of archaeology, theatre history, performance, and literature. Further, students will have the opportunity of visiting the Shakespeare Birthplace, where he was born, as well as the Holy Trinity Church in Stratford, where he is buried, during our visit to the RSC in Stratford.\n\nAssistant Prof: Tyler Sasser (University of Alabama)"
