        "text": "4. William Shakespeare the Globe-sharer was also William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon.\n\n4a. William Shakespeare, the Stratford-born actor, was entitled to append \"gentleman\" after his name by right of being granted a coat of arms (see 3a above).\n\n4b. In a mortgage deed of trust dated 7 October 1601 by Nicholas Brend to John Bodley, John Collet, and Matthew Browne, in which Bodley was given control of the Globe playhouse, the Globe is described as being tenanted by \"Richard Burbadge and Willm Shackspeare gent.\"\n\n4c. In a deed of trust dated 10 October 1601 by Nicholas Brend to John Bodley, legally tightening up the control of Bodley of the Globe, again the theater is described as being tenanted by \"Richard Burbage and William Shakspeare gentlemen.\"\n\n4d. In a deed of sale of John Collet's interest to John Bodley in 1608, the Globe is once more described as being tenanted by \"Richard Burbadge and Willm Shakespeare, gent.\"\n\n(Notice the variation in spelling of Shakespeare's surname between the three documents, all originating in London. For some reason variants of the name seem to be a major point in the minds of some Oxfordians, but such differences are no more significant than similar variants of Richard Burbage's name in the same documents. See The Spelling and Pronunciation of Shakespeare's Name.)\n\nSo now we've established that William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon was an actor in the company that performed the plays of William Shakespeare, and was also a sharer in the theater in which the plays were presented. To anyone with a logical mind, it follows that this William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon was also the writer of the plays and poems that bear his name. He is the man with the right name, at the right time, and at the right place.\n\nNow, it is true that there exists no play or poem attributed to \"William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon.\" The name on the works is \"William Shakespeare.\" There also exists no comparable attribution for virtually any of Shakespeare's contemporaries, the only exceptions being some cases where some ambiguity might exist, such as \"John Davies of Hereford\" and \"William Drummond of Hawthornden.\" But his contemporaries knew who he was, and there was never any doubt in the minds of those who knew him. Following is the most important evidence of this.\n\n5. William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon, the actor and Globe-sharer, was the playwright and poet William Shakespeare.\n\n5a. Around 1601, students in Cambridge put on a play called The Second Part of the Return from Parnassus, the third in a series of plays that satirized the London literary scene. In this play, two characters named \"Kempe\" and \"Burbage\" appear, representing the actors Will Kempe and Richard Burbage of the Chamberlain's Men. At one point Kempe says,\n\nFew of the university [men] pen plays well, they smell too much of that writer Ovid, and that writer Metamorphosis, and talk too much of Proserpina and Jupiter. Why, here's our fellow Shakespeare puts them all down, aye and Ben Jonson too. O that Ben Jonson is a pestilent fellow, he brought up Horace giving the poets a pill, but our fellow Shakespeare hath given him a purge that made him bewray his credit.\n\nThis passage establishes that the playwright Shakespeare was a fellow actor of Kempe and Burbage, contrasts him with the University-educated playwrights, and establishes him as a rival of Ben Jonson.\n\n5b. In 1610, John Davies of Hereford published a volume entitled The Scourge of Folly, consisting mostly of poems to famous people and Davies's friends. One of these poems was addressed to Shakespeare:\n\nTo our English Terence, Mr. Will. Shake-speare.\n\nSome say (good Will) which I, in sport, do sing,\n\nHad'st thou not plaid some Kingly parts in sport,\n\nThou hadst bin a companion for a King;\n\nAnd, beene a King among the meaner sort.\n\nSome others raile; but, raile as they thinke fit,\n\nThou hast no railing, but a raigning Wit:\n\nAnd honesty thou sow'st, which they do reape;\n\nSo, to increase their Stocke which they do keepe.\n\nTerence was an ancient Roman playwright who came from humble origins, just like Shakespeare. Davies's references to \"playing\" parts \"in sport\" refer to acting, and his repeated references to \"kings\" is a play on the name of the King's Men; the only other poems in the volume that similarly play on \"king\" are those to Robert Armin and William Ostler, also members of the King's Men, and the poem to Armin also refers to playing \"in sport.\" Incidentally, this poem is demonstrably not addressed to the Earl of Oxford in any kind of disguise, since it is addressed in the present tense to a living person, and Oxford had been dead for six years. (See Why I'm Not an Oxfordian for details.)\n\n5c. In 1615 Edmund Howes published a list of \"Our moderne, and present excellent Poets\" in John Stow's Annales. He lists the poets \"according to their priorities (social rank) as neere I could,\" with Knights listed first, followed by gentlemen. In the middle of the 27 listed, number 13 is \"M. Willi. Shakespeare gentleman.\"\n\n5d. Some time between 1616 and 1623, William Basse wrote an elegy entitled \"On Mr. Wm. Shakespeare,\" in which he suggests that Shakespeare should have been buried in Westminster Abbey next to Chaucer, Beaumont, and Spenser:\n\nRenowned Spenser, lie a thought more nigh\n\nTo learned Chaucer, and rare Beaumont lie\n\nA little nearer Spenser to make room\n\nFor Shakespeare in your threefold, fourfold tomb.\n\nTo lodge all four in one bed make a shift\n\nUntil Doomsday, for hardly will a fifth\n\nBetwixt this day and that by fate be slain\n\nFor whom your curtains may be drawn again.\n\nIf your precedency in death doth bar\n\nA fourth place in your sacred sepulcher,\n\nUnder this carved marble of thine own\n\nSleep rare tragedian Shakespeare, sleep alone,\n\nThy unmolested peace, unshared cave,\n\nPossess as lord not tenant of thy grave,\n\nThat unto us and others it may be\n\nHonor hereafter to be laid by thee.\n\nThis poem circulated very widely in manuscript, and it survives today in more than two dozen copies. Several of these have the full title \"On Mr. William Shakespeare, he died in April 1616,\" which means they were unambiguously referring to the Stratford William Shakespeare. In any case, the poem could not be referring to the Earl of Oxford. It was written no earlier than 1616 (12 years after Oxford's death), since it refers to the death of Beaumont, which happened in March 1616, and it was certainly in existence by the time of the First Folio in 1623, since Ben Jonson's eulogy alludes directly to Basse's, and responds to it.\n\n5e. Some time before 1623, a monument was erected to William Shakespeare in Stratford, depicting him as a writer. Antistratfordians desperately try to discredit this evidence by any means possible, but their efforts are misguided and futile. (See The Stratford Monument, and 5i-k below.) From the 1620s on, the monument was consistently seen as representing William Shakespeare, the famous poet.\n\n5f. In the First Folio, John Heminges and Henry Condell said they published the Folio \"onely to keepe the memory of so worthy a Friend, & Fellow alive, as was our Shakespeare, by humble offer of his playes.\" Heminges and Condell had been fellow actors with William Shakespeare in the King's Men for many years, and had been remembered in his will.\n\n5g. In the same volume, Ben Jonson wrote a poem \"To the memory of my beloved, The Author Mr. William Shakespeare,\" in which he says,\n\nSweet Swan of Avon! what a sight it were\n\nTo see thee in our waters yet appeare,\n\nAnd make those flights upon the bankes of Thames,\n\nThat so did take Eliza, and our James!\n\nHere not only does Jonson tie the author to William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon, but he puts him in James I's court. (See 2c and 2d above.) Oxfordians sometimes attempt to claim that this evidence could apply to Oxford by asserting that Oxford owned an estate on the Avon river. While it's true that one of the many estates Oxford inherited from his father was at Bilton on the Avon river, he sold this estate in 1580 (43 years before Jonson's poem), and there is no evidence that he was ever physically present there.\n\n5h. Also in the Folio, Leonard Digges wrote an elegy \"To the Memorie of the deceased Authour Maister W. Shakespeare,\" in which he refers to \"thy Stratford Moniment.\" Digges presumably knew what he was talking about; he was the stepson of William Shakespeare's friend Thomas Russell, and had close ties to Stratford for most of his life. The only surviving letter by him, written a few years before his death, contains gossip of the \"mad relations of Stratford,\" including Thomas Combe, to whom William Shakespeare had left his ceremonial sword in his will."
