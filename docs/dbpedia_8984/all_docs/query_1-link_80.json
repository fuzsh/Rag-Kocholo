        "text": "William Shakespeare, also known as the ‘Bard’, was born in Stratford-upon-Avon on April 23rd 1564. It is thought he married his wife, Anne Hathaway, in 1582, although we have no specific marriage certificate. He pursued a career as an actor, poet and dramatist in London. His now famous plays were performed widely during his lifetime, often at the purpose-built Globe Theatre in London on the south bank of the Thames. The first folio was published in 1623, with 154 sonnets, 37 plays, and 2 long poems. It is suggested that his friends put it together in case others tried to copy Shakespeare’s work and claim it as their own. Since then, he has become internationally renowned as the world’s greatest ever playwright.\n\nOn 25 March 1616, William Shakespeare made his will, signed ‘by me, William Shakspeare’. He probably died in April, after finalising his will over the preceding months, but scholars are unsure of the exact date of his death.\n\nShakespeare’s will itself is a matter of debate. The last will and testament helps us to learn about Shakespeare at the end of his life, providing us with minute details about his final wishes. The source evidence in this lesson shows that he was a man of considerable wealth by the time he died, and that most of it was left to his eldest daughter, Susanna Hall. The will also provides us with three of only six surviving samples of his signature.\n\nThe issue of leaving his ‘second best bed’ to his wife appears insulting and mean to us today. Many scholars believe that Anne Hathaway would have received a considerable inheritance outside the will that would have left her financially secure, making the bed a poignant and personal gift. Some explain that the ‘second best bed’ was actually the bed in which William and his wife Anne would have slept, as the best bed would have been kept for guests only. Others describe this as a direct insult to his wife, yet there are also suggestions that leaving a bed to your wife was actually a magnificent gift, as all the valuable bed linen and fine materials would be included. Finally it has also been proposed that a wife would always get the second best things, with the best reserved for a son or daughter."
