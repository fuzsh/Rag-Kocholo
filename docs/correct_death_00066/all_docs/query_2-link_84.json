        "text": "Born January 2, 1838, Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nDied June 10, 1908, Boise, Idaho\n\nThomas Davis joined a company of 75 men, including his brother Francies and traveled west in 1861. He engaged in mining until 1863, when the area’s need for fresh fruit and vegetables motivated him to acquired 360 acres of government land. His first crops were onions, potatoes and cabbage. The following year he planted a successful fruit orchard.\n\nDavis was also a “founding father” of Boise. On July 7, 1863, eight men met in a cabin belonging to Davis and William Ritchie to lay out the new town site.\n\nHe is best known, though, for his donation of land to the City of Boise to be used as a park. He stipulated that the park be named Julia Davis Park in honor of his wife.\n\nDavis and Julia McCrumb were married in 1871. They became the parents of seven children. Julia, who preceded her husband in death by nine months is also buried in Pioneer Cemetery."
