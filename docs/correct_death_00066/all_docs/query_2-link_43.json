        "text": "Profession: President of the Confederate States of America\n\nBiography: Jefferson Davis (June 3, 1808 – December 6, 1889) was an American politician who served as the President of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1865 during the American Civil War. A member of the Democratic Party, Davis was previously a U.S. Senator from Mississippi and the U.S. Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce.\n\nBorn in Kentucky and raised in Mississippi, Davis graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point. He served as an officer in the United States Army, but resigned his commission to become a cotton planter in Mississippi. His political career began when he was elected to the House of Representatives, but he left to fight in the Mexican–American War, where he served with distinction.\n\nAs a U.S. Senator, Davis advocated for states' rights, including the right to maintain and expand slavery. He argued that each state was sovereign and had an unquestionable right to secede from the Union. These beliefs formed the foundation of his leadership of the Confederacy during the Civil War.\n\nDuring his presidency, Davis struggled to form a cohesive government for the Confederate states and was unable to effectively manage the Southern war effort. He faced immense challenges, including limited resources, internal dissent, and a formidable Union military opposition. His administration was marked by significant military defeats, and in 1865, following the surrender of major Confederate armies, he was captured by Union forces.\n\nAfter the war, Davis was imprisoned for two years and indicted for treason, though he was never tried. His U.S. citizenship was posthumously restored in 1978. Following his release, and after spending some time with his family in Europe, Davis wrote of his war-time experiences in The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government.\n\nBorn: June 3, 1808\n\nBirthplace: Fairview, Kentucky, USA\n\nStar Sign: Gemini"
