        "text": "a plaque that told the tale of how - on April 18, 1865 - Jefferson Davis had been giving a speech to the people of Charlotte, North Carolina. During this speech Davis was handed a telegram that told of Lincoln's death. Half a mile from where Davis learned of Lincoln's death stood the home of George H. Phifer. It would be at Phifer's home that Davis would hold the last full meetings of his cabinet from April 22-26.\n\nFollowing these meetings Davis would continue his flight south from the Union-held Richmond, Virginia. That flight had begun on April 4, 1865 when General Lee warned Davis that the Army of Northern Virginia could no longer defend Richmond.\n\nSpringfield was built ~1806 by John Springs III (1782-1853). Springs served in the S.C. House from 1828 to 1834 and was a partner in several banks, railroads and textile mills prior to the Civil War. John Springs' son, Col. Andrew Baxter Springs (1819-1886), enlarged and remodeled the house in the 1850s. Andrew Baxter Springs served in the S.C. House from 1852 to 1856 and was a delegate to the Secession Convention.\n\nOn the morning of April 27, 1865 Jefferson Davis would meet with his Cabinet and traveling companions back at the home of William Elliott White.\n\nThere, on the lawn of White's house, Postmaster General John H. Reagan was tapped to take the place of outgoing Secretary of the Treasury George A. Trenholm, who had resigned his post due to ill health.\n\nOn the night of April 27, 1865 Davis and company slept at the home of Dr. James Rufus Bratton, a surgeon in the Confederate Army. The house was razed in 1956.\n\nGen. Wallace was still away at war, but Mrs. Wallace and her neighbors served up a fine meal for the Confederate president and his pals.\n\nDavis, et al spent the night of April 28 at the home of Mrs. Giles, whose husband, Col. J. R. R. Giles, had been killed in action at the Battle of Seven Pines. The house stood about a mile from Rose Hill, the plantation of William Henry Gist.\n\nAt the time of Davis' visit the home was owned by Mrs. Mary Whitmire Davis. The Cross Keys House had been built during the years 1812 - 1814 by Barrum Bobo.\n\nA date stone below the west gable lists the year that construction began, 1812, as well as the initials of the contractor who built the house, W. P."
