        "text": "Jefferson Davis, representative and senator from Mississippi in the United States Congress and later president of the Confederate States of America, was born in Todd County, Kentucky, on June 3, 1808. He graduated at the United States Military Academy in 1828 and served seven years in the army before resigning in 1835. After spending nearly ten years as a planter in Mississippi, he became active in Democratic Party politics and won a seat in the United States House of Representatives, which he took he December 1845. He supported the annexation of Texas to the United States.\n\nDavis came to Texas first in 1846, when the volunteer regiment from Mississippi that he commanded was assigned to Zachary Taylor's army on the Rio Grande. He served with distinction in the Mexican War and was elected to the United States Senate in 1847. He resigned from the senate in 1851, but when his friend Franklin Pierce became president in 1853, Davis received an appointment as Secretary of War. In this position, he recommended in 1854 the Texas or thirty-second-parallel route for construction of a railroad to the Pacific Ocean and in 1856 sent camels to Camp Verde in a project to use the animals for army supply and overland transportation."
