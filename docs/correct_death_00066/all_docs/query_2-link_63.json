        "text": "About This Statue\n\nJefferson Davis was born June 3, 1808. He was raised on his family's small plantation near Woodville, Mississippi. He studied at St. Thomas College, Kentucky, and at Transylvania University before graduating from the United States Military Academy in 1828. He served in the Army until 1835, when he became a planter.\n\nHe was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1845 but resigned the following year to command the \"Mississippi Rifles\" in the Mexican War.\n\nFrom 1847 to 1851 he served as a U.S. senator.\n\nAs Secretary of War for President Franklin Pierce (1853–1857) he strengthened the Army and coastal defenses, directed railroad surveys, and supervised the enlarging of the U.S. Capitol and the construction of a water viaduct in Washington, D.C.\n\nHe re-entered the Senate in 1857 and was recognized as a spokesman for the South.\n\nWhen Mississippi seceded, Davis resigned and accepted command of Mississippi's military forces.\n\nHe was elected president of the Confederate States.\n\nWhen the Confederacy surrendered, Davis was captured and imprisoned in Fort Monroe for two years, indicted for treason (but never brought to trial), and finally released on bond in 1867.\n\nAfter travel abroad, he made his home at \"Beauvoir,\" near Biloxi, Mississippi, and wrote Rise and Fall of the Confederated States.\n\nJefferson Davis died in New Orleans on December 6, 1889."
