        "text": "Subject Notes\n\nThis marker was created in order to commemorate the location where Jefferson Davis was standing when he was informed of President Lincoln’s death. At the time, Davis was giving a speech and was handed a telegram regarding Lincoln’s death. Although delivered on April 18, 1865, the telegram incorrectly stated the date of Lincoln’ death at April 11th, rather than April 15th, following his assassination on the evening of April 14th.\n\n(From Newspaper Clipping housed in the Charlotte Mecklenburg Carolina Room Archives) “Jeff Davis was Here,” Charlotte Observer (Charlotte, NC), April 5th, 1979, 2C\n\nTake a walk in the downtown area and you may get a brief history lesson. At the corner of South Tryon and Fourth Streets, in front of City National Bank, there’s a plaque inlaid in the sidewalk that reads “Jefferson Davis was standing here when informed of Lincoln’s death April 18, 1865”\n\nAny good southerner knows Davis was president of the Confederacy during the War between the States. But they may not know the story behind the plaque.\n\nEdwards Waddell, who’s working on a book about historical markers and monuments in Charlotte, said Davis and his cabinet stripped in Charlotte as they fled Richmond, VA after Union troops overran the Confederate Capital. Davis had some trouble finding accommodations here because Union troops threatened to burn the home of anyone who housed Davis. But a man named Lewis F Bates who had a reputation for being a non-conformist, decided to take in Davis.\n\nWhen he arrived at Bates’ house, Davis spoke briefly to the crowd and, while speaking, received a telegram notifying him of Abraham Lincoln’s death.\n\nWaddell said Davis reacted with “horrified disbelief” and handed it to Col. William Johnson to read to the crowd. The plaque marking the incident was probably placed by city workers about 30 years later, Waddell said."
