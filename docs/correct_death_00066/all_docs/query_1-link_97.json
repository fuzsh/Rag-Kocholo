        "text": "The Jefferson Davis collection (91 items) contains political correspondence of Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America. The collection consists of 10 letters written by Davis, including three to Robert E. Lee, and one document signed by Davis. The remaining 80 items are letters to Davis from congressmen, governors, cabinet officers, generals, and local politicians. They offer a variety of opinions and advice on the Confederacy and the war effort related to both political and strategic matters. Other topics discussed include military and political promotions and appointments, Southern public opinion of the war, intelligence and updates from the battlefield, prisons and prisoners, political support in Europe, and Confederate finances.\n\nSelected items include:\n\nJanuary 17, 1861: Jefferson Davis to George Lunt, stating that secession was forced upon the South by Northern aggression and not caused by Lincoln's election\n\nSeptember 3, 1861: Simon Bolivar Buckner to Davis recommending that they take decisive military action in Kentucky\n\nNovember 2, 1861: James B.

After graduating from West Point in 1828, Colonel Zachery Taylor assigned Davis to escort Black Hawk to prison at the end of the Black Hawk War (1832). He sat in Congress as a Democratic representative from Mississippi from 1845 to1846. At the outbreak of the Mexican War, Davis returned to the army and distinguished himself at the battle of Buena Vista (1846). Davis represented Mississippi in the senate from 1847 until 1851, when President Pierce appointed him secretary of war. He returned to the senate in 1857, but resigned with other secessionists in 1861. The constitutional convention at Montgomery, Alabama, selected Davis as provisional President of the Confederate States of America, and on November 6, 1861, the Confederacy officially elected him President. Davis held his headquarters in Richmond, Virginia, where he closely supervised the Confederate Army. Following the war, Davis was imprisoned for two years, and although he was indicted for treason, he was never tried. He spent his later years writing in defense of the Confederacy. He died in New Orleans in 1889.\n\nRelated Materials\n\nThe Clements Library contains several collections with material related to Jefferson Davis, including correspondence and contemporary mentions of Davis (see the card catalog for details).\n\nA few notable selections are listed below:\n\nThe Lewis Cass papers contain six letters concerning Jefferson Davis and his wife Varina Davis:\n\nDavis to Cass (1855 February 24; 1857 March 10, August 3)\n\nCass to Davis (1855 February 27; 1856 July 2)\n\nVarina Davis to Goddard (undated)\n\nThe Clinton H.
