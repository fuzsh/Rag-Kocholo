        "text": "Today's Highlights in History:\n\nOn Dec. 6, 1889, Jefferson Davis, the first and only president of the Confederate States of America, died in New Orleans. The Mark Twain novel \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" was first published in England under the title \"A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur\" (it was published in the U.S. under its more familiar name four days later).\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1790, Congress moved to Philadelphia from New York.\n\nIn 1865, the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, abolishing slavery, was ratified as Georgia became the 27th state to endorse it.\n\nIn 1907, the worst mining disaster in U.S. history occurred as 362 men and boys died in a coal mine explosion in Monongah (muh-NAHN'-guh), West Virginia.\n\nIn 1916, the musical \"Her Soldier Boy,\" featuring the song \"Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag,\" opened on Broadway.\n\nIn 1917, some 2,000 people died when an explosives-laden French cargo ship collided with a Norwegian vessel at the harbor in Halifax, Nova Scotia, setting off a blast that devastated the city.\n\nIn 1922, the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which established the Irish Free State, came into force one year to the day after it was signed in London.\n\nIn 1939, the Cole Porter musical comedy \"Du Barry Was a Lady\" opened on Broadway.\n\nIn 1947, Everglades National Park in Florida was dedicated by President Harry S. Truman.\n\nIn 1957, America's first attempt at putting a satellite into orbit failed as Vanguard TV3 rose about four feet off a Cape Canaveral launch pad before crashing down and exploding.\n\nIn 1969, a free concert by The Rolling Stones at the Altamont Speedway in Alameda County, California, was marred by the deaths of four people, including one who was stabbed by a Hell's Angel.\n\nIn 1973, House minority leader Gerald R. Ford was sworn in as vice president, succeeding Spiro T. Agnew."
