        "text": "The report still comes to us, with apparently strong confirmation now, that JEFFERSON DAVIS, the President of the \"Confederate States,\" is dead. As we stated yesterday, there was nothing improbable in the announcement of his death, as it first reached us. He is known to have been a long time in feeble health. Seldom, for years past, has he been out of the hands of physicians; and only by incessant watchfulness of himself, and by indulging in frequent intervals of relaxation from public duty, has he been able to remain in the public service. His acceptance of the Presidency of the \"Confederate States,\" which involved the labor of organizing a Government and creating and directing an Army and Navy, without means or credit, and without the world's sympathy, to say nothing of the formidable opposition of a nation in arms, was to annihilate all hope of restored and vigorous life. If he is a victim to his ambition, and his burdens have pressed him into his grave, he is happier than if he had lived to see his plans miscarry, and to hear his people's curses on his failure.\n\nBut what of his death? Supposing it to be true that the great rebellion has lost its leader, how will the fact affect the nation? It is impossible to deny that both in the North and South it will be regarded as a momentous event. The Confederates will deplore his death as a great disaster. The loyal States will feel that a daring and inflexible enemy has been removed. Such will be the immediate impressions. The results no one can certainly foresee.\n\nSo far as the Union armies are concerned, so far as the policy of the war is involved, so far as the patriotic people of the United States are interested, the fact of JEFF. DAVIS' death should be accepted as no fact at all. Our action must be the same -- be he alive or dead. Our vigor must be unabated, though STEPHENS, BEAUREGARD, and a score of such chieftains, should follow their great Captain to the silent chambers of the grave. We have to remember the stirring eloquence of the great orator of Greece when he declaimed against PHILIP to the idle newsmongering Athenians: \"Is PHILIP dead?\" \"No; but he is in great danger.\" \"How do these reports concern you? Suppose that PHILIP should receive a fatal stroke? You will soon raise up another Philip, if thus you regard your public affairs; but if the gods which watch over your cause better than you do yourselves, should deprive your enemies of their leader, you can best seize the advantage of his confusion by being in full force in the field before him.\"\n\nSuch was the wisdom of DEMOSTHENES two thousand years ago. And it is the soundest of military tactics now. We must rely for success, not on our enemy's weakness but on our own strength. Never otherwise is the nation safe.\n\nThe rebels may lose heart in losing DAVIS. He was not a great man; but his people believed him great, and with them the effect was morally the same. He had not genius. But he had that tenacity of purpose, that coolness of temper, that boldness of enterprise, and that practical knowledge of the fitness of means to his ends, which will always render a man, when clothed with power, a formidable leader. In many respects, Mr. DAVIS was the fittest man to lead the Confederate rebellion. He was experienced in national administration. He was thoroughly acquainted with the details of the military arm of the Government he was appointed to overthrow. Ho was a successful General in the field, and carried the popular enthusiasm with him when he went to war for his Confederacy. Who else among the Confederates combines such advantages? But there was one great drawback to all these elements of strength. Mr. DAVIS was at best an invalid; and no man was ever yet great enough to govern a nation wisely, or guide an Army safely, whose organs of life failed to perform their functions well enough to leave the mind in repose and master of all its powers.\n\nIn this view of the case, the death of Mr. DAVIS might be as much a loss to us as to the rebels. Even the Southern Press, tolerant as it proverbially is of the shortcomings of its Provisional Government, has not failed to expose, and denounce in unsparing terms, the inefficiency of many Departments of the Confederate Administration. And the murmurings of discontent with the Davis Administration -- not loud, but deep -- were beginning to be heard in the most powerful quarters of the Southern Confederacy -- in Georgia and in New-Orleans. The anxieties thus begotten, to say nothing of the disappointment arising from the coldness of England and France towards his cause, probably had much to do in cutting short the days of Mr. DAVIS, if he be really dead.\n\nHon. ALEX. H. STEPHENS, the Vice-President of the Confederate States, is not in a condition to assume the head of affairs. He is quite as feeble physically as was his Chief, and was lately reported to be lying ill at Manassas. But if well and vigorous even, this is no time for the rule of such as he at Richmond. He does not know war, and he would be overborne by the stormy passions of the revolution. It requires a stem will and an unsparing hand to break in the unruly spirits of armed rebels to obedience to some form of Government. JEFF. DAVIS had great force in that direction. JOHNSON may have it. We doubt if BEAUREGARD has. We are sure that LEE has not. Affairs have a very ugly look for the Confederate States."
