        "text": "On April 2, 1865 General Robert E. Lee sent a telegram to the War Department advising the Confederate President to evacuate Richmond; the end of the war was at hand. Davis turned pale as he read the dreaded message that was delivered to him while he sat in the pews at St. Paul's Episcopal Church. Acting on Lee's advice, Davis and his cabinet fled Richmond that night. The following week, on April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered the army.\n\nDespite having expressed his share of disappointment and bitterness after the war, during the latter years of his life he was reflective on the outcome of the events, and was willing to put the past behind him for the sake of the future of the South. In his final speech that he delivered in 1887, Davis proclaimed:\n\nThe past is dead; let it bury its dead, its hopes, and its aspirations. Before you lies the future, a future full of golden promise, a future of expanding national glory, before which all the world shall stand amazed. Let me beseech you to lay aside all rancor, all bitter sectional feeling, and to take your places in the ranks of those who will bring about a consummation to be wishedÂ—a reunited country.\n\nJefferson Davis died in New Orleans in December 1889, and was re-interred in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, on May 31, 1893. His wife and children are buried beside him in the Davis Circle.\n\nPhotos of Richmond from the top: Davis's Executive Mansion, known today as The Museum and The White House of the Confederacy (by DLO); St. Paul's Episcopal Church (by DLO); and Davis's bronze monument at his gravesite in Hollywood Cemetery (by CNO).\n\nJournal Index | Previous Page | Next PageBack | Home"
