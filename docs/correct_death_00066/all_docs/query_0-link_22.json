Jefferson Davis died in this Garden District mansion in 1889. 2020 Update: This UDC Davis memorial has been removed\n\nWaymark Code: WMQZAH\n\nLocation: Louisiana, United States\n\nViews: 7\n\nThe waymark coordinates are located at the Garden District mansion where former Confederate President Jefferson Davis died in 1889. The home is located at 1134 First Street, just 2 blocks off the OST as it passes on St Charles Avenue through the Garden District of New Orleans.\n\nIn 2020 this memorial to Jefferson Davis has been removed.\n\nFrom Roadside America website: (visit link)\n\nAn upright granite slab stands in front of a columned, plantation-style house, between the sidewalk and street. The side facing the street is inscribed with the resume of Jefferson Davis, the \"First and Only President of the Confederate States of America\" (and includes his stint as a post-war prisoner). The side facing the house notes that this is where Davis died on December 6, 1889, a \"Christian chieftain\" and \"truly great American.\"\n\nPresidents rarely have their death sites memorialized (with an occasional exception) but Davis was the only one of his kind, so he got a slab. It didn't arrive until 1930, over 40 years after he was dead.\"\n\nBlasterz think the reason for the delay was for the United Daughters of the Confederacy's \"Lost Cause\" mythmaking machine to gear up and raise a lot of money for these kinds of monuments all over the South. The UDC very busy erecting memorials and monuments from the 1890s-1940s.\n\nFrom Wikipedia: (visit link)\n\nThe Garden District is a neighborhood of the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. A subdistrict of the Central City/Garden District Area, its boundaries as defined by the City Planning Commission are: St. Charles Avenue to the north, 1st Street to the east, Magazine Street to the south, and Toledano Street to the west. The National Historic Landmark district extends a little farther.\n\nThe area was originally developed between 1832 and 1900 and is considered one of the best-preserved collections of historic mansions in the Southern United States. The 19th-century origins of the Garden District illustrate wealthy newcomers building opulent structures based upon the prosperity of New Orleans in that era. (National Trust, 2006)\"\n\nOld road maps of the 1920-1930s show clearly that the OST crossed the Mississippi River from Jefferson Parish via ferry and entered New Orleans at Louisiana Street, proceeded up Louisiana Street to St Charles Avenue, turned east onto St Charles to Canal Street, turned north on Canal Street through the Central business district to Gentilly Road, and then turned east out of New Orleans along Gentilly Road to Chalmette.\n\nThis would have run the OST through the famously beautiful New Orleans Garden District along St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans.\n\nSource: (visit link)\n\nSubmission Criteria: Period Culture\n\nDistinctive or Significant Interest\n\nWebsite with More Information: [Web Link]Address of Waymark:\n\n1134 First Street\n\nNew Orleans , LA\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nWhen visiting a waymark, please take a picture that clearly shows the point of interest (feel free to include you and/or members of your group in the photo as well).
