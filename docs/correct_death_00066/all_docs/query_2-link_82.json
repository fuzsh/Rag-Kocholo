        "text": "Jefferson Davis (1808-1899)\n\nPresident of the Confederates States of America\n\nJefferson Davis was born in Kentucky on June 3, 1808. At 16m, he entered the U.S. Military Academy, graduating in 1828. Davis served in the army for seven years. He fought in campaigns against Indian removal after the Black Hawk War. In 1835, Davis married Sarah Taylor. They moved to Mississippi to manage his cotton plantation. When his wife died, Davis traveled for a year and studied the U.S. Constitution. He continued to manage his plantation and become wealthy.\n\nDavis became a U.S. Congressman in 1845. That same year, he married Varina Howell. He resigned from Congress in 1846 to become a colonel in a regiment of Mississippi volunteers in the Mexican War. In 1847, the governor of Mississippi appointed Davis to fill out the term of a U.S. Senator who had died. In 1850, Davis resigned from the senate to run for governor. He lost the election and retired to his plantation. In 1853, President Pierce appointed him Secretary of War. After his term expired, Davis was reelected to the Senate and served as a spokesman for the South. He believed strongly in states’ rights and demanded that Congress protected slavery.\n\nAfter Abraham Lincoln was elected president, the state of Mississippi seceded from the Union. Davis resigned for the Senate again, and was named President of the Confederate States of America. He ran the government from its capital in Richmond, Virginia. He was a good administrator, but poor planner. He had difficulties with his Congress and was considered inflexible. As president, he insisted on a strategy of defending all Southern territory equally, which was too expensive. This strategy also allowed Union forces to hit hard invulnerable areas such as New Orleans and Atlanta. When the South lost the war, Davis was taken prisoner. A grand jury indicted him for treason, and he was held in prison for two years, awaiting trial. A Northerner paid his bail, and Davis was released. He was never tried. Davis spent his last years writing about his war experiences.\n\n16th May 1865\n\nMrs JS Marble\n\nDear Madam\n\nYour favor of the 1st [?] came duly to hand and found us all Enjoying our usual Share of good Health and very glad to have that you and your family were all Enjoying a full Share of the Same Great Blessings hope it will long continue.\n\nYou may well say we have had exciting times the Murder of Mr Lincoln cast a gloom over our town more so that I ever seen before even the Rebbels among us felt it very much many spoke out and said it was the worst thing that could have happened for the South.\n\nDid you ever see any thing cave in as fast as the Rebellion has since the taking of Richmond I have always thought that Gen Lee was an honerable man but that state pride had led him astray. the way of Transgressess is hard\n\nJeff Davis has been captured and will arive in Washington in about a week there is no Honour in him he must have been very much Scared when he tried to disguise himself in his wife’s cloack he forgot the Boots well he did. how true that the way of Transgresors is hard. he is a bad man dear knows what they will do with him they must have had Some Strong Proof against him to offer So large a Reward.\n\nThere will be Some hanging about Washington before they are done with those they are trying now.
