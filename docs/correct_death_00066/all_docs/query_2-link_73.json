        "text": "When someone mentions the name Jefferson Davis, almost everyone knows he was the one and only President of the Confederacy from 1861 to 1865 during the Civil War. What most people do not know is that while he was a staunch supporter of state rights and the South, he was a strong advocate of the United States in his early life. At the age of 16, President James Monroe (5th President of U.S.), recommended him for his appointment at West Point. Upon graduating from West Point in 1828, Jefferson Davis joined the military and fought in the Black Hawk War of 1831.\n\nIn June of 1835, Davis married his commanding officer's daugher, Sarah Knox Taylor. His commanding officer would become the future 12th president of the United States, Zachary Taylor. Taylor was opposed to the marriage as he did not want his daughter marrying a military man; Davis abruptly resigned his military post to take of civic duties prior to the wedding. Sadly, Sarah died of malaria just three months after the wedding!\n\nJefferson returned to Mississippi where he became a cotton farmer and began his political career. In 1844 he was a presidential elector and he cast his vote for James K. Polk, a Tennessean and the 11th President of the United States. In 1845, he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives from Mississippi and he married Varina Banks Howell, an 18 year old daughter of a Mississippi planter. They would go on to have six children.\n\nIn June of 1846, Jefferson Davis resigned his position in Congress to fight in the Mexican-American War where he held the rank of colonel under his former father-in-law, General Zachary Taylor. He led his men to victory in the Battle of Monterrey and he was injured at the Battle of Buena Vista when he blocked a charge of Mexican swords--the incident earned him nationwide support. General Taylor was so impressed that he admitted that he has misjudged Davis's character... he said that \"My daughter, sir, was a better judge of man than I was\". Zachery Taylor would become the 12th President of the U.S. in March 1949 but would only serve for 16 months as he became suddenly ill in July of 1850 and died. Millard Fillmore then became the 13th President of the U.S.\n\nJefferson Davis became a Senator representing Mississippi in 1847-1851 and again in 1857-1861. In 1853, he served as the Secretary of War under Franklin Pierce (14th U.S. President). One of Davis's most outstanding accomplishments during his tenure as a U.S. senator was his strong support and advocacy for the expansion of the U.S. Capital building in Washington.\n\nJefferson Davis remained in the Senate until January 1861 when he resigned when Mississippi left the Union; he was named president of the Confederate States of America (CSA) on February 18, 1861 and the rest is history. After the surrender by General Lee to General Grant at Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia on April 9th, Jefferson Davis was captured by Union forces in Georgia on May 10, 1865 and charged with treason. Davis was imprisioned at Fort Monroe in Virginia for two years from May 22, 1865 to May 13, 1867.\n\nCoincidentally, President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865 and died the next morning ... making Andrew Johnson, a Tennesean the next U.S. President. Andrew Johnson was partial to rebuilding the South during Reconstruction and he fell out of favor with the northern victors of the Civil War and was impeached by the House of Representatives and came within ONE vote of ultimately being impeached by the Senate. While some wanted to try Jefferson Davis for treason, many feared that he would become a martyr if convicted. On May 13, 1867, bail was set at $100,000 and bond was immediately posted by the abolitionist Horace Greely; a representative of Cornelius Vanderbilt; and a number of Richmond businessmen. Ultimately, he would never stand trial, the indictment was dismissed as were indictments against thirty-seven ex-confederates including Robert E. Lee. On October 17, 1978, a Joint resolution was passed by Congress and signed into law by Jimmy Carter restoring Davis' citizenship, effective December 25, 1868!"
