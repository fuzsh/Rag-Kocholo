Very Good.\n\n\"This lithograph depicts Jefferson Davis from the waist up, facing the viewer's right. He wears a dark suit with black bow tie and white collared shirt. His hair is parted to the side and is worn long over his ears. He is clean shaven except for a long goatee. 'Lith. & Published by Blelock & Co. 130 Canal St. New Orleans' is printed under the image\" [Description of this portrait at the online Lincoln Financial Foundation Collection].\n\nAccording to AAS, \"Blelock & Co. were active in New Orleans from 1866 until 1868.\" This print is based on a pre-war Brady photograph. \"Blelock and Company was active in New Orleans until the city fell to Union forces, whereupon the firm apparently moved to New York until the end of the war. It returned to Louisiana and was listed in the New Orleans city directory again by 1866. As this print bears a New Orleans address, it was most likely printed either in 1861 or after 1865\" [Neely & Holzer].\n\nP&W 6150 [?]. Neely & Holzer, The Confederate Image, Plate 16.
