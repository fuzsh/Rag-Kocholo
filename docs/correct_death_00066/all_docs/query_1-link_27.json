        "text": "The Davises moved to Washington in 1853, residing there more or less full-time until January 1861. While Davis was busy at work, Varina Davis enjoyed the social life and educational possibilities of the nation’s capital. As secretary of war, Davis took a personal interest in a myriad of projects: enlarging and raising pay for the army; improvement of the West Point curriculum; surveying routes for a railroad to the Pacific; expanding and moving westward the “chain of forts” to protect settlers; enlarging the Capitol; construction of the Washington aqueduct; improvement of national defenses, especially rivers and harbors; importing camels for army transportation in the West; developing scientific advances in weaponry; sending the first-ever military commission abroad to observe European armies in the Crimean War; and, all the while, serving as one of the president’s closest advisers on domestic policies.\n\nAt the end of President Pierce’s term in 1857, Davis was re-elected to his favorite spot, a seat in the U.S. Senate where he advocated a strict interpretation of the Constitution. In the period leading up to the American Civil War, Davis was a prominent spokesman for the South, but a moderate one, never calling for war and laboring to keep the Union together until Mississippi seceded from the Union in January 1861. Davis resigned his Senate seat and returned home, sick at heart. He accepted the position of major general to command the state’s army and prepare the state for defense. Never one to think that the United States would allow the seceded states to leave in peace, he foresaw a terrible conflict—as he phrased it, “troubles and thorns innumerable.”\n\nDavis was tending his garden at Brierfield when the news came of his election as president of the Confederate States of America. Varina Davis would later write that she thought surely some family member had died when she saw his reaction to the telegram. Duty-bound, he left the next day for Montgomery, Alabama, to accept the presidency. Davis was chosen as the president because no other southerner had a military and political record equal to his.\n\nAs the only president of the Confederacy, Davis was in a unique situation as he struggled to run a war and, simultaneously, to mold a new country. Like his northern counterpart, Abraham Lincoln, Davis had epic struggles with his army commanders, the state governors, and Congress. Unlike Lincoln, he lacked the essential resources to ensure success. During the four-year war, he mourned Confederate losses, especially the deaths of many friends and family members in military service. After Robert E. Lee surrendered the main Confederate army on April 9, 1865, Davis was captured in May while trying to make his way to the Mississippi River to lead southern forces that had not yet surrendered.\n\nIndicted for treason—but never tried—and imprisoned for two years at Fort Monroe, Virginia, Davis endured solitary confinement and limited contact with the world beyond the fort, his health and morale declining until his release in May 1867. He was now a man without a country, had no salary or savings, and had no home because Brierfield had been seized by Union troops in 1862 and sold in 1866. Along with thousands of others, he had gambled all and lost all on the Confederacy. With a wife and four children age three to twelve to provide for (two sons had died), he lived in Canada and England, hoping to find a suitable job. Finally, in 1869 he agreed to be president of a Memphis, Tennessee, life insurance company and lived there until the mid-1870s.\n\nHis fortunes changed in 1876. A longtime admirer, Sarah Ellis Dorsey, offered him a cottage on her seaside estate near Biloxi, Mississippi, as a place to write his memoirs of the war. There, he was home at last. He loved Beauvoir, a property that provided welcome peace and quiet. The property became his when Dorsey bequeathed it to him in her will. During the 1880s he penned his two-volume memoir of the war, along with another book and several magazine articles. He and Varina Davis, who helped him with writing, entertained rafts of visitors and they regained ownership of Brierfield after a long legal battle. Davis resumed extensive traveling, speaking mainly at Confederate veterans’ events.\n\nIn November 1889 he fell ill on his way to Brierfield and died in New Orleans, Louisiane on December 6, most likely of pneumonia. The year before his death, the former President of the Confederate States of America beseeched the young men of Mississippi to “lay aside all rancor, all bitter sectional feeling, and to make your places in the ranks of those who will bring about a consummation devoutly to be wished—a reunited country.”\n\nBefore an estimated crowd of 200,000 people—the South’s largest funeral at that time—he was interred in Metairie Cemetery in Louisiana, and in 1893, re-interred in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital identified with his most famous political years.\n\nOn October 17, 1978, a Joint resolution passed by Congress and signed by President Jimmy Carter restored Davis' citizenship, effective December 25, 1868\n\nPermission for the legacy story.
