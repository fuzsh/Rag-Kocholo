Davis, then contemplating a career in politics, was also a Democrat, while Varina shared the Whig views of her family. In spite of the differences in their age and politics Varina was almost instantly attracted to the older man. . . From their surviving correspondence it is known that the wedding was initially planned as a very grand affair to be held at Hurricane during Christmas of 1844. For unknown reasons the wedding and the engagement were cancelled shortly before that date. In January 1845 Varina grew sick with a fever and Davis, fearful of her health, came frequently to visit, evidently proposing again during her recovery. Jefferson Davis and Varina Howell's second engagement was very short and informal, culminating in their marriage on February 26, 1845 at her parents house, an affair attended only by a few relatives and friends of the bride and none of the groom's family.\n\t\n\tVarina's private letters reflect an astute and realistic understanding of the practicalities of southern secession; she understood and to some extent sympathized with secession but believed that should the United States fight the withdrawal a war with them would be almost impossible to win (due ironically in no small part to her husband's strengthening of the United States armed forces during his tenure as Secretary of War). Upon her husband's resignation from the Senate at the time of Mississippi's secession, Varina returned to the family plantation at Brierfield where she anticipated he would be commissioned a general in the Confederate army. She expressed dismay when he was instead named President of the Confederate States of America and did not accompany him when he traveled to Montgomery, Alabama (then capital of the new nation) to be inaugurated. She followed a few weeks later and immediately assumed official duties as the First Lady of the Confederate States of America.\n\t\n\tWhen the war ended with the defeat of the CSA, she and her husband fled South hoping to escape to Europe, but they were captured and he was imprisoned at Fort Monroe in Phoebus, Virginia, for two years. Varina was left indigent and with her freedom of movement restricted to the state of Georgia where Davis had been arrested. Fearing for their safety she sent her older children to Canada under the care of relatives and a family servant. Initially forbidden to have any contact with her husband, she worked tirelessly to secure her husband's release and to raise awareness of and sympathy for what she perceived as his unjust incarceration. After a few months she was allowed to correspond with him, and after public sympathy turned towards to Davis following publication of several articles and a book on his confinement (writings that Davis himself said were much exaggerated) she and their infant daughter were allowed to join him in his prison cell, eventually being moved to a more comfortable apartment in the officer's quarters of the fort.\n\t\n\tIn later years Varina Howell Davis offended many of the Lost Cause, who saw her as the heir to her husband's mantle as icon of the Confederacy, by her move to New York City and by her associations.
