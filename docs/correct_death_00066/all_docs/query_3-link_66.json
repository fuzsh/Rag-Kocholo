        "text": "This article, the first detailed scholarly assessment of northern responses to the death of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis in December 1889, contributes to ongoing academic debates over the troubled process of sectional reconciliation after the Civil War. Southern whites used their leader's funeral obsequies to assert not only their affection for the deceased but also their devotion to the Lost Cause that he had championed and embodied. Based on an analysis of northern newspapers and mass-circulation magazines in the two weeks after Davis's death, the essay demonstrates that many northerners, principally Republican politicians and editors, Union veterans, and African Americans, were outraged by southerners’ flagrant willingness to laud a man whom they regarded as the arch-traitor and that they remained opposed to reconciliation on southern terms. However, despite continuing concerns about public displays of affection for the Confederacy evident at the time of Davis's reinterment in Richmond in May 1893, northern opposition to the Lost Cause waned rapidly in the last decade of the nineteenth century. Full-blown sectional reconciliation occurred after the Republicans gave up on their efforts to enforce black voting rights in the South and President William McKinley's imperialist foreign policy necessitated, and to some degree garnered, support from southern whites. The death of Jefferson Davis, therefore, can be seen as an important event in the difficult transition from a heavily sectionalized postwar polity to a North-South rapprochement based heavily on political pragmatism, sentiment, nationalism, and white supremacism.\n\n7 Scholarship on the death of Jefferson Davis is limited to a single book chapter and a few pages scattered in biographies and histories of sectional reconciliation and the Lost Cause. Collins, The Death and Resurrection of Jefferson Davis (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2005), 49–85, is a useful but predominantly descriptive account of the president's passing and some of the responses to it. Although the author acknowledged some hostile northern reactions, he contended that these were “relatively few in number” and treated the event as evidence that sectional reconciliation was well underway. Ibid., 57. This thesis was broadly consistent with Blight's contention in Race and Reunion that the forces driving better feelings between northerners and southerners had become unstoppable by the late 1880s. Blight devoted only a few lines to Davis's death, interpreting it as “signal” evidence of southern whites’ growing determination “to proclaim the glory of their failed revolution and to refurbish their self-respect.” Ibid., 266–67. Buck, Paul H., The Road to Reunion 1865–1900 (Boston: Little, Brown, and Co, 1937), 254Google Scholar, claimed that “An epoch ended with his [Davis's] death” because “[h]e alone seemed to represent a past that could not be assimilated into the present.” Buck, however, noted the continuing power of sectionalism in American politics until the early 1890s. For Caroline Janney, the most important aspect of Davis's death was the “torrent of vitriol” that it attracted from Federal veterans’ groups like the Grand Army of the Republic. Janney, Remembering the Civil War, 182–83. Unlike Donald Collins, Neff portrayed southern mourning for Davis as predominantly sectional in nature and providing “a foundation for a particularly aggressive resurgence in Southern rhetoric and commemorative activities.” Neff, Honoring the Civil War Dead, 174. Of Davis's biographers, Hudson Strode, Jefferson Davis, Tragic Hero: The Last Twenty-Five Years, 1865–1889 (New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1964), 507–26, provided the fullest description of the president's funeral. He based his erroneous contention that “[t]he majority of the leading Northern papers … were not only fair, but admiring in their comments [on the deceased]” on evidence from two Democratic and one independent newspaper in New York. Cooper, William J., Jefferson Davis, American (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2000)Google Scholar, the standard modern biography, provided no coverage of the rituals and responses that followed his subject's demise.\n\n8 I chose these newspapers and journals using a combination of informed scholarship and random selection based on the availability of Gilded Age newspapers in the Library of Congress and on the Readex Early American Newspapers, 1800–1901 digital website. I consulted small-town and major urban papers, the circulation of which varied greatly from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands in the case of mass-circulation papers like the New York World. Typically, their content was determined by their partisan affiliation. The majority of those whose partisan identity could be identified were Republican but around a third were Democrat or Independent. Four were African American newspapers.\n\n57 New York Age, Dec. 14, 1889. Davis addressed his last words to his wife, Varina, as she tried to administer medicine. Collins, Death and Resurrection, 52. Although Fortune chose to interpret them for public effect as a belated sign of repentance, it seems more likely that Davis was simply declaring his wish to die. The president had never previously apologized for his political conduct, and it would have been out of character for him to engage in a death-bed conversion that would have cast doubt on his own whole career. As Karl Guthke has observed, the last words of great men have often assumed importance as proof of a good life lived consistently. Guthke, Last Words: Variations on a Theme in Cultural History (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press), 50–51.\n\n71 Philadelphia Inquirer, Dec. 10, 1889. The row inside the Grand Army elicited President Harrison's only public comment on the burgeoning controversy over Davis's death. It came while he was en route from Washington to Chicago to attend a concert to mark the opening of the Chicago Auditorium. Asked by a reporter in Pittsburgh about “the propriety” of Federal veterans marching in the funeral parade, he responded guardedly that “the G.A.R. must regulate their own conduct.” It is reasonable to assume that his private view on how to respond to Davis's passing was consistent with the decision of his Union comrade, Redfield Proctor, not to lower the flag on the war department to half-mast. Louisville Commercial, Dec. 11, 1889."
