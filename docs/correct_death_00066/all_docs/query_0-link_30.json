        "text": "When Lee surrendered to the North without Davis’s approval, Davis and his cabinet moved south, hoping to reach the trans-Mississippi area and continue the struggle until better terms could be secured from the North. At dawn on May 10, 1865, Davis was captured near Irwinville, Georgia. He was imprisoned in a damp casemate at Fort Monroe, Virginia, and was put in leg-irons. Though outraged Northern public opinion brought about his removal to healthier quarters, Davis remained a prisoner under guard for two more years. Finally, in May 1867, he was released on bail and went to Canada to regain his shattered health. Several notable Northern lawyers offered their free services to defend him in a treason trial, which Davis longed for. The government, however, never forced the issue—because, many believe, it feared that such a trial might establish that the original Constitution gave the states a right to secede. The case was finally dropped on December 25, 1868.\n\nDavis made five trips to Europe in an effort to regain his health, and for a few years he served as president of an insurance company in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1877 he retired to Beauvoir, a small Gulf-side estate near Biloxi, Mississippi, which a patriotic admirer provided for him. There he wrote The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government (1880). Though pressed to enter the U.S. Senate, he declined to “ask for amnesty,” for he felt he had done nothing wrong in fighting for states’ rights under the Constitution, and he never regained his citizenship. He remained the chief spokesman and apologist for the defeated South. Davis’s citizenship was restored posthumously in 1978.\n\nThough dedicated to the principles of democracy, Davis was by nature a benevolent aristocrat. He was diplomatic to a degree, but he did not possess the pliancy of the professional politician. His sensitivity to criticism stood in stark contrast to the single-minded imperturbability with which his greater counterpart, Lincoln, pursued his own war aims. Davis died in 1889 in New Orleans of a complicated bronchial ailment. At his temporary interment he was accorded the greatest funeral the South had ever known. On May 31, 1893, he was buried permanently in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond.\n\nHudson Strode"
