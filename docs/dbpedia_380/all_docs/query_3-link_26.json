        "text": "Everyone loves a bit of code, and acronyms and abbreviations are great little tools that make communication faster and more fun, especially when trying to type fast on a slippery smartphone. And in English, you really canât get away from them.\n\nHere are 15 that youâll encounter often and that every English speaker should know.\n\nBut first, a quick cheat sheet:\n\nAbbreviations are shortened versions of words and sometimes end in a period (for example, accomm. for accommodation or adj. for adjective).\n\nAcronyms are pronounceable, so you read them out as if theyâre a name, and are formed by using the first letter of each word in a phrase (such as NASA â National Aeronautics and Space Administration).\n\nAn initalism is when the word is pronounced letter by letter, such as the UN (the United Nations). (Fun fact â âtheâ is usually added before an initialism but not an acronym, as in âIâm an interpreter at the UN,â or âI have an interview at NASA.â)\n\n1. RSVP â Please reply\n\nAs with so much of English, this comes from French. RSVP stands for âRÃ©pondez sâil vous plaitâ. Youâll see this request on invitations to weddings and other parties. And yes, please do reply â that way, the bride or host knows exactly how many salmon filletsÂ to order.\n\n2. ASAP â As soon as possible\n\nâCan you get this in ASAP?â reads the email from your boss. Depending on the project, this may or may not cause panic â but in any case, you donât have much time to think!\n\n3. AM/PM â Before midday (morning) and after midday (afternoon)\n\nThereâs a huge difference between 5 in the morning and 5 in the afternoon â and these little terms have it covered. Remember, donât use them if you use 24-hour time (6 PM is the same as 18:00) and be careful to set your alarm correctly. A âmorningâ alarm that goes off at 7 PM doesnât help anyone!\n\n4. LMK â Let me know\n\nCasual, friendly â perfect for the end of a text. LMK shows that your are expecting confirmation or more information.\n\n5. BRB â Be right back\n\nSometimes when chatting, something demands our attention: be it the doorbell, a cat wanting to be let out or an irresistible caffeineâ craving. Donât sweat it â just let your friend know youâll BRB.\n\n6. DOB â Date of birth\n\nâWhat IS my DOB?â you might have wondered the first time you saw this. After all, it does sound like a poorly chosen item of clothing or foul type of medicine. Well, rest assured you do have a DOB â we all do. You probably celebrate yours each year with far too much cake, ice cream and requisite silly hats.\n\n7. CC/BCC â Carbon copy/blind carbon copy\n\nAlthough they refer to the age of email, these terms take their names from the analogue years, when copies were made using carbon paper. Quick etiquette tip: when adding people to the CC email field, remember they âcan clearlyâ see who else has received the email . (And donât âreply allâ unless you REALLY want to!)\n\n8. TBA/TBC- To be announced/To be confirmed\n\nRemember your friend whose wedding invitation you need to RSVP ASAP to? Be careful if it says venue TBA or groom TBC. It means she doesnât have everything organized just yet!\n\n9. ETA â Estimated time of arrival\n\nâSee you on Tuesday, ETA 9 PM.â You might see this when someone is traveling but is unsure of when their flight gets in.\n\n10. TGIF â Thank God itâs Friday\n\nSung by workers worldwide each Friday afternoon â the weekend is here!\n\n11. FOMO â Fear of missing out\n\nAnd with the weekend can come a some pretty serious FOMO. Imagine: Youâve been invited out but donât feel like going. But, at the same time, you know itâll be fun fun and that you may regret not going. So you agonize over what to do.\n\n12. IMO â in my opinion (or IMHO â in my humble opinion)\n\nWeâve all got a few opinions.Â This is how you can express them.\n\n13. n/a â not available, not applicable\n\nUse this when filling out a form to show that particular section doesnât apply to you.\n\n14. aka â Also known as\n\nThis little beauty is used to refer to someone or something by another name â often a nickname, such as how your bro (might) refer to his newborn baby (âThis is Eddie, aka âThe poop machine'â), or how Chile refers to a much-loved footballer, Alexis Sanchez, aka âEl NiÃ±o Maravillaâ.\n\n15. DIY â Do it yourself\n\nPeople who are interested in completing tasks themselves rather than hiring professionals (aka DIY-ers) exist in all walks of life. From fixing electronics and upholstering furniture to completely renovating their homes, as you can imagine, DIY projects can result in as many great successes as horrible messes!"
