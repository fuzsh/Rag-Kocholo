Despite the positive correlations between blood pressure (BP) levels and later CV events since BP levels as low as 100/60 mmHg have been reported in numerous epidemiological studies, the diagnostic criteria of hypertension and BP thresholds and targets of antihypertensive therapy have largely remained at the level of 140/90 mmHg in the past 30 years. The publication of both the SPRINT and STEP trials (comprising > 8,500 Caucasian/African and Chinese participants, respectively) provided evidence to shake this 140/90 mmHg dogma. Another dogma regarding hypertension management is the dependence on office (or clinic) BP measurements. Although standardized office BP measurements have been widely recommended and adopted in large-scale CV outcome trials, the practice of office BP measurements has never been ideal in real-world practice. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) is easy to perform, more likely to be free of environmental and/or emotional stress, feasible to document long-term BP variations, of good reproducibility and reliability, and more correlated with hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) and CV events, compared to routine office BP measurements. In the 2022 Taiwan Hypertension Guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology (TSOC) and the Taiwan Hypertension Society (THS), we break these two dogmas by recommending the definition of hypertension as ≥ 130/80 mmHg and a universal BP target of < 130/80 mmHg, based on standardized HBPM obtained according to the 722 protocol. The 722 protocol refers to duplicate BP readings taken per occasion (\"2\"), twice daily (\"2\"), over seven consecutive days (\"7\"). To facilitate implementation of the guidelines, a series of flowcharts encompassing assessment, adjustment, and HBPM-guided hypertension management are provided. Other key messages include that: 1) lifestyle modification, summarized as the mnemonic S-ABCDE, should be applied to people with elevated BP and hypertensive patients to reduce life-time BP burden; 2) all 5 major antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [A], angiotensin receptor blockers [A], β-blockers [B], calcium-channel blockers [C], and thiazide diuretics [D]) are recommended as first-line antihypertensive drugs; 3) initial combination therapy, preferably in a single-pill combination, is recommended for patients with BP ≥ 20/10 mmHg above targets; 4) a target hierarchy (HBPM-HMOD- ambulatory BP monitoring [ABPM]) should be considered to optimize hypertension management, which indicates reaching the HBPM target first and then keeping HMOD stable or regressed, otherwise ABPM can be arranged to guide treatment adjustment; and 5) renal denervation can be considered as an alternative BP-lowering strategy after careful clinical and imaging evaluation.\n\nKeywords: Blood pressure, Diagnosis, Drug, Guidelines, Hypertension, Treatment\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n1.

INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Main themes\n\nHypertension is the most important modifiable cause of cardiovascular (CV) disease and all-cause mortality worldwide.1,2 Numerous epidemiological studies and pharmacological intervention trials have demonstrated that lower and lowering blood pressures (BP) are associated with fewer CV events and lower mortality.3,4 Despite the positive correlations between BP levels and later CV events since BP levels as low as 100/60 mmHg in almost all large-scale epidemiological studies,4-6 the diagnostic criteria of hypertension and BP thresholds and targets of antihypertensive treatment have largely remained at the level of 140/90 mmHg in the past 30 years (since the release of the Fifth Report of the Joint National Committee [JNC 5] on high BP in 1993).7 The publication of both the SPRINT and the STEP trials (comprising > 8,500 Caucasian/African and Chinese participants, respectively) provides enough evidence to shake this 140/90 mmHg dogma.8,9 In both trials, lowering systolic BP (SBP) to < 130 mmHg, compared to the traditional SBP target of < 140 (130-139) mmHg, was consistently associated with a 25-30% relative risk reduction in CV events. Another dogma regarding hypertension management is the dependence on office (or clinic) BP measurements.10,11 Although standardized office BP measurement has been widely recommended,12 the practice of office BP measurement has never been ideal in real-world practice. Further, the debate regarding the numerical equivalence between automated office BP (AOBP) measurement adopted in the SPRINT trial and office BP measurement has never been settled. The variations of office BP readings and the differences between office BP and home BP readings bewilder not only patients, but also healthcare professionals. On the other hand, out-of-office BP monitoring receives growing attention in contemporary hypertension guidelines.11,13 Home BP monitoring (HBPM) and ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) are two recognized approaches to obtaining out-of-office BP. HBPM is easy-to-use, more likely to be free of environmental and/or emotional stress (such as white-coat effect), feasible to document long-term BP variations, of good reproducibility and reliability, and more correlated with hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) and CV events.1 The Taiwan Hypertension Society (THS) and the Taiwan Society of Cardiology (TSOC) jointly issued the Consensus Statement on HBPM in 2020.1 The \"722\" protocol to standardize HBPM has been advocated by both Societies and widely accepted by healthcare professionals. In the 2022 Taiwan Hypertension Guidelines, we break the dogma of \"office BP-based management strategy\" and further expand the role of HBPM to the whole hypertension management process, from diagnosis to long-term follow-up. The Task Force considers that, to improve the quality of long-term management of hypertension, patients themselves should take an active role and HBPM is the right tool to achieve this goal, regardless of many other advantages of HBPM.14 This approach is of particularly importance in the post-COVID era and can bridge the management with artificial intelligence technologies. To facilitate implementation of the guidelines, a series of flowcharts encompassing assessment, adjustment, and HBPM-guided hypertension management are provided. A total of 112 recommendations/keypoints are itemized. Changes between the 2022 and 2015/2017 Taiwan Hypertension Guidelines, new recommendations, and the \"not to do\" list are summarized in , , , , .\n\nTable 1C\n\n• Routine office BP should not be used for the diagnosis and management of hypertension unless the recommended BP measurement protocol is followed.• People without a habit of alcohol consumption should not start drinking for any reason.• Binge drinking (defined as ≥ 5 and ≥ 4 drinks for men and women, respectively, in 2 hours) should be strictly prohibited to reduce BP, as well as the risk of atrial fibrillation, stroke and sudden death.• High-intensity exercise is not recommended for patients with uncontrolled hypertension (SBP > 160 mmHg).• Any combination of direct renin inhibitor, ACE inhibitors and ARBs is contraindicated.• It is not recommended to lower BP in the prehospital setting without knowing the phenotypes of stroke.• Routine aggressive BP lowering is not recommended unless BP ≥ 220/120 or in the presence of other situations needing immediate BP lowering (such as acute aortic dissection, congestive heart failure with lung edema, hypertensive encephalopathy) within 24 hours of acute ischemic stroke without undergoing thrombolytic or endovascular therapy.• Salt reduction (less than 6 g/day) is not recommended as a non-drug therapy for gestational hypertension.• ACE inhibitors, ARBs, DRI, ARNI, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and chlorothiazide are teratogenic. Women with hypertension who become pregnant, are planning to become pregnant, or with child-bearing potential without reliable contraception, should avoid, or immediately withdraw these drugs in case of pregnancy.• Oral contraceptives should not be used in women with uncontrolled hypertension.• Hormone replacement therapy, as well as selective estrogen receptor modulators, should not be used for the primary or secondary prevention of CV diseases in postmenopausal women.\n\n1.2 Development of the guidelines\n\nTaiwan Hypertension Guidelines and related works (Focused Update/Consensus) evaluate and integrate available evidence with the purpose of assisting healthcare professionals in constructing the best management strategies for each individual patient. Members of this Task Force were jointly selected by the THS and the Hypertension Committee of TSOC to represent professionals from a broad array of backgrounds. The class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) were graded according to predefined scales as modified from the latest American and European guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension ( and ). Each member of the writing committee was assigned specific writing tasks, which were then reviewed and revised by three section coordinators. The text was developed over approximately 12 months, during which the Task Force members met collectively and communicate comprehensively between meetings. The TSOC/THS Guidelines undergo extensive review by the Task Force and external experts and are approved by all Task Force members. The guidelines and related works were developed independently without any involvement from the industry. The Task Force members’ comprehensive disclosure information is shown at the end of this Guideline. The TSOC/THS Hypertension Guidelines represent the official position of the TSOC and THS.\n\nTable 3\n\nLevel AData derived from multiple (≥ 2) RCTs, or meta-analyses of high-quality RCTsLevel BData derived from a single RCT, large non-randomized studies, meta-analyses of moderate-quality RCTs or non-randomized studiesLevel CSubgroup analyses, post-hoc analyses, retrospective studies, cohort studies, registries, small studies, or consensus of expert opinion\n\nAdherence to guidelines and related works can be improved by shared decision-making between healthcare professionals and patients, with patient engagement in choosing strategies based on individual preferences, values, and associated conditions. Guidelines and related works should not override clinical judgement, which is the right and responsibility of healthcare professionals. It is also the responsibility of healthcare professionals to verify the rules and regulations applicable to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.\n\n2. DEFINITION AND GRADING OF HYPERTENSION\n\nRecommendations/Keypoints\n\n• There are 4 established methods of BP measurement: routine office BP (ROBP) measurement, automated office BP (AOBP) measurement, home BP monitoring (HBPM) measurement, and ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) measurement.\n\n• BP readings obtained by AOBP, HBPM, and awake (daytime) ABPM are similar.\n\n• The vast majority of cardiovascular outcome trials were based on \"standardized\" office BP measurement, rather than ROBP, to adjust medications or treatment strategies.\n\n• HBPM is recommended as the foundation for the diagnosis and grading of hypertension, and also for the treatment thresholds and targets (COR I, LOE B).\n\n• A lower threshold (≥ 130/80 mmHg) for defining hypertension is recommended (COR I, LOE B).\n\n• All three cut-off values for grading, 120/80 mmHg, 130/80 mmHg, and 140/90 mmHg, are recommended for both home BP and office BP (if home BP not available) (COR I, LOE B).\n\n• 7-day HBPM should be considered as the best approach for diagnosing hypertension (COR IIa, LOE B).\n\n2.1 Comparisons of different blood pressure measurement methods\n\nThere are 4 established methods of BP measurement: routine office BP (ROBP) measurement, AOBP measurement, HBPM measurement, and ABPM measurement. The first 2 methods are performed in the clinic setting, while the latter 2 outside of clinics. ROBP was the most commonly performed and was less precise as only 1 or 2 BP measurements were usually obtained. There are many factors which could affect the accuracy of ROBP.15 One of the major concerns is the alerting response which causes the white-coat phenomena seen as white-coat hypertension in non-hypertensives and white-coat effect in known hypertensives.16 The accuracy of ROBP is a great concern in the crowded clinics in most regions in Taiwan. It should be emphasized that a vast majority of CV outcome trials were based on \"standardized\" office BP measurement, rather than ROBP, to adjust medications or treatment strategies. However, standardized office BP measurements are generally not applicable in busy clinics. Instructions regarding how to obtain standardized office BP are detailed in Section 3.1.\n\nAOBP improves some drawbacks of ROBP. Though AOBP is also performed in clinics, it requires automated oscillometric devices with multiple readings, an averaged reading that can be stored, and an attended or un-attended quiet environment.16 The recent SPRINT trial used AOBP to enroll and follow-up hypertensive patients, and used the readings of AOBP as BP targets.8 AOBP is difficult to apply to the clinic settings in Taiwan as most hospitals and clinics cannot afford extra isolated spaces.\n\nOut-of-office BP measurements include HBPM and ABPM. HBPM is referred to measurements of BP at home usually by oneself, or on occasion, by caregivers or research assistants.17 Compared to ROBP, HBPM is more likely to be free of environmental and/or emotional stress (such as white-coat effect).1 In the 2017 ACC/AHA Hypertension Guideline, the diagnosis of hypertension by ROBP should be confirmed by HBPM or ABPM18 HBPM is better than ROBP for the prediction of HMOD and CV outcomes.1 In a systematic review of 9 publications, HBPM was non-inferior to ABPM in predicting CV events and mortality.19 Four Asian studies have demonstrated that morning home BP is a better prognostic predictor of CV events than ROBP.20-23 The Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2014) recommended that a HBPM-guided approach was the most effective and practical approach in clinical practice.24 More importantly, HBPM is feasible and affordable in Taiwan. In the 2020 Consensus Statement of the Taiwan Hypertension Society and the Taiwan Society of Cardiology on Home Blood Pressure Monitoring for the Management of Arterial Hypertension, HBPM was recommended as an integral part in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in Taiwan.1\n\nABPM is the gold standard for diagnosing hypertension and assessing 24-hour BP and provides data on several important parameters that cannot be obtained using any other form of BP measurements.25 In addition, ABPM parameters provide better information on cardio- and cerebrovascular risk than ROBP. On the other hand, clinical studies and meta-analyses suggested that HBPM was as good as ABPM in their association with CV events or HMOD.26-28 Measurements with systolic and diastolic HBP for 1 week, compared with ROBP (3 visits) or ABPM, were more reliable and more strongly associated with left ventricular mass index, suggesting that 1 week of HBPM (7-day HBPM) may be the best approach for diagnosing hypertension.1,29 Compared with HBPM, ABPM is not tolerated by some patients, and the equipment is not widely available in Taiwan.\n\nThe SPRINT trial was a BP target-driven trial.8 AOBP was used in the SPRINT trial, in which attended- or unattended-AOBP showed similar BP values.30 In a cross-sectional study, BP measured with attended and unattended AOBP were similar to daytime BP from ABPM.31 Based on data from 14 studies involving 3,410 participants in different settings, an AOBP of 135/85 mmHg corresponded to 135/85 mmHg on awake ABPM.32 In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 31 articles comprising 9,279 participants, systolic BP readings from ROBP and systolic BP readings from research office BP measurement (standardized office BP) were substantially higher than systolic BP readings from AOBP, with pooled mean differences of 14.5 mmHg (p < 0.001) and 7.0 mmHg (p < 0.001), respectively.33 But systolic BP readings from AOBP were similar to systolic BP readings from awake (daytime) ABPM, with a pooled mean difference of only 0.3 mmHg.33 When HBPM was compared with awake ABPM by a dual-mode device, there was no significant difference between them (mean systolic BP difference 0.5 mmHg; mean diastolic BP difference 0.6 mmHg, both p value non-significant).34 Likewise, in a systematic review of 7,116 patients from 26 studies, no significant differences were found between AOBP, awake (daytime) ABPM, and HBPM.35 In a more recent analysis from 139 patients with hypertension, systolic BP measured with AOBP, HBPM, and awake ABPM were very similar (141.2 mmHg, 142.5 mmHg, and 142.1 mmHg, respectively) and much lower than ROBP (152.2 mmHg).36 We conclude that the BP readings obtained by AOBP, HBPM, and awake (daytime) ABPM are very similar. shows the corresponding values of systolic BP/diastolic BP for HBPM, ROBP, AOBP, awake (daytime) ABPM, asleep (nighttime) ABPM, and 24-hour ABPM.\n\nTable 4\n\nHBPMROBPAOBPAwake ABPMAsleep ABPM24-hour ABPM 120/80 120/80 120/80 120/80 100/65 115/75 130/80 130/80 130/80 130/80 110/65 125/75 135/85 140/90 135/85 135/85 120/79 130/80 145/90 160/90 145/90 145/90 140/85 145/90\n\n2.2 Definitions and grading of hypertension\n\nIn an Asian consensus document, morning BP from HBPM was recommended as the initial focus for the management of out-of-office BP in Asians.37 There are several reasons to support this recommendation. Both morning BP surges detected by ABPM and HBPM were predictors of CV endpoints independent of ROBP level in Asian hypertensive patients.38,39 Morning BP measured at home, compared with evening BP, provided better discrimination for stroke.21 The multicenter HOMED-BP study demonstrated the feasibility of adjusting antihypertensive drug treatment based on morning BP measured by HBPM in Japanese hypertensive patients.22 Based on the evidence from Asia and special consideration of appropriateness of different BP measurement methods in Taiwan, the Task Force recommends to use HBPM for the diagnosis and grading of hypertension, and also for the treatment thresholds and targets (COR I, LOE B).\n\nAccording to the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration, the risks of coronary heart disease and stroke were higher in Asians compared with Caucasians, with the same BP readings.6 The hazard ratio of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for people from Australia and New Zealand in the prehypertension range (SBP 120-139 mmHg), previously defined by JNC 7,40 was 1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-1.27) when compared with normal BP (SBP < 120 mmHg). The hazard ratio, however, increased to 1.55 (95% CI: 1.41-1.70) for Asian people with prehypertension,41 suggesting an increased CV risk in the BP range of 120-139 mmHg for Asian people. Similar finding was reported from Taiwan.42 Furthermore, people with a SBP of 130-139 mmHg had an increased risk of CV diseases, based on independent reports from China,43 Hong Kong,44 and South Korea.45 All these lines of evidence are corroborated by the recent Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients (STEP) trial.9 In this multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 8,511 Chinese patients 60 to 80 years of age with hypertension from both mainland China and Taiwan were assigned to a SBP target of 110 to < 130 mmHg (intensive-treatment) or a target of 130 to < 150 mmHg (standard-treatment). During a median follow-up period of 3.34 years, the primary outcome events occurred in 147 patients (3.5%) in the intensive-treatment group, as compared with 196 patients (4.6%) in the standard-treatment group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.92; p = 0.007). The relative risk reduction divided by the between-group SBP difference is 2.8%/mmHg (26%/9.2 mmHg), which is consistent with the more pronounced impact of hypertension in Asian populations. Therefore, to define SBP ≥ 140 mmHg as hypertension that was previously defined by most Hypertension Guidelines seems not that appropriate to address the risk of hypertension in Asians.10,11,13 A lower threshold (≥ 130/80 mmHg), such as that defined by 2017 ACC/AHA Hypertension Guideline, would be more appropriate for Asian patients.18\n\nIn a prospective nationwide study of 2,081 randomized subjects aged 45 to 74 years from Finland (Finn-Home Study), CV events increased with SBP above 130 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) above 80 mmHg with HBPM.46 In a population-based cohort study from the Korean National Health Insurance Service of 2,488,101 adults aged 20 through 39 years with a median follow-up of 10 years, men with baseline BP of 130-139/80-89 mmHg compared with those with BP < 120/80 mmHg had higher risk of CV diseases (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.21-1.28), coronary heart disease (aHR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.19-1.27), and stroke (aHR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.25-1.36).45 The corresponding aHRs for baseline BP of ≥ 140/90 mmHg, compared with those BP < 120/80, were 1.76, 1.68, and 1.99, respectively.45 Data for women showed similar trends.45 In the Finn-Home study, an increment of 10 mmHg in SBP and 5 mmHg in DBP with HBPM significantly increased CVD risk by 22% and 15%, respectively.46 In a systematic review and meta-analysis that included Asian data, an increment of 10 mmHg in SBP with HBPM significantly increased CV disease risk by 20%, CV death by 29%, and total death by 14%.47 The incremental impact of HBPM on CV events, as shown above, is almost equivalent to that of office BP on CV events observed in the meta-analysis of 344,716 individual participant-level office BP data from 48 randomized trials of antihypertensive treatment by the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists Collaboration.3 Taken together, the Task Force redefined hypertension by HBPM as shown in .\n\nTable 5\n\nBP categorySBP (mmHg)DBP (mmHg)Normal< 120and< 80Elevated120-129and< 80Hypertension Grade 1130-139or80-89 Grade 2≥ 140or≥ 90\n\nThe recommended BP cut-off values for grading of hypertension are traditionally based on office BP in all hypertension guidelines worldwide.10,11,13 In the 2022 Taiwan Hypertension Guideline, the Task Force recommends BP cut-off values based on HBPM for grading of hypertension. In , home BP values are equivalent to office BP values of ≤ 130/80 mmHg. Home BP value is 5 mmHg lower (135/85 mmHg) than office BP value of 140/90 mmHg. However, according to the 11-year follow-up data of 5,768 participants from the Dallas Heart Study, office SBP of 140 mmHg was equivalent to home SBP of 140 mmHg by outcome-derived approach and 135 mmHg by regression-based approach.48 Given that outcome-derived approach is of greater clinical significance, the Task Force recommends all three cut-off values for grading, 120/80 mmHg, 130/80 mmHg, and 140/90 mmHg, are identical for HBPM and office BP. The universal cut-off values should improve the implementation of guidelines in clinical practice.\n\n3. BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT, CENTRAL BLOOD PRESSURE, AND BLOOD PRESSURE VARIABILITY\n\nRecommendations/Keypoints\n\n• Periodic calibration of automated electronic sphygmomanometer should be performed at an interval not greater than 12 months (COR I, LOE C).\n\n• Key steps for proper BP measurements including preparation, the use of validated devices with appropriate-sized cuff, correct measurement process, and data recordings (COR I, LOE C).\n\n• Routine office BP should not be used for the diagnosis and management of hypertension, unless the recommended BP measurement protocol is followed (COR III, LOE C).\n\n• Home BP is one form of out-of-office BP; if measured correctly, can be used for diagnostic confirmation, identification of hypertension phenotypes (sustained hypertension, white-coat hypertension [effect], and masked [uncontrolled] hypertension), guidance of antihypertensive treatment, and improvement of hypertension control (COR I, LOE B).\n\n• Hypertension should be diagnosed if average home BP is ≥ 130/80 mmHg (the equivalent standardized office BP is ≥ 130/80 mmHg)(COR I, LOE B).\n\n• To implement HBPM in the diagnosis and management of hypertension, the Task Force recommends that HBPM should be conducted according to the \"722\" protocol. Home BP should be measured for \"7\" (at least 4) consecutive days, in the morning (within 1 hour after awakening, but before taking food and medications) and the evening (within 1 hour before bedtime) (\"2\" occasions), and with ≥ \"2\" (≥ 3, if atrial fibrillation) BP readings, 1-min apart, on each occasion (COR I, LOE B).\n\n• The measurement frequency, timing, and number per occasion of HBPM can be individualized to improve adherence and to establish the habit (COR IIa, LOE C).\n\n• Multiple (≥ 3) measurements on one occasion and use of a specially validated device are recommended to obtain reliable HBPM readings in patients with AF (COR I, LOE C).\n\n• If more than three BP readings are taken on one occasion, document the average of the two readings with the lowest SBP values to provide a more reliable BP estimate (COR I, LOE C).\n\n• ABPM parameters provide better information on cardio- and cerebrovascular risk than office BP (COR I, LOE B).\n\n• ABPM should be considered in all patients with elevated BP, particularly those with unstable office or home BP, or whom are suspected to have white-coat or masked hypertension, or progressive hypertension-mediated organ damage (COR IIa, LOE B).\n\n• Measurement of central BP with a cut-off value of 130/80 mmHg for diagnosing hypertension is recommended (COR IIb, LOE B).\n\n• BP variability (BPV) can be classified into short-term BPV (over 24 hours), mid-term (day-to-day), and long-term BPV (visit-to-visit) according to the length of BP recordings, which can be obtained by ABPM, HBPM, and office BP monitoring, respectively.\n\n• Increased BPV was associated with organ damage, stroke, cardiovascular events, and mortality independent of average BP.\n\n• Antihypertensive medications with longer duration of BP-lowering action could be considered to lower BPV (COR IIa, LOE B).\n\n• Given that atrial fibrillation may not be symptomatic and can influence the accuracy of BP measurement, the BP monitor with single-lead electrocardiogram is of clinical significance (COR I, LOE C).\n\n3.1 Devices for blood pressure measurement\n\nSince the early 20th century, BP could be measured by using the auscultatory approach with a stethoscope and a manual manometer through the recognition of Korotkoff sounds. Subsequently, oscillometric approach was developed in 1970 and has been widely utilized in automated BP monitoring. The mercury sphygmomanometer, once regarded as the gold standard technique, has been banned for production in Taiwan since 2021 due to the concern of environmental safety of mercury. However, the mercury sphygmomanometer is permitted to be used as a reference standard for the validation of new BP monitors and for research purposes. There are two common types of non-mercury sphygmomanometer, oscillometric and aneroid devices. The oscillometric devices are operated automatically with the inflation and deflation of the cuff being controlled electronically. Periodic calibration of automated electronic sphygmomanometer should be performed at an interval not greater than 12 months.49 Aneroid sphygmomanometer, operated manually with a pressure cuff and a stethoscope using auscultatory approach, is a liquid-free device alternative of mercury sphygmomanometer.32 Many devices have been developed based on the oscillometric technique to measure BP outside of physicians’ clinic, including ABPM or self-monitoring BP. The latter includes BP taken at home, HBPM, or in public settings, such as kiosks, pharmacy, grocery store, and in the community.\n\nThe appropriate management of hypertension depends on accurate BP measurements. Using conventional office BP in the management of hypertension is not reliable since its value could be heavily influenced in the busy and hurry clinical environment. In a previous systematic review, it has been demonstrated that the office BP in routine clinical practice is substantially higher than research office BP and awake (daytime) ambulatory BP.50 Therefore, it could be risky and imprudent to prescribe antihypertensive medications solely based on ROBP. Many alternative strategies have been proposed to replace conventional office BP to guide the management of hypertension.51-54 To obtain precise office BP or self-monitoring BP for making proper management of hypertension, accurate BP measurement is an indispensable first step.\n\n3.2 Standardized blood pressure measurement\n\nThe accuracy of both office55 BP and self-monitoring BP measurements can be improved by adhering to the key steps of proper BP measurements.11,15 These key steps include proper preparation, use of proper techniques and validated devices, taking proper measurements needed for diagnosis and treatment, and proper BP readings recording. We summarize these important steps in and and . Unless the recommended BP measurement protocol is followed, routine office BP should not be used for the diagnosis and management of hypertension (COR III, LOE C).\n\nTable 6\n\nStage 1: PreparationEmpty bowel and stomach.Before the measurement procedure, subjects should avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for at least 30 minutes.Sit calmly for at least 5 minutes and avoid talking during the rest period and the whole measurement process.Avoid conversation during the rest period and during the measurement.Remove clothing covering the location of cuff placement. Be sure to avoid rolling up sleeves; this may cause a (partial) tourniquet effect.Sit in a calm and comfortable place.Stage 2: Measurement equipment and positionUse validated BP devices and ensure that the device is calibrated at recommended intervals (at least every 12 months), and the device is better if equipped with capabilities of automatic data recording and/or auto-transmission.Obtain and record subject’s mid-arm circumference.Support the patient’s arm with resting on a desk.Position the middle of the cuff on the patient’s upper arm at the level of the right atrium (the midpoint of the sternum).Use the correct cuff size, following the manufacturer’s instructions (cuff bladder width and length are at least 40% and 80% of the mid-arm circumference, respectively).Sit for 5 minutes without talking or moving around prior to recording the first BP reading in a chair with their feet flat on the floor and back supported.Stage 3: BP measurement processIf BP is measured for the first time, check the BP in right and left upper arms. If the between-arm BP difference is < 15 mmHg, use the higher BP for further management.Position the center of the cuff over the upper arm brachial artery at least 2.5 cm (2 finger breadths) above the crease of the elbow.Separate repeated measurements by 1 minute.For an auscultatory determination of the BP level, inflate the cuff 20-30 mmHg above the estimated SBP assessed using the radial pulse obliteration method.Place the head of the stethoscope over the brachial artery for auscultatory determination.For auscultatory readings, deflate the cuff pressure 2 mmHg per second, and listen for Korotkoff sounds.To assess whether classic and delayed orthostatic hypotension are present, measure BP 1 and 3 minutes after assuming an upright posture, respectively.Stage 4: Documentation of accurate BP readingsRecord SBP, DBP, and heart rate for each measurement using auto-transmission, an app on a digital device, or recording sheet.Use an average of ≥ 2 readings for each measurement.If more than 3 readings are taken, document the average of the 2 readings with the lowest SBP values to provide a more reliable BP estimate.Use an average of ≥ 2 readings obtained on ≥ 2 occasions to estimate the BP.If using the auscultatory technique, record SBP as onset of the first of at least 2 consecutive beats and the last audible sound as DBP, Korotkoff phases 1 and 5, respectively. In cases where the sounds are audible at full deflation or until very low DBP levels (< 40 mmHg), then Korotkoff phase 4 (muffling of sounds) should be recorded and reported for DBP.If using the auscultatory approach, record SBP and DBP to the nearest even number.Provide information to help the patients interpret their BP values.\n\nTable 7\n\nThe “722” protocolTiming of HBP monitoring“7”7 (at least 4) consecutive days“2”2 occasions per day: in the morning (within 1 hour after awakening, after voiding, and before taking food and medications) and in the evening (within 1 hour before bedtime)“2”2 or more BP readings, 1 minute apart, taken per occasion (≥ 3 BP readings if atrial fibrillation)\n\nBP rangesFrequency of HBP monitoring with the “722” protocolNormal blood pressure (< 120/80 mmHg)Every 1 yearElevated blood pressure (120-129/< 80 mmHg)Every 6 monthsHypertension (≥ 130/80 mmHg) Treatment-naïveOne “722” cycle, for confirmation of the diagnosis and phenotype identification Initiation of drug therapy2 weeks later, then every 1 month if uncontrolled, or every 3 months if under control Adjustment of drug therapy2 weeks later, then every 1 month if uncontrolled, or every 3 months if under control Treated but uncontrolledEvery 1 month Treated and controlledEvery 3 months\n\n3.3 Blood pressure measurement in the clinic setting\n\nPrevious hypertension management guidelines and quality improvement programs have mostly relied on BP measured in the clinic setting. Screening for abnormal BP and monitoring the response to treatments are the main purposes of measuring BP in routine clinical practice (routine office BP). However, the measurement of BP has been recognized to be the single clinical procedure of greatest importance but performed in the sloppiest manner.56,57 Most of the clinical practice settings are faced with time constraints which inevitably affect the accuracy of BP measurements. Besides, training in BP measurement, equipment used, and measurement methods vary widely across clinics, and can deviate from methods recommended by guidelines substantially. The research office BP in clinical trials is obtained with standardized protocols to minimize systematic errors and variability for BP measurements. However, a substantial white-coat effect, the difference between office and out-of-office BP, can be observed with both research and routine office BP measurements.1 Subsequently, unattended AOBP has been developed and regarded as a successful strategy to eliminate the white-coat effects.58 It has been shown in a previous systematic review that there are large discrepancies between routine office BP, research office BP, and AOBP with the difference of around 7 mmHg between routine and research office BP and between research office BP and AOBP.33\n\nUnattended AOBP with its effect on eliminating white-coat effects was promoted by the Canadian hypertension guideline.59,60 There are 4 essential components for AOBP: electronic and automated device, multiple readings, averaged mean, unattended and undisturbed spaces (EMAU).50 Some studies have suggested that BP measured with staff present results in higher readings than those obtained with staff absent during measurements.61 However, whether the presence of staff would influence the accuracy of BP measurements has still been under debate.62,63 Recent publications claimed that the BP measurement technique used in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) was unattended.64 It was then clarified by the SPRINT researchers that the SPRINT protocol does not address the issue of attendance and similar BP levels and CV disease risk reduction were observed in the intensive group regardless of the measurement technique used being primarily attended or unattended.30 The average AOBP readings are shown to be comparable to the average awake ABPM reading and HBPM.33\n\n3.4 Blood pressure measurement outside the clinic setting\n\nBP measured in the clinic setting differs substantially from that obtained outside of the clinic setting.65-67 The prognostic value of out-of-office BP measurements has been shown to be superior to the traditional office BP.68 Therefore, it has been suggested out-of-office BP can be used to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and for the management of high BP.69 The comparisons between routine office BP, AOBP, HBPM, and ABPM are provided in .\n\nTable 8\n\nHome BPOffice BPAutomated office BPAmbulatory BPAdvantagesStronger predictor of CV events than office BP.BP measured in a clinical setting.Eliminate white-coat effect.Much stronger predictor of CV events than office BP.Provides a larger number of BP readings.Associated with CV outcomes.Associated with CV outcomes.Provides a larger number of BP readings during routine activities.Can be repeated more frequently than ABPM.Method used in large outcome trials (standardized/research office BP).Used in the SPRINT study.Identifies white-coat and masked hypertension.Identifies white-coat and masked hypertension.Identifies long-term visit-to-visit BP variability.Obtains 3-5 BP readings with each measurement.Discloses nocturnal hypertension and dipping patterns.Evaluates the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs at different times of the day and night, except sleep.Provides average awake (daytime), asleep (nighttime) and 24-hour values.Identifies mid-term day-to-day BP variability.Identifies short-term and 24-hour BP variability.High acceptance by patients.Evaluates the 24-hour efficacy of antihypertensive drugs.Relatively low cost.DisadvantagesPatient training required (simple for automated devices).Lacks nighttime recordings.Lacks nighttime recordings.Cost (reimbursement issue).Possible use of unvalidated devices.No diurnal patterns of BP can be assessed.No diurnal patterns of BP can be assessed.Limited availability.Lacks nighttime recordings.The accuracy of BP measurements hampered by time constraints in busy clinic conditions.Higher cost of validated BP monitoring and more space and time required.Patient discomfort.Patient may not correctly measure and report their BP.Less precise with one or two measurements at each clinic visit.Repeated measurements not likely in the short-term.Less useful for evaluating the efficacy of antihypertensive drugs.Requires two clinic visits to complete the test.\n\nAs recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force and American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), one of the major utilities of out-of-office BP is to identify hypertension phenotypes of white-coat and masked hypertension.69\n\n3.5 White-coat hypertension and masked hypertension\n\nBecause of the difference between office and out-of-office BP measurements, discrepancies in the diagnosis of hypertension arise when different criteria for hypertension based on different BP measurements are applied. Four BP phenotypes, normotension, white-coat hypertension, masked hypertension, and sustained hypertension, defined by the combination of hypertensive/non-hypertensive office and out-of-office BP are thus generated. In a previous study with 1,257 treatment-naïve subjects in Taiwan, the prevalence of white-coat hypertension among those with office SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg was 12.2%.70 In a sub-analysis of Taiwanese patients from the Asia BP at Home study, the prevalence of white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension were 21% and 11%, respectively, based on the diagnostic criteria of office and home BP of 130/80 mmHg.71 It has long been recognized that subjects with masked hypertension carry a comparable CV risk to those with sustained hypertension. Inconsistent evidence exists on whether white-coat hypertension is associated with a substantially increased risk for CVD compared with normotension.72-74 A previous community cohort study conducted in Kinmen suggested that the white-coat effect is mainly caused by arterial aging, and white-coat hypertension carries a higher risk for CV mortality compared to prehypertensive subjects.70 Besides, white-coat hypertension is also associated with a higher incidence of sustained hypertension versus normotension.75,76 A recent systematic review concluded that untreated white-coat hypertension, but not treated white-coat effect, is associated with an increased risk for CV events and all-cause mortality.77\n\nIt was shown that the prevalence of masked hypertension was higher in subjects with prehypertension vs. normal office BP,78 and office BP in the upper prehypertensive range can help predict masked hypertension.79 The prevalence of masked hypertension was also higher in patients with diabetes,80,81 and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.82 As shown in an international cohort study, the proportion of masked uncontrolled hypertension in all hypertensives is not small (15.9% among treated subjects),74 suggesting that out-of-office BP should be considered in all hypertensive subjects.\n\n3.6 Home blood pressure measurement\n\nAccumulating evidence has demonstrated the relationship of HBPM with HMOD26,83,84 and CV outcomes.21,39,46,74,85-89 In previous systematic reviews, the prognostic value of HBPM was comparable to that of ABPM.19,27 Compared with office BP or 24-h ABPM, HBPM with one-week measurements was more reliable and more strongly associated with left ventricular mass index, suggesting that 7-day HBPM may be the best approach for diagnosing hypertension.29 Besides, with adequate feedback and intervention, HBPM can provide a better guiding strategy than conventional office BP.90 A better acceptability of 7-day HBPM over 24-hr ABPM was shown in a study surveying the preference.34 Morning and evening BP measured with HBPM were both able to predict future CV events.21,23,39 Asian populations have distinct presentations of hypertension and related CV disease from Westerners.37 For example, Asian patients have a higher rate of stroke and metabolic syndrome, which is often associated with higher morning and nighttime (asleep) BP reading.91 Recently, an innovative automated HBPM device has been developed for measuring nighttime BP.92 Its clinical applications await further verification.\n\nHBPM can provide multiple measurements over longer periods and identify day-to-day BP variability. With the ability to detect morning and masked hypertension and a better tolerability than ABPM for long-term use, HBPM can therefore be considered as a strategy of choice to replace office BP monitoring for the diagnosis and treatment for hypertensive subjects.\n\nTo facilitate the application of HBPM in routine clinical practice, the Taiwan Hypertension Society and the Taiwan Society of Cardiology jointly put forward the consensus recommendations according to up-to-date scientific evidence and recommend the \"722\" protocol for HBPM measurement ( ), thus standardizing the ways to integrate HBPM in the diagnosis and management of hypertension.1\n\nThe proprietary algorithms for BP estimation vary considerably in oscillometric BP devices. Clinicians should recommend the use of BP monitoring devices which have been validated. Various societies and organizations have proposed different validation protocols for BP monitors.32 There are resources on the web that list validated BP monitors such as https://bihsoc.org/bp-monitors/provided by the British and Irish Hypertension Society and https://stridebp.org/ by the Stride BP.\n\n3.6.1 Measurement frequency, timing, and number per occasion of home blood pressure monitoring\n\nTo determine the timing and number per occasion for BP measurement, the measurement protocols for HBPM in several clinical studies could be referenced.1,93,94 Basically, the more BP measurements taken, HBPM readings are more precise and reliable but at the expense of time consumed. Most clinical studies derived HBPM readings from the averages of morning and evening measurements together. Superior prognostic ability by averaging home BP of 14 measurements was demonstrated in the Ohasama study.86 Although the measurement protocols varied substantially between studies, a reliable diagnosis of hypertension can be made by means of at least 6 readings during 6 days, after excluding readings obtained on the first day.29,53,95-98\n\nTaking the above evidence into considerations, the Task Force recommends that HBPM should be measured according to the \"722\" protocol for hypertension diagnosis and home BP-guided antihypertensive management ( ). The \"722\" protocol indicates that home BP should be measured for \"7\" (at least 4) consecutive days, in the morning (within 1 hour after awakening, but before taking food and medications) and the evening (within 1 hour before bedtime) (\"2\" occasions), and with ≥ \"2\" (≥ 3, if atrial fibrillation) BP readings, 1-min apart, on each occasion. Morning and evening home BP estimates are the averages of all morning and evening BP readings, respectively, except those obtained on the first day. The measurement frequency, timing, and number per occasion can be individualized to improve adherence and to establish the measurement habit.\n\n3.7 Use of oscillometric blood pressure devices in patients with atrial fibrillation\n\nThe most prevalent cardiac arrhythmias in adults is atrial fibrillation (AF), in which hypertension is the most common comorbidity.99 According to the reimbursement database in Taiwan, the proportions of hypertensive subjects increased with CHA2DS2-VASc score (43.2%, 78.4%, 87%, 89.9% in score 1, 2, 3, and ≥ 4, respectively).100 Uncontrolled hypertension predisposes AF patients toward increased risk of stroke,101 which renders the detection and management of hypertension an utmost importance in AF patients.\n\nThe current automated BP monitors utilize oscillometric pressure wave amplitude during cuff deflation or inflation to determine SBP and DBP.102 The irregular R-R interval in AF results in less accurate BP values in these patients. How to measure BP in AF patients accurately remains challenging. It has been shown that increasing the number of consecutive measurements to ≥ 3 can achieve a better correlation of BP obtained from the noninvasive method and invasive BP measurements.103 Since the validation studies conducted in general population might not be applicable to AF patients, ANSI/AAMI/ISO currently considers patients with AF as a special population and requires additional validation studies. BP monitoring which has been validated specifically in AF patients should be recommend for HBPM in this special population.104\n\nA progress in BP monitors is to combine with other diagnostic modalities, for example, single-lead electrocardiogram.105 The device can simultaneously monitor electrocardiogram and obtain BP readings. The sensitivity of atrial fibrillation detection was approximately 100% compared to 12-lead electrocardiogram. Given that atrial fibrillation might not be symptomatic and could influence the accuracy of BP measurement, this device is of clinical significance.\n\n3.8 Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring\n\nABPM is generally considered the gold standard for diagnosing hypertension. ABPM can assess 24-hour BP profiles to derive several important parameters that cannot be obtained using any other form of BP measurement. In addition, ABPM parameters provide better information on cardio- and cerebrovascular risk than office BP.106,107 ABPM should be considered in all patients with elevated BP, particularly those with unstable office or home BP, or whom are suspected to have white-coat or masked hypertension, or progressive HMOD.37 ABPM needs to be performed using a validated device with good practice techniques, and has a role both in hypertension diagnosis and in monitoring the response to antihypertensive therapy to ensure strict BP control throughout the 24-hour period.25\n\nThe ABPM devices are typically programmed to take BP measurements every 15 to 30 minutes in the daytime and 30-60 minutes at night. ABPM could provide many important information, that includes details of all BP readings showing daytime and nighttime windows with an indication of normal BP, average SBP, average DBP, and heart rate, the percentage change in SBP and DBP at night, and summary statistics for time-weighted average SBP, DBP, and pulse rate for the 24-hour period, daytime, and nighttime, with standard deviations and number of valid BP readings.25 It has been shown that nocturnal (asleep) BP is the most reproducible and reliable ABPM parameter for risk stratification.108,109 Nocturnal hypertension could indicate the presence of comorbidities such as obstructive sleep apnea, and the riser pattern of nighttime BP is associated with a particularly poor prognosis with respect to the occurrence of stroke and cardiac events.110,111 In addition, morning hypertension defined as elevation of averaged BP over the 2 hours after awakening was associated with higher risk of stroke.112 Both HBPM and ABPM could be used to identify morning hypertension.113\n\n3.8.1 Emerging alternative approaches to blood pressure assessment in an ambulatory setting\n\nThe BP measurement arena has been greatly expanded with the upsurge in numbers of iPhone and Android apps. Many apps use a combination of finger plethysmography and pulse transit time calculations to estimate BP.119 Non-invasive BP monitors should be approved by the regulatory agency (for example, the Taiwan FDA or FDA) because they are classified as moderate risk medical devices. Some wearable cuffless BP monitors may be accurate if used exactly as directed.120,121 Until more studies investigating the role of wearable BP monitors in clinical practice available, the Task Force recommends using a HBPM device that measures upper-arm BP instead of wrist or finger BP monitors.1,15\n\n3.9 Central blood pressure\n\nIt has long been observed that BP levels increase from the central aorta to the peripheral arteries due to the well-recognized BP amplification phenomenon.122 The major determinants of central BP are increased arterial stiffness and wave reflections, which are also the dominant hemodynamic manifestations of vascular aging. However, all BP measuring modalities, including office BP measurement, HBPM, and ABPM, use recordings from the brachial arteries or wrist, which may be different from the central BP measured in the ascending aorta or carotid arteries. A previous cohort study in Taiwan and a meta-analysis suggested that central BP may be more relevant than peripheral BP in predicting HMOD and CV outcomes.123,124 Central and peripheral BP respond differently to antihypertensive medications as shown in previous s randomized controlled trials. The individual discrepancies between central BP and peripheral BP may be substantial and are highly variable, which may be magnified during hemodynamic changes or after pharmacological interventions.125,126 Changes of HMOD indices after antihypertensive medications are more closely related to changes in central BP than peripheral BP.127 Therefore, BP measurements in the peripheral arteries cannot serve as a direct substitute for their central counterpart.128,129 Currently, one can obtain non-invasive central BP with either tonometry-based or cuff-based techniques.128 A previous Taiwan study derived and validated the diagnostic threshold using an outcome-derived approach.130 Recent studies suggested that, as compared with the conventional strategy, it may be more cost-effective to central BP to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension,131 which may cause lesser use of medications to achieve BP control.132\n\nWith the available central BP devices burgeoning, a validation standard has been proposed which further classifies central BP devices into two types.133 According to whether BP amplification is preserved, some devices give an estimate of central BP relative to measured brachial BP (type I), while others estimate the intra-arterial central BP (type II). A previous study based on data from the 2013-2016 National Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan revealed similar central and brachial SBP and DBP levels.134 Therefore, the same BP threshold as that of HBPM and office BP is recommended for central BP.135 In 2019, to facilitate the clinical application of central BP in the management of hypertension, the THS and TSOC jointly put forward a consensus document on the Clinical Application of Central BP in the Management of Hypertension.128 More clinical trials are required to investigate the comparative effectiveness between these readily available BP monitoring strategies to inform clinical practice decisions.125,136\n\n3.10 Blood pressure variability\n\nBP fluctuations, also coined as BP variability (BPV), constitute a complex phenomenon. BPV has usually been considered a physiological indicator in response to internal and external stimulations.137 It can also be used as a risk predictor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with hypertension and CV diseases, and an index for evaluating the efficacy of antihypertensive medications.138\n\nBPV comprises a range of estimation of the variations in SBP, DBP, or pulse pressure measured within different time frames (e.g., very short-term, short-term, mid-term and long-term) using different methods of measurement (e.g., beat-to-beat, ambulatory, day-to-day, and visit-to-visit BP measurements) and characterized by different patterns (e.g., nocturnal, postural, and postprandial).138 Different statistical indices (e.g., standard deviation, coefficient of variation, variation independent of the mean) were calculated to estimate the fluctuations of BP. In practice, BPV can be classified into short-term (over 24 hours), mid-term (day-to-day), and long-term BPV (visit-to-visit) according to the length of BP recordings, which can be obtained by ABPM, HBPM, and office BP monitoring, respectively.91,137\n\nIncreased BPV has been associated with HMOD, stroke, CV events, and mortality even after adjusting for average BP, indicating its independent role as a vascular risk factor.139-144 Recently, the association between BPV and the risk of dementia has also been suggested.145\n\nAs shown in a previous study in Taiwan, pressure wave reflection was the major hemodynamic determinant of short-term BPV.146 Different antihypertensive medications might exert variable effects on BPV.147 It has been shown that calcium-channel blocker-based regimen was associated with lower BPV and a lower incidence of stroke than a beta-blocker-based regimen. Among different classes of antihypertensive medications, the one with longer biological half-lives and potentially longer duration of BP-lowering action was considered to lower BPV.148,149 In a recent community study in Taiwan, subjects who had a stable and frequent BP measuring pattern were shown to have a significantly lower BPV.150 In addition, combined DASH diet and low sodium intake can not only lower BP but also reduce BPV.151\n\n4. EVALUATION\n\nRecommendations/Keypoints\n\n• The purposes of physical examination include establishing the diagnosis and determining the severity of hypertension, searching for signs of secondary hypertension and HMOD, and assessing global cardiovascular risk.\n\n• Serial assessment of HMOD to monitor regression determines the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment.\n\n4.1 Medical history\n\nA complete medical history should be taken during the first visit for patients with high BP. The information of interest to clinicians is related to treatment threshold, BP targets, and choice of management strategy. Medical history includes:\n\n– Blood pressure pattern: previous BP levels, hypertension onset time, duration, anti-hypertensive medication use, including effectiveness and intolerance, and adherence to antihypertensive treatment.\n\n– Previous atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) and associated risk factors: coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke or transient ischemic attack, diabetes, dyslipidemia, heart failure, renal disease, peripheral artery disease, and sleep disorder such as snoring and sleep apnea. Family history of hypertension and premature CVD should also be inquired.\n\n– Personal history: dietary habit, salt intake, alcohol intake, smoking history, physical activity, exercise habit and personality/psychological state.\n\n– Previous drug history: anti-hypertensive drugs, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, steroids, oral contraceptives, antimigraine medications, antidepressants, cold remedies (containing liquorice or sympathomimetics like pseudoephedrine), herbal medication (such as ma-huang), cocaine, amphetamines, recombinant human erythropoietin, calcineurin inhibitor, systemic or intra-vitreal use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibody (bevacizumab), and certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, sorafenib, and pazopanib).\n\n– Others: symptoms and signs of hypertension, features favoring secondary hypertension, and possible symptoms of HMOD.\n\n4.2 Physical examination\n\nPhysical examination plays an essential role in the assessment of hypertensive patients. The purposes of physical examination include establishing the diagnosis and determining the severity of hypertension, searching for signs of secondary hypertension and HMOD, and assessing global CV risk.152 Initially, BP should be measured correctly. Comprehensive physical examination should include the followings: 1) calculation of body mass index; 2) inspection of Cushingoid appearance including moon face, buffalo hump, truncal obesity, and wide purple striae and acromegaly appearance including abnormal enlargement of peripheral limbs and forehead protrusion; 3) evaluation of optic fundi for hypertensive retinopathy with fundoscopy or fundus camera; 4) palpation of the thyroid gland for goiter; 5) auscultation of carotid, abdominal and femoral bruits for renovascular disease and peripheral artery disease; 6) auscultation over the back for a loud murmur suggesting coarctation of aorta; 7) comprehensive examination of the heart and lungs for left ventricular hypertrophy, and ventricular gallop of congestive heart failure; 8) examination of the abdomen for enlarged kidneys, masses, and pulsation of abdominal aorta; 9) palpation of the lower extremities for edema and pulses; and 10) a complete neurological assessment.152 The aforementioned evaluation should be adapted according to the severity of hypertension and clinical situations.\n\n4.3 Laboratory tests\n\nLaboratory tests aim to search for additional risk factors, provide evidence of secondary hypertension, and look for HMOD ( ).153 A more detailed diagnostic work-up should be performed in younger patients, patients with very high BP, and patients with HMOD. Routine tests should be considered in every patient at the first visit. Recommended studies are optional ( ). Measurement of urinary albumin excretion or albumin/creatinine ratio is strongly recommended in Taiwan, a country with the highest prevalence of end-stage renal disease in the world.154 High-sensitivity C-reactive protein predicts the incidence of CV events and optimizes the use of statins in hypertensive patients who have a high CV risk.155\n\nTable 9\n\nLaboratory testsRoutine tests Hemoglobin and hematocrit Serum creatinine with estimated creatinine clearance (Cockroft-Gault formula) or glomerular filtration rate (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) Serum sodium, potassium and calcium Fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides Serum uric acid Urinalysis Electrocardiogram Chest X-rayRecommended tests High-sensitivity C-reactive protein Quantitative microalbuminuria/proteinuria Fundoscopy or fundus camera Echocardiography Carotid ultrasound Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring Ankle-brachial index Pulse wave velocityExtended evaluations (domain of the specialist) Further investigations for cerebral, cardiac, renal and vascular damage: mandatory for complicated hypertension Search for secondary hypertension when suggested by history, physical examination or routine tests: measurement of renin, aldosterone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, corticosteroids, catecholamines in plasma and/or urine; angiographies; renal and adrenal ultrasound; computed tomography; magnetic resonance imaging\n\n4.4 Hypertension-mediated organ damage\n\nHMOD is defined by the presence of the structural or functional changes of end organ system caused by elevated BP.1 The end organs include the brain, the eyes, the heart, the kidneys and the blood vessels. The existence of HMOD hallmarks the poor control of hypertension and is associated with increased CV risk and mortality.156 The detection of HMOD can reclassify the Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) risk stratification for the hypertensive patients with low to moderate CV risks and help to select the appropriate drug class with benefit to specific HMOD.157,158 The prevention of HMOD should be a treatment target and a surrogate clinical marker of adequate BP control. Some types of HMOD can be reversed if BP has been treated early and/or aggressively. HMOD can become irreversible if it is caused by long-standing severe hypertension.159,160 Basic HMOD screening is recommended in all hypertensive patients during first visit and further detailed evaluation is required if necessary. Serial assessment of HMOD to monitor regression determines the efficacy of treatment. The various types of HMOD and related screening test are summarized in .\n\nTable 10\n\nOrganHMODScreening testIndication and interpretationBrainStroke (ischemia/hemorrhage)Brain imagingTo detect brain infarction, microbleeds and white matter lesions in hypertensive patients with neurological symptoms.Transient ischemic attackEarly subclinical changes can be identified by MRI with the highest sensitivity, but routine MRI is not recommended due to costs, and should be evaluated by a specialist.Cognitive impairmentCognitive function testingTo assess cognition in hypertensive patients with symptoms suggestive of cognitive decline.EyesHypertensive retinopathyFundoscopy or fundus cameraTo detect hypertensive retinopathy (retinal changes, hemorrhages, microaneurysms, hard exudates, cotton wool spots, papilledema, tortuosity and nipping), especially in hypertensive urgencies and emergencies.HeartLVHECGTo screen for LVH, atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease and other possible abnormalities, and to record baseline heart rate and rhythm.Atrial fibrillationThe sensitivity of ECG is limited and requires further echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis.Heart failureEchocardiographyTo evaluate cardiac structure and function (ventricular geometry, systolic and diastolic function, left atrial size, aortic root dimensions and subclinical systolic function impairment assessed by myocardial strain).KidneyChronic kidney diseaseeGFRTo evaluate kidney function and detect renal disease.Proteinuria/albuminuriaProteinuriaTo assess albumin excretion in possible renal disease, the most commonly used tool is UACR in early morning spot urine.Blood vesselsCarotid atherosclerosisCarotid ultrasoundTo determine the carotid plaque burden (atherosclerosis), stenosis and IMT, especially in hypertensive patients with cerebrovascular disease.Aortic stiffnessAortic aneurysmPeripheral artery diseaseAbdominal ultrasoundEvaluate abdominal aorta for the presence of aneurysmal dilatation and vascular disease.To evaluate renal size and structure in patients with chronic kidney disease.

ARR is the ratio of plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity. The most commonly recommended cutoff value of ARR is 30 (or 35) ng/dl per ng/ml/h. The plasma aldosterone concentration of > 10 ng/dL is necessary for positive interpretation of ARR.\n\n5.1 Overview\n\nSecondary hypertension, defined as elevated systemic arterial BP due to an identifiable cause in hypertensive patients.161,162 Patients with secondary hypertension can be cured or experience a marked improvement in BP control, with reduction in CV risk, if a specific cause of hypertension can be correctly diagnosed and treated. All newly diagnosed hypertensive patients with high risk features should be screened for secondary hypertension especially before initiation of treatment.\n\nThe prevalence of secondary hypertension varies among selected populations and clinical studies according to age and other clinical conditions such as hypertensive severity, duration, or status of control. Hypertension with secondary causes can co-exist with primary hypertension, in which residual hypertension often remains after those pathogenetic causes are identified and removed.163 The overall prevalence of secondary hypertension is around 10% in hypertensive patients,164 while in patients with resistant hypertension, the prevalence of secondary hypertension is significantly higher (up to 20 to 35%).165,166 Prevalence also varies by the secondary causes. Simplified classification into common causes and uncommon causes is utilized by guidelines with cut-off value of 1% ( ).162\n\nSecondary hypertension can manifest with 1) severe elevation of BP, i.e., accelerated or malignant hypertension, 2) pharmacologically resistant or induced hypertension, 3) abrupt onset of hypertension, 4) exacerbation of previously controlled hypertension, 5) onset of diastolic hypertension in older adults (age ≥ 65 years), 6) HMOD disproportionate to the duration or severity of hypertension, 7) hypertension manifesting at a younger age (age < 30 years, although it is not uncommon for primary hypertension), and 8) hypertension with clinical findings that suggest a specific disorder (unprovoked or excessive hypokalemia).\n\nA carefully evaluation of secondary hypertension is crucial, especially in those with a treatable cause, such as primary aldosteronism, drug or alcohol-induced hypertension, renal artery stenosis, obstructive sleep apnea, or the other endocrine hypertension. The detailed list of clinical indications and diagnostic screening tests for secondary hypertension is shown in and the list of drugs that can induce secondary hypertension is shown in . The algorithm of screening for secondary hypertension is shown in .\n\nTable 12\n\nAlcoholAmphetamines (eg, amphetamine, methylphenidate dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamine)Angiogenesis inhibitor (eg, bevacizumab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, sunitinib, sorafenib)Antidepressants (eg, MAOIs, SNRIs, TCAs)Atypical antipsychotics (eg, clozapine, olanzapine)CaffeineDecongestants (eg, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine)ErythropoietinHerbal supplements (eg, Ma Huang [ephedra], St. John’s wort [with MAOIs, yohimbine])Immunosuppressants (eg, cyclosporine, tacrolimus)Oral contraceptivesNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsRecreational drugs (eg, “bath salts” [MDPV], cocaine, methamphetamine, etc.)Systemic corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone, ﬂudrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisone, prednisolone)\n\n5.2 Primary aldosteronism\n\nPrimary aldosteronism (PA) is a state of autonomous aldosterone secretion which is unresponsive to renin regulation, resulting in hypertension and electrolyte imbalance. The prevalence of PA ranges from 4% to 20% in hypertensive patients.162,167-169 There are several subtypes of aldosteronism, including bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH), aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), and familial hyperaldosteronism type I (also named as glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, GRA), type II or type III. The first two subtypes, APA and BAH, account for near 90% of the PA cases. Elevated aldosterone exerts effects on many organs and systems. Compared with patients with essential hypertension, PA patients have increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, arterial stiffness, and worse diastolic dysfunction.170-177 PA patients have higher prevalence of stroke, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure compared with essential hypertensive patients independent of BP levels.175,178-181 In addition to its detrimental effects on CV system, PA also contributes to metabolic syndrome, renal disease and bone metabolism.182-185 Adrenalectomy can potentially cure APA,174,186 reverse CV remodeling,170,176,187-190 and improved long-term all-cause outcomes.191,192 Timely detection of PA is crucial. Members from the Taiwan Society of Aldosteronism and Taiwan Primary Aldosteronism Investigator (TAIPAI) study group had published consensus documents on case detection/diagnosis193 and treatment of PA.194\n\n5.2.1 Screening\n\nHypertension and hypokalemia are the typical characteristics of PA. In adults with resistant hypertension, hypokalemia, adrenal mass, young stroke or family history of early-onset hypertension,162 evaluation of PA is suggested. Nevertheless, hypokalemia is not as common as previously recognized,195 and is only identified in approximately 50% of cases.192,196 Normotension may occasionally be found in patients with documented PA. Hence, normokalemia and normotension may not exclude a diagnosis of PA.197 The presence of clinical characteristics listed in is recommended to receive screening for PA.\n\nTable 13\n\n1. Persistent systolic/diastolic blood pressure > 150/110 mmHg2. Resistant hypertension3. Hypertension with spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia4. Hypertension with adrenal mass5. Early-onset hypertension (< 30 years old) or a family history of early-onset hypertension6. Cerebral vascular accident at a younger age (< 40 years old)7. Hypertension with first-degree relatives with primary aldosteronism\n\nPlasma aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) is currently the most feasible screening method for PA. ARR is the ratio of plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA). ARR is most sensitive when samples from patients are collected in the morning. The recommended cutoff value of ARR varies among study groups and societies, ranging from 20-40 ng/dl per ng/ ml/h, with 30 ng/dl per ng/ml/h the most commonly used cutoff value.168 In Taiwan, the TAIPAI study group proposes a cutoff value of 35 ng/dl per ng/ml/h to meet higher specificity.193,198 The major drawback of ARR is that it can be influenced by the presence of very low renin levels with normal or even low plasma aldosterone concentration. Therefore, the plasma aldosterone concentration above 10 ng/dL is necessary for positive interpretation.195,199 Direct renin concentration (DRC) is also widely used instead of PRA. Because the heterogeneity of assay methods for measuring both PRA, DRC and PAC, various cut-off points were used in different centers.\n\nInterpretation of ARR should be cautious for various factors interfering the ARR level. Anti-hypertensive medications have different effects on ARR:168 β-adrenergic blockers, direct renin inhibitor and central α-2 agonist would lower the renin level more than aldosterone, resulting a false positive ARR; whereas dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers,200 diuretics including mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)201 cause a false negative ARR. Therefore, these antihypertensive medications with effects on ARR should be discontinued at least 2-4 weeks before ARR testing (4-6 weeks for MRAs).201,202 Besides, NSAIDs and contraceptives may result in a false positive ARR.203 Hypokalemia and sodium restriction status also cause falsely low ARR. Switching to non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, hydralazine, and α1-adrenergic blocker is recommended to maintain adequate BP control in patients undergoing PA screening and confirmation tests.\n\n5.2.2 Confirmation\n\nFor patients with screening positive ARR, at least one or more confirmatory tests are indicated to avoid a false positive result. However, in patients with spontaneous hypokalemia combined with PRA below assay detection limits and PAC > 20 ng/dL, confirmation test may not be needed ( ).168 There are four tests currently recommended by the Endocrine Society:168 1) saline infusion test (SIT) in recumbent position; 2) captopril challenge test (CCT); 3) fludrocortisone suppression test, and 4) oral sodium loading test (SLT). The first two, SIT and CCT, are the most widely used168 and with similar accuracy.198,204 Currently, there is no conclusive evidence to recommend one test over the others. In clinical practice, the choice of confirmatory test depends on the considerations of laboratory routine, local expertise, patient compliance, and cost. Recently, Stowasser et al. showed higher sensitivity of seated SIT than traditional recumbent saline infusion test.205 However, there is wide variability in both confirmatory test choice and its cut-off values between centers.204\n\n5.2.3 Lateralization\n\nDistinguishing between unilateral and bilateral disease is important because unilateral adrenalectomy is treatment of choice for unilateral PA. Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) is the recommended test for lateralization. 131I-6β-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59) scintigraphy is a reasonable substitution.193\n\nAbdominal CT is the initial tool for evaluation and to exclude large tumors (> 3 cm in most cases), which may be suspected as adrenocortical carcinoma. However, the evaluation for lateralization of PA by CT is unreliable.206 For example, microadenoma is unlikely to be visualized in CT which may mis-diagnose bilateral PA as unilateral PA. In addition, nonfunctioning incidentaloma, which is not uncommon, is possibly to be interpreted as bilateral PA.207 However, for patients who are younger than 35-year-old with high probability of APA, including recent-onset typical PA presentations (marked PAC overproduction and spontaneous hypokalemia) and imaging evidence of unilateral adrenal nodule (≥ 1 cm), lateralization may not be necessary.208\n\nAVS is the gold standard to distinguish unilateral from bilateral PA.168 AVS is indicated for patients who are going to undergo surgery to avoid unnecessary adrenalectomy. AVS can help physicians to distinguish which side to undergo adrenalectomy, especially in patients with bilateral adrenal adenoma, or with positive ARR but negative CT finding, or with inconclusive NP-59 scintigraphy results. Adrenal scintigraphy using 131I-labled cholesterol analog, such as NP-59, which is uptaken by adrenal cortex in proportion to the degree of hyper-function, is indicated when AVS is not available, contraindicated, or inconclusive compared with CT or MRI results. Although NP-59 scintigraphy is not used in the United States, it is till frequently used in Asia and Europe.209\n\n5.2.4 Treatment\n\nThe treatment strategy is based on the lateralization result.193 Surgical treatment is recommended for lateralized PA and medical treatment is suggested for non-lateralized PA, PA patients of high surgical risk or no desire for operation.194 Both strategies could improve the outcomes of PA patients. An analysis of Taiwan National Health Insurance data suggested a reduced hazard ratio in all-cause mortality or mortality plus new-onset atrial fibrillation in PA patients receiving adrenalectomy but not MRA treatment.210 However, whether operation leads to a better long-term outcome than MRA treatment is still controversial.191,211,212\n\nLaparoscopic adrenalectomy is the gold standard treatment for unilateral PA. It reduces long-term all-cause mortality independent of the effects on hypertension.191 By the Primary Aldosterone Surgical Outcome (PASO) study, the results of adrenalectomy to unilateral PA could be classified into 6 categories: complete, partial, and absent success of clinical and biochemical outcomes.213 In PASO, female and younger PA patients had higher likelihood of complete clinical success or clinical benefits (complete plus partial clinical success). Those with more pre-operative antihypertensive medications were less likely to have complete clinical success. In researches from the TAIPAI study group, patients with APA would have decreased long-term mortality,191 renal function progression,214 stroke risk,215 new onset-heart failure216 and atrial fibrillation,210 improved LV diastolic dysfunction,176 and reversed myocardial fibrosis,192 arterial wall thickness190 and stiffness190,217 after adrenalectomy.\n\nMRA is the drug of choice to treat non-lateralized PA or for those with no desire for surgery. Spironolactone is the first-line medication effective in blocking the influences from excessive secretion of aldosterone. However, it lacks specificity while might also work as androgen receptor antagonist and result in gynecomastia and impotence in men.218 It would also act as progesterone receptor agonist and cause amenorrhea in pre-menopausal women.219 Eplerenone is a second generation MRA much more selective to mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) than spironolactone, with potent BP lowering and aldosterone blocking effects.220 Finerenone is a novel non-steroid MRA that could have both high potency and high MR selectivity. Compared with spironolactone, it has a lower risk for hyperkalemia.219 However, its clinical role is still under investigation in clinical trials.219,221\n\n5.3 Renal parenchymal disease\n\nRenal parenchymal disease is the one of the leading causes of secondary hypertension in adult hypertensive patients.161,163 Bilateral abdominal masses palpated during physical examination warrant survey of polycystic kidney disease. Serum creatinine concentration and urinalysis (protein, erythrocytes, and leukocytes) are the best screening tests for renal parenchymal disease.161-163 Renal ultrasound evaluation of kidney morphology and identification of abnormal masses or urinary tract pathology can further provide clues about etiology and pathogenesis.161-163 Other tests to evaluate causes of renal disease would be indicated if specific renal disease suspected.\n\n5.4 Renovascular disease and renal artery stenosis\n\nRenal artery stenosis (RAS) results from narrowing of renal artery causing restricted kidney blood perfusion. The most common cause of RAS in adult patients is atherosclerotic disease. Nonatherosclerotic disease such as fibromuscular dysplasia is the most common cause of RAS in young adults.162\n\nClinical conditions suggesting RAS include abdominal bruits, signs and symptoms of peripheral vascular disease, and multiple risk factors contributing to generalized atherosclerosis. Resistant hypertension, recent onset or progression of severe hypertension, recent renal function deterioration, acute renal function deterioration after ACE inhibitors or ARB usage, and flash pulmonary edema are other clinical clues pointing to RAS.163 RAS could be screened with renal duplex and doppler ultrasound, abdominal MRA or CT, and further confirmatory tests.161-163\n\nCurrent guidelines recommend medical therapy optimization for hypertension and risk factor control for adults with atherosclerotic RAS because prior studies failed to show clinical advantages with endovascular intervention.162,222 Revascularization with angioplasty or stenting may be considered only if failed medically controlled atherosclerotic RAS (refractory hypertension, worsening renal function, and/or intractable heart failure). Revascularization with angioplasty (but not stenting) was effective in patients with nonatherosclerotic RAS due to fibromuscular dysplasia.\n\n5.5 Obstructive sleep apnea\n\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is caused by recurrent and intermittent upper airway collapse during sleep, inducing apnea or hypopnea, hypoxemia, and sleep disruption. This chronic medical condition correlates with other systemic diseases and presents as a strong risk factor for including hypertension, coronary and cerebrovascular diseases, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.223-226 OSA is highly prevalent in hypertensive adults, especially in patients with resistant hypertension, with variant prevalence of 60-80% in different studies.227,228 Clinically, patients with OSA often present with obesity, large neck, and macroglossia and complain of daytime somnolence, impaired concentration, snoring during sleep and witnessed apneas. In addition, nocturnal non-dipper pattern, elevated daytime BP, tachycardia and/or bradycardia are frequently seen during ambulatory BP testing in OSA patients. OSA could be screened with questionnaire of Berlin Questionnaire or Epworth Sleepiness scale. Once positive, further gold standard diagnostic tool, polysomnography, can be used and the severity of OSA can be evaluated based on the apnea-hypopnea index.162,163 Although continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is effective in treating OSA, the effects on hypertension are small, about 2-3 mmHg reduction.162\n\n5.6 Drug or alcohol-induced secondary hypertension\n\nMedication history should be carefully reviewed since BP is affected by numerous substances, including prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, herbals, and food substances ( ).166,229 Substance affects BP through several mechanisms: substance itself is associated with hypertension development, drug-drug, or drug-food interactions, which are associated with the development of hypertension, worsening control of previously well-managed hypertension, or attenuation of the BP-lowering effects of pre-existing antihypertensive therapy. When feasible, drugs affecting BP should be reduced or discontinued, and alternative agents should be used; new or pre-existing antihypertensive therapy should be adjusted according to individual’s BP status.\n\n5.7 Other endocrine disorders\n\nPheochromocytoma, Cushing’s syndrome and thyroid disorder are rare in hypertensive patients with unique clinical presentation. In pheochromocytoma, paroxysmal increase of plasma catecholamine causes intermittent hyperadrenergic spells, which induces clinical symptoms such as paroxysmal hypertension, palpitation, perspiration, pallor, and pounding headache.161-163 Twenty-four-hour urine catecholamines and metanephrine or plasma fractionated metanephrine are used as screening tools. Abdominal CT or MRI and scintigraphy localization are indicated as confirmatory tests.162,163\n\nHypertension is commonly found in 80% of patients with Cushing’s syndrome. Long-term excessive endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids can cause a typical body habitus with central obesity, faci"
