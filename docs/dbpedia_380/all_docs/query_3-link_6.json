        "text": "Most countries can be abbreviated by the first character in their name especially when describing the relations between two or more countries. There are some exceptions and many will be duplicates.\n\nFor example:\n\n印 can refer to both 印度 India and 印尼 Indonesia; short for 印度尼西亚.\n\n伊 can refer to 伊朗 Iran and 伊拉克 Iraq. 两伊 means Iran-Iraq.\n\n新 can refer to 新加坡 Singapore and 新西兰 New Zealand.\n\n巴 can refer to 巴基斯坦 Pakistan, 巴勒斯坦 Palestine, 巴拿马 Panama, 巴拉圭 Paraguay and 巴布亚新几内亚 Papua New Guinea.\n\nSo you can put two countries together + 战争 War, + 冲突 Conflict, + 关系 Relations, etc.\n\nExamples:\n\n以巴冲突 Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n两伊战争 Iran-Iraq War.\n\n中日关系 Sino-Japanese relations.\n\nWe only refer to some countries this way:\n\n德国 (Deutsch)，法国 (France)，美国 (America), 英国 (England), 俄国 (Russia) - these countries were the first countries to visit China. Maybe at that time people began to learn English and translated the name in a different way.\n\nAlso 俄国 is more for referring to Russia before Soviet Union (苏联). Current Russia we call 俄罗斯.\n\nFor 韩国 (south Korea), it's because Koreans call their country 大韓民國.\n\nFor 泰国, I'm not sure.\n\nFor other countries' names, we try to use the pronunciation for translation:\n\nAustralia - 澳大利亚, 澳洲\n\nAustria - 奥地利\n\nSpain - 西班牙\n\nCanada - 加拿大\n\nPortugal - 葡萄牙 ..."
