Here are my thoughts (in favor of “Taiwan”):\n\nThe OpenStreetMap wiki clearly mention to use the common name. IMHO Taiwan is the common name used both in Taiwan and the rest of the world (except in China maybe? but then what is the common name there?). I never heard of “Republic of China” until I became more interested about the subject. A quick Google query will clearly proves it.\n\nIn case of disputes the OpenStreetMap wiki indicates to use ground information which I believe is very easy for identifying a city or street name but where do you look on the ground for a country name? Maybe the documentation isn’t precise enough in this case. Any advice appreciated.\n\nThe same dispute as been going on in the Wikipedia article where pages and pages of vigorous discussion were written. Their policy defines using non-neutral but common names. The edit war seems to have been solved by semi-protecting the article and using Taiwan as name of the article.\n\nAll the other major concurrent maps I can think of are displaying Taiwan. The Natural Earth data set (http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/110m-admin-0-countries/) also use Taiwan in its default/first name.\n\nThe “Republic of China (Taiwan)” and similar other combined names often used in official documentations isn’t relevant to me, as written in the documentation “if there are two common versions of a place name, the \"name\" tag could contain them both” but only one name is common here: “Taiwan”.\n\nThanks for your feedback!"
