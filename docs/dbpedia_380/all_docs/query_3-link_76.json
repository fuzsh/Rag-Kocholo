        "text": "Six medals have been won by TPE athletes including gold in the women's 59kg weightlifting spectacle as well as silvers by the men's archery team and in the men's 60kg judo final.\n\nBut who are TPE and why have they been branded with that particular code?\n\nRadioTimes.com is here to help clear up the confusion surrounding TPE at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nMore like this\n\nWhich country is TPE at the Olympics?\n\nTPE stands for Chinese Taipei at the Olympic Games for Tokyo 2020, though the athletes competing for TPE are actually from Taiwan.\n\nChinese Taipei have competed in every Summer Olympic Games since 1984 under that name and have won at least one gold medal in their last five appearances including this current Games.\n\nOf course, the Chinese Taipei brand is far from widely accepted across the globe and is certainly not without controversy. Are you ready for a rapid fire Chinese history lesson? Of course you are.\n\nFor the latest news and expert tips on getting the best deals this year, take a look at our Black Friday 2021 and Cyber Monday 2021 guides.\n\nWhy is Taiwan competing as Chinese Taipei in the Olympics?\n\nThe Republic of China was the dominant force in mainland China until 1949 when, as a result of the Chinese Civil War, they were deposed and relocated to Taiwan.\n\nThe People's Republic of China, led by the infamous Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, began to rule the country that went on to become the China we know today with the new flag – red with five yellow stars in the top left corner.\n\nThe Republic of China, who were ousted from the mainland, took up residence in the island territory of Taiwan and kept their flag.\n\nSince 1949, the island has been a disputed territory. The People's Republic of China contest the authorities on the island, claiming its government is illegitimate.\n\nAnyway, back to sport, shall we? Pressure from the People's Republic of China forced Taiwan – who had been competing in the Olympics under the banner of Republic of China – to instead compete under the banner of Chinese Taipei.\n\nWhere is Chinese Taipei on a map?\n\nTaiwan – or Chinese Taipei – lies just off the south east coast of mainland China, adrift from the Fujian region. It is also relatively close to Hong Kong in that corner of China.\n\nThe island sits north of Philippines and a north east trip from the capital, Kaohsiung City, across the east China sea would lead to the south west coast of Japan where the Games are being held.\n\nFind out what else is on at the Games with our guide to the Olympics on TV today."
