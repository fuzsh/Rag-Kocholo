In common usage, Taiwan is referred to as Taiwan or the ROC, and since 1949 it gradually has become a prevalent habit to use the two terms as substitutes for each other. However, it should not be forgotten that the ROC between its foundation in 1912 and the end of WWII in 1945 did not include Taiwan, and Taiwan had its own rich, colourful history before 1945. The following explanations are helpful to reduce possible misconceptions.\n\nTaiwan å°ç£ is basically a geographical term for the island in the Western Pacific. It is not the official name of the state which administers it.\n\nROC stands for the Republic of China (Zhonghua minguo ä¸­è¯æ°å) which was formally established in 1912 on the Chinese mainland. At that time, Taiwan was a colony of Japan. Taiwan was incorporated into the ROC following the defeat of Japan at the end of WWII, and ROC has been used as the official state name there since.\n\nChina (Zhongguo ä¸­å) is the name of the country in East Asia. Politically, it usually refers to the People's Republic of China (Zhonghua renmin gongheguo ä¸­è¯äººæ°å ±åå, abbrev. PRC) that was set up in Beijing in 1949, but Taiwan has never been under the control of the PRC. As states, the ROC and the PRC are two separate sovereign, independent entities. In the ROC/Taiwan, the PRC is often referred to as \"mainland\" (dalu å¤§é¸) or \"mainland China\" (Zhongguo dalu ä¸­åå¤§é¸). In a historical context, China may also refer to the ROC (1912-1949), the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and so on.\n\nPlease note that terms like \"Taiwan, China\" or \"Taiwan, province of China\" are regarded in Taiwan as being part of a scheme pursued by the PRC to downgrade Taiwan's status in the international arena, and they are not sanctioned or approved by the ROC government.\n\nIn modern Taiwan, it has become fashionable using the name \"Formosa\" when referring to Taiwan, especially among young supporters of Taiwan independence. In Chinese, both the phonetic equivalent Fuermosha ç¦ç¾æ©æ² as well as meilidao ç¾éºå³¶ (i. e. the Chinese translation of the whole original Portuguese term \"Ilha Formosa\", meaning \"beautiful island\" in English) are popular. On the negative side of the spectrum, some pro-independence hardliners refer to China using the old Japanese term \"Shina\" (Chinese pronunciation zhina æ¯é£, in Japanese hiragana: shina しな) which is perceived as highly derogatory and offensive as well as an unmistakable marker of anti-China sentiment, therefore that term is generally considered inadmissible in civilized, academic discourse.\n\nThe relations between Taiwan and China are one of the most important aspects of ROC politics, therefore Cross-Strait issues are covered extensively on this website. A selection of links is shown directly below.\n\nCross-Strait relations since the late 1970sâan overview [Introduction Taiwan/ROC]\n\nMainland Affairs Council (MAC) [Ministries and cabinet agencies]\n\nHandling of the Cross-Strait relations [Other central government agencies]\n\nIncessant threatâthe PRC [Other central government agencies]\n\nROC vs. PRC since the 1970s [Foreign relations of the ROC]\n\nWhy mention \"native province\"?\n\nDue to the nature of Taiwan's political landscape which is characterized by the persistent rivalry between \"mainlanders\" (waishengren å¤çäºº) on the one side and \"Taiwanese\" (Taiwanren å°ç£äºº)/\"locals\" (benshengren æ¬çäºº) on the other side as well as the deep rift between the \"blue\" and \"green\" political camps, the origin and background of a politician in the ROC is still regarded a significant factor. For this reason, lists showing the heads of government agencies and other organizations in this file feature a column labelled \"Native Province\" on the right side of the respective table.\n\nTOP HOME\n\n===== ===== ===== ===== =====\n\n◆ Basic facts about the Republic of China (ROC)\n\nThe political system of the ROC todayâa brief description\n\nTaiwan Who's Whoâan overview of current top politicians in the ROC\n\nTerritory and jurisdiction\n\nA glance at the ROC's historical background\n\nThe ROC Constitution and its amendments\n\nNational day, national symbols and national anthem\n\nMajor orders and decorations in the ROC\n\n++++++++++ TOP HOME [next chapter] [previous chapter] ++++++++++\n\nThe political system of the ROC todayâa brief description\n\nCentral level\n\nLocal level, democratic elections, political parties\n\nThe ROC today is a sovereign, independent and self-ruled democratic state. Modern democracies in general uphold the principle of separation of powers, and most democratic states have a system with three branches (legislature/parliament, executive/government, and judiciary/court system) according to the trias politica principle. By definition, a state consists of all administrative agencies belonging to those three branches, but in Taiwanâs case the political system of the ROC features five branches (Yuan é¢) on the central level:\n\n✿ Executive Yuan (xingzhengyuan è¡æ¿é¢) [est. 1928]âi. e. central government,\n\n✿ Legislative Yuan (lifayuan ç«æ³é¢) [est. 1928]âi. e. parliament,\n\n✿ Judicial Yuan (sifayuan å¸æ³é¢) [est. 1928],\n\n✿ Control Yuan (jianchayuan ç£å¯é¢) [est. 1928/1931], and\n\n✿ Examination Yuan (kaoshiyuan èè©¦é¢) [est. 1930].\n\nAs head of state the president (zongtong ç¸½çµ±) of the ROC is not part of one particular branch but represents all of them as their combination constitutes the state as a whole. Furthermore, there is a distinction between the central level and the local levels of ROC administrative agencies, the five Yuan and the presidency being part of the central level.\n\nThe most important elements of the ROCâs political system are as follows.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [Directory ROC political system]\n\nCentral level\n\nInstitutionLogoDescription Presidential Office\n\n(ç¸½çµ±åº)\n\n🌏 â Web link The ROC's head of state and commander-in-chief is the popularly elected President (see page \"ROC Presidency\"). The ROC president appoints the Premier, i. e. the head of the Executive Yuan, as well as the heads of the Judicial Yuan, the Control Yuan and the Examination Yuanâbut not of the Legislative Yuan. Executive Yuan\n\n(è¡æ¿é¢)\n\n🌏 â Web link The Executive Yuan is the cabinet of the ROC, i. e. the central government. Its agencies implement the policies devised by the ROC president and the laws approved by the legislature. (See page \"Executive Yuan [Cabinet]\") Legislative Yuan\n\n(ç«æ³é¢)\n\n🌏 â Web link The popularly elected parliament of the ROC is called the Legislative Yuan. (See page \"Legislative Yuan [Parliament]\") The ROC Constitution that went into force on Dec. 25, 1947 stipulated a bicameral system with the Legislative Yuan and a National Assembly (NA). Since the abolition of the NA in 2005 the ROC's representation of the people has been unicameral. Judicial Yuan\n\n(å¸æ³é¢)\n\n🌏 â Web link The Judicial Yuan directs the ROC's court system. Its head is appointed by the ROC president. (See page \"Judicial Yuan\") Control Yuan\n\n(ç£å¯é¢)\n\n🌏 â Web link The Control Yuan executes impeachment and audit functions (see page \"Control Yuan\"). The head of the Control Yuan is appointed by the ROC president. Examination Yuan\n\n(èè©¦é¢)\n\n🌏 â Web link The Examination Yuan manages the civil service system of the ROC (see page \"Examination Yuan\"). The head of the Examination Yuan is appointed by the ROC president.\n\nAs for the central government, its superordinate organizationâthe Executive Yuanâis headed by the ROC Premier (xingzheng yuanzhang è¡æ¿é¢é·) who is appointed by the ROC president. The Executive Yuan directs the cabinet agencies, i. e. ministries (bu é¨), councils/commissions (weiyuanhui å§å¡æ), directorate-generals (zongchu ç¸½è) and two others: the Central Bank (zhongyang yinhang ä¸­å¤®éè¡) and the National Palace Museum (gugong bowuyuan æ å®®åç©é¢).\n\nPlease note that in contrast to most states, not all ministries in the political system of the ROC are cabinet agencies. While most ministries of the ROC are under the Executive Yuan (cabinet), two other Yuan have ministries as wellâthe Control Yuan and the Examination Yuan (see the following list).\n\nExecutive YuanControl Yuan Ministry of Interior (MOI)\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)\n\nMinistry of National Defense (MND)\n\nMinistry of Justice (MOJ)\n\nMinistry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)\n\nMinistry of Finance (MOF)\n\nMinistry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)\n\nMinistry of Education (MOE)\n\nMinistry of Culture (MOC)\n\nMinistry of Health and Welfare (MOHW)\n\nMinistry of Labor (MOL)\n\nMinistry of Digital Affairs (MODA)\n\nMinistry of Agriculture (MOA)\n\nMinistry of Environment (MOENV) Ministry of Audit (NAO)\n\nExamination Yuan Ministry of Examination (MOEX)\n\nMinistry of Civil Service (MOCS)\n\nTO BE OR NOT TO BEâSince the early 2000s there has been an ongoing debate whether the Control Yuan and the Examination Yuan should be abolished. Critics argue that both Yuan are relics of imperial China, neither appropriate nor necessary in a modern democratic system. While the functions of the Examination Yuan could indeed be performed by agencies like the Directorate-General of Personnel Administration (DGPA), the Control Yuan could play a truly valuable role as independent watchdog institution if its head was not appointed by the ROC president but elected by the ROC citizens.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [Directory ROC political system]\n\nLocal level, democratic elections, political parties\n\nOn the local level, the ROC today formally consists of two provinces, Taiwan and Fujian, plus 6 special municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the central government. In practical administrative reality, the two provincial governments were streamlined since 1998, and by the end of 2018 the positions of provincial governors were abolished. Counties and county-level cities are nominally still listed under the provincesâTaiwan Province has 14 county-level local governments, Fujian Province has 2. The heads of county-level governments and the mayors of special municipalities are elected by direct popular vote. (See page \"Local administration\")\n\nFollowing the lifting of martial law in 1987 the ROC underwent a period of democratization, and the Taiwanese people have now been directly electing their own president and parliament in free and fair elections since more than a quarter of a century. City mayors and county magistrates are also popularly elected. (See page \"Democratic elections\")\n\nSince 1987 the ROC evolved from a one-party dictatorship to a multi-party democracy. In todayâs Taiwan, political parties play important roles as stakeholders, they contribute to the formation of political opinions, and leading administrative positions are usually (but not necessarily) occupied by members of the party currently in power. As the ROC president has been directly elected by the people from the year 1996 on, the presidency has been in the hands of either the KMT or the DPP.

From its establishment in 1912 up to the recurring civil war between Nationalist government forces and Communist rebels which began shortly after the surrender of Japanese invaders, Mainland China constituted the area under ROC jurisdiction. On Oct. 25, 1945 the ROC formally took control of Taiwan and Penghu which until then had been under Japanese colonial rule for five decades. Between early 1946 and late 1949 the ROC suffered the most dramatic losses when its forces were driven from the Chinese mainland by the Chinese Communists. Since the retreat from the Dachen Islands off Zhejiang province in February 1955, the territory under ROC control has been limited to the Taiwan area. (The only two areas which have been continuously under ROC control since 1912 to this day are the counties Kinmen and Lienchiang belonging to the ROCâs Fujian province.)\n\nHowever, decades went by until the loss of the mainland was appropriately reflected in official ROC publications. For example, up until the early 1990s maps in the ROC Yearbooks showed that the ROC territory comprised not only Taiwan but also the Chinese mainland and even included Outer Mongolia. According to those sources China (= the ROC) had an area of 11,418,174 km² (ROC Yearbook 1995, p. 15). That stance was mitigated to a certain extent later in the 1990s, and although the ROC has never formally given up its claim to be the legitimate ruler of China as a whole, it has finally acknowledged the reality that the ROC government exercises de facto control over the Taiwan area only and has no jurisdiction over Mainland China.\n\nMISLEADING TERMâTaiwanâs official state name (âRepublic of Chinaâ) has been causing considerable confusion for decades and is profoundly misleading because it suggests that the ROCâs jurisdiction includes Mainland China which is no longer the case. While the authorities in Taipei are very aware of this predicament, they also know that they cannot unilaterally change their official state name, their national flag or national anthem. That is because the PRC, upholding its âone China principleâ and thus insisting that Taiwan has eventually to become a part of the PRC, has repeatedly stressed that a move like giving up âROCâ as a state name by Taipei would be regarded a declaration of independence, providing Beijing with an excuse to launch an attack and annex Taiwan by military force, a threat that was reiterated in the PRCâs so-called âAnti-Secession Lawâ. Democratic Taiwan not being able to adopt a different national flag due to pressure by the authoritarian PRC is especially ironic because the PRC authorities wouldnât even allow the display of the ROC national flag in their jurisdiction (or anywhere else in the world).\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [Directory territory / jurisdiction]\n\nTaiwan area: Geographic margin points (dry land) and their coordinates\n\nMargin Location Latitude Longitude Northernmost point\n\n(undisputed) Hsiyin è¥¿å¼å³¶\n\n(Matsu) 26Â° 23â² 01″ N 120Â° 28â² 47″ E Southernmost point\n\n(disputed) Taiping å¤ªå¹³å³¶\n\n(Spratly Islands) ⚔ 10Â° 22â² 29″ N 114Â° 21â² 52″ E Southernmost point\n\n(undisputed) Eluanbi éµé¾é¼»\n\n(Pingtung County) 21Â° 53â² 49″ N 120Â° 51â² 35″ E Westernmost point\n\n(disputed) Taiping å¤ªå¹³å³¶\n\n(Spratly Islands) ⚔ 10Â° 22â² 29″ N 114Â° 21â² 36″ E Westernmost point\n\n(undisputed) Ertan äºè½å³¶\n\n(Kinmen) 24Â° 22â² 54″ N 118Â° 09â² 11″ E Easternmost point\n\n(disputed) Chiwei èµ¤å°¾å¶¼\n\n(Diaoyutai Islands) ⚔ 25Â° 55â² 10″ N 124Â° 34â² 14″ E Easternmost point\n\n(undisputed) Mianhua æ£è±å¶¼\n\n(Three Northern Islets) 25Â° 29â² 02″ N 122Â° 06â² 24″ E\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [Directory territory / jurisdiction]\n\nMongolia\n\nOlder maps published in Taiwan up to the 1990s show the ROC in boundaries which included Outer Mongolia. In fact, Outer Mongolia, incorporated into the Qing empire in 1691, had declared independence in 1911, aligned itself with the USSR in 1924 as Mongolian People's Republic and was renamed Mongolia in 1992.\n\nIt was not before Feb. 26, 2002 that the ROC indicated it had dropped its claim of Mongolia being Chinese territory by excluding that country's citizens from the coverage of the \"Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area\" (Taiwan diqu yu dalu diqu renmin guanxi tiaoli å°ç£å°åèå¤§é¸å°åäººæ°éä¿æ¢ä¾), and on May 21, 2012 Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) confirmed that Mongolia was not included in the ROC territory.

Other countries (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam) reject those claims.\n\nIn comparison, the PRC follows a much more aggressive approach in its attempts to enforce its claim than Taiwan. For years, the PRC has taken to expanding existing islands or even building artificial islands in disputed areas there, and the PRC has also increased its military presence in the waters of the South China Seaâmeasures which are strongly criticized by the US seeking to uphold freedom of navigation (FON) in international waters.\n\nIslands in the South China Sea which are currently controlled by the ROC include the Pratas Islands (dongsha qundao æ±æ²ç¾¤å³¶) and Taiping Island (taiping dao å¤ªå¹³å³¶).\n\nâ â â Map of disputed areas in the South China Sea â â â\n\nSource: Wikimedia © Creative Commons, author: Goran tek-en (Jan. 23, 2014)\n\nFor another map of unclear origin circulating on social media of the internet which illustrates the PRC's claims in the South China Sea (and highlights their absurdity) please click here.\n\nPlease note that this website's page \"Other texts and documents\" contains three documents pertaining to the South China Sea controversy:\n\n• Article 121 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982),\n\n• Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (2002), and\n\n• South China Sea ArbitrationâPCA Press Release (2016).\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [Directory territory / jurisdiction]\n\nJust a \"small country\"?\n\nBecause Taiwan/the ROC has large and powerful regional neighbours like China and Japan, it is in general often perceived by the international community as a small country.

In its early period the ROC was plagued by internal strife, civil war-like conditions and division, and between the death of president Yuan Shikai in 1916 and 1928 there was no uncontested central government with real authority when much of the mainland was controlled by local warlords (junfa è»é¥). After the 1926â1928 Northern Expedition (beifa zhanzheng åä¼æ°ç­) against the warlords was successfully concluded under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek (âCKSâ), most of todayâs ROC government agencies and institutions were established in the capital Nanjing. The ROC Political Tutelage Period Act (Zhonghua minguo xunzheng shiqi yuefa ä¸­è¯æ°åè¨æ¿ææç´æ³), promulgated on June 1, 1931, stipulated that the central government was to be led by the Chinese Nationalist Party/Kuomintang (KMT).\n\nLater in 1931 Japanese forces began invading the ROC, first advancing into the Manchurian provinces where a Japanese puppet regime called âManchukuoâ led by former Qing emperor Pu Yi was installed in 1932. An incident at the Marco Polo Bridge (Lugouqiao èæºæ©) in Beiping (as Beijing was called between 1928 and 1949) in 1937 was followed by a massive Japanese offensive into the Chinese heartland, and another Japanese puppet regime was installed in Nanjing under Wang Ching-wei in 1940 while the ROC government retreated to Chongqing. After Japanâs eventual defeat at the end of WWII, Taiwanâceded to Japan by the Qing in the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki (maguan tiaoyue é¦¬éæ¢ç´) marking the end of the First Chinese-Japanese War (jiawu zhanzheng ç²åæ°ç­, 1894â1895)âwas returned to Chinaâs territory in 1945 according to the agreements by the Allies.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [Directory ROC history]\n\nInterlude with fundamental changes (plus Taiwan, minus mainland)\n\nThe same year civil war broke out on the mainland between forces led by the Chinese Communist Party (Zhongguo gongchandang ä¸­åå ±ç¢é»¨, abbrev.

PRC) on the mainland on Oct. 1, 1949 while the KMT-led ROC government retreated to Taiwan, along with more than a million refugees. Since 1955, the ROC has been in control only of the Taiwan area. (More information about Taiwan's specific history can be found here.)\n\nDirectly after the termination of Japan's colonial period (Riju shidai æ¥ææä»£, also called Rizhi shiqi æ¥æ²»ææ) in Taiwan the ROC's new provincial administration arrived on the island, but soon tensions mounted with the local population, which was regarded as \"hostile overseas Chinese\" (diqiao æµå) by the government. Clashes triggered by the bloody 1947 \"Incident of the 28th February\" (ererba shijian äºäºå «äºä»¶/\"2-28\") in Taipei resulted in an islandwide violent uprising and a brutal crackdown carried out by hastily deployed government troops from the mainland. In response to the insurgency in Taiwan and civil war raging on the mainland, CKS imposed martial law over the ROC on May 20, 1947. The following period is often referred to as the \"White Terror\" (baise kongbu ç½è²ææ) in Taiwan, during which any opposition activity was mercilessly suppressed by the regime, thousands of people were executed and even more were incarcerated as political prisoners. Members of the Japanese-educated elite were especially targeted, and mentioning 2-28 or advocating Taiwan independence could be enough to earn a death warrant from the authorities.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [Directory ROC history]\n\nThe ROC since 1949âTaiwan without the Chinese mainland\n\nIn the decades of Cold War between the ROC and the PRC, the Taiwan area was ruled with an iron fist by CKS's military dictatorship. After CKS's death in 1975 things started to change. His son and successor Chiang Ching-kuo (\"CCK\") gradually initiated political reforms, and martial law was lifted in 1987 (in Taiwan and Penghu; 1992 in Kinmen and Matsu). While in many countries the transition from authoritarian rule to democracy is marred by chaos and bloodshed, CCK accomplished this feat with comparatively minimal disruption. Another important trend that took shape under CCK's presidency was localization (bentuhua æ¬åå), increasingly more Taiwan-born politicians were appointed as top cabinet officials or obtained other major positions of political leadership in the ROC. These had almost exclusively been reserved for mainlanders when CKS was in command.\n\nUnder CCK's successor Lee Teng-hui the \"Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion\" (dongyuan kanluan shiqi linshi tiaokuan åå¡æ¡äºææè¨ææ¢æ¬¾)âimposed in 1948âwere abolished in 1991, and reforms were continued and extended significantly. Over time, the ROC evolved into the vibrant, fully-fledged multi-party democracy it is today. The first opposition political partyâthe Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)âwas founded in 1986, elections for all seats of the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan took place in 1991 and 1992, respectively, the first direct presidential election was held in 1996, and 2000 saw the first peaceful transition of political power to an opposition party when DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian was elected ROC president.\n\nThe consolidation of the ROC's democratic development has been confirmed with the subsequent peaceful transitions of political powerâthe victories of KMT candidate Ma Ying-jeou in the 2008 presidential election and of DPP candidate Tsai Ing-wen in the 2016 presidential election as well as the DPP winning an absolute majority in the Legislative Yuan in 2016. Those events clearly indicate that change of political power decided by ballot and a subsequent smooth handover of administration has become a normal, established feature in Taiwan politics.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [Directory ROC history]\n\nSelected timelines and chronologies\n\nPlease note that for additional historical information this website offers several different detailed chronologies, see list directly below.\n\nComplementary timeline Taiwan/ROC\n\nCapitals in the history of the ROC\n\nChronology of the ROC Constitution\n\nMilestones of the ROC presidency since 1947\n\nChronology of democratic elections in the ROC since 1987\n\nRepublic of Formosa chronology (1895)\n\nJapanese colonial period (1895-1945): Timeline of important events\n\nEvents at the end of WWII concerning the Japanese theater (1945)\n\nWhite Terror chronology (1947-1987)\n\nMilestones of transitional justice in Taiwan\n\nDevelopment of Cross-Strait relations since the 1970s\n\nChronology of the ROC diplomatic relations since 1970\n\nMilestones in the ROCâUS bilateral relations\n\nJapan and China/Taiwan/the ROC since the 19th centuryâa retrospective\n\nTimeline ROCâMongolia\n\nTaiwanâs Olympic medals timeline (summer games)\n\nMajor earthquakes during Japanâs colonial era in Taiwan\n\nMajor earthquakes in the Taiwan area since WWII\n\nMajor air incidents in the Taiwan area since WWII\n\nA chronology of the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan since 2020\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [Directory ROC history]\n\nCapitals in the history of the ROC\n\nThe ROC capital (Zhonghua minguo shoudu ä¸­è¯æ°åé¦é½) was moved several times due to internal strife, civil war or attack by foreign forces.\n\n1912 (Jan. 1âApril) Nanjing åäº¬ (aka Nanking) 1912 (April)â1928 (July) Beijing åäº¬ (aka Peking) 1928 (July)â1932 (January) Nanjing 1932 (JanuaryâDecember) Luoyang æ´é½ 1932 (December)â1937 (Nov. 12) Nanjing 1937 (Nov. 12)â1946 (May 5) Chongqing éæ ¶ (aka Chungking) 1946 (May 5)â1949 (Jan. 16) Nanjing 1949 (Jan. 16âOct. 13) Guangzhou å»£å· (aka Canton or Kwangchow/Kuang-chou) 1949 (Oct. 13âNov. 29) Chongqing 1949 (Nov. 29âDec. 10) Chengdu æé½ (aka Chengtu) 1949 (Dec. 10)â Taipei èºå\n\nPlease note that Luoyang was referred to as \"administrative capital\" (xingdu è¡é½), Chongqing was called \"provisional capital\" (peidu éªé½), and Taipei's official status is \"seat of the central government\" (zhongyang zhengfu suozaidi ä¸­å¤®æ¿åºæå¨å°).

While the constitution nominally went into effect on Dec. 25, 1947, it could factually not be implemented as martial law (jieyanfa æå´æ³) was imposed over the ROC on May 25, 1947.

It commemorates the 1911 Wuchang Uprising (Wuchang qiyi æ­¦æèµ·ç¾©) that heralded the Hsinhai Revolution which in turn eventually led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty and the founding of the ROC.\n\nThe three most important national symbols in the ROC today are the ROC national flag (Zhonghua minguo guoqi ä¸­è¯æ°ååæ), the ROC national emblem (Zhonghua minguo guohui ä¸­è¯æ°ååå¾½), and the ROC national flower (Zhonghua minguo guohua ä¸­è¯æ°ååè±).\n\nROC national flag\n\nThe design of today's national flag as shown on the right is called \"Blue Sky, White Sun and a Wholly Red Earth\" (qingtian bairi mandihong éå¤©ç½æ¥æ»¿å°ç´ ). The flag's three colours of blue, white and crimson collectively signify the Three Principles of the People (sanmin zhuyi ä¸æ°ä¸»ç¾©): blueâliberty, justice and democracy (minquan æ°æ¬); whiteâequality, brightness and social well-being (minsheng æ°ç); and crimsonâfraternity, sacrifice and nationalism (minzu æ°æ). The Three Principles of the People are the political philosophy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen å­«é¸ä», and they are mentioned in Article 1 of the ROC Constitution: 'The Republic of China, founded on the Three Principles of the People, shall be a democratic republic of the people, to be governed by the people and for the people.' (ä¸­è¯æ°ååºæ¼ä¸æ°ä¸»ç¾©ï¼çºæ°ææ°æ²»æ°äº«ä¹æ°ä¸»å ±ååã)\n\nThe canton of the flag consists of the \"Blue Sky with a White Sun flag\" (qingtian bairiqi éå¤©ç½æ¥æ) which was first used for the \"Revive China Society\" (xing Zhong hui èä¸­æ) in February 1895, designed by Lu Haodong é¸çæ± (1868-1895) around 1893 and still used as KMT party flag to this day. The red portion of today's national flag was added by Sun Yat-sen in 1906, but Sun's design didn't become the ROC national flag until after his death when it officially replaced the five-coloured flag (wuseqi äºè²æ) in December 1928.\n\nThe five-coloured flag, adopted as ROC national flag in January 1912, had represented the principle of five races under one union (wuzu gonghe äºæå ±å) with five horizontal stripesâ(from top to bottom) red for the Han, yellow for the Manchus, blue for the Mongols, white for the Hui/Chinese Muslims, and black for the Tibetans.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [ROC national symbols]\n\nROC national emblem\n\nThe current national flag also contains the national emblem: the circular Blue Sky with a White Sun (qingtian bairi éå¤©ç½æ¥). It was designed by Ho Ying-chin ä½ææ¬½ in 1924 and adopted as national emblem on Dec. 17, 1928. The twelve points of the white sun represent the traditional twelve two-hour periods of the day (shichen æè¾°), and together they stand for the spirit of unceasing progress.\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2021 the ROC Legislative Yuan passed a resolution (63-37) instructing the Ministry of the Interior to evaluate the possibility of changing the ROC national emblem, pointing out that the national emblem is âeasily confusedâ with the KMTâs party emblem.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [Directory ROC national symbols]\n\nROC national flower\n\nThe plum blossom (Prunus mei), called meihua æ¢ è± in Chinese, was officially designated as national flower by the ROC Executive Yuan on July 21, 1964. The triple grouping of stamens (one long and two short) represents the Three Principles of the People. The five petals symbolize the five branches of government (Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Control Yuan, and Examination Yuan).\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [Directory ROC national symbols]\n\nControversial symbols\n\nThe ROC national flag has become a rare sight outside the ROC. As a result of pressure applied by the PRC globally, most states in the world have adopted a âOne-Chinaâ policy, and therefore showing the ROC national flag in the public sphere and at international sporting events has been banned in most countries except those maintaining formal diplomatic relations with the ROC. And of course showing the ROC national flag is prohibited in the PRC.\n\nIn the ROC itself, attitudes concerning the display of the flag are considerably different among the supporters of the respective political camps. Quite often, supporters of the blue camp are happy to show the flag on ROC soil but hesitate to do so abroad in order not to unnecessarily anger the PRC. In contrast, supporters of the green camp often do the oppositeâreluctant to show the flag at home because it is regarded as a symbol of the old KMT one-party state and oppression, they eagerly display the flag in other countries as an act of defiance, to set themselves apart from the PRC.\n\nMany supporters of Taiwan independence reject the design of flag, national emblem and national flower as not appropriate for Taiwan since these symbols came from China and don't reflect the Taiwanese. Especially the design of the national flag and the emblem are controversial as they contain the symbol of the KMT party flag, while in a modern democracy national symbols are supposed to be non-partisan.\n\nIn this context the Taiwanese Popular Party (Taiwan minzhongdang èºç£æ°ç¾é»¨) should be mentioned. The Taichung-based political organization was established on July 10, 1927 by Chiang Wei-shui è£æ¸­æ°´ (1891-1931) et. al. and banned by the Japanese colonial authorities on Feb. 18, 1931. The original flag of the party, used between Jan. 2 and Oct. 6, 1929, contained the white sun in the same shape, size and position like in the KMT party flag, while the background colour in the flag's upper half was blue and in the lower half red, using the same hues as the ROC national flag. The design of the Taiwanese Popular Party flag, called shang qing xia hong zhongyang bairi ä¸éä¸ç´ ä¸­å¤®ç½æ¥ in Chinese, clearly indicates that the white sun symbol was not considered as being foreign in Taiwan before the island came under ROC control. Please note that the Taiwanese Popular Party is not identical with the Taiwan People's Party (Taiwan minzhongdang å°ç£æ°ç¾é»¨, abbrev. TPP) which was established on Aug. 6, 2019.\n\nDisplayed below are the logos of the ROC presidential office and the five Yuan. Please note that following the return of the DPP to power in 2016, the original logos of the ROC Presidential Office, the ROC Legislative Yuan and the ROC Examination Yuan which were based on the national flower have been replaced with new designs.\n\nPresidential Office ç¸½çµ±åº\n\n(old logo on the left,\n\ncurrent logo on the right) Executive Yuan è¡æ¿é¢ Legislative Yuan ç«æ³é¢\n\n(old logo on the left,\n\ncurrent logo on the right) Judicial Yuan å¸æ³é¢ Control Yuan ç£å¯é¢\n\n(old logo on the left,\n\ncurrent logo on the right) Examination Yuan èè©¦é¢\n\n(old logo on the left,\n\ncurrent logo on the right)\n\nTOP HOME [◆ ROC basic facts] [Directory ROC national symbols]\n\nROC national anthem\n\nThe text of the ROC national anthem (Zhonghua minguo guoge ä¸­è¯æ°ååæ­), written by Sun Yat-sen, was first introduced on June 16, 1924. Its music was composed in 1928 by Cheng Mao-yun ç¨æç­ (1900-1957), the song was then adopted as the KMT anthem. On June 16, 1937 the KMT Central Standing Committee suggested to make the song the ROC national anthem, and on April 16, 1947 the approval of the proposal was announced.\n\nThe text of the ROC national anthem was translated by Tu Ting-hsiu æåº­ä¿® (b., d. N/A), and the musical accompaniment is attributed to Huang Tzu é»èª (1904-1938).\n\nThe ROC national anthem is yet another bone of contention in Taiwan. It is regarded as unsuitable by many supporters of the green camp, not only for its origin as party anthem of the KMT but also because the beginning of the second phrase in the first line \"wu dang\" (å¾é»¨, meaning \"our party\" in English) is interpreted by them as standing for the KMT and therefore rejected.

A majority of historians, anthropologists and ethnologists believes today that the ancestors of the Austronesian peoples in Taiwan have lived there for at least 6,000 years.\n\nThose who today insist on that they are Taiwanese (Taiwanren å°ç£äºº) actually are in most cases descendants of Han Chinese immigrants from the mainland who had arrived on the island in the 17th to 19th centuries. They are also called \"Holo\" (heluo æ²³æ´/helao æ²³è) or \"Hoklo\" (fulao ç¦ä½¬)âa term which is used to describe both the people and their languageâand hailed from the area of Fujian province. Today, they account for approximately 70 percent of Taiwan's population.\n\nThe Hakka (kejiaren å®¢å®¶äºº) are considered ethnic Han Chinese and arrived in Taiwan about the same time as the Holos. They had set off from Guangdong province on the mainland and now account for about one fifth of Taiwan's population.\n\nWhile the majority of Hakka arrived in Taiwan as families, the early Holo immigrants, typically male and single, often married women of the indigenous Austronesian population, so now many local Taiwanese indeed also have aboriginal DNA. However, offspring of those interethnic unions was usually brought up with an education and cultural identification which was clearly Chinese and had no attributes of aboriginal socialization, especially the later generations. Those who can be identified as aborigines today make up less than 3 percent of Taiwan's total population (according to MOI statistics 589,038 individuals at the end of 2023).\n\n\"Mainlanders\" (waishengren å¤çäºº) usually refers to the group of Han Chinese immigrants who moved to Taiwan from all parts of China after WWII. Most of them were soldiers and ROC government officials who came as refugees when the mainland was overrun by Communist troopsâas many as 1.2 million fled to Taiwan then. Their offspring, including the second and third generation, are commonly regarded as mainlanders as well.\n\nThe term \"new immigrants\" (xin zhumin æ°ä½æ°) refers to a group of people who have emigrated from a foreign country into Taiwan and settled down. Most of the new immigrants in the ROC came from the PRC, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, the Philippines, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia and other countries, in many cases as spouse of an ROC citizen. Others have taken up residence in Taiwan in pursuit of advanced education or job opportunities. The ROC government encourages offspring of mixed marriages to take cultural exchange and language trips to their parents' native countries during school breaks, promoting related activities with subsidies and scholarships. Since the 1990s, the population of the new immigrants continues to rise considerably. According to statistics from the National Immigration Agency (NIA) under the ROC MOI, there were more than 533,000 new immigrants (including more than 338,000 spouses hailing from the PRC) living in the ROC at the end of March 2018.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ Taiwan's population and languages] [Taiwan's ethnic groups]\n\nLanguages in modern Taiwan\n\nThere are a number of different languages in the Taiwan area which are spoken by local inhabitants as first language, including the following:\n\nHolo (heluoyu æ²³æ´èª) aka Hoklo (fulaoyu ç¦ä½¬èª) or Taiwanese Hokkien (Taiwan minnanyu å°ç£é©åèª)\n\nHakka (kejiahua å®¢å®¶è©±)\n\nMandarin Chinese (guoyu åèª) = the Peking dialect (Beijinghua åäº¬è©±), the official language of the ROC\n\nSeveral indigenous Austronesian languages\n\nWhile Mandarin Chinese, Holo and Hakka belong to the family of Sinitic languages and dialects, the Austronesian languages do not. However, this seemingly simple categorization of languages in modern Taiwan has been complicated for political reasons in connection with cross-strait relations and an evolving national identity.\n\nToday, about 70 percent of Taiwan's population speak Holo, and it has become common to refer to Holo as 'Taiwanese' (taiyu å°èª or Taiwanhua å°ç£è©±), with the both terms being interchangeable. An intense ideological debate has been going on in Taiwan about the proper categorization of Holo, in particular whether that language should be considered being a variety of the Southern Min dialect (minnanhua é©åè©±)âprevalent in the southern part of Fujian provinceâor not.\n\nMost linguists accept that Holo is indeed a variety of the Southern Min dialect as both languages are mutually intelligible. (Southern Min itself belongs to seven to ten dialect groupsâdepending on classificationâof spoken Chinese, which also include Mandarin, but it should be noted that Chinese features an extraordinarily high degree of internal diversity, and in most cases these dialect groups are mutually unintelligible.) Other varieties of Southern Min include Hokkien (Fujianhua ç¦å»ºè©±), Amoy (Xiamenhua å»éè©±) and Teochew (Chaozhouhua æ½®å·è©±).\n\nMigrants from Fujian (most of them hailing from Quanzhou æ³å· and Zhangzhou æ¼³å·) started to settle in Taiwan since the 17th century, and over time the Hokkien of their descendants began to deviate from their original dialect spoken in mainland China due to influences from and interaction with Taiwan's indigenous peoples, the Dutch and later the Japanese. Over the centuries, several local variants of Holo developed. Holo as spoken in Tainan, Kaohsiung and Taitung is regarded the prestige accent. Distinct Holo variations include the accents spoken in Yilan, in Lukang, in Taipei/Hsinchu, in Taichung/Changhua/Chiayi as well as on Penghu. In general, the term 'Taiwanese' is now applied to all of these Holo variations.\n\nHardliners in the camp of pro-independence advocates deny any connection between Taiwan and China. As they regard Mandarin a 'colonizer's language', the name Southern Min dialect is loathed and rejected because the term views Holo as a variant of the Chinese variety spoken in Fujian province on the mainland.\n\nOn the other hand, it is an undeniable fact that the Holo variations common in today's Taiwan and the Southern Min dialect are mutually intelligible, while Holo and other languages which influenced its development to some degree like Japanese, Dutch or indigenous tongues are mutually unintelligible. When a native Holo speaker from Taiwan with no foreign language skills travels to Kinmen or Xiamen å»é, he or she would have little trouble communicating with residents there in their local dialect. Furthermore, the same person would not be able to have a conversation with any Taiwanese aborigines who only speak their indigenous tribal language, or with Dutch or Japanese people without foreign language proficiency.\n\nIt could be argued that using the term 'Taiwanese' exclusively for Holo can be misleading for at least two reasons. First, there is not one single language predominantly spoken in Taiwan today but several. Second, just 500 years ago Holo wasn't even a native language in Taiwan's populationâat that time only Austronesian languages were spoken by the island's inhabitants, and the indigenous peoples have resided on Taiwan much longer than any other ethnic group. (This page offers more information about Taiwan's indigenous peoples and their marginalization.) All said, it would be more appropriate and fair to use the term 'Taiwanese' for a group of languages, including Holo, Hakka and the Austronesian languages.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ Taiwan's population and languages] [Taiwan's languages]\n\nEndangered languages\n\nAfter the 1987 lifting of martial law, restrictions which had been imposed against the use of all Chinese dialects except Mandarin as well as the Austronesian languages of Taiwan's indigenous peoples were completely removed in the 1990s, and today Holo is omnipresent in Taiwan as spoken language and in the media. Meanwhile, most of the languages of the indigenous peoples and also Hakka are considered endangered as the numbers of their speakers in younger generations are declining dramatically. The phenomenon of young Taiwanese not learning the local dialect of their ancestors and speaking mostly Mandarin Chinese instead can even be observed in the Holo segment, so efforts for preserving native languages in Taiwan have been extended to Holo as well.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ Taiwan's population and languages] [Taiwan's languages]\n\n===== ===== ===== ===== =====\n\n◆ Essential information on Taiwan IIâhistory\n\nTaiwan's historyâmuch more than just the ROC\n\nColonization acknowledged as historical fact\n\nThe Republic of Formosa (May to October 1895)\n\nFacts about Japan's colonial rule over Taiwan\n\n2-28, White Terror and a soured relationship\n\nCross-Strait relations since the late 1970sâan overview\n\nNCCU polls in connection with Cross-Strait relations\n\n++++++++++ TOP HOME [next chapter] [previous chapter] ++++++++++\n\nTaiwan's historyâmuch more than just the ROC\n\nPreliminary remarks\n\nComplementary timeline Taiwan/ROC\n\n(Jump to History of the ROC)\n\nPreliminary remarks\n\nTaiwan has been inhabited for millennia by non-Chinese indigenous peoples which are categorized as Austronesian.

After the onset of Taiwan's colonization, the indigenous population was decimated and marginalized, and a succession of various political entities controlled either parts of the island or all of Taiwan.\n\nDutch Formosa (1624â1662: 38 years) controlled parts of Taiwan in the south and later also in the north with the United East India Company (Dutch: Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie, abbrev.

Returned to the Han\n\nThe dominance of Han Chinese in Taiwan's population and mainstream culture is conspicuous and yet a relatively recent phenomenon. Modern historians and anthropologists agree that before the 16th centuryâless than 500 years agoâthere was no noteworthy Chinese population on the island, while indigenous Austronesian peoples are known to have populated Taiwan for at least 6,000 years; according to the Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP), archeological evidence confirms the presence of Malayo-Polynesian peoples on the island dating back 12,000 to 15,000 years.\n\nThe Chinese Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) which preceded the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) did not show any interest in Taiwan. Between 1405 and 1433 Admiral Zheng He é­å (1371-1433), the most famous explorer of the Ming, undertook seven large-scale expeditionary voyages and reached the shores of Vietnam, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, the Arab peninsula and even the east coast of Africa. None of these seven expeditions had Taiwan listed on their itineraries. Zheng He did make a brief, unplanned visit to Taiwan in 1430 when he was shipwrecked while returning to China from Southeast Asia, and while he found it inhabited by aborigines, he evidently did not encounter any Chinese settlements there. The Ming's indifference towards Taiwan is also clearly indicated by their dealings with the Dutchâwhen the Dutch in 1622 tried to establish a base on Penghu, Ming China immediately intervened and warned them that Penghu was Chinese territory. The Dutch were eventually expelled from there in 1624 but were allowed to withdraw to Taiwan where the presence of the Dutch drew no objections from the Ming.\n\nWhereas Taiwan was ignored by the Ming government, a certain amount of trade took place between Chinese merchants and aborigines on Taiwan in the 16th century. The Chinese bought products such as coal, sulfur and gold, and they sold iron and textiles to the aborigines. Similarly sought after by the Chinese were mullet fish as well as deer productsâvenison, skins, and antlers. In the early 17th century there was a small network of Chinese traders living on the island, according to estimates less than 2,000 persons. Also, Chinese pirates appear to have found Taiwan an amenable base in the first half of the 17th century.\n\nDISAMBIGUATIONâIn the context of Taiwan's history, the term 'colonization' has more than one connotation. For information about an alternative use of that term please click here.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ Taiwan's history] [Directory colonization]\n\nGo Dutch\n\nThe period of Taiwan's history which began in the 17th century was unquestionably a history of colonization. The first foreign power to gain a colonial foothold on Taiwan was the Netherlands which established a base called Fort Zeelandia (relanzhe cheng ç±è­é®å) in present-day Anping District of Tainan (southern Taiwan) in 1624. Parts of northern Taiwan came under Spanish sway in 1626, with two settlementsâone around Fort Antonio (hongmao cheng ç´ æ¯å) aka Fort San Domingo (sheng duomingge cheng èå¤æå¥å) at Tamsui and one around Fort San Salvador (sheng saerwaduo cheng èè©ç¾ç¦å¤å) on Heping Island off Keelung. The Dutch drove the Spanish out of Taiwan in 1642, and while the presence of the Spanish remained a small footnote in history, the activities of the Dutch in Taiwan set in motion a development that would thoroughly change the island. (A detailed account on the era of the Dutch in Taiwan can be found in Tonio Andrade's \"How Taiwan Became Chinese\", published in 2005; click here.) Map 1 shows the areas where the two European colonist powers were active on Taiwan, marked in greyâthe Dutch in the south (1624-1662) and the Spanish in the north (1626-1642).\n\nDutch governors on Taiwan 1624â1662\n\nTenure Name of governor Tenure Name of governor 1624â1625 Martinus Sonck † 1644â1646 François Caron 1625â1627 Gerard F. de With 1646â1649 Pieter A.

Unfortunately for the Dutch, the indigenous residents were mostly content to plant just enough for themselves and their families and had no interest in raising crops for sale. For this reason, Chinese immigration was encouraged. Rules, laws and regulations imposed and implemented by the Dutch created a calculable economic and social environment, making Taiwan a safe place for Chinese to move to and invest in. Under the influx of the Chinese since the early 1630s the Dutch colony prosperedâas Dutch governor Nicolaas Verburgh (in office 1649-1653) then put it: 'The Chinese are the only bees on Formosa that give honey.' Towards the end of the Dutch era in Taiwan, estimates put the number of Chinese living in Taiwan in a range between 10,000 and 60,000.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ Taiwan's history] [Directory colonization]\n\nThe Koxinga interlude\n\nThe presence of the Dutch in Taiwan ended when they were expelled by forces led by Ming loyalist Zheng Chenggong é­æå (1624-1662, also known as \"Koxinga\" [guoxingye åå§çº]). After the Dutch surrendered at their main base in southern Taiwan in 1662, they retreated to the former Spanish base in northern Taiwan but were attacked there by Koxinga's troops as well and eventually withdrew from Keelung in the second half of 1668.\n\nKoxinga's \"Kingdom of Tungning\" (dongning wangguo æ±å¯§çå) covered only a territory of modest size (see grey area in Map 2), and it also did not last longâjust a little over two decades. In 1683 the Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty turned to Taiwan because the island and Penghu were the hideout of rebels under Koxinga's leadership, the last stronghold of anti-Qing resistance they sought to eliminate. Qing forces led by Admiral Shi Lang æ½ç (1621-1696) first took the Penghu archipelago in July 1683, the Tungning Kingdom of Koxinga's descendants finally surrendered on Sept. 5 that year.\n\nRulers of the Tungning Kingdom (1662â1683)\n\nTenure Name of ruler Born/Died Native province 2/1662â6/1662 † Zheng Chenggong é­æå 1624-1662 <Japan> 6/1662â1662 Zheng Xi é­è¥² b.

The first Qing official in charge of the local administration based in Tainan was prefectural magistrate (\"prefect\", zhifu ç¥åº) Jiang Yuying è£æ¯è±. In the first decades of Qing rule over Taiwan, the authorities tried to limit immigration to the island and barred families from traveling there to ensure the immigrants would return to their families and ancestral graves in China. Illegal migration to Taiwan continued in spite of that, and the restrictions were relaxed following the 1760s. By 1811 there were more than 1.9 million Chinese immigrants on Taiwan.\n\nAlthough the Qing never controlled Taiwan in its entirety, they nonetheless regarded Taiwan as a whole as their possession. The development of administrative subdivisions as shown below reflects how control of Qing forces over the island gradually advanced (the red asterisk [*] indicating newly established subdivisions).\n\n• 1684â1875: Taiwan Prefecture èºç£åº under Fujian Province\n\nPeriod Subdivisions Counties/subprefectures 1684â1721 3 Fengshan County é³³å±±ç¸£, Taiwan County èºç£ç¸£, and Zhuluo County è«¸ç¾ ç¸£ 1721â1727 4 Fengshan County, Taiwan County, Zhuluo County plus new Changhua County å½°åç¸£ * 1727â1730 5 Changhua County, Fengshan County, Taiwan County, Zhuluo County plus new Penghu Subprefecture æ¾æ¹å»³* 1730â1787 6 Changhua County, Fengshan County, Taiwan County, Zhuluo County, Penghu Subprefecture plus new Tamsui Subprefecture æ·¡æ°´å»³* 1787â1811 6 Changhua County, Chiayi County åç¾©ç¸£ * (= former Zhuluo County), Fengshan County, Taiwan County, Penghu Subprefecture, Tamsui Subprefecture 1812â1875 7 Changhua County, Chiayi County, Fengshan County, Taiwan County, Penghu Subprefecture, Tamsui Subprefecture, plus new Kavalan Subprefecture å¶çªè­å»³ *\n\nIt should be noted that the additions of new counties on Taiwan proper represented the encroachment of ethnic Han settlers and Qing administration on previously indigenous territory.

(The grey areas in Map 3 represent parts of the island which were fully controlled by the Qing authorities around 1894.) The most fierce resistance which advancing Japanese forces encountered was from the indigenous peoples in the mountains, and it was broken with brutal force. When rule over Taiwan was handed to the ROC in 1945 after Japan was defeated in WWII, effective local administration had already been established in all parts of the Island.\n\nIn addition to military suppression against armed resistance, approaches of the Japanese towards the aborigines also included anthropological study and assimilation. Initially the Japanese had only two categories for Taiwan's indigenous peoples: \"domesticated\" aborigines (shoufan çè / jukuban, literally: 'cooked savages') and \"wild\" aborigines (shengfan çè / seiban, literally: 'raw savages'). Japanese anthropologist Ino Kanori ä¼è½ åç© (1867-1925) was the first scientist who undertook systematic research about Taiwan's indigenous peoples, and in 1899 his book \"Notes on Taiwan Barbarians\" (Taiwan fanren shiqing å°ç£èäººäºæ / Taiwan Banjin Jijō å°湾èäººäºæ ) was published where eight groups were identifiedâAmis, Atayal, Paiwan, Puyuma, Tsalisen (zelixian zu æ¾¤å©å æ, i.e. Rukai), Tsao æ¹æ (= Tsou), Vonum (= Bunun), and Pepo (= Pingpu). Assimilation saw some members of the indigenous peoples recruited as soldiers for Japan's imperial army during WWII in a unit called Takasago Volunteers (gaosha yiyongdui é«ç ç¾©åé / Takasago Gyūtai).\n\nA concise general description of Japan's colonial rule over Taiwan can be found here.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ Taiwan's history] [Directory colonization]\n\nReturned to the Han\n\nAfter the handover of Taiwan's administration from Japan to the ROC, the new government enacted the \"Regulations on Restoration of Original Names of Citizens of Taiwan\" (Taiwan shengmin xingming huifu banfa å°ç£çæ°å§ååå¾©è¾¦æ³) on Dec. 9, 1945, and although the law's main purpose was to reverse measures imposed by Japan's colonial government encouraging the Taiwanese to adopt Japanese names (for example, Lee Teng-hui called himself \"Iwasato Masao\" [å²©éæ¿ç·] in the colonial era), it resulted in many aborigines being forced by uncooperative civil servants in household registration offices to adopt Chinese names, disrupting their culture and societies.\n\nFurther explanations about the situation of the indigenous peoples in today's Taiwan can be found here.\n\nTOP HOME [◆ Taiwan's history] [Directory colonization]\n\nThe Republic of Formosa (May to October 1895)\n\nâ Abstract of events\n\nâ Still relevant\n\nâ Major figures of the Republic of Formosa (1895)\n\nâ Republic of Formosa chronology\n\nâ Full text of the Declaration of Independence\n\nContemporary advocates of Taiwan independence sometimes cite the Republic of Formosa (Taiwan minzhuguo å°ç£æ°ä¸»å) aka \"Democratic Republic of Taiwan\" as a precedent underscoring the legitimacy of an independent Taiwan, an early manifestation of a Taiwanese national identity. The events in connection with the advent of Taiwan being a Japanese colony for half a century do indeed deserve a closer look.\n\nAbstract of events\n\nAfter the Qing dynasty (1644-1911)âthe Manchu rulers of Chinaâwas defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing court agreed in the Treaty of Shimonoseki (maguan tiaoyue é¦¬éæ¢ç´) to cede Taiwan, Penghu and the Liaodong peninsula to Japan 'in perpetuity'. The Qing notified the authorities on the other side of the Taiwan Strait that the islands were no longer Chinese territory, and they ordered the officials and troops stationed there to return to the mainland.\n\nWhen the news spread in Taiwan, an outpouring of public indignation there decried the abandonment by Beijing. The general perception of Taiwan's Chinese residents was that China had sold them out, and local intellectuals feared Chinese culture and civilization were in jeopardy. Qiu Fengjia, a Hakka and leading member of the landed gentry from Changhua, urged Tang Jingsong (Taiwan provincial governor [xunfu å·¡æ«] since September 1894) to fend off a Japanese takeover by declaring Taiwan an independent republic.
