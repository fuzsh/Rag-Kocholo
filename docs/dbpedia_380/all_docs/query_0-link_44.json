        "text": "What I love most about TES is how student-driven it is. The voices of students are heard and students are encouraged to take risks and pursue their passions both inside and outside the classroom. This can be in the form of participating or leading CCAs, taking action to fight social injustices they care about or even taking initiative in improving school, to make it an even better learning environment.\n\nBELLA, H4\n\nI enjoy working with our young athletes as it is very rewarding to see their progress.\n\nMr. Demetriou, British Primary Section PE Teacher\n\nTES is a great school to teach at with wonderful students that love their PE lessons! Mr. Poulton, British Primary Section PE Teacher\n\nThe community feeling at TES is wonderful, everyone wants the best for the students and so it is an enjoyable environment to work in.\n\nAlice L, Student Services\n\nThe students are super cute and so well behaved, they genuinely enjoy being at school and that makes me want to be here too.\n\nAlice T, Student Services\n\nIn the library we can see the engagement of the children, they have a true love of reading and learning.\n\nMiranda, Library Assistant\n\nItâ€™s a world-class learning environment filled with spirited students, talented teachers, and creative, cutting-edge classrooms. Taking a walk through the corridors, you will pass French, German and British Sections, but even more diversity can be found in the playgrounds as we blend together as one school. Conversations flow through a multitude of languages, but the smiles are universal. It is a welcoming and inclusive place that provides an exceptional platform from which to teach, learn and flourish. Mr. Stracey, French Primary Section - English Class teacher\n\nI'm grateful for the friendships that I've made at TES. My classmates are from all over the world, and from a variety of backgrounds and cultures. The school has allowed me to learn so much from them, through co-curricular activities or just the simple classwork we do every day.\n\nNICO, H4"
