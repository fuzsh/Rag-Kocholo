The Constitu­tion has been amended seven times, most recently in 2005. The amendments now refer to the “free area of the Republic of China”, to which, for example, the provisions on presi­dential and parliamentary elections apply. For the 2005 amendment, see “Taiwan (Republic of China)’s Constitution of 1947 with Amendments through 2005”, Constitute, 26 August 2021, https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/ Taiwan_2005.pdf?lang=en.\n\n3\n\nThe text of the resolution can be found at U.N. Resolution 2758, 25 October 1971, https://web-archive-2017.ait.org.tw/ en/un-res-2758-voted-to-admit-communist-china.html. 76 states voted in favour of the resolution, 35 voted against and 17 abstained (including from Southeast Asia). The resolution states: “Decides to restore all its rights to the People’s Repub­lic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Gov­ernment as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel henceforth the represen­tatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlaw­fully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organi­zations related to it.”\n\n4\n\nVerbatim: “The U.S. side declared: The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. The United States Government does not challenge that position.” See Department of State Office of the Historian, Joint Statement of the United States Following Dis­cussions with Leaders of the People’s Republic of China, Shanghai, 27 February 1972, https://history.state.gov/historical documents/frus1969-76v17/d203.\n\n5\n\n“Chinese Taipei” is the formula also used for Taiwan’s participation in the Olympic Games.\n\n6\n\nOn the factors that made Taiwan’s admission to APEC possible, see in detail Ming-chin Monique Chu, No Need to Beg China?

On the effects of chequebook diplomacy see also the contribution of Mark Harrison in this research paper, pp. 59ff.\n\n17\n\nSee in more detail Sigrid Winkler, Taiwan’s UN Dilemma: To Be or Not to Be, Taiwan-U.S. Quarterly Analysis (Washing­ton, D.C.: Brookings, 20 June 2012), https://www.brookings. edu/opinions/taiwans-un-dilemma-to-be-or-not-to-be/.\n\n18\n\nWith the exception of the Gambia, with which the PRC did not establish diplomatic relations at the time.\n\n19\n\nSee Jacques deLisle, “Taiwan’s Quest for International Space in the Tsai Era: Adapting Old Strategies to New Cir­cumstances”, in Taiwan in the Era of Tsai Ing-wen. Changes and Challenges, ed. June Teufel Dreyer and Jacques deLisle (Abing­don and New York, 2021), 239–83 (242–46).\n\n20\n\nTo change its uncompromising stance, the PRC demands that Tsai Ing-wen recognise the “1992 Consensus” negotiated in talks between ARATS and SEF. According to this, both par­ties agree that there is only one China, but each side inter­prets what “one China” means.\n\n21\n\nThese were the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Nauru and Palau in the Pacific, Eswatini (Swaziland) in Africa, Belize, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Holy See in Europe. See Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of China (Taiwan), “Diplomatic Allies”, https://en.mofa.gov.tw/AlliesIndex. aspx?n=1294&sms=1007. Between 2016 and 2019, in addi­tion to The Gambia, Taiwan lost Sao Tome and Principe, Panama, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso and the Pacific island states Solomon Islands and Kiribati. See deLisle, “Taiwan’s Quest for International Space in the Tsai Era” (see note 19), 250.\n\n22\n\nTypically, these restrictions refer to the offices of presi­dent, vice-president, prime minister, foreign minister and defence minister, also known as the “Big 5”.\n\n23\n\nSee also deLisle, “Taiwan’s Quest for International Space in the Tsai Era” (see note 19), 249ff.\n\n24\n\nLee Teng-hui’s term in office lasted from 1988 to 2000. The first democratic presidential election was held in 1996.\n\n25\n\nOn the various phases up to Ma Ying-jeou see Kwei-Bo Huang, “Taiwan’s Foreign Policy and International Space” (see note 1), 465ff. For a brief account of scorched earth diplomacy specifically in Southeast Asia, see e.g. Tingting Yang, Southeast Asian Relations with Taiwan, 2000–2016: An Assessment of Vietnam and Singapore, Thesis (Monterey, CA: Naval Postgraduate School, September 2017), 19f., https:// apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1046953.pdf.\n\n26\n\nKwei-Bo Huang, “Taiwan’s Foreign Policy and Inter­national Space” (see note 1), 471–76. On the institutional and substantive weaknesses in Taiwan’s exercise of soft power during Mas’s reign, see Gary D. Rawnsley, “Taiwan’s Soft Power and Public Diplomacy”, Journal of Current Chinese Affairs 43, no. 3 (2014): 161–74, https://journals.sub.uni-hamburg. de/giga/jcca/article/download/772/772-797-1-PB.pdf. One criti­cism here is that the ROC was presented to the outside world during this phase primarily as the preserver of traditional Chinese culture, rather than focusing on achievements such as peaceful democratisation.\n\n27\n\nWhen Tsai ran as a presidential candidate against Ma Ying-jeou in 2011, an Obama administration official had expressed concern about her ability to maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait. See Anna Fifield, Robin Kwong and Kathrin Hille, “US Concerned about Taiwan Candidate”, Financial Times, 15 September 2011, https://www.ft.com/ content/f926fd14-df93-11e0-845a-00144feabdc0. In 2015, Tsai again travelled to the US as a candidate and was able to dispel doubts about Taiwan’s reliability as a partner of the U.S. See Vincent Wei-cheng Wang and Jacques deLisle, “U.S.-Taiwan Relations: Continuity and Change in a Trian­gu­lar Dynamic”, in Taiwan in the Era of Tsai Ing-wen. Changes and Challenges, ed. Dreyer and deLisle (see note 19), 161–207 (161).\n\n28\n\nSee also deLisle, “Taiwan’s Quest for International Space in the Tsai Era” (see note 19), 257–66.\n\n29\n\nThe demand to be included in meetings, mechanisms and activities of the SDGs is one of the three pillars Taiwan mentions in its campaign in the UN in 2017.\n\n30\n\nTaiwan also has observer status in three OECD com­mittees (steel, competition and fisheries).

For example, the 9-dash line (originally 11-dash) in the South China Sea is based on a 1947 map.\n\n33\n\nOn this argument, see deLisle, “Taiwan’s Quest for Inter­national Space in the Tsai Era” (see note 19), 257–60.\n\n34\n\nSee Public Diplomacy Coordination Council/Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of China (Taiwan), “ROC Position on the South China Sea Arbitration”, 12 July 2016, https://en. mofa.gov.tw/News_Content.aspx?n=1EADDCFD4C6EC567&s= 5B5A9134709EB875.\n\n35\n\nSee Public Diplomacy Coordination Council/Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of China (Taiwan), “ROC Govern­ment Announces Details of 2017 Campaign for UN Partici­pation”, 11 September 2017, https://en.mofa.gov.tw/News_ Content.aspx?n=1328&s=33930.

The reason for this fear was the signing of an investment pact between Taiwan and Japan in September 2011.
