Americans will go red in the face if you mention ‘toilet’, so in absence of a bath, and when required to take a big, long, piss, or drop a bomb, many establishments will recourse to the ancient term ‘WC’ to denote a place you can relieve yourself without necessarily bathing.\n\nWhile we’re on the topic, I’d like to ask the origin of the term DM. In my previous job, people would always talk about getting DMs out.\n\nI’d correct them by saying that no foreigner would understand what that meant and that they should use brochure, pamphlet, or some such term.\n\nIs DM used anywhere outside of Taiwan? Does it stand for distributable/distributed material?\n\nWhy not just speak and write your natural way, whatever that may be, without any obnoxious effort to annoy anyone? :loco: People are more likely to react negatively to people who display obnoxious intent, as opposed to the style of the speech or writing per se. British English coming from friendly, socially well-adjusted individuals sounds quite lovely to my (semi-)American ears."
