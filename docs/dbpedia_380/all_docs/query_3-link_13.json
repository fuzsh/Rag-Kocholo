        "text": "Country names can change, but their country codes stay the same no matter what. This is why country codes are an important international standard. Groups like national postal organizations rely on the country code system to ensure everyone is talking about the same place. Our list of 2-letter and 3-letter country codes organized by continent will ensure you’re on the same page as the rest of the world.\n\nAll countries are represented by a 2-letter and 3-letter country code based on the International Naming Convention (ISO - International Organization for Standardization 3166). The 2-letter code is meant for more general purposes, while the 3-letter code more closely resembles the country’s name.\n\nThese short codes are intuitive, so they can be used as a universal and instant informative representation of each country. The abbreviations are used in postal services, world currencies, travel and business activities, and web address identification.\n\nWhile Antarctica is a continent, it is also just one country. There are, however, several islands in the Antarctic Region that can be considered part of the continent of Antarctica.\n\nCountry Name\n\n2-Letter (alpha 2 code)\n\n3-Letter (alpha 3 code)\n\nAntarctica\n\nAQ\n\nATA\n\nBouvet Island\n\nBV\n\nBVT\n\nFrench Southern Territories\n\nTF\n\nATF\n\nHeard Island and McDonald Islands\n\nHM\n\nHMD\n\nSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands\n\nGS\n\nSGS"
