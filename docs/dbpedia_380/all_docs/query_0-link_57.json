Its administrative powers have been transferred to the central and county governments.\n\nTaiwan Province covers approximately 69% of the actual-controlled territory of the Republic of China, with around 31% of the total population. The province initially included the island of Taiwan (Formosa), Penghu (the Pescadores), Orchid Island, Green Island, Xiaoliuqiu Island, and their surrounding islands. Between 1967 and 2014, six special municipalities (Kaohsiung, New Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei and Taoyuan) were split off from the province, all in the most populous regions.\n\nThe Taiwan Provincial Government was established in September 1945, after the Japanese rule. It was streamlined in December 1998, with administrative functions transferred to the National Development Council and other ministries of the Executive Yuan. In July 2018, the government was dissolved, with budget and personnel removed.\n\nGeography\n\nThe province is made up of most of the island of Taiwan, and also the Penghu islands. Even though the special municipalities of Kaoshiung, Tainan, New Taipei, and Taipei are all on Taiwan island, they are not part of Taiwan Province.\n\nGovernment\n\nThe province has a Provincial Council with 9 members, led by a Governor of Taiwan Province.\n\nDivisions\n\nProvincial cities\n\nChiayi City\n\nHsinchu City\n\nKeelung City\n\nCounties\n\nChanghua County\n\nChiayi County\n\nHsinchu County\n\nHualien County\n\nMiaoli County\n\nNantou County\n\nPenghu County\n\nPingtung County\n\nTaitung County\n\nTaoyuan County\n\nYilan County\n\nYunlin County\n\nImages for kids\n\nThe building of the Taiwan Provincial Government at Zhongxing New Village\n\nPrior to January 1, 2007 all vehicles registered in Taiwan Province carried the label \"Taiwan Province\" (台灣省) on their license plates.\n\nSee also"
