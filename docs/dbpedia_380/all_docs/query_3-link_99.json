        "text": "Guidelines for selecting keywords\n\nAn important part of submitting your thesis or dissertation is selecting keywords and subject categories. These elements become part of the information about your thesis or dissertation and will help other researchers to find your work.\n\nFollow these guidelines:\n\nYou must have at least one keyword. You can enter up to 6 keywords for your thesis or dissertation.\n\nCapitalize the first letter of keywords. If your keyword is a phrase, capitalize only the first letter of the first word, for example: Business administration. If your keyword is a proper name, capitalize the first letter of each word, for example: Mississippi River.\n\nUse full phrases rather than acronyms or abbreviations. For example, use Health Maintenance Organization rather than HMO.\n\nAdd a keyword if the concept or concepts covers at least 20% of your dissertation or thesis. Keywords should categorize your work as a whole, so focus on major concepts. It's OK to disregard minor aspects of your paper.\n\nAsk yourself what your dissertation or thesis is about. If you were searching for this topic, what keywords would help you find it?\n\nYou may need more than one keyword or keyword phrase to adequately cover a concept.\n\nKeywords may be a single word or several words. Keywords may include phrases.\n\nAvoid bringing out every single concept with separate keywords when broader keyword(s) or keyword phrase(s) will do.\n\nIf you have two or more keyword concepts that are equally important, assign multiple keywords.\n\nIt may be useful to browse the ProQuest Subject Categories list to help you think of keywords."
