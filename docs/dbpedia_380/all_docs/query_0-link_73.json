        "text": "What is a Taiwan GUI (Government Uniform Invoice)? All VAT-registered merchants in Taiwan must apply for the government’s preprinted invoice books. In general, only books printed by the government may be used to send invoices to clients. A corporation must request government pre-approval if it wants to use self-printed invoices. Any authorized self-printed invoice must be assigned a unique serial number.\n\nAny invoice sent from one business firm to another must include the counter entity’s Government Unified Invoice Number. A corporate entity’s identification number in Taiwan is typically seen as a Government Unified Invoice Number.\n\nThe government can track invoices sent from one company to another by managing the GUI serial numbers. In addition, the government has made it impossible for enterprises in Taiwan to underreport income by comparing VAT filings to income tax reports.\n\nAdditionally, the Taiwanese government has implemented a lottery system over GUI serial numbers to stop companies from understating income for transactions made with individuals. This technique is designed to promote the purchase of GUIs from sellers. Customers who purchased GUIs for non-commercial use can compare GUI serial numbers to determine the winning lottery numbers that the government will publish. The rotary’s grand prize is pegged at NTD 2 million.\n\nWhat Are the Five Kinds of Taiwan GUI?\n\nTaiwan’s version of a VAT invoice is known as a GUI and is produced and sold by the MOF. The Regulations Governing the Use of Uniform Invoices restrict the format, content, and use (Regulations). According to the Regulations, there are five different types of GUI:\n\n1. Triplicate GUI\n\nInvoices issued to business entities. For auditing and tracing, three copies are required.\n\nThe invoice issuer retains the first copy (called retention copy). The deduction copy (second copy) would be returned to the buyer a tax deduction or reduction declarations according to the provisions of the Act; the third copy shall be the receipt copy to be given to the purchaser as an accounting voucher.\n\n2. Duplicate GUI\n\nInvoices sent to individuals or overseas corporations. Two copies are required.\n\nThe duplicate style is similar to the Triplicate GUI. Only there are only two copies. The first copy is the retention copy, which is kept by the invoice issuer, and the second copy is the receipt copy, which is provided to the purchaser as a receipt. Even if your overseas clients do not want the duplicate GUI, you should issue it if you sell items or provide services to them.\n\n3. Cash register GUI\n\nReceipts generated via cash registers.\n\n4. Computerized Register GUI\n\nA company’s sales of goods or services are recorded on a computer.\n\n5. Electronic GUI\n\nWhen a business entity sells products or services to a purchaser, the GUI must be issued, sent, or accessed through the internet or other electronic means; there must be a storage media file, a receipt media file, and a certification media file.\n\nHow And When Will I Obtain the Issuance of the GUI Tax Invoice?\n\nWhen you make a purchase in Taiwan, the seller is obligated by law to assess and collect VAT and send you a standardized invoice document known as a Government Uniform Invoice (GUI or eGUI).\n\nThe “Time Limit for Issuing Sales Documentary Evidence” part of Taiwan’s “Value-added and Non-value-added Business Tax Act” specifies this requirement. The invoice content is regulated and standardized for all firms.\n\nFollowing your purchase online, the seller will probably send your eGUI to the email address associated with your account. Save this email so you can quickly access your invoice number.\n\nContact the seller if you want your GUI delivered to a different email address.\n\nEach GUI comes with an invoice number that you may use to enter the Taiwan GUI lottery. To participate, utilize the Taiwan Ministry of Finance’s “Claiming Reward App” and “E-Invoice platform” to register your email address and sign up for lottery result alerts.\n\nIf you cancel your order and receive a refund, your Taiwan GUI will be invalid and ineligible for the drawing. The seller will provide you with a reimbursement receipt.\n\nDifference Between Business and Individual eGUI Tax Invoice\n\nThe eGUI tax invoice is a legal document issued when a company sells products or services to customers. The eGUI is a tax invoice issued, transferred, or received electronically over the Internet or other means.\n\nThe “Business” eGUI, which can be used as a tax certificate for accounting purposes, is issued with the purchasers’ business registration number.\n\nDespite not receiving the buyers’ company registration number, the “Individual” eGUI is still eligible for the lottery.\n\nCircumstances that are not required to issue GUI\n\nThere are also circumstances in which the seller is not required to issue a GUI to its clients, such as small-scale business entities, banks, insurance companies, exporting products or services.\n\nAs there are lots of details and regulations, it is suggested that you should check with the tax expert like Premia TNC before you start the work.\n\nFAQS on Taiwan GUI"
