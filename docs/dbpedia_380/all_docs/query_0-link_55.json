        "text": "Senders are required to use a pre-registered alphabetic Sender ID. To request a Sender ID from AWS Support, Open an AWS End User Messaging SMS support case to request a sender ID. Some countries require senders to meet specific requirements or abide by certain restrictions in order to obtain approval. In these cases, AWS Support might contact you for additional information after you submit your Sender ID request.\n\nSenders are required to use a pre-registered template for each type of message that they plan to send. If a sender doesnât meet this requirement, their messages will be blocked. To register a template, China SMS template registration process. Some countries require senders to meet additional, specific requirements or abide by certain restrictions in order to obtain approval. In these cases, AWS Support might ask you for additional information.\n\nNote\n\nIn order to send messages to China, you must first register your templates through AWS Support for approval.\n\nSenders are required to use a pre-registered alphabetic Sender ID. Additional registration steps are required. For more information, see India sender ID registration process.\n\nLong codes in these countries only support inbound messaging. In other words, you can't use these long codes to send messages to your recipients, but you can use them to receive messages from your recipients. These long codes are useful way to allow your recipients to opt-out if you send messages using an alphabetic Sender ID, because Sender IDs only support outbound messages.\n\nAWS End User Messaging SMS can send SMS traffic to Singapore using a sender ID that has been registered on the Singapore SMS Sender ID Registry (SSIR), a registry created by the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) of Singapore. For more information on requirements to use a Singapore Sender ID, see Singapore registration process. You can also send SMS traffic in Singapore using an alternative origination identity types such as Short Codes or Long Codes.\n\nIf you do not register your sender ID any message sent using a sender ID will have its ID changed to LIKELY-SCAM per regulatory agency rules. Regulators will filter or block unregistered traffic at their discretion.\n\nWithout a dedicated short code, AWS End User Messaging SMS still attempts to send messages to New Zealand recipients using a shared pool of short codes. Due to local carrier restrictions around shared numbers, deliverability over these shared numbers are made on a best-effort basis. Therefore, AWS End User Messaging SMS highly recommends procuring a dedicated short code for all traffic being sent to New Zealand. Messages containing URLs must be allow-listed through the dedicated short code process. For more information on purchasing a short code, see How to request short codes for messaging."
