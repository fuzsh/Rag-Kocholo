        "text": "Entry for Taiwan in ISO 3166-2\n\nISO 3166-2:TW is the entry for Taiwan,[1] \"Taiwan, Province of China\",[2] or \"Taiwan (Province of China)\",[3] in ISO 3166-2, part of the ISO 3166 standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which defines codes for the names of the principal subdivisions (e.g., provinces or states) of all countries coded in ISO 3166-1.\n\nISO 3166-2:TW defines codes for the subdivisions of Taiwan located on the islands of Taiwan (Formosa), Penghu (Pescadores), Kinmen, Matsu (Lienchiang), and their subsidiary islands. These areas are de facto under the administration of the government of the Republic of China which resides in Taipei. The government of the People's Republic of China, which resides in Beijing, also claims these islands but considers ROC-held Fujian islands of Kinmen and Matsu to be within its Fujian Province,[4] not its nominal Taiwan Province (ISO 3166-2 code: CN-TW).\n\nCurrently ISO 3166-2:TW lists 13 counties, 3 cities, and 6 special municipalities. Constitutionally the counties and cities are part of the ROC provinces of Taiwan and Fujian, but since the provincial governments were largely streamlined in 1998 these 22 subdivisions are regarded as the principal subdivisions of Republic of China (Taiwan).\n\nFormat\n\n[edit]\n\nEach code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is TW, the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code of Taiwan. The second part is three letters.\n\nThe divisions in the list are categorized in three types:\n\nCities: Romanized as shih (市) and formerly called \"municipalities\" in ISO 3166-2. The divisions carry City (市) in their official names.\n\nCounties: Romanized as hsien (縣) and formerly called \"districts\" in ISO 3166-2. The divisions carry County (縣) in their official names.\n\nSpecial municipalities: Romanized as chih-hsia-shih (直轄市). The divisions also carry City (市) in their official names.\n\nTaiwan is currently assigned the ISO 3166-2 code CN-TW under ISO 3166-2:CN, as China solely claims it as a province of China.\n\nCurrent codes\n\n[edit]\n\nSubdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).\n\nCode Subdivision name (zh)\n\n(conventional names) Subdivision name (zh)\n\n[note 1] Subdivision category TW-CHA Changhua 彰化 county TW-CYI Chiayi 嘉義 city TW-CYQ Chiayi 嘉義 county TW-HSZ Hsinchu 新竹 city TW-HSQ Hsinchu 新竹 county TW-HUA Hualien 花蓮 county TW-KHH Kaohsiung 高雄 special municipality TW-KEE Keelung 基隆 city TW-KIN Kinmen 金門 county TW-LIE Lienchiang 連江 county TW-MIA Miaoli 苗栗 county TW-NAN Nantou 南投 county TW-NWT New Taipei 新北 special municipality TW-PEN Penghu 澎湖 county TW-PIF Pingtung 屏東 county TW-TXG Taichung 臺中 special municipality TW-TNN Tainan 臺南 special municipality TW-TPE Taipei 臺北 special municipality TW-TTT Taitung 臺東 county TW-TAO Taoyuan 桃園 special municipality TW-ILA Yilan 宜蘭 county TW-YUN Yunlin 雲林 county\n\nNotes\n\nChanges\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following changes to the entry have been announced by the ISO 3166/MA since the first publication of ISO 3166-2 in 1998. ISO stopped issuing newsletters in 2013.\n\nNewsletter/OBP Date issued Description of change in newsletter Code/Subdivision change Newsletter I-4 2002-12-10 Error correction: Duplicate use of six code elements corrected.
