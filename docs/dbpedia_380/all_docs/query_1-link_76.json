        "text": "OCCAR is FMS-eligible only to act as an agent on behalf of one or more FMS-eligible Principal countries. LOA attributes that are normally fixed by country, such as Dependable Undertaking status, Contract Administrative Services (CAS) waivers and Congressional Notifications thresholds and periods, are established by applying the most restrictive attribute required for any of the co-Principals purchasing on the LOA. DSCA (Office of Business Operations, Financial Policy & Regional Execution Directorate, Financial Policy Division (OBO/FPRE/FP)) determines SCCC 7B attributes for each OCCAR LOA on a case-by-case basis."
