        "text": "About WWOOF\n\nWWOOF is an acronym which stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms. This cultural exchange allows members from all around the world that are interested in learning about Organic farms to volunteer their services by working at Host establishments. These members called, WWOOFers, will be given the opportunity to work on Organic farms with their WWOOF host in exchange for housing and food. Through this experience, WWOOFers will learn about farming practices and gain skills necessary for Organic farming.\n\nBecome a WWOOFer\n\nBy offering your services to your WWOOF hosts in exchange for accommodation and meals, you will be given the chance of a lifetime to learn...\n\nLearn More\n\nBecome a Host\n\nWhat is a WWOOF Host? A farmer or grower wishing to host WWOOFers (visitors) and teach them about sustainable agriculture. ​WWOOF Taiwan publishes a host directory...\n\nLearn More\n\nWWOOF history\n\nWWOOF was started in England in 1971 by Mrs. Sue Coppard as a way to increase awareness of farms in the countryside by providing opportunities for people in London to work for the weekend. Eventually, the demand for longer periods increased and the name was changed from Working Weekends on Organic Farms to Willing Workers on Organic Farms. Since then, WWOOF has expanded worldwide with many National Organizations and Independents. There have been some cultural misunderstandings around the use of the word “work”. As a result, in 2000, the meaning of WWOOF was been changed from 'Willing Workers' to 'World Wide' Opportunities on Organic Farms."
