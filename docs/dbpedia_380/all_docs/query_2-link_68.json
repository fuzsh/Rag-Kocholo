        "text": "Individual income tax (IIT) is levied on Taiwan-sourced income of both resident and non-resident individuals, unless exempt under the provisions of the Income Tax Act and other laws.\n\nIndividual income tax (IIT) rates\n\nA non-resident alien residing in Taiwan for less than 90 days in a calendar year is subject to 18% withholding tax (WHT) on salary remuneration received from a Taiwan-registered entity. Remuneration received from an entity registered outside of Taiwan is tax exempted.\n\nA non-resident alien residing in Taiwan for more than 90 days but less than 183 days in a calendar year is subject to tax at a flat rate of 18% on Taiwan taxable salary income, regardless of where the remuneration is paid.\n\nA resident alien is subject to the following progressive tax rates for 2022 IIT return filing:\n\nTaxable income (TWD) Tax rate (%) Less progressive difference (TWD) Over Not over 0 560,000 5 0 560,001 1,260,000 12 39,200 1,260,001 2,520,000 20 140,000 2,520,001 4,720,000 30 392,000 4,720,001 and above 40 864,000\n\nIncome basic tax (IBT)\n\nIn addition to regular income tax calculations under the Income Tax Act, Taiwan also imposes IBT, at a flat rate of 20%, on individuals who are tax residents in Taiwan (including expatriates who stay in Taiwan for 183 days or more in a tax year). Foreign-sourced income is included in the calculation of IBT if the following criteria are met:\n\nThe individual is a tax resident of Taiwan.\n\nForeign-sourced income is equal to or more than TWD 1 million with basic income exceeding TWD 6.7 million.\n\nUnder the IBT Act, a taxpayer must calculate the amount of IBT due on income subject to IBT after adding back certain items and compare the result with the regular income tax payable. If the IBT payable is greater than the regular income tax payable, the taxpayer has to calculate and pay IBT based on the following formula:\n\nIncome subject to IBT = Regular taxable income + add-back items\n\nIBT = (Income subject to IBT - TWD 6.7 million) x 20%\n\nThe add-back items include qualified insurance benefits, income derived from transaction of beneficiary certificates of privately placed securities investment trust funds, non-cash charitable donations, and foreign-sourced income totalling TWD 1 million or more.\n\nNote that although the inclusion of foreign-sourced income increases the IBT burden, any foreign taxes paid on foreign-sourced income may be credited against IBT payable, with certain limitations."
