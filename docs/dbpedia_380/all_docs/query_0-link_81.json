        "text": "​From the Editor\n\nAnnouncement: The Journal of Nursing Research (JNR) has grown significantly over the past 30 years, becoming more international and having an increasing impact on nursing care. As the second official journal of the Taiwan Nurses' Association, JNR was launched as a Chinese-only publication in 1993. Reflecting the strong commitment of its editorial staff to enhancing nursing science and healthcare worldwide, JNR began publishing in English in June 2001. The dedication of its editorial board and worldwide network of reviewers and researchers earned JNR's indexing in Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) in 2012 and increasing recognition as an internationally respected nursing journal.\n\nAs an SCI- and SSCI-indexed journal, JNR has seen its influence on the international nursing society grow in its rising readership and growing submissions base. To enhance international knowledge dissemination and interactions, JNR has operated as an open-access, article-processing-charge-free academic journal since 2019. Through multifaceted efforts and rigorous review, JNR today has a proven impact, with a readership spanning nearly 200 countries. The success of JNR is also shown in its impact factor, indicating a growing number of JNR citations in the literature. JNR is continuing to grow and improve and is expected to be one of the top journals contributing to nursing science and the healthcare system in the next decade.\n\nCall for Papers: The Taiwan Nurses Association has published The Journal of Nursing Research (JNR) in English since June 2001 as a vehicle to expand the Association’s international perspective and promote academic exchange with nursing professionals overseas. As editor of JNR, I welcome the submission of manuscripts of relevance and interest to those concerned with the conduct or results of nursing-related research. You are encouraged to submit original articles addressing research into the practice, theory, or philosophy of nursing. All articles published in JNR will be peer-reviewed. Please e-mail the journal editorial office: [email protected]\n\nSincerely,\n\nYeur-Hur Lai\n\nYea-Ing Lotus Shyu\n\nEditor-in-Chief, The Journal of Nursing Research\n\nTaiwan Nurses Association\n\nwww.twna.org.tw"
