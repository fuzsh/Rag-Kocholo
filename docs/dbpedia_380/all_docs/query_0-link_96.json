        "text": "What is TAA Compliance?\n\n(Updated: February 2024 )\n\nHow do you know if you are TAA Compliant? TAA refers to the Trade Agreement Act. Under 19 USC 2501 Trade Agreements Act government agencies may only purchase US-made or designated country end products or US or designated country services.\n\nAre Your Products on GSA Schedule TAA Compliant?\n\nBecause the estimated value of a GSA schedule exceeds $183,000, all GSA product sales must be Trade Agreement Act (TAA) compliant, as per FAR 52.225-5. In order to be TAA compliant, products must be “wholly the growth, product, or manufacture” or be substantially transformed in a TAA compliant country.\n\nHowever, precedence was set in 2020, when a federal circuit court ruled on the definition of “US-Made End Products” under the TAA. The case was Acetris Health, L.L.C. v. United States, In this ruling, the court stated that under the TAA US-Made End Products were simply products “manufactured” in the US, essentially making it easier to qualify as US-Made End Products under TAA than it would be under BAA.\n\nWe would still recommend proceeding with caution as the court ruling has not changed FAR definitions yet. If you offer services through your GSA Schedule, the TAA may also apply to you; but that is not always the case. The issue of how the TAA applies to services is a complex one.\n\nHow to Determine if products were “Substantially Transformed?”\n\nIf a product is completely manufactured in the United States or in a TAA designated country, you are TAA compliant. Software country of origin is determined in the country where the software was compiled.\n\nSometimes a product requires assembly in several countries or has components from various countries; the TAA compliance becomes murkier and a determination of where the product is substantially transformed is required. If a product is manufactured in various countries, the final product must be “substantially transformed” in a designated country. Substantial transformation would be transforming an article into a new and different article of commerce, with a name, character, or use distinct from the original article. (refer to FAR 25.001(c))\n\nResponsibility falls wholly on the government contractor, to determine if a product has been substantially transformed. More information on International Trade: Rules of Origin available here: http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL34524.pdf.\n\nWho Makes the Determination of TAA Compliance?\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection states that “the responsibility for making a determination of substantial transformation rests solely with the contractor. The contractor can go to The Office of Regulations and Rulings within U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is the Federal agency responsible for making substantial transformation determinations or giving their opinions.”\n\nHow to Keep Your GSA Schedule TAA Compliant?\n\nFirst you must have a system in place that periodically verifies that the products being offered under your GSA schedule are TAA compliant. Furthermore, if you are not a manufacturer, we recommend that you verify countries of origin quarterly or, at minimum, with catalog updates from your suppliers to verify that products are still being manufactured or “substantially transformed” in a TAA designated country.\n\nIf your manufacturing source changes during the term of your contract and items are now manufactured in a non-designated country, your products will consequently be out of compliance. You must immediately take action to remove the non-TAA compliant items from your GSA Schedule. A GSA consultant from the Coley team can assist with getting this processed."
