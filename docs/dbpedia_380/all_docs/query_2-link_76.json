It is based on ISO 4.\n\nISO 4 is an international standard which defines a uniform system for the abbreviation of serial titles, i.e., titles of publications such as scientific journals. The ISSN International Centre, which the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has appointed as the registration authority for ISO 4, maintains the “List of Title Word Abbreviations”, which are standard abbreviations for words commonly found in serial titles.\n\nOne major use of ISO 4 is to abbreviate the names of scientific journals in citations. For instance, when citing a paper from the European Physical Journal, the ISO 4 standard prescribes the abbreviation “Eur. Phys. J.”\n\nLTWA includes more than 56,000 words and their abbreviations in 65 languages.\n\nThese abbreviated words serve as the basis for constituting “abbreviated key titles” published in the ISSN Register.\n\nThe List of title word abbreviations contains:\n\nthe title words of periodicals identified by the ISSN Network, and\n\nthe corresponding abbreviations.\n\nWhat purpose does it serve?\n\nThe use of standardized abbreviations is essential to obtain correct and validated scientific and technical citations.\n\nWho is the author of this list?\n\nThe ISSN Network creates the abbreviations in the List of Title Word Abbreviations. The ISSN National Centres abbreviate the words in their country’s languages.\n\nThe ISSN International Centre also maintains the List of Title Word Abbreviations, checking the validity of abbreviations with the help of linguists.\n\nIn accordance with the scope of this standard, the abbreviations can also be used for titles of non-serial publications.\n\nView the LTWA\n\nClick on the letter corresponding to your search or enter a word in the field provided for this purpose.\n\nDownload the LTWA"
