The second table contains the same information in a continuous alphabetical list. In both lists, each place name is accompanied by a three-letter abbreviation indicating the administrative district where the place is located (although that is redundant in Table 1).\n\nSpellings:Taiwan is notoriously inaccurate and inconsistent in Romanized spellings of Chinese names. The only spellings used here follow internationally standard Hanyu Pinyin system, so if you go from a printed source, you may need to do some creative reinterpretation to locate the name in this list. Parts of cities called ânorth district,â âsouth district,â or the like have been omitted in the tables.\n\nMap: The simple map at the top of this page and of the two pages of tables is a link to a separate page with official spellings of major place names (link). On that page a printer-friendly copy is available by clicking on the map.\n\nSource: The information in the tables are derived from the 1985 printing of Taiwan's zip code directory (YÃ³udÃ¬ QÅ«hÃ o YÄ«lÇnbiÇo éµéåèä¸è¦½è¡¨ / é®éåºå·ä¸è§è¡¨). They include about 400 names of municipalities (shÃ¬ å¸) and counties (xiÃ n ç¸£ / å¿) and of their immediately subordinate districts, xiÄng é / ä¹¡, zhÃ¨n é® / é, and qÅ« å / åº. The first three digits of the 5-digit zip codes are also included here, since they occasionally help in locating a name on the map.\n\nChanges: Taiwan places have undergone many changes of name and status both before and after 1985, but the 1985 name set is probably the most useful one for most students of Taiwan history. The terms xiÃ n, xiÄng, and zhÃ¨n are left untranslated. The term shÃ¬ is sometimes left untranslated, sometimes translated as âcity.â Without these suffixes, the same name may be applied both to a rural xiÄng and to an urban qÅ«, say. But as long as these suffixes are included there are no duplicate place names in Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan Place Names: The Basic Scheme\n\nProvince & Province-Level Municipalities (Cities): For most of the last half century or so, TÃ¡ibÄi èºå / å°å and GÄoxiÃ³ng é«é have had the status of âspecial municipalities,â which meant that administratively they were at the same level as a province and technically were no longer part of Taiwan Province. (However their hinterlands remained within the province as xiÃ n.)\n\nXiÃ n & XiÃ n-Level Municipalities (Cities): The remainder of Taiwan was divided into cantons or counties called XiÃ n ç¸£ / å¿. The hinterlands around the special municipalities were also xiÃ n. For example, there is not only a GÄoxiÃ³ng City, but also a GÄoxiÃ³ng XiÃ n. In addition, on the analogy of the province-level âspecial municipalities,â three smaller cities âJÄ«lÃ³ng åºé, TÃ¡izhÅng èºä¸­ / å°ä¸­, and TÃ¡inÃ¡n èºå / å°å â received the status of xiÃ n-level special municipalities. Of the three, only JÄ«lÃ³ng did not have a hinterland with the same name lying outside of municipal jurisdiction.\n\nUrban Districts & Neighborhoods: Cities are divided into districts or qÅ« å / åº, which in turn are divided into neighborhoods neighborhoods (lÇ é) and/or streets.\n\nRural ZhÃ¨n and XiÄng: The counties or xiÃ n were in turn subdivided into two kinds of rural units called zhÃ¨n é® / é and xiÄng é / ä¹¡.\n\nThe difference between the two kinds of rural districts, the zhÃ¨n and the xiÄng, is of little importance to most people, but technically zhÃ¨n are entirely comprised of neighborhoods called lÇ é (sometimes subdivided into lÃ­n é° / é»), while xiÄng are directly administered by a xiÄng government, but contain bounded cÅ«n æ or villages with \"unincorporated\" space between them. Most people think of zhÃ¨n as more heavily populated, âmore urban,â than xiÄng, but that is not always the case.\n\nRecent Changes\n\nA map of Taiwan before 1945 would have had Japanese names. A map before 1895 would have had Chinese names, but often not the same names used today. And naturally as population increased over the centuries, administrative units and place names multiplied. The process continues.\n\nTÃ¡inÃ¡n: In 2010, TÃ¡inÃ¡n City, formerly a xiÃ n-level special municipality, absorbed TÃ¡inÃ¡n XiÃ n and was elevated to join TÃ¡ibÄi and GÄoxiÃ³ng as a province-level special municipality. In geographical area, it instantly became the largest of the three, and TÃ¡inÃ¡n XiÃ n has now officially ceased to exist.\n\nThe change of status of TÃ¡inÃ¡n XiÃ n in 2010 means that its many former xiÄng and zhÃ¨n are now urban qÅ«. These changes are NOT reflected in the present table and they are recent enough that it is unlikely they will be reflected in most of your reading materials.\n\nNew TÃ¡ibÄi: Shortly afterward, also in 2010, TÃ¡ibÄi XiÃ n was redefined as a special municipality (displacing TÃ¡inÃ¡n as the largest) and renamed XÄ«nbÄi ShÃ¬ æ°åå¸ \"New North City\" in Chinese. The official English name is \"New Taipei City\" (to avoid a spelling with the \"Communist\" letters X and B in the originally proposed English transcription as \"Xinbei City\"). As with TÃ¡inÃ¡n XiÃ n's conversion into a special municipality, this resulted in former xiÄng and zhÃ¨n in TÃ¡ibÄi XiÃ n being redefined as urban qÅ«. Once again, these changes are NOT reflected in the present table and they are recent enough that it is unlikely they will be reflected in most of your reading materials.\n\nReturn to top."
