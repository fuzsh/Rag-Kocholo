        "text": "1. Summary of the standard’s use for government\n\nThis standard enables anyone creating or searching government datasets to use a list of accurate and consistent country codes.\n\nYou should use 2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes. For the UK, use the following extended codes:\n\nGB-ENG for England\n\nGB-NIR for Northern Ireland\n\nGB-SCT for Scotland\n\nGB-WLS or GB-CYM for Wales\n\nThe government chooses standards using the open standards approval process and the Open Standards Board has final approval. Read more about the process of choosing the country codes standard.\n\n2. How this standard meets user needs\n\nThe users are government workers who need to record, search, reuse or exchange data which has worldwide geographical information. The systems that hold this data need to use accurate country information to provide consistent data between systems.\n\nUsers of this standard include:\n\npublishers of government data\n\ndata scientists\n\ndata analysts\n\ndevelopers\n\nHaving multiple names and spelling for countries can cause inconsistencies across different data sets. The country codes standard reduces this problem by using a uniform way to identify countries.\n\nOther benefits of this standard include:\n\nimproving the quality of data\n\nreducing duplication of resources and effort\n\nreducing ambiguity caused by alternative names for a country\n\n3. How to use the standard\n\nThe list of countries published in ISO 3166 currently contains 249 countries. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s (FCO) Geographical names index, is a subset of ISO 3166 and currently lists 195 countries that are officially recognised by the UK.\n\nIn addition to the country code for each country, the ISO 3166 standard also has:\n\nthe English name\n\nthe indigenous name\n\nany common aliases\n\nthe dates during which the codes were/are valid\n\nYou can use the dates to tell which countries or country codes no longer exist. For example, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) has an end-date of `1991-12-25’.\n\nThe ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency regularly updates the country codes based on information from the United Nations. The agency sends notifications of any changes they make to the standard so you can download the latest version.\n\nAlthough ISO 3166 is usually backwards compatible, if a code remains unused for 15 years the ISO standard might reuse it to represent another country. This means you should consider country codes as temporary, especially when you’re using the code to infer borders, flags, political structure, and other attributes of the country."
