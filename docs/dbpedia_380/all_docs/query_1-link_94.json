The term “laser” originated as an acronym for “light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.” A laser differs from other light sources in that it emits light coherently, spatially, and temporally. Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused on a tight spot, enabling laser cutting and lithography applications laser cutting and lithography. Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers. Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum, i.e., they can emit a single color of light. Temporal coherence can produce pulses of light as short as a femtosecond. Used: for military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed.” (Wiki-L, 2018)\n\nLaWS Laser weapon system\n\nLED- Light emitting diodes\n\nLENS Laser-engineered net shaping\n\nLDEF Long Duration Exposure Facility\n\nLGF Low Gradient Furnace\n\nLiDAR Light Detection and Ranging – a RS method using light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges\n\nLOS Line-of-sight / Loss of Signal / Loss of Separation\n\nLLTR Low-level transit route\n\nLM or L.M.

GPS Spoofing is an attack to provide false information to GPS receivers by broadcasting counterfeit signals similar to the original GPS signal or by recording the original GPS signal captured somewhere else at some other time and then retransmitting the signal. The Spoofing Attack causes GPS receivers to provide the wrong information about position\n\nand time. (T.E.

K., 2020)\n\nAsymmetric warfare can describe a conflict in which the resources of two belligerents differ in essence and, in the struggle, interact and attempt to exploit each other’s characteristic weaknesses. Such struggles often involve strategies and tactics of unconventional warfare, the weaker combatants attempting to use strategy to offset deficiencies in quantity or quality of their forces and equipment. (Thomas, 2010) Such strategies may not necessarily be militarized. (Steponova, 2016)\n\nThis contrasts with symmetric warfare, where two powers have comparable military power and resources and rely on similar tactics, differing only in details and execution. (Thomas, 2010)\n\nFalse Flag Operation – organized spreading of misinformation or disinformation.\n\nEichelberger Collective Detection (ECD) Definitions / Counter Spoofing Concepts\n\nAcquisition – Acquisition is the process in a GPS receiver that finds the visible satellite signals and detects the delays of the PRN sequences and the Doppler shifts of the signals.\n\nCircular Cross-Correlation (CCC) – In a GPS classical receiver, the circular cross-correlation is a similarity measure between two vectors of length N, circularly shifted by a given displacement d:\n\nN-1\n\nCxcorr (a, b , d) = ∑ ai dot bI + d mod N Eq. 3-1\n\nI=0\n\nThe two vectors are most similar at the displacement d, where the sum (CCC value) is maximum. The vector of CCC values with all N displacements can be efficiently computed by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) in Ớ ( N log N ) time. [3](Eichelberger, Robust Global Localization using GPS and Aircraft Signals, 2019)\n\nLike classical GPS receivers, coarse-Time Navigation (CTN) is a snapshot receiver localization technique that measures sub-millisecond satellite ranges from correlation peaks. (IS-GPS-200G, 2013) [See also expanded definition above.]\n\nCollective Detection (CD) is a maximum likelihood snapshot receiver localization method, which does not determine the arrival time for each satellite but combines all the available information and decides only at the end of the computation. This technique is critical to the (Eichelberger, Robust Global Localization using GPS and Aircraft Signals, 2019) invention to mitigate spoofing attacks on GPS or ADS-B.\n\nCoordinate System – A coordinate system uses an ordered list of coordinates to uniquely describe the location of points in space. The meaning of the coordinates is defined concerning some anchor points. The point with all coordinates being zero is called the origin. [ Examples: terrestrial, Earth-centered, Earth-fixed, ellipsoid, equator, meridian longitude, latitude, geodetic latitude, geocentric latitude, and geoid. [4]\n\nLocalization – Process of determining an object’s place concerning some reference, usually coordinate systems. [aka Positioning or Position Fix]\n\nNavigation Data is the data transmitted from satellites, which includes orbit parameters to determine the satellite locations, timestamps of signal transmission, atmospheric delay estimations, and status information of the satellites and GPS as a whole, such as the accuracy and validity of the data. (IS-GPS-200G, 2013) [5]\n\nPseudo-Random Noise (PRN) sequences are pseudo-random bit strings. Each GPS satellite uses a unique PRN sequence with a length of 1023 bits for its signal transmissions. aka as Gold codes, they have a low cross-correlation with each other. (IS-GPS-200G, 2013)\n\nSnapshot GPS Receiver– A snapshot receiver is a global positioning satellite (GPS) receiver that captures one or a few milliseconds of raw GPS signal for a location fix. (Diggelen, 2009)\n\nClassification of Satellites\n\nSatellites are classified in terms of their purpose and are classified as follows:\n\nAstronomical satellites – observation of distant planets and galaxies;\n\nBiosatellites – carry living organisms to aid scientific experiments;\n\nCommunication satellites – communications satellites use geosynchronous or Low Earth orbits to communicate with each other and other systems;\n\nEarth observation satellites (EOS) are satellites intended for non-military uses such as environmental monitoring, meteorology, and producing maps;\n\nKiller satellites are designed to destroy warheads, satellites, and space-based objects;\n\nNavigational satellites use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location. The relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real-time;\n\nReconnaissance satellites are communications satellites deployed for military or intelligence applications;\n\nRecovery satellites provide a recovery of reconnaissance, biological, space-production, and other payloads from orbit to Earth;\n\nSpace stations are orbital structures designed for human beings to live in space. A space station is distinguished from other crewed spacecraft by its lack of major propulsion or landing facilities. Space stations are designed for medium-term living in orbit;\n\nTether satellites are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a tether; and\n\nWeather satellites are used to monitor Earth’s weather and climate.\n\nSatellite Orbits\n\nThe most common type of orbit is a geocentric orbit, with over 3,000 active artificial satellites orbiting the Earth. Geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude, inclination, and eccentricity.\n\nThe commonly used altitude classifications of the geocentric orbit are Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO), and High Earth Orbit (HEO). Low Earth Orbit is any orbit below 2,000 km, Medium Earth Orbit is any orbit between 2,000 and 36,000 km, and High Earth Orbit is greater than 36,000 km. LLO: low lunar orbit is approximately 100 km above the lunar surface. L1 and L2: “Lagrange points are caused by the balance between the gravitational fields of two large bodies; equilibria between two pulling forces.\n\nCentric classifications\n\nA galactocentric orbit is an orbit around the center of a galaxy.\n\nA heliocentric orbit is an orbit around the Sun. In our Solar System, all planets, comets, and asteroids are in such orbits, as are many artificial satellites and pieces of space debris.\n\nGeocentric orbit is an orbit around Earth, such as the Moon or artificial satellites. Currently, there are over 2,500 active artificial satellites orbiting the Earth.\n\nAltitude classifications\n\nLow Earth Orbit (LEO): Geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 180 km – to 2,000 km;\n\nMedium Earth Orbit (MEO): Geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 2,000 km – to 20,000 km;\n\nGeosynchronous Orbit (GEO): Geocentric circular orbit with an altitude of 36,000 km. The orbit period equals one sidereal day, which coincides with the Earth’s rotation period. The speed is 3,075 m/s (10,090 ft/s).\n\nHigh Earth orbit (HEO): Geocentric orbits above the altitude of a geosynchronous orbit (GEO) > 36,000 km (~ 40,000 km).\n\nAgroterrorism / Bioterrorism Definitions\n\nAgroterrorism is a subset of bioterrorism and is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal or plant disease to generate fear, causing economic losses and/or undermining stability. (O.S. Cupp, 2004)\n\nBioterrorism is the threat or use of biological agents by individuals or groups motivated by political, religious, ecological, or other ideological objectives.\n\nEarth Observation Epidemiology or tele-epidemiology is defined as ‘using space technology with remote sensing in epidemiology. (Wiki, 2022)\n\nMASINT – Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) is a technical branch of intelligence gathering that detect, track, identify or describe the distinctive characteristics (signatures) of fixed or dynamic target sources. This often includes radar, acoustic, nuclear, chemical, and biological intelligence. MASINT is scientific and technical intelligence derived from the analysis of data obtained from sensing instruments to identify any distinctive features associated with the source, emitter, or sender, to facilitate the latter’s measurement and identification. (Wiki, 2022)\n\nOSI, short for OPEN-SOURCE Intelligence (also known as OSINT), is defined as any intelligence produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience to address a specific intelligence requirement. (Bazzell, 2021)\n\nRemote Sensing (RS) uses non-ground-based imaging systems to obtain information about processes and events on Earth. It is unique among the detection and diagnostic methods discussed herein in its ability to offer passive monitoring for the disease at scale rather than active sampling.
