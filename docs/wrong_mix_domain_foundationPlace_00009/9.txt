Is art relevant to society?

EMMA, the Espoo Museum of Modern Art, is home to part of the Saastamoinen Foundation Art Collection, with more than 2,600 works in all. The Saastamoinen Foundation acquired Olafur Eliasson’s Pentagonal mirror tunnel specifically for EMMA. The museum then presented Eliasson’s Pentagonal Landscapes, in close cooperation with the artist.

Olafur Eliasson is a highly influential Danish-Icelandic artist. His work explores the relationship between people and their surroundings. The Pentagonal Landscapes collection explores light, optics, mirrors, architecture, orientation and landscape. Eliasson strives to make art relevant to society. Art, for him, is a crucial means for turning thinking into doing in the real world.

Identity from geometry

The Kuudes graphic identity for Pentagonal Landscapes is fluid and liquid. It was inspired by geometry, architecture and Peter Saville’s iconic Joy Division album cover artwork. The graphics for invitations, posters, leaflets, books and exhibition signage feature a logo based on Eliasson’s pentagonal mirrors.

The graphics combine the earthy and vivid colour world of the artist with grey tones that reflect the striking concrete of the EMMA museum building. Colourful landscapes are combined with laminated mirror foil that references the main Pentagonal mirror tunnel artwork. The successful creation of the identity was supported by open collaboration throughout the team. The result is an identity that fits the context and content.
