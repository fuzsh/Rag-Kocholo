For navprayukti, being a bootstrapped startup on extremely low seed money, things have been tough from day one. On top of that considering my hardware background, we wanted to build a fully functional embedded IoT lab from day one to work on hardware projects. This meant we had to allocate funds for components kits, tools, test equipment etc. While I did have some amount of low level software and firmware experience, I have always been more comfortable developing hardware. Now things were different. We also decided to build IoT solutions with a lot of emphasis on cloud infrastructure as well. And being in-charge of all the technology related things, I had to quickly understand a lot things that hitherto didn't feature in my dictionary. Things like #mernstack, #s3 , #rdbms , #azurecloud , various network protocols (#mqtt , #rtsp , #zmq, #restfulapi s), Cloud Architecture methodologies, SaaS revenue models, and so on and so forth. Every project now opens a door to new possibilities of learning and I continuously feel privileged to be learning from our young colleagues who bring in a lot of passion and aspiration even though everyone either belongs to a tier-2 city like #guwahati or even smaller, remote towns. We all want to work from a place that is closer to our homes and yet fulfill aspirations. Is it so hard? Even if it is, we would like to try and make this a possibility for us and our future generations. Here in #northeastindia , we have all gone through times of strife and it is time for that to change. We will still struggle to meet our revenue (and growth) targets at times. So while I do miss the days of financial comfort through my regular paycheck (at times), I seem to enjoy these times much more. PS: I'm typing this after doing a simple POC of a real-time RF-based end-to-end publisher-subscriber based messaging system that I've been working on for about three weeks now. Planning to move part of the embedded PHY into an FPGA next. Fingers crossed. So much fun! #cloudcomputing #iot #startuplife #assamstartup"
