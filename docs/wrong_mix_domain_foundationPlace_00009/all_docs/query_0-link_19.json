        "meta_description": "Background There is inconsistent evidence of the effects of exposure to ambient air pollution on the occurrence of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in early childhood. We assessed the effects of individual-level prenatal and early life exposure to air pollutants on the risk of LRTIs in early life.\n\nMethods We studied 2568 members of the population-based Espoo Cohort Study born between 1984 and 1990 and living in 1991 in the City of Espoo, Finland. Exposure assessment was based on dispersion modelling and land-use regression for lifetime residential addresses. The outcome was a LRTI based on data from hospital registers. We applied Poisson regression to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of LTRIs, contrasting incidence rates in the exposure quartiles to the incidence rates in the first quartile. We used weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to estimate the joint effect of the studied air pollutants.\n\nResults The risk of LRTIs during the first 2 years of life was significantly related to exposure to individual and multiple air pollutants, measured with the Multipollutant Index (MPI), including primarily sulphur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter with a dry diameter of up to 2.5 µm (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposures in the first year of life, with an adjusted IRR of 1.72 per unit increase in MPI (95% CI 1.20 to 2.47). LRTIs were not related to prenatal exposure.\n\nConclusions We provide evidence that ambient air pollution exposure during the first year of life increases the risk of LRTIs during the first 2 years of life. SO2, PM2.5 and NO2 were found to contribute the highest weights on health effects.\n\nData are available upon reasonable request.

        "text": "Exposure assessment\n\nThe individual-level exposure to ambient air pollutants during the prenatal period and first year of life was measured based on the concentrations at all the residential addresses from conception to birth and from birth to the first year of life while accounting for residential mobility. We modelled hourly values of air pollutants for a computational spatiotemporal grid for a time period from the conception to the end of the follow-up period of the Espoo cohort. Exposure for each member of the cohort was calculated individually using the location and the time spent in all of their residences.\n\nWe obtained the data on air pollutants of interest from the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI). The pollutant data were based on a cascade of nested simulations of the System for Integrated modeLling of Atmospheric coMposition (SILAM).9 To evaluate the global and regional background levels of air pollutants, the model was first executed on a global scale and then zoomed to Europe and Northern Europe, reaching the spatial resolution of 0.1° × 0.1°.\n\nWe retrieved the home coordinates from the Population Register Centre of Finland. The Geographical Information System was used to extract daily levels of air pollutants at these home coordinates. The exposures of interest were atmospheric air pollutants during pregnancy and the first year of life. The air pollutants of interest constituted of the fine particulate matter with a dry diameter of up to 2.5 µm (PM2.5), the particulate matter with a dry diameter of up to 10 μm (PM10), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3).\n\nAir pollution exposure and the risk of LRTIs\n\nAfter adjusting for potential confounders, none of the prenatal exposure to air pollutants was associated with hospital admissions due to LRTIs in the first 2 years of life (online supplemental table S6). However, in the single pollutant model the incidence rates of LRTI in the highest quartiles of postnatal (the first year) exposures to PM2.5, NO2 and CO concentrations were higher compared with the lowest quartile, with IRR of 2.92 (95% CI 1.44 to 5.92), 2.83 (95% CI 1.40 to 5.71) and 2.28 (95% CI 1.09 to 4.74), respectively (table 4). Similarly, the occurrence of LRTIs was also related with the first-year exposure to PM10 and SO2 concentrations, with IRR of 2.82 (95% CI 1.40 to 5.70) and 2.81 (95% CI 1.35 to 5.83), respectively. These findings were consistent when we analysed exposure during postnatal period and episodes of LRTIs at 1–2 years of life (online supplemental table S7).\n\nThe multipollutant models were fitted by including one traffic-related (PM2.5, NO2, CO) and one stationary fossil fuel combustion-related pollutant (PM10, SO2) and/or O3. However, the effect estimates in the multipollutant models were systematically lower than in the single-pollutant models and they appeared more imprecise, which is explained by a high degree of correlation between the pollutants, as presented in online supplemental table S3. There were significant linear trends in the effect of air pollutant exposure quartiles for all air pollutant exposures and LRTIs, except for O3 exposure (figure 1).\n\nIn WQS analysis, the incidence rate of LRTIs increased by 72% (IRR=1.72, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.47) for a unit increase in the multipollutant index (MPI) in the first year of life, which represents quartiles of multiple air pollutants, each weighted according to its contribution to the overall association with the outcome. The weights for different air pollutants contributing to the pollutant mixture index were SO2 (contribution 36.3%), PM2.5 (30.8%), NO2 (12.8%), O3 (8.6%), PM10 (7.5%) and CO (4.0%). Prenatal air pollutant exposures did not show similar effects on LTRIs. The MPI for the exposures during the entire prenatal period was not statistically significant (IRR=0.68, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.05). This finding was consistent with observed non-significant exposure-outcome associations in the single and multipollutant models (online supplemental table S6).\n\nValidity of results\n\nThis study was based on a population-based cohort study consisting of a random sample of children from the Roster of Statistics Finland, with a high response rate (80.3%) at baseline. Hence, the risk of potential selection bias was relatively small.\n\nExposure to air pollution was assessed at the individual level, independently from the assessment of the health outcome occurrences. This should minimise the likelihood of information bias. We took into account the potential changes in the residential addresses during the entire pregnancy and first year of life, hence potential exposure misclassification and related information bias due to mobility is unlikely. The exposure data were estimated with high resolution—the temporal resolution of 1 hour and the spatial resolution of approximately 10 km of SILAM simulations downscaled to hundreds of metres. These high-resolution estimations considered both the emissions from vehicular traffic and small-scale combustion sources by using the road network dispersion model (Contaminants in the Air from a Road, CAR-FMI), and the multiple-source Gaussian dispersion model (Dispersion Model for Stationary Point, Area and Volume Sources, UDM-FMI).15 The spatial resolution of exposure data was relatively coarse. In the study area, the spatial resolution applied in this study corresponded to around 5.5 km in the east-west direction, and 11.1 km in the north-south direction. It was not possible to use urban scale models for such a long period of time, including numerous pollutants. Kukkonen et al 15 have presented a multidecadal (from 1980 to 2014) assessment on an urban scale for the Helsinki Metropolitan Area; however, that study addressed only the concentrations of PM2.5. In that study, the distances between the receptor points varied from 25 m near roads to 200 m in rural areas.\n\nThe outcome of interest, an episode of LRTI requiring hospitalisation including acute bronchitis and pneumonia, was defined based on ICD codes from clinical diagnoses, which reduced the likelihood of outcome misclassification. The ICD codes given by health professionals were considered to provide a more objective measure compared with parental reports. The latter may be influenced by recall bias, potentially leading to outcome misclassification.\n\nWe conducted several sensitivity analyses, including the use of gestational age (ie, analysing separately term and preterm infants) and the sex of the newborn. The results were comparable in both cases (online supplemental table S8 and S9). In our previous report on the ECS, we showed that asthma is related to an increased risk of getting respiratory tract infections in both early childhood and young adulthood.16 Thus, part of the effect of air pollution exposure on the risk of LRTIs could be mediated by emerging or existing asthma. We could not elaborate the role of asthma in the causal path, because most of the asthma diagnoses were made after the age of 2 years.\n\nWe were also able to control for several potential confounders, including secondhand tobacco smoke, maternal smoking during pregnancy, family socioeconomic status (based on the highest parental education and occupation), sex of the child, preterm birth, duration of breast feeding, and indoor mould exposure, that have been reported to increase the risk of LRTIs. Information on potential confounders was from the data collection in 1991 when the children were from 1 year to 7 years old. Information on some of these potential confounders was expected to be accurate (eg, family socioeconomic status), but for others (eg, indoor mould exposure) time distance may have influenced the accuracy of the information, but the influence was expected to be non-differential with respect to the studied relations. In addition, we did not have information on some potential confounders, such as type of furniture or recent refurbishment, which have recently been found to be determinants of LRTIs.17\n\nAccording to a systematic literature search, the present study is the first to consider the effect of the exposure to multiple simultaneous air pollutants on the risk of early childhood LRTIs. Previous studies have used mainly single-pollutant models.18–24 We identified two studies that used multipollutant models to estimate each pollutant’s independent effects on the risk of LRTIs.25 26 The results obtained using single pollutant models are likely to be influenced by residual confounding, as those do not take into account potential confounding and synergism between the effects of multiple pollutants. On the other hand, studies using multipollutant models might suffer from multicollinearity among the pollutants, which could also lead to biased effect estimates. Moreover, as urban air pollution is always a complex mixture of particles and various gases, an analysis based on a multipollutant mixture approach is likely to provide the most valid effect estimate on the association between air pollution and LRTIs. By using WQS regression analysis, we were able to estimate the effect of the ambient air pollution mixture on the risk of early childhood LRTIs. WQS regression combines correlated pollutants into a single index, effectively controlling the multicollinearity effect. This unification ensures that the estimates produced are reliable.\n\nSynthesis with previous knowledge\n\nPrenatal and early childhood periods have been identified as critical periods for the effects of environmental exposures on adverse health outcomes later in life, including respiratory infections.27 There is substantial evidence showing an association between prenatal and early life exposure to air pollution and adverse respiratory health later in life,28 29 but little information on effects on early childhood respiratory infections. In a recent systematic review, Gheissari et al 5 reported a significant association between early life exposure to air pollution and adverse respiratory outcomes.5 Among the studies that were included in that review, only a few had assessed the risk of LRTIs as the outcome, while some of these showed inconsistent results.23 Almost all these studies assessed only the effects of short-term exposure to air pollution in early life. A meta-analysis based on 17 studies conducted until January 2017 reported a significant association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and increased hospitalisation due to pneumonia in children who were younger than 18 years of age.30 None of these studies investigated potential health effects related to exposure to the air pollutant mixture. In a recent systematic review, which included altogether eight case-control and case-cross-over studies, the effect of short-term and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution on the risk of infant bronchiolitis was inconclusive.31 In addition, previous cohort studies reported inconsistent findings about the effect of prenatal and early life exposure to air pollution on the risk LRTIs during early childhood (online supplemental table S1).\n\nIn the present study, the first-year exposure to all studied air pollutants, except for O3, showed a linear relationship with an increasing incidence rate of LRTIs from the lowest quartile (the reference) to the highest quartile of exposure concentrations of air pollutants. The analyses showed that exposure to SO2, PM2.5 and NO2 contributed most to the association between air pollutant mixture and increased incidence rate of LRTIs. The result of the present study on the effect of particulate matter exposure during early life (ie, in infancy) and increased rate of LRTIs is consistent with some previous studies.21 32 33 Mehta et al 32 reported a significant relation (effect estimate: 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.30) between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and LRTIs in the first 2 years of life.32 A cohort study from the USA reported that first-year of life exposure to PM2.5, NOx and CO increased the risk of bronchiolitis in children younger than 2 years of age.21 Our findings are also consistent with a study conducted in slightly older children, that is, preschool children from China, who were exposed to substantially higher air pollution levels compared with our study. They showed that an IQR increase in NO2 exposure during the first year of life was related to a significantly increased odds of pneumonia, adjusted OR being 1.56 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.20).25\n\nThe present study did not indicate any association between prenatal exposure to ambient air pollution and LRTIs during the first 2 years of life when adjusting for early life exposure. Some previous cohort studies from Israel and Poland showed evidence of a significant relationship between exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy and early childhood respiratory infections.18 24 The difference in comparison to our results could be explained at least partly by higher air pollution levels in the Israeli18 and Polish24 studies with the average PM2.5 during pregnancy being 22 μg/m3 and 43.37 μg/m3, respectively. Similarly, a case-control study from China showed a positive, significant association between prenatal exposure to SO2 and pneumonia during 0–14 years of age.34 In contrast, the evidence on prenatal exposure to NO2 and the risk of LRTIs has been weak.33 35 Further longitudinal studies are still important to strengthen the hypothesis that prenatal air pollution exposure increases the risk of early childhood respiratory infections.\n\nThe present study is based on air pollution levels from 1983 to 1991 in the Helsinki Metropolitan area. Kukkonen et al 15 reported that the highest concentrations of PM2.5 in this region occurred in the 1980s; these have since decreased to about to a half of the highest values. They also reported that local vehicular emissions of fine particulate matter were about five times higher in the 1980s, compared with the emissions during the early 2010s. The local small-scale combustion emissions of PM2.5 have increased slightly over time since the 1980s. In conclusion, this study corresponds to a period of substantially higher atmospheric pollutant concentrations, compared with the present-day situation in this area. On the other hand, comparable or even higher levels of air pollution are still nowadays commonly occurring in, for example, numerous European major cities. The results of this study are therefore fairly well generalisable for a large fraction of European major cities, compared with studies conducted in modern-day Nordic cities, in which the pollutant levels are moderate in a European comparison. Recent results of the particulate concentrations in three Nordic capitals have been presented by Kukkonen et al.36"
