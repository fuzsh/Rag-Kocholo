        "text": "AWS Interview Questions for S3\n\n45. What is Amazon S3?Â\n\nS3 is short for Simple Storage Service, and Amazon S3 is the most supported storage platform available. S3 is object storage that can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere. Despite that versatility, it is practically unlimited as well as cost-effective because it is storage available on demand. In addition to these benefits, it offers unprecedented levels of durability and availability. Amazon S3 helps to manage data for cost optimization, access control, and compliance.Â\n\n46. How can you recover/login to an EC2 instance for which you have lost the key?\n\nFollow the steps provided below to recover an EC2 instance if you have lost the key:\n\nVerify that the EC2Config service is running\n\nDetach the root volume for the instance\n\nAttach the volume to a temporary instance\n\nModify the configuration file\n\nRestart the original instance\n\n47. What are some critical differences between AWS S3 and EBS?\n\nHere are some differences between AWS S3 and EBS\n\n48. How do you allow a user to gain access to a specific bucket?\n\nYou need to follow the four steps provided below to allow access. They are:\n\nCategorize your instances\n\nDefine how authorized users can manage specific servers.\n\nLockdown your tags\n\nAttach your policies to IAM users\n\nÂ\n\n49. How can you monitor S3 cross-region replication to ensure consistency without actually checking the bucket?\n\nFollow the flow diagram provided below to monitor S3 cross-region replication:\n\n50. What is SnowBall?\n\nTo transfer terabytes of data outside and inside of the AWS environment, a small application called SnowBall is used.Â\n\nData transferring using SnowBall is done in the following ways:\n\nA job is created.\n\nThe SnowBall application is connected.\n\nThe data is copied into the SnowBall application.\n\nData is then moved to the AWS S3.\n\n51. What are the Storage Classes available in Amazon S3?\n\nThe Storage Classes that are available in the Amazon S3 are the following:\n\nAmazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class\n\nAmazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Formerly S3 Glacier) storage class\n\nAmazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive)\n\nS3 Outposts storage class\n\nAmazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)\n\nAmazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)\n\nAmazon S3 Standard (S3 Standard)\n\nAmazon S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage\n\nAmazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering)\n\nAWS Interview Questions for VPC\n\n52. What Is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Why Is It Used?\n\nAÂ VPCÂ is the best way of connecting to your cloud resources from your own data center. Once you connect your datacenter to the VPC in which your instances are present, each instance is assigned a private IP address that can be accessed from your data center. That way, you can access your public cloud resources as if they were on your own private network.\n\n53. VPC is not resolving the server through DNS. What might be the issue, and how can you fix it?\n\nTo fix this problem, you need to enable the DNS hostname resolution, so that the problem resolves itself.\n\n54. How do you connect multiple sites to a VPC?\n\nIf you have multiple VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CloudHub. Hereâs a diagram that will show you how to connect various sites to a VPC:\n\n55. Name and explain some security products and features available in VPC?\n\nHere is a selection of security products and features:\n\nSecurity groups - This acts as a firewall for the EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.\n\nNetwork access control lists - It acts as a firewall for the subnets, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.\n\nFlow logs - These capture the inbound and outbound traffic from the network interfaces in your VPC.\n\n56. How do you monitor Amazon VPC?\n\nYou can monitor VPC by using:\n\nCloudWatch and CloudWatch logs\n\nVPC Flow Logs\n\n57. How many Subnets can you have per VPC?\n\nWe can have up to 200 Subnets per Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).\n\nGeneral AWS Interview Questions\n\n58. When Would You Prefer Provisioned IOPS over Standard Rds Storage?\n\nYou would use Provisioned IOPS when you have batch-oriented workloads. Provisioned IOPS delivers high IO rates, but it is also expensive. However, batch processing workloads do not require manual intervention.Â\n\n59. How Do Amazon Rds, Dynamodb, and Redshift Differ from Each Other?\n\nAmazon RDS is a database management service for relational databases. It manages patching, upgrading, and data backups automatically. Itâs a database management service for structured data only. On the other hand, DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service for dealing with unstructured data. Redshift is a data warehouse product used in data analysis.\n\n60. What Are the Benefits of AWSâs Disaster Recovery?\n\nBusinesses use cloud computing in part to enable faster disaster recovery of critical IT systems without the cost of a second physical site. The AWS cloud supports many popular disaster recovery architectures ranging from small customer workload data center failures to environments that enable rapid failover at scale. With data centers all over the world, AWS provides a set of cloud-based disaster recovery services that enable rapid recovery of your IT infrastructure and data.\n\n61. How can you add an existing instance to a new Auto Scaling group?\n\nHereâs how you can add an existing instance to a new Auto Scaling group:\n\nOpen EC2 console\n\nSelect your instance under Instances\n\nChoose Actions -> Instance Settings -> Attach to Auto Scaling Group\n\nSelect a new Auto Scaling group\n\nAttach this group to the Instance\n\nEdit the Instance if needed\n\nOnce done, you can successfully add the instance to a new Auto Scaling group\n\n62. What are the factors to consider while migrating to Amazon Web Services?\n\nHere are the factors to consider during AWS migration:\n\nOperational Costs - These include the cost of infrastructure, ability to match demand and supply, transparency, and others.\n\nWorkforce ProductivityÂ\n\nCost avoidance\n\nOperational resilience\n\nBusiness agility\n\n63. What is RTO and RPO in AWS?\n\nRTO or Recovery Time Objective is the maximum time your business or organization is willing to wait for a recovery to complete in the wake of an outage. On the other hand, RPO or Recovery Point Objective is the maximum amount of data loss your company is willing to accept as measured in time.\n\n64. If you would like to transfer vast amounts of data, which is the best option among Snowball, Snowball Edge, and Snowmobile?\n\nAWS Snowball is basically a data transport solution for moving high volumes of data into and out of a specified AWS region. On the other hand, AWS Snowball Edge adds additional computing functions apart from providing a data transport solution. The snowmobile is an exabyte-scale migration service that allows you to transfer data up to 100 PB.\n\n65. Explain what T2 instances are?\n\nThe T2 Instances are intended to give the ability to burst to a higher performance whenever the workload demands it and also provide a moderate baseline performance to the CPU.\n\nThe T2 instances are General Purpose instance types and are low in cost as well. They are usually used wherever workloads do not consistently or often use the CPU.Â\n\n66. What are the advantages of AWS IAM?\n\nAWS IAM allows an administrator to provide multiple users and groups with granular access. Various user groups and users may require varying levels of access to the various resources that have been developed. We may assign roles to users and create roles with defined access levels using IAM.\n\nIt further gives us Federated Access, which allows us to grant applications and users access to resources without having to create IAM Roles.\n\n67. Explain Connection Draining\n\nConnection Draining is an AWS service that allows us to serve current requests on the servers that are either being decommissioned or updated.\n\nBy enabling this Connection Draining, we let the Load Balancer make an outgoing instance finish its existing requests for a set length of time before sending it any new requests. A departing instance will immediately go off if Connection Draining is not enabled, and all pending requests will fail.\n\n68. What is Power User Access in AWS?\n\nThe AWS Resources owner is identical to an Administrator User. The Administrator User can build, change, delete, and inspect resources, as well as grant permissions to other AWS users.\n\nAdministrator Access without the ability to control users and permissions is provided to a Power User. A Power User Access user cannot provide permissions to other users but has the ability to modify, remove, view, and create resources.\n\nAWS Questions for CloudFormation\n\n69. How is AWS CloudFormation different from AWS Elastic Beanstalk?\n\nHere are some differences between AWS CloudFormation and AWS Elastic Beanstalk:\n\nAWS CloudFormation helps you provision and describe all of the infrastructure resources that are present in your cloud environment. On the other hand, AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment that makes it easy to deploy and run applications in the cloud.\n\nAWS CloudFormation supports the infrastructure needs of various types of applications, like legacy applications and existing enterprise applications. On the other hand, AWS Elastic Beanstalk is combined with the developer tools to help you manage the lifecycle of your applications.\n\n70. What are the elements of an AWS CloudFormation template?\n\nAWS CloudFormation templates are YAML or JSON formatted text files that are comprised of five essential elements, they are:\n\nTemplate parameters\n\nOutput values\n\nData tables\n\nResources\n\nFile format version\n\n71. What happens when one of the resources in a stack cannot be created successfully?\n\nIf the resource in the stack cannot be created, then the CloudFormation automatically rolls back and terminates all the resources that were created in the CloudFormation template. This is a handy feature when you accidentally exceed your limit of Elastic IP addresses or donât have access to an EC2 AMI.\n\nAWS Questions for Elastic Block Storage\n\n72. How can you automate EC2 backup using EBS?\n\nUse the following steps in order to automate EC2 backup using EBS:\n\nGet the list of instances and connect to AWS through API to list the Amazon EBS volumes that are attached locally to the instance.\n\nList the snapshots of each volume, and assign a retention period of the snapshot. Later on, create a snapshot of each volume.\n\nMake sure to remove the snapshot if it is older than the retention period.\n\n73. What is the difference between EBS and Instance Store?\n\nEBS is a kind of permanent storage in which the data can be restored at a later point. When you save data in the EBS, it stays even after the lifetime of the EC2 instance. On the other hand, Instance Store is temporary storage that is physically attached to a host machine. With an Instance Store, you cannot detach one instance and attach it to another. Unlike in EBS, data in an Instance Store is lost if any instance is stopped or terminated.\n\n74. Can you take a backup of EFS like EBS, and if yes, how?\n\nYes, you can use the EFS-to-EFS backup solution to recover from unintended changes or deletion in Amazon EFS. Follow these steps:\n\nSign in to the AWS Management Console\n\nClick the launch EFS-to-EFS-restore button\n\nUse the region selector in the console navigation bar to select region\n\nVerify if you have chosen the right template on the Select Template page\n\nAssign a name to your solution stack\n\nReview the parameters for the template and modify them if necessary\n\n75. How do you auto-delete old snapshots?\n\nHereâs the procedure for auto-deleting old snapshots:\n\nAs per procedure and best practices, take snapshots of the EBS volumes on Amazon S3.\n\nUse AWS Ops Automator to handle all the snapshots automatically.\n\nThis allows you to create, copy, and delete Amazon EBS snapshots.\n\nAWS Interview Questions for Elastic Load Balancing\n\n76. What are the different types of load balancers in AWS?\n\nThere are three types of load balancers that are supported by Elastic Load Balancing:\n\nApplication Load Balancer\n\nNetwork Load Balancer\n\nClassic Load Balancer\n\n77. What are the different uses of the various load balancers in AWS Elastic Load Balancing?\n\nApplication Load Balancer\n\nUsed if you need flexible application management and TLS termination.\n\nNetwork Load Balancer\n\nUsed if you require extreme performance and static IPs for your applications.\n\nClassic Load Balancer\n\nUsed if your application is built within the EC2 Classic network\n\nAWS Interview Questions for Security\n\n78. What Is Identity and Access Management (IAM) and How Is It Used?\n\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS services. IAM lets you manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access.\n\n79. How can you use AWS WAF in monitoring your AWS applications?\n\nAWS WAF or AWS Web Application Firewall protects your web applications from web exploitations. It helps you control the traffic flow to your applications. With WAF, you can also create custom rules that block common attack patterns. It can be used for three cases: allow all requests, prevent all requests, and count all requests for a new policy.\n\n80. What are the different AWS IAM categories that you can control?\n\nUsing AWS IAM, you can do the following:\n\nCreate and manage IAM users\n\nCreate and manage IAM groups\n\nManage the security credentials of the users\n\nCreate and manage policies to grant access to AWS services and resources\n\n81. What are the policies that you can set for your usersâ passwords?\n\nHere are some of the policies that you can set:\n\nYou can set a minimum length of the password, or you can ask the users to add at least one number or special characters in it.\n\nYou can assign requirements of particular character types, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.\n\nYou can enforce automatic password expiration, prevent reuse of old passwords, and request for a password reset upon their next AWS sign in.\n\nYou can have the AWS users contact an account administrator when the user has allowed the password to expire.Â\n\n82. What is the difference between an IAM role and an IAM user?\n\nThe two key differences between the IAM role and IAM user are:\n\nAn IAM role is an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests, while an IAM user has permanent long-term credentials and is used to interact with the AWS services directly.Â Â\n\nIn the IAM role, trusted entities, like IAM users, applications, or an AWS service, assume roles whereas the IAM user has full access to all the AWS IAM functionalities.\n\n83. What are the managed policies in AWS IAM?\n\nThere are two types of managed policies; one that is managed by you and one that is managed by AWS. They are IAM resources that express permissions using IAM policy language. You can create, edit, and manage them separately from the IAM users, groups, and roles to which they are attached.\n\n84. Can you give an example of an IAM policy and a policy summary?\n\nHereâs an example of an IAM policy to grant access to add, update, and delete objects from a specific folder.\n\nHereâs an example of a policy summary:\n\n85. How does AWS IAM help your business?\n\nIAM enables to:\n\nManage IAM users and their access - AWS IAM provides secure resource access to multiple users\n\nManage access for federated users â AWS allows you to provide secure access to resources in your AWS account to your employees and applications without creating IAM roles\n\nAWS Interview Questions for Route 53\n\n86. What Is Amazon Route 53?\n\nAmazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS). The name refers to TCP or UDP port 53, where DNS server requests are addressed.\n\n87. What Is Cloudtrail and How Do Cloudtrail and Route 53 Work Together?Â\n\nCloudTrail is a service that captures information about every request sent to the Amazon Route 53 API by an AWS account, including requests that are sent by IAM users. CloudTrail saves log files of these requests to an Amazon S3 bucket. CloudTrail captures information about all requests. You can use information in the CloudTrail log files to determine which requests were sent to Amazon Route 53, the IP address that the request was sent from, who sent the request, when it was sent, and more.\n\n88. What is the difference between Latency Based Routing and Geo DNS?\n\nThe Geo Based DNS routing takes decisions based on the geographic location of the request. Whereas, the Latency Based Routing utilizes latency measurements between networks and AWS data centers. Latency Based Routing is used when you want to give your customers the lowest latency possible. On the other hand, Geo Based routing is used when you want to direct the customer to different websites based on the country or region they are browsing from.Â\n\n89. What is the difference between a Domain and a Hosted Zone?\n\nDomain\n\nA domain is a collection of data describing a self-contained administrative and technical unit. For example, www.simplilearn.com is a domain and a general DNS concept.\n\nHosted zone\n\nA hosted zone is a container that holds information about how you want to route traffic on the internet for a specific domain. For example, lms.simplilearn.com is a hosted zone.\n\n90. How does Amazon Route 53 provide high availability and low latency?\n\nHereâs how Amazon Route 53 provides the resources in question:\n\nGlobally Distributed Servers\n\nAmazon is a global service and consequently has DNS services globally. Any customer creating a query from any part of the world gets to reach a DNS server local to them that provides low latency.Â\n\nDependency\n\nRoute 53 provides a high level of dependability required by critical applications\n\nOptimal Locations\n\nRoute 53 uses a global anycast network to answer queries from the optimal position automatically.Â\n\nAWS Interview Questions for Config\n\n91. How does AWS config work with AWS CloudTrail?\n\nAWS CloudTrail records user API activity on your account and allows you to access information about the activity. Using CloudTrail, you can get full details about API actions such as the identity of the caller, time of the call, request parameters, and response elements. On the other hand, AWS Config records point-in-time configuration details for your AWS resources as Configuration Items (CIs).Â\n\nYou can use a CI to ascertain what your AWS resource looks like at any given point in time. Whereas, by using CloudTrail, you can quickly answer who made an API call to modify the resource. You can also use Cloud Trail to detect if a security group was incorrectly configured.\n\n92. Can AWS Config aggregate data across different AWS accounts?\n\nYes, you can set up AWS Config to deliver configuration updates from different accounts to one S3 bucket, once the appropriate IAM policies are applied to the S3 bucket.\n\nAWS Interview Questions for Database\n\n93. How are reserved instances different from on-demand DB instances?\n\nReserved instances and on-demand instances are the same when it comes to function. They only differ in how they are billed.\n\nReserved instances are purchased as one-year or three-year reservations, and in return, you get very low hourly based pricing when compared to the on-demand cases that are billed on an hourly basis.\n\n94. Which type of scaling would you recommend for RDS and why?\n\nThere are two types of scaling - vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling lets you vertically scale up your master database with the press of a button. A database can only be scaled vertically, and there are 18 different instances in which you can resize the RDS. On the other hand, horizontal scaling is good for replicas. These are read-only replicas that can only be done through Amazon Aurora.\n\n95. What is a maintenance window in Amazon RDS? Will your DB instance be available during maintenance events?\n\nRDS maintenance window lets you decide when DB instance modifications, database engine version upgrades, and software patching have to occur. The automatic scheduling is done only for patches that are related to security and durability. By default, there is a 30-minute value assigned as the maintenance window and the DB instance will still be available during these events though you might observe a minimal effect on performance.\n\n96. What are the consistency models in DynamoDB?\n\nThere are two consistency models In DynamoDB. First, there is the Eventual Consistency Model, which maximizes your read throughput. However, it might not reflect the results of a recently completed write. Fortunately, all the copies of data usually reach consistency within a second. The second model is called the Strong Consistency Model. This model has a delay in writing the data, but it guarantees that you will always see the updated data every time you read it.Â\n\n97. What type of query functionality does DynamoDB support?\n\nDynamoDB supports GET/PUT operations by using a user-defined primary key. It provides flexible querying by letting you query on non-primary vital attributes using global secondary indexes and local secondary indexes.\n\nAWS Interview Questions - Short Answer QuestionsÂ\n\n1. Suppose you are a game designer and want to develop a game with single-digit millisecond latency, which of the following database services would you use?\n\nAmazon DynamoDB\n\n2.
