        "text": "The pre-arrival info sessions are meant for future employees and other staff members of all units of the university, who are still in the departure country. The main focus is on the necessities of relocation, but we also inform of other relevant matters one can start to get acquainted to. Post-arrival sessions focus more on matters of integration in Finland and practicalities at the University. If the information in available in time, HR invites the international newcomers to the pre-arrival info sessions by email. You can however ensure your participation by contacting us at int-staff@helsinki.fi. You don't need to register for our post-arrival info sessions. We'll send invitations to staff based on their contracts in the HR system.\n\nThe University of Helsinki offers possibilities for both normal language courses as well as an application for fast, personal learning of real-life language skills, operated via your computer or phone. Learning the local language will certainly help you to understand the culture and the daily life better.\n\nThe University's international staff can use the the WordDive language learning application, which can be activated even before starting / while still in the departure country by contacting int-staff(a)helsinki.fi. If you have already arrived in Finland and have a University user account, the registration is done via the intranet tool Suffeli.\n\nThe courses on offer range from beginner to advanced, and each course is built around the language situations that are important to the participants. Please read more via this Flamma-acticle, which also offers more info on the various courses.\n\nIn August of 2024, the University of Helsinki organises a “Survival Finnish” course for international students and staff, consisting of three (3) online meetings and a Moodle platform with useful information and tools. The aim is to give you a glimpse of the Finnish language and culture in order to make your first weeks in Finland easier. Please find more info at the website on Survival Finnish for international students and staff.\n\nAlso more traditional Finnish for Foreigners language courses are offered for international members of staff. More information can be found on the intranet Flamma, at Language training for University staff.\n\nThe Kielibuusti (Language boost) project offers advice and materials on anything related to learning Finnish and Swedish. Do check out their website for learners.\n\nThere are also courses outside the University. You can find out more of them on Studying Finnish (InfoFinland) and on Finnishcourses.fi (InfoFinland)\n\nUni Arrival Advisor\n\nThe Uni Arrival Advisor is a simple digital service by the University of Helsinki to guide you through the necessary registrations and formalities upon your arrival in Finland. It is important, that you use it to find out about the necessary steps you need to take before and after arrival in Finland.\n\nIf you are coming from outside the EU, you usually need to apply for a residence permit beforehand in the Enter Finland-service of the Finnish immigration service, which includes identification at a local Finnish embassy or a VFS Global Application Centre. EU citizens complete an EU registration in Finland within three months of arrival. Nordic citizens must register at the Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV) within a week of arrival, if planning to stay in Finland for over 6 months.\n\nOnce in Finland, you need to visit the related officials. In the greater Helsinki area, this means visiting the International House Helsinki (IHH). At IHH, the services of the Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV), the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela), the Tax Administration, the Finnish Immigration Service (Migri), to name a few, at your disposal. Most of the service providers require a pre-booked meeting, please check the IHH website for details. Bear in mind the original and translated birth and marriage certificates needed at DVV. The Apostille is not required from certificates awarded in EU-countries. Tax issues are also explained in more detail at this website, when you scroll further (Taxation, pension and holidays)\n\nUni Arrival Advisor\n\nCurrently opening a bank account in Finland can take several weeks, therefore we strongly recommend that you keep your account in the departure country active, if possible. Your first salary can in most cases be paid there, to avoid practical problems at the start of employment.\n\nWhen opening a bank account, you will normally be required to present an employment or other type of contract from the University and your passport or identity card (from an EEA-country, Switzerland or San Marino) as well as your residence permit or EU registration document. Opening a bank account is recommended for all staff members receiving a salary from the University of Helsinki, especially if your intended stay in Finland is more than a few months. All salaries and grants paid by the University of Helsinki can be paid to any bank account in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). A Finnish personal identity code is usually required for opening a bank account. Please ask about additional requirements from the bank you have chosen.\n\nThe strong identification e-banking service is by far the most widely accepted and most practical method of online identification in Finland, and we recommend applying for that. For applying for strong identification banking services, an ID card from Finland or from another EEA-country, Switzerland or San Marino can be used. The police however also provides one-time identifications, e.g. for bank service purposes. The one-time identification costs as much as the ID-card.\n\nHere is a list of the major Finnish banks:\n\nOP (EU and swiss citizens do not need the ID card, only proof of citizenship)\n\nDanske Bank\n\nNordea\n\nSavings bank - Säästöpankki\n\nS-pankki (only in Finnish)\n\nAktia (mostly in Finnish or Swedish)\n\nHandelsbanken (only in Finnish or Swedish)\n\nBanks must provide a basic payment account service on an equal and non-discriminatory basis to all retail customers who are legally resident in an EEA country. Strong identification online banking requirements are not a reason for a bank to not to offer basic services like an account where salary can be paid to. Read more about it the website of the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.\n\nWe advise you to apply for online banking codes, which enable e-identification. That allows you to log in to all Finnish public administration e-services, the use of which require strong identification. Using the online banking is by far the most common way of identification, and it is also most widely accepted.\n\nAnother way for e-identification, which comes with other benefits and which we strongly recommend, is to order a Finnish identity card from the police. Some banks in fact require the ID card for strong identification online banking. It is worth it to book a time for this well in advance.\n\nTo activate it for e-identification use on its own, you will first need a card reading device and software. More info can be found on suomi.fi-website.\n\nIt is recommended to book an appointment with the police beforehand. You will need an official passport photo for the card, which the service provider can deliver straight to the police. Below you can find a short list of photo service providers\n\nAnother way for identification is mobile identification, which works on all mobile phones, but strong identification requires that there is an activated mobile certificate on the mobile phone’s SIM card. See your mobile provider’s website and the Mobiilivarmenne.fi web page for more information on the introduction of a mobile certificate and any charges it may include.\n\nPassikuvasuomi\n\nFotoyks\n\nTunninkuva\n\nKuvatehdas\n\nThe University of Helsinki invests in the welfare of its employees by offering preventative occupational health services and general medical care. Occupational healthcare services are available for all University of Helsinki employees who work at least 14 hours per week. Family members or grant-funded researchers at the University are not entitled to use occupational health services.\n\nIn Finland, the employer does not usually provide health care insurance to its employees or their families, as residents normally belong to the Finnish social security system, administered by the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, Kela.\n\nThe University employees can use occupational health services from Monday to Friday, 8.00–20.00, if their occupational health unit is open. Employees cannot use occupational health services at night, on weekends or on public holidays that fall on a working day. The assigned occupational health unit for employees depends on the location of their workplace. The occupational health unit in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area is Mehiläinen Ympyrätalo.\n\nBy far not all forms of healthcare are included in occupational health care, but are available to the University employees via the public system. All University of Helsinki employees are also insured for work-related travel and accidents.\n\nOccupational Healthcare (Flamma intranet)\n\nOccupational safety and worktime insurance (Flamma intranet)\n\nOne of the first and most important things you need at the University is a IT user account. You need to apply for that by sending a user account application. Please read further instructions here: Instructions for completing the username application form.\n\nThe IT services of the University are provided by the IT Centre. If you have any IT related questions or problems, please visit the IT Helpdesk instructions page, which is available 24/7 in Finnish, English and Swedish. You do not need to log in to use the instructions site. The contact information and service hours of the IT Helpdesk can be found on the Helpdesk instructions page.\n\nWe recommend that you read these useful IT instructions in advance. In order to use the information systems of the University of Helsinki, you will need a user account. For instructions on applying for a user account, please visit the Helpdesk instructions page.\n\nThe University of Helsinki uses the wireless eduroam network. You can access it with the username and password of your home university. If you do not have a username and password, you can create them before your arrival on the eduroam site. You can check if your home university uses eduroam by visiting the eduroam page. You can also find instructions for printing on the Helpdesk instructions page. If you do not yet have a University of Helsinki user account, please see the Print in City printing instructions.\n\nOnce you have received your University of Helsinki user account, we recommend you join our international Teams community: Internationals at the University of Helsinki.\n\nIt is open to all international employees at the university, as well as all international researchers and individuals completing doctoral studies at the university - regardless of how their studies/research is funded. Inclusion is the key word and anyone who identifies as international is welcome to join. There are specific channels for the main staff groups.\n\nThe Teams community is not designed to replace existing communication channels like service addresses or Flamma, nor procedures for staff to receive support, but rather to amplify the former and provide an informal discussion area for international staff. You can find the Teams community via this Teams link, or doing a search in Teams with \"Internationals at the University of Helsinki\".\n\nThe Helsinki University Library operates on all four University campuses. The Helsinki University Library is open to everyone. A library card is required to borrow materials. You can get a Helsinki University Library HELKA card from the library by presenting an official ID the first time you loan an item. A library card is personal and the holder is responsible for the material borrowed with it. The library database HELKA can be accessed online through the library website or the direct link to HELKA services.\n\nThe Helsinki University Library has more than 30,000 scientific journal subscriptions. If you have logged in with your University of Helsinki user account, you have access to all the information resources (databases, e-journals, e-books) available at the University of Helsinki.\n\nHelsinki University Library\n\nThe University of Helsinki has a talent management plan including digital skills, inclusive leadership, community spirit, and service skills. We support all staff in developing these skills and pay special attention to supervision skills.\n\nWe offer courses supporting researchers at various stages of their careers. For example, you can choose from courses on communication, project management, research funding, educational technology and IT skills, as well as language courses.\n\nStaff and supervisors address issues of personal development in annual target and development discussions. For teacher and researcher staff also so-called work plans are drawn up on this basis.\n\nIn addition, these discussions enable exploring the need for teaching and supervision in the degree programmes and ensuring the fair division of the workload while allocating sufficient time for research.\n\nIn addition to universitys own activity, we can recommend to get familiar with the career developments tools and information on Euraxess-website. Euraxess facuses also on the career options of researchers outside academia, in addition to promoting the more traditional academic mobility.\n\nSkills development (Flamma intranet)\n\nObjectives and planning of work (Flamma intranet)\n\nThe legal status of grant-funded and visiting researchers differs somewhat from that of employees. Usually a contract is made with a grant-funded researcher or a visiting researcher staying at the University for a longer period. In the contract, the terms of working at the University and the arrangement of the necessary working conditions are agreed upon.\n\nScholars receiving a grant or a scholarship from Finland for a period exceeding four months are obliged to seek coverage under a special insurance for grant recipients. This insurance is provided by an institution called the Farmers’ Social Insurance Institution (MELA). It covers pension insurance, occupational accident insurance and group life insurance. More information can obtained from on-site HR Services and from the Flamma intranet.\n\nPlease note that MELA does not insure researchers with a grant granted from outside Finland, and they have to therefore get an accident insurance on their their own. Social security in these cases is dependent on the monthly amount of the grant, it must be 800,02 EUR/month in 2024. Please read more: KELA: Social security coverage for students and researchers\n\nDifference between contractual employment and the status of a grant-funded researcher/visiting researcher (Flamma intranet)\n\nMELA\n\nThe University of Helsinki offers affordable housing for staff members arriving from abroad through Unihome. We recommend that new employees consider this option and check availability from Unihome, a housing service co-owned by the University of Helsinki and Aalto University. For example, Töölö Towers offers good quality short-term housing with a big variety of apartment sizes. To access our special University rates when booking your stay online, simply enter the code Uni24 in the designated 'Add promotional code' section.\n\nIn addition, Unihome offers rental apartments for longer stays to University staff arriving in Finland from abroad. Apartments for the University of Helsinki staff are rented initially for 12 months. After the first 10 months a second 12-month rental agreement can be concluded, depending on the length of the waiting list. The apartments cannot be reserved, but must be applied for by submitting the relevant form. An appointment letter, employment contract or official hosting agreement (please ask the onsite HR Services of your unit) is required in order to receive a rental apartment offer.\n\nThe tenant is expected to take a home insurance, when renting an apartment from UniHome.\n\nIn accordance with a rector’s decision, the apartments are offered to the international groups below, mainly at the beginning of their studies or work, so as to support the University’s international recruitment efforts:\n\nResearch staff arriving at the University of Helsinki from abroad\n\nInternational grant-funded researchers working at the University of Helsinki\n\nInternational externally funded researchers working at the University of Helsinki\n\nInternational postgraduate students arriving to study at the University of Helsinki\n\nThe University of Helsinki does not offer apartments to other staff, but only to employees belonging to teacher and research staff.\n\nThe offered rental apartments are located at the following addresses:\n\nMannerheimintie 96 (45 apartments, unfurnished), close to Meilahti and City Centre campus\n\nManeesikatu 4 b (25 apartments, furnished) close to City Centre and Meilahti campus\n\nKoetilankuja 2 (64 apartments, unfurnished) at Viikki campus and close to Kumpula campus\n\nVuolukiventie 1 b (staircases B–F, 127 studios, furnished) close to Viikki and Kumpula campus\n\nHakalantie 12-16 (12 apartments, unfurnished), at Viikki campus and close to Kumpula campus\n\nKarstulantie 2 (5 apartments, unfurnished) close to Kumpula and City centre campus\n\nViikinkaari 2 (2 apartments, unfurnished) at Viikki campus and close to Kumpula campus\n\nTilanhoitajankaari 4 (unfurnished, 1-3 rooms apartments) at Viikki area, please contact: viikki.isp@retta.fi\n\nIt is good to know that larger family-sized apartments are located at Mannerheimintie and Koetilankuja.\n\n8 reasons to choose Unihome\n\nUniversity-Owned and Flexible Housing Option - These housing solutions are provided\n\ndirectly by the university, offering flexibility to accommodate the needs of our staff members.\n\nPrime Locations Adjacent to Campuses - Enjoy the convenience of residing near our\n\ncampuses, ensuring easy access to academic and professional facilities.\n\nPayment Flexibility for Short-Term Stays - For short-term stays at Töölö Towers, payment can\n\nbe made in cash if needed, allowing for flexibility especially if your first salary or grant is received in\n\ncash.\n\nDeferred Initial Rent Payment for Long-Term Housing - In our long-term housing options,\n\nthe first rent payment can be deferred until the beginning of the third rental month, providing relief\n\nif the process of opening a Finnish bank account takes time.\n\nHome Insurance Requirement - Home insurance must be confirmed at the beginning of the\n\nthird rental month at the latest.

Family members are not entitled to occupational health care services provided for the employees of the University of Helsinki. In Finland, the employer does not usually provide health care insurance to its employees or their families, as residents normally belong to the Finnish social security system, administered by the Finnish Social Insurance Institution, Kela.\n\nPlease visit the Kela service point in International House Helsinki or other Kela office.

Medical records, prescriptions and immunisation records of children should be collected as well.\n\nFamily members taking up permanent residence in Finland are normally covered by the Finnish social security system. If a family member arriving in Finland to work is already included in the system, the family is usually also entitled to these benefits. The Finnish social security system covers public healthcare and social security benefits. An application must be submitted to Kela to receive benefits.\n\nSome social benefits and services are dependent on the person’s municipality of residence. In order to have a municipality of residence in Finland, you usually must move to Finland permanently. For a non-EU-citizen living in Finland for the first time, this usually means a proof of residency for two or more years, such as an employment contract. Please check from the website below, if your situation allows you to obtain a municipality of residence.\n\nPeople do sometimes have private health insurances too, especially popular are separate insurances for the children. The insurance allows you e.g. to see a doctor without long waiting hours.

All University of Helsinki employees are insured as listed above.\n\nPersons from outside EU or EEA and Switzerland also need to have a residence permit or a visa that gives the right to work in Finland. Persons with a researcher’s residence permit can obtain the services also without employment, e.g. with a research grant. Family members who move to Finland have a similar right to medical treatment as the family member who works in Finland, given that they have a residence permit. More information can be found through the links below.\n\nMedical care in Finland (Kela)\n\nDaycare is available in Finland for small children in daycare centres and family daycare. Children aged six can attend pre-primary education, which is arranged in daycare centres and comprehensive schools. Nine-year basic education usually starts in the year children turn seven and ends when they are 18. After compulsory basic education, pupils can go on to general or vocational upper secondary school.\n\nDaycare centres and schools include both public and private providers. Public daycare providers generally have lower fees, while fees for private providers are higher. It is recommended that you apply for a place for your child well in advance. You are entitled to apply for a private daycare allowance from Kela when living in Finland permanently. The public sector cannot provide daycare in all languages, but several private providers cover more languages than the public sector.\n\nInternational House Helsinki has a Daycare and Education Guidance service available by phone. They have also published a Guide to Early Childhood Education and Care.\n\nEarly childhood education in Finland (InfoFinland)\n\nDaycare in Helsinki (City of Helsinki)\n\nChildcare and education in Espoo (City of Espoo)\n\nEarly Childhood Education in Vantaa (City of Vantaa)\n\nLanguage-oriented daycare centres (City of Helsinki)\n\nChildren must be enrolled in comprehensive school at the beginning of a year. You can register your child for school online or visit the school on the registration day.\n\nIf a pupil’s Finnish language skills are not good enough for comprehensive school studies in a Finnish-speaking school, he/she may be provided with preparatory education. This education prepares the child for studies in a comprehensive school.\n\nThere are also several private international schools in the capital area. All of the English language schools have entrance examinations to make sure the children can follow the teaching. The International School of Helsinki is a private school and the costs are approximately €20,000 per student per year. The school follows the International Baccalaureate (IB) programme and educational plan. It is located in Ruoholahti.\n\nThe European School of Helsinki provides education in English, Finnish and French. Each student must learn French from the third grade onwards. The school follows the Finnish curriculum and Finnish studies are obligatory.\n\nInternational House Helsinki has a Daycare and Education Guidance service available by phone.\n\nDaycare & schools (welcome.helsinki)\n\nEducation in Helsinki (InfoFinland)\n\nFinnish education in a nutshell (Finnish National Agency for Education)\n\nGuide by International House Helsinki: Starting school in Helsinki\n\nForeign citizens working for a Finnish employer are usually required to pay taxes in Finland. In most cases, progressive taxation is applied to persons who reside in Finland for more than six months, and a source tax (35%) is applied for shorter periods. In some cases, progressive taxation is possible for periods shorter than six months. Progressive taxation is normally beneficial to the employee, as the tax percentage is that way clearly less than 35%. Please read more about this from the Tax officials webpage: Taxation at source or progressive taxation\n\nIn addition to the Finnish taxation, it is advisable to find out if work in Finland has some effect on ones taxes in other countries, e.g. in the country of residence before moving to Finland. This goes especially for persons working simultaneously for employers outside Finland.\n\nGrant-funded researchers may be required to pay taxes if the grant exceeds a certain yearly amount (26´269,46 EUR in 2024). In addition to the Finnish legislation, international tax treaties may affect your taxation in Finland.\n\nIf you are considered an international Key Employees, you can enjoy a flat tax rate of 32% for the first 7 years of your employment in Finland. In practice this is of benefit in manager-level positions. You can read more about the taxation of Key Employees from the tax authorities page Taxation of key employees.\n\nWith questions of international tax matters, please call the Finnish tax authority service number: +358 29 497 024. They help with questions regarding the taxation of employees coming to work in Finland, as well as with income from sources outside Finland. For more information, see Arriving in Finland\n\nTo pay taxes, University’s payroll services uses your Finnish personal identity code to obtain a tax percentage and an estimate of your annual earning from the Tax officials. You can set and change the estimate and therefore also the tax percentage yourself by using the MyTax-system of the Tax administration. However, this requires the strong, electronic identification capability, which has been explained previously on this site. Another way for the employee to give this tax data to the university is to book a time and visit a tax office. A third (the traditional) way is to acquire a tax card from the tax office, which must be sent per email to palkka(a)helsinki.fi.s. Enter your unit and name as the subject of the message.\n\nWhatever way is used, the tax info must be at the university no later than two weeks before the next payday. Without one of these two actions, 60% tax is initially withheld from the salary, though it is mostly possible to correct this later.\n\nA tax card can be obtained from the International House Helsinki service point or a local tax office branch. The tax office at Hämeentie 15 is able to create a Finnish personal identity code, if the person does not yet have one. An estimate of the total income earned in Finland during the calendar year is generally asked at a tax office. A tax percentage calculator can be used to estimate the percentage.\n\nIn Finland, pensions of university employees are covered by one of two state pension systems, depending on the employee’s year of birth. The amount of earnings-related pension is affected by the length of the working career, earnings and the pension accrual rate, which varies for people of different ages. Finnish earnings-related pension is paid out to all eligible employees regardless of their place of residence. The pension contributions are not paid out when a person leaves Finland. When the person becomes of pensionable age, the pension can be claimed from the pension fund.\n\nPensions are funded through contributions from the employees and the employer. The employer deducts the employee’s pension contribution from the gross salary in connection with the payment of the salary and pays it, together with the employer contribution, to the pension company. The amount of the contributions is based on a fixed percentage of the employee’s gross salary.\n\nGrant recipients pay a pension contribution from their grant if they are eligible for MYEL coverage by MELA.\n\nPension system in Finland (Finnish Centre for Pensions)\n\nFinnish Centre for Pensions"
