Thus, I was able to experience the TTCN test language. In SIGOS I partly worked as a consultant for network operators and mobile terminal manufacturers, dealing with all kinds of protocols.\n\nI am now happy to have joined the MCC secretariat in 2008 to support the TSG RAN5 and GERAN3 working groups for conformance testing at the 2G and 3G Radio interface (Uu/Um).\n\nAlain Sultan\n\nSA1\n\nT: +33 (0)4 92 94 42 71\n\nM: +33 (0)6 74 40 83 70\n\nE: alain.sultan@3gpp.org\n\nI have been a member of 3GPP Mobile Competence Centre since its inception in 1999, when it was originally called “ETSI STF12”.\n\nToday, I am supporting a range of 3GPP activities. One of my main roles is to undertake the overall 3GPP coordination of the content and calendar for each new 3GPP Release. In order to achieve this, I make use of the 3GPP Work Plan, a tool I created several years ago which is now commonly used by the 3GPP community to monitor the progress of the definition of the 3G (UMTS), then 4G (LTE) and now 5G Mobile systems. Related to this, I am also the editor of the \"3GPP Release Description\" series of documents (TR 21.91x), which explains the content of each completed Release. I also support the group responsible for 3GPP service definition, SA1.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, in addition to supporting 3GPP work, I assisted in the creation and operation of several ETSI groups, such as TISPAN (fixed network), GSMR (GSM for Railways), MSG and TFES (which provides the link between ETSI and the European Commission), etc.\n\nWhen I first joined ETSI in 1999, I supported the Network Architecture group (ETSI SMG12, that became 3GPP SA2), which I previously attended as an Orange delegate, keeping my duties of Editor of the \"3G Network Architecture\" Technical Specification (TS 23.002).\n\nPrior to ETSI, I worked as a Research Engineer at Orange Labs for 3 years. In addition to my involvement in internal projects, my main mission was to represent the Orange group at ETSI and ITU-T for the definition of 3G, where I played an active role including editing a number of technical specifications and chairing a few ad-hoc groups.\n\nBetween 1994-1995, I completed a 12-month stint with the French Airforce labs, for my military duty, as a \"Military Scientist\", working on signal processing for a 3D-sound simulator project.\n\nIn 1994, I graduated from CentraleSupelec, a renowned engineer school near Paris, with a specialisation in Telecommunications.\n\nMirko Cano Soveri\n\nSA3\n\nT: +33 (0)4 92 94 42 97\n\nM: +33 (0)6 73 99 62 94\n\nE: mirko.cano@3gpp.org\n\nI am from Tenerife, in the Canary Islands (Spain), son of a Finnish mother and a Spanish father. I graduated in the University of La Laguna in 2001 as an Electronics Engineer, having performed my master thesis about video coding techniques for wireless networks in the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).\n\nI always felt the urge of seeing the world outside my island and I left in 2003 to work in Madrid for Vodafone, my first experience inside a big telecom corporation. After a brief experience as network operator in British Telecom I got a position of technical consultant for Telefónica R&D in a great variety of projects: participation in EU research projects (Daidalos, Ambient Networks), standardization activities in 3GPP and ETSI related to Fixed Mobile Convergence and LTE, consultancy on IMS (IP Multimedia System), and I was also Telefónica´s representative in the Technical Committee of the NGMN consortium (Next Generation of Mobile Networks).\n\nSince I enjoyed immensely the multicultural environment in the international projects I participated in, I decided to move to The Netherlands in 2009 to work as a consultant in TNO (former KPN R&D). I continued following the work of several working groups in 3GPP and ETSI (3GPP SA1, 3GPP SA2, ETSI SES, ETSI ITS), but the main part of my work was dedicated to the study of the fast-evolving Machine to Machine technologies. I was a delegate in the ETSI TC Machine to Machine (M2M) for two years, where I had the chance of organizing one of their meetings in The Netherlands and also participated as a member of the Program Committee of the first Machine to Machine workshop held in Sophia Antipolis (October 2010).\n\nI started working in ETSI Secretariat in March 2012, where I gave for long time technical support to the 3GPP groups SA3 and SA5.\n\nSince September 2023 I have taken on the role of Director of Netwrok, System and Security within ETSI, while I keep providing support to the group SA3.\n\nAntoine Mouquet\n\nSA5 Support\n\nT: +33 (0)4 92 94 42 49\n\nM: +33 (0)6 33 03 38 79\n\nE-mail: antoine.mouquet@etsi.org\n\nI hail from northern France. I graduated from Polytech Nice Sophia in 2018 with a master's degree in Telecommunications and Network Engineering.\n\nDuring a six-month stint with the VINCI group, I played a pivotal role in the extension of the Nice tramway. My responsibilities encompassed overseeing low-voltage applications such as access control, fire detection, CCTV, and the deployment of fibre optics. Concurrently, I took charge of deploying radio LANs for local authorities.\n\nMy professional journey at ETSI commenced in November 2018, initially focusing on ETSI radio Technical Groups, including TC DECT, ERM WG EMC, and ISG mWT. This experience significantly contributed to my understanding of harmonised standards and regulations, specifically RED and EMCD.

This is where I started getting involved in standardization activities, being one of the NOKIA delegates in 3GPP TSG RAN Working Group 5 (RAN5), contributing to the specification of Releases 99, 4, 5 (HSDPA) & 6 (HSUPA).\n\nIn 2006, I moved to Japan and joined Anritsu Corporation, as a Senior Technical Consultant within the R&D division developing wireless test equipment for the mobile phone industry. As part of my product architecture & design activities I continued my involvement into the standardization arena as Anritsu delegate of the 3GPP TSG RAN Working Group 2 (RAN2). I followed closely the evolution of HSPA standardization (Releases 7 & 8) and then focused on the standardization of LTE & IMS technologies (Releases 8, 9, 10 & 11).\n\nIn 2013, I moved back to France and joined ETSI where I currently hold the position of Task Force (TF) 160 Project Manager. TF160 is a team of around 20 protocol testing experts from various 3GPP partners, mainly from Europe and Asia, that are developing test specifications (in TTCN-3 language) for the 3GPP TSG RAN Working Group 5 (RAN5) and TSG GERAN Working Group 3 (GERAN3).\n\nAlain Sultan\n\nWork Plan Coordinator\n\nT: +33 (0)4 92 94 42 71\n\nM: +33 (0)6 74 40 83 70\n\nE: alain.sultan@3gpp.org\n\nI have been a member of 3GPP Mobile Competence Centre since its inception in 1999, when it was originally called “ETSI STF12”.\n\nToday, I am supporting a range of 3GPP activities. One of my main roles is to undertake the overall 3GPP coordination of the content and calendar for each new 3GPP Release. In order to achieve this, I make use of the 3GPP Work Plan, a tool I created several years ago which is now commonly used by the 3GPP community to monitor the progress of the definition of the 3G (UMTS), then 4G (LTE) and now 5G Mobile systems. Related to this, I am also the editor of the \"3GPP Release Description\" series of documents (TR 21.91x), which explains the content of each completed Release. I also support the group responsible for 3GPP service definition, SA1.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, in addition to supporting 3GPP work, I assisted in the creation and operation of several ETSI groups, such as TISPAN (fixed network), GSMR (GSM for Railways), MSG and TFES (which provides the link between ETSI and the European Commission), etc.\n\nWhen I first joined ETSI in 1999, I supported the Network Architecture group (ETSI SMG12, that became 3GPP SA2), which I previously attended as an Orange delegate, keeping my duties of Editor of the \"3G Network Architecture\" Technical Specification (TS 23.002).\n\nPrior to ETSI, I worked as a Research Engineer at Orange Labs for 3 years. In addition to my involvement in internal projects, my main mission was to represent the Orange group at ETSI and ITU-T for the definition of 3G, where I played an active role including editing a number of technical specifications and chairing a few ad-hoc groups.\n\nBetween 1994-1995, I completed a 12-month stint with the French Airforce labs, for my military duty, as a \"Military Scientist\", working on signal processing for a 3D-sound simulator project.\n\nIn 1994, I graduated from CentraleSupelec, a renowned engineer school near Paris, with a specialisation in Telecommunications.\n\nKevin Flynn\n\nMarketing and Communication\n\nT: +33 (0)6 84 53 41 57\n\nE: kevin.flynn@3gpp.org\n\nI work to make our marketing effort a success, in cooperation with the regional partners in 3GPP.\n\nRecently, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the 3GPP web site, as it is my responsibility to bring more news and interesting content to 3gpp.org and also to our social media sites in Xtwitter (@3gpplive) and the 3GPP LinkedIn group.\n\nWe also have a 3GPP Newsletter, published six-monthly under the name HIGHLIGHTS. Articles are read and approved by the appropriate TSG and WG leaders, but I get to be the Editor and to run around after contributors and partners. If you are in the 3GPP work and would like to contribute to Highlights on your 3GPP topic - let's talk to see if we can make that happen.\n\nI am of British / English origin, I started work in 1983 for Texas Instruments, ending-up in the UK semi-conductor Sales and Marketing team. When the factory closed in the UK, I moved to the South of France, joining ETSI in 1996.\n\nI would be very happy to hear from others in the community who want to take our news on-the-road or to get some web pages written about our successes...or who just want to get some marketing information about the Project.\n\nEmmanuelle Wurffel\n\nAssistant and EF3 Coordinator\n\nT: +33 (0)4 92 94 42 66\n\nE: emmanuelle.wurffel@3gpp.org\n\nI graduated from the Skema University in Sophia Antipolis with a Master degree.\n\nI have been working for ETSI since the middle of 1994 and from my position in ETSI, I have followed the evolution of GSM.\n\nAs part of the team of three girls, I support 20 Experts based in the ETSI Secretariat involved in 3GPP standardization. I also provide direct help to the Chairmen and Participants in all working groups.\n\nOne of my major tasks is to budget & to organize, \"from A to Z\" , the 3GPP meetings abroad on behalf of the European Friends of 3GPP. Meetings can vary from 60 to 700 people.\n\nWhat's EF3? I suggest you have a look at http://www.eurofriends3.org/\n\nWould you like to be a Member of EF3? If so please feel free to contact me.\n\nElisabetta Comin\n\nAssistant to Issam Toufik, finance, exploder lists\n\nT: +33 (0)4 92 94 42 89\n\nM: +33 (0)6 85 76 89 74\n\nE: elisabetta.comin@3gpp.org\n\nI graduated from the University of Padua, Italy, and later on obtained a Master 2 from the University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis.\n\nI have been with ETSI since 2016, involved in different roles, mainly in support of funded projects, among which the STFs and the EU-funded \"InDiCo\" project.\n\nI joined the Mobile Competence Cetre team in 2021. I currently work as a Personal Assistant to the ETSI CTO, Issam Toufik, and provide support to a wide range of 3GPP activities. Among my functions, I take care of 3GPP elections, 3GPP website, exploders lists management."
