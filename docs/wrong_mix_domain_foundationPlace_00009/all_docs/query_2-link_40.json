        "text": "Brainiall is an independent software vendor (ISV) and emerging AI software as a service (SaaS) company focused on bringing next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) automation to the enterprise industrial market. The company's solution helps customers in mining and other industries improve business performance to better meet their stringent efficiency, safety and sustainability goals.\n\nFor Brainiall's mining customers, the AI-powered automation software helps significantly increase throughput in the rock-crushing process, potentially generating millions of dollars in additional revenue, while reducing energy consumption, saving costs and reducing environmental impact.\n\nBelieving its AI services have the potential to improve business efficiency across many industry verticals, Brainiall wanted to position itself for growth within the industry and beyond by entering new markets and expanding its customer base. It also wanted to develop and accelerate its SaaS solutions with cloud modernisation. Rebuilding its architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS) could give it more control over its solutions, improve performance and reduce cloud consumption costs. However, the ISV needed external expertise and guidance and turned to SoftwareOne for help.\n\nUsing AI to improve industrial operations\n\nBrainiall is a young company, launched with the goal of transforming industries by using scalable and replicable AI automation to help its customers improve productivity. This required the company to ingest and process large amounts of data to train machine learning models.\n\nThe ISV developed a cloud-hosted AI service that uses data provided through the internet of things (IoT) devices of its customers and other inputs to work like an autopilot. This integrates directly with supervisory control systems to collect sensor data, calculate optimal process parameters and make automatic adjustments to operations. Important parameters include mining flow, water flow, granulometry, input weight, output weight, the speed and power of each mill, temperature and humidity.\n\nBrainiall’s AI automation software currently helps mining companies increase throughput in the grinding process by 5-10%. Grinding is the process where the large chunks of rock extracted from the mine are broken up to extract minerals. This increased throughput can increase revenues by millions of dollars and can cut energy use by about 3%, saving costs and reducing environmental effects.\n\nA multi-step approach to success\n\n1. Envision Workshop\n\nAn envisioning workshop was conducted to conceptualise the needs and focus the business vision, transformation and innovation strategies, resulting in the following objectives that Brainiall wanted to achieve:\n\nNear real-time data processing and visualisation – dashboards to be updated every second\n\nUsing ML and AI models trained on the data collected from IoT devices to optimise processes\n\nA leaner architecture, consolidating IT services and lowering management overheads\n\nAn increase in performance and efficiencies\n\nCloud cost optimisation: up to 20% cost savings on cloud consumption costs per month\n\nEasy and fast deployment of client environments\n\nScalability for a growing customer base\n\n2. AWS Assessment\n\nTo optimise Brainiall's AI SaaS solution for its mining customers, SoftwareOne carried out an assessment. It gathered the necessary information through interviews with Brainiall's IT team. The assessment aimed to evaluate the technical requirements for developing and operating a new and leaner architecture solution in the AWS cloud.\n\nFor the collection, analysis and output of IoT data, the objective was to evaluate how data lake, machine learning and data visualisation could best be implemented into the new architecture solution and which AWS services were best suited for this. As a result of the assessment, the main goal was to enable Brainiall’s SaaS solution to visualise data with a near real-time dashboard comprising eight variables with an update every second.\n\n3. AWS Mobilise\n\nIn the past, Brainiall had a solution that was partially implemented in a public cloud. To unify information from two data sources and visualise the data, the company used another provider. Following the AWS Well-Architected Framework, SoftwareOne ultimately designed and developed a leaner and more cost-effective infrastructure based on the AWS SaaS model, using various AWS technologies to bring more performance to Brainiall’s IoT mining solution. After creating an MVP and test environment, SoftwareOne began using real data for processing and all the models defined for AI and ML. In addition, SoftwareOne deployed an AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service using Terraform to automatically provision custom client environments.\n\nThe following AWS services and technologies have been used:\n\nIoT Core\n\nAWS IoT Core provides the cloud services that connect IoT devices to other devices and to AWS cloud services. SoftwareOne used IoT Core route MTTQ messages, ensuring that all incoming messages can be integrated with other AWS services, such as Kinesis, which forwards message information for data storage in Amazon S3.\n\nAmazon Kinesis Data Firehose\n\nKinesis Data Firehose is a streaming ETL solution which captures, transforms and loads data streams on Amazon S3, enabling near real-time analysis with BI tools and dashboards. It enables extremely fast and voluminous queries of data through sources such as Athena and ML/AI. As a fully managed service that scales automatically to keep up with the data transfer rate, it reduced administration for Brainiall’s IT team.\n\nAWS Glue\n\nAWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, move, and integrate data from multiple sources for analytics, ML, and application development. SoftwareOne used the AWS Glue Data Catalog to create the data tables that were needed to search and query the data stored in AWS S3 using Amazon Athena and the Athena Connector.\n\nAmazon Managed Grafana\n\nAmazon Managed Grafana provides advanced data visualisation. Accessing AWS IoT SiteWise, it has been used to display near real-time dashboards, facilitating the development of new views and providing easy and secure access to different users and teams across Brainiall and its customers in different geographies.\n\nAmazon SageMaker\n\nAmazon SageMaker is a fully managed service for preparing data and building, training and deploying ML models. It has been used to illustrate the operation of ML in conjunction with other AWS components, focusing on how to extract and read data from sensors that will be available in Amazon S3."
