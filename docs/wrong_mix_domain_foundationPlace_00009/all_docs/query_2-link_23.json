        "text": "2. Hope awakens\n\nBack to Table of contents\n\nNews editor Mirjami Saarinen confesses she has only vague recollections of the end of a certain workday in 2010. The morning, however she remembers crystal clear.\n\nIt was September 10, 2010. The majority of the staff of Kauppalehti, a major Finnish business paper, was attending a morning seminar downtown Helsinki. Staff not attending the seminar was producing the morning online news and planning the next day’s paper, when a press release appeared on editor Niko Ranta’s display. The title was so startling that Ranta started to read the release aloud. The atmosphere at the news desk became electric. That was the moment, which divided Mirjami Saarinen’s recollections of that day. She can still remember, how the staff was returning hurriedly back from the seminar, where the news broke amidst the breakfast. After that point, she can hardly remember anything clearly.\n\nAs it was a Friday, Kauppalehti, as a 5-day paper, had a dilemma. The rest of the Finnish media would consume the news completely during the weekend, but Kauppalehti still had to be able to produce pertinent news for the Monday paper. Based on her experience, Saarinen knew what she had to do. First, she collected all available editors to work on the news. At the same time she worked on fast news flashes for the online front page. After that, the team started to think angles, which would be still topical on Monday. Would the news still be front page material on Monday, or would it end up on page three? How many pages to allocate and so on. At the same time it had to be decided, who would attend the coming press conference. According to Saarinen the rest of the day was like controlling a huge traffic jam.\n\nThe start of the press release — i.e. sacking of the Nokia’s then CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo (known universally within Nokia as “OPK”) — was not unexpected. That had been speculated all fall by the Finnish media, which traditionally was nearly toothless regarding Nokia; lately, it had become more critical and demanded Kallasvuo’s head on the plate. Until this day, any public criticism regarding Kallasvuo’s position would have been taboo: Nokia was revered — even feared — among the Finnish press, and all critique was typically much muffled and well veiled.\n\nWhat came next in the press release was indeed startling. Everybody familiar with the company had been betting on Anssi Vanjoki — a very strong and controversial Nokia power figure — to succeed OPK. Instead, the press release introduced a practically unknown Canadian as the company’s new CEO. Who on earth was Stephen Elop? A man nobody had heard of! Was he really the best of available bad options? And what a strange name!\n\nSaarinen had quickly half a dozen editors working on the news, and more info started to flow in. A software guy. Coming from Microsoft. Had been in charge of Microsoft’s biggest division. More renowned globally than in Finland.\n\nA photographer, two editors and news editor-in-chief Arno Ahosniemi headed for the press conference starting at 1 p.m. The auditorium of the Nokia headquarters in Keilaniemi Espoo was filled by members of all relevant established Finnish media as well as international media having presence in Finland, including Reuters and Bloomberg. This was news also at the global level.\n\nThe stars of the show kept waiting for themselves for a moment, then it all started. Two figures well known by the Finnish media entered the room: Jorma Ollila and Arja Suominen, EVP of Nokia Group Communications. They were accompanied by a smallish, rather sympathetic looking man. He had an unaffected, even modest look. His tie, combining wine-red and red, appeared almost Soviet Union-like. Moreover, his grey suit and white grey shirt oozed of caution. He had an army-style haircut and his dull-looking glasses seemed to fit poorly behind the ears. That man was not the next Steve Jobs, was the quick, collective verdict of the room.\n\nJorma Ollila quickly took the reins. He introduced Elop and emphasized that the whole of the Nokia board had been actively participating the selection of the new CEO. The board had wanted to find the best possible person to accelerate Nokia’s renewal. According to Ollila, Elop had a great combination of software background and proven leadership skills to match the challenge. In addition Ollila — the guy who lifted Nokia to the top — emphasized Elop’s sensitivity to the cultural differences. Understanding the Nokia’s tradition and the essence of “Finnishness” would be the key factors contributing to Elop’s success. Elop was someone, who could understand the very core and the possibilities of Nokia, Ollila estimated.\n\nThen it was Elop’s turn. He shook hands with Ollila and swung behind the small round table filled with microphones. It took but a few seconds to realize the man was a master with the words. Smooth appearance and a reliable presence were like a magic wand, erasing any doubts of the media with a single wave. This man could talk… really talk! His English sounded good, unlike his predecessor Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo’s. A glimmer of hope arose among the audience. Maybe it would all end up well after all.\n\nElop started by thanking Ollila and the Nokia board eloquently about his nomination, which was a great honor. Then he continued and outlined his vision about the big changes shaking the mobile industry. Trendy buzz words and phrases like cloud computing, social media, tablets, apps and so on popped up during the speech naturally. According to Elop, Nokia’s problems were big opportunities. Nokia had tremendous strengths, especially its super capable people. “We” slid into the speech subtly and Elop assured he would listen to the employees and the customers very carefully. He maintained he was one of the “Nokians”–almost a Finn, if you please–and said he would cheer for two countries in the upcoming Olympics.\n\nAfter the well-prepared speech was over, Ollila moved next to Elop for the Q&A. Elop sipped water from the glass and was ready.\n\nThe very first question was addressed to the board chairman Ollila. He was asked when he would retire from his position. Instead of a vague comment, Ollila said “soon”. The second question was also pointed to Ollila. A Swedish reporter asked for a summary of Kallasvuo’s mistakes, but Ollila replied that this was not the time for a retrospective but time to look forward, then added there had been shortcomings in the implementation of the company strategy. Now, it was the time to proceed to the next phase with a new CEO.\n\nWhen the third question was also addressed to Ollila, the situation became a bit comical. Elop, however, reacted quickly and replied instead of Ollila. “What would be the next steps for Nokia?” Elop replied it was too soon to comment on that but he firmly believed the answer would be found within Nokia — and his task was to make sure that would take place. In a similar way Elop elusively replied to the question, whether the mobile device operating system should be changed. However, he stated the operating system would be critical factor in the strategy.\n\nWithout a prepared speech Elop was, if possible , even more credible. His hands moved naturally and stressed key messages exactly at the right moment. The movement was almost magical. Perhaps, this could turn into something. Perhaps the American shareholders would finally be happy. Perhaps this man could rescue Nokia. Elop’s undisguised ambition would be manna to Nokia.\n\nAfter one hour the conference was over and the media started to return to their offices. At Kauppalehti the task list until Monday had become clear. The press conference would be covered by Ilkka Sinervä. Merina Salminen would analyze Elop’s quotes regarding Nokia’s challenges. Antti Mustonen would make the feature story about Elop. Editor-in-chief, Hannu Leinonen would analyze, in his weekly column, what would happen to Nokia’s special heritage as a Finnish company, which up until then had been steered almost solely by Jorma Ollila.\n\nLooking back to that unusual day, it is obvious that at least Kauppalehti editorial staff was quick to point out Elop’s strong and possibly ominous ties to Microsoft. There were instant comments like “Microsoft to buy Nokia?” and many saw Elop’s nomination as the first step towards a merger. For some the vision was frightening, but not for all. One of the latter was an anonymous member of Nokia top management, who had dealt with Elop a lot. He [5] recalls being ecstatic about Elop’s arrival and opened a good — a really good — bottle of red wine that day.\n\nWe do not know how Jorma Ollila felt after that long day. We do know, that the day was the first step in Ollila’s plan to rescue Nokia, started a few months earlier. Nokia now had a new leader. A kind of leader the market and foreign shareholders had been expecting. The project–called Operation Elop–had started. [6]\n\n3. Mr. Vanjoki, last minute runner-up\n\nBack to Table of contents\n\nThe starting point for the replacement of Nokia’s Chief Executive was at a crayfish dinner party for the board members in August 2009. In his memoirs, Against All Odds, Jorma Ollila writes that one of the board members approached him asking if the company management was all right. Something that Ollila himself had been wondering, and so it was that the cat was let out of the bag. For a long time the board had remained loyal to Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, a long-term fellow worker of Ollila and a well-liked colleague, generally referred to as OPK. The general consensus was that the problems would be resolved without assistance, but now things were going downhill rapidly.\n\nAfter the dinner party things started to evolve. The decision to replace the Nokia Chief Executive Officer was of such magnitude that it would only be made with Ollila’s consent. Towards the end of 2009, Ollila, too, was ready to go ahead with this. In November–December the board had a yearly evaluation round regarding its own performance as well as the role of the chairman of the board. Vice-chairman Marjorie Scardino was heading these discussions, and they were mainly focused on the operative management. In his memoirs Ollila mentions that practically every board member had posed the question of whether the Chief Executive was up to his task.\n\nThese discussions were the actual initiation of the replacement process. In January 2010, the board had a lengthy discussion regarding the performance of the organization, and Ollila was given the mandate to talk with the Group Executive Board members about the state of the corporate management. This he did, with Kallasvuo’s consent.\n\nThere were about a dozen of these talks, and, according to Ollila, the opinions about Kallasvuo were evenly split between those unquestionably supporting OPK and those having serious doubts. Ollila writes: “Olli-Pekka is an agreeable person who does not stir up strong antipathy. The doubts, however, were clear and strong. The discussions with the executive board were not the main factor leading to the replacement of the Chief Executive, but did indeed provide additional data in support of the decision-making.”\n\nThe concerns within the board were said to have grown gradually. With each passing day, the board believed less that the methods used would lead to success. There were product delays. There were decisions made based on a lack of options and in haste. Also the way Kallasvuo and Ollila were working together caused discontent within the board as the two of them sometimes tended to agree things just between themselves. Apparently one example of this was the decision to hire the former prime minister of Finland Esko Aho as the executive vice president for corporate relations and responsibility.\n\nIn 2007 Nokia reported a record-breaking financial result. After that, the board was able to blame the global financial crisis that began in 2008 for some of Nokia’s problems. The awakening did not take place until 2009, beginning to be noticeable also in the language of the board.\n\nDuring summer 2010, the board visited Silicon Valley, California. The doubting of Kallasvuo’s ability to run the company had turned into a predominant state of mind. In his memoirs, Ollila mentions one board member being against dismissing Kallasvuo. This is contradicted by another source familiar with the case claiming it was only Ollila himself standing in the way of changes. Granted, he is a living legend, but also a challenging character. Many thought he should have stepped down once things started to go downhill in order to enable proper inspection and evaluation of the current situation, leaving room for questioning the existing structures.\n\nThere were rising concerns among the shareholders, too. “What should we have been satisfied with?” asks a representative of a shareholder referring to the operations by the board chaired by Ollila during the last years of 20th century.\n\nThe deputy CEO of Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance, Timo Ritakallio considers it surprising that Ollila did not leave the company after his time as the Nokia CEO. He points out that Ollila’s mere presence, although unintentionally, was tying the hands of his successor. “With Ollila having led Nokia’s rise as well as being a very strong-willed chairman of the board, it is obvious that Kallasvuo was not entirely free to operate as he may have wanted to” says Ritakallio.\n\nA representative of a big Finnish shareholder holds the board equally responsible for Nokia’s problems. The board left issues unattended, one of which was the situation of Nokia Siemens Networks. NSN spent years in a difficult impasse due to a delay in the integration of Siemens and Nokia. The need for change was significant, but Ollila was not stepping into the role of primus motor in order to change the operation mode. The deadlock was apparently frustrating Scardino the most. She was considering leaving Nokia already in 2009.\n\nMany of those interviewed for this book consider it odd that the board appointed Ollila to be the main headhunter for the new Nokia CEO, since he, after all, had been the one to choose Kallasvuo, who now had failed at his task. Other members of the appointment committee were Scardino and a Swedish consultant Per Karlsson, a long-term trustee of Ollila.\n\nDame Marjorie Scardino (born 1947) is the first female executive to have made it to the FTSE Top 100 List of largest British listed companies: She was appointed CEO of the British publishing company Pearson. She joined Nokia Board of Directors in 2001 and was appointed vice-chairman of the board in 2007. Scardino is known as the Iron Lady of the Anglo-American publishing industry. She has also worked as a publisher of The Georgia Gazette as well as The Economist Group CEO. By the time she joined Nokia, she had had a prominent career in the traditional publishing industry but had no experience in internet-based industries nor had any in-depth knowledge of mobile business. According to two major Nokia stakeholders, Scardino’s input as a board member was weak.\n\nKarlsson (born 1955) has a background similar to Scardino. Ollila had requested him to join Nokia Board of Directors in 2002. He was a high level company consultant with a notable career. He was working at Boston Consulting Group until he joined Ikano Holdings, a financing company set up by the sons of IKEA’s founder, Ingvar Kamprad. Karlsson and Ollila share a common interest in finance.\n\nOut of the three members of the appointment committee, only Ollila had experience in the technology industry, but even he, according to many, was not in touch with the service-driven internet-age mode of operation.\n\nSpencer Stuart, the London-based headhunting company specializing in the information and communication technology field, drew up a list of Nokia CEO candidates in June 2010. Ollila and the team selected a short list of names: three from North America and two from Finland. Among the American candidates was the Canadian Stephen Elop. The Finnish candidates were Anssi Vanjoki, head of Nokia Mobile Solutions and Niklas Savander, head of Services and Devices.\n\nVanjoki (born 1956) joined Nokia in 1991. He was a member of Ollila’s core team, the so-called dream team that led Nokia to its success. Other members of the team were Kallasvuo, Matti Alahuhta, Pekka Ala-Pietilä and Sari Baldauf. Before Nokia, Vanjoki had worked at the 3M conglomerate. At Nokia, Vanjoki had been heading Nokia Mobile Phones, Multimedia division as well as Markets division. During summer 2010, he was carrying out a task the board had assigned him, examining the research and development operations. At the same time he was in the process of generating a new strategy for Nokia, again assigned to him by the board, with Kallasvuo’s consent.\n\nSavander had been with Nokia since 1997, but his choice as the next Nokia CEO seemed unlikely from the start, despite his appropriate background in sales, marketing and services. He was deemed somewhat reserved as a leader both within and outside the Nokia organization.\n\nHaving completed the candidate short list, the appointment team started to travel. The board was appreciative of Ollila’s efforts: “He did a huge job traveling and carrying the main responsibility.” Ollila flew on a private plane from Helsinki to San Francisco to interview the foreign candidates. He had set up the schedule in such a way that he could meet five candidates in three days. Three of the interviews were in East Palo Alto Hotel in Silicon Valley — the first at breakfast, the second over lunch and the third in a meeting room. He then continued to Microsoft in Redmond to meet with Elop over breakfast in the privacy of his suite. In the afternoon, Ollila flew east to Southampton to meet with the fifth candidate over dinner.\n\nIt was no easy task to carry out. In Finland he was a king, but in Silicon Valley he was the chairman of the board of an outdated technology company.\n\nTo fully appreciate Ollila’s difficulties in carrying out the task, one has to be aware of the perception of Nokia in California. An American analyst believes that the board overestimated its chances to attract a top American corporate executive for the next Nokia CEO. California is at the core of America’s own cell phone service technology CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access). “Everyone there is in the system-on-chip manufacturer Qualcomm’s camp. All Google and Apple executives, are close to Qualcomm and live in the CDMA-world. These people have always seen Nokia as a dinosaur representing the European GSM (Global System for Mobile communication), the past. From California, the view is somewhat different to the one from Espoo.”\n\nIn his memoirs, Ollila mentions being unsure, as he was returning home, whether the new CEO would be found amongst those interviewed. Fairly quickly the US list of candidates was reduced down to two names. The number one candidate was the number two man in a well-known technology company. According to Ollila, he was an executive in his fifties and who had been with the company for a number of years, having risen to his position through various roles in the company. Ollila says to have met with this candidate twice. He sees this candidate as the right choice — he was well acquainted with the technology companies in the world, and both his leadership style as well as his values were suitable, but after long consideration, the candidate withdrew from the process for personal reasons, not Nokia, claims Ollila.\n\nVarious number one candidates have been speculated on, both in the media as well as in the interviews for this book. One is Apple’s current CEO Tim Cook, who in 2010 was Apple’s number two man. Based on our interviews, Cook very likely was part of the process and a candidate for this job. He fits Ollila’s description quite well.\n\nCook joined Apple in 1998 and was 49 at the time of Ollila’s travels, which could be interpreted as “in his fifties”. The fact that he was also a member of Nike Board of Directors only added to his suitability.\n\nThe other name proposed as Ollila’s number one candidate in the interviews was Sun’s Jonathan Schwartz. He does sound like a good candidate, but doesn’t quite fit Ollila’s description. He was only 44 years old at the time and had already resigned as Sun’s CEO in February 2010, which doesn’t fit Ollila’s description of a number two man, despite the fact that Oracle had purchased Sun around that time.\n\nAn American reporter, David J. Cord, living in Finland, wrote in his book The Decline and Fall of Nokia that Ollila’s number one candidate would actually have been former Sun CEO Scott McNealy. The media was widely spreading this idea only to discover that McNealy had already a few weeks earlier denied this in a tweet that leaves no doubts: Ollila had never asked him to run Nokia.\n\nThe wildest guess was Yahoo’s then CEO Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive with Finnish origins. Mayer had a small child, so her family situation would have prevented her move to Finland. But she surely does not fit the description of “a man in his fifties”.\n\nWe believe Ollila’s description of the number one candidate is true. What possible reasons would he have had to share false information? He could have just as well left that part out altogether.\n\nThe train continued onward. It was the year 1998. The persistent, smart, and fast-moving engineer went to work in California and moved upward in the San Francisco software company, Macromedia, via the IT and sales departments to become CEO. Macromedia had given the world the web page design program Dreamweaver, as well as Flash, a multimedia technology which brought graphics and animations to web pages. There, Elop really started collecting the experience, which he used to charm during the Nokia times. The internet bubble had just burst. The bottom dropped out of the markets, and new competitors were threatening to take away their livelihood. Newspapers rattled on about how Macromedia was headed for disaster.\n\nElop took focusing as his dictate. He reviewed the company’s strengths, weaknesses, even topics that seemed irrelevant, and decided to throw all of Macromedia’s chips into Flash. The change was huge, but afterward, Macromedia made a bigger profit than at any point before the bubble burst.\n\nDuring that time, Nokia was wrestling with cameras and Symbian. Both were announced in 2002. The first 3G phone was announced the same year, and the clamshell model in 2004.\n\nAt Macromedia, Elop was instilled with a belief in big changes and a stubborn focus on a chosen strategy. The seed had been planted. Change was possible even in difficult conditions, when the correct products are chosen, and when one can see which direction the world is heading, was his reasoning. The association is easy to make: Windows Phone became his new Flash.\n\nIn 2005, there was a merger ahead. Macromedia was bought by another American software company, Adobe, which we know from, among other things, the PDF document editing program Acrobat, and the professional photo editing software, PhotoShop. The merger was difficult. Seeing through the deal would take seven months because of antitrust officials. Employees were confused: What would happen to them? What about the products? Elop built from this a second leadership philosophy: Everyone supports everyone else, no one is more important than anyone else. Arms linked, everyone together.\n\nWhat happened? Macromedia had the best financial results during that seven months than it previously had during its entire history.\n\nAfter pushing through to the end with the merger, Elop continued with Adobe with the title WWFO, world wide field officer. He was responsible for sales, country-specific marketing, partnering and customer service. His last work day at Adobe fell exactly one year from the time he had started at the company. He received his yearly salary, $500,000, with bonuses of $315,000, and a severance pay of $1,880,000. His stock options were, at his moment of departure, worth $22,500,000. If his term had lasted less than a year, he would have not gotten the extras.\n\nDuring the same time period, Nokia announced its final successful flagship model, the N95, and Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was the CEO.\n\nAt his next employer, Juniper, Elop’s salary arrangement looked quite similar. His work ended on the same day that nearly $800,000 worth of options became free to cash in. Elop was clearly swimming in money. Next stop would be Microsoft.\n\nBut first to Juniper. They manufacture network equipment, meaning hardware. Aside from software, Elop gained experience with hardware in this way. His title was COO, Chief Operations Officer. Even if Elop was not the CEO, on the headhunter lists he was already one of the absolute elite at this stage, and could definitely get a job in the senior management of any major IT company. The jump over to hardware manufacturing added to his value, even if there were no great achievements made during his year at Juniper.\n\nDuring this period, Nokia was at the top of its game. Its market share had surpassed 40 percent for the first time.\n\nElop won the jackpot on the eve of Thanksgiving in 2007. The CEO of the software giant Microsoft, Steve Ballmer, called him and wanted to meet. They met. They talked about information technology, the change brought in by mobile phones, cloud services and Google. Elop sensed that Ballmer was interested in him, if there was a suitable position open. There might just be one opening up, so they met again after a few months. There were also other Microsoft leaders along, including Bill Gates.\n\nIt didn’t take long after this, when Elop met Ballmer at the Kitchener-Waterloo airport near Hamilton. The men drove to Elop’s house. The family still lived in Hamilton. They all sat around the fireplace in the room downstairs. They talked the whole afternoon into evening. Nancy Elop was especially pleased with the visit. She was able to ask Ballmer what kinds of schools they have there in Redmond, Washington.\n\nA few days later, Ballmer called and asked Elop to come to work. Elop was stuck in a difficult quandary. He was supposed to start as the CEO of Juniper. There was already a briefing prepared about the nomination. Elop described the decision as the most difficult one he had made in his life up till that point. Ballmer won. Elop took over the leadership Microsoft’s Business Division at the beginning of 2008.\n\nEven if Elop was totally unknown in Finland when he was appointed at Nokia, in North America he had become a star. He led the largest division of the world’s largest software company. Contrary to popular belief, the Windows operating system is not Microsoft’s largest source of income. It is the Office software, which belonged to the Business Division. Windows brought in 27 percent of the sales, the Business Division 31 percent. The profit in the Business Division was almost half, in other words about 7 billion euros ($10.2 billion) a year. Turnover was 19 billion euros ($27.7 billion). It was estimated that there were half a billion users at the time.\n\nHowever, Microsoft faced a challenge with the Office suite of software that includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and a few other programs. Google had started to offer the same services over the internet for free. So users could make texts, spreadsheets, and slide presentations without paying for software. The work happened over a network connection to software on Google’s servers. The documents were also saved there. Elop started to work on a solution for this problem.\n\nHe had a move to Redmond ahead of him, this time a real move. The Silicon Valley Elop had commuted from Hamilton by plane. Adobe had paid $145,000 during 2006 for Elop’s travels between home and work. Juniper had reserved $200,000 a year for his travels between home and work.\n\nThe family had grown to 7 over the years. Having children was an adventure, and required a lot of persistence.\n\nElop told the Kauppalehti Optio financial magazine, in an interview in the fall of 2010, how the family was able to have a second child after a long struggle in the 1990’s. It required calls to the US Senate, the Canadian parliament, and the Chinese government. The countries were in agreement on one thing: It would not work; don’t even try. The Elops pushed, persuaded, and negotiated. They did some hard work, until eight months later, the heavens opened up. The papers were in their hands and the Elops had gotten what they wanted: An adopted daughter. The wish came true a few weeks later, when the Chinese officials let them and their nine-month old bundle out of the country. The difficulties continued, however: The child needed a citizenship. Canada had a policy of not giving citizenship if the child lived outside the country. Elop lived in the United States because of Boston Chicken, and their adopted daughter was Chinese. The combination was too much for the bureaucrats. Finally, the Canadian prime minister decided otherwise. The issue was put to rest during his visit in San Francisco with the Canadian Governor General — in other words an official representative of Queen Elizabeth ceremoniously granted citizenship to Courtney Elop.\n\nCourtney, who at the time of writing this in 2014 was 18, and her big brother, 22, got triplet sisters for company, who are now 14. The father has said about the triplets’ birth, that the couple has maximized its capital invested into fertility treatment.\n\nElop said how, in the middle of the 2000’s, he occupied his weekends with his children’s hobbies and playing ball. He recounted how he encouraged the children’s individuality. Each of the triplets got to have her own birthday party. Once they had a birthday party on the morning of the closest Saturday, another in the evening, and the third was on Sunday morning. Everyone invited their own friends, even if all the friends were the same.\n\nDespite all the commuting, Elop had bought a fabulous house in Silicon Valley. Its subsequent sale became a scandal when he started at Microsoft. In Microsoft’s 2009 financial statement, reporters found a footnote: “Mr. Elop received help with moving expenses, travels, shipping his belongings, in getting a temporary apartment, and in what he had to pay himself.” The statements showed an expense of $4.1 million. House prices in California had plummeted, but Elop was allowed to recover his losses. The sum should be compared with Ballmer’s salary from the same period: He received $1.3 million. Microsoft shareholders were furious, and the company finally had to change its policies in supporting its leaders.\n\nThe Elops bought a house in Redmond in 2008, which had 8 bedrooms and 1,100 square meters (11, 480 square feet) of living space for just under $4 million. The house had, among other things, a tennis court and a wine cellar.\n\nDuring that period, Nokia built its first touchscreen phone aimed at the mass market, the Nokia 5800 Xpress Music, which went into sales at the end of 2008.\n\n6. Platforms and ecosystems\n\nBack to Table of contents\n\nIn Finland, we’ve heard over and over how the very heart of Nokia smartphones, the Symbian operating system (OS) was mediocre, old-fashioned, and slow. Its intended successor, MeeGo was being delayed and delayed. Why couldn’t they get Symbian to work? What was the hold-up with MeeGo?\n\nThe answers lie partly in technology — this chapter takes a brief look into that.\n\nFirst, the basics. A smartphone is a small computer. In order for it to work, it needs a piece of software called the operating system, just like a computer does. The OS in Apple iPhone is iOS. In Samsung’s most popular models it is Android. On Nokia’s smartphones, it was Symbian when Elop joined Nokia.\n\nThe user interface (UI) is what the users see on their screens, and how they interact with their phone. Menus, icons, and keys are all part of the UI.\n\nLet’s take a brief look into history. Symbian was developed by telecommunication companies Ericsson, Panasonic, Motorola, Nokia, and Psion in 1998. In those days Microsoft Windows had a near-monopoly dominance in personal computer (PC) operating systems. PC industry players like Dell, Compaq, and others saw their profits being squeezed because, in practice, every computer in the market had to run Windows OS, and Microsoft was naming its price. This is why Nokia and its partners wanted to keep the mobile operating systems in their own hands. As a result, Microsoft and Nokia became nearly arch enemies. Negotiations between Nokia’s Jorma Ollila and Microsoft’s Bill Gates are known to have ended in harsh disputes.\n\nThe strategy paid off, Symbian was a success, and Microsoft’s mobile operating system, Windows Mobile, became marginal.\n\nAt the same time, a root cause for Nokia’s problems started to emerge. Those device manufacturers who had selected Symbian OS for their smartphones were able to build their own UIs. The idea was to use a common baseline, but to allow each phone brand to launch their own look and feel. Software technologies in those days were still immature. For example, Ericsson needed to adjust Symbian deep inside its core systems so they could get the Ericsson smartphones to look different from Nokia smartphones. The resulting derivatives were called UI platforms. Nokia built two of them: S90 for Communicators and S60 for smartphones. [8] This way it was easy to launch devices in the business phone category, or multimedia phone category. The trick worked and Symbian became a market leader.\n\nFrom there, application developers became part of the equation. App developers code additional applications which are sold, for example, in Apple’s App Store and Google Play. In other words, apps are those Instagrams, WhatsApps, and Angry Birds. Creating applications for Symbian was challenging, as the app developer needed to operate deep under the surface in order to get their apps to work. Learning the development tools took forever, and each Nokia model needed their own versions of the app.\n\nApple had a different idea. It created just one phone model in which the UI and OS were combined. This made things easy for the app developer. In addition, an exclusive marketplace, Apple’s App Store where it was easy for people to buy their Angry Birds and other apps, was a revolutionary idea.\n\nGoogle joined the action in 2005 by purchasing a company called Android. As the legend goes, its founder Andy Rubin had started to develop its software for the very reason that Symbian was so complex and its development environment poor. Everyone expected Google to announce their own smartphone and the press was speculating and speculating. On November 5, 2007 Google launched a free operating system for smartphones but no device. This was a big surprise. Google did not want a Google smartphone, it wanted the entire mobile phone industry. The revenue would come from ads and services.\n\nAndroid took its most important step in early 2007. After the launch of iPhone, Google had scrapped its original, keyboard-centric user interface. The work was started from scratch and based on the touch screen. For additional apps, Google followed Apple’s example: Apps had to run in each Android phone without any modifications.\n\nThe thinking was different at Nokia’s Keilaniemi headquarters. Nokia was trusting its old war horse with their touch screen development. Symbian’s old menu structures, which were accused of being complex and for a good reason, lie deep inside the core system and Nokia was stuck with them. Nokia’s touchscreen felt superimposed and the app developers’ pain continued. In the end, Nokia acquired Symbian to itself but that was too little too late. Over the years, so many layers and additions had been integrated to the system that it had become an unmanageable lump. If a coder changed something in the right arm she did not know what would happen to the left toe. Phones got jammed, died suddenly, and rebooted themselves without a warning.\n\nSamsung introduced their first mobile phone in 1989. The beginning was slow since in those days Motorola was dominating the Korean market as they pleased. In the mid-1990’s Samsung had considered giving up the entire mobile industry because of the low quality of their products. Their primary products were semiconductors, motherboards, memory circuits and integrated circuits. After the first Android smartphone arrived on the market in 2008 by Taiwanese HTC, however, Samsung was back in. It launched the first Samsung Android smartphone in April 2009, that’s 18 months before Elop arrived at Nokia. And so the Android ecosystem quickly became dominated by Samsung. When Elop joined Nokia, Android’s market share had risen to 25 per cent.\n\nNokia’s alternative to Symbian was born behind the scenes and partly in secrecy. It started in early 2000 when a small group of Nokians started to figure out whether Linux, an open source operating system created by a Finn, Linus Torvalds, could work in smartphones. Even though using open source software added legal barriers, the project was finalized and the first device bearing its fruit, an internet-enabled touch screen tablet, was launched in 2005. The tablet lacked phone capabilities though, and based on our interviews, Symbian directors blocked it.\n\nThe operating system was named Maemo. As soon as it was permitted to be fitted on a phone, that first Maemo smartphone was a reasonable success. It attracted a community of open source developers who created Maemo apps. With 12,000 members, this was the largest mobile developer community in the world.\n\nThen Nokia did something remarkable. It partnered with the chip manufacturer Intel, and the two companies renamed Maemo to MeeGo. [9] In order for us to understand why this union was disastrous, let’s take a brief look into technology.\n\nOne of the hardest parts of creating mobile phones is embedding the software operating system onto hardware electronics. Nokia built their smartphones using processors from the American chip manufacturer Texas Instruments. In addition, Nokia now needed to align MeeGo with Intel’s processors. The work was cumbersome, and especially power consumption proved difficult. Intel’s chipsets were designed for laptop computers, so in Intel’s world, power consumption was not a problem. Nokia’s competitors, however, were using processors from Qualcomm which were specifically designed for small devices with a low power consumption.\n\nSoftware developers spent months streamlining Nokia’s Maemo and Intel’s corresponding software, Moblin. This enormous amount of work did not carry over to an end product, and ultimately did not benefit the customer experience. Instead of one giant corporation the work was now carried out by two, and the process was stalled even more. MeeGo was delayed and delayed.\n\nThis proved costly. The original Texas Instruments chipset was becoming obsolete and the replacement from Intel did not work either. At the same time, competition was moving onto Qualcomm’s second generation processors. Nokia was running propeller airplanes while others had moved onto jets.\n\nWe’ll revisit the cooperation between Nokia and Intel in chapter 14.\n\nApple and Android brought a magic term into the mobile phone industry: Ecosystem.\n\nAn ecosystem is a set of e device manufacturers, app developers, service providers, and network providers where all benefit one another. The more apps one platform has, the more eagerly consumers will buy those smartphones. The more smartphones that are sold the more services are used, etc. This creates a positive domino effect.\n\nOn a strategy level, Nokia had understood the importance of ecosystems and mobile internet, and in 2008 decided to turn itself into an internet company. The Services and Software unit was led by Niklas Savander. The beginning was slow, services were previously developers in units independently, and partly overlapping. Billing mechanisms, technical platforms and frameworks, business models — each unit had their own way of addressing these issues. Music was created in Great Britain, maps in Germany and email in Oulu. That brought decisions to the director level and turned them into politics.\n\nIn August 2007, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo had announced Nokia would collect all of its services under the brand name Ovi, which in principle sounded good. The launch, however, was tragic. At the time of the launch ovi.com did not link to any services. All it was a static page with a collection of icons.\n\nWith time, the services began to harmonize somewhat, but around 2009–2010 ovi.com did not even work with one set of username and password. Colors, fonts, and the general look and feel were a mess. The smartphones and their services had no graphical or functional similarities. Most issues would have been technically an easy fix, but Nokia’s complex organization made it too hard. The ecosystem was scattered.\n\nAs if that was not enough, there was a leadership catastrophe. In 2009, the company decided to split the responsibility of services between Savander and Tero Ojanperä. The model was dubbed two-in-a-box. Responsibilities were not clear, and the very introduction of this management model indicates just that.\n\nIn early 2010, Nokia faced the music and announced its navigation service would become free. This was an important milestone. Services themselves would not become a major source of revenue, but a means to sell devices and engage users.\n\nThe situation was dire. App developers thought Nokia was a difficult partner who did not understand how important an app store is for consumers. Nokia’s own services did not fly and its software platforms were becoming obsolete. Around that time, Nokia’s own application store ovi.com had 16,000 apps, and the Apple App Store had 300,000. The means to maintain a functional ecosystem were poor.\n\nBut: Newly finished Symbian 3 was a promise of something better. And MeeGo started to be ready for commercial use.\n\n7. The euphoria of the initial weeks\n\nBack to Table of contents\n\nStephen Elop was abroad on his first workday at Nokia. Maybe it was a sign of things to come. It was Tuesday, September 21, 2010. He participated in meetings that had been booked for Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.\n\nAfter he came to Finland, he immediately started to get to know the personnel. His first appearances were met with approval and people were charmed. Interviewees tell that they felt euphoric. Elop gave such a convincing first impact that people finally felt that there would be some decisive actions. From the first moments, he seemed to beam energy. Jorma Ollila’s thought that “a Canadian would be a better match with Nokia than an American” seemed to work. The company had a CEO that felt like he belonged, but who would obviously also get things done. He was like a half brother, whom the Finns soon started to call by a more Finnish name: Seppo Elo.\n\nThe good news started to leak outside Nokia. According to these leaked insights, Elop talked openly in front of the thousands of Nokia employees about both the good and the bad things, which was unheard of. One could ask anything from the new CEO. His doors were open both in practice and metaphorically. In a speech to the Oulu personnel, Elop told them that he daily heard that some people had never had a chance to voice their opinions. In North America he claimed he’d only seen that happen once or twice. It was time to stop holding back bad news. It was time to increase transparency in Nokia.\n\nOn his first workday, Elop sent an email to every Nokia employee. In that email he asked people to answer three questions: What do you want me to change? What do you not want me to change? What do you think I might miss? He promised to take the comments he would receive and process those to form the basis of his leadership at Nokia. One of the interviewees said that she answered the questions completely openly and without holding back. She told us that she was very impressed when Elop — or one of his assistants — replied. According to the reply she had made excellent observations, which were well fitted with the basic principles according to which Elop would base his strategy. There was also a promise to look into and fix any and all shortcomings mentioned. The main message was that the Nokians could only win as one company. Those who would put themselves in the game would be rewarded. Fairness would be high on the agenda.\n\nThis message fit the company perfectly, one interviewee remembers. “I felt like now, finally we could roll up our sleeves and start winning big.”\n\nAccording to Elop’s later comments, the majority of the messages were about the responsibilities and how very split they were. Things fell between the cracks. Elop got inspiration for one of the favorite sayings he used in his first weeks: At Nokia everyone and no-one is responsible.\n\nFrom very early on, Elop got close with the employees. He would interview managers on lower levels of hierarchy and even blue collars to get to the bottom of what Nokia was really like. He wanted to minimize the filtering of middle managers. He was seen in the canteen. Nokia employees working in the headquarters could find themselves in the elevator with the CEO, dressed in jeans and carrying a backpack. In one of the first internal information sessions, Elop complained how difficult it was to mark an email read on Nokia phones. According to his experience it was done differently on different Nokia models. One of the attendees claimed that Elop was wrong. He was invited on the stage, and after some clicking it was agreed that the CEO had been right. The message was clear. The new CEO would voice his opinions on the product level, unlike his predecessor.\n\nPeople were quick to notice that Elop was an email-person. Many of the interviewed people mentioned that it was difficult to get hold of him on a phone. You had to either meet him, or send an email. According to one interviewee, Elop had almost a magical way to respond to emails immediately. Email replies would be sent regardless of the hour. Some started to wonder, whether the man slept at all. The most important mission seemed to be to create trust and hope amongst the Nokians. At the time, there were still 65,000 of them, excluding the employees of NSN, the network infrastructure provider. Elop approached Nokians with stories from his own professional history: “At Microsoft we beat Google. We can beat Apple just as well. RIM can be beat. We can be better than anyone. We are in the first minutes of the first round with Nokia”, was a message repeated over and over again in meetings with the personnel.\n\nAnother Elop-ism was pulled from Macromedia. Elop loved to share the story of how Macromedia focused on Flash and succeeded (described in chapter 5). Nokia could do the same.\n\nAfter the initial euphoria of the first weeks, the board started to have a nagging feeling: When was Elop listening? He was either travelling or talking all the time. In English. Learning or even attempting to learn Finnish was limited to single words and pronunciation. However, it seemed like the personnel thought the worry was without grounds. Elop was very likable and socially skilled, the workers were easily swayed to his side. The people felt like this was the first time in ages they were heard, which noticeably improved the morale. The message was clear: If there is a problem, do something! If you cannot, tell me why not.\n\n“Stephen was a spectacular motivator”, said one interviewee.\n\n“He had an unbelievable poker face and was very convincing in assuring people about things that would later turn to something quite different. He seemed like a leader who is very goal oriented and committed to his job”, said another.\n\nMany people also brought up the positive feelings stirred up by the humane side of Elop. Petra Söderling, who used to work in Symbian, remembers seeing Elop for the first time in a Town Hall personnel session organised in the canteen of the Nokia House. Everyone working in the headquarters in Espoo were invited and were anxious to see what type of man would appear on stage. Elop made a lasting impression: He was warm and emphatic, and appeared to have a humble attitude towards the task given to him. He also talked about his family and children and made jokes of himself, which was something new to the Finnish audience.\n\nA few months later Söderling had the chance to spend a few days in the company of Elop, during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. There again he was warm, and very open towards everyone. He shook hands with the people working at the Nokia stand both in the morning and when closing for the evening. He thanked people for their contribution, looked them in the eye and seemed like a member of the team. Compared to his predecessors Jorma Ollila and Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, the warmth of the new CEO seemed fresh and nice, according to Söderling.\n\nA director who visited network providers together with Elop had also very good experiences of how Elop handled Nokia’s stakeholders. He was active, appeared smart and knowledgeable in front of the customers, and spent time together with them.\n\nAt least a part of Finland was almost in the state of Elop-hype. During the first days in Finland, Elop went to Stockmann’s, the largest department store in Helsinki, to buy underwear. While scanning the barcodes, the young sales assistant asked, whether she could give him some advice on Nokia.\n\nOf course there were those who were not charmed by the Canadian. One Nokian remembers being confused and surprised when he realised that most of his colleagues found Elop inspiring and thought that he would boost Nokia. To him Elop had only been unremarkable and colorless, not much else.\n\nIn the first leadership team meeting, Elop referred to himself as a hockey coach that has arrived to lead a new team. The team was good, but now it would have a better coach than before. The goal was to calm the working environment in the leadership team and reduce the fear the members had for their positions.\n\nThe ways of working in the leadership team were changed quickly. My colleagues have talked more during the fall of 2010 than they have for the past 10 years together, said Mary McDowell, General Manager for Nokia Mobile Phones (the feature phones unit), in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. According to Juha Äkräs, Executive Vice President, Human Resources, Elop forced the leadership team to look at themselves in the mirror and to review their own actions. For the first time in history, the goals, key performance indicators and reward plans of everyone in the leadership team were shared amongst the members. “We no longer work with objectives that are contradicting. We all look in the same direction”, said Äkräs to Financial Times.\n\nBehind all the talk, there was something deeper going on. Elop kept his distance, says one former member of the leadership team. The new CEO seemed family oriented, and visited Finland only shortly. It felt like he would rather have spent his time with his family in Seattle. The same leadership team member says that he had wondered whether Elop was actually hoping to work in Seattle, as the competition for the successor to Steve Ballmer was about to start. A comment repeated by several interviewees was that as every member of the leadership team wanted to make a good impression with the CEO, Elop accidentally ended up with more power than he should have. The leadership team became a poodle rather than a terrier. There were tensions within the team, caused by the nomination of Elop. No one was willing to say more about the topic. It is, however noticeable, that Elop was quite cautious in changing the leadership team. Very often a new CEO brings in some of his trusted people from earlier companies, so as to speed up the renewal of the new company. There was really just one person following Elop to Nokia: Susan Sheehan. Sheehan travelled with Elop, wrote or got his speeches written and took care of Elop’s personal messaging. Officially Sheehan was reporting to Arja Suominen, Senior Vice President, Nokia Communications. In reality, she worked directly for Elop without reporting about her work to anyone else. According to an interviewee who worked with the communications department, it was clear that Elop understood the importance of communications and followed closely what the Finnish press wrote about him and Nokia. This kept the department busy, as someone had to translate and summarise the articles in English. The negative headlines of the Finnish press got more and more stressful for Elop with time, the person says. Elop was also uncomfortable with the interest that was directed to his person. The communications team had to explain to Elop, why he was sometimes ambushed by a journalist of 7 Päivää, a Finnish yellow press publication, in the parking lot. Most of the time the communications people were glad to finally have a CEO who was a good speaker. However, there were obvious cultural differences that were challenging. For example, Elop rarely listened to the journalists during interviews. Finnish journalists expect there to be a dialogue with their interviewees, rather than a presentation.\n\nThe middle management was puzzled by Elop. In meetings he would just sit and listen, says one director. The only feedback he would give, was “good job”.\n\nExactly one month after Elop became the CEO of Nokia, the rumble began.\n\nIt was the time for the publication of the July-September 2010 earnings report. The numbers were good and pleasant to report. Profits were more than expected and net sales had increased by five percent from the corresponding period in the previous year. Smartphone sales rose 61 percent year-on-year and ten percent from April to June. N8 was ready and in stores, which held out the promise of a positive outlook by the end of the year. Elop said he was surprised at how the shortage of components, rather than weak demand, had limited the sales. Analysts praised the company’s profitability, which Nokia had started to defend at the expense of market share. Hints about the acute crisis were impossible to find even between the lines. The only negative message was the drop in market share. “Amazing Nokia” was the first reaction of the financial magazine Arvopaperi. The stock price jumped more than seven percent. American MKM Partners’ Nokia analyst Tero Kuittinen opinioned: Staggering earnings report. Good sales figures in Europe were the key factor. The earnings were better than expected, net sales were better than expected, the profitability margin of the Mobile Phones unit was better than expected, as were the average phone prices.\n\nStaggering, perhaps, but Elop was unmoved by the results. The new CEO had to show who was the boss. He announced that he would lay off 1,800 people, including 850 from Finland.\n\n“In the five weeks since joining Nokia, I have found a company with many great strengths and a history of achievement that are second to none in the industry. And yet our company faces a remarkably disruptive time in the industry, with recent results demonstrating that we must reassess our role in and our approach to this industry” Elop stated in the press release.\n\nCredit rating agencies agreed. Moody’s maintained their A2 rating, relying on the strong financial position and net worth but said it would consider lowering the rating if the market position in expensive smartphones did not go back to earlier levels and the operating profit margin did not rise above 10 percent. During the July–September quarter, the percentage had been 6.2.\n\nThe worst layoffs were targeted at the Symbian product development and the service-oriented Services unit, which Elop instructed to focus on a consistent user experience instead of separate products. These actions were drastic: The size of the workforce would decrease by at least 10 percent, perhaps closer to 20 percent among product developers. The mood was one of both shock and confusion. Nokia had about 20,000 employees in Finland at that time including the employees of Nokia’s Networks unit. Symbian product development employed a total of four thousand people in Salo, Oulu, Tampere and the Helsinki metropolitan area. The statutory negotiations [11] concerned all of them. Nokia offered severance packages to those volunteering to leave the company.\n\nThat same afternoon, Elop faced investors for the first time in a conference call. He had started to embed far-reaching expressions in his speeches.\n\nOne of them was the US. Elop promised to devote a large part of his time to recapture the American market. According to him, there was no “systemic reason” why Nokia could not succeed in the US. It was all about execution and focus on the right things. Elop reminded everyone that there are only three or four strong network providers in the US. They knew exactly what kind of products they wanted to bring to the market.\n\nAt a later date, according to Elop, Nokia will have a “crisply articulated strategy” that would liberate “innovative capacity.” Elop agreed with concerns about Nokia’s inability to get things done and vowed to change it. He said he saw Nokia as an unpolished gem with tremendous strengths. Nokia was the market leader. It had an army of tens of millions of smartphones all around the world. Relations with the network providers were good. Thus, Nokia would differentiate itself from its competitors and stand on a sustainable footing again.\n\nElop spoke about MeeGo, the operating system that was designed to be the future platform for expensive smartphones. He said his first impressions led to confidence and high expectations. However, he said it was clear that the first MeeGo device would not be released until next year.\n\nThe investor call was a great success. The new CEO responded to questions smoothly and quickly. Reporters and analysts praised the plans and the visions. Forbes went furthest and wrote a very positive article in the second week of November. It construed that Elop’s wishes for MeeGo were high. As Elop had pledged to cut the workforce by three percent and was planning to increase the speed of product launches, Forbes estimated that Nokia stock value should rise by 20 percent. The stock value would then be 10.20 euros ($14.60). However, the magazine pointed out that the forecast would only be realized if the profitability of basic feature phones would be maintained.\n\nIn addition to the layoffs, Elop made another important decision. In 2008, Nokia bought a promising Norwegian company named Trolltech. Whereas an application developer would have to spend half a day to implement a simple application for Nokia smartphones, the tools from the Norwegian company would let them accomplish the same job in minutes. Trolltech’s miracle product was named Qt. The acronym is pronounced like the English word “cute”. Qt would be the Nokia ecosystem. It would challenge Apple and Google’s Android. Nokia’s own internal software development would also be done with Qt in the future.\n\nStock Analyst Sami Sarkamies says he thought that the strategy was promising. Qt could have been used to create a unified interface for all of Nokia’s smartphones. The consumer would not have needed to know if the phone was based on Symbian, MeeGo or Windows. Usage of all devices would have been more or less the same. The developer would have had to implement the application only once.\n\n“One could say that, with minimal changes, all applications work on all of our devices, and the work that remains is our problem,” Sarkamies says.\n\nAn experienced application developer echoed similar sentiments: The new strategy was credible and a welcome step forward. Interest in Nokia grew as the speed of software development reached the level of its competitors. The tools were good. The strategy was clearly a defensive move to support the MeeGo platform projected as the future platform for smartphones. There would be a natural transition between Symbian and MeeGo. Together they would form an evolving ecosystem. A relevant question was: Why didn’t Nokia redraw the lines earlier? The main reason is obvious: As an outsider, Elop was able to do what the internal power struggle had hitherto prevented. Reason finally prevailed and the most obvious absurdities that Nokia had experienced could be eliminated.\n\nAt the same time, Elop brought application developers to the center of mobile phone development. He had been wooing them earlier when he made a surprise visit to the Nokia World event to give away the $1 million prize to Nokia’s developers. In his speech, he borrowed from his former boss, Steve Ballmer, who had many years previously declared: Developers, developers, developers! Elop repeated the same thought with style, discretion, and without affectation. Developers would have a big effect on Nokia. The prize was awarded to Kenyan John Waibochi’s virtualcity.co.ke mobile service, which solved the logistics problems of small businesses.\n\nAt the end of November 2010, Elop started making changes to the executive leadership team. According to the announcement, the leadership team would have more sales power at the beginning of January 2011 when Jerri DeVard would start as the head of marketing and communications. DeVard had over 25 years of experience with large consumer brands. For example, she had worked for Revlon and had been part of Barack Obama’s election campaign.\n\nThe newcomer was expected to stir things up and get things going. The leadership team of grey suits appeared to be highly “technocratic” even though one of the members was female. One reason for welcoming the American brand expert was due to the fact that, to American ears, native English sounds better than a perfect English-speaking Finn. In addition, the Nokia brand was trending downwards in international comparison. The brand consultancy firm Interbrand estimated that Nokia was the 8th most admired brand at that time. This meant a drop of three positions from the previous year. Only the motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson had lost more brand value than Nokia.\n\n9. The consultant with a Microsoft connection\n\nBack to Table of contents\n\nOne of the best-kept secrets regarding Nokia’s strategy choices was the role of McKinsey & Company, the management consultancy.\n\nMcKinsey & Company, a US-based management consultancy is one of the best known in its field. The New York Times magazine listed it as the most prestigious in the field in 2011. McKinsey, and the two other US-based management consultancies Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Bain, hire the most talented students from business and engineering schools. They send the fresh hires abroad for training. McKinsey has nearly a hundred offices in 60 countries. Its non-disclosure agreements and requirements for secrecy are tight. McKinsey consultants are not permitted to publicly discuss matters of individual customers because the McKinsey business is built on customer trust. This professional confidentiality also binds former employees.\n\nMcKinsey is a privately held company, and does not share its financial figures publicly. However, in 2011 Forbes estimated McKinsey’s turnover to be roughly 5 billion euros ($7 billion) with approximately 9,000 consultants. According to an estimate found on the internet, a team of one experienced and four junior McKinsey consultants charge roughly half a million euros ($700,000) a month. This is well over $100,000 per consultant. A book published in 2014 compares McKinsey to a luxury product; when they are summoned it sends a message to others: We can afford McKinsey!\n\nOver the years, the best brains of McKinsey have made some strange recommendations. In 1980 McKinsey told AT&T that mobile phones would remain a marginal product. The airline Swissair went bankrupt 12 years after they started to follow a strategy created by McKinsey. Enron, the energy company that went through a scandalous collapse, was one of the largest customers of McKinsey. More than that, Jeff Skilling, the Enron CEO who was convicted of federal felony charges relating to Enron’s collapse, was an active McKinsey alumnus (former employee). In 2000, McKinsey recommended the media giant Time Warner a merger with internet service provider AOL. Jeff Bewkes who was the CEO of Time Warner some years later, has called this merger the largest mistake in corporate history. Into this gallery of horrors, we can also add the case of Nokia from 2009. An organizational change was done during Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo’s tenure. This change fully paralyzed the company at a critical moment. The change was made based on the recommendations of McKinsey.\n\nThese errors are counterbalanced by customer satisfaction. 85% of customers return to use McKinsey again. When you choose McKinsey, you know that the consultants are not stupid and that they have an efficient global organization to support them.\n\nStephen Elop had good relations with McKinsey already prior to his joining Nokia. He had used the consultancy already back when he was at Juniper Networks, and continued to work with them at Microsoft. Endre Holen, a Norwegian based in McKinsey’s Seattle office, had become Stephen Elop’s trusted man. Holen most likely was one of the most influential people behind the Nokia strategy and renewal. Elop contacted him soon after being appointed as the CEO of Nokia and asked him to participate in analyzing what should be done with the company.\n\nAccording to McKinsey’s Seattle office website, Holen has worked for the company for over 20 years. He has a master of science in structural engineering from the Norwegian Royal Institute of Technology in Oslo and an MBA from Berkeley. His clientele consists mainly of high technology and telecommunications customers. He is experienced in projects ranging from strategy and product development to sales and marketing. Industries mentioned include software, product manufacturing, services and wireless technologies. Like for Elop, flying is a hobby for Holen.\n\nThe website lists an article published in the McKinsey Quarterly magazine written by Holen and a colleague. The article is about Kevin Johnson, who became the CEO of Juniper Networks after Elop jumped to Microsoft at the last minute. The authors — and thus also Johnson — believe that after entering a new company, a fresh CEO has only a very short time window to announce the changes (s)he wishes to make. If (s)he misses that window of opportunity, the changes cannot be made or are considerably more difficult to execute. If the changes have not been put into action within 12–18 months of the entry, it is too late. According to Johnson, and most probably also the author Holen, a new CEO also has to have a basic understanding of the state of the company starting from the very first day. This could be something like “This is a good industry, but our company is in trouble”. Within a few months, the CEO needs to have figured out the long term goals, the strategy to achieve them, and the leadership changes necessary.\n\nThe article about Johnson was written in June 2010, only three months before Elop was nominated to lead Nokia. Johnson says that upon his arrival at Juniper, he posed four questions to the leadership team. It shouldn’t be a surprise that these four questions included the three questions that also Elop put to Nokia’s leadership. In an email sent to his direct reports, Elop had only omitted one question: What are you most proud about Juniper (Nokia)? There are also other interesting coincidences. Johnson came to Juniper from Microsoft, of all places.\n\nHolen actually has surprisingly many ties with Microsoft. Elop’s ideas on leadership, on the other hand, seem to be inspired by Holen.\n\nFollowing Holen’s arrival at Nokia headquarters in Keilalahti, Espoo in the fall of 2010, a steady stream of junior consultants from across the globe also began to arrive. This was usual practice at McKinsey: The best candidates for a project are invited to join, regardless of where they were based. The young employees of McKinsey’s Finnish office also started to commute between Keilaniemi and Helsinki city center. These consultants took over the strategy work, regardless of the fact that Nokia itself had an unusually large strategy department. McKinsey was tasked with building a “Winning Strategy” together with Nokians to turn Nokia around. Another Norwegian consultant, Trond Riiber Knudsen from the Oslo office of McKinsey took the position of Endre Holen’s right hand man. He specialized in sales and marketing.\n\nThe people who worked at Nokia strategy department around this time say that the situation was very confusing even prior to the McKinsey invasion. After the spring 2010 layoffs, the size of the department had gone down from 250 to under 200. In this environment, people acted as though they always had something important and urgent under way. It was very difficult to know what others were working on, as projects were classified confidential or secret. This was combined with a limited amount of teamwork and a culture of not questioning the common beliefs. Symbian was considered the sacred cow that all career-conscious employees supported at all costs. Of course it also made sense to speak favorably of MeeGo. According to the official documentation, the strategy department has invariably supported MeeGo. Windows Phone, on the other hand, was practically unknown to all analysis prior to Elop.\n\nThe Nokia strategy department had become a sort of a stepping stone for all young and aspiring wannabe-people. Outside the department there was also talk about the number of people whose last names were the same as those of several well known Finnish corporate leaders. There was a Halmesmäki, a Juusela, a Suila, and a Sundbäck to name a few.\n\nThese people were more or less closely related to their more famous namesakes, but according to one Nokian, to an outsider, it seemed like these people were eased into the department to get a line on their CV from world-class strategy work.\n\nIt seems understandable that Elop chose to use super-expensive external consultants despite the size of the internal strategy team at his disposal. Nokia needed to get a fresh outside-in view. Company profitability or market share didn’t give much reason to trust the work of the strategy department. The mission given to McKinsey was: “Make sure you challenge us”. Elop wanted to understand Nokia properly, and to make sure that nothing was overlooked. What were the strengths of the company? What sort of partnerships were needed? Could there be some hidden gems somewhere? That Elop allowed Holen to participate in Nokia leadership team meetings aptly reflects the nature of the assignment. Holen almost became an additional member of the leadership team.\n\nThe arrival of McKinsey marked the start of a countdown for Nokia strategy department. Elop continuously cut down its personnel. By spring 2011, the headcount in the department was down to a hundred. The explanation was that after Windows Phone was chosen as the new strategy, the main focus was on implementation, not planning. By 2012, the Nokia strategy department had shrunk down to 50 people. Replacing internal strategists with consultants caused conflicts. As one can guess, cultures collided. The external consultants were seen as invaders, especially as their personalities, most notably Riiber Knudsen’s, caused conflicts. Most junior consultants were still inexperienced in international business and their attitudes were, in the words of several interviewees, arrogant. Nokia engineers were honest and said things bluntly and openly, as is the Finnish way. Consultants experienced in the American culture however often assumed that they were embellishing the facts. PowerPoint presentations were made at an astonishing speed. McKinsey would make a 100-page presentation set out of thin air, said one interviewee. If you wanted to make sure that your initiative would get implemented, you should always engage McKinsey, said another. Many were also wondering what fresh insights and approaches the consultants could come up with.\n\nThere are varying estimates on the number of McKinsey consultants engaged with Nokia at this time. A total of 50 is an educated guess. Usually there were 5–10 of them on average working on site, at the busiest times there could be tens of consultants. The McKinsey consultants had their own assistant as well as their own premises with a “war room” at the Nokia House headquarters.\n\nThe massive size of this endeavor can be deduced from the sales numbers of the Finnish McKinsey. The common practice at McKinsey is that the local office does the invoicing on a case. The turnover of McKinsey Finland was a little under 13.9 million euros ($20 million) in 2009 and a bit above in the following year (14.2 million euros). However, in 2011 their turnover more than doubled surpassing 36.4 million euros ($50 million).\n\nIn the financial statements submitted to the Finnish trade register, there is a line called “other costs” after employee costs. These “other costs” were 8.3 million euros ($12 million) in 2010, and 28.7 million euros ($40 million) a year later. These figures most likely give a very reliable estimate on the pass-through billing. Considering that these “other costs” were 5.8 million euros ($8 million) in 2009, we can make the rough estimate that Nokia paid about 20 million euros ($30 million) for McKinsey consultants. Reading the financial statements of McKinsey Finland is almost amusing. The text on the action report stays the same word to word, year after year, only the numbers change. Sometimes not even that: Every one of the reports for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 states that the ending fiscal year is the twentieth year of McKinsey’s Finnish subsidiary (actual numbers are 21st, 22nd, 23rd respectively). Even though the turnover more than doubled in 2011, there is hardly a mention of this increase in the report.\n\nMcKinsey was not the only consulting company that was interested in doing business with Nokia. All consultancies recognized that this was the perfect time to act. In large corporations, a new CEO very often starts to drive changes and needs help. At least one of these other consultancies raised Android as a clearly winning bet for Nokia. The capability to effectively distribute phones to the developing markets was considered as the strength of Nokia. Nokia, however stuck with only McKinsey.\n\nNow we come to an important point of interest. What McKinsey and other consultancies sell, is not just recommendations, but also glory. The end result of their effort is owned by the client, never McKinsey. McKinsey helps large enterprises in making a great number of important choices. However an outsider still thinks that these are choices that the company and its leadership made.\n\nThe relationship between clients and consultants is symbiotic: Who pays tens of millions for recommendations they don’t implement? No one. That is why people believe the consultants. And consultants tailor their recommendations to please their customers. McKinsey has such a high reputation that it is known to have been used also as a rubber stamp. On occasion, it has been invited merely to give rationales and supporting arguments for decisions that were already made before it entered.\n\nWe are not claiming that this is what happened with Nokia. Many of the people we interviewed thought that both Holen and McKinsey were objective and followed the appropriate hygiene rules. According to one estimate, a consultancy such as McKinsey cannot afford to enter a company as public as Nokia with a ready-made strategy. One leadership team level interviewee said that the analysis Holen presented them with was very convincing. McKinsey was dedicated to their work. Also, most of the corridor talk on Holen appears to have been rather positive than negative.\n\nRegardless, the role of Holen raises questions. Why did Elop choose as his right hand man a consultant who had such strong ties with Microsoft? A man who was in an ongoing customer relationship with them? Why didn’t McKinsey consider him unfit for the project? Shouldn’t McKinsey make sure that there is a firewall between consultants that work with competing clients. There is no doubt that there has been a conflict of interest with Holen. For example, we do not know what his role has been when Microsoft decided to use Windows Phone 7 to increase its efforts on entering mobile phone markets.\n\nAccording to one reliable source, Holen was or had at least been the account manager for Microsoft at McKinsey.\n\nIt looks like neither Elop nor Holen had fully thought through the implications of Holen’s role. How does it look like if a consultant who actively works with Microsoft, or at least is close to the company participates in Nokia leadership team meetings? The dual role of Holen is like adding fuel to the fire of conspiracy theories.\n\nHolen’s own LinkedIn profile has minimal information. There are not too many recommendations from others, either. It is likely that Holen has limited the number of recommendations he wishes to show, but there are two themes on this list that catch one’s attention. The person who has been most active in giving recommendations to Holen is Niklas Savander. He gives a thumbs up for Holen on almost all aspects relating to strategy, change management, and mergers & acquisitions. Teemu Suila, who earlier worked in Nokia strategy and is now the Chief Operating Officer at Rovio praises Holen’s strategy skills. The third most-active recommender is Zig Searfin, who happens to be a vice president -level leader at Microsoft, according to LinkedIn.\n\nIt appears that the board of Nokia was unaware of the linkages of Holen and of the double role of McKinsey. We do not claim that these linkages would have directly affected the choices that Nokia made. However, we all know that it is easier to lean towards the more familiar option, the one that you can easily find supporting data on. Rather than towards something more unknown. In terms of appearances, it is indefensible that the strategy choices of Nokia and operative decisions relating to them were made by two people with such close linkages to Microsoft.\n\nMcKinsey continued to work closely together with Nokia also after Windows Phone was chosen. After the size of the strategy department stabilized to around 50 people, the consultants became more and more involved with regular, less strategic projects and participated in developing device sales strategies for Microsoft.\n\nThe first contact with Google came when Elop and Google’s CEO Eric Schmidt talked on the telephone, and Elop told Schmidt that Nokia was making some big decisions. Besides Schmidt, Andy Rubin also took part in the call.\n\nIt is good to clarify a couple of things at this point. Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7 was proprietary software. Only Microsoft could modify it. It charges license fees from phone manufacturers. Android by Google is open source software. Anyone can use it for free and modify it however they want.\n\nWhy did Nokia even need to negotiate with Google? If a manufacturer wants their devices to access the Google app store, they must use Google’s standardized version of Android. The manufacturer agrees to preload, among other things, Google’s maps and the Gmail email service. After fulfilling these requirements and many others, the manufacturer can fully enter the Google ecosystem. Google allows modification of the user interfaces, but only to a limited degree, so that using the device remains similar independent of what device is used.\n\nAnother option is to put Google’s standardized version to the side and download Android for free and create one’s own version. This is what the Amazon online store did with its Kindle tablet, and built services and an online store by itself. In 2010, however, this option was off the table for Nokia. Nokia was looking for a ready-made ecosystem.\n\nElop was as direct as he was in Redmond in his first contact with Google. Symbian was dying and MeeGo was late for its schedule. Nokia wanted to understand if Android would be a good replacement for these. At the same time, Nokia said they would also study Windows Phone and compare these two. The follow-up work was taken up by Öistämö and John Lagerling, a Swede who was in charge of Google’s Android partnerships. On November 11, 2010, in other words four days before Elop and his four-man-team made the trip to Redmond, Lagerling arrived in Finland. First there was dinner with Nokia’s American leaders, and on the next day there was a meeting with a delegation of about 10 people from Nokia in Keilalahti.\n\nAccording to a source present, Google seemed to really want Nokia to join the Android world. The company assured that Android can be customized more than Nokia understood, especially compared with Windows Phone. Even if Google was criticized continuously for having Samsung, HTC and Sony Android phones differ from each other too much, Nokia would be given leeway to create its own user experience. Google saw that Nokia differentiated from these competitors in that it had a global area of operation. Nokia would be able to create better local services and user experiences for network providers and customers, one person present remembers being discussed. The Nokians also noticed that they had been living partially with misinformation. Nokia could continue with Android with its own maps side-by-side with Google’s maps. The same applied with the app store. Nokia’s music service as well as ovi.com could continue, as long as the phone had Google Play.\n\nThe discussions continued at a fast pace after the first visit. Google seemed to really want Nokia.\n\nSome constraints were set by the Open Handset Alliance behind Android, OHA. Unlike Windows Phone, Android is not controlled by one company, rather by an alliance of 84 companies which is led by Google, where the members are able to use Android in an equal manner. Google was in a difficult position. By giving Nokia special privileges, it risked its relationship with other manufacturers. The reactions would be difficult to predict. Creativity was needed.\n\nAs the negotiations proceeded, a solution was found. Google offered Nokia, among other things, plenty of say in choosing the direction of Android development. By directing Android development to align with its own competitive goals, Nokia would gain some advantage, even if the changes would be available for everyone at the same time. Now Nokia was interested. Android and Nokia had an area where their interests converged in a brilliant way: Developing countries. If Android could be made to work on cheap hardware, Nokia would be best at getting in through in developing markets. The arrangement was enticing. Google would secure the position it was dreaming of in smartphones, and Nokia would become part of virgin Android markets. The precise details remained hidden, but Nokia was able to learn that Google worked Android into clearly cheaper models than Windows Phone.\n\nAnother flexible point of Android was in its predictability. Nokia wanted to publicize the new software features earlier than when the phones go into sales. The reason was brutal: Nokia was more solid than its Korean competitor and needed more time to build a phone. If the information about the new Android features was available earlier, Nokia would have enough time to get them in the first wave, like the others. Google was willing. It promised to make the publicizing of its plans earlier and to release the source code to its partners. The solution would have been useless for other Android manufacturers in relation to Nokia, but would not have broken the OHA rules.\n\nGoogle made a substantial offer regarding distribution of income. Nokia would have gotten a portion of the income from Google’s search engine, app store, and other services which originate from Nokia phones, and the terms would be in relation to Nokia’s influence in the ecosystem. We don’t have information about precise percentages, but at any rate, Google’s promise was quite exceptional, considering that Nokia would still have been able to keep its own services in its phones.\n\nContrary to what Nokia has claimed, Google was ready for concessions. It was ready to flex as far as it could in the framework of OHA, and even then some more.\n\nThen some big money stepped into the game, as well as the mysterious Nokia employee with the name Rahul Mewawalla.\n\nAccording to his profile in the social media LinkedIn, Mewawa transferred to Nokia in 2010 from the television company NBC. Previously he had worked at Yahoo, among other places. During his time at Nokia, Mewawalla’s title was, according to LinkedIn, Global Head of the Business Division, Global P&L Leader, Global Vice President and General Manager.\n\nMewawalla had a simple task. He created pressure outside the official negotiations, and above all he tried to milk money from all the possible contract partners. Mewawalla’s thinking was based on the assumption, that MeeGo would succeed and produce Nokia a revenue stream of sum X. If Nokia were to choose some other platform, it would lose that sum. Sum X was therefore an alternative cost to choosing an external platform, and the sum was several billions of dollars. Many interviewed describe that reasoning as strange. Mewawalla’s role and methods of negotiating were considered strange in a Finnish company. The opponents had difficulties understanding which direction Nokia was going.\n\nNokia found understanding from Microsoft with relation to money, but Mewawalla ran into a wall with Google. Google notified Nokia that it would not be able to pay one cent for someone to use its free operating system. It definitely does not fit into Google’s way of doing things, was the answer.\n\nCreativity was again needed.\n\nMewawalla kept at his tough push throughout the end of that year. The sources of money, nonetheless, remained dry. Google’s thinking was that it would not pay money for using Android, but it notified that it understood Nokia’s need to get cash to help with the cash problem caused by the platform change. The creativity appeared in the form of patents. Google offered to buy Nokia’s patents to be used for Android. In this way, Nokia would have gotten cash and Android, Nokia’s new platform, would get more power against its competitors. Nokia still kept its cool. It wanted cash and considered Google’s offer for the value of the patents too low. One possibility to take care of the cash flow would be to overcharge for the patents, but Google didn’t seem to be ready to do this. What was probably the most likely scenario, was that the parties’ price expectations were too far from each other.\n\nElop kept a physical distance from the negotiations. He and Schmidt had not met in a real negotiation even once. There were two or three phone negotiations, but there were only meetings at events, at the most. Elop was also not known to have met any of the other Google negotiators. This makes one wonder, when it is known that Elop met Microsoft’s Ballmer at least twice in direct negotiations.\n\nIn the beginning of January, something happened. The negotiations with Google stopped.\n\nAccording to one version of the story, it started at the world’s largest consumer electronics fair in Las Vegas on January 6–9, 2011. The newest Android phones and tablets got a very good reception. So good, that Nokia’s value in the eyes of Google dropped decisively. According to this version of the story, Google understood that it could take over the world without Nokia, nor would it need to risk its relationships with other manufacturers by taking in Nokia with special conditions. Now Nokia only had the standard conditions, which are jokingly said to be: Welcome to Android, the source code can be found for free in the internet.\n\nThis version of events are not likely the real story. The deciding point in January was, according to a dependable source, that Nokia finally understood, that it would not get money directly from Google under any conditions. Nokia wanted a quick solutions and billions of cash. Google offered a position based on Nokia’s strengths in Android, but it would only have produced money in the long run.\n\nWhen this was understood, the negotiations with Microsoft got a fire lit under them. They moved to questions about business activities and marketing. The meeting in London was with Öistämö’s Microsoft counterpart, Andy Lees. Someone who was closely following the negotiations told Wall Street Journal a few months later that at this point the contact almost broke. Nokia realized that Microsoft was, after all, offering the world’s largest phone manufacturer the standard agreement, even if Nokia was casting all its chips into the game. The Nokians showed their eye for the game. The Microsoft crew knew that Nokia was negotiating with Google. Nokia jumping ship to Android would ruin Microsoft’s chance of a century. Just because of this, Ballmer flew to Helsinki, to assure the Nokians that Redmond was serious.\n\nOn January 10, 2011, Öistämö, together with his colleagues spent the morning in a windowless room in the cellar of a London hotel. Nokia told Microsoft that it wanted freer rights than the competitors to innovate with Windows Phone. The Navteq maps had to be the basis for all Microsoft services. On top of that, Öistämö decided to ask a large sum of money. Öistämö had calculated correctly. Microsoft had come to the conclusion that it could not afford to let Nokia slip from its hands. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, the negotiations proceeded quickly after this. When the parties met for dinner in an Indian restaurant, the agreement was sorted out in time for dessert. The description in the magazine was partially a legend fed to the public. All the items, including the money, were negotiated throughout the fall, but they created a package out of all of them.\n\nThe contract was completely different from what Microsoft had made with other manufacturers. It included marketing money, reduced license fees, and special rights with regards to technology. The road appeared to be opening up. Nokia would get its ecosystem and the driver’s seat for Windows Phone. The special status was only achieved, according to Elop, because Nokia promised to do everything it can for the benefit of Windows Phone. The arrangement included a commitment not to use other smartphone platforms.\n\nThe board got the results put before them on the second week of January.\n\nThe reception was favorable. According to the information the board had, only three people presented questions that were even somewhat critical. Otherwise, the reaction was a poodle-like “sounds good”. The decision was, in the end, unanimous. No one voted against. Microsoft’s terms with its billions of euros were viewed as the best.\n\nIn our interviews some recounted how they actually thought differently.\n\nOne interviewee describes how he found the agreement directly unreasonable. Nokia took a risk, but Microsoft would take most of the profits. Another said how he suspected that Windows Phone was not ready as a product. Also, it was understood that Microsoft had a bad brand reputation. Elop’s activities caused bad feelings. One described how Elop borrowed from his ex-workmates, when talking about the details of the system. Elop seemed to be bypassing the normal communication channels with Microsoft, and gave an impression that he knew more about the product than what he told the board. He was thought to have insider information, which made the board think that he was making his decisions based on better information than the rest. One board member uses the word “blindsided”. Elop gave the understanding that Windows Phone was going strongly upward. In reality, looking back, Google benefited, he estimates.\n\nOne thing that was considered very brazen was Öistämö’s strong support for Windows Phone. MeeGo’s difficulties were, in many people’s opinion, the achievement of Öistämö. He had led the team for 18 months out of the last two years. Now he had become a turncoat and stood behind Elop.\n\nThe board had put forward a proposal, where Windows Phone would be used for the expensive smartphones, and Android for the cheap ones. According to a reliable source, Elop had said that Ballmer would not agree to any special terms, but that Microsoft demanded exclusive rights. The standard agreement for Windows Phone would always be available, but in this case there were billions of euros invested. Microsoft offered so much money in the short term, that the offer was difficult to refuse. When on the other side was Google’s zero-offer, the game started to be clear. Google started getting the message that Nokia was going with the competition.\n\nThe negotiations should have been confidential, so the Nokians were quite shocked when one of Google’s leaders, Vic Gundotra tweeted on February 9:\n\n@vicgundotra\n\n#feb11 “Two turkeys do not make an Eagle”.\n\nThe date of the hashtag pointed at Nokia’s capital markets day, where it was promised that the new strategy would be announced. The hint was easy to understand. “I guess they did not like the decision”, Elop commented on the tweet later.\n\n12. The great bluff\n\nBack to Table of contents\n\nOne wonders how, in connection to the selection of Nokia’s strategy, there was barely any criticism regarding the reasons. Columns, editorials and some analysts explained how Nokia could not differentiate with Android, how it could innovate with Microsoft, how the Nokia-Microsoft ecosystem was the best for network providers and how phones with MeeGo OS would have gotten to the market too late. All like straight from Elop’s mouth.\n\nMany people interviewed for this book attack the reasonings of Elop surprisingly vigorously. Impressions vary from “complete bullshit” to “distorted”.\n\nIn this chapter we will examine the main arguments point by point. The review is partly unfair, since hindsight is always 20/20. Still, it’s valid: Argument proven wrong by time is still wrong. The target is to consider the situations at the time of the decision making, rather than from the viewpoint of what has happened since.\n\nElop’s reasonings can be described with three words: A great bluff.\n\nAccording to the people interviewed, he had immersed himself with everything related to mobile business during the first few months. He knew the platforms, their ecosystems and was excited about the devices all the way to the smallest of details. A good example of this is an interview with a programmer in Financial Times who, as a protest, resigned after February 11, 2011. He described a face-to-face meeting with Elop. Exhibiting deep knowledge of the subject, Elop had made many excellent and detailed questions related to both technology and functionality. To have based his decision on wrong information was an impossibility, according to this programmer. Ergo, he was distorting the facts. Conclusions from interviews within and without Nokia are in line with this thinking.\n\nIn early 2011 Android, MeeGo and Windows Phone were like three sprinters shoulder to shoulder at the finish line. Anyone could become the winner. All had their pros and cons. Once one had been chosen to be a bit better than the others, it was natural to bend the arguments to support the winner. Some of Elop’s arguments were valid. Some were forced to fit the mold. Some were just empty words.\n\nNokia Could Not Differentiate With Android\n\nThis is the argument most used by Elop. According to him, Samsung had taken over Android. Nokia would have become a simple hardware manufacturer, fighting for its existence without proper weapons. The fate of the likes of HTC, LG and SonyEricsson has since validated this argument, according to Elop and Siilasmaa.\n\nThe CEO of one European network provider sees it a bit differently. He thinks Nokia itself proved the argument wrong. After the launch of the first and only MeeGo phone, N9 — less than half a year after publicizing the Microsoft strategy — Nokia clearly differentiated itself from the competition by industrial design, states this CEO. Anyone who held an N9 or a Lumia phone understood that this was a Nokia, not a Samsung. Nokia would have brought a modern, prize-winning design language to the Google ecosystem, differentiating from the competition before the customer would have even turned on the device.\n\nWhat gives this argument some additional weight is the fact that, other than Motorola, all the Android manufacturers came from the Far East. Due to the Asian culture emphasizing authority, design there often takes a backseat according to an industry insider. Designers would rather please their superiors than have strong opinions or wild visions and because of this, Nokia would have had an edge. Scandinavian design principles emphasize clear lines and practicality, he says.\n\nNokia could have also taken full advantage of its brand within the Android world. Taking away the negative aura of Windows Phone and lack of applications affecting the image, Nokia’s brand would have helped to overtake Samsung. It would have been able to differentiate.\n\nNokia had a house full of very capable open-source coders released from MeeGo, ready to create their own UI on top of Android. Nokia maps were better than Google’s; the camera functions better than what the competitors had. What more would you have needed?\n\nHowever, there was a justifiable concern that, with Android, Nokia would be just another hardware manufacturer. That ended up happening regardless.\n\nFormer Apple and HP executive Jean-Louis Gassée put it brilliantly. In his mind, Nokia would have brought gorgeous phone designs to Android and by combining ovi.com applications and services with the existing Android offering, people would have said Nokia has joined a winner. Quite a different image, considering the alternative of binding yourself to a widely hated software giant.\n\nOne Nokia board-level executive says Android was never properly studied. It could have been customized way more than was stated by Elop. This executive also notes, rightly so, that there was practically no way to do any customization on top of the Windows Phone user interface. Poignantly, in June 2014 — after the phones business was already sold to Microsoft — Nokia published a software called Z Launcher. It was basically Nokia’s own UI and user experience on top of Android. The answer to the question “Why this was done?” was revealing — because it was possible.\n\nMeeGo Phones Would Have Gotten To Market Too Slowly\n\nOne interviewee with first-hand knowledge of the matter says this argument is as stupid as it gets. Many people agree. You get as many products out as you have product programs initiated and executed.\n\nElop adopted this thinking from Kai Öistämö and Jo Harlow. In their communication to Elop at the beginning of January 2011 it stated that “with the current speed”, Nokia would have three MeeGo phones out by the year 2014. No doubt, this was true. But you have to consider the phrase “with the current speed”. In reality, Nokia could have brought MeeGo phones to the market faster and with a broader selection than the Lumia offering.\n\nWhy?\n\nWe go back to technology. As said before, MeeGo had been implemented on top of two chipsets. Additionally, in the summer of 2010, contact was made with the chipset vendor ST-Ericsson. The target was to develop an inexpensive but powerful foundation for MeeGo. An employee involved in the project is certain that the resulting features and usability would have been on par with Android. That would have meant three chipset vendors for MeeGo. Windows Phone was confined to one chipset, which limited product variety.\n\nThe stronge"
