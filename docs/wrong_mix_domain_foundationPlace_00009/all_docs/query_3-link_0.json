        "text": "While summer holidays are almost upon us, there is still some time for interesting and fun meetings! üòä It was good to exchange views on the latest EU R&I topics and other current affairs with colleagues from the Finnish Liaison Office for EU R&D (Research Council of Finland | Suomen Akatemia & Business Finland): Katja Marjanen, Hanna Viitala and Niko M√§ntynen√§. üí° We discussed for example von der Leyen's political guidelines for 2024-2029. We are delighted to see a commitment to put research and innovation at the heart of the European economy and increase EU research spending in the new term. Katja Marjanen, Hanna Viitala, Niko M√§ntynen√§, Janne Leino, Rosa Kotoaro\n\nHelsinki EU Office congratulates Ursula von der Leyen on her re-election as President of the European Commission! We look forward to continuing the collaboration towards a more competitive and prosperous EU in the years to come. ü§ùüá™üá∫ We warmly welcome the ambitions outlined in von der Leyen's political guidelines for the next European Commission 2024-2029, including the commitments to: üîµ Strengthen cohesion and growth policy with regions at the centre, designing cohesion policy in partnership with regional and local authorities üîµ Put research and innovation at the heart of our economy üîµ Invest massively in our sustainable competitiveness üîµ Tackle the skills and labour gap Political guidelines for the next European Commission 2024-2029: https://lnkd.in/ewsANEGN\n\nA warm thank you to everyone who attended our summer reception, which we hosted together with Uudenmaan liitto and the Helsingin seudun kauppakamari - Helsinki Region Chamber of Commerce! It was wonderful to spend time with both new and familiar faces here in Brussels from European Commission, European Parliament, Permanent Representation of Finland to the EU, Council of the European Union, Stockholm Region EU Office, Metropoolregio Amsterdam, Hanse-Office Representation of the Bratislava Region to the EU West Finland European Office Kuntaliitto | Kommunf√∂rbundet (Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities) - just to mention a few. During the evening, Tuija Tel√©n, Regional Mayor of Helsinki-Uusimaa, and Pia Pakarinen, CEO of the Helsingin seudun kauppakamari - Helsinki Region Chamber of Commerce, delivered timely messages from Helsinki-Uusimaa to Brussels. The topics discussed included cohesion policy, transport connections, and talent attraction ‚Äî all of which are key priorities for Helsinki-Uusimaa in terms of fostering the EU's competitiveness. Helsinki-Uusimaa‚Äôs messages for the next legislative term: https://lnkd.in/d4-Y34VK Additionally, we enjoyed some magnificent music and an exciting bingo game, with the winners featured in the photos üéµ We wish sunny summer days to all our stakeholders! üåª\n\nüåç Chair of the Board of Helsinki-Uusimaa Regional Council, Markku Markkula, is serving as the rapporteur for the European Committee of the Regions opinion on the future of EU climate policy. Today, we had the honour of hosting a related meeting at our office, focusing on the necessity of systemic transformation. üí¨ Sandrine Dixson-Decl√®ve, President of The Club of Rome, highlighted that cities and regions must be at the center of the Green Deal, focusing not just on decarbonisation but also on addressing people's concrete needs. The Green Deal is as much about competition, security, synergies, and social inclusion as it is about reaching net zero emissions. üó® Markku Markkula echoes this, emphasising that achieving ambitious climate neutrality targets is crucial not only for the #environment but also for enhancing EU's industrial competitiveness, well-being, and security policies. He underscores the vital role of regions and cities in tackling and adapting to climate change. At the Helsinki EU Office, we have good examples as our member cities Helsingin kaupunki ‚Äì Helsingfors stad ‚Äì City of Helsinki, Espoon kaupunki - Esbo stad - City of Espoo and from P√§ij√§t-H√§meen liitto Lahden kaupunki / City of Lahti are involved in the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities‚ôª üèô üí¨ Janne Leino from the Helsinki EU Office added, \"The Helsinki-Uusimaa ranks as Europe's second most competitive and the most socially progressive region, according to recent European Commission data. Our region aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, well ahead of the Commission's 2050 deadlines. Helsinki-Uusimaa is proud to take the lighthouse function and cooperate with other regions. We also advocate for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MMF) to be tightly linked to goals supporting the green transition and innovation.\"üí° Peter Hulshof Eva Gladek Maaike Witteveen Stientje van Veldhoven Kirsten Dunlop Agnieszka Bidzinska Giustino Emilio Piccolo Taina Tukiainen Janne Leino Wilhelmiina Koivuniemi Uudenmaan liitto P√§ij√§t-H√§meen liitto #ClimateAction #EUClimatePolicy #GreenTransition #SystemicTransformation #Decarbonisation #GreenDeal #Competition #Security #SocialInclusion #ClimateNeutral #SmartCities #Sustainability #Helsinki #Espoo #Lahti #ClimateNeutralCities #Innovation #MMF #HorizonEurope #EuropeanCommission #RegionalDevelopment #EUmission"
