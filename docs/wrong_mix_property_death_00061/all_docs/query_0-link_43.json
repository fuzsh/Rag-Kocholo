        "text": "I have gained a reputation for pointing out and demolishing myths in the history of science. One area where these are particularly prevalent is in the history of the European Middle Ages. With numerous people claiming that there was little or no science during this period and what there was, was all wrong, usually blaming this situation on the Catholic Church. The people making these claims completely ignore the quite extensive literature on the history of medieval science written by such excellent historians as David C Lindberg, Edward Grant, Stephen C McCluskey, Bruce S Eastwood, Alastair C Crombie, and John E Murdoch amongst others. For those who don’t wish to plough through the academic literature, there is also a selection of excellent popular books on the subject, which I can warmly recommend. For example, David C Lindberg, The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, Prehistory to A.D. 1450, (Chicago UP, 2nd ed. 2007), or perhaps Seb Falk, The Light Ages: The Surprising Story of Medieval Science(Norton, 2020), which I reviewed here. Finally, James Hannam, God’s Philosophers: How the Medieval World Laid the Foundations of Modern Science, (Icon Books, 2009).\n\nOne of the most persistent myths against which my friend the HISTSCI_HULK has rampaged on several occasions is that, during the European Middle Ages, people believed that the world was flat. Following up on his excellent God’s Philosophers, James Hannam has now delivered the book that should squash that myth for ever, but I fear won’t, The Globe: How the Earth Became Round.[1]\n\nThe blog post title is not just a piss poor play on words of the book’s subtitle, in his just over three-hundred pages, Hannam takes his readers on a journey both chronological and geographically around the world starting around 3000 BCE in the fertile crescent to England in the twentieth century on a wild zig zag course. The opening three chapters give brief but informative accounts of the image of the heavens and the earth of the ancient Babylonians, the ancient Egyptians, and the ancient Persians, all of whom believed in a flat earth with themselves at the centre under a ceiling like heaven, with varying explanations as to where the sun went at night and the moon during the day.\n\nHaving only devoted one brief chapter to each of these great ancient civilisations, Hannam now devotes six chapters to Ancient Greece! Seems unfair but it is here that the main action takes place, over a period of about four centuries the Earth transitioned from flat to spherical in Greek thought and Hannam, here, details each phase of that transition. He proceeds from Archaic Greece, the poems of Homer and Hesiod describing a circular flat earth, moving on to the Origins of Greek Thought, where he is refreshingly sceptical about claims made about Thales’ views. Next up are the Pre-Socratics and Socrates ending with Socrates death. Socrates is, of course followed by Plato and the earliest confirmed mention of a spherical Earth, Plato, in his Phaedo dialogue, supposedly quoting Socrates:\n\n“I assumed that [Anaxagoras] would begin by informing us whether the Earth is flat or round, and then he’d explain why it had to be that way because that was what was better.”[2]\n\nThe following chapter on Plato goes deep into the discussion, as to where and from whom the idea that the Earth is a sphere first comes from, as it is obvious from the way that Plato writes about it that the discussion flat or round was already under way. After Plato comes Aristotle and we have the first clear statement that the Earth is a sphere, why it must be a sphere and empirical evidence that supports the statement that the Earth is a sphere:\n\nAristotle concluded his discission by showing how the theory of the Globe explained observations that might seem otherwise inexplicable. In the first place, he said that when there is a lunar eclipse the shadow of the Earth on the Moon is always curved. This corroborates what he had already shown from his first principles. The umbra during a lunar eclipse follows from the shape of the Earth. If it is a ball, its shadow must always be an arc.\n\nHis second piece of empirical evidence is the way the visible stars change as we travel north or south. He noted that some stars, which are visible in Egypt and Cyprus, can’t be seen in the north. He is almost certainly referring to Eudoxus’ observations of Canopus. It is bright enough to be hard to miss in Egypt, albeit usually low in the sky. Its absence from view in Athens would have been obvious to anyone who had seen it further south. This is only explicable if the Earth is rounded, if it were a flat plane, everyone would see the same stars. Since it is spherical, it’s inevitable that our view of the heavens will change with latitude.[3]\n\nSo, we have reached our objective, Aristotle demonstrated that the Earth is a sphere and not flat. End of story! No! Everything up till now was merely a prelude, the real story is just beginning. Hannam closes his section on Aristotle with the following:\n\nBy any conventional standards he [Aristotle] knew the Earth was a sphere, and he was probably the first person who did. On that basis, he discovered the theory of the Globe. As we will see in the remainder of this book, everyone today who knows the Earth is round indirectly learnt it from Aristotle. This makes the Globe the greatest scientific achievement of antiquity. It’s only because we take it as obvious that we don’t give Aristotle the credit he deserves.[4]\n\nHannam now take his readers of a journey through history and around the globe explaining how different cultures reacted when confronted, either directly or indirectly, with Aristotle’s truth. What their own vision of the Earth’s form was before that confrontation. Who came to accept the new vision, who reacted against it, rejecting. It’s a complex story that Hannam handles with verve, explicating clearly and accurately every twist and turn.\n\nFirst off, Hannam stays with the Greeks and explains how the Stoics, who succeeded Aristotle as philosophical flavour of the century by supporting his conviction that the Earth was a sphere spread and established the view not only amongst the Greek but also the Romans, many leading figures having adopted the Stoic philosophy. The Stoics main rivals, the Epicureans, however, having adopted the cosmological theories of the Atomists reject the sphere maintaining that the Earth was flat. Their rejection of the sphere followed from their belief that the Earth was not the centre of the cosmos, the starting point of Aristotle’s argument for the sphere. Hannam also takes a close look at Greek cartography, if the Earth is a sphere how do you represent in in a flat diagram? Hannam moves on to a discussion of Roman culture and the representation of the Orbis within that culture.\n\nIn these sections Hannam points out that the Greek and Roman terms, such as the Latin Orbis, can mean both circle and sphere. Orbis is etymologically the origin of both orbit, a circle, and orb, a sphere. So, a modicum of caution is required when interpreting the historical texts.\n\nOur journey now takes us through India, the Sassanian Persian Empire, Early Judaism and with it for the first time the Biblical view of the shape of the Earth and on into Christianity. Christianity had of course a problem with the inherent contradiction between the Bible, the infallible word of God, and the words of Aristotle. This led to a spirited discussion in the early Church that Hannam explicates, with his usual clarity. There was not just one but multiple discussion in the various early Christian communities. He we get one of the most notorious flat earther from antiquity, Cosmas Indicopleutes, who often gets quoted by those claiming that the people in the Middle Ages believed the world to be flat. The last of the so-called Abrahamic religions, Islam, comes next. With once again multiple discussion in particular about the discrepancy between the Koran and Aristotle. We had early Judaism now we have later Judaism in particular Moses Maimonides.\n\nEurope in the Early Middle Ages is our next port of call. Mostly Aristotelian, most notably Augustine, but with exceptions most notably Lactantius, who would later feature in Copernicus’ De revolutionibus. Of interest here is Isidore of Seville (c.560-636) one of the most important encyclopaedists from late antiquity, who is in his writing more that ambiguous abut the shape of the Earth. Hannam argues fairly convincingly that, although he accepted Ptolemy’s astronomy and cosmology, he was a flat earther. However, Jürgen Hamel in his Die Vorstellung von der Kugelgestalt der Erde in europäischen Mittelalter bis zum Ende des 13. Jahrhunderts – dargestellt nach den Quellen,[5] (an excellent book if you can read German) agues equally convincingly that he wasn’t. I guess with Isidore, you pays your money and makes your choice.\n\nMoving on to the next chapter, High Medieval Views of the World: ‘The Earth has the shape of a globe’, we are well into the territory of those promoting the myth that people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat; a myth that Hannam proceeds to demolish with style. The money quote is:\n\nTake the coronation orb, which has been part of the regalia presented to kings and emperors from late antiquity. The orb represents the Earth, while the cross on top symbolises that the secular power was subject to the will of God. Presumably, if people in the Middle Ages had thought the Earth was flat, they would have presented their rulers with a diner plate instead.[6]\n\nWe move into the Early Modern Period with Columbus and Copernicus: ‘New worlds will be found,’ where Hannam also demolishes the myth that people thought Columbus would fall of the edge of the world and the equally stupid myth that Columbus proved that the world was round. We get a brief guest appearance of the world’s oldest surveying terrestrial globe, Martin Behaim’s Erdapfel (1492-94).\n\nColumbus is followed naturally by Magellan and the first circumnavigation. The chapter closes with a brief look at what Copernicus has to say about the shape of the Earth and also why he said it.\n\nChina’s tradition view of the Earth and its reaction to the idea that it is actually a globe is a difficult and complex story, stretching over two chapters, which Hannam manages to relate with his usually sureness and style.\n\nMoving into the modern period brief nods at the attempts to measure the size of the globe and the problems of determining longitude lead into the eighteenth-century dispute over the actual shape of the Earth, Newton & Huygens vs the Cassinis, oblate spheroid or prolate spheroid and the only part of Hannam’s entire narrative that I think is slapdash and shoddy. This is one of the most important episodes in the history of geodesy that also had ramifications for the theory of gravity and led to an indirect proof of diurnal rotation. It deserves more that Hannam’s sloppy two paragraph account.\n\nThis penultimate chapter contains two further sections, the first are brief accounts of explorers and missionaries bringing the news of the spherical shape of the Earth to communities that still hadn’t received it and how they reacted. The second is a brief account of the origins of modern Flat-Earth supporters in the nineteenth century. The final chapter continues with the flat earthers of the twentieth century. For theses two sections Hannam’s primary source is Christine Garwood’s excellent Flat Earth: The History of an Infamous Idea,[7] which I highly recommend if you are interested in the topic. The chapter proceeds with brief accounts of Draper-White conflict thesis and then moves on to the modern fantasy authors C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Terry Pratchett, who all knew better but still placed their fantasy novels in flat earth medieval settings.\n\nHannam’s book has extensive endnotes that mostly refer to the equally extensive bibliography. The book also has an extensive index. The book is richly illustrated but in the proof copy I was supplied with to write this review they are unfortunately very poor quality grey scale reproductions. I can only assume that they are better in the published version of the book.\n\nJames Hannam’s book is truly first class and should become a standard work on the topic. He covers a very wide range of material in a comparatively small number of pages. Each section of the book is relatively brief but concise, historically accurate, and highly informative. He writes extremely well, and his prose is clear and light to read. Anybody who takes the trouble to read this book will at the end know when, where and how the various populations of the Earth became aware that their home was on a large sphere floating through space. A fact first truly recognised by Aristotle in the fourth century BCE and slowly disseminated around the globe over a period of more than two thousand years. Hannam has produce a first-class documentation of that dissemination.\n\n[1] James Hannam, The Globe: How the Earth Became Round, Reaction Books, London, 2023\n\n[2] Hannam p. 75\n\n[3] Hannam p. 93\n\n[4] Hannam p. 97\n\n[5] Jürgen Hamel, Die Vorstellung von der Kugelgestalt der Erde in europäischen Mittelalter bis zum Ende des 13.

As the computer age mutated into the information age, algorithm became one of the buzz words, echoing around the world and seeming to transmute from a piece of vocabulary into a sentient being. Social media became littered with talk of sexist algorithms, racists algorithms, blind algorithms… With the supposed rise of AI, the much vaunted and eagerly sort after, but at the same time feared, artificial intelligence, talk turned to the search for the elusive intelligent algorithm. In little more than the seventy years since the Second World War the word algorithm has come to occupy a dominant position in much of the public discourse.\n\nBut what exactly does the word algorithm mean? Where did it come from? What is an algorithm? The word algorithm has an almost thousand-year history and over the centuries its meaning has mutated and evolved and the computer algorithms of today are not the same as the algebraic algorithms of medieval mathematics. Jeffrey M Binder, who describes himself as a programmer, historian, and writer, has written a book, Language and the Rise of the Algorithm,[1] which tracks those mutations and the evolution of the current meaning of the word algorithm over the time since it first appeared in the early thirteenth century.\n\nI will start my review by saying that Binder’s book is excellent and if you have any interest in the topic at all then you should definitely read it. It certainly has the potential to become a classic in the tangled field of the histories of mathematics, language, logic, and computer science.\n\nAs Binder points out early in the introduction algebra was introduced into Europe by the Latin translation of Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī’s al-Kitāb al-Mukhtaṣar fī Ḥisāb al-Jabr wal-Muqābalah in the twelfth century; its title gave us the word algebra and the mangled transliteration of his name into Latin the term algorithm. Because algebra is the practice of doing mathematics with symbols a large part of Binder’s book is a review over the centuries of how algebra was perceived, understood, and accepted or not. Part of that perception involved the question whether symbolic algebra was a language, so the book also traces the thoughts on the nature of language over the same period.\n\nCentral to Binder’s narrative is his systematic debunking of the commonly held belief that the computer age was heralded by Leibniz with his calculating machine and his attempts to create a calculus ratiocinator to resolve differences of opinion, expressed in the famous quote:\n\nThe only way to rectify our reasonings is to make them as tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so that we can find our error at a glance, and when there are disputes among persons, we can simply say: Let us calculate, without further ado, to see who is right.\n\nTo a certain extent the book is divided into three sections pre-Leibniz, Leibniz, post-Leibniz. A finer division is presented in the fact that the book takes the reader chronologically through the history of symbolic mathematics, and the evolution of symbolic logic out of it from the sixteenth century down to the present. Throughout this journey Binder shows how the various actors used and or defined the concept of the algorithm and how the term took on differently meanings in different contexts. He shows how the term algorithm, that today non-experts seem to consider has always meant roughly the same, has actually been a linguistic chameleon taking on many different meanings over the last eight hundred years.\n\nBinder packs far too much detailed information and analysis into each chapter of his book for me to attempt a detailed chapter by chapter review. To do so I would probably end up writing a review as long as the book itself. I can’t see anything of real relevance that Binder has left out of his account despite the fact that his book is hardly more that two hundred pages long. I will, however, give brief outlines of the five chapters and coda.\n\nThe opening chapter is a whirlwind tour of the introduction of both the Hindu-Arabic number system and algebra in the medieval and early modern periods, starting with Brahmagupta in the sixth century and ending with Descartes’ unification of algebra in the seventeenth century. The Hindu-Arabic number system because as Binder correctly points out algorithm, usually then spelt algorism, was the name for the rules governing the use of this new arithmetic. Despite its brevity this tour is excellently done.\n\nThe second chapter starts in the seventeenth century, enter Leibniz and his attempt to create a universal symbolic language that translates natural language. This chapter looks not only at Leibniz’s thoughts on language, both symbolic and natural, but at this of other protagonists of the so-called scientific revolution, in particular John Wilkins but also George Delgarno, John Ray, Descartes, Locke et al. It also covers the discussion amongst the mathematicians of the use of symbolism in the newly created calculus of Leibniz and Newton.\n\nMoving into the eighteenth century, the third chapter centres on the thoughts on language, algebra, and symbolism of Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, Marquis de Condercet. As in the previous chapter there is a list of significant contributors to the debates on these topics such as Locke, Euler, Jean Le Rond d’Alembert, and the Abbé de Condillac. A central question that is discussed by these participants, is algebra a language? Once more Binder covers a complex of thoughts and ideas briefly but comprehensively and clearly. There follows an account of the thoughts of the English mathematician, Francis Maseres, who firmly rejected the modern, continental thoughts on the relationship between algebra and language. I found particularly interesting that at this late date Maseres still had problems with the acceptance of negative numbers. For me surprisingly, this view was shared by his associate the political radical, Willian Frend, after all Frend’s eldest daughter Sophia Elizabeth married Augustus De Morgan. This is followed by a highly informative essay on an English ally of Condorcet, Charles Mohon, third Earl of Stanhope, the creator of the Stanhope Demonstrator, a logic machine. The chapter closes with rumination on Immanuel Kant and how he fits or doesn’t into these ongoing debates.\n\nThroughout these chapters Binder draws the readers attention to the varying and various ways that the proponents in the diverse debates used and defined both implicitly and explicitly the term algorithm.\n\nIn terms of symbolic systems, language, and logic, the nineteenth century saw the dawning of a new age that Binder takes us through in his fourth chapter. At the centre of this new perception is George Boole and his algebraic logic. Boole divorces his logical symbols from natural language. The symbols are no longer defined in terms of an interpretation in natural language but instead through the rules of the system for their use. They don’t not have a single fixed linguistic interpretation but can be used to stand for many different things. Binder’s presentation of Boole’s logic and his motivations for creating it is excellent. Although Boole separated logic and natural language Binder points out that this development ran parallel to the new theories on the genesis of language developed by the Romantics.\n\nThe introduction to Boole is followed by an essay on the calculating wonder Zerah Colburn and the question as to whether the methods he used could be generalised as algorithms for others to learn. This is followed by the work on symbolic mathematics produced by the Cambridge Analytical Society, in particular the algebra of George Peacock, leading into a wide ranging examination of the thoughts of many other nineteenth century thinkers including Józef Wroński, John Venn, William Wordsworth, Maria Edgeworth, Mary Everest Boole, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Augustus De Morgan, William Stanley Jevons, Ernst Schröder, Gottlob Frege, and others through which Binder weaves the thoughts and concepts of Boole.\n\nChapter five takes us into the twentieth century and finally into the age of the computer. Before the arrival of the computer, we have the meta-logical/meta-mathematical theories of Church, Post, and Turing setting the formal limits on what can and what cannot be calculated or computed. It is nice to see Post getting the credit that is due to him for once, he so often gets overlooked. Of course, Gödel gets a look in as do Andrey Markov, and Stephen Kleene. The latter two with varying definitions of the algorithm. There is a long discourse on the meta-logical and philosophical debates in mathematics and logic kicked off by Whitehead and Russell, with their Principia, involving Carnap, Turing, Wittgenstein, Church et all.\n\nNear the end of this section is my favourite paragraph in the whole book, because of my perpetual war with the “Alan Turing invented the computer blockheads.”\n\nThat one must think of computing machines in terms of either of these models is not self-evident. Babbage had already imagined a programmable computer a century before Church and Turing, and the designers of some early computers, such as Konrad Zuse (1936–38) and the IBM Mark I (1939–43), were initially unaware of their work. John Von Neumann, often held up as the designer of the standard computer architecture, knew Turing personally and was deeply familiar with his paper on the decision problem, but it is not clear that Turing’s imaginary machines had any strong influence on his plan. Yet Church and Turing did eventually become common reference points for the discipline of computer science. The most important thing they provided was less a paradigm for the design of actual machines that a theoretical framework for reasoning mathematically about what came to be called “algorithm.” [2]\n\nThe computer has arrived and with it computer programming languages, at the beginning COBOL, FORTRAN, and ALGOL. We meet Grace Hopper, one of the later creators of COBOL, and her invention of the compiler–a program that automatically translates a human-readable sequence of instruction into a machine-executable form[3]. This presaged a minor program language war in the early days that Binder outlines. Some wanted to make programming languages more symbolic, mathematical, and strictly formal to avoid the pitfalls made obvious by the meta-logical results of Church, Turing et al. Other aware of the potential market for computer use by non-mathematicians and non-logicians wanted to write programs in more normal languages to make them accessible to these potential users. Binder points to the emergence of the Apple computer as a vindication for the user friendly party in this dispute.\n\nBinder now considers the story of ALGOL, usually explained as algorithmic language although the original name was International Algebraic Language, which he sees “as a major factor in securing the widespread adoption of algorithm as a general term for computational procedures.”[4] The aim of ALGOL was it seems to produce a universal language for describing algorithms. The aims and failures of the ALGOL program are discussed in quite a lot of detail in comparison to other approaches to programming, leading into a wider discussion of approaches to creating computer algorithms.\n\nBinder opens his introduction with the following paragraph:\n\nIn May 2020, as much of the world focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and as racial justice protests took place across the United States, a technical development sparked excitement and fear in narrow circles. A computer program called GPT-3, developed by the OpenAI company, produced some of the best computer-generated imitations of human writing yet seen: fake news articles that were, according to the authors, able to fool human readers nearly half the time, and poems in the style of Wallace Stevens.[5]\n\nHis journey through the history of the algorithm ends with a twenty-one-page coda, The Age of Arbitrariness, which deals with the newly emerging age of machine learning and the associated change in the meaning of algorithm.\n\nIf classical algorithms are divided from human understanding, they are also divided from data.\n\n[…]\n\nMachine learning (ML) changes this. The “algorithms” are no longer designed by engineers but instead tuned by machines based on large amounts of data.[6]\n\nBinder closes out his book ruminating on this difference.\n\nBinder has obviously invested an enormous amount of research in his book, a fact that is reflected in the 991 endnotes from just 225 pages of text, most of which refer to the 35-page bibliography of books and papers he consulted. The book also has a good index.\n\nI have only two very minor negative comments on this excellent book. At one point Binder refers to “abacus and counting board” as if they were two separate things. The counting board is an abacus, Binder obviously doesn’t know that the wire and bead frame abacus that people now think of when they read the word abacus didn’t enter Europe until the early eighteenth century well after the use of the counting board had ceased to be used in everyday calculating. My other problem is that he twice refers to Martin Davis as a popular science writer when referencing one of Davis’ popular books, The Universal Computer: The Road from Leibniz to Turing (3rded. CRC Press, 2018). Given the subject of his own research, Binder really should know that Martin Davis was one of the 20th centuries leading meta-mathematicians/meta-logicians!\n\nIn his journey from al-Khwārizmī to GPT-3 Binder covers an incredible amount of complex material in a comparatively small number of pages. However, his writing is never cluttered or in anyway incomprehensible, it is always clear, lucid, and easy to follow and somewhat surprisingly, given to topic, actually a pleasure to read. As I said above, it certainly has the potential to become a classic in the tangled field of the histories of mathematics, language, logic, and computer science and I very much think it deserves to do so.\n\n[1] Jeffrey M.

For more general details on both the author and his book see the first post in this series.\n\nToday, I’m looking at Strathern’s chapter on Vesalius. It goes without saying that Strathern evokes the mythical religious taboo on dissection of the human body.\n\nThe dissection of human bodies had been a religious taboo in the western world since well before the birth of Christ. This taboo extended through all Abrahamic religions – i.e. Judaism, Christianity and Islam – as well as most of the heterodox sects and cults which pervaded the Mediterranean region and the rest of Europe.\n\nWhilst there was a prohibition on the dissection of human cadavers from about 150 BCE in Ancient Rome that affected the work of Galen (129–c. 216 CE), who as Strathern reports carried out most of his anatomical work on animals, which of course led to anatomical errors; there was no taboo in the European Middle Ages or the Renaissance, when Leonardo, yes, he gets discussed too, and Vesalius carried out their anatomical studies. Human dissection had already begun in the fourteenth century with the work of Mondino de Luzzi (C. 1270–1326) and by 1400 regular anatomical dissections were an established part of the curriculum in most medical schools. Strathern then delivers up another of his errors on authority:\n\nDespite such mistakes, Galen’s ‘authority’ on medical matters reigned supreme throughout the medieval era, alongside that of Aristotle. Not until the Renaissance would his errors come to light.\n\nGalen was just one of several medical authors whose texts were used on the medieval universities and despite challenges continued to be used throughout the Renaissance. In fact, there was during the Renaissance a strong neo-Galenic movement that challenged Vesalius.\n\nIt’s almost unavoidable that Strathern, like everybody else, includes Leonardo, he writes:\n\nA century prior to Vesalius, Leonardo da Vinci’s obsessive curiosity led him to carry out dissections of human cadavers, which he recorded in his notebooks. By now the prohibition of such activities had become somewhat more relaxed, though they remained frowned upon.\n\nAs already noted, there was no prohibitions and Leonardo, like all the apprentices of Andrea del Verrochio (1435–1488), who insisted that his apprentices gain a thorough grounding in anatomy, would have attended dissections as an apprentice.\n\nLeonardo carried out systematics anatomical investigations together with Marcantonio della Torre (1481–1511), lecturer on anatomy at the universities of Pavia and Padua, between 1510 and 1511. Vesalius’ principle anatomical work, his De fabrica, of which more later, was published in 1543. According to my arithmetic that is a span of thirty-one years and not a century. Maybe Strathern uses a different number system?\n\nWe get no account of Leonardo’s systematic work with Andrea del Verrochio this would spoil the image that Strathern creates of the chaotic nature of Leonardo’s work and notes. We do, however get a lengthy anecdote about his dissection of a man who claimed to be one hundred years old. Then Strathern drops the following gem:\n\nBut why this diversion? What possible relevance does such work by Leonardo have to the northern Renaissance? In fact, none. And that is the point. By recounting these pioneering anatomical experiments – unique in their breadth, depth and explication – we gain an insight into the immense difficulties involved in human dissection during this period. We can also witness the birth of a new, forbidden science coming into being. Or apparently so. For this infant body of learning would not survive its premature birth – stillborn before it could draw breath – largely through the procrastination of Leonardo himself.\n\nAs already stated, we do not have “the birth of a new, forbidden science”, dissection of human cadavers was routine by the time that Leonardo was active. Also, if he poses the question, “What possible relevance does such work by Leonardo have to the northern Renaissance?” then he must also pose it for Vesalius, who although he came from the Netherlands did all his anatomical work in Padua and was very much an integral part of the Italian Renaissance.\n\nWe then get a brief description of the fate of Leonardo’s papers and drawings which closes with the repeat of the arithmetical error:\n\nWorking a century later, Vesalius would remain unaware of Leonardo’s pioneering work, which remained lost to history.\n\nLeonardo lived from 1452 to 1519, Vesalius was born in 1514 and carried out his anatomical work in Padua beginning in 1537, publishing the De fabrica in 1543. No matter how I try I can’t make a century out of these dates! The century is merely a lead into a piece of pseudo historical pathos:\n\nSuch a lacuna leads one to speculate on how much more, of genuine worth, was lost during this period. Such discovery and progress had little place in the medieval era. The Renaissance would have to find its own way of accommodating and preserving the innovations it produced. All we know are the successes which eluded loss or destruction: Copernicus’s revolutionary work published by his friends and gifted to him on his deathbed; Paracelsus’s haphazard discoveries, and superstitious lapses, disseminated by means of Gutenberg’s invention, which was itself wrested from the hands of its creator. In this aspect, more than most, no history can be any more than an incomplete account. Fortunately for history, Vesalius would do his utmost to gainsay this fact, his work being both painstaking and thorough from the outset. And his motives throughout his long and arduous task would be single-mindedly focused on public recognition and public reward.\n\nIn the history of science many new ideas, theories and discoveries have been lost, forgotten, or suffered a delayed reception. The reasons are numerous but, and it’s a very big but, they were not somehow actively repressed during the Middle Ages as Strathern would have us believe. I have already pointed out in my review of the chapter on Copernicus, his work was not published by his friends in an act of deception as Strathern claims, but he sent his book to Petreius in Nürnberg to be published himself. Paracelsus’ work was mostly posthumously printed and published by his disciples, a case of late reception and in Gutenberg’s case, if you build up your business with large sums of borrowed cash and then get into a dispute with your financier, then you tend to lose your business. However, the invention of printing with moveable type was in no way effected by Gutenberg’s financial problems. Strathern’s examples don’t illustrate his argument at all.\n\nWe now arrive at Vesalius and the usual brief biography. Strathern tries to paint his father as somehow inferior and suffering from an inferiority complex. Claiming that it was his mother who raised him and set him on his way entering him, like Mercator and Gemma Frisius before him, in a school of the Brotherhood of the Common life, in his case in Brussels. It was actually his father who entered him in the school. Like Mercator and Gemma Frisius, Vesalius now entered the University of Leuven, and Strathern displays his total ignorance of the medieval university system:\n\nSurprisingly, Vesalius did not register at the school of medicine, but instead chose to study the arts and humanities, which included learning Latin and Greek, at which he thrived. (The books in his grandfather’s library would mostly have been written in Latin, and Vesalius almost certainly had extended his schoolboy Latin by reading these works.) After young Vesalius graduated with a good arts degree in 1532, he was accepted to study at the prestigious University of Paris, where he entered the school of medicine. Only now did he begin the formal study of this subject.\n\nOn the medieval university the undergraduate course of study, in the lower faculty, was nominally the seven liberal arts. First when a student had graduated from the lower faculty, was he permitted to matriculate in one of the higher faculties to study, theology, law, or medicine. So, it was not a surprise that “Vesalius did not register at the school of medicine.”\n\nWe get some more misinformation from Strathern:\n\nDespite its reputation, the University of Paris remained firmly committed to the teachings of Aristotle, and its school of medicine was still dominated by the 1,300-year-old ideas of Galen. Lectures in practical anatomy were a comparatively rare novelty, having only recently received limited Church dispensation [my emphasis].\n\nLectures in practical anatomy were a standard part of the medical curriculum in Paris, there being no Church restriction on them as I’ve already explained above. Strathern contradicts himself by explaining that anatomical lectures, with public dissections, were a standard part of the curriculum, although he correctly observes that the student were only allowed to observe but not to dissect themselves. He notes correctly that the one professor of anatomy, Jacobus Sylvius (1478–1555) was a strict adherent of Galen but that another, Johann Winter von Andernach (1505–1574) was more open minded and even allowed students to participate in dissections. Winter became Vesalius’ mentor and even employed Vesalius as an assistant in the preparation of his four volume Institutiones anatomicae (Paris, 1536) for the press, praising him in the preface; it would become a standard work, of which Vesalius published a second updated edition in 1539. It should, however, be pointed out that Winter was one of those who triggered to renaissance in Galenic anatomy when he produced and published a Latin translation of Galen’s newly discovered and most important De Anatomicis Administrationibus (On Anatomical Procedures) 9 vols. Paris in 1531, which Strathern doesn’t mention at all.\n\nStrathern delivers up some waffle about what happened next when Vesalius was forced by war to leave Paris and return to the Netherlands, where he re-entered the University of Leuven to complete his medicine degree. Here he wrote his doctoral thesis and Strathern once again displays his ignorance:\n\nAt the same time, Vesalius began composing his graduation thesis. Interestingly, he chose for his subject the tenth-century Persian physician and alchemist known in the west as Rhazes. (In the Arabic world his full name was Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi.) The important fact about Rhazes was that he not only based his science upon the experiments he conducted himself, but he also wrote these out in detail, step by step. This meant that they could be precisely repeated by other scientists. Here, reliance upon the word of a universal and unchanging ‘authority’ was skilfully circumvented.\n\nThis important lesson would soon begin to permeate the world of science in both the northern and the Italian Renaissance. The days when scientists – from mathematicians to alchemists – kept their discoveries secret in order to gain advantage over their rivals were coming to an end. Science was entering the public domain. Experimenters would publish their work in books, and their results could be verified (or shown to be faulty) by their peers.\n\nVesalius’ doctoral thesis was actually Paraphrasis in nonum librum Rhazae medici Arabis clarissimi ad regem Almansorem, de affectuum singularum corporis partium curatione, a commentary on the ninth book of Rhazes.\n\nStrathern tries to make it seem as if Vesalius’ thesis was in somehow exceptional in its choice of topic and in some way ground-breaking, whereas it was perfectly normal. The book of Rhazes referred to here is his The Virtuous Life (al-Hawi), a nine-volume posthumous collection of his medical notebooks, which was translated into Latin in the late thirteenth century and was a standard textbook in the medical faculties of the European medieval universities, so there was nothing exception about Vesalius writing his doctoral thesis on part of it. Strathern continues:\n\nVesalius’s reputation as a talent of great promise seems to have spread far and wide, almost certainly aided by Andernach’s description of him in Institutiones Anatomicae. Immediately upon his graduation from Leuven, Vesalius received an invitation to become a professor of anatomy and surgery at the University of Padua, one of the finest centres of scientific research in Italy.\n\nThis proving that Vesalius was very much part of the Italian Renaissance and not the Northern Renaissance! Now Strathern starts off on a path where he will begin to mix fact with fiction:\n\nMore importantly for Vesalius, Padua was just twenty miles from Venice, the commercial and cultural capital of the region, and it was here that he met the German-born artist Jan von Calcar, who had served his apprenticeship under Titian. Calcar’s particular talents were his ability to imitate the works of others and his supreme skill with woodcuts.\n\nIn 1538 Vesalius collaborated with Calcar on the production of his first anatomical text, Tabulae Anatomicae Sex (Six Anatomical Charts.) Three of these charts were produced by Calcar, taken from a full-scale skeleton of the human body which Vesalius had put together. The other three made use of charts which Vesalius himself had drawn for lectures to his students.\n\nAlthough the story is well document, Strathern can’t get the facts right. The Tabulae Anatomicae Sex were originally six large, woodcut, wall posters that Vesalius had created for his lecture theatre. He discovered that students were copying them, so he decided to make a professional printed edition of them. Of the printed edition the first three were entirely his own work but for the second set of three he employed Jan van Calcar. Strathern notes correctly that here Vesalius corrects some of Galen’s anatomical errors but repeats some others.\n\nStrathern now delivers up a classic historical myth in a footnote:\n\nFrom now on, the more Vesalius continued with his investigations of the human body, the bolder he became. By this stage he had reached an agreement with the Paduan authorities, who allowed him to dissect the regular supply of cadavers of prisoners executed on the gallows. Vesalius’s retelling of how he carried out his researches paints a vivid, if lurid, picture. He described how he ‘would keep in my bedroom for several weeks bodies from graves or given me after public executions’. How did his neighbours put up with the appalling stench? To say nothing of their suspicions that he might be indulging in necromancy or demonology? The answer is that they may well have been unable to distinguish the stench from the general pervasive malodorousness.*\n\n* During this era the waterways of Padua, like the canals of Venice and its nearby lagoon, emitted powerful smells, especially in the summer. This was hardly helped by the customary lack of bathing and personal hygiene which pervaded all classes throughout Europe. [my emphasis] Indeed, such habits accounted for the constant use of sweet- smelling nosegays in genteel society. These consisted of flowers or herbs intended to mask the sense of smell. It is said that in Venice a certain type of nosegay evolved which went further, using citrus oil or extracts of resin intended to numb the olfactory sense altogether, rather than simply distracting it.\n\nThe sentence that I have emphasised is, unfortunately, a widespread myth and total piffle! Europeans in the Renaissance bathed regularly and took great care of their personal hygiene. Nobody claiming to be an academic historian, as Strathern does, should be repeating this garbage in 2023! On the subject of demonology Strathern drops the following gem:\n\nAs for the suspicion that Vesalius might have been involved in occult practices – presumably he remained under the protection and good name of the university. This was still an era when a large majority of the population believed in demonology, witchcraft and the like – general superstition was rife. Here was one area where the power of the Church and its insistence on orthodoxy was beneficial: in its suppression of heretical practices and beliefs, it undoubtedly reduced the credulity [my emphasis] which led to the outbreaks of mass hysteria that were prevalent during this period.\n\nIt was the Church with its insistence on the real existence of the Devil, demons, black magic, witches, and all the rest that was the main driving force fuelling the credulity.\n\nIt is now that Strathern begins mixing fact with fiction or maybe fantasy.\n\nVesalius now began assembling, together with Calcar, the large, precisely delineated drawings that would become the body of the master- piece which assured his lasting place in medical history. Apart from Leonardo’s, previous books containing anatomical illustrations had tended to be schematic, or cartoon-like, mostly drawn by their medical author – whose talent would often be amateurish at best. By contrast, Vesalius’s De Humani Corporis Fabrica (The Apparatus of the Human Body) would not only be comprehensive and encyclopedic in its knowledge, but its precise illustrations would also be works of art as much as science. Calcar’s large exact drawings, made under Vesalius’s painstaking direction, would in their own distinctly different style be a match for the as-yet-unseen drawings of Leonardo.* Meanwhile Vesalius’s text would set medicine free from the stranglehold of Galen.\n\nThat Calcar was the artist, who created the illustration in De fabrica is an unsubstantiated claim made by Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) in his Le Vite de’ più eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori (Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects), 1st edition 1550, 2nd expanded edition 1558, a book not exactly renowned for its historical accuracy. There is no mention in the De fabrica, who the artist actually was. In a footnote in her The Scientific Renaissance 1450–1630 (ppb. Dover, 1994) Marie Boas Hall writes about the illustrations:\n\nThese are attributed to Jan Stephen van Calcar (1499–c. 1550) by the sixteenth-century art historian, Vasari. Modern students have doubted this, because the figures are as superior to those of the Tabulae Sex as the text of the Fabrica is to that of the earlier work–though it is possible that the artist had learned as rapidly as the author. In place of Jan Stephen van Calcar, the only candidate is an unknown, also a member of Titian’s studio. It seems difficult to believe that so spirited a draughtsman as the artist who drew the pictures for the Fabrica should be otherwise unknown; though it is odd that Vesalius, who had given Jan Stephen credit for his work on the Tabulae Sex, did not mention the name of the artist of the Fabrica.\n\nIt has also been speculated that is unlikely that a single artist created all 273 illustrations in such a short period of time. So, Jan van Calcar as the author of the medical illustrations in De fabrica is anything but an established fact but this doesn’t stop Strathern writing the following in a footnote to the paragraph quoted above:\n\n* Such artistry did not come cheap. Indeed, Vesalius was unable to pay Calcar, and in lieu of a fee he signed over to the artist any future profits the Fabrica would make.\n\nEither Strathern is making things up or he is quoting a source, which he doesn’t name, that is making things up without checking on the accuracy of the claim made. It doesn’t stop here. Later in his lengthy description of the book itself he writes:\n\nAlas, Vesalius’s perfectionism would result in an increasing number of quarrels with Calcar. Breaks in their collaboration now followed, and Vesalius began drawing a number of the anatomical illustrations in the Fabrica himself.\n\nA couple of paragraphs further on:\n\nBy now, it appears, Calcar had quit the project altogether. We must imagine him storming off in some indignation at Vesalius’s tenacious insistence upon the minutest detail. (This was woodcut, remember, not drawing; erasure was no simple matter with a gouged wooden surface.)\n\nHere also Strathern appears to not know the difference between the artist and the woodblock cutter. Calcar or whoever was the artist, would draw the images onto the surface of the woodblock, but the actual cutting would be done by a professional woodblock cutter and not the artist.\n\nI’m not going to do a blow-by-blow analysis of Strathern’s long account of De fabrica, as this review is already over long, but just mention a couple of salient points. To start with Strathern makes no mention of the fact that just as Copernicus modelled De revolutionibus on the Epytoma…in Almagestum Ptolomei of Peuerbach and Regiomontanus, so Vesalius modelled his De fabrica on Galen’s De Anatomicis Administrationibus (On Anatomical Procedures), which as I mentioned above was first translated into Latin and published by his mentor Johann Winter von Andernach.\n\nAt one point Strathern tells us, “As the work continues, the illustrations become less precise and their interpretation less exact.” The final chapter of De fabrica, Book VII, deals with the brain and Strathern writes, apparently contradicting himself, “Ensuing books of the Fabrica would prove similarly perceptive – especially Vesalius’s investigations of the human brain.” Do these images appear imprecise to you?\n\nStrathern also writes, And the illustration of the pregnant uterus containing a foetus is undeniably medieval in its crudity…” Vesalius has no illustration of the pregnant uterus containing a foetus;maybe he was confusing it with the illustration of the placenta with its attached foetus?\n\nHaving completed his tour of De fabrica, Strathern now jumps the shark!\n\nWhen he had completed the manuscript of Fabrica, he sent the text and illustrations north to Basel in Switzerland. This was the home of Johannes Oporinus, who sixteen years previously had worked as Paracelsus’s long-suffering assistant. Oporinus had now succeeded Paracelsus as a rather more orthodox professor of medicine in Basel. He also happened to come from a family renowned for their printing and engraving skills, and combined his medical knowledge with an expert understanding of the entire printing process. This was the only man in Europe whom Vesalius could trust with the production of his masterwork.\n\nJohannes Oporinus (1507–1568) had very little to do with Paracelsus, he was merely for a brief period in 1527 his famulus. The son of a painter he studied law and Hebrew at Basel University, whilst working as a proofer in the print workshop of Johann Froben (c. 1460–1527). He also worked as a schoolteacher for Latin. From 1538 to 1542, he was professor for Greek at the University of Basel, resigning to devote himself fulltime to his own print workshop.\n\nStrathern closes his chapter on Vesalius with a long-winded account of further biography as Imperial physician to Charles V and later Philip II. Strathern of course cannot resist including the unsubstantiated anecdote that in Spain Vesalius started to carry out an autopsy on a corpse only to discover that the man wasn’t actually dead. There are numerous cases of this happening throughout history, and it even still occasionally occurs today, but whether it actually happened to Vesalius is, as I said, unsubstantiated.\n\nIn his chapter on Vesalius, as usual Strathern delivers up a collection of inaccuracies, myths, and in the case of the relationship between Vesalius and Calcar some pure fantasy. Once more I am forced to ask how did this book ever get published?\n\nThere is a widespread misconception amongst people, who are not particularly good at mathematics that mathematicians can do mathematics, by which I mean that a mathematicians can do the whole range of subdisciplines that are collected together under the term mathematics. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is claimed that there is a fundamental divide between mathematicians who think in diagrams, i.e., at the entry level geometry, and those who think in symbols, i.e., algebra and analysis. Not that I’m a mathematician but I certainly think in symbols, not diagrams. At a higher level, most mathematicians have a special discipline where they are at home and excel and other disciplines that that they have difficulties even comprehending. When I studied mathematics at university the introductory courses were allotted in rotation to the professors. My introductory analysis lectures were held by a really sweet guy, who was a world-renowned finite group theory specialist, where world renowned means that the fifty people in the world in his field all knew him. One day he came into the lecture hall and said, “today we should start with step functions, but I’ve never understood them, so we’ll do something else instead.”\n\nAlthough I studied mathematics at university up to about BSc level, worked in a research project into mathematical logic for a number of years, and have tutored school leaving/university entrance level (A-level, Abitur, Baccalauréat etc.) mathematics for the last twenty years, I do not consider myself a mathematician. Having said that, I definitely have my strengths and weaknesses in different mathematical disciplines. I could always do basic calculus without even think about it, in fact it was my love of calculus that led me into the history of mathematics, when I discovered that Newton and Leibniz had both invented/discovered (choose your preferred term) calculus independently of each other. I later discovered that this wasn’t true but that’s another story. An entry level discipline which I could never get my head around was probability theory and statistics and I used to groan inwardly when I had to teach them to one of my private pupils.\n\nWhen I studied mathematics at school before the second ice age, I did A-level maths, probability theory and statistics were not part of the curriculum. However, teaching Abitur in Germany over the last four years probability theory and statistics were very much part of the curriculum. Today, there is a widespread and very dynamic discussion in many lands about changing, extending, and improving the mathematics courses taught in schools at all levels, in order to combat a perceived mathematical illiteracy. See, for example, the Tory government’s call for maths to eighteen for school kids in the UK. One prominent argument in these discussions is for the reduction or removal of much of the tradition diet of algebra, geometry, and calculus and replacing it with a much-expanded emphasis on probability and statistics because these are the areas of mathematics that people need to understand and even use in everyday life.\n\nIt is in fact true that we stumble across probability theory and statistics on a daily basis in the media, on the news, in advertising etc. often misused and mostly misunderstood by the people reading it. Probability turns up in the weather forecast, there’s a X% chance of rain, in sport betting, which has become a vast industry, in other forms of gambling, but also in areas of science and medicine. What is the probability of blah, blah blah… Here the quoted probabilities are derived from statistical analysis. Today, it is perfectly normal for all aspects of human existence to be analysed statistically. From trivial things like what percentage of the population is left-handed, to serious topics such as what is the probability of someone developing a particular type of cancer. We have statical analyses of opinion polls, election results, school exam results and …\n\nWe are so inundated with statistical information, oft presented as a probability, that we simple accept it without really thinking about it. However, where do these two areas of mathematics come from, when were they developed and why? Although there are earlier simple examples of the calculation of probabilities, both probability theory and statistics first emerged in the Early Modern Period. Not surprisingly, probability theory first emerged in the calculation of odds in gambling. The first major work on probability theory was written by one of my favourite Renaissance polymaths, Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), who was a passionate, and at time professional, gambler. His book, Liber de ludo aleae (Book on Games of Chance), written in the 1560s but first published in 1663, also includes advice on how to cheat. In their correspondence in 1654, Pierre Fermat (1607–1655) and Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) discussed various aspects of probability theory after being asked how the pot should be divided in an interrupted game. Christiaan Huygens (1629­–1695) came across this correspondence in Paris and wrote the most coherent and at that time, most advanced book on probability theory his De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae (On reasoning in games of chance). Originally written in Dutch, it was translated into Latin and published by Frans van Schooten Jr. in 1657. The mathematics of probability was firmly established in the early eighteenth century by Jacob Bernoulli (1655–1705) with his posthumously published Ars Conjectandi (The Art of Conjecturing) in 1713, which covers combinatorics and probability, and Abraham De Moivre (1667–1754) with his The doctrine of chances: or, a method for calculating the probabilities of events in play in 1718 with an expanded second edition in 1738, and a further expanded edition published posthumously in 1756.\n\nStatistics, however, developed from the start through a desire to count people, a development that had a long and complex prehistory before it began to become formalised on a very simple level in the second half of the seventeenth century. That formalisation took place in the work of John Graunt (1620–1674), Edmond Halley (1656–1741), John Arbuthnot (1667–1735), Gregory King (1648–1712), Charles Davenant (1656–1714), and William Petty (1623–1687), who gave the counting of people the early name of Political Arithmetick.\n\nToday, we use the term demography derived from the Ancient Greek demos meaning people, society and graphía meaning writing, drawing, description, and meaning the statistical study of populations. The American historian Ted McCormick, who teaches at Univesité Concordia in Montreal earlier wrote William Petty and the Ambitions of Political Arithmetic (OUP, 2009), using the manuscripts of Sir William Petty (1623-1687) to show how a mixture of alchemical and natural-philosophical ideas were brought bear governing colonial populations in Ireland and the Atlantic, as well as confessional and labouring populations in Britain (taken from his university webpage), which I haven’t read but I’ve now added to the infinite reading list. He has now followed up with Human Empire: Mobility and Demographic Thought in the British Atlantic World, 1500–1800,[1] which details the gradual development of demography in Britain, Ireland and the American Colonies in the Early Modern Period.\n\nBefore I write more about McCormick’s book in any detail, a couple of important notes about it. Although this book relates the historical developments over a couple of centuries that led to the first low level uses of statistics by the scholars I named above, it is in no way whatsoever a history of mathematics text. In fact, actual numbers are strikingly absent from McCormick’s narrative. Rather it examines the social, political, environmental, cultural, philosophical, and economic circumstances that led authorities and individual to consider it necessary to enumerate elements of the population. Secondly, having said this, it should be fairly obvious from my general description that this is also in no way a popular book, but rather a deeply and intensively researched academic book.\n\nThe word demography was first coined in the nineteenth century, but societies have been indulging in demographic thought at least since the emergence of the earliest civilisations. McCormick’s book might well be regarded as an extended case study into the structure and content of such thought in Britain and its colonies over four centuries. McCormick himself illustrates the ancient origins of the discipline, in his introduction, with references to the Bible. He also touched briefly on Aristotle’s thoughts on the topic, as these were of course relevant to those engaged in debates in the Early Modern and Modern periods. He writes the following:\n\nAristotle thus presented population not just as a measurable number of inhabitants but also, more saliently, as the living material of the city-state. Its size would be constrained by the territory that it occupied. It should be limited, too, by the counterpoised imperatives of magnitude and order in the context of polity conceived as an organic unit – a body politic – with a constitution. More significant than absolute size was the relative proportions of the body’s parts: The balance between citizens, slaves and foreigners, [my emphasis]and between soldiers, husbandmen and artisans (page, 29).\n\nReading these lines and in particular the clause I have emphasised I was instantly reminded of current political and cultural debates that are currently raging in many countries about exactly that balance, (ignoring the slaves of course) or as many see the lack of what they see as the correct balance–too many foreigners, migrants, asylum seekers… take your pick. This was the first time that such parallels between the historical debates that McCormick outlines in great detail and the actual political debates of our times, but it was by no means the last time. Again and again, I found myself thinking this is all too familiar. My feelings were confirmed when in the closing pages of his book McCormick remarked:\n\nTo put it another way: what might the early modern history of demographic governance tell us about the persistence or reemergence of concerns about the mobility, mixture and mutability of populations in the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first centuries) Instances of such concerns are not only numerous but also fundamental to received interpretations of modern history (page 249)\n\nThe main text of the book covers four phases or periods of debate about perceived demographic topics. The first concerning the fifteenth century reminded me of my days as a field archaeologist. I spent several seasons, both Easter and summer, working on the major excavation of a deserted medieval village, or DMV, in the north of England. DMVs, shrunken medieval villages, SMVs and expanded medieval villages, otherwise known as towns, are the result of a major shift in population distribution during the High Middle Ages largely brought about by the enclosures. That is turning agricultural land, which peasants farmed to make a subsistence living, into pasture for sheep grazing, thereby forcing the ploughmen to abandon their villages and try to seek employment elsewhere.\n\nThe socio-political debate that McCormick covers, about this depopulation, concerns the reformers, who wished to restore the honest ploughman to his rightful place in society. At this time the talk, however, is not of populations, but of the much more imprecise multitudes. In the second section of the book, we still have to do with multitudes but here, in the Elizabethan era, it is not a debate about a positive part of the body politic, the humble ploughman, but concerns about negative sections of that body, vagrants and the poor. Once again, the main participants in the public debate are reformers offering and discussing potential solutions what they see as the proliferation of undesirable elements in society.\n\nThis second phase moves out of England into Ireland where the English had problems with various aspects of various parts of the island’s population.\n\nIn these sections and also in the ones to follow, McCormick outlines the perceived problems with selected parts of the population, the multitudes, and then presents the solutions proposed by the various reformers. He lets the participants in the various debates present their polemic themselves, in lengthy direct quotes all delivered up in the original English of the period, with its own vocabulary, orthography, and grammar. I must admit that I found it difficult reading some of these passages that appeared almost to be in a foreign language and not the English with which I grew up. However, it pays to persevere because it gives a much clearer picture of what the participants were aiming for than a simple modern English paraphrase.\n\nIn the third section McCormick brings the political philosophers into play and the discussions on over population. Here we see the emergence of colonialism as a potential solution, as to what to do with surplus multitudes. Already practiced with little success in Ireland, we see the beginnings of the establishment of colonies in North America. The seventeenth century sees the move in the discussion from the multitudes of the earlier reformers to the perception of population and the slow move towards encapsulation through mathematics in the form of statistics driven by the writings of such as Francis Bacon and the Hartlib Circle, a precursor to the Royal Society. The latter offering up various projects for empire, colonialism, and population.\n\nEnter William Petty. Petty, an associate of the Hartlib Circle and a founding member of the Royal Society, no longer simply delivered polemics on population and population reform but in his survey of Ireland, on behalf of Cromwell, to organise the distribution of land to Cromwell’s soldiers, as payment for their services and also to dilute the troublesome Irish population, Petty was instrumental in putting a plan into action. McCormick covers Petty’s survey and its background in great detail. Out of his work in Ireland he developed his economic theories, marking him as a pioneer in economic science, and also his Political Arithmetick. It’s worth quoting McCormick here on Petty’s innovation:\n\n“Political arithmetic” was coined sometime around 1670. It has appeared ever since as the invention of a new, scientific and, above all, quantitative age. Its inventor, Petty, has often seemed precocious in his focus on “number, weight and measure,” his imaginative exploitation of demographic and economic figures running well ahead of the empirical data at his disposal over a century before the census. While John Graunt’s “shop arithmetique” revealed a world of relationships hidden in the rows and columns of London’s weekly bills of mortality and in the patchy parish registers of baptisms, marriages and burials, Petty promised nothing less than a new “Instrument of Government” for the Stuart kingdoms and the growing colonial empire, predicted on the collection and analysis of vast amounts of information. Most of this was numerical.\n\nThis introduction is followed by an in-depth analysis of what exactly Petty’s innovative creation was, what it meant and how it influenced future developments.\n\nThe final section of McCormick’s main narrative follows how the rhetoric about population and demography evolved throughout the eighteenth century both in Britain and in its colonies in America. In Britain the reformist mode of thought is still dominant. In America the problem of increasing the colonial population to take over the land is predominant with Benjamin Franklin taking a lead in the debate. On the one side his acknowledgement that the land was occupied by Indians when the settlers first arrived but, on the other, that it would only be settled when the colonial population had grown enough shows a level of casual racism that I found deeply disturbing. There is also an extreme and dismissive level of racism shown by Franklin and others towards the negro slave population.\n\nMcCormick closes his stimulating and fascinating narrative in the conclusion to his book with a discussion of Thomas Malthus’ 1798 Essay on the Principle of Population, a work that famous influenced by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in the formulation of their theories of evolution by natural selection. Darwin and Wallace do not put in an appearance here as McCormick is concerned with Malthus’ influence on the development of demography, which he presents as revolutionary:\n\nFrom the perspective of the Henrician humanists, Elizabethan pamphleteers, Jacobian colonial promotors, Interregnum projectors, Restoration political arithmeticians and Enlightenment-era physicians, philanthropists and philosophers who have populated this book, T. R. Malthus’s 1798 Essay on the Principle of Populationappears scarcely less than the French Revolution, to mark the end of an age.\n\nCarrying on, McCormick runs revue over the polemics, reforms, schemes. and projects that he has described in the previous chapters and concludes:\n\nInto this baroque edifice slammed the wrecking ball of Malthusian principle.\n\nHe then follows up with an analysis of that Malthusian wrecking ball. McCormick’s book closes with some very open and honest general thoughts on the limitations of his own research.\n\nFans of footnotes will love McCormick, the book has literally tons of them listing vast amounts of sources, that are included in a twenty-two-page bibliography, the whole closing out with an excellent index. This book does not have illustrations.\n\nThis is not an easy read. It is a book packed with intensive historical information and evidence with an equally intensive analysis. However, if you have any interest in the topics covered this is a must read.\n\nHaving started out with my personal relationship to probability theory and a very brief sketch of its early history, when the philosopher of science Ian Hacking died whilst I was writing this, I immediately got his excellent The Emergence of Probability: A Philosophical Study of Early Ideas about Probability, Induction and Statistical inference (CUP, 1975), a title that can be found in McCormick’s extensive bibliography, out of the university library. A book that I first consulted more than thirty years hence and is now my current bed time reading.\n\n[1] Ted McCormick, Human Empire: Mobility and Demographic Thought in the British Atlantic World, 1500–1800, CUP, Cambridge, 2022\n\nThis is the second in a series of discussion of selected parts of Paul Strathern’s The Other Renaissance: From Copernicus to Shakespeare, (Atlantic Books, 2023). For more general details on both the author and his book see the first post in this series.\n\nToday, I turn my attention to his chapter on the fifteenth century, German philosopher and theologian, Nicholas of Cusa, a large part of which is, as we shall see, actually devoted to another fifteenth century German scholar. Right in his opening paragraph to this chapter, Strathern lets a historical bomb of major dimensions explode, he writes:\n\nAs the world of art in northern Europe began its drastic transformation, shedding the stylistic formalism and religious subject- matter of medieval art, so the northern intellectual world underwent a similar revolution. The origins of the humanistic way of thought and its empirical attitude to learning were not the sole preserve of the Italian Renaissance. Indeed, the ‘father of humanism’ is generally recognized as a German, born in 1401 in the Electorate of Trier: Nicholas of Cusa [my emphasis].\n\nRegular readers will already know that here at the Renaissance Mathematicus we react extremely allergically to the phrase ‘father of anything’, but to title Nicholas of Cusa ‘father of humanism’ is really breath takingly stupid, further to also claim that this is ‘generally recognised’ pushes the claim into the mindboggling. As I explained in the fourth part of my series on Renaissance science, Renaissance Humanism, which originated in Northern Italy, did so almost a century before Nicholas of Cusa was born, so if he was, as Strathern claims, the ‘father of humanism’ then his birth in 1401 must have been a reincarnation.\n\nStrathern writes that Nicholas was “the son of ‘a prosperous boatman and ferryman’.” A boatman is, according to the dictionary, “a man who takes people or goods somewhere in a small boat, or who has small boats that you can rent for a period of time.” The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy says his father was “a prosperous merchant who became one of the landed gentry in Trier” and German Wikipedia say he was “als Schiffer ein wohlhabender Kaufmann,” that is, “as shipper a wealthy merchant”. Once again according to the dictionary “a shipper is a company that arranges for goods to be taken somewhere by ship.” There appears to be a major disparity concerning the real profession of the father and Strathern’s version.\n\nNicholas was a precocious student. In his early teens he entered the University of Heidelberg, the oldest in Germany, which had been established in the middle of the previous century. Here he studied law, before transferring to the University of Padua near Venice. He graduated in 1423, but instead of becoming a lawyer he took up minor holy orders.\n\nEarly teens was a perfectly normal age to enter university in the fifteenth century, so not necessarily precocious. Strathern seems not to be aware that law was divided into civil law and canon law, that is church law, at medieval universities and Nicholas obtained a doctorate in canon law in Padua in 1423, so it was perfectly normal for him to take minor holy orders on graduating.\n\nFrom the outset, Nicholas was an imaginative polymath, his mind fecund with novel ideas on all manner of subjects. Under normal circumstances such ideas would have been controversial, and might even have put his life in mortal danger (almost 150 years later, the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno would be burned at the stake for expressing similar ideas). However, it seems that the sheer brilliance of Nicholas of Cusa’s mind won him friends in high places.\n\nHere we have an oblique reference to Nicholas’ cosmological speculation, which did include, like Bruno, the idea that the stars were other suns and there might be other inhabited planets orbiting around them; speculations also shared by Nicole Oresme in the previous century. However, unlike Bruno, Nicholas did not travel around Europe pissing off everybody who was anybody, and also did not deny the divinity of Christ or the Virgin Birth, so his life was never in danger, because of his cosmological speculations.\n\nIn 1450 Nicholas completed a work in the form of dialogues between a layman and a priest. This was entitled Idiota de Mente (literally translated as ‘An Idiot Speaks His Mind’). Surprisingly, it is the ‘idiot’ who puts forward Nicholas’s bold proposals, which contrast sharply with the orthodox Aristotelian views proposed by the priest. It should be borne in mind that during this period Aristotle was regarded as the highest authority on intellectual matters: his word was seen as little less than Holy Writ.\n\nIn medieval Latin Idiota means layman so the title actually translates as A Layman Speaks his Mind. Strathern actually says this in a footnote, so I really don’t understand his next sentence. It is time for my favourite Edward Grant saying, medieval “Aristotelian philosophy is not Aristotle’s philosophy” and in fact it was constantly changing and evolving. Scholars were constantly discussing, criticising, and modifying Aristotle’s thoughts throughout the Middle Ages, so no, it was not Holy Writ.\n\nNext up we have a rather thin presentation of Nicholas’ theological philosophy and his use therein of mathematics and measurement, which is not particular accurate, but I can’t be bothered to unravel it. However, Strathern makes the following claim:\n\nDespite the abstract flavour of Nicholas’s mathematical pronouncements, his motives were entirely practical. Delineating discrete parts of the world by measurement was what led to knowledge, which was essentially a practical matter. Such thoughts opened the way to an entirely different method of learning.\n\nHe then states, “In order to understand the magnitude of Nicholas’s mode of thought it is necessary for the moment to take the wider view,” and proceeds to give a very thin and not very accurate account of the supposed decline of China. Re-enter Nicholas:\n\nIronically, it was the very opposite to the process which was taking place in Europe. And it was Nicholas of Cusa who was giving voice to this new direction. Mathematical measurement should be applied to the world. Architecture, commerce, shipbuilding, the very nature of tools and machines – all would undergo major developments during the Renaissance era as a result of this new attitude towards the practical world.\n\nI wrote a whole series of blog posts about those developments in practical knowledge in the Renaissance and the theological-philosophical ramblings of Nicholas of Cusa did not in any way play a significant role in them.\n\nAs examples of Nicholas’ practical applications of mathematics and measurement he gives the following from his attempts to square the circle (of which more later):\n\nHowever, in the course of his attempts by pure geometry to solve this problem he managed to calculate the value of π as 3.1423, a figure of greater accuracy than any before – including that calculated by Archimedes, who in fact only worked out its limits of between 223/71 and 22/7 (3.14084 and 3.14285).\n\nI love the “only” by Archimedes’ process of calculating Pi. It is one of the puzzles of the history of maths, as to why Archimedes stopped where he did and didn’t carry out the next iteration(s)of his calculation, which would, naturally, have given him value for Pi much more accurate than that of Nicholas. Some have suggested that there was a second, now missing, book where he completed his calculations.\n\nIn fact, Nicholas’ value is no more accurate than the value used by Ptolemaeus in the second century CE and less accurate than the value calculated by the Indian mathematician Āryabhaṭīya in the sixth century. Closer to Nicholas’s time in the fourteenth century the Indian mathematician Mādhava of Sangamagrāma calculated a value for Pi accurate to eleven decimal places and in 1425, the Persian mathematician Jamshīd al-Kāshī calculated Pi accurate to sixteen decimal places.\n\nNext up we have Nicholas as calendar reformer:\n\nNicholas also argued that there was a need to calculate a new calendar, as the seasons were gradually falling out of synchronization with the dates and the months (it would be almost 150 years before his suggestion was taken up by Pope Gregory XIII).\n\nThe recognition of the need to reform the Julian calendar, to bring it back into line with the solar year, goes back at least to the Venerable Bede in the eighth century CE. Notable mathematicians, who made reform suggestions earlier that Nicholas, include Johannes de Sacrobosco (c. 1195–c. 1256), Roger Bacon (c. 12220–c. 1290) and Johannes de Muris (c. 1290–1344). When Gregory XII finally put that reform into practice, he was not taking up the suggestion of Nicholas of Cusa.\n\nStrathern’s next claim completely blew my mind and sent me down a major rabbit hole:\n\nPerhaps Nicholas’s most important invention was a new type of spectacle lens. Previously, lenses had been ground to a convex shape. This was an easier process, and it enabled the viewer to achieve long-sightedness. Nicholas tried the opposite method, grinding a lens into a concave shape, and found that it enabled the viewer to achieve near-sightedness. This brought about a revolution. Old men with failing sight could continue reading, learning, making suggestions, discoveries, inventions. It is little exaggeration to say that intellectual life almost doubled over the coming century as a result of Cusa’s innovation.\n\nNow, the history of optics, including the history of spectacles, has been a special area of interest of mine for at least thirty years and I have a rather large literature collection on the subject, as a result, but I have never ever come across the claim that Nicholas of Cusa invented the concave spectacle lens, indeed a major development in the history of optics. I was, as I said above, mind blown. I first of all googled Cusanus and spectacles and to my amazement came up with hundreds or even thousands of websites making exactly this claim that Nicholas of Cuse invented the concave spectacle lens in 1450/1. Mostly there was just one simple sentence with no explanation, no source, no history, nothing! Still not convinced I dug deeper and consulted Vincent Ilardi an expert on the history of spectacles and found the answer to this conundrum.\n\nMore certain in this respect, on the other hand, is the often-cited quotation from Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa’s De beryllo (On the Beryl) as the first mention of concave lenses for the correction of myopia. In this treatise, written over a five-year period and completed in in 1485, Nicholas treated the beryl metaphorically but also as a practical magnifying device:\n\nThe beryl is a clear, bright, and transparent stone, to which is given a concave as well as a convex form, and by looking through it, one attains what was previously invisible. If the intellectual beryl, which possesses both the maximum and the minimum in the same way, is adapted to the intellectual eyes, the indivisible principle of all things is attained.\n\nShorn of its convolution, for which Nicholas had a special aptitude, this passage seems to indicate that the beryl used in its concave shape aided distant vision (“the maximum”) whereas the convex shaped one brought short distance images into focus (“the minimum”). And in another passage from his Compendium, completed in 1463, he again cited beryl as lenses to aid vision in a celebration of human creativeness and inventiveness to remedy the deficiencies of nature and master the environment at a level for superior than the capabilities of the animals.\n\n[…]\n\nFor man alone discovers how to supplement weakness of light with a burning candle, so that he can see, how to aid deficient vision with lenses [berylli], and how to correct errors concerning vision with the perspectival art.\n\n[…]\n\nThe above quotations seem to indicate that Nicholas was familiar with spectacles fitted both with concave and convex lenses just a few years before we have unequivocal proof of the former’s availability in quantity.[1]\n\nIt is very clear that Nicholas is in no way claiming to have invented the concave spectacle lens, but is merely describing the fact that they exist. It would be an interesting exercise to try and discover who first misinterpreted this passage in this way. As an interesting side note, the use of beryl to make lenses, because of the poor quality of the available glass, led to the fact that spectacles are called Brillen in German. Of course, as Ilardi says, concave lenses aided distant vision and did not as Starter writes enable, old men with failing sight to continue reading, that task had already been covered by the convex spectacle lens. Personally, I think that a historian when confronted by this claim should weigh up the probability that a cardinal and high-ranking Church diplomat ground lenses in his spare time, possible but highly improbable.\n\nA further revolution was instigated when Nicholas turned his attention to a study of the heavens. Despite the fact that the telescope had yet to be invented, his observations enabled him to reach some highly original conclusions. While several of the Ancient Greeks had speculated on such matters, drawing their own similar conclusions, Nicholas was perhaps the first to put these together into a truly universal structure.\n\nNicholas’ thoughts on cosmology were based on speculation not observations and although interesting had almost no impact on the actual astronomy/cosmology debate in the Renaissance. He was also by no means “the first to put these together into a truly universal structure.”\n\nHowever, none of this accounts for the sheer originality of his thinking. Besides the subjects already mentioned, Nicholas made original contributions in fields ranging from biology to medicine. By applying his belief in rigorous measurement to the field of medicine, he would introduce the practice of taking precise pulse rates to use as an indication of a patient’s health. Previously, physicians had been in the habit of taking a patient’s pulse and using their own estimation of its rate to infer the state of their health. Nicholas of Cusa introduced an exact method, weighing the quantity of water which had run from a water clock during one hundred pulse beats.\n\nAs far as I can see, measuring the pulse using a water clock is the only original contributions in fields ranging from biology to medicine that he made. How original it was is debateable:\n\nPulse rate was first measured by ancient Greek physicians and scientists. The first person to measure the heartbeat was Herophilos of Alexandria, Egypt (c. 335–280 BC) who designed a water clock to time the pulse. (Wikipedia)\n\nIn the middle of a lot of stuff about Nicholas’ role as a Church diplomat we get:\n\nNicholas’s scientific work would go on to influence thinkers of the calibre of the German philosopher-mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, a leading philosopher of the Enlightenment who lived two centuries later.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Nicholas of Cusa is regarded as one of the great Renaissance thinkers and although he was very widely read, his influence on others was actually minimal. Whether or not he influenced Leibniz is actually an open question.\n\nFor whatever reason, Strathern now turns to a completely different Renaissance thinker:\n\nThe work and thought of Nicholas of Cusa is indicative of the wide-ranging re-examination of the human condition which was beginning to take place, especially amongst thinkers of the northern Renaissance. Another leading German scientific thinker from this period, who would become a friend of Nicholas of Cusa, was Regiomontanus, who was born Johannes Müller in rural Bavaria, southern Germany, in 1436.\n\nWe get a long spiel about scholars adopting Latin names during the Renaissance and the use of Latin in general during the medieval period, but nowhere does he mention that Johannes Müller never actually used the name Regiomontanus, which was first coined by Philip Melanchthon in 1535, that is almost seventy years after his death.\n\n“[Regiomontanus] would become a friend of Nicholas of Cusa”, really‽ I can find no references whatsoever to this ‘friendship’. There is no correspondence between the two of them, no record of their having ever met. Although, a meeting would have been possible as Regiomontanus lived and worked in Italy during the last three years of Nicholas’ life (1461–64), and even lived in Rome, where Nicholas was living, for some of this time.\n\nRegiomontanus’ view of Nicholas of Cusa can best be taken from his analysis of Nicholas’s attempts to square the circle. Nicholas wrote four texts on the topic–De circuli quadratura , 1450, Quadratura circuli 1450, Dialogus de circuli quadratura 1457 and De caesarea circuli quadratura , 1457–all of which he sent to Georg von Peuerbach in Vienna. Regiomontanus wrote a series of notes analysing these texts during his time in Vienna and his conclusion was far from flattering, “Cusanus makes a laughable figure as a geometer; he has, through vanity, increased the claptrap in the world.” Regiomontanus’ very negative analysis of Nicholas of Cusa geometry was first published by Johannes Schöner as an appendix to Regiomontanus’ De triangulis omnimodis in 1533.\n\nNicholas of Cusa was a good friend of Regiomontanus’ teacher Georg von Peuerbach (1423–1461). Georg von Peuerbach travelled through Italy between graduating BA in 1448 and when he returned to Vienna to graduate MA in 1443. In Italy he became acquainted with the astronomers Giovanni Bianchini (1410–after 1469), Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli (1397–1482), and Nicholas of Cusa. In fact, he lived with Nicholas in his apartment in Rome for a time. Later Georg von Peuerbach and Nicholas corresponded with each other. During his travels in Italy Regiomontanus met Toscanelli and Bianchini and also corresponded with both of them but for Nicholas we have no record of any personal contact whatsoever. As we have seen Regiomontanus heavily criticised Nicholas’ mathematics, but this only became public long after both of them were dead.\n\nStrathern tells us:\n\nRegiomontanus was sent to the University of Leipzig in 1437 [my emphasis], at the age of eleven. Five years later he was studying at the University of Vienna, where he took a master’s degree and began lecturing in optics and classical literature at the age of twenty-one.\n\nNote there is here no mention of Georg von Peuerbach, in fact, in the whole section about Regiomontanus Georg von Peuerbach gets no mention whatsoever. This is quite incredible! Writing about Regiomontanus without mentioning Georg von Peuerbach is like writing about Robin the Boy Wonder without mentioning Batman! Peuerbach was Regiomontanus’ principal and most influential teacher in Vienna and after Regiomontanus graduated MA, the worked closely together as a team, reforming, and modernising astronomy up till Peuerbach’s death in 1461. Their joint endeavours played a massive role in the history of European astronomy.\n\nBut be warned gentle readers there is far worse to come. If we go and search for the good Georg von Peuerbach, reported missing here, we find the following horror in the chapter on Copernicus:\n\nHe had also read the work of the Austrian Georg von Peuerbach, who had lived during the earlier years of the century (1423–61). Peuerbach had been taught by Regiomontanus [my emphasis] and had collaborated with him, using instruments which he invented to measure the passage of the stars in the heavens.\n\nI don’t know whether to laugh or cry or simply to don rubber gloves, pick up the offending tome, and dump it in the garbage disposal.\n\nYou might also note that in 1437, Regiomontanus was one year old not eleven!\n\nWhile Regiomontanus was teaching at the University of Vienna, the city was visited by the Greek scholar Bessarion, who would play a significant role in Regiomontanus’s subsequent career. As such, it is worth examining Bessarion’s unusual background.\n\nThis is followed by a reasonable brief synopsis of Bessarion’s life prior to his visit to Vienna but no explanation of why he was there or what he did respective Peuerbach and Regiomontanus whilst he was there. This is important in order to understand future developments. Bessarion came to Vienna in 1460 as papal legate to negotiate with the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III. He also sought out Georg von Peuerbach, who was acknowledged as one of the leading astronomer/mathematicians in Europe, for a special commission. Earlier Bessarion had commissioned another Greek scholar, Georg of Trebizond (1395–1472) to produce a new translation Ptolemy’s Mathēmatikē Syntaxis or as it is better known the Almagest from the original Greek into Latin, providing him with a Greek manuscript. Georg of Trebizond made a mess of the translation and Bessarion asked Georg von Peuerbach to do a new translation. Georg von Peuerbach couldn’t read Greek, but he knew the Almagest inside out and offered instead to produce an improved, modernised Epitome of it instead. Bessarion accepted the offer and Georg von Peuerbach set to work. Bessarion then asked Georg von Peuerbach if he would become part of his familia (household) and accompany him back to Italy. Georg von Peuerbach agreed on the condition that Regiomontanus could accompany them; Bessarion accepted the condition. Unfortunately, Georg von Peuerbach, only having completed six of the thirteen books of the Almagest, died in 1461, so it was only Regiomontanus, who accompanied Bessarion back to Italy as a member of his familia. A more detailed version is here.\n\nBack to Strathern:\n\nUnder Bessarion’s guidance, many works of Ancient Greece – of which western Europe was ignorant – were translated into Latin. And it was in this way that Regiomontanus learned sufficient Greek for him to be accepted as a member of Bessarion’s entourage while he travelled through Italy.\n\nMost of those works were actually already known in Europe, either through poor quality translations from the Greek or translation from Arabic. This was not how Regiomontanus learnt Greek. He was part of Bessarion’s familia and Bessarion taught him Greek during their travels.\n\nDuring these years, Regiomontanus would complete a new translation of the second-century Greek Almagest by Ptolemy.\n\nRegiomontanus didn’t complete a translation of Ptolemaeus’ Almagest, he completed Georg von Peuerbach’s Epitome of the Almagest (Epytoma in almagesti Ptolemei), fulfilling a death bed promise to Georg von Peuerbach to do so. To quote Michael H Shank\n\nThe Epitome is neither a translation (an oft repeated error) nor a commentary but a detailed sometimes updated, overview of the Almagest. Swerdlow once called it “the finest textbook of Ptolemaic astronomy ever written.\n\nStrathern continues:\n\nThis is the work in which Ptolemy describes the movements of the sun, the moon, the planets and the stars around the earth, which was deemed to be the centre of the universe. For many centuries, such geocentric teaching had been accepted by the early Christians as Holy Writ, and as such its authority lay beyond question.\n\nStrathern is perpetuating a popular myth. Geocentric cosmology and the Ptolemaic version of it were very often questioned and subjected to criticism throughout the medieval period, both by Islamic and European astronomers and philosophers, as I have documented in numerous blog posts. In fact, Copernicus’ heliocentric model appeared during an intense period of criticism of the accepted astronomy, which began around 1400. Strathern himself in this chapter details Nicholas of Cusa’s unorthodox cosmological speculations!\n\nStrathern now delivers the standard speculation that Regiomontanus was moving towards a heliocentric view of the cosmos based on an over interpretation of a couple of quotes but then tells us:\n\nSome suspect that Regiomontanus must surely have thought through the obvious implications of these remarks, i.e. that the earth moves around the sun. But there is no evidence for this. On the contrary, despite his suspicions as to the accuracy of Ptolemy’s universe, Regiomontanus seems to have continued to use geocentric astronomical mathematics, as well as accepting the authority of Aristotle’s pronouncement that ‘comets were dry exhalations of Earth that caught fire high in the atmosphere or similar exhalations of the planets and stars’. This reliance on ‘authority’ was certainly the case when he made observations of the comet which remained visible for two months during early 1472. He calculated this comet’s distance from the earth as 8,200 miles, and its coma (the diameter at its head) as 81 miles. According to the contemporary astronomer David A. J. Seargent: ‘These values, of course, fail by orders of magnitude, but he is to be commended for this attempt at determining the physical dimensions of the comet.’*\n\nIn the footnote indicated by the *. Strathern writes:\n\n* This comet is visible on earth at intervals ranging from seventy-four to seventy-nine years. Its first certain observation was recorded in a Chinese chronicle dating from 240 bc. When it was observed by the English astronomer Edmond Halley in 1705 it was named after him. The justification for this is that Halley was the first to realize that it was the same comet as had appeared at 74–79-year intervals since time immemorial. Even so, Regiomontanus deserves more than a little credit for his observation of the comet, for in the words of the twentieth-century American science writer Isaac Asimov: ‘This was the first time that comets were made the object of scientific study, instead of serving mainly to stir up superstitious terror.’\n\nThere is quite a lot to unpack in these two paragraphs, but we can start with the very simple fact that the Great Comet of 1472 was not Comet Halley! The most important point of Regiomontanus’ comet observations is that he tried to determine its distance from the Earth using parallax, this was an important development in the history of astronomy despite his highly inaccurate results. He wrote a book De Cometae, outlining how to determine the parallax of a moving object that was published in Nürnberg in 1531 and played an important role in the attempts to determine the nature of comets in the sixteenth century.\n\nRegiomontanus was not the first to make comets “the object of scientific study” that honour goes to Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, who began treating comets as celestial objects and trying to track their path through the heavens beginning with the comet of 1433, and continuing with the comets of 1449-50, Halley’s comet of 1456, the comet of May, 1457, of June-July-August, 1457, and that of 1472. He did not publish his observations, but he almost certainly showed them to Georg von Peuerbach when they met. Georg von Peuerbach went back to Vienna in thee 1440s he applied Toscanelli’s methods of comet observation to Comet Halley in 1456 together with his then twenty-year-old student Regiomontanus, as did Toscanelli in Italy.\n\nFollowing on to the comet disaster Strathern writes:\n\nHowever, Regiomontanus would make two contributions of lasting importance. In his work on rules and methods applicable to arithmetic and algebra, Algorithmus Demonstratus, he reintroduced the symbolic algebraic notation used by the third-century Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria. He also added certain improvements of his own. Basically, this is the algebra we use today, where unknown quantities are manipulated in symbolic form, such as ax + by = c. Here x and y are variable unknowns, and a, b, and c are constants.\n\nMy first reaction was basically, “Yer wot!” I am, for my sins, supposed to be something of a Regiomontanus expert and I have never heard of a book titled Algorithmus Demonstratus and I know for a fact that Regiomontanus did not introduce or reintroduce symbolic algebra, so it was rabbit hole time again.\n\nDuring his travels in Italy and Hungary, Regiomontanus collected a large number of mathematical, astrological, and astronomical manuscripts, a number of which he intended to print and publish when he settled down in Nürnberg; of which more later. Unfortunately, he died before he could print more than a handful and it turns out that the Algorithmus Demonstratus was one of those manuscripts, which was then edited by Johannes Schöner and published by Johannes Petreius in Nürnberg in 1535. Although it has been falsely attributed to both Regiomontanus, and to the thirteenth century mathematician Jordanus de Nemore, it is not actually known who the author was. Although it has some very primitive attempts to introduce letters for numbers It is in no way an (re)introduction of symbolic algebra as you can judge for yourself here.\n\nAs Frank J. Swetz, an expert for Early Modern arithmetic, writes on the MAA website:\n\nOn page 10 of the Algorithmus, we find crude attempts to employ symbolic notation. For example, the third paragraph down notes that digit a multiplied by digit b will result in articulum c. An example is given in the margin: 5 x 4 = 20; also articulum a times articulum b gives [the product n, 50 x 40 = 2000].\n\nIt is obvious that Strathern literally doesn’t know what he’s talking about and has never even bothered to take a look at the book he is describing.\n\nThe garbage continues:\n\nRegiomontanus also made considerable advances in trigonometry, although it has since been discovered that at least part of this was plagiarized from the twelfth-century Arab writer Jabir ibn Aflah. On top of this, Regiomontanus drew up books of trigonometric tables: these lists provided ready answers in the calculation of angles and lengths of sides of rig"
