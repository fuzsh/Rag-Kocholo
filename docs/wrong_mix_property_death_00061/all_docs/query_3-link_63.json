        "text": "Back in May 2023, Renaissance Mathematicus friend, Michael Barton, expert for all things Darwinian, drew our attention to a new piece of history of science hot air from the HISTSCI_HULK’s least favourite windbag, Neil deGrasse Tyson. This time it’s a clip from one of his appearances on the podcast of Joe Rogan, a marriage made in heaven; they compete to see who can produce the biggest pile of bullshit in the shortest time. NdGT is this time pontificating about Galileo and the telescope.\n\nA couple of weeks back, another Renaissance Mathematicus friend, David Hop, drew my attention once again to the same Rogan/Tyson interview, this time a longer section in which NdGT extemporises about the space telescope, Hubble, and Antoni Leeuwenhoek before he reaches the section I dissected back in May last year. As to be expected Motor-Mouth-Tyson spews out a non-stop stream of pure drivel, which truly demands the attention of the HIST_SCI HULK:\n\nNdGT: Why do you think the Hubble Telescope…the mirror issues notwithstanding, which were ultimately fixed when, it was first launched…Why was it so successful? Version of the Hubble telescope previously launched by the military, looking down. The model for that telescope had already been conceived and built and was operating. Then we said we want one of those OK but that’s not public that this is going on. The telescope gets designed has the benefit of previous versions of it having been used successfully but looking down. We look up, this the perennial two way street astronomy in the old days and in modern times astrophysics.\n\nOne doesn’t need to be a fucking rocket scientist to recognise that a military spy satellite, looking down, is technically, optically, functionally, conceptionally different to a space telescope, looking up. But is there any truth in Tyson’s stream of verbal garbage? Now neither Hulky nor I are experts on the Hubble Telescope, it wasn’t built in the seventeenth century, but Wikipedia has good articles on the history of Hubble and on the history of military spy satellites too. Tyson could have taken the time to read them before opening his mouth. But what the hell, why ruin a good story with facts? Neil, “who cares about facts”, Tyson obviously didn’t bother.\n\nTo save you having to turn to Wikipedia, a brief synopsis. We start with the military as Motor-Mouth-Tyson thinks they started the ball rolling and NASA jumped on the bus having seen that it works.\n\nThe United States Army Ballistic Missile Agency launched the first American satellite, Explorer I, for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory on January 31, 1958. The information sent back from its radiation detector led to the discovery of the Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts.\n\nWikipedia\n\nNote the date!\n\nThe theoretical idea goes back a bit further:\n\nHerman Potočnik explored the idea of using orbiting spacecraft for detailed peaceful and military observation of the ground in his 1928 book, The Problem of Space Travel. He described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments. The book described geostationary satellites (first put forward by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky) and discussed communication between them and the ground using radio, but fell short of the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays.\n\nWikipedia\n\nNote once again both civil and military!\n\nTurning to space telescopes and Hubble:\n\nIn 1923, Hermann Oberth—considered a father of modern rocketry, along with Robert H. Goddard and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky—published Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen (“The Rocket into Planetary Space”), which mentioned how a telescope could be propelled into Earth orbit by a rocket.\n\nWikipedia\n\nSo not exactly a recent idea!\n\nThe history of the Hubble Space Telescope can be traced to 1946, to astronomer Lyman Spitzer’s paper “Astronomical advantages of an extra-terrestrial observatory.”\n\nWikipedia\n\nNote the date, twelve years before that first military launch of a satellite looking down!\n\nSpitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space telescope. In 1962, a report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences recommended development of a space telescope as part of the space program, and in 1965, Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope.\n\nWikipedia\n\nAlso crucial was the work of Nancy Grace Roman, the “Mother of Hubble”. Well before it became an officialNASA approved, she became the program scientist, setting up the steering committee in charge of making astronomer needs feasible to implement and writing testimony to Congress throughout the 1970s to advocate continued funding of the telescope. Her work as project scientist helped set the standards for NASA’s operation of large scientific projects.\n\nSpace-based astronomy had begun on a very small scale following World War II, as scientists made use of developments that had taken place in rocket technology. The first ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun was obtained in 1946, and NASA launched the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO) to obtain UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray spectra in 1962. An orbiting solar telescope was launched in 1962 by the United Kingdom as part of the Ariel programme, and in 1966 NASA launched the first Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) mission. OAO-1’s battery failed after three days, terminating the mission. It was followed by Orbiting Astronomical Observatory 2(OAO-2), which carried out ultraviolet observations of stars and galaxies from its launch in 1968 until 1972, well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year.\n\nWikipedia\n\nI could go on, but I think that is enough to show that the Hubble Space Telescope was definitively not a case of the civil space programme copying an idea from the military space programme and that Motor-Mouth-Tyson is, as per usual, spreading high grade bovine manure.\n\nNdGT: The invention of the telescope [babble between Tyson and Rogan] Galileo perfects the telescope He learns that the telescope has just been invented in the Netherlands the Dutch were opticians, so they invented the telescope and the microscope within a couple of years of one another This transforms science.\n\nThe Dutch were opticians! So what? So were people all over Europe. Funnily enough the man credited with having invented the telescope, Hans Lipperhey, lived in Middelburg in the Netherlands but was actually a German. The invention of the telescope and/or microscope had nothing to do with nationality.\n\nRogan: Why did they invent the eyeglass the reading glass?\n\nNdGT: The reading glass was earlier than that, but I don’t know when, The real advance was putting two lenses in line with one another. Trivial in modern times but that was a huge conceptual leap and what you would accomplish [sic] and in so doing depending on how you curve them and how you grind the shape of those lenses you would get a microscope or a telescope. And we’re off to the races!\n\nIt you are going to pontificate about the history of optics and the invention of the telescope and the microscope, you really should know when eyeglasses were invented, as one of the central questions, in that history, is why did it take so long from the invention of eyeglasses, around 1260, to the invention of the telescope in 1608? The accepted thesis in answer to this question is contained in Rolf Willach’s magisterial Long Route to the Invention of the Telescope: A Life of Influence and Exile (American Philosophical Society, 2008). Willach argues convincingly that it was not putting two lenses in line with one another that led to the telescope, several people had done that without creating a telescope, but masking or stopping down the lens. The shape or form of a hand ground lens becomes more inaccurate the further one goes from the middle. These inaccuracies in the outer areas of the lens cause a distorted image, no problem in eyeglasses where one looks through the centre of the lens, but a major problem in the attempt to create a telescope. Lipperhey was probably the first to mask or stop down the lens so that only the central, correctly ground, portion of the lens gets used to create the image.\n\nI could write a whole book about Motor-Mouth-Tyson, “depending on how you curve them and how you grind the shape of those lenses you would get a microscope or a telescope.” Let’s just say an explanation it is somewhat wanting in more ways than one.\n\nNdGT: That’s basically the birth of modern science as we think of it and conduct it. Because you say to yourself, my senses I don’t trust them to be the full record of what’s going on in front of me.\n\nThat the telescope and the microscope extended human perception and added new layers of empiricism to the study of nature is beyond discussion but to call it the birth of modern science is typical Motor-Mouth-Tyson hyperbole.\n\nNdGT: You pull out a microscope, oh my gosh, Leeuwenhoek , the microscope guy, he got a drop of pond water, puts it under his microscope, just to think to do this, it’s just water, why do you think that’s something interesting to do? He said, I wonder, he was curious and puts it under and sees little, what he described as animalcules happily aswimming.\n\nRogan: Animalcules!\n\nNdGT: Animalcules, these are like the amoebas and paramecia. So, he writes to…he reports on this to the scientific authorities, and they don’t believe him. They say Van Leeuwenhoek, we think you might have had too much gin before you wrote this letter. Why would anyone believe this that there’s entire creatures, an entire universe of creatures thriving in a drop of pond water. And so, the way science works, one report does not make it true, you need verification. They sent people to the Netherlands to verify his results and there it was the birth of microscopy and then they look at everything. Cells you know, they need vocabulary to describe what you are seeing.\n\nLeeuwenhoek now gets the Motor-Mouth-Tyson stir some half facts with a portion of liquid bovine manure and splatter the result over the listener treatment. Leeuwenhoek did not put his drop of pond water under his microscope because that is not how his single lens microscopes worked. Wait a minute didn’t our narrator just explain that to make a microscope you need to put two lenses in line with one another? If you are building a compound microscope you do indeed need at least two lenses and often more, but Leeuwenhoek is famous for the fact that he used single lens microscopes of his own special design.\n\nThe small spherical lens is embedded in a metal plate and the specimen to be viewed in placed on the spike behind the lens and the whole apparatus is held up to the light. At the time Leeuwenhoek examined pond water with his microscope, microscopists were examining anything and everything with their microscopes, so nothing very special in this act. “He reports on this to the scientific authorities” sounds like something out of a dystopian novel by Kafka or Orwell. At the time he was corresponding with the Royal Society in London, basically, at the time, a private gentleman’s club for those interested in natural philosophy, who were publishing the results of Leeuwenhoek’s microscopic investigation in the Philosophical Transactions.\n\nThe letter with the animalcules, a term coined by Henry Oldenburg Secretary of the Royal Society, when translating from Leeuwenhoek’ original colloquial Dutch was sent in 1676 and was by no means his first letter.\n\n.. this was for me, among all the marvels that I have discovered in nature, the most marvellous, and I must say that, for me, up to now there has been no greater pleasure in my eye as these sights of so many thousands of living creatures in a small drop of water, moving through each other, each special creature having its special motion.\n\nLeeuwenhoeks animalcules letter to Oldenburg\n\nThe prominent Dutch physician Reinier de Graaf made Oldenburg aware of Leeuwenhoek’s investigations in a letter from 1673:\n\nThat it may be the more evident to you that the humanities and science are not yet banished among us by the clash of arms, I am writing to tell you that a certain most ingenious person here, named Leewenhoek [sic], has devised microscopes which far surpass those which we have hitherto seen, manufactured by Eustacio Divini and others. The enclosed letter from him, wherein he describes certain things which he has observed more accurately than previous authors, will afford you a sample of his work: and if it please you, and you would test the skill of this most diligent man and give him encouragement, then pray send him a letter containing your suggestions, and proposing to him more difficult problems of the same kind.\n\nOldenburg followed de Graaf’s suggestion and from then on the Royal Society regularly published Leeuwenhoek’s letters with his latest investigations until his death in 1723.\n\nMotor-Mouth-Tyson’ comment, “They say Van Leeuwenhoek, we think you might have had too much gin before you wrote this letter” is a piss poor joke and has no place in an account of the history of science. Leeuwenhoek’s discovery of single cell organisms did indeed cause some consternation because the Royal Society’s resident microscopists, Robert Hooke and Nehemiah Grew where initially unable to replicate his observations, their microscopes were not powerful enough. Later Hooke would succeed but in the meantime the Royal Society was justifiably sceptical. The situation was not improved by Leeuwenhoek’s refusal to explain his methods out of fear of being plagiarised.\n\nTyson is quite correct that scientific results have to be verified, usually by replication. Galileo’s telescopic discoveries, which Tyson introduces in the part of the interview that I dissected last time, were also initially met with scepticism, particularly as people were unable to replicate them. Something Tyson doesn’t mention. They were only accepted after the Jesuit astronomers of the Collegio Romano had finally succeed in replicating them.\n\nThe Royal Society did indeed send a delegation to control Leeuwenhoek’s results. This was not in anyway exceptional in the seventeenth century where personal testimony from reliable witnesses was a common form of verification. When the Royal Society doubted the accuracy of Johannes Hevelius’ astronomical observations, because he refused to use telescopic sights on his instruments, they sent Edmond Halley to Danzig to investigate the matter. The measuring of atmospheric pressure using a primitive barometer by Pascal’s brother in law, Florin Périer, was witnessed and confirmed by Minim Fathers from a local friary. Here we have an interesting aspect of personal witness verification, church officials, rather than natural philosophers, were regarded as the most reliable and trustworthy witnesses. The delegation that went to visit Leeuwenhoek to investigate his animalcules’ reports was led by Alexander Petrie, minister to the English Reformed Church in Delft; Benedict Haan, at that time Lutheran minister at Delft; and Henrik Cordes, then Lutheran minister at the Hague. The visit was for Leeuwenhoek a success and his observations were fully acknowledged by the Royal Society.\n\nNdGT: … and there it was the birth of microscopy and then they look at everything. Cells you know, they need vocabulary to describe what you are seeing.\n\nAs I pointed out in an earlier post this was not the birth of microscopy, although Leeuwenhoek took it to a new level. Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694), Jan Swammerdam (1637–1680), Robert Hooke (1635–1703, and Nehemiah Grew (1641–1712) were all prominent microscopist contemporaries of Leuwenhoek, who all started their investigations and also published some of their results before Leeuwenhoek began his investigations. The were also not to first and these scholars, particularly Robert Hooke, had already been looking at everything. Ironically, Motor-Mouth-Tyson’s example “cells” had already been discovered by Hooke. His Micrographia (1665) contains a microscopic image of the cells in cork. Hooke coined the term because he thought they looked like the monk’s cells in monasteries.\n\nNdGT That was the journey down small then the journey went big, and Galileo perfects the telescope…\n\nThis is where the section of the interview that we dissected back in May last year begins. Motor-Mouth-Tyson is slowly becoming the HISTSCI_HULKS favourite punch bag although the man is so dumb, it’s a bit like shooting fish in a barrel. On a serious note, NdGT is wildly successful all over the Internet and almost everything he spews forth, and there’s an awful lot fit, about the history of science is either highly inaccurate or simply false and unfortunately his adoring fans don’t know better. Equally unfortunate is the fact that he simply ignores the criticisms of those who know better.\n\nSpringer is one of the world’s largest academic publishers with a vast catalogue of science and history of science publications. One might think that when Springer publishes a history of science book, for which they charge the princely sum of €246.09, that they would at least employ fact checkers before publishing; one would obviously be wrong!\n\nI was searching the Internet for something else when I stumbled across Neil English’s Chronicling the Golden Age of Astronomy: A History of Visual Observing from Harriot to Moore (Historical & Cultural Astronomy), Springer, (2018), which contains a chapter, The Checkered Career of Simon Marius (pp. 29–­33).\n\nNow readers who have followed me long enough will know that I am an active member of a group of historians of astronomy from the area around Nürnberg, who have spent several years rehabilitating the reputation of Simon Marius (1573­–1625), a local astronomer, astrologer, mathematician, who famously discovered the Moons of Jupiter one day later than Galileo, and whom the latter successfully labelled a plagiarist. We have intensively researched the life and work of Marius and made it publicly available in books and through a website, of which I am the English editor.\n\nAll of this being the case, I was naturally very interested in a publication about Marius that I hadn’t come across before and eagerly read the abstract. My inner HIST_SCI HULK immediately screamed, WHAT THE FUCK! I managed to acquire a pdf of the offending object and passed it on to my friend and colleague the HIST_SCI HULK to review for your delectation:\n\nWe start with that oh so provocative abstract, actually the first paragraph of the essay:\n\nN.E: The phenomenal success of Galileo Galilei with the telescope spread like wildfire across the nation-states of Europe, with the result that nearly every astronomer was keen to get his or her hands on such an instrument to make new discoveries in the starry heavens. One of the earliest “wannabees” was the German astronomer Simon Marius.\n\nAny historian, who had truly researched the history of astronomical telescopic observation would know that Simon Marius was very definitely not one of English’s “wannabees” swimming in the wake of Galileo’s “phenomenal success” but had acquired a telescope and begun astronomical telescopic observation well before Galileo went public with his own observations. There is even the possibility that he, like Thomas Harriot, began observing earlier than Galileo. I don’t really think that English could have made a worse start to his essay, but he continues as he started, badly!\n\nNeil English is obviously only a wannabee historian!\n\nN.E: Born Simon Mayr (later Latinized to Marius) on January 10, 1573, in Gunzenhausen in the region of the Markgrafschaft of Ansbach (Bavaria, south Germany), where his father served as mayor of the city in 1576. From 1586 to 1601, he studied on and off at the Markgrafschaft’s Lutheran academy at Heilsbronn. And it was during his studies here, beginning around 1594, that he became interested in embarking on a career in astronomy and meteorology.\n\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the Markgrafschaft of Ansbach was in Franconia and not Bavaria. Even today it is still in Franconia, which only became part of Bavaria in 1806! Marius was a pupil of the Fürstenschule (its correct name)* in Heilsbronn continuously, not on and off, from 1586 to 1601. Here with his “on and off,” I think, our wannabee historian is just making shit up because there is nothing in the sources to this effect.\n\n*Lutheran academy would imply that the school was educating young men for the Church, whereas the Fürstenschule was educating young men to work on the margravial court.\n\nN.E: In 1596 Marius wrote a tract on the comet that appeared in the sky that year, and in 1599 he published a set of astronomical tables. The quality of his researches resulted in his appointment as court mathematician of the Markgrafschaft of Ansbach in 1601.\n\nThat should, of course, be research and not researches but who am I to copyedit our wannabee historian’s text. Marius was first appointed Court Mathematicus (not mathematician, there’s a difference) in Ansbach in 1606, not in 1601.\n\nN.E: One of his first acts as the Markgrafschaft’s mathematician was to travel to Prague to learn of Tycho Brahe’s observational techniques and to gain familiarity with his instruments. Unfortunately, Brahe died that same year, and Marius’ stay in Prague lasted only 4 months. But he did meet David Fabricius there, who helped consolidate his interest in the science of the heavens.\n\nWhen Marius travelled to Prague he was not yet margravial mathematicus (see above). Although he didn’t meet him, Tycho was still very much alive during his visit and its length had nothing whatsoever to do with Tycho’s death. His interest in the science of the heavens was already consolidated before he went to Prague, which is exactly why he went there.\n\nOur wannabee historian is making a real mess of this.\n\nN.E: After this, he sojourned to Padua to study at the university there, where he quickly became politically active in the student association calling itself the “German Nation,” acting as its chairman from 1604 to 1605.\n\nOur wannabee historian obviously has no idea what a Natio at a medieval university was and what its function was particularly at the University of Padua. Medieval universities were originally founded as corporations or guilds, Universitas was the medieval Latin for corporation or society derived from whole or entire. These corporations were either of students or of teachers. When it was founded Padua was a universitas of students. All students on matriculation were assigned to a Natio or Nation according to their place of origin or their mother tongue.\n\nStudent nations or simply nations (Latin: natio meaning “being born”) are regional corporations of students at a university. Once widespread across Europe in medieval times […] Students in the University of Padua were divided into 22 nations, which referred to the different territories ruled by the Republic of Venice, to the biggest states of Italy, and to the main states of Europe. Nations were: German (also called Alemannian), Bohemian, Hungarian, Provençal, Burgundian, Spanish, Polish, English, Scottish, Venetian, Overseas (Venetian Greek Islands), Lombard (East Lombardy and West Veneto), Trevisan (North and East Veneto), Friulian, Dalmatian, Milanese, Roman, Sicilian, Anconitan, Tuscan, Piedmontese and Genoan. (Wikipedia)\n\nThe Natio played an active role in the administration of the university and Marius played an active role in the administration of the German Nation. If English had used the term university politics I probably wouldn’t have commented but “politically active” has too many varying connotations for the context.\n\nThe management of the Nations business was carried out by two councillors, who were elected annually like the procurators. They were responsible for the most important university affairs, such as elections of the chancellors or appointments. […] From July 28th 1604, they were replaced by Caspar Hofmann and Simon Marius. Marius stayed in office until his departure in July 1605.[1]\n\nN.E: In 1602 Marius extended his tutelage to Baldessar Capra, a wealthy student from Milan, in mathematics and astronomy, but there is also evidence that he supplemented his income by practicing medicine.\n\nThere is no evidence that Marius supplemented his income by practicing medicine, rather he matriculated to study medicine which he did from 1601 to 1605, but which our wannabee historian doesn’t appear to know.\n\nOur wannabee historian hasn’t done his fucking research properly, has he?\n\nN.E: Capra and Marius both observed the nova of 1604 together, and with Marius’s help Capra published a book on the new ‘guest’ star. In 1607 Capra published under his own name Galileo’s instruction manual on the sector, which was circulated in the form of a manuscript, and which led to Capra’s expulsion from the university. It appears that Marius played an important role in this plagiarism, but he had returned to his native land in 1605 and so temporarily escaped vilification. In Italy, however, Marius’s reputation was tarnished by this fraud, and by certain other questionable practices as head of the German Nation.\n\nGalileo supplement his income by manufacturing a brass sector, or military compass. He earned more money by selling an instruction manual for the instrument and giving lessons in its use to the purchasers. The manual was initially in manuscript but in 1607 he had a limited number printed. It was, however, not published but distributed privately. Capra obtained a copy translated it into Latin, the original was in Italian, and published it in his own name. Galileo hauled him before the university authorities, where he was expelled from the university and his book was confiscated.\n\nAs noted Marius returned to Franconia in July 1605 and there is absolutely no evidence that he was involved in this plagiarism, although Capra named him in the pamphlet as his maths teacher.\n\nThe authorities confiscated his book and threw him out of the university. That did not satisfy Galileo, who published a brief, brutal rebuttal of the goat (la capra) who had got his goat.[2]\n\nNo accusation was made against Marius by Galileo in his anti-Capra diatribe in 1607.\n\nIn the middle of April 1605, Marius occupied another important position in the Nation. He became librarian. […] When Marius left Padua, Christian Rosian became the librarian. At his farewell the Nation unanimously decided to give Marius a small monetary gift for his loyal service.[3]\n\nQuestionable practices? Our wannabee historian is making shit up again!\n\nN.E: Upon his return from Italy, Marius settled in the city of Ansbach and accepted the post of court mathematician, marrying Felicitas Lauer, the daughter of his publisher.\n\nDidn’t our wannabee historian say that Marius was “appointment as court mathematician of the Markgrafschaftof Ansbach in 1601.” Now he’s saying it was when he returned from Padua, was Marius a quantum time traveller?\n\nN.E: In 1609 he published the first German translation (from the original Greek) of the first six books of Euclid’s Elements.\n\nMore sloppy research from our wannabee historian. Marius’ translation was published in 1610 not 1609 and it was not the first German translation, that honour goes to Wilhelm Holtzman (Guilielmus Xylander), who published Die Sechs Ersten Bücher Euclidis in Basel in 1562.\n\nN.E: But Marius’ most memorable (and controversial) research involved the telescope. In the fall of 1608, at the Frankfurt Fair, Marius met an artillery officer who tried to sell him a spyglass. Intrigued, the two set about reproducing the device by using spectacle lenses, but it was not until at least a year later that Marius obtained instruments good enough for astronomical observations.\n\nGiven how well documented this episode in the history of the telescope is, I find it fascinating how badly our wannabee historian mangles the facts here; it can only be described as a cluster fuck!\n\nSimon Marius was not at the autumn Fair in Frankfurt in 1608. The officer, a general, who was there was the splendidly named Johan Philipp Fuchs von Bimbach, who was not in the artillery, but was at the time Privy Councillor to Joachim Ernst Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, Simon Marius’ employer.\n\nHe was in the situation not the seller but the potential purchaser. The potential seller was an otherwise anonymous Belgica (then the Latin for a Netherlander), who claimed to be the inventor. The telescope he was offering to Fuchs von Bimbach had a broken lens and the two couldn’t agree on a price. Returning to Ansbach, Fuchs von Bimbach told Marius what he had seen and the two tried to construct a telescope using spectacle lenses and although, they understood the principle they failed. They tried to get better lenses made in Nürnberg, then a major centre for the manufacture of cheap spectacles but that was also not successful. Eventually Fuchs von Bimbach imported a finished telescope from the Netherlands, and they began observing in summer 1609. Later they bought lenses from Venice and constructed a better telescope.\n\nN.E: In 1614 Marius published the fruits of his research on Jupiter in a book entitled Mundus Iovialis anno M.DC.IX Detectus Ope Perspicilli Belgici (“The Jovian World, discovered in 1609 by means of the Dutch Telescope”), in which he claimed that he had observed Jupiter’s moons beginning as early as the end of November 1609 and furthermore had begun recording his observations on December 29. That said, Marius had adopted the Julian calendar and so the date corresponded to January 8, 1610, on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nSince Marius did not publish any observations, as Galileo had done in his Sidereus Nuncius, it is impossible to verify Marius’s claim. His reputation was, however, not the highest.\n\nActually, wannabee historian, it’s the other way round:\n\nUnlike Galileo, however, Marius provided detailed tables of his observations, part of what helped clear him to the Dutch panel. And on the cover of the Mundo Iovialis, Marius sketched the objects in orbit, a contrast to Galileo’s sketch using asterisks and the letter O, making what Pasachoff says was “arguably the first image of the orbits.”[4]\n\nThere are no observations in the Sidereus Nuncius but there are tables of observation in Mundus Iovialis.\n\nIn 1614, Marius had a perfectly good reputation, so why is the wannabee historian claiming that it wasn’t? He’s sort of justifying Galileo’s anti-Marius tirade in The Assayer (Il Saggiatore) from 1623. Before we take at look at this one should note that The Assayer was published nine years after Mundus Iovialis and sixteen years after the Capra plagiarism affair.\n\nLike a lot of others our wannabee historian takes The Assayer seriously, appearing to think that what Galileo spouts in this evil piece of polemic must be true. It’s Galileo, it’s Holy Writ! People gush over what a brilliant a piece of polemic The Assayer is, what they ignore is that it’s in reality a stinking turd of a text. The Assayer was one text in a heated exchange between Galileo and the Jesuit, mathematician, and astronomer Orazio Grassi (1583–1654) on the nature of comets. What most people overlook or simple refuse to acknowledge is that in this dispute Galileo was horribly, utterly, and totally wrong. Grassi argued on the basis of observations and mathematical calculations that the three comets of 1618 were supralunar, Galileo, surprisingly, argued that they were merely sublunar optical effects. Surprisingly, because by 1618 virtually the whole of the astronomical community had long ago accepted that comets were indeed supralunar, and Aristotle was wrong on this. Despite being provably wrong, Galileo maintained his strange position including it in his Dialogo in 1632. Not content with arguing falsely against Grassi’s scientific viewpoint, Galileo poured a ton of vicious abuse on his head. Having built up steam Galileo also launched a vicious attack on the Jesuit astronomer Christoph Scheiner (1573–1650) with whom he had had a dispute over sunspots a decade before. Covering him in a torrent of abuse he also falsely accused Scheiner of having plagiarised his work on sunspots. This turned out to be more than somewhat ironical as Galileo would go on to plagiarise Scheiner on the topic in his Dialogo. This is the context in which one has to view Galileo’s attack on his third victim in The Assayer, Simon Marius:\n\nOf such usurpers I might name not a few, but I shall pass them over now in silence, as it is customary for first offenses to receive less severe punishment than subsequent ones. But I shall not remain silent any longer about a second offender who has tried too audaciously to do me the very same thing which he did many years ago by appropriating the invention of my geometric compass, despite the fact that I had many years previously shown it and dis- cussed it before a large number of gentlemen and had finally made it public in print. May I be pardoned this if, against my nature, my habit, and my present intentions – I show resentment and cry out, perhaps with too much bitterness, about a thing which I have kept to myself these many years. I speak of Simon Marius of Gunzenhausen; he it was in Padua, where I resided at the time, who set forth in Latin the use of the said compass of mine and, appropriating it to himself, had one of his pupils print this under his name. Forthwith, per- haps to escape punishment, he departed immediately for his native land, leaving his pupil in the lurch as the saying goes; and against the latter, in the absence of Simon Marius, I was obliged to proceed in the manner which is set forth in the Defence which I then wrote and published.\n\nThis is quite extraordinary, firstly there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Marius wrote the said plagiarism published by Capra and Galileo raised no such charge in 1607 when he prosecuted Capra. As noted above Marius left Padua in July 1605 two years before Capra published his stolen text and there is not record of Marius and Capra having any contact whatsoever after his departure. It is patently obvious that Galileo is making shit up! Does our wannabee historian even question Galileo’s unfounded and obviously spurious accusation? Does he hell he simple prints it without comment leading any reader not aware of the true facts in the belief that Galileo’s accusation is true!\n\nGalileo now ramps up his accusations claiming that Marius had plagiarised his Sidereus Nuncius in his Mundus Iovialis, going so far as to claim that Marius had never even observed Jupiter and its moons:.\n\nFour years after the publication of my Sidereal Messenger, this same fellow, desiring as usual to ornament himself with the labours of others) did not blush to make him- self the author of the things I had discovered and printed in that work. Publishing under the title of The Jovian World, he had the temerity to claim that he had observed the Medicean planets which revolve about Jupiter before I had done so. But because it rarely happens that truth allows herself to be suppressed by falsehood, you may see how he himself, through his carelessness and lack of understanding, gives me in that very work of his the means of convicting him by irrefutable testimony and revealing unmistakably his error, showing not only that he did not observe the said stars before me but even that he did not certainly see them until two years afterwards; and I say moreover that it may be affirmed very probably that he never observed them at all.\n\nAfter making an argument about the inclinations of the orbits of the satellites to the ecliptic, Galileo turned his attention to the date on which Marius claimed to have discovered the satellites:\n\nNext, notice the craft with which he tries to show himself prior to me. I wrote in my Sidereal Messenger of making my first observation on the seventh of January, 1610, continuing then with others on the succeeding nights. Along comes Marius, and, appropriating my very observations, he prints in the title page of his book and again in the opening part of his work that he had already made his observations in the year 1609, trying to give people the idea that he was first. Now the earliest observation that he produces as made by him is the second one made by me; yet he announces it as made in the year 1609. What he neglects to mention to the reader is that since he is outside our church and has not accepted the Gregorian calendar, the seventh day of January of 1610 for us Catholics is the same as the twenty-eighth day of December of 1609 for those heretics. So much for the priority of his pretended observations.\n\nOnce again we have a strange timelapse in Galileo’s outraged response to the publication of Mundus Iovialis, this time of nine years. Galileo had been informed of its publication by two separate people already in 1614. He had already discussed it in his correspondence in that year. If he truly believed that Marius had plagiarised him why didn’t he respond, after all following the publication of the Sidereus Nuncius he had become the most famous astronomer in Europe and was also now mathematicus and philosophicus at the Medici Court in Florence. He could have crushed Marius, the insignificant court mathematicus in Ansbach like a flea. Vindictively crushing his perceived opponent was his favourite pastime in those years. It’s even what he was paid to do, as after diner entertainment in Florence as court philosophicus. So, why did he wait nine years?\n\nGalileo’s claim his carelessness and lack of understanding, gives me in that very work of his the means of convicting him by irrefutable testimony and revealing unmistakably his error is, of course, pompous bluster.\n\nAs to Galileo’s notice the craft with which he tries to show himself prior to me. In his Mundus Iovialis Marius wrote:\n\nThis is the exact truth … In recounting all this, I am not to be understood as wishing to lessen Galileo’s reputation, or to snatch from him the discovery of these Jovian stars among his countrymen in Italy – far from it. My object rather is, that it may be understood that these stars were not shown to me by any mortal in any way, but were discovered and observed by me, by my own investigation, in Germany, almost at the very time, or slightly before it, at which Galileo first saw them in Italy. The credit, therefore, of the first discovery of these stars in Italy is deservedly assigned to Galileo and remains his.\n\nMundus Ioviales Prickard/Van Helden p. 6\n\nMarius states that his first observation of the moons as moons was on 29 December by the Julian calenda, that’s 8 January by the Gregorian calendar, whereas Galileo’s was on the 7 January, so just one day later, more than justifying his almost at the same time. He also states that he had already been observing them for some days previously, assuming that they were stars, so his earlier is perhaps also valid. What is certain is that he is not trying to claim priority over Galileo by using the Julian calendar to date his observations. Anybody interested in astronomy at the time, who might have read both the Sidereus Nuncius and the Mundus Iovialis would have been well aware that the two astronomers, given their locations and religious affiliations, would be using two different calendars. In fact, many astrologers at the time, and Galileo and Marius were both astrologers, issued their writing calendars and prognostica with two parallel date columns one for Gregorian, new style, dates and one for Julian, old style, dates. Marius didn’t need to tell his readers, they already knew.\n\nN.E: Nevertheless, at the behest of Johannes Kepler, Marius named the moons after the lovers of Zeus (the Greek equivalent of Jupiter): Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Galileo, predictably enough, steadfastly refused to accept Marius’ names and instead invented the numbering scheme that is still used today, alongside proper moon names. In accordance with this scheme, the Galilean satellites were assigned numbers based on their proximity to their parent planet and increase with distance. Hence, the moons of Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto were designated as Jupiter I, II, III and IV, respectively.\n\nIf our wannabee historian had bothered to read Mundus Iovialis he would know that it was a suggestion of Kepler’s not a behest and was only one of four suggestions made by Marius in his Mundus Iovialis. I’ve written about this before, so quoting myself:\n\nIn the Mundus Iovialis Marius makes several naming suggestions. His first suggestion was, like Galileo, to just number the moons I to IV, a system that was actually used by astronomers. His second suggestion follows Galileo in that he wishes to name them after his employer/patron the Margrave of Ansbach’s family and call them the Brandenberger Stars. Marius’ third suggestion is more than somewhat bizarre as he suggests naming them in analogy to the solar system planets, so the moon with the smallest orbit would be the Jupiter Mercury, the next the Jupiter Venus, the third the Jupiter Jupiter and the fourth the Jupiter Saturn. His argument for leaving out Jupiter Mars is too long to include here. As I said bizarre. It is with Marius’ fourth suggestion that we finally arrive at Zeus’ lovers. After talking about Jupiter’s reputation for a bit on the side and describing his most notorious affairs Marius wrote the following:\n\nIn Europa, Ganimedes puer, atque Calisto,\n\nLascivo nimium perplacuere Jovi.\n\nIo, Europa, the young Ganymede and Calisto\n\nappealed all too much to the lascivious Jove\n\nIn the next paragraph Marius goes on to explain that the idea for using these names for the moons was suggested to him by Johannes Kepler when the two of them met at the Imperial Parliament in Regensburg in October 1613. He then names Kepler as co-godfather of these four stars. Marius closes his list of suggestions by saying that the whole thing should not be taken too seriously, and everybody is free to adopt or reject his suggestions as they see fit.\n\nPlease note the final sentence.\n\nNobody really used the names Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto before the twentieth century, so claiming that Galileo, predictably enough, steadfastly refused to accept Marius’ names is really a piece of bullshit from our wannabee historian.\n\nN.E: In retrospect, Galileo probably went a bit overboard in these accusations, in much the same way as he had countered his critics within the Catholic Church, for it appears certain that Marius was independently observing Jupiter’s moons by December 1610.\n\nA bit overboard? It’s like describing a drugged-up berserker in full battle rage as a bit over excited.\n\nN.E: Mundus Lovialis (sic) does, however, contain a telescopic discovery the priority of which has never been disputed: On December 15, 1612, Marius was the first to observe the Andromeda Nebula, which could not be resolved into stars, describing it as a “flame seen through horn.” Apparently, Marius was not aware that this object had been seen previously by medieval Persian astronomers and described by Al Sufi as early as 964 a. d.\n\nThe comment about al-Sufi is quite frankly bizarre, to quote Wikipedia:\n\nThe Andromeda Galaxy has been visible to the naked eye, given dark skies, throughout history; as such, it cannot be said to have been “discovered” by any one individual [my emphasis]. Around the year 964 CE,the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahmen al-Sufi was the first to formally describe the Andromeda Galaxy. He referred to it in his Book of Fixed Stars as a “nebulous smear” or “small cloud”.\n\nStar charts of that period labelled it as the Little Cloud. In 1612, the German astronomer Simon Marius gave an early description of the Andromeda Galaxy based on telescopic observations.\n\nI have a post on the history of the Andromeda nebula/galaxy here\n\nN.E: Marius’ telescope showed that even the distant stars appeared as disks, and he interpreted them as such; a notion that persisted for much of the 17th century. Indeed, it was only after a proper theory of diffraction was formulated that these ideas were firmly put to rest. Nonetheless, Marius used this as evidence that the stars were not as far away as would have been required to bolster the Copernican worldview.\n\nOur wannabee historian should read more Chris Graney.[5] The “big star” argument, as it is known originates with Tycho Brahe, who estimated the diameter of stars based on his naked-eye observations. He argued that if the stars were so far away that they displayed no stellar parallax, as required by the Copernican world system, then they must literally unbelievably immense. Marius’ correct observation of the solid star discs in his telescope supported Tycho’s big star argument and was accepted throughout the seventeenth century.\n\nThis argument based on star sizes was what Christiaan Huygens called Brahe’s “principal argument” against the heliocentric system.[6]\n\nThat the solid disc that Marius saw was an artefact produced by the optics of the telescope, now known as an Airy Disc, was unknown not only to Marius but to all other users of the telescope at the time. It was first dismissed as an illusion by Edmond Halley at the end of the century. Interestingly, Galileo also observed the Airy discs with his telescopes but, knowing that they lent support to the Tychonic system, deliberately didn’t publish the information.\n\nI think the best way to describe what follow as “our wannabee historian has jumped the shark!”\n\nN.E: From several remarks in his works, it appears that Marius was a militant Lutheran. He kept up his correspondence with David Fabricius and Kepler’s former teacher, Michael Maestlin, both of whom were self-proclaimed Lutherans. Furthermore, Marius even defended Tycho Brahe’s Lutheran world system on scriptural as well as astronomical and physical grounds.\n\nBy the time Marius was born, Lutheran Protestantism was an established religion, and he was born and brought up in a Lutheran area; Nürnberg, just down the road from Gunzenhausen, was the very first Lutheran city state. Unlike Kepler or Newton there is nothing in his work to suggest that he was particularly religious let alone militant. I hope David Fabricius and Michael Mästlin were Lutherans, although I don’t know what self-proclaimed is supposed to mean, as the former was a village pastor and the latter professor in Tübingen, a Lutheran university.\n\nTo described Tycho’s world system as Lutheran is a joke. Yes, Tycho was Lutheran, as was the whole of Denmark at that time, but his world system is in no way denominational. Would our wannabee historian call the Copernican system Catholic, just because Copernicus was a Catholic cathedral canon? What about Kepler? He was also a Lutheran, who had even worked with Tycho, but he propagated a heliocentric system! Maybe our wannabee historian is not aware that the Catholic Church in the early seventeenth century condemned Copernicus’ heliocentric system and the Jesuits adopted Tycho’s geo-heliocentric system as their official view of the cosmos around 1620, making it de facto the official position of the Catholic Church on cosmology. After all it’s a little-known episode in the history of astronomy!\n\nN.E: It is interesting to note that while Marius was undoubtedly an observer of the most important astronomical discoveries of the early 17th century, he opposed the heliocentric view of the cosmos and favoured the Tychonic system.\n\nThere is a light disparaging undertone to all of our wannabee historian’s comments about Marius supporting the Tychonic system. He appears either not to know, or perhaps even worse refuses to accept, that in the early seventeenth century the available empirical evidence was clearly in favour of a Tychonic or semi-Tychonic system over a heliocentric one, and that is why the majority of astronomer, and not just Marius, supported one. Support of a heliocentric system, at that time, was an act of faith.\n\nN.E: Perhaps it was Marius’ staunch belief in this system over that of the Copernican counterpoint that gave him pause to accept the reality of the eclipsing satellite phenomenon with Jupiter.\n\nOn the subject of Jupiter eclipsing its moons, what Marius actually writes is:\n\nThat when near Jupiter something similar happens to them, so that they not only appear smaller, but as seems probable are actually obscured or eclipsed, is clear from the following consideration. Jupiter is not a transparent body, any more than Venus or Mercury; therefore throws a shadow on the side turned away from the Sun. How far such a shadow extends, and whether all four pass into it and are eclipsed once in each revolution, I will now show in as few words as may be.\n\n[There now follow extensive careful considerations and calculations, which I will spare my readers]\n\nTherefore all four Jovian bodies are within the shadow of Jupiter at the beginning of their movement, and are eclipsed.[7]\n\nNone of his consideration or calculation have anything whatsoever to do with his acceptance of a Tychonic system or his rejection of the Copernican one.\n\nNeil English does get some of Marius’s life and work right, which I haven’t included in this overlong review of his highly dubious essay. He does, however, end on a positive note, emphasising that Martius was not the villain that Galileo presented him as in The Assayer.\n\nN.E: To this day, Marius’ work is overshadowed by the accusation of plagiarism, even though it was demonstrated by a jury convened in the Netherlands in the early 1900s that he had, in fact, conducted much of his research entirely independently of others. In more recent times, Simon Marius was honoured by the astronomical community by the naming of a lunar crater after him in 1935, the 41-km-diameter Marius Crater. And in 1979 a region on Jupiter’s moon, Ganymede, was named Marius Regio. In 2014, asteroid (7984) Marius was named in his honour, discovered on September 29, 1980, by Czech astronomer Zdenka Vavrova at the Kiel Observatory, and provisionally designated 1980 SM.\n\nThis doesn’t, however, excuse the badly researched garbage that precedes it.\n\nNeil English’s article is four and a quarter-pages long and the quarter would fit easily into the large gap on the title page between title and text, so actually only four pages long has a grand total of 2071 words [this blog post has 5500 words!] For this extremely short collection of errors, false statements, and at times total hogwash Springer in their wisdom demand, for a pdf, the princely sum of €29,95. The abysmal quality of English’s Marius essay raises, for me, the question as to whether the other essays in his book are also as badly researched? If they are then the €249.09 for the entire book can only be described as a brazen rip off!\n\n[1] Hans Gaab, Concerning the Biography of Simon Marius (1573–1626) in Hans Gaab & Pierre Leich eds., Simon Marius and His Research, Springer, 2018 pp. 91–92.\n\n[2] J.

In the last couple of decades, the debate over these claims has not just reached boiling point but has violently boiled over enveloping the participants in clouds of scolding steam, following the emergence of the professed gnu-atheists with the so-called Four Horsemen–Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett–driving their unholy hordes into the fray. Some of the utterances uttered by these deniers of the faith have been so mind bogglingly stupid that it hurts.\n\nDawkins and some of his sycophants have even gone so far as to claim that it is basically impossible to be a good scientist if you believe in a god. The historian of science cringes when confronted by such inanities. Just to take one quick example out of my own area of interest, Johannes Kepler, René Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Robert Boole, and Isaac Newton, who have all been hailed as founding fathers of modern science, were all deeply religious. In fact, it would not be an exaggeration to describe Isaac Newton as fanatically religious. I have actually been told by combative atheists when confronted with Isaac Newton’s deep religiosity that he could have achieved so much more in science if he hadn’t wasted his time and effort on Bible studies. This comes from people who have not even contributed 0.01% to the development of science that Newton did.\n\nI should clearly state my own position on religion, before I continue with this blog post. As I have said often in the past on the Internet, I am the life-long atheist son of an atheist father and an agnostic mother. However, as my father, who was an archaeologist, historian, and anthropologist, explained to me in a discussion, when I was still a teenager, if you wish to understand this world and its history, you have to understand the influence that the religions have had on that history. Valuable advice that I have taken to heart as a historian of science. I continue to find it deeply ironical that I spend quite a lot of time and energy defending the contributions of deeply religious individuals and groups, such as the Jesuits, to the evolution of the sciences against the rages of ‘convinced atheists,’ who claim that such believers only blocked scientific progress.\n\nAll of the above is just a prologue, setting the stage, for a review of a comparatively new contribution to the ongoing debate, Magisteria: The Entangled Histories of Religion and Science by Nicolas Spencer.[1]\n\nI had no idea who Nicholas Spencer is and where exactly he is coming from in this debate, so I offer my readers this potted CV from the website of Theos, which describes itself so, Theos stimulates the debate about the place of religion in society, challenging and changing ideas through research, commentary and events.\n\nNick is Senior Fellow at Theos. He is the author of a number of books and reports, including Magisteria: the entangled histories of science and religion (Oneworld, 2023), The Political Samaritan: how power hijacked a parable (Bloomsbury, 2017), The Evolution of the West (SPCK, 2016) and Atheists: The Origin of the Species (Bloomsbury, 2014). He is host of the podcast Reading Our Times. Outside of Theos, Nick is Visiting Research Fellow at the Faiths and Civil Society Unit, Goldsmiths, University of London and a Fellow of the International Society for Science and Religion. He tweets @theosnick\n\nSpencer’s Magisteria is an episodic, chronological survey of the changing relationship between science and religion throughout Western history from the Ancient Greeks down to AI, debunking the standard myths, Hypatia and Galileo for example, on route.\n\nSome readers will probably recognise the title from the NOMA hypothesis of the palaeontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould (1941–2002). NOMA is non-overlapping magisterial, this was Gould’s suggested solution to the supposed conflict, claiming that science and religion each represent different areas of inquiry, facts vs values, so there is a difference between the “nets” over which they have “a legitimate magisterium, or domain of teaching authority”, and the two domains do not overlap. For fairly obvious reasons Gould’s solution didn’t float. Spencer devote quite a lot of space to it in the appropriate section of his book.\n\nSpencer’s book is in general an excellent, comprehensive introduction to a complex and much discussed, or better said, disputed topic. He clears away the accumulated dead wood and by carefully researched factual presentation shows that there is no monolithic explanation of the relationship between science and religion and certainly no fundamental conflict or war as it has been called. In fact, he demonstrates quite clearly based on the actual historical facts that the final combination in my multiple title offer, a cuddle muddle of numerous variations, is the correct assessment of that relationship.\n\nOn the whole reading through the book, I got the impression that Spencer was more at home, more attuned with, the life and social sciences–biology, sociology, anthropology– than with so-called exact sciences–mathematics, physics, astronomy. The sections on the former seemed to me to be deeper and with more understanding than the latter. An impression that was underlined by some bizarre errors that my pedantic alter ego simply could not ignore, all of which were related to the exact science. Maybe there are similar errors by the life and social science essays that due to my comparative lack of knowledge in these fields escaped my attention, but I don’t think this was the case.\n\nDespite these errors, which I will highlight shortly, I heartily recommend Magisteria to anyone and everyone with an interest in the topic be it professional, semi-professional or simply curiosity.\n\nThe book is divided into four parts the first of which with the title, Science and Religion Before Science and Religion, has five subsections, the first of which The Nature of Natural Philosophy: Science and Religion in the Ancient World, opens with one of the two most famous clashes between science and religion, Hypatia.\n\nSpencer does an excellent job of dispensing with the myths but here delivers up his first major questionable statement in the exact sciences, when he writes, Hypatia was by all accounts, a fine astronomer and a first rank mathematician… and …her father [Theon], an equally formidable mathematician…. I have already dealt with this in a separate post and won’t repeat myself here. However, I will add the judgement of G. J. Toomer, the leading expert on Ptolemy’s Almagest, which Theon edited and wrote a commentary on:\n\nTheon was a competent mathematician for his time, but completely unoriginal. He typifies the scholastic of later antiquity who was content to expound recognized classics in his field without ever attempting to go beyond them.\n\nThe rest of this chapter is a good brief summary of the relationship between natural philosophy and Christianity down the John Philoponus in the sixth century, revealing it to be multifaceted. He does, however, having declared, correctly, that astrology was a science, devotes some space to the Holy Fathers rejection of it. It seems that Spencer has something against astrology as he only mentions it couple of more times in his book, each times negatively. Interestingly having featured the Holy Fathers rejection of astrology he makes no mention of Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, who were responsible for establishing Aristotle as Catholic science in the Middle Ages, having re-established and legitimised astrology within the Catholic Church.\n\nStaying on the same topic, in the third chapter, Ambiguous and Argumentative: Science and Judaism, Spencer mentions that the prophet Isaiah warned his people against consulting astrologers. The term that is translated as astrologers in the King James Bible is, in fact, viewers of the heavens and as Isaiah is here thundering against the Babylonians in the eight or seven century BCE, he is referencing Babylonian omen astrology which is a very different beast to what we now understand under the term astrology. Later Spencer, quite rightly, introduces the twelfth century Jewish scholar, Maimonides, and amongst other things writes, “he was to be remembered, however, but as a scholar and prolific author, witing on logic, astronomy, astrology (which he dismissed) and medicine. At the end of the chapter, he briefly introduces Gersonides, Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344), and writes, “And yet in spite of his tough-minded scientific approach, Gersonides was unlike Maimonides, a firm believer in astrology, which he credited with a determinism over human affairs.” A clear anti-astrology value judgement on Spencer’ part. However, that is not the reason I have emphasised these quotes, later in his book in the Early Modern Period, when nearly all tough-minded scientists, such as Kepler and Galileo, were practicing astrologers and astrology played a very central role in the relations between science and religion, Spencer makes absolutely no mention of it whatsoever.\n\nSticking with astrology, going back a chapter we have, A Fragile Balance: Science and Islam, on the whole a reasonably done debunking of various myths, Spencer delivers up a gob-smacking false statement with relation to astrology. He writes, “In astronomy, through accurate instruments, precise and repeated observations and a willingness to disentangle the subject from astrology…!” Astrology lay at the heart of Islamic astronomy and was one of the principal reasons for their engagement with the subject. We are talking here about the ‘Abbāsid Caliphate, which basically created the climate in which Islamic science grew and flourished. The Abbasids commissioned not just one but two horoscopes from leading astrologers to determine the most opportune moment to lay the foundation stones of their new capital, Baghdad. Spencer gives no reference for his strange and totally false statement but a few pages on he does reference Dimitri Gutas’ excellent Greek Thought, Arabic Culture: The Graeco-Arabic Translation Movement in Baghdad and Early ’Abbāsid Society. I must ask if Spencer actually read it, because in his book Gutas emphasises the central role that astrology played in Islamic science and in particular the lead role it played in the ’Abbāsid determination to appropriate Greek science.\n\nChapters four, Science in Christendom, and five, 1543 and All That are on the whole good with one small exception. Concerning Osiander’s ad lectorum in De revolutionibus, Spencer writes, “Rheticus arranged the publication of De revolutionibus with Osiander…” This is simply wrong. There was no contact on this topic between Rheticus and Osiander. Rheticus was ordered to take up his new position as professor in Leipzig by Melanchthon, making it impossible for him to see the manuscript through the press. Johannes Petreius, the printer publisher, appointed Osiander, with whom he already had a working relationship, to edit the manuscript.\n\nChapter six deals with Galileo Galilei and is on the whole done reasonably well except where he writes on the final page, “But Galileo’s work continued to draw less attention than his life. Newton praised him in his Principia Mathematica, but his own mathematics and astronomy clearly surpassed those of the man on whose shoulders he stood.” Spencer is here perpetuating a widely spread myth. Galileo and his work hardly feature in Principia at all, there are no shoulders being stood on here and Newton doesn’t praise him anywhere in the book. In half a dozen places where he utilises the parabola law of projectile motion or the law of fall, Newton acknowledges, in a couple of words, that the theorems are from Galileo and otherwise doesn’t acknowledge him in anyway whatsoever.\n\nIn Chapter eight, The Perils of Perfect Harmony, Spencer, unfortunately, delivers up the Newton Annus mirabilis myth without actually using the term, he writes:\n\n“Newton had emerged from the Aristotelian shadow in which Cambridge still lay within a few years of his arrival in 1661, and by 1664 he was reading and critiquing Descartes. He spent the following two years back at home in Woolsthorpe, after Cambridge closed on account of plague. It turned out to be a rather profitable sabbatical. Having effectively taught himself mathematics, he invented calculus (or ‘the method of series and fluxions’), the way of calculating continuous change by means of summing infinitesimal differences; split out the constituent elements of white light; made initial associations of planetary motion with terrestrial gravity; and nearly blinded himself by conducting experiments with a bodkin in his eye.”\n\nAlmost all of this is ahistorical hogwash as I have systematically analysed in an earlier post, so I won’t repeat myself here. Spencer’s “nearly blinded himself” is a wonderful flourish but unfortunately has no basis in fact. At least he correctly says bodkin, which is flat and blunt, as opposed to many of the shock horror brigade, who incorrectly say needle, which is pointed and sharp.\n\nChapter twelve is titled, Globalisation, and fairly logically starts with the seventeenth-century mission to China, where they used their superior astronomical knowledge to gain access to the highest levels of Chinese society in order to try and convert the Chinese to Christianity. Here Spencer drops a clangour. He writes:\n\nThe accuracy of the Jesuits’ science was impressive, despite the fact that, with only a few exceptions, the missionaries propounded Tycho Brahe’s geo-heliocentric model, the Copernican one being, of course, banned. It soon became clear to them that the Chinese calendar needed correction. The court was, at first, resistant to outside intervention in this, so vital to the performance of Chinese rites and the authority of the emperor was the calendar.\n\nA couple of minor details, firstly the Tychonic geo-heliocentric model was, at that time, the one best supported by the available empirical evidence, so yes that was the one the Jesuits used. The Copernican model was not banned, one could use it hypothetically, which many Catholic astronomers did, but could not state that it represented realty. Interestingly the Jesuits did introduce the Copernican heliocentric system into China. More importantly, it did not become clear to the Jesuits that the Chinese calendar needed correction. As Spencer says, calendar reforms were a central element of Chinese imperial court culture. There was a calendar reform carried out by Imperial Bureau of Astronomy whenever a new emperor was enthroned in order to be able to make accurate astrological prognostications. The Jesuits merely claimed that they could do it better than the Chinese astronomers.\n\nChapter fifteen is titled, Entangled and Uncertain, and deals with the new physics and astronomy in the early twentieth century. Dealing with Einstein and his theories of relativity there are several “minor” errors. We start off with an obvious attempt to be politically correct, Spencer writes:\n\nPrepared to doubt Newton’s authority (at least in extreme conditions), Einstein and his wife Mileva Marić combined Maxwell’s equations with the idea that the speed of light was a constant irrespective of the speed of any observer, to argue that the absolute and uniform nature of space and time inherent in Newton’s mechanics was not entirely accurate.\n\nThe claim that Mileva Marić somehow co-authored the special theory of relativity, which was propagated several years ago, has been thoroughly debunked. Also, Maxwell’s equations, if true and it was assumed that they were, had already shown that Newton’s physics couldn’t be correct, and Einstein provided the solution to this contradiction.\n\nMoving on, Spencer writes:\n\nOver the following decade, Einstein applied these ideas to gravity to form his theory of general relativity, which fused and mathematically described the three dimension of space and one of time. The theory made predictions about an anomaly within the orbit of Mercury, and when these were confirmed by Eddington’s observations in May 1919 [my emphasis], both theory and theorist achieved global fame.\n\nThe first time I read the emphasised sentence above I thought I had somehow misread and went back and read it a second time, but it really does say what it says. The anomaly in the orbit of Mercury existed in Newton’s theory of gravity and was well known. To quote Wikipedia, quoting Abraham Pais, “Einstein showed in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters (“fudge factors.”). Beyond this general relativity predicted that sufficiently large bodies would deflect or bend light. Newtonian gravity does too, but the degree of bending is significantly different in the two theories. In 1919, Arthur Eddington led an expedition to the island of Príncipe off the west coast of Africa to observe the solar eclipse of 19 May. His observations showed that the Sun bent starlight to a degree consistent with Einstein’s theory and not that of Newton.\n\nHaving done my usually hatchet job pointing out the errors that I spotted in Spencer’s book I will now briefly mention three of the nineteen chapters that most impressed me personally, not because there are intrinsically better than the others, apart from the errors mentioned above the quality of his explanations is consistently high, but because I learnt something new.\n\nThe first two are related and are connected to the reception of Darwin and evolution, which is apparently one of Spencer’s areas of expertise, to judge from his other publications. The topic is, of course, a central one in the whole religion contra science debate. In chapter eleven, The Balance, Spencer delivers a sober up to date account of the infamous 1860 Oxford debate on evolution during which Samuel Wilberforce is said to have clashed with Thomas Huxley. I say said to, because as Spencer points out there was, in earlier accounts, very little direct evidence of what was actually said.\n\nChapter fourteen, The Trial of the Century, is devoted to the equally infamous Scopes trial in Drayton, Tennessee in 1925. I’m quite happy to admit that all I knew about this episode in the history of the reception of the theory of evolution was that it was about the ban on teaching the theory in schools. I was not even aware that it was the defenders of evolution who provoked the trial. Spencer delivers a clear and very detailed account of the whole episode and of the fall out. A superb piece of contextual history of science writing.\n\nI grew up during the era of the “space race.” I was five years old when, to the horror of the Americans, the USSR launched Sputnik I, the very first artificial Earth satellite, on 4 October 1957. One of my earliest memories was being woken up by my mother and taken out onto our front lawn to view this marvel of technology. I was seventeen when the Apollo Lunar Module, Eagle, landed on the Moon on 20 July 1969 and Neil Armstrong took that first historic step onto the lunar surface. I never knew until I read Spencer’s seventeenth chapter, Storming the Heavens, that the early years of that superpower technological rivalry also had a powerful religious element–atheist Marxist Soviet technology vs In God We Trust American technology–delivered in the form of a propaganda war. For me this was a truly fascinating story that somehow, I had earlier missed although I lived through it.\n\nThe book has endnotes that basically only references the sources used for each chapter. There is no separate bibliography but a comprehensive further reading guide for the introduction and each of the four main sections of the book. For the areas that I know well, mostly excellent lists but I did baulk at his recommending Jim al-Khalili’s Pathfinders: The Golden Age of Arabic Science, which is in my opinion not a good book. I also found it strange that he recommended Walter Isaacson’s questionable Einstein: His Life and Universe rather than Abraham Pais’ far superior Subtle is the Lord: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein. The book closes with an extensive index. Each chapter features a grayscale frontispiece related to the content of the chapter, a couple of which I have reproduced above.\n\nDespite my negative comments above on selected statements in the book, it is very well written, very accessible and a stimulating and highly informative read, which I once again recommend to anybody and everybody with an interest in the subject.\n\n[1] Nicolas Spencer, Magisteria: The Entangled Histories of Religion and Science, Oneworld Publications, London, 2023.\n\nI have gained a reputation for pointing out and demolishing myths in the history of science. One area where these are particularly prevalent is in the history of the European Middle Ages. With numerous people claiming that there was little or no science during this period and what there was, was all wrong, usually blaming this situation on the Catholic Church. The people making these claims completely ignore the quite extensive literature on the history of medieval science written by such excellent historians as David C Lindberg, Edward Grant, Stephen C McCluskey, Bruce S Eastwood, Alastair C Crombie, and John E Murdoch amongst others. For those who don’t wish to plough through the academic literature, there is also a selection of excellent popular books on the subject, which I can warmly recommend. For example, David C Lindberg, The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, Prehistory to A.D. 1450, (Chicago UP, 2nd ed. 2007), or perhaps Seb Falk, The Light Ages: The Surprising Story of Medieval Science(Norton, 2020), which I reviewed here. Finally, James Hannam, God’s Philosophers: How the Medieval World Laid the Foundations of Modern Science, (Icon Books, 2009).\n\nOne of the most persistent myths against which my friend the HISTSCI_HULK has rampaged on several occasions is that, during the European Middle Ages, people believed that the world was flat. Following up on his excellent God’s Philosophers, James Hannam has now delivered the book that should squash that myth for ever, but I fear won’t, The Globe: How the Earth Became Round.[1]\n\nThe blog post title is not just a piss poor play on words of the book’s subtitle, in his just over three-hundred pages, Hannam takes his readers on a journey both chronological and geographically around the world starting around 3000 BCE in the fertile crescent to England in the twentieth century on a wild zig zag course. The opening three chapters give brief but informative accounts of the image of the heavens and the earth of the ancient Babylonians, the ancient Egyptians, and the ancient Persians, all of whom believed in a flat earth with themselves at the centre under a ceiling like heaven, with varying explanations as to where the sun went at night and the moon during the day.\n\nHaving only devoted one brief chapter to each of these great ancient civilisations, Hannam now devotes six chapters to Ancient Greece! Seems unfair but it is here that the main action takes place, over a period of about four centuries the Earth transitioned from flat to spherical in Greek thought and Hannam, here, details each phase of that transition. He proceeds from Archaic Greece, the poems of Homer and Hesiod describing a circular flat earth, moving on to the Origins of Greek Thought, where he is refreshingly sceptical about claims made about Thales’ views. Next up are the Pre-Socratics and Socrates ending with Socrates death. Socrates is, of course followed by Plato and the earliest confirmed mention of a spherical Earth, Plato, in his Phaedo dialogue, supposedly quoting Socrates:\n\n“I assumed that [Anaxagoras] would begin by informing us whether the Earth is flat or round, and then he’d explain why it had to be that way because that was what was better.”[2]\n\nThe following chapter on Plato goes deep into the discussion, as to where and from whom the idea that the Earth is a sphere first comes from, as it is obvious from the way that Plato writes about it that the discussion flat or round was already under way. After Plato comes Aristotle and we have the first clear statement that the Earth is a sphere, why it must be a sphere and empirical evidence that supports the statement that the Earth is a sphere:\n\nAristotle concluded his discission by showing how the theory of the Globe explained observations that might seem otherwise inexplicable. In the first place, he said that when there is a lunar eclipse the shadow of the Earth on the Moon is always curved. This corroborates what he had already shown from his first principles. The umbra during a lunar eclipse follows from the shape of the Earth. If it is a ball, its shadow must always be an arc.\n\nHis second piece of empirical evidence is the way the visible stars change as we travel north or south. He noted that some stars, which are visible in Egypt and Cyprus, can’t be seen in the north. He is almost certainly referring to Eudoxus’ observations of Canopus. It is bright enough to be hard to miss in Egypt, albeit usually low in the sky. Its absence from view in Athens would have been obvious to anyone who had seen it further south. This is only explicable if the Earth is rounded, if it were a flat plane, everyone would see the same stars. Since it is spherical, it’s inevitable that our view of the heavens will change with latitude.[3]\n\nSo, we have reached our objective, Aristotle demonstrated that the Earth is a sphere and not flat. End of story! No! Everything up till now was merely a prelude, the real story is just beginning. Hannam closes his section on Aristotle with the following:\n\nBy any conventional standards he [Aristotle] knew the Earth was a sphere, and he was probably the first person who did. On that basis, he discovered the theory of the Globe. As we will see in the remainder of this book, everyone today who knows the Earth is round indirectly learnt it from Aristotle. This makes the Globe the greatest scientific achievement of antiquity. It’s only because we take it as obvious that we don’t give Aristotle the credit he deserves.[4]\n\nHannam now take his readers of a journey through history and around the globe explaining how different cultures reacted when confronted, either directly or indirectly, with Aristotle’s truth. What their own vision of the Earth’s form was before that confrontation. Who came to accept the new vision, who reacted against it, rejecting. It’s a complex story that Hannam handles with verve, explicating clearly and accurately every twist and turn.\n\nFirst off, Hannam stays with the Greeks and explains how the Stoics, who succeeded Aristotle as philosophical flavour of the century by supporting his conviction that the Earth was a sphere spread and established the view not only amongst the Greek but also the Romans, many leading figures having adopted the Stoic philosophy. The Stoics main rivals, the Epicureans, however, having adopted the cosmological theories of the Atomists reject the sphere maintaining that the Earth was flat. Their rejection of the sphere followed from their belief that the Earth was not the centre of the cosmos, the starting point of Aristotle’s argument for the sphere. Hannam also takes a close look at Greek cartography, if the Earth is a sphere how do you represent in in a flat diagram? Hannam moves on to a discussion of Roman culture and the representation of the Orbis within that culture.\n\nIn these sections Hannam points out that the Greek and Roman terms, such as the Latin Orbis, can mean both circle and sphere. Orbis is etymologically the origin of both orbit, a circle, and orb, a sphere. So, a modicum of caution is required when interpreting the historical texts.\n\nOur journey now takes us through India, the Sassanian Persian Empire, Early Judaism and with it for the first time the Biblical view of the shape of the Earth and on into Christianity. Christianity had of course a problem with the inherent contradiction between the Bible, the infallible word of God, and the words of Aristotle. This led to a spirited discussion in the early Church that Hannam explicates, with his usual clarity. There was not just one but multiple discussion in the various early Christian communities. He we get one of the most notorious flat earther from antiquity, Cosmas Indicopleutes, who often gets quoted by those claiming that the people in the Middle Ages believed the world to be flat. The last of the so-called Abrahamic religions, Islam, comes next. With once again multiple discussion in particular about the discrepancy between the Koran and Aristotle. We had early Judaism now we have later Judaism in particular Moses Maimonides.\n\nEurope in the Early Middle Ages is our next port of call. Mostly Aristotelian, most notably Augustine, but with exceptions most notably Lactantius, who would later feature in Copernicus’ De revolutionibus. Of interest here is Isidore of Seville (c.560-636) one of the most important encyclopaedists from late antiquity, who is in his writing more that ambiguous abut the shape of the Earth. Hannam argues fairly convincingly that, although he accepted Ptolemy’s astronomy and cosmology, he was a flat earther. However, Jürgen Hamel in his Die Vorstellung von der Kugelgestalt der Erde in europäischen Mittelalter bis zum Ende des 13. Jahrhunderts – dargestellt nach den Quellen,[5] (an excellent book if you can read German) agues equally convincingly that he wasn’t. I guess with Isidore, you pays your money and makes your choice.\n\nMoving on to the next chapter, High Medieval Views of the World: ‘The Earth has the shape of a globe’, we are well into the territory of those promoting the myth that people in the Middle Ages believed that the Earth was flat; a myth that Hannam proceeds to demolish with style. The money quote is:\n\nTake the coronation orb, which has been part of the regalia presented to kings and emperors from late antiquity. The orb represents the Earth, while the cross on top symbolises that the secular power was subject to the will of God. Presumably, if people in the Middle Ages had thought the Earth was flat, they would have presented their rulers with a diner plate instead.[6]\n\nWe move into the Early Modern Period with Columbus and Copernicus: ‘New worlds will be found,’ where Hannam also demolishes the myth that people thought Columbus would fall of the edge of the world and the equally stupid myth that Columbus proved that the world was round. We get a brief guest appearance of the world’s oldest surveying terrestrial globe, Martin Behaim’s Erdapfel (1492-94).\n\nColumbus is followed naturally by Magellan and the first circumnavigation. The chapter closes with a brief look at what Copernicus has to say about the shape of the Earth and also why he said it.\n\nChina’s tradition view of the Earth and its reaction to the idea that it is actually a globe is a difficult and complex story, stretching over two chapters, which Hannam manages to relate with his usually sureness and style.\n\nMoving into the modern period brief nods at the attempts to measure the size of the globe and the problems of determining longitude lead into the eighteenth-century dispute over the actual shape of the Earth, Newton & Huygens vs the Cassinis, oblate spheroid or prolate spheroid and the only part of Hannam’s entire narrative that I think is slapdash and shoddy. This is one of the most important episodes in the history of geodesy that also had ramifications for the theory of gravity and led to an indirect proof of diurnal rotation. It deserves more that Hannam’s sloppy two paragraph account.\n\nThis penultimate chapter contains two further sections, the first are brief accounts of explorers and missionaries bringing the news of the spherical shape of the Earth to communities that still hadn’t received it and how they reacted. The second is a brief account of the origins of modern Flat-Earth supporters in the nineteenth century. The final chapter continues with the flat earthers of the twentieth century. For theses two sections Hannam’s primary source is Christine Garwood’s excellent Flat Earth: The History of an Infamous Idea,[7] which I highly recommend if you are interested in the topic. The chapter proceeds with brief accounts of Draper-White conflict thesis and then moves on to the modern fantasy authors C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Terry Pratchett, who all knew better but still placed their fantasy novels in flat earth medieval settings.\n\nHannam’s book has extensive endnotes that mostly refer to the equally extensive bibliography. The book also has an extensive index. The book is richly illustrated but in the proof copy I was supplied with to write this review they are unfortunately very poor quality grey scale reproductions. I can only assume that they are better in the published version of the book.\n\nJames Hannam’s book is truly first class and should become a standard work on the topic. He covers a very wide range of material in a comparatively small number of pages. Each section of the book is relatively brief but concise, historically accurate, and highly informative. He writes extremely well, and his prose is clear and light to read. Anybody who takes the trouble to read this book will at the end know when, where and how the various populations of the Earth became aware that their home was on a large sphere floating through space.

For more general details on both the author and his book see the first post in this series.\n\nThe heading of today’s chapter is Brahe and Kepler, which immediately provokes a strange reaction in my brain. There is an unwritten convention in English that if one refers to Tycho Brahe by a single name then it is Tycho and not Brahe and by Johannes Kepler then it is Kepler not Johannes., so my brain says the chapter heading should be Tycho & Kepler. Why this is I have no idea and have often spent time wondering about it. Conventional use of names is a strange area that appears to defy logic. Galileo Galilei is almost always simply Galileo in English but in German he is Galilei, but I digress.\n\nWith this final chapter we are also scraping the barrel in terms of Strathern’s historical idiocies. It goes without saying that he pays far more attention to the long list of Tycho’s personal oddities than he does to his actual achievements in the history of astronomy. Quite often I couldn’t help getting the feeling that he actually just makes shit up. I have read an awful lot of literature on both of these astronomers, and I kept stumbling across statements that were not simply false but which I had never come across anywhere before. Let us begin. The opening paragraphs are pure purple prose of the worst sort and historically inaccurate:\n\nSometime during the 1590s, Richard Burbage and his players were invited by the King of Denmark to perform a lucrative summer season at the royal castle at Elsinore (Helsingør). Shakespeare was not amongst these players, but would later be regaled with tales of their foreign adventure. These would provide the background for the play he had in mind, whose full title would be Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.\n\nIt is at night on the battlements of Elsinore Castle that Hamlet encounters his father’s ghost, whose revelations sow the seeds of the ensuing tragedy. Coincidentally, some years earlier, while pacing these same battlements, the King of Denmark had suddenly seen the solution to a problem that was troubling him.\n\nKing Frederick II had taken under his wing an aristocratic young astronomer called Tycho Brahe, whose behaviour was as eccentric as his appearance: he wore a false metal nose and his awkward paranoid character inclined him to flamboyant cantankerous outbursts. [bullshit!] Brahe’s most recent astronomical observations had made him famous throughout Europe, and the king knew that Brahe was planning to leave Denmark. Brahe had received an offer to set up in Basel, one of the leading intellectual centres in Europe: home of the artistic Holbeins; where Paracelsus had briefly been professor; location of the skilled printer Oporinus to whom Vesalius had entrusted his masterwork. Looking out over the sea, Frederick II’s eye happened to alight on the remote island of Hven, in the middle of the Øresund (Sound) between Denmark and Sweden. Hven was royal territory, occupied only by a small village of fisherfolk and smallholders. If he offered Brahe this island, where the astronomer could build his own private residence, perhaps this would tempt him to remain in Denmark.\n\nAlthough I studied English literature, amongst other things, at university I’m not a Shakespeare expert. There is a vast amount of literature about the possible sources of Hamlet. However, it is possible that Shakespeare did take Elsinore, as the setting for his play, from visiting actors but not from Richard Burbage and not from the 1590s. When Kronburg, the royal castle in Helsingør, was inaugurated in 1585, three English actors–William Kemp, Thomas Pope, George Bryan–performed there. Later the three, together with Shakespeare established the acting company, The Lord Chamberlain’s Men.\n\nIn 1575, when the scene Strathern is describing took place, Frederick II, would not have been pacing those same battlements, as the Kronburg was still being constructed. The suggestion that Tycho should be given his own observatory came from the astronomer Wilhelm IV Landgraf von Hessen-Kassel (1532–1592), whom Strather never mentions, but should have, Wilhelm was related by marriage to Frederick. His sister was married to one of Frederick’s uncles. The suggestion to let Tycho use Hven probably came from Tycho’s uncle Steen Bille. Frederick had already offered Tycho the choice of a traditional fiefs and honours as was his due as a high-ranking aristocrat, but Tycho had demurred. Steen Bille made Frederick aware that Tycho did not want the responsibilities and duties that went with a conventional fief, as they would interfere with his astronomical work, it was then that Frederick made his offer with a rhetorical flourish.\n\n“…when he had been at Helsingør recently, checking on the construction of Kronborg Castle Frederick’s glance had happened to fall on the little island of Hven, on the southeast horizon. This he thought, was a perfect place for Tycho: isolated, unassociated with any administrative obligations, and unbound to any noble in fief. If the royal exchequer were tapped for the expenses of founding and maintaining a proper establishment, was there anything that Tycho hoped tom [sic] do abroad that he could not do here, where it would rebound to the credit of his country, his king and himself.”[1]\n\nStrathern further:\n\nBrahe had received an offer to set up in Basel, one of the leading intellectual centres in Europe: home of the artistic Holbeins; where Paracelsus had briefly been professor; location of the skilled printer Oporinus to whom Vesalius had entrusted his masterwork.\n\nAlthough Tycho was planning on moving to Basel he had received no such offer to do so. One has to ask if Strathern thought that Tycho wanted to go ghost hunting in Basel? Remember we now have 1575, Hans Holbein the Younger was last in Basel in 1532 and had in fact died in 1543, his elder brother Ambrosius had already died in 1519. Oporinus was somewhat closer to Tycho’s times dying in 1563, as for Paracelsus, the city of Basel would prefer not to remember his brief stay there, less than a year, and he had departed the planet in 1541!\n\nStrathern now heads off into his usual collection of fairy tales, avoiding facts in favour of sensation.\n\nTycho Brahe was amongst the more exotic characters to have contributed to the northern Renaissance. He came from a high-flying but dysfunctional noble family. His father, Otte, was the resident governor of a succession of royal castles (and may even have been a temporary governor of Elsinore). Tycho’s uncle Jørgen, who had inherited the considerable family fortune, was a royal counsellor, naval hero and hard-drinking pal of Frederick II.\n\nThe Brahe family was anything but dysfunctional and I have no idea where Strathern got this idea from. Otte’s career was more successful than Jørgen’s, he held a series of important fiefdoms and was indeed governor of Helsingborg Castle. There was no law of primogeniture in Denmark, so Jørgen did no inherit the considerable family fortune. As the only two children of Tyge Brahe and Sophie Rud, Otte and Jørgen both inherited, receiving equal shares. Otte became a Rigsraad (royal counsellor), Jørgen didn’t.\n\nWhen Jørgen discovered that he could not have children, he decided that he would select his own heir. In pursuance of this aim, he bullied his younger brother Otte into promising that he would present him with his firstborn son.\n\nOtte’s disappointment with this arrangement was allayed when his wife gave birth to twin boys. Unfortunately, the other twin died in infancy, and Uncle Jørgen turned up to collect Tycho when he was just two years old. (Some reports claim that Tycho was kidnapped.) Tycho’s father threatened to murder his older brother, but nothing came of this.\n\nTycho’s own account:\n\nHis uncle Jørgen “without the knowledge of my parents (took) me away with him while I was in my earliest youth [and] brought me up and thereafter supported me generously during his lifetime … and always treated me as his own son.”[2]\n\nThere is no record of Otte Brahe threatening to kill Jørgen. Jørgen’s justification seems to have been that he and his wife Inger Oxe couldn’t have children. He seems to have waited till Tycho’s younger brother, Steen, had passed the greatest uncertainties of infancy, before abducting Tycho.\n\nTycho’s childhood was passed in a succession of cold draughty castles on the Baltic coast, dining at long wooden tables crammed with innumerable relatives. At the head of the table sat the intimidating figure of Uncle Jørgen; topics of mealtime conversation were ‘warfare, politics and court gossip’.\n\nTycho’s childhood was no different to that of any aristocratic child growing up in sixteenth-century Denmark. The only difference to his biological family is that he was, in his foster family, an only child. Fostering was, for various reasons, not unusual amongst the Danish aristocratic families, so Tycho’s situation was not so strange.\n\nOtte wished his son to be educated in Latin, but Jørgen did not believe in such fripperies. Ten years before Tycho’s birth, in 1536, Denmark had broken definitively from the Roman Catholic Church and converted to Lutheranism. Despite this, Tycho received a traditional education in accord with the Aristotelian beliefs which still prevailed in Denmark.\n\nThe opening sentence of this paragraph is complete codswallop. Tycho’s education appears to have been managed by his foster mother Inger Oxe, an intelligent woman of intellectual interests and capabilities and above all her elder brother, Tycho’s foster uncle, Peder Oxe a man of great intellect, who spoke several languages fluently, and who, unusual for a Danish aristocrat, had spent five years studying at various European universities. From 1567, Tycho was just twenty-one, till his death in 1575, Peder Oxe was Lord High Steward of Denmark and the most powerful man in the country. He did much to facilitate Tycho’s career, pulling strings in the background to help his foster nephew. Peder Oxe does not feature at all in Strathern’s account of Tycho’s life, a serious omission.\n\nTycho attended grammar school, where he learnt Latin, from the age of seven to twelve when he then entered Copenhagen University as Strathern, for once, correctly notes. At grammar school he would have lived in the house of the bishop, and at university in the house of a professor. His interest in mathematics began at university.\n\nThe following year, the adolescent Tycho witnessed a partial eclipse of the sun. Although this eclipse arrived a day after it had been predicted, the very fact of its prediction was what most impressed Tycho. Here at last he had a glimpse of something certain in his life. He immediately began purchasing books on astronomy, including one by Regiomontanus, a map of the constellations drawn by Dürer and De Sphaera Mundi (The Sphere of the World) written by the thirteenth-century monastic scholar Johannes de Sacrobosco, which was regarded as the classic exposition of the Ptolemaic earth-centred astronomical system.\n\nHe bought the Sacrobosco, a very elementary text, in 1560. In 1561 he bought the much more advance Comographia of Peter Apian and Regiomontanus’ Trigonometry. He didn’t acquire the Dürer star map until 1562, when he was in Leipzig, where he also acquired several other astronomy and astrology texts.\n\nSubsequently, Uncle Jørgen despatched the fifteen-year-old Tycho on a tour of German universities, accompanied by a nineteen-year-old tutor who was instructed to cure him of this astronomy nonsense and make sure he equipped himself with the type of education expected of a court counsellor. Within months the young Tycho’s enthusiasm had convinced his tutor to disobey his instructions, and together the two of them embarked upon the study of astronomy at the safe distance of the University of Leipzig.\n\nNormally, at the age of fifteen, a young aristocrat would be sent to live on the court of another aristocrat to train as a page, the first step towards becoming part of the ruling classes. That Tycho instead was sent on a tour of European universities was certainly due to his foster mother and foster uncle and not his foster father. His tutor was Anders Sørensen Vedel. Although Tycho began to study astronomy seriously in Leipzig he was not joined in this endeavour by Vedel, who, did however, admit defeat in his attempts to get Tycho to concentrate on his university studies.\n\nHere [University of Leipzig] Brahe gained a thorough knowledge of both the Ptolemaic and the Copernican systems. Together, he and his tutor observed a close conjunction of the planets Jupiter and Saturn. Brahe was perplexed to discover that the tables drawn up using both the Ptolemaic system and the Copernican system contained minor inaccuracies in their predictions of the conjunction. This led him to start making astronomical observations of his own.\n\nTycho had begun making his own observation well before he observed the great conjunction and had already discovered the discrepancies in both the Ptolemaic and the Copernican tables.\n\nHe decided that the only way to create correct tables was to make meticulous personal observations, night after night, using the most accurate astronomical instruments available. (The telescope had yet to be invented.)\n\nThe only instrument that Tycho had available, at that time, was a cross-staff, that he had purchased, and which proved to be not particularly accurate.\n\nTycho returned to Denmark in 1565 at the age of eighteen.\n\n[…]\n\nJørgen heroically dived into the canal and rescued the king, but unfortunately died some days later of pneumoni"
