His wife Cecilia ( née Ambrose ) he had married in 1771.\n\nHe undertook several scientific trips to France, England and Norway in order to expand his knowledge, especially of Entomology. So he came in 1767 for the first time to London, where he was able to use the collections of William Hunter for original descriptions of many insects, which he published in his work Systema entomologiae. Thus, the on Hunter insect collection contains around 400 holotypes, of which the majority of Fabricius has been described. However, some species could be by his friend, the French entomologist Guillaume Antoine Olivier (1756-1814) describes the visited London in 1789 and on the recommendation of Fabricius also examined the collections Hunters.\n\nFabricius was one of the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina since 1794.\n\nQuotes\n\n\"With the complete eradication of weeds a good farmer must make the first start to improving its Feldbaues, because otherwise the greater part of all the other work is in vain. \"\n\nWritings"
