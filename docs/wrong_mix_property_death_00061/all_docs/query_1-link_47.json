        "text": "Eudicella\n\nEudicella, a genus in the scarab beetle family, is part of a group known as flower beetles. This specimen was collected in what used to be known as the Gold Coast region of West Africa.\n\nNeospades cruciatus\n\nThis Australian beetle species was described by the Danish zoologist Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775, and was named Buprestis cruciata, but it is currently known as Neospades cruciatus in the Buprestidae family of metallic, wood-boring beetles.\n\nThis specimen is a holotype — a single specimen forming the basis for a species name Natural History Museum's historical Sir Joseph Banks entomological collection. This 300-year-old collection includes approximately 4,000 insects, among which are butterflies, flies, bugs, beetles and moths.\n\nUnidentified Bolivian Cerambycidae\n\nThis unidentified species belongs to the beetle family Cerambycidae, also commonly known as longhorns, longicorns, capricorns, round-headed borers, timber beetles and sawyer beetles, according to the insect identification website Bug Guide.\n\nIt was collected in 2004 by British entomologist Max Barclay, curator and collections manager of Coleoptera and Hemiptera at the Natural History Museum in London. Barclay found the specimen in Bolivia, in Amboro National Park, at an elevation of around 3,281 feet (1,000 meters).\n\nNeptunides polychrous marginipennis\n\nNeptunides polychrous marginipennis is a flower beetle — a colorful flower-feeding group within the scarab beetle family — that is distributed across eastern Africa. This individual originated in Tanzania, in the Udzungwa Mountains, and the species was described in 1904 by Austrian entomologist Josef Moser.\n\nOxysternon conspicillatum\n\nBeetles in the Oxysternon genus, which contains around 11 species, are typically green and very shiny. The neotropical species Oxysternon conspicillatum was described in 1804 by the German entomologist Friedrich Weber, and is found in Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia and Panama.\n\nPseudotorynorrhina fortunei\n\nThe beetle species Pseudotorynorrhina fortunei is a type of scarab beetle found in Vietnam. It is in the subfamily Cetoniinae, also known as fruit and flower chafers, according to the insect identifying website Bug Guide.\n\nEnglish entomologist Edward Saunders described the species in 1852.\n\nTaeniotes orbignyi\n\nDescribed in 1844 by the French entomologist Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville, Taeniotes orbignyi belongs to a genus of longhorn beetles. This individual was collected in 2004 by British entomologist Max Barclay, curator and collections manager of Coleoptera and Hemiptera at the Natural History Museum in London. Barclay found the specimen in Bolivia's Amboro National Park, at an elevation of 3,281 feet (1,000 meters).\n\nPterodunga mirabilis\n\nColorful Pterodunga mirabilis was discovered in Queensland, Australia in 2000 by Italian entomologist Mauro Daccordi. It is a type of leaf beetle in the subfamily Chrysomelinae, which includes about 2,000 species distributed around the world.\n\nRhamphorrhina bertolonii\n\nThis Rhamphorrhina bertolonii specimen was collected in Tanzania's Nguru Mountains. The species was described in 1879 by the English entomologist William John Lucas.\n\nScaphidomorphus bosci"
