        "text": "A bursary named after a civil rights activist has been launched to help students from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds.\n\nThe University of the West of England (UWE) said the new Paul Stephenson bursary would give five students Â£2,000 each \"to help with their living costs\".\n\nMr Stephenson, now 83, led the 1960s Bristol bus boycott, which saw a ban on employing non-white drivers revoked.\n\nFumi Stephenson said her father was \"honoured\" the bursary was in his name.\n\n\"Dad was a teacher first and always advocated for education and specifically a decolonisation of knowledge which informs and unites people. The last thing he would ever want is division,\" she said.\n\nMs Stephenson said her father went to university in Birmingham in the 1950s, and one of his first jobs was in teaching.\n\n\"He always promoted the importance of education in and outside the house.\"\n\nMr Stephenson held senior appointments on the Press Council, the Sports Council and the Commission of Racial Equality after the bus boycott.\n\nHe has spoken at the UN and collaborated with Muhammad Ali on sports projects.\n\nFaculty academic director Myra Evans said UWE had been \"working for some time\" with the Stephenson family to set up the bursary.\n\nMs Evans said: \"Paul has long valued education as a vehicle for positively changing practices and perceptions in society.\n\n\"While the decision to launch the bursary was not influenced by recent events, the Black Lives Matter movement has made the bursary more relevant and highlights the need to promote inclusivity across all parts of society.\"\n\nMs Stephenson said BAME graduates \"can bridge cohesion and be positive role models in the future\"."
