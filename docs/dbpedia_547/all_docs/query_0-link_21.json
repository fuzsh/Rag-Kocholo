        "text": "Behind the scenes, the straight-talking deputy commissioner was quietly holding the Metropolitan police together.\n\nWhen a race row between Sir Ian and assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur played itself out in public, it was Sir Paul who gave a blunt statement calling for everyone to \"shut up\" and get on with their job.\n\nHis name was only linked to one of Sir Ian's gaffes - and that was when Sir Paul effectively shamed the Commissioner into refusing a £25,000 performance bonus by waiving his own bonus in October 2007. Sir Ian wrote him an angry letter effectively accusing him of disloyalty but SIr Paul had the high moral ground in saying that it would be inapproproate to accept the money during a criminal trial into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes.\n\nHe will be well aware of the pitfalls of Britain's top policing job and within hours of becoming acting Commissioner in December he was engulfed in the Damian Green affair, having sanctioned the arrest of the Tory MP.\n\nThe 55-year-old is likely to avoid the limelight, and may be exactly the kind of person that the mayor's team wanted when they asked for a \"numbers man\" leader capable of a big management job, running one of the largest organisations in Europe.\n\n\"I think really good senior police officers are those who are focused on results rather than their own PR. That's what London needs,\" said Kit Malthouse, the mayor's policing advisor.\n\nSir Paul was brought up in the Lancashire town of Bacup and once wanted to become a shoe salesman.\n\nBut when his older brother joined the local police force he decided to join him.\n\nSir Paul is said to have placed a desire to serve the public at the core of his beliefs, a lesson he learnt from the manager of a large supermarket near his home.\n\nWhen he became chief constable there in Lancashire in July 2002 he visited the store and asked the manager what made it work.\n\n\"Keeping the queues down and the customers happy,\" he was told. Sir Paul has made that his mantra – serving the customer, the public.\n\nAfter serving as the Lancashire chief for three years he was considering leaving policing when the job of deputy commissioner under Sir Ian came up.\n\nHe is well liked at the highest levels, but will need to work hard to win over the rank-and-file who will associate him with the previous commissioner.\n\nOne senior officer said: \"The main thing is that Paul does not have an ego, and nor is he a limpet who refuses to release his grasp from power. When the Damian Green affair kicked off he said that if was felt to be his fault, he would be the first to take the flak and go.\""
