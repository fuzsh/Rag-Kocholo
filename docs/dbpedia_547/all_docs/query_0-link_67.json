        "text": "Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick has resigned following criticism for jeopardising security surrounding an anti-terror operation.\n\nBy Gemma Ilston\n\nAssistant Commissioner Bob Quick has resigned following criticism for jeopardising security surrounding an anti-terror operation.\n\nThe details of secret papers regarding an anti-terror raid were inadvertently exposed by Mr Quick as he entered 10 Downing Street to for a briefing.\n\nThe details were captured by media photographers there at the time resulting in the operation being brought forward.\n\nMr Quick handed in his resignation this morning, April 9, and Mayor of London and Chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority, Boris Johnson, said he had accepted it with great sadness.\n\nHe added that there had been no effort to remove him from the service, but both the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats had made strong criticisms against him for reveling the confidential information.\n\nShadow Home Affairs Secretary Chris Grayling said:\n\n“This is an extraordinary and very alarming lapse. It`s the kind of error that Britain`s most senior anti-terrorist officer simply can`t afford to make, and it will lead to serious questions about his judgement and about his ability to do his job properly.”\n\nThe documents photographed named several senior officers, locations and further details of the nature of overseas threats.\n\nIt has been confirmed that Assistant Commissioner John Yates will replace Mr Quick as head of counter-terrorism.\n\nMr Quick said: “Last evening [April 8] I contacted the Metropolitan Police Authority to inform them of my intention to offer my resignation.\n\n“I have today [April 9] offered my resignation in the knowledge that my action could have compromised a major counter terrorism operation.\n\n“I deeply regret the disruption caused to colleagues undertaking the operation and remain grateful for the way in which they adapted quickly and professionally to a revised timescale.”\n\nCommissioner Sir Paul Stephenson, said: “Bob Quick is a tremendous police officer who has served with dedication and professionalism throughout his career.\n\n“I hold Bob in the highest regard, as a friend and colleague, and that opinion has not changed. He has accepted that he made a serious error and that has led to his resignation this morning.\n\n“I would like to thank Bob for the excellent job he has done leading the national response to the terrorist threat and the way in which he has led the Counter Terrorist Command in London.\n\n“It is important in such a critical policing role to announce Bob`s successor. I have today appointed Assistant Commissioner John Yates as head of Specialist Operations.”\n\nAssociation of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) President, Sir Ken Jones, spoke well of Mr Quick:\n\nIn a short space of time Bob Quick has made a significant contribution to developing the UKs counter terrorism capability. Those charged with the leadership of counter terror operations shoulder, on our behalf, immense responsibilities, from which Bob Quick has not shirked. The ACPO Counter Terrorism Network goes from strength to strength as does the Metropolitan Counter Terror Command. He has orchestrated and led a number of critical counter terror operations over the past year or so and we are all the safer for that. Bob Quick has an equally impressive record of delivery and achievement in general policing over many years. Chief Officers will want to wish him well in whatever he now chooses to do, he said.\n\nAdding; The threat we face from terrorism remains high and the business of protecting the public continues unabated. The counter terror capability we have built in London and across the UK is resilient in its leadership. Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson has today appointed Assistant Commissioner John Yates to take over from Bob Quick. We fully support Sir Paul in his decision. John Yates brings much to the role. He has extensive investigative experience won over many years in operational policing and, as a senior chief officer in the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and ACPO, is no stranger to the counter terror challenge"
