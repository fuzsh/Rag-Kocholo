        "text": "A petition has been launched calling for a statue of Bristol hero Paul Stephenson OBE to be put up in place of Edward Colston's.\n\nDuring dramatic events this afternoon (Sunday), protesters pulled down the slave trader's statue and then dumped it in the Floating Harbour.\n\nThe action unfolded at the end of a Black Lives Matter protest, which had more than 10,000 attending.\n\nOrganisers distanced themselves from the incident, saying it had 'nothing to do with them'. They plan to issue a fuller statement tomorrow.\n\nPolice have now launched an investigation into criminal damage. Detectives said they would be using footage from the incident and working in partnership with Bristol City Council.\n\nAnd just hours after the infamous bronze figure was pulled down with ropes, a new petition on Change.org has been launched calling on authorities to erect a new statue, but this time of Mr Stephenson.\n\nCreated by Edward Beeston, the petition reads : \"Following the statue of Edward Colston being thrown into the harbour, it is time a suitable replacement is found that honours black Bristolians.\n\n\"I believe that one candidate for his replacement would be Paul Stephenson. He led the 1963 Bristol Bus Boycott, started because Bristol Post announced in 1961 that black workers were refused work despite a worker shortage due to a resolution from the Transport and General Workers' Union. The Boycott influenced the creation of the Race Relations Act.\n\n\"It is time Bristol moves forward with its history in the slave trade, acknowledging the evil committed and how it can educate its citizens about black history.\"\n\nAround a dozen people have signed the campaign so far.\n\nWho was Paul Stephenson?\n\nHe was a famous community worker, activist and long-time campaigner for civil rights.\n\nAs a young social worker, in 1963, Stephenson led a boycott of the Bristol Omnibus Company, protesting against its refusal to employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors.\n\nAfter a 60-day boycott supported by thousands of Bristolians, the company revoked its colour bar in August.\n\nIn 1964 Stephenson achieved national fame when he refused to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a trial on a charge of failing to leave a licensed premises."
