There is a call-out to the New Zealand advertising community to help Paul’s family and raise funds following this tragic loss.\n\nPaul was one of those people you meet once and never forgot. Paul was one of those dudes who you respected, admired and truly loved. The world has lost him way too early. If you can do anything to help raise funds for his family who have lost a lot this week you’ll be doing a solid for him and proving this industry is generous to each other.\n\nPaul worked for years at Lowe Advertising and then was the producer at Auckland animation company Kaleidoscope for 14 years. He was a well-respected and much loved dude from the industry."
