        "text": "Early Years\n\nThis is Paul's Life through a few pictures.\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS, 1933 and about 1939 to 1945.\n\nThe pictures above cannot be dated precisely, but they are in the range of 1939 to 1945, except for the 1933 pictures of Faye, Donald and me. The pictures bring to mind some memories. The BB guns were from Santa in about 1941 but we talked Mama into letting us have them early. We usually rode the mules to the house at lunch and at dusk. I'm not sure whether the mule is \"Old Joe\" or \"Old Kate\". The army belt that I have on in one picture was given to me by Thomas. Donald and I supposedly shared many things, including the horse. Be sure that Donald, being two years older than me, always tried to dominate. See who is on the horse! The above pictures appear to have been made at about the same time, since I have the same shirt on in each picture. Terry was born in 1940 and he appears to be six or seven or eight. I'm not sure when we first got the tractor, but I know it was the late 40's. Daddy rigged up a method where we could plant two rows of cotton at a time. I was not very impressed with it but it did get the job done. Donald always drove the tractor and we walked.\n\nThere are few pictures for the period 1949 to December 1952. The first picture was in 1950 and the other one was my graduation picture (May 9, 1952). Immediately after graduation I went to Louisville and lived with Lorene while working for Caldwell Tank Co. I returned to Rutherford on July 1st and began working for the Rutherford Garment Co. I worked in the shipping room (where Uncle Scott Workman worked) until entering the University Of Tennessee Martin Branch for the Fall Quarter, 1952. I did well at UTMB but didn't have the funds to continue. I was sworn into the Air Force on December 26, 1952 and boarded a train for San Antonio on December 27th.\n\nThe Air Force Years\n\nDec 26, 1952 - Sept 26, 1956\n\nPaul at Lackland Air Force Base, December 27, 1952 to March 17, 1953.\n\nMom, Terry, and Paul visiting Tom in Texas, 1953. I hitch-hiked from San Antonio to Mineral Wells and back. I'm not sure how Mom and Terry got there from Rutherford.\n\nIn the PX lounge with friends. I took the city picture (the White House) from atop the Washington Monument.\n\nPaul with friends in Washington, D.C.,November 1953 to September 1956.\n\nOn leave from the Air Force in Rutherford around 1955.\n\nThe College Years\n\nI attended The University of Tennessee at Martin in 1956-57 then transferred to UT Knoxville in the Fall of 1957. The UT ID card is above.\n\nAt Geneva's Oak Ridge home, 1969\n\nPaul & Greg, Hattisburg, Mar 1961.\n\nGreg in front of our Emory Court cottage, Feb. 1962.\n\nPaul, Anita, Greg at Moms, 1962.\n\nPassport picture 1964\n\nPaul and Thomas about 1964.\n\nPaul's Family, Bull Shoals, 1971.\n\nPaul at Natchez Trace, 1972.\n\nPaul in TTU office, 1975.\n\nPaul at Chicasaw State Park, 1982.\n\nGreg's wedding, October 12, 1985\n\nPaul with Brandon & Ashlyn 1994 at Greg's & 1995 at Chattanooga Aquarium\n\nPaul receiving Tennessee Political Science Association Award, 1996\n\nPaul retired from Tennessee Technological University on May 9, 1998 after 34 years of service. The top picture shows all of my family except Tim's family. The second picture shows Janet Rogers, my long time secretary.\n\nThe Stripe was caught in Lake Lanier (Georgia) on Feb 5, 1999 and the limit of walleye was caught in Center Hill Lake on June 4, 1999.\n\nPaul with the recipients of the Dr. Paul G. Stephenson Scholarship, which is awarded annually to the Political Science Junior who has earned the highest grade average.\n\nPaul at Reelfoot Lake and on the bank of the Mississippi River, Jan. 5, 2000\n\nPaul with five sisters at Faye's, March 2000\n\n[History] [Letters] [Vacations] [Cruises/Trips] [Photographs] [Inmemoriam] [Email] [Farm] [Home]\n\n[Jim] [Hessie] [Thomas] [Modine] [Lorene] [Faye] [Donald] [Paul] [Bettie] [Mattie] [Johnie] [Terry] [Genealogy]\n\nNote--- For Information or Questions ---Send Email to:--- Stephenson"
