        "text": "Frances Stephenson joined the University of Colorado speed, strength and conditioning staff in November of 2021 to work with the lacrosse, tennis and track & field/cross country teams, bringing with her an abundance of experience at the collegiate and professional levels.\n\nPrior to coming to CU, Stephenson served as the Director of Sports Performance at Prairie View A&M University. There she was responsible for overseeing all aspects of the Sports Performance Department including strength & conditioning as well as nutrition. She coached and directly led football, men and women’s basketball and was involved with all other Olympic sports. Stephenson managed upgrades and additions to the weight room facilities and implemented a structured programming system with each sport on campus that allowed for reductions in injury rates compared to previous seasons as well as overall development throughout the department. She established an outreach program and oversaw the recruitment of young professionals in the field to participate each semester.\n\nBefore PVAMU, she served as the Director of Olympic Sports Performance at Northern Illinois University and was the Director of Player Development at North Carolina A&T State University.\n\nFor two seasons, Stephenson worked as the Head Football Strength and Conditioning Coach for the Schwäbisch Hall Unicorns, a professional football team in the German Football League (GFL). During her time with the Unicorns, she helped the program earn two consecutive National German Bowl Championships. Stephenson also worked closely with the first European player (Moritz Böhringer) to be selected in the NFL Draft without playing any college football.\n\nPrior to her work within the GFL, she spent time at New Mexico State University and California State University, Northridge. She has also previously coached at University of Southern California and Pierce College with a variety of sports ranging from Football to Olympic teams.\n\nStephenson graduated from Cal State Northridge with a BS in exercise physiology and also earned her MS from CSUN in bio mechanics. A native of Los Angeles, Stephenson lettered in soccer in high school and went on to play at CSUN."
