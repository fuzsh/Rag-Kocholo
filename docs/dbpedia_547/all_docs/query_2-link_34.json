I intended to add a lot to it before putting it on the family page. But time moves on and now I think I should make it available. I still have the intention of completing it soon.]\n\nSome Early Memories\n\nI was born on November 3, 1932 in the family farmhouse three miles east of Rutherford. My birth certificate signed by J. W. Allen, M.D. records my full name as Paul Stephenson with no middle name nor initial. However, I was called Paul Glenn by Mama and others, but I never knew how it was supposed to be spelled. I had to sign my full name when I registered for the draft and I signed it as Paul Glynn Stephenson. Later I decided that it had to be Glenn, for some reason, but I have always simply used the middle initial \"G\" as part of my legal signature. I was the sixth child of James Monroe Stephenson and Hessie Ann Dabbs-Stephenson, who went on to have four more children for a total of ten, four boys and six girls. Memories of my early years, before school, are few indeed and those that exist are rather vague.\n\nI do remember once when I was about four Daddy picked me up to spank me, held me close to his chest facing him, and as he began to whack my bottom I lost control and wet on him. He abruptly put me down. That was the one and only time that daddy spanked me, but he did hit me on the head with a Western Magazine when I was around ten or eleven (I was making noise near where he was reading), and he threw a glass of tea in my face once; I do not remember why he did that, but I was hurt because I didn't think I deserved that kind of treatment. His punishment was more likely to be a tongue lashing and that did happen more than once. He seemed to be content to let Mama hand out the whippings.\n\nI also remember a serious whipping he gave Donald, and that one was partially my fault. Donald and I often scuffled; we seldom had serious fights. Once Donald pushed pretty hard and I fell and hit my head on something on the ground. It knocked the breath out of me and Daddy saw me gasping for breath. Without any investigation or hesitation, he jumped on Donald and whipped him terribly hard. I remember exaggerating my hurt by crying at first and then later wishing that I could have hid my gasping from Daddy so that Donald wouldn't have gotten such a whipping. I do not remember Daddy ever whipping any of the other kids, although I know he felt like whipping Faye sometimes. Faye was pretty headstrong and she would tell Daddy what she thought.\n\nMammy's Death\n\nMama's mother, Georgie Idella Dabbs (Della, Mammy) died in 1939 when I was seven. My stored image of her is of a frail, old lady, who dipped snuff. She once made me put back a pocket knife that I wanted to play with. The only other real recollection of her is one of walking across the fields to Aunt Geleka's to see her dead. She died at Aunt Geleka's and the body was kept there until it was taken to the Salem Church and cemetery for services, which we kids were not permitted to attend. After we viewed Mammy, Daddy and Mama escorted us into the yard and sent us home with our older sisters. I remember, as we left, seeing Daddy and Mama, with Mama crying, walking off toward a wooded area.\n\nSchool\n\nI started to school in the first grade in the Fall of 1939 without benefit of kindergarten or similar programs. I do not recall that we had any children's books at home. I'm sure that some of my older siblings taught me some things, but I remember that I did not know the ABC's when I started. Details are very vague, but I know that I was sick a lot during that Fall and was not permitted to return to school after Christmas, so I failed the first grade. My schooling then began in the Fall of 1940 in Miss Kate Edmundson's room; Miss Kate taught all ten of the Stephenson children. In fact, most of us shared many of the teachers at Rutherford Elementary and Rutherford High: Kate Edmundson, Gladys Peel, Jolyn Drane, Ruth Lassiter, Ruth McCain, Polly White, David Fairless, and Dan Spenser are the ones that come to mind.\n\nMiss Kate was a patient, understanding teacher. I didn't like Gladys Peel much. I remember Miss Drane as a strict disciplinarian but still a good teacher. Ruth Lassiter was a good teacher; I always felt at ease with her. I was really impressed with Ruth McCain, our junior-high history teacher. She was well educated, had traveled and was a sophisticated lady who made the material interesting. I will mention Polly White in more detail below. David Fairless was our competent and easy-going agriculture teacher, and Dan Spenser taught me a skill, typing, that I still use almost every day.\n\nI don't recall that I much enjoyed those first years. Isolated things come to mind. I enjoyed the raisins and prunes that the teachers handed out as snacks every afternoon. These were supplied by some Federal school program. I enjoyed recess and the marble games. I didn't much like the food served in the cafeteria after it was started. In the early years, we took our lunch in a brown bag; usually it consisted of a biscuit and some kind of meat such as ham or sausage. We also took our lunch some even after they started serving a hot lunch at school. Lunch was a hard thing for Mama; she had to cook breakfast and prepare a lunch for several kids each school morning.\n\nBoth Thomas and Donald quit school after about the eighth or ninth grade. The other eight all finished high school. Once I decided to quit and left school at noon, walked home, and told Mama that I was through with school. She in no uncertain terms made it clear that I was not quitting; the threat of a severe whipping was quite certain. I really didn't want to quit anyway.\n\nHowever, I did have some unpleasant experiences with some of our incompetent teachers. Polly White was probably a good person, but she was a physical education major who was called upon to teach English and Science as well and she was not qualified to do that.\n\nIn English she once had a poetry contest. I wrote my poem about a dog; I worked my tail off on it for several days and turned it in. In a week or so she announced to the class that: \"Paul has the best poem, but I don't believe he wrote it, so Julia Beaumont wins the contest.\" I don't think I need to comment on what that did to me.\n\nWhile I am on Polly's case, let me explain a science problem we had regarding speeds. I made a point in class about the fact that the outside of the earth was traveling faster than the inside as the earth revolves. She said no, it couldn't, because it was connected. I said that didn't matter, that a point on the outside traveled farther than a point inside, in the same amount of time, so the outside point must be going faster. She said no, I was wrong. There was a turntable from an old record player in the room, so I put a peanut near the outside of the record and one toward the middle and spun it to demonstrate that the outside peanut was going faster. She refused to watch. I got so mad I went to see the Principal, Mr. Kenny, and told him Miss White didn't know what she was talking about. He took up for the teacher in a rather vigorous way.\n\nNow I didn't expect my teachers to know everything, but I did expect them to be able to admit that they could be wrong. Unfortunately, most teachers are not big enough to do that, even those at the college level. In the main I liked Polly White in spite of the unpleasant episodes mentioned above.\n\nHigh school was a good time for me. I remember fondly the friendships and camaraderie of some of the guys, especially Allen Mallard, Steven O'Daniel, Joe Pate, Billy Workman, James Oliver, and George Rasberry. I also remember having crushes on some of the gals, especially Julia Beaumont, Martha Lynn Roaden, Mary Alice Wylie, June Ward, and Polly Anderson.\n\nI never studied much in school, at least not the things my teachers wanted me to study. I read nearly all the interesting books in our little library and the school got a daily paper out of Memphis and a few magazines that I enjoyed. I studied enough to become a member of the Beta Club, but not enough to be near the top of my class. I finally did graduate on May 9, 1952. I just noticed in my hand writing on the title page of the 1952 class annual \"The Pirate\" a long forgotten little poem I must have penned in 1952 upon graduation:\n\nToday I think about the past days About the things I have done Of the class and its friendly ways And all the happiness I have won\n\nSo it seems in retrospect that high school wasn't so bad in spite of a few unpleasant experiences. It certainly did not seem that I had prepared for college, graduate school, and a career in teaching. In fact, one of the gals at our 1990 class reunion said that I was the last person she expected to go to college. To my knowledge only two of us graduated from college; Steven O'Daniel graduated from UT Martin and I graduated from UT Knoxville with B.S. and M.A. Degrees and from Emory University with a Ph.D. Degree.\n\nHUNTING\n\nI never went quail hunting with Daddy. I heard stories about some of his bird dogs (Old Frank, especially), and what a good shot he was. I do remember having quail to eat a few times. When I was about fourteen, I decided to go quail hunting by myself. I was using a bolt-action 12-gauge shotgun. I think it was one that Daddy gave Donald. There was a cover of snow on the ground. I, of course, had no dog and you can't kill quail without a dog, supposedly. But I found a covey on the ground and killed three. When I brought them in to the house, Daddy was incredulous. He just couldn't believe it. But they were real enough to eat.\n\nTRAPPING\n\nThomas and Daddy trapped rabbits for meat and other animals for fur. During the winters of 1940 and 1941 especially, Daddy and Thomas caught dozens and dozens, maybe hundreds, of rabbits. They had traps everywhere; they made them out of small hollow logs and rough planks. We ate some of the rabbits, but most of them were gutted and hung in the smoke house to freeze dry or cure somehow. I remember rows of them hanging head up; each one had its front legs crossed, a vision that became associated with death in my mind. They would eventually pack the whole rabbits in crates or burlap bags to be shipped to a wholesaler in Chicago. I never understood who could eat them, but I now suppose some ethnic group in Chicago liked them cured that way. Thomas told me (January, 1998) that the rabbit trapping was his project and that he got $1.00 each for the them. He also said that they sometimes shipped \"possums\" the same way and got $2.00 for them.\n\nThe main fur animals were mink, muskrat, and raccoon. I was told that Daddy made from trapping mink most of the $300 he paid for his first new T-Model Ford. I'm sure most of the winter income came from trapping. When I was about eleven I went with Daddy one day to run his trap line. It was an overcast winter day. We must have walked twenty miles, for we were walking from one trap to another most of the day. That day, as I recall, not one single animal was caught, but Daddy did show me how to set the traps and hide them. I certainly came to understand that trapping was not all fun. Although we didn't catch any that day, Daddy definitely was an expert trapper.\n\nFROGGING\n\nThe whole family liked frog legs. Donald and I became quite good at gigging them. Soon we substituted a 22 caliber rifle for the gig, because, well, I guess because we would rather shoot than jab. We walked to various ponds in the area besides our own. We had a single-shot breech action 22 that had to have the hammer cocked in order to shoot. Cocking the hammer made noise, which scared the frogs. One night we were walking up over the hill to our pond and Donald got the gun ready by cocking the hammer in advance. He stumbled and the rifle fired. The bullet grazed my ear. It scared the heck out of me and I got on his case pretty hard and he said, \"a miss is as good as a mile.\" If his statement was meant to make me feel better, it failed miserably. Now is it any wonder that we had a few fights. Anyway during the 1940's we bagged a lot of frogs and generally had fun doing it.\n\nFISHING\n\nIn retrospect, and in light of the fishing that I now do, I know that Daddy was good at only one kind of fishing: baited traps for catfish. The traps were made of chicken wire with a funnel entrance and baited usually with pressed cotton-seed meal. It is easy to remember the few times when the traps would be half full of small catfish (frying whole size). We went cane-pole fishing too, but we never caught any to speak of, except in the traps. We fished mainly for blue gill, bass, crappie, and catfish. We went to nearby ponds and rivers and once or twice to Kentucky Lake and Reelfoot Lake. We didn't have a boat of any kind. Since we all liked fish so well, why didn't we get at least the minimal equipment and learn how to catch them? Most of the fish that we ate were bought catfish and buffalo.\n\nWe did have some interesting fishing trips though. I will describe two that made a lasting impression on me. One of the trips was when I was about twelve (1944). I remember that Daddy, Joe Patterson, Walter Patterson, Donald, and I (there were others, but I can't remember who they were) went on a fishing trip that involved camping and fishing. We did have catfish to cook that night, so I feel sure that some \"hogging\" or seining was done by some of the men. What makes this trip so memorable to me was that I nearly committed negligent homicide. Some strange kid came into our camp and made himself at home. We talked and played some. I decided to go hunting with that breech action 22 caliber rifle that nearly got my ear. It was unloaded, because I didn't trust that gun. The strange kid tagged along. For some reason, I decided that I didn't want him around and told him to go home. He just stood there. So I thought I would scare him by pointing the rifle at his head, knowing that it was not loaded. He still stood there. I cocked the hammer to scare him more, and I almost pulled the trigger to make it pop. Fate, God, Fortune, Luck or some thing made me pull the gun aside toward a log as I pulled the trigger. The \"unloaded\" rifle fired!!! Words can hardly describe my bewilderment, my fear, and then my thankfulness that the kid was safe.\n\nThe other fishing trip that I will never forget took place when I was about ten or eleven. Daddy, a Mr. Glasscock (one of Daddy's drinking and gambling buddies), Donald and I planned a trip to Mr. Glasscock's cabin which was situated on the bank of the Obion River. This was before the Corps of Engineers drained the obion bottoms, so we had to take a boat to get to the cabin. We had planned to go early in the day but didn't leave Rutherford until after dark because Daddy and Mr. Glasscock were drinking beer all day and the time got away. Finally we drove to the landing and by flashlight we loaded our supplies and food into a little boat and started through the backwaters to the cabin. About half way there one or the other of the drunken men capsized the boat getting us and our food supplies wet. To say the least I was pissed. But we finally got to the cabin and got somewhat dry. The next day we caught enough fish to cook, although we didn't have any dry bread to eat with it. Mr. Glasscock sliced some onion, gave me some and said, \"hell, boy, you can't eat fish without onion.\" I tried it and have pretty much served onion with fish ever since.\n\nFAMILY FURNITURE\n\nI have three pieces of furniture from Mama's house: the white stool, the kitchen table and chairs, and Daddy's little walnut desk.\n\nMama's white stool has a long and interesting history. Johnie sat on it to eat during the 1940's. It was used as a stand for the meat grinder periodically (hand-cranked sausage grinder); it still has the screw marks under the seat. Many children have used it as a high chair. It currently sits in my combination study and bedroom in my basement apartment at the round house. Every morning that I stay there, I make a cup of coffee and use the white stool as a little table. It is just the right height beside my recliner. It has many coats of white paint, some chipping and cracking. I have considered stripping and re-painting it a couple of times, but then I think I should leave it as it is, at least for a while longer. It is still a sturdy oak stool; it will last.\n\nI know that Donald brought the dining-room set in his truck when I built the little cabin (24x24) on my pond, but I'm not sure how I got the white stool. The dining room table now is in the little kitchen in my basement apartment. I don't know what kind of wood it is; it was not a real expensive set. But it sure was used to serve a lot of good meals at Mama's!\n\nFaye gave me Daddy's desk, or small table, with a drawer. She had J.C. Matthews refinish it (probably in the mid-80's). It is her wish that the desk be passed on in the Stephenson line to Gregory and then to Brandon and so on, hopefully. The desk now stands beside my recliner and is used for pictures and a reading lamp. I don't know when Daddy got it, but it was early. I seem to remember Mama saying this was one thing Jim had when they got married. I remember where it stood from the time of the house addition until Mama moved. It held the radio, a reading lamp, and the drawer was Daddy's filing cabinet for okra shipping records. Prior to getting electricity in 1945, the radio was battery operated. The desk still is in good condition and it has a beautiful finish.\n\n[History] [Letters] [Vacations] [Cruises/Trips] [Photographs] [Inmemoriam] [Email] [Farm] [Home]\n\n[Jim] [Hessie] [Thomas] [Modine] [Lorene] [Faye] [Donald] [Paul] [Bettie] [Mattie] [Johnie] [Terry] [Genealogy]"
