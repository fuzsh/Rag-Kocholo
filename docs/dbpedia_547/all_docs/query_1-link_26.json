        "text": "About the bursary\n\nThe Paul Stephenson Bursary is an award of Â£2,000 a year designed to widen participation in higher education and help people to succeed in furthering their ambitions within the Education and Childhood sector.\n\nTwo bursaries will be available to students from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.\n\nPaul Stephenson, OBE, is a community worker, activist and long-time campaigner for civil rights for the British African Caribbean community. He lives in Bristol and in 1963 led a boycott of the Bristol Omnibus Company protesting against its refusal to employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors. After a 60 day boycott, the company revoked its colour bar ban.\n\nIn return for this money we ask students to participate in a widening participation event in the School of Education and Childhood to help us continue our EDI (Equality, diversity and inclusion) work.\n\nEligibility and how to apply\n\nThe scheme is designed for new undergraduate applicants to the School of Education and Childhood starting in September 2024.\n\nApplicants must hold an offer for a course in The School of Education and Childhood and identify as being from a Black, Asian and minority ethnic background.\n\nApplications are now closed.\n\nFor further information about this bursary and how to apply, please contact Myra.evans@uwe.ac.uk."
