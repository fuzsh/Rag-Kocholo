        "text": "Cyril's letter to Constantius II on the Jerusalem cross-apparition of 351 has usually been read as a declaration of Cyril's loyalty during Constantius' war with Magnentius. However, the letter also includes a discussion that links the cross to the eschatological \" sign of the Son of Man \" (Matthew 24:30). Modern interpreters have either ignored this eschatological section or assumed that it is aimed at a non-imperial audience. This paper advances a unified reading of the letter that shows how Cyril uses explicit verbal cues and his description of the cross's appearance and position over the sacred landscape of Jerusalem to prepare his imperial reader for the switch from politics to escha-tology. Cyril thus reinforces his portrayal of Constantius as a devout Christian emperor and assures Constantius not just of military success but of the truth of the Christian faith, while still maintaining his own episcopal authority. Keywords Cyril of Jerusalem – celestial cross – Constantius II – Jerusalem – eschatology – panegyric\n\nByzantine attitudes towards warfare have been marked by the intersect of the Roman imperial concept with Christian ideas and beliefs. The role of Eastern Christianity in justifying and motivating imperial warfare has been a topic of intensive debate – in particular the question as to whether the East Roman imperial state developed its own concept of ‘holy war’. The current chapter offers an overview of the development of eastern Roman thought and practices regarding justified war against the enemies of the Empire of Constantinople from the time of Constantine I until the disintegration of the centralized East Roman imperial polity in 1204. Beginning with the process of Christianization of the Late Empire and Roman war ethic, the account focuses on the Justinianic reconquista, the sacralized Persian war of Heraclius, the ideological confrontation with Islam and, finally, the Byzantine attitudes towards the crusading movement.\n\nEspecially during the Theodosian dynasty some remarkable ladies of the Roman imperial houses played prominent roles. Most of these women were very intelligent and ambitious. Some of them were independent from the Imperial policy, others were used to strengthen the bond between East and West or the courts and the Church, and still others devoted their life and works to the Church, the way the Church Fathers wanted. The prominence of women in the Byzantine Empire (until 1453) found its roots in the Theodosian dynasty, especially with the powerful trio Galla Placidia, her niece Pulcheria and Pulcheria’s sister-in-law Aelia Eudocia. Although limited by their sex, Galla and Eudocia received authority from childbearing. Lacking magisterial powers, Pulcheria especially had to develop other resources that had nothing to do with traditional female functions, power acquired instead through spectacular piety, exalted humility, works of construction and philanthropy, and potent alliances with saints (the cult of the relics) . The Augusti and Augustae of the Theodosion dynasty fully supported the Christianization of the public life and full elaboration of Christian art and left us an amazing legacy of religious art (the so-called \"Theodosian Renaissance). Furthermore, Byzantium was not a hereditary state. Emperors generally tried to arrange the succession for their kin. A father’s premature death created an opportunity for his female relatives, for in such circumstances it was generally recognized that the young co-emperor’s mother was most likely to keep his interests at heart and to protect his rights. Widowed mothers therefore were likely to participate in the regency council set up to administer the empire for the child, until he reached his majority. This tradition had been established by examples dating from Late Antiquity, notably the power exercised by Pulcheria, older sister of Emperor Theodosios II in the fifth century. This fact would start the continuous influence of strong women at the center of the Byzantine Empire for the next 1,100 years such as Theodora (527-548), Irene (797-802), Theodora (830-842), Zoë Porphyrogenita (1028-1050), Eudokia Makrembolitissa (1059– 78) and Euphrosyne Doukaina (1195-1203)."
