        "text": "GWR hosted 84-year-old civil rights activist Dr Paul Stephenson\n\nGreat Western Railway hosted a special audience with civil rights activist Dr Paul Stephenson to mark the start of Black History Month.\n\nDr Stephenson was joined by friends and members of GWR’s REACH network (Recognising Ethnicity and Cultural Heritage), on top of his very own train, for a journey from Bristol Temple Meads to Swindon.\n\nDuring Black History Month last year, GWR named Intercity Express Train 800036 in tribute to Dr Stephenson.\n\nGWR honoured Dr Stephenson to celebrate a lifetime spent campaigning for civil rights for the British African-Caribbean community.\n\nThe 84-year-old civil rights pioneer was awarded an OBE in 2009 ‘for his services to equal opportunities and to community relations in Bristol’.\n\nIn 2017 he also received a Pride of Britain Award for Lifetime Achievement.\n\nEsther Deans, director of One Bristol Curriculum, joined Dr Stephenson in last week's audience.\n\nThe organisation works with schools to address diversity in the community by promoting unity through knowledge and awareness of others.\n\nMs Deans said: \"Paul was so proud to have a GWR train named in his honour last year and events like this help to increase awareness of his pioneering work.\n\n\"Paul fought for equality and civil rights for more than 60 years and the closer relations we enjoy today between all the communities of Bristol are thanks to his unstinting dedication.\"\n\nGWR Inclusion and Diversity manager Odis Palmer said the train operator was proud to have recognised Dr Stephenson as one of its Great Westerners - celebrating past and present heroes from across the network.\n\nHe added: \"We are proud of our association with Dr Paul Stephenson and today’s event has been truly inspiring, learning more about his dedication to improving race relations and encouraging community involvement.\n\n\"Today was a wonderful opportunity for colleagues to ask questions and to celebrate Black contributions to British society. It was the perfect way to mark the start of Black History Month.\"\n\nLeading a series of civil rights changes\n\nIn 1963, Dr Stephenson led a boycott of the Bristol Omnibus Company, protesting its refusal to employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors.\n\nThe company ended up revoking its colour bar, after a 60-day boycott supported by thousands of Bristolians.\n\nA year later he also refused to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a magistrates’ court trial which was dismissed.\n\nDr Stephenson’s campaigns were instrumental in paving the way for the first Race Relations Act in 1965.\n\nHe later worked for the Commission for Racial Equality in London.\n\nIn 1975 he was appointed to the Sports Council, campaigning prominently against sporting contacts with apartheid South Africa.\n\nHe was granted Freedom of the City of Bristol in 2007.\n\nBristol Mayor Marvin Rees said: \"Paul’s contribution to racial equality in Bristol extends beyond the stand he, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Guy Reid-Bailey took during the Bristol Bus Boycott.\n\n\"He has continued to work for equality in Bristol, sharing his experience and expertise with us. I am delighted that GWR continues to honour Dr Paul Stephenson’s legacy in our city through this event.\"\n\nOther Great Westerners to be celebrated on GWR’s Intercity Express Trains include:\n\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II\n\nBristol paramedic Kathryn Osmond, who fought to raise awareness of the skin cancer melanoma\n\nFleur Lombard, the first female firefighter to die on duty in peacetime Britain\n\nGeorge 'Johnny' Johnson, the last surviving British member of the Dambusters raid\n\nFirst for all the latest news from across the UK every hour on Hits Radio on DAB, at hitsradio.co.uk and on the Hits Radio app."
