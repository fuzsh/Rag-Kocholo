        "text": "Family Links\n\nSpouses/Children:\n\nGwendolen Talbot\n\nAugustus William Stephenson+\n\nJohn Frederick Eustace Stephenson\n\nPaul Stephenson\n\nJane Stephenson\n\nHenry James Stephenson\n\nSir Guy Stephenson 239\n\nBorn: 5 November 1865, St. George's Hanover Square, London 10\n\nMarriage: Gwendolen Talbot in 1905\n\nDied: 17 October 1930, 31 Queens Gate, London aged 64 13\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nFrom The Times, October 18, 1930\n\nSir Guy Stephenson, Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions, died in\n\nLondon last night, at the age of 65. He had been ill since the\n\nbeginning of September, when he underwent an operation, and had since\n\nmade a most gallant fight for recovery.\n\nStephenson was a criminal lawyer of wide knowledge and long\n\nexperience, and in him the country loses a public servant of tried\n\nability and conscientious industry whose work was naturally known only\n\nto few. Personally, he was one of the kindest of men, and he will be\n\ndeeply regretted in a very wide circle.\n\nThe eldest son of the late Sir Augustus Keppel Stephenson, K.C., who\n\nwas Solicitor to the Treasury and Director of Public Prosecutions when\n\nthe two offices were held together, he was born in 1865, and obtained\n\nan entrance scholarship at Harrow, where he was in Mr. A. G. Watson's\n\nhouse. He was in the Shooting VIII. in 1884, and went up to Trinity\n\nCollege, Cambridge, where he took his degree in 1887. He was called\n\nto the Inner Temple in 1888, and obtained an excellent practice at the\n\nCentral Criminal Court and on the South-Eastern Circuit. He was\n\nappointed counsel to the Treasury at the North London Sessions in\n\n1901, and Assistant Solicitor to the Treasury in 1905.\n\nThree years later he was made Assistant Director of Public\n\nProsecutions, his chief being the late Sir Charles Mathews, in whose\n\nchambers he had spent his early years at the Bar. He had already\n\nlearnt from Mathews the art of mastering all the details of a case by\n\narranging them in chronological order, and this proved of great value\n\nto him in the public service. He was created C.B. in 1913 and was\n\nknighted in 1923. Sir Guy was joint editor of the 22nd and 23rd\n\neditions of Archbold's Criminal Pleading. He was an old Volunteer,\n\nwho had served in the 2nd V.B., The Wiltshire Regiment, and was fond\n\nof shooting, fishing, and golf. For many years he was a much\n\nappreciated contributor to the social life of the Bar, for he\n\npossessed remarkable skill in whistling to his own piano\n\naccompaniments. He married, in 1905, Gwendolen, daughter of the late\n\nRight Hon. J. G. Talbot, and had four sons and one daughter.\n\nNoted events in his life were:\n\n1. Census UK 1911: 1911, 41 Egerton Gardens, Kensington, London. 10\n\n2. Resided: 17 October 1930, 41 Egerton Gardens, Kensington, London. 13\n\n3. His funeral was held on 20 October 1930 in Nunton, Salisbury, Wiltshire.\n\n4. Memorial Service: 21 October 1930, All Saints', Ennismore Gardens, London.\n\n5. He had an estate probated on 13 December 1930 in London. 13\n\nGuy married Gwendolen Talbot, daughter of John Gilbert Talbot and Meriel Sarah Lyttelton, in 1905. (Gwendolen Talbot was born in 1877 in Westminster, London 10 and died on 26 July 1960 in Edenbridge, Kent 13.)"
