        "text": "Sir Paul Stephenson said today he was \"hugely proud\" to be appointed the new Metropolitan police commissioner and said that he would face the challenges of the job by doing things \"my way\".\n\nThe acting commissioner was unveiled as Britain's most senior police officer by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, and the London mayor, Boris Johnson.\n\nBut the appointment of the man who allowed the controversial arrest of the shadow immigration minister, Damian Green, was greeted today by scepticism by some, with critics claiming police reforms would take a backseat under the 55-year-old.\n\nStephenson beat Sir Hugh Orde, 50, the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, to the post after both men presented their case to run Britain's biggest police force to Smith and Johnson.\n\nSpeaking at a photocall outside Scotland Yard, flanked by Smith, Stephenson said: \"I am just such a hugely proud policeman today, to be asked to lead the Met in bringing safety to millions of Londoners, millions of visitors and lead the Met's national efforts. I am just enormously proud and I understand the challenge that awaits me.\"\n\nCommenting on his controversial predecessor, Stephenson said: \"Sir Ian Blair did it his way. I'm going to do it my way.\"\n\nHe added: \"I think my job in the coming years is clear. I think what we've got to do is continue to cut crime and deal with crime. We've got to convince all the communities of Londoners that we are on their side in doing what they want us to do.\n\n\"We have to be intolerant of violence, no matter where that violence comes from. We've just simply got to make sure we are delivering. That's our job, it's my job to lead that delivery.\n\n\"I'm hugely confident of the ability of the Met to do it, maintain what we do well and make a lot of improvements in the process. And I'm just looking forward to the challenge and I thank the people who have appointed me and show the faith that they have in me.\"\n\nSmith indicated that Stephenson had been the choice of both her and Johnson. She said: \"In the last few years, as deputy commissioner in London, Sir Paul has been at the heart of policing the capital.\n\n\"His understanding of what is needed to combat terrorism and serious and violent crime will be invaluable in his role. Sir Paul also has a strong record in driving neighbourhood policing as chief constable in Lancashire and he brings his experience from Merseyside and Northern Ireland to the job as well.\n\n\"I believe therefore that Sir Paul offers the expertise and the leadership needed to inspire confidence across the entire police service and most importantly amongst the people of London.\n\n\"He impressed me with his strong vision and approach to tackling the challenges that lie ahead for the Met and the police service across the country at a time of significant reform.\"\n\nStephenson has long been favoured by Johnson, who forced Blair from his post as soon as he took over control of the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) last October.\n\nJohnson gave a hearty endorsement of Stephenson during his opening remarks at his monthly mayor's questions session with the London assembly.\n\n\"We have a very good new commissioner in the form of Stephenson,\" the mayor said. \"For those who don't know the process, the home secretary and I met on Monday to interview the final two candidates. They were both exceptional candidates but Sir Paul was the outstanding candidate. I think everyone on the MPA would agree with that.\n\n\"We have made the right choice. I think he will provide common sense policing for London, and he will help to get officers out on the streets where they will be giving people the sense of safety and reassurance they need.\"\n\nOrde, who has negotiated his way through the political minefield of Northern Ireland politics and come out with plaudits, was seen by many Met officers as the new broom that could sweep away low morale, bitter infighting and a sense of the service being rudderless.\n\nOne of the most unenthusiastic reactions to the new appointment came from Brian Paddick, a former assistant commissioner and Liberal Democrat mayoral candidate, who thought much-needed police reforms would \"take a backseat\" under Stephenson.\n\n\"There will be a lot of rank-and-file officers who will say, 'Well, anything is better than Sir Ian Blair,'\" Paddick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"I don't necessarily agree with that but I think he is more likely to work with the predominant macho male culture than Sir Ian Blair was and therefore he will be more popular with the ground floor but not necessarily for the right reasons.\"\n\nKen Livingstone, the former mayor of London, reacted more positively. \"A lot of us had worries that Boris might try and get someone in who would be out of touch with what London's policing needs,\" he said.\n\nChris Grayling, the shadow home secretary, was non-committal, saying: \"We congratulate Sir Paul on his appointment and wish him well as the new commissioner. His big challenge will be to restore the reputation and independence of the Metropolitan police.\"\n\nAt one time Stephenson thought he had lost the chance to win the top job and considered withdrawing his application. In the immediate aftermath of the arrest of Green in December he faced serious criticism over his judgment.\n\nThe former chief constable of Lancashire police joined the Met as deputy commissioner in 2005 under Blair. In the later months of Blair's leadership Stephenson was effectively running the force.\n\nOn the day Blair left, Stephenson was confronted by Bob Quick, assistant commissioner special operations, who announced that he was about to arrest Green over allegations that he was leaking government documents.\n\nStephenson challenged him but the arrest went ahead. He faced a barrage of criticism from politicians on all sides and is likely to face more from a Home Office select committee inquiry into the arrest.\n\nIt is understood that an independent report, by Ian Johnston, chief constable of British Transport police, into the arrest found that it was just about legal. At the time the London mayor told the new acting commissioner he needed to be convinced the arrest was necessary and proportionate.\n\nStephenson recovered some ground with Johnson and, despite the controversy, remained one of the mayor's favourites for the job. His policies on neighbourhood policing – in the mould of Blair – would have found the support of Smith and a reduction in knife crime under his watch are also likely to have boosted his candidacy.\n\nJohnson's spokesman said last night that the mayor was \"delighted\" that the home secretary had agreed with his choice for the next commissioner when they discussed the appointment on Monday.\n\nStephenson, a father of three, has a base in London but returns to rural Lancashire, where his family live, most weekends.\n\nHe takes over a force of 31,000 officers and 10,000 staff as well as assuming responsibility of the country's anti-terrorist strategy. Stephenson served as an RUC officer at the height of the Troubles and, against the advice of his security detail, went to meet members of the nationalist community.\n\nAfter the RUC, he became assistant chief constable of Merseyside police before moving to Lancashire as deputy chief constable in May 1999, then becoming chief constable of the force in 2002.\n\nStephenson found Northern Ireland an inspirational career experience. He will need all that inspiration for his new job leading a force riven with infighting and rumblings of discontent from black and Asian officers who believe that, 10 years after the Macpherson report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, they are still being discriminated against when it comes to promotion to the higher ranks.\n\nCommander Shabir Hussain, who lost a case of racial discrimination against the Met, accused Blair of surrounding himself with a \"golden circle\" of white officers.\n\nAnd the force's most senior Asian officer, Tarique Ghaffur, left and won an out-of-court settlement after accusing Blair and the Met of racial discrimination, which was played out in public.\n\n\"We are very disappointed,\" said one Asian officer. \"We wanted a new broom; we had hoped that Orde would come in and shake the tree and put the era of Blair and his cohorts behind us.\""
