        "text": "Who we are\n\nThe Child Protection in Sport Unit (CPSU) is part of the NSPCC and is funded by Sport England, Sport Northern Ireland, Sport Wales, UK Sport and The Football Association.\n\n(In Scotland, there's a similar partnership between Children 1st and sportscotland.)\n\nThe CPSU was founded in 2001 in response to a series of high-profile cases of abuse of young athletes. We work to help improve safeguarding and child protection practices within sport organisations, to ensure all children and young people are safe while participating in sport and physical activity at all levels.\n\nMichelle North, Head of CPSU, said:\n\n\"Since the CPSU was formed, there have been considerable developments within safeguarding across the sport sector. This is due to the great work of the staff and volunteers within sports organisations striving to create safer cultures and environments for children and young people, but the work continues, and the Unit remains essential today. Our aim is to ensure that children and young people are protected in and through sport and activity, and we want to help and support organisations to do this.\"\n\nThe unit plays a strategic role in the landscape of sport in the UK. We work directly with UK Sport Councils, National Governing Bodies (NGBs), Active Partnerships (APs) and other organisations. We support organisations to implement and maintain safeguarding practices, to minimise the risk of abuse and ensure that sport stays safe and enjoyable for all those involved.\n\nOur work with national bodies, clubs and activity providers\n\nWe assist sporting organisations to develop, implement and embed their safeguarding responses, policies and procedures and systems to help to create a safe and inclusive environment for all participants, staff and volunteers.\n\nSince 2001, we have worked with sport and statutory agencies to ensure that all children, regardless of their level of participation in sport or where they participate, have a safe and enjoyable experience.\n\nWe do this by:\n\nsupporting sports organisations to follow our standards assessment processes to safeguarding children in sport\n\nguiding sports organisations through an annual review process to ensure standards are embedded across their work\n\nproviding expert safeguarding and child protection advice to all\n\ndeveloping and delivering sports specific training and resources\n\ncommissioning and supporting safeguarding research to develop understanding and an evidence base\n\nThough we are happy to give safeguarding advice to those who may need it, we cannot investigate specific cases. If you need help with investigating a case or safeguarding concerns, please contact your National Governing Body or Active Partnership.\n\nThe NSPCC helpline can offer in-depth advice and can be contacted by phoning 0808 800 5000 or emailing help@nspcc.org.uk.\n\nEmerging work\n\nTo ensure the CPSU is working to co-deliver the aims of Sport England's Uniting the Movement strategy and the NSPCC's 2021-31 strategy we are bringing safeguarding to the forefront in several areas of work across the UK, including:\n\nInclusivity in sport\n\nWe aim to better understand intersectionality, systemic unconscious biases and the risks minoritised children and young people experience to better tackle inequalities in safeguarding in sport.\n\nTo achieve this, we will engage specialist groups, both internal and external, and use this learning to support the review and update of our standards. To ensure that all communities are represented and there is safeguarding access for all.\n\nIndependent, community and sport activity providers\n\nWe aim to support a wider range of sport and activity providers, offering guidance and resources to help put in place, implement and embed safeguarding practices within their club or activity. We will look to engage directly with this audience to find out where the gaps are and work together to fill these, ensuring everything is in place so that children can have a fun and safe experience.\n\nLeisure facilities\n\nWe aim to grow our existing relationships with the leisure sector to identify the needs of both the public and the sector, to meet safeguarding standards and help protect children from harm.\n\nVolunteer programme\n\nWe aim to reach into new communities across sport by developing our volunteering programme. We have recruited a network of volunteers who will support us to strengthen our understanding of community safeguarding practices, build links and spread awareness of safeguarding best practice at a local level.\n\nNational awareness raising campaigns\n\nKeeping your child safe in sport\n\nKeeping your child safe in sport is our campaign to raise awareness of the important role parents play in youth sport. Each year, we hold a focused awareness week during the first week of October, where we bring together parents, sports clubs and bodies, and NSPCC ambassadors to help parents to keep children safe in sport.\n\nClose the Loophole\n\nUntil June 2022, a loophole in the law meant that some adults who hold a position of power over a young person aged 16 or 17 (including sports coaches) could legally have sex with them. This was unlike teachers, for whom this would be a serious criminal offence.\n\nThe NSPCC campaigned to get this law changed and, in March 2021, the Ministry of Justice announced that the law was being extended to see sports coaches and faith leaders included alongside roles like teachers and social workers. This went into effect on Tuesday 28 June 2022, with sports coaches and faith leaders now being recognised in law as being in 'positions of trust'.\n\nFor further information, please see our news article about the success of the campaign and listen to our Changes in positions of trust legislation podcast.\n\nMeet the CPSU team\n\nMichelle North\n\nHead of CPSU\n\nMichelle joined the CPSU team in April 2013 and was appointed as Head of CPSU in April 2020.
