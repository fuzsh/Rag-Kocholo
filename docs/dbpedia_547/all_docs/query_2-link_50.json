Paul went above and beyond, keeping me informed every step of the way about each aspect of the design and making process - providing sketches, photos and film clips, which I very much appreciated - and the finished piece was made to perfection!! üòç‚ù§Ô∏è I am so thrilled with my unique pendant and I wouldn't hesitate to commission another piece or to recommend his outstanding workmanship. Thank you so much, Paul!''\n\n‚Äã\n\nLucy\n\nPaul has been amazing from start to finish - updating me with progress, discussing exactly what I was after, open to try the different things I was looking for, and the quality of work was absolutely amazing.

Will be using again and would recommend to anyone!\n\n‚Äã\n\nMolly\n\nApologies for my late message - just wanted to thank you so VERY much for my gorgeous pendant received early today.

My new necklace is just perfect for wearing with my uniform! I am really, really pleased with it.\n\nI love jewellery and your silversmithing is exceptional quality.

Thank you so much.\n\nAs I‚Äôve just found you, rest assured I will be a repeat customer!\n\n‚Äã\n\nClaire\n\n‚Äã\n\nI grew up treasure hunting with my mum and brother on beaches, treasure being sea glass, stones with holes in and fossils. For her 70th birthday next month I have bought her this absolutely stunning bracelet my friend @paulstephensonjewellery created, it is so beautiful the photos don't do it justice, I know she'll love it and it is a real treasure.

I just purchased these two pieces from @paulstephensonjewellery. Just received them here in the United States and I couldn‚Äôt be more excited!\n\nLeonard\n\n‚Äã\n\nHi Paul,\n\nMerry Christmas. I just wanted to let you know that your Jewellery has made somebody's Christmas! My sister in law said that it is one of the nicest gifts anyone has ever got her, (she is an artist) and said it's like she had drawn the design for herself and I should tell you that you have a very special gift. Thank you again.\n\n‚Äã\n\nCate S\n\n‚Äã\n\nThank you so so much for tonight, I‚Äôve had a really good time catching up and got some fab jewellery .. just showing mum and she loves them too .. so excited to wear them xxx\n\n‚Äã\n\nRebecca\n\n‚Äã"
