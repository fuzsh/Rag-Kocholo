        "text": "Mariolina Eliantonio is professor of European and Comparative Administrative Law and Procedure at the Faculty of Law (FoL). Her research is focused on the enforcement of European law before national and EU courts. She coordinates courses of European and comparative administrative law. She will act as Director.\n\nPaul Stephenson is assistant professor at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASoS). His research is focused on EU institutions, the politics of evaluation and audit, and issues of financial accountability related to the EU budget. He coordinates and teaches courses in European Studies. He will act as Associate Director.\n\nBoth Brussels-based, Eliantonio and Stephenson will combine the Campus Brussels co-directorship with regular duties at their respective faculties, thus contributing to further strengthen the links between UM and Europe (and the world). Both are familiar with Campus Brussels and have played an important part in its growth as frequent organisers of research, education, knowledge transfer, and policy events.\n\nThe Executive Board is looking forward to working with the new co-directors alongside the Campus Brussels team."
