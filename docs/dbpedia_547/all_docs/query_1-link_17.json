His first novel series – the indie-published apocalyptic Blood on the Motorway trilogy – has been an Amazon bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic. A former journalist, he holds a diploma in Creative Writing at Oxford University.\n\nHis stories have been featured on the chart-topping horror podcasts, The Other Stories and The Night’s End. His newest project, the ebook serial The Sunset Chronicles, is a dystopian sci-fi thriller that will delight and terrify fans of science fiction and horror alike. He is also the creator of the podcasts, Bleakwood, tales of terror from a mysterious English town, and is one half of the All Creatives Now team, with fellow horror author, Kev Harrison.\n\nHe lives in England with his wife, two children, and one hellhound."
