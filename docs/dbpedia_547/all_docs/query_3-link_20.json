        "text": "In three years time, Sir Paul will stand shoulder-to-shoulder on the world stage with the Queen and the Prime Minister as London hosts the 2012 Olympics.\n\nThe process for planning a secure Games on a tight budget, set against the obvious terrorist threat, will be what keeps the new Commissioner awake at night. The road to 2012 is likely to be as rocky and acutely political as a Metropolitan police chief has ever faced.\n\nThe legacy he inherits is not a police force that is broken, but one that has been dysfunctional at the top levels, low on morale throughout and in need of strong leadership, finer judgement and a greater use of common sense to re-engage the public.\n\nHe has many immediate concerns, not least dealing with the effects of a recession and keeping teenage knife murders in check.\n\nBut top of the new Commissioner's immediate in-tray is the Damian Green affair - the controversial leaks inquiry that almost led him to withdraw his application to become Met chief.\n\nDespite effectively sanctioning the arrest of the Tory MP, Sir Paul has distanced himself from the fallout and was reassured by the Mayor of London and the Home Office that the damage was not permanent.\n\nHe will be desperate to get on the front foot over the controversy. The case has dragged on and while the civil servant \"whistleblower\" is due to answer bail this week, Crown Prosecution Service lawyers are still awaiting the final pieces of evidence from the Met's counter terrorist unit before making a decision on whether to press charges.\n\nIf, as is widely expected in both police and legal circles, the case is dropped, how bold will Sir Paul be?\n\nWill he call upon Bob Quick, the anti-terrorism chief who signed off the arrest and pursued the inquiry, to take the rap and fall on his sword?\n\nHis handling of the fallout will be watched very carefully.\n\nEqually sensitive is the potential for an inquiry into the House of Lords. Scotland Yard has been called in after four Labour peers were accused of negotiating fees of up to £120,000 with newspaper reporters posing as lobbyists seeking to amend laws. Detectives are currently \"scoping\" the allegations to determine whether a full-scale investigation should be launched. Sir Paul will be fully briefed before any decision is made about another potential political minefield.\n\nAt street-level, crime figures are down but the recession is likely to make the task of maintaining law and order in capital more chaotic, and every Scotland Yard unit has been briefed to watch carefully for the first signs of its influence. Sir Paul has already targeted an anticipated rise in break-ins by ordering the round up of every known burglar in the capital at Christmas.\n\nA concern for many Londoners is the prevalence of teenage knife crime, although a tough crackdown has curbed the number of young murder victims in recent months.\n\nOn a national scale, the al-Qaeda threat may perhaps be lower than it was according to the head of MI5, but the fear is that the terrorist attacks on Mumbai are the beginnings of something new – a simplified method of attack which is hard to anticipate and difficult to contain.\n\nFighting crime, catching criminals and supporting victims is what the public wants.\n\nBut as with any high profile leader, Sir Paul also has political and public relations battles to win.\n\nOn the PR front, last year saw an uncanny coming together of cases from the past two decades over which the Met took a hammering –Jean Charles de Menezes, the unresolved murder of Jill Dando in 1999 and this blunders over the investigation into the killing of Rachel Nickell in 1992.\n\nNo cases of such magnitude loom in 2009, but new ones will inevitably emerge. Sir Paul will rise or fall by his ability to put out the fires, calm the controversies, and in doing so, drag the whole of the top ranks of the met and his workforce with him.\n\nAs a result of his political divisiveness and repeated blunders, Sir Ian quickly lost the support of his senior officers at the top of the Met, who engaged in endless backbiting.\n\nSir Paul will have a new deputy, probably brought in from outside the force, and the Commissioner must confront any disquiet head-on and end the disillusionment and cynicism of the canteen chatter.\n\nNor can he afford to be submerged by all the politics. His primary role is that of a crimefighter and only by proving himself \"a copper's copper\" will he win the support of the Met rank and file."
