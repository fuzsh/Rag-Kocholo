        "text": "2023: 82.3% A*/A at A level.\n\n2022: 98% 9-7 at GCSE; 92% A*/A at A level (97% A*-B).\n\nWestminster School students thrive intellectually, redirecting their competitive energies into academic pursuits over sports, except in activities like rowing, cricket, and fencing. Societies and Model United Nations are the arenas of choice for their competitive drive. The school’s environment radiates intellectual confidence, with seamless interactions between teachers and students even in philosophical discussions.\n\nKey points to note are the minimum of four A levels, widespread adoption of EPQs (often on unique subjects), and inclusion of an additional AS subject. The classics department is robust, marked by compulsory Latin and Greek in the first year. An impressive number of classicists gain admission to Oxford or Cambridge. While French is compulsory, students are encouraged to study more than one modern language at GCSE. The school promotes interdisciplinary exploration, with humanities students often embracing science subjects. Math is a focal point at A level, though the computer science department is relatively smaller and less strong compared to classics.\n\nArts\n\nWestminster School provides an inspiring environment for music, drama, and diverse intellectual pursuits, shaping well-rounded students. The school boasts an exceptional music program known for its wide-ranging opportunities and high standards. Orchestral and vocal performances occur in prestigious venues like the Barbican and Westminster Abbey. The demanding commitment to music is balanced with academics, guided by an accommodating director of music. Music scholars are automatically part of main orchestras and choirs, while others audition. Performances and rehearsals accommodate impending exams. Drama is both an academic subject and popular extracurricular, with house plays, school productions, and opportunities for backstage roles. Over 40 student-led societies include a diverse range from science to cultural groups, reflecting the school’s central London location.\n\nSports\n\nAt Westminster School, sports—referred to as ‘Station’—offer diverse options encompassing 25 activities, from fives and fencing to pilates and judo. While various activities exist, the culture is dominated by the prestigious and highly dedicated world of rowing (‘water’), with around 100 pupils commuting regularly to the Putney boathouse. The school has excelled in Henley Royal Regatta and developed a strong, familial bond among the rowing squad.\n\nWhile other sports like cricket, fencing, and judo have seen some success, Westminster’s focus is more on participation than winning. Facilities are impeccably maintained, notably in Vincent Square, where cricket squares, football pitches, and a restored Victorian pavilion showcase meticulous care. While not all students heavily engage in ‘Station,’ the school offers a range of activities that draw enthusiasm, including the intriguing ‘target shooting in the attic.’"
