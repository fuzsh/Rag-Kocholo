To support the application process, we have a dedicated and experienced admissions team, who are available to answer any questions applicant families may have and who make applying to the School easy and undaunting. It is important to note that those applying for 11+ entry to Westminster Under School cannot, at the same time, apply for 13+ entry to Westminster School. Details regarding transition to Westminster School can be found on each of the entry point pages. Find out when your child is able to apply to join the School and view the registration timeline using Westminster Schoolâ€™s registration age checker."
