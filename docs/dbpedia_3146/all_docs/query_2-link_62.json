        "text": "College president from 1859-1899 whose strong Christian faith advanced Waynesburg as a liberal arts institution that provided education for all\n\nAlfred Brashear Miller entered Waynesburg College as a student in 1851, unaware that he would later be regarded as one of the first and most influential persons ever to be associated with the school.\n\nOne of 10 children, Miller’s early education was partially inhibited due to a dissension that closed the district school for several years. He was determined, however, to receive a quality education. At age 18, Miller entered school at the Greene Academy in Carmichaels, Pa. There, he spent three summer terms learning and the winter months teaching. Shortly after completing his education at the Greene Academy, Miller received his license to pastor from Union Presbytery of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.\n\nMiller enrolled at Waynesburg College and, after graduating in 1853, was immediately elected professor of mathematics at the college until 1858, when he was chosen to serve as president of the college.\n\nIn 1855, he married Margaret Kerr Bell, teacher and principal of the Female Department of Waynesburg. A woman driven by her desire to teach and promote women’s rights to fair education, (Bell) Miller became an unforgettable name when she entered as a faculty member at Waynesburg College in 1850. It was said that, “[She was] by birth, temperament and training one of the most able educators of her day; a pioneer in female education and a champion of women’s rights.”\n\nPrior to her acceptance as a faculty member at Waynesburg College, (Bell) Miller graduated with honors from the Washington Female Seminary. There she received a diploma, not a degree, due to her gender. She did not agree with the idea of separate and unequal education of men and women. Under her influence, in November 1851, all Waynesburg College students, both male and female, partook in classes in the new Hanna Hall building, no longer separated.\n\nThe year of 1852 marked a great accomplishment for (Bell) Miller and three of her female students, who became the first women to graduate with diplomas from Waynesburg College. Five years later in 1857, three more women graduated with bachelor’s degrees, becoming the first women in the state of Pennsylvania to do so.\n\nGuided by God, the Millers worked side by side not only to better the institution, but to ensure its survival amidst the economic difficulties brought on by the Civil War.\n\nIn addition to being a wife and mother of eight, (Bell) Miller dedicated a great deal of time to her passion for education, teaching six to seven hours a day in addition to her other responsibilities at the college. In 1874 she suffered a stroke, most likely due to exhaustion, and died a few months later at only 47 years of age. Her funeral is said to have been the most attended of any in Waynesburg to that date. If not for her personal sacrifices and steadfast devotion to the institution, it might have failed.\n\nAfter his wife’s passing, Miller would go on to become a nationally known figure. In 1875 he was chosen as the national delegate of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church to the annual conference of the Evangelical Union in Scotland and was moderator of the General Assembly of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in 1877. He was also editor of the “Cumberland Presbyterian” and author of the book, “Doctrines and Genius of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.”\n\nThroughout his career at Waynesburg College, Miller taught approximately 7,000 students. In the last years of his presidency, Miller was significantly involved in the construction of a new college building, named Miller Hall in his honor, which was dedicated in June 1899, the year Miller stepped down as president. He said of the structure, “I verily believe that God bids us to build a monument that will not only record the liberality of a grateful church, but send a blessed influence through the centuries.” Then valued at $100,000, the building was a much needed addition to Waynesburg’s campus.\n\nA man of many accomplishments and numerous virtues, Miller lived his faith. In his personal journal he wrote, “A life of unselfish devotion to the truth and to practical benevolence is the noblest life you can live.”\n\nOne of three Waynesburg College women who were among the first degreed females in Pennsylvania\n\nMore than 150 years ago, three women created history by becoming the first women to graduate from Waynesburg College with bachelor’s degrees. One of those bold women was Lydia (Weethee) Sparrow.\n\nBorn January 27, 1839, Sparrow was unaware of what she would come to accomplish in the future—setting a historic example for women around the globe.\n\nShe and her cousins, Laura (Weethee) Jennings and Margaret Leonice (Needham) Still, enrolled at Waynesburg after a request by family member Rev. J. P. Weethee, former president of the college, to participate in the equal opportunity experiment fronted by the school.\n\nPrior to Sparrow’s acceptance of her degree, women had been graduating from the Female Seminary at Waynesburg College as early as 1852. However, these degrees were equivalent to today’s high school diplomas while men received degrees of higher stature, such as those received by college graduates today.\n\nHeaded by Margaret Kerr (Bell) Miller, the Female Seminary evolved into the Female Department, in which men and women were no longer separated by anything but a name. Through this transformation, Sparrow became one of the first women to take classes with men and receive the same degree as them, despite the social unease over coeducation that mounted in the town of Waynesburg prior to her enrollment.\n\nIn September of 1857, Waynesburg joined Westminster College as one of the first two institutions of higher education in the state of Pennsylvania at which women were bestowed with bachelor’s degrees—ones of equal weight to that of their male classmates. Sparrow proudly returned home as one of the first degreed women in the country.\n\nShe married Dr. Thomas West Sparrow, M.D., in 1861 and lived a long and happy life.\n\nAwarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry at the Battle of Gettysburg\n\nJames Jackson Purman was known by many titles: lieutenant, principal, lawyer, physician and medical director of the Grand Army of the Republic. But of these things, what Purman is most remembered for is his gallantry during the Battle of Gettysburg, for which he received the Medal of Honor from Congress.\n\nPurman enrolled at Waynesburg College, teaching at a local school to help pay for his tuition. In 1862, just before his senior year, he opted to put his studies on hold to help organize a volunteer Army unit to aid the war raging around him. He was voted 1st Lieutenant of Company A, 140th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry and a year later, found himself in the Wheatfield at Gettysburg.\n\nDuring the second day of battle, Purman was struck near his left ankle after attempting to help a wounded comrade. He laid overnight listening to the cries of dying men around him. The next morning, he was shot in his right leg when opposing pickets exchanged shots. Desperate for water, he called out to the enemy for help. A lieutenant from a Georgia regiment came to his rescue, offered him water and tended to his wounds. The Confederate then got Purman safely off the battlefield by carrying him on his back while crawling on all fours.\n\nLater that night, a Union stretcher party carried Purman to a field hospital. The next day, his left leg was amputated below the knee. The soldier whose life he tried to save had not survived.\n\nIn May 1864, Purman was discharged from the army and he returned to finish his degree at Waynesburg. He became principal of Baptist Academy, which later became Monongahela College. He also studied law and was admitted to the Greene County Bar. He and his wife then moved to the nation’s capital where Purman pursued a course in a medical school and served as the medical director of the Grand Army of the Republic—a powerful Union veterans’ organization. He also held a position at the U.S. Pension Office.\n\nHe kept in contact with the Confederate officer who aided him on the battlefield and, in later years, introduced him to President Theodore Roosevelt, describing the moment when honest compassion held greater weight than opposing opinions.\n\nDecorated Army general and respected politician whose offices included Pennsylvania governor and U.S. senator\n\nWhen Edward Martin graduated from Waynesburg College, little did the veteran, lawyer and Republican Party politician from Waynesburg, Pa., know, he would go on to serve the country in more ways than he could have ever foreseen.\n\nA newspaper remarked that, “General Martin has a high conception of public duty and obligation to the people. His entire career, either that of a soldier, private citizen or public official has been one which has shown a high degree of courage, of industry, of constructive ability and loyalty. The people generally would have more faith in their Government if we had more men of the type of General Edward Martin.”\n\nMartin offered his loyalty and service during the Spanish-American War in 1989, putting his education on hold and launching the start of his 44-year military career. In 1899, Martin returned to Waynesburg to complete his degree.\n\nAfter his admittance to the bar in 1905, Martin began practicing law in Waynesburg. He assumed his first of many political offices as secretary of the Greene County Republican Committee that year.\n\nSeveral years later, he was called back to serve in the First World War where he took the position of lieutenant colonel. After the war, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Purple Heart.\n\nThroughout his life, Martin served in several Pennsylvania state political positions including auditor general of Pennsylvania, burgess of East Waynesburg, solicitor of Greene County, state auditor general, state treasurer and governor of Pennsylvania.\n\nOn a national level, Martin served as president of the National Guard Association of the United States in 1940 and general of the U.S. National Guard. He also served as president of the Council of State Governments in 1946, which led to his election as a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 1947 where he served two terms, choosing not to seek re-nomination for a third in 1958.\n\nPrior to his death in 1967, Martin was presented with the Distinguished Service Medal and published “Always Be On Time: An Autobiography.” In it, he recalled, starting with Theodore Roosevelt, he had dined with every president since that time."
