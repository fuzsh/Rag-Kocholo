Thank you for your interest in our community.\n\nWestminster School is a co-educational school where children and teachers know each other well and respect each other as individuals. Parents also play a significant role; success is ultimately based on mutual support and encouragement among parents, students, and teachers. Enrolling a child at Westminster School is a family commitment, as the school seeks to involve all members of the family in the life of the School.\n\nI hope your visit to our website will encourage you to explore further. In order to place your child on our waiting list, please fill out our Online Inquiry Form or contact the admission office at 405.524.0631, ext. 123. I look forward to meeting you in person!"
