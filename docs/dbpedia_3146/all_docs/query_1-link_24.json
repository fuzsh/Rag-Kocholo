        "text": "Rumours that my old school, Westminster, is to go fully co-ed have finally been confirmed.\n\nFor the last 50 years they have admitted girls only in the top two years. But now, according to the school, the plan to admit girls in all years is “serious”.\n\nIn 1996 I left the all-girls grammar school Henrietta Barnett for Westminster and was one of only 60 girls in a school of 750 pupils.\n\nInitially I wasn’t worried about this, but, in the months before I started, I heard rumours that Westminster boys were sexist and unpleasant, intellectually cruel and judgmental. Would I be able to “keep up”? The hot take was that this was less school and more a bare-knuckle fight involving A4 lined paper and battered copies of King Lear.\n\nI set off to St James’s Park Tube station on my first day feeling so sick with nerves that I had to get off at Euston and sit with my head between my knees. Happily, I discovered that my new peers were not 100 per cent bastard, but mostly nervous maths nerds and the genial sons of Greek billionaires.\n\n“The boys talk a good game,” said my housemaster on day one. “But they’re more scared of you than you are of them.”\n\nAnd they had good cause to be. Hands-down the scariest people at school (as far as I was concerned, let alone the boys), were the other girls. They were not only clever, but sophisticated. They smoked Marlboros, lived in Chelsea and knew how to ski: no-one at Henrietta Barnett was like that. The teachers loved me, with my neat handwriting and sensible class contributions, the boys were pussycats - it was the girls you needed to stay on the right side of.\n\nMy memories of those two years are dream-like and floaty. Westminster sprawls across various old, shared buildings and you would need to be told that it was a school to believe it. Rooms open out onto other rooms and lessons are interrupted by the bong of Big Ben.\n\nStone steps are worn out in strange, uneven places from the wear of a hundred thousand black lace-up shoes. The wall outside the school store, purveyor of pens and chewy sweets, is covered in half-moon dips where queuing pupils, with the casual destruction of the young, have scraped holes with their coins.\n\nTwo mornings a week we filed into Westminster Abbey for hymns and a sermon. Sometimes, if I am very unhappy or stressed, I close my eyes and imagine that I am sitting there, in that cool, clean vaulted space, soothed by the susurration of 700 fidgeting boys in scratchy school trousers, with nothing more on my mind than a Harold Pinter essay.\n\nWhen I think about the boys at Westminster now, it’s with a confusing mix of feelings, informed by the hormonal 16-year-old I was, and the maternal 42-year-old mother-to-a-son I am now. I can see them in my mind’s eye, clear as day, loping across Dean’s Yard, two abreast, their ties whipping over their shoulders, talking about nothing more scandalous than the football.\n\nThey were good-natured, generous boys. I miss their company, their passion for nicknames, newspaper crosswords and complex slang. I miss my occasional lunchtime duty of supervising the 13-year-old fifth formers at lunch: with their fluffy hair and too-big blazers, they were just the absolute cutest. Did I marry my husband partly because he went to Westminster, too? Of course.\n\nThere were also some total monsters. I regret the time I wasted on one or two of them, when I could have been fondling the architecture or sniffing the prayer books. But their monstrousness wasn’t because they were boys, or because they were at Westminster: they were monsters because, in life, there are monsters.\n\nOnce the school is entirely co-ed (by 2030, they say), the monstrous element will go. It is already impossible to get into Westminster. If you halve the number of places available to boys, the only ones who will get in will have to be Messiah-like in their purity and genius. As will the girls, I suppose. And the school will be filled with seraphic higher-beings, discussing philosophy and writing political plays.\n\nOr, they will be so over-coached and highly strung that they will all stagger about the place wild-eyed and twitchy, barely able to speak.\n\nEither way, I’m envious.\n\nDid you attend a single sex or a co-ed school?
