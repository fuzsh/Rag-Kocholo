        "text": "An application for Variable Tuition does not affect the re-enrollment or admission process. Regardless of financial need, parents should initiate the re-enrollment or admission process as early as possible. Families may apply for Variable Tuition at the same time as applying for admission or re-enrolling, or they can apply for Variable Tuition separately from the admissions and re-enrollment process. An offer of financial assistance does not constitute an acceptance of admission to the school or a re-enrollment offer. Those are separate processes from Variable Tuition that the family must pursue.\n\nIt is not possible for a family or the school to estimate the tuition level for which a family qualifies without the completion of a Variable Tuition application. Applications are submitted directly to FACTS, a third-party agency. FACTS evaluates the application based on criteria set by the school and makes a recommendation to the school’s Variable Tuition team. Families are notified of the tuition level for which they qualify by the school’s business office.\n\nUnfortunately, the school is not able to provide Variable Tuition to every student who applies for Variable Tuition. We work within the available resources to make the school accessible to as many students and families as possible.\n\nAs a school, we have set aside a limited budget of funds to award each year. That means that once all funds have been awarded, there are no more Variable Tuition dollars available. This year, we closed Variable Tuition applications on March 28th because of the number of applications already received and awarded.\n\nTypically, we begin awarding Variable Tuition in February and meet every 2 weeks through the end of May to consider additional applications. Apply early to be considered in the first rounds of awards, when there are more funds available to award. Variable Applications will open again for the 2025-2026 school year in January of 2025."
