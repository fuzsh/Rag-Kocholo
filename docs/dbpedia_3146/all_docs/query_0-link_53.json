Cic, De Legibutt Liber SeamduSf Cap, IL ADVERTISEMENT TO THR FIRST EDITION. The favourable reception which the \"Registrum Regale** of Eton, 1774, has met with, would be a sufficient apology, were any necessary, for having undertaken the following compilation; in which the Editor has no pretension to any other merit than that of industry and fidelity. From an official connection^ with the Royal School of Westminster, he was led to inquire into its History, and that of the Members of so illustrious a Seminary; of whom at length he gradually obtained the present list, which he has so repeatedly been called upon to transcribe for private use, that he has no doubt of its being acceptable to the public in its present form. The slight biographical notices, such as they are, he hopes will be found useful. On this head, it would have been a real pleasure to him to have enlarged; but the small portion of leisure he enjoys, and the Utde opportunity of access to books, must plead his excuse for brevity. Wherever he could, he has referred the reader to more ample accounts; and particularly to Wood, where most of the early Scholars elected to Christ Church are to be found. But Wood is the biographer of one University only, and as yet there is no publication similar at the other; but it is to be hoped that this- work will, by holding forth its great men to view in a new light, animate that to publish Athenee Cantabrigienses', and procure a continuation of the Oxonienses. It was the Editor's wish to have made the mention of the stations which the various gentlemen have occupied, as copious as possible; but this also, from the difficulty of obtaining accurate accounts, was a task &x beyond the possibility of his performing; though the stations of them would oftentimes have promoted a pleasing inquiry to the gentlemen who have been educated at Westminster, by tracing their old school-fellows into their distant retirements, where the intrinsic honour of private conduct [1 Joseph Welch lived nearly forty years as assistant to. the Mr. Ginger of that day, and died in 1805. — Nichols's Literary Anecdotes, iz. 38.] ^ For the materials already collated for such a work, see Qough's Topography, Tol. i. p. 219-221. viii ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION. has often equalled the most substantial honours of professional stations in our Cathedrals, or of the first offices in the State. By way of embellishment, two views are here inserted, of the ancient and the present Dormitory. The first of them, erected upon stone arches, was originally built as a granary to the monastery of St Peter; and is here copied firom an original drawing. The history of the present building is as follows: — ^A legacy of 1000/. was given in 1708, for that specific purpose, by Sir Edward Hannes, Knight, physician to Queen Anne. This in 1718 was followed up by a memorial from the then Dean (Bishop Atterbury) and Chapter of Westminster, which obtained from King George I., 1000/.; from King George II. (then Prince of Wales), 600/.; from a parliamentary grant, 1200/.; and 500/. was afterward added by William Morice, Esq. (the Bishop's son-in-law), for liberty from the Church to dispose of his office of High-bailiff. A noble Earl presented the model, and condescended to survey the building; and on the 24th of April, 1722, being West- minster Election Tuesday, the first stone was laid, with the following inscription engraved on it : \" Posuit felicibus (faxit Deus) Auspiciis BiCABDUS Com. de Burungton Architeotus 7 Kal. Maii, 1722.\"^ If this work should ever come to another edition, it is hoped that the gentlemen who now honour it with a place in their libraries, will oblige the Editor by such frirther notices as their researches may obtain, which shall be most respectfully considered before republishing, should the same hand undertake it. March 1, 1788. [> See also pages 276-7.] ADVERTISEMENT TO THE PRESENT EDITION. In sending forth a new edition of \"Welch's List of Scholars,\" a few words appear requisite to explain the motives of the Editor in undertaking a task which he was aware he could hut slowly, and even thus very in- adequately execute. As upwards of half a century had elapsed since the appearance of Welch's hook, it seemed to many persons interested in the School, that the time was come for the puhlication of a new edition, and Mr. Ginger (who fills the situation at the School which his father and grandfather held before him), in compUance with the general demand, set on foot a list of subscribers. Only a few notes, however, had been collected for the work, and no person seemed inclined to enter upon the task of Editor. Anxious for the accomplishment of the work, urged by many of his friends, and encouraged by several persons to whose judgment all defer- ence was due by him, the present Editor consented to undertake the task. From the first, he distinctly stated that other necessary avocations would leave him a comparatively small portion of time to devote to the work, and that, consequently, he could not bind himself to any particular time for its completion. Various circumstances have combined to make snob, a caution more necessary than even he at that time anticipated. His own profession made during several years an increasing demand upon his time; indisposition at more than one period forced him to avoid any additional labours to those of his daily calling; but chiefly, he found the task much more onerous and engrossing than he had expected. He can only say, that to none has the delay been more irksome than to himself; he trusts, indeed, that to the work itself it may not have been without some advantage. For as the value of such a work must mainly depend upon its accuracy, so nothing but a constant reference to books usually found only in public libraries, and a careful comparison of one work with another, can ensure accuracy, where ancient dates and ancient names are concerned, and where the connection of persons (who lived, perhaps, three centuries ago) is to be established with certain facts. A glance at the pages may give some notion of the labour which has been performed; for, ta almost every one of the numerous names which b XIV PREFACE TO THE PRE8E>JT EDITION.

She fixes the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, after the feast of St. Peter and St. Paul*, for the days of examination and election, — names as Electors the Deans of Westminster and Ohrist Church, and tlie Master of Trinity (or deputies duly appointed by them) who are each of them to select a Master of Arts^ from his own college as his coadjutor, to whom> also, the Head Master is to be added. They are directed to make oath in these words : — ^^Deinde septem hii Electores jusjurandum dent se neminem in Discipulom gratis odio, ull&ye animi peitnrbatione rel pnemio advectos, sed earn solum quern, iestimonio conscientisD promoti, maxime idoneum judicayerint electuros.\" She orders that no boy be admitted into St. Peters Oollege before his eighth, nor allowed to remain after his eighteenth year ; she directs the mode of examination and election (specifying open voting), and the writing of Parentelas. As to the number, she says — \" Quamyis cupimus h nostris dlscipulis Westmonasteriensibus ad academias in dict& eollegift quotannis p'moyeri tamen, ne incertus ait omnino numenu, sex ad minimum, videlicet, tres in Ecelenam Ohristi Oxon., et ires in Collegium S.

Bang James's letters, moreover, enjoin the admission of some of the Westminster Scholars to Fellowships, alleging the neglect of this latter rule or the delay in electing tbem imtil the Westminsters had graduated M.A., as the reason why the same success had not attended the Westminsters as at Oxford, where it is said — \" Aded felloes in studio Literarum et Pietatis progressus feoexint ut * * * baud pauci ad varias dignitates Ecdesiasticas, nimirum Doctorat: in singulis Facultatibus, Decana- tus etiam, et Episcopatus pervenerint, quod in eisdem discipulis nostris ad Collegium SanctsQ et Indiyid.

White, Esq. firom the original record in the Rolls Chapel, and the original enrolment there has also been consulted. PREFACE TO THE PRESENT EDITION. XV Tho Letters-Patent conclude with the foUowing stringent injunction, which has been hahitually disregarded during many years, although even of Dr. Bentley, Bishop Newton says (vol. i. of his works, 4to edit, p. 18), ''There are instances of his choosing out of three or four Westminster Scholars, two or three Fellows; and he seldom or never set aside the Senior Westminster, unless he had been guilty of some great misdemeanour.\" ''KoB igitur gratioad cupientoa huic nuJo occurrere et oongnium in ^ parte adhibere remediam, ex gratis nosirft speciali * * * * per presentes volumus et con- cedimus ut dicti discipuli alumni nostri h schold. nostra WestnT. oriund\". et in dictum CoUegium nostrum Sanctas et Individusd Trinitatis juxt^ fonnam pf dictam elect : et fiu^ : scholares ejusdem Oollegii nostri postquam ad gcf^um Baccalauriatus in Artibus ^vencrint cssteris omnibus sui ordinis et Gradus de tempore in tempus jTpetuis fatur temporibua quotaescumq: se occasio obtulerit in qu&yis ElecUone Sodalium ejusdem Gollegii nisi justa et legitima Exceptio Morum Improbitatis aut defectus Eruditionis impediat, p*ferentur et anteponentur ejusdemq: exceptionis judicium volumus esse penes Magistrum et majorem partem Seniorum aut Magistro absente penes Vice- magistrum et majorem partem Seniorum tunc in Electione ibidem p^sentium; quod si contingat dictos discipulos nostros olim Westm. aut eorum aliquem dum Bacca- laureus in Artibus fuerit in numerum Sodalium dicti Oollegii non ellgi et cooptari ante susceptum Gxadum Magisterii in Artibus turn volumus ut ii et eorum quisq: maneant suit et habeantur maneat sit et habeatur eligibiles vel ehgibilis in Soda- litium in dicto Oollegio per biennium completum post dictum Gradum Magisterii in Artibus susceptiun, ac p'ferantur et p'feratur in omni electione cseteris omnibus sui ordinis et Gradus nisi interveniente legitime exceptione sic ut p'feratur opposit: et approbat : £t inviolabiliter fiat mandantes omnibus quorum hoc interest aut interesse debeat vel poterit xTcipud Decano et Canonicis ^dis Ohristi Oxoniensis et Magistro dicti OoUegii nostri SanctsB et Individiun Trinitatis Oantabrigiso Vice Magistro Seni< oribus et Sociis ejusdem Oollegii eorumq : succcssorum omnibus et singulis ut appro- bationem Ratification : Oonfirmation : Yolunt^tem et Ooncessionem banc nostram omniaq : et singula in psentibus content: inviolat: conservent pficiant et exequant'. aliquo Statute constitution : ordinatio : p^nsione aut consuetudine sive ^dis Ohristi sive dicti Oollegii nostri SanctoB et Individuss Trinitatis in contrarium in aliquo vel aJiquibus non obstant: Et hoc omnibus quorum interest aut interesse debeat aut poterit Innotescimus per p'sentes.\" The general spirit of the regulations for the mode of election made by our Royal ^Benefactress is preserved at this day ; for the present mode of ad- mission on the foundation is by a competition which demands the exercise of considerable industry, and in many cases of considerable tolent, in such of the candidates as attain the highest places. The term of residence for the Scholars, after their admission, is four, and in some instances five, years, at which period they are again subjected to an examination before they are elected oflf (as the phrase is) to Oxford or Cambridge. The days of election have been changed to the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in Rogation week. On the Tuesday a dinner is given to the Electors, and all persons connected with tho School, by tho Dean and Chapter, and any Old West- XVI PREFACE TO THE PRESENT EDITION. minster of sufficient rank or standing is entitled to attend it. After the dinner Epigrams are spoken by a large proportion of the King's Scholars. It is now time to conclude this Preface, and to dismiss this work to the judgment of such as feel a sufficient interest in Westminster School to dip into its pages. The Editor cannot do so without again requesting a merciful judgment from Old- Westminsters, on the labours which he has performed : labours, which, indeed, will be well repaid, if (inadequately as he is sensible that the task has been accompUshed) he shall have succeeded in showing that the School has sent forth her proportion, and sometimes more than her pro- portion, of eminent persons ; and that her institutions, if properly under- stood and acted upon, are still calculated to produce the great object of such foundations, the training up of persons duly qualified to serve God and their Country both in Church and State. More especially will his work have been successful, if, by displaying the advantages which have been derived in former times from the right use of an education on this foundation, he shall have raised in the Queen's Scholars of this, or of any future day, the laudable ambition of emulating the conduct of such of their predecessors whose ex- amples,— ^whether as theologians, scholars, mathematicians, poets, warriors, or statesmien, — have been worthy of imitation, and of being privileged to confer similar benefits in their generation upon their country. The hope of such a result has been the Editor s great encouragement, and his chief aim, through- out the work; and he will only add, in conclusion, the words which the German dramatist puts into the mouth of a famous poet : — \" fSad id) gewoUt ift \\hhX\\&it loenn bad 3iel 2Cud) meinen JCr&ften unerreic^bac blieb/ ;Cn Sleif unb ^fxlijt ^at ed nid^t gefe^U.\" * JvsB, 1852. * « The plan is laudable, e'en though the aim My humble pow*r may ne'er at length attain.

January 29, 1513; waa elected presi- dent of Magdalen about the 17th of December, 1516; resigned that charge Nov. 6, 1525, and was appointed dean of Cabdinal Collegb. On the dis- grace of Cardinal Wol^y, in October, 1529, his col- lege lapsed to the King, and was kept by him until 1532, when he founded it again upon the same site, though on a less princely scale, by the name of \" KniQ Hkhbt th« Eighth, his College.\" Dr. Hygden was nominated the first dean of this foundation also, but he did not long survive the change : He was buried in the chapel of Mag- dalen College, where he had founded a perpe- tual exhibition for eight students; a &ct recorded on his monument, which also states him to have died January 13, 1532-3. His name frequently appears in the Oxford annals as one of Cardinal Wolsey's commissioners for the supjftession of heretiod opinions in the University. — Fasti Ox. i. 88 ; Hist, and Antiq. ii. 28. 31. 33 and 58 ; iii. 315. 832. 422. 428 and 437.] « J.

[A civil lawyer of very great eminence ; D.C.L. of Oxford, June 23, 1522, and admitted one of the college of advo- cates at Doctors' Commons, November 11, in the same year : In 1527, he is found to have resigned the rectory of St. Mary Mountlow, London, and, in 1529, was made vicar of Minster, in the Isle of Thanet, by the abbot and convent of St. Augustine, at Canterbury. In 1530, he was, says Wood, \"an active man, and one of the commissioners for the deprivingof Heth (Heath), Bishop of Worcester, and Day, Bishop of Chichester.\" He was employed on various other commissions of importance ; in 1540, he was, with some other lawyers, consulted by the Convocation which decided against the va- lidity of Henry the Eighth's marriage with Anne of Cleves. He was one of the two lawyers at- tached to Lord Northampton's embassy to f^nce in 1551, when that nobleman carried over the Garter to the French King, and proposed a marriage between Edward the Sixth and the Princess Eliza- beth, eldest daughter of that monarch. Strype Sives the warrant for his pay of four marks a day uring this employment. In this year too he was employed in the commission which deprived Bishop Gardiner of the See of Winchester. He succeeded Dr. Hygden as dean of Christ Church in February, 1532-3 ; and Wood asserts that he also succeeded him as prebendary of York, but, according to Willis, this is not correct He did, however, hold a prebendal stall in the cathedral of Salisbury. The foundation at Christ Church was again changed by Henry YIIL, in 1545, when the dean and canons gave up all their lands, revenues, &c., to the King, and obtained instead a yearly pension. Dr. Olyver's pension amounted to £70. Dr. Olyver died in London, in the civiliafts' college at Doctors' Commons, about May, 1552; and is supposed by Willis to have been buried in St Paul's Cathedral.— Fasti Ox. i. 60. 94 ; Hist, and Antiq. iii. 429 and 487 ; Willis's Cath.

His selec- tion for it was probably owing to bribes given to offi- cers of the king*s household ; and other traits are reUted of his character which show that he was not over scrupulous in such matters. During his presidency there were two important exchanges of huid between the king and the convent, by which the Utter, besides parting with the advowson of Chelsea rectory, and some meadows near the Horseferry, alienated Co vent Garden : On the 16th of January, 1539-40, the monastery itself was given up to the king by the abbot and twenty- four monka Benson died in September, 1540, and was interred in the Abbey, near the Vestry.] —Vide Widmore's Westminster Abbey, 126>38. ' A. NOW ELL (see Redman), prebendary of Westminster 1551 and 1560; dean of St. Paul's, 1561 ; canon of Windsor, 1594 ; principal of Erase- nose College, 1 595 ; died, 1601. [Dean Nowell was a Lancaslure person, sent to school at Middleton, in that county, and thence removed to Brasenose Col- lege, Oxford, as it is said, at the age of 13 ; took the degrees of B.A. in 1536, and of M.A. 1540. He was chosen fellow of his college, and *' grew very fiunous for religion and learning.\" In 1553, he was honoured in a remarkable manner by being returned to Parliament for St. Looe, Cornwall, but was not allowed to sit, as being represented as a irebendary of Westminster in the Convocation. n 1554 he was deprived of his stall at West- minster, and narrowly escaped with his life ; for, as Fuller says, \" whilst Nowel was catching of Fishes, Bonner was catching of Nowel ;'' a timely warning was given him while engaged in that amusement, and he fled to Germany. On his return, after the accession of Elizabeth, he was made archdeacon of Middlesex, 1560, and, in that year, again appointed to a prebendal stall at West- minster, which he held till 1564. He was also rector of Saltwood, Kent, 1560, and of Much Hadham, Herto, from 1562 to 1589. He was noiftinated likewise to a stall at Canterbury, and held another at St Paul's, firom 1559 until 1588. Dean Nowell was prolocutor of the celebrated convocation for settling the ritual and doctrine of the Church of England in 1562. In 1589, the Queen gave him the next present- ation to a canonry in Windsor^ but it did not fiill vacant until 1594. On the 1st of October,1595, he was actually created D.D., at Oxford ; he resigned S the headship of Brasenose, December 4, 1595, hav- ing only held it since the 6th of September. After he was settled in the deanery of St. Paul's, he became a frequent and *' painful preacher,\" and ** for thirty years he preached the first and last sermons in the time of Lent before the Queen, wherein he dealt plainly and fitithfully with her, without dislike,\" except, indeed, on one occasion, when she called aloud to him \" to retire from that ungodly digression, and to return to his text.\" He died on the 13th of Febniary, 1601-2, and was' buried in St. Paul's, where, \"a comely monu- ment\" was erected to his memory. Strype gives the following accounl of NoweU's method of education : — \" When he was master of Westminster School, he brought in the reading of Terence, for the better learning the pure Roman style. As it was said of Dr. Barnes, that he brought in that author and Tully into his college of Augustin's at Cambridge, instead of barbarous Duns andDorbel ; and one day every week Terence gave way to St. Luke's Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles ; which he read in Greek to such of his schoUirs as were almost at man's estate; whereof he had a good number. Whereby he prepared himself in some way for the teaching of God's people in his church : whereunto he had directed his intent since he was sixteen years old.\" Thus it is to this eminent divine that West- minster owes that instructive and cUssical re- creation, so peculiar to herself, the annual repre- sentation of one of Terence's Plays — a custom which Queen Elisabeth rendered obligatory by an express statute, — \"quo juventus tum actioni tum pronunciationi decenti melius se assues- cat,\" as the queen herself expressed it, when she enforced its observance every Christmas, by a penalty on those who should cause its neglect The strong feeling of the great body of Old Westminsters in favour of this ancient custom, when a proposal was made for abolishing it, was embodied in a petition to the Dean, presented by the Marquis of Lansdowne, in 1847, and the ready concurrence of all the authorities connected with the school in the prayer of that petition lead to the sanguine expectation that there will not again be any attempt to interfere with an institu- tion established under such pious and learned au- spices,—interwoven, as it were, with the very foun- dation of the school, — ^and which has had its share in contributing to the credit and character it has so long enjoyed. Dean Nowell was the author of several learned theological works. His Catechism was one of the books which the Convocation ordered to be studied in the university, to \" preserve the scholars from the heresy of Romanism.\" He left a bene- Dcauu of Westmhutcr.

[A native of Buckinghamshire, of low ex- traction ; educated at Eton, whence he was elected a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, in 1519, and took the degree of B.A. In 1525, he went to Oxford, and was appointed a Junior Canon of Oszdlnal Wolse/s college, and, in the same year, incorporated in the degree of B.A., at which time, we are told, he was esteemed an excellent scholar ; he was licensed to proceed M.A., Feb. 8, 1525, and did do so in an act celebrated July 1526. About this time, he was known to have imbibed the doctrines of the Beformation, and, for that cau^e, was compelled to leave Oxford. A little while after this he took refage at Eton, where, we are told, \" by his diligent instruction the boys profited much.\" He was incorporated at Cambridge in the deffree of M.A., which he had taken at Oxford. In 1535, he proceeded B.D. at Cambridge, being then chaplain to Goodrich, Bishop of Ely. In 1537, he proceeded D.D., and, in 1543, did supplicate that he might take his place among the Doctors of Divinity at Oxford, though he was not regularly incorporated in that degree until June, 1545. He was appointed archdeacon of Ely December 4, 1540, and, September 10, 1541, first prebendary of that cathedral ; he held both these benefices until his de- privation in the reign of Queen Mary ; — was pre- bendary of Sutton, one of the richest prebends in Lincoln Cathedral, from 1542 to 1547, in which year he alienated it to the crown ; he did the same by the rectory of Harrow on the Hill, to which he was presented in 1544. In 1548, he was designated for the new Bishopric which Henry VIII. intended to create at Southwell. He re- signed the Chancellorship of the University of Oxford, November 14, 1652, and was exempted from the duties of yice-Chancellor. During Queen Mary's reign he suffered for his adherence to the Beformation, and was imprisoned from the 5th to the 19th of August, 1553, after which he retired to Frankfort, where he became leader of the party in fovour of the English Liturgy of Edward VI. against John Knox. He returned to England on the accession of Elizabeth, and supported the Queen in her retention of the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England, and was by her nominated the principal disputant in a conference to be held with the Romish cleigy. In June, 1559, he was elected Bishop of Norwich, but was translated to Ely before his consecration. He was nondnated a privy councillor about the year 1547. Bishop Cox died July 22, 1581, and was in- terred in Ely Cathedral He was a very learned man, but one of great worldliness. He surren- dered the beautiful cathedral of Osney, besides the other preferments mentioned before, to Henry VIIL, and, indeed, according to Willis, he alienated, without scruple, to the crown, the richest portions of the benefices which he held ; there was hardly one which was not the poorer for his occupancy: Tet, Fuller asserts that he \"commendably continued in his See, whatever causeless malice hath reported to the contrary.\" He had a great hand in framing the first Liturgy of the Church of England, and in reviewing it in the reign of Elizabeth ; but Strype says that he \"liked its original form but little.\" He also trans- lated the Gk>spels, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Epistle to the Eomans, and was the author of many other works in print ; and a list of six, which he left in MS., is given by Dr. Bliss. A stigma, which it would require many good deeds to wipe off, attaches itself to his name, as he was one of the most active of those who, in their zeal against Popery, destroyed with ruthless hands the ancient MSS. in the libraries at Oxford. He is also noted as the first person who brought a wife into Christ Church. He left by his will charitable bequests to the poor of various places. — Ath.

[Of a fjamily of that name in Yorkshire, and near of kin to br. Cuthbert Tunstall, Bishop of Durham, by whose counsel and advice, says Anthony i Wood, \" he became conversant from his childhood in the study of leambg.\" He began this study at Corpus Chnsti College, Oxford, on its first found- ation ; after which he went to Paris, and studied there until he was 21 years of age. On his return to England he settled at St. John's College, Cambridge, where he was a pupil of Sir Thomas Smith's, and of which he became one of the fellows, 1531. The dates of his degrees are B.A. 1525-6, M.A. 1530, B.D. 1634, D.D. 1537 ; be was subse- quently appointed master of King's Hall, Michael House, Cambridge, and, upon the suppression of that house, was nominated the first master of the new foundation of Trinity College ; public orator to the University, 1587 ; Margaret professor of divinity from about 1588 to about 1542, and again in 1549; rector of Calverton, Bucks, 1548 ; archdeacon of Stafford from 1540 to 1647; arch- deacon of Taunton, and prebendary of Wells, 1547. He died November 4, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where an epitaph, in Hexameter and Pentameter Latin verse, was placed on his monument, which has, however, been long since effaced. On his death-bed, he sent for Alexander Nowell (see above), and delivered to him his last judgment on several points of religion, which confession, being chiefly a renunciation of the errors of the Romish fiiith, Nowell afterwards published in the shape of articles, and had it subscribed by those who had with him heard the words of Redman, delivered, it is said, *' for the confirming of Noel's fiaith.\" Besides the eulogium on his learning, quoted above from Ascham's Schoolmaster, Wood says, that '* by his profound knowledge in the tongues, humanity and divinity, he obtained many admirers, and thereby gained prpselytes, to the great advan- tage and refinemont of the Greek and Latin tongues in the University of Cambridge ;\" and Strype calls him ''one of the solidestand best read divines in the land, to whose judgment greatdeference was paid by all.\" He dissented, however, from many parts of the Common Prayer Book. — Cole's Athenae, R. 11, MSS. xlv. 124. 225. 229; AtL Ox. i. 193-4; Strype's Memorials, IL i. 134.

He had not been two full years standing at B.D., when he was chosen master of St John's College, and was appointed to that office in conse- quence of letters sent down to Cambridge in his favour by Protector Somerset ; he resigned it in 1561, when he was removed to Trinity College. In 1 548 he filled the office of vice-chancellor to the University. He was one of Edward the Sixth's chaplains and itinerary preachers, and received a small annuity from the King. He was one of the chaplains to whom the Articles of Religion were referred for revision, in 1662. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth he was the first divine appointed by her to preach in public, and, in 1558, was one of the Spital preachers. He was made chief almoner to the Queen, and much employed and consulted upon matters of religion ; was one of those directed to prepare a book of divine service, and, in 1659, was in a commission for visiting the University of Cambridge and College of Eton; and in another, in 1560, which settled a new calendar and Lessons. In 1559, he was made a prebendary of Lincoln, and on the 5tli of July, in that year, was unanimously chosen, first, fellow, and then, provost, of Eton ; and shortly after that became the first dean on the new foundation of Queen Eli- zabeth ; a solitary instance of a person presiding at the same time over three such seminaries of learn- ing as Westminster, Eton, and Trinity.

WESTON, rector of Lincoln College, 1 538 ; Margaret professor of divinity [at Oxford, 1540 ;] and archdeacon of Colchester [1553]; dean of Windsor, 1566; deprived of his deanery [by Cardinal Pole], 1557 ; a noted preacher and orator of his time; died, 1558. [He was at first a student of Baliol CoU^e, Oxford, but took his degrees in arts at Lincoln College ; applied himseS to the study of physic, but, after his elec- tion to the presidency of his college, he took the degree of B.D. May 3, 1539. In the first year of Queen Mary's reign he was made prolocutor of the Convocation of the whole clergy of Can- terbury, and is said to \" have behaved himself in speaking ^d acting with great commendation ;\" was instituted rector of CliU', Kent, 1554, upon letters from the Queen to that effect. He was also rector of St. Botolph s, Bishop^gate-street, from 1543 until his death. He unwillingly consented to the collegiate es- tablishment of Westminster being again converted into a monastery, and, upon that change, received the deanery of Windsor. Cardinal Pole suspended him from that station for immorality of life, of which, whether justly or not, he viras generally accused ; and, as Weston was preparing for a journey to Rome to appeal against such deprivation, he was taken prisoner, and sent to the Tower, whence he was released on bail, and died in the house of a fnend in Fleet Street, in December, 1558, and was buried in the Savoy. He was a person of learning and much boldness, and was much employed by the court to preach and to attend state criminals in Queen Mary's reign. He presided as Mode- rator at Oxford in April, 1554, in the disputa- tion held there between Cranmer, Latimer, and Ridley, and the popish divines of the Romish fisiith, and printed an account of this controversy, as well as one or two other works. — Ath.

[Some time Fellow of Corpus Christi College, and then student of Christ Church; of which house he became B.D. ; and afterwards, in 1552, D.D. ; was chapl^ to Lord Arundell, through whose influence he obtained his preferment, and Newcourt sup- poses him to be the Richard Marshal who was made a prebendary of St. Paul's, 1539. He is accused of having changed from Romanist to Reformer, and Reformer to Romanist, as often as suited his purpose ; by his last adherence to the Reformation, on the accession of Elizabeth, he had hoped to preserve his deanery, and would have done so, but for his violent conduct on the side of Papacy during the former reign. He served the office of Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the University in 1551, 1552, and of Vice- Chancellor in 1553. In 1559, refusing to ac- knowledge the authority of the Queen's visitors, he was carried up to London and imprisoned, and was also deprived of his stall at Winchester, for refusing the oath of supremacy. He subscribed strongly, Strype says, on St Thomas's Day, 1568, and would have given a more public testimony in St Paul's had not his death prevented it Some have said that his death occurred in Yorkshire ; but Strype inclines to the belief that he died in confinement m London. — Fasti Ox. i. 136 ; Hist, and Antiq. ii. 141. iii. 438, and Appx. 91-3; Strype's Annals, I. ii. 118 ; Milner's Hibt of Winchester, 368; Newcourt's Rep. i. 185.] DeaQ»>of Westminster.

A very learned man, by the confession of all parties, and reckoned by Graunt to have been one of the first revivers of the (}reek tongue, and a great orna- ment to the university to which he belonged. In King Edward's reign he retired to Qermany, on account of his religious opinions, and was there maintained by his college. He employed his exile in transkting into Latin several of the works of Philo Judieus and Eusebius, which were afterwards published. He had at an earlier date, about 1546, published the tragedy of Jeptha in Latin and Greek. Upon his return he was appointed confessor to Queen Mary; in 1554, he published an exhortation against rebellion ; and, in 1557, was made one of Cardinal Pole's delegates for visiting the Uni- versity of Cambridge; proceeded D.D. He is said to havfe condemned to the stake several persons in his diocese. Consequently, on the acces- sion of Queen Elisabeth, he was deprived of his preferments; and, dying in London, was buried in Christ Church, in the city, according to Strype, with all popish ceremonies, December 15,1558. He be- queathed forty shillings to the poor of his native place, and was a benefiictor to Trinity College, especially to the master's lodgings and library, and it was he who persuaded Queen Mary to confer her benefiictions, and among them the vicarage of Ken- dal, upon that society.— Cole'sMSS. xlv. 225, xlix. 392, Athenae C. 80; Strype's Annals, i. 46; Bloomfield's Norfolk, iii. 618; Ath.

He was called Feck- enham from his birth-place, Feckenham Forest, Worcestershire : his right name was Howman ; pre- bendary and dean of St Paul's, 1554 ; a learned man, and one of the disputants at Oxford against Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, before they suffered martyrdom; died, 1585.— Biographia Britannica, iii. 1909. [Fakenham was originally a Benedic- tine monk of Evesham, and, Anthony a Wood says, \" held in wonderful esteem for his learning, piety, charity, and other virtues.\" Although he was one of the ablest disputants on behalf of the Romish tenets, he always strove to protect the Reformers from violence, and did them all the good offices in his power during the reign of Queen Mary, whose displeasure he incurred by interceding for her sister Elizabeth. At eighteen years old he was sent by the Abbot of Evesham to Gloucester College, in which was a particular establishment for the young monks of Evesham : after the usual residence he was recalled to the monastery, and remained there until its dissolution in November, 1535, when he was dismissed with a pension, and took refuge again in Gloucester College ; he was made chaplain to Dr. Bell, Bishop of Worcester, and afterwards to Dr. Bonner, Bishop of London ; proceeded B.D. of Gloucester College, 1539. He was committed to the Tower in 1549 ; but was released soon after, that he might dispute with the Protestants, and, when these discussions were ended, was again sent to prison, until Queen Mary's accession. That Queen made him her chaplain, and employed him much to preach in noted places, and to carry on disputes with the Protestants. He was preben- da^ of Kentish Town in St Paul's Cathedral, January, 1554 ; appointed rector of Finchley, 1 554 ; held it only a few months, and, in September of the same year, was made rector of Greenford, Middlesex: actually created D.D. in his absence, 1556, and in November of that year appointed ab- bot of Westminster, and chaplain to the Queen. Abbot de Feckenham was the last mitred abbot who sat in Parliament ; he sat in the House of Lords in the first Parliament of Queen Elizabeth^ 1558, and opposed the Bill declaring the Queen s supremacy, and that for giving the first fruiu to the Crown ; Strype affirms that he had taught the Deaiu of Westminster.

He published, and left in MS., which is still extant, an account of some of his conferences, two speeches in the House of Lords, and several funeral sermons and works on polemics and theo- logy. Feckenham behaved liberally to the church at Westminster, leaving it what he had, and giving the dean much advantageous information about the leases : whilst he was dean, he repaired the Shrine of Edward the Confessor, and provided a Paschal candle of 800 lbs. in weight, at the making of which the master and warden of the Wax Chandlers' Company attended ; he also strongly maintained the privilege of sanctuary, and a speech of his on that point is preserved in the archives of the Bodleian. Fuller says, that he was \" found setting of elms in the orchard of Westminster Abbey,\" and was so employed when Queen Elizabeth first sent for him, and he finished his pkntation before he obeyed the summons.

[A dean remarkable as well for his learning as for his care of, and bene&ctions to, the school during the forty years he presided over the chapter. \" Goodman was his name, and goodness was his nature,\" says Fuller with his usual quaintness. Dean Goodman was the son of Edward Good- man, Esq., and educated at St. John's College, Cambridge, of which he became D.D. During the reign of Queen Mary he lived obscurely, but did not go into exile. He was chaplain to Secre- tary Cecil, or tutor to his children ; at all events much beloved and trusted by him. At his re- commendation he was promoted, first to a stall in this cathedral, and then to the deanery, Sept. 28, 1661; and in the following Lent was ap- pointed one of the preachers before the Queen ; was a member of the Convocation of 1662, and subscribed the Thirty-nine Articles therein agreed to : he voted in that assembly against any change in the Book of Common Prayer. Dean Goodman was rector of the first portion of Waddesdon, Bucks, 1669, and of the second, 1669, and held both until 1582. He was also prebendar}' of Chiswick, in St Paul's Cathedral, and \"procured,\" Widmore says, \" to have this church settled the perpetual tenant of the estate of that prebend, that, in case of any pestilential or epidemical sickness, there might be a place in the neighbour- hood for some of the chapter, with the masters of the school, and the scholars of the foundation, to retire to.\" Fuller's account of this transaction is, that Goodman \" purchased a &ir house, with land thereunto, at Chiswick, in Middlesex, where with his own hands he set a &ir row of elms, now grown up to great beauty and height, for a retiring place for the masters and scholars of Westminster, in the heat of summer, or any time of infection.\" \" If,\" he adds, \" these lands at this day be not so profitably employed as they were by the donor piously intended, it is safer to moan the sad effect than accuse the causers thereof.\" He endeavoured more than once to procure the royal assent to the statutes drawn up by his pre- decessor, Dr. Bill, for the management of the abbey and the college, and also to restore the statute of Elizabeth, which enjoined the election of three scholars every year, instead of two every year and three every third year, — an alteration which Archbishop Wbitgift, then master of Trinity, had obtained leave to make. Whitgift's other alteration, viz., of the day of election, he wished to maintain, as it was formerly fixed for the same day as the Cambridge commencement. Re- ferring to the lists, he does not seem to have effected any improvement in this respect until 1588. The Lord Treasurer Cecil made him one of his executors, to distribute large sums in charity. One of these was a perpetual annuity of twenty marks yearly, to be distributed among the scholars elected from this foundation to the two univer- sities. Dr. Goodman, in 1566, successfully defended the right of this church to afford sanctuary for debt, against a bill brought into Parliament for taking it away. The dean was not only heard by counsel, but himself spoke on the occasion. He was recommended by the Archbishops Parker and Whitgift for several vacant bishoprics. He trans- lated the Bible into Welsh at his own cost. He was buried in St. Bonnet's Chapel, Westminster Abbey, and a representation of him, on his knees, affixed to his monument, on the south wall of that chapel. Four of his name are mentioned in the early part of this work. Two of them, it will be seen, came from the dean's own country, and were doubtless his relations.

SAMPSON, dean of Chichester, 1552 ; re- moved from his deaneiy of Christ Church for Nonconformity, 1 564 ; afterwards appointed master of Wigston's Hospital, Leicestershire ; and pre- bendary of St. Paul's [1570]; died 1589. [Was educated at Oxford, and afterwards a student of law in one of the Temples, and, during his re- sidence in the latter society, was converted from the Romish Church, and became a strong Puritan. He was, however, ordained by Bishop Ridley, in 1550, being well known to, and esteemed by, that prelate and by Archbishop Cranmer. Even at his ordination he excepted against the habits of ceremonies prescribed by the Church of England. From 1551, until his nomination to the deanery of Chichester, he was rector of All Hallows, Bread-street, in London, and acquired much &roe as a preacher. At the accession of Queen Mary he was obliged to fly with his wife, who was a niece of Bishop Latimer, to foreign parts, re- sided at Strasburff, and was one of those divines who undertook the translation of the Bible into English ; but. Queen Mary dying before the greater part was finished, they abandoned their task, and returned to England. In 1560, he is said to have declined an offer of the bishopric of Norwich. During the first, three years of Queen Elizabeth's reign he preached frequently, and with reputation, in London and some of the northern counties, having been nominated to ac- company the Queen's visitors to those districts as preacher. He was appointed to Christ Church at the request of that society, conveyed to the Queen through Lord Robert Dudley. Although it is not clearly shown that he ever took a degree at Oxford, yet, in 1561, after his appointment to the deanery of Christ Church, he obtained leave to preach within the limits of the University in a doctoral habit for one year. At that time he and his friend. Dr. Humphrey, the president of Mag- dalen, who held the same puritanical notions as himself, were almost the only preachers in Oxford. In consequence of this gift of preaching, as well as for his general piety and learning, he was much entreated by many of the bishops, and by Lord Burleigh, to conform ; and it was only upon his pertinacious refusal to do so, and after many ad- monitions, that he was deprived in 1564. By the Queen's permission he was appointed Theological Lecturer of Whittington's College, London, and continued to give lectures for nearly six years, when his health was much affected by a stroke of palsy, and he retired to the hospital at Leicester, to which he had been appointed in 1567, and which, together with his stall at St. Paul's, he was allowed to retain until his death, which oc- curred April 9, 1589, at the age of 72 ; he was buried in the chapel of Wigston's Hospital, and a monument there erected to him, setting forth his hostility to the Church of Rome. He was con- tinually urging upon Lord Burleigh the reforma- tion of the English Church. With more praise- worthy perseverance he obtained from that states- man a reward for the merchant, Mr. Heton (the father of Bishop Heton, see election, 1571), to whose kindness he, and so many other English divines, were indebted for assistance during the troubles of the last reign. He was the author of several theological tracts, and several of his letters are given in Strype. — Ath.

Being molested in the college for his inclination to the doctrines of the Reformation, he vacated his fellowship, on being presented by that society to the charge of the school at Bzackley, Northampton- ahire. During the reign of Qoeen Mary, he was silenced, and forced to study physic to maintain himself and his family, to which end he took the degree of B.M. 1555. On the accession of Elisabeth, he was ordained and made chaplain to Bishop Bullyii^bam, by whom he was appointed to preach seven! times before the queen, who, in June, 1569, conferred on him the deanery of Christ Church, which he resigned on his promo- tion to Canterbury. He accumubited the degrees of B. and D.D., 1565. In 1565, he was nomi- nated a prebendary of Lincoln, a benefice which he gave itp in 1588 ; on his promotion to the see of Wells, he gave up the deanery of Canterbury, having, in 1570, repaired the buildings of that preferment. He was at one time in great &vottr with Queen Elisabeth, and, for eighteen years, had always preached before her in Lent ; but he fell into disgrace at the suggestion of Sir Walter Raleigh (Who was anxious to obtain long leases of the episcopal lands), on account of a second mar* riage which he had made. He is represented as mild, leafUed, charitable and judicious; and therefore Wood adds, it is \"not to be doubted, but when he lost t^is life, he won heaven.\" He died at Oakingham, whither he had removed by the advice of his physicians, on the 19th of November, 1590; he was buried there, and had a monument erected to him by his son Francis, afterwards \"Bishop of Hereford, the fiunous anuquarian.

Coaper, or Cooper, was bom in Oxford, and bred there, hatinff commenced his education in the school adjoinmg St Mary Magdalen College, of which house he was a chorister ; took the degree of B.A., and was chosen Probationary Fellow, 1539, and Perpetual Fellow in the year follow- ing ; M.A. 1543; — ^made master of the School at Magdalen College; — resigned his fellowship, 1546 ; studied medicine, arid proceeded M.B. 1566 ; he practised that science during the reign of Queen Mary, but, on the accession of Elisabeth, re' turned to the study of divinity ; add accumulated his degrees in that branch of learning in 1566. He was presented to the deanery of Christ Church, April 28, in the following year; he kept the deanery of Gloucester but a few months. In 1573/ C 10 he procured his own nomination to a prebendal stall at Lincoln^ which he held in commendam with the see until 1581; Mr. Willis records the hci as the first instance in this cathedral of such a singular nomination^ and is at a loss to account for its occurrence. Cooper*s rast erudition and industry, and also his piety and integrity, caused him to be much esteemed and respected. He published \" Thesaurus Linguas Eomanae et Britannics/' called Cooper's Dictionary, compiled on the foundation of Sir Thomas Eliot's Dic- tionary, and several other works, chiefly on prac- tical and controyersial diyinity. He died April 29, 1594, at Winchester, and was buried in the cathedral there, where there is a flat marble grave- stone to his memory; the inscription on which gives him the designation of \" Munificentissimus, doc- tissimus, vigikntissimus pnesul.\" It may be noticed that it was in his time that Lord Leicester, being chancellorof the University, assumed the power of nominating the commissary, — as the chancellor's deputy was then called, — and Dean Cooper was the first commissary whose designation was changed to that of vice-chancellor, a title which he assumed 1569. — Ath.

[The last, and perhaps the most distinguished, of the three divines, whom Queen Elizabeth raised to the primacy — her WkUe-Qift, as she called him; a pun repeated in the following couplet, — ** Sic Xiv»«)«^«v te prsestas, nomine, reque, Candorem gestans ore, animo, ingenio.*' He was of an ancient and respectable descent : His fiither, Henry Whitgift, was a merchant at Great Grimsby, in Lincolnshire. John, the eldest of six sons, was bom in Yorkshire, 1530 ; his early education was intrusted to his uncle, Bobert Whitgift, who was Abbot of WeUow, in the first-named county ; a choice which greatly influenced the course of the future archbishop ; for this abbot is said to have been so deeply sen- sible of the corrupt manners of the clergy and hity of the Bonush Church, as to have foretold from them the blow which she received in England. John Whitgift's distaste for Bomish ceremo- nies was early manifested; for, on being com- mitted to the care of an aunt, in St. Paul's Churchyard, during his stay at St. Anthony's School, a seminary then, and for long before, held in great esteem, he positively refund to attend mass at St Paul's, and was, in consequence, dis- missed by his relative. He was sent to Cam- bridge, and entered first at Queen's College, 1548, but removed afterwards to Pembroke Hall, of which Bishop Bidley was then master ; and where Bradford — also a martyr — was his tutor, and Grindal, a fellow; B.A. 1584; M.A. 1557. Chosen, in 1555, a fellow of Peterhouse, he found a true friend in Dr. Peme, the master, wh<r stopped him from quitting the country in the reign of Queen Mary, and defended him firom ther fiery clutches of Cardinal Pole when he visited the University. He became president of thi* college under Dr. Peme; was ordained 1560; B.D. 1568 ; D.D. 1567 ;— admitted to the master- ship of Trinity, July, 1667 ; — served the office of vice-chancellor to the University in 1570 and in 1573. In December, 1568, he was made ch^lain to Bishop Coxe, rector of Teversham, Cambridge- shire, and prebendary of Ely. He resigned Tever- sham in 1572 ; in that year he was chosen pro- locutor of the Convocation. He was promoted to the deanery of Lincoln, 1571 ; and, in the fol- lowmg year, a prebendal stall in the same cathedral was aidded to that dignity: he resigned all his preferments upon his appointment to Worcester ;> and was consecrated bishop of that see at Lam- beth, April 21, 1 577. \" And thus,\" says Strype, \" from being a chief honour and stay of learning, in the University, he was called out to serve and govern the Church.\" The bishop remained master of Trinity College until June, when, as a mark of respect to one who had done so much for them, the University, represented by the heads of houses, and a numerous train of scholars, accompanied him from Cambridge, on his journey towards his new diocese. He had the credit of leaving in a very quiet state his college, which, when he took the charge of it, he had found very disorderly. He was likewise made vice-president of the Marches of Wales, and, in that capacity, gave forther proofs of his talents for governing. He had before been celebrated for his management of his colleges and of the University ; in the latter he was the great restorer of discipline and order, which was then at a very low ebb. In token of his merit the salary of the Lady Margaret Professor was raised during his occupancy of the chair. He moved for, and obtained leave to compile, new statutes for the University in 1 570; and about this time his famous and long-protracted controversy with Cartwright began. The latter was removed frt>m the Margaret professorship in 1570, though he retained his fellowship, which he vacated, from neglecting to take orders, in 1572. Archbishop Whitgift was noted for his primi- tive manners, his singleness of mind, and the patience of his disposition ; and although royal fiivonrs were showered plentifully on him they did not corrupt the purity of his character. Fuller calls him \" one of the worthiest men the English hierarchy ever did enjoy.\" He was a great encourager of learning, and a benefiictor to learned men, not in England only, but also in* foreign parts. His mild and moderate behaviour is said to have won many persons from the errors of the Bomish fidth. He showed himself a staunch defender of the rights and liberties of the clergy ; and has the* great merit of having stopped the sale and pur- chase of places in the University over which he presided. He was a benefiictor to Trinity College, by the gift of many MS. volumes of rare value. To* 11 Oanuorwertminatw. DemsofCbriBt Church. MMten of Trinity CoUege.

He ¥ras sworn a privy councillor in February 1585. When his predecessor at Canterbury fell into, disgrace at court, the queen offered the see to him, but he refused to accept it, though pressed by Grindal to do so, until after the latter prelate's death. Also, on the death of the Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas Bromley, in 1587, Whitgift was offered the seals by Queen Elizabeth, and, upon his re- fusal of them, they were given, at his recom- mendation, to Sir Christopher Hatton. The archbishop was the chief mourner at the queen's funeral; he also crowned her successor, and, of course, took a prominent part in the con- ference between the Conformists and Nonconform- iats, before King James, at Hampton Court, in January, 1604, where it is said that he spake most gravely. He did not long survive this con- ference, but died February 29,~of a palsy, brought on by going in his barge to attend a meeting of bishops at Fulham, — and was interred at Croydon, where there is a monument in remembrance of him.

[Two parishes in the city of London claim the honour of being the birth-place of the Learned William Cambden, or Camden; for he was bom May 2, 1551, in the Old Bailey, which is partly in the parish of St. SepulcBre's, and partly in diat of St. Martin's, Ludgate. His father was Sampson Camden, a native of Lich- field, but a citizen and painter-stainer of London. He received the rudiments of his great learning in the new-founded school of Christ's Hospital, whence he was removed to St. Paul's School In 1566, he was placed in Magdalen College as a servitor, and perfected himself in grammar learn- ing in the school, under the tuition of Dr. Thos. Cooper (see page 9). Having friled to obtain a demy's place, he betook himself for two years and a half to Broadgates Hall, under Dr. ThonitMi, canon of Christ Church, who invited him to Christ Church, and entertained him there during the remainder of his residence in the University. Camden had been brought up in the reformed religion, and was very faithful to that creed ; his steady adherence to it at this time lost him his election at All Souls, where he was opposed by all the Bomish fellows. In 1571, he withdrew ' fi»m Oxford, to which he returned for a short time in 1573. Dean Goodman (see page 7) gave him mach assistance in his studies, as did also the dean's nephew, Godfrey, the fiither of him who was elected to Cambridge in 1599, and it was by Dr. Godfrey Goodman's recommendation that he received, in 1575, the appointment of Second Master, which was changed to that of Head Mas- ter in March, 1592-3. In 1610, he was ap- pointed Historian to the newly formed college at Chelsea. He published, in 1597, \" Institutio Graecae Grammaticae compendiaria in Usum Schols Eegiss Westmonasteriensis.\" This grammar has been through more than a hundred editions.

Petri Westmonasterii sepulti usque ad 1600.\" Bat the first edition of his most celebrated work — ^his Britannia — appeared before any of his other writings ; he devoted all the energies of his cultivated mind, and all the strength of his bodily frame, to the production of it ; for, notwithstanding several severe illnesses and bodily infirmities, he made many long journeys in pursuit of his antiquarian and historical researches. The first edition was printed in octavo, 1 586 ; another, in 1587; and a third, in 1590. Two quarto editions were published, one in 1594, the other in 1600, and a folio edition in 1 607. It was besides reprinted in several towns on the continent. Translations into English were published by Philemon Holland and Bishop GKbson : referring to the latter is the follow- ing passage in Evelyn's Diary, Feb. 13, 1695. \" The new edition of Camden's Britannia v^as now published with greate additions : those to Surrey were mine, so that I had one presented to me.* It was also translated into Fl'ench. The first half of his Annals of Queen Elizabeth, to the year 1588, appeared in 1615, and the remainder followed in 1627. Camden's hut sickness over- took him before he had completed the Annals of James the First's reign, although he had written a skeleton history up to August 18, 1623. This work was left in MS. in the author's own hand, and, upon Bishop Hacket's death, was deposited in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. He died atChiselhurst, Kent, where he had lived during the latter years of his life, November 9, 1628. His remains were, however, brought to West- minster, where they were laid in state for some days, and interred in the Abbey on the 19th, His monument is in the south transept. The University of Oxford, to mark their sense of his munificent liberality tovrards their Society, caused an oration to be delivered in his honour, which was made by Z. Townley. (See Election, 1615.) This oration was published, with the addi- tion of numerous poems in celebration of Cam- den's memory, under the title of \"Camdeni InaigniA,\" 1624. Anthony a Wood has thia 13 DeuM of WeitmiiMter.

He was an exact critic and phi- lologist^ an excellent Grecian, Latinist, and his- torian, and, aboTe all, a profound antiquary, as liis elaborate works do testify. All which accom- plishments being compacted in a little body, made him not only admired at home by the chiefest of the nobility, and the most learned of the nation, bdt alio beyond the seas,\" &c. He corresponded with the most learned men of his time abroad. In a letter to Archbishop Usher he himself gives a beautifully simple account of his manner of life almost from his youth mp. In the concluding paragraph is the fallowing high-minded passage : — ''I know not who may justly say I was am- hitious> who contented myself in Westminster School when I writ my Britannia, and eleven yean afterward, who refused a mastership of requests offered, and then had the place of a king- at-arms, without any suit, cast upon me.

[Of Herefordshire extnKtion, but bom in Bristol, and sent to Wells for the rudiments of his education; entered the University of Oxford in 1559, at the early age of 13. Strype informs us that he was bred at St John's College, but, being made a student of Christ Church, he took the degree of M.A. at that col- lage, 1566, about which time he was ordained bv Buhap Jewell ; and Wood says that he was \" mudi respected for his great leaning, eloquence, sweet eonveraation, friendly disposition, and sharpness of his wit\" It is related of him that, when Queen Elizabeth was at Oxibrd, in 1566, he so pleased her by the oration he delivered after her dinner at Clnist ^uch, thatahe nominated him her schohtf, and afterwards, on acoount of his admintble manner of preachinff, that princess constituted him her chaplain. He became a prebendary of Wells, and accumulated the degrees in Divinity, 1574 ; re- signed the chauntership of Sarum in February, 1584; was rector of Bishop's Wearmouth, Durham, from May 28, 1590, until he became Bishop of Durham. He was a learned man, and had a great repu- tation for schohurship, and his nomination to a bishopric is said to have given general satia&ction, especially to the clergy. Strype calls him ^* a great light of the Church of Enghind, a great preacher, and a pious and holy man.'- Tet Queen Eliza- beth \" stuck a good while ** in confirming Cecil's designation of him to the deanery of Durham, \" because of his youth and marriage.\" He once, too, refused the bishopric of that see, when he found Sir Walter Raleigh bent upon obtaining a portion of its lands. Fuller describes him as a man of wit, and yet of gravity, and as possessing a handsome person. « He defended the rights of his see against the encroachments of the crown with great firmness, and was successful in several lawsuits against the queen, though he seems to have been more com- pliant towards her successor. In 1603, he met king James, on his way to England, at Berwick, preached to him in that town, and escorted him to Durham, where he slept Bishop Mathew was also present at the Hampton Court Conference in that year. He was interred in York Cbthedial, and a con- spicuous memorial erected aver his tomb. He published a Latin sermon against Campiait, the Jesuit, and a letter to James I. He left other woiks ready for the press, but they do not appear to have been ever published. A record of the sermons which he preached shows that he preached 721 as Dean of Durham; as Bishop, 550^; as Archbishop, 721.— Ath.

Alabaster, of Hadley in Suflfblk, whose grandson we shall notice under Election 1583.

He served the office of vice^hancellor in 1581 and in 1590 ; and was ** very strict in his office, endeavouring, not only to break tiie ill course of preaching taken up through a Ute custom by the Divines of the University,\" but also trying to suppress the clamorous proceedings of the regents on the granting of degrees; he succeeded Dr. Tobie Mathew in the deaneries of Christ Church and Durham, and in the bishopric of the latter diocese, and, dying on the 12th of May, 1617, was buried in the choir of that cathedral He was c))ap1ain to Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and his confessor at his death. Two single sermons of his were printed, one preached before the queen, at Hampton Court, 1578 ; the other preached at Paul's Cross, 1589. Dr. Bliss quotes a curious letter, dated 1578, to Lord Burleigh, bom the chaplains and feUows of the Savoy, in which, after commending James's \" living, learning, and seal in religion, and more particularly his wisdom and policy in restoring and bringing to happy quiet- ness, the late wasted, spoiled, and indebted Uni- versity College in Ozon, whereof he is now mas- ter,\" they pray that the queen may be moved to appoint him master of the Savoy. Bishop James was the son of John James, of Li(- tieton, in Stafibrdsbire, but he was a native of Sandbach, in Cheshire, whence his mother came. His hospitality during his younger days was notorious ; he spent a great deal in the repair of the chapel of Durham House in the Strand, and bequeathed legacies to the poor at Kingham and Bishop's Auckland. He contributed liberally to the re;establishment of the library at Christ Church, and to the formation of the Bodleian Library. His picture hangs in the hall at Christ Church, and in the Bodleian.

A. of Cambridge; mcor- porated in that degree at Oxford, 1581, and elected one of the first scholars of Jesus College in the last- named university; B.D.; vicar of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, which living he gave up in 1604 ; and of Cheam, Surrey, 1609 ; but he resigned the latter vicarage in the same year. He was also a privy-councillor. He died September 26, at Winchester House, South wark, and lay there till November 11, when his body was removed to St Saviour's Church, and there interred. Bishop Andrewes was never married/ and left the greatest part of his estate to charitable uses; indeed it has been said of him that every benefice he had was the better for his tenancy of it. As dean of Westminster he was present at, and took part in, the Conferences of Divines at Hampton Court, before King James, 1604 ; and presided over the ten translators of the Bible, who met at Westminster, and to whom were assigned the earlier books of the Old Testament to the end of the first book of Chnmides. Fuller thas quaintiy records his learning and virtues : — \" The world wanted learning to know how learned this man was, so skilled in all (especially oriental) languages, that some conceive he might, if then living, almost have served as interpreter-general at the confusion of tongues. Nor are the Fathers more faithfully dt^ in his books than lively copied out in hu countenance and carriage, his gravity in a manner awing King James, who refrained from that mirth and liberty in the presence of this prelate, which otherwise he assumed to himself.\" And Bishop Hacket tells us that he looked much after the improvement of the Westminster Scholars, often eyen supplying for a week together the place of the masters ; tnat he revised iheir exercises, was alvrays accompanied by two of them when be went to Chiswick, that he frequently sent for those in the upper forms, and devoted whole evenings to their instruction, and that this was done in a very strict and exact, though in a mild and tender manner. Bishops Duppa, and Hacket himself, who were instructed in Hebrew by this pious dean, are instances of this attention to the interests of the King's Scholars.
