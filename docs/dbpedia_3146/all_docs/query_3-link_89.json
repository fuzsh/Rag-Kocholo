        "text": "The 2023 Rhode Island Early Learning and Development Standards (RIELDS) articulate shared expectations for what young children should know and be able to do from birth to five years of age. The RIELDS serve several purposes - they guide early care and education practices, such as curriculum and assessment choices, to ensure children receive every opportunity to make progress in the designated learning domains. The RIELDS also support understanding among caregivers and family members of key early learning milestones. The standards inform primary grade teachers of the educational trajectory of the state's youngest learners so that teachers are even better prepared to serve all children.\n\nThe Rhode Island Board of Education adopted the RIELDS on May 23, 2013. Throughout 2022, the RIELDS were opened for public comment and revision. On January 24th, 2023, the 2023 RIELDS were endorsed by the Council on Elementary and Secondary Education.\n\nThey are intended to be appropriate for all children, including children who are multilingual learners, children with disabilities, and children who are typically developing - recognizing that all children may meet the RIELDS in their own way and at their own pace.\n\nResources for Educators\n\nThe Standards represent expectations for young childrenâ€™s learning and continual growth in all areas: intellectual, physical, and emotional. Research confirms that successful approaches to supporting early learning are based on knowledge of the whole child. As a result, the revised early learning and development standards feature one notable change from the 2003 standards: play is embedded throughout the learning document rather than being treated as a specific standard.\n\nStandards\n\n2013 Rhode Island Early Learning and Development Standards (English)\n\n2013 Rhode Island Early Learning and Development Standards (Spanish)\n\nRIELDS Poster (English)\n\nRIELDS Poster (Spanish)\n\nInstructional Resources\n\nFun Familiy Activities Toolkit (English)\n\nFun Family Activities Toolkit (Spanish)\n\nFun Family Activity Cards (English)\n\nFun Family Activity Cards (Spanish)\n\nFun Family Activities Poster (English)\n\nFun Family Activities Poster (Spanish)\n\nThe RI Early Learning and Development Standards should be used to:\n\nUnderstand the integrated nature of early childhood development\n\nGuide early educators in the development of curriculum\n\nInform families about learning milestones\n\nProvide a framework for implementing high-quality early childhood programs\n\nSupport children's smooth and coordinated transition to Kindergarten\n\nThe RI Early Learning and Development Standards are not intended to be used as:\n\nAspecific teaching practice or materials\n\nA finite checklist of competencies\n\nA stand-alone curriculum or program\n\nA stand-alone assessment tool\n\nThe Rhode Island Early Learning and Development Standards are organized into domains, components, learning goals and indicators. The nine domains are as follows:\n\nPhysical Health and Motor Development\n\nSocial and Emotional Development\n\nLanguage Development\n\nLiteracy\n\nCognitive Development\n\nMathematics\n\nScience\n\nSocial Studies\n\nCreative Arts\n\nComponents are specific areas within a domain. For example, the domain of physical health and motor development is divided into three components: health and safety practices, gross motor development, and fine motor development.\n\nLearning Goals state the general competencies, behaviors, knowledge and skills that children develop in increasing degrees with increasing sophistication as they grow. For example, the gross motor development component includes two learning goals:\n\na) Children develop large muscle control, strength, and coordination\n\nb) Children develop traveling skills\n\nIndicators establish the specific developmental benchmark for the competencies, behaviors, knowledge and skills that most children possess or exhibit at a particular age. Seen altogether, the indicators depict the progression of development over time.\n\nThe RIELDS outline a birth-to-60 month continuum, with six developmental benchmarks:\n\n0-9 months\n\n9-18 months\n\n18-24 months\n\n24-36 months\n\n36-48 months\n\n48-60 months\n\nThe Rhode Island Early Learning and Development Standards (RIELDS) provide early childhood professionals with a common understanding of what children should know and be able to do as they exit preschool programs and enter kindergarten.\n\nThe RIELDS project supports administrators and classroom professionals to implement curriculum, instruction, child assessment, and family engagement systems aligned with the RIELDS. These courses are aligned with the state's quality rating continuum, including child care licensing regulations and BrightStars. RIDE has developed a menu of eight (8) professional development offerings for teacher assistants, family child care providers, lead teachers, education coordinators, administrators, early intervention practitioners, and special educators:\n\nCourse Name Intended Audience Modality Offered The Guiding Principles\n\nAdministrators,\n\nEducation Coordinators\n\nTeachers\n\nTeacher Assistants\n\nVirtual / Live;\n\nVirtual / Asynchronous (self-paced modules)\n\nIn Person\n\nThe 9-Domains\n\nAdministrators,\n\nEducation Coordinators\n\nTeachers\n\nTeacher Assistants\n\nVirtual / Live;\n\nVirtual / Asynchronous (self-paced modules)\n\nIn Person\n\nThe Instructional Cycle (Infant/Toddler; Preschool)\n\nEducation Coordinators\n\nTeachers\n\nHybrid Curriculum and Planning (Infant/Toddler; Preschool)\n\nEducation Coordinators\n\nTeachers\n\nIn-Person Implementing a Standards-Based Program for Education Coordinators Education Coordinators Hybrid Implementing a Standards-Based Program for Administrators Administrators In-Person\n\nThe RIELDS PD schedule is organized into 4 quarters: Fall (September - November), Winter (December - February), Spring (March - May), and Summer (June - August) with offerings available throughout the year.\n\nResources for Families\n\nIn 2004, parents, early childhood educators, and local experts worked with RIDE to develop the Fun Family Activities for Preschoolers, which encompassed Fun Family Activity Cards for Preschoolers, and later in 2004, a parent training series. Then, in 2013, with the release of new state Standards, called the Early Learning and Development Standards, the cards and trainings were updated to now include activities for children ages birth to 60 months.\n\nFun Family Activity Cards\n\nFun Family Activity Cards give parents information and enjoyable ways to support the development and learning of young children at home. The activities are meant to help your child develop skills that are important for future learning and will further support a Standards-based education children may receive in early care and education settings.\n\nRIELDS Fun Family Activity Cards [PDF, 5.4MB]\n\nRIELDS Fun Family Activity Cards (Spanish) [PDF, 5.5MB]\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nRIDE has also developed a Parent Guide which includes information for families and caregivers on how they can use the Standards with their child, why Standards for children are important, what families should know about selecting a Standards-based early care and education program as well as resources for additional information. The Parent Guide is meant to serve as a brief guide which provides families the key information they should know about the Standards.\n\nRI Early Learning and Development Standards Parent Guide\n\nRI Early Learning and Development Standards Parent Guide - Spanish\n\nFun Familiy Activities Toolkit English\n\nFun Family Activities Toolkit Spanish\n\nFFA Families Poster English\n\nFFA Families Poster Spanish"
