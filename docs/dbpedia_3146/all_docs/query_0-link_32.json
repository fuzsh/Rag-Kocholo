It examines its relationship with every English king from Edward III to Edward VI, how it defined itself as the ‘king’s chief chapel’ through turbulent dynastic politics, and its contributions to the early years of the English Reformation. It offers a new perspective on the workings of political, administrative and court life in medieval and early modern Westminster.\n\nSt St e p h e n ’ s C o l l e g e , W e st m i n st e r\n\nn St Stephen’s College, the royally-favoured religious institution at the heart of the busy administrative world of the Palace of Westminster, church and state met and collaborated for two centuries, from its foundation to pray for the royal dead by Edward III in 1348, until it was swept away by the second wave of the Reformation in 1548. Monarchs and visitors worshipped in the distinctive chapel on the Thames riverfront. Even when the king and his household were absent, the college’s architecture, liturgy and musical strength proclaimed royal piety and royal support for the Church to all who passed by.\n\nA Royal Chapel and English Kingship, 1348-1548\n\nI\n\nAR\n\nLIZABETH BIGGS started work on St Stephen’s College as part of the large research project ‘St Stephen’s Chapel: Visual and Political Culture, 1292-1941’ at the University of York.

I began work on St Stephen’s College as part of the Arts and Humanities Research Council project, St Stephen’s Chapel, Westminster: Visual and Political Culture 1292-1941, at the University of York and owe a great deal to the work and friendship of the other researchers working on or affiliated with that project, particularly Tim Ayers, John Cooper, Elizabeth Hallam Smith, James Hillson, Maureen Jurkowski, Simon Neal and Mark Ormrod. At Westminster, Mark Collins generously offered access to the remaining medieval physical fabric and his deep knowledge of the palace. The Arts and Humanities Research Council additionally gave me four months of research time at the Huntington Library, while the Leverhulme Trust funded further work on St Stephen’s Cloisters in 2018 as part of Elizabeth Hallam Smith’s Emeritus Fellowship. I am deeply grateful to the libraries and archives I have consulted for allowing me access to their holdings, particularly to The National Archives in London, St George’s College Archives in Windsor Castle, and to Tony Trowles, Matthew Payne and Christine Reynolds at Westminster Abbey. James Hillson and Adam Watrobski have very kindly allowed me to use their photographs of the surviving sixteenth-century cloister. Erika Graham-Goering read Chapter Two at a crucial moment and provided reassurance and clarity. My parents and sister have been enormously supportive and asked all the right questions when I tested ideas on them over the years. All mistakes, omissions and errors remain my own.

The chapel offered a vantage point to observe displays of kingly legitimation, collaborations between the kings of England and the Church, and the audiences who thronged to Westminster to seek access to governance. Its liturgy and music reflected royal piety and commemoration of the royal dead. Each chapter here deals with St Stephen’s from a slightly different perspective as the college and the expectations of kingship changed over two centuries. It first examines the religious and political contexts in which the college was founded and in which it had to establish its rights, until a final settlement with Westminster Abbey was reached in 1394. From 1377, Richard II adapted his grandfather’s foundation as his own as he sought to remake the palace in his own image. During the dynastically troubled fifteenth century, the dean and canons of St Stephen’s used its importance to the kings of England to maintain and develop its position as the ‘king’s chief chapel’. The increasing presence of the populace as an audience to events at Westminster shaped the college’s development and buildings after 1471 before, finally, the Reformation both revitalised and then destroyed it. The empty chapel then became the first permanent home of the House of Commons. This book examines St Stephen’s College as a key institution within the most important English palace: its buildings, its personnel and its relationships with every king between 1348 and 1548.\n\nBiggs, Elizabeth.

These men, who belonged to the royal college of St Stephen the Protomartyr, knew their role was to pray daily for the royal family, the dead who had asked to be commemorated in the chapel, and for the kingdom of England as a whole. Their prayers were expressed through the daily round of liturgy and music enjoined upon them by their own regulations, the statutes, which modified the common liturgical practice of the southern English Church, known as the Sarum Use.1 Their roles had been set by the college’s founder, the English king Edward III, when in a letter patent dated 6 August 1348 he had commanded the foundation of the college ‘to the honour of God, St Stephen the Protomartyr, and the Virgin Mary’.2 On the same day he founded St George’s, Windsor, the home of the Order of the Garter.3 With modifications and a considerable increase in the numbers of people prayed for, the basic pattern set in 1348 was still true at Easter 1548, when another Edward, Edward VI, dissolved all remaining institutions that had as their primary purpose to pray for the dead in Purgatory, including St Stephen’s.4 St George’s was exempted from that act. The twenty-six priests at both colleges were divided into two groups. The dean and the twelve canons were appointed by the king, and so were drawn from the world of royal service, where they also worked in the king’s administration or his household and were in consequence rewarded with ecclesiastical positions at institutions with no parochial responsibilities. Their presence was expected at the main mass of the day and when otherwise required, but much of their time could be devoted to the work of administration and government in the Palace of Westminster, and they might have many other additional ecclesiastical posts. The thirteen priests who served as vicars, by contrast, were chosen by the dean and canons, and were expected to be continually present at all the services The single clause of the statutes that survives is copied in WAM 18431.

A late medieval college in England could be many things, as recent essay collections covering an enormous variety of topics have shown.7 At its core, a college was a group of priests, with perhaps support from vicars, choristers and lay servants, who were gathered together into a community with a legal identity. These institutions were headed by men called variously deans, masters or wardens, and the individual priests were canons who held prebends or stalls. Colleges were founded as permanent institutions, where each post would continue to exist after any individual had left, and which would have an income drawn from land that would sustain it independently for the rest of its existence, which was thought to be in perpetuity. The college’s purpose was usually to serve a particular church or chapel and to add to the quality of prayers being offered within England as well as to pray for the founders’ souls after their deaths in order to aid them in moving from Purgatory into Heaven. In addition to their church or chapel, colleges usually had some form of housing and communal space, such as the medieval closes that survive at many cathedrals. Unlike monastic communities, the priests at colleges were not bound to a rule and were free to leave the institution if they chose. Colleges ranged from very small institutions of three or four priests through to the large secular cathedrals such as Salisbury or Lincoln, which could have upwards of fifty prebends and as many vicars, as well as a large support staff.8 Colleges were often founded with particular charitable purposes, including to run and support almshouses or hospitals, or, in the most famous surviving examples, to provide education, such as at the university colleges in Oxford and Cambridge and schools such as Winchester College and Eton College.

While there were already many surviving small early medieval colleges, St Stephen’s was in the first wave of a new interest in colleges as a form of religious expression for founders in the fourteenth century, as commemoration of the dead took on increasing importance. In addition, founders increasingly saw colleges as a more attractive form of religious patronage than monasteries for their flexibility and the way they could be scaled in size to match the resources available. Despite its importance to the kings of England over two centuries, St Stephen’s exists on the edges of modern scholarship. It has functioned as a useful exemplar, but has neither been studied in its own right nor as a complete institution. The one existing summary of its history appeared in 1909 as part of the Victoria County History of Middlesex, which was then revised in 2009.9 Art historians such as Maurice Hastings and James Hillson, among others, have examined the chapel as an example of influential ecclesiastical architecture, while historians interested in the late medieval Church tend to mention it in passing, or use an aspect of its existence as an example of larger phenomena.10 Chris Given-Wilson and Ralf Lützelschwab have examined two episodes in the early life of the college: the dispute over Edward III’s will, and the long-running litigation over rights and revenues claimed by both the college and Westminster Abbey.11 Biographies of those who worked at the college treat it as one of many preferments held, rather than as the working base of their lives in royal or ecclesiastical administration at Westminster.12 Some of the music definitely or probably written for the college The Victoria County History of the Counties of England: London I, ed.

This historical ambivalence is largely because of the problems of categorising the college across academic disciplines, and the lack of internal sources about the operation of the college, which does not make it amenable to how historians have conventionally approached the institutions of the Church, whether monastic or secular. This book is shaped by the surviving sources and their uneven distribution across the two centuries of the college’s existence and uses the surviving sources to examine the place that St Stephen’s occupied within the Palace of Westminster and within English kingship in the later Middle Ages. The site that St Stephen’s College occupied in Westminster has largely disappeared under the modern Houses of Parliament and the wider parliamentary estate, where the names of some buildings and streets recall the former occupants of the Thames riverfront. The precinct of St Stephen’s was built up in stages and redeveloped over the centuries. However, it roughly fell into two parts, based around Edward III’s grants in 1348 and 1356, which are discussed further in Chapter One.14 The core precinct comprised the river frontage of the palace from the Painted Chamber north to New Palace Yard, which contained the chapel and the communal areas, as well as houses and gardens. The second area was north of New Palace Yard, a site that in the thirteenth century had been the separate house of Edward I’s younger brother, the earl of Kent.15 Both these sites have been sigteenth century, John Gunthorpe has received some attention, most notably in A.C.

Antiquarians and artists documented St Stephen’s after a fire in 1834 destroyed the medieval Palace of Westminster, hidden behind later facades and alterations that were stripped away by fire.16 On the northern site, the modern road Canon Row, which runs northward from Bridge Street behind Portcullis House, was the site of the deans’ and canons’ lodgings from the late fourteenth century onwards, and the modern street name is that in use by the sixteenth century although it has been truncated at what is today Derby Gate. At the corner of Bridge Street and Canon Row to the south, the name of St Stephen’s Tavern remembers not the college, but the chapel’s use by the House of Commons as their meeting place from c.1550 to 1834. Within the modern Houses of Parliament, St Stephen’s Court and Cloister Court again serve as nominal markers of the site once occupied by St Stephen’s College, while St Stephen’s Hall, and the chapel of St Mary Undercroft beneath, occupy the site and the rough dimensions of the chapels that the college’s personnel knew so well. Tucked between St Stephen’s Hall and Westminster Hall, the college’s cloister is one of the few surviving fragments of the medieval palace to have been preserved within the nineteenth-century building, albeit with centuries of repairs and then heavy restoration work after a bomb fell on the south-east corner in 1941.17 The Palace of Westminster lurks in the background of medieval political and administrative history because it was destroyed by fire in 1834 and the archaeology is sparse. It is hard to envisage what it was like to be present in the palace beyond the surviving Great Hall. The medieval palace, where St Stephen’s Chapel dominated the skyline, had grown up over centuries of building and rebuilding, clustered around Westminster Hall, built by William Rufus and reroofed and decorated by Richard II. As can be seen in Wyngaerde’s panorama from c.1544, the palace stretched out along the river front and can be divided into two distinct areas. To the north around Westminster Hall was the public palace, the rooms and subdivided areas used by the various administrative offices issuing documentation and managing royal finances that had developed by the fourteenth century, For example, Robert William Billings, ‘St. Stephen’s Chapel: View from Speaker’s Gallery after the Fire 1834’, Parliamentary Art Collection, WOA 1665; alteration works in the early nineteenth century had produced antiquarian work, including J.T. Smith, Antiquities of Westminster; the Old Palace; St. Stephen’s Chapel (Now the House of Commons), Etc (London: J.T. Smith, 1807); but it was the fire of 1834 that spurred the two extensive treatments of the chapel, first E. Brayley and J. Britton, The History of the Ancient Palace and Late Houses of Parliament at Westminster (London: John Weale, 1835); and then F. Mackenzie, The Architectural Antiquities of St Stephen’s Chapel, late the House of Commons (London: John Weale, 1844); for the fire, C. Shenton, The Day Parliament Burned Down (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012). 17 There is extensive documentation of the cloisters’ restoration in the 1950s by Giles Gilbert Scott in WORK 14/3127. 16\n\nBiggs, Elizabeth.

These areas were in use predictably and frequently in this period. When the courts were in session during the law terms, this end of the palace would be bustling with people coming and going. When the courts fell silent out of term, the palace was quieter, but still not deserted. To the south of St Stephen’s lay the personal quarters of the king and his family, known as the privy palace.19 This area was much more restricted in terms of access, although it was not fully private, as Parliament used the Painted Chamber as well as the Queen’s Chamber.20 Still, for petitioners and others who came to Westminster to seek justice or documentation, St Stephen’s Chapel was probably as far into the privy palace as they were likely to go. For example, the Londoners in 1357 were able to access Westminster Hall, but were not then able to cross the courtyard joining the Lesser Hall, Westminster Hall and St Stephen’s Chapel without challenge.21 The combination of the consistent presence in term time of the courts and the king’s administration with the inconsistent royal presence and the potential presence of Parliament made Westminster and St Stephen’s extremely visible to a wide range of the political community. St Stephen’s College stood balanced between the two most important institutions in medieval Westminster: the king’s palace and the abbey of St Peter, the coronation church since William I in 1067. The palace drew visitors to the town, separated from the City of London by open fields, to access the king’s financial offices and the law courts, which had firmly settled in Westminster by the start of the fourteenth century and, when it was in session, most of the meetings of Parliament. Westminster Abbey was equally important within the town, in part as the shrine of Edward the Confessor, but also because it was the dominant landowner, held the lordship of the manor, and held the ecclesiastical role of archdeacon of Westminster.22 The parish in which the palace lay was St Margaret’s, whose rector was the abbey. St Stephen’s College was probably intended to have an ecclesiastical liberty of its own and to act as the parish church for the palace. For the summary of the palace’s built evolution, the best source remains the summaries by Colvin in HKW, i, pp. 491–549. 19 Ibid., pp. 534–7. 20 J.

While the liberty was never created, St Stephen’s was one of the palace chapels for the most important of the king’s palaces, the administrative centre of the kingdom, as well as the residence in which the king usually spent the most time. The college co-operated, co-existed, and quarrelled with Westminster Abbey over its jurisdiction and rights within the palace, while also offering an alternative pilgrimage venue to the abbey shrine of St Edward the Confessor in the cult image, ‘imagia’, of the Virgin Mary in the small chapel of St Mary le Pew attached to the south side of St Stephen’s Chapel.23 The college built up and developed its secular rights within the area; by the sixteenth century it was the second-largest landowner in Westminster after the abbey itself.24 The canons took part in the world of administration based in the palace even as the nature and rhetoric of administration changed. Westminster’s role in governance and the urban world can be seen in the frequent use of canons as receivers of petitions or clerks of Parliament in parliaments held in the vicinity of the palace. Economically and spatially, as well as musically, St Stephen’s looked to the urban world and the world of governance that surrounded them as well as to the king’s household and his court. St Stephen’s College is alone among the late medieval colleges founded by or inherited by the kings of England because it received sustained attention in a way that no other college did. It is the consistent presence at St Stephen’s of royal support long after its foundation that distinguishes it from other royally founded colleges, and makes it comparable to the Sainte Chapelle in Paris, where the founder was both king and saint.25 Every king from Edward III to Henry VIII was commemorated by a yearly anniversary service, apart from Richard III and Edward V, both of whom were unable to make provisions to add themselves to the college’s remembrances. Royal support to the college seems in part to have been the result of sustained proximity, and to the college’s role in visualising and carrying out kingship and governance.

It provides an opportunity to examine royal piety comparatively across ten English kings in two centuries and thus to begin to tease out the ways in which different kings responded differently to the apparatus of sacral monarchy available to them and expected of them in a single space.26 Monarchy was performed at St Stephen’s, where a small crowd in the nave could just barely see the king seated in relation to the murals staking out Edward III’s personal sense of a relationship with the saints, and still more could see him enter or leave the chapel on feast days in procession as an embodiment of quasi-sacral power.27 Even when the ruling king was absent, in the liturgy of St Stephen’s he was present in the daily round of prayer and in the music sung in the chapel.28 Every visitor, from Froissart to the sixteenth-century knights who heard mass in the chapel while at Westminster for law cases, would have been aware of the royal splendour and patronage shown in the heraldic decoration, the richness of the liturgical furnishings and the lavishness of the services.29 The college was an expression of royal dynastic piety, and one that kings were careful to make their own, as well as to respond to the works of their predecessors. In addition, the canons of St Stephen’s working within the king’s government, in Chancery, the Exchequer and in the royal household, were part of the delegated royal government that carried out the king’s will. As the men appointed to canonries were consistently usually associated with royal service, despite the increase in laymen in royal government, the personnel at St Stephen’s combined both the religious and practical sides of medieval kingship.30 There are few comparative studies of English royal piety in the later Middle Ages on the ways in which Richard II constructed saintliness for Edward II: Chris Given-Wilson, ‘Richard II, Edward II and the Lancastrian Inheritance’, EHR 109 (1994): 553–71; on the three Edwards’s use of religion to project images of piety: W.M.

The expectations and norms of kingship have been hard to tease out in individual studies of particular kings because they were contingent and dependent on the personal will of the individual who happened to be king at any given moment, as well as on the expectations of the aristocracy and the commons, and external events such as unrest, warfare and famines. By looking at St Stephen’s Chapel and College, which by necessity had a working relationship with each of the English kings from 1348 to 1548, it is possible to see the ways in which the monarch was constrained by the expectations of a particularly public palace, and the standards of display expected, while also assessing the space they had in which to introduce their own personal desires and innovations to the workings of governance in their name. St Stephen’s was more than just a place of royal piety because it was also the home of many of those who worked in the offices of governance. While the concept of the court as a place of political action has been contested for the fifteenth century and its importance has been questioned, all power came from the king in person and physical access to the king conditioned access to power. St Stephen’s allows us to examine both the king’s household and his administration, which are often treated separately for the later Middle Ages, because the canons of St Stephen’s worked in both, and might move between the two elements of delegated royal authority, and access to the king. Routine government was delegated to greater or lesser extent to those officials and justices who carried out the established procedures of each of the courts and the offices that had developed over the course of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. At Westminster the widest possible range of individuals could, in theory, have some access to the king, whether in person from a distance or through his government, because all subjects had to have access to the law courts and to the offices of government around them, clustered around Westminster Hall. At Westminster, then, personal and corporate kingship could and did interact.\n\nin Later Medieval England: Essays Dedicated to the Memory of A. R. Myers, ed. C.H.

Royal administration, in which most canons worked during their time at the college, was dependent on powers delegated from the king to those who worked in the administrative and financial offices based at Westminster or who travelled with the king’s person. The king was central to the late medieval English political system, and all else depended on his willingness to participate in the systems of governance that had been developed to administer his financial, legal and military interests throughout England and, during times of war, overseas.31 This corporate kingship, the ways in which the king’s personal decisions and those of administrators and other influential figures acting in his name are often indistinguishable, resulted from the ways in which the delegation of power went alongside a fiction that the king ruled by himself with the advice of others, rather than other individuals receiving delegated authority. Political life as expressed through a variety of means, from popular protest through to the pressure of the great magnates, focused on ensuring that the king acted correctly and that his governance was perceived as fair and just. When there were disputes between the king and his subjects, opposition to the king was often couched in terms of opposition to those who were counselling him rather than to the king himself, as by changing his councillors he could be brought back into harmony with the wishes of the whole kingdom and the common good.32 Counsel was the mechanism by which the king could be influenced, but the work of government was in theory directed by the king’s own wishes, even as in practice it was far too wide-ranging and specialised in its routine operation for full royal oversight. The work the canons did in royal administration ranged from taking part in the king’s councils, working in the writing offices of Chancery and the Privy Seal Office, to the financial management carried out by the Exchequer. All of these offices were part of the corporate kingship that was based at Westminster and which was the side of kingship that most late medieval and early modern individuals would have come into contact with, when they paid their taxes, took part in legal disputes or sought documentation or grants from Chancery.33 In addition to routine government and this idea of corporate kingship, which G.L.

Much of the work done on expectations of kingship as a concept has focused on the didactic texts known as mirrors for princes, because they offer a clear set of discussions about how kings and other lords should behave, even as they raise questions about how far they influenced individuals’ practices.34 They also responded to changing circumstances, and so can be used to show attitudes in flux and responding to political changes and challenges. The mirrors represented the best of political theory in England during this period. Thus, they provide a means of looking at what John Watts called the ‘structures of authority’ rather than the choices of individual kings and particular political circumstances.35 As Watts has argued from the mirrors of monarchy and the reign of Henry VI, these frameworks of kingship constrained and shaped the possibilities open to individual monarchs while also being highly vulnerable to their failings. There are three elements in which St Stephen’s allows us to examine both kingship and the choices of individual kings over the two centuries in which the college was active in new ways. First, it allows us to compare the working of patronage and how that shifted over time, particularly patronage to those who served the king, whether clerical or lay. The successful balancing of patronage and loyalties by the king were acknowledged by the mirrors of princes as key to maintaining a successful reign. St Stephen’s was consistently a recipient of royal patronage, both to the canons as individuals and to the institution as a whole. Second, it allows us to look at how kings constructed themselves in relation to their predecessors and to their own sense of dynasty and legitimation through how they presented themselves in relation to the institution of St Stephen’s College. Third, the college was inherently public-facing and so allows for a discussion of how kingship was constructed for those watching the piety of the king or his proxies within the Palace of Westminster. Whether the king’s relationship with his administration was necessary for understanding the political life of England and Wales has been contested. An older view of kingship saw the king’s person as secondary to the central work done by the bureaucrats who issued documentation in his name. T.F. Tout in his magisterial Chapters in the Administrative History of Medieval England, published in the 1920s, argued that government was the work of career bureaucrats, possibly directed by those officers at the head of their departments, who K.

Tout’s work on the administrators of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries opened up the records of the financial and legal offices that developed into the system of offices based at Westminster. The importance of his knowledge of the records has lasted beyond the influence of his own views on the importance of government. In the mid-twentieth century, K.B. McFarlane’s influential work on the relationship between the king and the great magnates turned historians’ attention to the networks of personal relationships and affinities, which McFarlane saw as key to understanding the political history of particularly the turbulent and uncertain fifteenth century.37 The bureaucrats became an irrelevance, perhaps of interest for their literary and religious interests, but not particularly useful for understanding the political culture that directed their work. More recently, structural factors have returned to the historiography with the work of Simon Walker and John Watts, among others. Walker examined the interplay between individuals and political ideas, particularly in his study of Richard Andrew, secretary to Henry VI.38 Watts has suggested that the mirrors of monarchy treatises of the fifteenth century give an insight into the expectations of the political community – as widely defined – of their king, which then structured the possibilities of political action.39 Yet this structural approach does not fully bring the personnel and expectations of government back into the picture – in part because, as Ralph Griffiths has commented, the prosopographical understanding of the entirety of fifteenth-century government has not been attempted.40 This book is not that study, but it does use the canons of St Stephen’s, because they were part of the wider world of both government and the king’s household, to examine the spatial and personal relationships that were possible between royal administration and the household when they were all at Westminster.

Historians have noted that commentators, particularly chroniclers, commented on whether or not the king appeared to be royal, such as the failure of the procession in 1471, which attempted to situate Henry VI as king in opposition to the returning Edward IV.41 David Starkey opened up the question of the court’s role in political life, which has enthusiastically been taken up and developed further.42 John Watts has argued against seeing the court as always a political centre, noting that it was kings who failed to be seen as successful by military means and who most turned to lavish self-presentation as royal through their households.43 Richard II’s relationship with magnificence has been well commented on, and the ways in which he related himself to the saints.44 Even more conventionally successful kings such as Henry V or Edward IV were conscious of the importance of appearance, of living up to expectations and taking part in the round of ceremonial that Fiona Kisby has identified as structuring the life of the royal household and, by extension, displaying the king to his subjects at particularly significant points in the liturgical year.45 The coronation ceremony might be the moment when an individual became sacralised as king, but he was continually reinforcing that moment through his self-presentation and successes, as well as by his continuing relationship with the Church. That Edward III was both militarily and dynastically successful meant that by the fifteenth century he had become, as D.A.L. Morgan has shown, the model that later kings, mired in dynastic uncertainty and with their legitimacy questioned, attempted to emulate.46 St Stephen’s, with its strong connections to Edward III, was thus ideally placed to display royal magnificent support to the Church, a sense of royal dynastic awareness and public\n\nHistorie of the Arrivall of Edward IV in England, ed.

It allows an examination of that public, pious presentation to audiences that can be more precisely delineated than at any other royal home. Queenship and the female experience of worship were also present in the life of St Stephen’s. This book focuses on kingship in relation to St Stephen’s College because the college was an expression of Edward III’s piety and dynastic ambitions that were then taken up and supported by almost every successive king until the sixteenth century. Male gifts of land and resources to the college, and the college’s strong relationships with the male-staffed administrative offices that surrounded it in Westminster, dominate the surviving records. This was not the whole story, however. Women were included in the college’s dynastic imagery from the beginning, through the altar wall murals showing Edward III’s female relations: his mother, wife and daughters.47 They were included in its commemoration, either through yearly memorial services or through chantries.48 The surviving records surrounding St Stephen’s also provide glimpses of its usages by women, particularly in relation to the under-recorded cult image of St Mary le Pew, which seems to have been a maternal cult and was particularly supported by the royal women. Margaret of Anjou gave a donor window to St Mary le Pew, and the household accounts of Elizabeth of York record her offerings at the shrine in connection with offerings to other Marian cult centres.49 At other times, royal women are known to have heard Mass in the chapel, including at services that might well have had deep emotional resonances, such as the coronation of Elizabeth of York, and possibly also christenings and churchings after childbirth in the palace.50 Music may have been commissioned by Elizabeth of York for the chapel’s services that reflected the female relationships between maternal saints and dynastic success.51 That records of offerings are sparse and the records of services held are almost non-existent means that the ways in which women and queens in particular were most likely to engage with the chapel and its liturgy are the least likely to be recorded.

These chapels were still unfinished in 1348, although they were nearing completion after fifty years of on-and-off building work. Only glazing and painting seem to have been left in the summer of 1348, and would be completed in 1363.53 Before 1291, when Edward I began the rebuilding of the old St Stephen’s as a new two-storey chapel on the model of the Sainte Chapelle in Paris, St Stephen’s Chapel seems to have been a single-storey chapel on the same site. Along with the chapel of St John the Evangelist, it had been used by Henry III in the thirteenth century as the main palace chapel, where the Chapel Royal carried out their round of public piety on the king’s behalf, and which had served as the public face of royal liturgy in Westminster.54 The Chapel Royal’s services were open to visitors to the king’s houses, while the king’s personal chaplains celebrated mass for him privately in his oratories. St John the Evangelist seems to have fallen out of use and possibly been torn down within thirty years of the completion of St Stephen’s, leaving St Stephen’s Chapel and its subsidiaries as the largest and most heavily used of the chapels within the palace.55 There were at least two other smaller oratories used by the royal family, St Laurence’s and the Queen’s Chapel, within the privy palace complex to the south of St Stephen’s Chapel.56 These smaller chapels were probably not big enough for the use of the Chapel Royal, and so St Stephen’s is likely to have remained the chapel used by the Chapel Royal when the king and his household were in residence at Westminster, even after the foundation of the college. Edward I’s project, as subsequently modified by successive kings and master masons, resulted in a distinctive two-storey building, with the east end directly on the river and forming an important landmark to passing traffic.

St Mary le Pew was a smaller chapel on the south side of St Stephen’s between the chapel’s two easternmost buttresses, with another small chapel sometimes used as a chapter house, whose dedication is unknown, beneath it. The relationship between St Stephen’s and the spaces and institutions that surrounded it, both the secular and the ecclesiastical, within the Palace of Westminster is central to this book. The ecclesiastical relationships between St Stephen’s and the Chapel Royal are at the heart of my arguments about the significance of the college to English kingship. The historiography of the Chapel Royal has focused on its singers and musical strengths as well as its place within the round of public ceremonial that supported the monarch’s public presentation. Fiona Kisby showed its central place in the life of the Tudor household, and its use as a tool for displaying the king’s person and his piety.57 The institutional composition of the Chapel Royal has been the subject of study, particularly in Alison McHardy’s work on the Chapel Royal of Henry V and its presence in his French campaigns.58 On the musical side, musicologists have studied the surviving music produced for the Chapel Royal and its patterns of recruitment across the Middle Ages, including recently Magnus Williamson’s work on the music preserved in the Eton Choirbook, which includes music that may have been composed for St Stephen’s.59 Relatively little attention has been paid to the spaces used by the Chapel Royal as it moved with the king around the Thames Valley. Simon Thurley has examined the changing trends of the chapels built or renovated by the Tudor monarchs, particularly at Hampton Court, but not those that those monarchs had inherited, such as St Stephen’s Chapel.60 That there are some surviving sources for the liturgy and music of St Stephen’s, and that its layout can be reconstructed reasonably straightforwardly, means that the liturgical and musical life of a royal chapel can be reconstructed and its relationship to generations of kingship assessed. St Stephen’s could be used as a presentational tool alongside the Chapel Royal; its institutional make-up went alongside that of the Chapel Royal and its music has also survived. As such, the college offers an opportunity to examine how architecture, music and institutional structures could combine to offer messages of dynastic success, legitimacy and royal magnificence to those who visited the Palace of Westminster during the later Middle Ages.

Yet St Stephen’s College exists today only in fragments of its physical fabric and stray archival survivals. When the college was dissolved during the English Reformation in 1548, the college’s archives and financial records were probably mostly discarded rather than taken into the records of the Court of Augmentations, the government department that took over the college’s landed endowment and its valuable plate, vestments and other precious objects. Some documents survived and made their way into the hands of antiquaries, and thence into the depositories of antiquarian materials in the British Museum, now the British Library, most importantly the college’s obit book.61 The obit book records the names of those individuals who asked that they be prayed for yearly on the anniversary of their deaths. In addition to the calendars of names and the financial accounting of the payments given to members of the college for attending these services, the obit book also contains indentures between the college and those who wished for obits. The college’s physical fabric was altered and adapted for other uses in the sixteenth century, although the core of the buildings remained in use until the nineteenth century, when they were pulled down in the wake of a devastating 1834 fire to make space for the new Houses of Parliament, with the sole exception of the sixteenth-century cloister. Fragments survive of the chapel’s stonework and antiquarian drawings to give an impression of the buildings’ appearances in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.62 Instead of the college’s own archives, this book uses the surviving material that can be found in other institutions’ archives and the royal records to examine the life and work of this college, through its connections to other religious houses and to the work of royal administration, but also through comparison to similar large colleges founded by the kings of England or the great magnates in the later Middle Ages. This cannot be a history of St Stephen’s College from the internal perspective of the college’s own concerns, and consequently much less emphasis is placed on the internal decision-making processes or the financial management and development of their resources than would often be possible at other religious institutions. The evidence clusters unevenly throughout the college’s existence, against a backdrop of steady presence in the royal administrative records throughout, and these patterns have shaped the arguments of this book. The vicars and singing men appear irregularly and exceptionally because they were documented only BL Cotton MS Faustina B VIII, ff. 2r–53v. See R.

In contrast, the dean and the canons were usually royal servants, and thus appear regularly in the royal documentation in relation to their working lives in ways that are suggestive for the college’s own workings and associations. Edward III’s foundation took until 1394 to be fully worked through, and so that creation process is gathered together first, as the college’s relationships with two other powerful institutions in Westminster were clarified. There is a great deal of evidence for the reign of Richard II because of a confluence of disputes involving other, better-­ documented opponents and the resumption of building works in the palace. Thus Richard’s reign receives a chapter to itself to examine how he and his administration responded to the patterns and imagery set up by his grandfather. Under the Lancastrian kings, and then the Yorkists, evidence for the college as an institution becomes sporadic, but suggestive of larger concerns around legitimacy and inheritance, which has merited a chapter on dynasty and regime change, while also considering how the college responded to the political and economic challenges of the fifteenth century. From the mid-fifteenth century until the Palace of Westminster was fully reshaped by the desires of Henry VII and his son, there is increasing evidence of which audiences were able to engage with St Stephen’s and with what might be called by the contested term of the ‘court’. This audience engagement with St Stephen’s and the royal household gives us a much better picture of who might make use of the spaces and calendar of worship set in motion in the fourteenth century, while also suggesting that the fifteenth century saw an increased concern for who was able to see the round of spectacle offered by the royal household. Finally, the Reformation marked an end to the type of piety that had animated St Stephen’s, while also reinvigorating its importance to the king and his household until at last in 1548 the college was dissolved under the Second Chantries Act of December 1547. There are three themes of the collegiate life that weave through the book and which gave meaning to St Stephen’s College for contemporaries and observers. The first was the round of worship offered in the chapels throughout the rhythms of the liturgical year. Where there is evidence for liturgical and musical practice, it has been incorporated. Music was particularly important in the college’s foundation in the mid-fourteenth century and then again in the later fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. In the sixteenth century, the music and other evidence for the liturgical goods of the college provide evidence for the college’s institutional response to the changing demands of the English Reformation. The second theme is the wider usages of the Palace of Westminster as a royal home and as the home of the king’s administration. Westminster was both the most important and the most unusual palace in England because it was more than simply one of the king’s\n\nBiggs, Elizabeth.

These usages shaped the audiences that came to visit the chapel, and its uses by the king’s household, until in the sixteenth century the palace was abandoned as a residence. St Stephen’s was a visible part of this palace world, dominating the river frontage, and it rather lost its purposes when the palace was superseded by other royal homes. Finally, the third theme is the canons’ relationships to the administrative usage of the palace, and the college’s relationships with the institutions that surrounded it within the palace and manor. Those relationships were contested and fraught in the fourteenth century, gave the college stability in the fifteenth century and continued in new forms in the sixteenth century. They could be turned to advantage by individual canons and by the college as a whole at different points, while giving the college an ongoing set of possible relationships with the kings of England. The impression of St Stephen’s close association with the king and with the apparatus of royal government is in part created by the documentation that has survived. The vast majority of the surviving documents that concern St Stephen’s College survive in the royal administrative records, created by the governmental offices of the Exchequer and Chancery. Most of this material is at the National Archives in Kew alongside the other surviving documentation of royal and governmental activity. Other repositories such as the British Library hold stray documents that were removed or copied from the royal records by antiquarians.63 These materials concern the college’s interactions with the administration that surrounded it in the palace. All the records of grants of land, revenue or rights from the king, confirmations of the college’s own actions and documents relating to the canons’ work in royal administration and the king’s household were issued by the royal secretariat in Chancery and so copies were kept among the Chancery records. Records of taxation and other financial interactions with the Crown, including the regular payments to the college out of tax revenues, were kept by the Exchequer. The financial accounts of the king’s household survive only patchily, but when they do survive they too are among the documents that have largely ended up in Kew. Accounts kept by the royal clerks of the works record the financial and organisational management that built the majority of the college’s buildings and then adapted them in the fourteenth century, as well as payments for the repair and decoration of parts of the college’s buildings for use during royal events in the sixteenth century. Individual canons’ careers can be tracked through the records of their appointments and rewards. The royal documentation shows us the many ways in which the college interacted with the Crown, Including the collection of canons’ names and other miscellaneous information that is BL Lansdowne MS 447.\n\n63\n\nBiggs, Elizabeth.

The single most crucial source for any history of St Stephen’s is the royal patent rolls maintained throughout the college’s existence by Chancery.64 Smaller amounts of similar material were issued as letters close or as charters and so appear in the calendars of those series.65 As enrolled copies of documentation issued to the dean and canons themselves, the Chancery rolls provide the basis for understanding some part of what would have been stored in the college’s own archives. The danger with seeing St Stephen’s solely in relation to the king is that such an approach over-emphasises the ongoing relationship with the Crown over other relationships that could be just as important, with the lay communities of Westminster and beyond, with the ecclesiastical hierarchy of England and Wales, and with the wider Church. Richard II could support the college in its dispute with Westminster Abbey, but he could not alter the papacy’s judgement of the case. Similarly, while the endowment of St Stephen’s was first established by Edward III, it was augmented by the devoted gifts of others over the next two centuries. Laypeople, both local to Westminster and from further afield, also attended services or left money to the college in their wills. Some of their commitment to the college can be found in royal records, but much of this material comes from archives kept by other institutions. Wills proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, as well as the local courts in Westminster and others across the country, point to lay commitment to St Stephen’s after death. The surviving parish records of St Margaret’s, Westminster that are now in the City of Westminster Archives reveal the co-operation between the parish and the college in the sixteenth century, when those records begin. The records of Westminster Abbey are crucial to understanding the dynamics within the manor of Westminster, where both royally favoured institutions held lands and claimed ecclesiastical privileges across two hundred years. The archives of St George’s College, Windsor do not often deal directly with St Stephen’s, yet still preserve evidence for co-operation between the two institutions in maintaining their obligations as well as considerable overlap in canons. Episcopal registers often contain incidental information about events at St Stephen’s, individuals connected with the college or about the college’s estate management.

This material emphasises the process of continual change and adaptation that any college faced, as well as the ability of individuals to change the web of interconnections at any particular point. The evidence for how St Stephen’s Chapel and the cloisters may have looked, and the physical contexts in which the college operated, comes from much later drawings and paintings as well as archaeological work. The antiquarians who tried to make sense of St Stephen’s College, and particularly its surviving buildings in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, had a variety of reasons and interests for their work, which was usually occasioned by alterations to the building to suit the House of Commons or the Speaker, whose house sat within the shell of the collegiate buildings around the cloisters after 1794. They were fascinated by their encounters with a lost medieval past hidden behind centuries of adaptations and wooden panelling, and wrote in often emotive terms of the building, such as when John Carter described ‘the perfect window’ in St Mary Undercroft.66 Their drawings and explanatory material record the buildings as they found them after more than two centuries of adaptations and repairs. Antiquarians removed stones from the walls, which are now in the British Museum and show part of the painted decorative scheme, and copied images from the walls, including the intriguing murals on the east wall surrounding the high altar. Other antiquarians after the 1834 fire recorded the material remains of St Stephen’s laid bare by the conflagration, particularly the surviving architecture and the evidence for how it related spatially to the now lost privy palace and spurred public interest in the wider palace ahead of its destruction to make the modern Houses of Parliament.67 In addition, archaeological works, both during the building works in the 1850s to create the current St Mary Undercroft and in the 1990s underneath the chapel’s foundations, have revealed information about the medieval chapel and its usages, upon which I have been able to draw.68 All of these survivals, drawings and finds Describing plates 2, 5 and 7, J.

An earlier generation of seventeenth-century antiquarian interest in St Stephen’s led to a miscellaneous set of survivals from the college’s own records and liturgical collections, largely in the Cotton and Harley collections within the British Library. These particular survivals and finds have shaped where I have been able to bring out the college’s own experiences and material culture, particularly in commemoration, music and liturgy. Oddly enough, these are subjects that rarely have good surviving evidence for pre-Reformation England, which survived because the college’s collections were lavish and valuable enough to become collectible and the site remained important enough for antiquarians to record. Unlike most collegiate archives surviving today, the chance survivals from the college’s own internal documents and possessions tend not to be financial or legal documents, which would have been the types of material preserved by the college for its own use, and which might have survived if the collegiate archives had been retained by the Court of Augmentations when they took possession of the former college’s landed estates. Instead, what survived from the college are unusual documents that were particularly interesting rather than routine financial information. The British Library holds the daily working registers of canons attending High Mass for six months in 1485 and a few manorial documents relating to the college’s manors in Kent, disputed in the seventeenth century.69 The obit book, created in the early fifteenth century and faithfully updated until the early sixteenth century, also made its way into antiquarian hands, and then into the Harley Collection. It contains the records of all those for whom the canons had agreed to pray in the college’s rounds of services, as well as some copies of indentures made with those commemorated, with details of burial provisions, specific service requests and a calculator for working out how much money each canon and vicar would get for their attendance at the memorial service.70 Elsewhere, Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge holds a choirbook probably compiled in the sixteenth century for St Stephen’s, and the New York Public Library has a missal possibly used in the chapel and certainly owned by the last dean, John Chambre.71 The most extended comparison in this book is with St George’s College in the Lower Ward of Windsor Castle, the sister college of St Stephen’s, of equal status in the minds of contemporaries because of their theoretically simultaneous\n\nRespectively BL Royal MS Appendix 45–8, BL Harley MS 45 A 38–49 and BL Additional MS 28530 ff. 17–21. 70 BL Cotton Faustina B VIII, f. 53r. 71 Now Cambridge, Gonville and Caius College MS 667/760; New York, New York Public Library MS MA 63. 69\n\nBiggs, Elizabeth.

St George’s was fortunate enough to be the sole chantry college to survive the Reformation and its archives remain in situ in the college, although moved from their original home in the Aerary Porch. It has been well studied as the home of the Order of the Garter as well as an important college in its own right. Recently, conference proceedings concerning St George’s in the later Middle Ages have pointed to the interdisciplinary possibilities of studying colleges.72 In addition to its parallel foundation, St George’s was consistently treated as a sister college to St Stephen’s in the royal documentation and shared personnel with St Stephen’s throughout the two centuries when both colleges were active. As such, the documentation that survives in the Windsor archives gives a good indication of what would have been kept at St Stephen’s, particularly since both had statutes written by William Edington, bishop of Winchester, who would have mandated similar practices at both institutions. Interestingly, however, the perception of the two colleges as twin did not result in equal treatment, nor was it reflected in their functions within their respective palaces. St Stephen’s was the largest chapel within the Westminster Palace complex, but it was not the dominant ecclesiastical institution in the area, which was instead Westminster Abbey. St George’s, however, was one of two major chapels within Windsor Castle, and had no other local college until the fifteenth century when Eton College was founded across the River Thames. St George’s was also shaped by comparative lack of royal interest at Windsor for most of the fifteenth century, when St Stephen’s and Westminster continued to be favoured. In both their similarities and differences, comparing St Stephen’s and St George’s allows us to see a range of possibilities of interaction of the institutions, their members and their royal patrons. In addition to St Stephen’s and its sister college of St George’s, Windsor – founded on the same day by Edward III – this book will examine in passing some of the other major late medieval foundations, including the later royal foundations of Eton and King’s College, Cambridge, the noble foundations at St Mary’s Warwick, St Mary’s in the Newarke, Fotheringhay and Tattershall, and the earlier colleges that Edward III would have known when he drew up his plans for his foundations at Windsor and Westminster. The comparisons fall into three types. The first are those colleges that had a similar type and scale to St Stephen’s, large colleges with substantial endowments that were founded by laymen and women to pray for the souls of the dead. These colleges then overlap with the second category, those colleges founded or inherited by the kings of England, who became their patrons, and held the right of presenting new canons to them. Both these categories might interact with St Stephen’s and might share personnel with it. For St George’s Chapel, Windsor, in the Late Middle Ages, ed. C. Richmond and E.

The third category is the most diverse and includes those colleges extant in 1348 when Edward III founded St Stephen’s and St George’s in order to ask what were the models available to Edward as he developed his plans for his new colleges. These include the secular cathedrals, the colleges within the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and a set of smaller colleges known as the royal free chapels in England, as well as the important overseas foundations in Paris and Aachen. All of these colleges place St Stephen’s within a type of foundation familiar to medieval religion, but which has almost entirely been lost today. There was no one St Stephen’s College. Rather there were many, as each generation of canons and monarchs reshaped the institution to their own needs and to meet changing expectations of what a royally supported institution should look like, as well as changing fashions in the lay patronage of the Church. At the end of the college’s life it would have to reckon with the theological and practical changes of the Reformation. Like at any other institution within the Church in this period, St Stephen’s had quite a lot of leeway to interpret its statutes, develop its own customs and manage its finances. Its canons valued their housing and friendships within the college and the status it brought them, and in turn made sure that the college’s rights were defended and its finances secured. St Stephen’s was highly responsive and alert to what it meant to be the largest palace chapel within the king’s palace, and not just any palace, but that of Westminster, associated with sacral kingship, governance and justice, since the thirteenth century. The college was also directly shaped by changes in its surroundings in the Palace of Westminster and by the plans of the kings of England for the palace. The chapel was always a visible demonstration to those visiting the palace of the lavish support for the liturgy offered first by Edward III and then taken up by his successors. The cult image of St Mary le Pew was in itself a draw to visitors seeking indulgences. St Stephen’s mattered beyond simply a religious destination. As the kings of England and their subjects grappled with questions about the community of the realm and the king’s rights in relation to that community, St Stephen’s provided evidence to a wide audience of the multiple ways in which English kings drew legitimacy from their coronations, their ancestors, and their relationship with the world of governance and justice based Williamson, ‘Eton College’,"
