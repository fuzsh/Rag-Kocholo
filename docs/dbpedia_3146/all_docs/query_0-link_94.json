FORSHALL, A FORMER QUEEN'S SCHOLAR. LONDON : WYMAN & SONS, 74-76, GREAT f's-INN 1884. {AH rights reserved. ) %>°\\ I9S-03 WYMAN AND SONS, PRINTERS, GREAT QUEEN STREET, LINCOLN 'S-INN FIELDS, LONDON, W.C. 1 yi Ff- PREFACE. ~TI /T Y primary aim in the following pages has been not so -•^J- much to write a history of Westminster School, as to preserve some record of those customs and usages of the School which, from the rapid changes in modern ideas of education, have in great part perished ; and all of which, in the course of one or two more generations, will have pro- bably become obsolete. Such customs and usages are valuable from their historical associations. They form part of that severe and exact discipline which has enabled a School, once beyond dispute the most famous in England, to send forth so many champions who have done valiantly in the Church, the Senate, and the Field. Other Public Schools may boast to have equal historical claims in this respect with Westminster ; and if numerical excellence be the test we may be disposed to allow the equality. But no School, regarded as a unit, has placed its signature on the scroll of history in such clear and distinct characters as from time to time have been traced out by West- minster. We look to the Universities, and we see, in the time of James II., a compact, recognised party of \"Westminsters\" bearing the brunt of the struggle with the Romanising influences at work in Oxford. We scan the wider arena of politics, and we find ministries during the reigns of the Hanoverian sovereigns, and during the present reign, largely vi Westminster School. composed of Westminster men, amounting sometimes to almost half the entire Ministry.* Nor less conspicuous is this predominance of power in the Hierarchy of Great Britain. It was Busby's boast that sixteen bishops held at one period sees who had been his pupils, — a number not far short of half the bishops at that time holding sees in the United Kingdom. Still clearer is the stamp of Westminster on the military forces of the Empire. It is known on sufficient authority, that the Duke of Wellington gave the Westminster officers of his staff the credit of being \" the best officers he ever had.\"f In the Crimean War, the Commander-in-Chief, the Chief of the Artillery, two successive Chiefs of the Cavalry, and the Quartermaster-General, had been all educated at Westminster. Hence it is no exaggeration to * In 1714 five Westminsters were included in the Ministry : — Charles Earl of Halifax, First Lord of the Treasury ; William Lord Cowper, afterwards Earl Cowper, Lord Chancellor ; Daniel Finch, Earl of Nottingham, Lord President ; Edward Harley, Earl of Oxford, Admiralty ; and Mr. Pulteney. In 1744 there were also five : — Henry Pelham, First Lord of the Treasury ; the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary-of-State for the Southern Department ; the Duke of Dorset, President of the Council ; Earl Gower, Privy Seal ; the Duke of Eichmond. In 1757 six Westminsters held office :— the Duke of Newcastle, First Lord of the Treasury ; Lord Henley, Lord Keeper ; Lord Granville ; the Earl of Holdernesse ; the Duke of Devonshire ; Earl Gower. In 1848 there were eight Westminsters in the Ministry : — Lord John Eussell, First Lord of the Treasury ; the Marquis of Lansdowne, Lord President ; Lord Broughton, President of the Board of Control ; the Marquis of Anglesea, Master-General of Ordnance ; the Marquis of Westminster, Lord Steward ; Sir John Jervis, Attorney-General ; Sir David Dundas, Solicitor-General ; Lord Fitzroy Somerset, Military Secretary. t See evidence of the Eev.

Preface. vii say that the entire British army in that campaign was dependent for its safety, conduct, and comfort on five men, who a few years previously had been five Westminster boys.* For customs and usages under which such men were trained we may justly claim a value separate from and beyond that of historical association. It may reasonably become a speculative question whether these very usages had not a real and definite influence upon their success. And such a question has special interest now, when the school is passing through a critical, and what may be almost termed a probationary, period. A century has not nearly elapsed since Westminster had but one rival, and that rival in a great measure dependent on the proximity of the Court, and the favor of the Sovereign. To-day, when her name is mentioned, it is in faltering and uncertain tones. A glorious future may yet await her, but it is the future of a modernised and almost re-modelled school. An Act of Parliament has played havoc with her rich endowments at the Universities, and such as are left have been thrown open to the whole school for competition. The hand of modern improvement has been at work for the comfort and ac- commodation of the boys, and this has rendered necessary some external changes. In the schoolroom a flat whitened wall has taken the place of the graceful cavity of the \"shell.'\" The interior of \" College \" has surrendered its look of antique simplicity in favor of modern stoves and modern cubicles. As if to inaugurate a renaissance, the motto of the School has been changed back to the old \" Dat Deus incrementum,\" — very suitable to the infancy of a school, * Lord Raglan, Commander-in-Chief ; Sir W. Cator, Chief of Artillery ; Lord Lucan, and afterwards Lord George Paget, Chiefs of Cavalry ; Lord de Ros, Quartermaster-General. viii Westminster School. but lacking all the dash both of sound and sentiment possessed by \" in patriam populumque.\" But if such and similar changes are of no serious import, and awaken the regrets of those only who belong to a former generation, the same cannot be said of the endow- ments at Christchurch, Oxford, and Trinity College, Cam- bridge. An exhibition of £40 a year to be held for three years and a quarter is but a poor substitute for a scholarship at Trinity. Still worse is the substitution for a studentship at Christchurch of a scholarship to be held for two years, but capable of being extended to three more in case of a good report of the scholar's conduct and industry. The throwing open of these exhibitions and scholarships to the whole school, deprived the foundation boys at one blow of most of their privileges, and left them but this advantage over the Town boys, that their maintenance and tuition costs about sixty pounds a year less. As regards the Queen's scholars themselves and not their parents, it would be more correct to say that it left them in an inferior position. The old great prizes at Oxford and Cambridge existing no longer for them, the school rank, which a place on the foundation under the old regime undoubtedly conferred, is evidently lost, and the desire once felt by men of wealth and high position to place their sons \"in College\" will cease, and the foundation boys at Westminster will become, as they have become at other public schools, not the honored and honorable class, but a foil for the pride of the aristocratic landowner's heir, or the vanity of the purse-proud merchant's son. To an ordinary mind, to minimize the rewards which a school has to offer, does seem a strange way of raising it in a time of depression, and one can only suppose that this modern legislation was not meant for the interests of Westminster School, but for those of the community at large. Yet, in spite of indignities and spoliations, the School has greatly Preface. ix increased in numbers, and may yet regain its old pre- eminence in the rank of English public schools. It may even, as of yore, find fresh patrons from its own sons to lavish their wealth for fresh endowments. Then, when but for some written record, all real knowledge of what the old Queen's scholar and Town boy life was, must have been lost in the uncertain mutterings of the vaguest tradition, these annals may possess a new and a more real interest than they do now. My second object was that old Westminsters, resting in their arm-chairs, might by help of the following pages, more vividly recall the time when they rested, less softly perhaps but not less comfortably, in those arm-chairs by the Upper, Under, or Middle Fires, and by the single word \" Election/' as surely, and almost as instantaneously as Aladdin by aid of his ring, summoned around them youth- ful genii to do their utmost bidding — whatever that bidding might be, were it only possible, — that they might have on their table the record of the boat-race won against such desperate odds ; and of the Play in which they acted, as Westminsters alone of mankind ever have, amid the plaudits of \" Gods \" and men. For general readers, it is hoped that the annals of a School which has trained so many boys of diverse genius, in different epochs, under masters, not a few of whom con- ferred distinction on the age in which they lived, must embrace much to interest and somewhat to entertain. For such readers I may here not inaptly quote the following passage from Dean Stanley's \" Memorials of Westminster Abbey\":— \"Whilst the dignitaries of the ancient Abbey, as we have seen, hardly left any moral or intellectual mark on their age, there have been those in the catalogue of former Deans, Prebendaries, and Masters — not to speak of innumerable x Westminster School. names among the scholars of Westminster, — who will probably never cease to awaken a recollection as long as the British Commonwealth lasts. \" It is always pleasant to know something of the boyish feelings and doings of those whose writings have amused or instructed our own reading hours, or whose actions have benefited our own century. Would, indeed, that such school notices had not been in so unsatisfactory and fragmentary a condition. But it is only by a rare combination of chances that a boy's doings at school can ever become the subject of permanent record. The famous man must first die. Then there must be living some one who was at school with him ; who had a great re- gard for him ; a man of good memory ; a man engaged on some publication into which he can introduce reminiscences of his friend. And these several conditions are seldom found united, whilst, excepting under such, any record of school- life is well nigh an impossibility. The names selected for biographical notice are not always the most distinguished, but such as I thought would be of most interest to the general reader. I have been sparing in my accounts of men who were merely academi- cally or professionally distinguished. Old Westminsters have always the \" Alumni \" at hand, whenever they wish to refresh themselves with the memoirs of their hard-working predecessors, whilst others would find little pleasure in perusing long lists of academical honors, church prefer- ments, or legal dignities. Members of families who for generations have furnished scholars to Westminster, have commonly been noticed; also Masters of the School, personal friends, or old schoolfellows, where on other grounds there might appear no sufficient reason for the insertion. Facts and dates I have freely and generally taken from the \" Alumni,\" views of character and independent observations have not been transcribed, and consequently the biographies Preface. xi here, so far as they are copies of those in the \" Aluinni,\" are but skeletons of the finished sketches to be found there. I have mentioned the names of all the Queen's scholars who have been at Westminster since the date of the publication of the \" Alumni/' along with the notes which were found in a copy of that work most kindly lent to me by the Rev. Henry Manning Ingram, late Under-master. I have added somewhat to these notes by means of the Clergy List, the Army List, the Legal and Medical Registers ; but I had neither leisure nor facilities for prosecuting thorough inquiries. It is to be hoped that at some future time the publication to which allusion has just been made, will be continued by some old Westminster, who will have both time and means at his disposal for so doing. The \" Alumni Westmonasterienses \" was published in 1852. Of this work it is bare justice to say that West- minsters past, present, and to come, do owe, and will always owe, a lasting debt of gratitude to the editor, Charles Bagot Phillimore. The labor gone through by this gentleman, the patient research with which he has elucidated obscurities, his pains in chronicling minute occurrences, his unflinch- ing perseverance in writing ample notices of the lives of meritorious old Westminsters, where many with such a task in hand would have been too ready to make a long story short, can be appreciated only by those who have read through his biographies, and even by those very in- adequately. And all this time and labor was spent, — not to gain glory before the world, or to increase wealth, but simply for the honor and gratification of the School, of which he has ever been the devoted friend and supporter, and upon which the eminent merits of himself and his relatives have conferred such great distinction. The accounts of the prologues and epilogues have been xii Westminster School. abbreviated from the notes to the \"Lusus Alteri West- monasterienses.\" The epigrams spoken at the Election dinners have also been chiefly taken from this publication. The \" Lusus \" contains all the known prologues and epi- logues to the Plays acted at Westminster School, with exhaustive explanatory notes. These compositions had to be gathered together ; some from a small old collection by Prior, for the most part without dates, and altogether without notes; some from magazines, periodicals, and old news- papers ; some from private memoranda. The dates of the early ones had to be assigned from internal evidence, or other considerations. To do this, and to write the copious explanations required much application, learning, and sagacity. Three editors devoted themselves to the task. The first of these was James Mure, Esq., whose name is loved and reverenced by all Westminsters old and young, and to whose memory the Mure Scholarship constitutes a noble and enduring monument. The second was the Rev. Henry Bull, who [has manifested an untiring devotion to the School, from the day on which he was elected from it to Christchurch, Oxford, in 1815. Before he had taken his degree of M.A. he was appointed one of the Ushers of Westminster School, and in 1821 Under-master. During this time of assiduous labor, and after his retirement, he supplied on several occasions epilogues to the Plays, and furnished many epigrams to the Election dinners, and has been ever ready with his counsel to advise, and his presence to animate both masters and scholars. At a time of life, when most men would be courting retirement and repose, he is still vigorous and active ; still ready with service of body and mind to benefit the place of his education, as I have lately had reason to experience with feelings of wonder and admiration. The third editor, the Rev. Charles Brodrick Scott, connected with the School by a tie re- Preface. xiii sembling the parental rather than the filial, in addition to giving his most valuable assistance in the preparation of the \" Lusus,\" has largely adorned its pages with prologues and other classical compositions worthy of a scholar who had no superior in the Classical Tripos at Cambridge. The narration of three years and a half of my school life, as Town boy and Queen's scholar, has been inserted, as the most convenient way of communicating the information I desired respecting the manners and habits of the School. Indeed it would have been difficult to convey the same information in any other way, which should not have been much less agreeable to the reader, and much less easy to the composer. I am aware that there must be very many imperfections in the execution of the whole work, not only in matters of detail but in the arrangement and grouping together of the different parts. There did not however seem likely to come forward any one who might have done justice to the sub- ject by artistic arrangement and a genial style of writing ; and I knew that the real value of this miscellaneous account lay in the facts embodied, not in its literary merits. It is, at the best, but a compilation, and has no independent claim to respect whatever. The writing has been proceeded with under the double disadvantage of the pressure of necessary work, and the impossibility of obtaining constant access to books of reference. A word should be said respecting the translations. It was suggested to me by one who was properly qualified to know, and whose suggestions, as tried by events, have ever evinced good and sound judgment, that ladies feel no slight chagrin if, whilst reading, they meet with passages in a foreign language which they are unable to understand. Forewarned of such a contingency, I have translated for them all the Latin quoted, whether prose or verse. But xiv Westminster School. for this suggestion no translations of my own would have appeared. My initials, F. H. F., are affixed to each. To those old Westminsters who have assisted me with informa- tion or support, I return my sincere and heartfelt thanks. First, to the Rev. Henry Manning Ingram, late Under- master of Westminster School. To this gentleman my lasting gratitude is due, not only for the invaluable loan of his annotated copy of the \" Alumni Westmonasterienses/' but also for his constant kindness and patience in replying to every inquiry and affording me every information in his power. Next, I would offer my heartfelt thanks to my old schoolfellows, the Rev. William Scratton, and the Rev. Henry Blagden, for their ready support and kind suggestions. My old Master, the Rev. John Benthall deserves my grate- ful acknowledgments for his capital versions of Hall Epigrams ; and not less my old Captain and constant friend, Mr. Henry Raine Barker, for immediately replying to queries, whenever I have referred some vexed point to him. I return my sincere thanks to Mr. Clement Charles Julian Webb, Captain of the Queen's Scholars, for his courtesy in allowing me access to the Water Ledger, and for some account furnished by him of the prize-winners ; also to Mr. Frederick Ellerker Lewin, Scholar of Christchurch, for some information imparted respecting the School. Be achy View, Eastbourne, December, 1883. Note. — After the \" Reminiscences '' had been some time in print the Rev. Ernest Horatio May, who was at the School nearly thirty years after I had left it, wrote enclosing his name as that of a subscriber. I had selected the name \"May\" for the anecdote on page 16, believing at the time that it was a name not known in the School.

FORTY years ago the choice was offered me by my father of becoming a day-boarder at the Charterhouse or at Westminster. In my view there was a great deal in a name, and the name borne by the two most historical buildings in Great Britain seemed to decide for me. I had been for a year and a half at a small private school in the country, where I had been well grounded in Latin and Greek grammar, and the art of Latin versification, as expounded by Bland; not, however, in the Westminster Grammars — those collections of much learning, and many rules — put together before stems and crude forms had been much thought of by boys, and before such philosophic terms as \" trajective \" words had been even heard of by them. Except in the library of some old Westminster, or amidst the lumber of Ginger's* storerooms, it would be vain now to search for a West- minster Grammar. As three weeks were yet to spare * The last of the Gingers died a few years ago. The family were the School booksellers for nearly a century. At present the book business is in the hands of the School authorities, and the profits are applied for the benefit of the School. 2 Personal Reminiscences. before the school-term commenced, I set to work to do what I could with my new Grammars. The hexameters were very rugged, and I had not made much progress, when the day came for me to enter the school. Ac- cordingly at a quarter past seven on a January morning I started from my parents' house, distant about two miles from the school. Filled with many expectant and some troubled thoughts, I trudged along, till, on nearing the Abbey, I stumbled and fell over one of the gravestones in St. Margaret's churchyard. The omen, no doubt, was a bad one, but my attention was directed to my dress, which was torn at the knee ; and in this disreputable condition I pre- sented myself for a few minutes at Scott's boarding-house, and shortly afterwards, amid loud shouts from the throats of many small boys, who appeared to be dancing a \" corro- boree \"* round a tall gentleman in cap and gown, passed through Little Dean's Yard, ascended the school steps, and entered the schoolroom. For the benefit of readers who have never been at West- minster School, I should explain that, under the archway between Great and Little Dean's Yard, close to the door by which the Head-master left his house for school, the boys of the Under School were expected to congregate at the appointed hours of school, and to shout together as soon as the Head-master appeared. Their shout was aloud inde- finite noise, but it was instantly invested with very definite meaning by the \" Calls \" standing ready in the halls of the three boarding-houses, and in the porch of \" College\" — that is, the one long chamber which in those days served the Queen's scholars as sitting-room and bedroom. These \" Calls,\" with all the power of their lungs, gave utterance in a sort of chant to the words, <( Williamson coming.\" I have endeavoured by means of the short and long marks over the syllables to give an idea of the rhythm of the cry. It was thus systematically and strongly intoned, in order that the sound might penetrate into every room of the * The dance of the Australian blacks. Shadow and Substance. 3 boarding-houses, and throughout the whole length of College. The Calls for the boarding-houses were junior Town boys; for College, junior Queen's scholars. The office of thus publishing the advent of the head-master was held in weekly rotation by the junior boys in College and out. Here, as elsewhere in this first chapter, I allude to facts which did not come within my knowledge on my first day, but which are more conveniently mentioned here. The Head-master then walked very slowly up Little Dean's Yard to the vestibule outside the inner doors of school, where he was joined by the Under-master, and the two other masters. After waiting about five minutes to allow the boys time to settle into their places, the masters entered the schoolroom. But, as a further notice of the actual moment of their entry was deemed necessary, a boy of the Under School had, during the aforesaid five minutes, to keep his eye close to a circular hole in the door — large enough to admit a good-sized marble — and to announce by one single shout of \" coming \" the forward movement of the masters. On their entrance Latin prayers were read by the monitor of school, kneeling on a small square, marked or let into the floor, about the centre of the room, opposite the monitor's table, the masters kneeling in line behind him. After prayers the Head-master usually pro- ceeded to his chair, in front of which was a table. These stood at the top of the room, before the cavity in which were the seats of the Shell Form, so that the Head-master faced all the boys excepting the tenants of the \" Shell.\"* On this morning, however, as was customary in the case of a new boy, he, in conjunction with the Under-master, examined me for a few minutes in the centre of the room. After some questions in Greek and Latin, parsing andt rans- lation, I was placed by him in the Upper Fourth. Almost immediately, the master in charge of this form, the Rev. J. Benthall, called me to him, and along with me * The boys of the Upper and Under Shell came to the benches of the Fifth Form in order to say their lessons. B 2 4 Personal Reminiscences. another boy, whom he assigned to me as my \" Substance.\" I was the \" Shadow.\" The ' ' Substance \" was, for the space of a week, responsible for the proper conduct of his \" Shadow.\" It was the business of the \" Substance \" to see that his \" Shadow \" knew the hours of school, the books to be obtained, the lessons to be learnt, and to instruct him generally in all the ceremonial law and etiquette of the school, both inside the schoolroom and out, which would otherwise have been no easy task for a new comer to acquire. The \" Substance\" could be punished, if he was found to have neglected his duty in any particular ; and whatever offence was committed by the \" Shadow,\" for this the ' ' Substance \" was responsible, as though he had been him- self the offender. In saying lessons the \" Shadow \" could not \"take up\" his \" Substance/' but he could by answering correctly prevent others from taking him. I had already begun my transgressions, by appearing in Dean's Yard with a peaked cap. Pot hats only were allowed to be worn by boys not on the foundation — the Queen's scholars wore trenchers. Therefore, for the rest of that day, I had to go bareheaded. This could not be considered in any way a punishment, because all Town boys below the Sixth, and the two junior Elections of Queen's scholars, also were obliged to go bareheaded during the short intervals of recreation, that is, between breakfast and school, and between dinner and school. After I had received some brief hints from my \" Substance,\" and had leisure to fix my attention on things around, the scene appeared to me not only novel, but even imposing. The noble proportions and venerable appearance of the schoolroom, looking fit to be, as, indeed, it had been for more than three centuries, the nursery of scholars to be afterwards famous in every department of civil and military life — the masters in their caps and gowns; the monitors walking hither and thither with rods in their hands; the manly forms of the Seniors,* as they sat opposite, either engaged * The Queen's Scholars passed four years in College. During the first First Impressions. 5 with their books or talking in low tones — school and scholars alike could not but powerfully impress the mind of a boy of thirteen, who had been accustomed to repeat his lessons in a small room, fitted with a few conventional desks, before an elderly gentleman in a decent suit of iron grey, or a younger gentleman in a shooting-coat. I was amazed at the freedom with which the Sixth Form stalked in or out of school, apparently without leave asked, though, to my inexperienced eye, they seemed too big and old to require leave. In reality, the Sixth Form and Seniors wrote their names on a slip of paper, adding the time by the Head-master's watch, which lay during school hours on his table, and left the paper before him. Mingled with feelings of reverence and awe came also a sense of my own insignificance. What profound knowledge of Latin and Greek authors did I not suppose to be in the possession of those dark, and pale, and half-bewhiskered Seniors, who appeared so tall and stout ! And, indeed, some of the ten young men composing that senior year must have been — imagination apart — of athletic build and goodly mould. Amongst them was the future \" Stroke\" of the Oxford Uni- versity Eight, as well as one who, but for illness, might have been Stroke of the Cambridge University Eight, and also the future \"No. 2\" in the Oxford University boat. At twelve o'clock, after prayers, read again in Latin, I was told by my \" Substance \" to go into the \" Green/' where \" station\" was. I knew the \" Green\" meant the enclosure iu Great Dean's Yard ; but I wondered a good deal what could be meant by \" station,\" nor did I fully comprehend the term until I had been some days at school. For the benefit of lay readers, I explain it here. Of the three monitors, one was called monitor of school, one of chamber, one of station. Each monitor held one of these offices for a week, and then changed to another. The duty of the monitor of station was to fix the locality of all the junior year they were called \"Juniors\"; during the next, \"second Election\"; during the third, \" third Election \"; and \" Seniors \" in the last. G Personal Reminiscences. boys in the school during play-hours. In theory, this was at his discretion, and had he fixed ' ' station \" on the top of a house, the boys would, no doubt, have done their best to get there. In practice, \" station \" was, in autumn and winter, in the football green at twelve o'clock ; at five till evening \" lockers\"* in College. In spring and summer it was in the cricket-field, or on the water at twelve o'clock, and also in the evening. After breakfast and dinner, \" station \" was, for the junior Queen's scholars, in College ; for the junior Town boys, in their boarding-houses ; but this did not prevent them from going about Dean's Yard and the adjacent streets at those times, so long as they kept within bounds. In the Green, I was assigned a place as one of the goal-keepers. By the scientific players of these days, our then game would be considered but a crude, barbaric sport. It was neither the Rugby Game, nor the Rugby Union, nor the Association. The width between the two goals was the whole length of the Green, and the goals were imaginary lines at either end, a few yards in advance of the railings — lines recognised, but as truly imaginary as the equator, or a parallel of latitude, which sometimes appears in a treaty or other document to fix the frontiers of two counties. There were an indefinite number of goal-keepers, perhaps eight or ten ; for, as the distance between the goals was short, and the breadth of the goals comparatively great, a \" goal \" would otherwise have been too easily obtained. The rules were very simple. Sides were chosen from all the boys in the \" Green.\" Holding and throwing were not allowed, but the scrimmages were sufficiently hot, and a \" rally\" by the iron railings became sometimes agonising, if not dangerous. At half past one I left the ' ' Green \" for my boarding- house, in order to dine. Some who read this will, no doubt, remember the lady who kept it — Mrs. Scott — her kindness of heart, her ready sympathy with young boys in their * The hours during which the boys were locked up — the Queen's scholars in college, the Town boys in their boarding-houses, — a corruption of \" lock hours.\" Jemmy Smidmore. 7 troubles and difficulties, her pride in the school, her digni- fied patience with the occasionally annoying vivacity of both big and little boys — a patience sometimes too sorely tried, especially at breakfast. On such occasions, when expostu- lation and appeal, in many tones and forms, had failed to quell sedition, her last resource was to send for the master who had charge of the house. He resided at some little distance, and, as a rule, did nothing at the boarding-house, except to robe for school, and on half-holidays to correct Latin verses during the first hour of \" lockers/'' When sent for in the way above alluded to, he arrived in about ten minutes, by which time the necessity for his coming had commonly disappeared. After a few words of deprecation — \" What's the matter here ? I hope I shall hear no more of this\" — he would depart, it may be presumed, to finish his own breakfast. The breakfast provided for us consisted only of bread or toast, butter, and tea. Ham, eggs, potted meats, &c, &c, if required, had to be sent for from Shot- ton, the confectioner, or Sutcliffe, the grocer, and on these errands the \"fags\"* were largely employed. It may be supposed that a good many rounds of toast were required, and many could be toasted at once on an apparatus with projecting hooks before a large fire. Juniors were deputed to go down to the kitchen to make hot rounds of toast for this or that Senior, and these additions materially supple- mented the platefuls brought in from time to time by the man-servant of the house, Jemmy Smidmore. Who that was at Scott's in those days can forget Jemmy Smidmore — his squeaking voice, his extraordinary figure, his wriggling gait, his hurried and flat-footed step, his portly wife, too, who kept a little shop in Dean Street hard by, and sold eggs and fruit ? Notwithstanding his physical peculiarities, Smidmore was a valued and trusty servant. Dinner at the boarding-houses was for the Town boys only. The Queen's scholars dined in hall ; the Seniors * The term \" fag \" was applied only to Town boys. The words \" fag \" and \" fagging \" were unknown in College, where \" Junior \" was the only designation allowed. 8 Personal Reminiscences. and third Election often at Shotton's — of course, at their own expense. The boarding-houses were the refuge of all sick boys, whether Town boys or Queen's scholars. What I did after dinner, I recollect not now. Probably I walked about some of the back streets. The archway fronting the Abbey formed the limit of our bounds on one side of Dean's Yard ; beyond the opposite archway we might traverse any of the streets adjacent, so that we did not pass beyond College Street in the direction of Poets' Corner. A walk, for the sake of a walk, was very seldom attempted, excepting after church on Sunday morning, and it was usually taken up the river bank past the Penitentiary and Yauxhall Bridge. Whether on that first day I walked or not, at 2.30 school again began. There was the same shouting at the archway, the same prayers in school. We said our Virgil, took down matter for Latin verses, and at five o'clock came out. It was too early in the year for cricket or rowing, and, as \" lockers\" were at six o'clock, the day-boarders were at once free to return home. In the summer months we had to go with the rest in the boats or to the cricket-field ; and, during these months, the life of a day-boarder who had far to walk after school was fatiguing. At that season I did not reach home till 8.30, occasionally later. Then a hurried meal had to be taken, and lessons prepared for the next day. I was often painfully tired in the morning. A walk of two miles at 7.15 a.m., cricket or rowing in the middle of the day, cricket or rowing again in the evening, and then the walk home constituted trying exercise for a boy of thirteen, and sufficient to justify retiring to bed after supper, without preparing translation of Homer, and writing Latin exercise. In those days lessons, however hard, were always a labour of love. I was, in Westminster phraseology, a muzz, that is, one who carefully prepared his school-work. As at most schools in those days, and I have reason to suppose now, idleness was the rule, work the exception ; a few boys, muzzesj learnt their lessons well, and construed them over to the others of their form in school, before going up to the The \"Monos\" 9 master. The next day, provided with a pot hat, I re- appeared in Dean's Yard, and went through a similar round of work and play. And so for some weeks, during which I became enlightened on sundry points of school ceremonial. Amongst other things, I learnt what were the duties of the \" Monos.\" * The \" Monos \" was a Queen's scholar of the second year, or \" Election.-\" The office was diurnal, and taken in rotation by the boys of that year. His post was in Little Dean's Yard. It was his business to prevent strangers — who might, with a pardonable feeling of curiosity, wish to ascend the school steps with a view to see what was going on in the school — from so doing. It was also his business to report the time of day to the monitor of school. It need hardly be added that, in his case, all school work was excused. At 11.30 in the morning, the \" Monos\" came \"up school '' to the monitors' table, and said : \" Sesqui est et undecima \" — \" it is half- past eleven.\" The monitor of school immediately took a rod from the drawer of the monitors' table — a drawer which was always open, and in which always lay three or four rods with their twigs projecting — and, going up to the Head-master, repeated the Latin words. The Head-master bowed, to show that he appreciated the intelligence. At a quarter to twelve the \"Monos\" again came up, and this time said: \"Instat hora\" — \" the hour is at hand\" — which was taken up, as before, by the monitor of school, or, in his absence, by one of the other monitors. I should say here, that the monitors always carried a rod whenever they left their seats in school, unless for the purpose of quitting the room. At twelve o'clock the \"Monos\" once more came up, and said: \" Insonuit hora\" — \" the hour has struck\" When the monitor had delivered this last message, the Head-master rose, and went down the schoolroom to prayers. In the afternoon a similar form was gone through ; but \" sesqui est et quarta \" was substituted for \" sesqui est et undecima.\" The chimes of the Abbey * Abbreviated from \" monitor ostii \" — \" monitor of the door\" 10 Personal Reminiscences. clock regulated the time. As may be imagined, the day passed rather slowly with the \"Monos.\" He could, indeed, play rackets by himself, or with any boy who might come out of school for a few minutes, — that was all. Still, in the eyes of most boys, the \" studiorum rernissio\" — \"the forgiveness of lessons \" — was a sufficient recompense for the monotony. I was spectator of the corporal punishment of some boy, or boys, daily. As before mentioned, the instruments of punishment were always at hand in the drawer of the monitors' table. In my time, the rods were made by College John.* In days before this, they used to be made in the rod-room, at the back of the shell, by the hands of Juniors. College John received a shilling for each rod. The handle was about eighteen inches long, formed of the thicker parts of the twigs, with short pieces inserted to make the handle thicker and more graspable, and from these the fine ends sprouted forth, duly besprinkled with buds.f School floggings were administered before the whole school : for the Upper School boys, at the right-hand side of the Head-master's table, as you enter the school- room ; for the Under School, by the Under-master at his chair. The other masters had no chastising powers, except the unofficial ones of pulling hair or boxing ears. On the occasion of a flogging, the form gone through was as follows : The master who wished to have a boy flogged, said to one near him, \" Fetch me a monitor.\" On the * The Juniors admitted into St. Peter's College in 1828 were the last who made rods. The College Porter was always designated as \" College John,\" whatever might be his name. The man here referred to was William Lloyd, a most excellent servant. He was knocked down by a Hansom cab, whilst crossing Palace Yard, March 19th, 1866, and died from the injuries received. f The Westminster rod was no mere collection of twigs, but an instrument of highly finished construction. The twigs that projected beyond the string-bound handle were eight in number, never more, never less ; and a twig loose, if one ever was seen in this condition, must have been a very rare sight. They wore down to stumps by use, and were then replaced. A Punch Party Interrupted. 11 arrival of the \" monitor/' the master would say, ■' My compliments to Dr. Williamson, and Jones has done no exercise.\" The monitor, followed by Jones, took this message up to the Head-master, who then rose, and taking the rod from the monitor, administered either three or six cuts, according to the gravity of the offence, on the back of the hand. No more were ever given. For the graver and more ignominious kind of punishment, an assistant was deemed necessary. The Head-master, having prepared himself, called out, \" Take this boy up.\" Thereupon, a boy of the same form came forward and placed himself in front of the guilty one, who, on his part, after making due prepara- tions, placed his two hands on the assistant's shoulders. Occasionally a cut somewhat miscalculated, \"incesto addidit integrum\" — \"caused the innocent to suffer with the guilty33 — but this was rarely the case. If a boy pleaded \" first fault,\" he was let off for that time. The flogging over — confined, as in the milder form, to three or six cuts — the Doctor threw the rod some way from him with a peculiar grace, perhaps natural, perhaps acquired by long practice, and then the rod was picked up by some Junior, who always took it up in a fold of his gown, but never touched it with the bare hands, and restored it to its place in the monitors' drawer. When several boys were \" shown up \" for an offence in which they had been jointly con- cerned, it was not unusual for the Head-master to say : \"You had better draw lots.\" In this case, half the number bore the punishment of the whole. I am not able to say whether the strokes were administered with double force to satisfy the Head-master's idea of justice. Even a British jury — the boast of this country — has sometimes hung or transported an innocent man; and so it occasionally happened that the British rod at Westminster sometimes illustrated the impossibility of dealing out per- fect justice to boys. Notably was this the case when, on one Saturday afternoon, there being but four Town boys in at Scott's boarding-house, of whom two were in the Upper School and two in the Under, the two Upper School boys 12 Personal Reminiscences. thought that they might pass a more agreeable and social evening were they to regale themselves with a small bowl of punch. They accordingly obtained the necessary materials, and, after carefully brewing the punch, invited the two younger boys to partake, who, nothing loth, gratefully accepted the offer. But, alas for the short duration of human happiness ! Jemmy Smidmore, the man-servant, alive to the impropriety of this sort of conviviality amongst boys of tender years, informed his mistress that there was something wrong going on up stairs. She, good dame, forthwith ascended, and entered the room, expecting to surprise the carousers, \" flagrante delicto. \" No such thing ! Neither glasses nor punch was to be seen. Forewarned by some observation of the servant, the boys had removed every trace of punch-making and punch- drinking from the room ; every trace — save one, which could not be removed in a minute — the trace left by alcohol on the atmosphere. This was patent to the dame's olfactory organ, but her knowledge of spirituous liquors was not sufficiently extensive to enable her to decide from what particular spirit the pervading odour arose. She accordingly summoned her husband to her aid. He, most dutiful of men, came at her word, and, drawing himself up to his full height — six feet, two inches — after one or two tentative sniffs, delivered his opinion in these simple but oracularly spoken words : \" Rum, my dear.\" And he was right. The conscience-stricken boys could carry their defence no further. On Monday morning the names of the two Under School boys, the only two who had been seen drinking the punch, were brought before the master of the house, and he, in his turn, reported them to the master of the Under School. School honour forbade the accused to say more than that they were quite innocent of punch-making. One was told to prepare for flogging. In a pale and trembling con- dition the little fellow was slowly going through the neces- sary preparations, and the Rev. T. W. Weare had already called out, with severe dignity : \" Take this boy up,\" when one of the Upper School culprits ran up to Hodgson, who The Greaze. 13 was master of their form as well as master of the boarding- house, and assured him that the boy who was about to suffer had nothing whatever to do with the matter. <( Can't interfere now — he's just going to be flogged — don't j* see/' was the answer of the Kev. Hugh Hodgson, given in his usual short bulky accents. So the innocent boy suffered a \" six-cutter/' laid on by a most capable hand. His com- panion was acquitted ; but the two real offenders, I suppose owing to the more merciful nature of the Head-master, got off with three cuts only. Impositions for all forms consisted of lines to be written out from some Latin author, varying in number from fifty to a thousand. The Sixth Form impositions very often consisted of lines to be learnt by heart. As the boys in this Form were amenable to no corporal punishments, they were, in addition to the lines, confined for serious breaches of discipline to Dean's Yard, sometimes for weeks in succes- sion. On Saturday, at twelve o'clock, the Head-master remained in the schoolroom to hear such impositions as were still due. This was termed the Head-master's levee.* Dr. Williamson's wonderful patience on these occasions, little appreciated at the time, must have excited feelings of admiration and gratitude in the breast of many an old Westminster. As no \" leave out \" could be obtained until these back debts had been cleared off, he would wait for a second, third, and even fourth trial, and, finally, would often, appointing some time in the afternoon, give the delinquent one more chance, at his private house. Close to the seats of the Upper Fourth form stood a large oak chest, termed the \" Lost Box.\" Into this were thrust all books found lying about the schoolroom when it was swept out at the end of the day by College John and his assistant, so that any boy had a very good chance of finding a missing book there. The key was kept by the monitor of school. The college official above mentioned must also have gleaned a rich harvest of second-hand quill pens. * There was also levee on two other mornings. 14 Personal Reminiscences. Quill pens only were used in the school, and it was an established custom never to use a pen on two occasions. An exercise written, the pen was thrown on the ground. Little round glass ink bottles, with a piece of cotton-wool in the centre, were used by all the boys. These were called \" dips,\" and could be carried two or three together in one pocket. The only paper used for school purposes was in single sheets of a small quarto size, called (< quarterns.\" In my first week I learnt the meaning of u the greaze.\" One afternoon, the master of our form having left his chair and gone down school, two boys, one at each end, placed their feet against the upright posts at the end of the form next the wall — the forms were in those days parallel to the wall — and began with all their might to squeeze the boys between them. By the pressure, the centre ones were soon forced off their seats. These then ran round to the ex- tremities, and became the squeezers. The game was con- ducted in great silence, and continued generally till the return of the master, when the boys immediately resumed their places, and appeared to be hard at work.

AFTER two or three weeks, strange faces became familiar, though there were some which, for a long time, did not seem to correspond with the names of their owners ; others, brothers, between whom, in consequence of a family likeness, it was difficult to distinguish. Notably there were two who for months furnished me with cases of mistaken identity. These brothers were remarkable on another account — they never went out together on leave to visit their friends on Saturday and Sunday. If one went out, the other was sure to stay in. The persevering curiosity of boys at length fathomed the mystery, which was simple enough. They had but one pair of \" going- out \" inexpressibles between them. There was the usual proportion of \" brags \" and \" shy boys.\" Of the former, Tod was a noted specimen. He was for ever dinning the ears of his schoolfellows with tales of his father's grand position, of his plate, his horses, and liveries. One day a rather threadbare, seedy-looking old gentleman called to see Tod, and, after the interview was over, three or four companions attacked him with : \" I don't think much of your friend, Tod; who is he ? \" \" That ! \" replied Tod ; « Oh— why — that's my father's butler.\" Unfortunately for Tod's dignity, and character for veracity, the old gentleman had previously, unknown to him, inquired by name for Tod as his son. Thrashings, such as ordinarily fall to the lot of boys, fell to mine in these early days. Not \" stick lickings,\" or \" thrashings with the butt-end of a rod,\" or even i( moni- 16 Personal Reminiscences. tors' callings\" — these were to come ; but \" buckhorses,\" * kicks, handings from \"bulleys/'f &c, &c. These minor castigations were, however, sometimes sufficiently sharp, as shown by the fact that a boy of about my own standing, who had received some punishment of the kind, limped so much in walking that the Head-master was induced to demand the cause. \" I sat down on a bone, sir,\" was the reply, accepted as sufficient explanation at the time, though it must have excited no little wonder and speculation in the mind of the kind and sympathising gentleman to whom it was given. There boarded at Scott's with me a boy named May, who, though in the Under School, manifested in his manners and conversation a precocity which might have given him a title to be deemed an advanced thinker, save on subjects of school-work. If he was so, on one occasion, at least, he met with the usual fate of advanced thinkers, who seldom gain the sympathy of their contem- poraries. This boy, having stayed away from school one Monday morning, bethought him how he might escape the consequences which usually await school truants. And it appeared to him that to present a jar of gooseberry jam to the Under-master would probably ensure a free pardon. This he accordingly brought with him up school, wrapped in a clean sheet of white pa/per, and, before any question could be asked, with a graceful bow, and a few well-chosen words, made his offering. But the Rev. T. W. Weare was a man who scorned either the rose-coloured or goose- berry-coloured philanthropy of advanced thinkers, and, so far from being propitiated, was much exasperated at this attempt to corrupt theTFnder-master of Westminster School, and straightway inflicted on the bewildered May a six- cutter in the most ignominious form possible. In respect of shyness, no boy of my time could compare * \" Buckhorse \" was the Westminster term for a box on the ears. t \" Bulleys \" were the ends of the lappets which depended from the Queen's scholars' gowns. These, being tied round with waxed thread, served as formidable instruments of punishment. The word is so spelt here to distinguish it from the ordinary \" bully.\" Dogs Nose. 17 with the highly-sensitive and modest youth who, within the last few years, being in a French class, and called upon by the master to translate a passage having some reference to the toilette, came to the word \" tiroirs.\" Here he stuck fast, not having previously seen the word. The master impatiently called upon him to proceed. The boy, nervous and blushing at first, became still more nervous and blush- ing as the master reiterated his appeals. At length his neighbour prompted, \" drawers/' At this the poor fellow, from being red, became crimson. The master meanwhile was growing warm in his impatience. \" Now, sir, what is it ? Will you please * go on ?\" Driven to desperation, he faintly gasped out, \" Shall we say pantaloons, Sir ? \" — and did not faint away. One afternoon, about a fortnight after my entrance into the school, whilst I was standing in Little Dean's Yard, watching a game of rackets, one of the players, a Senior, called me to him, and said simply, \" Go to Wright's, and ask for a pot of dog's nosef for M .\" I knew Wright's to be the publican close to the archway; but, as I had never heard of any liquid with such a name as dog's nose, I felt in a very nervous condition about the order. The words had been spoken plainly, but yet it seemed to me that I must have understood them wrongly. \" Dog's nose,\" said I to myself. \" Could one ever drink a dog's nose ? How absurd ! Wright will only laugh at me.\" But I dared ask for no explanation, and trudged off to Wright's, and with a great deal of nervous anxiety said, in a desperate manner, as if defying Wright to call me a lunatic, \" A pot of dog's nose for M .\" To my immense relief and surprise, Wright neither smiled nor replied, but left his bar, and returned after two or three minutes, carrying in his hand a pot of some frothing mixture that smelt fragrantly; and I bore it in triumph to M .

C 18 Personal Reminiscences. errand during school, I did not meet with the like success. One summer's afternoon I was deputed by a monitor to bring from the aforesaid Wright some of the same cool beverage, the name of which had once so much perplexed me. I immediately went down school, and one part of my journey, far the larger, I performed easily and pleasantly enough. The perilous remainder commenced on my return to school doors. With both hands behind my back, one holding the precious pewter, the other gently supporting it, my gown covering all, I walked up with an air of non- chalance, though not without some secret trepidation and presentiment of misfortune. On coming close to the Under- master's chair, which I was obliged to pass on my way to the monitors' table, my tfoot tripped a little over some irregularity in the flooring. For a second I stood still, hoping against hope to avert the catastrophe I feared. But splash ! splash ! splash ! on the boards told me in a moment that all attempts at concealment would be futile. The proofs of my guilty attempt were not only audible but visible in a small pool which just touched the chair of the Hypodidascalus. Almost simultaneously with the sound of the third splash, the gravely indignant tones of the Rev. T. W. Weare fell on my ears : \" What have you there V \"A pot of dog's nose, sir,\" was the reply; and it was given to one who felt no nervous perplexity as to its meaning. He had learnt that in days long past. \" Who sent you ?\" \" H sent me, sir.\" H was summoned, and received a severe reprimand and an imposition. No punishment was awarded me by the master, but after school I was the recipient of a very pretty caning for my awkwardness from the monitor. Rackets were played in Little Dean's Yard at all hours. The College wall helped to form an excellent though not professional-looking court, and the wall between the doors of college and the doors of school a small court for fives. No matches were played with other schools, but our constant practice must have produced good players. The balls were large — half the size of a cricket-ball. I have Ballman — Boots. 19 always heard that the smaller sorfc were forbidden, owing to the eye of a boy having been knocked out by smaller balls. An old man known as (C Ballman \" * used to come down every Thursday about four o'clock with a large bag, like that of an old clothes' man, on his back. This con- tained a good supply of balls. He gave credit to his regular customers, and seemed contented with his business and its profits. The price of the balls was one shilling apiece. During these weeks, too, I became acquainted with a grinning, stuttering, idiotic figure, who then, and for some years previously, had been in the habit of prowling about Dean's Yard and the adjacent streets. This man was known to the boys as \" Boots.\" What his real name was, I either never knew or have forgotten. He was liable to shocking attacks of epilepsy, and, when these seized him, would throw himself on the ground, foam at the mouth, and shriek in a hideous manner. Mr. Dasent, in his book, \" Half a Life,\" states that he used to sell ferrets, white mice, and such \" small deer,\" to the boys ; but this trade must have failed him, or the keepers of menageries of the sort had changed their tastes, for all he did as a public character in the days of which I write, was to sing, in an appallingly unnatural manner, a song beginning \" Rise up, William Riley,\" for the amusement of the younger boys, who rewarded him with a few halfpence. It was not uncommon for boys who were on the sick list to give their medicine to Boots, instead of pouring it out of window, and Boots always took this with a relish, whether it was tonic or other. I have seen him since, so late as twelve years ago, or less, in the streets of Croydon, where he was an inmate of the workhouse. Strange to say, though it was quite impossible to mistake his physiognomy, all dis- gusting traits had vanished. I saw only a silly-looking, but merry, old man. I have often met him, wheeling home * I believe that no boy knew his real name, or had any idea from whence he came. c 2 20 Personal Reminiscences, clothes and doing errands of various kinds, but never spoke to him, thinking that if I did it might be a source of future annoyance. I suppose that the epilepsy had left him, and that his brain thus relieved acted in a healthier and more natural manner. At any rate, the change of expression was astonishing, whilst the features remained unchanged, and reminded me of the old thesis : \" Aliusque et idem nascitur.\" Some time during my first week I was the victim of a hoax, which was commonly practised on all new comers who were green enough to be caught. In the little cloisters was a door, with a brass plate on it bearing the inscription \"Gell,\" and opening into the house of the gentleman so named. The joke — I am bound to say, a very poor one — was to persuade a new boy that there was here a fine collection of birds to be seen, which the owner was always delighted to show, and, indeed, that so great was his philanthropic anxiety on this head, that it would be unkind and uncharitable not to ask to see this noble collection. In consequence of these representations, and of the oft-repeated inquiry, \"What, haven't you seen Gell's birds yet V most boys were induced to knock at the brass- plated door, with a view to obtain permission. The summons was answered by a footman, who, upon hearing the request, so far from showing the enthusiasm for natural history attributed to his master, flew into a violent passion, threatening horsewhipping, and on some occasions actually inflicting it. Of my own reception I have no particular recollection. I remember only that it was discourteous enough, and that I retired much abashed. Gradually I became acquainted with the privileges of the Sixth Form. I know not whether I should reckon amongst them the obligation to wear a tail coat, which gave a very sparrow-like appearance to some of the smaller boys, though our Sixth Form never presented so ridiculous a sight as the Harrow sixth on a certain winter morning, if tradition be correct. Dr. Vaughan, when Head-master of that great seminary, returning on a Privileges of the Sixth. 21 dark night from a dinner-party, espied a boy, whom he guessed to belong to the school, taking the air, at a time when he should have been preparing for repose. The boy catching sight of the master, ran for his life. The Doctor gave chase, and was just able to come up with him ; but, in sporting phraseology, had then done all he knew. He managed, however, to grasp the coat-tails of the truant, who, after many a hard pull, got away, leaving one tail in his pursuer's hands. The Doctor felt sure that by means of this tail he should the next day discover the owner of the coat. But even a Head-master's judgment may sometimes be at fault. In the morning, when the Sixth Form presented themselves in school, each boy had but one tail to his coat. The Sixth Form and Seniors walked up or down the school- room. All boys in lower forms had to run.* The boys of the two under Elections were obliged to touch the ends of the rods, as they passed the monitors' table on their way up or down school. The Sixth asked no leave \"down school,\" but when they wished to go out, wrote their names on a slip of paper, adding the time by the Head-master's watch, and left the slip on his table. The captain and monitors went out without ceremony of any kind. The Seniors and Sixth Form alone had the privilege of walking on the west side of Abingdon Street, and alone were allowed to carry their sticks head downwards. * The \" run \" was a slow jog-trot pace acquired by practi( 22 Personal Reminiscences. CHAPTER III. Duties of Captain and Monitors. Principes. The Purchased Principes. BEFORE proceeding, it may be convenient to make a short statement of the respective duties of the cap- tain and the three monitors. The captain was the official representative of the school on all occasions. It was his duty to carry on all correspondence on behalf of the school. He was the channel of communication between masters and boys. He was responsible to the masters for the whole school, and more especially for college. He had charge of all college properties. He received and disbursed all moneys on behalf of the Queen's scholars in their collective capa- city. He could put a stop at once to any proceedings amongst the Queen's scholars which he might consider detrimental to the character of the school. It was his business to write and read the oration on Founder's Day.* He had the privilege of escorting the Head-master's wife to her seat on play nights, and he spoke the prologue. The monitor of school was responsible for the order of the schoolroom. It was his duty to read prayers, and to receive at the commencement of morning as well as after- noon school the names of absentees, which were copied by his Junior into a large book, and this book was placed by him on the Head-master's table. He collected the Sixth Form exercises, \" took up \" the time of day to the Head-master at 11.30, 11.45, and 12 o'clock in the morning, and at 4.30, 4.45, and 5 in the afternoon. It was also his business to see that there were a sufficient number of rods in the drawer. The duties of the monitor of chamber were : to be re-- * This custom has been obsolete for many years. Duties of Captain and Monitors. 23 sponsible for the good conduct of the Queen's scholars whilst in college; to attend upon the Under-master when he came in to prayers at nine o'clock in the evening, or at other times ; and to see that the Juniors were in bed at ten o'clock. The duties of the monitor of station were the lightest of the three. He had simply to announce where station was at the close of morning and afternoon school. Any monitor might perform the duties of another in that other's absence. Both the captain and monitors always carried a rod on quitting their seats, unless it was for the purpose of leaving the room. Principes were given to all forms below the Sixth. These were unmilled silver coins, consequently not current, of the value of fourpence, threepence, twopence, and one penny, given at the end of each quarter to the first three or four boys in each form. Places were taken in the ordinary manner. An account of these places was kept by the master of the form, and made up weekly. At the end of the quarter, he who had stood head most weeks received the head principes ; the second boy, the second, &c. The principes were in great estimation, and carefully treasured by the boys. There must be many old men living who still have their principes preserved, and perhaps their father's and grandfather's. But the best things — even principes — may become agents for evil. And so two boys in the time of Dr. Goodenough found, who, being gifted with excellent capacities, pos- sessed at the same time most idle dispositions. Their father was a rich and munificently liberal man, but made a rule never to give his children money except for work of some kind or other. The elder of these brothers had the good luck to obtain a principe, which he carried in triumph to his father. The father, foreseeing the dawnings of a new spirit in the boy, was vastly pleased, gave him a sove- reign on the spot ; and at the same time, to encourage both brothers, offered to give each a sovereign for a principe, if a penny j two pounds ten shillings, if a twopenny piece ; 2h Personal Reminiscences. ii\\re pounds, if a threepenny piece ; and ten pounds if a four- penny piece should be exhibited. On Monday morning the boys left their home for school, and began to work in earnest. The next Saturday afternoon they were walking together down Wardour Street, and stopped before the window of an old curiosity shop. The first thing that attracted their notice were rows of silver pennies at six- pence each, and twopenny pieces at a shilling. \" Why, Dick,\" said the elder to his brother, e< here's a gold mine.\" He should have said silver mine. The boys entered the shop and spent all the money they had in the purchase of silver pennies and silver twopenny pieces. But how to get their new purchases to market was the question. Day after day they brooded and waited, turning the coins over, and viewing them as a miser would property which it is impossible to realise. A fortnight elapsed, and further delay neither of them could stand. So they went to their father on Saturday afternoon, one with a penny piece, the other with a twopenny, and faces simulating triumph. \" Fm delighted to find you work so well lads. Here is the money I promised, two pounds ten shillings for you, Dick, and one pound for you, Harry. But how do the principes come about so soon again ? I thought they were given but once a term.\" \" That is the case, father,\" said one, \" but our form has done so well this quarter that the master has given a second set.\" And they pocketed their ill-gotten gains, and tried to fancy that all was right. Success, how- ever, only made them more impatient, and, like coiners who must get rid of their base productions, even if they suffer hanging afterwards, so these two young impostors could not endure to allow the lapse even of a specious interval before repeating their demands ; but the next week boldly presented themselves at home, one with a twopenny piece and the other with a penny, stating that an entirely new system of principes had been instituted, and that hence- forward they were to be given twice a quarter. The father gave the promised reward as before ; but this time not without private suspicion, which he resolved to satisfy, The Purchased Principes. 25 Accordingly, on the following Saturday, he paid a visit to the master of their form. \" Mr. \" he said, \" I am truly glad to find my lads so industrious, and nearly always at the top of their form/' \" Your lads industrious ! My dear sir,\" rejoined the master, \" why, they are the two idlest boys in the school, and, as for being nearly always at the top of their form, they scarcely ever stir from the bottom.\" Then the two boys were compelled to avow their guilt. Whereupon, after they had received a severe castigation at parental hands, they underwent a six-cutter from the Head- master, and for a long time after refrained from looking into the windows of curiosity shops. 3.3j Personal Reminiscences. CHAPTER IV. The Fighting Green. James Goodenough. Fights in the Green justified. Discomfiture of the High Constable. Great Burglary by Monks in the Chapel of the Pyx. The Princess Charlotte Witness of a - \" Mill in the Green.\" TOWARDS the end of my first quarter, I was the spec- tator of a \" Fight in the Green.\" Many other fights since seen have faded from my memory. Of this I have still a vivid, almost a minute, impression. It is not very long since the victorious boy met an agonising death in the service of his country, with the same calm, unflinching spirit that he displayed on that morning in the i( Fighting Green. \" I allude to the late James Goodenough, who died from arrow wounds received at Carlisle Bay, in the island of Santa Cruz, whilst in command of H.M.S. Pearl, as Commodore on the Australian station, August 20, 1875. His antagonist was a boy considerably taller than himself, who did all that pluck could do, and was finally carried away in a fainting condition. The \" Fighting Green \" is a nearly square plot of grass, bounded on all sides by the cloisters. No fights were allowed, by the rules of the boys, to take place in any other spot. If two boys quarrelled, and came to blows, they were immediately stopped — authoritatively, if any monitor or Senior happened to be present, or by the inter- position of those around them, or one said to the other, \" Fll fight you in the Green to-morrow.\" Twelve o'clock was the hour. A \" mill * in the Green \" was an exciting event, and looked forward to with interest, varying accord- ing to the fighting capabilities and standing in the school * \" Mill \" was the ordinary Westminster term for a fight. The derivation is obvious. The Fighting Green. 27 of the combatants. On the morning of a fight, \" station \" was \" given out \" in the \" Green,\" and thither every boy in the school was bound to go, except those ordered \" on the water/' if the rowing season had commenced. Two seconds, usually volunteers from the senior year, attended either champion. A ring was formed of all the boys present, which was kept by a \" ring-keeper,\" cane in hand. There were likewise a \" time-keeper,\" and an \" umpire \"; the former with watch in hand to call half-minute time between the rounds ; the latter to settle all questions of appeal. Pitchers of water and sponges were brought into the ring, blankets in cold weather for the use of the com- batants between the rounds, and usually restoratives in case of need. The two boys being stripped to their jerseys, the fight began. It was carried on with all the regularity of a prize-fight, and was similar in all respects, with this capital difference, that victory was the only prize. The boys engaged reclined on their seconds' knees between the rounds, who chafed their hands, and administered advice and encouragement. The chafing of the hands was a very important point, as the subsequent pain from long clenching of the fingers is thereby much lessened. The fight over, which usually lasted till one of the two was exhausted, the opponents shook hands, and the \" Green,\" which, by the way, was in those days any colour but green, from the frequent trampling of feet, was evacuated. The spectacle at first was the reverse of pleasant, and I felt sick at the sight of blood pouring down from many a wound. But use effects wonderful changes in the feelings, and the next term. I was myself an actor in a \"mill in the Green.\" The usual horrors were aggravated in my case, by the fact that the challenge was given on Saturday, a day on which no fight could take place, because most boys went out to their friends on that day. Throughout the Sunday my thoughts were unpleasantly engaged with the impending battle. My antagonist was several inches taller than myself, and was besides an old hand at encounters of the kind ; whereas I had never engaged in a stand-up fight in my 28 Personal Reminiscences. life. In one point, however, and that a most valuable one, I had an advantage — in powers of endurance, or in what I may rightly call constitution — so that when my adversary was unable to come up to time, in spite of cordials — no doubt administered with great judgment, for he had excel- lent seconds — I felt quite ready for another fight, and made this remark to my seconds. The fight lasted about three- quarters of an hour, my adversary scarcely receiving a blow, except on his arms, which were black and blue ; whilst my features were so disfigured, that I was compelled to absent myself from school for a fortnight. It happened — I know not how — that this fight was severely animadverted on in the Morning Chronicle, and some polemical correspondence ensued in certain newspapers between the advocates and opponents of \" fighting in the Green.\" Any arguments in favour of a recognised system of fighting amongst boys would now excite almost as much surprise as though one should propose once more to make Hanover Square the lists of a pugilistic encounter. Never- theless, there can be no doubt that positive good resulted from such a system. Arguments directed against the prize- ring have no bearing whatever on the question, simply because the object in one case is money, in the other honour. Amongst a number of boys at school together, there must, from time to time, be quarrels and personal encounters of some kind. The only question is whether they should be recognised and allowed by the authorities, or should bear the fruit which deeds of darkness usually do bear. Black eyes and damaged noses may be very vulgar and undesirable possessions in the sight of parents and guardians ; but blows on the flesh are not the blows that do injury to the spirit and conscience. I remember no instance of the slightest feeling of malice from a defeated boy towards his companion; nay, they were, as a rule, firmer friends than before. A scrambling fight in hot blood in the corner of a room leaves neither party certain which is the best man. Such a fight is likely to break out again and again. Spite is thus engendered, and of a Fights on the Green Justified. 29 virulent character — spite baulked by feelings of mutual fear, and fed by feelings of mutual jealousy. A \" fight in the Green \" made the superiority of one or other of the combatants clear to all. Thenceforward the question was never re-opened. There was no rankling feeling of humiliation or defeat on the part of the vanquished. He had publicly shown his courage, and was always sure of the sympathy of his friends, and, if not a bully, of all. But the chief good flowing from the publicity and arrange- ment of these fights was that the operations of bullies in a form were thus greatly interfered with. The very preliminaries and surroundings of such fights, often condemned as blackguardly, were calculated to strike terror into a bully, who would not object to punch a smaller boy's head in a corner; but the smaller boy of good courage was often enabled, through the special arrangements of the public contest, to turn the tables on his oppressor. Hence the use of seconds, to advise and encourage ; of half- minute time, to prevent the rush and momentary vigour of a big boy taking all chance away from the smaller. The anticipation of all these matters was likely to deter a bully from risking a public encounter, his object being, of course, to inflict pain without receiving any in return. It must be always borne in mind that blows from young boys — a foul blow was never thought of, and would, if there were any symptom of design, have immediately lost the fight — have the very remotest chance of proving dangerous to limb or life. The Seniors and Sixth Form very rarely fought. When the Seniors did it was in College, and as privately as possible. I remember no fight between Sixth Form boys, and but one between Seniors, during my stay at Westminster. The Green was undoubtedly a strange locality for such encounters ; the cloisters all round, and the peaceful Abbey looking down upon the scene of strife. During the in- stallation of Dean Turton, in 1842, a <c mill in the Green \" was in progress, and the shouts from the ring mingled with the swelling notes of the organ. Owen, the High Constable 30 Personal Reminiscences. of Westminster, came in robes of office, followed by some policemen, into the Green with a view to stop the proceedings outside the Abbey. He was, however, re- ceived with derisive shouts and the contents of certain pitchers, brought into the ring for the use of the com- batants, and eventually retired discomfited. Upon his retirement, the infamous joke was perpetrated by one of the victorious party that \" Owen was owing.\" In my senior year, the present Bishop of Lincoln, then a Prebendary of Westminster, came in full canonicals into the \" Green/' whilst we were in the midst of deadly strife, and made a strong appeal to us to desist on the ground of the sanctity of the spot. We listened in respectful silence, and sus- pended the fight whilst he was speaking; but we regarded him in the light of a trespasser upon our private ground, though, indeed, one whose age and position protected him from molestation — and the fight proceeded on his departure. However disgraceful some may consider this use of the cloistered enclosure, it was once, at least, tbe scene of much more ruffian-like proceedings than any which can accompany a fair and honourable combat between gentle- men. In Edward I/s time, during his absence in Scot- land, all his treasure, which then lay in the Chapel of the Pyx, was stolen — it is supposed by the connivance of some of the monks. It is on record that the (l Green \" had been sown for the occasion with hemp, so that the crop might conceal the tools needed to break through the walls of the king's treasure-house. A human skin, still to be felt beneath the cramps which bar the northern door to the Chapel of the Pyx, may perhaps attest the severity of the punishment of at least one of the offenders ; but it seems more probable that this skin belonged to some sacrilegious Dane or Danes, for Dugdale states that the abbot and many of the monks were sent to the Tower, and kept there for two years, on suspicion of being concerned in this burglary, which modern cracksmen would consider a very \"big job,\" as the treasure amounted to £100,000, The Princess Charlotte Witness of a \"Mill.\" 31 and we may multiply this by ten to bring it to its modern equivalent. Lord Albemarle, in \" Fifty Years of my Life,\" relates how the Princess Charlotte, who had driven down to West- minster to take him back with her to Warwick House, not finding: him at his boarding-house — Mother Grant's — went in search of him to the great cloisters, where he was forming one of the ring at a fight, and that Her Royal Highness was to be seen grasping the railings, and intently watching the combatants. The Earl adds that he con- siders the Princess to have been in \" high luck,\" for that \"she could not have witnessed a better fought battle than that between John Erskine, afterwards Earl of Mar, and Paddy Brown, Sir John Benyon de Beauvoir.\" The <( Green\" is supposed to have been, in old times, used as. a place of burial for the monks. 32 Personal Reminiscences.

ON the 1st of March, particulars of the celebration of which festival will be found in a succeeding chapter, the rowing season commenced, and, within a few days after, I was ordered on the water. The \" head of the water\" for the \" Town boys \" was the boy who had longest rowed in the first eight ; for the Queen's scholars, the Senior who had done so. At the time of which I am writing, the School possessed two eight-oared boats, one six-oared, and three \" heavy fours.\" Very heavy they were, as I soon had reason to know. The two eight-oars and the six- oar had their regular crews, selected from the Seniors and the higher forms in the school; the fonr-oars were manned in the following way. A few minutes before twelve o'clock in the morning, and also before five o'clock in the evening, three slips of paper were sent over from the \" heads of the water/' on which were written the names of the boys who were to compose the crew of each four-oar, and the destina- tion of each boat. This was, as a rule, the Red House, or else the Old Swan, above Battersea Bridge. In the morn- ing, generally the former; in the evening, generally the latter, because there was more time in the evening. When school broke up, we ran with all speed to the coal- lighters which, in larger or smaller numbers, always lay Sufferings of a Novice. 33 inocred close to the side of the New Parliament Houses, at that time in an incipient condition. Tripping along the outside ledges of these lighters — an exercise which, like tight-rope dancing, became easier after a little practice — and arriving at the outermost one, we found our boats in charge of a \" Jack \" from John Roberts, our boat-builder, who, with his brother, \" Fatty Roberts,\" had an establish- ment across the river, and whose ancestors had supplied Westminster boys with \"eights,\" \"sixes,\" \"heavy fours,\" \" light funnies,\" \" wager-boats,\" \" punch-bowls,\" and \" half-deckers,\" for more than a century. The crews of the \" eights \" were commonly conveyed across the river to Roberts's boat-house in order to embark, but the \" heavy fours \" were always towed across to the lighters, except at low tide, when the lighters were high and not dry in the mud. In that case, the \"heavy fours\" were brought to the Horse Ferry, opposite Lambeth Palace. Not a moment was lost. The boats were manned as soon as reached, and the crews pulled away up the river. It would be false to say that on this first occasion I pulled. I could with the greatest difficulty hold up my oar out of water, much less manage it when in. I performed, how- ever, some splashing in many styles, catching divers crabs, and occasionally sprawling at the bottom of the boat, held firmly down by my oar, till released by the boy in front. After many anathemas from the coxswain, and a good deal of personal suffering, I was landed at the Horse Ferry, where another boy who happened to be passing, not so utterly a novice in the art of rowing, was taken on board. The same James Goodenough before mentioned was the stroke of my boat on this day, and lie endeavoured, by personal instruction, to effect some improvement in my monstrous performances, but in vain. Some weeks elapsed before I learned to row decently. When I had overcome my first difficulties, the labour in the \"heavy fours\" was great, though, no doubt, to the use of these as training-boats, the excellence of the \"West- minster Eight\" was in a very great degree to be attributed. D 34 Personal Reminiscences. We had always to pull as hard as we possibly could the whole way, in order to reach our destination, and to be back in time for dinner or lockers, as we were very young and light, and the tide almost always strong either up the river or down — sometimes, near the bridges, like a mill-stream. Indeed, on one occasion, after rowing for some quarter of an hour underneath an arch of Yauxhall Bridge, without making any progress, we were obliged to turn round and go home. But a stern sense of duty on the part of the ' ( head of the water \" prevented the acceptance of our excuses, and we all suffered a caning. On arriving at the Red House, or Old Swan, it was our custom to land for about five minutes, and refresh ourselves with some porter or half-and-half — the usual beverages of the boys — and with a biscuit. It was fortunate for us if either of the eights came in whilst we were on shore, for it was a point of etiquette with these to pay for all refresh- ments partaken of by the ' ' fours.\" The Red House was a hostelry standing just where the bridge of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway, now crosses the Thames, close to Battersea Park. It was famous for pigeon-matches, and was, besides, used as a baiting-place for boats on their way up or down the river. Behind it extended a dreary waste in the directions of Wandsworth and Battersea, inter- sected with many broad and deep ditches, over which and into which every Westminster boy was annually bound to jump.* The Old Swan was an inn about 300 yards above Battersea Bridge, on the Putney side of the river, at that time kept by Mrs. Lintell. Beyond this the \" heavy fours \" very seldom went, but the eights often rowed to Putney on summer evenings, and longer distances on holidays, for which excursions special leave had to be asked. Now and again the \" head of the water\" would take the place of coxswain in a \"four,\" to see what progress was being made, and to give tyros hints on their style. On such occasions, to find oneself not amongst the crew was * s ee chapter on holidays. Challenge to Eton. 35 a subject of congratulation. Sometimes a tandem whip' sometimes a cane, sometimes a bugle-horn would form part of the new coxswain's equipment, and free use was made of the weapon — for the time the favourite — to enforce instruc- tions and directions. I am not sure that the horn — not ordinarily an instrument of punishment — could not be used in a more terrible manner than the other two; for, with a step or two across the seats, he who had been just blowing a lusty blast could bring the edge of his instrument into contact with one's arms or shins in a most cutting and effective manner. To vary the monotony of always rowing merely for rowing's sake, scratch matches were occasionally got up, and on these occasions we were allowed to use lighter boats. These races were sometimes pair-oar, and sometimes four-oar. The course either from Westminster Bridge to Battersea Bridge, or from Yauxhall Bridge to Battersea Bridge. The usual plan was to select the strokes of the contending crews by agreement, and then the other members of the crews had their names written on slips of paper, which were drawn from a cap by the strokes alternately. But all the rowing had one common aim, and that was to render the crew of our first Eight the most effective possible. After the Whitsuntide holidays, about the middle of June, the challenge was sent to Eton, if the Etonians had been suc- cessful in the previous year ; or by them to us, if the oppo- site had been the case. From that time till the race came off, the thoughts of every boy in the school were absorbed in the contemplation of the impending contest. We were very few — less than eighty in number — the Etonians, per- haps, nine times as many. Only by supreme efforts, and by superior science in the art of rowing, could there be any reasonable hope of victory. About six weeks before the day fixed for the contest, the Eight went into hard training. They rowed either in the morning or evening, sometimes both, taking with them Noulton, their trainer — a small, brisk man, with blue eyes, and a firm, good-natured face, who had in days gone by won celebrity as a sculler, and at the time of which I write, d 2 36 Personal Reminiscences, built racing boats. The Eight were steered usually by their own coxswain, who vacated his seat from time to time in favour of the trainer, and sometimes sat between his knees. I ought not to forget to mention Noulton's favourite and undeniably first-rate exhortation to the crew : \" Gentlemen, you must be determined. \" Whilst I was a Junior and Second Election, one of my own year steered the Eight, and I believe they could not have had a better coxswain, both as regards knowledge of the river, and the art of keeping his crew to their work at high pressure. Ample lung-power was requisite for this, and he had abundance. Torrents of alternate disapprobation and encouragement addressed to individual oarsmen sounded in the distance as if some desperate quarrel was proceeding on the river, or as if some spirit of the air was filling space with mingled objurgations and flatteries. Often before the Eight came in sight have I heard from the river-bank at the Red House the frenzied appeals of my friend Reginald Burton borne upwTards by the wind — \" Well rowed, bow; \" \"Now, then, number two;'' \"Now, then, all together;\" \"Pick her up;\" \"Well pulled, number seven;\" \"Take her along,\" &c, &c. After three weeks of training, a picked crew of water- men would go on the river to spurt against our Eight. I have on some of these occasions rowed bow in the water- men's Eight, when there has been a deficiency of profes- sionals; but it was anything but pleasant work. They rowed an exceedingly fast stroke, and to one accustomed to the long, steady, Westminster stroke, a spurt of a mile or so of \" forty to the minute \" meant \" bellows to mend,\" with a vengeance. I said that the Eight went into strict training. I should fancy that no training was ever stricter. The fruit season was at its height during the training period, but neither fruit nor dainties of any kind ever passed the lips of a member of the racing crew. They might see others lapping up bowls of delicious strawberries and cream, smacking their lips over cherry tart, sucking luscious peaches ; but Eve of the Race. 37 for the devoted Eight, chops and steaks, stale bread, a fixed quantity of bitter beer, weak tea in moderate draughts, were in the place of all gastronomic luxuries. No compe- titor for a prize in the Olympic games could have been more careful or more self-denying than were these eight youths. It must, indeed, have been hard, when the shop- windows were blocked with fruit, and the fragrant smell of plums, pears, apples, &c, pervaded the air, and their com- panions munched and munched before them, not even to taste; but I know, and there are many living who will bear witness to the truth of what I say, that not one thought, openly or surreptitiously, of breaking the rules of training, which in those days completely forbade the use of all fruits, pastry, and, indeed, everything which was not included in the very limited table of diet laid down by the trainer. The present system is, I am aware, considerably more indulgent. I remember a boy in my own year who was in the Eight telling me how, during this period of. training, he was pre- sent at a wedding breakfast, where, after he had refused all solicitations to partake of the dainties on table, his host at last ordered a steak to be broiled for his special benefit. To resist such temptations was, however, not a very hard matter for him whose firm principles of conduct were equal to far greater. He has long since gone to rest ; and it is no exaggeration to say that his death was accele- rated by his chivalrous devotion to his School. His excessive anxiety to do his devoir in the Eight had its natural result on a constitution not sufficiently robust to stand the severe training. Lung-disease terminated his pure and unselfish life soon after he had taken his degree at Oxford. I rever- ence the memory of Hervey Yaughan \"Williams whilst I write, as that of one whose aspirations and thoughts were, humanly speaking, entirely good and noble. And so the days wore on, until the eve of that day arrived which was to decide whether all this arduous work and self- denial was to have its due reward. On the 28th July, 1845, the Eight had gone on the river for their last trial pull — not a hard one, Evening lockers had commenced, and the 38 Personal Reminiscences, crew not long after went to their beds, full of hope and determination — I doubt whether their perfect condition allowed of anxiety — very soon to sleep the deep and healthy sleep they had so well earned. The rest of us — the un- trained ones — did not repose so quietly. Hopes and fears kept many of us awake for long, and, when we did sleep, dreams of the blue colours being first caused sundry strange cries to break the stillness of the old dormitory. The race to be described took place in my Second Election year, and is distinguished by the completeness of the victory, by the light weights of our crew as compared with those of their antagonists, by the strength of the individual oarsmen, and by the fine style in which they rowed, I may here mention that the boy who rowed stroke, William Gordon Eich, was the next year stroke oar of the Oxford University boat. \" Expectata dies aderat \" — a day such as schoolboys love — all sun and blue sky.* An Early Play was given on the occasion, and we were consequently free after breakfast. In the forenoon boys might be seen hurrying about for different purposes connected with the race ; some to fetch jerseys which had been left at Chappell, the draper's, to be trimmed with pink ; some to get rosettes elaborated as I have seen few since. Others were going \" up town \" to give their friends tickets for the steamer we had chartered to accompany the race. Others were busy across the water selecting light boats in which to display their skill and their colours on the river. How bright everything looked ! It would have been flat heresy for a Westminster boy on that morning to believe that the world was not generally much interested in the race, and indeed that its physical aspect was not favourably affected in consequence. And in some small sense this was true. For the dingy streets of West- minster looked all the better for the pink bunting displayed from the various shops and inns we frequented. To my fancy, as I went \" up town \" to leave with friends some tickets for the steamer, the people whom I passed had * An Early Play was a holiday with School before breakfast. |bb! r \\tqpk THE WESTMINSTER EIGHT WINNING THE RACE AGAINST ETON IN 1845. Face /. 39. The Race Day. 39 happier faces than one usually meets, and smiled to them- selves as much as to say : \" There is one of that famous school which will win the race this evening.\" The bells of St. Martin's Church were ringing merrily as I went by. For what else, if not to indicate how merry every one was and should be on the day of the Westminster and Eton boat-race ? So the forenoon with its anxious hours wore away, and the time to embark for Putney arrived. The race was to be rowed at 2.15, from Barker's rails to Putney Bridge, a course longer by a mile than that used by the Universities in their annual contest. On this occasion I rowed in a light four, the crew of which had been made up some weeks previously. We entered our boat at Roberts's boathouse, and proceeded up the river till we reached a spot a short distance above Hammersmith Bridge, where we waited to catch the first sight of the contending crews. Far up the reach our view extended for more than a mile. We knew by the time of day that the boats should have left the starting-post a quarter of an hour since. What minutes of throbbing anxiety, as we lay on our oars scanning the water for the first glimpse of them ! ~No sign of them yet ! Would they never come ? Could some accident have happened at the start ? We peered and peered into the distance with such intensity that at last we could not tell whether we saw real objects, or phantoms of the vision. Suddenly our stroke oar exclaimed with a gasping nervous cry, \" I see the pink oars in the sunlight,\" and tremblingly he pointed to where a pinkish mist seemed hovering over the water. A few more seconds and the pink oars were plainly visible, flashing in the light on the river. Then through the still, sultry air came that sound so familiar to frequenters of University boat-races, the huzzas of a distant multitude borne over the water. We began to row out into the river in order to keep some propinquity to the approaching rivals, and in less than five minutes the West- minster Eight was level with us. In solid form they were rowing, with the well-known 40 Personal Reminiscences. long, sweeping stroke. No splash ! No hurry ! Bold, indeed, would that critic have been who should have dared to utter a word in disparagement of the strength, style, or training of that extraordinary crew. Some half-dozen lengths behind came the Watermen's Eight, which should have kept with them to guide and encourage throughout the course. The veteran Noulton held the tiller ropes in the Watermen's boat, and, ashamed of his position astern, was calling out : \" Now, my dear boys, there is no need to row so hard.\" Immediately, as if by magic, we, who had just now seemed alone on the river, were surrounded by a mis- cellaneous fleet of boats. First came steamers staggering beneath their freight of living beings, who sent forth peal after peal of triumphant cheers : \" Well rowed, West- minster ! \" \" Westminster ! \" c< Rowed, indeed ! \" \" Bravo, Westminster ! \" with extraordinary prolongation of the last syllable, as though the shouteis feared they might possibly be inaudible, or might be thought incapable of spelling Westminster rightly. These and similar shouts resounded from the river and from both banks, on one of which a body of horsemen who had galloped along the towing-path were waving their hats and cheering. One of these, with his horse's feet through the bottom of a wager boat, while he seconded the efforts of his plunging steed to get free, still kept a look of interest on the victorious crew, and waved and waved, though at one moment his horse reared bolt upright on its hind legs, and the next was nearly successful in standing on its head. The enthusiasm was indeed tre- mendous. One youngster I saw on the paddle-box of a steamer who, having in a frantic manner flung his hat into the river, would certainly, the next instant, have followed himself, had he not been forcibly restrained by two gentle- men behind him. With the steamers, or immediately in their rear, the eights of the Leander, Thames, Thetis, Neptune, and other clubs came dashing along. Con- spicuous among them was the Westminster School second Eight, bearing the flag of t"
