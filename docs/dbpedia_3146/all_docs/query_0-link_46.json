The name probably comes from the celtic words Llyn, which means a lake, and Dun, which means a fort or a strong place. Although the site was not important during the Celtic period (400 BC ­ 43 AD) During the Roman occupation Londinium, as it was called then, was not influential politically, but was, however an important crossing point for the romans over the river Thames. Londinium was at a very good place, so it soon became a trading centre. In AD 61 the city was devastated by Boudicca, who led a revolt againt the Roman conquest of Britain. The city was burned down and its inhabitants massacred. London was rapidly rebuilt, becoming the capital of the province Britannia.

The Romans lead by Julius Caesar attempted to invade Britain twice before that in 55 and 54 BC but the invasions were unsuccessful. They made their way to the river Thames and sailed up it. The Romans knew it was important to control a crossing point at the river Thames, so they decided to build a settlement on the north bank. Although small settlements had been built on the banks of the Thames, the Romans were the ones who built the first city. They called their city Londinium. The Roman engineers noticed that the point where the swampy river narrowed would make an ideal crossing point, they built London Bridge. Less than 20 years later the native Iceni tribe, led by Queen Boudicca, rose up against the Romans in revenge for mistreatment and burnt Londinium to the ground.
