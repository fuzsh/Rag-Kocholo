        "text": "My daughter just graduated and had an amazing experience. She was introduced to so many new opportunities and people and discovered her passion for the arts here. Now she is off to a selective art program at college next year! The faculty are amazing and truly care about the students and their well-being. Westminster is smaller than its peer schools which makes for a much tighter-knit community.\n\nOur daughter just graduated from Westminster this spring. When she hosts tours on campus, she tells people that she found herself at Westy. We watched her transform into a confident and dedicated student who was very involved in her community. The faculty is amazing, there is strong administrative support, and the health center is easy to work with. The teachers truly care about their student's success and well-being. They take time to meet with students if they have questions. Our son will be a freshman next year, and we can't wait to see his social and academic progress over the next four years.\n\nMy son just finished his Fourth Form (sophomore) year at Westminster as a day student and we couldn't be happier with his experience so far. He is a very strong student and, in applying to Westminster, we wanted him to be challenged which he is, in a very supportive environment. The after-school activities (clubs, sports, etc.) are excellent and, as a family, we feel very connected to Westy. This is an incredible school that I encourage you to check out if you are looking for a school for your own child.\n\nWestminster is a gem of a school for students & families who prioritize community, development of the \"whole\" individual, organic and authentic relationships, and the willingness to grow beyond stereotypical notions of \"success\" and \"privilege\". Westminster values relationships & the health of the student first and foremost. Westminster is intentional & thoughtful in the support structures it sets up for each student: teachers, advisors, administrators & student leaders available to guide each student and send the clear message: \"Westminster will NOT give up on you!\" Our children are very different in terms of academic interests & extracurricular pursuits, but at Westy, the both found what they needed to grow into amazing young adults with solid moral compasses. Their college choices reflected their Westy experience and they are now thriving in the world of higher ed. The tireless work of the Westminster \"team\" has been a true gift to our family. Definitely consider Westminster School!\n\nFour years of complete garbage, waste of my parents money. As if COVID freshman year wasn't bad enough, the years after that got progressively worse. School culture fell off big time this year, half the teachers are new and no one knows whats going on. Bunch of kids got kicked out early on this year for things I can't write here, you get the idea. Look elsewhere, I should have transferred when I had the chance.\n\nAs an alum of Westminster, I was open to the possibility of sending our 2 children to the school. First, we were interested to learn more about how the schools' curriculum, faculty and extracurricular activities have evolved over the years to keep pace with the ever-changing world. I was invited up to the school to engage in an in-depth multi-day look into the inner workings of the school and its future goals (under new leadership in Elaine White). I was pleased with its direction and strides it has made to ensure all children have a positive experience at the school. Of course, there is always more work that can be done to keep pace with the diversity of the student population (and its families), but I believe they are on the right path! I'm proud of my alma Mata.\n\nSending my son to Westminster School was the Best decision we have ever made. The school provided him an incredibly enriching environment. He greatly benefitted from the support he received while at Westminster. The faculty, staff, coaches, and peers were a very positive influence and the Campus is beautiful.\n\nOn the surface, it is easy to see Westminster School is rich in history and tradition. However, I was pleasantly surprised to realize the school does not prescribe to expired ideals and academic malaise. The school is fluid and dynamic. It's rich history never seems to define its future.\n\nFinally, Westminster School has a very strong Alumni support network. Alumni are an integral part of the Westminster School experience. Alumni care deeply for the school and for the students; as evidenced in the multitude of extraordinary residential buildings, academic centers, athletic complexes, etc. donated by a devoted Alumni Network. Our son is now an Alum. He couldn't be happier.\n\nAs an Alum of Westminster, I had never planned on sending my kids there. I had a great experience myself, but it was never on my radar. Now, as I am writing this review, I am getting my third child ready to attend Westminster this Fall. All three of my children will be Westminster graduates and I am thankful for that. The school is small, thoughtful, and academically challenging. The teachers are personal and caring, the facilities are clean and modern, the setting is beautiful, and the people are kind and inclusive. I'm so happy to see that after all of these years, the school still upholds so many of its traditions and values. I considered other schools for my kids, but as we looked, no other school had the full package that Westminster offers. My kids are being taken care of by teachers who truly care about them and this nurturing environment gives them the chance to excel.\n\nAll three of our children attended Westminster and had wonderful experiences. The faculty is incredibly committed to teaching kids both in and out of the classroom. Because of the size of the school, students and faculty interact constantly, developing relationships that last beyond the students' time on campus. Family style lunches, weekly all-school gatherings, and small class sizes are just some of the features that create a strong sense of community.\n\nWhat an incredible place for teenage students to prepare for life and for college. A beautiful campus and dedicated faculty. My daughter joined Westminster in the 10th grade and was welcomed immediately into the friendly community. The confidence she has gained in just one year is remarkable. The friendships she has made are equally remarkable. As she say's, everyone there is just \"nice\".\n\nThis is clearly a school figuring out who it is.\n\nI was very disappointed by my son's experience at Westminster. His teachers, advisors, and coaches were outstanding people who seemed entirely overworked.\n\nExpectations continuously misaligned with reality. My son's freshman year dorm was atrocious. Again, the faculty/dorm parents were excellent. The facilities were not what we had been shown on the tour. The school is pursuing a \"woke\" curriculum with their DEI program and my son has been asked to be a part of discussions about \"belonging\" when he feels just the opposite.\n\nSome good things: dining/food and athletic facilities are top notch. Campus is beautiful. Faculty, despite having a ton on their plate, are friendly and helpful. Administrators are typically responsive, though I am glad my son is graduating because it seems like the person in charge of student life and housing is making changes that negatively impact the student experience.\n\nI truly enjoyed my experience at Westminster and I couldn't imagine going anywhere else because of the people. The community of teachers, faculty, and students made all the difference and had an amazing impact on who I've become today. The teachers really cared and wanted you to succeed which played a key role in gaining the confidence needed to grow. One thing I would change is the amount of freedom that is given to students especially as we get older. I understand the structure needed as a freshman, but once we get to being seniors students should gain more independence so they can learn what college will be like and see how they'll perform."
