        "text": "The story of writings on earthquakes in Britain starts, perhaps surprisingly, in Iona (Fig. 1). This small island off the west of Scotland is today only reachable by two ferry crossings; a car ferry to Mull and a passenger-only ferry to Iona itself. But as Professor William Kirk, an inspirational figure to Irish geographers, used to remind undergraduates, ideas of centrality depend on where you put the spokes. Ireland and the west of Scotland may seem today like the extreme periphery of Europe, but there was a period when they were the intellectual hub of Europe, a centre of learning, and the base from which Christian missionaries were dispatched to turn back the tide of paganism across the continent (see, for instance, MacCulloch 2010).\n\n2.1 Irish annals\n\nThe earliest written mention of earthquakes in the British Isles are notes of their occurrence in monastic annals, and the earliest of these refer to earthquakes in Ireland. These are mentioned in Irish annals, but the relationship between the early chronicles is complex and difficult to untangle. Early chroniclers copied from each other, sometimes badly, and some of the chronicles in the chain of transmission are now lost. Understanding the relationship between them therefore requires a good deal of detective work (Dumville 1984).\n\nAll the extant Irish annals are believed to be continuations of the same original chronicle, which was compiled in Iona some time in the 6th century by St Columba, based on an earlier annalistic world history written by Rufinus of Aquileia at the beginning of the 5th century (McCarthy 2008). This chronicle continued to be added to by successive abbots of Iona until around 740, when the text was brought to Ireland and formed the basis of the various Irish chronicles.\n\nThe earliest contender for the title of “first recorded British earthquake” is an entry in the Annals of Ulster (Balé and Purcell 2003 is the most recent edition) for 601—“An earthquake in Bairche.” Bairche (or Ui Bairrche) was a kingdom in the south-east of what is now County Laois. There is a general problem with all events of this type, that the word used for earthquake, “terra motus”, was also used for landslides, landslips, rockfalls, bog-bursts and other similar phenomena. The fact that Ireland is so aseismic makes one particularly inclined to suspect that something other than a real earthquake may be being described. Principia (1982), using a Victorian edition of the Annals of Ulster, give the location as Mourne (County Down) and the year as 600.\n\nClaims for an Irish earthquake in 448 (e.g. Cusack 1868) rest on a misinterpretation of a note in the Annals of Ulster referring to an earthquake in Constantinople.\n\nFurther events are noted in 664, 680, 684, December 707 (two events), October 721, and 8 February 730. It is uncertain whether any of these are genuine earthquakes, and the 680 event is probably a misdated reference to the 684 event, which occurred in the Isle of Man and may have been a rockfall. The fact that the 707 reference mentions two events suggests the possibility of a real earthquake and an aftershock, but could equally well be two landslides in a week of heavy winter rainfall. Finally, we have notice of an earthquake on 12 April 740 on Islay, and there the record stops. It is rather interesting that the last of these pre-millennial events from the Irish annals coincides with the approximate date at which the chronicle ceased to be kept in Iona.\n\n2.2 Later British chronicles\n\nThe earliest earthquake report that can be reliably considered a real earthquake (because it is reported as felt over an area) comes in 974. It was described by the source, the chronicle commonly attributed to Florence of Worcester (Stevenson 1853–1856), as affecting all England. A main source for the chronicle for most of this period is the chronicle compiled at Fulda, Germany, by the Irish monk Marianus Scotus. The complete entry for 974 in the Worcester chronicle reads:\n\nThis year there was a violent earthquake through the whole of England. Eberger, archbishop of Cologne, gave the abbey of St. Martin at Cologne to the Scots for ever. Minborin, a Scot, was the first abbot.\n\nThe second part of the entry is exactly as appears in Marianus Scotus (Scotus 1559), but not the first part, which appears to have been inserted by the chronicler from some other source; none of the extant versions of the Anglo-Saxon chronicle mention the event. If the chronicle draws on a German source like Scotus, it cannot be taken for granted that the interpolations are local to Worcester. The epicentre could have been anywhere in England.\n\nAccording to Goutoulas (1653) this earthquake threw down houses and killed people; whether Goutoulas was citing a source now lost or made this detail up one cannot tell.\n\nReports of earthquakes continue in British monastic chronicles throughout the Middle Ages, with a marked decline after the thirteenth century. The record of seismicity in Britain in the fifteenth century is almost a complete blank. A complete account of the earthquakes of the period up to 1600 is given in Musson (2008).\n\nIt should be a principle of historical research not to read into any source document more than it can reliably bear. In particular, any source has to be taken together with its context. Reading a document in the light of the original author’s intentions in compiling it, and not according to what the modern reader would like it to mean, is fundamental to correct procedures in historical research. While it would be nice to think of medieval monasteries as akin to a recording network for British earthquakes, this analogy cannot be sustained.\n\nThe reasons why this comparison is unreliable have been gone into by Musson (1998, 2004). Monastic chroniclers recorded things that they felt were of note, and what these things were, and why they were of note, varied. In the case of “prodigies” (remarkable occurrences) such as earthquakes, the importance of these to the medieval mind was that they were portents, either of God’s wrath or coming political events. They were not seen as purely natural occurrences.\n\nThe corollary to this is that if an earthquake is memorable because it may be a portent, it is not all that important exactly where it occurs, or how severe it is. The important thing is the date of its occurrence, and this is probably one reason why many chronicles record the occurrence of earthquakes with absolutely no details beyond the date, while the date is recorded carefully, using more than one dating system to make sure the reader is in no doubt.\n\nConsequently, if the chronicle of a particular abbey mentions any earthquake, this does not necessarily mean the earthquake was felt at that abbey, unless this is specifically stated or there is other internal evidence to suggest this.\n\nOn the other hand, the absence of mention of an earthquake in a chronicle is not necessarily evidence that the earthquake was not felt at that place. It may indicate that the writer himself did not feel the earthquake (for a variety of possible reasons) or that he did not consider it worth recording.\n\nOne can make comparisons with the reporting by medieval chroniclers of severe storms, which are more frequent, more damaging, and more widely observed in Britain than are earthquakes (Musson 2004). The lack of such reports on a regular basis shows the general lack of interest shown in such phenomena by monastic annalists.\n\n2.3 Alexander Neckham\n\nFor the earliest British writing on earthquakes as a phenomenon, outside of mentions in chronicles, one turns to Alexander Neckham. Details of his life are fragmentary, but it is known that he was born in St Albans in September 1157 (Wright 1863). Educated first at St Albans, he moved to the University of Paris, where he achieved the post of professor some time around 1180, while he was still in his twenties. He returned to England around 6 years later, and became a monk in the Augustinian abbey at Cirencester, and was subsequently elected abbot in 1213. He died 4 years later, in 1217, at Kempsey, near Worcester, and is said to be buried in Worcester Cathedral (Wright 1863).\n\nNeckham today is best known for his De Naturis Rerum (Of the Nature of Things), an account of scientific knowledge as it existed in England towards the end of the twelfth century. The exact date of composition is unknown, but indirect evidence suggests that it was a well-known text around the time of the accession of King John to the English throne in 1199.\n\nNeckham was not a particularly original thinker, and where he does venture ideas of his own, they are often wrong. He is interesting today for preserving what passed as received knowledge at the period at which he lived, drawing largely on Solinus (early third century), Cassiodorus (sixth century), and ancient authors such as Pliny and Aristotle. To these he adds a number of observations and stories of his own, including what seems to be the first known reference to the “man in the moon”.\n\nChapter 48 of De Naturis Rerum is dedicated to the subject of earthquakes. It reads in full:\n\nTerra infimum est elementorum, et quasi mundi centrum. Unde cum ponderibus sit librata suis, mirum est unde motus terrae proveniat. Perhibent quod sub- terraneos meatus et cavernas venti violentia subintrat, qui cum libertatem non habeat exeundi, furit in se et multiplicatur. Erigitur igitur terrae superficies et movetur. Sciendum est enim impossibile esse totalem. De sancta terram moveri localiter. Per terram designatur sancta ecclesia, eo quod laboribus et pressuris teritur, vel a stabilitate sic dicitur. Licet igitur in multis tribulationes sustineat ecclesia, tamen semper aliqui in ecclesia tranquillitate gaudent. Tunditur Tyrus fluctibus, sed non submergitur. Volvitur Arcturus, sed non occidit. Sicut autem ventus interceptus et inclusus in cavernis terrae civitates dejicit, ita indignatio superba, diu in corde regnans, virtutum arcem prosternit. (Wright 1863)\n\nThis can be loosely translated as follows:\n\nThe land is the lowest of the elements, and the centre of the world. Hence, since the weight is self-balanced, it is strange that earthquakes should occur. It is said that violent winds enter underground channels and caverns, which become trapped, and rage, and are redoubled in force. Then the surface of the earth is lifted up and moved. It should be noted, that it is impossible for this to be total and all lands to be moved. Land dedicated to the Holy Church by labour and afflictions is called stable. Therefore, although many are the afflictions sustained by the church, there is always some tranquillity to be enjoyed. Tyre was pounded by waves, but not drowned. Arcturus revolved, but was not killed. But as the winds caught and shut up in the caves of the earth throw down cities, so too will anger against the proud, so long found in the hearts of rulers, cast them down like a castle.\n\nThe very limited scientific content in this is drawn from Aristotle: earthquakes are caused by the action of subterranean winds, trapped in a system of caves and passageways, and eventually violently escaping. For a commentary on Aristotle’s theory of earthquakes and its transmission, see Oeser (1992). Here the point of interest is that Neckham is the first British expression of Aristotelian orthodoxy as regards earthquakes.\n\nLater in life, Neckham produced a verse paraphrase of De Naturis Rerum, entitled De Laudibus Divinæ Sapientiæ (Of the Praises of Divine Wisdom). Much of the subject material in this poem is the same, with some additions, but the various folksy anecdotes are omitted. Earthquakes make an appearance in Book Five, and the ideas are much the same, though differently expressed. Both works are printed in Wright (1863).\n\nWhile Neckham might be the first person in Britain to write about earthquakes in what might be called loosely a “scientific” context, he evidently had no particular interest in the subject. The inclusion of a chapter on the subject reflects rather that Neckham’s work is something akin to an encyclopaedia, covering all topics. Indeed, up to perhaps the early nineteenth century, it was expected that a learned person should be learned about everything; it was not beyond expectation that an author could write an account of all knowledge of the world single-handedly. The last person to attempt this was Alexander Humboldt; after Humboldt the increase in human knowledge became too much for one man to master, until we reach the situation today, when normally a professional scientist will have full knowledge only of a narrow division within a discipline.\n\nSimilarly, it is worth pointing out that “scientist” is a relatively recent concept. Neckham would have regarded himself as a philosopher. Philosophy was the pursuit of knowledge, one branch of which was “natural philosophy”, knowledge of the physical universe. This term, which we would now read as “science”, continued to be used into the nineteenth century.\n\nThat said, the most famous figure in the history of medieval science in Britain, Roger Bacon (c. 1214–1294), was more of a specialist, being particularly interested in optics, astronomy, alchemy and mathematics. His works contain no mention of earthquakes.\n\n2.4 The earthquake of 6 April 1580 and its aftermath\n\nTo a large extent, developments in the study of earthquakes in Britain have been driven by events. Notable earthquakes, and not just those affecting Britain, have often been the spur for particular individuals to take an interest in the subject, and produce written works—which were more easily distributed in the age of the printing press.\n\nThe first of these “inspirational” earthquakes was that of 6 April 1580, one of the larger British earthquakes, with an epicentre in the Dover Straits and a magnitude probably around 5.5 Mw, although higher values have been suggested (Roger et al. 2011).\n\nDespite the numerous accounts preserved, there are still some difficulties in assessing intensities for this event. As is so often the case, accounts speak more about damage to special buildings—churches and castles—than to ordinary houses. To take examples only from Kent, the tower of the church of St Peter’s, Broadstairs was cracked from top to bottom (Hasted 1800), St Peter’s and St Mary’s churches in Sandwich were both cracked (Boys 1792), and the church of St Peter and St Paul, Sutton (near Dover) was partly thrown down (Hasted 1800). Damage to ordinary houses is mentioned at none of these locations, but one suspects that this is more due to a sense that what happened to plebeian housing was not worth recording, than to an actual absence of damage. Significant damage to churches in British earthquakes is unusual, and comparable effects are only to be found amongst a few later events. In the case of the 1884 Colchester earthquake, damage to churches occurred in an area over which the intensity was 7 or 8 EMS (European Macroseismic Scale). Thus the maximum intensity in England in 1580 should have been in this range.\n\nWriters who do mention damage to houses are Fleming (1580), Churchyard (1580) and Wood (1796). Fleming (1580) reports householders in London complaining that \\(\\pounds \\)20, \\(\\pounds \\)30, not even \\(\\pounds \\)100 would be enough to meet the cost of repairs. Churchyard (1580) is more precise in describing the fall of chimneys and small pieces of stone and mortar from the tops of houses in London (particularly Shoreditch). Wood (1796), following an entry in the Annals of Merton College (Fletcher 1976) speaks of great damage to both the foundations and roofs of houses and churches in Kent.\n\nThis earthquake was also the first occasion in Britain on which we have specific information on earthquake fatalities (Musson 2003). Two child apprentices, Thomas Gray and Mabel Everite were struck by stones falling from the roof of Christ’s Church, Newgate, in London. The boy was killed outright; the girl died of her injuries a few days later.\n\nOn the continent, the strongest effects are reported from Calais, where several houses are reported to have been thrown down; the town walls were damaged and part of the watch-tower collapsed (Bourquelot 1857; Bernard 1715; Bellart and Vion 1991). At Boulogne, damage was done to the church of Notre-Dame, and in houses even heavy furniture was displaced (d’Hauttefeuille and Bernard 1860; Bellart and Vion 1991).\n\nThe effects in London gave rise to such alarm that many printed pamphlets were rushed out, containing a mixture of journalism, doggerel, theology, and scientific discussion. Since all printed works had to be registered at the Stationer’s Company, we know exactly what was published, even where no copies still survive. The first of these pamphlets, “A godly newe ballat moving us to repent by ye example of ye earthquake happened in London ye 6. of Aprill 1580” was issued the very next day after the earthquake, price fourpence (Arber 1875). The author is unknown, and no copy has survived, but Collier (1849) cites a MS ballad which he suggests is this one. Pamphlets of this sort were the journalism of the day.\n\nFour of these pamphlets have survived: Churchyard (1580), Fleming (1580), Golding (1580) and Twyne (1580). Hitherto these have been examined for details of the effects of the earthquake (e.g. Neilson et al. 1984a) or for their social context (e.g. Walsham 1999), but here I want to consider what they tell about the state of knowledge on earthquakes in general.\n\n2.4.1 Churchyard\n\nThomas Churchyard (c. 1520–1604), soldier and author, was quick off the mark, and his pamphlet was rushed out on 8 April, two days after the earthquake. Its full title reads “A Warning to the Wyse, a Feare to the Fond, a Bridle to the Lewde, and a Glasse to the Good; written of the late Earthquake chanced in London and other places, the 6th of April, 1580, for the Glory of God and benefit of men, that warely can walk, and wisely judge. Set forth in verse and prose, by Thomas Churchyard, gentleman”. Churchyard makes it very clear what he thinks about earthquakes as natural phenomena:\n\nBut perhaps some fine headed fellowes will wrest (by naturall argumentes) Gods doing and works, to a worldly or earthly operation, proceeding from a hidden cause in the body and bowels of ye earth ... Let such fine wittes search out secretes, and sift what they can from the bottome of their senses. Yet those that feare God ... will take the Earthquake to be of another kind of Nature: And beholding the myraculous manner of the same ... will embrace Gods visitation ... (Churchyard 1580)\n\nSo much for science; earthquakes are supernatural visitations from God, so far as Churchyard is concerned, and that is an end of it. Though, as Walsham (1999) makes clear, it was possible at this period (and earlier) to operate a sort of double-think, whereby, for instance, an eclipse could be seen as a divinely-sent portent of things to come, even though it was known that an eclipse had a natural cause.\n\nA further point of interest regarding Churchyard is that, alone of any of the pamphlet authors of 1580, he makes a second appearance in the annals of British earthquakes. After the southern North Sea earthquake of 1602, he brought out another pamphlet, formerly thought to be lost. However, a single copy was found to survive in the Lambeth Palace Library. Sadly, this publication contains no information whatever about the earthquake beyond the reference to it in the title (Churchyard 1602).\n\n2.4.2 Fleming\n\nAbraham Fleming (c1550–1607) is rather more interesting. He graduated from Cambridge in 1582, after having interspersed his studies with frequent trips to London (Venn and Venn 1922). He was a prolific author with wide interests, especially translation from the Classics. Later he took orders as a Calvinist minister.\n\nFleming’s (1580) tract is a rather more substantial treatise, the full title of which reads “A Bright Burning Beacon, forewarning all wise Virgins to trim their lampes against the comming of the Bridegroome. Conteining A generall doctrine of sundrie signs and wonders, specially Earthquakes both particular and generall: A discourse of the end of this world: A commemoration of our late Earthquake, the 6. of April, about 6. of the clocke in the evening 1580. And a praier for the appeasing of Gods wrath and indignation”\n\nThe emphasis of this work is religious in nature, and most of it is a translation of Book VII of Friedrich Nausea’s (1532) Libri mirabilium septem with Fleming’s interpolations. On the causes of earthquakes, he cites the traditional Aristotelian view, transmitted via Pliny, as given by Nausea:\n\nI think in like manner, that the earth is made to quake by the violence of winds shut up & kept close in the hollowe places of the same, which windes by their stirring doe stirre the earth, & so make an Earthquake ... Now these winds thus shut up, seeking a vent here & there to breake out, and trieng by all meanes they can make to have passage, that breaking out of prison (as it were) they might be set at libertie, and blowe at large, whiles this is intended, the earth trembleth, rocketh, & reeleth as though it would fall ...\n\nBut there is an alternative hypothesis:\n\nHereupon say some, that trembling in the earth, is nothing else but that which thunder is in a cloude: and the gaping of the ground none other thing, than when as lightning bursteth forth with violence ...\n\nAfter translating these scientific speculations from Nausea, Fleming interpolates some text of his own, more or less agreeing with Churchyard:\n\nNotwithstanding these reasons carrie with them a countenance & shew of credite, and therefore may the lesse be gainsaid: yet least by seeking to become wise in the secret workes of God, and referring that to the course of naturall causes, which come to passe by the providence of his judgement, we fall into securitie, from securitie into incredulitie, from incredulitie into atheisme, from atheisme into open blasphemie: my counsell and advice is, that our eares tickle not to heare every vaine Philosophers fancie decanting upon matters of great importance, and thereby pull from God the cause of his justly conceived indignation against the wickedness of the world ...\n\nFrom Nausea, Fleming repeats some of the characteristics of earthquakes as gleaned from historical accounts. He states, for instance, that earthquakes are most common in places near the sea, and also in hilly districts. Also that they are more common in spring and autumn. He states that earthquakes happen more often by night than by day. A reader would also learn of the different effects of earthquakes (ultimately from Seneca):\n\nIt is not unknowne to the learned, that in the kind of moving and shaking there is a great difference: for the earth may quake many waies. Now it is a dangerous and fearfull Earthquake, when as the earth is rowled to and fro like a wave of the Sea ... Contrariwise it is not so perilous, when with quaking, the frames of houses and buildings cracke with shrinking ... as also, when houses meeting together, ratle & knocke one against another, by reason of interchangeable moving, the one resisting and withstanding the other.\n\nFleming now chips in a contribution of his own. Considering the accounts of what happened in England, he concludes that the 1580 earthquake was of the less dangerous kind of shaking.\n\nHowever, Fleming’s Chapter 12 is entitled “A contemplation of wonderfull accidents, and principally of Earthquaks, as well particular as generall, which have happened in the realms of England, Ireland, & Scotland, from the time of K. William the Conquerour, to the reigne of our sovereigne Lady and gratious Queene Elizabeth, &c.” This is Fleming’s original work, and forms the first known catalogue of British earthquakes (Musson 2004). The catalogue is presented in the form of free text, moving from one event to another, rather than as any sort of table. Because of the interest of this very early catalogue, it may be as well to list the events in full. The earthquakes mentioned are as follows:\n\n“Reign of Eugenius”—London\n\nMarch 1077—all England\n\n1084—unspecified\n\n1165—Ely, Norfolk, Suffolk\n\n1179—Oxenhall, near Darlington\n\nMonday the week before Easter 1185—all England; damage at Lincoln\n\nJanuary-February 1199—Scotland\n\n1222—Warwickshire\n\n1247—London\n\n1248—Bath and Wells\n\n1250—St Albans\n\n1266—Ireland\n\n1274—various places in England\n\n1275—all England, damage at Glastonbury\n\n1382—two earthquakes in various places, especially Kent\n\n1563—Lincoln and Northampton\n\n6 April 1580—London\n\nOf these, the first is probably mythical, and the 1179 event is not an earthquake. No sources are given, but it is clear that the entries are mostly derived from medieval chronicles, directly or indirectly. It is noteworthy that there is only one event between 1382 and 1580, when one might expect the author to be better informed about his own time than about the thirteenth century. Fleming’s failure to mention a large English earthquake in 1575, only five years previously, is particularly surprising. His principal source would seem to be the general historical work of Holinshed (1577), hardly surprising when one finds Fleming listed as a contributor to the second edition of Holinshed et al. (1587). Holinshed is also more or less the only source (albeit secondary) known for the Scottish earthquakes of 1202, which Fleming misdates, and is the most accessible source for the Irish earthquake of 1266 (which is confirmed by the annals of Clyn and Dowling; Butler 2003).\n\n2.4.3 Twyne\n\nGolding (1580) we can pass over as another moraliser; of the various lost pamphlets, so far as can be judged from surviving details, these were either moralising tracts, or ballads. Far and away the most interesting of the 1580 writers is Thomas Twyne. His pamphlet (Twyne 1580) appeared a week after the earthquake, and was entitled “A shorte and pithie Discourse, concerning the engendring, tokens, and effects of all Earthquakes in Generall: Particularly applied and conferred with that most strange and terrible worke of the Lord in shaking the Earth, not only within the Citie of London, but also in most partes of all Englande: Which hapned upon Wednesday in Easter weeke last past, which was the sixr day of April, almost at sixe a clocke in the evening, in the yeare of our Lord GOD. 1580.”\n\nOf the various pamphleteers, Twyne was the one with the nearest to a scientific background. Having obtained a fellowship at Oxford in 1564, he moved to Cambridge to study medicine, eventually becoming a successful physician (Ockenden 1936). Twyne, in contrast to his contemporaries, sets out at once in his title that his main objective is to consider the effects and causes of earthquakes in general, rather than to call the wicked to repentance.\n\nNevertheless, Twyne is completely orthodox in his views:\n\n... I must be fayne to borrowe from the Prophane wryters, who have most dilligently laboured in the search of naturall causes, whereunto they could not so clearly have atteyned without the finger of God, which hath led men as well into the true contemplation of these matters, as of any other knowledge. And therefore following Aristotle as cheefe in this behalfe ...\n\nHere is a succinct statement of the medieval view: Aristotle, backed by the Church, is a definitive guide, with the authority of Christian doctrine. Thus we have the usual explanation that earthquakes are due to subterraneous winds or vapours. For this reason, he believes, earthquakes are more likely in places with caverns or mines, such as Mendip (Somerset) or Newcastle—two places not actually associated with seismic activity. Also suitable are “hollow cliffes by the Sea side” such as Dover and Folkestone, and this is rather more reasonable, given the location of 1580 earthquake. As does Fleming, he mentions Aristotle’s association of earthquakes with hilly districts, “so that (perhapps) the uplandishe people of Wales are better acquainted with such effectes than we are, as it standeth with good reason, and I have heard also some to report by tryall and knowledge.”\n\nTwyne continues with a description of the noise that may accompany an earthquake, followed by a discussion of “earthquake weather”, which includes a description of earthquake clouds (“a long narrowe clowde stretched foorth, which is the forerunner of an Earthquake”) a phenomenon which was apparently observed by some people before the 6 April 1580 event. There are still those today who support the idea of cloud precursors as a real phenomenon.\n\nTwyne’s attitude to earthquakes, and also astronomical events such as comets, is dualistic. The sun, planets and stars (i.e. natural forces) provide the efficient cause of such phenomena, through which God works. Earthquakes are no miracles, and proceed from natural causes, but nevertheless are ultimately subject to Divine will. Thus he gives thanks to God that the shaking lasted only a minute, whereas an earthquake that struck Constantinople once lasted a whole year (such reports refer to long aftershock sequences, which were often not realised to be a succession of separate events).\n\nTwyne shows an enquiring mind, and he attempts to check if earthquake effects he has read about, occurred in the 1580 earthquake. Thus he finds and reports that the waters of the Thames were disturbed (seiche), but there were no great marine inundations. Nor was water in wells or springs rendered turbid.\n\nHe even tries to time the arrival of the earthquake at different places, supposing that it started in eastern Kent, reached Rochester at 17 h, London at almost 18 h, Windsor around 18 h 30 m, and then bent round from a westerly progression to a northerly one. Of course, in the absence of standard time, such figures are meaningless, but to even attempt the measurement is extremely advanced for the period. Twyne provides the first instance in Britain of what might be considered a scientific investigation of an earthquake.\n\n2.4.4 Shakespeare\n\nIf William Shakespeare is mentioned in a seismological context, it is usually with regard to a line in Romeo and Juliet, Act I Scene 3, where the Nurse remarks:\n\n’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\n\nAnd she was wean’d (I never shall forget it),\n\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day;\n\nThis has often been taken as a reference to the 1580 earthquake, which one may suppose Shakespeare felt, and as evidence that the play was written in 1591 (a credible date, from other evidence). Certainly, it is likely that Londoners of the time used the date of the earthquake as a reference in this way, and it is not to be supposed that “the earthquake” was intended to refer to an Italian earthquake, just because the play is nominally set in Italy.\n\nHowever, far more interesting from a seismological perspective is Henry IV Part One. In Act III Scene 1, Owen Glendower (Owain Glyndŵr) is boasting of his wizardly powers, and that his birth was marked by supernatural portents, including an earthquake. Hotspur is not impressed, and replies:\n\nDiseased nature oftentimes breaks forth\n\nIn strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth\n\nIs with a kind of colic pinch’d and vex’d\n\nBy the imprisoning of unruly wind\n\nWithin her womb, which, for enlargement striving,\n\nShakes the old beldame earth and topples down\n\nSteeples and mossgrown towers. At your birth\n\nOur grandam earth, having this distemp’rature,\n\nIn passion shook.\n\nThis is a nice summary of the Aristotelian theory of earthquakes. In this scene, Owen Glendower is being held up to ridicule, and the audience are expected to side with Hotspur. So the message is that earthquakes are a natural phenomenon, and not supernatural portents. Lomnitz (1995) suggests that the reference to intestinal gases was included for comic relief, and therefore indicates that Shakespeare was doubtful about Aristotle’s theory. But the comparison with intestinal gas is already there in Aristotle, and it is only Glendower that is being ridiculed here, not Aristotle.\n\nIt would be interesting to know where Shakespeare got his knowledge from. Did he read any of the pamphlets by Twyne or his contemporaries? (This play was written about 1597, some time after the earthquake of 1580.) What is shown here is that Aristotle’s explanation of earthquakes counted as general knowledge at the end of the sixteenth century.\n\nIn Britain, the seventeenth century was a period of revolution—quite literally, with the overthrow and regicide of Charles I, followed eventually by the restoration of his son, Charles II, in 1660. But it was also a period of scientific revolution in Europe. As we saw with Thomas Twyne, as late as 1580, Aristotle was still seen as an unimpeachable authority whose views were not to be questioned. Earthquakes were due to the violent escape of subterranean winds. Aristotle, Seneca and Pliny all said so, and doubtless God had guided their writings for the benefit of subsequent generations.\n\nThis was about to change.\n\nThe only way that the stranglehold of Aristotelian orthodoxy could be broken was for Aristotle to be found majorly wrong on something, in which case it would open up the rest of his work to dispute. That breakthrough was achieved by Galileo in his work on astronomy in the early seventeenth century. Once it was proved and accepted that the old Aristotelian cosmogony of the sun and stars revolving round the Earth was wrong, then the whole Aristotelian edifice was up for grabs, and it became possible to question other parts of it without running the risk of being tried by the Inquisition.\n\nThe word “Renaissance” here is appropriate. There are times in history, and the late nineteenth century was one of them, when it seemed that scientific knowledge was almost complete, and little remained to be discovered—only for this certainty to be shattered by a realisation of how much remains unknown. The seventeenth century “rebirth” saw everything that had been taken for granted as known, through the writings of Aristotle, Seneca and Pliny, suddenly revealed as unknown and uncertain. Everything needed to be reinvestigated.\n\nThe response to this need was the founding of scientific societies where like-minded scholars could meet and exchange ideas and findings, usually under a noble or royal patron. The earliest of these was in Italy, appropriately enough—the Accademia dei Lincei, founded in Rome as early as 1603, and which included Galileo himself as a member.\n\nFurther societies followed; although in Italy the “Academy of Lynxes” folded after the death of its patron, informal societies gathered in England and France in the first half of the century, which evolved into very eminent bodies in the 1660s: the Royal Society in London in 1660, and the Académie des Sciences in Paris in 1666. The first German learned society, the Collegium Naturae Curiosorum, was earlier, in 1652, but was largely dedicated to medicine.\n\nThese societies, besides offering scholars a chance to meet (the Royal Society met weekly) also provided an outlet for disseminating results through publication. The journal established by the Royal Society came out under the title “Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society” (or Phil. Trans.), “philosophical” in its seventeenth century usage (from “love of wisdom”) as the pursuit of knowledge—all knowledge.\n\n3.1 Earthquake investigations in 1666\n\nThe first opportunity that members of the newly-founded Royal Society had to investigate an earthquake came in 1666. Of all the earthquakes to become historically important, that of 19 January 1666 must be one of the most unlikely. It was small (\\(\\sim \\)3 ML) and did no damage. But it was felt in Oxford, home to some of the finest scientific minds in the country.\n\nThe date of the event is variously given as 19 January 1665 according to the Julian calendar, and 29 January 1666 according to the Gregorian, which did not come into official use in Britain until 1752. The compromise followed here is to use the date according to the “old style” still in use, but with the modern practice of beginning the year on 1 January rather than 25 March, hence 19 January 1666. The epicentre was near the Buckinghamshire-Oxfordshire border, probably on the Buckingham side, and the highest assignable intensity is 4–5 EMS at Brill. It was felt over most of the two counties. At Oxford, the intensity was only 3 EMS, where it was felt by the mathematician John Wallis (Fig. 2), who noticed “some kind of odd shaking or heaving” in his study (Wallis 1666), which he took at first to be due to the passage of carts or coaches nearby.\n\n3.1.1 Wallis\n\nWallis’s (1666) paper on the earthquake consists largely of thermometric and barometric observations made around the time of the earthquake, and descriptions of the instruments used. This is frustrating to the modern seismologist, who is looking for information on the effects of the quake in order to reconstruct the macroseismic field, and has no interest in completely irrelevant meteorological detail. However, it is important to view things in context. Wallis himself had no idea what measurements were relevant and which were not. Thus his observations were a very natural attempt to collect potentially important information. They also mark what is almost certainly the first ever attempt to gather instrumental data in an earthquake investigation. The data may have been the wrong data, but the motivation was correct. Ho noted that his barometer (which he refers to as a “baroscope”) had risen half an inch about the time of the earthquake, but confessed he was not watching it closely at the time, and has no conclusions to draw.\n\nWallis also attempted to determine the extent to which the earthquake was felt, collecting information from outlying villages, namely Blechington, Bostol, Horton, Stanton-St Johns and Whately. From this, he concluded that Oxford “was about the skirts” of the area affected (Wallis 1666).\n\n3.1.2 Boyle\n\nThe second account of the earthquake to appear in Phil. Trans. was by another well-known name not normally associated today with earthquakes—Robert Boyle. Boyle was visiting friends outside Oxford at the time of the shock, and observed a “manifest trembling in the house” not so strong as to be recognised at once as an earthquake, but felt also by the other occupants of the house.\n\nBoyle (1666) conjectured that the effects of the earthquake might be more pronounced on higher ground, so sent an enquiry to an acquaintance in Brill, who reported back that the effects were more considerable than in Oxford. Boyle’s short text implies at the end that he intended to make more a extensive investigation of the extent of the shock; if he did, it was not published.\n\n3.1.3 Hooke\n\nRobert Hooke’s “Lectures and discourses of earthquakes” followed 2 years after Wallis and Boyle’s letters to the Royal Society, but were not published until the next century (Hooke 1705). Hooke has sometimes been credited as being the first contributor to the history of seismology, on account of his development of the theory of elasticity (e.g. Wallace et al. nd). However, Hooke’s interest in elasticity and his interest in earthquakes were two quite separate things, and is not until the next century that anyone would make the connection between the two subjects.\n\nHooke’s interest in earthquakes was actually not in the nature of seismic phenomena, but in their impact on geology. The particular problem that concerned Hooke was that of fossils. The existence of fossil sea-shells in strata far from the sea and at considerable elevations was problematic, given that at this period it was taken for granted that the Earth was less than 6,000 years old.\n\nThere were two possible explanations. If they were truly the remains of sea creatures in a mineralised form, then some agency must have been responsible for the dislocation. Alternatively, they were not the remains of sea creatures, but purely inorganic mineral formations that imitated living forms according to some inherent tendency of things towards certain shapes, a “plastick vertue” or “apish tricks of Nature”.\n\nHooke found this far-fetched. If a fossil looked like a shell in the finest detail, then it clearly was a shell, even if the process of fossilisation was, at that time, a mystery. Furthermore, if fossils were simply minerals following the form of living things, why were these so often sea shells, and never fruit or vegetables? It followed, then, that some great force had uplifted the former seabed, and for this, Hooke looked to earthquakes.\n\nHe proceeded to approach the subject after the manner of Francis Bacon, listing and attempting to classify the various types of earthquake (Oldroyd 1972). These he considered purely in terms of their uplift or downthrow effect, which is all that was relevant for explaining fossils. Thus he distinguishes between earthquakes that raise up land that was originally at or near sea level from those that raise up the seabed, or raise up mountains from level country. He does not seem to have been interested in the fact that many earthquakes that are felt, have no such effects. Thus the historical examples he gives are all of either: great earthquakes that did cause large land movements; volcanic eruptions (often accompanied by earthquakes); or landslides (giving some notable British examples of these).\n\nHooke does proceed towards a hypothesis to explain why earthquakes occur, which is ingenious and unlike any preceding. He was well aware that in historical times the position of the magnetic poles had changed. Now he speculated that the position of Earth’s axis of rotation and centre of gravity might also fluctuate also. This would set up instabilities that would cause the slipping and sliding of strata in response.\n\nThe chain of reasoning by which Hooke arrives at his conclusions is interesting from the perspective of the development of scientific method (Oldroyd 1972) even if his ideas seemed absurd to his contemporaries (Rappaport 1986). The idea of a gravitational cause of earthquakes is rather more sophisticated than blasts of underground winds, and had Hooke thought more about the mechanics of the displacement of strata that would be necessary, he might have deduced the role of faulting well ahead of anyone else.\n\n3.2 Writings after the 1692 Verviers earthquake\n\nKey British earthquakes in the development of seismological writing in Britain have tended to be those felt where the intelligentsia were; usually London, and exceptionally in the case of the 1666 event, Oxford. The 1580 quake is the first example. The second occurred on 8 September 1692. This earthquake, one of the largest in NW Europe, had an epicentre near Verviers, Belgium (Alexandre et al. 2010). It was very distinctly felt in London and SE England, and as far as Somerset (Melville et al. 1996).\n\nThis earthquake was one of a triad that made a large impact on the British public consciousness in the early 1690s, the other two being the Jamaican earthquake of 1692, that destroyed the colony town of Port Royal, and the 1693 Val di Noto earthquake, Sicily. The latter event is considered to have been the largest Italian earthquake in historical times (Boschi and Guidoboni 2001). It caused heavy destruction in the region of Catania and Noto in SE Sicily. The latter city was so completely ruined that it was rebuilt in a new location.\n\n3.2.1 Hallywell\n\nLittle is known about Charles Hallywell. He was born in Sussex about 1672, graduated from Christ’s College Cambridge, and eventually became vicar of the parish of Seaford, Sussex, and died there in 1707 (Peile 1913). His “Philosophical discourse of earthquakes: Occasioned by the late earthquake, September the 8th 1692” was published under the initials “C.H.” only. Attribution to Hallywell is provided by Peile (1913). Hallywell felt the 1692 earthquake in Sussex, which led him, as a clergyman, “to the consideration of the immediate Origine and Natural Causes of Earthquakes; not at all doubting, but that there is a higher Power which moderates and guides the blind impetus and force of such raging and ferocient Motions”—the orthodox view that God works through natural forces (Hallywell 1693).\n\nIn setting out his theoretical basis he cites his sources: Thomas Burnet’s Theory of the Earth (Burnet 1691), Athanasius Kircher’s Mundus Subterraneus (Kircher 1664) and Libertus Fromondus’s Meteorologicorvm Libri Sex (Froidmont 1627) are referenced in particular.\n\nHallywell’s main idea is that the earth is largely hollow, and that we live on a thin shell above a vast system of caverns. He gives various bits of evidence for this—rivers disappearing underground, for instance. However, he differs from the Aristotelians in favouring fire as the explanation for earthquakes. His idea is that exhalations from deep subterranean heat permeate the earth, leaving deposits of sulphurous, nitrous, bituminous and other potentially explosive minerals. Occasionally subterraneous fire penetrates into rocks containing these deposits, and the resulting explosions are felt at the surface as earthquakes.\n\nHe then gives five examples of earthquake effects and argues that these are compatible with underground explosions: thunderings heard underground, earthquakes felt over large areas almost simultaneously, cities being swallowed up, ejection of groundwater, and the formation of new islands.\n\nWhile less scientific in his reasoning than his contemporary Flamsteed (see next section), his arguments are better expressed than some other writers, and at least progress away from underground winds. he concludes by remarking\n\nAnd if any one shall think that these Phaenomena being terrible and rare, that therefore they must needs signifie and prognosticate strange things; I must tell him, That I am not at all inclinable to Astrological Vanities: so I think that an earthquake may happen as well as many a blazing Star, without any ominous or direful Presages (Hallywell 1693).\n\n3.2.2 Flamsteed\n\nJohn Flamsteed (Fig. 3) was a prominent name in late seventeenth century science in Britain; he is best known today for having been the first Astronomer Royal (appointed in 1675). He was greatly impressed by the earthquakes of 1692–1693, which inspired him to apply himself to trying to solve the theoretical problem of the cause of earthquakes.\n\nHis essay (Flamsteed 1750), in the form of a letter to a correspondent in Turin, was posthumously published after the London earthquakes of 1750 (see Sect. 3.3.2). In the introduction, he states that he was refraining from printing it to avoid having to deal with criticisms—hence the fact that it was only published around 30 years after his death.\n\nHis sources, besides observations on the recent earthquakes, including a first-hand account of the Port Royal earthquake from a neighbour, one Captain Guy, consisted of conversations with some merchants acquainted with earthquakes from living long in Smyrna, and “a book of Keckerman’s”. The latter is presumed to be a work by Bartholomew Keckerman (1575–1609), a prolific author on many subjects; Flamsteed took from him an account of the Unterwalden earthquake (Switzerland) of 18 September 1601 (New Style).\n\nHe made seven main observations. First, he said, earthquakes always happen in calm seasons. This is supported by Keckerman (who notes it is consistent with Aristotle), and the reports of Captain Guy and the Smyrna merchants.\n\nSecondly, a noise in the air is always heard just before the shaking starts. This is supported by experience in London in 1692, and also from some British earthquakes earlier in the century.\n\nThirdly, earthquakes can be felt at sea. An earthquake at sea is experienced on board ship as if the vessel had run aground; evidence from the Smyrna merchants, and Hooke.\n\nFouthly, some earthquakes affect very large regions, while others are local. Flamsteed has an exaggerated idea of the extent of the 1601 Unterwalden earthquake from Keckerman: “felt in Part of Asia, all over Thrace, Hungary, Bohemia, Germany, Italy and France at the same time”. He knew that the 1692 Verviers earthquake was felt in France, Germany and the Netherlands as well as SE England, and also knew that it was not felt in the North of England or Scotland. This is contrasted with the limited extent of the 1666 event; on account of inaccurate time records, he had the mistaken idea that the shock took some time to travel a small distance.\n\nHis fifth observation is that “subterraneous noises, explosions, and eruptions, commonly precede or accompany such as are of any large extent; but not all the great ones.” This is derived chiefly from Keckerman.\n\nHis last two points come from London observations of 8 September 1692: it was felt much more in upper floors than at ground level, and it made some people feel nauseous.\n\nThese observations gave Flamsteed the evidence he needed to show that earthquakes could not be due to underground shocks or explosions. If they occurred underground, earthquakes should happen in stormy or rainy conditions just as much as in calm conditions. Secondly, a noise in the air means something is happening in the air, not in the ground. Thirdly, how could an underground shock cause a ship floating on the sea to shake, when the sea itself remained calm? Then, if an earthquake can be felt over a very large region, if it were caused by explosions in subterranean caverns, it follows that the cavern system must extend everywhere, which seems inherently improbable. Lastly and conclusively, a shock originating underground would be felt more strongly at ground level and least strongly in the upper floors of buildings, the reverse of what is observed.\n\nTherefore earthquakes must be atmospheric explosions. “But because the common people have seen their houses shaken and overturned ... they have therefore used to say, whenever their houses shake, that the earth shakes; and so to rest satisfied with this as a general reason of earthquakes” (Flamsteed 1750). Flamsteed continues to explore the implications of this, considering that some very fine particles of nitrous or sulphurous material in the atmosphere must be responsible for the explosions. He notes, for instance, that the weather was wet in the North of England and Scotland on 8 September 1692—which would wash these particles out of the atmosphere, explaining why the shock that was felt in London was not felt in the North.\n\nFlamsteed has received little recognition for his account of earthquakes, largely because it has been dismissed as entirely wrong by those with the benefit of hindsight. Wrong it may be, but it is an excellent piece of reasoning from available evidence, given the information available to Flamsteed, and, as noted by Kennedy and Sarjeant (1982) he deserves full credit.\n\n3.2.3 Crouch\n\nNathaniel Crouch is a very different figure. His interest today is less related to what he wrote and more in the influence he had. He was by profession a bookseller, and having identified a gap in the market for small, popular, easily-digested volumes, he set to fill it himself. His technique was to boil down standard texts into shorter, simplified works; the resulting works were readable and accessible, and became popular, remaining in print well after his death some time in the 1720s.\n\nHis works, which include many histories, were published under the pseudonym of Richard Burton, often abbreviated to R.B. In editions published after his death this was changed to Robert Burton.\n\nHis work on earthquakes (Crouch 1694) came out under the lengthy title “The General History of Earthquakes: Being an Account of the Most Remarkable and Tremendous Earthquakes That Have Happened in Divers Parts of the World, From the Creation to This Time; As They Are Recorded by Sacred and Common Authors; And Particularly Those Lately in Naples, Smyrna, Jamaica and Sicily. With a Description of the Famous Burning Mount, Aetna, in That Island; And the Relation of the Several Dreadful Conflagrations and Fiery Irruptions Thereof for Many Ages. Likewise the Natural and Material Causes of Earthquakes, With the Usual Signs and Prognosticks of Their Approach; And the Consequences and Effects That Have Followed Several of Them”. As is evident from this title, Crouch lumped volcanoes in with earthquakes. It remained in print at least until 1734 (Burton 1734).\n\nAs might be expected from Crouch’s reputation as a hack writer, this book contains no original ideas. His theoretical exposition of earthquakes is back to Aristotle’s underground winds, with the extra detail that he distinguishes between natural and supernatural earthquakes, the latter being caused directly by God.\n\nThe book has more interest as an earthquake catalogue, the first such to be compiled in Britain since Fleming in 1580. But the work is not intended as anything more than a popular digest, and as a serious work is far behind the near-contemporary earthquake catalogue of Bonito (1691) in Italy.\n\n3.3 The 18th century\n\nIn the eighteenth century, once more developments were driven by events, in particular the London earthquakes of 8 February and 8 March 1750, and the Lisbon earthquake of 1 November 1755. The London earthquakes were, like the 1666 Buckingham earthquake, insignificant seismologically, with magnitudes less than 3 ML. It was the fact that they occurred directly under the city, causing much alarm, that prompted a response from the scientific community of the day. In contrast, the great Lisbon earthquake was a disaster that shook the whole of Europe metaphorically if not literally, and raised earthquakes up the scientific agenda across the whole continent (Kendrick 1956).\n\nIronically, it was one year before the London earthquakes that Thomas Short published his now-notorious earthquake catalogue, and it is to this that we must turn first. The following account is based largely on Musson (2005).\n\n3.3.1 Short\n\nThomas Short (1690–1772) was a physician from Derbyshire in the English Midlands. He was active in research, and had two main subjects of interest: one was the properties of various mineral waters, and the other was mortality and its possible links to different factors, especially of a meteorological nature. The latter interest gave rise to the work for which he is best known today, “A general chronological history of the air, weather, seasons, meteors, &c. in sundry places and different times : more particularly for the space of 250 years : together with some of their most remarkable effects on animal (especially human) bodies and vegetables”, to give its full title (Short 1749).\n\nHis intention in writing this two-volume work was commendably scientific: to compile a chronological study of all known disease epidemics, combine it with whatever data could be found on the state of the weather, and look for correlations. As was typical for the period, he took a very broad view of what constituted “weather”, and he consequently collected data also on earthquakes, comets, eclipses, etc.\n\nThe bulk of the two volumes is taken up by a chronological text in which all types of event are mixed up together. The following short extract for 1087–1088 gives the flavour:\n\nGreat Thunder and Lightning; one half of all the People of England was seized with a violent burning Fever, which began last Year, and proved very fatal to Multitudes. At the same Time a Murrain made sad havock among Cattle; the remainder of tame Fowls, as Hens, Geese, &c. fled to the Woods; devouring Flames consumed most of the great Buildings in England; with all bad Seasons, followed by a general Famine, no less fatal an Earthquake. A fiery Dragon was seen flying in the Air, cast forth Flames out of his Mouth: Soon after followed the epidemic Ignis Sater. Isac. Chron.\n\nSources are cited, if rather tersely. Possibly not always correctly: “Isac. Chron.” [sic] in the extract above proves to be rather hard to trace, but it seems that it can only refer to Isaacson (1633). However, Isaacson (1633) does not contain the information in the passage above.\n\nAfter nearly 800 pages of this sort of writing, the work concludes with an appendix. This appendix consists of what is described as “A General Chronological TABLE of Meteors, Weather, Seasons, Diseases, &c”. Each phenomenon is given its own section, starting with earthquakes, in which events are listed in order of date, from the very earliest times up to the early eighteenth century. The earliest earthquake listed is “A Great one at Babylon” in 2407 AM (1354 BC) and the last is a Sussex (South England) event in 1734.\n\nThis table contains a great many pre-millennial earthquakes, mostly in Britain, not known from any other sources. These earthquakes, starting with one that reportedly shook Edinburgh Castle in the year 10, cannot be genuine because there are simply no sources from this period that could have reported them. There was no Edinburgh Castle in 10 AD (though there was an Iron Age hill fort in its place) and there is no mention of Edinburgh as a place in any document until around 600. None of the events in the tables are given any source citation, and none of the doubtful ones appear in the text. However, many later writers, starting with Meldola and White (1885), followed by Roper (1889) and Milne (1912) have used this table uncritically. It was only when Davison (1924) produced his catalogue that anyone began to cast doubt on these records. Even so, they have proved hard to eradicate. The most of enduring of them, the “earthquake” of 811 which supposedly destroyed the town of St Andrews in Eastern Scotland, with a death toll of 1400, appears in the study of world earthquakes by Tiedemann (1992) and can now be found in the NEIC online world earthquake database, complete with epicentre (but no magnitude).\n\nOne can only speculate as to the origin of these reports, but Short states that he spent sixteen years compiling his chronology, and no doubt he called on as many friends and acquaintances as he could to supply him with data. The work, according to Short, could not have been done “whilst these scraps of histories lay scattered in a vast multitude of authors of different designs and professions”. It is possible that someone attempted to play a practical joke and supplied Short with a fantasy list of occurrences to see if he would detect the imposture. If, perhaps, Short was suspicious of this list but not altogether certain, one can imagine that he might relegate it to the appendix. That way, if it were genuine, the information would not be lost, and if it were fake, the main substance of his work (the text) would not be sullied by these false data (Musson 2005).\n\nProbably few modern readers have bothered to look at Short’s actual conclusions, in which he attempts to find temporal correlations between weather events and epidemics, without the benefit of any statistical means of assessment. He finds insufficient evidence of any tendency for earthquakes to be followed by outbreaks of disease, but does find a suggestion of the reverse: that epidemics are followed by earthquakes. Wisely, he refrains from attempting to propose any reason for this.\n\n3.3.2 Writing after the London earthquakes of 1750\n\nIt is a commonly-made complaint today that the national media give far more attention to what happens in London than events anywhere else in the country. This is nothing new. While the 1580 earthquake generated numerous pamphlets, a damaging earthquake in the West Midlands 5 years previously generated little attention (Musson 2008). Two years before the Verviers earthquake, a strong earthquake in north-west Wales similarly had little impact on the intelligentsia of the day. But in 1750, two very minor earthquakes (on 8 February and 8 March), with magnitudes probably less than 3 ML (Musson 1994), but epicentres within the city of London, produced enormous interest and another spate of writing and publishing.\n\nProminent at the time was the printed edition of a sermon by Thomas Sherlock (1678–1761), then Bishop of London. “A letter from the Lord Bishop of London, to the clergy and people of London and Westminster; on occasion of the late earthquakes” (Sherlock 1750) pronounced the earthquakes to be manifestations of God’s wrath and the depravity of the citizens of London, particularly plays, operas, cock-fighting and novels. According to Horace Walpole, “ten thousand were sold in 2 days and fifty thousand have been subscribed for since the first two editions” (Yonge 1890). Sherlock’s eagerness to promote the work was satirised at the time (Bentley and Whitehead 1750).\n\nSherlock has been credited as the author of an anonymous work (Anon 1750a) entitled “The theory and history of earthquakes: Containing, I. A rational account of their causes and effects, illustrated by experiments and observations on subterraneous vapours, and the manner of making artificial earthquakes; II. A particular and authentic history of those which have happened in these kingdoms, and the most remarkable of those abroad, viz. in Sicily, Jamaica, and Lima, with the most considerable eruptions of Vesuvius and Aetna; III. Some seasonable reflections on the two late earthquakes, with a pathetic address, on that occasion, to the inhabitants of London and Westminster. Humbly inscribed to the Right Rev. Thomas, Lord Archbishop of Canterbury” (e.g. see http://books.ioba.org/books/256385747.html). This attribution is almost certainly wrong. Sherlock used Whiston of Fleet Street to publish his sermon, whereas the “theory and history” was published by Newbery of St Paul’s Churchyard. Perhaps more telling is that the anonymous author of “theory and history” rails against the evils of deism, a word not used by Sherlock (1750).\n\nAnon (1750a) can be passed over with just a mention that its author believed earthquakes to be caused by a mixture or iron, sulphuric acid and water.\n\nI also pass over Zachery Grey, who published under the pseudonym “A Gentleman of the University of Cambridge” (Grey 1750). He produced a short catalogue of notable earthquakes, with British events helpfully listed in a separate appendix. The most interesting thing about it is that the author felt it worthwhile to publish a continuation of it after the Lisbon earthquake five years later (Grey 1756).\n\nOf the authors who attempted to explain earthquakes scientifically in 1750, the most important is William Stukeley (1687–1765).\n\n3.3.3 Stukeley\n\nThe Rev. William Stukeley (Fig. 4) is best known today for his antiquarian writings, particularly concerning prehistoric stone circles such as Avebury and Stonehenge. But after the London earthquakes he gave an address to the Royal Society setting out his ideas on the causes of earthquakes, on 15 and 22 March 1750, as well as preaching a sermon on the theological aspects of earthquakes. He then collected both parts and published them in book form as “The Philosophy of Earthquakes, Natural and Religious”. Stukeley was thus another dualist: earthquakes were divinely ordained, but operated through natural means.\n\nStukeley (1750) starts, as did Flamsteed, by setting out a number of propositions to be taken as initial evidence. They can be summarised here:\n\n(1)\n\nEarthquakes always happen in calm weather.\n\n(2)\n\nThey can be felt at sea when the sea is calm.\n\n(3)\n\nEarthquakes vary in magnitude; some shake much larger areas than others. (Stukeley actually uses the word “magnitude” here, nearly 200 years before Richter).\n\n(4)\n\nStrength of shaking (“vibratory motion”) varies between earthquakes.\n\n(5)\n\nEarthquakes are accompanied or preceded by a noise like thunder.\n\n(6)\n\nEarthquakes are felt more strongly in the upper floors of buildings.\n\n(7)\n\nThe shock is more violent for stone buildings than for lightly-built ones.\n\n(8)\n\nMany people feel sick or have headaches after an earthquake.\n\n(9)\n\nEarthquakes mostly affect cities, particularly coastal ones.\n\n(10)\n\nEarthquakes do not damage springs, but render the water cloudy.\n\n(11)\n\nEarthquakes are more common near volcanoes.\n\nThis is an interesting mixture of astute and false observation. The common myth of earthquakes occurring in fair weather reappears, and evidently earthquakes are more reported from cities, since that is where the people are.\n\nStukeley next dismisses all ideas of subterranean winds or fires. Earthquakes occur instantaneously over large areas, which cannot be explained by the movement of wind or fire. He also draws attention to point (11) as having misled previous writers into making an association with subterranean fire.\n\nHe dismisses Hallywell’s ideas about the largely hollow earth by noting that areas of extensive coal mines in Britain are not particularly prone to earthquakes. He also argues that since there are instances of coal mines being set on fire, and in such cases the effects have been nothing like an earthquake, then conflagration of subterranean combustible matter cannot be the cause of earthquakes. This is a very effective argument. “If the movement of a superficies of 30 miles diameter was owing to fumes, and vapours; we ought reasonably to find some great discharges of them, belching out smoke and fire, for a long time after ...” (Stukeley 1750).\n\nA further argument is produced from observations of springs, though this is less good. Springs are the surface manifestation of a system of underwater pipes and conduits laid by God at the time of Creation. If earthquakes arose from any underground cause, the whole system would by now have been thoroughly wrecked, and spring water could not reach the ground surface.\n\nAnother clever but specious argument runs as follows: siege engineers know that when an underground explosion is detonated, the volume affected by the shock is like an inverted cone. Therefore, for an earthquake such as those reported from Asia Minor with a felt area of diameter 300 miles, if it originated from an underground explosion, the axis of the cone of effect would be 200 miles, therefore the originating source would have to be 200 miles deep, which is an absurdity. If any explosion were powerful enough to affect such a huge volume, all springs in the area would be completely disrupted.\n\nStukeley now refers explicitly to Flamsteed (1750), which he encountered after giving his lectures to the Royal Society, but before book publication. He concludes that Flamsteed was on the right lines, but hampered by not knowing about the principles of electricity, which had been developed since Flamsteed wrote in 1693.\n\nElectricity is the key for Stukeley. “... we see, upon a touch, or an approach, between a non-electric and an electrified body, what a wonderful vibration is produced! ... how violent a shock! Is it to be wonder’d at, that hither we turn our thoughts, for the solution of the prodigious appearance of an earthquake?” (Stukeley 1750). From here he goes on to discuss the state of the weather before various earthquakes, and concludes, “if a non-electric cloud discharges its contents upon any part of the earth, when in a highly electrified state, an earthquake must necessarily ensue.”\n\nHe now runs through his eleven propositions and finds they are all compatible with his electrical hypothesis. For instance, for number (7), “... the more substantial the building, the more violent is the shock: exactly the mode of electrical vibration” (Stukeley 1750). Whereas, of course, the observation really stems from the greater resilience of wooden buildings to earthquake vibration. However, Stukeley’s thinking is far more well thought out than the likes of contemporaries like pseudo-Sherlock (Anon 1750a).\n\nStukeley’s ideas, though a blind alley, proved remarkably resilient, and certainly as late as the nineteenth century one can find references to supposed electrical observations after earthquakes. The Australian amateur seismologist Albert Biggs found it necessary, in 1892, to inform the Launceston Examiner (28 January 1892 p3) on the occasion of a strong earthquake in the Tasman Sea, that the shock could not have been electrical in nature as electrical telegraph equipment was unaffected.\n\n3.3.4 The “dissertation”\n\nA further anonymous work, the author of which it has not been possible to trace, is a work issued by the publisher James Roberts, entitled “A dissertation upon earthquakes, their causes and consequences; Comprehending an explanation of the nature and composition of subterraneous vapours, their amazing force, and the manner in which they operate; the sentiments, on this head, of the most learned philosophers ancient and modern; the different kinds of earthquakes, distinguished by their Effects; a copious Collection of authentick Relations digested under those titles, the greater part of which have happened in Great Britain. Together with a distinct account of, and some remarks upon, the shock of an earthquake, felt in the cities of London and Westminster, on Thursday, February 8, 1749–1750” (Anon 1750b). This is another work espousing the cause of underground explosions. Its chief interest is in its exposition of the various kinds of earthquakes, which demonstrates how loosely the word was still used to mean any sort of disruption of the land, including landslips and volcanic eruptions.\n\nThese are listed as follows:\n\n(1)\n\nThe earth lying level with the sea is raised up.\n\n(2)\n\nThe bottom of the sea is raised and becomes dry land.\n\n(3)\n\nA plain is heaved up into a hill.\n\n(4)\n\nThe earth is raised up by fresh earth being laid on it (i.e. lava or volcanic ash).\n\n(5)\n\nThe earth sinks, leaving a valley or lake.\n\n(6)\n\nLand lying level sinks suddenly and violently.\n\n(7)\n\nParts of the sea bed sink, causing whirlpools.\n\n(8)\n\nLandslips.\n\n(9)\n\nMild earthquakes without ground displacement.\n\n(10)\n\nConvulsions deep in the Earth not perceptible at the surface.\n\nThe author gives “examples” of all of these, noting that most British earthquakes are of the ninth type (the 1580 earthquake is classified as the sixth, for some reason). One can see the influence of Hooke (who is mentioned by name). Unlike Stukeley (1750); Anon (1750b) is not much concerned with earthquakes as a shaking phenomenon.\n\n3.3.5 Writing after the Lisbon earthquake of 1755\n\nWhile the 1750 London earthquakes inspired an effusion of writing about earthquakes, for obvious reasons, this sudden interest in the subject was confined to Britain. The great Lisbon earthquake of 1 November 1755 was a different matter. The effects of the earthquake, at least so far as seiches, extended as far as Scotland and Scandinavia. Equally, the scale of the disaster sent an intellectual shockwave across Europe. The earthquake occurred in the morning of All Saint’s Day, and collapsing churches killed many worshippers. On the other hand, those who skipped Divine service and were taking their pleasure in the parks, survived. If earthquakes were instruments of Divine will, this was hard to explain.\n\nPossibly the best known dissertation on earthquakes written after 1755 was an essay complied far away in Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad) on the Baltic coast. It is well known not because it was particularly insightful, but because the author was one Immanuel Kant (1756a, b, c) who later went on to greater things.\n\nI pass over various hack publications in Britain such as Hunter (1756) and Montagu (1756). But one British writer after 1755 presents a departure from the theoretical speculations that have been discussed up to now in this treatise. The interest today in the writings of people like Flamsteed and Stukeley is seeing how they reasoned from the data available to them. Their conclusions may have been wrong, but their arguments were scientific. Now we need to consider for the first time a writer whose importance is that he got something right. His name was John Michell.\n\n3.3.6 Michell\n\nThough one of the most original scientific thinkers of the eighteenth century, John Michell is sadly little remembered much today. His work on magnetism and gravity were both important: he invented a way to make artificial magnets, showed that magnetic force decreases as the square of distance, and laid the foundations for the work of Henry Cavendish in making the first accurate measurement of the mass of the Earth. In astronomy, amongst other advances, he made observations on stellar parallax that allowed him to make an accurate estimation of the distance from the solar system to the nearest star. In 1784 he was considering the effect of gravity on light, and postulated that a heavy enough stellar object could prevent light from escaping—the first description of what we now know as a black hole.\n\nHe was born in 1724, most likely in Nottingham, and entered Queen’s College, Cambridge, at the age of 17, and was elected a Fellow of the college after graduation, and then appointed Woodwardian Professor of Geology. On the occasion of his marriage in 1764 he gave up both Fellowship and Professorship and left Cambridge for the quiet life of a country rector, first in Hampshire, and then finally at the little Yorkshire village of Thornhill. where he died in 1793.\n\nMichell was also inspired by the disaster at Lisbon to consider the subject of earthquakes. He gave an address to the Royal Society in 1759 in which he outlined his ideas (Michell 1759); it was published the following year (Michell 1760).\n\nUp until this point, a major problem to understanding earthquakes was the issue of “action at a distance”—something considered impossible without physical contact. The transmission of earthquake effects required some medium, and the only possible candidate seemed to be air. Either this was air in underground caverns, as with the Aristotelians, or the atmosphere, as for Flamsteed. In both cases, it was air or gas that provided a fluid medium for the propagation of the shock from one place to another.\n\nIt was Michell who realised that the true mode of propagation was by means of elastic waves through a solid medium. Compression at the earthquake source, he wrote, “must be propagated on account of the elasticity of the earth, in the same manner as a pulse is propagated through the air ... a dilation will succeed to the compression; and these two following each other alternately for some time a vibratory motion will be produced at the surface of the earth” (Michell 1760).\n\nIt had long been known (since Leonardo da Vinci) that sound travelled as waves. It was Michell who made the fundamental realisation that earthquakes did as well. This allowed him also to explain earthquake sound, which hitherto had been related to explosions. “If these alternate dilations and compressions should succeed one another at very short intervals, they would excite a like motion in the air, and thereby occasion a considerable noise” (Michell 1760). Or to put it another way, some of the wave energy bleeds from the earth into the atmosphere, where it is perceived as sound.\n\nThe idea that earthquakes are perceptible as elastic waves also implies that wave energy radiates out from a relatively small source, whereas underground winds have no particular source. Furthermore, it should be possible, at least in theory, to locate the source observationally. Thus, Michell was able to devise an outline concept of earthquake location. Given two observers at different locations, if one feels an earthquake shock coming from the south-west, and the other feels the same shock coming from the south-east, then by drawing a line south-westwards from the first observer and south-eastwards from the second, the origin of the earthquake should be where the two lines cross.\n\nAlternatively, if the shock arrived at the first observer before it arrived at the second, the origin must be closer to the first observer. With enough observations, one should be able to pinpoint the origin. However, as Michell realised, human powers of sensing direction or time-keeping were hardly up to the task, and he admitted that neither of these methods were really practical. However, they do anticipate the basic principles of earthquake location as are used today. They also anticipate attempts to locate earthquakes from non-instrumental data in the following century, by Mallet, and later by Davison.\n\nMichell had less success in suggesting a cause for earthquakes. Like many before him, he noted that there seemed to be a connection between earthquakes and volcanoes. He supposed that in various places there existed great subterranean fire-pits of burning material (perhaps coal or shale). The rock strata above one of these fire-pits would be arched upwards by the heat. Periodically bits of it would collapse, water in the rock would turn into vapour instantaneously as it fell into the fire, and this would produce a concussion that would engender an earthquake. This did seem to explain why earthquakes seemed to happen repeatedly in the same place; after a roof-fall there would be a recuperation phase where the strata arched upwards again before the next fall could take place.\n\nHowever, at one point he came tantalising close to the truth. He wrote:\n\nBesides the raising of the strata in a ridge, there is another very remarkable appearance in the structure of the earth, though a very common one; and this is what is usually called by miners, the trapping down of the strata; that is, the whole set of strata on one side of a cleft are sunk down below the level of the corresponding strata on the other side. If, in some cases, this difference in the level of the strata, on the different sides of the cleft, should be very considerable, it may have a great effect in producing some of the singularities of particular earthquakes. (Michell 1760)\n\nThis passage is accompanied with a diagram, reproduced here (as Fig. 5), of fault displacement.\n\nMichell also discusses the 1755 tsunami, and concludes that for the wave to arrive at different places at the reported times required differing velocities along different paths, which he correctly, and far-sightedly, explains as due to different water depths.\n\nMichell was ahead of his time. The theory of the propagation of elastic waves in solids had to wait for the work of Siméon Poisson and Augustin-Louis Cauchy in the 1820s, and even they were well ahead of observational data.\n\n3.3.7 Bevis\n\nJohn Bevis (1693–1771) deserves a brief mention here on account of his book “The history and philosophy of earthquakes”, published under the pseudonym “A member of the Royal Academy of Berlin” (Bevis 1757). This is not so much an original work as a compilation of writings on earthquakes by the ten “most considerable writers on the subject”, including both Hooke and Stukeley. Davison (1927a) found the work of sufficient interest to accord Bevis a mention in his “Founders of seismology”, possibly due to the fact that it was used for reference by Michell (1760). It is hard to agree with Ben-Menahem (1995) that Bevis’s study is “pioneering” or marks “the dawn of modern seismology”.\n\n3.4 The end of the 18th century, beginning of the 19th\n\nBetween the Lisbon earthquake and the start of investigations at Comrie, there is little to report in the annals of British seismology. The only figure to be mentioned is the polymath Thomas Young (1773–1829), who was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy at the Royal Institution in 1801, and whose lectures were published in two volumes in 1807. Young is best known for his work in the fields of vision, light, solid mechanics, energy, physiology, language, musical harmony, and Egyptology (he worked on the decipherment of the Rosetta Stone).\n\n3.4.1 Young\n\nIn the course of lectures on natural philosophy published as Young (1807), discussion of earthquakes occurs in Lecture 57 “On aqueous and igneous meteors”, not a title that would be used today. Young believed that earthquakes and volcanic eruptions shared a common cause, which was essentially chemical in nature. To explain observations of earthquakes in non-volcanic regions, Young says, “where the agitation produced by an earthquake extends further than there is any reason to suspect a subterraneous commotion, it is probably propagated through the earth nearly in the same manner as a noise is conveyed through the air” (Young 1807).\n\nYoung is given credit as being an early proponent of earthquakes consisting of wave motion on the strength of this; Milne (1883) called this sentence “the first true conception of earthquake motion and the manner of its propagation”, which seems too strong praise.\n\nYoung also cites the observation of Sir William Hamilton (1783) with respect to the 1783 Calabrian earthquake and its aftershocks that the earthquake “appeared to consist in a sudden elevation of the ground to a considerable height, which was propagated somewhat like a wave, from west to east: besides this, the ground had also a horizontal motion backwards and forwards, and in some measure in a circular direction” (Young 1807).\n\nVolume Two of Young’s (1807) lectures contains a rather curious sort of earthquake catalogue entitled “Earthquakes and Agitations. In order of time.” This begins with an earthquake in 17 AD that destroyed twelve cities in Asia, and runs through to a Peruvian event in 1797. Despite its title, it is more of a chronological bibliography, including entries for Stukeley, Michell and many others. Some entries are somewhat cryptic today, such as “Wark’s method of measuring earthquakes. Ed. ess. III. 142. Roz. I. 376. By powdering the inside of a vessel partly filled with water” (Young 1807). For anyone interested, the full reference is Wark (1771). The Rev. David Wark experienced an earthquake at Lisbon on 26 December 1764, and dictated a short note on detecting earthquakes a few days before he died.\n\nDavison (1927a) hails this as the first bibliography of seismological publications, and notes that the importance of it is that it was Young who managed to trace the authorship of a number of anonymously-published works, including Bevis (1757).\n\nThe Perthshire village of Comrie, located north-west of Perth itself and in the valley of Strathearn, just south of the Highland Boundary Fault, has an important place in the history of seismology. This is a result of its being subject to occasional earthquake swarms: periods of intense earthquake activity lasting several years, and not fitting a typical mainshock-aftershock model.\n\nThe first of these swarms to be recorded took place between 1788 and 1801, culminating in the largest event of the series on 7 September 1801 (4.6 ML). This is unusual for a swarm to have something resembling a clear mainshock; equally it is unconventional for a mainshock to be preceded by 13 years of foreshocks. The sequence was documented by two local ministers; the Rev Samuel Gilfillan at Comrie and Ralph Taylor at Ochertyre, near Crieff. The former acquired the soubriquet “Secretary to the Earthquakes” as a result (Musson 1993).\n\nPrior to the 1788–1801 activity, it seems very likely that the earthquake of 8 November 1608 (\\(\\sim \\)4.5 ML) was another Comrie earthquake, though there are no reports closer to Comrie than Perth. Some lesser shocks in Perthshire in the following decades may be related.\n\nIt is always tempting, given a seismic source known to be repeatedly active, to attribute other, poorly-known events to the same source. This can lead to errors, as with Davison’s attempts to locate all earthquakes in Herefordshire to a single focus between Hereford and Ross-on-Wye (Davison 1924, 1927b)—in that case, in the teeth of good evidence to the contrary. However, just because it is sometimes wrong, does not make it always wrong, and it is tempting to suggest that the January–February 1202 sequence of earthquakes in Scotland may have originated at Comrie, partly because the length of the sequence (from 6 January into the following month) is commented on by the original sources (Musson 1994, 2008). Of course, other interpretations are possible, including a source near Stirling.\n\nIntermittent small earthquakes at Comrie continued sporadically over the first three decades of the nineteenth century, but it was in October 1839 that the next swarm began, which was to make the name of Comrie in the history of seismology. The first smart shock occurred on 3 October 1839, after which the frequency and strength of shocks increased rapidly. There was then a pause for a few days with no events, a few days in which it rained almost incessantly. Then on the night of 23 October 1839 the strongest event struck, with an estimated magnitude of 4.8 ML (Musson 1993). The unfortunate villagers rushed out of their houses into the pouring rain, and it was some time before they could be persuaded it was safe to return to their homes.\n\nThe 23 October event was followed by a period of intense earthquake activity, with multiple events felt in Comrie each day.\n\n4.1 The British Association Committee 1840–1841\n\nAt the Glasgow meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) in August 1840, ten months after the Comrie swarm had started, a resolution was passed to “register the shocks of earthquakes in Scotland and Ireland”—a minor earthquake had also been reported in Ireland (in Inishowen) at this time (British Association 1841; 1842). The committee was to consist of Lord Greenock (Charles Cathcart, 1783–1859, a retired general and amateur geologist, then residing in Edinburgh), David Milne (of whom more later), James Forbes (ditto), a Mr Paterson or Patterson, apparently in Ireland, Joseph Portlock (1794–1864, a geologist then resident in Belfast) and James Bryce (1806–1877, also a geologist in Northern Ireland, later moving to Glasgow). A grant of \\(\\pounds \\)20 was awarded to support the work of the committee. As Krehl (2009) notes, this was the first occasion on which such a committee for seismology had ever been created.\n\nNo record of the discussions around the formation of the committee are recorded. It may be noted in passing that Robert Mallet was present at the Glasgow meeting; the significance of this will be seen later. I have heard folklore to the effect that the committee was set up at the request of locals in Comrie; there is no evidence for this that I am aware of, and it seems extremely unlikely.\n\nFrom the outset, the objectives of the committee became exclusively focused on the Scottish activity. The first report of the committee, presented at the 1841 British Association meeting, noted difficulties in communication between the Scottish and Irish contingents on the committee (British Association 1842).\n\nThe committee had several meetings “at the beginning of winter” in 1840 to discuss the need for instrumental monitoring at Comrie. It seems that the committee had already been in communication with Peter Macfarlane in Comrie, who since the 23 October shock had been keeping a register of felt events, and had also been experimenting himself with instruments to measure the shocks. It was noted that Macfarlane’s instruments were too insensitive to record more than a small proportion of the earthquakes felt.\n\nPeter Macfarlane (d. 1874) was the local postmaster and storekeeper in the village. His local nickname was “Patey-a’-thing”, because anything you wanted, you would get at his store (Brough 1950 unpublished). He built a cupola on the roof of his store (later taken over by Brough and Macpherson) in the centre of Comrie, opposite the church, to accommodate his instruments; this survived for many years after his death, but was eventually destroyed by fire in 1903. Fig. 6 is a period photograph of the building, showing the cupola.\n\nTradition has it that the top-hatted figure on the left of the group of three in Fig. 6 is Macfarlane, but this is probably without good foundation. Macfarlane evidently died a wealthy man, since he left a very large bequest towards the building of the new Comrie parish church.\n\nTo facilitate keeping a register of shocks, Macfarlane devised one of the earliest ever intensity scales (Davison 1921a). However, the scale was entirely subjective in operation. He took the strength of the 23 October event as intensity 10, and then any subsequent shock he compared the strength, and rated it as half as strong (intensity 5) or whatever other fraction seemed appropriate. Macfarlane was to act as the British Association committee’s “man on the spot”.\n\nIn the committee’s first deliberations, they chose to design two types of instrument, one based on the common pendulum, the other on the inverted pendulum principle (see Sect. 4.2 below). One instrument of the former type was built in 1840 and two of the latter. They were sent to Comrie, where they were placed in Macfarlane’s charge. The smaller inverted pendulum instrument had a pendulum 1 m long and was installed in Comrie House; the larger had a pendulum 3.25 m long, and went into the steeple of the parish church (Fig. 7; note that the corner of the building just on the far right of this photo is the same building as in Fig. 6). The common pendulum was set up at Garriechrow, just west of Comrie (British Association 1842). The situation at the beginning of 1841 is shown in Fig. 8.\n\nIn the first seven months of 1841, the inverted pendulums were only affected by four shocks, on 10 and 22 March, and 25 and 26 July. The common pendulum at Garriechrow proved to be too insensitive to register at all. As an indication of the degree of friction affecting the inverted pendulum instruments, when the pendulums were moved by the March shocks, they stuck in their displaced positions and had to be recentred by hand.\n\nBy the time of the first report of the committee, they had concluded (a) that many or most of the earthquakes produced a vertical shock, which might require a different type of instrument, and (b) that the Comrie earthquakes were originating from a single spot, and that given sufficient instruments, this spot could be located.\n\nIn an offhand remark in a letter appended to the first report, David Milne states that, on 25 July, “an instrument of my own there [in the parish church] also indicated an upward movement to the extent of half an inch”. What this instrument was is otherwise not indicated, but it seems that Milne was already trying to investigate vertical movements.\n\nIn addition, the committee was attempting to keep abreast with extra-British developments, citing an earthquake register recently published in the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Turin. They also speculated that it might be desirable to have meteorological instruments installed at Comrie, in case the state of the atmosphere was relevant, or the cause was electrically related (shades of Stukeley).\n\nThe report concludes by recommending that the committee deal only with earthquakes in Scotland, and that its membership, dropping the Irish contingent, should be swelled with five new members (Robison, Jameson, Traill, Christison and Torrie, none of whom feature much in subsequent activities).\n\n4.2 James Forbes\n\nJames Forbes (1809–1868), at the time of the Comrie investigations, was Professor of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh University (Fig. 9). He is perhaps best known for his work on glaciers, and the Forbes Glacier in New Zealand is named after him. He lived at Greenhill in Edinburgh, on the south side of Bruntsfield Links.\n\nOf the British Association committee, it was Forbes who was given the task of designing an instrument to be deployed at Comrie. At the outset, he was shown some existing devices by Milne and Greenock, the nature of which has not been described in any surviving account. Forbes’s aim was to come up with something that combined the properties of “simplicity, compactness, comparability and an easy adjustment of sensibility” (Forbes 1844).\n\nA design based on a common pendulum had been already suggested for the investigation. Such instruments had already been employed in Italy since the middle of the previous century (Bina 1751). These generally employed long pendulums for adequate sensitivity, typically of the order of 2–3 m (Wartnaby 1972). Forbes was afraid that a length exceeding 6m would be required, and since the sensitivity would depend on the length of the pendulum and not the weight of the bob, this could not easily be adjusted.\n\nForbes drew inspiration from a paper describing an adjustable pendulum that could be used as a gravimeter (Kater 1818). Forbes’s idea was to use an inverted pendulum consisting of a vertical rod with a lead weight on it, balanced on a wire that could be made more or less stiff by means of an adjusting screw. By means of changing the height of the lead weight or the stiffness of the wire, the stability of the instrument could be altered, and hence its sensitivity to a lateral shock. The arrangement is shown in Fig. 10, taken from Forbes (1844). The registration part of the instrument consisted of a pencil on top of the rod, that could write on a paper disc fixed to the upper dome.\n\nOf course, the use of a pencil to write a trace introduced significant friction into the design. Forbes’s intention was to overcome this by increasing the mass of the pendulum. The additional instability of a heavier mass could be compensated for, if necessary, by shortening the wire using the pinching screw (D and E in Fig. 10).\n\nUnlike a common pendulum instrument, the great advantage of the inverted design was that the sensitivity was independent of the dimensions of the instrument. Thus it would be possible to make instruments sufficiently small to be easily portable. In fact, as Forbes (1844) pointed out, the larger the instrument, the greater the stiffness of the spring, and hence a larger instrument would actually be less sensitive. Forbes’s preferred length was 50 cm.\n\nForbes presented a paper to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 19 April 1841 in which he set out the description of his instrument, and described its mathematical properties in some detail. This was subsequently published three years later (Forbes 1844).\n\nIt was Milne who proposed the name for the device—“seismometer”. This was the first occasion on which any “seismo-” word had been employed, and words such as “seismograph”, “seismology” and “seismologist” are all back-formations from Milne’s coinage. Of course, lacking any time recording, the instrument would now be considered a seismoscope.\n\nOne surviving example of Forbes’s instruments is in the hands of the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh, but unfortunately it has lost its framework and dome. I have heard rumours that two other specimens exist in private hands, but have never been able to locate them.\n\n4.3 Further investigations at Comrie to 1843\n\nThe second annual report of the Committee (Milne 1843a) included a register of shocks at Comrie from 23 July 1841 to 8 June 1842. In this second report, the title of the Committee has changed to make its scope earthquakes in Great Britain, rather than just Scotland and Ireland. Out of 60 events felt in Comrie, only on three occasions did the instruments trigger. The Committee concluded that whereas the instruments were suited for the larger events, they were not sufficiently sensitive to record the smaller ones that were continuing.\n\nSince the first year report, another seven instruments had been installed, four of which were of the Forbes design. Of these, one was sent to Crieff, east of Comrie, one to St Fillans, west of Comrie, and one to Invergeldie, a location just north of Comrie (and now the location of a station in the current BGS broadband network). The last instrument was sent to Kinlochmoidart, on the west coast of Scotland, since shocks had occasionally been felt there (Fig. 11).\n\nA further seismoscope made of horizontal glass tubes with upturned ends, filled with mercury, was installed in Macfarlane’s observatory. This instrument, designed by Charles Wheatstone, was intended to indicate horizontal movements or inclinations of the ground, by the direction of mercury running out of the ends of the tubes.\n\nSince both this and Forbes’s instruments were intended to register horizontal shocks, there was now a need for something to register vertical movements, and for this a horizontal pendulum was designed. This instrument is rather interesting, as it was the first ever use of a horizontal pendulum in seismology (see the recent study of horizontal pendulums by Fréchet and Rivera 2012, which does not actually mention the Comrie instrument). As this is a significant milestone in seismography, it is rather regrettable that we have no idea who actually designed it. Possibly it was Milne, who as Secretary of the Committee and thus author of the report, may have hesitated to claim credit.\n\nThe report describes it as “a horizontal bar, fixed to a solid bar by means of a strong flat watch-spring, and loaded at the opposite end. If the wall suddenly raises or sinks, the loaded end of this horizontal rod remains, from its vis inertia, nearly at rest, and thus can move any light substance (as paper or a straw) brought against it by the vertical movement of the ground, and which light substance is so adjusted to stick wherever the rod leaves it.” (Milne 1843a).\n\nTwo of these instruments were made; one went in Macfarlane’s observatory, and the other went out to the Kinlochmoidart estate, entrusted to the proprietor of the estate, one William Robertson.\n\nFortunately, a second description of the instrument exists, which has not hithero been published. This was made by JCS Brough, who as a boy had access to the still-surviving observatory of Macfarlane, which remained intact for many years after Macfarlane’s death. JCS Brough was the son of J Brough, who took over Macfarlane’s store. He made a sketch from memory, which is reproduced here as Fig. 12 (Brough 1950 unpublished).\n\nThe rod (A), of a very light-weight wood, was balanced in a horizontal position by a steel spring (B) and would vibrate at the gentlest touch. To the far pointed end was fixed a fine looped wire (C). The instrument operated thus: to the end of the cupboard [the observatory room] was fitted a dial (perhaps 9“ or 10” in diameter), this being spaced around the circumference like a clock. It had a pair of very thin wood hands, one lighter than the other, both so adjusted in length that the loop of the wire came between them, the idea being that any movement of the rod would move the delicate hands. (Brough 1950 unpublished)\n\nBrough described it as “a home-made device”, but if it was one of two, it seems likely it was made in Edinburgh and assembled at Comrie.\n\nComrie was now surrounded by instruments on three sides, together with those in the village itself, with the object of pinpointing the source of the shocks by tracing back the recorded directions. In effect, this was the first ever use of a local network in seismology.\n\nThe Committee continued to be interested in whether the shocks were accompanied by any changes in the state of the atmosphere.\n\nSome persons, indeed, maintain that the shocks are nothing else than electrical discharges from the earth, and are preceded as well as followed by certain meteorological symptoms, which are capable of accurate registration. This view of the matter is, for the sake of the theory of earthquakes, deserving of being tested ... (Milne 1843a).\n\nThis is an interesting insight into the state of scientific knowledge at the time. While a barometer and thermometer had now been installed at Comrie, they were only being read twice a day. The Committee reported that it would be better to have the instruments read hourly, 24 h a day, but that the cost of hiring people to do this would be \\(\\pounds \\)40 a year.\n\nBy mid 1842, the earthquakes at Comrie were dying down. Nevertheless, in the British Association Committee’s report for the period July 1842 to June 1843, the committee was able to append to its report a register of shocks with date, time, intensity, duration, amplitude on the recording instruments (if any), and meteorological con"
