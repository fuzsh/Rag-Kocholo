The author discusses how selected stories from his personal experience reflect the intimate culture of a particular social group of which he was a participant member at the time. The author's life-journey includes a tumultuous period of emerging adulthood in Singapore and Oxford. Moving to Zambia in 1965 aged 21, he conducted research, teaching and writing including sojourns in England and in Maryland USA. He discusses how his perspective in cultural psychology relates to his personal life as a migrant and as a parent, and to his views on how the world can best address the challenges of cooperative communication in the 2020s.\n\nElement contents\n\nSummary\n\nReferences\n\nKeywords\n\ncultural psychologydevelopmental narrativeparentinghuman developmentAfrica\n\nType\n\nElement\n\nInformation\n\nSeries: Elements in Psychology and Culture\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009523813 [Opens in a new window]\n\nOnline ISBN: 9781009523813\n\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press\n\nPrint publication:\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.
