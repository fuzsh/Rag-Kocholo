        "text": "My DD has got a place for this year. Sheâ€™s also at a super selective. She literally did no revision. Westminster are not looking for the finished article but they are looking for capability. The tests are not tutorable (hence DD did no revision) but it is a full-on process. You know your DD but do give some consideration as to the effect on your DD if she doesnâ€™t succeed. Many parents donâ€™t and get a bit hung up on the kudos of it all. This is a pretty public process if many sit the exam from the same school as they all see each other on the exam day. Sheâ€™ll also need to know for sure which 4 a levels she wants to sit as she will sit exams in those subjects. FYI, the girls who didnâ€™t make the cut after exam day were pretty upset about it all. You donâ€™t need your DD to feel like sheâ€™s â€˜failedâ€™ just before GCSEs.\n\nMusic scholarships are fierce and sometimes itâ€™s not the attainment that clinches the place, but the uniqueness of the instrument. DD is currently a MS but wonâ€™t be at Westminster but is happy enough that there are plenty of opportunities to get involved. Sheâ€™s also relieved to have less pressure to participate in music events that sheâ€™s not really excited about and is hoping itâ€™ll become more fun again. The 10% reduction in fees wouldâ€™ve been nice though ðŸ˜‚\n\nThings I wish Iâ€™d known - your DDâ€™s school will be approached for a reference if she is successful after round 1 (exams) but before round 2 (interviews) so consider that as you are effectively telling the school she might be off but only if she gets a place, otherwise thisâ€™ll have to do Some girls in my DDâ€™s year didnâ€™t get a place post interview. Also, any offer made is conditional on GCSE results, so in the event she bombs, DD may not have a place in any school in September ðŸ™ˆ\n\nLastly, make sure you diarise the opening register dates and submission deadlines. Best of luck to your DD.\n\nMy DD went to Westminster from an all girls London Independent school. Of the 10+ who applied, only 3 got offers. Some extremely able girls didnâ€™t get offers so it was very unclear what the criteria were.\n\nMy DD sat 4 subjects for the entrance exam but when she enrolled in the September, she changed 3 of the 4 subjects. They were absolutely fine about that too.\n\nDonâ€™t underestimate the stress of moving schools for 6th form though. Westminster has a big party element with Saturday night parties taking place all over London as the pupils come from a large surrounding area.\n\nMy DD found it very stressful initially but did thrive in the end. Not all the girls did however, with some finishing their A levels with A and B grades, rather than the expected all A* grades.\n\nNetaporter. That is interesting. I must say I was surprised by how easily she was allowed to switch. Maybe it depends on what subjects they are switching.\n\nI know my DD was told by someone not to sit Further Maths as the entrance exam was considered impossible. However she was allowed to do FM as one of her switches. Perhaps that has been stopped.\n\nShe did sit the Physics entrance exam which she found very difficult. During her physics interview, she sat looking at her marked paper and all she could see were red crosses everywhere. She said it was quite disturbing. She switched physics for Economics when she arrived.\n\nThank you all for your replies, the insights are very helpful.\n\nDD is really drawn by the university style of teaching and musical opportunities. Her younger brother has just been offered a place at Westminster and she picked up the prospectuses of all the schools.\n\nItâ€™s been her wanting to explore other schools.\n\n@Xenia has 6th form at NLCS been better/different to upper school? So many of DD friends are in such a desperately sad situation. Crying, meltdowns, panic attacks, self harm at the back of the classroom . Donâ€™t even get me started on the eating disorders.\n\nIt just seems these girls are under so much pressure to succeed. The hours and hours of homework and endless testing is certainly taking its toll. DD by virtue of friendship and not being so severely unwell as these girls is asked by teachers to support. Sheâ€™s finding it mentally exhausting despite loving NLCS academically.\n\nWeâ€™re just exploring options at the moment and thank you so much for those who have replied.\n\nMbell. Your DDs school sounds very difficult. I know there were a few girls with issues at my DDs all girls school, but nothing on that scale.\n\nMy DD found the jump to Westminster massive. Her previous school really was an exam factory so the change was huge. For History, they were expected to write an essay a week and told to use the library. She found the 1st term very difficult and there were many times I wished she hadnâ€™t moved.\n\nHowever she came through it and thrived but it was touch and go for a while. She did go on to Cambridge and found the transition very easy in comparison so she was well prepared.\n\nAll in all it was a good decision but go in with your eyes open. A couple of friends she made who had moved from SPGS did rather averagely in their A levels in spite of their 11 A* GCSEs.\n\n@mbell that does sound like a lot to deal with. My DD is at another London girls school. Yes there is a lot of crying, anxiety etc but from what I understand issues of self harming/eating disorders/bullying are significantly less prevalent in her school than other schools. I canâ€™t speak for other year groups though. Sheâ€™s very happy there but I think my DD wants a change and the opportunity to mix in a co-Ed setting and leave some of the drama llamas behind. She also visited on a non-open day and thought that the school seemed more focused towards those who want to learn rather than those remaining in the sixth form because they have to and are therefore likely to be disruptive. I note carefully @jeanne16â€™s points about the settling in so fingers crossed!\n\nMy son is lower down the school, so my comments are secondhand as it were so just tossed in as a little warning - it makes me a bit cross if parents of girls who blow up in about October mutter about the challenges of moving to W - those girls didn't turn up without problems. The befriending is tricky isn't it - one wants one's children to be empathetic but on the other hand it must be frustrating to see her emotional band width consumed in that way.\n\nHaving mentioned all that, watching the girls go about their business, they are as a group a very appealing bunch. They seem to instantly absorb the complete scruff vibe of the boys, scuffling around in clumpy shoes and outsized jumpers with nary a trace of obvious make up among them. And they definitely seize the opportunities and hit the ground running. The soloist concerto concert in January had 9 spots and 8 of them were girls. All superb, but as mother of a boy one can't help wondering if it would ever have been viewed as acceptable if the audition gender split had come out the other way. But not an issue for you!"
