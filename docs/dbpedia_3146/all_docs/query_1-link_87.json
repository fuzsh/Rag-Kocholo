        "text": "The admissions office will be offering student-led tours along with the opportunity to chat with admission counselors Monday-Thursday throughout the summer beginning June 10. For those with plans to be in the area, these visits can provide a great introduction to Westminster. Tours are generally available at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. To schedule, please call the admissions office at (860) 408-3060 or email admit@westminster-school.org.\n\nIf you happen to be in the area at a time when our office is not open, you are welcome to drive around campus. The Driving Tour link on this page will provide access to an audio tour, a campus map and some general information.\n\nFor those interested in visiting in the fall, we will begin booking appointments in August. Interviews and tours will be available Monday-Saturday starting Saturday, Sept. 21. Ideally, you should plan to interview before the Jan. 15 application deadline. For planning purposes, please note that we do not interview during our Thanksgiving (Nov. 22-Dec. 2) and winter (Dec. 19-Jan. 6) breaks."
