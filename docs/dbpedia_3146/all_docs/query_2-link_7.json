        "text": "Dear Fellow Alumni,\n\nMy journey to Westminster began 20 years ago when I first made my way through the quiet driveway up to Williams Hill as a nervous and hopeful teenager from Mexico City.\n\nAside from the cherished friendships and formative experiences I gained during my time at Westminster, what remains with me the most is the ethos of “Grit & Grace.” This attitude has guided me through various phases in my life as I’ve moved to different cities and navigated unanticipated challenges and new opportunities. Always proving to be sound and relevant advice, this motto has become an essential part of my personal philosophy.\n\nDuring my recent visits to campus, I’ve been delighted to see many familiar faces and rediscover the unwavering devotion and versatility of our talented faculty. Their commitment continues to be as inspiring as ever and is the core of the Westminster experience. I’m reminded of a quote by William Arthur Ward: “The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.”\n\nCushing Hall and Andrews Memorial Chapel stand proudly at the heart of the campus and have aged gracefully with each passing season, while new buildings continue to enhance the school grounds. As students return to Williams Hill in September, the unwavering constants are their affable and determined spirit and Westminster’s commitment to challenge them across various facets in a distinctively collaborative small-school environment.\n\nI strongly encourage you to visit Westminster. Reconnect with old classmates and faculty and reach out to the incredible Advancement Office to hear about the exciting initiatives and emerging opportunities for incoming Martlets, which you can help support with your time and financial contributions.\n\nWith Grit & Grace,\n\nHarish Dadoo G. ´07\n\nPresident, Alumni Association"
