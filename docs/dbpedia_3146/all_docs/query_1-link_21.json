        "text": "Westminster views residential life as an extension of our core value, community. Beginning in the Third Form year when all Third Formers live together and continuing into the Sixth Form year when our oldest, most mature students live among younger students and act as role models who will shape new students’ first experiences of dorm life, Westminster strives to make a student’s transition from home to dorm life seamless.\n\nThe majority of Westminster faculty lives in dorms among our students. Focusing on one small corridor, but engaging with the entire dorm, faculty open their lives and apartments to students. Corridor supervisors invite students into their apartments for study breaks, birthday celebrations and extra help sessions. They also strive to make weekends more enjoyable by spontaneously buying pizza and wings or offering candy at 11 p.m. check-in.\n\nConversely, just as faculty welcome students in, students gain the feeling of home with the presence of faculty children and many faculty dogs. And, since so many teaching faculty are dorm faculty, students often live down the hall or one floor above their history or English or math teacher or even advisor; asking questions and catching up couldn’t be much easier!"
