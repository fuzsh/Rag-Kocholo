        "text": "(Co-authored with Paul Binski) The aim of this paper is to illuminate the wall and panel paintings in the sanctuary and south transept ofWestminster Abbey by considering their relationship to the ways these spaces were furnished and used. The study of liturgy, inferring behaviour from texts, tends to idealization and does not always take into account human contingencies, that is, what actually happened. In cases such asWestminster’s, the well-documented unruliness of courts reminds us of brute reality. The sedilia in the sanctuary were made in a context that witnessed conditions of actual riot during court ritual. The south transept paintings adorned a complex space used or viewed by monks and layfolk. The murals amplified the relic cults of the church and were part of a viewing situation whose agency depended in part upon access routes and seating of uncertain nature. We take these cases in turn, beginning with seating and images in the south transept. Our contributions are initialled separately.

The usefulness of this image, however, belies the fact that in 1828 the greatest share of the crowds was to be found, not in the Great Room, but in the adjacent School of Painting. Without a picture of this gallery, this paper will attempt to account for its popularity in 1828, and consider how it formed a slightly different type of spectacle to the Great Room, and in so doing encouraged a different manner of spectatorship, and represented an alternative face of British art. Almost exactly half of the pictures in the Great Room were portraits, but Scharf's image reveals that their visual dominance of the space was disproportionate to their number. In 'The central place at the head of the great room', as one critic described it, 1 was Thomas Phillipps' portrait of The Duke of Sussex. Equivalent positions on the adjacent walls are occupied by full lengths depicting Viscount Broom by Henry Pickersgill (on the left) and the Marchioness of Londonderry and her son, Lord Seaham by Sir Thomas Lawrence (on the right). These three picture determined the layout of the rest of their respective walls, each being flanked along the line by further full-lengths and three-quarter length portraits, and framed by smaller half-lengths and heads. Works in other genres are relegated beneath the line, and in the corners of the room. One can imagine the effect of this arrangement upon a spectator .Initial confusion at the irregular grid-pattern created by the tightly-packed frames is relieved when the eye naturally alights upon one of the principal portraits. The gaze drifts left and right to a few picture nearby, and perhaps dips below the line for a moment, before repeating the exercise on another wall. This animation demonstrates the order in which the reporter of the Literary Gazette noticed pictures at the private view. [fig.2] Some spectators no doubt took the time to inspect some of the smaller works less prominently displayed near the floor or elsewhere. Many more, however, crowded around the benches in the centre, turning their heads this way and that to enjoy the accumulated 'mass of splendid portraiture'. 2\n\nThis article considers the collections of painters and the invention of the genre of the gallery picture in Antwerp. It zooms in on gallery paintings from the Francken workshop with details of so-called 'iconoclastic donkeys'. These pictures were a ‘defence of the image’ and must be understood in Antwerp’s Counter Reformation context, in the aftermath of the iconoclastic furies of the sixteenth century. Quintessential to both iconoclasm and the culture of collecting were issues of display and materiality. The paintings of cabinets suggest that some Antwerp artists were defenders of the image in a time when images and other man-made objects were at the forefront of intellectual debate. The gallery paintings can be related to a widespread debate on materiality that, implicitly or explicitly, extended from scholarly publications to workshops and collectors’ rooms. https://doi.org/10.1163/22145966-06501004"
