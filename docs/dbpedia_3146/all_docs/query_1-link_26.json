Situated next to Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament it aims to be fully co-educational by 2030 although no dates have been confirmed. According to The Daily Telegraph a spokesman said: “Although no dates are yet confirmed, we look forward to reaching the point at which we can make this significant change to our school, enabling any child who would flourish here to be able to come, irrespective of gender.\n\nThey added: “Co-education is based on demand – the number of parents, pupils, staff, alumni and interested outsiders asking about girls joining the school has grown year-on-year. It is also based on a desire fully to reflect the community we serve, and to shape that community by educating brilliant young men and women with a commitment to making a difference.”\n\nThe move which will also apply to its junior school, Westminster under School, currently for boys aged seven-13, follows a series of independent schools who have made the change from single sex to co-educational. Westminster School alumni include six former British prime ministers, composer Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, broadcaster Louis Theroux and actress Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nRead More:\n\nThe Guide to Independent Schools Spring 2023 is Out Now!\n\nThe 2023 Spring Prep Schools Edition of Independent School Parent is Out Now!\n\nNominations are Open for the Independent Schools of the Year Awards 2023!\n\nWant more information and inspiration from Independent School Parent?
