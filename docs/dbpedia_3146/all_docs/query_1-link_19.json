        "text": "Advertisements\n\nOur son was wait listed for Westminster for sixth grade. I'm curious if others have had this experience and have insight into what the historical odds are a spot will open up. We are a bit surprised, not that the school isn't competitive but we had what we thought was a relatively strong application.\n\nI'm sure everyone thinks that... But I'm not looking to commiserate just more trying to figure out the game theory of whether its worth waiting past the deadline or if we should take our second choice.\n\nAs an aside I'm quite surprised how little discussion there is on this forum around the subject of private school admissions. Is there somewhere else where this party is going on? Thanks in advance!\n\nThere have been several threads on this, but remember that the vast majority of students in the state are in public school. (Like 90+ percent). In some communities, it may not feel that way though.\n\nI have friends who tell me that this was an especially competitive year, perhaps because the economy is turning around a bit, but more likely because of the mess in DeKalb. Families that weren't considering private got uncomfortable with the large budget cuts there and the big increase in class size was the final straw. Next year, it is expected more DeKalb families will be looking for a way out.\n\nThere was this thread recently...\n\nhttps://www.city-data.com/forum/atlan...-woodward.html\n\nI agree with Lastminutemom. Many families who, up until now, have been very happy at DeKalb schools such as Austin, Vanderlyn, and Montgomery are now jumping ship due to increased class sizes and potential upcoming redistricting. Much more so than in previous years. Although many of those kids are applying to Dunwoody/Sandy Springs private schools, some apply to the \"Buckhead\" privates as well.\n\nRemember that at schools like Westminster, they could fill entire grades with siblings and alumni children alone (although such children are NOT automatically accepted at Westminster). I don't have any particular insight other than to say I hope you have a second choice in mind. Westminster also accepts a good number of kids in 7th grade if you don't make it in this year. Being waitlisted does tell you that they feel your child is a good candidate, so just hang in there!"
