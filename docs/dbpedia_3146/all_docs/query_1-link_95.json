        "text": "Reflections and Advice:\n\n1.) What do you think makes your school unique relative to other boarding schools?\n\nFamily-style dinners bring the community together and are unique to Westminster - twice a week when I was a student - now they do it during lunch.The senior lawn ceremony was special - at the end of the year - current Seniors pull juniors individually onto the lawn as a passing of the torch so to speak.It's a requirement that you work in the kitchen / dish washing room a couple times a month - not sure if they still do that but it builds character in a way.\n\n2.) What was the best thing that happened to you in boarding school?\n\nHard to say. Definitely built character in certain ways - mostly learning to be responsible for your schedule and own success without the overbearing presence of parents.It's really one of those experiences that you don't appreciate or really miss until its over. I can remember getting a pit in my stomach the last few weeks of senior year knowing that it was coming to an end. In fact I'm getting a pit right now just thinking about it. It really was a special & privileged experience.Definitely had a leg up my freshman year of college in terms of being adjusted to living away from home and knowing how to manage my time. One negative would be that I felt so comfortable in the dorm and dorm life and didn't necessarily recognize that others didn't feel the same way.\n\n3.) What might you have done differently during your boarding school experience?\n\nThe only thing would be what colleges I looked at my junior and senior year. Our admissions department strongly urged looking at New England small liberal arts colleges and I'd say a large percentage of Westy graduates attend those types of schools. Many of them obviously loved their experiences but I felt as though Gettysburg was just like Westminster - only slightly bigger. Going to a small boarding school was nice because it was intimate and comfortable - going to a small college felt like more of the same and didn't present me with the opportunity to grow as an individual. I also spent my freshman and sophomore years in a dorm before I transferred (with the possibility of junior and senior being in a dorm as well because the off campus & apt options were assigned by lottery). That was 6 years in a dorm and I was fed up with it.When I transferred to CU it was the best decision I ever made. I got an apartment with a kitchen (huge deal) and ample space and lived with good friends - moved to Denver after I graduated and now work for a Microsoft consulting company. I don't think this would have been possible had I stayed at Gettysburg.Ultimately, the biggest takeaway from my two college experiences is that \"you can make a big school small, but you can't make a small school big.\" I wish someone in admissions had told me that before applying.\n\n4.) What did you like most about your school?\n\nGrit & Grace is a motto that will stick with me for the rest of my life.\n\n5.) Do you have any final words of wisdom for visiting or incoming students to your school?\n\nJust have fun and don't take yourself too seriously.\n\nDorm Life:\n\n1.) Describe the dorm life in your school - what did you like most about it?\n\nThe dorm life was the best. I had some great dorm parents who I distinctly remember to this day. Unfortunately both dorms that I lived in have been torn down since and replaced with new ones. Granted the new ones are state of the art and beautiful - the sentimental value is gone when I visit campus. The best part of the dorms was the late-late night hanging out with friends. We were supposed to be in our rooms by 10pm and have lights out by 10:30pm. Depending on who the teacher on duty was that night they'd generally stop patrolling by 11-11:30pm. At that point we would sneak into each others rooms to hangout and joke around until easily 2 in the morning almost every night. Those were the times that you really bonded with your buddies in the dorm.Every couple of weeks we'd have a \"feed\" where the dorm parent on your hall would invite you into their apartment and feed you all sorts of food. That was always a nice intimate way to get everyone on the floor together and bond with the dorm parent. Some dorm parents were better than others. The best two that I had were Tony Griffith and David Pope. Both were hardos but also kind of softies if you got to know them well enough.The faculty hated it and I don't know if this still happens - but the three boys dorms at the time were all closest to our \"quad\" - which was the massive lawn at the center of campus. Every now and then the seniors would give word of a \"barnyard\" - at midnight all the guys would open their windows and start yelling and screaming and making animal noises - essentially waking up everyone on campus! It was a lot of fun but risky because the dorm parents (especially those with kids) would come running through the halls livid and start busting down doors! We got in a lot of trouble when that happened and they'd take away privileges and punish seniors sometimes but it was always so funny. Seems dumb now but at the time so funny."
