        "text": "The Royal Grammar School Worcester is an independent coeducational school in Worcester, England. Founded before 1291, it is one of the oldest British independent schools. In September 2007, it merged with the neighbouring Alice Ottley School and was briefly known as RGS Worcester and the Alice Ottley School before reverting to its original name, although the School began accepting girls in 2003 prior to the merger. The school now consists of the main senior school and two preparatory campuses known as Springfield and The Grange. Until 1992 it accepted boarders who resided in Whiteladies House, a building that is rumoured to contain hidden treasure from Charles I from when he sought refuge there during the Civil War. It is now a day school. Tracing its origins back to the 600s, the school is the sixth oldest school in the world."
