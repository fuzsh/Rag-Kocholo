Whilst these doctors may feel anxious starting at a new institution, it has been suggested that patients should also be anxious at this time because patients admitted to English hospitals on the August changeover day have a higher early death rate compared to those admitted on the previous Wednesday [1]. Fatal medication errors have similarly been linked to the July changeover in the United States [2]. We wondered if UK changeover dates affect post-operative pain.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Jen M.H, Bottle A, Majeed A, Bell D, Aylin P. Early In-Hospital Mortality following Trainee Doctors’ first day at work. PLoS ONE Sept 2009;4(9): e7103.\n\n2. Phillips D.P., Barker G.E.C. A July spike in fatal medication errors: a possible effect of new medical residents. Journal of General Internal Medicine 2010 Aug; 25(8):774-9\n\nMethods\n\nWe retrospectively analysed the Acute Pain database at University Hospital Lewisham between 01/08/2001 & 12/09/2011. The percentage of patients with moderate to severe pain on movement on day one post-operatively was noted for all patients with an epidural infusion or a patient controlled opioid analgesia (PCA) pump in each of the 10 years for four 30-working-day periods before and after the trainee changeover dates in August and February: Group A=Aug/Sept; B=Nov/Dec; C= Feb/Mar & D= May/June. Median values and 10-90% centile ranges were calculated. Chi-squared statistical analysis was used to compare the groups.\n\nResults\n\nEpidural patients with moderate/severe pain: Total numbers (n),median, (10-90%)centile range for the 10 years in each group: Group A:407, 25% (17-36%). Group B:357, 14%, (10-34%). Group C:329, 22% (10-34%). Group D:476, 17%, (15-32%). Pain scores were worst after the August changeover- A (Chi-squared analysis, P<0.01 compared to B, and P<0.05 compared to D.)\n\nPCA patients with moderate/severe pain: Total numbers (n), median (10-90%)centile range for the 10 years in each group: Group A: 796, 25% (12-34%), Group B: 756, 30% (18-40%), Group C: 689, 29% (12-37%), & Group D: 899, 29% (13-32%): no statistical difference found between groups after Chi-squared analysis.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe proportion of epidural patients with moderate to severe pain seems to be greatest following a changeover period, with the greatest difference seen between A & B and A & D. Such an association was not seen with PCA, which may reflect the decreased complexity of PCA compared to epidural analgesia, which generally involves a simpler protocol common to most hospitals. Our results suggest that patients with epidurals suffer more pain when trainees start new posts. Trainee changeover periods should allow time for adequate induction and competency assessments in local hospital procedures and protocols to maximise good quality pain control.\n\n002\n\nA prospective snapshot audit on pain after sternotomy in children undergoing cardiac surgery in a tertiary level paediatric hospital in 2011\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nSenthil Jayaseelan1, Annette Davis2\n\n1Mersey Deanery, Liverpool, Merseyside, UK, 2Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, Merseyside, UK\n\nBackground\n\nEffective pain management affects morbidity and duration of hospital stay[Dolin SJ et al. BJA 2002]The aim of the audit was to evaluate the incidence of post operative pain in children having sternotomies for various congenital heart diseases.\n\nThere are only a few centres in the United Kingdom which perform paediatric cardiac surgical procedures routinely and the Alderhey Childrens’ hospital at Liverpool is one of them. No patient should return to the ward in uncontrolled pain where problems will escalate. This may be defined as a pain score of 4 or more on a VAS[RCoA(Acute Pain Services)-Raising the Standard: a compendium of audit recipes; American Pain Society Quality of Care Committee, JAMA 1995].There is a good correlation of FLACC with VAS scores as a measure of pain in children[Terri Voeper-Lewis et al. Anesthesia and Analgesia 2002]\n\nAn understanding of the incidence and degree of pain would help to improve the quality of care in these sick children.\n\nMethods\n\nAudit Standards-[Royal College of Anaesthetists-Raising the Standard: a compendium of audit recipes-Acute Pain Services]1.No patient should return to the ward in uncontrolled pain[pain score of 4 or more] 2. Failure of analgesia should be detected within 2 hours and managed effectively 3.100% patients with acute pain should have a completed record of pain scores.\n\nData collection-Data collection was done on an Alderhey audit department approved form over 3 months starting from August 2011 as a prospective audit. All patients intubated greater than 24 hours were excluded. Patients were followed up on Paediatric Intensive Care Unit and subsequently on the ward for a total of 72 hours post operatively. Pain scores were recorded using developmentally appropriate pain scales by nursing staff and they were collected along with the pain management interventions throughout this period.\n\nResults\n\nThe total number of patients after applying the exclusion criteria - 30.\n\nGender-16 females and 14 males.\n\nASA grades- 9[ASA 2], 18[ASA 3], 3[ASA 4]\n\nSurgical prodecures-ASD repair[6],Complete AVSD repair[3], VSD repair[4], Partial AVSD repair[4],Fallots repair[3],Aortic valve repair[3], Mitral valve repair[3], Completion of Fontan’s[2],Rastelli procedure[1], Redo TAPVD[1]\n\nIntraperative analgesia- Opioid infusion in all patients[Fentanyl/Morphine].Ultrasound guided single shot paraveretebral injections were done in 7 out of 30 patients after induction of anaesthesia. 23 patients also received intraoperative paracetamol.\n\nPostoperative analgesia- Morphine/Fentanyl-NCA/PCA as standard in all patients. Other drugs used-IV/Oral paracetamol,codeine, NSAIDs and tramadol alone or in combination.\n\nPain scores: 1st 24 hours=Less than 4[58%], Score of 4 or more[36%], Not recorded[6%]\n\n2nd 24 hours=Less than 4[68%], Score of 4 or more[22%], Not recorded[10%]\n\n3rd 24 hours=Less than 4[65%], Score of 4 or more[16%], Not recorded[19%]\n\n2 cases of chest infection were reported in the 3 month period because of poor pain control.\n\nConclusion\n\nLower pain scores were not achieved in 100% of all paediatric cardiac surgical patients post procedure\n\nPain scores were not documented in 100% of the patients\n\nFailure of analgesia was not detected within 2 hours and managed effectively in all patients\n\nThere was a disconnection between the analgesia received on PICU and what happened in the ward-a decision seems to be made to stop the NCA/PCA without proper establishment of oral analgesia and the patients became distressed.\n\nRecommendation\n\n- Team involvement[ Medical and Nursing staff] in managing pain proactively and effectively with good communication\n\n- Education of all medical and nursing staff\n\n003\n\nEpidural survival rates - a re-audit\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nPayashi Garry2, Sarah Kwok3, Jane Quinlan1\n\n1John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK, 2Milton Keynes General Hospital, Milton Keynes, UK, 3Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, UK\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2008 we performed an audit evaluating the effectiveness of post-operative epidurals following the introduction of patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) in our trust. Factors influencing successful analgesia included use of the correct infusate, use of correct level for epidural positioning and appropriate timing of disconnection. Following the changes implemented as a result of these findings we carried out a study to assess our progress with PCEA. Data collection proved challenging on this occasion due to surgical services now being split over 2 separate sites with major abdominal surgery being performed at both. We also had concerns that post-operative epidural care on the wards had deteriorated since the segregation of emergency and elective abdominal surgery. The split site services meant that the pain team was more stretched by covering more wards, while also having to educate more junior doctors and ward nurses.\n\nMethods\n\nWe conducted a prospective observational audit from June 2010 to February 2011 of 62 patients at the Churchill and John Radcliffe Hospitals who received post operative epidural analgesia. We investigated the number of attempts at insertion, the level of insertion, the surgical procedure and PCEA solution used. We also recorded when the infusate was started and whether this had impact on overall analgesic effect. Analgesia and side effects were assessed in recovery and on the ward each day post operatively by the inpatient pain team until the epidural was discontinued. Reasons for epidural discontinuation were also assessed to identify any inappropriate early cessation of the technique. We were then able to compare our current data with that from our previous audit to assess any change in practice.\n\nResults\n\nOur results show that 79% of patients received good analgesia upon arrival in recovery which, after rescue techniques, then rose to 91% on day 1. By day 2 this dropped to 68%. We believe this was because our sample group was small secondary to difficulties auditing across two sites and not due to fewer epidurals being performed. The vast majority of patients received the Trust’s standard prescription (0.1% bupivacaine with 5mcg/ml fentanyl). Eight patients experienced side effects on the ward including pruritus and motor block.\n\nThe accidental disconnection rate was 0%, an improvement from 12% found in the previous study. This may be due to the change in epidural sets being used. The most common intervention for a poorly working epidural was to increase the rate at which the infusate was running.\n\nFor major surgery, epidural infusions were run for up to 4 days post operatively.\n\nConclusion\n\nPCEA remains a successful technique in our trust, and advice from the specialist pain service is sought and followed in most cases. However, with a smaller data set, we cannot make broad conclusions, but rather examine a sub-set of our patients. It appears difficult to audit split site services and greater encouragement of our anaesthetic colleagues is necessary in order to gather information and gain sufficient insight into our epidural performance. Interventions in recovery are a poor prognostic sign. Further education of surgical junior doctors and nursing staff is required to manage ward epidurals more effectively.\n\n004\n\nThe impact of introducing a Trust-wide Pain Care Pathway for adult inpatients\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nKarin Cannons, Wendy Jardine\n\nFrimley Park Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Camberley, Surrey, UK\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2010 a Trust-wide care indicator compliance audit showed that, in some clinical areas, pain assessment was poorly done and documentation concerning analgesic efficacy was hard to locate or absent. Our aim was to improve documentation of analgesic efficacy, whilst also providing a prompt/educational resource to promote pain assessment and ensure safe high quality pain management. The Pain Care Pathway introduced by the Inpatient Pain Team, in collaboration with the Professional Development Team, was an A4 booklet whose front page contained information about pain assessment and actions to be taken based on that assessment. The subsequent 3 pages facilitated the documentation of care given by each bedside nurse on every shift including: analgesic efficacy, involvement of the Inpatient Pain or Palliative Care Team, and space to comment on the location of any pain with reasons for actions taken or not taken.\n\nMethods\n\nA monthly audit was performed by senior nurses across the Trust in all clinical areas using a series of questions about 10 key care indicators, including pain. 5 patients from each area were sampled. Each patient who reported pain was asked: ‘Do you think the staff did all that they could to control your pain?’ Documentation was then audited to ascertain if:\n\nPain status assessed on admission\n\nPain scores recorded with each set of clinical observations\n\nA Trust care plan evident for a patient requiring analgesia\n\nPatient reassessed when required\n\nEfficacy recorded for any analgesia administered\n\nThe answers were scored and collated into a matrix. The results from all clinical areas were then combined to provide a Care Indicator Compliance score for the Trust. Scores of 90% or over were considered ‘acceptable’/’green’; 75 to 89% ‘of concern’/’amber’; and 74% and below ‘unacceptable’/’red’.\n\nResults\n\nThe Care Indicator Compliance score for pain in July 2010 was 75%. The pathway was piloted in August in the medical directorate (September score 83%), piloted in the surgical directorate in October (November score 85%) and launched Trust wide in December (January 2011 score 88%). By April 2011 (score 94%) the pathway was fully embedded and the December 2011 score was 97%. An audit of nursing staff opinion showed our staff welcomed the introduction of the tool, commenting that it served as an excellent summary of information required to ensure patient comfort and safe analgesic administration. Nurses used the pathway to structure their contact with medical staff to obtain analgesic prescriptions for patients with discomfort. The centralised contact information for the Inpatient Pain Team and Palliative Care Team facilitated staff obtaining support with complex problems, side effect management, or ongoing discomfort issues.\n\nConclusion\n\nPain is experienced by most hospital patients during their patient journey. Pain assessment is the means by which pain is discovered and treated. Many of the medications given for pain, such as opioids, have side effects which may present a risk to patient safety. It is essential that the effects of such medication are observed and recorded. The pathway empowered staff to continue to monitor the effects of analgesia once it had been correctly given. The ongoing presence of the pathway in every patient’s documentation ensures we are asking all patients about their pain, taking action and monitoring the effects.\n\n005\n\nAcute post-operative pain after caesarean section\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nCatherine Warnaby1, Nicola Beale2, Olga Kciuk1, Nicola Brooks1, Robin Russell2, Irene Tracey1, Jane Quinlan1,2\n\n1Pain Imaging Neuroscience Group and FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK, 2Nuffield Division of Anaesthesia, Oxford University Hospitals, Oxford, UK\n\nBackground\n\nChronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) lasting for more than 3 months is well recognized and the incidence after caesarean section (CS) has been found to be 10-18%. Previous retrospective studies have shown that severe pain in the first week after surgery is a predictor of chronicity, but this may be confounded by recall bias. The Oxford Persisting Post-Operative Pain Study (OxPPOPS) is a prospective, longitudinal study to investigate the incidence of CPSP up to one year after surgery and identify predictive factors for its development. Among the factors under investigation are pre-operative psychology, surgical and anaesthetic techniques, acute post-operative pain, analgesic management and sleep. Early identification of at-risk individuals may enable the development of interventions to prevent conversion from acute to CPSP. We present early data from the OxPPOPS CS cohort detailing the trajectory of acute post-operative pain in the first month.\n\nMethods\n\n50 women (aged 18-45 years) undergoing planned CS after 34 weeks gestation were recruited. Women with pre-pregnancy painful or psychiatric conditions were excluded. Women were seen on the ward at 6h and 2 days after surgery, and were followed up by telephone interview at 7 and 30(±2) days post-operatively. Verbal and numerical (0-10) pain ratings at rest and on movement, information on the site of the pain and analgesia requirements were recorded at all time-points. Additionally, the ward/telephone interviews also contained the McGill Pain questionnaire, pain exacerbating verbal\n\ndescriptors, and a modified Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire.\n\nResults\n\nUsing verbal descriptors, the frequency of women reporting pain at rest at 6h, day 2, day 7 and day 30 were 79, 65, 42 and 9% respectively. More women reported pain on movement with frequencies of 95, 100, 82 and 36% at the same time-points. At all time-points the numerical ratings on movement were significantly higher than at rest (all – p<0.0001). The severity of pain peaked at day 2 on movement: median (interquartile range) = 4(4). After day 2, the only two verbal reports of severe pain occurred on movement in two patients on day 7. At day 30, 6 of 50 women (12%) reported pain on movement of greater than 3/10, with 2 women also having pain at rest. Of these 6 women, the pain was located either in the wound (n=3), the wound and back (n=2), or the abdomen (n=1), for which 3 were taking simple analgesia.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe frequency and severity of pain at 6 hours is lower than day 2, potentially due to the residual effects of anaesthesia. Throughout the acute post-operative period, a distinction was found between pain at rest and on movement. Furthermore, we have identified outliers with elevated pain levels on movement in the acute post-operative period with an incidence consistent with previously reported CPSP after CS. Long-term planned follow up of the women in the CS cohort will reveal if the outliers do go on to develop CPSP, and whether pain on movement is a better predictor than pain at rest.\n\n006\n\nWound infiltration catheters as part of our Enhanced Recovery After Colorectal Surgery program at Salford Royal Foundation Trust - do they make a difference? Our initial experience\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nZara Townley, Rachel Meskell, Marie Murphy\n\nSalford Royal Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK\n\nBackground\n\nEnhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) has become popular in a variety of surgical fields and wound infiltration catheters have been used as part of a multi modal analgesic approach in many enhanced recovery programmes. A recent systemic review by Liu et al demonstrated that wound infiltration catheters consistently reduced requirement for post op opioids and a reduction in post operative nausea and vomiting. They also showed that the catheters also reduced length of hospital stay with overall cost savings.\n\nRectus sheath catheters are commonly used for both open and laparoscopic colorectal procedures. As well as an initial bolus injection at the end of the surgery the placement of a catheter allows a continuous infusion which can be titrated according to the patient’s analgesic requirements.\n\nWound infiltration catheters were introduced at Salford Royal Foundation Trust in Nov 2010 as part of the enhanced recovery programme for lower GI surgery.\n\nMethods\n\nThe aim of this study was to audit our first cohort of colorectal surgical patients to have wound infiltration catheters as part of their perioperative management looking specifically at their lengths of stay, post operative morbidity and also PCA usage. Since the wound infiltration catheters were introduced our Enhanced Recovery Nurse Practitioner has collected data for each patient - she was able to provide data for 22 patients who had wound infiltration catheters sited and 20 patients who did not. Further information about each patient and their surgery was obtained from the hospital database. The PCA usage for each patient was then obtained from one of our pharmacists. This data was then analysed and the two groups compared. We used Liu’s results as our standard.\n\nResults\n\nThis study was able to demonstrate a shorter length of stay for the wound catheter group, although not statistically significant. However there was no difference in the post operative nausea and vomiting rates nor ileus rates and in fact the wound catheter group had slightly higher rates although again not statistically significant.\n\nThe wound catheter group also had a higher mean PCA use than the non catheter group but again not statistically significant.\n\nThere was no significant morbidity associated with the catheters themselves, however, one catheter snapped on removal from the patient.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere may be a number of explanations for these results and although the lengths of stay results are encouraging, the other results are less so and certainly our early experience of wound infiltration catheters does not match that of Liu et al. After discussion at the ERAS steering group meeting it was decided that wound infiltration catheters should continue to be used but in order to get a larger cohort of patients further data collection was required which would hopefully allow us to see some significant differences and make some comparison between different surgical procedures.\n\n007\n\nFractured neck of femur analgesic bundle: reducing time to mobilisation post-operatively\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nIngrid Seatter, Keir McIlmoyle, Ewan Jack\n\nNHS Forth Valley, Forth Valley, UK\n\nBackground\n\nPain during the peri-operative period continues to be a major contributing factor towards morbidity and mortality in patients presenting with a fractured neck of femur (NOF). This patient group is often frail and elderly, and uncontrolled pain is an undue source of physiological and psychological stress. A recent randomised controlled trial showed that inadequate pain control increases the incidence of pneumonia, increases delirium and reduces time to mobilisation. Furthermore, recently published NICE guidelines on the management of hip fracture in adults highlight the need for a multi-system approach to pain relief, combining both regional and systemic analgesic techniques.\n\nAfter feedback from the multi-disciplinary team and initial data collection in our unit, it was apparent that pain relief in this patient group was being managed sub-optimally, causing a delayed time to mobilisation and potential adverse effect on patient outcome.\n\nMethods\n\nThe aim of our audit was to introduce a departmental analgesic bundle for all patients undergoing surgical repair of a fractured NOF. We speculated that introduction of the bundle would increase the number of patients receiving appropriate analgesia post-operatively, improve patients’ subjective pain scores and reduce the time to mobilisation.\n\nThe bundle highlighted four analgesic steps to be included. The steps were as follows:\n\nRegional technique peri-operatively (neuraxial +/- regional block).\n\nRegular oral or intravenous paracetamol.\n\nRegular weak opiate (tramadol or dihydrocodeine recommended).\n\nAs required weak or strong opiate.\n\nData was collected over an eight month period (total 210 patients) after the analgesic bundle was initiated. Two patients were excluded due to severe cognitive dysfunction. Data collected included compliance with each step of the bundle and two measured outcomes: maximum documented pain score during the first 24 hours post-operatively and the time to mobilisation.\n\nResults\n\nFollowing the implementation of the analgesic bundle, the compliance with each step has increased. The number of patients receiving a regional block during their peri-operative management has increased by 19% and the percentage of patients receiving regular paracetamol has remained between 96-100%. Those receiving regular weak opiates and breakthrough analgesia have increased by 31% and 15 %, respectively. Resultantly, the percentage of patients complying with all four steps of the analgesic ladder has risen by 39% since introduction of the protocol.\n\nThe measured outcomes of maximum documented pain score in the first 24 hours and time to mobilisation have also improved. The percentage of patients mobilised on day one post-operatively has now risen by 42%, to 87% of patients. Additionally, 79% of patients now report nil or mild pain in comparison to 45% prior to implementation of the bundle.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy introducing an analgesic bundle, the number of patients prescribed appropriate analgesia has increased with a resultant improvement in pain control and reduced immobility post-operatively. This high risk patient group is known to have a mortality of approximately 5-10% at one month. Evidence would suggest that by reducing the time to mobilisation and improving pain control this may result in a reduction in morbidity, including the incidence of pneumonia and delirium. Data collection continues and we have now broadened the measured outcomes to include the incidence of delirium and the potential correlation with improved pain control.\n\n008\n\nComparison of pain intensity in the first and second eyes during simultaneous bilateral lasik surgery\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nDmitry Yakunchikov1, Paul Dougherty2, Harkaran Bains3, Gurpreet Sidhu4\n\n1HealthPointe Medical Centre, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, 2Dougherty Laser Vision Institute, Camarillo, California, USA, 3CEROC, Paris, France, 4Alberta Health Services, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada\n\nBackground\n\nLaser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of refractive error. Intraoperative pain is frequently associated with LASIK, especially during application of the suction ring and translation of the microkeratome across the cornea to create the corneal flap. One of the authors of this study (PJD) observed anecdotally that patients noted greater pain in the second eyes compared with the first eyes during simultaneous bilateral LASIK surgery with a mechanical microkeratome. This study was designed to assess the occurrence of this phenomenon.\n\nMethods\n\nA prospective study was performed on 26 consecutive patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral LASIK (B&L Hansatome microkeratome/VISX Laser) by one surgeon (PJD). Immediately postoperatively, the subjects were asked to rate intraoperative pain in each eye on the numerical scale graded from 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain). The paired t-test was used to compare the mean pain score in each eye. P lower than 0.05 was statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nThe majority of the study cohort rated pain in their second eye as greater. The mean intraoperative pain score of 2.31 +/- 1.68 in the second eye was significantly higher (P lower than 0.05) than the mean intraoperative pain score of 1.36 +/- 1.41 in the first eye.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe incidence of increased pain intensity in the second eye during simultaneous bilateral LASIK surgery is high. The underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon are likely multifactorial and may involve such centrally mediated effects as anxiety-induced hyperalgesia, mirror-image mechanical allodynia and contralateral descending pain facilitation.\n\n009\n\nMapping of central changes, using continuous arterial spin labelling, induced by post-surgical pain after third molar surgery before and after paracetamol infusion\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nNadine Khawaja1,2, Matthew Howard1, Steven Williams1, Tara Renton2\n\n1Centre for Neuroimaging Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London, London, UK, 2Oral Surgery Department, King’s College Dental Institute, London, UK\n\nBackground\n\nContinuous arterial spin labelling (cASL), a perfusion MRI technique, provides quantitative measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) throughout the brain. Previously we demonstrated the sensitivity of the technique to represent acute ongoing post-surgical pain. Here we intended to assess the sensitivity of cASL to represent changes in rCBF associated with a reduction in pain following administration of an analgesic. Intravenous paracetamol is one of the most commonly used analgesics in general surgery. However, its mechanism of action is not fully understood. This study examines the cerebral representation of paracetamol infusion resulting in attenuation of pain following third molar surgery (TMS).\n\nMethods\n\nPrior to and following TMS, 15 right handed males underwent a series of cASL scans during which they received saline and paracetamol infusions. VAS estimates of pain intensity were provided by participants during scanning.\n\nResults\n\nThere was a marked reduction in pain scores following paracetamol infusion from 8/10 to 0.5/10. Preliminary results indicate that cASL detects a differential effect of intravenous paracetamol on pain following TMS. This is reflected by changes in rCBF between the saline and paracetamol infusions in brain regions including the anterior cingulate, somatosensory and insula cortices, and brainstem.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe provide early indications demonstrating that cASL is a sensitive marker for pharmacological modulation of brain activity as a result of attenuation of pain. This study provides scope for developing this technique as a pain biomarker in the development of novel analgesics. This study was funded by the Mildred B Clulow Award from the British Pain Society.\n\n010\n\nA survey of postoperative pain in a major hospital in Gaza: an initial step in a structured approach to the improvement of postoperative pain management\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nRami Hamden1, Gehad Al Gaeedy1, Katherine Chatten1,2, Atef Al-Tawafsheh1,2, Basil Almahdi1,2, Jeanne Frossard1,2, John Beavis1,3, Brigitta Brandner1,2\n\n1Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza city, Occupied Palestinian Territory, 2University College London Hospitals Trust, London, UK, 3International Disaster and Emergency Aid with Longterm Support, Kent, UK\n\nBackground\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has identified that the provision of pain relief with standardized policies is important in delivering an emergency and essential surgical service. Through collaboration with IDEALS (International Disaster and Emergency Aid with Longterm Support), SPIN (Specialists in Pain International Network), Al Quds Foundation for Medical Schools in Palestine, MAP (Medical Aid for Palestine) and UCLH ( University College London Hospital), it was possible to initiate a project at Al-Shifa Hospital, a major teaching hospital in Gaza, aiming to improve postoperative pain management. The initial step was to identify an anaesthetist and nurse to lead the project locally. The project uses a stepwise approach to the introduction of pain management tools, adapted from a UK based study (Gould 1992). This survey was designed to ascertain the adequacy of current postoperative pain management prior to the introduction of protocols for pain assessment and analgesic prescribing.\n\nMethods\n\nThe survey was created as a simple tool to be administered within the first 24 hours postoperatively at Al-Shifa Hospital. Patients were asked to rate their pain on an 11 point numerical rating scale (0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine) over the following time periods:\n\nWorst pain in the past 24 hours\n\nLeast pain in the past 24 hours\n\nAverage pain in the past 24 hours\n\nPain right now\n\nPatients were given the questions to read and circled their answers. The questions were written in English and Arabic. Participants unable to read or write for any reason were asked the questions verbatim and their answers were recorded by the anaesthetist completing the survey. Analgesia prescribed and received in the first 24 hours was documented. Data recorded were entered into a database and analysed using Excel.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 196 patients answered the survey over a two month period. Surgery included both elective and emergency operations. Operations were classified as General / Vascular (57%), Orthopaedic (16%), Obstetric (14%), Cardiac (5%), ENT (3%), Gynaecology (2%) and other (Plastics, Urology, Neurosurgery - totaling 3%).\n\nMedian pain scores were as follows:\n\nWorst pain in the past 24 hours: 8\n\nLeast pain in the past 24 hours: 3\n\nAverage pain in the past 24 hours: 5\n\nPain right now: 2\n\nPatients most commonly received diclofenac (75%) and tramadol (22.5%) intramuscularly. Morphine or pethidine were prescribed to be given in 9.2% as a rescue analgesic. Paracetamol was rarely given (1%), although available. The majority of patients did not receive all that they were prescribed.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis survey suggests that postoperative pain management at Al-Shifa Hospital can be improved. There are currently no formal hospital guidelines or protocols in place governing the frequency or type of assessments of postoperative pain. The intention is to introduce a pain assessment tool and an appropriate “pain ladder” to guide the systematic treatment of postoperative pain with available resources. Support and education to facilitate the introduction of this program is taking place with the Acute Pain Service at UCLH. This survey will be repeated in 6 months time to assess the impact of these changes.\n\n011\n\nThe quality of pain scoring and analgesic prescribing in medical inpatients: cause for concern?\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nGraham Simpson, Mark Rockett\n\nPlymouth Pain Management Centre, Plymouth, UK\n\nBackground\n\nThe prevalence and severity of pain suffered by medical inpatients is similar to that experienced by surgical inpatients. However we present evidence that the quality of pain management differs significantly between these two groups, despite the existence of evidence-based guidelines. In a recent national survey of acute pain service leads, 82% of respondents felt that pain management on medical wards was inadequate. Despite this, only 16% of UK hospitals have an acute pain service providing regular input into medical wards. The cornerstone of effective pain management is accurate pain assessment. In the study hospital, pain is recorded as the 5th vital sign, using a nominal verbal rating scale (VRS) of none, mild, moderate and severe. Moderate and severe pain is considered significant and requires treatment. We compared the quality of pain scoring and prescribing practice between medical and surgical inpatients, in a UK Teaching Hospital.\n\nMethods\n\nAll medical and surgical inpatients were asked to rate their worst pain in the last 24 hours using a four point VRS. Those with moderate or severe pain were invited to take part. Pain scores recorded on the participants’ observation chart within the last 24 hours were transcribed to the case report form (CRF), together with their self-assessed scores. Data were also collected from the participants’ inpatient drug charts and transcribed to the CRF prior to analysis.\n\nResults\n\nThe prevalence of significant pain in medical inpatients (n=388) (M) and surgical inpatients (n=335) (S) was 19.9% and 16.7%. All group S patients had at least two appropriate analgesics prescribed. Of the group M patients, 35% had no regular analgesia prescribed and 38% were prescribed paracetamol only. Prescribing: Paracetamol (regularly S 97% v M 59%, as required S 0% v M 24%); Weak opiates (regularly S 24% v M 18%, as required S 23% v M 18%); Strong opiates (regularly S 5% v M 27%, as required S 68% v M 37%); Adjuvants (S 18% v M 18%). Overall group S received 94% of analgesic medications as prescribed, compared to 75% of group M. Assessment: Group M was commonly assessed as being pain free (M 47.2% v S 8.3%), having no pain assessment recorded (M 14.7% v S 5.5%), and having an incorrect pain score (M 80.6% v S 64%).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe data revealed that pain management for medical inpatients with significant pain was suboptimal. Pain scoring was frequently absent or inaccurate and prescribing practices did not follow local guidelines. Without the specialist skills of an acute pain service to provide adequate training and staff updates, the quality if pain scoring is poor. Subsequent to this audit, the nurse led acute surgical pain service has been replaced by a multi-disciplinary acute care team (ACT). The ACT is responsible for supporting every hospital ward, including medical inpatients. Audit will be undertaken to identify the impact of this new model on pain management.\n\n012\n\nAudit of inpatient pain referrals and development of an inpatient referral pathway for inpatient pain management\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nRavi Kare, Suchitra Kanagasundaram, Tracy Taylor, Arun Seghal\n\nPeterborough City Hospital, Peterborough, UK\n\nBackground\n\nIt has now been clearly demonstrated that pain is similar in prevalence and severity in medical and surgical patients (1). However its assessment and management in the non-surgical setting is often neglected (2). Peterborough City Hospital is a district general hospital for a population of about 300,000. The Acute Pain Service (APS) was established in 1999 primarily to improve pain following surgery. The acute pain service also received referrals for pain management in nonsurgical patients. A three-month audit of these referrals in 2008 revealed that referral pathway was sporadic and involved two systems. This resulted in confusion amongst referrers and delays in treatment.\n\nIn September 2010, the APS devised a referral pathway for pain management using an IT based referral system and made the referrals more accessible for clinicians and nursing staff.\n\nWe conducted a prospective audit of the inpatient pain referrals following this change to the referral pathway.\n\nMethods\n\nAn audit of all inpatient pain referrals to the acute pain service using this new pathway was conducted over a period of 3 months from October 2011 to December 2011. All post surgical patients were excluded from this audit. The following information was collected prospectively using patient notes and self report; Patient demographics, referring specialty, presenting pain symptom, route of hospital entry, treatment offered by the acute pain service and follow up arrangements were prospectively recorded using a preformat. This information was compared with the information collected in 2008 prior to the establishment of this formal referral pathway.\n\nResults\n\nThe comparison of data from 2011 showed that in addition to the routine postoperative work there was a 6-fold increase in number of referrals to the acute pain service. Of the referrals 55 (63 %) were from Medical specialties while the rest 31(36%) were from surgical specialties. Of the 86 referrals, the Inpatient pain team intervened in management of 72 patients, using a combination of medication changes and therapeutic spinal injections.\n\nFurther analysis of the patients who were admitted under the medical team showed that the most frequent presenting pain symptom was back pain (30%) followed by leg pain (24%) and abdominal pain (24%).\n\nAn unexpected finding was that the majority (75%) of the patients referred to the acute pain service were self-referrals via the A&E as apposed to GP referrals.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis audit shows that there was a six-fold increase in referrals to the acute pain service following the introduction of a formal referral pathway. The additional fact that 63% of these referrals were from the medical speciality suggests that pain was previously under reported in this speciality.\n\nThis audit confirmed the need, and provided the evidence to support and develop further the provision of pain management to patients from non-surgical specialities at our hospital.\n\n013\n\nDo postoperative patients receive laxatives with prescribed opioids following major orthopaedic, gynaecology and colorectal surgery during hospital admission?\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nDonald Graham, Ashok Elayaperumal\n\nDoncaster Royal Infirmary, Doncaster, UK\n\nBackground\n\nStrong opioids are frequently used for severe pain management but adverse effects are common. Opioid induced constipation (OIC) affects up to 90% of opioid-treated patients and is due to opioid receptor activation slowing propulsive peristalsis. Clinical tolerance does not develop. Consensus guidelines advocate a combination of stimulant and softener. Post-operative pain management frequently involves using strong-moderate opioids (by a variety of routes) in combination with co-analgesics. In our institution, initial post-operative opioids are principally prescribed in theatre by anaesthetic staff using our E-prescribing system (JAC). Likewise, ward staff may further prescribe on the same system. Currently, a subsection within this system contains a ‘pain’ section with pre-written analgesic prescriptions, but no similar system for laxatives. There is no benchmark by which to compare and match laxative prescribing with opioids for post-operative pain management. We analyzed prescribing patterns for opioids and laxatives using the e-prescribing system.\n\nMethods\n\nE-prescribing offers error free, accurate and understandable prescriptions from the healthcare provider to patient. In addition, through the enquiry icon (POENQ) prescribing for previous admissions is available for analysis. Over a similar period, patients admitted for elective major gynaecology (e.g. T.A.H.), lower limb arthroplasty (e.g. T.H.J.R.) and colorectal surgery (e.g. laparoscopic and open bowel surgery) were studied. Approximately 150 patients (equally divided between each group) prescription patterns were analyzed during surgical admission for all analgesics and laxatives. We applied a PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act) strategy to plan implementation of change to current practice. This Quality and Service Improvement Tool tests an idea and assesses its impact. This study analyzed current laxative prescribing for when patients are prescribed any moderate-strong opioid for post-operative pain management. The aim is to introduce a pre-written prescription of stimulant and stool softener for non-bowel surgery and Targinact (oxycodone/naloxone) for bowel surgery and re-evaluate.\n\nResults\n\nData was collected for 144 patients (gynaecology 49, orthopaedics 48, colorectal 47). Demography: gynaecology (mean age 64), orthopaedic (mean age 65, male/female 45%/55%), colorectal (mean age 65, male/female 50%).\n\nOpioids prescribed include codeine, tramadol, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl and buprenorphine patch. Routes of opioid delivery include intravenous, oral, subcutaneous, epidural and transdermal. Laxatives include senna, lactulose, movicol and oxycodone/naloxone combination (Targinact).\n\nTable of results:\n\n% strong/moderate opioids prescribed as an in-patient\n\n% laxative prescribed as an in-patient\n\nIn hospital % simultaneous prescribing of laxatives/opioids\n\nGynaecology N = 48\n\n77 (37/48)\n\n37 (18/48)\n\n27(13/48)\n\nOrthopaedics N = 49\n\n94 (46/49)\n\n49 (24/49)\n\n47 (23/49)\n\nColorectal N = 47\n\n95 (45/47)\n\n8(4/47)\n\n6 (3/47)\n\nConclusion\n\nStrong/moderate opioids are frequently prescribed following major surgery. The incidence of G.I.-related side-effects is common and dose dependent. Laxative prescribing for gynaecology (37%) and orthopaedic (49%) patients is low despite opioid prescribing and the population age. Women routinely report more constipation than men. By convention, laxatives are avoided following colorectal surgery to avoid anastamotic complications. Simultaneous prescribing is < 50% in all groups. This may reflect the need for improved drug awareness and prescribing education by all prescribers (medical/nursing) for all patient groups. Future studies will analyze the introduction of pre-written laxative/Targinact e-prescriptions on prescribing behaviour in the future.\n\n014\n\nContinuous local anaesthetic wound infiltration in latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction after mastectomy\n\nCategory: Acute Pain\n\nCarole Jellicoe2, Venkat Harriharan2, Kian Chin2, Helen Lawrence1\n\n1Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK, 2Oxford University, Oxford, UK\n\nBackground\n\nSurgically placed wound infusion catheters (SPWIC) provide excellent postoperative analgesia for a variety of surgical procedures. Little is published about their use in oncoplastic breast surgery. We report the use of surgically placed wound catheters in women undergoing mastectomy with immediate and delayed lattissimus dorsi flap reconstruction.\n\nMethods\n\nWe performed a retrospective review of 10 patients with surgically placed wound infusion catheters (SPWIC). 10 patients in whom SPWIC were not used acted as a control group. One Surgeon (KC) performed all surgery, with electrical diathermy and 3 surgical drains. A single SPWIC (ON-Q Pain Buster, Kimberley-Clark) was inserted in the subdermal layer of the mastectomy wound, with a Twin SPWIC inserted in the donor site. Catheters were primed with 30ml 0.25% Bupivacaine. Elastomeric pumps infused 0.25%Bupivacaine (n=8) or 0.125% Bupivacaine (n=2) at a combined rate of 9ml/hr for 48 hours postoperatively. Pain scores, analgesic requirements and length of hospital stay were reviewed.\n\nResults\n\nThere were no complications associated with surgically placed infusion catheters. A trend towards reduced overall pain scores in the study group was noticed. Mean Morphine usage in the study group was 2.4mg (0 -10mg) compared to 45.5mg (0-100mg) in the controls. Mean hospital stay was 5.4 days in the study group and 6.4 days in the controls.\n\nConclusion\n\nSurgically placed wound infiltration catheters provided good postoperative analgesia for latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction after mastectomy, with reduced Morphine requirements. They are simple to use, with anecdotal reports of high patient satisfaction in our study. A trend towards shorter hospital stay is noteworthy. A large, prospective study is needed to further evaluate surgically placed would infiltration catheters in this field.\n\nAssessment & Measurement\n\n0015\n\nCurrent practice for managing pain from the perspectives of GPs, Primary care teams and Pain Clinics in older adults throughout the UK\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nGeraldine Anthony1, Patricia Schofield5, Denis Martin2, Derek Jones3, Denise Gray1, Amanda Clarke2, Blair Smith4, Paul McNamee1\n\n1Aberdeen University, Aberdeen Scotland, UK, 2Northumbria University, England, UK, 3Teeside University, Teeside England, UK, 4Dundee University, Dundee Scotland, UK, 5Greenwich University, England, UK\n\nBackground\n\nPain is common: the one month population prevalence of pain, in persons aged 18-65 years in the UK, has shown to range from around 8% in the abdomen in the abdomen to 28% in the low back pain area. In older persons, the occurrence of pain-especially disabling pain and /or pain at multiple sites-is a particularly important problem since it threatens the independent functioning & functional self -efficacy. Older patients themselves often have a strong desire to be a “good patient” one who does not complain, who accepts pain & the lack of treatment as normal. It has been shown that older adults rarely referred to pain management programmes.\n\nMethods\n\nA survey using semi-structured telephone interviews with practitioners working in pain clinics.\n\nResults\n\nResponse rate 60.65(95.2%). Respondents included: nurse specialists 12(20%); consultant anaesthetists 11(18.3%), GPs 11(18.3%), Consultant Clinical psychologists 7(12.7%); Physiotherapists 5(8.3%); Occupational therapists 1(2); Chiropractor 1(2%); Instructor for pain management one (2%); head of physiological services one (2%) and one (2%) was a Medical director. Current practice for treating pain was the British Pain Society and NICE guidance, prescribing pain relief- majority no specific guidelines - a mixture of clinical experience and the British pain Society and NICE gridlines. Information leaflets - no different from information leaflets given to the normal population & most had designed their own leaflets on “patient centred care”. Frequencies of reviews- were inadequate &varied from patient to patient as often as weekly for complex cases. Most done face-to face and if patient stable by a follow up phone call. Pain assessment tools -British Pain inventory, visual analogue scale, numerical pain rating scale and hospital a anxiety and depression scale.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn general pain clinicians did provide a good level of service for older adults. However, this study highlights varied use of guidance on prescribing in older adults as well as scope for developing information leaflets for this population. The frequencies of reviews were identified as inadequate for this group.\n\n0016\n\nCost-effectiveness of self-management of chronic pain in older adults: a systematic review\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nGeraldine Anthony1, Dwayne Boyers1, Paul Mc Namee1, Patricia Schofield2, Denis Martin3, Amanda Clarke4, Blair Smith5, Derek Jones4\n\n1Aberdeen University, Aberdeen Scotland, UK, 2Greenwich University, England, UK, 3Teeside University, England, UK, 4Northumbria University, England, UK, 5Dundee University, Dundee Scotland, UK\n\nBackground\n\nIt is estimated that chronic pain accounts for £4.6 million. GP appointments each year in the UK, at a cost of £69 million. Back pain alone, the most common form of chronic pain, is estimated to cost the UK economy £12.3 billion annually in direct costs. It is often argued that self -management is a potentially cheaper form of pain management than alternative approaches, and may be at least as effective and cost-saving relative to interventions delivered by health care professionals. However, research evidence supporting these arguments is lacking.\n\nAim\n\nTo assess the cost-effectiveness of self-management strategies for older people suffering from chronic pain.\n\nMethods\n\nSystematic review of published randomised controlled trials (RCT) of self-management strategies amongst older people (aged 65 years or over, or mean age 60 years or over) with cost-effectiveness data and at least 6 months follow -up, up to December 2010.\n\nResults\n\nNo RCT studies reported cost-effectiveness of self-management exclusively in the 65 years or over age group. Ten RCTs reported participants with an average age of 60 years or over, and met all other inclusion criteria. All of these studies measured cost-effectiveness as cost per improvement in primary outcome, seven of them using the Western Ontario and McMaster universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) pain score. Six studies reported Cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gain information, although statistically significant QALY gains (gain=0.01) relative to usual care were found in only one study.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is evidence that self -management is an effective method of alleviating pain among older people with chronic pain sufferers alleviating pain among older people with chronic pain sufferers, as measured by pain-specific outcome measures such as the WOMAC. However, it is not possible to conclude from current evidence that self-management is cost-effective based on QALY outcomes. Due to lack of data amongst older populations (e.g those aged 65 years or over), there is also a need for further high quality randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a variety of potential self-management strategies amongst older age groups.\n\n017\n\nRelationship between pre-operative pain thresholds and long-term pain after knee replacement: a pilot study\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nVikki Wylde1, Shea Palmer2, Ian Learmonth1, Paul Dieppe3\n\n1University of Bristol, Bristol, UK, 2University of West of England, Bristol, UK, 3Peninsula Medical School, Universities of Exeter and Plymouth, Exeter, UK\n\nBackground\n\nTotal knee replacement (TKR) is primarily performed to provide relief from long-term knee pain, most commonly caused by osteoarthritis (OA). Although TKR is an effective surgical intervention for many patients, there are a proportion of patients who continue to experience severe long-term pain in their replaced knee. A possible risk factor which may contribute to long-term pain after surgery is pain sensitisation. Pain sensitisation arises when continuous nociceptive input gives rise to changes within the nervous system, resulting in reduced pain thresholds. Pain sensitisation can be limited to local sensitisation in the nerves around the affected joint, as well as widespread sensitisation involving changes in spinal cord neurones and reduced pain thresholds at sites distant to the affected joint. The aim of this pilot study was to explore if there was a relationship between pre-operative pain thresholds and the severity of long-term pain after TKR.\n\nMethods\n\nQST was performed on the knee listed for surgery and the pain-free forearm of all participants. A digital Algometer was used to measure pressure pain thresholds (in KPa) and a MSA Thermotest was used to measure hot pain thresholds (in Celsius). Patients completed a WOMAC Pain questionnaire pre-operatively and then at 1-year after surgery. The WOMAC Pain score measures pain severity during 5 different activities to produce an overall score of 0-100 (worst to best). Correlations between pre-operative QST results and 1-year WOMAC Pain scores were tested using Spearman Rank correlation coefficients (CC).\n\nResults\n\n47 patients listed for a TKR because of OA participated in this study. Participants had a mean age of 68 years and 25 were female. Median WOMAC Pain scores improved from a median of 40 pre-operatively to a median of 90 at 1-year post-operatively. There was no significant correlation between pre-operative hot pain thresholds at the knee (CC 0.134, p=0.374), pre-operative hot pain thresholds at the forearm (CC 0.198, p=0.183) or pre-operative pressure pain thresholds at the knee (CC 0.236, p=0.123) and 1-year WOMAC Pain scores. However, there was a significant correlation between pre-operative pressure pain thresholds at the forearm (CC 0.291, p=0.047) and 1-year WOMAC Pain scores.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study found evidence that there is a relationship between pre-operative forearm pressure pain thresholds and pain severity in the replaced knee at 1-year after surgery. Although the correlation was only small it suggests that widespread hyperalgesia may contribute to long-term pain after TKR. Based on these findings, a study of 600 joint replacement patients is currently underway in Bristol to determine if pre-operative pressure pain thresholds are significant and independent predictors of the severity of long-term pain after TKR.\n\n018\n\n‘I feel so stupid because I can’t give a proper answer…’ How older adults describe chronic pain: a qualitative study\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nGeraldine Anthony1, Amanda Clarke2, Denise Gray1, Blair Smith3, Patricia Schofield5, Paul McNamee1, Denis Martin4, Derek Jones2\n\n1Aberdeen University, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK, 2Northumbria University, Northumbria, UK, UK, 3Dundee University, Dundee, Scotland, UK, 4Teeside University, Teeside, UK, 5Greenwich University, Greenwich, London, UK\n\nBackground\n\nAn increasing number of older adults experience chronic pain; figures suggest more than 50% of those living in the community are likely to be affected. Poorly managed pain threatens independent functioning, limits social activities and detrimentally affects emotional wellbeing. Despite this, the impact of chronic pain from the point of view of older adults is not fully understood. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to gain insight into how community-dwelling older adults with chronic non-cancer pain describe their pain, numerically and verbally. We will draw on data from the first phase of a broader study: Engaging with Older People and their Carers to develop interventions for the self-management of Chronic Pain (EOPIC).\n\nMethods\n\nSince the emphasis was on listening to older adults’ account of their pain, a qualitative narrative approach was chosen using semi-structured interviews. This method facilitates expression of the ‘lived’ and ‘told’ stories of individuals. Rather than simply reporting what they do, or what is done to them, it concerns how they feel. Men and women in NE Scotland participated in one or two interviews about how they ‘made sense’ of their chronic pain and its impact on their lives. We recruited through media advertising and contacts with groups and organisations. Individuals were included if they were aged 65 or over, had self-reported musculoskeletal chronic pain, and could give informed consent. All suitable volunteers were included. The sample comprised 23 men and women aged 66-89 years (mean = 73 years) of whom 16 (67%) were female. Sixteen participants were Caucasian. Data were transcribed verbatim and subjected to thematic and narrative analysis.\n\nResults\n\nThree themes specifically relating to descriptions of chronic pain emerged from our analysis: diversity in conceptualising pain using a simple numerical score; personalising the meaning of pain by way of storytelling; and, contextualising pain in relation to its impact on everyday activities. The findings demonstrate the value of describing pain verbally in the context of the individual’s life. Older adults were inclined to construct a narrative around their pain, even in response to ‘closed’ questions, and used this as the basis for much of their interviews, to give their pain some context and meaning. Participants also related their pain to physical or social activity as a means of indicating its severity and impact; for example, their ability to walk, on social activities and/or having to adapt these activities. Sometimes, the use of metaphor provided a useful vehicle to overcome initial difficulties in describing pain.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe findings of the study raise questions as to how best narrative medicine, as recommended and researched in other conditions, might be applied in pain assessment and management for older adults. Along with the judicious use of recommended numerical tools, this may require innovative methods to elicit verbal accounts. Our findings suggest the potential for encouraging the use of metaphors to help older adults to describe and discuss their experience, and the potential value of contextualising the effects of pain on activities that are important to the older person.\n\n019\n\nAssessing skill acquisition on a Pain Management Programme\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nCatherine Plant, Rachel Atherton\n\nNHS, Highlands of Scotland, UK\n\nBackground\n\nPain Management Programmes have an educational component in that they aim to teach participants a range of self management skills. The extent to which a patient benefits from the programme is thought to depend on the extent to which they adopt these strategies. Thus making the teaching and learning process more explicit should impact on the patients learning behaviour and enhance the outcome gained.\n\nPain Management Programmes have traditionally utilised a variety of validated measures to assess progress and measure outcome. However there has been limited attention to skill acquisition. Recent research demonstrates that outcomes selected by clinicians are often not those prioritised by patients who tend to value changes in skills highly. Furthermore, whilst traditional outcome measures often show change, there is a subset of patients who report a perceived benefit and high satisfaction which is not reflected in their outcome measures, disheartening for both patients and staff.\n\nMethods\n\nWe were keen to clarify to patients which pain management strategies the Pain Management Programme would cover. Pain Association Scotland have designed an internet based self report questionnaire, PASpider, to measure how well patients understand and utilise pain management strategies. With their agreement and with some modification to meet our needs this was adapted to a paper measure.\n\nThis was utilised prior to and during the Pain Management Programme with participants rating their perceived current ability to understand and put into practice pain management skills.\n\nResults\n\nInitial results so far indicate that it has:\n\nEnabled participants to monitor their own progress\n\nGood face validity and easily completed by patients\n\nAllowed positive feedback and encouragement\n\nHighlighted areas that require further attention allowing us to tailor interventions to individual needs\n\nDemonstrated clear improvements which were not always reflected by their other outcome measures\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, self monitoring of skill acquisition on a Pain Management Programme may have benefits for patients; enable appropriate targeting of limited resources and provide evidence of clinically significant changes not captured by traditional outcome measures.\n\n020\n\nAn early warning scoring system to detect complications of epidural analgesia\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nJames Day, Jane Quinlan, Mark Stoneham\n\nJohn Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK\n\nBackground\n\nThe NAP3 report of 2009 reviewing major complications of central neuraxial blocks cited delays in diagnosis and intervention as contributing to avoidable harm. Most of these complications occurred in epidurals used for postoperative analgesia where, arguably, epidurals may be of most benefit by reducing pain and enhancing surgical recovery.\n\nEarly warning scores have been well used in clinical medicine to identify early signs of patient deterioration. We have designed an early warning chart to identify epidural complications. The chart is similar in principle to other early warning systems with a number of domains each scoring separately. We felt the domains should include: Bromage score, high sensory block, days since insertion, fever, headache, back pain. If the patient scores highly in a single domain, or if the total cumulative score is high, then the nursing staff must follow a protocol to enable swift anaesthetic review and further intervention as necessary.\n\nMethods\n\nWe carried out two simultaneous audits to test the validity of the epidural scoring system: a retrospective notes review to clarify the sensitivity of the tool in patients with epidural complications; and a prospective audit to assess its ease of use for nursing staff. Retrospectively we reviewed the notes of 34 patients who had been identified by the Acute Pain Service as having potential epidural complications. Of these, 15 warranted further investigation, so were scored retrospectively with our scoring system to see if the symptoms would have provoked appropriate senior intervention.\n\nFor the prospective audit we distributed the chart to one surgical ward for use on all postoperative patients with epidural analgesia. Over the next 5 months we monitored the use of the new chart while also using current assessment protocols. Cross checking with current tools allowed the identification of any complications not recognised by the new chart.\n\nResults\n\nThe retrospective audit showed that the scoring chart had 100% sensitivity in identifying epidural complications. In 2/34 patients the early warning scoring system picked up abnormalities one day earlier than actually happened.\n\nIn the prospective audit, we received data from 49 patients who had received thoracic epidural analgesia for 2.8±0.9 days. This represents only a proportion of patients who received epidural analgesia, reflecting a lack of awareness of the new chart by some nursing staff. Seven patients (14%) ‘triggered’ the scoring system (total score ≥4 or any individual score >3). Of these, four triggered due to a sensory level above T4 in the first 24 hours postoperatively, possibly reflecting intraoperative bolus doses of local anaesthetic. No patient had a sensory level higher than T4 after the first postoperative day. The other three were patients with epidurals in situ for > 4 days. There were no adverse sequelae of epidural analgesia.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe are not aware of any current warning system to detect epidural complications. Our scoring system has high sensitivity to identify early signs of concern in patients with epidural analgesia. It is easy to use and does not require any extra monitoring than is routinely performed postoperatively by ward nursing staff. The numbers of patients ‘triggering’ the system does not appear to overwhelm the resources available; however the specificity needs to be such that potential devastating complications are recognised. We hope this will enable us to reduce the risk of rare but devastating complications of central neuraxial blockade.\n\n021\n\nPain, mood and satisfaction - the outcome paradox of patients attending a chronic pain clinic\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nAlexandra Ho, Bianca Kuehler, Carsten Bantel\n\nImperial College London, London, UK\n\nBackground\n\nChronic pain, defined by the British Pain Society as “continuous, long-term pain of more than 12 weeks or after the time that healing would have been thought to have occurred after trauma or surgery”, is reported to affect 7.8 million people in the UK(1). Despite its huge impact on quality of life and burden to society, with high rates of depression, unemployment and suicide(1,2), we are still in the process of establishing pain medicine and chronic pain clinics, as reflected by the fact that the first UK Pain Summit took place only in November 2011.\n\nThe summit concluded the need for chronic pain clinics, but to date, evaluation to comprehensively assess patient satisfaction with services and their impact on patients, is scarce.\n\nHence, this survey aimed to evaluate the impact of a chronic pain service on specific pain-related psychometric modalities, overall improvement, and corresponding patient satisfaction.\n\nMethods\n\nBetween April - May 2011, 43 chronic pain-patients scheduled for follow-up appointments were randomly selected. They were given modified Brief Pain Inventories which assessed psychometric modalities (pain severity, mood, sleep, ability to work, enjoyment of life, effect on relationships). Additionally, it included general assessments of satisfaction with the service and its perceived impact on their pain.\n\nPatients completed inventories privately to avoid a response bias whereby they might feel that answers that did not reflect well on their physician would negatively impact their care.\n\nAssessments used 11-point numeric rating scales (NRS).\n\n‘0’ in psychometric modalities represented no pain/impact and ‘10’ the most pain/negative impact. For general assessments however, ‘0’ indicated the most negative outcome and ‘10’ the most positive.\n\nFollow-up (FU) questionnaires were compared with those completed at patients’ initial assessments (IA). Descriptive and non-parametric statistics were applied as appropriate and data is presented as means+/-SEM (demographics) and percentages (assessment).\n\nResults\n\n30 patients (16 male, 14 female) with an average age of 56(+/-2.29) years and a mean duration of pain of 5(+/-0.74) years were included in the final analysis. The conditions treated comprised mainly lower back pain, joint pain and chronic widespread pain.\n\nData on general assessment showed that 82% believed pain had lessened on follow-up, with 37% rating improvement >5/10, however 18% reported no benefit. Additionally, 74% believed the treatment prescribed was helping; 41% scored this benefit >5/10.\n\nIn contrast, scores for pain-intensity, ability to work, general activity, enjoyment of life, effect on relationships, mood and sleep showed no significant improvements when compared to baseline scores.\n\nDespite this, all patients were satisfied with the service, 65% rated it >5/10 and 31% were “completely satisfied”. Furthermore, 96% would recommend the service to a friend, and all agreed the service was professional and the doctors compassionate.\n\nConclusion\n\nHigh satisfaction and subjective progress but no improvement in psychometric tests, demonstrated in this survey, presents a paradox in chronic pain patients. Although this concurs with previous studies(3,4), evidence suggests that satisfaction can associate positively with clinical outcome(5,6).\n\nThese discrepancies reflect the inadequacy of using assessments of subjective experiences, which may be influenced by confounding factors(6,7), as measures of pain.\n\nDue to the natural tendency to habituate, scores might vary considerably between assessments, resulting in a reduced reliability of the employed tools. There is thus ultimately a need for objective, reliable and specific biomarkers, to improve diagnostics in pain management(8).\n\nReferences\n\n(1) Chronic Pain Policy Coalition. About Chronic Pain.

The development and evaluation of a computer graphics application\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nAilie Turton1, Mark Palmer1, Sharon Grieve2, Tim Moss1, Jenny Lewis1,2, Candy McCabe1,2\n\n1University of the West of England, Bristol, UK, 2Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, Bath, UK\n\nBackground\n\nPatients with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) experience distressing changes in body perception. These are usually accompanied by strong negative emotions which commonly include a desire for amputation of the painful limb. These altered perceptions are difficult for patients to describe to clinicians as they do not match objective signs and they fear being disbelieved. Difficulty in communicating these altered body perceptions can further exacerbate their distressing emotional impact. Self portrait sketches are sometimes used, but this method is limited by the individual’s capacity to draw. Computer graphics offer an opportunity to provide an interactive tool to communicate perceptions of body image. The purpose of this project was to develop an application that patients will be able to use to create a 3D model of their perceived body image.\n\nMethods\n\nUsing data from a previous exploratory study of body perception and consultation with a person with CRPS, the first prototype digital media application was developed. The application allows modification of an avatar to depict alterations in size, shape, colour or visible surface texture of multiple body areas. It has so far been tested with ten patients, admitted to an inpatient CRPS rehabilitation programme, who gave consent to participate in the research. Participants used the application in a consultation with the research nurse. Audio recordings were made of the participants using the application and participants were asked to complete a structured questionnaire to ascertain their views and experience of using the tool. Responses to questionnaires and audio recordings were subjected to content analysis to determine acceptability of the application and its limitations.\n\nResults\n\nThe ten images produced are powerful illustrations of the distortions in body perception that patients with CRPS experience. All participants reported using the tool was an acceptable method for communicating their body perception and better than the drawings currently used in interviews with the Occupational Therapist. There were some additional features they identified to improve the usability of the application and reality of the final image e.g. adding the software capabilities to smaller sections of the limb such as each finger.\n\nParticipants described the positive impact for them of now seeing an image of a limb that they had previously only imagined and could now convey to others.\n\n“It looks in human form exactly how I feel and I’ve never had that. I’ve sat and said this hand feels longer and feels wider from there. I know I can see it but this is the first time someone else can.”\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is the first time CRPS evoked disturbances in body perception have been captured in such a graphical manner. The quality of the graphics enhanced the reality of the image thereby helping patients to fully convey to themselves and others how altered their bodies seem to them. A computer generated image was shown to be superior to the drawings used in current practice within a clinical interview. Refinement of the software programme is in progress. We envisage that this tool could extend beyond being a very useful communication device between patients and clinicians, and also become a meaningful outcome measure.\n\n023\n\nA first step to improve the inpatient pain experience\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nAtef Al-Tawafsheh, Ali Mofeez, Andrew Baranowski, Brigitta Brandner\n\nUniversity College London Hospitals Trust, London, UK\n\nBackground\n\nAt University College London Hospital (UCLH) a significant number of patients present with non-acute pain. These patients are frequently on high doses of opioids and/ or have complex pain issues that can make it difficult to be managed by the primary medical or surgical team. The admission often is prolonged with complications. The clinical work required for a successful outcome involves different teams and complex investigative procedures. The involvement of the inpatient pain team is poorly reflected in necessary time for assessment. The allocated time is often not reflected in the patient’s tariff by the referring authority. This significantly impacts on the quality of service that can be offered to patients. The aim of this audit is to identify the length of time spent by the pain team on each patient and to identify the main users of the service in a tertiary referral centre and develop an inpatient pathway.\n\nMethods\n\nA prospective audit was performed over a period of three months in UCLH. All adult chronic in-patients who had been referred to the in-patient pain team were included in the audit. The number of patients and the time spent on assessment and treatment for each specialty were computed. Data recorded were entered into a database and analysed using Excel. The inpatient pathway will be developed following the clinical pathway development process 1.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 48 patients were referred to the pain team and these patients were reviewed in 144 visits. Of these, 16 patients (33.3%) were from the Gastroenterology, 8 (10.4%) Gynaecology or Haematology; and 4 (8%) Oncology, Urology or Rheumatology. A total of 3780 minutes were spent by the pain team. The longest time spent was on the gastroenterology patients (1295 minutes, 34%) followed by the haematology patients (420 minutes, 11.1%); 360 (9.5%) and 340 (9%) minutes were spent on the urology and rheumatology patients respectively; 330 (8.7%) and 275 (7.3) minutes were spent on gynaecology and oncology patients respectively.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe majority of clinical time was spent on the gastroenterology-patients followed by haematology, urology, rheumatology, gynaecology and oncology. The patients referred by gastroenterology had all been tertiary or quarterly referrals. The involvement of the pain team often was last after assessment by other specialties leading to significant delay in the discharge planning. This led to a meeting with the gastroenterology team to define an in-patient pathway for gastroenterology-patients who required admission for treatment and investigation. The introduction of a structured rapid assessment pathway with MDT and referral before admission will aim at improving effectiveness, outcomes and length of stay 2.\n\n024\n\nAudit of effectiveness of repeat blocks and evaluation of a scoring system in chronic pain patients\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nKarthikeyan Thanigaimani, Sarah Lewis, Michael Williams\n\nQueen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, UK\n\nBackground\n\nNICE in 2009 published the clinical guideline on “Early management of persistent non-specific low back pain” in which they have advised not to offer injections of therapeutic substances into the back for non-specific low back pain of one year duration. The efficacy and benefits from repeated regional blocks for chronic pain patients has not been clearly demonstrated in RCT and there is a constant pressure from PCT’s to reduce the number of regional blocks for chronic pain patients. Therefore we decided to do a service improvement project to assess the effectiveness of regional blocks in chronic pain patients having repeat injections at the Queen Alexandra Hospital and to evaluate a scoring system for the review of patients following the block.\n\nMethods\n\nThe scoring system was adapted from the article by Veemaraj et all in the Pain News 2009. Parameter measured were duration of effect (1-4), percentage pain reduction (0- 3), improvement of sleep (0- 1), improvement of mobility (0- 1), reduction of medications (0- 2), improvement of quality of life (0- 2) and ability to continue work (0 or 2). The duration of effect, percentage of pain reduction and score for the ability to work were modified. The total score ranged from 1 to 15.\n\nPatients who came for a repeat injection between February 2011 and April 2011 were given a questionnaire to fill. Based on a scoring system the efficacy and benefits gained by the patients from the injections were assessed by an independent assessor. Outcomes for patients were also reviewed by looking into clinic letters and nurse led follow ups by an independent assessor. The two reviews were compared.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 122 patients had repeat blocks during the 3 month period. Lumbar epidurals, facet joint steroid injection, selective nerve root block and radio frequency denervations accounted for 63% of repeat injections. 74% of the patients had 2 or less blocks in a year. Out of the 122 patients 25 patients scored less than 7 and 97 patients scored greater than 7. The mean score was 8.9 with a SD of 3.0. 79% of the patients derived significant benefit from the block.\n\nWhen the scoring system was compared with notes, clinic letters and nurse telephone reviews in 89% of the cases there was a good correlation in the assessment of the effectiveness of the block. In 6% of the patients there was no clear documentation in the notes and in 5% of patients the score and the clinician review were different.\n\nConclusion\n\nOf the 122 patients 74% had 2 or less blocks in a year and 79% of patients had significant benefits from the block. The scoring system used was good in assessing the pain relief from the block and also the effect on sleep, mobility, work and quality of life. It is easy to use, more objective, can be administered over the phone and as the data is collected in a score format is easy to audit outcome. We have incorporated the scoring system in to the nurse telephone review at 3 months and 6 months following regional blocks.\n\n025\n\nReferral patterns and clinic outcomes from a tertiary pain clinic: can they inform service design?\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nRosalind Adam\n\nNHS Grampian, Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, UK\n\nBackground\n\nThe majority of chronic pain patients are never referred to a pain clinic. There is a drive to manage chronic pain services in the community but a community based approach may not be appropriate for all patients. It is likely that the source and reason for referrals to the tertiary pain clinic is changing over time in response to local and national factors, such as the availability of minimally invasive interventions, and the publication of national guidelines for chronic pain conditions.\n\nAberdeen Pain clinic is a tertiary referral service, accepting referrals from general practitioners and hospital specialists. Precision diagnostic blocks and target specific treatments are offered as part of a holistic and multi-disciplinary approach. We audited our new patient referral patterns and their clinic outcomes to inform the design of our services.\n\nMethods\n\nProspective data collection was done over a period of 2 months. Pain physicians filled in an audit form for new patients who attended clinic between March 2011 and May 2011. The physician was asked to record the date of referral; the date of assessment; the name of the referrer; the location of the referrer; the reason for referral; and the outcome after clinic assessment. The referral reasons and outcomes were categorised to facilitate analysis. Data was transferred to an excel spreadsheet and examined qualitatively and using basic statistical techniques.\n\nResults\n\nData was obtained for 83 new patients. Of them, 56.6% (47) were referred by their General Practitioner while 36 (43.4%) were referred by other specialists. The speciality requests ranged from orthopaedics, neurosurgery, rheumatology, Hepatobiliary Surgery, Urology, Vascular Surgery, Elderly Medicine and other pain clinics.\n\nOf the referrals from General practice, 14.7% were made for specific reasons such as minimally invasive therapy, psychology input, or advice on pharmacotherapy, 8.4% was for alternative therapies while 68.08% was for general advice and management.\n\nOf the referrals from Specialists, 47% was made for specific reasons such as minimally invasive therapy, Psychology input, or advice on pharmacotherapy, 2.7% was for alternative therapies while 44.4% was for general management advice.\n\nConclusion\n\nReferrals to the pain clinic are primarily from General Practitioners for general advice. A variety of specialists are making referrals, often with a specific request for an intervention. Minimally invasive interventions are being offered as an alternative to invasive procedures and to aid diagnosis prior to surgery. Over a third of patients referred to the clinic were offered a minimally invasive intervention. This has implications for the capacity and design of our service. It will be vital to identify patients who can appropriately be managed in primary care whilst encouraging referrals for those who might benefit from specialist input.\n\n026\n\nThe influence of pain on number sense\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nAshikur Rahman, Bianca Kuehler, Carsten Bantel\n\nImperial College London, London, UK\n\nBackground\n\nExposure to chronic pain has been shown to induce structural changes in the brain. Apkarian et al (2004) were the first to demonstrate a reduction in grey matter density within the prefrontal cortex and thalamus of patients with chronic back pain. Subsequent studies have revealed similar findings within the anterior cingulated, motor, parietal and insular cortices, secondary to other pain syndromes. Since the prefrontal and parietal cortices are known to be responsible for the human ‘number sense’ (Jacob et al, 2009) we hypothesise that pain, particularly chronic pain, significantly impairs patients’ abilities to perform numerical-spatial transformation tasks accurately. Therefore, this study was conducted to elucidate the degree of inaccuracy shown by acute and chronic pain patients in comparison to healthy controls when asked to translate a number into a spatial representation on a straight line.\n\nMethods\n\nAn observational study was carried out at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital between September and December 2011. Volunteers aged over 18 years and free of neuropsychiatric and communication problems were selected and placed into one of three patient cohorts; pain-free controls, chronic pain (pain duration > 12 months) and acute pain (history of surgery in the last 24-48 hours). Each participant was asked to mark a series of six pre-determined numbers (6, 17, 29, 43, 61, 84) on to straight lines, as described by Siegeler and Booth (2004), with ‘0’ and ‘100’ demarcated at either end. The actual numbers marked by these spatial representations were then calculated and assessed for the degree of error in relation to the expected values. Mean errors for each value were calculated and statistical differences assessed thereafter, using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 24 individuals (17 females, 7 males), with an average age of 44 years, participated in this pilot study. Chronic pain patients (n = 8) were found to exhibit a greater degree of inaccuracy when tasked with transforming numerical values into spatial representations in comparison to healthy, pain-free individuals (n = 9; p < 0.05). The mean magnitude of error found within the control group was 4.14 ± 0.45 (SEM), compared with 6.06 ± 0.61 in the chronic pain cohort. The acute pain group (n = 7) also showed a greater magnitude in mean error relative to controls (4.63 ± 0.61); however this was not statistically significant. All three cohorts generally underestimated the straight line spatial transformation of the pre-determined numbers, although there was a trend for chronic pain patients to make more frequent overestimations relative to the other groups.\n\nConclusion\n\nResults from this study suggest that patients suffering from a wide range of conditions giving rise to chronic pain have a significantly impaired number sense when compared with healthy, pain-free individuals. It can therefore be inferred that, when faced with tasks requiring quantification of abstract numbers, these patients will struggle to be accurate. As a consequence, this calls in to question the viability of both the visual analogue scale and the numeric rating scale - currently the gold-standard pain assessments tools - as meaningful instruments in the clinical management of chronic pain.\n\n027\n\nA survey of inpatient referrals to pain management unit\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nSabita Sreevalsan2, Mike Bailey1, Mike Lee1\n\n1Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust, Ipswich, UK, 2Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Norwich, UK\n\nBackground\n\nPatients with chronic pain are often hospitalized with severe aggravation or new onset pain prompting extensive investigation by the admitting medical or surgical team to rule out any readily reversible pathology. Pain in these patients is complicated by psychosocial issues and conventional analgesics often fail, triggering a referral to the Pain Management Unit (PMU). Referral prompts assessment by a Pain Consultant or Fellow, who makes recommendations for pain management to facilitate physical function. The eventual aim is discharge to primary or outpatient care, where the needs of the patients can be better met by the PMU in partnership with the General Practitioner (GP) or other appropriate specialty.\n\nWe conducted a process audit to review the following: (a) Number of inpatient referrals to PMU in our District General Hospital (b) The management by the pain team (c) To identify any aspects of care that can be improved.\n\nMethods\n\nIn the absence of published guidelines, the clinical standards we proposed were (1) Review by pain clinician within 24 hours of referral. (2) Outpatient follow up at PMU within 06 weeks of discharge and (3) Adequate communication with the GP regarding medication, treatment aims and follow up arrangements.\n\nAll inpatient referrals logged by the secretaries at the Pain Management Unit during a two month period from 01/02/2011 to 31/03/2011 were audited. Case notes were retrieved and perused. Referring speciality, reason for referral, time to assessment by pain clinician, pain management and discharge and follow up data were collected. Findings were compared to the proposed standards.\n\nResults\n\nThere were 20 inpatient referrals to the Pain Management Unit in a 2 month period.\n\nThe bulk of referrals were from orthopaedics. The most common cause of referral was acute exacerbation of chronic back pain, the other causes ranged from ischaemic leg pain to overdose. Management mainly involved judicious adjustment of medication. A very small proportion went on to have interventions or surgery.\n\nRegarding standards of care, only 14/ 20 patients were seen by the pain team within 24 hours. Communication with the GP relied on the meticulousness of the junior doctor in the admitting team and occurred in 12/ 20 patients. Only 6/ 20 patients were followed up in the Pain management unit within 6 weeks of discharge. It was found on perusal of the notes that not all of these patients needed follow-up in 6 weeks. Some necessary appointments were not made due to administrative error.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe standard of early review within 24 hours was met only in 70 % of the patients. An intranet based referral logging system would ensure daily uptake of referrals by pain clinicians.\n\nCommunication with GP needed improvement. It would be prudent to dictate a letter regarding the inpatient pain management and future treatment aims directly to the GP.\n\nFollow-up arrangements were inconsistent mainly due to oversight by the admitting team. It is recommended that the visiting pain clinician make decisions and arrangements regarding follow up at the time of initial inpatient consultation.\n\nA re-audit is planned after recommended changes are implemented.\n\n028\n\nCan the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure be used to identify the minimum clinically important difference in walking performance?\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nMark Draper, Helen Ayling, Peter Murphy, John Tetlow\n\nThe Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust, Lower Lane, Fazakerley, Liverpool, Merseyside, UK\n\nBackground\n\nThe COPM is an individualised, client-centred measure designed for use by Occupational Therapists to detect change in a client’s self-perception of occupational performance over time. Law et al 2005 in the COPM manual proposed that a 2 point change in total score be considered clinically significant for research. 50% of patients assessed for our Pain Management Programme (PMP) select walking as a COPM item. The 50m walk and 5 minute walk test (5MWT) are also employed as outcome measures on our PMP (Harding et al 1994). Redelmeier DA et al in 1997 reported a 50m improvement in the 6 minute walk test is the minimal clinical important difference (MCID) among patients with chronic lung disease, but for chronic pain patients this threshold remains unknown. Booker et al 2010 proposed that the MCID in functional measures is ≥34% for PMPs.\n\nMethods\n\nWe therefore set out to first establish if there was an correlation between the changes in COPM walking item score and the walk measures. If so, it could be inferred that ≥2 point improvement in that specific item on the 0-10 scale would indicate a MCID in 50m walk test or 5MWT. We used the data from an opportunistic sample of 102 heterogeneous chronic pain patients who selected ‘walking’ as a COPM item. The changes in the COPM walking item scores were calculated and the changes in both types of their walk tests were converted to absolute and percentage change values. Spearman’s rank coefficient correlation and Chi-Square test was used to calculate the degree of dependence between the 4 values using SPSS (v12).\n\nResults\n\nThe median baseline COPM performance and satisfaction scores for walking were 3 and 1 out of 10 respectively. The median change was 2 and 4 respectively. The mean baseline 50m walk was 85.7s (SD=72.8 s) and 5MWT was 160.2m (SD=95.9m) compared to 167.68m for the entire group that year. The mean change in time to complete the 50m walk was -19.4s or -16.5% and in distance covered in the 5MWT was +77m or +90.3%. The Spearman’s rank coefficient demonstrated a positive but non-significant correlation between changes in COPM scoring for walking and both walking tests irrespective of how those changes were interpreted. Significance level (1 tailed) was reached for all correlations except those between COPM performance change and percentage speed change (p=0.139) and absolute speed change (p=0.271). Chi-Square test (2x2) only revealed a significant association between the COPM performance change and change in the 5MWT (7.55, p=<0.01).\n\nConclusion\n\nWe found that self-reported changes in walking performance and satisfaction as measured by the COPM were unreliable in predicting changes in observed walking. Interestingly a significant proportion of patients both overestimated and underestimated changes in their walking ability. We found a significant association between changes in COPM performance scores and the 5MWT, but not the 50m walk, indicating distance is more meaningful. Several authors have also identified discrepancies between objective and subjective improvements in chronic pain populations (Wittink 2003, Fisher & Johnson 1997, Christine Ellen Lee 2001). Incidentally, 52% of our patient sample achieved ≥34% improvement in the 5MWT.\n\n029\n\nPatient satisfaction, pain & quality of life after pain interventions\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nSenthiil Vijayan, Jeremy Weinbren, Damien Smith, Bel Vadodaria\n\nThe Hillingdon Hospital, London, UK\n\nBackground\n\nWe wanted to assess the response to various interventions performed in our pain service and their impact on patients quality of life.\n\nPatients were followed up 6 months following the interventions and changes in their pain scores and quality of pain were assessed.\n\nPatients were given a questionnaire to complete in the 6 month follow up clinic. Data was collected from various pain clinics run by 3 consultants, one advanced pain trainee and one associate specialist. This is a busy Clinic, with an annual caseload of approximately 1300 new patients, 2500 follow-ups and 3400 procedures .\n\nMethods\n\nA simple questionnaire was distributed to a 3-week sample of patients who had received treatment for chronic pain conditions six months previously at our busy DGH Pain Medicine Clinic. The treatment combinations studied included prescription of medication, interventional treatment (injections), Acupuncture and TENS.\n\nSimple linear scale measures of Pain and Quality of Life improvement percentages were collected as well as a binary satisfaction score.\n\nData were analysed using Excel (Microsoft Inc, Seattle), and descriptive statistical analysis as well as\n\ncorrelation analysis for Pain and QOL change were performed.\n\nResults\n\nThe number of patients surveyed was 150, with various treatment combinations.\n\nThere was a high correlation between Pain relief scores and QOL improvement scores (r2=0.954) and those with higher scores were more likely to report satisfaction.\n\nOverall 81% of our patients in this sample were satisfied. The variation according to treatments is in .\n\nTable 1\n\nMean before procedureMean after procedureMean differenceP valueCIPain at worst 9 3.2 5.8 0.001 3.76 to 7.84Pain at best 5.20 1.60 3.6 0.006 1.71 to 5.48Pain at average 7.20 2.20 5.0 0.001 3.24 to 6.75Anxiety 8.60 3.40 5.20 0.000 3.84 to 6.56Mood 7.80 4.80 3.0 0.07 –0.51 to 6.51General activity 8.60 4.60 4.0 0.03 0.60 to 7.40Sleep 6.80 4.40 2.4 0.09 -0.71 to 5.51\n\nMean Pain (P) and QOL (Q) improvements were 12.1%(P,Q) if not satisfied and 61.9% (P) and 61.0% (Q) if satisfied. The overall mean Pain and QOL improvements were >50% in all groups.\n\nThe small number of patients whose treatment included TENS (n=9) were most satisfied (100%)\n\nAnalysis of Chi-squared goodness-of-fit showed high correlations for all indices (p<0.01) . Thus, Positive Predictive Value for 50% decrease in Pain score for Injection is 0.70. PPVs for each treatment are shown graphically. 95% confidence intervals were all >0 for Pain relief except TENS and Medication for 90% relief.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe results demonstrate a high level of patient satisfaction and improvement in our Clinic.\n\nIn this sample, the average improvements were >50% and Positive Predictive Values for\n\neach of the treatments to achieve this mean score were high. This suggests that we are\n\nassigning the correct treatments.\n\nOf our patients in this sample who had injection treatment a high percentage were satisfied.\n\nOverall, all treatment groups had high percentages and amounts of\n\nimprovement and satisfaction.\n\nWe feel that further study would more clearly define which elements of satisfaction and\n\nimprovement are linked to specific treatment combinations.\n\n030\n\nPatient experiences of pain management - do chronic pain patients feel differently?\n\nCategory: Assessment & Measurement\n\nAdnaan Qureshi, Rajiv Malhotra, Michael Goulden, Fran Ion, Ruth Wheelhouse, Janet Beattie\n\nRoyal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK\n\nBackground\n\nChronic pain patients experience greater involvement with healthcare providers and are often seen by numerous physicians / therapists including specialist chronic pain clinics. We suggest that owing to their previous experiences with complex pain management problems and numerous previous interactions with the health care system, they would pose a greater challenge to staff during hospitalization and so would have lower levels of satisfaction with their pain relief as compared to the non chronic pain population. In addition, the chronic use of analgesics including strong opiates leads us to hypothesise that pain management will be more challenging on the wards where it may not necessarily be overseen by specialist pain doctors and nurses, leading again to a subjective perception of inadequate pain relief.\n\nMethods\n\nOver 4 weeks in November / December 2011, every medical and surgical ward in an adult university teaching hospital was visited (excluding critical care areas). A member of the pain team randomly selected 4 males and 4 female for survey. Ward type (medical or surgical) was recorded. Each patient was asked the following:\n\nWere you admitted in pain?\n\nDo you take regular analgesia at home?\n\nDo you have longstanding pain?\n\nIf so, was this longstanding pain the reason for your admission?\n\nDo you think hospital staff do all they can to control your pain?\n\nHow satisfied are you with your pain management in hospital? (0-100%)\n\nHow long is there between asking for and receiving analgesia?\n\nData was collected anonymously. A 10% absolute difference in mean values was chosen to represent statistical significance.\n\nResults\n\n226 records were obtained. Not all patients provided answers to all questions.\n\nWe identified 95 chronic pain patients and 100 non chronic pain patients. 82.1% of chronic pain patients were admitted with any pain. 45.3% of chronic pain patients said it was their longstanding pain that prompted admission. 82.1% of chronic pain patients were on regular analgesia at home vs 15.6% of non chronic pain patients.
