Our mission is to serve the Westminster community by maintaining lifelong friendships and fostering community support networks.\n\nWhat We Do\n\nWe facilitate alumni contact in as many forums as possible including reunions, homecoming activities and life events of our graduates. The heart of our approach is local chapter events where alumni can connect in the city where they reside, whether it be in Augusta, Atlanta, Austin or Albuquerque. We also write welcome letters to graduating seniors each spring to connect them to the greater alumni community. And yes, we do help the school with fundraising for alumni donations.\n\nWant to put your ideas into action?\n\nWe are always looking for new board members, local chapter contacts and those interested in giving back to the school financially. We also welcome ideas about the Alumni Network and Association and what we can do to make it better!\n\nUpdate Your Info:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScah5hDP1hvJzybXySfSezMTOlXWuw55cqsz2Lt_UsUoFc-Ug/viewform?PN=Alumni\n\nSubmit News:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScah5hDP1hvJzybXySfSezMTOlXWuw55cqsz2Lt_UsUoFc-Ug/viewform?PN=Alumni\n\nLinks to follow on social media or even have social media feed\n\nContact\n\nRahkeem George\n\nAlumni Coordinator\n\nalumni@wsa.net\n\nI think this would be a great place to have some news articles - I can pull some up and we could link to a few - what do you think?\n\nBottom of page links:\n\nGive Now | Calendar | News"
