Now in its 5th Edition it was, from the outset, recognised as not only a truly remarkable achievement but a truly great book and it rapidly became, and still is, the most important Radiology textbook on all Radiologist’s bookshelves, in all Radiology departments and in all hospital libraries.\n\nProfessor David Allison has been awarded Gold medals by CIRSE in 1998, ECR in 2000 , the British Society of Interventional Radiology in 2003 and the Royal College of Radiologists in 2011.\n\nHe was the author of many published works on the nature of combat between the 14th and 21st centuries, concerning land, air, maritime, and intelligence warfare, as well as the psychology of battle.\n\nIn 1960 Keegan took up a lectureship in military history at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, the body that trained officers for the British Army. He remained for 26 years, becoming a senior lecturer in military history during his tenure, during which he also held a visiting professorship at Princeton University and was Delmas Distinguished Professor of History at Vassar College.\n\nLeaving the academy in 1986, Keegan joined the Daily Telegraph as a defence correspondent and stayed with the paper as defence editor until his death. He also wrote for the American conservative National Review Online. In 1998 he wrote and presented the BBC's Reith Lectures, entitling them War in our World.\n\nOn 29 June 1991, as a war correspondent for The Daily Telegraph, Keegan was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) \"in recognition of service within the operations in the Gulf\". In the 2000 New Year Honours, he was knighted \"for services to Military History\".\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL) in 1986. In 1993 he won the Duff Cooper Prize.\n\nIn 1996, he was awarded the Samuel Eliot Morison Prize for lifetime achievement by the Society for Military History.\n\nHe was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Letters (DLitt) by the University of Bath in 2002.\n\nHe has been Principal of Collingwood College, Durham since 2011, and a Professor of Education at Durham University since 2004.\n\nElliot qualified as a teacher and taught in mainstream and special schools. He then practised as an LEA educational psychologist.\n\nIn 1990, he became an academic, and joined the University of Sunderland as a lecturer.

On the night of 1st–2nd July, 1915, when it was essential that a portion of a trench which had been lost should be regained, Captain O'Sullivan, although not belonging to the troops at this point volunteered to lead a party of bomb throwers to effect the recapture. He advanced in the open under a very heavy fire and in order to throw his bombs with greater effect, got up on the parapet, where he was completely exposed to the fire of the enemy occupying the trench. He was finally wounded, but not before his inspiring example had led his party to make further efforts, which resulted in the recapture of the trench. On the night of 18th–19th June, 1915, Captain O'Sullivan had saved a critical situation in the same locality by his personal gallantry and good leading.\n\nHe joined the RAF on a short service commission in September 1935.\n\nHe was posted to France on 16th March 1940 and joined 87 Squadron there.
