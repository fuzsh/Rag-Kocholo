        "text": "<p>Folks:\n\nI am the parent of an 8th grader who is beginning to explore boarding schools as a repeat 9th grade student. We have done a number of visits at different schools informally just to get a sense for how students interact and to better understand the feel of the schools. I think my son has learned as much about himself as he has about the respective schools that he has visited.</p>\n\n<p>Two of his schools that he has not been able to visit are Westminster and Salisbury. That said, he has met with coaches from both schools who have been terrific about taking the time to speak with him in person as well as by email. </p>\n\n<p>Aside from what he can learn via the internet and the school materials, can anyone provide additional insight into both schools? We are hoping to catch home lacrosse games at both to get a chance to meet students and see how they interact and support one another.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n<p>Hi! I have to say that I do not know anything about Salisbury but hear it’s great. I do have a son who is a sophomore at Westminster and my daughter will be joining him there next year as a freshman. My son loves it and my daughter is so excited! We have been very pleased with the school. There is definately a strong sense of community there as well as a very supportive faculty . Simsbury is a very quaint town which is just a walk away from campus. The campus itself is very pretty, not huge with a large quad in the center…The new Armour academic building is beautiful. Headmaster, Bill Phillips is new this year but has been at Westy for a long time previously. He is very present on campus and the students all seem to like him. The previous headmaster, Graham Cole, chose not to put a lot of signage on campus because he wanted visitors to campus to ask the student for directions, as he the felt that the students are Westminster best ambassadors. They are! I always feel very welcome on campus and am always greeted by students walking the other way. My son is not a big athlete but some of his best friends are lax and/or hockey players. The students seem to respect each other for what they do. Hope this helps and good luck!!!</p>\n\n<p>Chargers:\n\nThat’s terrific information. These are the experiences that you only hear about from either parents or students who have gone through the school and it is also what makes this board such a help. I really appreciate your sharing. I know that there is good and bad in each school and that the information around the topic has been positive so I am being realistic that there will be others with different experiences. That said, I had never had the insight into how the faculty works with the students to provide the additional support as needed.</p>"
