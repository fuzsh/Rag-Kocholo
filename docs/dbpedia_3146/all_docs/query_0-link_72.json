August, Pat and David Cave returned to the church where Eric James had married them 67 years ago. Previously we had not been since the last service taken by Reindrop who had helped Pat enter the Anglican Church and prepared us for marriage; he had also been the \"Sky Pilot\" of my ship during the war. We were very happy to have our family with us adding nostalgia to the service. David was introduced to a ringer who knew the lady who taught him to ring in 1946 a time when she gave up some of her petrol ration to teach a band of teenagers. Come to think of it this was God doing the impossible.\n\nDavid Cave\n\n​Friday 2nd September 2022\n\nIt has been such an amazing year. I have learnt so much over this past year at St Stephen’s church. I have met so many amazing, wonderful and unique children and young people who come from all different walks of life. I am very sorry to say that I have made the hard and challenging decision to leave St Stephen’s due to being offered another job in the area that I would ideally like to be living. I will be doing the same kind of work with the children and young people, just in a different church and a different area. It was so sad to be leaving St Stephen’s last weekend and I am so grateful for all the kind words of encouragement I received form fellow staff members and members of our lovely congregation. God has taught me so much while I was at St Stephen’s and introduced me so many brilliant young people. I will miss the church so much and all the work I did with the children. However, I strongly believe that God has got the church community of St Stephen’s in the palm of His hand and He will be looking after the children and youth ministry at St Stephen’s church. I leave my prayers with you all and wish you the best of luck for the future and hope that God blesses you and your families through this new, academic year.\n\nKim Philips\n\n(outgoing Youth Apprentice Worker)\n\nWednesday 3rd August 2022\n\nYou may have noticed that, in church at the moment, we are praying a lot for something called The Lambeth Conference. The Lambeth Conference is one of the four main bits of “glue” that keeps the Anglican Communion together since it was founded in 1867. It meets every ten years (with a couple of exceptions) and aims to provide a place where Bishops from all over the world can meet together, share in worship, and discuss important issues of the day. At the end of the conference, what has been decided in response to those issues is shared throughout the Anglican Communion as “resolutions” or “calls.” The resolutions have no legal affect on the churches, but do significantly influence policy throughout the Anglican Communion.\n\nAs you may imagine in a time before aeroplanes, the first ever Lambeth Conference in 1867 was quite small – only 76 bishops were present. In contrast, the one taking place in Canterbury at the moment has over 600 bishops from around 165 countries across the world, as well as their spouses and other church representatives. It’s no wonder that in the 1970s, the conference moved from Lambeth Palace itself to the University of Kent in Canterbury! Throughout its 155 year history, the conference has debated issues as wide ranging as Christian Science and spiritualism, sex and sexuality, and the role of women in the church. These debates have not always been easy, and some churches have not sent bishops to Lambeth Conferences because they don’t agree with the stance the Conference takes on certain issues.\n\nThe Lambeth Conference may seem either very dry and legalistic, or a source of difficulty and controversy, but it’s an important part of who we are as Christians. Despite being members of the Church of England, we are also part of a worldwide church in the Anglican Communion – one in which we are brothers and sisters in Christ, even when we don’t always agree. On top of that is Jesus’s prayer that his disciples might all be united, that “they might be one” (John 17:22). Jesus didn’t want us to be divided, but we also have to reckon with the pain and distress that Christians have caused one another in the name of our faith.\n\n​\n\nThere are divisions and difficulties within the Anglican Communion that can come further into the light at the Lambeth Conference, but it is also a time that should be governed by one of the most fundamental aspects of being a Christian: hope. This year, the conference will be focusing on 1 Peter, with a theme of all Christians being “Called into hope and holiness in Christ.” Even when we feel stuck in the mire of our disagreements, we can always look up and ahead to the sure and certain hope of God’s kingdom come on earth, and that day when we will all truly be one.\n\nWednesday 27th July 2022\n\nThis week's devotion from our vicar Revd Graham Buckle in New York.\n\nPlease do join us this Sunday 31st July 7pm on Zoom as we speak to Graham about his reflections as he nears the end of his stay at Holy Trinity, New York. For all details please see here.\n\n​Wednesday 20th July 2022\n\nAnother update from our vicar Revd Graham Buckle from New York, where he has been at our link parish Holy Trinity for the past 3 weeks.\n\nWednesday 13th July 2022\n\nIt has been such a rollercoaster of a year this year. I can’t believe we are near to the end of the academic year of 2022. It is a very exciting and yet very emotional time. Especially for those families who are watching and journeying with their children and young people who are leaving their Primary or Secondary schools. I have spent a lot of time with the year 6’s in our community over the last couple of weeks and I am beyond amazed of the strength all of these young people have exhibited. There are a lot of nerves circulating amongst our young people and rightly so. They are about to leave the school they have known their whole lives, to be plunged into a new one where all the other students are older than them and very experienced with secondary school. They are showing wonderful signs of bravery, courage and a willingness to take on this new chapter. Let’s keep our young people in our prayers at this very sad and emotional time. For only God has the strength to truly understand how each child is feeling and how exactly to comfort them in this challenging time. Let’s also not forget their families who must be feeling as nervous and anxious as their children are. Their strength and support will be carrying all our young people in such a way that only families can provide. To all the year 6’s in our community, you are amazing and so very strong. Whenever times get hard, remember how you are loved by God and fearfully and wonderfully made in His image. We here at St Stephen’s are always around if you need any kind of support.\n\nI praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful; I know that full well. Psalm 139: 14\n\nKim Phillips\n\nYouth Apprentice Worker\n\nWednesday 6th July 2022\n\nA video from our vicar Graham in New York!\n\nWednesday 29th June 2022\n\nSaying goodbye/farewell/so-long is always difficult and comes with so much “stuff” we have to process. I write this Daily Devotion as I am about to leave for New York City to look after our link parish, the Church of the Holy Trinity for a month whilst John is on Sabbatical. But it also comes on the back of having to say goodbye to our wonderful bursar Alison last Sunday morning, and Kevin and Jackie who are moving to Bexleyheath in the evening.\n\nI found I had a mixture of emotions, for whilst pleased for them personally, I was sad to be seeing them take their leave - though I am sure we will be still seeing them occasionally, but obviously in a different capacity. So we bid them well and send them off with our prayers and love, as I do you. I shall miss St Stephen's very much, but look forward to seeing you all in August and hope to send you some updates and videos which we shall upload to our Weekly Devotion.\n\n​Of course, one of the things which we as Christians have at our disposal is prayer. It was a powerful thing on Sunday to pray for and with those who were leaving. And as part of our weekly devotion this week I would like to share with you what we prayed with Alison at the morning’s eucharist. Please use it and perhaps pray it for those moments of your leave taking of various things and places. God bless and see you all soon friends\n\nRevd Graham Buckle, Vicar\n\nGod of our beginnings and endings,\n\nwe celebrate all we have shared with Alison\n\nand ask your blessing as she continues her journey.\n\nMay the love that is in our hearts\n\nbe a bond that unites us forever,\n\nwherever we may be.\n\nMay the power of your presence\n\nbless this moment of our leave-taking;\n\nthis we ask for the sake of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. Amen.\n\nThe following RESPONSE may be prayed; Congregation [St S], Alison [A].\n\n[St S] As you journey onward,\n\nwe ask forgiveness where we have failed you;\n\nwe give thanks for all you have given us;\n\nwe assure you of our love and prayers.\n\n[A] As I leave, I ask forgiveness where I have failed you;\n\nleaving I give thanks for all that you have given to me;\n\nI assure you of my love and prayers.\n\n[St S] As you experience the pain of change,\n\nand the insecurity of moving on,\n\nwe pray that you may also experience\n\nthe blessing of inner growth.\n\n[A] I know that God goes with me.\n\n[St S] As you meet the poor, the pained,\n\nand the stranger on the Way,\n\nwe pray that you may see in each one\n\nthe face of Christ.\n\n[A] I know that God goes with me.\n\n[St S] As you walk through the good times and the bad,\n\nwe pray that you may never lose sight\n\nof the shelter of God's loving arms.\n\n[A] I know that God goes with me.\n\n[St S] As you ponder your decisions\n\nand wonder over the fruits of your choice,\n\nwe pray that the peace of Christ\n\nmay reign in your heart.\n\n[A] I know that God goes with me.\n\nWe praise and thank you, God of the journey,\n\nfor our sister Alison who is soon to leave us.\n\nWe entrust her into your loving care,\n\nknowing that you are always the faithful traveller\n\nand companion on the Way.\n\nShelter and protect her from all harm and anxiety.\n\nGrant her the courage to meet the future,\n\nand grace to let go into new life;\n\nthrough Jesus Christ our Saviour. Amen.\n\nWednesday 22nd June 2022\n\nI always find it exciting when preparing for our Annual St Stephen’s Week. Not only due to the pride I feel in our own wonderful community, but because it feels like a true celebration and opportunity to showcase and join in with the community of which we form part.\n\nThis year, after the difficult times we’ve been through, after clapping together, mourning together and pulling together as a community, it is with great delight that I can announce that our St Stephen’s Week this year will run in conjunction with The South West Fest, which is happening for the first time in over two years!\n\nThe South West Fest’s theme this year is ‘Breathe’. What better way than to take a moment to ourselves and breathe in the atmosphere during one of our varied and wonderful events. From moving music, to energetic Zumba, to joining us for a relaxing cup of tea at one of our many events, there is bound to be something for everyone.\n\nWe look forward to celebrating our community in all the activities we are hosting and hope very much that you will join us and even bring a friend!\n\nRevd Graham Buckle, Vicar\n\nWednesday 15th June 2022​\n\nWednesday 8th June 2022\n\nHOW DID THAT HAPPEN?\n\nAt the end of February this year I received an email informing me that I had been chosen to receive the 2021 Jill Smythies Award from the Linnean Society of London. The Society, based in Burlington House, Piccadilly, was founded in 1788 when James Edward Smith bought the plant, animal specimens and library of Carolus Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist who had died ten years previously. It was Linnaeus who developed the system of classifying and naming of living organisms that we continue to use today. The Linnaean collections still reside in Burlington House. The Jill Smythies Award is, in contrast, only 36 years old. It recognises the scientific work of botanical illustrators. Normally, only one award is made per year, sometimes no award is made. Recipients cannot propose themselves. Samples of their published illustrations are subject to scrutiny by the selection panel and a decision is made. When the email arrived my first thought was that I might be the subject of a hoax, it was such a surprise! On 24 May I was presented with my (silver) medal showing the young Linnaeus drawing a plant of Linnaea borealis, the twin-flower, a very small sweet-smelling plant of the honeysuckle family which grows in the far North of Scandinavia.\n\nWhy am I telling this story? I need to go back to Paris between 1916 and 1918 where my paternal grandfather was driving lorries for the Royal Flying Corps. He met my French grandmother and they married in 1918 shortly before he brought her back to England and civilian life in Wandsworth. He had, in Paris, a small watercolour box (8 colours) and I have two small paintings by him of Versailles and Fontainebleau. How many young servicemen went to war with their watercolours? He drove vans for a living and, later in life, was a lift-attendant but he always enjoyed work with wood and I have a chess set that he created with a lathe and hand-carving. My maternal grandfather was a signwriter for all his working life.\n\nI lived with my parents in the same small suburban house as my paternal grandparents. Grandpa loved gardening and we went to Kew Gardens, on the bus, a couple of times each year. I remember when I was about eight years old seeing a hand-coloured plant illustration on the wall of Museum No. 1 (now a destination restaurant opposite the Palm House) at Kew and I tried to reproduce it from memory with my paints when I got home.\n\nDuring my childhood and teenage years I continued to draw and paint, very often images of plants. I went on to read Botany at university, then did a PhD on the vegetational history of Southwest England and might have become an academic but there were no jobs available at the time in my research field. We were expecting our first child and, needing an income, having enjoyed teaching undergraduates, I went to teach Biology in the independent sector and spent 25 years at Westminster School. Whilst there, in 1985, I had the privilege to travel with three colleagues and ten pupils for a few weeks to the wilderness of the Brooks Range of Alaska, the most northerly mountains in Northwest USA. I drew the plants and, on my return, worked the drawings up into paintings which I was invited to show at the Linnean Society! Then they were shown at an RHS show in Vincent Square where I was awarded my first RHS medal – a Silver Gilt. I continued my teaching of Biology and my exhibiting at the RHS and was then asked to work for botanists at the Herbarium at Kew Gardens.\n\nI said to the man who had asked me that I could not work for Kew because I had a full-time teaching job, so he said ‘Work for us when you retire!’ At the time, my wife Jane was suffering ongoing multiple medical issues and we had talked about my retiring early to get on with my illustration. Sadly, Jane succumbed to sepsis and died in June 1999. Two years later I took early retirement from Westminster and had some time to myself with no particular commitments. But in 2002 I started work at Kew and have been there, getting busier ever since (and commuting – which I never had to do in my teaching life!)\n\n​What happens in the Herbarium? It is a collection of nearly 8 million pressed, dried plants from around the world. It is added to continuously. Many of the incoming plants have never been described by botanists and, though it sounds old-fashioned, the ideal description of a ‘new species’ will have a black and white (pen and ink) illustration to show all the relevant diagnostic features. These days, of course, there may be wonderful smart-phone photographs available, but no single photo can summarise what can be shown by an artist’s illustration. The description will also include an announcement of the name (the LINNEAN name!) of the new species. There is a team of about a dozen (freelance) artists who the botanists commission to record the specimens. Many of the artists are elderly but, as long as their eyesight is fine and their hand steady, age is no barrier!\n\nIn twenty years I have made observations (using a microscope – everything has to be measured and drawn to an appropriate scale) of 840 species including new species, species for floras (I have worked on the Flora of Iraq, the Flora of Singapore, Flora Zambesiaca and four or five others), revisions of classification and a monograph of all the species of birch around the world. Latterly, much of my work involves species under threat from environmental degradation, particularly in West Africa. I personally can’t do anything to save the habitats, but I can help provide the evidence about a region’s vulnerability by supporting the reports by botanists.\n\nWhy am I writing this? Firstly, because Graham Buckle invited me to do so, but secondly, at the age of 74 and the approach of the end of life, I am so grateful that, with a quarter of each of my grandfathers’ genes and no training in ‘art’ I have had an enriching unsought second career during which I have been able to use my talent to support science and, hopefully, at least reduce the amount of damage we are doing to our planet’s ecosystems. It is a privilege to work each week with botanists and other artists. It keeps me sane and fulfils my creative urge - the urge which first made itself apparent at the age of eight after a visit to Kew. I have come home.\n\nThanks be to God.\n\nAndrew Brown\n\nWednesday 1st June 2022\n\nComing from a Commonwealth country and having travelled for work to many countries my experience has been that if someone says these two words, “the Queen” everyone in the room knows who is being referred to, no matter where you are. This is due in part to the longevity of the Queen’s reign plus how she has conducted herself and how she has travelled and set out to meet people everywhere. For the Jubilee celebrations this has resulted in a little remarked assumption held by everyone. That is, everyone feels they can naturally join in the celebrations, the street parties, etc, no matter where they are from, whether Nairobi or Latvia, Swanage or Sydney.\n\nThat everyone feels they can naturally join in the Jubilee no matter where they come from can help encourage us at St Stephen’s in how important it is to be welcoming. That when people pass by St Stephen’s they naturally feel they can come in because, even if they don’t have faith, they recognise that Jesus welcomes everyone and that church people will do this as well. Fortunately being welcoming is what St Stephen’s is known for and as the pandemic recedes we are seeing more and more tourists coming into church in numbers similar to before Covid. Our vergers, Tony and Alex, are often the first point of physical contact for visitors and Jessie in the office the first phone contact many people have. We need to remember and pray for Tony, Alex and Jessie in this vital contact ministry with people popping into the church.\n\nSides-people are the other, vital, first point of contact in showing the face of Jesus to people at St Stephen’s on Sundays. Just welcoming someone as they walk in the door can be crucial especially if someone is not just unfamiliar to St Stephens or very uncertain about what they should do or say. This is a crucial ministry amongst our many ministries; it would be great if being a sides-person is something everyone would consider being involved in. So as we give thanks for the Queens reign, when we come together this weekend, let’s continue to be steadfast in welcoming as the Queen has been in putting herself before people everywhere and as Christ put himself before people for the sake of eternity.\n\nO Lord, the Way, the Truth, and the Life,\n\nwe give you thanks for your servant Elizabeth our Queen.\n\nMay she ever be provided with all she may need\n\nfor her ministry among us,\n\nstrengthened to meet every demand\n\nwhich her office may make,\n\nand in all things nourished by your word and example,\n\nwho with the Father and the Holy Spirit live and reign,\n\nworld without end.\n\nAmen.\n\nRev Jeremy Cavanagh, SSM curate\n\nWednesday 25th May 2022\n\n​​We are so fortunate to have Revd Michael Redman help us navigate through the great religions of the world and how we share our faith.

Amen\n\nBishop Allan John Kannemeyer, Pretoria, Southern Africa\n\nApril 4, Monday in the Fifth Week of Lent\n\nReason to Hope\n\nOn January 26 of this year, The New York Times reported a California Redwood forest was returned to native tribes who were descended from the original occupants.\n\nIn Mendocino County, 523 acres of ancient redwoods were harvested by loggers, leaving nothing but stumps. Fortunately, 200 acres remained untouched and are still filled with old-growth redwoods.\n\nThe land was the hunting, fishing and ceremonial grounds of indigenous tribes, until it was taken from them by European settlers. A redwood conservation organization, the Save the Redwoods League, purchased the land and transferred ownership of the property to the Intertribal Sinkyone Wilderness Council.\n\nThe tribes will serve as guardians of the land in partnership with the Save the Redwoods League. Sam Hodder, the chief executive of the League, said, “In this process, we have an opportunity to restore balance in the ecosystem and in the communities connected to it.”\n\nMary Jane Gocher, Holy Trinity (Church tours & environmental stewardship)\n\nApril 1, Friday in the Fourth Week of Lent\n\nA Fools Hope\n\nOur culture influences us to construe hope in a certain way. Often hope equates to a manifest certainty brought about by our actions. The following two quotes remind me to reflect on hope as foolishness to the world and surprise at potentials far greater than my limited imagination and will to power.\n\n“There never was much hope. Just a fool’s hope.” — Gandalf the White, Lord of the Rings\n\n“May God bless you with enough foolishness to believe that you really can make a difference in this world, so that you are able, with God’s grace, to do what others claim cannot be done.” — Sr. Ruth Marlene Fox, OSB, A Non-Traditional Blessing\n\nCalvyn du Toit, Holy Trinity (Theologian and Sunday Evening Musician)\n\n​​​To download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\n​\n\nMarch 31, Thursday in the Fourth Week of Lent\n\nExperiencing the world around us gives me hope, particularly in the garden at this time of year. As the days get longer, the signs of new life are all around. The sweet box next to my front door has a wonderful honey-like scent. The camellia is covered with voluptuous blousy flowers and the bashful hellebores are emerging. The daffodils are coming through, with just one in flower now but the promise of many more. There are new shoots on the roses and clematis which will be a mass of flowers in just a few months’ time. The sound of the joyful birdsong from the trees is uplifting. I love to watch the redwings feasting on the last of the berries on the tree outside my bedroom window and the robin following me around the garden hoping I will have exposed a tasty morsel.\n\nThe circumstances in which some gardens feature in the bible do not provide signs of hope, but this cannot take away the joy of experiencing God in the world just outside the door of our homes.\n\nAs Jesus tells us: “See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labour or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendour was dressed like one of these.”\n\nAlison Neilson, St. Stephen’s (Bursar)\n\n​​​To download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\n​\n\n​30th March 2022\n\nIt's been fantastic since Covid restrictions have eased to be able to pick up one aspect of our developing musical programme that got interrupted very early on by Covid - inviting visiting choirs to sing choral evensong on Thursdays, enriching our weekday liturgical and musical offering. Our Curate Helena has previously written in these Devotions about some of the history and background of the evensong service. Choral evensong is a beautifully rich liturgy to which anyone can turn up for space and time to reflect, pray, or simply be still; they can actively engage as much or as little as suits their spiritual or mental state, kind or degree of faith, or interests; and they can do this while listening to a variety of wonderful musical settings of the daily prayer texts - such as the canticles, the Magnificat and Nunc dimittis - and anthems fitting the day's and season's themes. This service being a regular offering, especially on weekdays, is very associated with cathedrals and university and college chapels; but it's also an important and valuable offering in our parish churches for all and any members of our communities, or those visiting and passing through, to have the opportunity to pause, pray, and be lifted up spiritually and emotionally, aided by glorious music, during the week as well as in regular Sunday worship.\n\nThe aim was and is to have these Thursday Choral Evensongs sung by visiting choirs approximately once a month, around the 3rd Thursday of each month, perhaps sometimes shifting as the liturgical calendar dictates. To invite other choirs facilitates links and partnerships with other institutions - like churches, schools, universities, organisations - and individuals, thereby enriching the variety of people and music that our church welcomes. Westminster School Chapel Choir very kindly sang the first of these evensongs just before Covid lockdown hit in 2020, and when it was possible in 2021 we were delighted they sang again; they sang most recently on Thursday 3rd March 2022 - do follow the link below to a recording of this service to get a taste of what the service is like. Our Associate Musicians Floreat have also sung for Thursday evensong, and we've had many expressions of interest from a variety of types of choir; with some of the uncertainty around Covid regulations last year there was some hesitancy from some choirs to book dates, but we look forward to welcoming a number of different choirs, as well as those we are already associated with, to sing in the coming months.\n\nThe next Thursday Choral Evensong is THIS Thursday 31st March at 6pm, when the newly formed Hertford Chamber Choir, directed by Manvinder Rattan - an excellent friend to St Stephen's! - will sing music by William Smith, Charles Villiers Stanford, and Claudio Monteverdi. All are very welcome.\n\nDo look out, too, for information about more of these choral evensongs, as well as several other aspects of our music. Our Lent Friday organ recital series continues on Fridays 1st and 8th April at 13:15, featuring respectively Peter Stevens (Assistant Master of Music at Westminster Cathedral) and our very own Organist Emeritus Rosemary Field. Our own Choir of St Stephen's sings Choral Evensong this Passion Sunday 3rd April at 6pm. And we have exciting musical events in the pipeline for the Easter term too, including for St Stephen's Week at the end of June...!\n\nMatthew Blaiden\n\nChoral Evensong sung by Westminster School Chapel Choir 3.3.22\n\nFourth Week in Lent\n\nAlmighty God you have called many to serve you in different kinds of ministries in your church. We pray for men and women throughout the Anglican Communion, called to be evangelists. May they be inspired and strengthened by the divine power of your Holy Spirit. We pray that the mission work of the Church will continue to reach out to the world, so that, through their lives and teaching, your glory may be revealed.

Right now, you can only see the fuzzy bud scales, protecting the magnolia blossoms from the cold. (The buds are called “bracts.”) The bud scales last until the blossoms flower in the spring. To me, the bud scales represent what supports us in our hopes. We protect and define our desires. We work towards our hopes. We protect our hopes so that they can “blossom.” We cannot be bystanders. Our hopes are a means to reach a goal.\n\nErlinda Brent, Holy Trinity (Parish Secretary, Volunteer, Community Leader)\n\n​To download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\nMarch 25, Friday in the Third Week of Lent\n\nOn All Saints’ Sunday, I heard the names of the beloved dead from our parish and families of our parish. As I heard the names, I thought especially about my grandfather, who passed away a few years ago. He was a white “Boer” – that means farmer. He was committed to producing the best corn and milk in the northwest of South Africa. He was a man of a different time with values and actions that I deeply disagree with today. I think he could never have imagined that his name would be read out loud in an Episcopal Church, in a foreign country, in a different language. The time he lived through was more comfortable and familiar with similarity than difference. Despite all his failings, he was remembered, his name spoken by a stranger different from him, a stranger that he never knew. To me, that is a sign of Hope. Embracing our differences and hoping that acceptance becomes the new normal. I invite you to think about what gives you hope and where you can sow tiny seeds of Hope.\n\nChristine du Toit, Holy Trinity (Vestry member, Parish Treasurer)\n\nTo download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\n​\n\nMarch 24, Thursday in the Third Week of Lent\n\nThere is one body and one spirit\n\nThere is one hope to which we were called\n\nOne Lord, one faith, one baptism\n\nOne God and Father of all\n\n(Ephesians 4:4)\n\nTrue happiness is only found,\n\nWhere grace and truth and love abound\n\n(from Thomas Morrell’s libretto to Handel’s dramatic oratorio Theodora).\n\nGraham’s request of me to write on the theme of hope was a timely one, as (although he didn’t at the time know), my confirmation was imminent (one is never too old…). It took place in Westminster Abbey a few days ago and was entirely and joyously life-enhancing, not only because of the love of my dearest friends who came along in support, but because of the radiance that emanated from and to everyone present in that vast and magnificent building at that special time. As the priest and author Richard Giles says, ‘the great thing to remember about a sacrament is this: that God always turns up’…\n\nA significant part of my decision came from experience of being welcomed, for what I am, as a godmother to two small children. Every moment spent with them, and the extended godparental family that their remarkable parents have woven together, represents the culmination of everything I have ever needed – friendship, tolerance, love, understanding, community and, yes, hope. The hope that these children grow to lead fulfilling lives and that I will remain part of them for, well, for ever.\n\nSome would say that Christians’ hope is in the existence of an afterlife, but I demur: if there were none, the earthly journey alone would be no less enriching, no less virtuous, no less worthwhile, no less full of hope.\n\nThe raptur'd soul defies the sword,\n\nSecure of virtue's claim,\n\nAnd trusting Heav'n's unerring word,\n\nEnjoys the circling flame.\n\nNo engine can a tyrant find,\n\nTo storm the truth-supported mind.\n\n(from Theodora)\n\nLooking back at the Confirmation service, where every single word was relevant and true and resonated with emotion, the verses of the hymn come to mind. For yes, I hope for all of these, and to be loved in return.\n\nBe Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;\n\nBe all else but naught to me, save that Thou art;\n\nBe Thou my best thought in the day and the night,\n\nBoth waking and sleeping, Thy presence my light.\n\nBe Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;\n\nBe Thou ever with me, and I with Thee, Lord;\n\nBe Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son;\n\nBe Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.\n\nFor the full version of this cf http://www.sswsj.org/weekly-devotion.html\n\nGilly French, St. Stephen’s (Congregant.

One of changing seasons in the natural world, and one of the church calendar. Over the last couple of years we have not cleared all of the Autumn leaves, yet we still had Spring. In 2020 we bought very few presents and didn’t buy a turkey, yet we still had Christmas.\n\nMy 6 year-old has no concept of life pre-lockdown, and as adults we have lost track of time Where did those last two years go? How can we already be starting our third pandemic year?!\n\nThe cycles of the changing seasons of the natural world continue; the leaves of spring bulbs are starting to appear in the parks and the birds are making their nests. In his hymn, Most High, Omnipotent, Good Lord, St Francis of Assisi sings about this cyclical nature of the day and of human life – see verses 2 and 3 below - And, as one of my favourite verses for difficult times reminds us: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever” (Hebrews 13:8). That is what gives me hope.\n\n2 My Lord be praised by brother sun\n\nwho through the skies his course doth run,\n\nand shines in brilliant splendour;\n\nwith brightness he doth fill the day,\n\nand signifies thy boundless sway.\n\n3 My Lord be praised by sister moon\n\nand all the stars, that with her soon\n\nwill point the glittering heavens.\n\nLet wind and air and cloud and calm\n\nand weathers all, repeat the psalm.\n\nJen Adam, St. Stephen’s, (Ordinand, Toddler Group Coordinator at St Stephen’s)\n\n​To download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\n​\n\nThird Week in Lent\n\nGracious and loving Father, we thank you that in spite of the hardship and devastating effects of this present pandemic, this is your world over which you have full control. We thank you for the gifts of love, hope, and resilience through the redemptive work of Christ Jesus. We pray to you to keep our faith alive, grant us the grace to live out our faith in you through loving service to all in need. Help us to live sacrificially so that we may preserve your creation for the next generation. We ask this through Christ our Lord.\n\nDr Josiah Idowu-Fearon, Secretary General of the Anglican Communion Office\n\nMarch 21, Monday in the Third Week of Lent\n\nI gain hope most of all from the courageous witness of land and water protectors in North America and around the world, who are willing to risk their personal safety and incarceration to oppose the construction of pipelines and other infrastructure of the rapacious fossil fuel industry.\n\nMany of these land and water protectors are members of Indigenous nations. While most Indigenous peoples do not share our Christian faith tradition, all of us could learn from their deep reverence for the land, which has nourished them and their ancestors for millennia. It is to people like these that we must turn to find hope for the possibility of a habitable Earth for future generations.\n\nSteve Knight, Holy Trinity (Environmental Stewardship)\n\nTo download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\n​\n\n​March 18, Friday in the Second Week of Lent\n\nEaster\n\nTwo of the fingers on his right hand\n\nhad been broken\n\nso when he poured back into that hand it surprised\n\nhim— it hurt him at first.\n\nAnd the whole body was too small.

In exploring the experiences around us that we enjoy - good company, nature, reading, our practices (fitness, walking, or prayer, to name a few, you can come up with your own ideas) - we get a better feel for what excites and motivates us. Then Hope is the tilting into that enjoyment, it’s the prospect of having a life ahead of us where we can experiment, play and explore. Sometimes in our own company, and maybe sometimes with others in community. In my work, as a yoga teacher, this is best explained through embodiment, bodily awareness as the starting point for everything. Then from there, as a foundation, there is greater connection with our spiritual growth and experience, and in our interpersonal relationships. Hope is a process as it’s always unfolding in front of us, it is truly abundant, and also needs some love, care and nurturing to fully flourish. Hope is not an end point, nor is it something that can be owned, purchased in the capitalist or consumerist sense. We are all born intrinsically rooted in beautiful hope, we just sometimes need to lose a few layers for all the possibilities to flow out.\n\nCharles Smith, St. Stephen’s (Online Yoga Instructor)\n\n​To download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\nMarch 16, Wednesday in the Second Week of Lent\n\nWhat is serious to men is very often trivial in the sight of God. What in God may appear to us as “play” is perhaps what He Himself takes most seriously. At any rate the Lord plays and diverts Himself in the garden of His creation, and if we could let go of our own obsession of what we think is the meaning of it all, we might be able to hear His call and follow Him in His mysterious, cosmic dance. We do not have to go very far to catch echoes of that game, and of that dancing. When we are alone on a starlit night; when by chance we see the migrating birds in autumn descending on a grove of junipers to rest and eat; when we see children in a moment when they are really children; when we know love in our own hearts; or when, like the Japanese poet Basho we hear an old frog land in a quiet pond with a solitary splash—at such times the awakening, the turning inside out of all values, the “newness”, the emptiness and the purity of vision that make themselves evident, provide a glimpse of the cosmic dance.\n\nFor the world and time are the dance of the Lord in emptiness. The silence of the spheres is the music of a wedding feast. The more we persist in misunderstanding the phenomena of life, the more we analyze them out into strange finalities and complex purposes of our own, the more we involve ourselves in sadness, absurdity, and despair. But it does not matter much, because no despair of ours can alter the reality of things, or stain the joy of the cosmic dance which is always there. Indeed, we are in the midst of it, and it is in the midst of us, for it beats in our very blood, whether we want it to or not.\n\nYet the fact remains that we are invited to forget ourselves on purpose, cast our awful solemnity to the winds and join in the general dance. -- “The Cosmic Dance” Thomas Merton (New Seeds of Contemplation)\n\nJoe Lipuma, Holy Trinity (Vestry Member, HTNC Board Member)\n\n​​To download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\n​\n\nMarch 15, Tuesday in the Second Week of Lent\n\n\"Hope\"\n\nI was inspired in my contribution one Saturday evening as I was preparing and organising the music for the Sunday: I noticed a hymn the next morning would be \"All my hope on God is founded\", with words by Robert Bridges based on original German lyrics by Joachim Neander, set to a wonderful tune by one of my favourite composers Herbert Howells - and I thought it would be ideal for the theme of this year's Lent book. Not only because of the first line of the text, but also because the rest of the text is so widely-encompassing, making it one of those hymns you can turn to pretty much any time or season. It ranges from the cosmic and eternal in verses 2 and 3 - earthly human vanities come and go, but God is constant sanctuary and source of light and rebirth to whole worlds - to the everyday and personal, guiding us through times of change and uncertainty, calling 'my heart to be his own', being 'my temple and my tower', 'Daily' giving us 'Bounteous gifts'. And it all comes together in the final promise that God's way will sustain us: 'Christ doth call / One and all: / Ye who follow shall not fall'. Below are the words in full.\n\nA great recording of the hymn to sing along can also be found below:\n\nMarch 14, Monday in the Second Week of Lent 2\n\nHope is defined as the desire for something accompanied by an expectation of OR belief in the fulfillment of that something. For instance, the something, as a Christian, could be our salvation at our death or the vision of God or eternal life.\n\nGrowing up I was exposed to a belief of Faith that these would occur. As the years went by my religious knowledge grew. It became apparent that Faith alone was not enough and that there had to be something else growing too. This was what I dubbed \"Religious Hope'. For me this is a hope that has become more and more a positive thinking and less of a wish.\n\nFinally, as I have moved into my later years, I noticed that I have a confidence in what the ultimate future has for me. It keeps me working on projects and doing activities that have a sole purpose in mind. It is no longer hope for the future but a sure thing.\n\nMay everyone be exposed to this transition of hope to a reality.\n\nFrank Doyle, Holy Trinity (Daily Office Participant through Zoom, Vestryperson and volunteer at St. Mary’s Episcopal Church, Mohegan Lake, NY)\n\nTo download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\n​\n\nMarch 11, Friday in the First Week of Lent\n\nWhat inspires me and continues to give me hope.\n\nMost important to me is who has inspired me. I was blessed to be born to Roland and Jeanne Charbonnel and “you know they are Christians by their love” is how I remember them.\n\nThey lived through the depression, causing them never to waste, I think they were the first recyclers! They did not “build up treasures on earth”.\n\nI inherited a love for gardening from my parents. This love has rubbed off onto my husband Frank.\n\nDuring Covid, gardening gave us a purpose and kept us sane for two years. Sometimes our hectic lives need us to “Be still and know that God is there”. Each time we plant a seed we know God made it and it gives us hope that something wonderful will grow.\n\nIris Doyle, Holy Trinity (Daily Office Participant through Zoom, Vestryperson and volunteer at St. Mary’s Episcopal Church, Mohegan Lake, NY)\n\n​\n\nTo download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\n​\n\nMarch 10, Thursday in the First Week of Lent\n\n“What hope is there” was my immediate response to the suggestion I might write about it. What gleaming future do the young of today have to look forward to? The hotting up if the planet, exorbitant fuel costs, world threats from Russia and China, a government in disarray with very few world leaders worthy of respect, chaos in education, what encouragement and hope is there? And for me, when you are past 90 and must depend on others for any expedition beyond the front door, the hopes grow very limited except for a longing for a better future for my loved ones, and for a quiet night and a perfect end.\n\nAnd then I thought how elastic hope is. There are so many long and short hopes. It is a long, long hope that the world’s people will change to contain the warming of the planet to a reasonable level for life to go on, and there are short hopes that a friendly neighbour will come to tea this afternoon. For me I can no longer hope to go on expeditions to explore the world, but I can hope for some kindly friend or family member can take me to a picture gallery, or for university life to return to normal for the students in the family.\n\nI turned to the dictionaries for a definition of hope. “Expectation and desire combined with feeling of trust : to look with expectation and desire” says the Oxford. My ancient Chambers declares it is “to cherish” a desire of good with the expectation of obtaining it, belief in the prospect of obtaining: confidence, hopeful anticipation. The Readers’ Digest offers “expectation and desire combined”, and adds the archaic meaning, “feeing of trust”.\n\nAll these definitions are uplifting and positive. “All our hope on God is founded” the hymn tells the believer. Then, one wonders, why God allowed the pandemic. Is it a warning to mankind that “the end is nigh” for the world that has so neglected Him? At 91 it is hard to see hope with the dictionary definitions that so depend on the confidence of expectation. And yet, and yet, life is full of short hopes: the catkins on tree, the visit of a daughter from across the world, the success of students in the family, the neighbour coming to tea.\n\nThere are many things to hope for that I shall not live to see, so I concentrate on shorter hopes and return again to the hymn, “All my hopes on God are founded: he doth still my trust renew.” That is a prayer. Do I have a long term hope of something more, or just a blacking out of all hopes and fears? Or can I cling to the hope at the ending of that hymn, “Christ doth call one and all: he who follow shall not fall.”\n\nMargaret Duggan, St. Stephen’s, (Congregant, Retired Journalist for Church Times)\n\nTo download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\n​\n\nMarch 9, Wednesday in the First Week of Lent\n\nExpression of Hope\n\n“Waking up this morning, I smile.

As a teenager, Fox was diagnosed with cancer, and while the treatment was successful, it came at the cost of his right leg. He began distance running with a prosthetic leg, and in 1980 announced that he would run a Marathon of Hope across Canada from east to west in order to raise money for cancer research, setting a goal of raising C$1 for every citizen of Canada at the time - a total of C$23 million (about $55 million USD today).\n\nIn April of that year, Fox began his journey in Newfoundland and ran the equivalent of a marathon per day for 143 days until, outside of Thunder Bay, Ontario, he fell ill and could not continue; the cancer had returned. Although he could not complete the Marathon of Hope, Fox had inspired Canadians and people around the world, and the donations kept pouring in. Sadly, Terry Fox passed away the following summer, but not before reaching his fundraising goal.\n\nTerry Fox’s legacy continues. The foundation started in his name has organized an annual Terry Fox Run in Canada and sixty other countries. Since 1981, millions of runners have participated, raising over C$850 million ($665 million USD) and counting.\n\nCongregant, Holy Trinity\n\n​To download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\n​\n\nFriday 4th March\n\nHolding Steady\n\nSparks gone viral\n\nsteal our breath and flourish\n\nin our lungs\n\nwe struggle to live..\n\nThink of a mountain,\n\nthrust up over\n\ninconceivable time\n\na spike on a death graph.\n\nSteady on the mountain!\n\nAlthough we humans\n\nbend in the Covid wind,\n\ngrass grows, trees leaf out,\n\npink roses bloom in a haze\n\nof blue spired sage.\n\nA promise has been kept.\n\nSteady on Spring\n\nOur dog, Daisy, unafraid.\n\nruns like a tornado\n\nthrough our rooms\n\nskidding at the corners,\n\nthen curls up trustfully\n\nbetween us to rest,\n\nSteady on Daisy!\n\nPatsy Weille, Holy Trinity (Poet & Coordinator of Trinity Cares)\n\n​To download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\nThursday 3rd March\n\nAs we look toward this season of lent and how we can prepare to celebrate the day God’s amazing rescue plan was put into action, I am reminded of my favourite bible verse.\n\n“For I know the plans I have for declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you and hope and a future” Jeremiah 29 :11\n\nLife is unpredictable. It is confusing and often, we don’t know what is coming our way half the time. Sometimes, we can’t even see what the next month looks like. But that is why it is so important to look back on this scripture and know that this promise God made is also made to us as well. God has plans for us, we just might not know what they are yet. But there is always hope Jesus Christ. That’s why God sent him, so we can be reunited with Christ again. God doesn’t want His people to suffer and struggle, He wants then to have an amazing and fruitful life, working together to build His church. God knows the plans he has for us and we as His people must trust that His will is what is best for our lives and futures. Let us be reminded, this Easter, that God’s plan for us is to be reunited with Him and we can hold on to the hope that he has wonderful plans over our future hopes and dreams.\n\nKim Phillips, St. Stephen’s (Children’s Apprentice)\n\nTo download our full Lent book, please click here.\n\n​\n\nWednesday 2nd March\n\nWe have all been saddened and shocked by the horrific events in Ukraine. As we watch in horror the news of the violent events unfolding, it is difficult to know what to do - we are numb and feel helpless. Today is Ash Wednesday - the start of the penitential season of Lent. It coincides with the escalation of violence and war in that region. On Sunday I asked the congregation of St Stephen’s to join me in a day of prayer and fasting for peace in Ukraine and our world today. Perhaps you might like to give up one meal or fast all day, and give what you would have spent on that meal to help the people of Ukraine to Unicef . Also please join me in prayer and use the ‘Litany for Peace’.\n\nFinally please do use our Lent Book together, which has as it theme “Hope” as we pray and hope for peace. We will be uploading the Lent book contributions Monday to Friday if you would like to follow along on our Devotions link instead.\n\nWe have a wonderful lineup of speakers preaching at our main Eucharists at 10am on Sundays during Lent.\n\nMarch 6th – Revd Cath Duce\n\nMarch 13th – Revd Jeremy Cavanagh\n\nMarch 20th – Revd John Beddingfield\n\nMarch 27th – Revd Rosemary Lain-Priestly (Mothering Sunday)\n\nYou can see all the services and study groups on our Lent Page.

I have been reflecting on being a curate first at St Saviour’s and now in this time in Beijing.\n\nI have been trying to discern what ministry looks like in being at work and amongst my colleagues here in Beijing and interacting with the people living here. Covid has meant we have spent the entire time in a quarantine bubble, not allowed out of our hotels and travelling on closed buses to our broadcasting sites. I have not seen anything of this amazing city and the only local people I have met are those who are sharing this Covid quarantine with us. From my point of view it has seemed very constrained in terms of being a minister or ‘showing’ ministry and I spent time praying for discernment.\n\nPerhaps my praying has been seeking to create for myself some visible aspect of being a minister, to show I was not wasting my time as a curate. My work colleagues have readily accepted my ordination and in some conversations I can see they are using my identity as a minister to think about their own spirituality. I have realized from these conversations it is just my being present that is important and to leave them to it unless they want to go further.\n\nI have had only fleeting contact with the hotel staff also quarantined with us and unable to see their families and loved ones but who have always been cheerful and efficient. I thought there would be no way of being a ministry presence with them. On the day we were packing up I steeped off the bus back at the hotel to be singled out by the security staff all wanting selfies with me and hugging me but not my colleagues. My colleagues and I were astonished as we had only said hello to them as they checked us each morning before we boarded the bus.\n\nReflecting on this I thought of what Helena had said in her sermon last Sunday about ‘God never being asleep on the job’ from Luke’s account of the storm on the lake. The security staff wanting selfies struck me that even though I couldn’t see how God could use me in the hotel it didn’t mean God was asleep on the job. Whether this was God doing something directly doesn’t matter it is more in being present, whether lay or ordained, it is a privilege to see God’s ever present grace in His world just in the actions and responses of people. My being present is not so much as acting on this privilege but being ready to receive it as it happens and being humble enough to discern it.\n\nJeremy Cavanagh, Self Supporting Minister, St Stephen's\n\nWednesday 16th February\n\nThere is one body and one spirit\n\nThere is one hope to which we were called\n\nOne Lord, one faith, one baptism\n\nOne God and Father of all\n\n(Ephesians 4:4)\n\nTrue happiness is only found,\n\nWhere grace and truth and love abound\n\n(from Thomas Morrell’s libretto to Handel’s dramatic oratorio Theodora).\n\nIn asking myself why I chose to embark on this journey towards confirmation, I find the answers are multifold and add up to a whole greater than the sum of the parts. Part of it comes from practical immersion into the emotionally extraordinary music of the Renaissance: it is impossible to sing the works of, say, William Byrd without an intense longing for a connection with something deeper. Another emerged out of the deaths of my parents and the acknowledgement that our relationships were complex and unfulfilled. Some of it comes from the warmth and depth of welcome that I have experienced at St Stephen’s and other local churches. All of it is underpinned by an indefinable, almost fragile yet quietly persistent sense of hope.\n\nOh, that I on wings could rise,\n\nSwiftly sailing through the skies,\n\nAs skims the silver dove!\n\nThat I might rest,\n\nFor ever blest,\n\nWith harmony and love.\n\n(from Theodora)\n\nA significant part of my decision came from experience of being welcomed, for what I am, as a godmother to two small children. Every moment spent with them, and the extended godparental family that their remarkable parents have woven together, represents the culmination of everything I have ever needed – friendship, tolerance, love, understanding, community and, yes, hope. The hope that these children grow to lead fulfilling lives and that I will remain part of them for, well, for ever.\n\nSome would say that Christians’ hope is in the existence of an afterlife, but I demur: if there were none, the earthly journey alone would be no less enriching, no less virtuous, no less worthwhile, no less full of hope.\n\nThe raptur'd soul defies the sword,\n\nSecure of virtue's claim,\n\nAnd trusting Heav'n's unerring word,\n\nEnjoys the circling flame.\n\nNo engine can a tyrant find,\n\nTo storm the truth-supported mind.\n\n(from Theodora)\n\nLooking back at the Confirmation service, where every single word was relevant and true and resonated with emotion, the verses of the hymn come to mind. For yes, I hope for all of these, and to be loved in return.\n\nBe Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;\n\nBe all else but naught to me, save that Thou art;\n\nBe Thou my best thought in the day and the night,\n\nBoth waking and sleeping, Thy presence my light.\n\nBe Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;\n\nBe Thou ever with me, and I with Thee, Lord;\n\nBe Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son;\n\nBe Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.\n\nGilly French\n\nWednesday 9th February 2022\n\nThe primary purpose of ringing the bells at St Stephen’s, or any other church, is to call people to worship. However, from time to time, we also mark events of local, national or historical importance with special performances. One such occasion was last Sunday, when we celebrated the Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The performance recorded below was rung by members of our regular Sunday service band:\n\nSt Stephen’s, Westminster\n\nSunday 6th February 2022\n\n70 Grandsire Triples\n\nPatricia Murray Cox\n\nLuke Bradley\n\nJames Belshaw *\n\nStephanie Pattenden (Conductor) *\n\nPaul Daybell\n\nLaurence Bourton\n\nSam Cave\n\nJames Ansell\n\nRung to celebrate the 70th anniversary of\n\nthe accession of HM Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nWhile this is only what we would describe as a “short touch” - its seventy changes chosen specifically to represent the seventy years since the Queen’s accession to the throne - much longer performances (i.e. “peals”) have been rung for royal occasions at St Stephen’s in the past. For example, the bells were rung for 3 hours and 16 minutes in 1887 to mark the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria; the footnote attached to this performance highlights a royal connection to the church:\n\n“This is the first peal rang in the same parish as Her Majesty the Queen [Victoria] was born…”\n\nAs jubilee celebrations continue this year I hope that we will have the opportunity to dedicate a similarly substantial performance on the same bells, which have hung in the tower since 1850.\n\nIn (relatively) recent times, the Silver Jubilee of our current queen was marked by a peal of 3 hours and 32 minutes, and the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 by a handbell peal at the church. It’s notable that at least three people who rang in the 1977 peal are still regular members of our band - two having rung with us on Sunday (these people are marked with an asterisk above).\n\nSuch dedication - reminiscent of the Queen’s own commitment to serving the country and the church - is not uncommon amongst bell ringers or members of the wider church community. Many of those lucky enough to live to an old age with good health celebrate their fiftieth, sixtieth or even seventieth anniversaries of ringing. We are thankful for these people, who still turn up every week to ring with us, and their attitude is certainly an appropriate subject for a “weekly devotion”.\n\nYears of commitment to a community or service are not always easy, but they are rewarding. Not only do they bring knowledge, skills and experience, they also enrich our lives by broadening our horizons, providing opportunities for us to meet new people from all sorts of backgrounds, and helping us to better understand and collaborate with each other. Having learned to ring at around the age of ten, I hope that one day I might also reach a significant personal jubilee.\n\nLaurence Bourton\n\nRinging Master\n\nSt Stephen’s, Westminster\n\nAlmighty God, the fountain of all goodness,\n\nbless our Sovereign Lady, Queen Elizabeth,\n\nand all who are in authority under her;\n\nthat they may order all things\n\nin wisdom and equity, righteousness and peace,\n\nto the honour and glory of your name\n\nand the good of your Church and people;\n\nthrough Jesus Christ your Son our Lord,\n\nwho is alive and reigns with you,\n\nin the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n\none God, now and for ever.\n\nAmen.\n\nWednesday 2nd February 2022\n\nThough we celebrated on Sunday, today, 2 February, is officially the feast day of Candlemas, also called Presentation of the Lord or Presentation of Christ in the Temple or Hypapante (in the Greek church “Hypapante” - Meeting, referring to Jesus’ meeting in the Temple with Simeon). It marks the occasion when Mary, in obedience to Jewish law, went to the Temple in Jerusalem, both to be purified 40 days after the birth of Jesus, and to present him to God as her firstborn (Luke 2:22–38).\n\nIt also marks the end of the season of Christmastide, our decorations will be taken down, and our tree will begin to look like a cross, as our attention turns towards Lent and our preparations for Christ’s passion. But today we pause to reflect how the child who was manifested to the magi is recognised by Simeon and Anna, when he comes to be presented in the Temple according to the Law of Israel. He is both ‘a light to lighten the Gentiles’ and ‘the glory of God’s people Israel’.\n\nLight is the key theme, and on Sunday we lit candles and took them away with us into the world - the communities we are apart. Symbolically taking Christ with us into our lives and sharing his light with others we meet. I love this painting by Rembrandt, ‘Presentation of Jesus in the Temple’, which really depicts the Lukan narrative of the light shining in the midst of the gathered peoples within the darkness of the Temple precincts, and the affect of that light (Christ) on others.\n\n​We often come across such depictions of light vs darkness in our own lives, which emphasises how the Christ of light often penetrates those darker elements we encounter. I was lucky enough to catch the wonderful light exhibition by Bruce Munro in Chichester Cathedral’s 600 year old Cloisters. https://www.chichestercathedral.org.uk/events/field-blooms The artwork, “Field of Bloom” comprised of 1000 stems of lights, which gently illuminated spheres of light, gradually change and morph in colour. Describing his work, Bruce Munro said: “I wanted to create field of light stems that, like the dormant seed in a dry desert, would quietly wait until darkness falls and then under a blazing blanket of southern stars bloom with gentle rhythms of light”\n\nI personally found it such an uplifting experience, the combination of colour and light within the grounds and backdrop of this ancient cathedral literally ‘lit’ me up spiritually, particularly as the day was being over taken by the darkness of the night. It reminded of Christ’s light penetrating those dark arenas and areas of our lives and world. I was reminded of Candlemas.As part of your weekly devotion do ponder on this picture I took of the exhibition or Rembrandt’s wonderful painting. Use them, together with this prayer, as a symbol of renewal and energy in your spiritual lives and may Christ’s light burn bright within you.\n\nLord Jesus Christ,\n\nlight of the nations and glory of Israel:\n\nmake your home among us,\n\nand in our world today,\n\nand present us pure and holy\n\nto your heavenly Father,\n\nyour God, and our God. Amen.\n\n​Revd Graham Buckle\n\nWednesday 26th January 2022\n\n​Lighten our darkness, we beseech thee, O Lord;\n\nand by thy great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers of this night;\n\nfor the love of thy only Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ.\n\nAmen.\n\nAs we pray this great prayer asking God to defend us from darkness, we say it as part of a great community of Christians stretching back through the centuries. When we come to a service of Evensong, we are praying not only with those in the pews with us, but with those around the world who will pray the same service, and with those throughout history who, like us, have wished for an end to darkness. As I head home from the service towards my own rest, I find that a great comfort.\n\nPlease do join us for our Choral Evensong this Thursday 20th January, which will be sung by Floreat with wonderful music from Orlando Gibbons and William Byrd.\n\n​\n\nRevd Helena Bickley-Percival\n\nThursday 13th January 2022\n\nThursday 23rd December\n\nA very happy and blessed Christmas to you all!\n\n​This will be our last Weekly Devotion until the New Year, and we hope you all continue well and safe until then.\n\nThursday 16th December\n\nThis Sunday, at Evensong, we will be reflecting on an aspect of Christmas that I’m sure we’ve all experienced, but is far from the lights and the Christmas adverts and the popular understanding of Christmas as a time of totally unalloyed joy – the fact that Christmas, for many people, is a difficult and stressful time. Last year, in conjunction with our link church in New York, we had a “Blue Christmas” service, which gave us space to reflect on the fact that Christmas can be a dark time, and this year we will be doing the same but in the context of our usual Sunday evensong.\n\nWhen I was putting our Blue Christmas Evensong service together, I suddenly ran into a problem. I wanted to have a Christmas poem in there, but one that wasn’t all tinsel and sparkles. A poem that would hold together the wonder of Christmas with the sense of struggle some will feel. In order to find my poem, I turned to Elizabeth Jennings.\n\nJennings was an extraordinary poet, who passed away in 2001 at the age of 75. She was a devout Roman Catholic all her life, and often explored her faith in her poetry, but her life was also full of struggle, particularly with her mental health, and that struggle is almost always present in her work. Sometimes, that struggle was with her faith. She once said ‘sometimes I feel that an act of imagination is more use than an act of faith.’ So, this Sunday, we will be hearing part of Elizabeth Jennings’s Christmas Sequence, which ends:\n\n​\n\nO let us, even in our fear, join hands,\n\nAs we think of a story that is old,\n\nYet new each year. It is a mystery\n\nHow God took time and entered history.\n\n​​Revd Helena Bickley-Percival\n\nWednesday 8th December\n\nI was mulling over the first Advent of this year and, in describing it to some fellow parishioners, I started out by saying that the morning Eucharist service was, to me, an unmitigated disaster. When asked to elaborate, I mentioned a few of the issues that had gone wrong. Firstly there was the gentleman near the front, who caused some low level anxiety due to clearly struggling in controlling his emotions, voice and gestures. Then the technological problems with Zoom, prompting Graham to take the second reading, subsequently mistakenly reading out the Evensong readings, for which he apologized but continued to finish the reading. Then the interruption during Kim’s insightful sermon, by a troubled man, familiar to the church, who had been drinking and under the influence, who entered loudly to cause disruption, who then returned to apologize, again loudly, during the service. Not to mention the mix up in sheets due to reverting to pre Covid sheets, combined with the omission of the Offertory Hymn in the service sheets, causing no one bar the choir, to know what hymn we were to sing.\n\nAt the end of my reeling off of errors, I concluded by saying it was a very St Stephen’s service. Not because of the sum of errors, but because of the response TO all of these. Rather than becoming flummoxed, irritated or even annoyed by any or all of these, Graham choose to lead by example and work through them, highlighting the need for compassion and patience for all who are clearly struggling and those for whom the struggle is not so obvious. The ability to shake off errors and mistakes is not one with which I am blessed. I am by nature one who dwells constantly on mistakes I have made (such as leaving off the offertory hymn) and not so much on the final outcome. However, by moving past these errors on Sunday and coming out in a positive, inclusive and most of all compassionate manner, by the entirety of the congregation, that, to me, felt like it most exemplified the attitude of St Stephen’s congregation. After all, we are here to gather and to worship and whether or not it is perfect, it is the intent and the exemplification of that intent, which to me, shows God’s love most clearly reflected at St Stephen’s.\n\nJessie Campbell\n\nWednesday 1st December\n\nSunday 5 December\n\n​\n\nA Slow Look at Andrea di Bonaiuto da Firenze, The Virgin and Child with Ten Saints from The National Gallery\n\nThe Virgin and Child with Ten Saints, The National Gallery\n\nJoin us for a a slow look at Andrea di Bonaiuto da Firenze's The Virgin and Child with Ten Saints from The National Gallery collection. Andrea di Bonaiuto da Firenze or Andrea da Firenze (I) was an Italian painter active in Florence. He was probably born in Florence where he was active from 1343. His earliest works suggest that he must have been in close contact with the workshop of Andrea di Cione\n\nWe’ll share thoughts on the depiction of the Madonna and Child, and discuss the frame, the colours and the composition of this intriguing painting. We’ll look closely at the saints, discuss their identity and attributes, and investigate why these particular saints were chosen for this painting.\n\nLooking forward to discussing this.\n\nAll good wishes,\n\nMarc Woodhead\n\nWednesday 24th November\n\nWhilst you read this I shall be in Glasshampton Monastery on my annual silent retreat, reflecting as I always do on the year that’s been and the year ahead. This is such an important season in such an important time, particularly for the church. What is Advent, well the Church of England say in it’s introduction to this season that “Advent is a season of expectation and preparation, as the Church prepares to celebrate the coming (adventus) of Christ in his incarnation, and also looks ahead to his final advent as judge at the end of time. The readings and liturgies not only direct us towards Christ’s birth, they also challenge the modern reluctance to confront the theme of divine judgement:\n\nEvery eye shall now behold him robed in dreadful majesty.\n\n(Charles Wesley)\n\nThe Four Last Things – Death, Judgement, Heaven and Hell – have been traditional themes for Advent meditation. The characteristic note of Advent is therefore expectation, rather than penitence, although the character of the season is easily coloured by an analogy with Lent. The anticipation of Christmas under commercial pressure has also made it harder to sustain the appropriate sense of alert watchfulness, but the fundamental Advent prayer remains ‘Maranatha’ – ‘Our Lord, come’ (1 Corinthians 16.22). Church decorations are simple and spare, and purple is the traditional liturgical colour. In the northern hemisphere, the Advent season falls at the darkest time of the year, and the natural symbols of darkness and light are powerfully at work throughout Advent and Christmas. The lighting of candles on an Advent wreath was imported into Britain from northern Europe in the nineteenth century, and is now a common practice. The Moravian custom of the Christingle has similarly enjoyed great success in Britain since the latter part of the twentieth century, with the encouragement of the Children’s Society; Christingle services may take place before or after Christmas. (We have ours at St Stephen’s at the end of Christmas at Candlemas) The Third Sunday of Advent was observed in medieval times as a splash of colour in the restrained atmosphere of Advent (Gaudete or ‘Rose Sunday’), and the last days of Advent were marked by the sequence of Great ‘O’ Antiphons, which continue to inspire modern Advent hymns and meditations.”\n\nTaken from CofE Website: https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/churchs-year/times-and-seasons/advent#mmm1\n\nPlease do read my Advent letter with all the wonderful things we are doing during this wonderful season. And as part of your Weekly Devotion please pray the Advent Prayer:\n\nAlmighty God,\n\ngive us grace to cast away the works of darkness\n\nand to put on the armour of light,\n\nnow in the time of this mortal life,\n\nin which your Son Jesus Christ came to us in great humility;\n\nthat on the last day,\n\nwhen he shall come again in his glorious majesty\n\nto judge the living and the dead,\n\nwe may rise to the life immortal;\n\nthrough him who is alive and reigns with you,\n\nin the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n\none God, now and for ever. Amen.\n\nRevd Graham Buckle\n\n​\n\nWednesday 17th November\n\nAs I removed my red and white poppies from the lapel of my coat, I was reading an interesting article by the historian Dr Fiona Reid on ‘When the paper poppy became a symbol of remembrance’ in the BBC History Magazine.\n\nShe recalls that it is one hundred years ago, in 1921, that the very first paper poppies were first sold to raise money for those soldiers who had returned from the First World War. Many veterans struggled to find homes, employment and financial security, so associations were formed to campaign for their rights. There was also great anxiety in the British political establishment at the time about the implications of the Russian Revolution and postwar political radicalism across Europe. So naturally there was great support for the British Legion’s idea of selling paper poppies as a fundraising campaign to alleviate the material been political, distress that lay at the root of veteran discontent and political agitation.\n\nIn its first year over 9 million poppies were sold as well poppies, entrenching the deeply felt symbolism attached to the poppy since the 1915 publication of the poem In Flanders Fields by Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae. Throughout the 1920s, most British people chose to wear poppies every 11 November, but attempts to unify the nation in a shared memory were never completely successful.\n\nCommemorative events were scaled back during the Second World War, and poppy-wearing remained limited. It wasn’t until the 1990s when the British Legion campaigned successfully to reintroduce the two-minute silence. Since then, poppy-wearing has become wide-spread not just on Armistice Day but in the weeks leading up to 11 November. It is now unimaginable for a public figure or a BBC journalist to appear without wearing a poppy in early November.\n\n100 years of wearing poppies reminds us that the after-effects of war still endure and we still have no answers to the sociopath-political and ethical questions posed by war. However, wearing the poppy is no neutral act, and it should not be a symbol to highlight the glorification of war, but rather worn as a reminder of its tragedies.\n\nCreator God,\n\nwhose will is to restore all things in your beloved Son, the King of all:\n\ngovern the hearts and minds of those in authority,\n\nand bring the families of the nations,\n\ndivided and torn apart by the ravages of sin,\n\nto be subject to his just and gentle rule;\n\nwho is alive and reigns with you,\n\nin the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n\none God, now and for ever. Amen\n\nhttps://ignatiansolidarity.net/blog/2014/07/20/prayer-for-an-end-to-violence-war-and-death/\n\nRevd Graham Buckle\n\nWednesday 10th November\n\nI was ordained a deacon over four months ago and this week’s devotion is reflecting on what a deacon is. I guess people at St Stephen’s have also been wondering what I have been up to in these first months of my curacy while at St Saviour’s, Pimlico where I will be till Lent. While I may not have been around this experience of being a deacon has been a privilege.\n\nThe ordinal describes the role of the deacon as, ‘to serve the community in which they are set, bringing to the Church the needs and hopes of all the people’. Service is key to understanding what it is to be ordained as well as central to what we do as a congregation and this understanding is fitting as we commemorate this week the life of Martin of Tour’s in the Church calendar because his life was one of service that was selfless yet proactive. Very importantly, the context of this role of the deacon is eternity as the ordinal also says the deacon’s role is, ‘to proclaim the gospel in word and deed, as agents of God’s purposes of love’ and our ultimate model for service is Christ himself.\n\nI am finding this exclusive time as a deacon extremely valuable because by concentrating on service I can give myself over to being taught what it is to serve Christ by being ordained. In this, I am being taught by the congregations at St Stephen’s and at St Saviour’s along with Graham, Helena, Lindsay and Father Matthew at St Saviour’s. When I was ordained on that Saturday early in July I didn’t really know what to expect, now, nearly five months in I cannot imagine not having this time as a deacon. Everyone is teaching me what it is to be ordained and for that I am grateful.\n\nI remain a deacon even after I am, God willing, ordained a priest. Likewise Graham, Helena, Lindsay, Father Matthew, Bishop Sarah, etc, never stop being deacons. And because understanding how to serve as Christ served is such a valuable thing then this exclusive time as a deacon is perhaps the most important time in the life of a priest.\n\nThank you to both St Stephen’s and St Saviour’s for teaching me what it is to be ordained.\n\nA collect for Martin of Tours, first a soldier then a priest and bishop.\n\nGod all powerful,\n\nwho called Martin from the armies of this world\n\nto be a faithful soldier of Christ:\n\ngive us grace to follow him\n\nin his love and compassion for the needy,\n\nand enable your Church to claim for all people\n\ntheir inheritance as children of God;\n\nthrough Jesus Christ your Son our Lord,\n\nAmen.\n\nRevd Jeremy Cavanagh\n\nWednesday 3rd November\n\nWhat makes a saint? This is one of those questions where if you ask four people you’ll probably get eight answers. If you wanted to become a formally canonised saint in the Roman Catholic church, for example, you’d first need to be deceased, then your life would be investigated by a panel of experts, and finally you’d need two verified miracles taken place after prayers for your intercession. In the Eastern Orthodox church, a saint is defined as anyone who is in heaven, as it is communion with God that is the primary aspect of sainthood. For them to be recognised as a saint and given a day in the calendar, it must go through an ecclesiastical review, but no miracles need to have taken place.\n\nFor some, it is the miracles that make the saint – and some miracles are very bizarre indeed. A brief dip into any list of saints will produce levitations, occasional transformations, a couple of dragons, subsisting on some very odd diets, and many visions (to name a very few). I sometimes think of this as the superhero saint complex. The idea that saints are somehow imbued with superpowers that allow them to rise above the humdrum of everyday humanity. Like the costumes or armour of superheroes, they wear their halo and are surrounded by gold. These superhero saints seem to place sainthood far out of our reach, as impossible in the “real world” as Spiderman, the Hulk, or any of the other “supers” we may find in our media.\n\nThis season should act as an antidote to superhero thinking. When we celebrate all the saints, we are not just celebrating those whose stories are weird and wonderful enough to be remembered, but everyone who has led a holy and Christlike life. We do not need superpowers or miracles to be saints, but to live as Christ called us to live. After all, in Acts and in Paul’s letters, “saint” (hagios) was used to describe any fellow Christians. We are all called to be saints. We are all living our own superhero origin story.\n\n​Revd Helena Bickley-Percival\n\nWednesday 27th October\n\n​On Sunday, we start what has become known in the Church as the “Kingdom Season”, by celebrating All Saints closely followed by All Souls. Both celebrate mutual belonging and remind us that no Christian is solitary. It is through our baptism that we become members one of another in Christ, members of a company of saints whose mutual belonging transcends death. As Charles Wesley says:\n\nOne family, we dwell in him,\n\none Church, above, beneath;\n\nthough now divided by the stream,\n\nthe narrow stream of death.\n\nAll Saints’ Day celebrates people in whose lives the Church as a whole has seen the grace of God powerfully at work. It is an opportunity to give thanks for that grace, and for the wonderful ends to which it shapes our human life; it is a time to be encouraged by the example of the saints and to recall that sanctity may grow in the ordinary circumstances, as well as the extraordinary crises, of human living. The Commemoration of the Faithful Departed celebrates the saints in a more local and intimate key. It allows us to remember with thanksgiving before God those whom we have known more directly: those who gave us life, or who nurtured us in faith.\n\nRemembrance Sunday goes on to explore the theme of memory, both corporate and individual, as we confront issues of war and peace, loss and self-gift, memory and forgetting.\n\nThe annual cycle of the Church’s year and the “Kingdom Season” ends with the Feast of Christ the King. The year that begins with the hope of the coming Messiah ends with the proclamation of his universal sovereignty. The ascension of Christ has revealed him to be Lord of earth and heaven, and final judgement is one of his proper kingly purposes. The Feast of Christ the King returns us to the Advent theme of judgement, with which the cycle once more begins.\n\nThis is poignant time for us all. Not only with the pandemic which still threatens our way of life. But also of some of the horrifying acts we have witnessed on our streets recently. The tragic and unnecessary deaths of Sarah Everard by a policeman; two sisters - Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry, killed in London park; and the 28 year old teacher, Sabina Nessa, killed going to see a friend... all the countless knife-crime deaths, remind us of the fragility on our streets.\n\nI am sure I was not alone in being saddened by the slaying of Sir David Amess, five years after Jo Cox was killed outside one of her constituency surgeries, on 15 October. It is a chilling reminder of the risks our MPs run to fulfill their democratic function. They are often dismissed as “out of touch”, but are anything but. Amess was acutely aware of the dangers he faced, but like other MPs, he insisted on being not just in touch, but “physically present, personally attentive, intimately available”. His life should also remind our MPs that we do this best when we stop fighting over our differences, and instead look for common cause. As Alison McGovern MP said in The Guardian, “Empathy, understanding and compassion are what make our politics function”. This is what Jo Cox knew, and Amess knew it too,\n\nSo this time is a season to remember all the departed, to give thanks for them and to ponder on our own preparation for God’s kingdom.\n\nRest eternal grant unto them O Lord,\n\nand let light perpetual shine upon them.\n\nMay they rest in peace and rise in Christ in glory.\n\nRevd Graham Buckle\n\nWednesday 13th October\n\nWestminster Abbey has become, over the centuries, the principal place where the great and the good of the nation have been buried or memorialised. We might remember that particularly this week, as the church celebrates the life of Edward the Confessor, whose shrine at the Abbey is still a site of pilgrimage to this day. Our own founder, Baroness Burdett-Coutts is buried at the Abbey, as well as around 3,000 others ranging from Stephen Hawking to Geoffrey Chaucer.\n\nChaucer was the first writer (that we know of) who was buried in what is now called the Poet’s Corner in 1400. Although Chaucer wasn’t granted this honour because of his writing, but because of his position at court, he was joined in the South Transept in 1599 by Edmund Spenser, and the tradition of burying notable writers in the South Transept was born. By the 1700s it was so notable a trend that it began to be referred to as the Abbey’s “poetical quarter,” and the first use of the phrase “The Poet’s Corner” can be found in the title of a poem written in 1733 by Thomas Fitzgerald. Today, around 40 writers are buried in Poet’s Corner, with 70 more memorialised there.\n\nAlthough the Abbey has long, long been the resting place of notable figures, Poet’s Corner is something special. It isn’t a memorial to great feats of arms, or statesmanship, or kingship, or other more obvious types of power, but instead a memorial to the arts and the profound effect the arts can have. This is clearly emphasised in Fitzgerald’s 1733 poem mentioned above, and which I leave below for your devotion this week.\n\nWednesday 6th October 2021\n\n​I love this time of year. Not just because the light is so marvellous as the sun barely rises enhancing all the lovely vibrant autumnal colours, and the water is just the perfect temperature to swim in, but also liturgically. A time when we think and pray for God’s creation. Just take a look at the serpentine this morning - the light on the bridge and its reflection in the water is one you only get during October:\n\n​The school harvest service, our own Harvest Thanksgiving and the animal blessing services, all give us that chance to give thanks for this glorious world we live.\n\nThis is a picture of our our School Harvest this morning, where we listened to Genesis Creation Story and created our own world with gifts in church.\n\nAnd here are two pictures taken from last night’s animal blessing service:\n\nThis Sunday is our Harvest Festival of Thanksgiving which a celebration of the harvest and food grown in our land It is about giving thanks for a successful crop yield over the year as winter starts to approach. A time to give thanks for all the good and positive things in our lives such as family, friendships and our church. It is also an opportunity whilst giving thanks to give to those less fortunate and so we shall be collecting for the homeless and for the work of The Passage. Please give generously. Use these pictures, together with the collect for Harvest for your Daily Devotion this week:\n\nEternal God,\n\nYou crown the year with your goodness\n\nAnd you give us the fruits of the earth in their season;\n\nGrant that we may use them to your glory,\n\nFor the relief of those in need and for our own well-being\n\nThrough Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.\n\n​Revd Graham Buckle\n\nWednesday 29th September 2021\n\nWhat do angels look like? This Michaelmas Graham and I have asked that question of two different schools, with some really interesting answers. They have long robes, wings and halos, they are beautiful or even look like a ”perfect person” – they could even be little cherubs. So far, angels look as we expect to see them in stained glass windows, or in works of art. The exception that seems to prove the rule is St Michael, with his sword and his armour, though wings and halo usually still visible.\n\nWhen we think more deeply about what angels look like, however, the picture becomes less clear. There are various visions of heaven, and various appearances of angels in scripture. They might be six winged seraphs covered with eyes (Isaiah 6:1), they might be human-animal hybrids, or a series of interlocking wheels also covered with eyes (Ezekiel 1). They might not even be visible to us, as in the story of Balaam’s Donkey, or they might just appear as human beings, such as the three men who came to visit Abraham (Genesis 18).\n\nIt’s perhaps not so surprising that our stock image of angels has come to be the one the children described – it’s very hard to even imagine how one would depict a series of interlocking wheels covered with eyes! However, our desire for angels to be beautiful and “otherworldly,” as well as the sometimes bizarre descriptions in scripture, point to something deeper about how we think about heaven. Heaven is unknowable to us in our earthly lives, but we try to understand it using our earthly references. It must be the most beautiful, and so we imagine it populated by the most beautiful figures we can devise, and that is what we depict (it’s no accident that heaven is often described as a beautiful city made of precious stones). Visions of heaven in scripture are much more strange, and perhaps that is the result of a human mind trying to make sense of what it has seen. The effect of trying to describe the landscape of a dream, or if we put a bus in front of someone from first century Palestine and asked them to describe it.\n\nWhat do angels look like? Well, really they could look like almost anything, including things we could not imagine. On this St Michael and All Angels day, we think of these messengers and ask for their help and protection – no matter what they look like.\n\nO EVERLASTING God,\n\nwho hast ordained and constituted the services of Angels and men in a wonderful order:\n\nMercifully grant that, as thy holy Angels alway do thee service in heaven,\n\nso by thy appointment they may succour and defend us on earth;\n\nthrough Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\nAmen.\n\nRevd Helena Bickley-Percival\n\nTuesday 14th September 2021\n\nThis week on Tuesday (Sept 14th) the Christian Liturgical calendar celebrates the feast of the Holy Cross, sometimes known as Holy Rood Day. The cross on which our Lord was crucified has become the universal symbol for Christianity, replacing the fish symbol of the early church, though the latter has been revived in recent times. There are several different Feasts of the Cross, all of which commemorate the cross used in the crucifixion of Jesus. Unlike Good Friday, which is dedicated to the passion of Christ and the crucifixion, this weeks feast celebrate the cross itself, as the sign of salvation.\n\nAs I’m sure you are aware, after the end of the persecution era, early in the fourth century, pilgrims began to travel to Jerusalem to visit and pray at the places associated with the life of Jesus.
