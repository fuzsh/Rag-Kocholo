For athletes, nominees must have graduated from Westminster at least three years prior and demonstrated a clear Christian testimony while at Westminster Christian. Coaches need to have served at least 10 years as a Varsity Head Coach at Westminster and demonstrated exemplary Christian leadership and mentorship.\n\nNominations are screened by the Hall of Fame Committee, who then create a final ballot that is voted on by all members of the Westminster Hall of Fame.\n\nPlease click on the link below if you would like to formally nominate someone for consideration to the Hall of Fame."
