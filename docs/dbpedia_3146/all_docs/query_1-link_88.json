        "text": "How to begin your child's journey\n\nThe Admissions Policy of The Westminster School, Dubai comprises of Basis of Admission, Eligibility Requirements (Age, Assessments for FS1, FS2 and Years 1-11, Admissions Process and the Documents required at the time of Admission) to give you an overview on Admissions.\n\nThe School\n\nWe are an International school that belongs to the well-established Global Education Management Systems (GEMS), pioneers in the field of education in the UAE.\n\nThe Westminster School follows the National Curriculum for England from Foundation Stage 1 to Year 13 and prepares students to take the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), Advanced Subsidiary (AS) and A Level Examinations of the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford (UK).\n\nWho We Serve\n\nThe Westminster School serves the educational needs of the local and international community in Dubai and the surrounding emirates of Sharjah, Ajman and Umm Al Quwain, in particular the children of foreign nationals here on employment for whom the local UAE education system is not a viable option.\n\nWe have approximately 5200 students on our rolls and we currently have 70 nationalities. We are proud of our diverse cultural mix and the truly international flavour this brings to our school. We are a non-sectarian, co-educational institution and welcome boys and girls of all nationalities, religions and cultures.\n\nWe provide high quality education to all the children who attend the school. The school has high expectations of effort and success from all children. We believe that our children, including those identified as having additional needs, have a common entitlement to a broad and balanced academic and social curriculum.\n\nSchool Information\n\nProspective students and parents should be familiar with the school’s program and facilities. A broad outline on the school is available on the school website. The school’s registration office may be contacted for detailed information and guidelines for admission. School tours are arranged on prior appointments by the admission staff.\n\nSchedule\n\nThe school year begins in early September and is divided into three terms, the first of which ends in late December, the second in April and the third in June.\n\nBecause of the size and popularity of the school student enrollments are done quite early, beginning in November with FS1 and FS2. We have two streams in our admissions process: one for the siblings of the students already enrolled in school and the second for those new entrants who wish to join from other schools. Places fill very quickly and it is common for all places to be taken within a week of enrollments starting. The school has a waiting list with places allocated using fair and published criteria.\n\nBasis of Admission\n\nAdmission is broadly based on a review of the students’ records of past performance, age, acceptable performance on the school’s screening assessments and class numbers.\n\nAdmission to all classes is also governed by a set of guidelines from the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA), UAE. Documents of each student are verified by the officials every academic session to ensure compliance with the guidelines.\n\nWhere there is a high demand for available seats, places will be offered in the following order of priority: Emirati National students, staff children who are working at the school, students who have siblings attending the same school, students from other GEMS schools in the UAE including students from GEMS Nurseries for FS2 and Year 1 and students from other GEMS schools globally. Other students are allocated according to the date and time of Online Registration. When there is no seat available in the requested year level, an applicant is placed on the waitlist.\n\nWe recognize the importance of identification as early as possible, followed by intervention for any child who may have special education needs. Identification is carried out based on the 3 levels.\n\nEligibility Requirement\n\nAge\n\nAge is the first criteria taken into consideration for the placement of students at any year level. This is in accordance with the legislation governing the enrolments of students in private schools in Dubai. Exceptions are possible, where the child would be in a different year group in a school in the United Kingdom but only after careful evaluation has been made by the school and approved by the Executive Principal/CEO.\n\nWhen you get in touch, make sure you let us know your child's date of birth so we can accurately advise you of our admissions procedures for the various classes.\n\nAssessments\n\nEnglish is the language of instruction in all grades, and the ability to successfully access the curriculum within a reasonable time is the guiding principle for admission to the school. Hence the assessment of English becomes essential.\n\nIn the younger grades, a start in the English language curriculum is usually sufficient for children to quickly develop proficient English language skills. On this basis, children may be admitted to our Foundation Stage 1 and 2 (ages 3-5) regardless of their level of English proficiency. However, parents of children applying for older years are advised that basic competence in English is generally required in order to successfully benefit from the academic programme. At the high school level (Years 9 - 13), a relatively high degree of competency in English and Mathematics is expected.\n\nRegistration and admission for the Academic Year starting September is done online through the school website (www.gemsws-ghusais.com). Admissions to classes depend upon vacancies in those classes. There will be an entrance assessment prior to accepting the student.\n\nFoundation Stage 1 (FS 1)\n\nFor admission to Foundation Stage 1, the child must be of maximum 3 years old as on 31st August 2023.\n\nInterview procedures:\n\nApplicants of FS1 will normally undergo two stages:\n\nFirst Stage: Group Activities\n\nThe First Stage is a group activity where applicants will be assessed in the learning environment for their development of logical thinking, cognitive development (development of their senses), motor skills, creativity, and behaviour of each applicant via activities.\n\nSecond Stage: Individual Interview.\n\nIf the applicant meets the criteria for the First Stage, then the applicant will be selected for the second stage.\n\nIn the Second Stage, both the parents and applicant will be invited/interviewed. The school will select the applicant based on the following criteria:\n\nApplicant’s Performance at interview: language and cognitive abilities; social and communication skills; willingness to ask questions; care and concern about others. The candidate should be able to understand and respond to simple instructions.\n\nParents’ Performance at interview: support on school’s vision and mission; appreciation of new ideas and innovation; adequate parental support to the child, and strong commitment to the TWS and home-school cooperation.\n\nAdmission will be subject to whether the applicant is toilet trained and is able to follow simple instructions in English.\n\nFoundation Stage 2 (FS 2)\n\nFor admission to Foundation Stage 2, the child must be of maximum 4 years old as on 31st August 2023.\n\nThe child must be enrolled in a Nursery for at least 6 months to 1 year or completed FS 1 in a school. This is applicable to all children on the waiting list.\n\nThe child must be toilet trained.\n\nParents are requested to present any work done by the child while in Nursery/FS 1. This should be brought along at the time of the interview.\n\nYear 1: The child must be 5 years old as on 31st August 2023.\n\nA separate Age Placement guide is given on the website for your understanding.\n\nYears 1-10\n\nYear 1: The child must be of maximum 5 years old as on 31st August 2023.\n\nAdmission is granted on the basis of entrance assessments in English and Mathematics.
