I am forever grateful to Westminster Academy.\n\nJohn Novoa ’02, Financial Associate with Thrivent Financial\n\nI am proud to say I teach in the high school and there is no place I would rather be. Westminster Academy provides the best Christian education in South Florida. The academic standards and expectations are high and our students rise to achieve these standards.\n\nMichelle Perry, WA Upper School Faculty\n\nWestminster Academy helped train my children to be Christ-centered leaders and today they are. It has proven to be the best investment I could have made in the future of my children. Thank you, WA!\n\nDr. Bob Barnes, CEO of Sheridan House Family Ministries\n\nThrough classes at WA, I managed to gain many college credits that I used to jump-start my college education and allowed me to have the time and freedom to pursue a dual degree in Spanish and Biology. The quality of the classes at WA also prepared me for college courses, from the arts to the sciences.\n\nHannah Harms ’16, Second Generation WA Lion"
