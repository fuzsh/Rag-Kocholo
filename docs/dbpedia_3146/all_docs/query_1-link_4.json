        "text": "Open Days take place every year in the Spring and Autumn terms, allowing prospective parents and pupils to get a feel for the school environment and meet current pupils and staff.\n\nSmall group Stay and Play Sessions begin on a rolling basis for entry the following September. Offers are made based on the Stay and Play Sessions.\n\nOpen Days take place every year in the Summer and Autumn terms, allowing prospective parents and pupils to get a feel for the School environment and meet current pupils and staff.\n\nAll boys and girls take entrance assessments in English, Maths and Reasoning to determine their suitability for entry into the School. We aim to make the assessment day an informal and friendly occasion. The papers are not designed to trip the boys and girls up, but to better understand their abilities and potential.\n\nSelected boys and girls are invited to return to the School to take additional assessments, in the form of classroom activities, and to have an informal interview with a senior member of staff.\n\nOpen Days take place every year in the Summer and Autumn terms, allowing prospective parents and pupils to get a feel for the School environment and meet current pupils and staff.\n\nAll children take entrance assessments in English, Maths and Reasoning to determine their suitability for entry into the School. We aim to make the assessment day an informal and friendly occasion. The papers are not designed to trip the candidates up but to better understand their abilities and potential.\n\nSelected pupils are invited to return to the School to take additional assessments, in the form of classroom activities, and to have an informal interview with a senior member of staff.\n\nOpen Days take place every year either in Summer and Autumn terms, allowing prospective parents and pupils to get a feel for the School environment and meet current pupils and staff.\n\nIn late November or early December, children sit the online ISEB Common Pre-tests, either at the Under School or their existing school. These tests are also used by a number of other senior schools and may only be taken once.\n\nAfter the online testing is complete, some children are invited back to the Under School on a Saturday to sit additional written papers in English and Mathematics.\n\nAfter the written tests are complete, selected children are invited to return to the Under School for an interview with a senior member of staff.\n\nThose achieving the required results in the entrance exams will then join the Westminster community, with various new starter mornings taking place in the summer term beforehand.\n\n13+ registration opens in October of Year 5. We advise registering your child by the end of Year 5 (the academic year of his 10th birthday). Registration closes on 30 September, after which date no registrations can be accepted. The deadline for SEND reports is 2 October (email to registrar@westminster.org.uk).\n\nApplicants will take the Independent Schools Examinations Board (ISEB) Common Pre-Tests in English, Maths and Reasoning at their prep schools. Westminster then assesses the results in conjunction with a current school report.\n\nApplicants who have performed strongly in the ISEB tests and received a satisfactory report will receive a letter (by email) inviting them to Westminster for further tests and an interview.\n\nThose boys and girls who are invited back to the School take further tests, in Mathematics and English (40 minutes each), in early January, and attend a separate interview scheduled in January / February.\n\nParents will receive a letter (by email) either offering their child an unconditional place at the school (places are no longer conditional on passing Common Entrance), offering to place their child’s name on a waiting list, or a letter explaining that their child’s application will not be taken forward.\n\nSubject to satisfactory progress in the previous 2 years, and a good reference from their current school in Year 8, applicants join Westminster School.\n\nOur Sixth Form has a small registration window: it opens in June and closes at the end of September.\n\nThere are two Open Days each year (in June and September), allowing prospective parents and pupils to get a feel for the school environment and to meet current pupils and staff."
