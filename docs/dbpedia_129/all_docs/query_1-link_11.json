        "text": "There are several protections that the Solar Universe Indiaâ€™s Smart Charge Controllers ensure as they help stop reverse current flow from the battery to the solar array, provide load short circuit protection, and also provide Battery/Panel reverse protection through DC fuse as well as overload protection also. These solar panel charge controllers are suitable for 12V batteries of up to 160ah and are commonly used in off-grid systems, villages, security rooms, computer rooms & farmhouses, or by street vendors. SolarClue is one of the trustworthy cleantech online platforms you can buy Solar Universe India solar panels smart charge controllers with cost-effective solutions and in your preferred areas in India such as Badichowdi.\n\nAttributes\n\nBrand: Solar Universe\n\nMaximum Flow Rate: 2000 Liters per Hour\n\nPower Source: Solar Powered\n\nMaterial: Stainless Steel\n\nType: Polycrystalline\n\nIntroduction of Solar Energy\n\nSolar energy generally works by converting light energy (sunrays) from the sun into electricity. To use solar energy, one of the most effective ways are to convert solar energy or solar power into electrical energy and this process is done by using a solar panel that works on the principle of photovoltaic solar cells (PV cells).\n\nThere are still many ways to profit from solar energy, both when oil prices are low, and when the price of fossil fuels is high. Renewable energy sources/solar power are typically more in demand, especially when the cost/price comes. Photovoltaic (PV) energy creates by using flat solar panels that can be fixed to a structure's roof or arrayed across open spaces.\n\nAs most of the population become familiar to modern-day lifestyle, hence it is difficult to even imagine a day without power. With the higher demand for electric power, power failure has become a commonplace. Thus, one must look for alternative power sources, and it is natural to seek the greenest energy source, namely solar energy. It is also capable of delivering the necessary quantity of hot water at the required temperature. In addition to this, one important part of solar equipment is FPC technology (Flat Plate Collector), which captures solar energy and uses that energy to heat water in the home for bathing, washing and can even be used to heat outdoor swimming pools and hot tubs.\n\nBuy Solar Products from Solarclue.com\n\nAre you looking for the best solar equipment suppliers and dealers in Badichowdi, Hyderabad?

Solar energy-based applications are fast catching-up because energy conservation is the need of the hour. The most beneficial factor of using solar products is providing access to this free source of solar energy, which is green, reliable, and pollution-free. Solar products are generally used and operated by sunlight. Solar energy generates setting solar panels (Monocrystalline solar panel, Polycrystalline solar panel) on the terrace of the building to use sunlight to produce electricity.\n\nNow the question arises on how such products work? Letâ€™s understand the answer to this question. The sun is considered as the best distributed natural source of energy, hence, solar energy or solar power harnesses this abundant resource, and in this way, solar products collect energy to get operated.\n\nSolar energy products are not only reliable and lasting devices but also very cost-effective and efficient ones. Other foremost aspects are advanced technology and affordable pricing in terms of electricity saving. Therefore, solar energy has become a more viable option for consumers nowadays. The search for renewable energy is clean that has turned its focus on solar power."
