        "text": "I‚Äôve been in Hyderabad for a while but my knowledge is mostly work to home and home to work. I want to go shopping for clothes and I know sultan bazaar is best for clothing. But I see metro station only till mgbs. How do I go from there to all these three places ? YouTube seems to think all theee are same. Google maps shows atleast 3-4 kms between each place. Any guidance from the nearest metro station would be useful. I don‚Äôt want to get lost and no shop at all\n\nEdit : Thanks to everyone who replied. I went to mgbs and took green line. Got down at next stop sultan bazaar , vaibhav shop and walked straight. It was all shopping. But ask around which side are the clothing shops before starting to walk. I started to walk towards a lot of wedding card shops which was exactly opposite side of clothing shops. It was a fun ride. I wish I had more time to explore to understand the locality . Maybe next time. Thanks everyone again ! üôè"
