        "text": "I never gave much importance to the hands until today. I recall hearing a lecture titled “Many Securities”, delivered by my mentor Mr. P. Sainath, the eminent rural journalist, talking about the absurdity of UIDAI Aadhar card project by fingerprinting all citizens, he simply said “In India, 15% plus population, because of agricultural labour, they do not have fingerprints, denying the very people who need the social security benefits…”. His voice was resonating in my mind as I looked at this 5 year old kid’s hands today. This kid is one among those 300 children who were rescued from bangle making units in Hyderabad.\n\nOne of the rescued child (Please take a closer look at his fingers)\n\nAs I entered the big hall where the children were kept, I could see at least half of them sleeping soundly at 4 PM, some playing noisily and some lost in thought and clueless why they are here. The youngest was about 5 or 6 years old and all below 18. A quick glance at them will tell you that they all had the same confused looks, unkempt hair, some with running noses, ill-fitting clothes, bare feet and hard calloused hands, just as you see the kid in the picture who was narrating his woes to Dr. Shantha Sinha, founding member of MV Foundation who paid a visit to the children today.\n\nDr. Shantha Sinha interacting with the rescued children\n\nWhile the law enforcement authorities did a great job in the rescue mission by not cowing down to external pressures and rescued 220 children on 24th Jan 2014, of which 3 were girls all aged below 18. As per Indian law any child below 14 yrs age should not be employed, and this law was violated with 174 children among the 220 rescued, according to Mr. Gangadhar Sabavath, Joint Commissioner, Labour department who conducted the raid with Hyderabad Police department. Four days later on 28th Jan, 2015, another 80 children were rescued from the bangle making industry totalling the count to 300 children employed in bangle making units in Hyderabad. Before we go further into details, here are some quick facts about the bangle industry in India.\n\nThere are about 350 shops, apart from the make shift street vendors, selling bangles in Laad Bazaar, Hyderabad, which is a 400 year old bangle market and caters to locals as well as tourists visiting the city.\n\nIndia is the leading exporter of bangles. During the month of December 2014 itself, India exported Bangles worth USD 18 million ($18,751,449).\n\nAverage value of each export shipment of Bangles exports from India is USD 375,029.\n\nOver 77% of the Indian made bangles are exported to United Arab Emirates, which serves as a major trading hub for bangles and other goods.\n\nI need not go into further details as the business is a lucrative one, so the manufacturers are bending rules everywhere using their influence to cover their misdeeds. A couple of decades ago bangle makers were seen as artisans. But the lack of incentives and a meagre pension of Rs. 750 per month was barely enough for an artisan to continue the family occupation. But in the past decade, as the demand for bangles grew within India and abroad, some of the bangle traders and manufacturers started to look at alternate ways to increase production to meet the demand as you can see from the exports. Child labour seemed cost-effective and hassle-free alternative to the diminishing workforce of artisans in bangle industry.\n\nAs the tiny nimble hands are perfect for creating intricate designs on the famous stone studded bangles of Hyderabad. All this without any headaches of pensions, artisans’ benefits or even checks and measures on working conditions. Our government too chose to look the other way when similar raids were conducted in Firozabad, Uttar Pradesh state between 2009 to 2012, where more than 20,000 children are estimated to be working in home based bangle making units. Normally we should look at our own units to see if something was going haywire. But we were happy with the industry serving both ways for boosting tourism and exports. Adding to the woes, some cases which made to Allahabad court were looked into as environmental pollution cases rather than Child Labour angle. The plight of the children from Hyderabad bangle making units is even more appalling as they are brought to the city by contractors for a meagre sum assured to the child’s parents and are forced to work for 10-14 hours a day under hazardous conditions. Their living conditions are even worse as they rarely get a break from work or served any nutritious food. Almost all children who were rescued are malnourished and atleast 20% of them suffered from respiratory diseases. If you look at their hands you will often wonder how they manage to eat with all those cuts, bruises and burns.\n\nThis Saahil’s hand, who worked in the bangle making unit for over a year\n\nThe boy in the picture was barely 5 came from Gaya in Bihar State like the majority of others. The children were bought by contractors who go by different names like Uncle, Chacha, Mamaji etc posing as relatives to these children and promise a price of Rs. 3000-5000 per year for each child to the child’s parents back in Bihar. Some of those Uncles did try to meet us at the place where the children were housed, trying to exercise their right to meet with the children, but thankfully the officials denied the entry. While talking to them, we came to know that their own material possessions, a pair of clothes, slippers in their bags were taken by the police. Under the circumstances, anyone in their right senses, might think that it is not a big deal to lose a pair of dirty clothes or slippers, we can always get them fresh clothes, probably much better ones. I was under the same impression of ‘good riddance to bad rubbish’, assuming that at least the kids got their lives back. Later while sharing a ride back home, Dr. Shantha Sinha, patiently explained to me about the importance of their little possessions which gives them the sense of security of holding on to something like a teddy bear or something that reminds them of home. This stuff may look like garbage or utterly useless things, but these are the precious and prized possessions of the children. Some children even collect a few things that they fancy to take back home as gifts to their loved ones. So it is a big deal for them to leave those few material possessions which they call their own in an unknown city far away from home. This left a lump in my throat, made me realise my faulty judgement about their prized possessions. Our kids hold on to that special toy or a teddy bear and more fortunate ones have fancier gadgets. There is no difference in the sense of security that these children derive from holding on to things, whether rags or rich toys. We all silently wished that the law enforcement authorities will realise this too. What next? The fate of these children is now bleak. Telangana government doesn’t want to take any responsibility in taking the responsibility in the long run. Indian Railways is being approached for having a special train to Gaya so the children can be sent back to their homes where their care and support is extended and monitored by Bihar state government. Things seems to come to a stand still as some older boys were already getting impatient and were asking why they were not allowed to go out and play. The younger ones stand near the windows holding on to the protective iron grill and look longingly at the neighbourhood children playing in the open ground nearby. It was tough for us to explain the complex nature of bureaucracy we encounter in getting something as basic as transporting these children to their hometowns or even provide proper entertainment or psychological counselling to them. While we haven’t heard from the Bihar government or from Indian railways, the sad fact is as these children were rescued, India was busy celebrating its 65th Republic Day and focusing the entire attention to Obama’s visit and the pinstriped suit of Narendra Modi. It is sickening to see how we gobble up garbage served to us by media and take pride in consuming it, while the future citizens of India are denied of their basic right of childhood. We fail to realise that these are the children who will be sharing the space on the planet with our own. Do these children deserve something less than our own?\n\nTime for some action What can we do? Go after the source. Hit the culprits where it hurts the most. Can we avoid buying bangles for a while until the manufacturers employ adults for the job? Sure, that could be done. That is the least we can do for these children. Join us on “Boycott Bangles from Hyderabad” campaign. Share this with your friends with the hash tag #BoycottBanglesFromHyderabad to create more awareness about child labour in bangle making industry. This is the only way we can keep those tiny little hands useful for doing something they really love and meant to do. We want those fingerprints intact. Don’t we?"
