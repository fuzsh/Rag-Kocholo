        "text": "During a press conference, Traders Joint Action Committee members said they will intensify their protest by beginning with a peace rally on February 10 and later downing their shutters on February 15. Expressing fear and deep anguish at HMR officials insensitivity in not considering the consequences of the Metro project on livelihood of traders, they said, “Nearly 4,000 shops will be affected between Chikadpally and Puthlibowli and about two lakh people directly dependent on these markets will have no future,’’ TJAC chairman Govind Rathi said.\n\nHe demanded that officials should reconsider changing the route. Traders shouted slogans of ‘Corridor should either be reviewed or cancelled’ during the press meet. “Corridor-II is proposed to run from Jubilee Bus Station to Falaknuma, which is very near to the MMTS route, running from Secunderabad to Falaknuma. What is the need for another rail service?’’ Govind Rathi said.\n\nTJAC members referred to observations made by the Delhi Metro Rail managing director E Sridharan that the Corridor-II was not a viable option. “Sridharan’s views should be given value because he is an expert in these issues,” members said. Referring to the decision to make changes in the route in the Old City, following pressure exerted by leaders of Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen (MIM), traders demanded to know why officials were not prepared to hear their genuine grievance.\n\nThey also alleged that the Metro project has been implemented without any transparency. They said that razing of shops in important markets is a larger conspiracy to help big businessmen establish malls. When officials were questioned to share information, they seemed very reluctant. “There were reports that traders will be provided shops underneath the rail track but its not possible because of security reasons,’’ they said."
