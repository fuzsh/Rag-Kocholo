        "text": "HYDERABAD: Traders and businessmen on Veer Savarkar Marg till Badi Chowdi are upset as the roads have been dug up again for laying water and drainage pipelines.\n\nMr Govind Rathi of Sultan Bazaar Traders Association said, “Work is not being carried out. The roads are already narrow due to the Metro Rail works. The new digging work has added to the problem.”\n\nTraders in Sultan Bazaar, Veer Savarkar Marg and Badi Chowdi complain of dust from the heaps of mud lying close to their shops.\n\nMr P.V. Vasudev, a cloth trader, said, “It is very difficult to keep the shop clean as the dust settles on all the cabinets. We are not able to sit for six to eight hours in the shop owing to the dust.” He added that traders had to get their shop cleaned twice a day. Our request is that once the road has been dug, work must be completed and not ignored.”\n\nTraders said that the contractor did not return after digging up the road as the pipes were not available. Complaints to Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board got its officers inspect the area only on Monday.\n\nThe work is yet to resume. Traders have warned the department that if the works are not carried out within the next two to three days, they will shut shop and hold a dharna."
