        "text": "SoftBank-backed Unicommerce Esolutions shares are expected to see robust listing premium on their debut on August 13. This is considering the overwhelming response to the IPO, and its leading position in the e-commerce enablement SaaS platform in the transaction processing sector based on FY2021-23 revenue, although it is richly valued.\n\nThe Rs 277-crore IPO was subscribed 168.39 times during August 6-8, with investors buying 237.16 crore equity shares against the offer size of 1.4 crore shares, becoming the second biggest in terms of subscription numbers so far in 2024. Non-institutional investors led the charge, buying 252.48 times the allotted quota, followed by qualified institutional buyers and retail investors who bid 138.75 times and 131.15 times the portions set aside for them.\n\nThe issue comprised solely an offer-for-sale by the investor and promoter, with no fresh issue component. Thus, the entire IPO money would be received by the selling shareholders. The price band for the issue was Rs 102-108 per share.\n\nThe grey market also seems to be indicating robust debut of the stock on the bourses, as shares were available at around 60 percent premium over the issue price of Rs 108 per share, market observers said. The grey market is an unofficial platform wherein the IPO shares can be bought and sold till the listing.\n\n\"Considering the strong subscription demand and understanding the market mood, we expect there is a good room for healthy listing gain in the range of 40 percent over the issue price of Rs 108 per share,\" Prashanth Tapse, Research Analyst, Senior VP Research at Mehta Equities said.\n\nAlso read: FirstCry shares likely to list with double-digit premium over issue price on August 13\n\nOn valuation parse, the issue was fully priced IPO offer by looking at its near-term growth triggers. But being the largest ecommerce enabled SaaS provider and only profitable in this space with no listed peers, Tapse believes the company may command a premium valuation multiple. With its unique technology capabilities and continuous innovation, he also believes the company is well positioned to capitalize on the expanding e-commerce enablement sector.\n\nUnicommerce Esolutions is India’s largest e-commerce enablement software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform in the transaction processing or nerve centre layer, based on revenue for the financial years 2021-23. Their platform facilitates comprehensive management of e-commerce operations for brands, sellers, and logistics service providers.\n\n\"The company is anticipated to make a strong debut of 59 percent premium over the upper price band,\" Parth Shah, Research Analyst at StoxBox said.\n\nAlso read: Saraswati Saree Depot IPO sees healthy demand on day 1, subscribed 4.37 times\n\nThe e-commerce market in India is poised for substantial growth, driven by increased internet penetration and rising demand from rural and Tier II cities. This expansion is expected to scale e-commerce activities, thereby increasing the demand for SaaS platforms among small and medium enterprises. The company aims to leverage India’s growth potential by tapping into emerging market trends and engaging in industry forums dedicated to D2C, retail, supply chain, and the broader e-commerce sector.\n\n\"Though the issue looks rich in terms of valuation, we believe that the company’s strong business performance along with industry tailwinds provides an opportunity for further growth for the company,\" Parth said.\n\nNarendra Solanki, Head Fundamental Research - Investment Services, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers also believes that the issue is richly priced, but sees the stock listing at a premium based on the current grey market price.\n\nThe company's P/E ratio is 84.3 times based on its FY24 earnings, with a market capitalization of Rs 1,106.2 crore after the issuance of equity shares and a market cap-to-sales ratio of 10.6 times its FY24 earnings. The company does not have any listed peers in India or outside India.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
