        "text": "When San Francisco social butterfly Octavia Van Ness falls into decline, on a physician's advice her grandfather, mining king Ezra Whitney, takes her to Alaska, hoping that she will regain health and find a mate more suitable than the gilded youths of the California city. In the far north they meet \"Chuck\" Hemingway, whom the girl supposes to be a \"sourdough,\" but whom the grandfather recognizes as a young collegian from the east. When she rejects Hemingway's advances, the caveman instinct wakens within him. The day before she is to return to civilization, Hemingway kidnaps her, enters into a forced marriage with her, and installs her in his cabin--where she suffers no more harm than if she were with her mother. Six months later, Octavia is now well and strong and rejoices in housework, but is still antagonist to Chuck. When Kitty Malloy, the queen of the Arctic Cabaret, suddenly arrives in the city, Octavia's jealousy is excited. She realizes his true worth and for the first time loves her husband. They return to California, where they are united with Octavia's family.\n\nThe head of the Kimberly household rules it with an iron fist. Unfortunately the head of the Kimberly household isn't Grant (J.H. Gilmore), the father and wealthy Wall Street magnate -- it's his spoiled, headstrong daughter Catherine (Virginia Pearson). She is so willful that she has earned the name \"Impossible Catherine,\" and her whole focus in life is to prove women's superiority over the masculine gender. Catherine is pretty successful in this endeavor until she runs into Yalie John Henry Jackson (William B. Davidson). He's read The Taming of the Shrew and believes he can out-Petruchio her Catherine. First he takes the feisty lass up in a plane and after a few tail spins, suggests she either marry him or jump. She marries him, of course, but then runs away. He finds her and takes her to his Canadian ranch, where he sets her firmly in the kitchen. But none of this tames her spirit until one day he is wounded while trying to protect her -- and this is the one thing that's always guaranteed to get the girl. It works on the wayward Catherine who decides that Jackson is her hero.\n\nAlita Allen is about to be married to her fianc√©, John Campbell. However, Alita's mother--who has been unhappily married for 25 years--puts her foot down and tells her husband that there's a new arrangement: she will have breakfast with him twice a week, but other than that both will have complete freedom from each other. Her daughter likes the idea and makes that a condition of her marriage, but when her husband is perfectly willing to go along with it, she begins to rethink her stance.\n\nThe action takes place in Ephesus in ancient Asia Minor, and the story concerns the efforts of two boys from Syracuse, Antipholus and his servant Dromio, to find their long-lost twins who, for reason of plot confusion, are also named Antipholus and Dromio. Complications arise when the wives of Ephesians, Adriana and her servant Luce, mistake the two strangers for their husbands, though the couples eventually get sorted out after Adriana's sister Phyllis and the Syracusan Antipholus admit their love."
