        "text": "By all accounts the premiere of Puccini's Madama Butterfly at the Metropolitan Opera on 11 February 1907 was a triumphant success, with the presence of the composer adding special lustre to the brilliant performance of a distinguished cast. Amidst the general acclamation, however, a foreign visitor named Jihei Hashiguchi raised a dissenting voice in a letter to a local newspaper:\n\nI can say nothing for the music of Madama butterfly. Western music is too complicated for a Japanese. Even Caruso' celebrated singing does not appeal very much more than the barking of a dog in faraway woods.\n\n11 The records would not have been sent from Tokyo, but from London, where they were published by the Gramophone and Typewriter Company. Scott Miller informs me that the available recordings are enumerated on the stock list for April 1902, pp. 29–30. The Sound Archives of the British Library in London has a microfilm of the list, and the recordings. At least two of the songs used by Puccini, ‘Kimigayo’ and ‘Echigo-jishi’, were available between 1901 and 1904.\n\n32 Chonkina was danced to the accompaniment of samisens; losers took off their clothes one by one. Owners of houses featuring the game (chonkina-ya) decided to stop the practice around 1891.

The Diary of Dr Samuel Pellman Boyer (Bloomington, 1963), 102f.Google Scholar The dance even influenced Western operas about the orient. Musical number 14 in Sidney Jones's The Geisha (1896) is entitled ‘Chon Kina’ and features a suggestive song for geisha and chorus:\n\nI can dance to any measure that is gay,\n\nTo and fro in dreamy fashion I can sway,\n\nAnd if still my art entices\n\nThen – at extra special prices –\n\nI can dance for you in quite another way.\n\nChon kina, chon kina,\n\nChon chon, kina kina,\n\nNagasaki, Yokohama,\n\nHakodate hoi!\n\nCited from Songs of ‘The Geisha’ (New York, 1896), 15.Google Scholar\n\n36 Not ‘September’ as stated in Miyazawa (see n. 25), 235 The performances on 21–29 September at the Imperial were sold out, and the troupe returned for encore appearances at the Yûrakuza Theatre on 8–17 October. Ella Wiswell, a Russian woman whose family was living in Yokohama at that time and attended the performances in the intervening week at Yokohama, recalls that they were all in Russian, and that most of the troupe disbanded at the end of the tour. The soprano is reputed to have ended up in a mental hospital.\n\n38 In the programme of Shukusatsu ‘Chô-chô-san’, the adaptor, Shikô Tsubouchi, notes that he had seen the opera twenty years before while studying abroad, and had expanded his vague memories, using his own imagination and Nagasaki dialect to fill in the story: ‘I hope I have not profaned Puccini and his work […] I tried to write something that might be similar to the original; but I fear that I might have written a story about a caterpillar, not about a butterfly.’ I am grateful to Jennifer Robertson for providing me with information about the Takarazuka Revue.\n\n39 Hase, Kaoru, The Japan Times, 3 08 1931Google Scholar, ‘Chô-chô-san was as fatuously unintelligent about human affairs as she was alleged to be beautiful and innocent. If Long misrepresented the true character of western manhood through his hero, he at least truthfully portrayed a Japanese musume of several decades ago, for nothing was more natural for the girls of the Meiji era than to kill themselves on the slightest provocation. But that age seems to have gone forever.’\n\n43 See the comparison of Tamaki Miura and Geraldine Farrar from Stanley F. Kaye's review of the latter's appearance in Chicago on 10 December 1915: ‘Miss Farrar is undoubtedly the supreme impersonation of this role […] It was not long ago that this city heard Butterfly sung by a Japanese prima donna, and at that time a Japanese effect was made that no occidental could hope to equal. But the thrill of a dramatic voice was absent then, and the welcome visit of Mme. Tamaki Miura serves as a standard of comparison by which Miss Farrar's enacting of the geisha may be more fully appreciated than ever before.’ The clipping in Miss Farrar's scrapbook (Library of Congress) does not indicate the newspaper.\n\n47 She divorced him in 1937, with an outburst of ‘Japanese’ sentiment that may also have facilitated her remaining in Japan. An interview (‘A Plaintive Melody of Nobuko Hara – Farewell to Her International Love’) in the Asahi shinbun of 12 June 1937 devotes considerable space to the singer's ‘Japanese feelings’, revealing a striking change from the Hara of twenty years before, who had been a leading feminist: ‘I was really a bad wife. […] we got married in spite of my mother's opposition. But just three years after our marriage, I left for America on a performing tour, forgetting about my husband and home. My husband put up with all this without saying a word. A wife like myself who does nothing but sing every day is never a good wife. But now I often think about my mother's grave.’\n\n58 It was followed by a Hamlet in July and a Traviata the following March; a less positive view of the relationship between Townsend Harris and O-Kichi, Shimoda Shigure (Shimoda Showers), appeared in 1958, the centennial of the US–Japan Treaty of Amity and Commerce. See Jones, Stanleigh H. Jr, ‘Puccini Among the Puppets: Madame Butterfly on the Japanese Puppet Stage’, Monumenta Nipponica, 38 (1983), 163–74CrossRefGoogle Scholar and ‘Experiment and Tradition: New Plays in the Bunraku Theater’, Monumenta Nipponica, 36 (1981), 113–31.CrossRefGoogle Scholar I am grateful to Professor Jones for providing me with a copy of his research files on Ochô fujin.\n\n63 Compare, for example, the lover's vow in Yôkihi (Keene, 216). Kyôko Seiden suggests that the libretto may even make a particular allusion to Ono no Komachi when O-Chô makes three peep-holes in the shôji for Suzuki, her son and herself, exclaiming, ‘hole, hole, hole, oh I cannot wait’ (ana ana ana ana machidôshiya), an exclamation resembling the sighing sounds ‘ana me, ane me’ that legend attributes to the sound of the wind through the skull of the poet in the grass. The allusion is highly appropriate: Komachi was famous for jilting her lovers.\n\n67 I am particularly grateful to Robert J. Smith for his unfailing encouragement and advice throughout the writing of this study. In addition to instances acknowledged in footnotes, I am also indebted to Karen Brazell, Brett De Bary, Nelly Furman, Dorinne Kondo, Marilyn Martin and Etsuko Terasaki for helpful conversations, and to Yôko Mathews, Keiko Yokota-Carter and Sara Pradt for their help with research. After the manuscript had gone to press, Aaron M. Cohen, who is working on a detailed study of the opera's performance history in Japan, sent me a review of the performance discussed on page 181 in the Hôchi Shinbun of 26 May 1930. It suggests that the opera was made more palatable by resisting the appropriation of Japanese culture and ‘de-orientalising’ it: ‘Many pans of the original opera – words, music and acting – are cut, but thanks to these cuts we Japanese can enjoy the opera without getting too angry. For example, such famous melodies as “Kimigayo” and “Miya-san, Miya-san” were deleted, and other lines and gestures considered a national disgrace were taken away. Some names were changed: “Suzuki” to “Osuzu” and “Count Yamadori” to “Mr Yamadori” We can now watch Madam Butterfly with peace of mind.’ The review goes on to criticise the decision to have Pinkerton sing in English and all Japanese characters sing in English when addressing the Americans: ‘Isn't a mixture of Japanese and English a little odd, like some sort of comedy routine? It is as if to insist that Aida be performed in Egyptian and Ethiopic.’"
