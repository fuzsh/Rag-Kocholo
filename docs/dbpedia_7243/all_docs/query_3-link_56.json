Born at\n\nLucca in 1858. he hclnna-s !o :> fnmiiu\n\nwhich for 150 years has produced an\n\nuninterrupted line of musicians. 1 have\n\ncalled Puccini the .operatic man of the\n\nmoment, and it rs not difficult to account\n\nfor us popularity. His whole-hearted\n\ndevotion to this one form of musical art,\n\nin 'which he lias certainly achieved much,\n\nhas -been pointed to by some as defining\n\nhis limits. Apart from a few early string\n\nquartettes, which mean nothing more\n\nthan th o preliminary studies' of a gifted\n\nsi/udenl, Puecmi has written nothing but\n\noperas since he started, In this respect\n\nhe has a certain well-defined natural\n\ncharacteristic, which gives him a distinct\n\nplace in the history of progress and ¦¦de\n\nvelopment of the art and science of mu\n\nsic-making. In Italy then, the land whicn\n\no.wus Puccini as one of its distinguished\n\nsuns, the opera had its rise — (1607--and\n\ncurious to relate, about 200 years sRo'.s\n\ncurious to relate, was respon\n\nsible for its first fall, This\n\nwas caused by the desire of, leading singr\n\ners for vocal display, and the introduction\n\nof long flourishes, which had nothing to\n\ndo with- the plot, yet pleased the public\n\nmightily. In the eighteenth and nine\n\nteenth centuries,- the opera was regarded\n\nin Italy as purely musical form. Ail tins\n\ntime, during wliieir so-called Italian opera\n\ndominated the whole, of Europe, nothing\n\nwas done in Italy to develop orchestral\n\nwriting, which iri Germany had made mar\n\nvellous strides, I hanks to Wagner.\n\nAt the psychological moment — for Italy\n\n— came Verdi, who if he took the opera\n\nvery much us he found it, breulihcd tram\n\nthe verv first a new spirit into the com\n\nposition. His artistic growku as seen in\n\nhis later operas, was one of the most\n\nremarkable tilings m modern musical\n\nhistory. So, in the fulness of time wc\n\ncome to Puccini, to whom it would he\n\nreasonable to poinL as the successor of\n\nVerdi. Puccini's music is dramatic, and\n\nby far the greater part of it is purely of\n\nthe theatre. Puccini was only six years\n\nold when his father died, ana it is lo\n\nhis mother that toe owes his gratitude\n\nlor the opporitimues wnicu upeucu uie\n\nvvav for his musical career, and her mem\n\nory is lovingly cherished by her distin\n\nguished son. Puccini's first opera was\n\n\"he YJlle,\" for which hp received £80.\n\n\"Edgar\" was tois next work, but was a\n\nfailure-; then name -.Marion,\" which prac-\n\nticallv assured Turn for the future; \"La\n\nBoheme,\" \"Tosca,\" and then came un\n\nquestionably the strongest work that Puc\n\ncini has produced, in \"Madame Butterfly,\"\n\nwhich was founded on a magazine story\n\nby John Luther Long.\n\nMADAME BUTTERFLY.\n\nThe following precis of the beautiful\n\nopera will no doubt be interesting . — The\n\nwork opens with Madame Butterfly, a\n\nbeautiful Geisha girl, preparing for her\n\nmarriage with Lieutenant Pinkerton, an\n\nAmerican navdl officer. Pinkerton is\n\nonlv staving in Japan for a short period,\n\nand thinks the wedding just a pleasant in\n\nterlude In- his sojourn m the land oi\n\nchrysanthemums. He does not imagine that\n\nButterfly will take the marriage seriously,\n\nand is warned by his friend, Sharpless.\n\ntne American Gunsul at Japan, that he\n\nshould reflect again before entering inlo\n\nmatrimony,, as he was' sure that the\n\nJapanese maiden's love was so deep that\n\nshe believed her future husband would\n\nregard their marriage as a binding con\n\ntract. Tlie marriage was arranged by\n\nGoro, a marriage broker, who only thought\n\nof the Japanese custom of being able to\n\nannul marriage monthly. A veritable lit-\n\ntle \"Butterfly\" she was m appearance-\n\nsweet; dainty, sunny-hearted and gay.- yet\n\nfull of quaint and thoughtful fancies; pos\n\nsessing a- woman's heart pure, true and\n\ncapable of deep and abiding passion. So\n\nintense was her love for. Pinkerton that\n\nshe never gave a single thought to the\n\npossibility of his affection waning. As a\n\nproof of hey perfect trust in her future,\n\nshe. confessed, just before the marriage,\n\nof 'having adopted the Christian faith and\n\nhad renounced her old religion; a fact\n\nwhich, if known to her relations, would\n\nhave made her an outcast. The marriage\n\nis duly performed, and . Pinkerton wishes\n\nto rid liimself-of his wedding guests. Just,\n\nas the hilarity is aft its height, however, an\n\nunwelcome intruder named Bonze, an\n\nuncle of the bride, and who is a Japanese\n\npriest, arrives and denounces the bride\n\nfor her apostacy. He furiously calls\n\ndown curses upon her, and is joined in\n\nhis denunciation by the now angry guesrs.\n\nTlie offence in their eyes is unpardonable.\n\nA period of intense happiness now passes,\n\nand when after a few month's have drifted\n\npleasantly by, as one happy dream, Pin\n\nkerton receives orders that his ship is to\n\nreturn to America. To case the pain of\n\nhis departure he promises his weeping\n\nwife that he will return to her when \"the\n\nrobins begin to nest,\" and Butterfly, be\n\nlieving implicillyr, is satisfied and daily de\n\nclares to her faithful maid and sole com-\n\npanion, Suzuki, mat mis nappy rc-umun\n\nwould certainly come to pass. But at\n\nlast the money which Pinkerton had left\n\nbecomes exhausted, and at the end of the\n\nthird vea'r they find themselves destitute.\n\nOne dliv Sharpless comes to see Butterfly\n\non a dilfieult mission, for he has received\n\nword from Pinkerton- slating that toe has\n\nmarried an American lady, and had asked\n\nhis old friend to breaK the news to Butter\n\nfly Upon every sentence Sharpless reads\n\nfrom the letter Butterfly puts her own\n\nhappv construction, find Sharpless be\n\ncomes despaired of ever making her real\n\nise the fatal truth. He is relieved by the\n\nappearance of old Goro, who has with\n\ntoiin Prince Yamadori, a wealthy Japanese\n\nsuitor, who has for a long time vainly en\n\ndeavored to induce the deserted wife t.o\n\naccept him as a husband. Full of indig\n\nnation she turns to Sharpless and cries,\n\n\"How can I marrv him when I have a be\n\nloved husband already, whq is now re\n\nturning to claim me once again. But\n\nGoro reminds her that in Japan desertion\n\nconstituted divorce, but. she scorn tu ly\n\ndeclares, \"-But the law of Japan is not the\n\nlaw of mv husband's co.unlry.\" As a\n\nfinal strengthening of her argument But\n\nterfly brings her bonny baby boy, and to\n\nthe astonishment of the ConsuL she cries\n\npassionately, \"Do you think he could for-\n\nJr.u i hit; nimcf of our love'?' bharnless,\n\nknowintr that Pinkerton has no knowledge\n\nthat a son has been born lo him, is over-\n\nconip with emotion, 9.nd huslily Ig&vos, in-\n\nwardly railing at his friend for entrusting\n\nhim with such an impossible com\n\nmission. \" The roar of cannon\n\nis heard from the harbor.\n\nButterfly discovers that Ihe salute was in\n\nrecognition of pjnkerlon's vessel. Full\n\nof delirious joy, she docoratod the house\n\nwith the fairest flowers from , the garden\n\nin honor of hex' husband s arrival. Many\n\nhours elapse, and still Pinkerton docs not\n\nappear. Butterfly keeps a\n\nall through the weary night, stiU believ\n\ning tiiat her beloved one will surely come,\n\nand us the day dawns Butterfly, wild a\n\nlook of intense longing, -s led\n\nfrom the window by Mizaki.\n\nNext (lav Pinkerton arrives at the house\n\nand is riiei toy Suzuki, wbo receives him\n\n-gadiv and tells firm ot Butterfly's prepara\n\ntions for his visit and of her trust in him,\n\neach word of Which was as a knife in the\n\nheart of the now. .remorseful Pinkerton.\n\nTie departs from Um house full -of grief,\n\nas his American wife enters from the\n\ngarden.

When\n\nasked lo give. up the guardianship or her\n\nchild. Butterfly reolies that, Pinkerton\n\nshould have the child, if he would eume\n\nfor it himself in half an hour. When\n\nthey had gone, Butterfly dismisses Suzuki,\n\nand taking down her father's swoivl, she\n\nsavs, broken-heartfidly to herself, If 1 can\n\nno longer live with honor, at least- I can\n\ndie witii honor.\" At thai, moment tbe\n\ndoor opens to admit the child, who lias\n\nbeen pushed gently in toy suzuki But er-\n\nilv rushes for\\vara and clasps her .child\n\nin her arms in a last passionate cmbiyice;\n\nthen laying hini carefully upon the ground,\n\nshe plunges the sword into her bosom.\n\nPinkerton. on entering the noom, finds.\n\nButterfly lying motionless; and the faith\n\nful heart that had loved him with such\n\ntrue devotion, at rest for ever.\n\nWhether we are to find in Puccini a\n\nsecond Verdi rising from strength to\n\nstrength and developing his genius wi th J\n\nadvancing years, lime alone < can show,\n\nbut the opening of his career justifies the\n\nmost sanguine hopes for his future.\n\nMUSICAL WORLD.\n\nMr. W. Short, the King's 'trumpeter,\n\nspeaks with pnde of the Ballarat\n\nEisteddfod, and referring to the people\n\nconnected therewith he says: 'You w.il\n\nfind the finest people on God s earth\n\nHi ere; you Britishers do. not realise the\n\nmagnitude of this gathering, which draws\n\ntogether lrom 5000 to bOOG competitors\n\nfrom 700 Australian towns and villages.\n\nFor four weeks thev file before judges—\n\nchoirs and bands--and expend hundreds\n\nof pounds in rail and sea fares.\" lie\n\nalso mentions the \"good fellowship of\n\neveryone,\" and concludes with Vtlieir\n\nlllt>UUwlJl|/ 1 1 1 K5 II I L vvu\n\nCrossing the bar. An officer at the\n\nfront recently told a London Evening\n\nNews representatives the following- story\n\nas bemg within lus own experiences. A\n\nsoldier who had been almost riddled with\n\nshrapnel was being laid tenderly upon the\n\nhospital bed when he suddenly began\n\nto sing Tenuysotrs \"Crossing the Bar,\"\n\nto sir .Joseph Bamby's beauliiul selling.\n\n\"His voice was one of the sweetest\n\ntenors 1 ever heard,\" said the officer.'\n\n\"While everyone listened in silence, lie\n\nwent right through the piece, but his\n\nstrength was ebbing. He managed,\n\nhowever, to sing on to the end, While\n\nfainter and fainter grew tlie voice until\n\nhe reached- —\n\n\"And may there he no moaning at the\n\nBar;\n\nWhen I put out lo sea.\" >\n\nDying as he uttered the last words, i\n\nshall never forgel that experience.\"\n\nGospel Songs: Fanny Crosby, the\n\nwriter of 700 uospel hymns, died a few\n\nweeks nero at the nrie. old acre of 95.\n\nShe came of an American family. When\n\nsix years old a cold produced a slight in\n\nflammation ol the eyes, and an amateur\n\ndoctor recommended hot poultices, which\n\ndestroyed her sight. Her will and\n\nspiritual nature sprung forth at this\n\ncalamiy; she held that God had conse\n\ncrated her to her work. To enumerate\n\nFanny Crosby's hymns would he to\n\ncount over the American Gospel songs,\n\nwhich are so well known in America and\n\nEngland. She lived on an annuity pro\n\nvided by the Biglow and Main Publish\n\ning Co.. of New York, the chief publish\n\ners of Gospel hymns. Fanny Crosby, as\n\nshe conceived a hymn, would sit in\n\nsilence until it was complete in her mind,\n\nthen she would announce that she was\n\nready to dictate it, and the first sketch\n\nwas never altered. Her best known\n\nhvmn is perhaps \"Safe an the Arms of\n\nJesus.\"\n\nMUSICAL REVIEW.\n\nFrom Allan and Co. Ltd. we have re\n\nceived three numbers of the popular im\n\nperial edition, viz., Nos, 129, .131 and 131,\n\ncomprising three grades of melodious\n\nstudies by Rendano. These will be found\n\nmost useful lor teaching purposes, being\n\nsufficiently tuneful to be attractive to the\n\npupi. while at the same time of dis\n\ntinctly educational value. \"Reverie,\" by\n\nJan Sareski This has a charming; melody\n\nand the style is distinctly good, of me\n\ndium grade of difficulty Other piano\n\ncrtlrtf i v»n »novKrnnL-\" Acl Ara_\n\nUff CLL G .

It is the\n\nsort of piece that young ladies who wish\n\nto appear as- better players than they\n\nreally are, are always on the look out\n\nfor. \"Woodland Rambles\" is about a\n\nsecond grade piece, without octaves, and\n\nis nice and tuneful, aud should have quite\n\na useful career before, it.\n\nIn popular songs we have \"In the\n\nCandle iLight,\" a song of the popular\n\nstyle. As jn the case of some of its pre\n\ndecessors, it will not be long before we\n\nwill be praying for a gun with which to\n\nshoot Ihe man who wrote it-— kve will\n\nhear so much of it- \"Gunner,\" by Haydn\n\nWood, which is particularly appropriate\n\nfor the present time. The words are bold\n\nand martial, fitted lo a stirring melody.\n\n\"Wiggle Woggle\" is not the name of a\n\nnew toy or doll, but of a characteristic\n\ndance, which has been' introduced with\n\ngreat success jn Williamson's pantomime,\n\nand which is said to be another \"Teddy\n\nBear's Picnic.\" We would recommend\n\nil, to those who like humorislic effects on\n\nthe piano.\n\nFor the rag-timers, \"Harmony Bay\" is\n\nmore than usually good. The harmonies\n\nare excellent, and it has a good catchy\n\nrefrain.\n\nr roTu _riuu > » — - i V jj% .jrium-\n\nMalcolm— a urelly song with a. quaint\n\nrhythm — it needs careful handling, but\n\nsti'il is not difficult.\n\n\"A Little Pink Rose,\" words and music\n\nby Carrie Jacobs-Bond; the music is nice\n\n—Ihe acc-e.ntcd portion of the words be\n\ning unusual.\n\n\"Choral Technique and Interpretation,\"\n\ntoy Dr. Coward, is a hook that all musical\n\npeople should read. It contains no nad-\n\ndmg or mere theorising, and everything\n\nWritten is the outcome of living experi\n\nence anq lias stood the lest of many\n\nyears' trial.\n\n\"Give Peace In Our Tune, O Lord,\"\n\nwritten bv F. W. Wadely, is a good an\n\nthem for a choir of fair capabilities; also\n\na beautiful hymn entitled \"Darkness Of\n\nNight,\" well within Ihe range of congre\n\ngational singing. Bol-li anthem and hymn\n\nhave been published by Novell o's and are\n\nquite new.\n\nMUSICAL LOCAL.\n\nSt. Paul's choir, under the direction of\n\n-Mr. Stanley Elliott, Is preparing Slalner's\n\ncantata, \"The Daughter of Jairus,\" and\n\nit is honed that it will be ready early in .\n\nJune.
