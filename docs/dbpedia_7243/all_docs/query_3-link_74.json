        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n15 Japan on American screens, 1908–1915 •Japan on American screens, 19 0819 15 Gregory A. Waller J apan invaded the United States sometime in May 1910. Or at least that is what a Moving Picture World editorial claimed in its 28 May 1910 issue, as it contemplated a forthcoming release entitled, Love of Chrysanthemum. Moving Picture World readily identified this Vitagraph film as yet one more refashioning of Madame Butterfly, that is, a contemporary story in which an ill-fated, cross-cultural and inter-racial romance between a Japanese woman and an American man ends with her suicide. For this preeminent American trade magazine, the “Japanese Invasion” was not literally a matter of spies, immigrants, or imported goods, and not a case of Japanese performers or stage productions making their way into the American entertainment market. New releases from Edison, Kalem, and Vitagraph had put Japan on view for American motion picture audiences and prompted Moving Picture World to ask two related rhetorical questions: what accounts for America’s “peculiar interest” in Japan, and “what is the connection ... between the United States and Japan?” The answer, according to Moving Picture World, was somewhat complicated: • First, there is a “sentimental link” between the two nations, typically figured as an “inevitable love story” in which “the occident mixes with the orient”. • Second, there is an aesthetic (and decidedly anti- or un-modern) appeal of Japan: “there is idyllism in everything Japanese” – its “grace ... charm ... poetry”, its “prettiness ... art ... simplicity”. • And, third, there is the highly topical logic of contemporary geopolitics: America’s former protégé had become its “rival in the Pacific”, for the New Japan had emerged as a “world power by virtue of its conquests, its army, its navy, and its ambitions”.1 Into the mid-1910s these knotted strands of desire, fear, admiration, curiosity, and appreciation – of Japanophilia tempered by Japanophobia – would find expression and validation in a significant body of films. This fascination with things Japanese and concern over trans-Pacific relations was hardly limited to the film industry. Japan’s victories first over China (in the Sino-Japanese War of 1895) and then over Russia (in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905), its occupation of Formosa and Korea, its foothold on the Chinese mainland, its much-noted modernization and militarization – all these “achievements” earned Japan the status in Western eyes as a veritable nation on the Euro-American model. Within a generation, Japan had emerged as a new colonialist force to be reckoned with in the Pacific, where the United States had by the turn of the twentieth century staked its own imperial claims to Hawaii and the Philippines. From the late 1890s on, but especially after 1905, the United States and Japan both experienced a series of loudly declaimed war scares, crises often driven by 139 the unabashedly racist attempts of elected officials in California to segregate and deny full citizenship to Japanese Americans and to curtail Japanese immigration to the United States. In such a climate, the “Yellow Peril” became more than a handy slur for nativists. The prospect of armed conflict between the United States and Japan was played out across American media, including Kalem’s 1909 release, The Japanese Invasion. In May–June 1909, the Washington Post, for example, published in serial form Banzai!, a full-length novel that ends with Japanese and U.S. troops battling in the American heartland. Four years later, Kay-Bee would release a three-reel spy melodrama with the same title. Predictably, heightened tensions between Japan and the United States were prime fodder for daily editorial cartoons, a feature of most large American newspapers. One particularly germane image from the Cleveland Plain Dealer (reprinted in the news magazine, American Review of Reviews) shows Uncle Sam as a barker, inviting customers to his mutoscope parlor while a startled “Jap” cranks a machine showing “Uncle Sam’s Asiatic Fleet”: here actualité footage serves as a propagandistic adjunct to the building of real battleships (Fig. 1). These representations form part of what I call Japan-in-America, the widespread and surprisingly diverse network of mass-produced images of Japan that publicly circulated in the United States at the turn of the twentieth century across a host of media and cultural channels, including postcards, stereoviews, magic lantern slides, magazines, photographs, sheet music, advertisements, and books.2 In order to track how motion pictures contributed to this complex, historically specific example of cross-cultural representation, I have compiled a..."
