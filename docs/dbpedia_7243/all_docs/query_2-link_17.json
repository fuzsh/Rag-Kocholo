        "text": "‘Hulda from Holland’ as a picture will delight friends of Miss Pickford everywhere. Hulda as a characterization is filled with charm, with the distinctive bits that seem to be Miss Pickford’s sole property in spite of manifold efforts by numerous others to appropriate them.\n\nMary Pickford’s recent film, ‘The Eternal Grind,’ is typical. She works in a sweat-shop. How poor she is! And how sweaty is that shop! But how bravely she bears it! … Then comes villainy. She looks into his eyes. And, really, she is a magnificent actress, and that is the sort of moment when she is at her best. Her face can change from happy innocence to suspicion, to dread, to flaming hate, while still retaining all its innocence…\n\nThere is nothing mysterious about the hold this little actress has on her public. In all her moods there is a fascination that does not elude the camera. She is always dainty, spontaneously playful … becomingly demure, and prettily sentimental. So when Mary smiles her audience smiles with her; when she makes love, hand clasps out front are tightened; and when she hangs her pretty head with its curls handkerchiefs absorb briny moisture from the sea of upturned faces.\n\nIt is a typical Mary Pickford story in which we see Miss Pickford in ‘The Foundling,’the Famous Players five-part release of January 3. There are present those elements which in greater or less degree have been factors in her most successful pictures. … Miss Pickford is at her best. ‘The Foundling’should be one of the more popular Pickford releases.\n\nFor many moons it has been stated, and repeated, in the motion picture fraternity that Mary Pickford was a wonderful artist along certain lines, but that said lines were limited and quite circumscribed. This statement had become so familiar that it was generally accepted as a fact. Well, you Doubting Thomases and Unbelievers, go to the Strand this week to see her in the Famous Players’ (Paramount) production of ‘Mme. Butterfly’ and disabuse your minds of any such idea once and for all. … Words are useless to describe the beauty and artistry of it all – the production, the photography … and above all else, Mary Pickford. The Famous Players has never turned out a finer feature – nor indeed has anybody else.\n\n‘A Girl of Yesterday’ with Mary Pickford as the star … is so arranged to give Mary Pickford an opportunity to display a lot of gowns and the fact that she can play a little golf, is a good little sailor, is not afraid to go up in an airship and, last, but not least, it gives the public another opportunity of looking at this little queen of the screen.\n\nMiss Pickford is enshrined in the hearts of all the people, not because she is the sweetest of the limpid non-entities, but because she is a young woman of powerful personality and extraordinary dramatic talent. Hers is the art which conceals itself. Such hen-yarn drama as ‘Esmeralda’ is as unworthy of criticism as it is unworthy of Mary Pickford.\n\nIn writing the scenario for ‘Rags’ it is evident that Edith Barnard Delano had the most likable traits of Mary Pickford’s personality in mind and aimed to produce a story in which they might be revealed in all their variety. … From beginning to end it is a picture of the winsome little star in a career humorous and pathetic by turns and occasionally dramatic.\n\n‘Little Pal’ will be welcome to those who claim there is such thing as a ‘platonic friendship,’outside the stage or between book covers. Now the pictures have it, in the Famous Players’ latest Mary Pickford production. … The F.P. has its customary faultless production. Several exquisite snow scenes are pictured at intervals. … the picture is an interesting one.\n\nThe Famous Players in this latest Mary Pickford feature has turned out a subject that carries plenty of interest in theme with a brand of first grade photography supporting it to land it among the top-notch list of current releases. Pickford is given full reign in her tattered garments and Pickford in rags can do considerable before a camera.\n\nThe charm of the cricket has made its appeal to the poets from the days of Anacreon, but there was never a sweeter cricket than Fanchon and let me hasten to add there never was a Fanchon like Mary Pickford. Yes, I know that the greatest of the French and the English and the American stars have attempted and have successfully rendered Fanchon, but I stick to my belief that none ever surpassed and few approached the work of Mary Pickford.\n\nMary Pickford and beautiful scenery are the important factors in this feature produced by the Famous Players. … At Miss Pickford’s first appearance on the screen in this picture at the Strand Sunday a rousing reception was given her. … ‘Mistress Nell’was a successful play and it is going to be a successful feature through Mary Pickford being in it.\n\nIn this feature Miss Pickford is seen from every angle in all of her camera moods, and to those who are Pickford fans it will be a feast. … The cuteness of Mary Pickford is proverbial. She alone can carry this picture, and that she will to big returns goes without saying, for besides Pickford, it has ‘the stage’from the inside.\n\nMiss Mary Pickford has the role of Queen Anna Victoria of Herzegovina; and her performance is that of rare quality which we always expect from this star. Comedy and drama are alike to her. She is as delightful in the one as she is moving in the other. As a comedienne she seldom does the anticipated; and therein to a great degree lies the charm of her work.\n\nMary Pickford … is one of the few picture actresses, or actors for that matter, who can interject personality into a negative. She breathes the role taken, and it fits her, up, down and all around. … ‘The Eagle’s Mate’is a lively feature without a real kick – but it has Mary Pickford, better than the best kick or punch that could have been put in, for Mary Pickford is the Ruth Chatterton of the movies.\n\nIn ‘Hearts Adrift’and ‘A Good Little Devil,’Mary Pickford had no opportunity to demonstrate her true value as a movie actress. In ‘Tess of the Storm Country’ … Little Mary comes into her own and her work in this five-part movie production so far o’ershadows her work in the other films there’s no comparison. As the little, expressive-eyed tatterdemalion of the Lake Cayuga shores, Miss Pickford sticks another feather in her movie crown which will help the Famous Players reap a benefit in more ways than one.\n\nHere’s one film on which the movie exhibitor of the country can’t go wrong. … There’s a lot of good, wholesome fun in ‘A Good Little Devil’and there’s fantastical trimmings of the fairy land sort and real pathos of the typical kind that motherless little kids encounter each day that combine in making the play a movie worth while. Miss Pickford does bully work as the blind girl and makes the role stand out as a lovable, childlike sympathetic bit of acting that is irresistible.\n\nMary Pickford, the celebrated film favorite, makes her reappearance in the productions of the Famous Players in ‘Hearts Adrift,’ a tragic epic of the deep… The pathos of this drama is softened by Miss Pickford’s charming and piquant portrayal of the role of the little half-savage Nina. At frequent periods in the story Miss Pickford attains high dramatic power, and strikes a distinct note in her delicate rendition of her supreme sacrifice of self for love.\n\nLittle Mary of Biograph fame … will appear in ‘Caprice,’ Mrs. Fiske’s former success. No better play could have been selected for her inimitable daintiness. It is a delightful comedy-drama of love and society, with an echo of the hills mingled with the voice of the city. Mary Pickford in ‘The Bishop’s Carriage’broke all records at Tally’s Broadway. ‘Caprice’should prove even more of a drawing card.\n\nIt is several months since picture lovers have seen on the screen Mary Pickford in a new film. In this refined melodrama they will see Little Mary in a new light. ‘In the Bishop’s Carriage’ is a crook play; nevertheless its treatment is so artistic, so delicate, so finished, that it will please every division of society."
