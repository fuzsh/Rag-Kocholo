After training in her native Japan and in Europe, Miura was cast in the title role of Pucciniâ€™s Madame Butterfly in London in 1915. Acclaimed for her performances, Miura toured the United States to reprise her role for American audiences. Gardner was a great fan of the opera and friend to many singers; the fact that she collected a photographic portrait of Miura denotes her admiration for the path-breaking soprano.\n\nGallery\n\nTapestry Room\n\nRights and reproductions"
