        "text": "The Lincoln Motion Picture Company\n\nIn most American silent films, minorities were generally played by white actors in make-up. When actual minorities were cast, roles were generally limited. Latinos in silent films usually played greasers and bandits; Asian-Americans played waiters, tongs and laundrymen; and blacks usually played bellboys, stable hands, maids or simple buffoons. Early film depictions of black characters were highly offensive, including those in the films Nigger in the Woodpile, Rastus, Sambo and The Wooing and Wedding of a Coon. Not surprisingly, both Asian-Americans and blacks responded by launching their own alternative cinemas. But whilst Asian-American Silent Cinema quickly faltered, black cinema (blessed with a much larger audience) flourished and soon many so-called race movies were being made by both black and white filmmakers for black filmgoers.\n\nThe first film company devoted to the production of race movies was the Chicago-based Ebony Film Company, which began operation in 1915. The first black-owned film company was The Lincoln Motion Picture Company, founded by the famous Missourian actor Noble Johnson in 1916. However, the biggest name in race movies was and remains Oscar Micheaux, an Illinois-born director who started The Micheaux Book & Film Company in 1919 and went on to direct at least forty films with predominantly black casts for black audiences. Also in 1919, seeing how lucrative the growing race movie market was, Jacksonville, Florida’s Norman Film Manufacturing Company switched tracks and began making race films, starting with an all black remake of one of their earlier films.\n\nBLACK CINEMA IN THE ’10s\n\nAladdin Jones and The Two Knights of Vaudeville (both 1915), Money Talks in Darktown and The Realization of a Negro’s Ambition (both 1916), A Trooper of Troop K, Dat Blackhand Waitah Man, Devil For a Day, The Hypocrites, The Law of Nature, Shine Johnson and the Rabbit’s Foot and Wrong All Around (all 1917), Are Working Girls Safe?, Billy the Janitor, Black and Tan Mix Up, A Black Sherlock Holmes, The Bully, A Busted Romance, The Comeback of Barnacle Bill, Firing the Fakir, Good Luck in Old Clothes, Mercy, the Mummy Mumbled, Our Colored Fighters, A Reckless Rover, Some Baby, Spooks, Spying the Spy, When You Are Scared, Run and When You Hit, Hit Hard (all 1918), The Green-Eyed Monster, The Homesteader and A Man’s Duty (all 1919)\n\nBLACK ACTORS OF THE ’10s\n\nCharles R. Moore, Dora Dean, Ernest “Sunshine Sammy” Morrison,\n\nEvelyn Preer, Jack Johnson, Noble Johnson,\n\nRex Ingram, Samuel “Sambo” Jacks and Tim Moore\n\nOther actors who got there start in the ’10s but whom aren’t pictured: Anita Brown, Anita Thompson, Beulah Hall, Bert Murphy, Blue Washington, Charles D.

Wilson, Frank Pollard, Harry Tracey, Iris Hall, Jimmy Marshall, John Wesley Jenkins, Julia Mason, Mattie Edwards, Mildred Price, Robert Duree, Robert Stewart, Rudolph Tatum, Sam Robinson, Steve Reynolds, Walter Brogsdale, Webb King, Will Starks and Yvonne Junior.\n\nIn the 1920s, more film companies sprang up to exploit the black film audience. Royal Gardens Film Company of Chicago made only one race film. In 1922, Blackburn Velde Productions also made just one film, a vehicle for boxer/actor Jack Johnson. In Kansas City, Missouri there were several black-owned film companies: The Andlauer Film Company, Progress Picture Producing Association, Gate City Feature Films and Turpin Films. In 1926, the Colored Players Film Corporation was founded by white producer David Starkman. The Original Lafayette Players was the first major professional black drama company in the country, founded back in 1915, but they didn’t get into film until 1928. From 1929 to 1930, Monte Brice Productions existed as a vehicle for the black duo Buck & Bubbles. In 1929, The Christie Film Country began making all-black talkies. In 1929, Fox made Hearts in Dixie.\n\nBLACK CINEMA OF THE ’20s\n\nRace movies of the ’20s include The Brute, In the Depths of Our Hearts, The Symbol of the Unconquered and Within Our Gates (all 1920), As the World Rolls On, The Black Thunderbolt, By Right of Birth, The Burden of Race, The Call of His People, The Custard Nine, The Gunsaulus Mystery, The Lure of a Woman, Secret Sorrow, The Simp and The Sport of the Gods (all 1921), The Crimson Skull, The Dungeon, Easy Money, For His Mother’s Sake, The Hypocrite, Spitfire and Uncle Jasper’s Will (all 1922), The Bull-Dogger, Deceit, Ghost of Tolston’s Manor, Regeneration and The Virgin of Seminole (all 1923), Birthright, The Flaming Crisis and A Son of Satan (all 1924), Body and Soul and Marcus Garland (both 1925), The Conjure Woman, The Devil’s Disciple, The Flying Ace, The Prince of His Race and Ten Nights in a Barroom (all 1926), The Broken Violin, The House Behind the Cedars, The Millionaire, The Scar of Shame, The Spider’s Web and Uncle Tom’s Cabin (all 1927), Black Gold, Children of Fate, The Midnight Ace, Thirty Years Later and When Men Betray (all 1928), Black and Tan, Black Narcissus, Blue Songs, Brown Gravy, Election Day, Fowl Play, The Framing of the Shrew, Hallelujah!, Hearts in Dixie, In and Out, The Lady Fare, Melancholy Dame, Music Hath Harms, Oft in the Silly Night, St. Louis Blues and Wages of Sin (all 1929).\n\nBLACK ACTORS OF THE ’20s\n\nAllen ‘Farina’ Hoskins, Anita Bush, Bill “Bojangles” Robinson,\n\nBill Pickett, Clarence Muse, Daniel L.

Crowell and William E. Fountaine.\n\nTHE 1930s AND ’40s\n\nIn the ’30s and ’40s, Hollywood would increasingly make films with all black casts. With their much larger budgets, Hollywood black cinema in the studio era largely appropriated race films’ audience and by World War II, an independent black cinema was no more. It wasn’t until the 1960s and ’70s that a new generation of black filmmakers emerged, creating what came to be known as blaxploitation. However, just as Hollywood co-opted race movies, so too was blaxploitation co-opted. Over the following decades, as black characters grew less and less common in Hollywood, a black independent film movement slowly resurfaced in the ’80s and continues to grow.\n\nThough yellowface and redface continued to be common practice, blackface began to disappear from the mainstream as Hollywood began efforts to woo the audience it had previously been content to insult. This meant there were many new opportunities for black actors, albeit mainly as musicians, porters, chauffeurs, waiters, hat check girls, maids, bootblacks, convicts, bartenders, bone-through-the-nose Africans or buffoons. Because of the improving but still less-than-satisfying opportunities afforded by Hollywood, many black actors supplemented their Hollywood bit parts with simultaneous careers in race movies.\n\nBLACK CINEMA OF THE 1930s\n\nBlack-oriented movies made in the 1930s include: Dark Town Follies, A Daughter of the Congo, Deep South, Easy Street, Georgia Rose, High Toned, Honest Crooks (all 1930); Darktown Revue and The Exile (both 1931); The Black King, Black Magic, The Girl from Chicago, Harlem is Heaven, Pie, Pie Blackbird, A Rhapsody in Black and Blue, Ten Minutes to Live and Veiled Aristocrats (all 1932); Barber Shop Blues, A Bundle of Blues, Mills Blue Rhythm Band, Phantom of Kenwood and Rufus Jones for President (all 1933);Bubbling Over, Chloe, Harlem After Midnight, Imitation of Life and She Devil (all 1934); Cab Calloway’s Jitterbug Party, Murder in Harlem, Sanders of the River and Temptation (all 1935); The Black Network, Gifts in Rhythm, The Green Pastures, The Love Wanga and Song of Freedom (all 1936); Bargain with Bullets, Big Fella, Dark Manhattan, Harlem on the Prairie and Underworld (all 1937); All’s Fair, The Duke is Tops, Gang Smashers, God’s Step Children, Gone Harlem, Life Goes On, Spirit of Youth, Swing and Two-Gun Man From Harlem, (all 1938); and Birthright, The Broken Earth, The Bronze Buckaroo, The Devil’s Daughter, Double Deal, Harlem Rides the Range, Keep Punching, Lying Lips, Midnight Shadow, Moon Over Harlem, One Dark Night, Paradise in Harlem, Prison Bait, Straight to Heaven, Way Down South and What Goes Up (all 1939).\n\nBLACK ACTORS OF THE 1930s\n\nAmanda Randolph, Ben Carter, Bill Robinson, Billie ‘Buckwheat’ Thomas\n\nButterfly McQueen, Cab Calloway, Canada Lee, Carman Newsome\n\nDooley Wilson, Dorothy Dandridge, Dorothy Van Engle, Duke Ellington\n\nDusty ‘Open the Door Richard’ Fletcher, Eddie ‘Rochester’ Anderson, Edna Mae Harris, Elisabeth Welch\n\nEmmett ‘Babe’ Wallace, Ernest Whitman, Ethel Moses, Etta McDaniel\n\nEunice Wilson, Fats Waller, Fayard Nicholas, Francine Everett\n\nGeorgette Harvey, Ira “Buck” Woods, Jackie “Moms” Mabley, James Baskett\n\nJeni Le Gon, Jess Lee Brooks, Jester Hairston, Jo Jones\n\nJoe Louis, Johnny Lee, Juanita Hall, Lena Horne\n\nLes Hite, Lillian Randolph, Louis Armstrong, Lucky Millinder\n\nMantan Moreland, Marguerite Whitten, Marie Bryant, Minto Cato\n\nNapoleon Simpson, Nicodemus Stewart, Oscar Micheaux, Oscar Polk\n\nRobert Adams, Robert Earl Jones, Ruby Dandridge, Sammy Davis Jr,\n\nShelton Brooks, Sidney Bechet, Vivian Dandridge, Willie Best\n\nWillie Covan, Woodie Strode\n\nBlack actors who made there film debuts in the 1930s but who aren’t pictured include: Al Duvall, Alfred Grant, Artie Young, Augustus Smith, Avanelle Harris, Babe Matthews, Bo Jenkins, Bob Howard, Bud Pollard, Buddy Harris, Carl Mahon, Celeste Cole, Charles Andrews, Charles Hawkins, Cherokee Thornton, Cleo Herndon, Clinton Rosemond, Columbus Jackson, Consuelo Harris, Cora Green, Corny Anderson, Dan Michaels, David Bethea, DeForest Covan, Donald Heywood, Dudley Dickerson, Earl J.

So did Dewey ‘Pigmeat’ Markham, although just one, at his short-lived Markham & Heckle. In 1946, Missouri-born producer William D. Alexander formed the Associated Producers of Negro Pictures in New York City. Other directors who turned to race movies include Richard C. Kahn, a white, former B-movie director, Canadian Leo C. Popkin and Kansas City, Missouri-native Josh Binney.\n\nAt the same time, many black musicians appeared in Hollywood-produced Soundies. Hollywood portrayals of and roles for blacks generally improved and “message movies” attempted to address race more sensitively, for eager, mostly white audiences. Hollywood also produced several big budget black musicals with black movie stars and, for the first time, began eating away at race movies’ traditionally strong fan base.\n\nWilliam D. Alexander‘s success in the forties was the exception to the rule for race movies. The result was a sudden and almost complete cessation of independent minority-aimed cinema that lasted for the next two decades. Before the arrival of 1950, both Oscar Michaeux and Spencer Williams had directed their final films. Black Cinema struggled considerably during through the 1950s and ’60s. It wouldn’t be until the 1970s, with the advent of blaxploitation, that black cinema truly rebounded.\n\nBLACK CINEMA IN THE 1940s\n\nExamples of black cinema of the 1940s include: Am I Guilty?, Broken Strings, Four Shall Die, Gang War, Mr. Smith Goes Ghost, Mystery in Swing, The Notorious Elinor Lee, One Big Mistake, Son of Ingagi, Sunday Sinners and While Thousands Cheer (all 1940); The Blood of Jesus, Carnival of Rhythm, Lucky Ghost, Mr. Washington Goes to Town, Murder on Lennox Avenue, Murder With Music and Up Jumped the Devil (all 1941); Brother Martin, Colored Amerians in the Nation’s Capital, Mokey, Professor Creeps and Take My Life (all 1942); Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs, Marching On!, Cabin in the Sky and Stormy Weather (all 1943); Boogie Woogie Dream, Eddie’s Laugh Jamboree, Go Down, Death!, The Negro Soldier, Of One Blood and We’ve Come a Long Way (all 1944); Big Timers, Caldonia, Harlem Hotshots, It Happened in Harlem, Laff Jamboree, The Negro Sailor, Open the Door Richard and Pigmeat Throws the Bull (all 1945); Baby Don’t Go Away from Me, Beware, Call to Duty, Chicago After Dark, Dirty Gertie from Harlem U.S.A., Fight That Ghost, The Girl in Room 20, House-Rent-Party, International Sweethearts of Rhythm, Jivin’ in Be-Bop, Laugh Jubilee, Mantan Messes Up, Mantan Runs for Mayor, Midnight Menace, Song Of the South, Stars on Parade and Tall, Tan and Terrific (all 1946); Beale Street Mama, The Betrayal, Boy!

The result was that there were far fewer examples of Black Cinema in the decade. In the years that followed, as TV chipped away at film’s dominance, a few black actors began appearing on the small screen in shows like Beulah (1950-1953) and The Amos ‘n Andy Show (1951-1953) which, whilst hardly socially progressive, at least offered more acting opportunities for black actors.\n\nThough race movies were done and over with, black actors and filmmakers made some in-roads in Hollywood. In 1952, William Walker was elected as a member the Screen Actors Guild Board of Directors, where he served until 1971. At the Guild’s meeting the year Walker joined, he and a pre-darkside Ronald Reagan presented a report titled “More and Better Roles for Negroes in Motion Pictures” from the Negro Employment Committee. Although no real changes came about as a result of it, Walker tirelessly continued to use his position to lobby Hollywood’s executives for years. Finally, in 1963, he partnered with the NAACP and successfully negotiated for the SAG’s Theatrical Agreement to include a non-discrimination clause.\n\nBLACK CINEMA IN THE ’50s\n\nHarlem Follies of 1949 and The Jackie Robinson Story (both 1950), The Harlem Globetrotters and Native Son (both 1951), Cry, the Beloved Country (1952), All My Babies, Crazylegs and The Joe Louis Story (all 1953), Burlesque in Harlem and Carmen Jones (both 1954), Carib Gold (1957), St. Louis Blues and Tamango (both 1958), Anna Lucasta, Imitation of Life, Porgy & Bess and Take a Giant Step (all 1959)\n\nBLACK ACTORS WHO GOT THEIR START IN THE 1950S\n\nAl Freeman Jr., Billy Dee Williams, Billy Preston, Brock Peters\n\nCarmen De Lavallade, Cicely Tyson, Clarence William III, Claudia McNeil\n\nColey Wallace, Diahann Carroll, Diana Sands, Geoffrey Holder\n\nHaywood Nelson, Helen Martin, Hilda Simms, Ivan Dixon\n\nJoe Adams, Lou Gossett Jr., Mahalia Jackson, Maya Angelou\n\nMillie Bruce, Nichelle Nichols, Olga James, Ossie Davis, Rosetta LeNoire\n\nNot pictured are Charles Swain, Fred Moultrie, Georgia Burke, Ike Jones, John Thurston, Marilyn Clark, Miles Clark, Moses LaMarr, P. Jay Sidney, Rosalind Hayes, Ruth Attaway, Stanley Greene, Thelma Oliver, Vince Townsend and Zelda Cleaver.\n\nBLACK CINEMA IN THE 1960s\n\nPrior to the 1960s, Hollywood’s preferred showcase for black talent was musicals. However, with the decline in their popularity, the industry continued to feature black characters in “problem films.“ In Sydney Poitier vehicles, the actor routinely played mainstream African-Americans who were articulate and bright and clean and nice-looking guys, leading to his nickname, “The Ebony Saint.” Meanwhile, on TV, a few programs aired that showed black characters in lead roles playing non-stereotypical characters for the first time. On shows like Star Trek, black characters were often featured, although the most prominent was Nyota Uhura, who was given little to do besides show leg. This led to Nichelle Nichols planning to leaving the show until she was urged to stay by a fan named Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nI Spy (1965-1968), Julia (1968-1971), and The Bill Cosby Show (1969-1971)\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of French and French-Italian co-productions and American regionals exploited racial tension in a less tempered manner and were shown in the Grindhouse circuit in the US, including: Les tripes au soleil (Checkerboard) – 1959, This Rebel Breed – 1960, Les lâches vivent d’espoir (My Baby is Black) – 1961, Murder in Mississippi – 1965 and The Black Klansman – 1966.\n\nNearly all films that dealt with race made in Europe or the US were directed by white directors and made mostly for white audiences. In Africa, Ousmane Sembène‘s 1966 feature-length debut was the first African film made south of the Sahara, and one which dealt with race in a highly intellectual, artistic and original manner. In the US, it wasn’t until Gordon Parks and Melvin van Peebles began making films toward the end of the decade that black American filmmaking resurfaced, with films like one of Van Peebles’s French productions, La Permission (1968), Parks’s The Learning Tree (1969) and Van Peebles’s follow-up, Watermelon Man.\n\nBLACK MOVIES IN THE 1960s\n\nI Passed for White and Sergeant Rutledge (1960), Raisin in the Sun (1961), Gone are the Days (1963), Black Like Me, The Cool World, Great Gettin’ Up Mornin’, Nothing But a Man and One Potato, Two Potato (all 1964), The Black Klansman and A Man Called Adam (both 1966), Dutchman and It Won’t Rub Off, Baby (both 1967), For Love of Ivy and Story of a 3 Day Pass (both 1968), The Learning Tree and Slaves (both 1969)\n\nBLACK ACTORS WHO MADE THEIR FILM DEBUTS IN THE 1960s\n\nAbbey Lincoln, Barbara Ann Tier, Bill Cosby, Della Reese\n\nDick Gregory, Dionne Warwick, Dizzy Gillespie, Don Marshall\n\nEsther Rolle, Fred Williamson, Gloria Foster, Greg Morris\n\nHal Williams, Isabel Sanford, Jackée Harry, Ja’net DuBois\n\nJeff Burton, Johnny Brown, Julius Harris\n\nMax Julien, Paul Winfield, Redd Foxx\n\nRobert Hooks, Robert Kya-Hill, Roscoe Lee Brown, Yaphet Kotto\n\nWoodie King Jr.\n\nNot pictured: Gary Bolling, Kyle Johnson, Leonard Parker, Marc Copage, Mark Dymally and Martin Priest.\n\nIt was due, in large part, to the efforts of Van Peebles, Parks and the growing number of black actors that had careers in the 1970s, Black Cinema would once again flourish under the banner of Blaxploitation. While at first a vibrant genre which produced several quality films, it too would once again be co-opted by Hollywood and white filmmakers who reduced to formulaic action films about pimps and hos. Black Cinema recovered in the 1980s as an independent alternative to Hollywood, with which it successfully co-existed for the first time — largely, no doubt, because Hollywood for the most part stopped bothering itself with focusing on or casting minorities in substantial roles. Since the ’80s, Hollywood’s preferred method of examining race has been with “Through Blue Eyes” films (e.g. Ghosts of Mississippi, Schindler’s List, Mississippi Burning, Dances with Wolves, Last Samurai, Amistad, Shogun, The Mission, &c), in which members of the oppressors (always white) become accepted by (and then help) the oppressed, who can’t help themselves without white assistance. So, although most modern black cinema titles may have a lower profile than examples in the past, rest assured there are numerous black films being released every week — just check out Amoeba’s enormous and popular Black Cinema section.\n\nEric Brightwell is an adventurer, essayist, rambler, explorer, cartographer, and guerrilla gardener who is always seeking paid writing, speaking, traveling, and art opportunities.
