        "text": "Last night, the SNG Opera in Balet performed composer Giacomo Puccini’s popular opera Madama Butterfly. The production appeared at Ljubljana’s neo-renaissance Opera and Ballet Theatre.\n\nThe opera was accompanied by the Slovenian Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Olsi Qinami. Qinami is Principal Conductor and Music Director of the London City Philharmonic and Conductor of the National Radio Symphony Orchestra of Albania. The opera was directed by talented Vinko Möderndorfer.\n\nCast\n\nThe orchestra and singers were incredible! Soprano Rebeka Lokar masterfully sang the demanding lead role as Cho-Cho-San, a young Japanese geisha. The opera has dancers and a large cast of characters, but these are the main roles:\n\nCho-Cho-San – Madame Butterfly – Rebeka Lokar Soprano\n\nSuzuki – Butterfly’s Companion – Gordana Hleb Mezzo-Soprano\n\nB. F. Pinkerton – American Naval Lieutenant – Luis Chapa Tenor\n\nKate – Pinkerton’s American Wife – Ana Dežman Soprano\n\nSharpless – American Consul – Ivan Andres Arnšek Baritone\n\nGoro – Japanese Marriage Broker – Matej Vovk Tenor\n\nPrince Jamadori – Rich Japanese Prince – Rok Bavčar Baritone\n\nStric Bonec – Cho-Cho-San’s Uncle – Marko Ferjančič Bass\n\nJapanese Imperial Commissar – Robert Brezovar Baritone\n\nBackground\n\nPuccini’s tragic opera is based on a short story by John Luther Long and a one-act play by David Belasco. Set in the early 20th century, Madama Butterfly explores “themes of love, heartbreak, betrayal, and cultural differences“.\n\nAn American lawyer and writer, Long developed his story through the “recollections of his sister, who traveled to Japan with her missionary husband”. Belasco was an American theatre producer and playwright, whose play – Madame Butterfly: A Tragedy of Japan – premiered in New York in 1900, and then moved to London, where Puccini saw it.\n\nIn 1904, the original version of Puccini’s two-act opera premiered in Italy at Teatro Alla Scala Milan. It was “poorly received“. Between 1904 and 1907, Puccini is said to have revised his opera five times. There are two- and three-act versions. Today, popular Madama Butterfly is “frequently staged in the classical repertoires of theatres around the world”.\n\nPuccini\n\nMadama Butterfly is one of Puccini’s greatest and “most modern” works. He “poured his heart and soul into creating the opera“. Puccini was deeply touched by the tragic destiny of the main character, Cho-Cho-San, a young woman who, “failing to fulfil her desire of love, stabs herself to death”.\n\nLUV Fest\n\nThe opera production is part of Ljubljana’s 2024 LUV Fest. Puccini’s powerful depiction of Butterfly’s “lyrical and heartbreaking psychological drama” is extraordinary. The sad love story often brings the audience to tears.\n\n_____________\n\n“Puccini understood that we’re complex beings, and thus, presented Butterfly not only as a victim, but also as a young girl seeking love. At the same time, she’s aware of her position and aspires to a better future.” Visit Ljubljana\n\n_____________\n\nTamaki Miura\n\n“Between 1915-1920, Japan’s best-known soprano, Tamaki Miura, won international fame for her performance in the lead role.” Memorials to Miura and Puccini can be found at Glover Garden in the port city of Nagasaki, the opera setting.\n\nNational Opera and Ballet Theatre\n\nThe venue, Slovene National Opera and Ballet Theatre. was built between 1890 and 1892 by Czech architects. The magnificent theatre was completely renovated. It has an interesting history and previously housed German (Nemško gledališče) and Provincial (Deželno gledališče) theatres.\n\nSlovenian classical ensembles were established in 1918. After World War II, “Slovene National Opera and Ballet toured abroad and received international acclaim”.\n\nI last saw Madama Butterfly performed in November 2022 at the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb. It’s a favorite opera. Last night, I had a perfect seat in a four-person box on the second level. Unfortunately, my boxmates didn’t speak English. They were friendly, but a bit taken aback by my American accent :o).\n\nThe ending had a surprise twist. Just as everyone braced themselves for the horrific final scene, Butterfly exited the stage without taking her own life! Then, her diminutive three-year-old son turned his back on Pinkerton and walked away, rejecting him for abandoning his mother. The audience loved it!"
