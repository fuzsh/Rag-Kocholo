        "text": "Mirror-Spectator By Aram Arkun Mirror-Spectator Staff THE ARMENIAN Volume LXXXIII, NO. 1, Issue 4246 NEW YORK — Dr. Taner Akçam, in an interview <strong>with</strong> the <strong>Armenian</strong> Mirror- Spectator after receiving the Man of the Year Award from the Knights of Vartan in on July 7 (see story below), expanded on some points of his speech and made interesting new observations on the course of Turkish-<strong>Armenian</strong> relations and the <strong>Armenian</strong> Genocide. Akçam is the Robert Aram, Marianne Kaloosdian, and Stephen and Marion Mugar Chair in <strong>Armenian</strong> Genocide Studies at Clark University. He said that the turning point in his relationship <strong>with</strong> <strong>Armenian</strong>s was the publica- J U LY 2 1 , 2 0 1 2 tion of his book, A Shameful Act, in 2006. The appearance of this book led him to become the target of an organized hate campaign coordinated from Ankara by the paramilitary semisecret organization Ergenekon. This in turn seems to have helped dissipate fears and suspicions about him <strong>with</strong>in <strong>Armenian</strong> communities in the diaspora. Akçam said that of course he also has changed in the past 20 years, especially politically. He gave an example of how he is now more open and relaxed than before: “When I first came to the United States, in 2002 or 2003, an <strong>Armenian</strong> group in New York wanted to give me an award. I declined. I was scared. Also, I was very careful not to make certain political demands, such as the recognition of the <strong>Armenian</strong> In OOur 80tthh YYeaarr The First English Language <strong>Armenian</strong> Weekly in the United States Since 1932 Prof. Akçam Muses on Turkish- <strong>Armenian</strong> Relations and Genocide NAASR Founding Chairman Manoog Young Dies BELMONT, Mass. — Manoog Soghomon Young of Belmont, the founding chairman of the National Association for <strong>Armenian</strong> Studies and Research (NAASR) and its chairman until 2001, died on Tuesday, July 3, at the age of 94. He is survived by his wife of 49 years Barbara (Johnson) Young, children Armen Young of Littleton, Mass., and Adrina Young Gobbi of North Billerica, Mass., and grandchildren Jake and Mariah Gobbi and Christopher and Lauren Young. Prof. Gerard J. Libaridian has aptly called Young “the father of the <strong>Armenian</strong> Studies movement,” and this begins to give a sense of Young’s role in ushering into existence the field of <strong>Armenian</strong> Studies in America and his half-century working to advance it. One of the founders of NAASR, which led the effort Manoog Young in 1995 in the 1950s and 1960s to establish permanent programs in <strong>Armenian</strong> Studies at American institutions of higher learning, starting <strong>with</strong> Harvard University, Young served as chairman of the Board of Directors from its inception in 1955 until 2001. During these decades both NAASR and the field of <strong>Armenian</strong> Studies continued to evolve and expand. see YOUNG, page 6 YEREVAN (Hetq) — Parliament member Ruben Hayrapetyan announced his resignation from parliament last week out of a sense of “moral responsibility” he feels over the June 17 beating of military physicians at the Harsnakar Restaurant he owns on the outskirts of Yerevan. The army doctors were beaten by restaurant employees and a personal bodyguard of Hayrapetyan. One of the physicians, Vahe Avetyan, never regained consciousness and died in a hospital a few days later. “I would give everything to have been there on that terrible evening and stopped the tragedy <strong>with</strong> my own hands. I would give everything to be able to turn the clock back. But I can’t,” said the tycoon, who has the nickname Nemetz Rubo, in his public resignation from the parliament. The move comes after a wave of public protest, both in the streets and on the internet, charging Hayrapetyan <strong>with</strong> creating an environment in which such a savage attack was possible and demanding that he resign. There is an on-line petition calling on UEFA and FIFA to call for Hayrapetyan’s resignation as the president of Armenia’s Football Federation. “I should have prevented such a tragedy but wasn’t able to. Such incidents should not be possible in establishments owned by see RESIGNATION, page 3 $ 2.00 Dr. Taner Akçam receives the Man of the Year Award from Dr. Dennis Papazian.

This unique event took place at the conclusion of the 94th annual Knights of Vartan Grand Lodge convocation in the ballroom of New York City’s Marriott Downtown Hotel during a banquet on Saturday, July 7. The gala event capped the almost weeklong convocation of the Knights and Daughters of Vartan, under the General Chairmanship of Antranik Platyan. Among see CONVOCATION, page 9 Hayrapetyan Resigns from Parliament Following Death of Beating Victim Ruben Hayrapetyan NEWS INBRIEF <strong>Cardinal</strong> <strong>Discusses</strong> ‘Brotherly Ties’ <strong>with</strong> <strong>Armenian</strong> <strong>Church</strong> ECHMIADZIN (RFE/RL) — A high-ranking envoy of Pope Benedict XVI called for the strengthening of “brotherly relations” between the Roman Catholic and <strong>Armenian</strong> Apostolic <strong>Church</strong>es during a visit on Monday. <strong>Cardinal</strong> Leonardo Sandri, prefect of the Catholic Congregation for Eastern <strong>Church</strong>es, met <strong>with</strong> Catholicos Karekin II, the supreme head of the <strong>Armenian</strong> <strong>Church</strong>, at his official residence in Echmiadzin. “<strong>Cardinal</strong> Sandri … addressed the Roman Catholic <strong>Church</strong>’s brotherly relations <strong>with</strong> the <strong>Armenian</strong> <strong>Church</strong>, expressing hope that they will become even closer and deeper,” read a statement issued by Karekin’s press office. It said Sandri, whose congregation oversees Catholic communities in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, passed on Benedict’s “warm greetings” to the top <strong>Armenian</strong> cleric. Karekin, for his part, spoke of his “brotherly love” for the pontiff and “particular warmness” between the two “sister churches.” “His Holiness emphasized <strong>with</strong> satisfaction the importance of the existing productive cooperation between the [<strong>Armenian</strong>] Mother See and the Vatican in the educational and social spheres,” said the statement. Sandri was scheduled to meet <strong>with</strong> Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandian on Tuesday. The cardinal was accompanied by Archbishop Rafael Minasian, the spiritual leader of the <strong>Armenian</strong> Catholic minorities in Armenia, Georgia and Eastern Europe. Turkey PM Calls Syria Massacres ‘Genocide’ ANAKARA (AP, DPA) — Turkey’s prime minister has warned Syrian leaders that the Syrian people will “make them pay” for massacres like the reported killing of dozens in a farming village by government forces this week. Recep Tayyip Erdogan calls the killings an attempted “genocide” and says such acts of violence are “the footsteps of a regime that is on its way out.” World leaders have heaped criticism on President Bashar Assad’s regime for the mass killings Thursday in the village of Tremseh. Activists say they have confirmed the deaths of more than 150 people at the hands of regime forces. Many more remain missing. The government says 50 were killed but denies its troops caused the deaths. Also on Saturday, opposition activists reported that at least 12 people were killed Saturday when a car bomb exploded in central Syria. Fifteen others were injured in the attack, which occurred in the district of al-Karameh in the central province of Hama, they added.
