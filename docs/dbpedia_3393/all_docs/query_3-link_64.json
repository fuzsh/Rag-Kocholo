The World Cup 2014 (20th edition) will be held in Brazil.\n\nHistory\n\nThe FIFA World Cup is an international football competition that takes place every four years in a host country. This competition was created in France in the town of Villefranche-sur-Mer on the Cote d'Azur by Jules Rimet, president of the Federation Internationale de Football Association or FIFA in 1928. The first edition was held in 1930 in Uruguay.\n\nThere was a first project to create a World Cup in 1905, but without result. In 1920, Jules Rimet, the first president of the French Football Federation and secretary Henri Delaunay deposited on the desk of the International Federation of a draft World Cup. He had to wait eight years to see the birth of the first Organizing Committee of the World Cup, which decided that the first would be the organizer Uruguay to celebrate the centenary of its independence in 1930.\n\nThe first trophy at stake (the Jules Rimet Cup, the work of French sculptor Abel Lafleur was won by Brazil in 1970 after his 3rd victory. It was a golden statuette of approx. 1.5 kg for a winged victory on an octagonal base on which are engraved the names of winners from 1930 to 1970. Lasts this period, the country remained victor holder until the next edition four years later. After his third win, Brazil received Cup final. The Cup was stolen twice, once in London in 1966 and again in Brazil, where it was never found. The new trophy (5 kg of gold), the work of Italian sculptor Silvio Gazzaniga, will not be retained by the conquering country. It is put into play every 4 years since 1974. Jules Rimet(1873-1956), is the innovator and world football, based primarily on the Parisian club Red Star, then became president of the new French Federation of Football Association in April 1919 (until 1949). Previously he had participated in the founding of FIFA in 1904 he became the president for more than 30 years (1921-1954). Inspired by the success of the Olympic tournament, he created the World Cup in 1930 bringing together the greatest football nations to describe the world champion. This cup bears his name until 1970. In 1955, it has been proposed as a Nobel Prize for Peace.\n\nRules and principles of the World Cup\n\nSince 2006, there are eight groups of four teams in the first round, each meeting once the other three.\n\n- A first round victory is worth 3 points, a draw is worth one point and a loss zero points.\n\n- The top two from each group qualified for the knockout stages following the number of goals scored, goal difference overall, the number of points scored, best attack, the result of a direct meeting between the two teams and the random fate.\n\n- From the knockout stages until the final, knock-out system wasadopted. If no result after 90 minutes of play, an extension of two times 15 minutes is disputed profit in gold and silver goal.\n\n- If after the extension (120 minutes of play), no team has scored, the winner is the one who wins a meeting of five shots on goal until the team takes advantage of a purpose.\n\nPenalties\n\nPlayers receiving a red card will be automatically suspended for the next game.
