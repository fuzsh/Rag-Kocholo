Players would bring a football; but opt for the volleyball courts when the police would come ask for their ball. The game of footvolley - first call 'pevoley' literally meaning \"footvolley\" was discarded for \"futevolei\". Footvolley started in Rio de Janeiro; however cities like Recife, Salvador, Brasilia, Goiania, Santos, and Florianopolis have players who have been playing footvolley since the 1970s.\n\nTeams of footvolley had five a side initially. Due to the skill level of the then footvolley athletes (nearly all were professional football players); the ball would rarely drop. Thus, the players began lowering the number of players on each side, eventually settling on 2 versus 2, which is still in use today.\n\nIn recent years, professional football players have taken up footvolley in both promotional events and celebrity matches. Some notable Brazilian footballers who have played (or still play) footvolley are: Romário, Edmundo, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho Gaúcho, Júnior, and Edinho (1982 & 1986 National Team).\n\nRules\n\nFootvolley combines field rules that are based on those of beach volleyball with ball-touch rules taken from Association football. Essentially footvolley is beach volleyball except no hands and a football replaces the volleyball.\n\nInternational Rules\n\nPoints are awarded if the ball hits the ground in the opponents' court, if the opponents commit a fault, or if they fail to return the ball. Scoring is done using the rally point system (NEW volleyball rules). Match scoring is usually up to the event organizer's discretion. Generally speaking matches are one set to 18 points; or best of three sets to 15 points (with third set to 11 points). The court is 29.5 feet x 59 ft (old beach volleyball). The height of the net varies based on the competition. The Official International Rule for the net height set is 2.2 meters or 7 feet 2 inches for the men's competition. For the women's competition, the height of the net should be set at 2 meters or 6 feet 6 inches.\n\nThe rules in the United States professional tour (Pro Footvolley Tour) are designed to make the matches faster and more aggressive. Some of the notable differences are: lower net height (2.05 Meters); no 'net' foul; 2-pointers are awarded up to 3-times maximum per set for all shots scored with the foot when one foot goes above the head when striking the ball and the other foot is off the ground (bikes, matrix kicks, etc.); and smaller court size 57 feet by 28.5 feet.\n\nInternational growth\n\nSince the sport's inception in Brazil, footvolley has spread and gained popularity internationally, including Europe, the United States, and Asia. The very first international footvolley event held outside of Brazil was sponsored by the United States Footvolley Association in March 2003. This relatively small event is what kick-started the international growth of the sport.\n\nMajor events have been held at many beach cities in countries around the world, including Spain, Portugal, Greece, France, Holland, Aruba, Thailand, South Africa, Brazil, Paraguay, etc.\n\nComments"
