        "text": "The Brazilian Atlantic forest is an area of highest priority for conservation. This present study concentrates on the Macaé de Cima Reserve of Nova Friburgo, state of Rio de Janeiro. The aim is to characterise the variations in the structure and floristic composition of the forest and to investigate their relationships with the physical environment at local and regional scales, based on vegetation and soil data collected in ten 20x20 m (400m2) plots established at different sites, and also by comparing floristic and environmental data from 51 areas within the Atlantic forest domain. Both analyses are based on multivariate techniques. Aerial photographs, Landsat TM satellite imagery and other spatial data are analysed through digital image processing and geographical information system software. The Reserve is covered by dense primary and old growth secondary tropical forest. Montane forest, the dominant vegetation type, covers slopes up to 1500m altitude. High montane forest occurs on top-slopes, in restricted mountain ridge areas. Secondary forests occur mainly on medium and lower slopes. The forest as a whole has an average density of 1108 trees/ha, and an average basal area of 43 m2/ha. The average total height is 14m, and the average wood volume reaches 171.3 m3/ha. A total of 445 trees were measured in the sampling plots, representing 164 species. Myrtaceae has the greatest number of species, followed by Lauraceae, Leguminosae, Melastomataceae, Monimiaceae, Rubiaceae, Clusiaceae, Moraceae and Sapindaceae. The species with highest IVI are Euterpe edulis, Licania kunthiana, Ocotea indecora, Vochysia saldanhae, Calycorectes sp.1, Dendropanax trilobium, Kielmeyera insignis, Cryptocarya moschata, Meriania robusta, and Clethra scabra. TWINSPAN classification reveals the occurrence of at least two groups of plots, one related to the montane forest formation and the other representing a transition between montane and high-montane or cloud forests.. The first axis of the DCA ordination is related to an altitudinal gradient. PCA analysis of forest structural, environmental, geographical and soil data revealed high correlation between altitude and Al, basal area and K, number of species and %C, clay content and slope. The CCA ordination reveals a correlation between altitude, height and canopy and the first axis, while slope, number of species, P, Ca+Mg, H+Al and CEC are correlated with the second axis. CCA also shows a relief gradient along two axes. The results support the hypothesis of a local mosaic composed by different plant communities that can be related to site and relief characteristics, with forest structure and composition, and site conditions strongly related to altitude, location on the relief and slope. Floristic patterns revealed by the classification (UPGMA, TWINSPAN) and ordination (DCA, CCA) of the 51 forest areas are strongly related to climatic and geographical variables. Köppen climatic types are shown to be good predictors of similarities between the areas. CCA reveals a gradient from low latitude, lowland warm areas with high rainfall to higher latitude and altitude, colder and drier areas. All methods distinguish the semideciduous from the coastal moist forests, with a transitional montane ecotone between the two main forest types. High altitude areas indicate links with Araucaria forests. Past (1970) and current land cover maps were produced, with results from local and regional scales analysis used as surrogate information for the classification. A conceptual model for the Atlantic forest vegetation in southeastern Brazil is proposed, based on the relationships between the forest vegetation and the physical environment."
