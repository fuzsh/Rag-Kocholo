        "text": "During former president Jair Bolsonaro’s administration (2019-2022), 795 members of Indigenous peoples were killed in Brazil, with almost 200 killings each year, according to a report recently released by the Bishops’ Conference’s Indigenous Missionary Council (known by the Portuguese acronym CIMI).\n\nAll kinds of violence had a surge in that period, in which land invasions, deforestation, and the violation of Indigenous rights also impacted hundreds of groups all over the country. Most homicides were committed by ranchers or illegal miners, loggers, and fishermen who invaded Indigenous territories. Two thirds of them occurred in the Amazonian states of Roraima and Amazonas and in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul.\n\nThat has been an unprecedented number of homicides in recent history. Between 2003-2015, for instance, there were 891 killings of Indigenous persons, an annual average of 68 each year. In the four past years, the average number of annual killings jumped to almost 199. During the Bolsonaro administration, Indigenous groups reported an average number of 374 cases of violence against them every year. Occurrences included murders, attempted murders, death threats, physical aggressions, sexual violence, abuse of power, and ethnic discrimination.\n\nCIMI’s report also pointed out that there were 835 deaths of Indigenous children with ages up to four years in 2022. CIMI considers those deaths to be the result of the Brazilian State’s omission, given that they are connected to the lack of healthcare services and food assistance. During the four years of Bolsonaro’s tenure, there were 3,552 deaths of Indigenous babies and toddlers.\n\nViolence and land disputes\n\nAccording to CIMI, all such violence is directly connected to a project of extermination of the Indigenous peoples in Brazil by social segments interested in grabbing their lands. The report points out that more than 60 percent of the Indigenous territories in Brazil have not been totally conceded by the government to their legitimate inhabitants yet and present some kind of administrative pendency in the process. The land grant procedure was not even initiated in great part of the cases.\n\nWithout the official ownership of their lands, most Indigenous peoples in Brazil have to deal with invaders claiming to have a right to occupy them. But even in reservations fully recognized by the State, the illegal presence of miners and loggers is rather common.\n\nThose problems, which have a historical nature in the South American country, have been greatly intensified during Bolsonaro’s years, affirmed Roberto Liebgott, a regional coordinator of CIMI in Southern Brazil. “Land invasions were programmatic during his government, with the indiscriminate exploitation of those territories by miners, loggers, and land grabbers who were many times backed by criminal organizations,” he said.\n\nRoadmap for an Indigenous genocide\n\nThe Indigenous peoples were “dehumanized” during his tenure, Liebgott said, something that was reflected in the violence they suffered and in the lack of healthcare structure for them. “Bolsonaro created a roadmap for a genocide of Indigenous peoples through their displacement, the violation of their rights, the environmental destruction, and the dismantling of the governmental structure in charge of monitoring their living conditions,” he analyzed.\n\nJúnior Hekurari, a Yanomami activist who has been struggling for his people’s right to have adequate healthcare service, described Bolsonaro’s administration as “a time of fear.” “Our territory was invaded by 20,000 illegal miners. Every day they were here threatening our communities, women, and children. We could not sleep with the noise of their heavy machinery,” he recalled.\n\nHekurari denounced the invasion several times, but the government never acted. At some point, the illegal miners took control of the government’s clinics in the Yanomami territory, and the Indigenous communities were left without any kind of support.\n\nNot enough changes with Lula\n\nIn the first month of his administration, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sent troops and police forces to take the invaders out of the Yanomami land and provided humanitarian relief. Now, the number of miners still operating there is much smaller, Hekurari said. “The army is here chasing the miners who are hidden in the rainforest. But that is not enough. In the city, the judiciary system has been releasing those invaders, despite the numerous crimes they perpetrated,” he lamented.\n\nIndeed, while most Indigenous groups celebrate the fact that Bolsonaro did not manage to be re-elected and that Lula is now the president, many of their leaders have been complaining that their problems continue. “Life has never been easy for us. Brazil has always mistreated the Indigenous peoples. The past four years were marked by violence and violations, but we still do not feel much change with the new administration,” said Edinho Macuxi, a leader of the Indigenous Macuxi people in Roraima state.\n\nEdinho said that the territory where the Macuxi and other groups live, called Raposa Serra do Sol, has been invaded by illegal miners – many of them are among the ones expelled from the Yanomami land. There, the dynamic is the same: they are arrested by officers and taken to a police station in the city just to be released after some time by the judiciary, he said. “Justice and Congress continue to be the same and tend to deny our rights. We need an effective protection policy from the federal government,” Edinho added. He said that many of the people who Bolsonaro incentivized to invade Indigenous lands will keep doing it in the future.\n\nUrgent intervention needed\n\nIn the Amazonian state of Rondonia, the Karipuna people saw an immense invasion in their territory by loggers and fishermen during Bolsonaro’s tenure. They estimate that now a third of their lands are deforested. “There were a few focuses of invasion before, but in his government they had a terrible increase,” he lamented.\n\nThe police have been launching raids in the Karipuna territory, but they have not been enough to solve the problem, Adriano said. “We need permanent surveillance stations covering all sides of our territory, otherwise the invaders will keep entering again,” he affirmed.\n\nAdriano has not been satisfied with the new authorities. He said the Karipuna people tried to schedule a meeting with members of the Ministry of the Environment and of the Ministry of Justice several times to present their problems, but they have never been received in Brasília. “We want to have a technical meeting with them, without intermediaries, to tell them how the government has to intervene to stop the invasion and the deforestation here. We want to be heard,” he said.\n\nAdriano added that the Lula administration’s “romantic rhetoric” concerning the protection of Indigenous rights has to be accompanied by real action. In Liebgott’s opinion, Bolsonaro’s legacy of destruction will endure for years. “The government needs to rebuild the Indigenous policies and resume land grants, the protection of the territories, and the prevention of violence,” he said."
